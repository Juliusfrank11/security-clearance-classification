Applicant is 41 years old and has no children. He was married to his first wife from
August  2004  to  June  2005,  and  married  his  second  wife  in  February  2020.  Since
graduating high school in 1999, he has attended a number of college courses but does
know how many credits he has earned. He has worked for his current employer  since
April 2021, and, shortly before the hearing, he was promoted to crew supervisor at the
local airport. This company is not sponsoring his security clearance, and this is his first
security clearance application. (GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 12, 20-21, 39-1; AE A)
The SOR alleged Applicant failed to file his state and federal income tax returns in
a timely manner, as required, for tax years (TY) 2013 through 2018. Additionally, he failed
to pay, as required, his federal income taxes for TY 2015 and 2016, and he owes $12,543
to the IRS. Applicant admitted these SOR allegations and claimed he has filed all relevant
state and federal income tax returns and established accepted payment plans with the
IRS and State A. The SOR also alleged Applicant has seven delinquent  non-tax debts
totaling an additional $8,950. He admitted these seven allegations as well.
In Applicant’s October 2018 SCA, he disclosed he failed to file his federal and state
income  tax  returns  for  TY  2013  through  2017,  as  required.  He  estimated  he  owed
approximately $1,000 for each TY, and his explanation for failing to file his returns and
pay his taxes was, “Money was extremely tight and I was irresponsible.” He also indicated
he  had  been  “in  contact  with  the  IRS  and  [he  was]  going  to  …  establish  monthly
payments.” In his SCA, he also revealed a number of other delinquent debts, and claimed
they were the result of slow work, irresponsible behavior, and issues related to his 2005
divorce. (GE 1 at 35-42; Tr. 22)
In February 2019, Applicant was interviewed by a Government investigator, and
his financial issues were discussed. At that time, he had not resolved his outstanding tax
issues. Additionally, Applicant acknowledged the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d, a charged
off credit card account for $6,722, and that he had not taken steps to resolve or address
it. The debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.e through 1.j were also discussed. The alleged non-tax-
related debts appear in Applicant’s 2018 and 2019 credit bureau reports (CBR), but they
do  not  appear  in  his  March  2022  CBR.  They  were  placed  for  collection  between
approximately 2012 and 2018. (GE 2 at 11-21; GE 3-5)
DOHA sent Applicant interrogatories at an unspecified date, and he responded on
January 31, 2020. In his response, he adopted the summary report of the February 2019
security interview, discussed supra, and he answered additional questions regarding the
status of his unfiled returns and delinquent taxes. He claimed he filed his federal income
tax returns for TY 2013 through 2018 on January 23, 2020, but provided no substantiating
documentation.  He  was  asked  to  provide  copies  of  his  IRS  account  transcripts  for  TY
2011 through 2018, and was given information as to how to obtain the transcripts. He did
not provide copies of the transcripts in his response to the interrogatories, in his Answer
to  the  SOR,  at  the  hearing,  nor  did  he  provide  post-hearing  submissions,  despite  his
request to leave the record open. In his interrogatory response, he admitted that he had
not filed his state income tax returns for TY 2012 through 2018. (GE 2 at 24-26; Tr. 15,
25-26)
In Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, he indicated his financial issues were the result
of being in the construction industry that caused a fluctuation in his income. He provided
a copy of an April 17, 2020 Internal Revenue Service (IRS) online payment agreement
(OPA) in which he agreed to pay by Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) $284 monthly. This
one-page document does not indicate when the agreement was established, how many
payments have been made, or what tax years the payments are being applied toward. In
his Answer, he indicated that his wife is an accountant, and she filed all of his federal tax
returns for him on January 20, 2020, and his State A tax returns for him on February 6,
2020.
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  he  has  filed  all  of  his  federal  income  tax
returns,  and  he  is  paying  $221  monthly  to  the  IRS.  Additionally,  he  testified  that  his
payments started in approximately January 2020, but he  did not provide substantiating
documentation  at  the  hearing  or  after  the  hearing.  He  also  testified  that  he  has  been
making payments to State A (since an unrecalled date) for his outstanding taxes, and his
payments are approximately $35 or $50 monthly. He provided no proof of these payments
as well. (AE A; AE C; Tr. 24-27, 29-30)

According   to   the   November  2021   IRS   statement  that  Applicant  provided   at  the
hearing,  his  outstanding   balance   with   the   IRS  is  $16,247.14.  He   testified   that  he   is
exploring   bankruptcy   to   address  his  debts   totaling   over  $115,000,   most  of   which  are
unalleged  and  do  not appear as delinquent in his 2022  CBR. At the  hearing, he  submitted
a  spreadsheet containing  some  of  alleged  debts and  his previously  mentioned  unalleged
debts. He indicated  that he  had  contacted  several of  his  creditors, and  if he  had  paid  any
of  the  debts,  his wife  would have  scanned  the  proof  of payments. Although  the  alleged
SOR debts no  longer appear on  most recent  CBR, he  admitted  that he  has not paid or
resolved any of them, rather the creditors had “written off” or “forgiven” the debts. (AE D;
Tr. 19, 32-38, 45)
Applicant currently earns $35 an hour, his wife owns her own accounting business,
and they keep their finances separate. He follows a written budget but did not provide a
copy of it. He anticipates attending credit counseling if he files for bankruptcy, but he had
not attended counseling as of the hearing date. (Tr. 39)
