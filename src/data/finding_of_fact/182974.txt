Applicant  is  a  52-year-old  wireless  communications  engineer  for  a  defense
contractor, employed since April 2019. He was the president of his own communications
company from August 1999 to at least April 2019. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 1995,
a master’s degree in 1996, and a professional certificate in 2002. He married in 2014 and
has three children.
The  SOR  alleges  under  Guideline  F,  that  Applicant  is  indebted  to  the  Federal
Government for delinquent taxes for tax year 2013, totaling about $33,000 (SOR ¶ 1.a);
and owes about $23,000 in delinquent taxes for tax year 2013 to his state of residence
(SOR ¶ 1.b). The SOR also alleges six charged-off debts or collection accounts, totaling
$62,711  (SOR  ¶¶  1.c-1g,  and  1.j);  and  two  defaulted  student  loans  totaling  $128,902
(SOR ¶¶ 1.h and 1.i). Applicant admitted the state tax debt and a collection account (SOR
¶¶  1.b  and  1.e);  and  denied  the  remaining  allegations  with  explanations.  He  provided
supporting  documentation  with  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  in  response  to  Government
interrogatories,  and  in  his  response  to  the  FORM.  The  record  evidence  is  sufficient  to
support the SOR allegations.
Applicant  was  self-employed  from  1999  to  2019.  Applicant  fell  ill  in  2001  with
Crohn’s disease that required hospitalizations and emergency surgery. Prior to 2019, he
had flare ups that prevented him from working. He used credit cards to bridge the gaps
in his income. His disease is now manageable. (AE A) He stated in his response to the
FORM, that a major contract with a large phone and internet carrier was cut in 2018. He
said prior to this loss of business, his debts were current. (AE A) Alternatively, he stated
in his personal subject interview (PSI) with a Government investigator in July 2019, that
the contract with a wireless carrier was cut in the winter of 2015, resulting in a significant
financial loss including credit card debts, two vehicle repossessions, and inexplicably, an
inability  to  pay  Federal  and  state  income  taxes  for  tax  year  2013.  (GE  5)  Applicant
secured  employment  with  a  defense  contractor  in  April  2019  with  an  annual  salary  of
$130,000.
SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b are Federal and state income tax debts for tax year 2013. In
his 2019 SCA, Applicant reported his tax delinquencies for tax year 2013. He stated  in
response to his state delinquency:
As an  entrepreneur we  have  to  balance  and  make  sure payments are  made
to  all  parties. Due  to  slow  pay  from  clients it’s a  steady  game  to  catch  up.
There was also a  point  where I had  Chron’s [sic] and  had  to  deal with  that
as well  as meeting  payroll  and  invoices.  Due  to  ending  of  contract I  had  to
make   sure   that  contractors  were  paid   before  I  could   take   care   of   my
personal  finances.  I  put   subcontractors  before   me   personally.   I   have
requested   payment   arrangements  for  both   state   and   federal  and   have   a
plan  to  have  it fully  paid within 6  months  to  one  year.  Although  they  gave
me  five years to repay I would like to clear up  and  pay off  early.
In  the  SCA  section  reporting  the  Federal  tax  delinquency,  he  stated:  “[p]ayment
arrangements have been made but the amount was too high. Requested that the agency
would reduce the monthly amount.”
In  his 2019  PSI,  Applicant claimed  that  he  was unable to  pay  his Federal and  state
tax  obligations for tax  year 2013  “due  to  lack of income  from  losing  the  contract.” However,
the  only  lost  contract he  discussed  in the  PSI was the  loss of  the  2015  contract.  In  his
response  to  interrogatories and  adoption  of  his PSI,  he  wrote  on  the  PSI;  “working  with
CPA. Proposed payment plan is $200/mnt.” (GE 5)
Applicant  attached  a  state  tax  authority  payment plan  agreement  (dated  January
2020)  to   his  response   to   interrogatories  to   pay   $468.81   per  month   for  60   months,
beginning  February  2020.  He had  a  balance  due  of  $23,773.47.  (GE  5  attachment C)  In
his  Answer  to   the   SOR,  he   said  he   was  unable   to   make   payments  according   to   the
agreement due  to  COVID and  a  lack of  funding. (Ans.) Also,  according  to  his interrogatory
response, he  failed to  file state tax returns when due  for  tax years 2012, 2013, and  2015
to  2018, and  apparently  failed  to  pay  state  taxes when  due  for  tax  years 2011  to  2014.
(GE   5   interrogatory   response)  I   have   not  considered   unalleged   tax   information   for
disqualification   purposes,  however  it   may   be   considered   when   assessing   Applicant’s
credibility, in the  application  of  mitigating conditions, and in the whole-person analysis.
Applicant obtained  another payment plan  with  the  state, dated  July  15, 2021, that
established   a   payment   of   $437.73   per month   for  60   months,  beginning   on   August  15,
2021. He made  one  payment of  $430  toward this debt in August 2021.  It  is unclear why
his payment was short  of  the  required  amount.  (AE  A) He then  noted  in his response  to
the  FORM, that  “[w]ithin 30  days of discharge,  I  will re-establish  payment  plan  terms.”  (AE
A)  There is no  evidence of  further payments made  on this debt.
Applicant’s interrogatory response regarding his delinquent Federal taxes shows
a failure to file Federal income tax returns in tax years 2012 to 2013, and 2015 to 2018.
(GE  5)  He  is  indebted  to  the  IRS  for  tax  years  2010,  2013,  and  2014,  totaling  about
$33,000.  (See  IRS  document  attached  to  Answer)  He  did  not  submit  IRS  account
statements  he  requested  from  the  IRS  in  March  2020.  (GE  5  attachment)  Applicant
established a payment plan with the IRS in May 2021, to pay $667 per month, beginning
May 28, 2021, to continue until the balance is paid in full. (Ans.) He paid the user fee and
three payments of the required amount in May 2021, to cover balances  due for May to
July  2021.  He  then  noted  in  his  response  to  the  FORM,  that  “[t]his  debt  will  not  be
discharged in the chapter 7 filing, and within 30 days of discharge, I will establish new
payment  plan  terms  and  resume  payment.”  There  is  no  evidence  of  further  payments
made on this debt.
Applicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in January 2021. Applicant said the tax debts
were not discharged under Chapter 7, so he will need to reestablish payment plans with
the  IRS  and  the  state.  (AE  A  and  B)  Applicant  provided  a  form  showing  a  Chapter  7
bankruptcy discharge order was signed on May 9, 2022, however he did not provide filing
documents that would show what debts were claimed, discharged, or the total amount of
the discharge. (AE B)
SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d are charged-off credit accounts. Applicant paid the small debt
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c in December 2020. He claimed to be disputing the account in SOR
¶  1.d,  but  did  not  present  evidence  of  a  legitimate  dispute.  He  then  negotiated  a
repayment  plan  with  the  creditor  in  March  2021,  paid  three  of  the  six  required  $50
payments, then stopped. In his response to the FORM, he claimed that the account would
be included in his Chapter 7 bankruptcy.
SOR ¶ 1.e is a collection account for an insurance company. Applicant claimed
that he disputed the account with a credit repair company, but did not produce evidence
of such a dispute or any documentation showing the credit repair company’s work on his
behalf. In his response to the FORM, he claimed that the debt would be included in his
Chapter 7 bankruptcy.
SOR  ¶  1.g  is  a  collection  account  for  a  credit-card  company.  Applicant  made
payment arrangements with the collection agent in February 2021, showed evidence of
two  payments,  but  claimed  he  paid  three  of  five  $50  payments  in  March  2021.  In  his
response to the FORM, he claimed that the account would be included in his Chapter 7
bankruptcy.
SOR  ¶¶   1.f   and   1.j  are  charged-off   vehicle   loans   for  two   vehicles  that  were
repossessed. Applicant’s 2021  credit bureau  report (CBR)  shows a  Toyota  account with
the  first delinquency  reported  in September 2015, and  a  major delinquency  reported  in
April 2021. On  the  Mercedes-Benz  account, the  first delinquency  was reported  in June
2015, and  the  major delinquency  was  reported  in  June  2019.  (GE  7) In  his PSI,  he  said
the  vehicles were used  in his business, and  were repossessed  because  he  fell  behind  on
payments  as a  result of  his lost  contract in 2015. (GE  5) In  his SCA,  he  said  the  accounts
became  delinquent  in  early  2017, and  that  he  had  not  taken  any  action  after the  Toyota
was repossessed.  Regarding  the  repossessed  Toyota  and  Mercedes-Benz, he  said  he
believed  that  once  they were repossessed, the  issue  was resolved. (GE 4) In  his Answer
to  the  SOR,  he  said  he  was disputing  the  accounts, but  did  not provide  evidence  of  the
disputes  or  their  results.  He  also  made  subsequent  voluntary  payments  on  these
accounts in March 2021, where he made three $100 payments on each account. In his
response to the FORM, he claimed that the accounts would be included in his Chapter 7
bankruptcy, but no documentary evidence was submitted to show the debt was included
or discharged in bankruptcy.
SOR  ¶¶  1.h  and  1.i  are  student  loans.  Applicant  did  not  report  his  delinquent
student loans on his SCA. According to his CBRs, his loans were reported delinquent in
December  2016,  in  February  2017,  and  again  reported  as  120-days  past  due  in
November 2017.  In  May  2019,  the  student  loans  were  placed for collection.  (GE  7)  In
Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, he noted that “payment terms have been established with
the student loan. Payments have been made and are attached.” (Ans.) With his Answer,
Applicant  included  a  letter,  dated  May  8,  2020,  from  a  collection  agent,  agreeing  to
rehabilitate  the  loan  for  nine  monthly  payments  of  $5,  beginning  in  May  2020.  No
payments  were  made  until  December  2020,  when  Applicant  made  three  $5  payments
after  receiving  a  letter,  dated  December  1,  2020,  from  a  new loan  servicer.  The  letter
shows a balance due of $137,251, although Applicant deleted what is likely other relevant
information on the letter. A student loan statement dated February 23, 2021, shows the
loans to be in a forbearance status, with $5 monthly payments beginning in November
2020 and ending in September 2021, with a balance due of $137,165. (Ans.) From March
2020  to  December  31,  2022,  student  loan  collections  were  paused  due  to  a  Federal
COVID-19 relief order. In response to the FORM, Applicant stated that within 30 days of
his  Chapter  7  discharge,  he  will  “request  the  income  repayment  plan  and  re-establish
payment plan terms.” (AE A)
Applicant submitted his resume, a certificate of completion, and several positive
character letters and letters of recommendation. He is described as trustworthy, honest,
a good friend, and having good judgment. He stated that he has previously held security
clearances,  and  was  the  facility  security  officer  (FSO)  for  his  company  when  it  held  a
facility clearance. (AE A)
He submitted  a  personal financial statement (PFS). (AE  A) The  PFS  shows a  net
monthly  income  of  $14,500  per month  based  on  his and  his spouse’s net pay, but appears
to  understate  his gross  salary  by  $10,000.  The  PFS  indicates that  he  has  a  net  remainder
of  $6,948  per month,  and  is  prepared  to  pay  $500  monthly  payments on  his student  loans,
$667  per month  for Federal tax debt, and $430 per month  for state tax debt.  In reference
to  the  PFS,  he  noted  that “[t]he  new  remainder that is shown  on  the  financial statement
indicates   that  there   are   funds   remaining   to   apply   to”  the   IRS,   state,  and   student  loan
debts. (AE  A)
