The SOR alleges that, as of March 4, 2022, Applicant owed $13,539 (SOR ¶ 1.a)
and $334 (SOR ¶ 1.l) in charged-off automobile-loan debts; $31,370 in federal student-loan
debts in collection (SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.j and 1.q-1.t); $460 (SOR ¶ 1.k) and $130 (SOR ¶ 1.o) in
medical collection debts; a $297 charged-off credit-card debt (SOR ¶ 1.m); a $159 car
insurance debt in collection (SOR ¶ 1.l); and a $112 cellular-phone debt in collection (SOR
¶ 1.p). When Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, she denied owing anything on
the automobile loans on the bases that she was told that she owed nothing on the debt in
SOR ¶ 1.a after her car was repossessed and sold at auction, and the loan in SOR ¶ 1.l
was paid off by insurance proceeds following a car accident. Applicant also denied the
medical collection debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.k and 1.o) and the insurance debt (SOR ¶ 1.n) as she
did not recognize them. She indicated that her account with the cellular-phone company
was current (SOR ¶ 1.p). She admitted her defaulted student loans and credit-card debts.
She  stated  she  would  pay  off  the  credit-card  debt  within  the  year.  She  provided  no
corroborating documents to show that any debts had been resolved.
Based on her admissions, I accept and incorporate as factual findings that Applicant
defaulted on the automobile loan in SOR ¶ 1.a, the credit-card account in SOR ¶ 1.m, and
the student loans in SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.j and 1.q-1. After considering the pleadings, exhibits,
and transcript, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 30-year-old plan production control specialist who has worked for a
defense  contractor  since  January  2019.  (GE  1;  Tr.  20,  24.)  She  did  not  do  well
academically in high school until her senior year. Needing credits before her college of
choice  would  accept  her  as  a  transfer  student,  she  took  classes  at  several  different
educational institutions between June 2010 and December 2012. In January 2013, she
matriculated into the university at which she earned her bachelor’s degree in accounting in
June 2016. (GE 1; Tr. 20-21, 52.) Applicant has never married and has no children. She
currently lives with her significant other of almost nine years.  (GE 1; Tr. 20-21.)
Applicant worked as a part-time server at a restaurant in high school and college.
From November 2014 to March 2017, she worked full time as an account manager while
continuing to work weekends as a server. She left her full-time job when offered a job in
finance. Although she was offered the position, she was ultimately not hired because of her
poor credit. (Tr. 52-53.) Her only employment from March 2017 to July 2017 was as a part-
time server at a conference center. From July 2017 to November 2017, Applicant worked
full-time for an energy assessment company. She resigned from that job because she did
not like the nature of the work. She held a part-time position in data entry for two months in
late 2017 before becoming a payroll specialist for a medical staffing company in January
2018 at $15 an hour. (GE 1; Tr. 26.) She left that job after one year due to issues with the
work environment. (GE 2.)
In January 2019, Applicant was hired by her current employer to work in a position
that  requires  a  security  clearance.  (Tr.  23.)  On  January  16,  2019,  she  completed  a
Questionnaire  for  Investigations  Processing  (SF  86)  for  a  DOD  security  clearance.  In
response  to  the  financial  record  inquiries  concerning  delinquency  involving  routine
accounts, Applicant disclosed the vehicle loans in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.l, but indicated that
the debt in SOR ¶ 1.l was resolved in August 2016. She explained that she was trying to
sell the car financed with the loan in SOR ¶ 1.a to settle the $14,000 debt. She listed no
other past-due debts on her SF 86. (GE 1.) About two months into her employment, she
was granted an interim confidential security clearance. For the next 18 months or so, she
maintained  the  clearance  with  no  issues  until  it  was  withdrawn  in  connection  with  this
pending adjudication. She has continued to work for her employer since then, but in a
position that does not require her to hold a clearance. (Tr. 23.)
Applicant’s  January  31,  2019  credit  report  revealed  significant  additional  debts
beyond the two car loans listed on her SF 86. The delinquency and payment histories of
her past-due debts are shown in the following table.

On August 19, 2019, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the
Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM).  Applicant  volunteered  that  she  had  federal
student loans that were initially in her parents’ names for which her wages were garnished
in her previous job. She stated she did not list them on her SF 86 due to oversight. She
was not aware of the loans’ current balances and was not sure if her wages were currently
being garnished for the debts. Applicant attributed her defaults of the car loans listed on
her SF 86 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.l) to  having insufficient income to make her monthly car
payments.  She  stated  that the  account in SOR ¶  1.l was resolved  as she  “totaled” the
vehicle and insurance paid the full loan balance so she should owe nothing on that loan.
As for the other vehicle, Applicant admitted that she had become $3,000 to $4,000 past
due in October 2017 before the car was auctioned off. She had taken a job at lower pay
and could not afford to maintain her car payment. She expressed a plan to contact the
creditor and establish a repayment plan. (GE 2.)
During her interview, Applicant was confronted with the adverse information on her
credit record. As for her student loans, she could provide no details but did not dispute the
information showing they were in collections as of January 2019. Applicant admitted owing
the $130 medical debt (SOR ¶ 1.o), which she recalled as becoming delinquent in 2013 or
2014. She did not recognize the $460 (SOR ¶ 1.k), $159 (SOR ¶ 1.n), or $112 (SOR ¶ 1.p)
collection debts. She acknowledged owing the $297 credit-card delinquency and explained
that she forgot about the debt.  She expressed a willingness and ability to pay her debts as
her financial situation was good. (GE 2.)
Applicant testified that her mother and stepfather applied (filled out the paperwork)
for the federal student loans for her education, and that she believed all the loans were in
her parents’ names. She also stated that about ten years ago, her parents transferred the
federal student loans into her name and did not inform her at that time. (Tr. 17-19.) She
subsequently testified that she knew that her parents were co-signers, and that she would
someday be responsible for repayment. (Tr. 60.) When asked on cross-examination as to
when she learned that the loans were seriously delinquent, she responded, “So long ago, a
long,  long  time  ago.”  (Tr.  34.)  She  admitted  that  when  she  learned  that  she  was
responsible for repaying them, she “did not do anything about it.”  She explained that, a few
years ago, her wages were garnished and some tax refunds were applied to her student
loans. After her OPM interview, she looked up her student loans and they were all reported
as closed accounts. She did not pursue any additional steps to inquire about the status of
her student loans or their balances because she did not know what action to take or whom
to contact about her loans. (Tr. 17-19, 34-35.) As to why she did not investigate her student
loans further, especially after being placed on notice of the security concerns raised by the
delinquencies, Applicant responded, “I don’t know. I’m just — anxiety. I don’t know. I can’t
pay them.” (Tr. 35.) Her wages are not currently being garnished for her student loans. (Tr.
37.)
As  for  the  car  loan  delinquency  in  SOR  ¶  1.a,  Applicant  testified  that  she  fully
financed  a  2012  model-year car for $24,000.  After she  missed  one  payment,  she  “fell
behind from there,” and the car was repossessed and then sold at auction. She explained
that she was told to come and pick up her belongings from the vehicle; that she called
twice and received no response. She said she never heard anything about the sale. When
then asked how she knew that she owed nothing on the loan, she responded,
I guess I’m  not sure. I don’t recall  ever hearing  back from  them, so  maybe  I
just  assumed  that everything  was taken  care of. Like I said,  if they’re  going  to
take  the  car back, why  didn’t I hear from  them. . . and  I reached  out twice.  I
reached  out two  times. I called  the  towing  company, and  they  didn’t have  it. I
had  to  call  a  different towing  company  because  they  didn’t even  tell  me  who
took it, and I just never heard back from anybody. (Tr. 31-33.)
Applicant believes her student-loan delinquencies are hindering her career. She has
not been eligible for promotions at work, which would have increased her income, because
of a lack of security clearance. (Tr. 19.) Her income  of  “a little over $60,000  a  year”  is
barely enough to cover her living expenses. (Tr. 19, 24.) She received bonuses from her
employer in April each year of her employment. For 2022, her bonus was $1,200. (Tr. 25.)
It went toward paying for car repair expenses of $2,300 incurred from an accident during
the winter. (Tr. 51.)
Applicant’s significant other is an electrician. His annual income is comparable to
her income, so about $60,000-$65,000. They try to split household expenses evenly each
month, although they cover for each other when necessary. During the COVID pandemic in
2020,  he  was  without  any  income  for  about  four  months.  He  has  otherwise  been
consistently employed. (Tr. 22-23.)
In June 2022, Applicant and her significant other moved in with a friend because of
a rent increase at their previous address. (Tr. 19, 37, 43.) They had been paying $2,200
per month in rent, which included utilities. They had yet to pay rent for their new living
quarters. Applicant expects the rent to be between $900 and $1,200 a month, which will be
split between her and her significant other. (Tr. 38, 44.) She expects her utility and cable
expenses to decrease since those expenses will be split among her, her significant other,
and the friend who owns the house. (Tr. 46.) She has nothing in savings and maintains
about $1,000 in her checking account. (Tr. 50-51.) She does not have any open credit-card
accounts.  Her  only  outstanding  credit-card  debt  is  the  $297  on  the  closed  credit-card
account (SOR ¶ 1.m). (GE 4; Tr. 51-52.) She has not had any financial counseling. (Tr. 52.)
She expects to be able to pay $100 from each paycheck toward her student loans. (Tr. 38.)
Applicant  obtained  a  car  loan  of  $16,974  in  May  2019  for  a  2013-model  year
vehicle. Her car payment is $445 per month. As of October 2019, the loan balance was
$16,979, and she was making her car payments on time. (GE 4.) The interest rate on her
loan is high, around 25%, due to her poor credit. (Tr. 46-47, 49.) Applicant has tried several
times to refinance her car loan without success. (Tr. 49-50.) She owes about $12,000 on
her car loan. (Tr. 49.) Her car insurance expense recently decreased from approximately
$300 to $180 per month. (Tr. 47.)
