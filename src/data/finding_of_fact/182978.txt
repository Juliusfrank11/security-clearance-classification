In  Applicant’s  answer to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  the allegation  in  SOR  ¶  1.a and
denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b-d. He did not admit or deny SOR ¶ 2.a in his answer.
In a subsequent email exchange with the CAF in April 2022, he answered the allegation,
SOR  ¶ 2.a, by stating:  “I admit  there  is some  charge  belong  to  me  but  at  the  time  my
Equifax  did  not  show  up  on  my  credit  report  when  I  did  e-quip  questions.  .  .  .  His
admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a  47-year-old mechanic employed  by  a  federal contractor since  June
2018. He received  a  bachelor's degree  in 2005. He  served  in the  Army  National Guard
from  1998  to  2003, receiving  an  honorable discharge. He married   in  2014  and  has no
children.  The  SOR  alleges that Applicant has four  delinquent debts totaling  approximately
$39,575.00,  and  that  he  deliberately  failed  to  disclose  these  debts on  his  e-QIP.  (Exhibit
3 at 37.)
SOR ¶ 1.a: past due account with a balance of $31,830. In the PSI Applicant
states this is a student loan debt. He admits the debt and states he is “working to resolve
from Biden’s American  Rescue  Plan  To  Forgive  Student  Loan.” His  most  recent  credit
report, May 2022, shows the current debt as $31,923.  The last activity reported on the
credit report is October 2016. (Exhibit 4.)
SOR  ¶  1.b:  past  due  account  for  $2,405.00  with  a  balance  of  $17,885.00.
Applicant denies the debt and states it is a student loan debt related to the debt alleged
in SOR ¶ 1.a. His March 2020 credit report shows this and the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a
being held different companies. This debt is not reflected on the May 2022 credit report.
SOR ¶ 1.c: past due account charged off in the amount of $4,808. Applicant
denied the allegation on the basis he was working on a payment plan. In support of his
denial he provided correspondence from the credit card company dated April 2021. The
credit  card  company  provided  him  multiple  options  to  resolve  the  debt.  His  May  2022
credit report shows the last payment activity as March 2017.
SOR ¶ 1.d: past due account with a balance of $532. Without explanation or
supporting documentation, Applicant denies a medical account debt listed on his March
2020 credit report on the basis it is “wrong charged [sic].”
SOR ¶ 2.a. When Applicant submitted his SCA in November 2018, he answered
“No”  to  all  of  the  questions  in  response  to  Section  26  - Financial  Record  Delinquency
Involving Routine Accounts:
Other than  previously  listed, have  any  of  the  following  happened?  In  the
past  seven   (7)  years,  you   had   bills  or  debts   turned   over  to   a   collection
agency?  [and] In  the  past seven  (7) years, you  had  any  account or credit
card  suspended,   charged   off   or  cancelled   for  failing   to   pay   as  agreed?
(lnclude  financial obligations for which you  were  the  sole debtor, as well  as
those  for which you were a cosigner or guarantor).
He   did  not   admit   or  deny   the   allegation   in   his  response   to   the   SOR.  The   CAF  in   a
subsequent email  exchange  in April 2022  obtained  his answer to  the  allegation  he  stated,
“I admit there  is some  charge  belong  to  me  but at the  time  my  Equifax  did not show  up
on  my  credit report when  I did e-quip questions  . . . .  In his  PSI, he stated  that  it was an
oversight on his part.
