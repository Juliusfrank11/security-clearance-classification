Applicant  is  a  53-year-old  field  office  administrator  for a  Government  contractor
since  September  2021,  and  employed,  mostly  overseas,  by  various  Government
contractors since 2009. He served in the Army National Guard from 1986 to 2009 when
he was honorably discharged. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2016. He is unmarried
and has an adult son. He has never held a security clearance as a civilian.
The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant failed to file Federal and state
income tax returns, as required, for tax years 2003 – 2014, and tax years 2016 and 2017.
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b) He admitted both SOR allegations, and noted, “all taxes were filed
in 2018.”
In  December  2019,  the  Government  sent  Applicant  interrogatories  requesting
information on his tax delinquencies. He responded that he filed Federal and state income
tax returns for tax years 2003 to 2014, in August 2018, and filed income tax returns for
tax years 2016 and 2017, in August 2018, although his tax transcripts show most of the
delinquent returns were filed in October 2018. He indicated that for each tax year, he did
not owe taxes, and that he had no outstanding Federal or state tax liabilities. He submitted
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) transcripts as of December 2019, showing:
TY  2009  - return filed  Oct  2018  - zero balance (inquiry for non-filing of tax return
sent November 2010).
TY  2010  - return filed  Oct  2018  – zero balance (inquiry for non-filing of tax return
sent in November 2011).
TY  2011- return  filed  Oct  2018  –  zero balance after paying interest and penalty;
credit  was  transferred  from  another  tax  year  (inquiry  for  non-filing  tax  return  sent
November 2012).
TY  2012  - return filed Oct 2018  – zero balance after credit transferred out (inquiry
for non-filing tax return sent December 2013).
TY   2013   -  return   filed   April  2014;   amended   return   filed   September 2018   –  zero
balance after credit transferred out to 2003 and 2004 (inquiry for non-filing tax return sent
November 2014).
TY  2014  –  return  filed  Dec 2018  –  Account  balance: -$15,416 (inquiry for non-filing
tax return sent October 2015).
TY  2015  –  return filed  March  2016  –  zero balance after interest and penalty; credit
transferred to 2002 and 2003 and credit transferred in from 2016 and 2017.
TY  2016  –  return filed  Oct  2018  – zero balance after credit transferred out to 2015.
TY  2017  –  return filed  Oct  2018  –  zero balance after credit transferred out to 2015.
TY  2018  –  return  filed  May  2019  – zero balance after credit transferred out to 2011.
In testimony, Applicant said he filed his past-due tax returns from 2003 to present,
after  he  realized  his  security  clearance  eligibility  was  in  jeopardy.  He  testified  that  he
changed  his  withholding  in  about  2018.  He  also  claimed  he  took  action  after  being
interviewed by a Government investigator. He said he does not owe any taxes because
the IRS recovered funds via garnishment and captured subsequent tax year refunds. He
said he has no credit issues, and paid off his first home before selling and purchasing
another home in December 2021.
In the past, Applicant ignored his income tax filing requirements because he did
not have the money to pay taxes. He prepared draft returns in 2003 to 2005, but did not
file them because he did  not  have  the money to  pay the tax owed.  He first  took a  job
overseas in 2009, which complicated his ability to file tax returns. He continued overseas
assignments from 2009 to present. In 2011, his bank account was temporarily frozen by
the IRS because of tax delinquencies, and his pay was garnished in 2012. He said he
filed his 2013 to 2015 tax returns in 2016. In 2017, he changed tax preparation companies
because of alleged criminal practices of his prior preparer. Although not alleged in the
SOR, Applicant’s 2020 and 2021 returns were filed after the filing deadline.
Applicant did not submit evidence of state income tax return filings or any balance
due, but he claimed that he filed all returns and does not owe state income taxes. After
the Government’s closing argument, Applicant stated:
Applicant: I just want to say I agree with Mr. Bryan 100 percent. I cannot
argue the testimony that’s - - on any of that . . . that he said. I’m not going
to waste your guys’ time because I get the feeling that no matter what I do,
what  I  present  you  guys,  the  decision’s already  made.  It’s final.  I get  it.  I
understand. I agree that I’m the responsible one. I screwed up. I didn’t pay
the taxes. We’re over and done with it. We can close this today. I appreciate
your guys’ time.
Administrative  Judge: Well, hold on a minute. It’s incorrect to say that the
decision  is  done.  We’re  here  - - I’m  here  to  hear  your  side  and  the
Government’s side, and to make that determination. So…
Applicant: It’s done.
Administrative Judge: …if you want to - - look, if you want to give up, that’s
your - - that’s your decision.
Applicant: I’m done. Yes. I’ll be honest with you. I’m not wasting any of you
guys’ - - I don’t want to waste the Government time no more. You guys get
paid by the taxpayers, so I don’t want to waste your guys’ time, so - -.
(Tr. 52-53)
Despite Applicant’s assertions and professed unwillingness to continue, I held the record
open  so  that  he  could  submit  post-hearing  documentation  in  support  of  his  case,  as
discussed throughout the hearing. He indicated that his employment contract was ending,
and he did not care if he was employed again as he had other opportunities. After I urged
him to think about submitting something, and that there was plenty of time to do so, he
said, “I’ve thought about it.” (Tr. 53-54) He did not submit any post-hearing material.
Applicant earns about $100,000 per year, and has about  $17,000 in bank assets.
He has   about   $20,000   in equity   in his home,   and   paid for his son’s   college  tuition  and
expenses. He has not attended  financial counseling.
