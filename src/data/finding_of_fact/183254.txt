Applicant is 60 years old and has been married to his current wife for twelve years.
He was married to his ex-wife from 1982 until 2007, and they have two adult children. He
has  no  ongoing  financial  support  requirements  for  his  ex-wife  or  children.  In  1990,  he
received  an  associate  degree  in  industrial  electronics.  He  enlisted  in  the  U.S.  Marine
Corps in 1980 and served until 1990, when he was honorably discharged as a sergeant
(E-5). He has worked for Defense contractors, since July 1990, and he has been with his
current employer since 1997. His current job title is lead test engineer. He has held at
least  a  secret-level  security  clearance  since  1981,  and  held  a  top-secret  security
clearance for an unrecalled period when he was in the Marine Corps. (Tr. 10-11, 26-29,
88; GE 1; GE 2; AE A)
The SOR alleged that Applicant had eleven delinquent debts totaling $38,365. In
his second response to the SOR, he indicated, “I admit” to each of the SOR allegations.
However, he claimed he was “making payments” toward SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.c, 1.f, 1.g, and
1.j, and he had “paid off” SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.e, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.k. Therefore, I am considering
his admissions to be de facto denials. He did not submit supporting documentation  for
these claims. The Amendment to the SOR included three delinquent debts totaling $1,492
and an account that was $13,390 past due on an account with a total balance of $122,191.
Additionally, the Amendment alleged that he misused his company’s credit card between
2015 and 2017. He admitted these five allegations. (SOR; Answer; HE I; HE II; GE 1 at
46)
In  Applicant’s June 2019 SCA, he disclosed the debt alleged in SOR ¶  1.h and
three  unalleged  debts.  He  also  disclosed  that  he  used  his  company  credit  card  for
personal use, as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.p. He indicated his financial issues were the result
of his wife’s health issues, and all of the detailed debts were being paid. At the hearing
he  testified  that prior to  completing his SCA, he discussed his family finances  with  his
wife. She told him that they had some delinquent debts, but she had established payment
arrangements, and the debts were being paid. He was unaware that they had delinquent
debts prior to completing the 2019 SCA. He did not investigate the status of his finances
further or confirm that the delinquent debts were being paid, because she told him she
had “a handle” on the bills. He continued to trust her with their finances, despite her past
inability  to  manage  money  responsibility,  as  discussed  below.  He  was  also  unable  to
monitor their finances closely due to his frequent work-related travel. (GE 1 at 46-51, Tr.
30-32, 40-46)
As  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.p,  starting  in  approximately  2015,  Applicant  used  his
company-issued-travel card, at his wife’s request, to pay for personal things they needed
when they were between paychecks. They would pay off the card when he received his
next  paycheck  before  the  card’s  billing  cycle.  He  resorted  to  using  his  company  card,
because his personal credit cards were “close to their limit and … there wasn’t enough
money on the card to put the total amount on the personal card.” He did this more than
ten times, despite knowing it was a violation of his company’s policy, and continued until
his misuse was discovered in a company audit. He received a written counseling and a
one-week suspension with loss of pay from his job. He could not recall how much money
in total he charged to his company card. (GE 2 at 4; Tr. 33-38, 88)
Applicant travels overseas between four to ten months each year for his job, and
he has been doing this for at least five years. His time spent overseas is collective, not
consecutive.  While  he  is  abroad,  his  wife  handles  their  finances,  and  according  to
Applicant, she has not handled them well. Despite Applicant’s wife asking him to use his
company-travel  card  to  pay  for  their  household  expenses,  he  was  still  under  the
impression that she had a “handle” on their finances. He occasionally saw letters from a
creditor or a debt collector, but she would tell him that she had things under control. (GE
2; Tr. 33-39)
Applicant testified that he started taking a more active role in their family finances
in approximately May 2021. He admitted at the hearing that he should have started doing
this “a lot sooner, but with traveling as much [as he does, he] can only do so much over
the phone” in the management of their finances. (Tr. 46-47)
At an unrecalled date, Applicant’s wife was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease, and
it continues to be a problem for her. She worked fulltime until approximately 2016, but in
the past six years, she has only managed to work part-time. At the time of the hearing,
“even  with  paying  off  the  debts” Applicant and  his wife  were “not hurting  for anything.”
(GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 30-32)
Between,  2012  and  2017,  Applicant  and  his  wife  took  seven  cruises  to  the
Dominican Republic, Belize, Canada, Ireland, and Mexico. According to him, they “pretty
much did not have to pay that much for the cruises.” (Tr. 38-39; GE 1)
During his July 2019 interview with a government investigator, which he adopted
in June 2020, Applicant discussed the debts alleged in the SOR. He did not recognize the
debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.e, and 1.o. (GE 2)
The   $14,881   credit-card  debt  alleged   in   SOR  ¶   1.a   remains   unresolved.  The
account  was  opened   in  September  1987,   Applicant  stopped   making   payments  in
approximately  July  2015, and  the  account was charged  off  in  2018. In  his answer to  the
SOR, he  indicated  that  he  was making  payments  on  this debt. At the  hearing, he  stated
he  had  been   making  $200  monthly   payments  since  an   unrecalled   date,   in   accordance
with  a  settlement agreement.  However, in his post-hearing  submission, he  submitted  a
June   7,  2022   settlement  agreement  with   the   creditor.  The   first  $496.05   payment  was
scheduled   to   be   paid  on   June   6,  2022.  The   creditor  agreed   to   accept  eleven   $496.05
payments,  totaling   $5,456.55.  Applicant  did  not  submit  proof   of   any   payments  made
toward this debt.  (Answer; GE  2 at 8; GE 3  at 3; GE 4  at 3; GE 5  at 3-4; GE 6  at 5; AE  C;
Tr. 48-52)
The  $4,493  credit-card  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.b  remains  unresolved.  The
account  was  opened  in  December  2013,  Applicant  stopped  making  payments  in
approximately January 2019, and the account was charged off in 2019. In his answer to
the  SOR,  he  indicated  he  was  making  payments  toward  this  debt.  At  the  hearing,  he
stated he had made two $200 payments toward this debt, and his post hearing submission
from the creditor confirmed he started making $200 monthly payments in April 2022. The
creditor has not entered into a settlement agreement with him, and he is required to make
$200 monthly payments until the balance is resolved in February 2024. (Answer; GE 2 at
8; GE 3 at 3; GE 4 at 4; GE 5 at 4-5; GE 6 at 7; AE D; Tr. 52-56)
The $4,198 credit-card debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c remains unresolved. The account
was  opened  in  August  2012,  Applicant  stopped  making  payments  in  approximately
August 2015, and the account was charged off  in 2019. In his answer to the SOR, he
indicated he was making payments toward this debt. At the hearing, he could not provide
a  status  for  the  debt.  In  his  post-hearing  submission,  he  submitted  a  December  2021
email from Equifax regarding a dispute over an account, but the email does not indicate
if it is for the account alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c. (Answer; GE 2 at 8; GE 3 at 3; GE 4 at 3; GE
5 at 4; GE 6 at 5; AE E; Tr. 56-58)
Applicant  provided  post-hearing  documentation  to  demonstrate  that  on  May  25,
2022, he paid in full the $645 credit-card debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d. He was an authorized
user  on  this  account.  His  wife  opened  it  in  January  2018,  it  became  delinquent  in
September 2018, and it was charged off in January 2019. In his answer, he indicated he
had already paid it. At the hearing, he testified that he paid it off in April or May 2022;
however, it is now resolved. (Answer; GE 2 at 8; GE 3 at 3; GE 4 at 6-7; GE 5 at 6; GE 6
at 10; AE D; Tr. 58-59)
The  $171  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.e  remains  unresolved.  It  was  opened  in
December 2018,  and charged  off  in  June  2019.  In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he
indicated he had paid it off. At the hearing, he stated that he believed it was paid, but he
did  not  know  for  sure.  The  account  does  not  appear  on  his  most  recent  credit  report;
however, it was charged off, and he has not provided documentation to demonstrate that
this account has been resolved. (Answer; GE 2 at 8; GE 3 at 3; GE 4 at 6; GE 5 at 6; GE
6 at 9; AE B; Tr. 59-61)
The $7,360 credit-card debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f remains unresolved. This debt
has been transferred to a collection agency, and it is unclear when it was originally opened
and became delinquent.  In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he indicated he was making
payments toward this debt. The May 2022 credit report in the record reflects a balance of
$8,412. At the hearing, Applicant stated he spoke to the creditor a month or two before
the hearing and established a payment agreement to resolve the debt by May 2025, and
he could not recall how many payments he had made toward the debt. In his post-hearing
submission, he provided documentation that he entered into a settlement agreement with
the creditor at an unspecified date. However, his first payment of $574.38 payment was
made  on  May  25,  2022,  and  then  he  is  required  to  make  $100  bi-weekly  payments,
starting on June 3, 2022, until the settlement balance of $7,800 is resolved in May 2025.
(Answer; AE G; Tr. 61-62)
Department Counsel withdrew SOR ¶ 1.g at the hearing, as it is duplicative of SOR
¶ 1.j. (Tr. 63-64)
Applicant  submitted  a  post-hearing  submission  to  demonstrate  he  resolved  the
$591 credit-card debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.h.  He settled it for $500 on May 25, 2022. In
his SCA, he claimed he was making payments toward a settlement, and the debt would
be paid in July 2019. During his July 2019 interview, he again claimed it would be resolved
in July 2019. In his answer to the SOR, he claimed he had paid this debt; however, as
noted above, it was not resolved until May 25, 2022. (Answer; GE 2 at 6; GE 3 at 9; GE
4 at 4; GE 5 at 3; GE 6 at 6; AE H; Tr. 64-66)
Applicant  submitted   a   post-hearing   submission   to   demonstrate   that  he   resolved
the  $199  utility  debt alleged  in SOR ¶  1.i. He provided  a  June  7, 2022  statement from  the
creditor demonstrating  that the  debt was resolved; however, it is unclear when  it was paid
or how  much  he  paid.  In  his  answer to  the  SOR, he  had  indicated  that  he  had  already
paid this debt.  (Answer; GE  2  at 7; GE  3  at 9; GE  4  at 2; GE  5  at 1;  AE  H; AE  I;  Tr. 66-
67)
The $2,758 credit-card debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.j remains unresolved. This debt is
a  duplicate  of  SOR  ¶  1.g.  It  was  opened  in  2016,  and  placed  for  collection  in  2017.
Applicant told the investigator that he had negotiated a settlement of $1,200, was making
payments, and the debt would be resolved in April 2020. He also indicated in his answer
that he was making payments. In his post-hearing submission, he provided a March 2019
offer of settlement; however, he failed to provide proof of payments. The June 10, 2022
credit report submitted by Applicant demonstrates that he is disputing this debt, but it still
appears as unpaid. (Answer; GE 2 at 6; GE 3 at 9; GE 4 at 1; GE 5 at 2; AE J; AE L; Tr.
67-69)
The  $458  credit-card  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.k  remains  unresolved.  Applicant

The  home  equity  account  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.l,  was  past  due  in  the  amount  of
$13,390.  It  was  opened  in  October  2007,  and  became  delinquent  in  November  2020,
when Applicant stopped making his monthly payment of $1,276. According to Applicant,
his bank advised him to stop making payments while he was in the process of refinancing
the loan. He ultimately refinanced it, and the delinquent payments and interest were rolled
into the principle. At the hearing, he could not explain what he did with more than $7,500
of payment money he did not make to the creditor while refinancing his loan. This account
is current according to his most recent credit report. (GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 3; GE 6 at 4; AE
L; Tr. 70-74)

federal  income  tax  returns  for  tax  year  2021,  nor  was  he  sure  if  his  wife  had  filed  an
extension. They had established a monthly budget approximately four years ago, and his
wife continues to pay all of their bills except for their mortgage. (Tr. 81-89)
Applicant wants to continue to serve the United States Government, and he does
not consider himself to be a risk to security. The oath he took as a Marine is not something
he took lightly, and he still keeps this oath. (AE A; Tr. 91-92)
