Applicant  admitted  SOR ¶¶  1.a  and  2.a  through  2.p,  and  he denied  SOR ¶¶  1.b.
He  is  62   years  old.  He   married   in   1981,   separated   in  1994,   divorced   in  2020,  and
remarried  in January  2021.  He  has three  adult children. He earned  a  bachelor’s degree
in 1982  and  a master’s  degree  in 1986. (Answer; Tr. at 19-20, 23, 69-70, 80, 84, 86, 94-
103, 187; GE 1, 2, 3, 8)
Applicant served honorably in the U.S. military from December 1982 to February
1996. He then worked for another government agency (AGA 1) for 20 years, from April
1996 until he retired in October 2016. He was unemployed from October 2016 to January
2017,  and  March  2018  to  September  2019.  As  of  the  date  of  the  hearing  and  since
September  2019,  he  was  the  deputy  director  of  security  for  a  mixed  community
development.  In  March  2018,  he  received  an  offer,  contingent  on  obtaining  a  security
clearance,  to  work  as  an  analyst  for  a  DOD  contractor.  He  was  granted  a  security
clearance by AGA 1 in April 1996. (Answer; Tr. at 6, 19-23, 65-66, 72-75, 93-94, 133-139;
GE 1, 2, 3, 4)
The   SOR  alleged   the   following   personal  conduct  security   concerns:   (1)  in
approximately   February   2010,   while   employed   as  an   acting   unit   chief   with   AGA   1,
Applicant  was investigated  for engaging in unprofessional conduct on duty  with a female
support employee  (F1); the allegations were substantiated; and  Applicant received a 20-
day suspension (SOR ¶ 1.a); and (2) in approximately September 2016, while  employed
by  AGA  1  and  assigned  overseas,  Applicant was investigated  for allowing  a  non-AGA  1
employee   (F2)  to   drive   an   AGA   1-issued   vehicle,  behaving   in  an   inappropriate   and
offensive  manner towards F2  in the  form  of  an  unwelcomed  sexual advance, and  lacking
candor when questioned about the incident and in his signed sworn statement during a
disciplinary  inquiry;  the  allegations  were  substantiated;  and  Applicant  was  allowed  to
voluntarily retire from AGA 1 (SOR ¶ 1.b).
The SOR also alleged the following financial considerations security concerns: (1)
Applicant  petitioned  for  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  in  approximately  October  2020,  and  his
petition was pending as of the date of the SOR  (SOR ¶ 2.a); (2) he had 12 delinquent
consumer debts  totaling  $50,329  (SOR ¶¶ 2.b, 2.d, 2.e, 2.g, and 2.j  - 2.p);  (3) he had
three  delinquent  medical  debts  totaling  $5,772  (SOR  ¶¶  2.f,  2.h,  2.i);  and  (4)  he  was
indebted to the IRS for $1,000 in delinquent federal taxes for tax year (TY) 2017 (¶ 2.c).
In  addition  to  Applicant’s  admissions  to  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  2.a  through  2.p  in  his
Answer, the personal conduct allegations are established by AGA 1 records. The financial
considerations  allegations  are  established  by  his  admissions  in  security  clearance
applications from February 2017 (SCA 1) and May 2018 (SCA 2), in his February 2021
response to interrogatories, and during background interviews from November 2018 and
December  2018,  as  well  as  by  bankruptcy  court  records  and  three  credit  reports from
2018, 2019, and 2020. (Answer; GE 1-8)
Personal Conduct
AGA 1 records reflect that in approximately February 2010, while employed as an
acting unit chief, Applicant “dropped several dollar bills down the shirt of  [F1] while she
was  at  her  desk.”  As  a  result  of  Applicant’s  unprofessional  on-duty  conduct,  AGA  1
suspended Applicant for 20 days without pay, and ordered him to obtain counseling from
Human  Resources  on  proper  office  behavior.  This  was  Applicant’s  first  disciplinary
incident at AGA 1, and his AGA 1 security clearance was not suspended or revoked as a
result. (Tr. at 23-31, 103-117; GE 4)
Applicant denied any malicious intent. He testified that he had been working late
over a period of  several months, and on one such night at approximately 9:00  pm, he
encountered  F1  sitting  at  her  desk  with  a  cake  on  the  table  in  front  of  her.  F1  was  a
secretary, with whom he had solely a professional relationship, and he spoke with her on
an almost daily basis for the preceding five to six months. He described F1 as “younger
than  my  youngest  grandchild  at  the  time.”  When  he  learned  from  F1  that  it  was  her
birthday  cake,  he  engaged  in  a  southern  tradition, familiar  to  him,  called  “pinning.”  He
explained  that when  a  person  has a  birthday, “we  take  a  pin and  we  pin dollar bills on
their collar. And everybody would do that. So you dress them in dollar bills as good luck.”
(Answer; Tr. at 23-31, 103-117)
Applicant stated:
So  I didn’t have  a  pin and  I reached  over -- I said if  you  don’t mind,  I don’t
have  a  pin, but  here. It  was about five  or six  singles.  I  said  tomorrow  morning
buy  yourself lunch  on  me  because  lunch  is  only  about  $3  or $4. And  I  took
the  -- Ma'am, I took the  dollars and  she  had  on  a  -- she  had  on  a  sweater
and  she  had  on  a  blouse  underneath.  And  I  took -- I  took the  dollars and  I
tucked it in her sweater, not touching her skin. And I told her to buy herself
lunch the next day. And I walked out.
(Tr. at 26)
Applicant testified that he subsequently saw F1 for three weeks “and we spoke as
we normally did,” until he was called into an office and told that he was being investigated
for the above-described incident. He testified that he subsequently talked to F1, and F1
told him “yes, when you did it, I was offended.” He testified that he apologized to F1, told
her he “didn’t mean anything by it” and “didn’t mean to offend [her],” and she responded
by telling him that he was forgiven. He testified that he learned, years later, that F1 had
been dating the “current Deputy Director” of AGA 1. Applicant testified that this individual
did  not  like  Applicant  and  was  not  satisfied  unless  Applicant  was  punished  for  this
incident, despite F1’s acceptance of Applicant’s apology. (Answer; Tr. at 23-31, 103-117)
AGA  1’s  suspension  was  upheld  on  appeal.  Applicant  testified  that  he  hired  an
attorney and filed a lawsuit against AGA 1, alleging that AGA 1 punished him harsher for
this  incident  than  other  AGA  1  employees  who  had  committed  more  egregious  acts.
Applicant  testified  that  AGA  1  settled  this  lawsuit  in  approximately  2012  and  paid  him
$50,000, of which $41,000 went to his attorney’s fees. He did not provide documentation
to corroborate his claims. He acknowledged that F1 never gave him any indication that it
was permissible for him to touch her, and he should have known better. He testified that
he pinned her “off the cuff,” and realized that it was unwise for him to have done so. He
intended to never engage in this behavior again. (Answer; Tr. at 23-31, 103-117)
AGA 1 records also reflect that in approximately January 2016, while employed by
AGA 1 and assigned overseas, Applicant allowed F2 to drive an AGA 1-issued vehicle,
behaved  in  an  inappropriate  and  offensive  manner  towards  F2  in  the  form  of  an
unwelcomed sexual advance, and lacked candor when questioned about the incident and
in  his  signed  sworn  statement  during  a  disciplinary  inquiry.  Consequently,  AGA  1
proposed  Applicant  for  dismissal  in  August  2016;  Applicant  voluntarily  retired  in
September 2016; and the disciplinary inquiry closed based on Applicant’s retirement. This
was Applicant’s second disciplinary incident at AGA 1, and his AGA 1 security clearance
was again not suspended or revoked as a result. (Tr. at 29-66, 117-133; GE 4)
Applicant admitted only to allowing F2 to drive a vehicle, but he denied knowing
that it was an AGA 1-issued vehicle. He also denied that he behaved in an inappropriate
and offensive manner towards F2 in the form of an unwelcomed sexual advance, and that
he lacked candor when questioned about the incident and in his signed sworn statement
during  a  disciplinary  inquiry.  He  testified  that  AGA  1  placed  him  on  an  overseas
assignment in 2015, after the individual in charge (BOSS) personally asked him for his
assistance due to being understaffed. During the incident in question, in October 2015,
BOSS was out of the country. (Answer; Tr. at 29-66, 117-133; GE 3)
On that morning, Applicant testified that his supervisor (SUP), who was the acting
BOSS, asked him to drive her daughter, F2, home after an AGA 1 function that evening,
because SUP would be with her spouse celebrating their anniversary. He testified that
SUP provided him with a car, which he believed was an AGA 2-issued car. He testified
that F2 was around 24 or 25 years old at the time, was an AGA 2 employee, and he had
briefly met F2 one week prior when SUP had him over for dinner. At the conclusion of the
AGA 1 function, at approximately 9:00 pm, he acquiesced to F2’s request to grab a quick
bite to eat. He testified that F2 was not ready to go home and he had also not eaten since
mid-day,  but  he  insisted  to  F2  that  he  would  have  to  drive  her  home  as  soon  as  they
finished eating. (Answer; Tr. at 29-66, 117-133; GE 3)
Applicant permitted F2 to drive the car to a restaurant she liked. He testified that
he  did  so  because he had mistakenly left  his  glasses  on  his desk and  could  not  drive
without them at night; F2 was more familiar with the area than he was, with the exception
of the route he knew for how to drive her directly back home from the venue where the
function was held that evening; he had not seen F2 consume any alcohol that evening,
and F2 told him she had not consumed any alcohol when he asked her if she had; and
he thought it was permissible since he believed the car was AGA 2-issued and F2 was
an AGA 2 employee. He testified that the car’s license plate said “[AGA 2]” and “[BOSS]”
in small print underneath it, and that he had never been briefed on the policy of the car.
(Answer; Tr. at 29-66, 117-133; GE 3)
Applicant testified that F2 consumed two beers at the first restaurant, and told him
before  their  food  arrived  that  she  was  ready  to  leave  because  she  did  not  like  the
restaurant’s menu. He stated that he  has never consumed alcohol. He testified that F2
became belligerent when F2 attempted to leave the restaurant with a beer in her hand,
and the waiter told F2 that she could not take an open container out of the restaurant. He
testified, “[F2] snarls at [the waiter] and then [F2] gives it back -- after [F2] pours the rest
of the beer on the ground and gives [the waiter] back the glass.” (Answer; Tr. at 29-66,
117-133; GE 3)
Applicant  testified  that  after  he  witnessed  F2  consume  alcohol  at  the  first
restaurant, he drove the car for the remainder of the night. He  testified that as he was
driving F2 home, he stopped at a second restaurant at her request. He testified that the
restaurant was closing, and F2 burst through the door to go to the restroom. He stated,
“And I know I’ve got something on my hand now. I have a problem . . . .” When F2 returned
to the car, he told her he was taking her home because it was approximately 10:00 pm
and it was getting late. He testified that he asked F2 to call SUP, but she refused and he
did not have SUP’s phone number. (Answer; Tr. at 29-66, 117-133; GE 3)
Applicant testified  that  he  stopped  at  a  third  restaurant,  at F2’s request.  He  testified
that  he  insisted  to  F2  that he  had  to  take  her home because  it was late,  but F2  persisted
that “we’re  not  going  to  take  long. This won’t  take  long. We’ll grab  something  to  eat and
then  we’ll go.” He testified  that when  they  got inside  the  restaurant,  F2  began  consuming
alcohol.  He   testified   that he   got upset because  “[F2]   starts telling   me   about   her sexual
fantasies.   And   [F2]’s  telling   me   about  all   the   boyfriends  she   has  at   [AGA   2]  .   .  .   .”  He
testified   that   she   stopped   when  he   told   her,  “I don’t  want to  hear [about]   your personal
life.  I  said   that’s  too   much   --  it’s  TMI  --  too   much   information.”  He  testified   that  F2
continued  to  consume  alcohol and  became  more verbal about her  “sexual proclivities,”
and  “what she  was getting  [at],  she  was building  up  toward me.” He  testified  that  he  told
F2 to stop, he walked out, and he told F2 he would meet her at the car. After he waited
at the car for 20 minutes, he returned inside the restaurant and told F2 he had to take her
home. (Answer; Tr. at 29-66, 117-133; GE 3)
Applicant testified that as he was about to drive into the area where F2 lived, F2
wanted to go to a fourth restaurant that everyone went to because of its close vicinity to
AGA 2 and where everyone lived. He stated, “And that was a fatal mistake that I made
because that’s where it all went bad.” He testified that inside the fourth restaurant, F2 told
him about how much she loved pornography, and he suggested that she had an addiction
for which she should seek counseling. He testified that F2 “got angry. And at that point,
everything turned.” He testified that he went to the car and waited for F2, and when he
went back inside the restaurant, F2 was “really inebriated” and started touching him. He
testified that he asked F2 to stop and told F2 that if she did not stop, he would leave. He
testified that he asked F2 to call  SUP, and  when  she  did  not,  he  took F2’s phone  and
retrieved a number from it, called SUP on his phone, and had F2 talk to SUP. (Answer;
Tr. at 29-66, 117-133; GE 3)
Applicant stated that it was approximately 12:00 am when he returned to the car
and waited for F2. He testified that F2 came to the car at approximately 2:00 am, and
“she was sloppy drunk.” He testified that F2 tried to touch him as he drove her home. He
stated, “And when she tried to touch me, I jerked my head and I hit my head on the window
on the driver’s side of the car.” He testified that when he got to F2 and SUP’s house, F2
let herself out, he waited for her to get inside the house, and then he drove the car to his
home  because  it  was  late.  He  drove  the  car  back  to  SUP’s  home  the  next  morning.
(Answer; Tr. at 29-66, 117-133; GE 3)
Applicant acknowledged that he lost control and exercised poor judgment in letting
F2 dictate where he could take her, rather than just bringing her home. He maintained
that he never made any sexual advances toward F2. He stated:
I never made  one  inappropriate  move  or made  any  inappropriate  comments
to  [F2].  What happened was, [F2] got drunk and she acted in a pattern -- in
a  way  inconsistent  with  her professionalism  and  she  was embarrassed. And
we   work  in  a   small   office.  She   was  embarrassed   to   see   me.  She   was
embarrassed  to  talk  to me  after that.  She  lied and  reversed  everything  and
put it on me  in  that I was drinking  and  that I made  inappropriate  comments
to  her. And  that  I made  -- I  attempted  to  touch  her inappropriately. Those
were all lies.
(Tr. at 29-66, 117-133)
Applicant described F2 as manipulative. He testified that F2 told him that because
SUP  brought  F2  overseas,  SUP  owed  F2,  and  F2  could  also  get  anything  from  her
biological father and stepfather. He testified that F2 also had control over BOSS, through
SUP.  He testified that the following Thursday, SUP called him into her office and told him
he  had  to  return  stateside,  which  he  did  the  following  night--in  November  2015.  He
testified that BOSS, who was still out of the country, called him to ask what happened
and informed him that F2 filed a complaint with AGA 1 against him. He testified that F2
alleged that he let F2 drive an AGA 1-issued car under the influence of alcohol; he made
inappropriate comments to her; and he made inappropriate contact with her. (Answer; Tr.
at 29-66, 117-133; GE 3)
Applicant stated that AGA 1 “took the word of a drunk -- an inebriated lady over a
seasoned [AGA 1 employee] . . . There was nobody there to corroborate our statements.
And they said I lied.” He maintained that he told AGA 1 the truth during the disciplinary
inquiry and he told AGA 1 that he would voluntarily submit to a polygraph to prove himself.
He acknowledged that he faced a dilemma: whether he should fight F2’s claims through
the  disciplinary  inquiry  and  risk  dismissal  from  AGA  1,  just  as  he  was  reaching  his
mandatory  retirement  age  in  April  2017.  He  stated  that  he  knew  the  internal  AGA  1
investigation would be a lengthy process; he was not liked by upper management at AGA
1, to include the individual who sought to punish him during the 2010 incident;  he was
having  medical  issues,  as  further  discussed  below;  and  his  divorce  had  become
contentious.  He chose not to jeopardize  his retirement and he  elected to  retire  in May
2016. He continued to work until the end of September 2016, while holding his AGA 1
security clearance and in a classified facility. His security clearance lapsed after he was
no longer employed by AGA 1. (Answer; Tr. at 29-67, 80-84, 117-133; GE 1, 2, 3, 4)
AGA 1 records reflect that in both the 2010 and 2015 incidents, Applicant refused
to take any responsibility for his predatory actions; he continually blamed the victims; and
he also potentially harmed AGA 1’s reputation because the victims trusted him based on
his position within AGA 1. There is no evidence that Applicant had any other incidents of
unprofessional conduct during his employment with AGA 1 or with any other employer.
He testified that he was raised to live his life according to Christian principles, as his father
was  a  deacon,  his  mother  was  a  deaconess,  and  he  also  served  as  a  deacon  in  his
church. Although his philosophy was to try to always do good, he learned as a result of
these incidents to keep a strictly professional interaction with females and to take caution
to not allow himself to be in an environment with another female without a witness. (Tr. at
23, 147-148; GE 4)
Financial Considerations
Applicant previously petitioned for Chapter 7  bankruptcy in approximately 1997.
He stated that after his ex-spouse got into a car accident, she signed an agreement with
their insurance company, unbeknownst to him,  that allowed the  insurance company to
recoup her related medical expenses of approximately $27,000 from any settlement she
received.  When  she  did  not  follow  through  with  the  agreement,  he  faced  a  potential
garnishment of his wages at AGA 1, as his ex-spouse never worked outside of the home.
He stated that the garnishment order would have jeopardized his employment with AGA
1,  so  he  elected  to  file  bankruptcy.  I  will  not  consider  Applicant’s  1997  Chapter  7
bankruptcy, or any other matter not alleged in the SOR, in evaluating the disqualifying
conditions under this guideline; however, I will consider this information in my mitigation
and whole-person analysis. (Tr. at 89-91)
In October 2020, Applicant again petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy (SOR ¶ 2.a).
He received a bankruptcy discharge in February 2021 of all of his listed liabilities, totaling
$57,410, which included the consumer and medical debts alleged in the SOR (SOR ¶¶
2.b, 2.d - 2.p). He also received credit counseling through his bankruptcy case. (Answer;
Tr. at 75-76, 79, 151-152; GE 3, 5, 6, 7, 8)
Applicant  attributed   his  2020   Chapter  7   bankruptcy   and   associated   financial
delinquencies   to  beginning   in   2015,   when   he   was  diagnosed   with   prostate   cancer   and
began  incurring  medical debt. After he  retired  from  AGA  1, he  was also unemployed  from
October   2016   to   January   2017.  Following   his  prostatectomy   in  2017, he   suffered  from
life-threatening   medical  problems   and   incurred   more  significant   medical  debt.  He   was
unemployed   again  from   March   2018   until   September  2019.  In   2018,  when   his  then-
spouse  filed  for divorce,  he  was initially  ordered  to  pay  her alimony  of $2,000  monthly  and
then   $1,500   monthly.  He   incurred   alimony   arrears  totaling   approximately   $52,000.  He
also  financially   assisted   his  daughter,  after  her  spouse   left   her  and   she   became   a
struggling   single  mother.  He  stated   in   SCA   1   that   he   was  working   with   a   credit   repair
company  to  dispute  inaccuracies on  his credit reports. (Answer; Tr. at 66-75, 89, 92,  94-
103, 139-140, 146-147; GE  1, 2, 3; AE  A)
SOR ¶ 2.b is for $24,300 in alimony arrears. Applicant testified that the U.S. Office
of Personnel Management (OPM) issued a check out of his AGA 1 retirement pay to his
ex-spouse for $39,000 in 2020, when the divorce was finalized, and that he was re-paying
OPM  through  a  three-year  repayment  plan  of  $805  monthly.  He  also  testified  that  the
balance of his alimony arrears, after OPM’s issuance of a check to his ex-spouse, was
approximately $13,000. As of the date of the hearing, he testified that he also continued
to pay his ex-spouse court-ordered alimony of half of his AGA 1 retirement pay, or $2,000
monthly, and he intended to continue to abide by the court’s alimony order. (Tr. at 69-72,
78, 140-144; AE M, N)
Documentation reflects  that as of  May  2021,  the balance of  his alimony arrears
was  $15,845.  Documentation  also  reflects  that  Applicant  made  12  payments  of  $100,
approximately once monthly between June 2021 and March 2022, to his ex-spouse in an
effort to resolve his alimony arrearage. (Tr. at 69-72, 78, 140-144; AE M, N)
SOR ¶  2.c  is for $1,000  in delinquent federal taxes for TY  2017.  Applicant  admitted
this  debt  in  his  Answer,  and   he   testified   that  he   paid  this  debt.  He   did  not  provide
documentation  to  corroborate  his claim  of  payment. Documentation  reflects that Applicant
filed  his federal income  tax  returns for TY  2018, 2019,  2020, and  2021  in March 2022; he
owes  $6,046,  $2,905,   and   $3,848   in  federal  taxes  for  TY   2018,  2019,  and   2020,
respectively; he  requested  payment plans with  the  Internal Revenue  Service (IRS) of  $75
monthly  for each  delinquent tax  year to  resolve his outstanding  federal taxes for TY  2018,
2019, and  2020;  and  he  was due  a  $4,093  federal refund  for TY  2021. (Answer; Tr. at  76-
79, 101, 144-146, 148; AE B, C, D, E, H, K)
Applicant attributed his outstanding federal taxes for TY 2018, 2019, and 2020, in
part,  to  a  $100,000  withdrawal  he  made  when  he  cashed  out  his  401(k)  retirement
account after his ex-spouse filed for divorce in 2018. He testified that he was paying the
IRS  approximately $300 monthly to  resolve  his outstanding federal taxes for TY 2018,
2019, and 2020, and his federal refund of $4,000 for TY 2021 would also be applied to
his outstanding federal taxes. He did not provide documentation to corroborate his claims
of payment towards his outstanding federal taxes. (Answer; Tr. at 76-79, 101, 144-146,
148; AE B, C, D, E, H, K)
Documentation also reflects that Applicant filed his state income tax returns for TY
2019, 2020, and 2021 in March 2022, at the same time he filed his federal income tax
returns for the same tax years; he owes the state tax authority $3,232 and $1,942 in state
taxes for TY 2019 and 2020, respectively; he requested payment plans with the state tax
authority of $100 monthly and $75 monthly, to resolve his outstanding state taxes for TY
2019 and 2020,  respectively;  and he  was  due  a state refund of $334 for TY 2021. He
attributed these outstanding state taxes to the state tax authority’s failure to tax his AGA
1 retirement pay. He stated that he did not correct this error to his AGA 1 retirement pay
and  instead  planned  to  pay  the  state  tax  authority  when  he  filed  his  state  income  tax
returns.  He  stated  that  he  was  paying  $150  monthly  towards  these  outstanding  state
taxes. He did not provide documentation to corroborate his claims of payment towards
his outstanding state taxes. (Answer; Tr. at 76-79, 101, 144-146, 148; AE F, G, I, J, L)
SOR  ¶  2.d  was  for  a  $2,772  cellular  account  in  collection.  Applicant  indicated
during his 2018 background interviews that he planned to pay this debt.  This debt was
discharged in his 2020 Chapter 7 bankruptcy. (Tr. at 86; GE 3)
SOR ¶¶ 2.e, 2.o, and 2.p were for past-due car rental debts of $500, $897, and
$694.  Applicant  testified  that  these  debts  were  for  damages  claimed  by  the  rental  car

aware of the SOR allegations. She felt that the personal conduct security concerns were
