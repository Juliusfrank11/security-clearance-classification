Applicant is 57 years old. He married in 1993, separated in 2007, and his divorce
was final in 2010. He has two children of this marriage, a son, age 25, and a daughter,
age 23. He received a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering in 1995.
Applicant  worked  for  a  large  federal  contractor  between  1983  and  March  2012.
The  Department of  Defense (DOD) granted him eligibility for a clearance first  in 1985,
and later in 2008. He stated that he never had any security issues or concerns, except
for those in the SOR. His employer laid him off for economic reasons beyond Applicant’s
control, and he was unemployed between March 2012 and July 2013. He had difficulty
finding another engineering job and became a truck driver in July 2013. He obtained a
commercial  driver’s  license  and  worked  as  a  commercial  truck  driver  until  December
2017. Another federal contractor hired him in December 2017, and his current employer
and security sponsor hired him in March 2019.
Applicant  has  continuously  worked  for  federal  contractors  since  2017,  initially
making  about  $111,000  annually.  (Tr.  42)  He  testified  that  in  2019,  when  he  started
working with his current employer, he was making about $135,000 a year. He claimed he
is  currently  earning  about  $150,000  a  year.  (Tr.  41-42)  I  note;  however,  that  his  IRS
account  transcript  for  tax  year  2021  shows  his  adjusted  gross  income  to  be  close  to
$112,000. (AE 5)
Applicant  submitted   his  most   recent  security   clearance   application   (SCA)  on
January  7, 2018, seeking  the  continuation  of  his clearance  eligibility  required  for his job.
In  Section 26  (Financial Record)  of his  2018  SCA,  he  disclosed he  filed for a Chapter  13
reorganization  in February  2016  (alleged  in SOR ¶  1.a), and  was delinquent  in his child
support payments  to  a  state’s  child  support enforcement agency  (alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.b  -
$59,219 in arrearages).
Applicant explained that his financial problems were the result of his acrimonious
divorce, his 13-month period of unemployment, and being underemployed between July
2013 and December 2017. He stated that upon his divorce  in 2010, the court required
him to pay approximately $2,000 a month in financial support for both children, and $2,000
in alimony to his ex-wife. (Tr. 21) Applicant’s earnings as a commercial truck driver were
less  than  what  he  was  making  before  his  divorce,  and  he  could  not  make  the  court-
ordered child support and alimony payments and still pay for his living expenses. He fell
behind in his mortgage  and homeowner’s association  payments.  He consulted with an
attorney who advised him to file for a Chapter 13 reorganization to avoid losing his home.
Applicant filed for Chapter 13 reorganization in February 2016. He participated in
the reorganization and made the scheduled payments until July 26, 2019. The bankruptcy
court dismissed  his  Chapter  13  case  because  he  failed  to  make  the  scheduled  payments
twice.  The   court order dismissing   the  Chapter 13   case   stated   that   the   “Debtor failed  to
cure the  default in  payments under the Debtor’s plan.” (GE 7, pgs. 24, 25, and 37) I note
that Applicant repeatedly  testified  at  his hearing  that he  did not know why  the  bankruptcy
judge dismissed his Chapter 13 case.  (Tr. 72-74)
The Chapter 13 Trustee’s Final Report and Account, from November 2019 (GE 7),
shows that Applicant paid about $62,000 into the reorganization plan, and was refunded
over  $10,000.  The  only  creditors  that  received  any  money  were  the  mortgage  holder
($38,426);  the  HOA  ($3,377);  the  IRS  ($231);  and  Applicant’s  bankruptcy  attorney
($6,050).  There  were  12  additional  creditors  included  in  the  bankruptcy  schedule  that
received  no  payments  from  the  Chapter  13  trustee,  including  a  state  child  support
enforcement agency. The remaining creditors’ claims totaled close to $52,000.
After the  dismissal of  his Chapter 13  case  in  July  2019, Applicant did not contact
any   of   his  creditors,  and   he   made   no   payments  toward  his  delinquent  debts.  At  his
hearing,  he   testified   that  since   2019   he   has  received   no   correspondence   or  collection
notices  from  any  of  his creditors. Only  one  of his creditors provided  him  with  an  IRS  1099-
C (cancellation  of debt). (Tr.  60)  Although  he  did  not pay  his delinquent  debts, and  his
Chapter  13   case   was  dismissed,  Applicant   believes  he   owes  no   money   to   any   of   the
bankruptcy-scheduled  creditors.  The  credit reports no  longer list the  bankruptcy  creditors.
He claimed  he  does  not know   what happened  to  his  unpaid delinquent debts  after the
Chapter 13  dismissal. (Tr. 59-60)  He presented  no  evidence  of  any  payments made  to
any  of  the  bankruptcy  creditors, except for the  child  support payments and  the  alimony
payments being garnished  from his paycheck.
Applicant  described  his  current  financial  situation  as  “fantastic”.  He  noted  he  is
getting caught up with his finances. (Tr. 32-33) He recently paid up his entire child support
obligation in arrears. (AE 8) Both children are now emancipated, and he no longer has a
legal financial obligation toward the children. He owes about $20,000 in alimony to his ex-
wife that he is paying via a $1,000-a-month garnishment of wages.
Applicant’s personal financial statement (AE 6) indicates he owns six vehicles with
an aggregate value of over $110,000. He purchased a used 2019 Tundra for $52,000 in
2021. He has no money in his savings account and only about $1,600  in his checking
account. He has about $30,000 in his 401K retirement account, but he took a $16,000
loan against his retirement account to pay off a debt to his ex-wife.
Applicant presented no documentary evidence of any contacts with his bankruptcy
creditors,  of  any  settlements  made,  of  payment  agreements  established,  or  of  any
payments made after the Chapter 13 case dismissal or after receipt of the SOR. Other
than the financial counseling required for his Chapter 13 filing in 2016, he presented no
evidence showing that he has participated in any recent financial counseling. His personal
financial statement shows a net remainder of $3,060 a month.
Applicant claimed that he takes his responsibilities as a security clearance holder
very seriously. He noted that he has had a clearance since age 19. He considers himself
to be a trustworthy person who pays his bills and does his job.
