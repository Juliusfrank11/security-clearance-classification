Applicant is a 40-year-old employee of a government contractor for whom she has
worked  since  December  2019.  She  was  unemployed  from  December  2009  until  July
2012,  from  December  2014  until  July  2018,  and  from  April  2019  until  she  began  her
current employment. There is no evidence in the record of her education level. She has
not attended school since 2010, at the latest. She has been married to her current spouse
since October 2011, after divorcing her former spouse earlier that same year. She has
two children, ages 12 and 6. (Items 2, 4, 5)
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant  owed  two  delinquent  student  loans  totaling  about
$81,000  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b).  The  SOR  also  alleged  that  Applicant’s  wages  were
garnished at Employer A in about October 2019 (SOR ¶ 1.c). Despite listing these issues
on the Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) she submitted in January
2020, and discussing them during her February 2020 security interview, she denied both
SOR  debts  in  the  Answer,  claiming  that  her  student  loans  are  not  delinquent  or  in
collections. She also denied that her wages were garnished in October  2019 or at any
time since then. (Items 2, 4-8)
The delinquent federal student loans totaling about $81,000 listed in SOR ¶¶ 1.a
and 1.b have not been resolved. Applicant began experiencing problems  paying these
loans in about 2010 because she did not have steady employment. From 2010 until 2019,
she  made  occasional,  irregular  payments  to  the  collection  agencies  that  serviced  her
loans after she defaulted on them. She entered into a rehabilitation program at some point
between  2017  and  2019,  but  stopped  making  payments  pursuant  to  this  rehabilitation
program in about July 2019. She provided documentary evidence that she entered into
another rehabilitation agreement with the servicer of her student loans in January 2021.
This date is over a year after she began her most recent employment, and about a year
after she submitted her SF 86 and had her security interview.
Pursuant  to  this 2021 rehabilitation  agreement,  Applicant  was  required  to  make
nine  monthly  payments  of  $571.  She  did  not  make  any  payments  pursuant  to  this
rehabilitation agreement as she subsequently learned that her loans had been deferred
in  March  2020  as  a  result  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  She  provided  documentary
evidence that, in May 2022, these loans were listed as being current on a credit report, in
forbearance until August 31, 2022, and no payment was due until August 31, 2022, at the
earliest. The reason for this status is the deferment period on student loan payments as
a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; not because Applicant made payments on the loans.
(Items 2, 4-8)
Once this deferment period ends, Applicant’s monthly payment on these loans will
be about $571. She claimed that she will have sufficient funds to make her student loan
payment  when  it  becomes  due,  and  provided  an  April  to  May  2022,  bank  account
statement showing a balance of about $800 to support her position. These student loans
are listed on her 2020, 2021, and 2022 credit reports. The 2021 and 2022 credit report
show  a  last  payment  date  of  March  2020  and  May  2022,  respectively.  These  dates
coincide with the beginning of the aforementioned COVID-19 deferment period and the
approximate time period that Applicant contacted the Department of Education about the
status of her loans. She has not claimed that she made any payments on these loans
since  July  2019.  These  loans  were  delinquent  when  the  COVID-19  deferment  period
began. (Items 2, 4-8)
In  October  2019,  after  receiving  a  letter  from  the  Department  of  Education,
Applicant learned that 15 percent of her wages would be garnished in order to satisfy her
aforementioned  student  loans.  She  provided  a  letter  from  Employer  B,  for  whom  she
began working in December 2019, stating that Employer B had never been served with a
garnishment order with respect to Applicant. Her employment with Employer B began two
months  after  she  was  put  on  notice  by  the Department of  Education  about  a  potential
garnishment.  While  there  is  evidence  in  the  record  that  the  Department  of  Education
threatened a wage garnishment, there is no evidence in the record that Applicant’s wages
with Employer A were actually garnished. (Items 2, 4-5)
Applicant provided a character reference letter from her employer’s security officer
stating that she is dedicated, diligent, shows leadership skills, and has been a valuable
asset  at  work.  Her  security  officer  also  stated  that  she  properly  handled  company
transactions and has been entrusted with training new employees. Applicant claimed that
now that she has her current job, she has enough money to meet her financial obligations
and  pay  her  student  loans  when  the  deferral  period  ends.  She  provided  documents
showing payments on her and her spouse’s other loans and expenses, as well as a credit
report,  to  show  that  she  was  current  on  other  financial  obligations.  She  provided  no
evidence that she sought or plans to seek financial counseling. She  did not respond to
the FORM, so more recent information about her finances is not available. (Item 2)
