Applicant is 30 years old and has a two-year-old daughter and sons who are five
and seven years old. He married in June 2011 and divorced in September 2014, and they
had  no  children  together.  He  remarried  in  June  2021,  and  she  is  the  mother  of  his
daughter.  He  received  a  high  school  diploma  in  2010.  He  is  currently  taking  college
courses toward a degree in business and leadership, and has completed approximately
84 college credits. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in October 2010, and served on active
duty until June 2018, when he was honorably discharged as an Aviation Machinist’s mate
second-class  petty  officer  (AM2).  He  has  worked  for  his  employer,  a  DoD  contractor,
since  November  2018.  After  at  least  two  promotions,  he  is  now  a  custom  facilities
specialist. He has held a secret security clearance since 2010. (Tr. 10-11, 30-40)
The  SOR  originally  alleged  that  Applicant  has  twelve  delinquent  debts  totaling
$37,721.  In  his  response,  he  indicated,  “I  admit”  to  each  of  the  SOR  allegations,  but
claimed  that  all  of  the  debts  were  “settled  and  paid.”  Therefore,  I  am  considering  his
answers to be de facto denials. He did not submit supporting documentation to support
his claims. (SOR, Answer, GE 5-7)
In Applicant’s August 2019 SCA, he disclosed two delinquent debts, one of which
was alleged in SOR as ¶ 1.j. He claimed he had resolved the unalleged debt and was
making payments toward the delinquent debt alleged as SOR ¶ 1.j. (GE 1 at 41-43)
In September 2019, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. His
overall  finances  were  discussed  as  well  as  all  of  the  debts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  He
indicated  his  ex-wife  incurred  several  debts  in  his  name  without  his  knowledge  and
authorization, during a deployment while serving in the Navy. He did not become aware
of the debts until he returned from the deployment. However, he also claimed that all of
the debts alleged in the SOR were due to his bank placing a fraud alert on his checking
account  while  he  was  deployed  between  July  2013  and  April  2014.  Prior  to  his
deployment, he  had  set  up auto  payments for his bills.  Because  of  the fraud alert,  his
account was frozen, and none of his creditors were paid. He did not find out about this
issue until he returned from his deployment. (GE 8)
Applicant  told  the  investigator  that  all  of  the  delinquent  debts  were  resolved
through payment arrangements. The investigator contacted Applicant multiple times and
either spoke to him or  left  voice messages for him between  September 14,  2019, and
March  5,  2020.  These  contacts  were  regarding  Applicant’s  finances  and  Applicant
providing documentation to support his claims that he had resolved or was resolving his
delinquent debts. He failed to provide documentation to the investigator. (GE 8)
The  $4,143  credit-card  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.a  remains  unresolved  despite
Applicant’s  assertion  that  he  settled  it. This account  was  opened  in  January 2017.  He
testified that it was opened to assist in the purchase of his motorcycle; however, as noted
below,  the  loan  for  his  motorcycle  was  opened  in  2014.  Regardless,  his  last  payment
toward  this  account  was  made  in  approximately  January  2019,  and  the  debt  was
ultimately charged off. He claimed he resolved it in 2020 or 2021, but failed to provide
substantiating documentation. (Answer; GE 4 at 6; GE 8; Tr. 56-57)
The $147 cable debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b remains unresolved despite Applicant’s
assertion that he settled it. The account was opened in April 2018, and the last payment
was made in September 2019. He failed to provide documentation to support his claim
that he paid this debt. (Answer; GE 4 at 6; GE 8; Tr. 57)
The $7,930 auto-related debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c was resolved in March 2022
through garnishment. Applicant testified that two months after he purchased the vehicle
in August 2015, it stopped working. Because he had a 90-day warranty, he ultimately,
returned  it  to  the  dealership;  however,  the  creditor  garnished  his  wages.  He  resumed
making voluntary payments, at an unrecalled date, and paid the remaining balance prior
to purchasing his home in March 2022. The documentary evidence reflects that Applicant
stopped making voluntary payments in May 2016, and the last garnishment was on March
15, 2022.  He could  not  recall how much he paid  to  resolve  this debt,  but  indicated he
would submit paperwork after the hearing with the relevant information. He did not submit
documentation. (Answer; GE 2 at 5; GE 3 at 4; GE 6 at 2; GE 8; Tr. 41-48, 52, 82-84)
The  $3,436  and  $1,531  federal  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.d  and  1.e  remain
unresolved  despite  Applicant’s  assertions  otherwise.  According  to  Applicant,  both  of
these debts were due to overpayments by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). He
testified that they were resolved in December 2021, after he requested the VA apply his
disability benefits to the debts. He was required to pay them before he could purchase
his home using his VA eligibility in March 2022. He indicated he had documentation to
support his claims that both of these debts were resolved; however, he failed to submit it.
(Answer; GE 3 at 3-4; GE 4 at 7; GE 8; Tr. 53-56)
The $128 auto-insurance debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f remains unresolved despite
Applicant’s assertion that he settled it. The account was opened in August 2016, and his
last payment was made in May 2019. He failed to provide documentation to support his
claim that he paid this debt. (Answer; GE 4 at 7; GE 8; Tr. 58)
The $127 utility debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g remains unresolved despite Applicant’s
assertion that he settled it. The account was opened in April 2018, and his last payment
was made in approximately August 2019. He failed to provide documentation to support
his claims that he paid this debt. (Answer; GE 4 at 7; GE 8; Tr. 58)
As reflected in the May 2022 credit report, Applicant settled the $3,656 personal-
loan debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.h. for less than the full balance.  At the hearing, he testified
that he resolved this debt through a payment arrangement, but he could not recall what
the payment agreement was, how much  he paid toward the debt, or what the monthly
payments were. He indicated he had paperwork to reflect this information, but failed to
provide it. (Answer; GE 2 at 6; GE 3 at 2-3; GE 4 at 8; GE 8; Tr. 51-53)
The  $1,258  personal  loan  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.i  remains  unresolved  despite
Applicant’s assertion that he settled it in 2020. The account was opened in February 2017,
and  his  last  payment  was  made  in  July  2019.  He  failed  to  provide  documentation  to
support his claim that he settled this debt with a third-party collection agency. (Answer;
GE 4 at 8; GE 8; Tr. 59)
The $9,650 motorcycle-loan deficiency alleged in SOR ¶ 1.j remains unresolved
despite Applicant’s assertion that he settled it in 2021. This account was opened in August
2014, and his last payment was made in July 2016. He testified that when his motorcycle
was stolen in 2017, he did not have insurance, and he was required to pay the remainder
of the loan. (Answer; GE 2 at 6; GE 3 at 3; GE 4 at 8; GE 8; Tr. 48-51)
The  $2,844  credit-card  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.k  remains  unresolved  despite
Applicant’s assertion that he settled it. The account was opened in August 2016, and his
last payment was made in May 2019. He failed to provide documentation to support his
claim that he paid this debt. (Answer; GE 4 at 8; GE 8; Tr. 59-60)
The  $1,795  credit-card  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.l  remains  unresolved  despite
Applicant’s assertion that he settled it in 2020. The account was opened in January 2016,
and  his  last  payment  was  made  in  July  2019.  He  failed  to  provide  documentation  to
support his claim that he paid this debt. (Answer; GE 4 at 9; GE 8; Tr. 60-61)
The  unalleged  debts  below  will  not  be  considered  disqualifying,  and  I  will  only
consider them in determining if the mitigating conditions are applicable and in my whole-
person analysis. See ISCR Case No. 20-01577 at 3 (App. Bd. June 6, 2022) (citing ISCR
Case  No.  03-20327 at 4  (App. Bd.  Oct.  26, 2006) (listing the  purposes for which  non-
alleged conduct can be considered)).
The unalleged $1,754 writ of garnishment remains unresolved despite Applicant’s
assertion that he resolved it in March 2022, prior to purchasing his home, as mentioned
below.  Sometime  between  2015  and  2018,  he  lived  at  an  apartment  managed  by  X
Property Management. At the hearing, he could not recall the specific dates he lived at
the  apartment.  While  living  there, he  was late  a  few  times with  his rent.  During  this time,
he   was  first   trying   to   “take   care   of  a   lot   of  the   debts  that  [he]   had   acquired   from   [his]
marriage.” He lived  in the  apartment with  the  mother of  his oldest son. After he  moved
out,  at an  unrecalled  date, X  Property  Management replaced  the  carpet due  to  damage
caused  by  Applicant.  His deposit was seized, and  the  balance  of  the  cost of  the  carpet
was also charged  to  Applicant. The  garnishment balance  decreased  from  $1,869  in June
2021  to $1,754  in  February  2022; therefore,  there is  some  evidence  of Applicant making
payments  toward this debt, as the balance has reduced over time. However, he failed  to
produce  documentation  that he  resolved  it in  March 2022, as  he  asserted.  (GE 5-6; Tr.
61-67, 82-83, 85-87)
The unalleged $14,712 writ of garnishment remains unresolved despite Applicant’s
assertion that he is currently making payments. He testified that he lived in an apartment
from May 2017 until September 2017. He moved out after he realized he could not afford
the $2,200 monthly rent. He unsuccessfully tried to break the lease, and the apartment
complex started  garnishing his wages  in  October 2017 for the  remainder of  the lease.
According  to  Applicant,  he  established  a  payment  arrangement  with  the  creditor  in
January  2022,  and  this  is  the  only  debt  that  remains  outstanding,  with  a  balance  of
$10,000. The documentary evidence reflects that the creditor renewed its garnishment in
May 2022. (GE 5-6; Tr. 67-71, 82, 85-87)
The $126 and $101 fines alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.o and 1.p relate to traffic offenses
that occurred in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Applicant testified that he paid both tickets
and would provide supporting documentation, but failed to do so. (GE 7; Tr. 72-73, 82)
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  testified  he  purchased  a  home  in  March  2022  for
$550,000.  He  used  his  Servicemen’s  Readjustment  Act  of  1944  (GI  Bill)  benefits  to
purchase the home. He argued that he qualified for financing, because he resolved the
debts alleged in the SOR. He testified that his divorce negatively affected his finances, as
his ex-wife abused her general Power of Attorney during his deployment in 2013 to 2014,
by taking loans and credit cards out in his name, including some of the SOR allegations.
Additionally, she overspent and failed to pay bills. She incurred approximately $14,000 of
debt in his name and took $10,000 of income he had saved. (Tr. 30, 78-80)
Applicant  is  current  on  the  child  support  obligations  for  his  oldest  son,  which  is
$715 monthly. He is not currently required to make payments for his younger son. His
wife maintains a written budget, but he did not provide a copy of it after the hearing. He
could not remember his annual salary. At the time of the hearing, he had between $4,000
and $5,000 in savings and approximately $26,000 in his 401(k). He has filed his state and
federal  income  tax  returns  and  has  no  tax-related  debt.  He  and  his  wife  are  currently
attempting  to  secure  a  financial  advisor.  He  has  not  disclosed  or  discussed  the  debts
alleged in the SOR with his supervisor or Facility Security Officer. (Tr. 33-34, 73-77, 88)
I held the record open, in part, to allow Applicant to submit his DD-214 and other
documentation  regarding the  awards  and  decorations  he  received  while  serving  in  the
Navy. He did not provide this documentation, but testified that he was named the Blue
Jacket  of  the  Quarter  while  stationed  onboard  an  aircraft  carrier,  Junior  Sailor  of  the
Quarter, and Junior Sailor of the Year at a shore command. He also received two Navy
Achievement Medals. He completed three full deployments and two smaller Pacific Rim
deployments aboard ships. He currently has a 75 percent disability rating related to his
military  service.  Since  he  started  working  for  his  current  employer,  he  has  received
promotions and “great evaluations each year.” (Tr. 36-37, 54-55, 91-92)
