In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  all  the  allegations  except  the
allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.g and 1.h, which he denied. His admissions are incorporated in
my findings of fact.
Applicant  is a  28-year-old  sheet metal worker employed  by a  federal contractor
since August 2017. He graduated from high school and  attended a community college
from August to December 2014 but did not receive a degree. He is unmarried and has no
children. He has never held a security clearance.
The  SOR  alleges  15  delinquent  debts  that  are  reflected  in  credit  reports  from
November 2018 (FORM Item 4), December 2019 (FORM Item 5), and June 2022 (FORM
Item 6). The evidence concerning the debts is summarized below.
SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.m,  1.n  and  1.o:  medical  debts  placed  for  collection  totaling
$20,495. In the February 2019 PSI, Applicant told an investigator that he was treated for
kidney stones in 2016 and 2017. He did not have medical insurance covering any of the
medical  debts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  He  provided  no  information  about  the  nature  and
circumstances of his other medical debts. He provided no evidence of efforts to resolve
them.
SOR ¶ 1.f: unsecured personal loan charged off for $287. In the February 2019
PSI, Applicant told an investigator that this loan became delinquent because he ignored
it. (FORM Item 3 at 6.) It is not resolved.
SOR  ¶¶   1.g   and   h: student loans   placed for  collection of  $961   and $1,280.
The  loans occurred  in  September 2012  and  were charged  off  and  referred  for collection
in March 2017. (FORM Item 5 at 2-3; FORM Item 6 at 3-4.) The last payments on both
loans were in February 2019. (FORM Item 5 at 2-3.) During the PSI in February 2019, he
told an investigator that the loans were satisfied by diversion of his 2018 federal income
tax refund. (FORM Item 3 at 3.) In his  answer to the SOR, he denied these debts and
asserted that they were satisfied by diversion of income tax refunds for three consecutive
years. He submitted no documentary evidence to support his assertions.
SOR ¶ 1.i: consumer debt placed for collection of $1,400. Applicant admitted
this debt but provided no evidence of efforts to resolve it.
SOR ¶¶ 1.j and k: consumer debts charged off for $253 and $5,963. During the
February 2019 PSI, Applicant acknowledged several debts incurred with a department
store, which are unresolved. (FORM Item 3 at 5-6.) He provided no evidence of efforts to
resolve these debts.
SOR ¶¶ 1.l and 1.n: telecommunications debts placed for collection of $2,206
and $1,179. Applicant admitted these debts but provided no evidence of efforts to resolve
them.
After the PSI in March 2019, Applicant provided materials from an online program
advising him which debts he should pay and in what order. His materials included advice
regarding  the  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.c,  1.f,  1.l,  1.m,  and  1.o.  He  provided  no
information about the nature of the advice or what actions, if any, he took to follow it. He
has provided no information about his current income and expenses.
