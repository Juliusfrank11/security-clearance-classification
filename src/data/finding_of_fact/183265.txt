Applicant  denied  all  the  allegations  in  SOR,  except  for  allegation  ¶  1.l.  After  a
thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  testimony,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  38-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  She  has  been
employed by the defense contractor since 2020. She has held a security clearance, off
and on, since joining the Navy at the age of 17. She is married a third time, and has one
adult child, and three children, by her second marriage. Applicant attributes her current
financial difficulties to the divorce from her second husband. (TR at page 12 line 21 to
page 15 line 14, at page 29 line 19 to page 30 line 30 line 6, at page 40 line 22 to page
41 line 9, and at page 42 line 14 to page 43 line 15.) She is receiving credit counseling.
(AppXs A and Q.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
1.a. Applicant denies that she has a past-due debt to Creditor A, as the result of
a  vehicle  repossession,  in the amount  of  about $28,874.  She avers  that  this debt was
covered  by  a  bankruptcy  filed  by  her  second  husband,  but  has  submitted  nothing  in
support  of  her  averment.  Applicant  also  admits  to  receiving  $6,500  as  a  part  of  this
transaction, which she used “to pay off debt . . . and . . . put money into savings.” (TR at
page 15 line 19 to page 17 line 6, at page 59 lines 7~23, and at page 77 lines 5~24.)
The Government’s June 2019 credit report (CR) does not support Applicant’s testimony,
but  shows  this  substantial  debt  is  still  past-due.  (GX  10  at  page  3.)  This  allegation  is
found against Applicant.
1.b. and 1.c. Applicant initially denied that she had past-due debts to Creditor B
in  an  amount  totaling  about  $8,525.  She  thought  these  debts  were  included  in  her
second  husband’s  bankruptcy,  but  discovered  that  they  still  appeared  on  her  credit
reports.  (GX  10  at  page  3  and  GX  12  at  page  6.)  Applicant  avers  she  is  making
“$250.00 [payments] every two weeks,” as corroborated by documentation. (TR at page
17 line 7 to page 18 line 10, and AppX J.) These allegations are found for Applicant.
1.d.  Applicant  denies  that  she  has a  past-due  debt  to  Creditor D, as the  result of
another vehicle  repossession, in the  amount of  about $2,741. Applicant avers that she
disputed  this debt; but has heard nothing  as a  result of  her dispute.  She  does admit  “it’s
been   charged   off.”  (TR  at  page   18   line   10   to   page   19   line   16,  and   at  page   60   lines
6~24.) As  this past-due  debt appears on  Applicant’s June  2019  CR; and  Applicant  has
offered  nothing  further  in this regard,  this allegation  is found  against Applicant.  (GX  10
at  page 4.)
1.e.   Applicant   denies  that  she   has   a   second   past-due   debt   to   Creditor  A   in  the
amount  of   about  $1,821.  She   avers  that  this  debt  may   have   been   covered   by   a
bankruptcy   filed   by   her  second   husband,   but  has   submitted   nothing   in  support  of  her
averment.  (TR at page  19  line  17  to  page  20  line  14, and  at  page 61  lines 1~23.) As  this
past-due   debt   appears  on   Applicant’s  June   2019   CR,  this  allegation   is   found   against
Applicant. (GX 10  at page 4.)
1.f. Applicant denies that she has a past-due debt to Creditor F in the amount of
about $1,810. Applicant avers that she “could not find any information on this debt.” (TR
at  page  20  line  15  to  page  21  line  19.)  As  this  past-due  debt  appears  on  Applicant’s
June 2019 CR, this allegation is found against Applicant. (GX 10 at page 4.)
1.g.  Applicant   initially   denied   that   she   had   a   past-due   debt   to   Creditor  G   in  an
amount totaling about $39. She  avers that she “paid that  debt in full,” as corroborated by
documentation.  (TR  at page 21  line  20  to page  22  line  6,  and  AppX K.) This  allegation  is
found  for Applicant.
1.h. Applicant denies that she  has a  past-due  debt to  Creditor H in the  amount of
about $2,759. Applicant avers that she  is “unaware if it’s on  .  .  . [her] Credit  Report.” (TR
at page  22  line  6  to  page  23  line  3, and  at page  61  line  24  to  page  63  line  14.) As this
past-due   debt  appears  as   a   collection   account   on   Applicant’s  June   2019   CR,  this
allegation is found against Applicant. (GX 10  at page 11.)
1.i.  Applicant  denies  that  she  has  a  second  past-due  debt  to  Creditor  G  in  the
amount of about $2,496. Applicant avers, “that was another account that I had with my
husband. It was charged off for him with his Bankruptcy, I’m assuming.” (TR at page 23
lines 4~13.) On cross-examination, Applicant admits that “part of the debt is” her’s. (TR
at  page  63  line  15  to  page  64  line  14.)  As  this  past-due  debt  appears  as  a  collection
account on Applicant’s June 2019 CR, this allegation is found against Applicant. (GX 10
at page 11.)
1.j. Applicant denies that she  has a  past-due  debt to  Creditor J in the  amount  of
about $1,338.  Applicant avers “this was another account that  I had  in my  marriage  . . .
and   it   was  charged   off,  I’m   assuming,  with   his  Bankruptcy.  But,   it’s   no   longer  on   [her]
Credit Report.” (TR at page  23  lines 14~25, and  at page  64  line  15  to  page  65  line  17.)
As this past-due  debt appears as a collection account on Applicant’s June 2019 CR, this
allegation is found against Applicant. (GX 10  at page 11.)
1.k.  and  1.n.  Applicant initially  denied  that she  had two  past-due debts to  Creditor
K   in  an   amount  totaling   about  $1,113.  She   has  contacted   this   creditor,  and   is  in
compliance  with  a  payment plan agreed to  with  said  creditor. (TR at page  25  lines  1~24,
and  AppX L.) These allegations are  found  for Applicant.
1.l.  Applicant  initially   denied   that   she   had   a   past-due   debt  to   Creditor  L   in   an
amount  totaling about $628. She  has contacted this creditor, a  nd  is in  compliance  with a
payment   plan   agreed   to   with   said  creditor.  (TR  at  page   26   lines  1~22,  and   AppX   B.)
This allegation  is  found for Applicant.
1.m. Applicant denies that she has a past-due debt to Creditor M in the amount
of  about $265. Applicant avers “that account is closed  off, and  I don’t owe  anything on
that debt.” (TR at page 26 line 23 to page 27 line 6, and at page 65 line 18 to page 66
line 3.) As this past-due debt appears as a collection account on Applicant’s June 2019
CR, this allegation is found against Applicant. (GX 10 at page 12.)
1.n. Has been discussed, above, with 1.k.
1.o. Applicant denies that she has a past-due debt to Creditor O in the amount of
about $119.  Applicant avers “it’s paid  off.” (TR  at  page  27  lines 7~18,  and  at page  66
lines  4~23.)  As  this  past-due  debt  appears  on  Applicant’s  June  2019  CR;  and  no
supporting  documentation  has  been  submitted,  this  allegation  is  found  against
Applicant. (GX 10 at page 13.)
1.p.   Applicant   initially   denied   that  she   had   a   past-due   debt  to   Creditor  P   in   an
amount  totaling  about $111. She  has contacted  this creditor, and  settled  and  paid said
debt  for $89.  (TR  at  page  27  line  19  to  page  28  line  5, and  AppX  N.) This allegation  is
found  for Applicant.
1.q.  Applicant   initially   denied   that   she   had   a   past-due   debt   to   Creditor  Q   in  an
amount  totaling  about $611. She  has  contacted  this creditor, and  paid this debt.  (TR  at
page 28 lines 6~14, and AppX N.) This allegation is found  for Applicant.
1.r.  Applicant  initially  denied   that  she   was  in  arrears  with   her   child   support
payments  in  an   amount  totaling   about  $54,240.  She   has   submitted   evidence   showing
payments  of   $253   every   two   weeks  towards   her  arrearage.  (TR  at   page   28   line   15   to
page 29 line  3, and  AppX P.) This allegation is found  for Applicant.
Guideline E  - Personal Conduct
2.a.   On   February   9,  2015,  Applicant  received   Non-Judicial  Punishment  (Article
15) for violating  Articles 92  (Mutiny  and  Sedition), 17  (False  Official Statements), 123a
(Making,  Drawing   or  Uttering   Check,   or  Order  without  Sufficient  Funds),  and   134
(General  Articles)  of   the   Uniform   Code   of   Military   Justice   (UCMJ).  (GX   7.)  Applicant
avers that she  was never given,  or sought,  legal counsel prior to  accepting  punishment
as  a   result  of  the   Article  15.   (TR at  page   78   line   7   to   page   80   line   16.)  As   a   result  of
accepting   Article  15   punishment,   Applicant   was  reduced   in  rank  to   an   “E-5   and
recommended  for Administrative Separation” from the Navy.
I  find  that  Applicant  falsified  “Section  15  –  Military  History  –  Discipline  –  In  the
last  7  years”  of  her May 25, 2019  e-QIP  by answering  “No,” in light of  her February  9,
2015 Article 15, noted above.
2.b.   Applicant   falsely   told  her   DoD  investigator  that  when   she   “told  .   .   .   [her]
commander about  .  .  .   [her] financial  difficulties  .  .  .  the   commander filed  for the” non-
judicial  punishment.   As  noted   above   under  2.a.,   the   reason   for  her  non-judicial
punishment also involved  allegations of  Mutiny  and  Sedition, and  making  False  Official
Statements. (TR at page 26 line 3 to page 27 line 6, and at page 65 line 18 to page 66
line 3.) I find this to be a willful falsification.
