In  Applicant’s  answer to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  the  allegations in  SOR ¶¶  1.a  and
1.d  and  denied  the  allegations in  SOR ¶¶  1.b  and  1.e.  His  admissions are  incorporated
in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 57-year-old network operations supervisor employed by a defense
contractor since November 2008. He served in the Army National Guard from June 1989
to May 2005 and received an honorable discharge.  He receives disability pay of about
$958 per month for a 50% service-connected disability. (Tr-1 at 36.) He married in June
1994 and has two adult children. He has received a security clearance in June 2010.
The SOR alleges failure to file a federal income tax return for 2018 as required and
pay  the  taxes  due.  It  also  alleges  a  delinquent  personal  loan,  a  delinquent  credit-card
account, and a debt for a motorcycle purchase. The four delinquent consumer debts are
reflected in credit reports from January, September, and June 2020 (GX 2, 3, and 4.) The
evidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below.
SOR ¶ 1.a: failure to file a federal income tax return for 2018 and failure to
pay about $5,500 in federal taxes due for 2018. When Applicant submitted his SCA in
September 2019, he attributed his failure to timely file his tax return to “illnesses.” (GX 1
at  30.)  When  a  security  investigator  interviewed  him  in  January  2020,  he  told  the
investigator that he hired someone to file his tax returns, but the person took his money
and did not file the returns. He told the investigator that a lawsuit against the tax preparer
was pending (GX 5 at 3.) He repeated this explanation at the first hearing. (Tr-1 at 88.)
He hired another tax preparer and filed his 2018 return in September 2022. It reflected
that he owed $3,696, and he made a $50 payment. (AX H; AX I.) There is no evidence
that the 2018 return had been accepted or processed as of the date of the hearing before
me.
Applicant testified that he is waiting to see if the IRS accepts his $50 payment. He
provided no evidence that he has requested a payment plan with the IRS. Instead, he is
passively waiting to see how the IRS responds to his token payment. He asserted that he
is willing to pay whatever the IRS asks him to pay. He testified he is able to pay the full
amount, but he has other matters that require his attention and he wants to give himself
“some financial leeway.” (Tr-2 at 21.)
Applicant  testified  that  he  received  a  letter  two  days  before  the  second  hearing
informing  him  that  he  owes  about  $1,800  for  tax  year  2020.  (Tr-2  at  25.)  Later  in  the
hearing, he testified that he had just received a letter from the IRS informing him that he
owed $2,300 for tax year 2020. (Tr-2 at 48.) He also testified that he had recently obtained
a home-equity loan for $46,000 that he intended to use to pay all his debts. (Tr-2 at 53.)
In  October  2022,  Applicant  paid  $2,390  for  his  2020  federal  income  taxes  and
$1,892 for his 2021 federal income taxes. (AX P.) The taxes due for these two years have
been paid in full. As of the date the record closed, he had not made any more payments
on his 2018 taxes and did not have a payment agreement for that year’s taxes.  His tax
debt for 2018 is not resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.b: past-due debt of $6,034 for a solar panel system. Applicant initially
did  not  recognize  this  debt  because  the  vendor  has  the  same  name  as  a  well-known
automobile  manufacturer.  He  disputed  the  debt  because  the  installation  of  the  solar
panels was faulty and resulted in roof leaks. In September 2022, he resolved the debt on
favorable terms. (AX L; AX M.)
SOR  ¶  1.c:  unsecured  personal  loan  charged  off  for  $25,979.  This  debt
originated as a five-year personal loan for $30,000. Applicant testified that he obtained
this loan in 2012 and paid approximately $700 per month for about four years. (Tr-1 at
62; Tr-2 at 35.) He used this loan to finance a vacation trip overseas in June 2014 and “a
little bit of extra savings.” (GX 1 at 24; Tr-1 at 63.) When a security investigator interviewed
him  in  February  2020,  he  told  the  investigator  that  he  disputed  the  debt  and  it  was
“dropped” by the creditor. (GX 5 at 2.)
At the first hearing, Applicant testified that he contacted the creditor because he
received a bill reflecting a balance that he thought was incorrect. He called the creditor
but the agent he spoke to simply transferred him to another agent, and no one could verify
the  amount  due.  He  testified  that  the  law  firm  assisting  him  with  his  debts  asked  the
creditor to verify the amount but without success. He was unable to produce a copy of the
letter from his law firm to the creditor. (Tr-1 at 64-65.) He admitted that he had not paid
the debt in full and that he probably owes about $5,000. (Tr-1 at 67-71.)
At the second hearing, Applicant testified that he thought he paid a lump sum to
settle the debt, but he was not sure. (Tr-2 at 40. The January 2020 credit report reflected
that the account was closed by the grantor and charged off in January 2015. (GX 2 at 6).
The debt is not reflected on the credit reports from June 2020 and September 2020 (GX
3 and 4.). He believes that his law firm resolved the debt. (Tr-2 at 41.) He did not produce
any documents supporting his dispute or showing resolution of his dispute.
SOR ¶ 1.d: credit-card account charged off for $12,804. This debt was reflected
in the January 2020 credit report as charged off and closed by the grantor in August 2016.
(GX 2 at 6.) It is not reflected on the credit reports from June 2020 and September 2020.
Applicant disputed the amount due on this account at the same time he disputed the debt
in SOR ¶ 1.c. (Tr-1 at 75.) SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.c involve the same creditor, a credit union.
He  submitted  no  documents  supporting  his  dispute  and  no  documents  reflecting  the
resolution of this debt. (Tr-2-at 44.)
SOR ¶ 1.e: debt for purchase of a motorcycle placed for collection of $1,791.
In July 2021, Applicant resolved this debt by trading in the motorcycle for which the debt
was due on a new motorcycle. He received $5,000 for trading in the old motorcycle, paid
$8,000 in cash, and financed the balance of $13,792. (AX J, AX K, AX N, and AX O.)
Applicant’s mother was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer in 2014, and over the
next several years, went through chemotherapy and brain radiation, developed dementia,
and contracted COVID. When she was first diagnosed, she was expected to live for six
months, but she survived for six years. She moved in with Applicant in the summer of
2015.  Applicant  incurred  uninsured  expenses  for  treatment,  medical  equipment,  and
home attendants. He frequently lost time at work caring for her. His SCA reflects multiple
medical expenses that he disputed. (GX 1 at 33-37.) He disclosed in his SCA that he fell
behind  on  his  home  mortgage  payments  totaling  $2,800.  (GX  1  at  32-33.)  When  his
mother passed away in December 2020, he incurred about $8,000 in funeral and burial
expenses. (AX G; Tr-1 at 40-44.)
