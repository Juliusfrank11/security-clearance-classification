1.e)

his  Federal  income  tax  returns,  but  was  unable  to  pay  the  taxes  owed.  His  payment
plan with the IRS covers all three years alleged. He did not know how much he currently
owes the IRS. He filed his 2019 and 2020 Federal income tax returns on time, and owes

when  he  met with  his financial counselor, his counselor told him  that “because  of  [his]
credit  scores”  it  would  take  “about  a  year”  to  refinance  his  home.  He  stated  that  his
house is worth $500,000 and he owes $340,000 on his mortgage. (Tr. 29-31) Applicant
