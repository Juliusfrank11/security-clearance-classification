Applicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for
her  current  employer  since  June  2017.  She  served  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  military
from  2010  until  she  was  honorably  discharged  in  2015.  She  has  a  bachelor’s  degree
earned in 2005 and a master’s degree earned in 2007. She is married with two children.

Applicant’s  husband  had  a  good  job  in  2015.  They  felt  their  finances  permitted
her to leave the military, start her own business, and home school their children. Shortly
after her discharge, her husband was in a serious motorcycle accident involving multiple
surgeries  and  time  off  work.  He  did  not  lose  his  salary,  but  his  income  was  largely
commission-based, so it was greatly reduced. Not all medical bills were covered in the
settlement  they  eventually  received.  Applicant  bought  into  the  fitness  industry,  which
she financed at least in part with a loan from a credit union. Her husband was laid off in
2016, and unemployed for a period until he obtained a lower-paying job. Her business
was  ultimately  unsuccessful,  but  they  had  contracts  to  fulfill,  so  they  stayed  until  they
could honor all of their contracts. (Tr. at 16-20, 33-37; GE 1, 2; AE A, A(5))
Applicant  and  her  husband  did  what  they  could  to  avoid  bankruptcy  and  losing
their  house  to  foreclosure.  They  worked  to  bring  other  debts  current,  including  her
student loans, an auto loan, and the mortgage. They were able to sell their house for a
small profit. They decided that she would have to get a job. She accepted her current
job  and  moved  to  an  area  with  a  lower  cost  of  living.  Her  husband  followed  and
eventually found employment. (Tr. at 18-21, 38, 47; GE 1, 2; AE A, A(3))
The SOR alleges $43,868 owed on the defaulted loan to the credit union (SOR ¶
1.a) and four delinquent medical debts totaling about $3,650 (SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.e).
Applicant talked to the credit union about the $43,868 defaulted loan  on several
occasions  in  2016  and  2017.  She  stated  that  the  credit  union  would  only  accept
payments of $2,000 per month, which she could not afford. She was told that the credit
union  was  charging  off  the  debt.  Applicant  did  not  contact  the  credit  union  after 2017,
because  she thought when  they charged  the  debt off,  that meant they were  no  longer
interested in collecting the debt. (Tr. at 21-23, 27, 38-40; GE 1-5; AE A)
Applicant  testified  that  she  thought  the  four  medical  debts  were  eventually
resolved  by  payments  from  the  settlement  or  by  the  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs
(VA). The debts are listed on the 2020 combined credit report. One debt was reported
by all three credit reporting agencies; two debts were reported by both TransUnion and
Equifax; and one debt was just reported by TransUnion.  Two debts were listed on the
November  2020  Equifax  credit  report.  There  were  no  medical  debts  listed  on  the
January  2022  Equifax  credit  report.  (Tr.  at  17-18,  39,  44-46;  Applicant’s  response  to
SOR; GE 1-5; AE A, A(4))
Applicant’s  finances  have  stabilized.  She  and  her  husband  maintain  a  budget.
Her annual salary is about $115,000, plus a bonus of about $3,000. Her husband earns
about  $50,000  to  $60,000  annually.  She  has  about  $50,000  in  her  401(k)  retirement
account.  She  and  her  husband  bought  a  home  in  their  current  location  in  about  April
2020, financed with a mortgage loan of about $306,000. They bought a new vehicle in
about  November  2020,  financed  with  an  auto  loan  of  about  $54,800.  Their  monthly
payment  is  $893.  Applicant  has  student  loans.  They  have  been  current  for  several
years, but they have grown from about $52,000 to about $77,000. They are  apparently
on  pause  as  part  of  COVID  relief.  (Tr.  at  21,  24-26,  31-33,  38,  41-44;  GE  1-5;  AE  A,

After the hearing, Applicant contacted the credit union for the $43,868 defaulted
credit union loan. Their best settlement offer was $15,384. She stated that she does not
have  the  savings  to  pay  that  amount  at  this  time.  She  and  her  husband  discussed
borrowing the money from a few different sources, however they “do not feeling putting
[their] family in more debt is in spirit with what the government has asked in this case.”
