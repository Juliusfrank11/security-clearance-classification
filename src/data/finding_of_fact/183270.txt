Financial Considerations
The  SOR  lists  two  allegations  under  this  concern;  SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  Applicant
failed to timely file Federal income returns for at least tax years 2010, 2016, 2017, and
2018; and SOR ¶¶ 1.b alleges Applicant failed to timely file his state income tax returns
for at least tax years 2010, 2016, 2017, and 2018.
These  allegations  are  established  by  Applicant’s  August  21,  2018  SF-86;  his
Office of Personnel Management (OPM) Report of Investigation conducted from March
4,  2019  to  April  7,  2019,  to  include  his  April  4,  2019  OPM  Personal  Subject  Interview
(PSI);  his  March  8,  2020  DOHA  Response  to  Interrogatories;  and  his  June  26,  2020
SOR Answer. (GE 1-3; SOR Answer)
In his April 4, 2019 OPM PSI and during his testimony, Applicant stated that he
could  not  recall  for  what  years  he  failed  to  file  his  taxes.  He  went  to  the  IRS,  date
unspecified, and they informed him he did not owe any taxes, but advised him to file his
tax  returns  in  order  to  get  refunds  due  him.  The  reason  he  did  not  file  his  tax  returns
was  because  he  did  not  know  how  to.  Friends  or  family  members  always  filed  his
returns  for  him  by  taking  his  W-2  forms  to  accountants.  Applicant  stated  he  is  not
knowledgeable  about  taxes.  “Even  the  IRS  guy  told  him  that  (the)  IRS  owes  him  a
refund.” (Tr. 30-34; GE 2, GE 3) Applicant began working on clearing up his delinquent
tax returns “since [he] started [his] job – before that” in 2018. (Tr. 47-48)
SOR  ¶  1.a:  Failed  to  timely  file  Federal  income  tax  for  at  least  tax  years
2010, 2016, 2017, and 2018. Applicant admitted this allegation in his SOR Answer.
Applicant submitted documentation that he filed his 2010, 2016, 2017, and 2019
Federal income returns with his SOR Answer, and was eligible for refunds for all years
filed.  (SOR  Answer; Tr.  21-22,  53-54; AE  B, AE  C,  AE  D,  AE  N) His  2018  return  was
timely  filed  on  April  10,  2019,  before  the  April  15,  2019  deadline.  He  also  received  a
refund  for  his  2018  return.  Although  not  alleged,  Applicant  submitted  documentation
with  his  SOR  Answer  that  his  2019  Federal  income  tax  return  was  timely  filed.  (SOR
Answer; Tr. 22, 41-42, 53-54; AE E) Applicant timely filed his 2020 Federal income tax
return, owed money to the IRS, and tried to set up a payment plan. He was unsure how
much he owed  stating, “It was a  thousand something,” and paid the entire amount due
online.  (Tr.  45)  To  the  best  of  his  knowledge,  Applicant  does  not  owe  the  IRS  any
delinquent taxes, penalties, or interest. (Tr. 46)
During his testimony, Applicant elaborated on why he failed to timely file his tax
returns.  At  the  time  he  was  required  to  file  his  2010  return,  he  was  unemployed  from
December  2010  to  December  2011,  and  responsible  for  supporting  his  mother  and
brother. His mother was ill from cancer, and recently passed away.  Applicant received
unemployment benefits for “about four months.” His focus was on supporting his mother
and brother, and earning income. (Tr. 22-24, 27, 35, 39; GE 1)
Applicant further stated that in summer 2017, he sustained a severe head injury
in a motorcycle accident. The accident incapacitated him, and he was unable to file his
2016 and 2017 returns. He stated, “It was devastating. It wiped me out. I lost everything
and half of my memory.” He has difficulty remembers names and dates. (Tr. 25-27, 35-
38,  41) (Note  –  During his testimony,  it  became  clear that  Applicant  had  difficulty  with
his  memory,  especially  when  it  came  to  recalling  dates.)  And,  in  January  2019,  he
sustained  a  severe  knee  injury  that  required  surgery.  His  Workman’s  Compensation
claim was delayed, and he was unable to pay his rent and meet his expenses leading to
his being evicted from his apartment. He stated, “The knee surgery . . . occurred at my
current  position  and,  again,  wiped  me  out.  I  lost  literally  everything  –  photo  albums,
apartment,  motorcycle,  everything.”  (Tr.  24-25,  35.  50;  AE  H  AE  I)  ALLEGATION
RESOLVED.
SOR ¶ 1.b: Failed to timely file his state income returns for at least tax years
2010, 2016, 2017, and 2018.
Applicant  admitted  this  allegation  in  his  SOR  Answer.  (SOR  Answer)  Applicant
submitted  documentation  that  he  filed  his  2010,  2016,  2017,  and  2019  state  income
returns, and was eligible for refunds for all years filed. (SOR Answer; Tr. 21-22, 29, 53-
54;  AE  C,  AE  D,  AE N) His  2018  return  was  timely filed  on  April 10,  2019,  before the
April  15,  2019  deadline.  He  also  received  a  refund  for  tax  year  2018.  Although  not
alleged, Applicant submitted documentation with his Answer that his 2019 state income
tax  return  was  timely  filed.  (SOR  Answer;  Tr.  22,  41-42,53-54;  AE  E)  ALLEGATION
RESOLVED.
Applicant stated that as a result of this experience, he takes the responsibility of
filing  his tax  returns  more  seriously,  especially  with  the  requirement  of  maintaining his
clearance. In 2010, he had a “custom painter’s mentality of bouncing around from job to
job trying to make as much money as possible instead of being more responsible with a
9:00 to 5:00 and seeing the benefits of long-term employment and a more conservative
simple  lifestyle.”  (Tr.  28)  He  added  that  he  does  not  travel,  date,  or  go  out  anymore.
“Literally nothing. All I do is focus on taking care of these issues that I already admitted I
had before I received the SOR. I was already working on them.” (Tr. 28-29)
Applicant  self-reported  his  late  tax  filings  to  his  Facility  Security  Officer  (FSO),
who  gave  him  “a  list  of items  to  take  care of.” (Tr.  29)  Going forward, Applicant meets
his tax filing deadlines by “preparing for them the year before, just like last year’s taxes.”
(Tr. 29) He stated that he has “developed a friendship with the manager over at [his tax
preparer]  and  I  have  an  accountant  on  call  that  would  help  me  prepare  last  year’s
taxes.” (Tr. 30, 43-44, 48) Applicant’s financial situation has improved over the past two
years. He has been able to remain in his current residence since 2020 and is current on
all of  his monthly bills.  He  has  opened  a 401(k) and  a  Roth  IRA. (Tr. 49-50) Although
not alleged, Applicant provided documentation evidencing that he researched and paid
some outstanding parking tickets dating back to around 2004. (Tr. 50-53; AE H)
Character Evidence
Applicant stated that he is a “master painter.” The career progression of painters
is apprentice, journeyman, and pro-painter. A master painter “tell(s) the paint companies
what  to  make  or  they  hand  them  recipes  to  produce  or,  in  my  case,  the  military
Government  –  how  to  correct  flawed  paint  systems  on  their  aircraft.”  (Tr.  25-26)
Applicant  identified the  numerous  types  of military aircraft  he  has painted. Suffice  it  to
say, the list is quite exhaustive. (Tr. 26) As a Government contractor master painter, he
is paid $40 per hour. (Tr. 26)
Applicant  submitted  two  reference  letters:  (1)  from  his  paint  shop  supervisor
(PSS);  and  (2)  a  fellow  aircraft  painter  (AP)  coworker.  PSS  stated  that  in  the  last  two
years Applicant has proven to be one of his outstanding employees, describing him as a
team player, willing to give a helping hand, and works with very limited supervision. He
added that Applicant is always punctual and is a pleasure to have  him in his shop. AP
has  known  Applicant  for four years stating he  is best  known for his honesty and  deep
respect  for  others.  He  is  a  subject  matter  expert  in  his  craft  and  helped  him  transition
from  his  last  job  to  his  present  job.  AP  further  described  Applicant  as  honest  and
respectful  and  is  glad  to  have  him  working  by  his  side  day  in  and  day  out.  (AE  F)
Applicant  submitted  ten  professional  certificates  documenting  training  he  has  received
since beginning his current job. (AE J)
Applicant’s
resume  not  only  documents  his  professional  work-related
accomplishments,  but  also  documents  his  talent  as  an  artist  in  a  non-military  setting
before  he  began  his  current  employment  for  a  Government  contractor.  (AE  K)  He
submitted a photograph of him painting at a nationally recognized county fair where he
invented an art form. Applicant stated, “[he] was the guy from TV that does the painting
in  three  minutes  to  music.”  For  that  event,  he  won  that  county  fair’s  “Best  in  Show”
award.  (Tr.  54-55;  AE  L)  Applicant  has  shown  his  art  work  on  numerous  television
shows,  had  his  art  work  displayed  in  national  art  museums,  has  been  featured  in
nationally recognized magazines, and has done custom  paint jobs on motorcycles and
automobiles  for  celebrities.  Because  of  the  nature  of  his  work,  Applicant  has  lived  in
various places around the country and was unable to establish roots.  (SOR Answer)
Applicant  submitted  ten  samples  of  his  artwork  to  include  a  custom  motorcycle
paint job he did for the photographer of well-known motorcycle magazine, a very colorful
painting depicting sea life that the U.S. State Department commissioned him to paint for
a  Middle  Eastern  prince,  a  painting  of  a  tiger  that  “is  a  recreation  of  the  black  slate
technique  .  .  .  [i]t’s  very  hard  to  master,”  and  a  photograph  of  him  painting  a  dome
ceiling  he  was  commissioned  to  paint  in  a  prestigious  art  museum.  Although  not
described  on  the  record,  the  remaining  pictures  depicting  his  art  work  were  equally
impressive.  (Tr.  55-56;  AE  M)  Applicant  stated  that  these  are  the same  skills  he  used
when  he  paints jets,  adding, “It is literally the  only thing I’m  good  at.  Sorry to  say.” (Tr.
56)
