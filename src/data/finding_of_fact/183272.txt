In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, she admitted all the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-
1.i under Guideline F, but she asserted that the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.g and 1.i were
paid in full and that she had established a payment plan for the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f.
She  did not  expressly admit  or deny the  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  2.a that  she falsified her
SCA. However, she claimed that she did not intend to falsify or withhold information. I
have treated her response to SOR ¶ 2.a as a denial. Her admissions are incorporated in
my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 43-year-old travel specialist employed by a federal contractor since
March 2018. She worked for other federal contractors from November 2004 until she was
hired by her current employer. She has taken college courses but does not have a degree.
She married in April 2014 and has no children. She has never held a security clearance.
The SOR alleges nine delinquent debts reflected in credit reports from May 2018
(Exhibit  7),  June  2020  (Exhibit  8) and  May  2022  (Exhibit  9). The evidence  concerning
these debts is summarized below.
SOR ¶ 1.a: auto lease past due for $4,738, with a balance of $43,268. In the
PSI, Applicant denied owning an auto from this manufacturer and stated that she intended
to dispute the debt. (Exhibit 6 at 3.) In her answer to the SOR, she admitted the debt and
stated that she was in contact with the creditor, but she provided no information about the
status  of  the  debt. The  May  2020  credit  report  reflects  that  the  debt  is a  joint  account
opened  in  August  2017,  with  the  last  activity  in  September  2017.  (Exhibit  8  at  3.)  For
reasons not reflected in the record, the debt is not listed in the May 2022 credit report.
SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.e: four student loans placed for collection of $14,229; $5,961;
$5,832; and $3,786. The credit report from May 2018 reflected three student loans. One
was opened in October 2007 with a balance of $17,574. A second was opened in March
2011  for  $5,188.  A  third  was  opened  in  March  2011  for  $3,441.  All  three  loans  were
reflected as current on the March 2018 credit report. (Exhibit 7.)
The June 2020 credit report reflected that all three loans had been transferred to
the U.S. Government after being past due for 120 days or more. (Exhibit 8.) The credit
report from May 2022 reflected that the loans for $14,229 and $5,832 were consolidated
direct  loans,  and  the  loans  for  $5,961  and  $3,786  were  direct  loans.  All  loans  were
referred for collection. (Exhibit 8.)
In  the  PSI,  Applicant  stated  that  she  intended  to  consolidate  her student  loans.
(Exhibit  6  at  3.)  In  her  answer  to  the  SOR,  she  stated  that  she  intended  to  make
arrangements to resolve all of her delinquent student loans. Collection of payments on
the loans is paused under the CARES Act until December 31, 2022.
SOR ¶ 1.f: medical debt placed for collection of $1,681. In Applicant’s answer
to the SOR, she stated that she had established a payment plan providing for payments
of $60 per month for 26 months. She attached a receipt to her answer reflecting a $100
payment on January 3, 2022.
SOR ¶ 1.g: medical debt placed for collection of $1,661. In Applicant’s answer
to the SOR, she stated that this debt was paid in full and that a receipt was attached.
However, the record contains no receipt.
SOR ¶ 1.h: college tuition debt placed for collection of $1,049. In Applicant’s
answer to the SOR, she stated that she will make arrangements to resolve this debt. It is
not resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.i:  telecommunications  debt  placed  for  collection  of  $245.  In
Applicant’s answer to the SOR, she stated that this debt was paid in full, and she attached
a receipt reflecting the payment.
When Applicant submitted her SCA in March 2018, she answered “No” to all the
questions about delinquent debts in Section 26. (Exhibit 5 at 26-28.) The SOR does not
allege falsification of the March 2018 SCA. When Applicant submitted her second SCA in
April  2020,  she  was  familiar  with  the  form,  having  previously  submitted  an  SCA.  The
content and organization of the two SCAs is virtually identical. She again answered “No”
to the same questions. She did not disclose any of the delinquent debts alleged in the
SOR. She admitted the debts when she was confronted with them during the PSI. In her
answer to the SOR, she admitted that she did not answer the financial questions correctly,
but  she  denied  intending  to  falsify  or  withhold  information.  She  did  not  provide  any
explanation for her negative answers to the financial questions.
In the PSI, Applicant attributed her delinquent debts to “health issues.” She stated
that she was able to work in a limited capacity. (Exhibit 6 at 3.) She did not provide any
details about the nature of her health problems or the impact of her health problems on
her  ability  to  pay  her  debts.  She  also  did  not  provide  any  information  on  her  current
income, expenses, or overall financial situation.
