Applicant is 45 years old. He served on active duty in the United States Air Force
from October 1998 to July 2013 and in the Air Force reserve until July 2015; he received
an  honorable  discharge.  He  attended  three  universities,  two  colleges  and  a  computer
learning  center  from  1995  to  1997,  2005  to  2009,  and  2013  to  2015,  and  earned
associate’s  degrees  in  2006  and  2008.  He  married  in  April  2012  and  divorced  in  May
2014. He has one son (age 19), and reported paying approximately $400 per month in
child support. He has worked as a senior system administrator since February 2018 and
in various information technology positions since August 2013. (Item 3)
The SOR alleges nine delinquent debts, totaling approximately $53,899, and that
applicant falsified material facts  in his security clearance application (SCA) by denying
that he had financial problems and failing to disclose the delinquent debts alleged in the
SOR. Applicant admitted the allegations at SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.h, 1.i, and 2.a, with
explanations.  He  denied  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.d,  1.e,  1.f,  and  1.g,  with
explanations. (Item 1)
Applicant reported no financial issues in his January 2020 SCA. He denied that, in
the  previous  seven  years,  he  had defaulted on  any type  of  loan,  had  debts placed for
collection, had any credit account charged off, or that he had been more than 120 days’
delinquent  on  any  debt.  He  denied  that  he  was  utilizing  or  seeking  assistance  from  a
credit  counseling  service  or  similar  entity  to  resolve  his  financial  difficulties,  and  also
denied that he was then over 120 days’ delinquent on any debt. (Item 2)
Applicant was interviewed  by a government investigator in May and June 2020.
During  the  May  2020  interview,  he  initially  reported  no  adverse  financial  issues  in  the
previous  seven  years,  and  said  that  he  paid  his  debts  on  time.  After  the  investigator
confronted him with adverse financial information, Applicant acknowledged that he had
experienced  financial  difficulties  since  2013.  He  attributed  his  financial  issues  to  a
reduction in income after his overseas military allowances ended when he returned to the
United  States,  costs  associated  with  transition  from  active  military  service,  credit  card
debt from  the  purchase  of  household  items, child  support,  divorce  costs,  and  financial
support  for  his  parents  who  had  health  issues.  He  admitted  that  he  had  not  listed  his
financial difficulties in the SCA because those issues could negatively affect adjudication
of his application. He reported an annual salary of $111,000; disposable income of $600
monthly; a $3,200 emergency fund; and $43,000 in stocks. He said that he completed
courses on saving (2014) and investing (2019). (Item 3)
The evidence concerning debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below.
SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b,  and  1.c:  student  loan  collection  accounts  totaling  $9,844
($5,027,  $2,784,  and  $2,033  respectively).  The  May  2020  credit  report  reflects  the
student loans as in collection with balances of $4,758; $2,635; and $1,924, respectively.
The student loans accounts were opened from November 2013 to September 2015, and
later assigned to the Department of Education for collection. Applicant reported that  in
2016  the  college  he  attended  was  investigated  for  deceptive  practices  and  that  the
student  loans  were  placed  in  forbearance.  He  said  that  in  2019,  the  Department  of
Education informed him that he was not responsible for those loans, and that in May 2020,
the U.S. Treasury refunded payments he had made on those student loans. He admitted
each allegation, reported the loans were discharged, and provided documentary evidence
that the  debts alleged at  SOR  ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b  had been  discharged,  and that  the debt
alleged at SOR ¶1.c had been settled. He said that he did not list these student loans in
his  SCA  because  he  thought  that  he  was  not  responsible  for  them.  These  debts  are
resolved. (Item 1 at page 11, Item 3, Item 5 at pages 7-9; AE A, I, J, N, O)
SOR  ¶¶1.d  and  1.e:  collection  account  for  $20,384,  and  charge  account
charged off for $19,173. The May 2020 credit report reflects two accounts with the same
account  number  charged  off  by  a  creditor  for  $19,173  and  closed  in  June  2014,  and
placed  for  collection  by  a  different  creditor  in  June  2014,  with  an  account  balance  of
$20,384. Applicant reported the  debt was a $15,000 personal loan that he obtained to
assist  with  his  financial  difficulties  and  that  he  could  not  afford  to  make  the  required
payments. He said that he did not report this debt in his SCA because he disputed the
account balance. He stated that the two debts alleged in the SOR were for the same debt
and said that he would contact the creditor and set up a payment plan in June 2020. In
response  to  the  SOR,  he  denied  both  allegations,  and  has  submitted  documentary
evidence  that  both  accounts  do  not  appear  on  recent  credit  reports.  He  provided  no
documentary evidence that he contacted the creditors, made payments on or otherwise
resolved the debts. I find that the debt alleged at SOR ¶ 1.e, was acquired by a different
creditor and placed for collection  as alleged at SOR ¶ 1.d. When the same conduct is
alleged  more
the  same  guideline,  one  of
the  SOR  under
the duplicative allegations should be  resolved  in Applicant’s favor. See ISCR Case No.
03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005) (same debt alleged twice). Accordingly, I have
resolved SOR ¶ 1.e in Applicant's favor on that basis. The account alleged at SOR ¶ 1.d
has not been resolved. (Items 1, 3, 4, 5; AE G, P, Q)
than  once
in
SOR ¶1.f: collection account for $2,408. The May 2020 credit report reflects an
account  balance  of  $2,708,  and  that  the  debt  was  assigned  for  collection  in  2015.
Applicant reported that the account was a delinquent credit-card account, that he did not
recall when he last made a payment on the account, and that he would contact the creditor
and make an immediate payment. He said that he did not disclose this account in his SCA
because  he  did  not  want  to.  In  June  2020,  he  provided  evidence  that  he  entered  a
payment plan with an initial payment due in July 2020 and final payment due in February
2021. In response to the SOR, he denied the allegation and has provided documentary
evidence that the account was removed from his credit report in August 2020. He provided
no documentary evidence that he made payments under the payment plan, or otherwise
resolved the debt. The debt has not been resolved. (Item 1 at page 12-13, Items 3, 4, 5;
AE G, P, Q, T)
SOR  ¶1.g:  collection account for  $1,052.  The  May 2020  credit  report reflects
this account as assigned for collection in January 2020 with an account balance of $1,052.
Applicant  reported  that  he  disputed  the  validity  of  the  debt,  stating  that  in  2013  a
telecommunications  service  provider  charged  him  a  fee  for failing  to  return  equipment
that  he  had  returned.  He  said  that  he  had  submitted  a  receipt  reflecting  return  of  the
equipment to the creditor. He did not list this account in his SCA because he disputed its
validity. He said that he would contact the creditor in June 2020. He denied the allegation,
and has submitted documentary evidence that the account has been removed from his
credit report. He provided documentary evidence reflecting resolution of a different debt
with a sister company that was also listed in the May 2020 credit report. He provided no
documentary evidence that he contacted the creditor, disputed, made payments on, or
otherwise resolved this debt. The debt has not been resolved. (Item 4 at pages 10, 12,
13, 15, Item 5 at page 10; AE F, G, P, R)
SOR  ¶1.h:  credit  account  charged  off  for  $807.  The  May  2020  credit  report
reflects this account as charged off in July 2014. Applicant said that he made payments
on the account until 2014, but stopped making payments because he disputed a charge.
He said that he did not disclose this debt in his SCA because he disputed the amount and
hoped  to  resolve  the  matter.  He  admitted  the  allegation  and  provided  documentary
evidence  that  the  account  had  been  removed  from  his  credit  report.  He  provided  no
documentary evidence that he contacted the creditor, disputed or made payments on the
debt, or resolved this debt. The debt has not been resolved. (Items 3, 4; AE G, P, Q)
SOR  ¶1.i:  credit  account  charged  off  for  $231.  The  May  2020  credit  report
reflects  this account  as  charged  off for $231.  Applicant  reported that  this debt  was  for
unauthorized charges in 2014. He reported that the credit union could not determine who
had  made  the  disputed  charge.  He  said  that  he  did  not  list  this  account  in  his  SCA
because the investigation was inconclusive and he did not think that he needed to make
payment on the account. He admitted the allegation and provided documentary evidence
that the account had been removed from his credit report. He provided no documentary
evidence  that he  contacted the  creditor,  disputed, or otherwise  resolved  the debt.  The
debt has not been resolved. (Items 3, 4; AE G, P)
Applicant admitted that he intentionally falsified material facts in his January 2020
SCA regarding his financial account delinquencies and deliberately failed to disclose the
delinquent debts alleged at SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.i, because he feared truthful responses would
hurt  his  chances  of  retaining  a  security  clearance.  He  reported  experiencing  a  difficult
couple of years including six months of unemployment, providing financial assistance to
his  parents,  relocating  from  Hawaii,  and  a  costly  divorce.  He  said  that  he  had  held  a
security clearance for many years, was a responsible person, lived modestly, and was a
dependable, excellent worker. He noted that he received four medals for performance in
the Air Force, was selected as Noncommissioned Officer of the Month and Quarter, and
had been recognized as a member of the Weapons Load Crew of the Year. He requested
forgiveness for his lack of candor and a second chance. (Item 1)
The   record  includes  documentary   evidence   that  Applicant  worked   with   a   credit
repair  service,  and  resolved  a  number debts not alleged  in  the  SOR. Recent  credit  records
provided  by  Applicant reflect  only  three  delinquent accounts, none  of which were alleged
in  the   SOR.  He  did  not  provide   documentary   evidence   of   his  current  financial  budget,
savings  or disposable  income.  Any  derogatory  information  not alleged  in the  SOR will not
be   considered   for  disqualifying   purposes.   However,  it  may   be   considered   in  the
application of mitigating  conditions and  in  a  whole-person analysis.  (Items  1, 5; AE  B,  C,
D, E, F, G, H, K, L, M, O, P, Q, R, S)
