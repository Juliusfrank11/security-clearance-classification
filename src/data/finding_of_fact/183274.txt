Applicant admitted to all the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  44-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed  with the defense contractor since June of 2016. He is married, and has two
children, and one adult stepchild. (TR at page 5 lines 9~20, at page 12 line 7 to page 13
line 8, and GX 1 at pages 14, 26 and 51.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
1.c. Applicant filed for the protection of a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy in July of 2006,
but he  was  unable to keep up  with  his payments;  and as  a result,  it  was  dismissed  in
July of 2009. (TR at page 16 line 18 to page 17 line 16, and at page 41 line 14 to page
42 line 10.)
1.a. and 1.b. Applicant admits that he  was indebted to the Federal Government
for delinquent taxes for tax years 2004 and 2005 in  an amount totaling about $11,129.
These tax debts/liens were added to Applicant’s “Offer in Compromise contract” with the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS). (TR at page 13 line 23 to page 15 line 14, at page 42
lines  11~20,  and  AppXs  B  and  F2.)  As  Applicant  “met  the  payment  provisions’”  of  his
contract with the IRS, these tax debts/liens have been released by the IRS. (AppX B.)
1.f.   Applicant  admits  that  he  was  indebted  to  the  Federal  Government  for
delinquent  taxes  for  tax  year  2009  in  an  amount  totaling  about  $10,241.  This  tax
debt/lien  was  part  of  Applicant’s  “Offer  in  Compromise  contract”  with  the  Internal
Revenue  Service  (IRS).  (TR at  page  15  lines  15~24,  and  AppX  B.)  As  Applicant  “met
the  payment  provisions’”  of  his  contract  with  the  IRS,  this  tax  debt/lien  has  been
released by the IRS. (AppX B.)
1.g.  Applicant  admits  that  he  was  indebted  to  the  Federal  Government  for
delinquent taxes in an amount totaling about $99,250. This combined tax debt/lien was
part  of  Applicant’s  “Offer  in  Compromise  contract”  with  the  Internal  Revenue  Service
(IRS).  (TR  at  page  16  lines  1~17,  and  AppX  B.)  As  Applicant  “met  the  payment
provisions’” of his contract  with  the IRS, this combined tax debt/lien has been released
by the IRS. (AppXs B and C.)
1.d.   and   1.e.   Applicant  has  filed  his  Federal  income  tax  returns  for  tax  years
2006~2013, 2015 and 2017. (TR at page 17 line 17 to page 18 line 18, at page 27 line
21  to  page  30  line  10,  and  AppXs  B  and  C.)  Applicant  also  complied  with  the  state
taxing  authority’s  concerns  regarding  his  filings  for  tax  years  2006~2013,  2015  and
2017. (TR at page 18 line 19 to page 19 line 11, at page 42 line 21 to page 43 line 15,

monthly”  payments  towards  this  past-due  medical  debt,  and  towards  the  medical  debt
noted  in  1.l.,  below,  (as  evidenced  by  documentation  from  a  “Credit  Consulting”
service). (TR at page 20 line 17 to page 21 line 20, and AppXs I~K.)
1.l.  Applicant’s  admitted  past-due  medical  debt  to  Creditor  I,  in  the  amount  of
