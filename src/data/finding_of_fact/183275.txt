Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  allegations  in  the  SOR.  His  admissions  are
incorporated  into  the  findings  of  facts.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 33 years old. He graduated from high school in 2007. He served in the
military  from  2009  to  2017.  He  deployed  to  the  Persian  Gulf  in  2010  and  was  part  of
combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. He was honorably discharged in the rank of
E-5.  He  married  in  2012  and  has  a  10-year-old  child.  He  began  work  with  a  federal
contractor in July 2020, earning a salary of $92,000. Before then, he worked as a nurse’s
aide from August 2019 to July 2020 with an annual salary of $26,000. From August 2017
to August 2019, he worked for the Postal Service and attended college. His annual salary
was about $40,000. (Tr. 16-20, 60-61)
Applicant accumulated  delinquent debts  and attributed his financial problems to  a
period  when  he  was underemployed  after his discharge  from  the  military. He and  his wife
purchased a home in  2013  that was affordable on his salary. His wife was not working at
the  time. In  2014,  his wife  got a  job  and  was earning  about  $13  an  hour. In  late  2014, she
became  a  manager at  a  retail  store  and  was friends with  the  owner. Her income  increased
to  almost $1,000   a   week. She   had   a   disagreement   with   the   owner,   and   lost her   job   in
2016.  Applicant   testified   that  when   her  salary   increased,   they   made   poor  financial
decisions  and  lived  beyond  their  means. His wife  then  got  a  job  with  a  credit  union  at a
substantially  reduced  salary, and  his son  went  to  daycare. His son  has respiratory  issues
and   was  frequently   sick,  which  required   his   wife   to   miss  work,  until  she   finally   had   to
resign  due  to  their  son’s health. They  began  to  fall  behind  in paying  their  debts.  (Tr. 21-
26, 62-63)
Applicant testified that they could not afford the car payments on the two vehicles
they had purchased, so he returned them and purchased two older vehicles. He said he
should have considered bankruptcy at the time, but because of pride and stupidity, he did
not. (Tr. 25, 31)
In 2017, after he was discharged from the military, Applicant and his family moved
back to his home state. He completed a deed in lieu of foreclosure on his house in May
2017. He began to attend college full-time in the fall of 2017 in pursuit of a nursing degree.
In  2019,  he  received  his  certified  nursing  degree  and  began  working  in  the  hospital.
During this time the COVID pandemic was rampant and he worked on the ward with the
COVID patients. He was hoping to complete his nursing degree so he could go back into
the  military as an officer in the Nurse Corps.  During this time, he had difficulty paying his
debts due to low wages.  (Tr. 18-19, 25-27)
Applicant testified that through his research he believed much of his debt would be
barred  by  the  statute  of  limitations.  He  later  learned  that  his  financial  issues  were  a
security  concern,  and  he  realized  he  needed  to  address  his  delinquencies.  He
acknowledged  that  when  he  was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator  in  August
2020, he told the investigator that he was willing and able to pay each debt. He testified
that  at  that  time  he  was  willing  to  pay  the  debts,  but  he  did  not  understand  the  full
ramification  of  his failure  to  act  expeditiously.  He  credibly  testified that  he  did  not fully
grasp the importance of resolving his delinquent debt until his security clearance became
an issue. (Tr. 28, 59-62)
Applicant further testified that when his wife had to resign from her job due to his
son’s  health  issues,  his  underemployment  severely  impacted  their  ability  to  pay  their
debts. She is now working full time, and they are able to meet their monthly expenses. At
the time, he considered letting the statute of limitations run on his debts so he could be in
a better financial situation. (Tr. 17)
Applicant testified that he used his tax refund to pay his student loans, but did not
begin to address his other delinquent debts until after he received the SOR in June 2021.
He withdrew funds from his military Thrift Savings Plan to pay some of the debts. (Tr. 30-
31)
The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a ($12,988), 1.b ($10,467), and 1.c ($7,630) are all to the
same  creditor  and  includes  a  repossessed  vehicle.  Applicant  took  out  a  loan  for
approximately $9,000 and used it to settle the above debts in November 2021. He settled
them for $3,000, $2,800, and $2,000 respectively. His monthly loan payment is $339 and
he is current on his payments. He provided IRS Form 1099-C (cancellation of debt) for
the balances canceled in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.c. These debts are resolved. (Tr. 32-49; GE
3, 4; AE A, C, H)
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.d ($5,171) is a credit card that Applicant had difficulty paying
after his wife lost her job in 2016. He began paying $200 a month on it in August 2021
and then settled it for $1,953 in June 2022. He testified he used money he had saved to
settle the debt. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 49-51; GE 3, 4; AE A)
Applicant testified that the money he withdrew from his current 401K pension plan
was used to pay the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.e ($889), 1.f ($870), 1.g ($592) and 1.h ($450).
He provided supporting documents. (Tr. 51-57; GE 3, 4; AE A, B, D, I)
Applicant believed the debt in SOR ¶ 1.i ($3,808) was a debt consolidation loan
and he has not yet reached a settlement to resolve the debt. It was reported on his July
2020  and  May  2021  credit  reports,  but  not  on  his  September  2022  credit  report.  He
intends to resolve it. (Tr. 57; GE 3, 4; AE A, K)
Applicant took full responsibility for his financial issues and understands that he
should have addressed his delinquent debts earlier. He worked hard to rectify them albeit
later than he should have. He has taken significant steps to reduce his delinquencies. He
and his wife provide financial support to her parents. They have made significant financial
strides and their finances are stable. He understands the gravity of his financial situation
and is committed to ensuring his future finances remain in order.
