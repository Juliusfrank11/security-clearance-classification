In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  she  admitted  the  allegation  that  she  used
marijuana with varying frequency from about June 1995 to April 2020. Her admission is
incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  42-year-old.  She  has  been  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  in
information  technology  (IT)  since  February  2020.  She  has  never  held  a  security
clearance.
Applicant believes she received her GED in September 1999.  She attended some
college courses in 1999 but did not receive a degree. She married in 2000 and has three
children.
When Applicant submitted her SCA in February 2020, she disclosed that she used
marijuana  from  about  June  1995  to  February  2020.  She  described  her use  from  June
1995 until 2000 as daily. She stated her more recent use was on occasion and that she
did not intend to use marijuana in the future because she did not want it to interfere with
her career. (FORM Item 2 at 33.)
When Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in April 2020, she told
the investigator that from 2000 to the present she smoked marijuana three to four times
a week at her house. She disclosed she used hemp pills in 2019 to mitigate the pain from
a car accident and had stopped use when she no longer needed them. She was given an
opportunity to verify her April 2020 interview. She affirmed her interview in February 2021
and stated she had not used marijuana since “April 2020, nor do [I] have the want or need
to.” (FORM Item 3 at 3.)
