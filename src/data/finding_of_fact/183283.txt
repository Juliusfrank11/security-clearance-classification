Applicant is a  41-year-old employee  of  a  government contractor.  He  has  worked
for his  current  employer since about  September 2016.  He  earned  a bachelor’s degree  in
May   2017,  after  attending   classes  since   2011.  He  has  been   married   since   May   2009.
He  has  three   children,   ages  seven,  three,  and   one.   He  served   on   active   duty   with   the
U.S.  Marine   Corps  from   April  2005   until  January   2011   and   received   an   honorable
discharge.  (Tr.  28-29, 37;  GE  1, 2)
The  SOR  alleges  Applicant’s  nine  delinquent  student
totaling
approximately $63,000 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.i).  In the Answer, he admitted all of the
SOR allegations with additional comment and attached documents. His admissions are
adopted  as  findings  of  fact,  and  his  attached  documents  are  made  part  of  the  record.

through  Applicant’s  admissions  and
loans
Applicant claimed his financial issues resulted from a period of marital problems
and an unforeseen federal tax burden from the 2016 tax year. He claimed that, in 2017,
when he completed the forms for his 2016 federal income tax return, he realized that he
owed the IRS about $6,600 for that tax year. He could not afford to pay that income tax
bill, so  he  “shut down.” He did  not timely file  or pay his 2016  federal income  taxes.1  In
August 2019, he filed his federal 2016 tax return and made payment arrangements with
the IRS to satisfy his 2016 federal tax debt. In about 2021, he satisfied his 2016 federal
income  tax  debt  through  monthly  payments  and  offsets.  He  has  not  owed  federal
income  taxes  after  the  2016  tax  year  because  he  and  his  spouse  changed  their
withholdings in 2017. (Tr. 20, 38-48, 68-69; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  funded  his  six  years  of  college  with  federal  student  loans.  In  about
February 2017, the grace period on these student loans expired, requiring him to make
payments.  However,  as  a  result  of  his  marital  problems  and  shutting  down  from  his
unforeseen income tax debt, he failed to make the required payments. In January 2019,
he received a notice of default that informed him that he must make payments of about
$800  per  month  on  his  student  loans  or  his  wages  would  be  garnished.  He  did  not
voluntarily make the required payments, so his wages were garnished in the amount of
about  $200-$214  per  pay  period  from  January  2019  until  March  2020.  The  wage
garnishment  ended  when  President  Biden  automatically  deferred  all  federal  student
loan  payments  because  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  Applicant’s  student  loans  are  in
deferment until the COVID-19 automatic deferral ends. However, his student loans were
in default prior to this deferment period. He did not tell his spouse about his student loan
default until August 2019. (Tr. 20-21, 37-38, 44, 49-52, 63-64, 67-69; Answer; GE 1-6)
Applicant claimed that he contacted his student loan servicer after the COVID-19
deferment period began. He claimed that, during the COVID-19 deferral period, he filled
1  Any   adverse   information   not  alleged   in  the   SOR,   such  as   Applicant’s   failure  to   timely   file   and   pay   his
2016  federal  income tax  return,  cannot be  used  for disqualification purposes. It may  be  considered when
assessing  the application  of  mitigating conditions  and for the whole-person analysis.
out the paperwork  with  his loan  service  provider to  enter into a rehabilitation program,
but he learned that his student loans were placed with the Department of Education, so
he  did  not  complete  the  rehabilitation  agreement.  The  only  documentary  evidence  he
provided of his contact with his loan servicer is a June 2021 letter from his loan servicer
confirming  the  balance  on  his  student  loans  and  to  whom  he  should  make  payments.
Applicant  claimed  that once  the COVID-19 deferral ends he will have  to make several
monthly  payments  of  $1,000,  and  then  his  student  loans  will  be  rehabilitated.  He
claimed  that  once  his  loans  are  rehabilitated,  his  new  monthly  payment  will  be  about
$1,000.  He  provided  no  documents  to  corroborate  his  rehabilitation  period  or  his  new
monthly payment amount. He intends to make those rehabilitation payments when they
become due and then resume his normal monthly payments. (Tr. 53-58; Answer; GE 1,

Applicant’s take-home pay is about $4,000 per month. He currently makes about
$108,000 annually. In 2016, he made about $60,000 annually. In 2020, he made about
$70,000  annually.  His  spouse  shares  household  income  and  expenses.  She  makes
about  $100,000  annually.  However,  her  income  is  commission-based,  so  it  fluctuates.
Applicant claimed that he has $20,000 in a savings account and $1,000 in a checking
account. He claimed that he has money in a retirement account, but he does not know
how  much.  He  pays  $1,300  per  month  towards  his  mortgage,  but  that  payment  will
increase  to  about  $1,700  once  he  completes  a  refinance  of  his  mortgage  in  order  to
renovate  his  home.  Between  late  2019  and  early  2021,  he  purchased  two  used
vehicles, paying a total of  about $7,000 in down payments  and borrowing the rest. He
pays a total of about $850 per month on these two car notes. He has not received any
financial counseling and does not follow a written budget. (Tr. 28-34, 60-63, 70)
