In  his  answer  to  the  SOR, Applicant  admitted  the  allegations  contained  in SOR  ¶¶
1.a  1. b, 2.a,  and  2.c. He denied  the  allegations  in SOR ¶¶  2.b, and  3.a  through  3.f. His
admissions  are accepted as  findings of fact.
Applicant is 27 years old. He graduated from high school in 2013. He served on
active  duty  in  the  Army  from  June  2013  to  March  2018,  at  which  time  he  received  an
honorable discharge. He held a security clearance while serving.  He has been married
since  2017.  He and his  wife  have  one child. (GE  1)  Between 2019  and  2020, he  took
online  courses  in  information  technology  (IT).  He  is  currently  enrolled  in  college  and
pursuing a bachelor’s degree in IT. He anticipates graduating in 2023. (Tr. 22-24)
After his discharge from the Army in March 2018, Applicant worked for a federal
contractor for two months and then for a trucking company for six months. In December
2018,  he  started  a  position  with  the  Army  as  an  operating  room  nursing  assistant.  He
worked there until October 25, 2019, when he was fired during his probationary period for
testing positive for marijuana. He held a security clearance at the time he was fired. He
then became self-employed as a driver for restaurants until he secured a position with
another federal contractor. (Tr. 16; GE 1 at 33-34)
In  March  2020,  Applicant  submitted  an  e-QIP,  requesting  eligibility  to  hold  a
sensitive  position.  In  April  2020,  Applicant  started  employment  with  another  federal
contractor for which he needs eligibility to occupy a position of public trust.
Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse
In his March 26, 2020 e-QIP, Applicant disclosed the following information:
(1)  Under   Section   13A   -  Employment  Activities,  he  disclosed  that  in  October
2019 he was fired from the Army for “Probationary Termination.” (GE 1 at 15)
(2)  Under  Section   23   –   Illegal  Use  of  Drugs  or  Drug   Activity,  he   disclosed   that
within  the   past  seven   years  he   illegally   used   drugs.  He   reported   that  he   used
“Recreational and  Medication  CBD W/THC below  the  Threshold” from  “January  2019  to
June  2019  (Estimated).”  (GE 1  at 31) He  stated  that he  used  it  while  visiting  another state.
He noted  that he  used  it to  alleviate  pain. He  disclosed  that he  used  it  while  possessing
a security clearance and that he  did not intend to  use it in the  future.  (GE 1  at 31, 32)
(3)  Section  23  –  Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity, While Possessing a Security
Clearance,  inquired:  “Have  you  ever  illegally  used  or  otherwise  been  illegally  involved
with  a  drug  or  controlled  substance  while  possessing  a  security  clearance  other  than
previously listed,” Applicant answered “no.” (GE 1 at 32)
In May 2020, a government investigator interviewed Applicant about his illegal drug
use and other background issues. Applicant discussed using marijuana while employed
at the Army hospital. He told the investigator that in September 2019, he tested positive
for marijuana while employed with the Army, which resulted in his termination. Applicant
stated that after his supervisor notified him  of his positive  drug test, he was placed on
administrative leave and terminated on October 25, 2019. He showed the investigator the
termination notice. (GE 2 at 3)
Applicant  told  the  investigator  that  he  used  marijuana  about  eight  times  and
cannabidiol, a chemical found in marijuana (CBD), twice. He used CBD oil for insomnia
and migraines. He did not have a medical marijuana card. He purchased marijuana from
a stranger. He acknowledged that his use of marijuana and CBD was the reason for his
termination. He said he did not intend to use it in the future. (GE 2 at 5)
Subsequent to his interview, the Government sent Applicant Interrogatories, which
incorporated the report of his May 2020 interview and asked him to verify the accuracy of
the information in that report. Applicant confirmed that the information was accurate. In
addition,  the  Government  asked  him  to  complete  Interrogatories  which  asked  the
following  question:  “In  your  interview,  you  disclosed  that  you  used  marijuana  between
January  2019  and  August  2019.  Have  you  used  marijuana  since  then?”  Applicant
answered “no.” (GE 2 at 10) In response to two other questions, he reported that he did
not intend to use marijuana in the future and that he no longer associates with the people
with whom he used it. (Id.)
Applicant testified that he knew as a surgical assistant and as a federal employee
holding  a  security  clearance,  he  was  prohibited  from  using  marijuana  or  any  illegal
substance.  He  understood  the  adverse  consequences  of  buying  and  using  marijuana
while  employed  in  his  position.  He  started  using  it  because  he  witnessed  gruesome
trauma surgeries, which caused him serious emotional distress that he chose to manage
with  marijuana. (Tr. 25-33; GE 2  at 5) He said  that he used marijuana for recreational
purposes and CBD oil for medical purposes. (Tr. 33)
Applicant  was  diagnosed  with  post-traumatic stress  syndrome  (PTSD) in  March
2018,  prior  to  his discharge  from  the  Army.  He  continues  to  suffer from  it.  After  being
diagnosed  with  PTSD,  he  began  participating  in  therapy  once  a  week  for  about  two
months  with  a  psychologist  at  the  Veterans  Affairs  (VA)  hospital.  He  has  continued  to
participate in some form of treatment over the past four years. His therapist recommended
that he not use marijuana. He has never been referred to a psychiatrist for medication,
although he said he has requested it. He has continued to use marijuana monthly since
2019. He used it a week before this hearing and intends to continue using it. (Tr. 35-41,
54; GE 2)
Personal Conduct
Applicant admitted that he was fired from his employment at the Department of
the Army in about October 2019 for testing positive for marijuana, and was not eligible for
rehire, as alleged in SOR ¶ 2.a. (Answer)
Applicant denied the allegation in SOR ¶ 2.b, which alleged he deliberately failed
to  disclose  in  Section  23  –  Illegal  Use  of  Drug  Activity  of  his  March  2020  e-QIP  the
information set forth in SOR ¶ 1.a: He used marijuana with varying frequency, from about
January 2019 to about August 2019, while granted access to classified information. He
stated that he disclosed his illegal drug use under Section 23 in his e-QIP. In addition,
Applicant  asserted  that  he  gave  all  of  the  information  surrounding  his  drug  use  and
termination to the investigator during his May 2020 interview. (Answer)
Applicant admitted the allegation in SOR ¶ 2.c that alleged he intentionally failed
to disclose under Section 23 – Illegal Use of Drug Activity, While Possessing a Security
Clearance, that he illegally used a drug while possessing a security clearance. Applicant
admitted that he did not disclose the information under this heading because he disclosed
it in the previous paragraph in Section 23. (Answer)
Financial Considerations
Based  on  credit  bureau  reports  from  October  2018,  May  2020,  April  2021,  and
February 2022, the SOR alleged six delinquent debts, which became delinquent between
2017 and 2021. (GE 3, 4, 5, and 6) They total  $12,154. In his Answer to the SOR, he
denied owing all six debts because his mortgage company required him to resolve all of
his delinquent debts before applying for a mortgage to purchase a home. (Answer) The
status of each debt is as follows:
(3.a) Applicant said that this  charged-off  credit card debt for $12,044  was settled
for  less  and   paid  after   the   creditor  obtained   a   judgment  and   then   a   lien.  He  said  the
account became  delinquent before he  started  working  for  the  Army  because  he  could  not
afford to pay it.  He  said he settled it prior to  May 24, 2021, the  day  he closed on  a  home.
(Tr. 41-45; AE  G)  He agreed  to  submit proof  of  the  settlement and  payment, but did not
do so.  It is not resolved.
(3.b) Applicant  said  the  charged-off  $3,137  motorcycle loan  was a  personal  loan
he  obtained  in 2016. He  settled  the  debt and  paid it.  He thinks he  received  a  Cancellation
of  Debt document from  the  creditor  in the  amount of the  loan. (Tr.  46-49)  He agreed  to
submit documents verifying that it was resolved, but did not do so.  It is not resolved.
(3.c) Applicant negotiated a settlement of $1,600 for the $2,805 collection account
owed to LVNV. He paid the debt in February 2021. (Tr. 49-50; AE F, AE J) It is resolved.
(3.d) The $1,273 collections account owed to LVNV for a mattress was paid and
settled for $1,018 after the creditor sued Applicant. (Tr. 50-51; AE K) It is resolved.
(3.e) The $1,009 collections account is owed to an apartment complex for unpaid
rent. Applicant said he paid it and would submit a receipt. (Tr. 52) He did not provide a
receipt. It is not resolved.
(3.f)   The  $886  collections  account  is owed  to  a  jewelry store.  Applicant  said he
resolved  it  and  would  provide  proof  of  payment.  (Tr.  53)  He  did  not  submit  any
documentation. The debt is not resolved.
Applicant  stated  that  some  of  the  above  accounts  began  accumulating  prior  to
2018, when he started working for the Army hospital. He said that he was spending more
money than he was earning. (Tr. 42) He began addressing his delinquent debts in 2021
because he wanted to repair his credit  so he could purchase a house, which he did in
May 2021.  (Tr. 52) His  income  is  now stable.  He  started  receiving disability payments
from the VA in September 2019. His initial disability rating was 90 per cent. In December
2019, the rating was raised to 100 percent. He receives $4,000 each month, which is tax
free.  (AE  D) In  April 2020,  Applicant  started  a  position  with  a  federal  contractor as  an
infrastructure monitoring analyst. (Tr. 15-18)
As of December 15, 2021, Applicant had earned about $55,800. (AE A) In January
2021, he completed a homeownership education course with Fannie Mae. (AE E)
Mitigation
While serving in the Army, he received two Army Achievement Medals, a National
Defense  Service  Medal,  and  the  Army  Service  Ribbon.  He  served  in  management
positions and conducted service trainings for patient healthcare. (Tr. 20-21)
