Under Guideline  F,  the  Government alleged  that Applicant owed  $51,649  for six
delinquent   or  past-due   debts   (SOR  1.a   –   1.f).  In   his  Answer,  Applicant  admitted   with
explanations  all  of the  SOR allegations.  In  addition  to  the  facts established  by  Applicant’s
admissions, I  make  the following findings of relevant fact.
Applicant is  a  47-year-old employee  of  a  large  defense  contractor for whom  he  has
worked  since  May  2001. Prior to  that, he  worked  for 16  months at a  large  U.S.  military
base,   possibly   as   a  federal employee.  It   was  during   that employment that  he   was first
granted a security clearance. (GX 1; Tr. 15, 46  –  47)
Applicant and  his wife  have  been  married  since  February  2007. They  have  three
children  together, ages 7,  13,  and  14.  Applicant  was previously  married  between  March
2001  and  November 2006. That marriage  produced  one  child.  Applicant paid  his ex-wife
$800  each  month  for child  support until their  child  turned  18  in October 2021. (GX  1; Tr.
15, 60  –  61)
The  debts  alleged  in the  SOR are  documented  by  the  Government’s exhibits.  In
response   to   the   SOR,   Applicant  did   not  contest  any   of   the   allegations   and   stated   his
intention  to  resolve  all  of  his debts by  the  end  of  2021. At  hearing, he  averred  that he  has
paid or otherwise resolved  all  but  one  (SOR 1.a) of the  debts  alleged. (Answer; AX  A; Tr.
35 –  43)
Available  information   shows  that  the   debts  at  issue   became   delinquent  in  2019
and  2020.  Applicant attributes his financial  problems  to  the  loss of  his wife’s income  after
she was injured in a car accident in late 2018 and stopped working full time. He further
claims  that in  2020,  when their children had to  stay home from school because of  the
Covid-19  pandemic,  his  wife  could  not  work,  further  hindering  their  ability  to  pay  their
debts. (Answer; GX 1 – 4; AX A; Tr. 35 – 43, 35, 40, 41, 80, 86 – 88)
Applicant  has  acknowledged  that  he already was  carrying high  balances  on  his
credit cards at the time of his wife’s accident.  His annual income at the time was about
$96,000.  Her  annual  income  was  between  $15,000  and  $20,000.  Since  2001,  he  has
been continually employed with health insurance for him and his family, and he now earns
about $121,000 annually. His wife also could not work for an unspecified time starting in
early  2020  because  their  children  had  to  attend  school  virtually.  The  children  have
returned  to  in-person  learning,  but  his  wife  now  works  only  sporadically depending  on
how she feels physically. (Tr. 48 – 50, 60, 69, 78 – 79, 86 – 87)
The documentary information Applicant provided shows he has settled for lesser
amounts the debts alleged  at SOR  1.c and  1.e. He also provided information showing
that he resolved a credit card debt owed to the creditor listed at SOR 1.d; however, that
account is different than the account addressed in SOR 1.d, which remains unresolved.
(GX 2 – 3; AX A – D; Tr. 39 – 41, 75 – 78)
The debts alleged at SOR 1.b and 1.f are for delinquent credit card accounts owed
to the same creditor. That creditor filed civil suits to collect the debts, which total more
than  $25,000.  The  civil  suits  were  dismissed  in  June  2021  and  January  2022  after
Applicant hired an attorney to respond to the suits. He paid a retainer for legal services
but acknowledged at hearing that he did not pay anything directly to the creditor. Despite
the dismissal of the civil suits, I find from all of the available information that these debts
remain unresolved. (GX 3; AX E; Tr. 71 – 75, 89 – 90)
Applicant disclosed  all  of  the  SOR debts in  Section  26  (Financial Record) of  his
February 2020 e-QIP, and he indicated his intention to contact his creditors to “take care
of  it.”  Nonetheless, he  did  not take  any  action  to  resolve  any  of  his  debts until after he
received  the  SOR  more than  a  year later.  He has not  taken  any  action  regarding  the  SOR
1.a  account since  trying  to  contact that creditor around  the  time  he  received  the  SOR. A
credit  report  dated   August  5,  2022,   shows  that,   since   2020,  he   has  opened   additional
credit card accounts on  which he  is current but carries high  balances.  In  April 2022, he
purchased  a  new  home  for $374,600. To  obtain that mortgage, he  made  a  down  payment
of   about  $13,000,  which  he   borrowed   from   family   members   and   is  still   repaying.   In
November 2022,  Applicant  financed  the  purchase  of a  new  car for about $38,000  after
making  a  $3,000  down  payment he  borrowed  from  his brother, a  debt he  has since  repaid.
(GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 65  –  68, 78 –  79, 85)
Applicant’s wife  was not seriously  injured  as a  result of  her car accident; however,
she  has suffered  back pain at times. In  November 2021, in an  effort  to  alleviate  that pain,
she  underwent cosmetic surgery  (commonly  referred  to  as  a  “tummy  tuck”)  to  reduce  the
size  of her abdomen.  In  July  2022, she  had  another surgery  due  to  complications  from
the first procedure. Neither procedure was covered by Applicant’s medical insurance, so
his wife opened a credit account to pay between $12,000 and $20,000 for the procedures.
Because Applicant is, for all intents and purposes, the sole income earner in the family,
he will have to pay that debt. (Tr. 50 – 60)
When Applicant’s wife had her car accident in 2018, his annual salary was about
$96,000.  By  2021,  his  salary  had  increased  through  annual  adjustments  to  about
$121,000. His net pay each week is about $1,800, which equates to at least $7,000 in
monthly  take-home  pay.  From  that,  he  reports  he  pays  a  monthly  mortgage  of  about
$2,755 (with taxes and insurance) and about $600 for a car payment. He estimates that
after all of his monthly expenses (utilities, phones, internet, food, gas, insurance, etc.), he
has between $2,000 and $4,000 remaining. Applicant files his state and federal income
tax  returns  on  time  each  year;  however,  at  his  hearing  he  disclosed  that  he  was  four
months  late  in  paying  a  2021  tax year bill of  about  $900.  Other than  his responses to
questions at his hearing, Applicant has not any information about how he manages his
monthly finances. He also did not produce any information about how he plans to resolve
his remaining debts. (Tr. 48 – 51, 62 – 65, 80 – 85)
