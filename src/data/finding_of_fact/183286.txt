Applicant is 58 years old. He has been with his legal domestic partner for several
years.  Since  April  2003,  he  has  worked  for his  current  federal  contract  employer  as  a
buyer. He has never held a DOD security clearance. (Item 3)
The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  owes  seven  delinquent  consumer  credit-card
debts  totaling  at  least  $34,844.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  - 1.g)  He  disclosed  seven  delinquent
accounts on the April 2020 SCA, and listed that due to his escalating credit card debt, he
entered  into  a four-year  agreement  with  a  debt  relief  company  (DRC)  to  pay-off  these
debts. The SOR is supported by two credit reports submitted by the Government. (Items
4 and 5)
During  Applicant’s  May  7,  2020  background  interview  with  an  authorized  DOD
investigator, he stated that he entered into the 4-year payment agreement with the DRC
in October 2019. He needed to make this financial arrangement after he noticed he could
no  longer  make  the  minimum  monthly  payment  on  his  credit  cards  and  his  mounting
concern as his debt continued to grow. However, after making six monthly payments of
$820, he cancelled the agreement with DRC in April 2020. He told the investigator that
he intended to make arrangements with the credit card companies and use any COVID
relief offered to manage his debt. During his interview, he acknowledged responsibility for
the seven delinquent accounts and asserted that he was willing and able to pay, in full,
the outstanding debts. (Item 6)
In  Applicant’s  SOR  response,  he  admitted  all  seven  delinquent  credit-card
accounts and stated that each account was being disputed with the three reporting credit
bureaus. He did not provide an explanation related to the basis for the dispute of each
account cited in the SOR. He provided a copy of the correspondence he sent to the three
credit reporting bureaus asking that each account be verified and certified by the creditor
that  the  information  reported  is  accurate,  or  the  creditor  should  remove  the  adverse
information for each account from his credit report.
(SOR ¶ 1.a) Applicant is past due in the amount of $2,218, with a total balance of

(SOR ¶ 1.b) Applicant is past due in the amount of $1,798, with a total balance of
$11,090 owed for a credit card. (Items 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5)
(SOR ¶ 1.c) Applicant is past due in the amount of $752, with a total balance of
$4,479 owed to a bank. (Items 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5)
(SOR ¶ 1.d) Applicant owes $20,025 for a delinquent credit card account charged
off as a bad debt. (Items 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5)
(SOR ¶ 1.e) Applicant owes $4,941 for a delinquent credit-card account referred
for collection. (Items 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5)
(SOR ¶ 1.f) Applicant owes $4,111 to a bank for a delinquent credit-card account
charged off as a bad debt. (Items 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5)
(SOR ¶ 1.g) Applicant owes $999 to a store for a delinquent credit-card account
charged off as a bad debt. (Items 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5)
Applicant cancelled his repayment agreement with DRC in April 2020. He stated
in  May  2020  that  he  intended  to  repay  his  creditors.  Based  on  his  May  2021  SOR
response, he admitted each debt but he is now disputing all seven of these accounts. He
did not provide an explanation or a legitimate basis for each of the disputes. He did not
reply or submit documentation in response to the Government’s FORM within the 30-day
time period. There is no evidence to show that he paid, is currently in an arrangement to
pay, or that he successfully and legitimately disputed each delinquent credit-card account.
As such, all of the SOR debts, cited above, are unresolved.
