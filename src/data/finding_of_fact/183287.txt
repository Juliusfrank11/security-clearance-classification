Applicant is a 57-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since 1998. He seeks to retain a security clearance, which he has
held  since  at  least  the  1990s.  He  attended  college  for  a  period  without  earning  a
degree. He has never married, and he has no children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 20-21; GE 1)
Applicant has a history of tax issues. He did not file his federal and state income
tax  returns  for  tax  years  2006  through  2019  when  they  were  due.  His  father  passed
away in late 2006, and Applicant was named his executor. Applicant was working long
hours and put off filing the returns. His long hours continued into the following years. He
did  not  receive  booklets  from  the  IRS  and  his  state,  and  the  whole  thing  just
“snowballed.” (Tr. at 21-23; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1-3)
Applicant reported his failure to file his federal and state tax returns from 2011 to
2017  on  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  that  he  submitted  in
March  2019.  He  wrote  “I  have  not  filed  a  tax  return  since  2006.  If  you  check  my
personnel  file  you  will  see  I  pay  both  federal  and  state  an  extra  $625  ($25  per  pay
check) and with standard deductions they would both owe me money.” (GE 1)
When  he  was  interviewed  for  his  background  investigation  in  May  2019,
Applicant  stated  that  he  did  not  file  his  tax  returns  from  2006  to  2018  because  of
laziness  and  procrastination.  He  stated  that  after  he  did  not  file  the  2006  returns,  he
stopped receiving tax booklets and it became more difficult to file the returns. He stated
that he intended to file his 2017 and 2018 returns by December 31, 2019, and then start
filing the older returns. (Tr. at 24; GE 2)
The  DOD  sent  interrogatories  to  Applicant  requesting  information  about  his  tax
returns.  He  received  the  interrogatories  on  August  20,  2020.  He  was  requested  to
provide  copies  of  his  “TAX  ACCOUNT  TRANSCRIPTS”  for  tax  years  2006  through
2018. He was provided the information on how to obtain the transcripts. He was told not
to  provide  other  documents  in  lieu  of  the  tax  account  transcripts,  including  tax  return
transcripts. (GE 3)
After  an  extension
request  was  granted,  Applicant
the
interrogatories  in  January 2021.  He  indicated  that  he  still had not filed  the  returns.  He
submitted  copies  of  tax  return  transcripts,  not  tax  account  transcripts,  as  requested.
This was simply a mistake on Applicant’s part and not an attempt to hide anything from
the DOD. He reiterated that he did not owe any taxes because he had an extra $25 per
paycheck withheld from his pay. (GE 3)

Applicant responded to the SOR on August 24, 2021, after receiving the SOR the
month before. He still had not filed the returns, but he indicated that he retained a tax
professional and sent his tax information to the professional the previous day to file the
returns.
Applicant’s  documentation   is  less   than   ideal,  but   I  am   satisfied   that  the   tax
professional  filed   Applicant’s  federal  and   state   tax   returns  for  tax   years  2015   through
2020   in  about October   2021.  Applicant  did  not file   the   tax   returns for the   earlier years
because   he   was  told  to   only   go   back  six   years.  Information   from   the   tax   professional
indicates  that  Applicant  would have  been  due  refunds  for 2015  ($306-IRS  and  $1,326-
state);   2016   ($1,366-IRS  and   $1,635-state);   2018   ($1,135-IRS   and   $1,726-state);  and
2020   ($2,649-IRS   and   $1,877-state).  He   owed   additional   federal  taxes  for  2017
($1,227)  and   2019   ($390).   He  was  due   refunds   from   the   state   for  2017   ($1,232)  and
2019 ($1,573).  (Tr. at 16-19, 24, 27-30; Applicant’s response to SOR; AE A, B)
Applicant submitted documentation that he paid the IRS $1,227 (tax year 2017)
and $390 (2019) in October 2021. That same month, he received refunds of $831 and
$2,649  from  the  IRS;  and  1,573,  $1,726,  and  $1,877  from  the  state.  He  paid  the  IRS
$2,590 and $2,983 in June 2022. He received a refund of $2,990 from the IRS for  tax
year 2017 in July 2022. (Tr. at 16; AE A-D)
Applicant credibly stated that he never intended to shirk his responsibility to pay
his  taxes.  He  provided  copies  of  an  uncashed  refund  check  of  $593  he  received  from
the state in May 2006, and an uncashed refund check of $887 he received from the IRS
in  October  2007.  He  stated  that  he  was  working  so  much,  he  never  got  around  to
cashing the checks. (Tr. at 16, 24, 28-30; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1-3; AE E)
Applicant filed his 2021 federal and state income tax  returns. He owes the IRS,
but he has the assets to pay the taxes. His finances are otherwise in good shape, with
more  than $800,000  in  investments  and  retirement  accounts  and no  delinquent  debts.
