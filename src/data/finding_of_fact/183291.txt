Applicant is 48 years old and has never been married. He has a 27-year-old son,
a 21-year-old daughter, and a 17-year-old son. He has been living with his partner since
April 2019. He graduated from high school in 1992. He earned an associate’s degree in
2021, and  he  is currently  working  toward a  bachelor’s degree  in  cybersecurity.  He has
worked for his current employer as a munition mechanic since July 2020. This is his first
security clearance application. (GE 1; GE 2; AE B; Tr. 20-25, 60-61)
The SOR alleged Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in March 2005
(SOR ¶ 1.a) and April 2015 (SOR ¶ 1.b), and his debts were discharged in June 2005
and  July 2015,  respectively.  Additionally,  he  owes  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)
$8,364 for tax year (TY) 2013 (SOR ¶ 1.c), $5,576for TY 2014 (SOR ¶ 1.d), and $3,762
for  TY  2015  (SOR  ¶  1.e).  He  admitted  these  allegations.  He  denied  that  he  owes
municipal  income  taxes  in  the  amount  of  $7,878  (SOR  ¶  1.f).  He  admitted  two  of  the
additional  SOR  debts,  totaling  $1,710  (SOR  ¶¶  1.g  and  1.i)  and  denied  three  debts,
totaling $980 (SOR ¶¶ 1.h, 1.j, and 1.k). (Answer)
Applicant attributes his financial issues to the early 2000s, when he fell behind on
paying child support for his oldest two children to their mothers. He and his oldest son’s
mother had a legal agreement that each of them would claim their son as a dependent
every other year; however, she  consistently received  her W-2 before  him and claimed
their son on the years Applicant was entitled to claim him. His federal tax debt started to
accrue as a result, and he “never rebounded” from this period. At an unrecalled date, he
contacted the IRS, and they put him in a non-collectible status. Additionally, he struggled
to pay his mortgage and other bills, and, as a result, he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy
protection  in 2005.  His  liabilities  totaled $93,066,  and  included  $4,000 of  child  support
payments, $500 of tax debt, and almost $8,500 in other unsecured debt. He has had no
periods of unemployment in the past five years. (GE 2 at 6; GE 9; Tr. 19-20, 25-31, 60,
63)
In  Applicant’s  October 2020  SCA,  he  disclosed  his 2015  Chapter 7  bankruptcy.
Additionally,  he  disclosed  an  unalleged  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  petition  that  he  filed  in
March 2018. He reported no additional bankruptcies, debts, or tax issues. (GE 1; Tr. 66)
In December 2020, Applicant was interviewed by a Government investigator. He
told the investigator that he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in 2015 due to falling
behind on his mortgage and other debts when he lost his job for a few months. His total
liabilities were $60,000, and included over $33,000 in federal and state income tax debt.
He also filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in 2018, because he was overwhelmed
by his child support obligations and other bills. His liabilities were $30,000, and he had
$25,000 in tax debt. He made two  or three bankruptcy payments, but stopped making
payments because he could not afford them, and the bankruptcy was dismissed in June
2019. Applicant discussed SOR ¶¶ 1.g through 1.k with the investigator. (GE 2 at 6-9; GE
3; GE 7; Tr. 63)
Applicant  responded  to  DOHA  interrogatories  in  April  2021,  and  adopted  the
statement  referenced  above.  He  also  provided  IRS  account  statements  for  TY  2011
through 2019. According to these statements:
Balance: $0 (resolved  6/24/2019)
TY 2011: filed late in  October 2012
TY 2012: Filed late in  September 2014   Balance: $0 (resolved  5/4/2020)
TY 2013: Filed late in  February 2015
TY 2014: Filed late in June  2015
TY 2015: (W-2)
TY 2016: Filed late in  May 2017
TY 2017: Filed  April 2018
TY 2018: Filed late in June  2019
TY 2019: Filed in May 2020
Balance: $3,644 (SOR ¶ 1.e)
Balance: $0
Balance: $0
Balance: $0  (GE 2; Tr. 28-30)
Balance: $8,259  (SOR ¶ 1.c)
Balance: $5,506  (SOR ¶ 1.d)
At the hearing, Applicant admitted he failed to file his federal income tax returns in
a timely manner for several years. In addition to his son’s mother claiming  their son on
her  returns  for  years  when  Applicant  was  entitled  to  claim  their  son,  which  affected
Applicant’s  taxes,  he  also  failed  to  have  an  adequate  amount  withheld  from  his
paychecks.  This also contributed to his debt to the IRS. He testified that for several years,
he was in non-collectible status, however, since approximately 2017, he has been in a
payment agreement with the IRS, and is paying $278 monthly directly out of his checking
account. (GE 1; Tr. 20, 28-38)
According  to  Applicant,  his  outstanding  balance  with  the  IRS  is  approximately
$16,000. The documents in the record and the amounts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.c through
1.e, reflect that the balances for some of the TY have decreased. The IRS tax transcripts
reflect that in the past, Applicant established multiple payment agreements, but they were
terminated due to his failure to pay them. Applicant did not provide proof of his payments,
when  the  payments  started,  or  the  number  of  payments  he  has  made.  The  IRS  tax
transcripts reflect credits for overpayment were transferred from TY 2016 to 2019 to TY
2011 to 2013, but no active payments were made to Applicant. (For TY 2016, after an
overpayment  was  transferred  to  TY  2011,  additional  taxes,  interests,  and  fees  were
assessed against Applicant.) The record was left open, in part, to allow him to provide
documentation regarding his payments to the IRS. (GE 2; Tr. 20, 28-38)
Department  Counsel  produced  evidence  that  Applicant
filed  Chapter  13
bankruptcy  protection  in  2001,  2002,  2003,  and  2018.  These  bankruptcies  were
dismissed in March 2003, August 2003, August 2004, July 2018, respectively. Applicant
testified that he did file these bankruptcy petitions, and they were not alleged in the SOR.
I will not consider them as disqualifying conduct, but may consider them in determining if
the mitigating conditions are applicable and in my whole-person analysis. (GE 4; GE 5;
GE 10 – GE 12; Tr. 26-27, 39-40)
None of the debts listed below appear in Applicant’s March 2022 credit report, with
the  exception  of SOR ¶ 1.k. (AE A)
SOR ¶ 1.f (City taxes - $7,878) Applicant testified that he was unaware that these
local taxes were not being deducted from his paycheck from when he lived in State A. He
became aware of this debt when he moved from the area in 2018. When he learned of
the  debt,  he  calculated  how  much  he  believed  he  owed,  and  he  believes  the  balance
should be approximately $3,000. He filed his taxes for the relevant tax year(s), 2015 or
2016,  and the  city did not access this tax until years later. According to  Applicant,  the
statute  of  limitations  is three  years.  He  intends  to  hire  an  attorney  to  represent  him  in
disputing this debt. Applicant resolved this debt. (Answer; Tr. 29-43)
SOR ¶ 1.g (Credit card debt - $1,510) Applicant admitted this debt in his answer
to the SOR, but testified that he believed this debt was included in his 2005 Chapter 7
bankruptcy  filing.  The  record  was  left  open  to  allow  him  to  provide  documentation  to
support  his  claim;  however,  he  did  not  provide  records  regarding  his  bankruptcies.
According to the credit reports in the record, this account was opened in May 2018, and
was placed for collection in November 2020. Although, this debt does not appear in his
most recent credit report, he has not demonstrated that he has resolved it. (GE 3 at 4; Tr.
44-45)
SOR  ¶ 1.h  (Energy debt  - $722) Applicant denied responsibility for this debt.  In
2019, he moved out of the apartment he was renting and notified the utility company to
terminate  his  service.  He  has  disputed  this  debt  with  the  credit  agencies.  Applicant
resolved this debt. (Answer; GE 3 at 4; AE A; Tr. 46-51)
SOR ¶ 1.i (Consumer debt - $200) Applicant admitted responsibility for this debt.
He  purchased a  vacation  in April 2018, for approximately $1,600. He  paid $1,400,  but
was late making his final $200 payment. When he went to make the last payment, the
company would not accept a payment. He is able and willing to pay this debt. Applicant
resolved this debt. (GE 3 at 4; Tr. 51-52)
SOR ¶ 1.j (Medical debt - $56) Applicant did not recognize this debt and disputed
it in 2021. Applicant resolved this debt. (Answer; GE 3 at 5; Tr. 52-54)
SOR ¶ 1.k (Consumer debt - $202) Applicant denied responsibility for this debt,
because it was included in his 2018 Chapter 13 bankruptcy. However, it still appears on
his March 2022 credit report. (Answer; GE 3 at 5; AE A at 24; Tr. 54-56)
Applicant follows a written budget and has a net monthly remainder of $1,679. He
attended credit counseling in conjunction with his various bankruptcies and has attended
an online-financial seminar for credit counseling on an undisclosed date. He earns $29.86
an hour and routinely works ten hours of overtime a week, which is as much as he can
work. He has between $5,000 and $6,000 in savings and over $16,000 in his 401(k). His
current bills and obligations are being paid in a timely manner. (AE C; Tr. 56-62)
As of the hearing date, Applicant’s child support obligation for his youngest son is
current, and it ends in February 2023. His support for his older children is satisfied and
terminated. (Tr. 20, 24-25)
