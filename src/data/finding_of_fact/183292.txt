In  Applicant’s  answer to  the  SOR, he  admitted  the  allegations in  SOR ¶¶  2.a,  2.c-
2.k,   2.m,   and   2.n.  He   denied   the   allegations  in   SOR  ¶¶   1.a-1.f,  2.b   and   2.l.   His
admissions are incorporated in  my findings of  fact.
Applicant  is  a  40-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  received  an
associate’s degree in 2002. (GX 2 at 8.) He married in April 2013 and has two children,
ages six and four. He received a security clearance in March 2002, which was revoked
in May 2014 because of concerns under Guideline F. He told a security investigator that
his  clearance  was  revoked  because  of  a  $200  debt  to  a  department  store  that  was
referred for collection. (GX 4 at 23.) The Appeal Board decision upholding the revocation
recited that the SOR in the case alleged 14 delinquent debts totaling about $40,000, of
which at least $21,000 was unresolved. (HX I at 2.)
Applicant  has  worked  for  defense  contractors  since  January  2005.  He  did  not
report any periods  of  unemployment  in his SCA.  However, during  an  interview  with  a
security investigator in January 2020, he stated that he was unemployed pending  the

outcome of his security clearance background investigation. (GX 4 at 33.) His clearance
was restored in July 2021. (GX 5 at 1.)
The  SOR  alleges  six  delinquent  debts  reflected  in  credit  reports  from  August
2022, February 2021, and August 2020. (GX 7, 8, and 9). The evidence concerning these
debts is summarized below:
SOR ¶  1.a:  auto loan placed for collection of  $38,537.  Applicant bought a  two-
year-old  luxury   car  in   2018.   He  was  unable   to   make   the   payments   and   voluntarily
surrendered   the   car.   When   he   responded   to   DOHA  interrogatories  in  April  2021,   he
stated  that he  surrendered  the  car in February  2021.  (GX  4  at 3.) In his SOR response,
he  stated  that he paid off  this debt in  February  2021. At the hearing,  he  testified  that he
was unable  to  make  the  payments  because  his wife  was not working  outside  the  home
and  he  was assisting   his elderly  parents.   He  testified  that the  car was surrendered  in
mid-2020.  (Tr.  31-32.)  After  the   hearing   he   submitted   evidence   that  he   settled   this
account for less than  the  full balance in August 2022. (AX 10.)
SOR ¶ 1.b: auto loan charged off for $14,508. The August 2022 credit report
reflects  that  this  debt  was  charged  off  for  $11,120,  and  that  the  last  activity  on  the
account was in March 2019. In Applicant’s response to the SOR, he disputed this debt.
He denied ever having a loan from this lender and he stated that he suspected identity
theft. He testified that he hired a law firm to dispute the debt. (Tr. 35.) He submitted no
evidence reflecting that he disputed the debt with the creditor or the credit bureau or that
he reported identity theft to any law enforcement agency. When he was interviewed by
a security investigator in October 2019, he admitted that he incurred the debt with this
creditor  when  he  traded  in  a  2014  model  car  for  a  2016  model,  and  he  told  the
investigator  that  the  debt  had  been  resolved.  (GX  2  at  29.)  After  the  hearing,  he
submitted  documentation  that  the  debt  was  settled  for  less  than  the  full  amount  on
February 10, 2022. (A-11.)
SOR ¶ 1.c: utility bill placed for collection of $753. The February 2021 credit
report reflects that this debt was referred for collection in February 2019. (GX 8 at 2.) It
is  not  reflected  in  the  August  2022  credit  report.  (GX  7.)  After  the  hearing,  Applicant
submitted a statement reciting that he contacted the creditor by telephone and was told
that his account was closed three years ago, which is consistent with the February 2021
credit report reflecting that the original creditor closed the account when it was placed
for collection. However, the evidence does not establish that the collection account was
resolved. Applicant testified that he paid the debt with a credit card, but he did not provide
documentation of payment. (Tr. 39.) The debt is not resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.d: medical bill placed for collection of $257. The credit report from
August 2022 reflects a medical bill referred for collection of $539. It became delinquent
in January 2020 and was assigned for collection in April 2022. (GX 7 at 2.) Applicant’s
account statement from the collection agency, dated November 30, 2021, reflects a zero
balance. (AX 6.) This debt is resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.e:  bank  account  debt  charged  off  for  $63.  This  debt  was  paid  in
January 2020. (AX 5.)
SOR ¶ 1.f: credit union account debt charged off for $2,920. This account was
closed by the credit union and had a zero balance in June 2019. It is resolved. (AX 7.)
The SOR also alleges multiple instances of personal conduct under Guideline E.
The evidence concerning these allegations is summarized below.
SOR ¶ 2a: Termination from employment in June 2021. Applicant was hired
by a former employer as a full-time employee in May 2021. The SOR alleges that he was
terminated  from  employment  for  concealing  that  he  held  at  least  two  full-time  jobs  in
violation of company policy. He admitted this allegation in his answer to the SOR. In his
employment agreement, he agreed that he would not perform services for compensation
for any other entity without the express and written consent of the company president.
(GX 24 at 4.) He was terminated for violation of this provision in June 2021. (GX 22; GX
24 at 4.)
In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he explained that he was helping his wife with
her online business, and that while he was in an online meeting, his employer overheard
him talking to his wife about her business. His supervisor asked him if he was doing other
work, and he admitted that he was helping his wife with her business calls. At the hearing,
he testified that he was promoted from being an engineer to a managerial position, even
though he preferred a hands-on engineering job. With the encouragement of his wife, he
found and accepted a second job where he would work as an engineer. He told the first
employer that he intended to give them a two-week notice and take the second job, and
two days later he received his termination letter. (Tr. 19-21.)
SOR ¶ 2.b: Removal from working on a contract for misusing government
equipment to send inappropriate emails to a female colleague. Applicant denied this
allegation in his answer to the SOR, and explained that he was fired because he used
his  government  computer  to  invite  a  female  colleague  to  have  lunch  together.  At  the
hearing, he testified that the only inappropriate email he sent was to his manager, telling
the  manager  that  he  needed  to  take  off  from  work  for  a  couple  of  days  because  his
girlfriend was cheating on him. (Tr. 21-22.) He admitted that he had a girlfriend for a short
time while he and his wife were having marital difficulties. (Tr. 58-59.)
SOR ¶ 2.c: Falsification of an SCA by failing to disclose the employment and
conduct alleged in SOR ¶ 2.b. During a security interview in October 2019, Applicant
was  questioned extensively about his employment  record, but he was  not questioned
about this incident, and he did not volunteer any information about it. At the hearing, he
testified that he did not disclose this incident in his SCA because the accusation was
false. (Tr. 64.)
SOR ¶ 2.d: Falsification of an SCA by failing to disclose the debts alleged in
SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.f. Applicant admitted this allegation in his answer to the SOR.
When he was confronted with his delinquent debts during a security interview in October
2019, he told the investigator that all the debts were being disputed and that the credit
reports reflecting those debts were erroneous. (GX 4 at 27.) At the hearing, he testified
that he filled out the SCA in the evening when he was tired and suffering from a cold,
and he mistakenly omitted the information. (Tr. 22-23.)
SOR  ¶¶  2.e-2.m:  Traffic  Offenses.  Applicant  admitted  all  the  traffic  offenses
except the offense alleged in SOR ¶ 2.l, which he denied. The evidence concerning these
offenses is summarized below.
SOR ¶ 2.e: Reckless  driving  in December 2015  by  driving  a  vehicle  94 miles per
hour (mph) in a  55  mph  zone. Applicant  pleaded  nolo contendere. He was convicted, his
driver’s license  was suspended  for 90  days,  and  he  paid  a  $500  fine  plus court costs.
(GX  10.) At the  hearing, he  testified  that he  was speeding  because  of  an  emergency  at
work when someone tried to hack into  his employer’s computer network.  (Tr. 70.)
SOR  ¶   2.f:  Following   too   closely   and   driving   without  a   valid   license   in  January
2018. Applicant forfeited collateral of  $163  for the  first offense and  $188  for the second.
(GX  11.)  At the  hearing, he  denied  committing  these  offenses. He testified  that the  police
officer was tailgating  him  and  pulled  him  over because  he  was driving  too  slowly. He was
driving  his wife’s car and did not have his driver’s license with him. (Tr. 24.)
SOR ¶  2.g: Driving  79  mph  in a  55  mph  zone  in April 2018.  Applicant  pleaded
guilty   and  paid   a   $160   fine.   (GX   12.)   At   the   hearing,  he   admitted   this   incident  and
explained that he was  hurrying because he was late  for work. (Tr. 24.)
SOR  ¶   2.h:  Driving   71   mph   in  a   55   mph   zone   in  November  2018.  Applicant
prepaid  $163  in  fines  and  court costs.  (GX  13.)  He testified  that he  was running  late  for
a church event. (Tr. 24-25.)
SOR ¶  2.i: Driving  93  mph  in a  55  mph  zone  in February  2019.  Applicant pleaded
guilty, received  probation  before judgment, and  paid  a  $290  fine  plus  court costs.  (GX
14.)   In   response   to   DOHA  interrogatories,   he   disclosed   that   his   probation   before
judgment  also  included   not   driving   for   30   days.  He  explained   that  he   was  speeding
because he was running late  for a church event. (GX 2  at 6.)
SOR ¶  2.j: Driving  76  mph  in a  55  mph  zone  in June  2019.  Applicant pleaded  not
guilty  but   was   convicted.  The   court  records   do   not  reflect  the   sentence.  (GX   15.)   In
response to DOHA interrogatories, he stated that he was fined  $125. (GX 2 at 6.)  At the
hearing, he  testified  that he  was driving  a  friend’s car and  did not realize  how  fast he  was
driving. (Tr. 25.)
SOR ¶  2.k: Driving  116  mph  in  a  60  mph  zone  in August 2019. Applicant pleaded
guilty. Court records do  not reflect  the  sentence. (GX  16.).  He  testified  that  his  wife  was
pregnant and  had  fallen  down  some  stairs, and  he  was rushing  home  to  care for her. He
testified that he was fined $250. (Tr. 25-26.)
SOR ¶  2.l: Driving  80  mph  in  a  55  mph  zone  in  August 2020  and  driving  in violation
of  a  restricted  suspended  driver’s license. The  record contains no  information  reflecting
these  offenses.  Applicant denied  this  offense  in his answer to  the  SOR.  At  the  hearing,
he  testified  that the  police  were chasing  a  driver with  a  similar car, that the  officer stopped
him  and  realized  that  he  had  stopped  the  wrong  driver, and  that  he  was not charged  with
any offenses. (Tr. 26.)
SOR ¶  2.m: Driving  100  mph  in a  55  mph  zone, unsafe  passing  on  the  right of an
overtaken  vehicle, and  driving  in violation  of  a  restricted  license. Applicant pleaded  not
guilty, but he was convicted  of all three offenses. (GX 17.) He  testified that he  was fined
$530   for  speeding,  $100   for  unsafe   passing,  and   $70   for  violating   the   terms  of   his
restricted   license.   He  testified   that  he   was  not  wearing   his  glasses  at  the   time,  even
though  his driver’s license required it. (Tr. 26-27.)
Uncharged  traffic offenses:  In  November 2021, Applicant was cited  for  driving  103
mph  in  a  55  mph  zone. He denied  driving  100  mph  because  he  has a  device in his car
that   alerts  him   if   he   exceeds  85   miles   per   hour,  and   it  was  not  triggered.  (A-16.)  He
pleaded  guilty  to  speeding  and  paid a  $150  fine. (GX  18; AX  15.) In  July  2022, he  was
charged   with   a   misdemeanor  for   driving   99   mph   in  a   55   mph   zone.  The   citation   was
pending disposition at the time  of the  hearing. (GX 19; Tr. 78.)3
SOR  ¶¶  2.n:  Falsification  of  an  SCA  by  failing  to  disclose  the  traffic
violations involving a fine of $300 or more, alleged in SOR ¶¶ 2.e and 2.k. Applicant
admitted  this  allegation  and  attributed  it  to  being  tired  and  having  a  cold  when  he
completed the SCA. The evidence reflects that he was fined $500 for the offense alleged
in SOR ¶ 2.e. However, the court records do not reflect the amount of the fine imposed
for the offense alleged in SOR ¶ 2.k, and Applicant testified that he was fined $250 for
that offense. The evidence shows that Applicant was fined more than $300 for the traffic
offense alleged in SOR ¶ 2.m, but failure to disclose this violation was not alleged in the
SOR. I conclude that SOR ¶ 2.n is partially established for the traffic offense alleged in
SOR ¶ 2.e but not for the traffic offense alleged in SOR ¶ 2.k.
On August 22, 2020, Applicant completed a four-hour aggressive driver’s course.
(AX 21.) On August 25, 2020, he completed a state-administered driver improvement
program. (Tr. 27-28; AX 17-20, 22, 23.)
Applicant testified that he and his wife currently have joint family income of about
$300,000 per year before taxes, and they have no financial issues. (Tr. 86-87.) About
two months before the hearing, Applicant purchased an expensive sports car financed
with  a  loan  for  $107,000.  (Tr.  80.)  The  monthly  payments  are  about  $2,300.  A  credit

Applicant’s  security  clearance, but they  may  be considered to assess  his  credibility;  to decide  whether  a
particular adjudicative guideline is applicable; to evaluate evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed
circumstances; to consider whether he  has  demonstrated successful  rehabilitation; or as  part of  a whole-
person  analysis. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). I have considered the evidence

report from August 19, 2022, reflected that the car payments were past due for $2,327.
(GX 7.) Applicant asserted that the credit report was erroneous. (Tr. 81.)
