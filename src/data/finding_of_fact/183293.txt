(Transcript (Tr.) 16-20; GE 1)
Applicant has a history of financial problems,  including eight years of  not timely
filing  his  federal  income  tax  returns  and  owing  delinquent  federal  income  taxes.  The
SOR  alleges  untimely  filed  tax  returns  for  the  2012  through  2019  tax  years  and
delinquent  federal  taxes  totaling  $10,389  for  those  same  tax  years.  In  his  Answer,
Applicant admitted the SOR allegations with additional comments. The SOR allegations
are established through  Applicant’s admissions and the Government’s evidence. (Ans.;
GE 1, 2)
Despite  divorcing  her in 2000,  Applicant continued  to  reside  with  his ex-wife  until
about January  2018. Applicant believed  his ex-wife  was responsible  for filing  his federal
income  tax  returns until  this time.  He claimed  he  was not  aware that he  was behind  on
filing  his federal  tax  returns  or paying  his federal taxes  until  January  2018, when  he  had
a  falling  out with  his ex-wife. At that time, he  claims that he  learned  that he  had  not filed
his federal income  tax  returns for the  “three  previous years.”  In  June  or July  of  2018, he
reviewed   his  financial   documents  and   determined   that  he   had   not  filed   his  federal
income   tax   returns  for  all   the   tax   years  listed   in   the   SOR.  He  claimed   that  he
immediately  went to  a  CPA  to  help him  file  his late  tax  returns and  make  payments on
his late  taxes. He claimed  that,  with  the  help  of  his CPA, he   has now  mailed  all  of his
delinquent  federal  tax  returns  to  the  IRS.  He  claimed  that  he  started  making  payments
on   his  late   taxes  in  about  2019   or  2020,  at   about  the   time   his  interim   clearance   was
granted.   He   claimed   that   he   tried   to   make   automatic  predetermined   payment
arrangements  with   the   IRS,   but  they   “are not  allowing   that   now.”   (Tr.16-17,   20-35,   38-
39; GE 1, 2; AE  A-C)
There  is  documentary  evidence  from  a  commercial  tax  filing  service  that
Applicant  submitted  his  2019  and  2020  federal  income  tax  returns  on  July  14,  2021.
Applicant claimed that he filed his 2016 and 2017 federal income tax returns in August
2021. He provided documents from a commercial tax filing service that arguably confirm
these late submissions. He provided a receipt from the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) that
he claimed  is evidence that he mailed his 2013 and 2018 federal income tax return to
the  IRS  in  August  2022.  He  also  provided  documents  from  the  IRS  showing  that  he
made  payments  on  his  delinquent  taxes  for  tax  years  2012,  2014,  2015,  and  2021.
These  IRS  documents  confirm  that  Applicant  filed  his  federal  income  tax  returns  for
those tax years, but, with the exception of the 2012 tax year, there is no documentary
evidence in the record showing that Applicant filed any of his late income tax returns or
made any payments on his delinquent taxes until after the SOR was issued. (Tr. 26-34;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2; AE A-C)
With  respect  to  the   2012  tax  year, Applicant  provided  a  document  from the  IRS
from   December  2020,  showing   that  he   owed   $6,850.65   for   his  2012   taxes.   This
document confirms  that he  filed  his 2012  tax  return but  does not confirm  when  he  filed
it.   There  is  no   documentary   evidence   that  Applicant  filed   his  2012   income   tax   return
until  after  he   submitted   his  Questionnaire   for  National   Security   Positions  (SF  86)  and
had   his  security   interview.   His  testimony   is   consistent  with   this  timeline.   He   did  not
provide   documentation   showing   that  any   of   the   late   federal  income   tax   returns  for  the
2013, 2016, 2017,  2018, 2019, and  2020  tax  years had  been  acknowledged  by  the  IRS.
There is no  evidence  that Applicant requested,  or the  IRS  granted,  a  filing  extension  for
any of the tax years relevant to  the SOR. (Tr. 21-32; 38-39; GE 2; AE A, C)
Applicant provided  documents from  the  IRS  showing  that he  made  two  payments
totaling  about $1,263  on his 2012  federal tax obligation in September 2022. He provided
an  undated  document from  the  IRS  reflecting  that he  owed  $7,107.78  for the  2012  tax
year and   $2,407.25  for the   2021   tax   year. He  provided   documentary   evidence   that  he
made  a  payment of  about $640  towards his  2014  federal taxes on  July  9, 2021  and  a
payment   of  about  $400   towards  his  2015   federal   taxes  the   following   week.  (Tr.  30;
Applicant’s response  to SOR; AE A, C)
During  the  hearing,  Applicant  had  difficulty  recalling  information  about  his  tax
filing and  payment history.  He  acknowledged  that  his wife  currently handles  his taxes,
as his ex-wife did before. He claimed  that he is a  “workaholic,” is often  on  the  road for
work,  and  doesn’t  handle  his  own  finances.  He  claimed  that  he  has  learned  from  his
past  financial  mistakes  and  they  will  not  happen  in  the  future  because  he  has  an
accountant and has set up an LLC for his business. (Tr. 21-34; 37-39; GE 2; AE A, C)
