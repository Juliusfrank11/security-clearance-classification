Applicant admitted some of the allegations and denied others. His admissions are
incorporated into these findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I
make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer as a heavy equipment operator since October 2003. He worked on
the commercial side of the operation until 2020, when he was asked by the company to
complete a security clearance application (SCA) so that he could receive a clearance and
work  on  the  government-contract  side  of  the  company.  His  job  location  is  at  various
locations in the world out at sea. He works 30 days on shift and then 30 days off shift. He
is not paid when he is off shift. (Tr. 6, 38-39, 48, 50; GE 1)
Applicant  served  honorably  in  the  U.S.  Marine  Corps  from  1995  to  1999  and
included a tour as an U.S. Embassy guard. He has been married 22 years and has three
adult children. His wife does not work outside the home.  He is a high school graduate.
(Tr. 33, 43-44, 47; GE 1-2)
The SOR alleged that Applicant had a tax debt and 26 past due, collection, and
charged-off  debts  totaling  approximately  $47,588.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.aa)  The  debts  are
established  by  Applicant’s admissions, court document, and entries on two credit reports.
(Tr. 40; GE 1-5; Answer to SOR)
Applicant explained that his delinquent debts were exacerbated by several events
that put him into financial difficulties. In 2018, he experienced a medical situation involving
blood  clots  that  resulted  in  hospitalization  and  four  months  off  from  work  with  no  pay.
Also, in 2017 or 2018 his father passed away, and Applicant was burdened with paying
his  funeral  expenses.  In  2019,  he  lost  his  brother  in  an  accident  and  also  became
responsible for his final expenses. He had to use high interest loans to pay for the funeral
expenses. Additionally, his workday shifts were cut back. Applicant explained that most
of his debts accrued prior to 2020 before he was seeking a clearance. Once he submitted
his  SCA  and  realized  his  financial  history  was  significant,  he  began  making  efforts  to
address his delinquent debts. This task proved more difficult because of his “at sea” job
where access to the internet was limited to nonexistent and cell phone use was prohibited.
He has paid several debts, established payment plans on others, and hired a debt relief
company (DRC) to help address some debts. (Tr. 33-34, 39, 41, 50-51, 54, 56-58, 66-67)
The status of Applicant’s delinquent debts is as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a-$3,000. The SOR originally alleged this as a state tax debt, however,
the  amendment  and  evidence  established  that  this  was  a  federal  tax  debt.  Applicant
presented documentation showing he had no state tax debt. Once Applicant was advised
that this was a federal tax debt, he contacted the IRS about how to pay this debt. This
debt is being resolved. He has filed all of his tax returns. (Tr. 59-60; AE A, S)
SOR ¶ 1.b-$1,350. Applicant entered into a payment agreement with the creditor
in June 2022 and documented both the agreement and his first payment of $100 on June
20, 2022. This debt is being resolved. (AE B; Answer to SOR)
SOR  ¶  1.c-$23,890.  This  debt  arises  out  of  an  automobile  purchase  Applicant
made in approximately 2016-2017. After the purchase, Applicant had serious mechanical
problems with the car. He voluntarily turned it into the dealership and heard nothing further
about  it  until his  security clearance  case brought  it  up.  Documentation  shows  that  this
debt is included in his DRC agreement. This debt is being resolved. (GE 2, p. 6); AE C
(See Exhibit A).
SOR ¶ 1.d-$6,803. Applicant incurred this debt when he was out of work for four
months  due  to  medical  reasons  and  his  landlord  began  eviction  proceedings  on  the
residence Applicant and his family were renting. He documented that this debt is included
in his payment plan with the DRC. This debt is being resolved. (Tr. 41; AE C (See Exhibit
A); Answer to SOR)
SOR  ¶¶  1.e-$1,700;  1.f-$2,418;  1.g-$758;  1.h-$677;  1.i-$669;  1.l-$553;  1.m-
$517. These consumer debts went delinquent when Applicant was out of work for four
months because of medical reasons and when he had his work hours cut as described
above.  He  has  enrolled  all  six  debts  into  his  DRC  payment  plan  and  documented
payments on two debts included in the plan. These debts are being resolved. (Tr. 39-41;
AE C (See Exhibit A), U)
SOR ¶¶ 1.j-$656; 1.k-$598. Applicant took out these consumer loans to help pay
for  his  father’s  and   brother’s  funeral  expenses.  His  other  siblings  were  not  able  to
contribute. They went delinquent when his work hours were reduced and he experienced
medical problems. He settled both debts in June 2022. These debts are resolved. (AE N,
O, P, T)
SOR ¶¶ 1.n-$482; 1.o-$425; 1.s-$252; 1.t-$102; 1.u-$89; 1.v-$75; 1.x-$60; 1.y-
$60; 1.z-$56. These medical debts became  delinquent  after Applicant’s medical problems
and his subsequent four-month layoff. He has consolidated these debts and documented
making payments on this account. These debts are being resolved. (AE G-J)
SOR ¶ 1.p-$401. Applicant set up a payment plan for this consumer debt and made
one payment under the plan in June 2022. This debt is being resolved. (AE E)
SOR ¶ 1.q-$356. Applicant set up a payment plan for this consumer debt and made
one payment under the plan in June 2022. This debt is being resolved. (AE F)
SOR ¶ 1.r-$278. Applicant paid this debt in June 2022. This debt is resolved. (AE
D)
SOR  ¶  1.w-$75.  Applicant  disputed  this  debt  and  verified  with  the  collection
company handling the debt that it was not among the medical debts owed by Applicant.
This debt has little, if any, security significance. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 73; AE H, p. 3)
SOR  ¶  1.aa-$623.  Applicant  set  up  a  payment  plan  for this consumer debt and
made one payment under the plan in June 2022. This debt is being resolved. (AE K)
Applicant credibly testified that he is in good financial shape right now. His monthly
gross income is approximately $8,500, and he is in a good position to continue to make
his $377 bi-weekly payments to his DRC plan and his other monthly debt payments. He
has  not  incurred  any  new debt  and  he  is paying  all  his  current  bills  on  time.  All of  his
federal and state tax returns have been filed on time. He intends to continue making his
debt payments so that he can continue to work on the company’s government contracts.
(Tr. 48, 58, 60, 69-70, 65, 80; AE C)
Applicant  provided  a  character  letter  from  a  coworker  who  has  recently  worked
with him. The coworker states that Applicant is the hardest working, most dedicated crew
member.  He  highly   regards  Applicant’s  professionalism.  Applicant  also  presented  his
June  2022  job  performance  appraisal  where  he  was  rated  at  the  highest  level  (#5-
commendable) in all categories. (AE Q-R)
