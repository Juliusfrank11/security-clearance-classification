Applicant  is  a  31-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor,  employed  since
March 2021. When he completed his SCA, he was employed by a Government contractor
as  a  cyber-security  consultant.  He  was  unemployed  for  periods  while  attending
undergraduate  and  graduate  schools.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2013,  and  a
master’s degree in 2015. He is unmarried. He was granted a secret security clearance in
2015.
The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant is indebted on five student loans
placed  for  collections,  totaling  $22,663  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.d,  and  1.f); a  charged-off  credit
account totaling $3,037 (SOR ¶ 1.e); and two medical collection accounts totaling $1,541
(SOR ¶¶ 1.g and 1.h). Applicant admitted all of the delinquent accounts except for one
medical debt (SOR ¶ 1.h), which he denied as “no longer delinquent.” (Ans.) The record
evidence is sufficient to support the SOR allegations.
When  he  completed  his  SCA,  the  only  delinquencies  Applicant  reported  were
$26,000  in  student  loans.  He  noted  that  he  was  making  payments  through  a  wage
garnishment. In his personal subject interview (PSI) by a security investigator, he noted
that although he had a garnishment order from March to May 2020, the garnished amount
was refunded to him, possibly due to pandemic relief. He was unaware that the student
loans were in a collection status and believed his loans were never delinquent. (GE 6)
His 2020 credit report shows the student loan accounts as past due since 2017, and sold
or transferred by Fedloan, and placed for collections by the U.S. Department of Education
in about 2020. (GE 7)
The charged-off credit account was placed for collection in about October 2020.
(GE 7) Applicant was unaware of the account when interviewed, but noted an intent to
investigate  it  and  pay  it  if  necessary.  (GE  6)  The  two  medical  debts  were  placed  for
collections  in  about  2020.  (GE  7)  Applicant  was  unaware  of  the  debts  when  he  was
interviewed. In his Answer to the SOR, he claimed that one medical debt was no longer
delinquent, but he provided no evidence in support of his claim.
In his PSI, Applicant acknowledged the debts, and claimed that he was “in pretty
good shape financially.” He stated that he earns about $84,000 per year gross, $54,000
net; has about $3,025 in monthly expenses; and had about $340,000 in home value and
a checking account with $3,500. Notably, Applicant vacationed in foreign destinations in
2012 and 2019.
