The  SOR  alleges  17  delinquent  debts,  including  federal  tax  debts  for  tax  years
2011, 2015, and 2018. The evidence concerning the debts is summarized below.
SOR ¶ 1.a: federal tax debt of $3,050 for tax year 2011. Applicant testified that
he worked overseas for six months and then vacationed in another overseas country for
four months, erroneously thinking that the four months  of overseas vacation  continued
his eligibility for tax-exempt status. He started a payment plan with the IRS in May 2021,
with  one  $250  payment  and  followed  by  monthly  $750  payments.  After  three  or  four
months, he  stopped making payments when his ex-wife passed away and he became
financially responsible for his daughter, who had been living with her mother. (Tr. 37-40.)
He made a payment of $2,803 on September 15, 2022. (AX G.) The debt is resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.b:  federal  tax  debt  of  $2,790  and  failure  to  file  for  tax  year  2015.
Applicant testified that he was living in a high-cost area in 2015, and when he computed
his taxes, he found that he could not afford to pay them. (Tr. 43-44.) He filed this return
in March 2021. (Tr. 60-61.) He did not submit any evidence of payments on this tax debt.
SOR ¶ 1.c: federal tax debt of $509 for tax year 2018.  Applicant testified that
this  debt  was  for  tax  preparation  and  that  he  did  not  pay  it  immediately  because  his
financial situation was uncertain, and then he forgot about it. (Tr. 46-47.) This debt was
paid on September 16, 2022. (AX E; AX F.)
SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e: medical debt placed for collection of $4,130.  Applicant
testified that this debt was incurred when he suffered a back injury and his insurance did
not pay the full amount.  As of  the date  of  the  hearing,  he had  not  taken  any action  to
resolve this debt. (Tr. 49-50.)
SOR ¶ 1.e: medical debt placed for collection of $2,699. Applicant testified that
this debt was incurred for ambulance service after he was injured in a gym, and it was not
covered by insurance. As of the date of the hearing, he had not taken any action to resolve
this debt. (Tr. 51.)
SOR ¶ 1.f: debt to jewelry store placed for collection of $548. Applicant testified
that this debt was for jewelry, and it became delinquent when he could not afford to pay
it. The debt was not resolved because he forgot about it. (Tr. 52.)
SOR ¶ 1.g: credit card account placed for collection of $399. Applicant testified
that he could not remember how this debt was incurred. (Tr. 53.) It is not resolved.
SOR ¶¶ 1.h-1.l: student loans placed for collection of $7,568; $5,158; $157;
$3,677; and $8,276. Applicant testified that he incurred these loans for his own education,
and they became delinquent in 2017.  He  consolidated his loans in  2020 but could not
afford the payments. He applied for consolidation again in 2021, which was approved, but
he did not make any payments after the consolidation. At present, he is not making any
payments because of the COVID-19 deferment. He testified that he has saved $35,000
to pay off the loans in a lump sum by the end of 2022. (Tr. 55-60.)
SOR ¶ 1.m: collection account for $532.  Applicant was unable to identify this
debt at the hearing. It is not resolved. (Tr. 61.)
SOR ¶ 1.n: collection account for $188. Applicant testified that this was a utility
bill and that he had made arrangements to pay it in full. (Tr. 62.) He submitted no evidence
that he made any payments. It is not resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.o: past-due rent placed for collection of $1,658. Applicant testified that
this debt was incurred because he did not give a rental agency a 30-day notice before he
moved out and deployed. It is not resolved. (Tr. 62.)
SOR ¶ 1.p: medical debt placed for collection of $226. Applicant provided no
information about this debt. It is not resolved. (Tr. 63.)
SOR  ¶  1.q:  utility  bill  placed  for  collection  of  $124.  Applicant  provided  no
information about this debt. It is not resolved. (Tr. 63.)
Applicant testified that he currently earns about $60,000 per year, which is exempt
from  federal  income  taxes  because  he  is  overseas.  (Tr.  35.)  His  contract  provides  for
base pay of $10.00 per hour, with an overtime rate of 125% of base pay, holiday pay of
200% of base pay, and a completion bonus of 10% of base pay for regular hours worked
at the completion of the 12-month contract. (AX C.) His gross monthly pay for the two-
week period ending on August 27, 2022, was $1,629. (AX D.)
When Applicant’s ex-wife passed away in 2021, his daughter began living with a
grandparent, and his child-support obligation of about $400-450 per month stopped. He
opened a joint bank account with his daughter, and he deposits about $250 per month
into the account. (Tr. 65-66.) In addition, he sends his disabled mother a total of about
$3,000 per year, and he sends his disabled father about $6,000 per year. (Tr. 67-68.) He
sent his son $3,000 last Christmas. (Tr. 69.)
Applicant met his most recent wife in 2018 through social media. He was on active
duty in the USAR at the time, and he took leave for five weeks to meet with her in Nigeria.
He  proposed  marriage,  she  accepted,  and  they  were  married  in  Nigeria.  Applicant
returned to his overseas duty station, and his wife came to the United States in March
2021 on a temporary green card. She stayed with Applicant’s mother for a while and then
moved  out  in  June  2021.  However,  his  ex-wife  continues  to  use  Applicant’s  mother’s
address as a point of contact. His ex-wife has two children, ages 11 and 6, who stayed in
Nigeria with her family. He has no feelings of obligation for her children.
Applicant  decided   that   a   divorce  was  “the   right  thing   to   do”  because   they   were
unable to  live  together. They  were divorced  in January  2022. The  terms of  the  divorce
included  a  payment of $11,000  to  his wife  to  make  sure that she  was financially  stable.
(AX  A; Tr. 25-26.) He  remains  in  contact  with  his  ex-wife,  talking  to  her every  week or
two. His ex-wife’s green  card will expire  in March 2023, and  he  expects that she  will return
to   Nigeria.  Applicant   testified   that  he   wrote   a   letter  to   U.S.  immigration   authorities,
requesting  that any  application  for a  permanent green  card be  denied. (Tr. 28.) His ex-
wife’s father is deceased, and her mother has no connection to the  Nigerian  government
or military. (Tr. 30-34.)
Nigeria  is  a  federal  republic  with  an  elected  president.  It  faces  serious  security
challenges due to armed Islamist insurgencies, cybercrime, terrorism, and violent crime.
There  are  significant  human  rights  abuses  in  Nigeria,  including  arbitrary  killings  by
government  and  non-state  actors,  forced  disappearances,  and  arbitrary  arrest  or
detention.  The  Department  of  State  has  issued  a  Level  3  (Reconsider  Travel)  travel
advisory due to crime, terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, and maritime crime.
