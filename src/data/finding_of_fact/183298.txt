Applicant was unemployed from December 2016 to August 2017, after she was
fired from her employment as a crew leader at a food processing facility. As of the date
of  the  hearing,  she had  worked  for her employer, a  DOD contractor, since  September

The SOR alleged that Applicant had two delinquent student loans totaling $30,599
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c), seven delinquent consumer debts totaling $30,448 (SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.e,
1.h, 1.m, 1.o, 1xx, 1.yy), and 42 delinquent medical debts totaling $14,587 (SOR ¶¶ 1.d,
1.f,  1.g,  1.i  - 1.l,  1.n,  1.p  - 1.ww).  The  SOR  allegations  are  established  by  Applicant’s
admissions in her Answer, in her October 2020 security clearance application (SCA), and
in her January 2021 background interview; and by credit bureau reports from 2020 and
2022. All of the SOR debts are reported on the 2020 credit bureau report. SOR debts ¶¶
1.a, 1.c, 1.o, and 14 medical debts totaling $7,157 are reported on the 2022 credit bureau
report. The 2022 credit bureau report reflects that Applicant paid six medical debts totaling
$3,120. (Answer; GE 1-4)
Applicant attributed her delinquent debts to the following factors: (1) her period of
unemployment from December 2016  to  August  2017;  (2) minimal income  from  August
2017  to  September  2020;  (3)  medical  issues  related  to  a  condition  for  which  she  was
diagnosed in 2014, the birth of her eldest child in 2015, and medical expenses incurred
during  her  period  of  unemployment  when  she  did  not  have  medical  insurance;  (4)
personal issues, to include moving costs she incurred in 2021 when she left her children’s
father;  and  (5)  being  a  single  mother  of  three  children.  She  acknowledged  that  her
financial mismanagement also contributed to her delinquent debts. (Tr. at 22-30, 50-55,
60-61; GE 1, 4)
Applicant  earned  approximately  $45,000  annually  from  December  2014  to
December 2016, before becoming unemployed. When she experienced medical issues
related to the birth of her eldest child in November 2015, she took leave for approximately
six months. She received short-term disability insurance for one month and was unpaid
for five months. She sought paid family and medical leave under the Family and Medical
Leave Act (FMLA), and she was fired for falsifying her FMLA documentation. As of her
SCA, her continued financial difficulties prevented her from taking action to resolve her
debts. She stated therein that she planned  to do so and was working on repairing her
credit.  She  indicated  during  her  background  interview  that  she  paid  several  minimal
delinquent  accounts,  but  acknowledged  that  she  had  a  number  of  outstanding  debts
remaining.  She  planned  to  resolve  her  delinquent  debts  by  contacting  the  creditors  to
negotiate settlements and through debt consolidation. (Tr. at 22-30, 50-55, 60-61; GE 1,
4)
Student Loans
SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.c are for two delinquent federal student loans totaling $30,599.
Applicant  indicated  during  her  background  interview  that  her  student  loans,  during  the
COVID-19 pandemic, were placed in deferment until May 2021. She testified that since
speaking  with  a  U.S.  Department  of  Education  (DOE)  representative  in  approximately
2020 about placing her student loans in deferment, she believed that her student loans
were deferred. She did not understand why they were reported as delinquent while they
were in deferment. She intended to set up a payment plan to repay her student loans.
She also testified that an unrecalled amount of her student loans were associated with a
college that went out of business, and she was in the process of trying to obtain student
loan  forgiveness  for  the  associated  student  loans  since  speaking  with  the  DOE
representative in 2020. (Tr. at 21-22, 30-34, 55-58; GE 4)

bureau report. (Tr. at 44-48; GE 1-4; AE E)
