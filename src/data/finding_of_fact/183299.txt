Based on the testimony and record evidence presented at the hearing, I make
the  following  findings  of  fact.  The  July  2021  SOR  alleges  under  paragraph  1.a  that
Applicant  used marijuana at  varying  frequency between  June 2000  and  June  2020.  In
his July 2021 answer, he admitted the allegation, but noted there were breaks in usage
and the total number of marijuana uses was in the “low single digits.” He indicated that
other  than  his  marijuana  use,  he  never  violated  federal  law  in  any  way.  The  use  of
marijuana  never  felt  comfortable,  and  he  had  no  desire  to  use  the  drug  in  the  future.
(July 2021 answer to SOR)
The  SOR  alleges  under  paragraph  1.b  that  Applicant  used marijuana  after he
was  granted  access to  classified  information  on  March 21, 2006, and on February 10,
2016.  Applicant  admitted  paragraph  1.b,  but  presented  no  additional  comment  to
explain his admission.
Paragraph 2.a of the SOR alleges that Applicant provided false information on
his September 2015 e-QIP by answering “No” to the Section 23 question of illegal drug
use  in  the  last  7  years,  and  by  answering  “No”  to  illegal  drug  use  while  possessing  a
security  clearance.  Applicant  admitted  providing  false  information,  but  claimed  it
resulted  from  misunderstanding  the  seven-year  question.  He  remembered  telling  the
Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  investigator  that  he  had  used  marijuana
previously, but not in the last seven years. The investigator told him not to worry about
his  use.  Applicant  still  believed  the  seven-year  period  applied  to  the  second  question
(illegal  use  of  drugs  with  a  security  clearance),  even  though  “it  (the  security  question)
clearly  included  the  word  “EVER,”  referring  to  any  past  use.  Applicant  acknowledged
illegal drug use, but contended that it took place outside the previous seven years. (July
2021 answer to SOR)
Paragraph  2.b  of  the  SOR  alleges  that  in  his  August  2005  security  clearance
application  (SCA),  Applicant  answered  “No”  to  question  27  asking  whether  he  used
illegal  drugs  since  the  age  of  16  or  in  the  last  7  years.  In  admitting  the  allegation,
Applicant  characterized  his  negative  answer  as  a  miscalculation.  In  August  2005,  he
recalled  using  marijuana  once  in  his  life,  but  he  was  unsure  when.  Because  he  only
remembered a  single  use many years ago,  he  determined  it  was  outside  the  previous
seven  years.  Upon  current  reconsideration  of  when  he  last  used  marijuana,  his  best
estimate was that the use occurred in the middle of 2000. Applicant emphasized that he
never intentionally furnished false information on a security clearance application. (July
2021 answer to SOR)
Applicant is  46  years old.  From  1994  to  1997,  he  earned  three  years of college
credits but no  degree. From  1997  to  1999, he  received  additional college  credits at two
other  colleges  but  no   degree.   (GE  2   at   9,   Tr.   13,  16)  He  has  been   married   since
September  2010   and   has  two   minor  children,  an   11-year-old  daughter  and   a   seven-
year-old  son.  Since   1997,  he   has  been   employed   by   a   defense   contractor  as  an
estimator.  Applicant  was  granted   a   security   clearance   in  March   2006,  June   2010,  and
February 2016. He has owned his home since April 2011. (GE 1  at 9-18, 33)
The  allegation  of  marijuana  use  set  forth  in  SOR  1.a  is  based  on  Applicant’s
February  2021  e-QIP  where  he  admitted  that  he  used  marijuana  from  June  2000  to
June 2020. He described the frequency of use as approximately every couple of years.
He  indicated  that  he  used  marijuana  while  he  held  a  security  clearance.  He  did  not
intend to use marijuana in the future. Applicant commented that “[marijuana] doesn’t do
much for me. Every couple of years or so I think it might be better and I try it again. But
it’s always the same, just don’t’ see the point.” (GE 1 at 31)
Applicant’s  admissions  about  illegal  marijuana  use  and  use  while  holding  a
security clearance in his February 2021 e-QIP contradict his negative responses in his
September  2015  e-QIP  to  using  illegal  drugs  in  the  last  seven  (7)  years,  and  never
using drugs while possessing a security clearance. (SOR 2.a) (GE 2 at 30) Applicant’s
February  2021  drug  admissions  are  also  inconsistent  with  his  negative  response  to
Question 27 of his August 2005 e-QIP requiring disclosure of information of illegal drug
use since the age of 16 or in the last 7 years. (SOR 2.b) (GE 3 at 4)
At the April 2022 hearing, Applicant was questioned further about his history of
marijuana use. He claimed that he used the drug no more than four times in his lifetime,
which is less than half as many times as he disclosed in his February 2021 e-QIP. (Tr.
11-12)
Applicant  testified  that  his  first  use  of  marijuana  occurred  after  returning  from
college  in  1997.  Then  he  testified  the  first  use  may  have  occurred  between  1997  and
1999.  Then  he  testified  he  could  not  remember  when  the  first  use  took  place.
Notwithstanding his inability to recall when he began using marijuana, he indicated that
he used the drug with  a group of friends at someone’s house after a holiday party. (Tr.
17)
Applicant’s second marijuana use occurred the following year in probably 1998
or 1999, in a similar situation. He accepted someone’s offer of the drug. He claimed the
effect of his second use was just as unimpressive as his first use. (Tr. 18)
In  2007  or  2008,  Applicant’s  third  use  of  marijuana  occurred  at  his  parents’
summer house in a state where marijuana had been recently legalized. His parents had
obtained  a  chocolate  edible  mixed  with  marijuana  from  a  dispensary.  Having  been
granted  his  security  clearance  in  March  2006,  Applicant  knew  that  his  marijuana  use
was inconsistent with his federal security clearance responsibilities. Applicant compared
the  edible  to  “chewing  a  stick”  and  has  not  used  marijuana  in  edible  form  since.  He
decided to use the drug because, as noted earlier, the state had recently legalized the
drug, and he was not really thinking about his security clearance responsibilities at the
time he used the drug. (Tr. 18-19, 23-24)
After  a  social  event  with  neighbors  in  June  2020,  Applicant  and  his  wife
returned home. She pulled out a vape pen that she said she had received from a friend
in high school. She had occasionally used marijuana in Applicant’s presence in the past,
but  this was  the first  time he used the drug with  her. He  was  at  home  engaging in  an
experimental  method  of  using  the  drug,  and  was  not  thinking  about  his  security
clearance  at  the  time.  Because  he  could  not  taste  the  flavor  the  pen  produced,  he
decided that he did not like it. Applicant testified that his security clearance is not at the
“forefront of most things I do on a daily basis.” He periodically thinks about his security
clearance  at  work,  but  otherwise  he  does  not  think  about  the  clearance  regularly.  (Tr.
19-20, 26-28)
Applicant  was  asked  about  the  scope  and  frequency  of  his  marijuana  use
between June 2000 and June 2020. He read the relevant portion of his February 2021
e-QIP  describing  his  use  of  marijuana  about  every  two  years  over  the  twenty-year
period.  Applicant  disagreed  with  his  statements  by  indicating  he  should  have  taken
more time and explained that  his use  was  about four  times over a period of  20 years.
Subsequently,  he  stated  that  he  described  his  marijuana  use  inadequately  in  that  he
believed his reply appearing in the e-QIP was focused on the overall number of years.
Therefore, in Applicant’s opinion, he only used marijuana twice between June 2000 and
June 2020. He was not really considering his lifetime total marijuana usage. The June
2000  date  was  an  estimate  as  to  when  he  began  marijuana  use.  He  believed  the
beginning  use  was  closer  to  1997.  Although  he  testified  earlier  in  the  hearing  that  he
used marijuana twice between 1997 and 1999, once in 2007 or 2008, and once in June
2020,  he  did  not  disclose  that  use  in  his  February  2021  e-QIP  because  of  “poor
wording,” “averaging  it  out,” over the  period  rather that stating  the  number of  times he
used the drug. No additional clarifying information was provided. (GE 1 at 31; Tr. 28-30,
34-35)
Applicant  testified  that  he  did  not  intend  to  use  marijuana  in  the  future.
However,  he  was  unable  to  state  that  he  would  not  use  the  drug  after  he  retires  to  a
state with warmer weather. Given that he has not been awed by his use of the drug four
times in the past, he did not see a need to use the drug in the future.  Even though his
security clearance  is a growing factor in  not using marijuana,  the  primary factor still is
that he does not like marijuana. (Tr. 30-31)
Although  Applicant  unequivocally  stated  in  his  February  2021  e-QIP  that  he
used marijuana approximately every two years between June 2000 and June 2020,  he
testified  that  he  only  used  the  drug  twice  during  the  period.  Though  he  admitted
falsifying  the  two  questions  on  his  2015  e-QIP  concerning  drug  use,  and  using  drugs
while possessing a security clearance, he claimed the negative answers resulted from
misunderstanding  the  questions  asked,  rather  than  deliberately  falsifying  his  answers.
Though  he  admitted  falsifying  the  drug  use  question  in  his  2005  e-QIP,  his  negative
answer was the result of a miscalculation, and not deliberately falsifying his answer. He
was unsure when his last use of the drug occurred. In light of Applicant’s five years of a
college  education,  his  employment  with  a  defense  contractor  for  about  24  years,  his
possession of a security clearance for  at least 14 years, his knowledge that marijuana
use is illegal at the federal level and inconsistent with holding a security clearance, I do
not  consider  his  discrepant  and  ambiguous  accounts  of  his  drug  history  and  the
explanations for his falsifications to be credible.
