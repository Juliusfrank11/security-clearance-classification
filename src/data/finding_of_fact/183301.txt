Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations in his Answer. He is 61 years old.
He married in 2002 and divorced in 2017. The first security clearance application in the
record is from October 2011 (SCA 1), and the second is from February 2020 (SCA 2).
As of the date of SCA 2, he did not have any children. He owned a previous home from
2005  to  2010.  He  purchased  another  home  in  February  2015,  and  his  ex-spouse  has
been  the  sole  resident  since  their  separation  in  June  2016.  He  obtained  a  bachelor’s
degree in 1983 and a master’s degree in 1987. (GE 1, 2, 3, 4)
Applicant served honorably in the U.S. military on active duty from 1983 to 1992.
He served honorably in the reserves from  1994 to 2011. He worked for the DOD from
1998 to 1999. He has worked for various DOD contractors since approximately 2008, to
include periods in which he worked in Afghanistan  from March 2011 to May 2013  and
February 2014 to June 2016. He was unemployed, after a layoff, from December 2009
to March 2011. He was also unemployed from May 2013 to September 2013 and June
2016 to December 2016, after resigning from his positions in Afghanistan. As of SCA 2,
he worked as a senior advisor for his employer, a DOD contractor, since July 2019. He
was first granted a security clearance in approximately 1984. (GE 2, 3, 4)
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  petitioned  for  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  in  May
2020, in which he claimed approximately $331,810 in outstanding liabilities, and that his
bankruptcy  petition  was  dismissed  in  June  2020  based  upon  his  motion  for  dismissal
(SOR  ¶  1.a).  It  also  alleged  that  he  had  six  delinquent  consumer  debts,  totaling
$322,575  (SOR  ¶¶  1.b  –  1.g).  In  addition  to his admissions  in his Answer,  Applicant’s
bankruptcy case and consumer debts are established by bankruptcy court records.  He
also  disclosed  and  discussed  his  delinquent  debts  on  SCA  2  and  during  background
interviews from March 2020 and September 2020. A credit report from March 2020 also
reports Applicant’s delinquent consumer debts. (GE 1 - 11)
When  Applicant  completed  SCA  1,  he  disclosed  that  he  was  experiencing
financial  problems.  He  attributed  them  to  his  period  of  unemployment  from  2009  to
2011.  He  supported  himself  with  personal  savings  and  unemployment  benefits.  He
stated  that  he  had  worked  with  a  debt  settlement  company  (Company  A)  since  early
2010, and Company A provided him with credit counseling; was negotiating settlements
for five of his delinquent debts that totaled $57,300; and settled two of his five debts. He
intended  to  resolve  his  remaining  delinquent  debts  that  were  not  being  handled  by
Company A with the income he received from being re-employed since April 2011. He
short sold his home in July 2010, used the proceeds to pay his outstanding mortgage,
and stated that the remaining balance was written off by the mortgage company. (GE 3)
In  SCA  2  and  during  his  March  2020  background  interview,  Applicant  again
disclosed that he was having financial problems. He cited his divorce as the reason for
his delinquent debts and bankruptcy. In addition to his living expenses, he was assigned
responsibility  for  the  debts  incurred  during  his  marriage  and  he  was  ordered  to  pay
attorney’s  fees  for  his  ex-spouse  and  alimony.  He  became  overwhelmed.  He
acknowledged  during  his  March  2020  background  interview  that  he  did  not  live  within
his  means  while  maintaining  his  and  his  ex-spouse’s  households,  and  stated  that  he
made changes that would allow him to resolve his debts. He stated in SCA 2 and during
his March 2020 background interview that he contracted with a credit counseling service
(Company B) from May 2019 through July 2023, at $894 monthly. Company B provided
him with credit counseling; was negotiating settlements for five of his debts that totaled
$67,571; and settled one of his five debts.  The September 2020 background interview
reflected  that  Applicant  provided  documentation  corroborating  his  contract  and
payments to Company B beginning in May 2019. (GE 2, 4; AE A)
In  May  2020,  Applicant  petitioned  for  Chapter  13  bankruptcy,  as  previously
discussed  (SOR  ¶  1.a). He  listed  as  liabilities  all of  his consumer debts alleged  in  the
SOR (SOR ¶¶ 1.b - 1.g). Court records reflect that Applicant voluntarily sought dismissal
of his Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in June 2020, “as he is unable to move forward at
this  time,”  and  the  court  dismissed  his  case  without  a  discharge.  He  stated  in  his
Answer that he  was working  with  a  credit counseling  service (Company  C)  to  “remove
this item.” He also explained that he chose to withdraw his bankruptcy petition because
he  and  his  ex-spouse  agreed  that  she  would  instead  petition  for  bankruptcy,  and  he
would  pay  her  additional  money  in  alimony  monthly  to  help  her  pay  the  outstanding
mortgage so that she could obtain a loan to buy the house from under him. (GE 1, 6, 7,
8; AE A)
SOR ¶ 1.b is for a $12,087 account in collection. Applicant acknowledged in SCA
2 that he had a debt to this creditor for approximately $13,000, and he indicated during
his  March  2020  background  interview  that  he  overlooked  and  then  forgot  about  this
debt, and he would pay it when he was able to do so. He listed this debt in his Chapter
13  bankruptcy  petition.  In  November  2021,  he  entered  into  an  agreement  with  a  debt
relief service (Company D) to assist him with settling this debt. (GE 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
SOR  ¶  1.c  is for  a  $10,761  account  in  collection.  Applicant  indicated  during  his
March 2020 background interview and stated in his Answer that Company B was in the
process  of  negotiating a  settlement  on  this debt.  He  listed  this debt  in  his  Chapter  13
bankruptcy petition. In March 2021, he agreed to settle this debt for $4,842. He did not
provide proof of payment. (GE 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10)
SOR  ¶  1.d  is  for  a  $17,219  charged-off  account.  Applicant  indicated  during  his
March  2020  background  interview  this  was  a  personal  loan.  He  listed  this  debt  in  his
Chapter  13  bankruptcy  petition.  He  indicated  during  his  March  2020  background
interview that Company B was in the process of negotiating a settlement on this debt. In
his Answer, he stated that he was working with Company C to resolve this debt. (GE 1,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8,)
SOR ¶ 1.e is for a $72,641 past-due mortgage account, in foreclosure with a total
balance  of  $235,471.  In  SCA  2,  Applicant  stated  that  he  and  his  ex-spouse  made
arrangements  for  him  to  pay  her  the  past-due  mortgage,  and  she  would  make  the
mortgage payments going forward, so that she could keep the house. He acknowledged
during  his  March  2020  background  interview  that  the  home  was  in  foreclosure.  He
indicated that his ex-spouse was under a court agreement from their divorce to buy him
out of this home by June 2020. He listed this debt in his Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition.
He stated in his Answer that his ex-spouse was paying the monthly mortgage through
her  bankruptcy  petition  and  he  was  assisting  her  by  paying  her  additional  money  in
alimony monthly, as previously discussed. He stated that the outstanding principal and
arrears was $218,141. A December 2021 mortgage statement from the creditor notified
him that a payment of $23,695 was due in January 2022, and his outstanding balance
of $166,801 did not account for any amount that was past due before he petitioned for
bankruptcy. In his response to the Government’s FORM, he stated that he “was able to
pay off my ex-wife’s bankruptcy (Trustees) to clear all the arrears mortgage . . .” with an
inheritance that he had recently received, and that his ex-spouse was now responsible
for paying the mortgage. (GE 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11; AE A)
SOR  ¶  1.f  is  for  a  $25,182  charged-off  account.  Applicant  indicated  during  his
March 2020 background interview that Company B was in the process of negotiating a
settlement on this debt. He listed this debt in his Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition. In his
Answer, he stated that he was working with Company C to resolve this debt. (GE 1, 4,
5, 6, 7, 8)
SOR  ¶  1.g  is  for  a  $21,855  charged-off  account.  Applicant  indicated  during  his
March 2020 background interview that this was for a joint account with his ex-spouse.
He  indicated  that  she  used  this  card  while  he  worked  overseas.  He  indicated  that  he
would try to settle this debt after his obligations to his  ex-spouse decreased.  He listed
this  debt  in  his  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  petition.  In  his  Answer,  he  stated  that  he  was
working with Company C to resolve this debt. (GE 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)
Applicant stated in SCA 2 and during his March 2020 background interview that
he  was  living  paycheck  to  paycheck.  He  received  financial  counseling  in  May  2020
through his bankruptcy case. (GE 2, 4, 6, 7, 8)
