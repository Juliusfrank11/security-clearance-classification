In her Answer, Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.e; she admitted, in part,
and denied, in part, SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.g. At the hearing and without objection, Applicant
amended her Answer to SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.g, admitting both allegations. She is 29 years
old. As of the date of the hearing and since November 2021, she was separated from her
spouse,  whom  she  married  in  2011,  at  age  18.  She  has  a  child  from  a  previous
relationship, a minor, who has special needs. (Answer; Tr. at 7, 21-29, 46-47, 57, 80-81;
GE 1, 3)
Applicant graduated from high school in 2011. She earned an associate’s degree
in 2015 and a bachelor’s degree in aerospace engineering in 2017. As of the date of the
hearing,  she  was  working  towards  her  master’s  degree  in  aerospace  engineering  and
mechanics.  She  worked  for  her  employer,  a  DOD  contractor,  since  March  2019.  She
initially worked 12-hour rotating shifts as a satellite controller, but she was promoted  in
approximately  November  2020  to  a  satellite  engineer.  She  was  granted  a  security
clearance in approximately 2019. (Answer; Tr. at 7, 21-29, 75, 79-81, 89; GE 1-3; AE A,
F)
The SOR alleged that Applicant used: marijuana from approximately August 2008
to September 2019 (SOR ¶ 1.a); illegal stimulants (primarily ecstasy) from approximately
August 2011 to August 2019 (SOR ¶ 1.b); hallucinogens (including mushrooms, LSD, and
lab/synthetic hallucinogens) from August 2011 to August 2019 (SOR ¶ 1.c); cocaine from
March  2015  to  August  2019  (SOR  ¶  1.d);  and  prescription  medication  Adderall,  not
prescribed to her, from September 2010 to March 2015 (SOR ¶ 1.e). It also alleged that
Applicant  purchased  hallucinogens  on  the  dark  web  and  then  resold  them  between
September 2011 and August 2019 (SOR ¶ 1.f); and purchased illegal stimulants on the
dark web and then resold them between September 2011 and March 2017 (SOR ¶ 1.g).
Applicant acknowledged that curiosity would likely have led her to try drugs, but
she attributed the extent of her drug involvement to her spouse’s influence. She described
him  as  an  “incredibly  chronic”  marijuana  user.  When  she  met  him,  he  was  already
supplying and selling drugs. He supplied her with a number of drugs, to include her first
experiences with  MDMA  (ecstasy), cocaine, LSD, hallucinogenic mushrooms, and  lab-
created  hallucinogens.  He encouraged  her to  continue  to  sell  drugs  in 2019  when  she
decided   to   stop,   as   further  discussed   below.  He   suffered   from   depressive   episodes.
During  an  episode,  he   consumed  large  quantities of alcohol “and   other things,” and   he
abused   her.   She   endured   his   abuse   throughout   their   relationship,   and   his   abuse
worsened  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic. After an abusive  incident  that left her “really
scared” and  felt different than  before,  she  left  him  and  took her son  with  her. Her fear of
her spouse  affected  her ability  to  function, both  while  she  was with  him  and  since  leaving
him. Since  leaving  him, she  attended  weekly  individual and  group  therapy, through  which
she  learned  coping  mechanisms. She  had  no  future intent  to  have  any  contact  with  him
and  she  intended  to  seek a  divorce.  She  had  anxiety, difficulty  concentrating, and  memory
loss, especially concerning anything related to him. She  stated:
[I]t’s  hard   for   me   to   remember  anything   that’s  like   associated   with   my
husband.  And  the  [drug] use, I don’t know  if  why, like  the  drug  use  for me  is
like very intertwined with  him.
(Tr. at 29-30, 32, 35-36, 48, 48-53, 56-77, 80-81, 87-88, 93-94, 96-98; GE 1-3)
Applicant disclosed her drug involvement on her security  clearance applications
(SCA)  from  October  2019  (SCA  1)  and  August  2020  (SCA  2).  After  SCA  1,  she  was
interviewed by a background investigator in January 2020 and May 2020. After SCA 2,
she was interviewed by the same background investigator in September 2020.  Applicant
did not have a copy of SCA 1 or SCA 2 to reference during the interviews. She received
and responded to GE 2, in which she adopted the ROIs that summarized her interviews
with the background investigator, during the COVID-19 pandemic and the height of her
spouse’s abuse.  She did not review GE 2 as closely as she could have, she remembered
things incorrectly, and she did not reference SCA 1 or SCA 2 when reviewing GE 2. She
stated that her drug disclosures on SCA 1 most accurately reflected her drug involvement,
since it was the closest in time to the period in which she was using, buying, and selling
drugs. (Tr. at 53-56, 81-83, 89, 92-96, 98; GE 1-3)
Applicant used marijuana approximately monthly, from 2008 to 2015; she did not
use marijuana between 2015 and September 2019; and she exercised bad judgment in
September 2019 when she used marijuana with her spouse at a week-long music festival
between  the  end  of  August  and  into  September  2019.  She  used  marijuana  with  her
spouse and in social settings. She has not used marijuana since September 2019. (Tr. at
29-31, 33, 84-86, 88-89, 93-94, 98; GE 1-3)
Applicant  used  illegal  stimulants  between  2011  and  2019.  She  primarily  used
ecstasy and MDA, but she also used cocaine, amphetamines, methamphetamine, and
prescription  ADHD  medication  not  prescribed  to  her,  primarily  Adderall.  She  used  the
illegal  stimulants  in  social  settings.  She  estimated  that  she  used  ecstasy  “a  couple  of
times a month,” from 2011 to 2015. She did not use ecstasy between 2015 and August
2019. In August 2019, she exercised bad judgment and used ecstasy with her spouse at
the  same  music  festival  where  she  last  used  marijuana.  She  estimated  that  she  used
cocaine every three to six months, on around 10 occasions, from March 2015 to August
2019. In  August 2019, she  exercised  bad  judgment and  used  cocaine  with  her spouse  at
the  same  music festival where she  last  used  marijuana  and  ecstasy.  She  has  not  used
illegal stimulants since  August 2019.  (Tr.  at  31-35, 38-40, 84-86, 88-89, 93-94, 98;  GE  1-
3)
Applicant   used   prescription   ADHD  medication,  not   prescribed   to   her,   from
approximately   September  2010   to   March  2015.  She   occasionally   used   amphetamines
in   college.  She   used
and   prescription   medication   not   prescribed
methamphetamine  once, in  2011, when  she  was in  college.  She  used  amphetamines  and
prescription medication  not prescribed  to  her,  in college  “to focus  or  study for tests,”  and
she also used  the latter once  or twice to stay up to party. (Tr. at 31-35, 38-40, 84-86, 88-
89; GE  1-3)
to   her,
Applicant  used  LSD,  hallucinogenic  mushrooms,  and  lab-created  hallucinogens
from 2011 to 2016. She estimated that she used these hallucinogens “a couple of times
a  month”  during this period.  She did  not  use hallucinogens  between  2016 and August
2019.  In  August  2019,  she  exercised  bad  judgment  and  used  hallucinogens  with  her
spouse at the same music festival where she last used marijuana, ecstasy, and cocaine.
She has not used hallucinogens since August 2019. (Tr. at 35-36, 84-86, 88-89, 93-94,
98; GE 1-3)
Applicant  used  narcotics  from  approximately  February  2012  to  June  2014.  She
used heroin once, orally, out of curiosity. She also used prescription narcotic medication,
as prescribed to her, for pain relief. She has not illegally used a narcotic since June 2014.
(Tr. at 36-38; GE 1-3)
Applicant purchased and sold stimulants from approximately September 2011 to
March 2017, and she purchased and sold hallucinogens from approximately September
2011 to August 2019. She did so with her spouse, who was already supplying and selling
drugs when she met him. She stated, “Well, I literally didn’t have any time to myself, like
we did everything together.” They purchased stimulants and hallucinogens from people
they knew primarily through her spouse who were associated with drugs, and also on the
dark web from an online black market that she learned of after reading about it. She could
not recall the amount of stimulants and hallucinogens they purchased on the dark web;
how often they purchased stimulants and hallucinogens on the dark web; or how much
they  spent  on  stimulants  and  hallucinogens  on  the  dark  web.  She  estimated  that  they
purchased  stimulants  and  hallucinogens  from  people  they  knew  approximately  twice
monthly, and  from  the  dark web  approximately “a couple times a  year.”  She estimated
that they spent in “the low hundreds” when they purchased stimulants and hallucinogens
from the dark web. They purchased stimulants and hallucinogens for their personal use
and  to  sell,  out  of  their  apartment,  to  people  they  knew  from  social  events  who  were
“heavy drug users.” (Tr. at 41-45, 61-75, 88-91, 94-95; GE 1-3)
Applicant stated that she was young, and she sold stimulants and hallucinogens,
with her spouse, “mostly to buy groceries,” as she was in school full-time, her spouse was
earning  approximately  $30,000  annually,  and  they  were  “really  struggling.”  She  was
unsure how much they earned selling stimulants and hallucinogens, and estimated that it
was between approximately $200 to $500 per month. In approximately 2015,  when the
online black market through which they purchased stimulants and hallucinogens was shut
down, their purchases of stimulants and hallucinogens from the dark web ceased. After
graduating from college in 2017, she wanted to take her professional career seriously and
be  a  good  role  model  for  her  child,  so  she  mostly  stopped  purchasing  and  selling
stimulants and hallucinogens. On rare occasions between 2017 and 2019, she purchased
and resold stimulants and hallucinogens to friends who wanted them, but not to generate
income.  The  last  time  she  distributed  drugs  to  friends  was  at  the  2019  music  festival,
where she last used marijuana, ecstasy, cocaine, and hallucinogens. When her husband
pushed for her to continue to purchase and sell drugs, she told him “no.” (Tr. at 41-45,
61-75, 88-91, 96-97; GE 1-3)
Applicant  has  no  future  intentions  to  use  illegal  drugs  or  prescription  drugs  not
legally prescribed to her. She stated that she has matured since her last period of drug
involvement in 2019; she no longer socializes with individuals who used or sold drugs;
and  she  no  longer  frequents  places  where  drugs  are  used  or  sold.  If  she  were  to find
herself in an environment where drugs are being used, she would say “no.” She signed a
statement of intent in August 2021 not to use illegal drugs in the future, and agreed that
any such violation is grounds for revocation of her security clearance. She wants to be a
role  model for her  child.  She  had friends  who  battled narcotic addiction  and  died from
overdoses. She also stated, “At my job I want to be seen as a leader. Someone who can
mentor folks. I  want  to  be  respected  in my  field.”  She  described  her responsibilities at
work as:
I  am   the   satellite   buslead   for  two   of   our  geosynchronous  satellites.  So   I
focus  on  .  . . making  sure the  satellite  is healthy  . . .  sitting  in  space  correctly.
I’m   also   the  [payload   operations development  lead  for] the   satellite   we’re
about to  launch  . .  . telling  folks how  to  code  everything  . . .  interfacing  with
a  lot  of  different groups  inside  the  company  and  outside  the  company. I also
still  do  ops  because  I  love  ops. I love  the  interaction  between  folks.  We  have
a lot of interns, I like mentoring them a lot.
(Tr. at 27-28, 30-31, 33-36, 38, 40, 45-46, 56-57, 86-87, 91-92, 96-97; GE 3; AE B)
Applicant completed an online drug and alcohol awareness class in August 2021.
She was subject to random drug tests by her employer.  She tested negative for drugs
when  she  voluntarily  submitted  to  a  drug  test  in  March  2022.  She  has  never  been
diagnosed with a drug dependency. The director of the satellite control center in which
she worked, while not privy to Applicant’s past drug involvement, described her as “one
of the most dedicated, industrious, and trustworthy employees that I have worked with in
over  35  years  in  the  field.”  She  provided  numerous  other  references  from  individuals
attesting to her character, to include colleagues, former colleagues, peers, and friends,
many of whom were aware of Applicant’s past drug involvement. All of them vouched for
her maturity,  reliability,  and  willingness  to follow rules  and regulations. She stated  that
while  her  immediate  and  second  line  supervisors  were  unaware  of  her  past  drug
involvement, she was an “open book,” and would not be concerned if anyone were to find
out. Her employer awarded her bonuses in 2020 and 2021 for her performance, and she
received a favorable performance review by her former employer in 2017. (Tr. at 75, 77,
91-92, 97; AE C-G)
A co-worker of three years who worked with Applicant on a weekly basis, and who
was  also  a  friend,  testified.  This  individual  held  a  security  clearance.  She  stated  that
Applicant’s  superiors sought  to  recently increase Applicant’s  work responsibility,  which
was a testament to Applicant’s favorable work performance. This  individual stated  that
she  was  aware  of  Applicant’s  past  drug  involvement,  and  noted  that  Applicant  was
working hard to improve her life situation. She described Applicant as “a bright character
and has a very strong intent to be a positive influence on her son . . . and is exceedingly
passionate about her career path remaining in a positive trajectory.” (Tr. at 99-107)
