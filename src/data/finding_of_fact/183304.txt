In  his  answer, Applicant  admitted  SOR  allegations  ¶¶  1.a-1.i,  and asserted that
each  had  been  resolved.  He  provided  documentation  concerning  each  allegation.  His
admissions are incorporated into my findings of fact. Based on my review of the pleadings,
evidence submitted, and testimony, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is 39  years old.  He  was married  in  2013,  and  has three  minor children
with  his wife, and  another minor child  from  a  previous relationship.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s
degree   in  2008.  He   works  for  a   government  contractor  as   an   identity   and   access
management engineer. In  his previous employment,  he  had  been  granted  a  public trust
clearance. This is his first application  for a security clearance. (Tr. 20-23; GE  1)
The  SOR  alleges  failure  to  timely  file  federal  and  state  income  tax  returns,
outstanding federal and state tax liens, a delinquent tax debt, two charged-off debts, and
a debt in collection. The status of the allegations is as follows:
SOR  ¶  1.a  is  a  charged-off  auto  loan  for  $26,500.  It  was  opened  in  2018,  and
Applicant stopped making payments in 2019. He provided documentation showing that
he settled this debt in October 2021 for less than the full amount owed, after the SOR
was issued in this case. He stated that he did not know why he stopped making payments
on the loan, and asserted that he may have made some partial payments. However, he
failed to provide sufficient documentation showing that he made any partial payments on
the loan. (Answer; Tr. 34-39, 66-68, 76-78; GE 2, 3, 10; AE A)
SOR  ¶   1.b   is   a   charged-off   auto   loan   for  $19,538.   It   was  opened   in   2018,   and
Applicant stopped  making  payments in  2019. He  provided  documentation  showing  that
he  settled  this debt for  less than  the  full  amount owed  in September 2021. He stated  that
he  did  not know  why  he  stopped  making  payments on  this loan,  and  asserted  that he  may
to   provide   sufficient
have   made   some   partial  payments.  However,  he
documentation  showing  that he  made  any  partial payments on  the  loan. (Answer; Tr. 34-
39, 66-68, 76-78; GE  2, 3,  10; AE  A)
failed
SOR ¶ 1.c is a medical account in collection for $251. Applicant stated that this
debt was from an auto accident in which there is ongoing litigation. He claimed that his
attorney told him not to pay this bill. He provided documentation showing that he paid the
debt after receiving the SOR. (Tr. 39-41, 68; GE 2)
SOR  ¶  1.d  is  a  2019  federal  tax  lien  for  $11,434.  Applicant  submitted
documentation showing that he paid this debt in October 2021, after receiving the SOR.
He asserted that he used his savings to pay the debt. (Answer; Tr. 41-43, 68; GE 3, 4,
10)
SOR ¶ 1.e is a 2019 federal tax lien for $5,919. Applicant submitted documentation
showing that he paid this debt in October 2021, after receiving the SOR. He asserted that
he used his savings to pay this debt (Answer; Tr. 43-45, 69; GE 3, 5, 10)
SOR  ¶¶  1.f  and  1.g  are  2019  and  2020  state  tax  liens  for  $5,892  and  $6,580,
respectively. Applicant stated that these liens originated from tax debts owed for tax years
2017 and 2018. He submitted documentation showing that he paid the balance of these
liens in October 2021, after receiving the SOR. The record shows that he also made a
$3,421 payment in July 2021, and a $300 payment in September 2021.The liens were
satisfied on November 5, 2021. He asserted that he used his savings to pay this debt.
(Answer; Tr. 45-47, 69; GE 3, 6, 7, 9 10)
SOR ¶ 1.h alleges failure to file federal income tax returns for tax years 2011, 2013,
2016,  2019,  and  2020.  Applicant’s  October  28,  2021  answer  stated  that  “all  of  these
returns have been filed and accepted by the IRS who is currently processing the returns.”
Applicant also submitted a post-dated letter from his tax preparer, which made a similar
assertion. Neither statement was true. The tax filings in the record show that his 2019,
2020, and 2021 tax returns were prepared on June 22, 2022, which was the hearing date.
An accompanying letter from his tax preparer stated that his 2019 returns were accepted,
but his 2020 and 2021 return submission were denied. He testified that he found out the
day before the hearing that he owed a balance for tax year 2019. He also failed to provide
sufficient documentation showing that he filed his returns for tax years 2011, 2013, and
2016, or that any of the other delinquent returns had been filed prior to June 22, 2022.
(Tr. 51-54, 61, 69-71; GE 3; AE C-F)
SOR ¶ 1.i alleges failure to file state income tax returns for tax years 2011, 2013,
2016, 2019, and 2020. Applicant’s  answer provided an identical statement  as in ¶ 1.h.
The correspondence from his tax preparer did not specifically address his state taxes. He
failed to provide sufficient documentation showing that he filed his state tax returns for
these years. (Tr. 53-55, 58, 70; GE 3, 10)
SOR  ¶  1.j  is a delinquent federal tax debt for tax year 2019  in the approximate
amount of $4,261. Applicant admitted that this debt is unpaid. He stated that he did not
know it was owed until the day before his hearing. (Tr. 56-57, 64-65; AE D)
In his post-hearing submission, Applicant provided two state tax installment bills
showing that he owes the state $10,045 in back taxes. The documentation shows that he
has  an  agreement  to  pay  $451  monthly,  however,  he  did  not  provide  sufficient
documentation  showing  when  these  installment  agreements  were  made,  or  that  any
payments  have  been  made.  At  the  hearing,  he  testified  that  he  had  been  making
payments of $200 a month for about five months on his state taxes, but he did not provide
sufficient documentation substantiating these payments. (Tr. 60-64, 70-71; AE G, H).
Applicant’s tax problems have been ongoing for more than a decade. The record
shows  that  state  tax  liens  were  filed  against  him  in  2008  for  $1,091,  and  in  2016  for
$3,448. Both liens are now satisfied. His 2018 tax account transcript shows that, $3,373
of his refund was applied to a federal tax debt from 2010. He claimed that he had received
bad  advice from his former tax  preparer that he  did  not have  to  file  his taxes yearly. In  his
background  interview, he  stated  that he  filed  his 2014-2016  tax  returns late. In  January
2021, he  hired  a  tax  relief company  to  investigate  the  extent of his delinquent  returns  and
tax  debts,  and  claims that he  provided  that information  to  his current tax  preparer.  (Tr. 47-
48, 51, 71, 80-81; AE  B, I;  GE 3, 8)
Applicant stated that the cause for his financial problems was the government shut
down  in  2013,  and  his  wife  having  three  children  between  2012-2014.  However,  the
alleged SOR debts are from a later time-period, and most of federal and state tax issues
are more recent as well. He also asserted that as a government contractor, he has been
laid off almost every year or two when contracts end. However, his SCA shows that he
has been regularly employed since February 2006, and his only period of unemployment
was  between  September  2008  and  October  2008.  While  he  has  frequently  changed
employers, he failed to provide documentation showing that these employment changes
negatively impacted his finances. (Tr. 26-32. 72-74; GE 1, 3)
The most recent credit  report in the  record shows  that Applicant has a $62,000
auto loan that he opened in 2021, with a $1,050 monthly payment. He reported that he
put $20,000 down on the vehicle, and the total cost was about $82,000. This credit report
also reports that he has about $35,000 in student loans that are in deferment; two credit
cards  with  a  combined  balance  of  about  $8,000;  and  $3,349  monthly  mortgage.  The
record also shows that he had a $4,643 lien from a utility company, which was released
in 2021. (Tr. 37-38, 74; GE 3; AE A)
Applicant  did  not  provide  documentation  of  his  current  finances,  to  include  his
monthly income or expenses, or  his savings.  After receiving  the SOR,  Applicant  spent
about $32,000 to pay tax and other delinquent debt. He claimed that he had this money
in savings, but did not provide further information about why he did not utilize it prior to
receiving  the  SOR.  Throughout  the  hearing,  Applicant  was  evasive  in  answering
questions  about  his  finances,  and  failed  to  provide  requested  documentation  to
substantiate his claims. (Answer, Tr. 65-79; AE A)
