In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.b through 1k
with explanations. (Item 2) He denied ¶ 1.a because he claimed it was resolved. He is
58  years  old,  and  is  divorced  with  two  adult  children.  From  1995  through  1997,
Applicant attended college,  but he did not obtain a degree. Since  March 2008, he has
been  employed  with  his  current  employer,  a  federal  contractor.  Applicant  has  not
served in the military. He has held a security clearance since about October 2008.  He
completed a security clearance application on August 14, 2020.
Financial  Considerations
The   SOR  alleges  that   Applicant   has  11   delinquent   debts,   which  include   a   tax
debt  to  the  Federal  Government  in the  amount of $6,400.00  for tax  year 2019. The  total
amount   of  delinquent   debt,   including   the   tax   debt  is   about   $50,000.  (Item   2)  The
allegations are supported  by  his admissions  and  credit reports. (Items  5, 6, and  9)  (An
alert was  reported  on  February  3, 2022, that  an  unreported  information  about  Applicant
and  his finances was reported to the CAF.)   (Item 4)
In his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that his life was severely impacted by
a  sudden  and  unexpected  separation,  and  ultimately  the  divorce,  from  his  wife  of  27
years. The  separation was  three  years  long and  the  divorce  was  final  in  July 1,  2021.
He  stated  that  he  is  now  retaining  a  bankruptcy  attorney  to  help  him  reorganize  and
repay his debts under a chapter 13 bankruptcy. He claimed in his answer to the SOR,
that  he  repaid  the  IRS for the  amount  owed  and  is  in  good  standing  with  the  IRS.  He
provided  no  proof  of this claim. He stated  that he  is now  in “rebuilding” mode, and  his
work life is paramount to him. (Items 2, 5, and 9)
During  his  January  2021  interview,  Applicant  stated  he  separated  from  his
spouse  in  March  2017.  He  was  taken  by  surprise  and  his  wife  took  $7,000  from  their
savings  account.  Because  his  spouse  handled  all  the  finances,  Applicant  assumed  all
payments were current on his accounts. (Item 7)
In  his  personal  subject  interview,  Applicant  stated  that  he  filed  his  Federal  tax
return on July 15, 2020 for tax year 2019, but he had not paid his tax debt at that time.
Applicant  has  not  yet  set  up  a  payment  plan  with  the  IRS.  He  has  now  adjusted  his
withholdings.  He  verified  that  all  the  accounts  listed  on  the  SOR  1.b  through  1.k  were
accurate. (Item 7) He wants to discuss the matter with a bankruptcy attorney.
As to SOR ¶¶1.b through 1.k, the accounts are either in collection or charged off.
They include medical services and consumer accounts. Applicant did not dispute any of
the  accounts,  but  emphasized  that due  to  his emotional state  he  did not  pay  them.  He
used   his  credit  cards   to   pay   some   bills  since   2017.    His  checking   account   is  “nearly
empty   every   two   weeks.”  (Item   7)  Applicant   stated   that  he   is  living   payday-to-payday
because he lost his wife’s income and his salary has been cut. He stated that he intends
to pay his bills.
Applicant’s  personal financial worksheet noted a monthly net income of  $3,842,
with  expenses  of  $2,437.  His  total  monthly  debt  payments  are  $1,123  for  a  home
mortgage,  showing  a  net  remainder  of  $282.  (Item  8)  He  has  real  estate  valued  at
$150,000; stock, bonds and IRA accounts at $120,000. A car valued at $15,000 and an
annuity  of  $109,738.  He  expects  that  his  spouse  will  get  half  of  the  home  sale  and
annuity.  He  admits  using  poor  judgment  in  the  wake  of  his  separation  and  divorce.  At
this time, he does not have the money to file for bankruptcy, but he hopes to borrow the
money from his sister. (Item 7)
Applicant  did  not  provide  any  documentation  for  the  record  to  demonstrate  that
he  is  taking  steps  to  resolve  his  delinquent  debts.  He  intends  to  pay  his  debts,  but
promises  to  pay  in  the  future  and  possibly  use  bankruptcy  to  resolve  his  debts.
However,  he  has  not  shown  any  mitigation  for  the  delinquent  accounts,  nor  has  he
produced evidence that the tax debt is paid. He is earning  a salary, but has not made
even a small payment on any of the accounts. He claimed that the IRS debt is resolved,
but provided no proof. Absent any proof of payments, Applicant did not meet his burden
of proof.
