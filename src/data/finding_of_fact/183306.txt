Applicant  is  a  46-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor  for  whom  he  has
worked since January 2019. He was out of work from about September 2017 until about
August  2018  after  a  long-time  employer  fired  him  for  a  conflict  of  interest  when  he
attempted  to  start  his own  business.  There  is  no  evidence  in  the  record  regarding  his
education  level.  He  has  been  married  and  divorced  twice.  His  marriages  were  from
1998 until 2000 and from 2006 until 2016. He has two adult children. He served in the
Army National Guard from 1997 until 2005, when he received an honorable discharge.
(Items 5, 15)
Under  Guideline  F,  the  Government  alleged  Applicant’s  untimely  filed  federal
income tax returns for the 2013 through 2017 tax years (SOR ¶ 1.a); his untimely filed
state  income  tax  return  for  the  2013  tax  year  (SOR  ¶  1.b);  his  delinquent  state  taxes
totaling about $5,800 for the 2014 and 2015 tax years (SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d); and nine
delinquent  consumer  debts  totaling  about  $14,700  (SOR  ¶¶  1.e  through  1.m).  In  his
SOR  response,  he  admitted  all  but  one  of  the  Guideline  F  SOR  allegations  with
additional comments.  He  denied  the  debt  in SOR  ¶  1.m for $132 because  he  claimed
that  he  paid  it.  The  Guideline  F  SOR  allegations  are  established  through  Applicant’s
admissions and the Government’s evidence. (Items 4-12, 15)
Under  Guideline  J,  the  Government  alleged  Applicant’s  eight  criminal  charges
from December 1996 through July 2015. Applicant admitted the Guideline J allegations
with additional comments for two of the charges, claiming that he was not convicted of
those charges. (Items 4-5, 13-15)
Applicant  failed  to  file his federal  income  tax  returns for  the  2013  through  2017
tax years, as required. He claimed that this failure resulted from a hardship, but he does
not explain the nexus between his hardship and his failure to file. The only documentary
evidence he provided of his attempts to remedy these delinquent federal tax filings is an
entry in  his 2014  IRS account  transcript that notes  “[t]ax  return  secured” in  July  2020.
He provided documentary evidence that he filed his 2018 federal income tax return on
time,  and  that  he  received  a  refund  for  that  tax  year.  However,  that  refund  was  offset
against his IRS delinquencies for the 2009 and 2010 tax years.1 (Items 4-7, 15)
Applicant failed to timely file his State A income tax return for the 2013 tax year.
He  provided  no  documentary evidence  to  show that  he  has  since  filed  this  delinquent
state tax return. (Items 4-7, 15)
Applicant owes State A for income taxes for the 2014 and 2015 tax years in the
approximate  amount  of  $5,800.  With  respect  to  the  2014  tax  year,  between  February
2017  and  May  2018,  he  made  payments  totaling  $1,763.  For  the  2015  tax  year,  a
payment  of  $798  was  credited  to  Applicant’s  account.  It  is  unclear  whether  this  credit
was a voluntary payment or an offset. There is no evidence in the record that Applicant
1  Any   adverse  information   not  alleged  in  the   SOR,  such  as   Applicant’s  additional  federal   and  state   tax
delinquencies,   cannot  be   used   for  disqualification   purposes.  It  may   be   considered  when   assessing   the
application of mitigating conditions  and for the whole-person analysis.
had   a   payment   arrangement   with   State   A’s  taxation   authority   with   respect  to   these
payments. (Items 4-7, 15)
Applicant  provided  documentary  evidence  that  he  satisfied  his  State  A  income
tax  indebtedness  for  the  2016  tax  year  with  either  payments  or  offsets  in  2019  and
2020.  He  provided  documentary  evidence  that  he  satisfied  his  State  A  income  tax
indebtedness for the 2017 tax year with payments and offsets between 2018 and 2020.
He provided documentary evidence that he has a zero balance on his income tax with
State A for the 2018 tax year. (Items 4-7, 15)
Applicant’s  nine  delinquent  consumer  debts  totaling  about  $14,700  remain
unresolved.  While  he  claimed  that  he  is  working  to  resolve  these  delinquencies,  he
provided no documentary evidence of his efforts to do so.  All of these consumer debts
with the exception of SOR ¶¶ 1.l and 1.m appear on the 2022 credit report. The debts in
SOR ¶¶ 1.l and 1.m appear on the 2021 credit report. Applicant also has an overdrawn
account in the amount of $274 that is not listed in the SOR. (Items 4-12, 15)
Applicant  claimed  that  his  financial  issues  arose  because  of  unemployment,
divorce,  and  caring  for  his  ailing  father.  He  stated  that  his  intent  is  to  make  payment
arrangements with respect to all his delinquencies. (Items 5, 6, 15)
Applicant was charged with crimes eight times between 1996 and 2015. While it
was not listed in the SOR, he was also cited for an HOV lane infraction in October 2018.
His criminal charges consist of a total of five domestic violence charges in 2002, 2003,
2007,  2008,  and  2015;  a  drug  possession  charge  in  1996;  and  two  driving  under  the
influence of alcohol (DUI) charges in 2002 and 2005. (Items 4, 5, 13-15)
The 1996 drug possession charge was a felony, but despite having marijuana in
his  pocket,  the  charges  against  Applicant  were  dropped  as  the  search  leading  to  the
charge was considered unlawful. The 2002 and 2005 DUIs resulted in convictions. The
2003  and  2007 domestic  violence  charges  resulted  in  convictions. The 2007 domestic
violence  charge  was  a  felony,  but  he  was  convicted  of  a  lesser  charge.  Applicant
violated  the  conditions  of  his  parole  for  his  2003  domestic  violence  conviction  by
committing  his  2005  DUI,  failing  to  report  to  his  parole  supervisor,  failing  to  pay  fees,
and  failing  to  report  changes  in  address.  The  2008  domestic  violence  charges  were
dropped.  The  2015  domestic  violence  charge  was  a  felony  but  the  charges  were
dropped. All of these domestic violence charges resulted from physical altercations with
Applicant’s spouse or significant other. (Items 4, 5, 13-15)
