Applicant is almost 47 years old and has an 18-year-old son. He married in July
2006 and divorced  in April 2011.  He received a high school diploma in 1994, and  has
been attending college courses since October 2018, studying organizational leadership.
He has earned enough credits to be a second semester junior. He enlisted in the U.S. Air
Force delayed entry program in February 1997, and served on active duty from February
1998 until 2003, when he was honorably discharged. He then served in the active and
inactive Air Force Reserve until January 2009, when he transferred to the U.S. Army. He
then  served  on  active  duty  in  the  Army  until  January  2017,  when  he  was  medically
discharged,  and  eventually  received  a  100  percent  disability  rating.  His  total  military
service was 18 years. He was unemployed between June 2022 and the hearing date. He
was scheduled to start a new job as a cellular-tower technician for a non-DOD employer
the week after the hearing. He previously held a secret security clearance from 1998 until
2019, when it was revoked. (GE 1; GE 2; GE 5; Tr. 10, 22-32, 36, 38-39)
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  failed  to  file  his  state  and  federal  income  tax
returns, as required, for TYs 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020, and as of the date
of the SOR, TYs 2014, 2015, 2019, and 2020 remained unfiled. He denied both of these
allegations (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.c). He admitted the remaining allegations, namely, that he
is indebted to the federal government for delinquent taxes ($10,020) for TY 2018 (SOR ¶
1.b),  and  he  had  seven  credit  card  accounts  that  have  been  charged  off,  placed  for
collection, or have outstanding balances that total $24,342 (SOR ¶¶ 1.d to 1.i, and 1.k).
He also had his truck repossessed and the balance of the loan was placed for collection
in the amount of $9,147 (SOR ¶ 1.j).
Applicant attributes his financial problems to being unemployed from April 2019 to
February  2020.  During  this  period,  he  was  supported  by  unemployment  benefits,  the
Servicemen’s  Readjustment  Act  of  1944  (GI  Bill)  benefits  he  received  while  attending
college  courses,  and  disability benefits.  After leaving  active  duty  in  2017,  his disability
rating increased from 60 to 80 percent, and in July 2022, he was awarded 100 percent
disability. (GE 2 at 9; Tr. 32-35)
In  Applicant’s March 2021  SCA, he  disclosed  that he  had  not filed his state  and
federal  tax  returns  for  TY  2019  and  2020  due  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  and  he
anticipated that he owed $1,500. He did not clarify if he owed this amount to one of the
tax entities or if this was how much he owed collectively. He also disclosed the delinquent
debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, and 1.k. He claimed he was working
with a credit specialist to address several of the debts, and they resulted, in part, due to
losing his job. (GE 1 at 35-36).
In May 2021, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. He adopted
this statement in his October 2021 response to DOHA interrogatories. His finances were
discussed as well as many of the debts alleged in the SOR. He also admitted he had not
filed his state and federal income tax returns for TY 2019, but he indicated his intent to
do so in the next 30 days. (GE 2)
In  October  2021,  Applicant  completed  a  second  SCA.  His  financial  information
remained unchanged from his March 2021 SCA. As mentioned above, DOHA sent him
interrogatories that he signed on October 5, 2021. He was asked, in part, to provide the
status for his state and federal income tax returns for TY 2013 through 2020. He was also
asked to provide copies of his IRS account transcripts and documentation from the state
tax authority for TYs 2013 through 2020. He provided account transcripts from the Internal
Revenue  Service  (IRS)  for  TYs  2013,  2016,  2017,  and  2018.  He  provided  no  other
documentation. (GE 2; GE 5)
At the hearing, Applicant testified he filed his federal income tax returns for TYs
2014 to 2015 in a timely manner using an online tax service he has always used. He failed
to  provide  documentation  to  substantiate  this claim  in  his response  to  the  SOR;  in  his
response to DOHA interrogatories; at the hearing; and after the hearing. He was able to
provide evidence that he filed his TY 2016 federal income tax return; therefore, he argued
his TYs 2014 and 2015 returns were also filed, because the IRS will not allow a tax payer
to file a return for a more recent year if an earlier TY remained unfiled. He provided no
evidence to substantiate this argument. (Answer; GE 2; Tr. 18, 40-48, 51)
Applicant filed his TY 2017 return late without an extension, but does not have an
outstanding balance with the IRS or his state tax authority. He filed his TY 2018 state and
federal income tax return in a timely manner, but owes the IRS $10,020. He also has an
outstanding balance with his state for TY 2018, but does not know what it is. He has no
explanation for why he has not reached out to his state to inquire as to how much he may
owe for TY 2018. (Tr. 18-19, 44, 48-49, 51-53, 55-56, 59, 81)
Applicant testified that he had not yet filed his state and federal income tax returns
for TY 2019 through 2021. He did not file his federal and state income tax returns for TY
2019 in a timely manner, because he knew he was going to owe money and it was too
overwhelming  for  him  at  the  time  to  address.  He  claims  the  IRS  will  not  allow  him  to
establish an installment agreement until he has filed all his back tax years. His state and
federal  income  tax  returns  for  TY  2021  were  not  alleged  and  will  not  be  considered
disqualifying; however, I may consider them in determining if mitigation is applicable and
in  my  whole-person  assessment.  He  has  not  sought  help  from  a  professional  tax
consultant, and could not provide a reason why he had failed to do so. (Tr. 18, 44, 48-50,
53-56, 58-60, 81)
Applicant  has  not  made  any  payments  toward  any  of  the  eight  non-tax  debts
alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.d through 1.k. He opened these accounts between  May 2016 and
August 2020, and he stopped making payments between January 2020 and August 2021.
Many of these debts were incurred for him “to  basically survive” and  to  rehabilitate  the
house he purchased in December 2016. (GE 1-5; Tr. 61-69)
Shortly  before  the  hearing,  Applicant’s  disability  rating  was  increased  to  100
percent  ($3,458  monthly),  and  with  this  increase,  he  is  able  to  pay  his  mortgage  and
utilities.  On  July  1,  2022,  he  received  an  over  $8,000  lump-sum  payment  from  the
Veterans Administration (VA) for back payment related to his disability pay. He did not
use this to pay any of the debts alleged in the SOR, instead he “spent it on stuff for the
house.” Nor had he proactively contacted any of the SOR creditors prior to the hearing to
establish payment arrangements. He anticipated that once he started his new position he
would be able to start to repay some of his delinquent consumer debts. He has $1,500 in
savings and no other assets, other than his home. He follows a written budget, and the
record was held open, in part, to allow him to submit a copy, but he chose not do so. He
has not sought financial counseling. (Tr. 62, 66, 69-71, 77, 80)
Applicant did not have any security violations during the period he held a security
clearance.  The  record  was  held  open,  in  part,  to  allow  him  to  submit  documentation
regarding the awards and decorations he received while serving in the Air Force, Air Force
Reserve, and Army. He did not provide this documentation, but testified that he received
approximately  21  awards.  He  deployed  to  Afghanistan  from  January  2011  to  October
2011 with Special Forces, and to Kuwait and Iraq from June 2014 to January 2015. (Tr.
13, 36-38)
