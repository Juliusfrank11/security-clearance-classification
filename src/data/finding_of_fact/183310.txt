Applicant denied all the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 44 years old. She earned an associate’s degree in 2007, a bachelor’s
degree in 2010, and a master’s degree in 2012. She served in the military from 1997 until
her  honorable  discharge  in  2003.  She  then  served  in  the  Army  National  Guard  Active
Reserve  from  November  2003  until  she  was  honorably discharged  in  June  2005.  She
married in 2013 and has two stepchildren, ages 22 and 18. (Item 3)
The  SOR alleges four delinquent debts (¶ 1.a  - $21,000; ¶ 1.b  - $16,574; ¶ 1.c -
$11,173; and  ¶ 1.d  - $2,500) totaling  approximately  $51,247. The  debts are supported  by
Applicant’s  admissions   made   in  her  answer  to   the   SOR  and   during   her  January   2019
background   interview   with   a   government  investigator,  a  civil   judgment  filed   in  August
2021,  and credit reports from May 2022  and  April 2021. (Items 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8)
In  Applicant’s  January  2019  security  clearance  application  (SCA),  she  reported
delinquent student loans for $37,911; $17,387; and $20,770 and said she was working
with the creditor to make monthly payment arrangements. (Item 3)
Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator  in  January  2019  and
attributed  her  financial  difficulties  to  her  husband’s  unemployment  for  15  months
beginning in January 2015, and that they used credit cards for their living expenses and
got behind on them and her student loans. At some point, she enrolled in a debt-relief
program  (DRP)  to  settle  her  outstanding  credit  card  balances.  She  said  she  had  paid
some of the debts on a monthly basis and negotiations were ongoing for one credit card.
(Item 7)
Applicant did not dispute the debts that she was confronted with by the investigator
that were later alleged in the SOR. She stated that they were being paid through the DRP.
She was asked specifically about student loans she reported as delinquent in her SCA
and confirmed each loan was being repaid through her DRP.  In her SOR answer, she
acknowledged the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a, but disputed the amount she owed. She said she
received  a  letter  from  collection  attorneys  requesting  payment  for  the  student  loan
balance, and she disputed the amount. She is waiting for the attorneys  to explain why
she owes so much money on the account. Her April 2021 and May 2022 credit reports
show the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a is charged off, disputed, and that the resolution process was
concluded. Applicant did not provide a response to the FORM updating the status of this
debt and it remains unresolved. (Items 1, 2, 5, 6, 7)
Applicant stated in her SOR answer that the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c, both to
the same creditor, were being resolved through monthly payments. She stated that she
settled  the  account  in  SOR  ¶  1.b  for  less  than  the  full  amount  and  had  paid  down
approximately half of the debt. She provided payment records that show in March 2021,
she agreed to settle the debt for $15,231 on a current balance at the time of $23,432,,
and was required to make 18 monthly payments of $846. Her payment record shows she
made payments from March through November 2021. As noted above, Applicant received
the FORM in June 2022 and had an opportunity to provide additional information, but she
did not respond and did not provide an updated status of her payments. I am unable to
determine if she continued to make the required monthly payments to resolve the debt.
(Item 2)
Applicant affirmed in her answer to the SOR that she is responsible for the debt
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c for a judgment for a student loan. She provided an unsigned copy
of  a  consent  judgment  in  her  sister’s  name,  but  the  civil  judgment  recorded  in  August
2021 in the district court is in Applicant’s name for $23,432. Applicant agreed to settle the
account for $14,000. It is unknown why her sister’s name is on the consent judgment. The
civil judgment is binding. She stated that she has an installment agreement to pay $800
a  month.  She  provided  documents  to  show  she  made  payments  from  April  2021  to
November 2021. She did not provide a response to the FORM updating the status of the
debt. I am unable to determine if she continued to make the required monthly payments
to resolve the debt. (Items 2, 8)
Applicant stated in her SOR answer that in June 2018 she reached a settlement
agreement  of  $851  with  the  creditor  for  the  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.d.  In  January  2020,  she
closed her account with DRP and took over paying her remaining debts. She said she
paid this debt, but the creditor did not clear her account. Her most recent credit report
from May 2022 reports the debt as charged  off. She did not provide documentation to
show the debt has been resolved. (Items 2, 5)
In Applicant’s SOR answer, she stated that she works a total of 20 hours Monday
through  Friday  and  another  15  to  20  hours  on  Saturday  and  Sunday  making  food
deliveries. She said she has an additional $500 at the end of the month after making the
payments on the debts noted above. (Item 2)
