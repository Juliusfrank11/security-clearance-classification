The SOR alleges that Applicant has five delinquent debts totaling approximately
$50,000  (Item  4)  The  allegations  are  supported  by  his  admissions  and  credit  reports.
(Items 4, and 5)
In  his answer to  the  SOR,  Applicant  attributed  his financial  problems  to  helping
his brother, who was out of  work. Applicant  was also unemployed  in 2016.  Applicant
was terminated due to a DUI he incurred in 2016. He then worked selling windows and
roofs and received commission from August 2017 to January 2018. (Item 3) He earned
about  $500  a  month.  He  used  a  credit  card  to  pay  for  his  living  expenses.  Applicant
reported unemployment from February 2017 to July 2017.  He also experienced earlier
unemployment for a period in 2011 and 2012.
In his personal subject interview in May 2021, Applicant explained his termination
from employment in 2016, a job that did not require a security clearance. Applicant told
the investigator and disclosed on his SCA that he was arrested and found guilty of a –
first offense DUI in October 2016 and spent time in jail. He had another incident (open

remainder is $3,400. He listed a monthly payment of $238 for one of the SOR debts in
his expenses and also listed a car payment. There is no record of financial counseling
or a budget.
As to SOR 1.a, a charged-off-account in the amount of $10,728, Applicant used
this  credit  card  to  pay  for  his  living  expenses.  He  fell  behind  in  the  payments  due  to
unemployment and underemployment. He has not made any payments on the debt. He

know  what  the  account  represented.  He  recalls  starting  a  debt  consolidation  plan  but
never completed the process. (Item 6)
The  credit report dated  December 17, 2020, shows several accounts as “paying
as agreed”, or under a partial payment plan. (Item 5) It confirms that Applicant has paid
six other accounts  that  are not  listed on the SOR  that have been paid  in 2019. It also
shows  that  Applicant  has  been  paying  on  another  account  under a  payment  plan  and
the balance has decreased. (Item 5)
Also,  Applicant  reported  to  the  investigator  that  another  account  SOR  (1.c)
concerned a short sale that ended in the summer of 2015. Applicant was notified that he
no longer had to pay toward the short sale and he was reimbursed a total of $25,351.
(Item 6) There is no evidence in the record to substantiate his claim.
