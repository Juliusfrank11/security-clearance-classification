Applicant is 33 years old and has an almost 13-year-old son from his first marriage.
He was married from January 2009 to March 2012 and from April 2019 to sometime in
2020.  Both  marriages  ended  in  divorce.  As  of  the  hearing  date,  he  had  been  with  his
current partner for a little over a year. Since receiving his high school diploma in 2008, he
attended approximately three years of college-level courses, but did not receive a degree.
In May 2019, he received a certificate in coding. He has worked as a software developer
for his current employer since June 2019. (GE 1; Tr. 10-11, 21-30)
Applicant  served  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  Navy  as  a  Cryptologic  Technician
Interpretive from July 2008 to July 2014, until he was honorably discharged as a second
class petty officer (CTI2). He was previously granted a Top Secret clearance with access
to Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) while on active duty in the Navy. At the
time of the hearing, he did not hold an active security clearance. (GE 1; Tr. 10-11, 21-30)
The SOR alleged two delinquent debts, totaling $20,937. Applicant denied SOR ¶
1.a, a $14,909 consumer debt that was opened in May 2011, and placed for collection in
approximately January 2015. He stated in his answer to the SOR, “This debt is no longer
collectable  as  it  has  passed  statute  of  limitations  and  no  longer  appears  on  my  credit
report.” He admitted SOR ¶ 1.b, a $6,028 automobile debt that was opened in June 2014
and placed for collection in June 2016. He stated in his answer to the SOR, “While this
debt does exist on my credit report it will pass statute of limitations either this month or in
April, then no longer be collectable.” (Answer, GE 2 at 2; GE 3 at 6)
Applicant  attributes  his  financial  issues  to  his  first  divorce  and  periods  of
unemployment and underemployment. He was unemployed from January 2019 to May
2019. From April 2016 to April 2017, he was in school full time and not employed. When
he left active duty in 2014, he did not have a job “lined up” for when he returned home.
He used the Servicemen’s Readjustment Act of 1944 (GI Bill) to attend college courses,
and it was only sufficient to pay for some of his expenses, such as housing. “I wasn’t able
to cover the large debts that I had left, so I kind of just let them slide. It was a bad decision,
but I couldn’t make it work at the time.” (GE 1; GE 4; AE A; Tr. 18)
In  June  2019, Applicant disclosed  both  of  the  debts alleged  in SOR in  his SCA.  He
indicated  that he  intended  to  “contact  a  credit  assistance  service or [his] bank about debt
consolidation,   to   get   all   [his]  unpaid   debts   together  and   clear   them. With   the   debt  and
income [he]  had [he] was unable to cover payments and  be in  a livable state. Now with a
stable job and income, [his] first priority is to clear all [his] debts.” (GE 1 at 46-47)
In October 2019, Applicant was interviewed by a Government investigator, and
his financial issues were discussed. At that time, he did not refute his responsibility for
the two debts alleged in the SOR. He told the investigator that after recently moving from
State A to State B, his income had doubled and his then wife (second) also had a stable
job.  Their  top  priority  was  to  resolve  their  outstanding  debts  and  contact  a  debt
consolidator. (GE 4 at 2-3)
At the hearing, Applicant testified that he had forgotten about his delinquent debts
until 2019, when he applied for a top secret security clearance for his current job. At some
point  in  2019  or  2020,  after  his  October  2019  interview,  Applicant  contacted  a  credit-
consolidation  company.  He  was  told  he  could  consolidate  his  debt,  pay  a  fee  to  the
company, and pay his debts for several years, or he could wait until the seven-year statute
of  limitations  (SOL) expired  (for the two  debts  alleged in the SOR).  He did not ask for
advice as to how relying on the expirations of the SOL would affect his ability to obtain a
security clearance. He could afford to make payments toward the two alleged SOR debts,
but he reasoned:
[I]  would  probably   still   be   paying   on   them   for  another  few   years  unless  I
lump  sum  paid them  if I  could,  now  that I have  a  lot  of  money. But  the  …
hitting  of  the  statute of limitations and  no  longer being  collectable was kind
of  my  plan at that point. (GE 4;  Tr. 19, 33-34,  40-44)
In  July 2022,  Applicant  purchased  a  home for  $285,000.  He  used  the  GI  Bill  to
purchase it and could not afford a down payment. As of the hearing, he had not yet made
a payment, nor had his partner moved in with him to share the expenses of the house.
(Tr. 20-21, 28, 46)
Applicant’s  2021  credit  report  reflects  that  he  had  two  other  smaller  delinquent
debts that he paid in March 2021 ($221 – car insurance and $1,441 – cellular phone) and
one debt ($1,878 – education related) that was resolved through the confiscation of his
federal income tax refund. He paid the two unalleged debts, because they were placed
for  collection  in  October  2020  and  December  2017,  respectively,  and  the  statute  of
limitations did not apply to them. (GE 3; Tr. 19, 41-43)
Applicant testified that the $14,909 personal loan or credit card alleged in SOR ¶
1.a, was opened in May 2011, and used primarily to pay for vehicle repairs. He stopped
paying this debt shortly after he left active duty in July 2014. He initially tried to negotiate
lower payments, and then stopped making payments. The creditor attempted to collect
the  debt, but  he  did  not  have  the funds  to  pay it.  He  has  not  been  in  contact  with  the
creditor since approximately 2014, and the debt fell off his credit report in approximately
September 2021. He did not provide documentation as to the relevant state’s SOL. (GE
1-4; AE A; Tr. 31-34, 44)
When Applicant was unable to adequately repair the vehicle mentioned above, he
purchased a new car when he returned to his hometown in 2014. He was unable to make
the payments on the loan, and it was repossessed approximately one or two years after
he purchased it. The credit reports indicate that his last payment was made in June 2016.
The  $6,028  balance  of  the  car  loan  is  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.b.  He  did  nothing  to  try  to
address this debt after the repossession other than letting the statute of limitations run its
course. This debt fell off of his credit report in approximately February 2022. He did not
provide documentation as to the relevant state’s SOL.  (GE 1-4; AE A; Tr. 34-36, 39-40,
44)
Applicant’s  net  monthly  income  is  $4,800,  and  he  has  a  monthly  remainder  of
between $800 and $1,000. Other than the brief credit counseling that he attended in 2019
or 2020, he has sought no other financial counseling services. At the time of the hearing,
he had $300 in savings. He does not use a written budget. He is not required to pay child
support for  his son.  The  August  2022  credit  report that  he  submitted  after  the  hearing
reflects no new delinquent debts. (AE C; Tr. 23, 45-51)
According   to   Applicant’s  DD-214,  he   received   the   following   awards  and
decorations  while   serving   in  the   Navy:  Good   Conduct  Medal  (2nd   Award);  National
Defense Service Medal; and Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. (AE B)
