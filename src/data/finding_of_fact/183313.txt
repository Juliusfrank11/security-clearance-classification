In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted 23 allegations, with the exception of
SOR  ¶¶  1.h,  1.q,  1.r,  1.s,  and  1.t,  with  explanations.  (Item  2)  She  is  48  years  old,
married,  with  two  adult  children  from  a  previous  marriage.  Applicant  has  two
undergraduate degrees, which were obtained in 1996 and 2016. Applicant has been a
psychiatric  technician  for  a  federal  contractor  since  approximately  September  2014.
(Item 3) Applicant has not served in the military. She has not held a security clearance.
Applicant completed her security clearance application (SCA) on May 21, 2021.
Financial  Considerations
The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  has  23  delinquent  debts,  which  include  credit
card debt, medical accounts, a car note she obtained for her daughter, education debts,
and  utility  accounts.  The  total  amount  of  delinquent  debt,  not  including  the  car  note  is
$20,000.  The  car  note  is  $13,000.  (Item  2)  The  allegations  are  supported  by  her
admissions and A credit report. (Items 4 and 5)
In her answer to the SOR, Applicant attributed her delinquent debts to a one-year
period  of  “volunteering”  and  not  working  for  pay.  (Item  2)  She  also  stated  that  her
husband  was  unemployed  and  she  “got  behind  in  her  bills.”  In  her  May  2021  SCA,
Applicant noted that she was working on her debts and that she would begin  repaying
her debts in September 2021. (Item 3)  With her answer, she submitted many pages of
an Experian credit report, dated January 2022
During her June 2021 interview, Applicant volunteered that she was behind in the
car note payments for her daughter’s car.  She stated that she had no knowledge of the
other SOR allegations, but then she agreed  after confrontation  that she was behind in
the  accounts  due  to  low  funds.  As  to  the  medical  bills,  she  stated  that  she  was  not
aware of them, but planned to call to set up payment plans. Applicant characterized her
financial  situation  as  “needing  more  work”.  She  is  willing  to  repay  all  debts.  She  was
considering  debt  consolidation.  Applicant  was  given  an  opportunity  to  submit  more
information  to  the  investigator,  but  did  not  do  so.  (Item  5)  Applicant  used  two  debt
services in 2019 and 2021, but she terminated them without resolving any debts. At the
time of the interview, Applicant had not paid any of the delinquent debts.
The  following  delinquent  accounts  that  Applicant  denied  have  not  been  paid:
¶¶1.h  a  collection  account  for  $305;  1.q  a  medical  account  for  $20;  1.r  a  medical
account for $14; 1.s another medical account for $14; 1.s a medical account for $14; 1.t
a  medical  account  for  $14.00.  The  accounts  each  have  different  numbers  and  do  not
appear to be duplicates.
The  following   accounts  have   been   paid as evidenced   by   receipts   presented: ¶¶
1.i  an  account  for  $300; 1.k an  account for $127;  1.m an  electric account  for $72.44;  1.n
a   medical   account   for   $53;  1.p   an   account  for  $20.83;   and   1.u   an   account  for  $321.
(attachments to Item 2)
As  to  SOR  ¶  1.b,  a  charged-off-account  in  the  amount  of  $4,518,  Applicant
settled for $3,800 and presented an agreement dated, January 5, 2021. However, she
did  not  provide  any  receipts  to  show  payments  made  to  the  account.  In  fact,  she
disputed this account to the credit bureau.
As to SOR ¶ 1.g, an account in the amount of $819, Applicant settled the debt for
$283, evidenced by a receipt.
Applicant  claimed  that  she  made  arrangements  to  settle  the  $13,763  car  loan
alleged in the SOR ¶ 1.v for $3,443.69, with a monthly payment of $143.66. However,
the payments do not begin until January 26, 2023.
When  Applicant  responded  to  the  FORM,  she  presented  three  credit  bureau
reports which showed that she had disputed most of  the accounts  alleged in the SOR
and  some  of  which  had  been  deleted.  However,  she  is credited  with  having  settled  or
paid all of the SOR debt. (Response to FORM) She did not present any new information
to show progress, only her intent to make payments pursuant to the agreed settlements.
There  is no  information  in  the  record  concerning  Applicant’s  income,  expenses,
or  monthly  net  remainder.  There  is  no  record  of  financial  counseling.  She  did  not
present a budget or a plan for most of the delinquent debts. She obtained debt services
in 2019 and 2021, but stopped using them.
Applicant  has addressed  a few of  the  smaller accounts,  but  that  is  a fraction of
what  she  currently  owes.  Approximately  $570  has  been  repaid.  Most  of  the  other
payments occurred after the receipt of the SOR. She promised during her interview to
begin paying last September, but she did not do so.  She failed to provide evidence that
she is making payments on the debts that she settled.
Applicant  did  not  meet  her  burden  of  proof  in  this  case.  She  failed  to
demonstrate  that her financial  issues have  been or are  being resolved.  There  is not a
sufficient  track  record  of  payments.  It  is  difficult  based  on  the  record  to  establish  that
Applicant is making a good-faith effort to repay or resolve overdue creditors or that her
financial situation is currently under control.
