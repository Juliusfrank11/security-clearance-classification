In  Applicant’s  SOR  response,  she  denied  all  of  the  SOR  allegations  in  ¶¶  1.a
through  1.s.  The  credit  reports  in  the  record  support  the  SOR  allegations.  Additional
findings follow.
Applicant is 40 years old, and she has been employed by a government contractor
as a budget analyst since October 2019. Her annual salary is about $112,000. In 2014,
she  received  a  bachelor’s degree  in business management. She married in 2008, and
she has two children, ages 11 and 17. She was separated from her spouse from about
2017 until 2020, when they reconciled. She currently possesses a DOD secret security
clearance. (GE 1; Tr. 26-32)
Financial Considerations
The SOR alleges 19 delinquent debts; the majority of which are delinquent student
loans. At the hearing, Department Counsel divided the SOR debt into three categories:
consumer  debt  (totaling  $3,968),  student  loans  referred  for  collection  with  the  U.S.
Department of Education (ED) (totaling approximately $127,682), and delinquent student
loans held by private debt servicers (totaling $18,432). Applicant testified that she denied
all of the debts in her SOR response, because she did not agree with the “balance” or the
“delinquent” status of the account. She admitted, however, that she was responsible for
all 19 accounts. (SOR response; Tr. 35-36)
Consumer Debt:
SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.q  allege  that  Applicant  owes  a  total  of  $2,786  for  delinquent
consumer  credit  accounts  placed  for  collection  by  the  same  creditor.  She  provided
sufficient documentation showing that these accounts have been paid. (GE 6; AE F, AE

SOR ¶ 1.s alleges that Applicant owes $1,182 for a consumer credit account that

been  divided  into  several  smaller  loans  totaling  $24,810,  and  placed  with  the  ED  for

Student loans held by private debt servicers:
SOR ¶ 1.g alleges that Applicant owes $9,749 for a delinquent student loan that
was  placed  with  a  private  debt  servicer  for  collection.  The  August  2022  credit  report
reflected  the  current  amount  was  $11,823.  Applicant  provided  documentation  that
showed  she  had  rehabilitated  this  student  loan  in  2020  after  making  nine  consecutive
monthly payments, and then had the student loan placed in forbearance. It is her intention
to repay her student loans. (GE 6; AE E; Tr. 53-60; SOR Response)
SOR ¶ 1.i alleges that Applicant owes a total of $7,192 for a delinquent student
loan that was placed with a private debt servicer for collection. The August 2022 credit
report reflected the current amount was $8,722. Applicant provided documentation that
showed  she  had  rehabilitated  this  student  loan  in  2020  after  making  nine  consecutive
monthly payments, and then had the student loan placed in forbearance. It is her intention
to repay her student loans. (GE 6; AE E; Tr. 53-60; SOR Response)

loan that was placed with a private debt servicer for collection. The August 2022 credit

showed  she  had  rehabilitated  this  student  loan  in  2020  after  making  nine  consecutive

Applicant  began  to  experience  financial  problems  after  she  separated  from  her
spouse in 2017. He had been laid off, and he was not providing any money to assist with
the household expenses. She also received a significant pay cut after leaving her position
where she earned about $55,000 per year, to accept a civilian position with the DOD. She
was placed into a trainee program, and her annual salary was approximately $46,000. In
September 2017, she left her government job to work for a government contractor, and
her salary increased from about $46,000 to $65,000. Applicant and her spouse eventually
reconciled and they moved back into the family home in 2020. Her husband also returned
to work for his employer where he earns about $55,000 annually. (Tr. 61-66)
Applicant filed for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2006. During that period of time, she
was  a  young  mother  and  had  purchased  a  family  car  financed  by  a  loan  with  a  high
interest rate. She worked part-time at a bank, and soon found herself obtaining money
from a payday lender to keep her car payments current. It did not take long to concede
she  was  in  serious  financial  trouble.  Applicant  and  her  spouse  filed  for  Chapter  13
bankruptcy protection, because they wanted to pay off  their debts and keep the family
car.  The  bankruptcy  trustee  administered  the  five-year  repayment  plan,  but  they
successfully finished their payments in four years. The bankruptcy court discharged the
case in 2010. (GE 9; Tr. 68-73)
Applicant provided a financial summary and monthly budget post-hearing. In an
attachment  statement,  she  explained  that  she  was  already  working  to  resolve  her
delinquencies prior to the date she became aware that the government was concerned
about  her  financial  issues.  She  rehabilitated  her  student  loans  held  by  private  debt
servicers  and  placed  the  loans  into  forbearance.  Her  student  loans  with  the  U.S.
Department  of  Education  were  deferred  due  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  She  then
focused  her  attention  on  paying  off  all  of  her  delinquent  consumer  accounts  with  her
disposable income. She is scheduled to begin her student loan payments after December
31,  2022.  She  provided  documentation  of  her  efforts  to  consolidate  all  of  her  student
loans, except her Perkins loans, under the Direct Loan Program. Beginning October 1,
2022, it is her intention to pay  approximately $300 each month to reduce the accruing
interest  on  her  student  loans.  She  provided  a  Personal  Financial  Statement,  which
showed  a  household  monthly net  income  of  $8,264.  After their monthly expenses  and
debt payments, to include an estimated monthly student loan payment of $760, they have
a monthly net remainder of $3,204. She explained that they were unable to use more of
their disposable income to make interest payments on her student loans  earlier due to
unforeseen expenses, to include a transmission replacement, sport camp fees, and the
expense of visiting several colleges with her older son. It is her intention to live within her
means going forward and not accumulate any delinquent debt. (AE A, AE I, AE J, AE K,
