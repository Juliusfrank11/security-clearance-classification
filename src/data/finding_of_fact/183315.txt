Applicant  admitted  all  but  two  SOR  allegations,  with  explanations,  and  his
admissions are incorporated into these findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings
and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a  46-year-old employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He began  working
at  his   present  job   in   2020.   He   is  an   aircraft   mechanic  inspector.  He  is  a   high   school
graduate  and  received  technical training.  He  married  in 2003  and  divorced  in 2005.  He
married  his current  wife  in  2012. He  has three  children  from  his  first  marriage  and  three
stepchildren   from   his   current  marriage.  He  has  a   child   support  obligation   for  his
youngest child that ends in November 2022,  upon her 18th  birthday. (Tr. 6, 20; GE 1)
The  SOR  alleged  18  delinquent  debts,  including  a  child  support  obligation,  two
federal  income  tax  debts  for  years  2014  and  2016,  five  medical  debts,  and  ten
consumer  debts  totaling  approximately  $35,537.  The  debts  are  established  by
Applicant’s  admission  in  his  March  2021  security  clearance  application  (SCA),  his
admissions  in  his  Answer  and  at  hearing,  and  his  credit  reports.  (Tr.  20-22;  GE  1-3;
Answer)
Applicant  testified  that  his  financial  troubles  began  when  his  wife  was  laid  off
from  her  job.  She  was  earning  approximately  $30,000  annually  and  assisting  with  the
family finances. The Covid pandemic impacted her ability to get a job, leaving Applicant
the sole wage earner for the family. His wife then decided to go back to school to earn a
nursing  degree.  While  completing  her  degree,  she  started  working  part  time,  in  early
2021, for an employer who is assisting with her school tuition payments. She began full-
time employment in August 2021. (Tr. 20-22, 26, 29-30)
Applicant  contacted  his  creditors  in  an  attempt  to  work  out  payment  plans,  but
that  effort  was  met  with  no  success  because  the  payments  they  demanded  were  too
high  for his income.  In 2021,  he  contracted with  a  debt  relief  company (DRC) to  have
them negotiate settlements on his delinquent accounts. From January to October 2021,
he documented making 14 payments of approximately $225 each to the DRC. Applicant
was unsatisfied with the lack of progress by the DRC so he terminated his contract with
it.  In  about  October  2021,  he  contacted  a  bankruptcy  attorney  and  was  advised  to
pursue a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which he did. (Tr. 21-22, 28, 33-35; AE D)
Applicant filed his initial Chapter 13  petition in  October 2021.  He  participated  in
financial counseling as part of the bankruptcy. All his SOR-listed creditors were notified
about  the   bankruptcy   in  order  to   file   claims.  An   initial  payment  plan   was  developed   in
February   2022.  He   documented   that   beginning   in  April  2022,  he   was  making
approximately   $1,500   per  month   payments   to   the   bankruptcy   trustee.   The   payments
were directly  from his work paychecks. An  amended  plan  was prepared and  accepted  in
September 2022.  Under the   accepted   plan, Applicant’s  monthly   plan   payments  will be
approximately   $3,300   monthly.  This  higher  amount  is  because   the   final  plan   includes
payments for his mortgage  and two  cars. Previously, he  was making  these  payments  on
his  own,  outside   of  the   plan.   Applicant   calculates   that   his total monthly   income   will  be
used   to   make   the   bankruptcy   plan   payments.   Their   remaining   monthly   expenses  will
come  out of his  wife’s income, which is approximately  $2,500  monthly. Additionally, his
child   support  payments  of   approximately   $386,  which  are  currently   coming   out  of  his
monthly   paychecks,  end   in  November  2022.  These   payments  included   his  monthly
obligations and  arrearages. (Tr. 17, 36, 37-38; AE A-C, F-J)
Applicant  explained  that  he  did  not  have  the  funds  to  pay  his  2014  and  2016
federal income taxes at the time they were due. He documented that he paid his 2014
federal taxes in 2015 and now has a zero balance. His 2016 federal taxes were paid in
2017 and there is a zero balance. (Tr. 38; GE 1; AE E)
