In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied all of the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a
through 1.m.
Applicant  is  35  years  old  and  divorced  since  2018.  He  and  his  former  wife
separated in 2012 and have a teenage daughter. He served on active duty in the Marine
Corps from August 2005 to December 2013. He deployed twice, once to the Middle East
in 2009 on a combat deployment, and once to Asia in 2007 for nine months. He was a
sergeant (E-5) when he received an honorable discharge. He held a security clearance
while serving. (Tr. 26-29; GE 1 at 20, 37)
After leaving military service, Applicant worked for Students Veterans of America
from January 2014 to May 2018. He also attended college during this timeframe, but did
not complete a degree. After that  he was unemployed  from May 2018 to August 2018
while he helped his mother who was diagnosed with cancer. He subsequently worked for
private  security  companies  including  a  family  business.  These  positions  paid  between
$13 and $16 per hour. In October 2020, Applicant applied for a position with a defense
contractor  and  submitted  a  security  clearance  application  (SCA).  That  position  did  not
materialize.  On  August  2,  2021,  he  started  a  position  with  another  defense  contractor
where  he  continues  to  work,  earning  about  $24  per  hour.  His  annual  gross  salary  is
$50,000. (Tr. 14-23; GE 1 at 12-19)
Applicant  attributed  his  financial  problems  to  being  unemployed  while  he  was
caring for his mother for three to four months in 2018 after she was diagnosed with cancer.
He used credit cards to pay his expenses, and his mother’s bills. For a number of years
afterwards, he was underemployed in low-paying positions. In addition,  he was paying
$650 a month in child support for his daughter. (Tr. 24, 29-33)
In his Answer, Applicant denied owing the alleged debts because they had fallen
off  of  his  credit  report  and  they  were  beyond  the  statute  of  limitations  and  legally
unenforceable. He intends to address delinquent debts that are on his credit bureau report
(CBR), but not those which are no longer reported. (Tr. 35, 40) In April 2022, he hired a
credit repair company to help  improve his credit. (AE C) The company did not provide
budget counseling. (Tr. 41, 51) He tried obtaining a consolidation loan in 2018, 2019, and
2021 to help resolve his outstanding debts. He was denied each time because he did not
qualify. (Tr. 47-48)
Based on CBRs from January 2021 and December 2021, the SOR alleged thirteen
delinquent  debts  totaling  about  $19,000,  which  became  delinquent  between  2014  and
2021. (GE 2, GE 3) The status of each debt is as follows:
1.  The  debt  in SOR ¶ 1.a  for  $10,857  is the  balance  owed  to  an  automobile  loan
company   for  a   2010   car  Applicant   purchased   for  his  ex-wife.   It   was
repossessed  in  January  2014,  and  subsequently  sold  for an  amount  less  than
the   balance   owed   on   the   loan.   He   acknowledged   that   it   is   his   debt.   He
negotiated   a   payment   plan   with   the   creditor,   but  was  unable   to   make   the
payments, due to a lack of income. He decided to allow the debt to fall off of
his CBR, which it did. He no longer intends to pay it. (Tr. 35- 39)
2.  The  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.b  for  $1,178  is  owed  to  a  finance  company.  Applicant
admits  it  is  his  debt,  but  he  cannot  recall  what  it  relates  to.  It  went  into
collections in 2014.  He does not intend to address this debt because it has
fallen off of his CBR. (Tr. 39-40).
3.   The debt in SOR ¶ 1.c for $1,099 is owed to an e-commerce company for retail
purchases Applicant made. He admits that it is his debt. He stopped making
payments  on  the  debt  in  2018  when  his  mother  was  sick,  and  he  was
unemployed for the summer. The debt is listed on his July 2022 CBR and he
intends to pay it. His credit repair company has contacted the creditor to resolve
it. (Tr. 42-45; AE A).
4.   The debt in SOR ¶ 1.d for $997 is owed to a cell phone company. Applicant

contact the creditor to resolve it. (Tr. 45-47; AE A)
5.   The debt in SOR ¶ 1.e for $801 is owed to a company for a credit card Applicant
used in 2018 for expenses. He obtained a second credit card from the company

(Tr. 54; AE A)
9.  The debt in SOR ¶ 1.i for $188 is owed to a company that helps people build
credit by making loans to them. Applicant took this loan out in April 2021. The
debt  was  placed  in  collections  in  September  2021.  He  admits  the  debt.  It  is
listed  on  his  July  2022  CBR.  He  intends  to  have  his  credit  repair  company
contact the creditor to resolve it. (Tr. 55; AE A).
10. The debt in SOR ¶ 1.j for $388 is owed to an e-commerce company. Applicant

credit report. He does not intend to resolve it. (Tr. 56)
11. The debt in SOR ¶ 1.k for $541 is owed to a company for a credit card. Applicant
said  he  resolved  the  debt  for  less  than  the  alleged  amount  and  he  paid  the
balance. (Tr. 57) He said he has a receipt proving that it is resolved. His July
2022 CBR reports that it was a paid charge-off. (Tr. 56-58; AE A) It is resolved.
12. The debt in SOR ¶ 1.l for $1,090 is owed for student loans Applicant took out
between 2014 and 2018. Applicant said this loan went into collections in May
2018 and has since fallen off of his CBR. He never made a payment on this
loan. (Tr. 59-60)
Applicant has four or five other student loans that are unpaid. He thinks his total
student  loan  debt  is  about  $19,000.  He  intends  to  address  them  after  he
resolves his other debts. They are in deferment until the end of 2022. (Tr. 69,
74-75)
13. The  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.m  for  $56  is  owed  to  a  company  for  a  book  Applicant
purchased  while  in  college.  It  went  into  collection  in  May 2018.  He asserted
that he returned the book, but the company does not have a receipt for it. He
does not intend to pay it. (Tr. 60-61).
Applicant submitted his budget. His net monthly income is $3,232 and his monthly
expenses  are  $2,780,  including  his  $800  child  support  payment.  He  has  about  $452
remaining at the end of the month. He intends to apply to the Veterans Affairs (VA) for
disability.  His  daughter  is  moving  to  Japan  this  year,  at  which  time  his  child  support
obligation will stop. He has some money in savings. (Tr. 32, 61-65; AE A) His girlfriend
with  whom  he  has  lived  for  the  past  two  years  works  and  contributes  to  their  monthly
expenses. (Tr. 66)
Applicant  said  he  is  still  learning  about  finances  and  credit  issues.  He  did  not
realize that delinquent debts, including ones that have fallen off his credit report, could
jeopardize  his  ability  to  obtain  a  security  clearance.  The  issue  never  arose  during  his
previous security clearance investigations. (Tr. 76-77) He intends to resolve his financial
problems because he wants to purchase a piece of property. (Tr. 80)
