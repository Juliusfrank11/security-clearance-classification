Applicant admitted the allegations in the SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.n and denied the
allegations in ¶¶ 1.o and 1.p. Applicant’s admissions are incorporated into the findings of
fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  testimony,  and  exhibits
submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  39  years old.  He served  in  the military from  2005 to 2009  and  was
deployed  in  combat  operations.  He  received  an  honorable  discharge.  He  attended
technical school from 2009 to 2011. He attended college from 2011 to 2016 and earned
a bachelor’s degree. He married in 2005 and divorced in 2011. He has a child from the
marriage who is 12 years old. He has two other children, ages 20 and 7, from previous
relationships.  He  has  been  employed  by  a  federal  contractor  since  November  2018.
Before then he had periods of unemployment and underemployment. (Item 2)
The  SOR  alleges
that  Applicant  has  delinquent  student
totaling
approximately $67,408 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.l), $6,371 of consumer debt (SOR ¶¶ 1.m
and 1.n) and $34,897 of child support arrearages (SOR ¶¶ 1.o and 1.p). Applicant admits
all of the debts, but disputes the amount owed in child support arrearages. In his January
2019 security clearance application (SCA), he disclosed his child-support arrearages and
stated  that  his  monthly  support  obligations  were  too  high  and  he  was  seeking  a
modification to have the amounts more commensurate with his income. He said he was
in contact with the child support caseworker. (Items 1, 2)
loans
The  debts  alleged  are  corroborated  by  Applicant’s  admissions  in  security
clearance  application,  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  statements  made  to  the  government
investigator during his background interview, and credit bureau reports from March 2020,
March 2021, and January 2022. (Items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
In Applicant’s July 2020 background interview with a government investigator, he
attributed his financial problems to lack of income and the high child-support payments.
He told the investigator in November 2002 he was ordered to pay $300 to support his
eldest child. He fell behind and was approximately $11,647 in arrears because he did not
earn  enough  income  to  pay  the  full  amount  and  other  child-support  obligations  and
1 It appears  Applicant’s Answer to the SOR is  incorrectly  dated as March 31, 2022,  which would be before
the Statement of Reasons was issued. Other documents in Applicant’s answer are dated May 20, 2022. It
is therefore extrapolated that the correct date of  the Answer is May  instead  March.
expenses. In November 2018, the amount was reduced to $250, which is garnished from
his wages. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant disputed the amount he owed on this debt
and provided a document from the court administering the child support, which shows the
amount he owes in arrears is $10,851. (Items 1, 3)
Applicant told the investigator that he was ordered to pay $190 to support his other
child. He fell behind in his payments as stated above, and his obligations are in arrears
in  the approximate amount of $23,250. In  November 2018, his monthly obligation was
reduced to $150 a month, which is garnished from his wages. In his answer to the SOR,
Applicant disputed the amount he owed on this debt and provided a document from the
court  administering  the  child  support,  which  shows  the  amount  he  owes  in  arrears  is
$20,186. (Items 1, 3)
Applicant told the investigator that in March 2010, he was ordered to pay $600 for
monthly child support for his third child. He told the investigator that he is approximately
$4,000 in arrears for unpaid support and medical bills associated with this child’s birth. In
November 2018, the amount of support was reduced to $500. It is being garnished from
his  wages.  The  arrearages  for  this  child  were  not  alleged  in  the  SOR  and  will  not  be
considered for disqualifying purposes, but may be considered when making a credibility
determination, in the application of mitigating conditions, and in a whole-person analysis.
(Item 3)
Applicant acknowledged to the investigator that he has approximately $62,000 in
delinquent student loans that he began incurring from 2010 to 2016. He has not attempted
to pay them because he does not have the resources. He has not contacted the creditors
and  cannot  pay  them  until  his finances  improve.  He  stated  he  intended  to  contact  the
creditors  to  find  out  if  the  loans  could  be  placed  in  forbearance.  He  did  not  provide
additional information about the status of these loans. (Item 3)
Applicant acknowledged the consumer debts alleged in the SOR began accruing
in  2012  and  2014.  He  has  not  attempted  to  pay  them  because  he  does  not  have  the
financial resources. (Item 3)
Applicant  told  the  investigator that  his financial  problems  are  due  to  his divorce
and his large child-support obligations. He went through a period when he could not find
full-time employment that paid enough to pay his obligations. In 2018, he was able to start
meeting his obligations. He said he intends to pay his debts. (Item 3)
