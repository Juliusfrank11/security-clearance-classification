In  her  Answer,  Applicant  admitted  the  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  1.d,  and  denied  the
allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.c, and 1.e through 1.g with explanations. She denied
three alleged student loans because she  said she no longer owes them to the alleged
creditor,  as  they  were  transferred  to  the  U.S.  Department  of  Education  (DoEd)  in
November  2021  and  are  current.  (Item  2)  Her  admission  and  explanations  are
incorporated into these findings of fact.
Applicant is 50 years old and unmarried. She does not have children. She attended
college but has not yet completed a degree. She has worked for a federal contractor since
September  2010  and  received  a  Secret  clearance  in  2011.  In  January  2021,  she
submitted a security clearance application (SCA) for renewal of her clearance. Since that
date, she has also been working a second job at a retail store. (Item 3) In March 2021, a
government investigator interviewed her about her finances. (Item 4)
Applicant  attributes  her  financial  problems  to  medical  problems  that  started  in
2011. She also said she has not been earning enough income to pay her debts over the
years,  including  student  loans.  (Item  2;  Item  4  at  7)  She  submitted  her  January  2022
budget. Her net monthly income is $2,588 and her monthly expenses equal her income.
(AE at 3, 5, 7) She did not indicate that she has taken budget or credit counseling.
In March 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the DoEd placed all federal
student loans in forbearance and has since extended the student loan payment pause
through December 31, 2022. The pause includes the following relief measures for eligible
loans:  a  suspension  of  loan  payments;  a  0%  interest  rate;  and  stopped  collection  on
defaulted  loans.  (See  Federal  Student  Aid:  https://studentaid.gov/announcements-
events/covid-19.)
On   November  10,  2021,  the   U.S.  Department  of   Education   (DoEd)  transferred
three  student loans Applicant owed  to  GM to  DoEd. Contrary  to  Applicant’s assertion  in
her Answer  that  these  student  loans  are  the  three  student  loans alleged  in the  SOR,  these
loans were not  alleged  in the  SOR. They  are additional student loans owed  by  Applicant.
In  its notice  to  Applicant of  the  transfer, DoEd  stated  that Applicant’s current balance  on
one   transferred   loan   was  $43,535   with   an   outstanding   interest   balance   of  $311.  On
November  10,  2021,  DoEd   also  notified   Applicant  that   the   current   balance   on   another
transferred  loan  was $22,740  with  an  outstanding  interest  balance  of  $155. (Item  2  at 4,
5) These two  loans total $66,275. Their  status  was  listed  on  Applicant’s November 2021
CBR as “pays as agrees.” (Item 5 at 4)
Based  on  credit  bureau  reports  (CBR)  from  February  and  November  2021,  the
SOR  alleged  six  delinquent  accounts  totaling  $77,487,  including  three  student  loans
totaling $76,456. (Item 5, Item 6) The status of each alleged debt is as follows:
1.   (1.a) The  student loan  owed  to  DoEd  (formerly  USF)  for  $51,618  was reported
delinquent  in March  2017. Applicant  said she was having  medical problems  at
the  time  of  the  loan  and  did not  earn  enough  money  to  pay  her debts. (Item  4
at 4)  Both  the  February  and  November 2021  CBRs, report  the  debt as being  in
collections.   (Item   5   at   2;  Item   6   at  2)   There   is  no   evidence   that   Applicant
established   a   payment  plan   for  this  loan   before  the   COVID-19  federal
deferment was implemented.
2.   (1.b) A  $66  medical debt is unresolved. Applicant denied  the  debt because  she
did not recognize  it. In  her Answer,  she  said she  would investigate  it.  (Item  2  at
2)  During  her March 2021  background  interview, she  told an  investigator that
she  was unfamiliar with  the  debt and  intended  to  contact the  creditor.  According
to  her November 2021  CBR, the  debt was placed  for  collection  in  November
2020. (Item  4 at 7, Item 5 at 2)
3.   (1.c) A  $56  medical debt is  unresolved. Applicant  denied  the  debt and  said  she
did  not recognize  it. In  her Answer, she  said she  would investigate  it.  (Item  2  at
2)  During  her  March 2021  interview, she  said  the  debt became  delinquent in
August 2017,  and  that  she  intended  to  pay  it  when  her finances  were  better.
(Item  4 at 5)  It  is in collection. (Item 5 at 2)
4.   (1.d) A  $919  debt  owed   to   a   jewelry   store  was   paid   in  November   2021.  It   is
resolved.  (Item  2 at  6)
5.   (1.e) The student loan  owed to  DoEd  (formerly  NL)  for $16,316  was opened in
March  2006.   According   to   the   November   2021   CBR,   as   of  July   2019,  it   was
reported   as  more  than   120   days  past  due   and  was  transferred   to   another
creditor.  (Item   5   at  4)  There  is  no   evidence   that  Applicant  established   a
payment   plan   for  this  loan   before  the   COVID-19   federal  deferment   was
implemented.
6.   (1.f) The  student loan  owed  to  DoEd  (formerly  NL), for $8,522  was opened  in
March  2006.   According   to   the   November   2021   CBR,   as   of  July   2019,  it   was
reported  as more  than  120  days past due  and  transferred  to  another creditor.
(Item  5  at 4) There  is no  evidence  that  Applicant established  a  payment plan
for this loan  before the  COVID-19 federal deferment was implemented.
In her response to the FORM, Applicant reiterated that she has she has not been
able to make payments on her student loans in some time because she does not earn
enough money and has health problems. She is aware of her outstanding student loan
debt and she would like to make payments on them. (Item 4) In response to questions
about non-alleged student loans, Applicant told an investigator in March 2021 that she
had paid and resolved some loans in the past. (Item 4) The February 2021 CBR verifies
that some of Applicant’s debts are current and in good standing. (Item 6 at 7, 8)
