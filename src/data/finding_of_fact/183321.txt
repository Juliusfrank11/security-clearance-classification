In  response  to the  SOR,  Applicant admitted SOR  allegations ¶¶ 1.a  through  1.f
with  explanations.  (Item  2)  He  is  31  years  old,  and  is  married  with  no  children.  From
November  2010  to  March  2013,  Applicant  attended  college,  but  he  did  not  obtain  a
degree.  Since  November  2019,  he  has  been  employed  with  his  current  employer.
Applicant has not served in the military.  He completed a security clearance application
on December 5, 2020.  Applicant has never held a security clearance. (Item 3)
Financial  Considerations
The SOR alleges that Applicant has six delinquent  student loan accounts in the
approximate  amount  of  $25,619  (Item  2)  The  allegations  are  supported  by  his
admissions and credit reports. (Items 6, and 7)
In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  stated  that  he  was  not  able  to  afford  any
payments and therefore the student loans became delinquent, defaulted and moved to
collections.  He  attributes  his  non-payment  of  the  student  loans  due  to  unemployment
(2010-2013)  or seasonal jobs  that did  not  pay  well.  (Item  2) In  his  response  to  DOHA
financial interrogatories,  dated April 22, 2021, none of  the  student loan accounts were
paid, in payment plans, and no payments were being made. Applicant reported that he
had delinquencies involving the student loans but did not receive any information after
the loans went to collections. (Item 5)
In  his personal  subject  interview  in  March  2021,  Applicant  listed  unemployment
from  December  2018  to  March  2019  and  from  April  2019  to  November  2019.  His
spouse supported him during this time of unemployment. Applicant told the investigator
that  he  has  no  other  financial  issues.  He  has  not  obtained  services  from  a  credit
counseling  service.  He  claimed  that  he  was  not  delinquent  on  any  federal  debt  or
defaulted on any other loans. (Item 4)
Applicant stated that with his current job, he is able to start paying the debts. In a
letter dated February, 18, 2022, from the U.S. Department of Education, he was notified
that he could rehabilitate his defaulted student loans with a monthly repayment mount of
$354, which was based on his income. He accepted the agreement to repay beginning
in April 2022. Applicant signed the agreement on February 25, 2022. (Item 2) Applicant
did not provide any information or documentation that he has started the payment plan.
Applicant’s  monthly   net  salary   combined   with   his   spouse’s   salary   is  $6,743.92.
After  monthly   expenses  of   $2,392,   his  net   remainder  is  $4,023.56.  In   his  submitted
budget he listed a car loan with a scheduled payment of $328.36.  (Item  5)
As  to  SOR  1.a,  a  collection  account  in  the  amount  of  $6,436;  1.b,  a  collection
account in the amount of $5,282; 1.c, a collection account in the amount of $4,337; 1.d,
a collection account in the amount of $3,318; 1.e, a collection account in the amount of
$3,187;  1.f,  a  collection  account  in  the  amount  of  $3,059  all  to  the  Department  of
Education, none have been resolved.
Applicant did not provide any documentation  for the record to demonstrate that
he  is  taking  steps  to  resolve  his  delinquent  debts.  He  intends  to  pay  his  debts,  but
promises to pay in the future are not sufficient for mitigation. He is now earning a salary,
but  his  student  loans  have  been  delinquent  since  2014,  and  it  is  not  clear  from  the
record if a single payment has been made. He claimed that the IRS took his tax refund,
and applied it to his student loans, but he did not provide any proof. Absent any proof of
payments, Applicant did not meet his burden of proof.
