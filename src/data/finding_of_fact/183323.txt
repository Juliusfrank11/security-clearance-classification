Applicant  admitted  some of  the  SOR  allegations  (¶¶ 1.b-1.e) and denied others
(¶¶ 1.a, 1.f-1.m). Her admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a careful review
of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  54  years  old.  She  has  worked  for  her  current  employer,  a  defense
contractor,  since  May  2018,  as  a  program  and  quality  manager.  She  is  a  high  school
graduate and has taken some college courses. She married in 2016, but has been in a
common-law marriage since 2000. She has one adult child and two adult stepchildren.
She is unsure if she previously held a security clearance. (Item 3).
The   SOR  alleged   Applicant  owed   delinquent   federal  taxes   for  the   following   tax
years  and   in  the   following   amounts:   2019-$3,326;  2018-$5,626;  2017-$13,392;  2016-
$13,326; and 2015-$6,929. (¶¶ 1.a-1.e). Applicant’s  submission of  IRS tax transcripts as
part  of   her   October  2020   and   April  2022   responses  to   interrogatories  established   her
federal  income   tax   delinquencies  for  tax   years  2015-2019.  In   her  answer  to   the   SOR,
she   admitted   owing   delinquent   taxes  for  tax   years  2015-2018.   She   made   the   same
admissions  in her response  to  the  FORM. She  explained  the  reason  for her tax  liability
was  because   she   failed   to   have   enough   money   withheld  every   pay   period   from   her
paycheck. She  claimed  in her SOR answer that she  paid  the  federal tax  debt for 2019
and  that she  had  set  up  a  payment  plan, or was working   with  a  tax  service to  pay  the
federal  taxes owed  for   2015-2018.  In  her FORM  response, she  also claimed  her 2019
federal tax  was paid and  that she  was now  working  directly  with  the  IRS  on  a  payment
plan   to   pay   her  remaing   tax   debts  for   2015-2018.  She   failed   to   produce   any
documentation   corroborating   payment  for  her  2019   federal  tax   debt  or  her  payment
plans  for  her  2015-2018   federal  tax   debts.   Her  federal   tax   debts  have   not   been
resolved. (Items 2, 4 (pp. 12-18), 6 (pp. 8-15); AE A)
The  SOR  also  alleged  Applicant  owed  eight  delinquent  debts
totaling
approximately  $5,548.  (¶¶  1.f-1.m)  Applicant  denied  owing  these  debts  in  her  SOR
answer.  She  renewed  her  denials  in  her  FORM  response.  She  avers  that  she  had  no
knowledge of the debts, that the debt was paid, or that she has disputed the debt. When
she  provided  additional  information  to  her  background  investigator  in  a  letter  dated
February  4,  2020,  she  admitted  many  of  the  debts  that  she  has  recently  denied.  She
admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.f, 1.g, 1.i, and 1.m. All the debts are listed in Applicant’s most recent
credit  report  from  December  2021.  She  presented  no  documentary  evidence  showing
payment of any of these debts or of her successfully disputing any debts. These debts
are unresolved. (Items 2, 5 (p. 15), 7; AE A)
The  Government presented  evidence of  Applicant’s 2011 Chapter 7 bankruptcy,
which  resulted  in  the  discharge  of  her  debts.  The  bankruptcy  was  not  alleged  in  the
SOR so I will not use that evidence for disqualification purposes, but I may consider it
as it relates to the applicability of any mitigating conditions, and in my assessment of the
whole-person factors. (Item 10)
Applicant  completed  an  income  and  expense  worksheet  in  October  2020.  It
showed her net monthly income of $4,300—her total monthly expenses of $2,200—and
monthly debts payments of $1,821, resulting in her disposable monthly income of $279.
No  federal tax payments  were  included  in  this budget.  She  stated  in  her SOR  answer
that she had received financial counseling through her bank and a credit relief company.
