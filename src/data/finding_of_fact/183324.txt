Applicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for

he has held since about 2017. He is a high school graduate with college credits, but no
degree. He is married with a child who is almost four years old. (Items 3, 5)
The  SOR  alleges  11  delinquent  debts  totaling  about  $51,400.  The  SOR  also
alleges an auto loan that is $958 past due, with a balance of $35,173, and a loan from a
credit union that is $935 past due, with a balance of $1,981. The debts are established
through Applicantâ€™s admissions and a January 2022 credit report. (Items 2, 4, 5)
Applicant  discussed  his  financial  problems  and  delinquent  debts  during  his
background  interview in  October 2021.  He  attributed  his financial problems  to  his wife
losing  her  job  in  March  2019.  She  was  unable  to  find  a  job  during  the  COVID-19
pandemic.  Applicant  took  many  days  of  unpaid  leave  to  help  his  wife  with  their  baby,
who  was  born  in  2018.  He  stated  that  his  finances  were  better;  he  made  some
payments on his delinquent debts; and he planned to pay all of the debts.  (Item 5) He
provided no documentation in his response to the SOR, and he did not respond to the
FORM, so more recent information about his finances is not available.
