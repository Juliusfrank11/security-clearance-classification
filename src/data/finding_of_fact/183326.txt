After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make
the following findings of fact:
Applicant  is  51  years  old  and  a  high  school  graduate  with  about  three  years  of
college credits. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from January 1995 until January
1999, when he was honorably discharged. He has been married, since October 2010. He
was  previously  married  and  divorced,  from  May  1995  to  September  1998  and  from
September 2000 to April 2008. He has three adult children, two adult stepchildren, and
one  minor  stepson.  Since  September  2019,  he  has  been  employed  by  a  defense
contractor. (Items 2 and 5.)
Of financial interest, in 2016, Applicant’s spouse lost her job. In September 2018,
he became unemployed until February 2019. As a result, he could not make his auto loan
payments.  Applicant did  a voluntary repossession  of his auto in  March  2020.  (Item 5.)
The SOR debts were reported in collection status in April or May 2020.
The  SOR  alleged  four  delinquent  debts  totaling  $23,630.  (Item  1S.)  More
specifically, the SOR debts and Applicant’s Answers are as follow:
SOR ¶¶ 1.a. and 1.b. are two debts in collection for $568 and $623, respectively.
(Item 1S.) Applicant admitted these allegations, saying: “[I] will be making arrangements
to pay these.”  Applicant provided no documents in support. (Item 1A.) These debts are
not resolved.
SOR  ¶1.c.  is  a  debt  charged  off  for  $9,402.  (Item  1S.)  Applicant  admitted  this
allegation,  saying:  “Unable  to  handle  at  this  time.”  (Item  1A.)  Applicant  provided  no
documents in support. This debt is not resolved.
SOR ¶1.d. is a delinquent auto loan charged off for $12,767. (Item 1S.) Applicant
admitted  this allegation,  saying:  “Received  1099C,  Cancellation of  Debt,  that was  filed
with 2020 Taxes.” He provided a copy of the 1099C and a copy of his 2020 federal tax
return showing that he declared the cancellation as income. (Item 1A.) This debt has been
resolved.
Law and Policies
It  is  well  established  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.  As  the
that  security

determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.” Department of the Navy

for  a   security   clearance,  an
When   evaluating   an   applicant’s  suitability
administrative   judge   must  consider  the   adjudicative   guidelines.  These   guidelines  are
flexible  rules of  law  that apply  together with  common  sense  and  the  general factors of  the
whole-person  concept.  An  administrative  judge  must  consider all  available and  reliable
information  about the  person,  past and  present,  favorable  and  unfavorable,  in  making  a
decision.   The   protection   of   the   national  security   is  the   paramount   consideration.  AG  ¶
¶2(b)  requires  that  “[a]ny   doubt  concerning   personnel  being   considered   for  national
security eligibility  will be resolved in  favor of the national security.”
Under  Directive   ¶   E3.1.14,   the   Government   must  present  evidence   to   establish
controverted  facts alleged  in  the  SOR. Under Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  then  the  applicant  is
responsible  for presenting  “witnesses and  other evidence  to  rebut,  explain, extenuate, or
mitigate  facts admitted  by  applicant or proven  by  Department Counsel. . . .” The  applicant
has the  ultimate  burden of  persuasion in seeking a  favorable security decision.
