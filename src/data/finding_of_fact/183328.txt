Applicant  is  39  years  old.  He  has  never  been  married  and  has  no  children.  He
received a high school diploma in 2003. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from
February 2006 until May 2008, when he was honorably discharged. He has worked as an
aircraft structural mechanic for his current employer, a DOD contractor, since May 2021.
He previously held a secret clearance when he served in the Army. (Item 3; Item 4)
The SOR alleges that Applicant has ten delinquent debts totaling approximately
$23,310.  He  admitted  all  SOR  allegations  and  provided  no  explanation  or  supporting
documentation in his response to the SOR. (Items 2-4)
In Applicant’s June 2021 SCA, he disclosed some of the debts alleged in the SOR.
He indicated his debts became delinquent after his previous job was “restructured,” and
he lost pay; therefore, he could not afford to pay his credit card bills. Additionally, he wrote
that he was taking a new job and could start paying his debts. He did not provide details
regarding the new job, but he was most likely referencing the  DOD contractor position
that he started in May 2021, as he disclosed no periods of unemployment. (Item 3)
Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator  in  July  2021,  and  he
provided  additional  information  regarding  the  “restructuring”  of  his  previous  job.  He
worked  for  his  former  employer  from  April  2013  to  April  2021.  In  2017  or  2018,  his
supervisory position was eliminated, and he took a $5 an hour pay cut to continue working
for his employer. At the time of the interview, he stated that he had a plan to pay his debts
by July 2024, but did not provide details. (Items 2-3)
Applicant provided no documentation in his response to the SOR, nor a response
to the FORM. There is no evidence in the record that he has resolved or is resolving any
of the debts alleged in the SOR. (Items 2-4)
