In  Applicant’s answer to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  allegations  in SOR  ¶¶  1.a-d and
denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.e-f. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of
fact.
Applicant is a 66-year-old operations supervisor employed by a federal contractor
since September 2017. He attended a community college and a university between 1981
and 1985. He is divorced and has one adult child. His SCA reflects that he held a security
clearance from 1983 to 1986. (FORM Item 3 at 35.)
Applicant disclosed in his SCA that he had not filed his state income tax return for
tax  year  for  2017  and  his  federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  for  2018.  In  a  security
clearance interview, he stated that he had not filed his federal and state tax returns for
tax year 2020.  He admitted he owed an estimated total of $5,000 in federal taxes and
$2,500  in  state  taxes.  (FORM  Item  4  at  2.)  In  response  to  DOHA  interrogatories,  he
provided his Internal Revenue Service (IRS) account transcripts which disclosed he failed
to file, as required, his federal tax returns for tax years 2018 and 2020; and he is indebted
to the IRS in the amount of $6,800 for tax year 2019. He noted in the interrogatories he
had not made an Offer of Compromise or  was in any payment arrangement to pay his
delinquent taxes.  (FORM Item  5 at  2.)  His failures  to file federal and  state  income tax
returns are alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.c.
A March 2022 credit report reflects a last payment date of February 2022, reducing
the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e from $1,334 to $949. (FORM Item 8 at 4.) Applicant told
the  security  investigator  he  disputed  the  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.f  ($1,419),  and  had
made no effort to resolve it. (FORM Item 7 at 2.) In response to DOHA interrogatories
regarding both debts, SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f, he indicated that neither debt had been paid
and that payment arrangements had been made.
