Applicant is a 30-year-old prospective employee of a defense contractor. He will
be hired if he obtains a security clearance. He has a bachelor’s degree earned in 2015
and  additional  post-graduate  classes  in  pursuit  of  a  master’s  degree.  He  married  in
2014 and divorced in 2017. He and his ex-wife have a child together, and he has a child
with his fiancée. (Transcript (Tr.) at 9, 20-21, 26-28, 63; GE 1; AE H)
Applicant was arrested in 2015 and charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI)
and  felony  grand  larceny-auto  theft.  He  pleaded  guilty  to  DWI  and  the  lesser
misdemeanor charge of unauthorized use of a vehicle. He was sentenced to 12 months
in jail, with 11 months suspended for the unauthorized use of a vehicle charge. For the
DWI charge, he was sentenced to 60 days in jail, with 55 days suspended; probation for
12  months;  a  fine;  and  court  costs.  His  driver’s  license  was  restricted,  and  he  was
required  to  attend  alcohol  education  classes.  (Tr.  at  25-26;  Applicant’s  response  to
SOR; GE 1, 3, 4)
Applicant  admitted  that  he  was  drunk  when  he  was  arrested.  He  stated  that he
drove  a  short distance from  a  bar  to  a  7-11  that  was  next  to  an  IHOP.  He  left  his car
running at the 7-11 with an open alcoholic beverage inside that was left by his  cousin.
He  was  arrested  as  he  was  coming  out  of  the  IHOP.  He  fit  the  race  and  general
description of someone  who  took a mall officer’s vehicle  at the mall  close to where the
bar  was  located.  Applicant  does  not  think  that  he  took  the  mall  officer’s  car  because
Applicant’s  car  was  at  the  7-11  next  to  the  IHOP  running,  so  he  does  not  understand
how he could have driven both cars, but he blacked out and does not remember, so he
cannot completely rule it out. He accepted a plea bargain on the case because he did
not  want  to  risk  the  greater  consequences,  and  he  knew  that  he  was  very  drunk  and
should not have been driving. (Tr. at 45-48; GE 1, 3)
Applicant was arrested in June 2018 and charged with DWI, second offense. He
was stopped after making an illegal left turn. He had two to three beers, but he did not
feel  that  he  was  intoxicated.  He  stated  the  police  officer  had  difficulty  with  the
breathalyzer. He retained an attorney and was going to contest the case, but decided to
plead  guilty  with  a  plea  bargain.  He  was  sentenced  to  90  days  in  jail,  with  80  days
suspended; a  fine; and  his driver’s license  was suspended  for an extended period.  He
completed  all  of  the  terms  of  his  sentence,  except  his  license  is  still  suspended.  The
suspension will end in February 2023, but he will require an Interlock ignition device for
an additional two years. (Tr. at 21-22, 50-57, 61; GE 1, 3, 4)
Applicant has not been involved in any criminal activity since his 2018 arrest. He
drank  on  rare  occasions  for  about  two  years  following  the  arrest,  and  he  has  been
completely  abstinent  for  about  two  years.  His  fiancée  does  not  drink,  and  he  has  a
health condition that precludes the use of alcohol.  He regularly attends church, and he
is committed to a healthy lifestyle that includes physical fitness. (Tr. at 22-23, 44-45, 54,
62; GE 3)
Applicant did not file his federal and state income tax returns when they were due
for  tax  year  2018.  He  had  some  problems  with  his  tax  preparer,  and  the  returns  got
away  from  him.  The  returns  were  filed  in  April  2020.  The  returns indicate  that  he  was
due  refunds of  $709 from the IRS and $73 from  the  state. There are  no other income
tax issues. (Tr. at 29-32; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 3; AE L)
The  SOR  alleges  the  untimely  2018  tax  returns,  a  charged-off  auto  loan  for
$12,556  after  the  vehicle  was  repossessed,  and  21  defaulted  student  loans  totaling
about  $100,671.  The  debts  are  established  through  credit  reports  and  Applicant’s
admissions.
Applicant  attributed  his
to  his  divorce  and  custody
financial  problems
proceedings; child support; a government shutdown; the pandemic; and the court fees,
fines, and attorney’s fees associated with his two DWIs. (Tr. at 18, 24, 61)
In December 2020, Applicant started paying $100 per month to the credit union
for the $12,556 charged-off auto loan. The creditor charged off $13,661, but the balance
was reduced by payments. He made nine payments through August 2021. The balance
was  reduced  to  $11,856  by  the  August  2021  credit  report;  $11,556  by  the  June  2022
credit  report;  and  $11,195  by  the  date  of  the  hearing.  He  recently  settled  the  debt  for
$8,000, payable in at least 21 monthly payments of $361. (Tr. at 20, 39-40; GE 5-8; AE

Applicant’s  federal  student  loans  are  paused  because  of  COVID  relief,  and  he
restarted college this fall. However, Applicant decided the best course of action was not
to  stand  on  the  deferments,  but  to  aggressively  pay  down  the  loans.  He  lives  at  his
parents’  house  with  his  fiancée  and  their  child.  He  does  not  own  a  car.  His  fiancée
works and contributes to their income. He has been paying $1,172 per month toward all
of  the loans since April 1, 2022, but he plans to increase the payments. He intends to
live at his parent’s home for two to three years. (Tr. at 18-20, 26-28, 33-39, 61-63; GE 3;
AE F, H-K)
Applicant  reported his two  alcohol-related arrests, his failure  to file his  2018 tax
returns, the delinquent auto loan, and the defaulted student loans on his January 2020
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). He completed a number of IT and
cyber certifications that make him more valuable to an employer, and he  is four credits
short of completing his graduate degree in the cyber field. His mother is a retired military
officer and provides him guidance and moral support. (Tr. at 23-28, 61; GE 1; AE A-E) I
found him to be open, honest, and candid about all of the issues.
