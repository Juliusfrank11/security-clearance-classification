Applicant  is  a  43-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor  for  whom  he  has
worked  since  December  2017.  He  was  out  of  work  from  about  June  2016  until
September 2016 and from May 2017 until December 2017. Between January 2018 and
July  2018  he  attended  online  college  classes,  but  did  not  earn  a  degree.  He  is  twice
divorced,  and  he remarried  in  February 2017.  His  previous  marriages  were  from 2000
until 2010, and from 2010 until 2014. He has two stepchildren, ages 17 and 8. He also
has  three  children,  ages  11,  10,  and  2.  He  served  in  the  U.S.  Army  from  1997  until
2014, when he received an honorable discharge. (Tr. 24, 49; GE 1)
Under  Guideline  F,  the  Government  alleged  Applicant’s  three  delinquent
consumer debts totaling about $42,000 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.c). In his SOR Answer,
he denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b  with additional comments. He did not
respond  to  the  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  1.c,  so  I  have  treated  his  lack  of  response  as  a
denial.  These  allegations  are  established  by  the  Government’s  evidence,  including
credit reports. (Tr. 25-47; Answer; GE 2-7)
Under  Guideline  J,  the  Government  alleged  Applicant’s  June  2022  arrest  and
charge of false report to a police officer (SOR ¶ 2.a). The Government cross alleged this
allegation under Guideline E (SOR ¶ 3.a). He did not respond to the allegations in SOR
¶¶ 2.a and 3.a, so I have treated his lack of response as denials. (Tr. 47-66, 69-80; GE
7-10)
The delinquent auto loan in the amount of $19,923 alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a has not
been resolved. In his Answer, Applicant claimed this debt is fraudulent and has fallen off
his credit report because of his claims about its validity. Applicant opened this account
to  purchase a  vehicle in  2013.  In  2015, he  voluntarily surrendered the  vehicle  back  to
the  dealership  as  he  claimed  he  was  having  electrical  problems  with  it.  In  2015,  he
attempted  to  make  payment  arrangements  with  the  creditor,  but  was  unable  to  do  so.
He included this debt in a 2015 Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition that was dismissed that
same year, so the debt was not discharged. This debt is listed in the 2018 credit report
but not in any subsequent credit reports. (Tr. 25-35, Answer, GE 4, 5)
The delinquent personal loan in the amount of $15,320 alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b has
not  been  resolved.  In  his  Answer,  Applicant  claimed  this  debt  is  fraudulent  and  has
been  disputed  because  of  its  “consistency  and  validity.”  He  claimed  that  this  creditor
was  known  to  unfairly  target  young  service  members,  engaged  in  predatory  lending
practices,  and  is  no  longer  in  business.  Applicant  opened  this  account  in  2013,  and
used it for every day purchases. He claims that he paid the balance on this account in
full  prior  to  his  2015  bankruptcy  petition.  However,  he  provided  no  documentary
evidence regarding his payments or to substantiate the basis for his dispute. This debt
is  listed  in  the  2018  credit  report  but  not  in  any  subsequent  credit  reports.  (Tr.  35-41;
Answer, GE 4)
The delinquent auto refinance loan in the amount of $7,271 alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c
has not been resolved. Applicant opened this account in July 2019 for a “refi cash out”
on a vehicle he owned. Applicant’s first missed payment on this account was in August
2020 and the loan was charged off in September 2021. Applicant claimed that he was in
contact  with  the  creditor  in  July  2020.  He  claimed  he  was  able  to  make  payments  on
this  account,  but  he  no  longer  needed  or  wanted  the  vehicle,  because  he  had
purchased another vehicle. He wanted to return the vehicle in order to cancel the loan,
but  the  creditor  was  not  willing  to  accept  his  offer.  In  July  2020,  he  voluntarily
surrendered  the  vehicle  and  tried  to  make  payment  arrangements  on  the  account
balance  but  was  unable  to  come  to  an  agreement  with  the  creditor.  He  claimed  that
after the  account  was  charged  off,  the  account  was  moved  to another creditor and he
has been unable to locate that creditor in order to try to make payment arrangements.
He  claimed  that  he  has  been  trying  to  contact  them  for  the  last  month.  This  debt
appears on the 2021 and 2022 credit reports. (Tr. 27, 41-47; GE 2, 6)
Applicant purchased a home in 2017. He earns $62,000 annually. His take home
pay  is  about  $2,250  every  two  weeks.  He  has  a  100  percent  disability  rating  with  the
Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  (VA)  and  receives  $5,500  in  monthly  benefits.  He
suffers from a brain injury that is combat related. His wife is a full-time student. He has
two  checking  accounts  with  balances  of  $10,000  and  $2,500.  He  claims  that  he  has
about $4,500 left over at the end of the month after paying all his expenses. (Tr. 26, 41,
66-68)
In  December  2021,  Applicant’s  spouse  was  involved  in  a  traffic  accident  with
another vehicle driven by an off-duty police officer. His spouse and three of his children
were in the car and suffered minor injuries. His spouse called him immediately after the
accident  and he drove  to the accident scene. When  he arrived,  he noticed  that two  of
his  children  were  bleeding  and  another  was  crying.  Applicant  was  understandably
upset. The driver of the other vehicle involved in the accident was taking pictures of the
damage  to  both  vehicles.  In  Applicant’s  opinion,  the  other  driver  was  too  close  to  his
vehicle  and  was  unconcerned  with  the  health  of  Applicant’s  spouse  and  children.
Applicant  told the  other driver to  back away  from  Applicant’s  vehicle  and  an  argument
ensued. At some point during this argument, the other driver told Applicant that he was
an off-duty police officer and showed Applicant his badge. During the argument, the off-
duty  police  officer  put  his  hands  on  Applicant’s  chest  and  his  face,  and  knocked
Applicant’s  hat  off  his  head.  Applicant  responded  by  knocking  the  off-duty  police
officer’s  hat  off  his  head.  He  and  the  off-duty  police  officer  were  then  separated  by
bystanders. (Tr. 25-26, 46-56, 69-72; GE 7-10)
When  on-duty  police  officers  arrived  at  the  scene  of  the  accident,  Applicant
informed  them  that  he  wished  to  file  a  complaint  against  the  off-duty  police  officer
involved in the accident. The on-duty police officers directed Applicant to internal affairs
(IA)  and  another  unnamed  police  entity  with  oversight  duties.  He  subsequently  filed  a
complaint against the off-duty police officer with IA and the other unnamed police entity.
In   January   2022,  he   met  in-person   with   IA   and   provided   information   regarding   his
complaint  against  the  off-duty  police  officer. At the  beginning  of  the  interview  with  IA, he
let  them  know  that  he  suffers from  a  brain  injury  and  may  not remember some  details  of
the  altercation.  In  March  2022, he  met  with  IA  again.  At  this  meeting, the  officers  with  IA
told Applicant  they  were not able to  substantiate  the  information  he  provided  them   and
the  other unnamed  entity.  IA  also  told  him  that the  information  he  provided  to  IA  and  the
unnamed   entity   was  inconsistent.   Applicant   claimed   IA   did  not   tell   him   what  these
inconsistencies  were. During  this meeting  with  IA, he  informed IA  that he  wished  to  drop
his  complaint   against   the   off-duty   police   officer.  He  did   not  want  to   ruin   the   off-duty
police   officer’s  career,  but  simply   wanted   him   reprimanded   for  his  inappropriate
behavior.  (Tr. 56-66, 72-80; GE 7-10)
In  June  2022,  Applicant  learned  that  he  had  a  warrant  out  for  his  arrest  for
making a false report to a police officer. The warrant was filed in March 2022, but he did
not know about it until a police officer with IA called him to tell him about it in June 2022.
He  drove  to  the  police  station  and  turned  himself  in.  At  the  police  station,  he  was
arrested and charged with making a false report to a police officer. He was released on
bond.  As  of  the  date of  the  hearing  in  this matter, these  charges  are  still  pending.  He
claimed  that  he  does  not  know  what  information  that  he  provided  to  either  IA  or  the
other unnamed police entity is considered false or untrue. He claimed that he provided
IA  and the  other unnamed entity truthful information  and denied filing a false  report or
engaging in any criminal activity or behavior. (Tr. 56-66, 72-80; GE 7-10)
