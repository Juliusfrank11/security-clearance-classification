The SOR alleges four delinquent debts totaling about $42,000. In his answers to
the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  factual  allegations  in  the  SOR  and  submitted
documentary evidence showing that he had resolved or paid the accounts alleged in SOR
¶¶ 1.a (cancellation of debt dated December 31, 2019; AE A), 1.b (settled and paid; AE
B), and 1.d (settled and paid in August 2020; AE C).
Applicant’s SOR admissions, and those at his hearing, are incorporated herein as
findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  review  of  the  record  evidence,  I  make  the  following
additional findings of fact:
Applicant is 61 years old. He earned a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering
in  1983,  a  master’s  in  computer  engineering  in  2002,  and  started  a  second  master’s
degree in 2018. (Tr2. 6) He married in 1998 and divorced in June 2006. (AE L) He has a
son, age 21, and a daughter, age 17. (Tr2. 8, AE J)
Applicant’s employment history shows he worked as a systems engineer between
September  2001  and  January  2009,  making  approximately  $103,000  a  year.  He  was
unemployed  between  February  2009  and  August  2010.  He  was  self-employed  as  a
handyman  between  September  2010  and  August  2011,  while  seeking  full-time
employment. He worked as a systems engineer between September 2011 and January
2017, making about $89,000 a year. He was unemployed between February 2017 and
December  2017.  He  has  been  working  as  a  senior  specialist  systems  engineer  for  a
defense contractor, his security sponsor, since January 2018. His annual income is about
$111,000.
In  response  to  questions  in  Section  26  (Financial  Record)  of  his  2018  SCA,
Applicant disclosed that he had financial problems and revealed the four accounts alleged
in the SOR and that he owed property taxes (not alleged in the SOR). He established that
he  had  been  in  contact  with  his  creditors  and  was  making  payments  on  some  of  his
delinquent  accounts.  An  investigator  with  the  Office  of  Personnel Management  (OPM)
interviewed Applicant in December 2018, and he discussed the accounts alleged in the
SOR and other accounts that were not alleged because he had resolved them.
Applicant  explained  that  his  financial  problems  resulted  from  a  combination  of
factors, including his 2006 divorce, and two unemployment periods. After his divorce, he
was required to provide alimony for his ex-wife, child support for two children, and for the
financial  support  of  two  households.  The  additional  expenses  strained  his  financial
situation. He was laid off from his job and was unemployed between February 2009 and
August 2010. He  worked as a  handyman between September 2010 and August 2011,
while seeking full-time employment.
Applicant’s financial problems and the four debs alleged in the SOR resulted from
this  period  of  unemployment  and  underemployment.  He  used  his  credit  to  pay  for  his
mortgage, car note, and family’s living expenses. He was the sole source of income and
his income was insufficient to pay the delinquent accounts and their living expenses. After
he found employment, he  took  some  time to get  his financial  situation  stable. He then
contacted his creditors and tried to pay his delinquent debts, but the interest charges were
so high that he had difficulty paying off the debs.
Applicant  was  laid  off  and  unemployed  again  between  February  2017  and
December  2017.  He  stated  that  he  learned  his  lesson  from  his  first  period  of
unemployment,  and  he  avoided  acquiring  any  additional  delinquent  debts  during  his
second unemployment period. He went into a cash only expense policy where if he did
not have the cash to pay for something he would not buy it. He has continued with this
cash  only  policy  to  present.  He  believes  that  because  of  his  stable  employment  and
current financial situation he will not have the same financial problems in the future.  In
April 2022, he participated in online financial counseling. (AE 1, Tab M)
Applicant’s priority has always been to take care of his children’s needs first and
then to pay his home mortgage and other secured obligations. Applicant highlighted that
because of his good financial practices  he was able to pay off his mortgage and a car
note.
When Applicant contacted the creditor of the account alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a to try
to settle or establish a payment plan, the creditor offered him a cancellation of debt on
December 31, 2019. (AE A; Tr. 20-21) Concerning the accounts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b
and 1.d, he submitted documentary evidence showing that he had settled and paid both
accounts. (AE B and AE C)
SOR  ¶  1.c  alleged  a  2015,  $12,583  judgment  entered  against  Applicant.
Apparently, he was wrongfully advised not pay it and to let it fall off his credit report, but
after understanding  the  consequences,  he  considered  it  a  bad  idea.  He  contacted  the
creditor  several times to  try to  settle or establish  a payment  plan, with  no  results.  The
creditor did not want to settle for less than owed.  At hearing, Applicant testified that he
had made four payments on this account and reduced it to about $10,500. He made one
payment in June 2017, apparently while trying to establish a payment plan. He made one
payment  in  March  2022  and  two  in  April  2022.  Post-hearing,  Applicant  submitted
documentary evidence showing he paid $1,800 in May 2022, and his current balance is
$8,719. (AE 1, Tab N)
Concerning his current financial situation, Applicant believes it is very stable and
he lives comfortably within his means. He has been working diligently to bring his financial
situation under control. He is able and willing to pay his delinquent debts and promised
to be financially responsible in the future. He is confident that he will be able to resolve
any  future  financial  problems.  He  has  a  savings  account  with  about  $4,000,  checking
account with close to $2,000, and his 401k retirement account has close to $400,000. (Tr.
39-40)
At  hearing,  Applicant  acknowledged  he  owed  property  taxes  on  his  home.  He
testified he intended to pay his delinquent property taxes after his hearing. Documentary
evidence submitted post-hearing shows he paid the property tax owed ($9,832) in May
2022. (AE 1, Tab P) I find that Applicant was candid and forthcoming during the clearance
process. He revealed his financial problems in his 2018 SCA, and discussed his financial
problems during his interview and at his hearing.
