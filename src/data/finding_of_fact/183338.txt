contractor since  2013.  (Tr. 6, 37-38) In  1990, he  graduated  from  high  school. (Tr. 7, 28)
In  about 2002, he  earned  an  associate’s degree  in aviation  maintenance  technology, and
in 2003, he  was awarded  a  bachelor’s degree  in aviation  aerospace  management.  (Tr. 7,
29)  He has  an  airframe  and  power plant  license  for aviation.  (Tr.  31)  He was on  active
duty  from  November 2019  to  June  2022,  and  in June  2022, he  resumed  working  for his
current employer. (Tr. 39-41)  He had  a  reduction  in  annual  pay  from  about  $98,000  to
about $70,000 while he was on active duty. (Tr. 60-62)
Applicant was married the first time from 1992 to 1997, and the second time from

Financial Considerations
SOR  ¶   1.a   alleges   Applicant filed  for discharge   of   liabilities   totaling   $149,105   in
January   2014   under  Chapter  7   of   the   Bankruptcy   Code,  and   the   bankruptcy   judge
discharged  his nonpriority  unsecured  debts in  April 2015. (GE  1  at 35; GE  2  at 9; GE  6  at
1)  The  secured  claims  totaled  $110,935;  the  priority  claims were $850; and  the  unsecured
nonpriority  claims were $37,320. (GE  2  at  9) Around  2012,  Applicant  and  his second  wife
separated, and he was unable to pay the bills without her income. (Tr. 44)  In 2013, his
starting pay was about $24 an hour. (Tr. 42) When he filed for bankruptcy, Applicant was
$24,000 behind on his $107,604 mortgage, and the fair market value of the property was
substantially below the amount of the mortgage. (Tr. 112; GE 2 at 16) The bankruptcy
documentation  indicates  Applicant’s  monthly  income  over  the  previous  six  months
averaged $5,647, and his IRS tax transcript showed his income for Tax Year (TY) 2014
was about $109,000. (Tr. 113) Applicant suggested that perhaps the extra funds on his
TY 2014 tax return came from his military duties, overtime with his contractor employer,
or a cash payout from a previous employer. (Compare Tr. 116 with GE 2 at 49-51) He
understood that his income could not exceed the threshold in the bankruptcy statute, or
he would not qualify for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge of his debts. (Tr. 114-115) He
said he would provide documentation after his hearing to show his income statement on
his bankruptcy was correct. (Tr. 117, 121) He did not provide the evidence showing the
income  on  his  bankruptcy  submission  was  accurate.  His  bankruptcy  documentation
included a $2,576 state tax lien. (Tr. 48)
SOR ¶  1.b  alleges Applicant owes delinquent federal taxes totaling  $6,112 for TY
2014.  (GE 3  at 2, 9)  His September 24, 2020  IRS  tax  transcript for  TY  2014  shows an
account balance  of  $9,177  owed  to  the  IRS, and  it shows IRS  tax  transfers to  address his
TY  2014  tax  debt from  TY  2017  of  $1,143, from  TY  2018  of  $1,037, and  from  TY  2019  of
$647. (GE 4  at 9-10) He also made  a  $143  payment on  March 10,  2020. (Id.) On  February
14,  2020,  Applicant told  an  Office  of Personnel Management  (OPM)  investigator that  he
“arranged  a  payment plan  with  the  IRS,  and  made  on-time  payments until [he] defaulted.”
(GE  10   at  2)  He  did   not  resume   payments.   (Id.)  He  told   the   OPM   investigator  that  he
intended  to  borrow  funds from  his 401k account to  pay  his delinquent tax  debt. (GE  10  at
4)  His tax  transcripts for TY  2014  did not show  a  repayment  plan  with  the  IRS. (GE  4  at
10; AE  B) His October 1, 2021 IRS  tax transcript for TY 2014 shows an account balance
of  $6,112. (AE  B) Applicant’s October 1, 2021  IRS  tax  transcript for TY  2020  shows on
April 15,  2021, he  had  a  $1,332  credit transferred  to  address  his  TY  2014  tax  debt, and
he  received  a  $360  refund. (GE  3  at 18)  The  $360  refund  shows all of  his federal income
taxes are paid through  TY 2020.
SOR  ¶¶  1.c  and  1.d  allege  Applicant  failed  to  timely  file  his  federal  and  state
income tax returns for TYs 2010, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018. (GE 3)
On September 30, 2021, in response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant did not
fill in the rows in the tables showing his federal and state tax returns were filed for TYs
2010, 2012, and 2013. (GE 3 at 2, 4) His September 24, 2020 TY 2015 IRS tax transcript
indicates in 2018 the IRS assessed an additional tax of $1,900;  he had a $274 penalty
for filing his tax return late; and no payments were shown to address his tax debt. (GE 4
at 5-6) His account balance owed on September 24, 2020, was $5,593. (GE 4 at 5) He
said he paid this tax debt. (GE 3 at 2) The IRS $360 refund of his TY 2020 taxes shows
the IRS concluded all of his previous federal income taxes were paid. (GE 3 at 18)
The information in the following table is based on Applicant’s September 24, 2020
and October 1, 2021 IRS tax transcripts. (GE 4; AE A-AE D) Adjusted gross income is
rounded to the nearest thousand dollars. He did not provide tax transcripts for TYs 2010,
2012, and 2013.

Applicant’s October 1, 2021 TY 2011 IRS tax transcript shows he had an IRS tax
payment agreement from November 2016 to February 2018. (GE 3 at 8) He made nine
payments from $80 to $155. (Id.) In October 2018, his debt to the IRS for TY 2011 was
paid. (Id.)
Applicant’s  September  25,  2020  TY  2016  IRS  tax  transcript  indicates  the  IRS
assessed an additional penalty of $125 for filing his tax return late; and his September
24, 2020 IRS tax transcript for TY 2016 shows an account balance owed of $327. (GE 4
at 7-8) He said he paid this tax debt. (GE 3 at 2)
On February 14, 2020, Applicant told an OPM investigator that he timely filed his
2015 and 2016 state tax returns. (GE 10 at 2) He said he would provide information about
when he filed some of his tax returns after his hearing. (Tr. 52) At the time of his hearing,
he had not filed his federal and state tax returns for TY 2021; he had not requested an
extension; and he said he needs additional documentation to get his tax return filed. (Tr.
53-55) On September 17, 2022, Applicant paid a bill of $275 for  preparation of one or
more tax returns. (AE E) This is apparently a receipt for preparation of his TY 2021 federal
and state income tax returns. Applicant said all of his tax debts were paid. (Tr. 50)
In sum, Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for
TYs 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018. There was no evidence presented  that he requested
any filing extensions. Applicant said he failed to timely file several tax returns because of
“neglect” and a lack of a “sense of urgency.” (Tr. 51) He suspected that he owed the IRS,
and he delayed filing his tax returns. (Tr. 51) His federal income taxes for TY 2011 were
not paid until 2018, and his federal income taxes for TY 2014 were not paid until April 15,
2021, when part of his refund for TY 2020 was transferred to address his TY 2014 tax
debt.
SOR ¶¶ 1.e through 1.j allege Applicant has six U.S. Department of Education (D.
ED.)  student  loan  debts  totaling  $35,398  in  collections  for  $9,282,  $5,052,  $10,163,
$1,418, $2,501, and $6,982. (Tr. 25; GE 5 at 2; GE 6 at 2-3; GE 7 at 4-5; GE 7 at 5; GE
11 at 2; GE 12)
Applicant said he  attempted  to  get his student loans forgiven; however, he  learned
he  was not eligible  to  have  his student loans  forgiven. (Tr. 58)  He intends to   pursue  a
master’s degree. (Tr.  58) Once  he  starts his master’s program, he  will  be  able  to  obtain a
forbearance  on  his student  loans. (Tr. 100) He  intends  to  pay  his student loans.  (Tr.  58)
He has  not made  any  payments  to  address his student  loans  since  about 2017. (Tr. 62-
63)  He did not present  documentary evidence to show his most recent payments.
In March 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the President directed the
Department  of  Education  (D.ED.)  to  place  federal  student  loans  in  forbearance.  The
federal  government  extended  the  student  loan  payment  pause  through  December  31,
2022. The pause includes the following relief measures for eligible loans: a suspension
of  loan payments; a 0% interest rate; and stopped collections on defaulted loans.  See
Federal  Student  Aid  website,  https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19.
The   President   announced   forgiveness  of   $10,000   or  $20,000   of   student  loan   debt;
however,  this  program  is  currently   on   hold   due   to   litigation   in   the   8th   Circuit  Court  of
Appeals.  See  Desiree  Montilla,  “Experts weigh  in on  temporary  hold  placed  on  student
loan   forgiveness  plan,”  (Oct.  24,   2022),  https://www.nbc12.com/2022/10/24/experts-
weigh-temporary-stay-placed-student-loan-forgiveness-plan/.
SOR ¶ 1.k alleges a charged-off debt for $22,619. (GE 5 at 2; GE 6 at 4; GE 7 at
6;  GE  11 at 2; GE 12)  Applicant was  in  an accident, and his car was  damaged  to the
extent that it was not economically repairable. (Tr. 63 106) He was injured in the accident;
however, he did not indicate  that he lost income due to the accident. (Tr. 106) His car
insurance had lapsed, and he acknowledged his responsibility for the debt. (Tr. 64) He
said he made two payments on his loan to purchase the vehicle, and then the creditor
advised him the debt was charged off. (Tr. 64-65) He said the creditor stopped accepting
payments. (Tr. 67) He intends to pay this debt. (Tr. 65) He said he would try to get some
documentation  about  the  debt  after  the  hearing;  however,  he  did  not  provide  anything
about this debt after the hearing. (Tr. 68)
Applicant received  financial counseling  as part of  the  bankruptcy  process. (GE 2
at  61)  He  maintains   a   budget.   (Tr.  99)  He   has  about  $40,000   in   his  401k   retirement
account.  (Tr. 102) He has about $1,500  monthly  remaining  after paying  his expenses. (Tr.
99) He  intends  to  use  the  $1,500  monthly  discretionary  income  or remainder to  assist his
son  with  his college  expenses, to  travel to  his son’s sports events,  and  to  pay  for his son’s
car. (Tr. 100-101)
Sexual Behavior,  Personal Conduct, and Information Technology
SOR ¶  2.a  alleges under the  sexual behavior guideline  that  Applicant videotaped
women’s buttocks  and  genital areas without  their  knowledge  or consent  prior to  October
2017  for sexual gratification.  (GE 8)
SOR ¶ 3.a alleges under the personal conduct guideline that Applicant received a
corrective action memo (CAM) in about December 2017, from his employer for: allowing
his employer-issued phone (EIP) to be accessed by a non-employee; failing to take steps
to secure his password; and recording videos of sexually explicit material on his EIP. (Tr.
87; GE 8; GE 9 at 6)
SOR ¶ 3.b alleges under the personal conduct guideline that Applicant failed to
report to his facility security officer (FSO) that his former girlfriend stole his EIP until she
attempted to extort him for rent.
SOR ¶ 3.c alleges under the personal conduct guideline that Applicant used his
EIP to view pornography from about January 2017 to about November 2017.
SOR  ¶  3.d  cross  alleges  under the  personal conduct  guideline  the  allegation  in
SOR ¶ 2.a.
SOR ¶ 4.a cross alleges under the information technology guideline the allegations
in SOR ¶¶ 3.a to 3.d.
Applicant videotaped women’s buttocks and genital areas prior to October 2017.
(Tr. 77, 91) According to the employer’s report, “The women pictured were fully clothed”
in the 25 videos found on Applicant’s EIP. (GE 9 at 6) About half of the videos were taken
of  several  women  at  stores  and  at  a  children’s  school.  (GE  9  at  19)  At  his  hearing,
Applicant claimed the videos were of only three women: his girlfriend, his fiancée, and a
woman in a store. (Tr. 78, 119) The 25 videos of women showed them wearing various
articles of clothing and of the crotch of one of the women while she was sitting facing him.
(Tr. 118) At his hearing, he said he used his personal cellphone and not his EIP to take
the  pictures  or  videos  of  the  women’s  buttocks  and  genitals.  (Tr.  92)  However,  his
employer’s report stated Applicant “admitted taking the videos using his [EIP] within the
last few months leading up to the investigation when his personal cell phone was broken.”
(GE 9 at 6)
Applicant  claimed   all   of   the   videos  were  with   the   consent  of   the   women   except
when   he   videotaped   one   woman   walking   in a   store  without   her consent.  (Tr. 117-118)
Applicant  said  at   his   hearing   that   the   woman   he   videotaped   in   the   store  was  wearing
slacks.  (Tr. 118) His girlfriend  said the  video  of  her was taken  without her consent,  and
she   said   multiple   women   were  videotaped   in   stores.   (GE   9   at  6)  He  denied   that  the
pictures he  took were pornographic.  (Tr. 80) He said  “Everybody  was fully  clothed.” (Tr.
80)  He said he  would provide  a  statement after his hearing  from  his fiancée  indicating  the
videos of  her body  were  made  with  her consent;  however, he  did not  provide  a  statement
from  her or an  explanation  for why  he  failed  to  provide  it. (Tr. 122) The  pictures  or videos
were not part of the  security  file  provided  to  me.  The  employer report indicated  no  nude
photographs were found on his EIP.
Applicant said he was trading his personal cell phone in for a replacement, and he
downloaded  his  pictures  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  2.a  onto  his  EIP.  (Tr.  75,  84)  He  also  had
pornography  on  his  personal  cell  phone  that  he  transferred  to  his  EIP;  however,  his
employer’s  report did not describe  any pornography found on his EIP. (Tr. 83-84) The
employer  report  described  the  pictures  and  videos  as  “inappropriate”  rather  than  as
pornographic. He said he wanted to preserve the pornography on his EIP so that he could
transfer it back to his new privately-owned phone. (Tr. 83, 92) He used the pornography
to  enable him  to  get  sexually aroused.  (Tr. 83)  At  his hearing,  he said  he  was  unsure
whether he used his EIP to view the pornography that he transferred from his personal
phone. (Tr. 84-85) He did not define the term “pornography.”
As to how his girlfriend obtained possession of his EIP, Applicant’s girlfriend was
visiting him. (Tr. 72-73) He knew her cell phone was broken, and she needed a cell phone.
(Tr. 72-73) He went to check on his son, and he left his girlfriend in the kitchen where his
EIP was located. (Tr. 73) When Applicant returned to the kitchen, his girlfriend was gone.
(Tr.  73)  Later  in  the  evening,  his  girlfriend  called  him,  and  Applicant  realized  she  was
using  his EIP.  (Tr.  74) He  left  his password  behind  the foam  padding  of  the  container
holding his EIP. (Tr. 74-75) She said she was going to use his EIP to conduct some of
her own business. (Tr. 74) She did not have access to classified information on the EIP.
(Tr.  75)  Applicant’s  girlfriend  returned  the  EIP  the  day  after  she  took  it.  (Tr.  79,  94)
Applicant  did  not  report  her  accessing  his  EIP  because  he  did  not  believe  she  could
access classified information on his EIP. (Tr. 94) His former girlfriend attempted to extort
rent of about $1,100 from him in return for her silence about the sexual videos on his EIP.
(Tr. 88; GE 10 at 2) Applicant refused to pay her to keep her from reporting the videos on
his EIP. (Id.)
Applicant learned that his employer knew about the incident involving his EIP when
his manager told him that a woman made allegations against him, and they wanted to
check his EIP. (Tr. 86) When he received the CAM, a manager told him that he made the
right decision when he chose not to give in to the woman’s extortion, and management
still  considered  him  to  be  a  trustworthy  employee.  (Tr.  88)  In  addition  to  the  CAM,
Applicant received about seven days of suspension from work without pay. (Tr. 87-88)
Applicant knew it was wrong to use his EIP to make and store videos of women’s buttocks.
(GE 9 at 8) Applicant told his employer that he did not want his fellow employees to know
about his videotaping of women’s buttocks.
Applicant’s former girlfriend also informed his Navy Reserve unit about the videos
on his EIP, and according to Applicant, his Navy Reserve unit said, “what you do is your
business, they said,  but it wasn’t our phone. It  wasn’t any of  our equipment. They said
they don’t condone that type of behavior, but that was basically it. The Navy was like, hey,
you know, this is not use. This is basically [your employer].” (Tr. 96) There is no evidence
of any adverse action from the Navy for the incident involving misuse of his EIP.
