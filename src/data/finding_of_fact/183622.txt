Applicant admitted  SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.g,  with  brief  explanations. Her admissions are
incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings
and the record evidence submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 44 years old. She has never married. She lives with her mother and
her 20-year-old daughter. Her daughter had health issues last year so Applicant took time
off from work to care for her. She  was not able to find stable employment with a good
income so she could not pay her bills until recently. (Tr. 30-33, 39)
Applicant  disclosed  details  about  her  employment  history  on  her  SCA  and
discussed  her  employment  history  during  her  testimony.  (GE  1;  Tr.  24-50)  After  the
hearing, she provided a résumé. (AE D)
Applicant has spent many years as a cleared government contractor working with
a variety of federal agencies. She was a document manager for a contractor for about
three years, from 2007-2010. She was then laid off at the end of the  contract and was
unemployed  for  about  a  year,  until  May  2011.  (GE  1)  She  then  worked  as  an
administrative assistant, with a security clearance, for a government contractor from May
2011 to March 2018, when her employer went out of business. She worked for another
contractor from March 2018 to July 2018 as a cleared escort into classified areas. She
left that job after a personality conflict with a supervisor. She then worked for a cleaning
company, cleaning secured buildings, for about six months in late 2018, earning $25 an
hour. (Tr. 40-47; GE 1; AE D)
Applicant worked as an administrative specialist with another government agency
(AGA) for most of 2019. She earned $22 an hour. She then worked as a contractor on an
Air Force Base during 2020 and 2021, earning $31 an hour. She was under-employed
during the COVID-19 pandemic due to the limited need for on-site security. She worked
for the first six months of 2022 with a medical transport company at $15 an hour but was
laid off in July 2022. She was then unemployed until two weeks before the hearing, when
she began working for a large retailer.  A prospective employer in the defense industry
has sponsored her for a clearance. If her clearance is granted, she expects to work as an
administrative assistant for a defense contractor, earning $62,000 annually. This would
put her in better position to address her debts, though not all at once. (Tr. 24-30, 35-40)
The SOR allegations concern six delinquent debts, totaling about $50,200, and a
2011 Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The debts are established by credit reports from March 2019
(SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f) and January 2021 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d), GE 3 and GE 4, respectively.
Applicant  filed  for  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  in  February  2011  during  a  period  of
unemployment after she was laid off at the end of an employment contract. She declared
$37,000 in liabilities. Her debts were discharged in May 2011. (GE 5)(SOR ¶ 1.g)
On   her  2019   SCA,   Applicant  disclosed   some   of  her  more  recent  debts  and
asserted  that they  were  due  to  lack of  work, resulting  in financial hardship.  (GE  1  at 32-
34)  She   also   discussed   her debts  and   financial  situation   in   her  May   2019   background
interview. (GE 6) The  debts are detailed  as follows:
SOR ¶  1.a  ($19,182) is a charged-off debt relating to an auto. In 2016, Applicant
purchased a used luxury vehicle for about $30,000. The car was repossessed after about
two  years. The  charged-off  amount  is what  is owed  on  the  vehicle after it  was  sold  at
auction. The creditor proposed a settlement amount of $13,000 but Applicant was unable
to pay it. She has taken no further action. (Tr. 51-54; GE 2; GE 3; GE 4 at 3) The debt
remains listed as charged off on a current credit report. (GE 7)
SOR ¶  1.b  ($2,726) is an account placed for collection. This debt concerns unpaid
rent for an apartment where Applicant lived from May 2015 to July 2018, when she was
evicted. The creditor initially worked with her to resolve the debt but it remains unpaid.
(Tr. 54-55; GE 2; GE 3)
SOR  ¶   1.c   ($437)  is  a  past-due  medical  debt  owed  to  an  unidentified  creditor.
Applicant said in her answer that she believes Medicaid should cover the debt. She does
not know what it is for. (GE 2, GE 3, GE 4; Tr. 55)
SOR  ¶   1.d   ($23,489)  is  a  charged-off  debt  related  to  an  auto  repossession.
Applicant  opened  the  account  in  August  2014,  she  made  the  most  recent  payment  in
February  2016,  and  it  was  reported  in  March  2021.  Applicant  has  taken  no  action  to
address the remaining debt owed. (GE 2; Tr. 56-57) While a recent credit report lists a
zero balance, there is no indication that this is due to actions by Applicant. (GE 7)
SOR ¶  1.e  ($4,335) is a charged-off debt relating to lease-to-own home furniture.
Applicant entered into the agreement in November 2017 and made one payment. She
did not return the furniture. She received a $2,000 settlement offer but was not able to
pay it. She has made no efforts to resolve the debt. (GE 4 at 4; Tr. 57-59)
SOR  ¶   1.f   ($54)  is  a  debt  placed  for  collection  by  a  power  company.  (GE  4)
Applicant  asserted  that  the  debt  is  paid.  After  the  hearing,  she  provided  corroborating
documentation. (Tr. 59-60, 71; AE C) This debt is resolved.
Applicant has lived with her mother since mid-2018. She pays $500 in rent to her
mother (formerly $900 a month). Her mother is a retired federal employee, and she pays
most of the household expenses. (GE 1; Tr. 39-40, 70) Applicant said she is current on
her taxes and has no other delinquent debts. She indicated no exorbitant expenses. She
does not use a budget. (Tr. 66-68)
Applicant  has  not  participated  in  recent  credit  counseling,  though  she  said  she
should do  so.  At  some  point, she retained a  debt-consolidation law firm, but they took
some of her money without taking action to address her debts. (Tr. 68-70)
With her answer to the SOR, Applicant provided two letters of recommendation,
both  from  former  co-workers  in  cleared  positions  at  government  contractor  jobs.  Both
references attest that she is knowledgeable, diligent, and a hard-working employee, as
well as honest, trustworthy, and dependable. She is also “a joy to work with” and a “team
player.” They recommend her for a security clearance. (AE A, AE B)
