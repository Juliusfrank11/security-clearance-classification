In his answer, Applicant admitted SOR allegations ¶¶ 1.a-1.f, 1.h -1.i, 1.o-1.p, and
denied 1.g, 1.j-1.n, and 1.q. He also provided seven pages of explanation and narrative,
which I have incorporated into my findings of fact. Based on my review of the pleadings,
evidence submitted, and testimony, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is 67 years old. He was married in 1980, and has two adult children. He
earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  mechanical  engineering  in  1980.  He  has  worked  for  a
government contractor since 2015, as a senior mechanical engineer. He has previously
held a security clearance. (Tr. 63-64; GE 1)
Applicant  stated  that  his  financial  problems  started  in  the  late-2000’s.  He  was
working long hours after September 11, 2001, and was exhausted after four years of hard
work. He  voluntarily left his job  of  15 years  in  2005.  He went  on  to  work for two  other
employers  between  2005  and  2008.  In  July  2008,  he  voluntarily  left  his  job  before
obtaining  new  employment,  because  he  did  not  think  that  his  employer’s  time-card
practices were ethical. He was not able to find full-time employment again until June 2010.
He  pulled  money  from  his  retirement  accounts  to  pay  some  of  his  expenses,  but  fell
behind on his bills, including his mortgage, and his home went into foreclosure. His wife
was steadily employed during that period. (Tr. 64-77, 107-110; AE G; GE 1)
Applicant has been earning about $150,000 or more a year since 2015. His most
recent salary was about $175,000 yearly when he became unemployed in May 2022. His
wife is earning about $110,000 yearly. His budget while employed shows that Applicant
and his wife had about $24,000 of gross monthly income, and about $6,800 of disposable
income  a  month.  The  budget  also  shows  about  $500,000  in  retirement  accounts.  He
stated that after losing his paycheck in May, he has been using his inheritance from his
parents to pay some of his expenses. (Tr. 64-77, 107-110, 123; AE H)
Applicant testified that money does not mean much to him. He admitted that he
did not take his finances seriously, or keep track of his financial assets and accounts. He
and his wife have been living beyond their means. While he claims that he does not have
the means to resolve his debts, he also stated that he could find lucrative employment
working for a private corporation, but does not want to work for them. He stated that if
does not get his clearance, he will not resolve his debts or delinquent taxes, and will just
live off his social security. (Tr. 17, 40-41, 121, 123-124, 133-134, 142)
Included with Applicant’s exhibits are seven character letters, which describe him
as patriotic, dedicated to his family, intelligent, a talented engineer, and involved with the
military community. (AE H)
The SOR alleges four bankruptcy filings, delinquent tax debts, student loans, and
consumer debts. The status of the allegations is as follows:
SOR ¶ ¶ 1.a-1.d are Chapter 13 Bankruptcy filings from  2013, 2014, and 2015,
and a 2016 Chapter 11 Bankruptcy filing. All of  the  bankruptcy cases were dismissed.
Applicant admitted  that  he filed  these  cases  to  stop  the  foreclosure  of  his home.  He built
the  home  in the  early  90’s for about  $240,000. As  the  value  of  his home  increased, he
and   his  wife   refinanced   their   mortgage   about  13   times,  seven   times  for  the   primary
mortgage  and  six  times for the  secondary  mortgage, and  used  the  equity  to  pay  for private
school educations for his children  and  other expenses.  He  stated  that they  “mortgaged
the  house  to  the  max.”  He owes about $867,000  on  his current mortgage  for the  house.
(Tr. 43-62, 75-79, 87-91, 137-138; GE  2, 3,  9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15; AE  H)
Applicant  could  not  make  mortgage  payments  when  he  became  voluntarily
unemployed in 2008. He requested that his mortgage lender give him forbearance on the
loan  until  he  could  find  new  employment.  He  has  been  in  dispute  with  his  mortgage
provider  since  at  least  2009.  He  claims  that  the  lender  did  not  follow  the  appropriate
guidelines, or offer him the payment plan or loan modification that he believes he was
due. In about 2011, he hired an attorney who filed a lawsuit against the lender that was
dismissed, and she filed the four bankruptcy cases on their behalf. He believes that all of
these  filings  were  appropriate,  because  it  saved  his  house  from  foreclosure,  but  the
bankruptcy records show otherwise. (Tr. 43-62, 75-79, 87-91, 137-138; GE 8, 9, 10, 11,
12, 13; AE H)
It is clear from the record that Applicant and his wife used the bankruptcy automatic
stay  to  delay  their  home  foreclosure  and  gain  an  advantage  in  their  dispute  with  their
mortgage lender. The 2013 case was dismissed for failing to provide information to the
trustee, failing to file tax returns, failure to set up a payment schedule for delinquent taxes,
and  excessive  monthly  personal  expenses.  In  the  2014  case,  the  debtors  moved  to
dismiss on their own. The 2015 case was dismissed for failing to provide information to
the trustee. In 2016, the bankruptcy trustee stated that Applicant filed their case in bad
faith.  In  an  unopposed  motion  to  dismiss,  the  trustee  also  stated  that  they  were
mismanaging  their  estate,  hiding  their  earnings  from  the  court,  making  unauthorized
payments  for  wedding  expenses  for  their  daughter,  and  failing  to  provide  necessary
documentation. (Tr. 43-62, 75-79, 87-91, 137-138; GE 9 (at 122-134), 10, 11, 12, 13; AE
H)
SOR  ¶¶  1.e  and  1.f  are  student  loans  in  collection  for  $90,023  and  $34,185,
respectively. Applicant took out these loans to fund private school college tuition for his
two daughters. The loans have not been paid since 2019. He stated that he would like to
arrange a payment plan for these loans, but did not provide documentation of any effort
to do so. These student loans are unresolved. (Tr. 75-88; GE 2, 3, 15; AE A)
SOR ¶ 1.g is a debt to the Department of Treasury for fees owed from his 2016
bankruptcy  case.  Applicant  denies  the  allegation,  but  it  appears  on  two  of  his  credit
reports. He claims that he contacted the creditor about the debt, but they could not link
his or his spouse’s social security numbers to any such debt. He did not provide sufficient
documentation to support this claim. In his answer, he stated that he will not pay this debt.
The debt is unresolved. (Tr. 89-91; GE 3, 15)
SOR ¶ 1.h is a credit card placed for collection for $24,166. Applicant stated that
he used to make payments on this account, but has  not paid it for years, and that it is
now  charged-off.  He  did  not  provide  sufficient  documentation  of  any  payments.  He
reported that he has not received a 1099-C (cancelation of debt) from the creditor. This
debt is unresolved. (Tr. 91-92; GE 9)
SOR ¶ 1.i is a 2016 judgment for an unpaid credit card debt for $18,900. Applicant
stated that this debt was being garnished from their wages for a time, and that he was
making monthly payments for a time, but he did not provide sufficient documentation of
those payments. They recently negotiated a settlement, and satisfied the judgment in May
2022, about eight months after receiving the SOR. (Tr. 91-95; GE 6; AE B-F)
SOR ¶¶  1.j-1.p  are delinquent  federal taxes owed to the IRS: $58,741  for  tax year
2009; $2,490  for 2010;  $11,981  for  2011;  $13,684  for 2012; $17,263  for  2013;  $4,656  for
2015; and  $148,649  for  a  tax  lien  filed  in 2016,  respectively. Applicant denied  SOR ¶¶  1.j-
1.n   because   he   disagreed   with   the   amounts  owed.  Applicant   claimed   that  for tax   year
2008  he  overpaid his federal taxes by  $21,000  and  his state  taxes by  $7,000. He  stated
that   he   filed   his   2009-2011   taxes  late,  and   that   the   IRS   and   state   would  not   apply   his
overpayment to  his 2009  tax  debt. He  also  stated  that in  2008,  he  took money  out  of his
retirement account  to  pay  his mortgage, and  part  of his  overpayment went towards the
penalty  for this withdrawal. He stated  that since  the  IRS  and  state  refuse  to  apply  his 2008
tax overpayments to his tax debts, he considers that they stole this money from  him. (Tr.
65-68, 95-106, 110-113, 116, 142; GE 4, 5, 9; AE H)
Applicant stated that he and his wife claim zero deductions on their W-4 form, but
the record shows that he owes tax debts for every tax year from 2009 to 2016. He claims
that his taxes were filed for tax years 2016-2018, and that he probably owes delinquent
taxes for those years as well. He hired an attorney that he pays $300 monthly to resolve
his tax issues and file his returns. He stated that he does not know if his 2019-2021 taxes
have been filed yet. He claims that since 2016, his attorney has been trying to get the IRS
to negotiate a settlement plan to resolve his back taxes, but the IRS does not have the
manpower to have the meeting. He claims that they had a meeting scheduled in 2022,
but the IRS did not show up. He asserts that most of the back taxes are penalties and
interest, which he believes were tacked on to scare him into compliance, and he claims it
will all go away once they negotiate a settlement. He admitted that he has not made any
tax payments for at  least  ten  years, and does  not  send payments with  his returns.  He
stated that he does not have any money to send them now, and that if he does  not get
his  clearance,  he  will  not  pay  his  back  taxes.  At  the  hearing,  Applicant  was  asked  to
provide tax account records and other documentation supporting his claims. He did not
provide sufficient documentation to support his testimonial assertions during the hearing,
and did not submit any additional documentary evidence  post hearing. All of  these tax
debts remain unresolved. (Tr. 65-68, 95-106, 110-113, 116, 142; GE 4, 5, 9; AE H)
SOR ¶ 1.q is a 2014 judgement for delinquent state taxes for $19,174. Applicant
claimed that this debt resulted from an underpayment in 2009, as well as penalties and
interest. He claimed that his tax overpayment in 2008 should have covered this debt, but
that the state rejected it. Applicant denies this debt and claims that it was already paid,
but  he  did  not  provide  sufficient  documentation  to  support  his  claim.  This  debt  is
unresolved. (Tr. 103-105; GE 7; AE H)
