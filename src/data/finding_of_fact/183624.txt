In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted all of the allegations, with explanations. His
admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence,
I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 72-year-old employee of a federal contractor with duties as a human
resources (HR) generalist. He began working at his present job in July 2019. He served
in the U.S. Army from 1972 to 1976, and he received an honorable discharge. He holds
a  master’s  degree.  He  is  married  for  the  second  time  and  has  three  adult  children,
including  two  stepchildren.  He  provided  financial  support  for  both  his  stepson  and
stepdaughter to attend college, including paying for their student loans. (Tr. 6, 17-18, 21,
26, 29-30, 42-43; GE 1)
The SOR alleged three delinquent accounts (credit cards) totaling approximately
$33,243.  The  debts  are  established  by  credit  reports  from  November  2019,  February
2021,  and  September  2021;  Applicant’s  personal  subject  interview  (PSI)  with  an
investigator  in  December  2019;  his  responses  to  DOHA  interrogatories  in  December
2020; and his SOR admissions (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.c). (GE 2-6; Answer to SOR)
Applicant’s financial difficulties began in 2016. He and his wife opened a women’s
boutique  in  a  small  western  tourist  town  in  2014.  Applicant  was  also  employed  as  a
consultant with the title of career coach. In 2016, he was grossing about $65,000 per year
from  this work.  Applicant  described  the  profitability of  the  business between  2014  and
2017  as making enough  money to keep  the place open. That  changed  in March 2016
when Applicant, with very short notice, was laid off from his consulting job. He and his
wife scrambled to take several part-time jobs in order to make ends meet. They continued
this until approximately May 2017 when they decided to close the boutique. He was hired
for an HR position in a different location so they sold their condominium and moved in
October 2017. (Tr. 19-20; GE 3; Answer to SOR)
Applicant used credit cards to fund the boutique business. This was necessary in
order to pay for new inventory several times a year. The three SOR debts are credit cards
used  to  finance  their  business.  There  were  at  least  four  other  credit  cards  used  by
Applicant for the same purpose that also became delinquent, but he was able to settle
those debts with the creditors for less than the full amount. These four debts were not
alleged in the SOR and will not be considered by me for disqualification purposes, but I
may consider the evidence as it relates to the application of any mitigating conditions or
during my assessment of the whole-person factors. (Tr. 20; GE 3; Answer to SOR)
The status of the SOR debts is as follows:
SOR  ¶¶   1.a-$13,380;   1.b-$11,708;   1.c-$8,155.   All  three  debts  are  to  the  same
creditor. Applicant claims he was in contact with this creditor (or the resulting collection
companies)  at  various  time  between  2017  and  2019.  No  documentation  supports  this
assertion. He further claims that he offered to settle the debts but the creditor refused his
offer by demanding either full payment or monthly payments of  $300  to  $400 on each
debt. Applicant stated he could not meet those demands because he was helping to pay
for his stepchildren  and  his wife’s college  expenses.  He has not contacted the creditor
since 2019, even though he stated he would  do so in his December 2020 response to
interrogatories, and in his SOR answer in June 2021.  He further stated that he did not
use some of the $110,000 proceeds from the sale of his condominium in October 2017
to pay the SOR debts because he had other priorities, such as paying some of his other
debts and paying his stepchildren’s college and living expenses. These three debts are
still unpaid, and Applicant’s plan is to let them fall off his credit report after seven years
and take advantage of their unenforceability when the state’s statute of limitation for the
collection of debts passes. These debts are unresolved. (Tr. 19, 20-21, 26, 33, 40-43; GE
3; Answer to SOR)
Applicant testified that his gross annual income is approximately $82,000 from his
job  and  $15,000  from  his  social  security  pension.  His  wife’s  current  income  is
approximately $50,000 annually. He recently bought a home and his monthly mortgage
payments  are  $1,473.  He  typically  has  approximately  $500  left  over  at  the  end  of  the
month after paying all his bills. He has approximately $3,000 in his retirement account
and his wife has between $6,000 and $7,000. They have no other savings account. He is
current on all his other debts. There is no evidence of financial counseling. (Tr. 36-39)
