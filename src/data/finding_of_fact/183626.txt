Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated into
the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits
submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 41 years old. He is a high school graduate. He married in 2006 and
separated from his wife in 2018. They share one child. He has cohabited with his girlfriend
since August 2019. He has worked for his present employer, a federal contractor, since
2002. (Item 3)
Applicant disclosed in his January 2020 security clearance application (SCA) that
he failed to file his 2018 federal and state income tax returns (SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e). He
said he was in the middle of his separation  from  his wife, and he was having difficulty
making his mortgage payment and forgot to file his tax returns. He said he was going to
file his 2018 tax returns after he completed his 2019 tax returns. (Item 3)
In May 2020, a government investigator interviewed  Applicant. He explained he
began having financial problems in 2010 when his wife’s work hours were reduced, and
she was only working on a part-time basis. They were unable to pay all their bills on his
salary  and  her  reduced  salary.  They  had  difficulty  making  their  mortgage  payments.
Despite efforts to save their house, it went into foreclosure in late 2018 or early 2019.
Applicant said the total amount that was delinquent when it foreclosed was $65,000. He
told the investigator he did not know if he owed any money. Applicant’s December 2019
credit  report  shows  the  mortgage  in  a  foreclosure  status  with  a  past-due  amount  of
$89,675. His March 2020 credit report shows the account in collection and in foreclosure
with a balance of $283,815 and his October 2021 credit report shows the mortgage is in
the foreclosure process and his past-due amount is $89,675. The debt is alleged in SOR
¶  1.g  ($89,675).  Applicant  did  not  provide  any  information  regarding  the  status  or
resolution of this debt. (Items 4, 5, 6, 7)
Applicant told the investigator that he spoke with the IRS about filing his delinquent
2018 tax returns and he was told that he had to first file his 2019 tax returns. He said he
would file his 2019 returns and then file his 2018 tax returns. He intended to do the same
for his state tax returns for those tax years. Due to the COVID pandemic the tax return
due date for tax year 2019 was extended to July 2020. (Item 4)
Applicant completed government interrogatories in August 2021. He reported that
he had filed his 2019 and 2020 federal and state income tax returns. For tax year 2019,
he owed federal income taxes of approximately $5,351, and $13,307 for tax year 2020
(SOR ¶ 1.a). He reported he owed his state $116 for tax year 2019 and $1,542 for tax
year 2020 (SOR ¶ 1.c). He reported he had not filed his 2018 federal and state income
tax returns because he was in the middle of a move. (Item 4) Applicant’s response to the
FORM stated:
I have  filed  my  taxes and  made  a  payment plan  and  as for my  other debt
I’m  with  [XYZ] to  get me  back on  track. This company  has been  good  to  me
yes a  few  years has put me  in a  bad  spot  right now  but I’m  working  that and
I’m doing everything to correct that.  (AE A)
SOR ¶ 1.b alleged Applicant was indebted to the federal government for delinquent
taxes for tax year 2016 that remained unpaid until 2020. Applicant admitted the allegation
and provided documentary evidence that he made a payment of $654 to the IRS for tax
year 2016 in May 2020. (Items 2, 4)
Applicant did not provide any corroborating evidence that he filed his 2018 federal
or state income tax returns or that he has a payment plan with the IRS or his state  tax
authority and paid his delinquent tax debt.
The SOR alleged two small debts in ¶¶ 1.f ($429) and 1.h ($171). Applicant did not
provide supporting documents that these debts are resolved.
