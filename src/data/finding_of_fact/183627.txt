The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  failed  to  file  Federal  income  tax  returns  for  TY
2008  through  2019;  that  he  is  indebted  to  the  IRS  for  delinquent  taxes  for  TY  2008
($15,611) and TY 2009 ($14,944); and that he had one account in collection for $1,352,
and a second account charged off for $174.
In  his  answer to  the  SOR, Applicant  admitted  all  the  SOR  factual allegations  (¶¶
1.a  through  1.e). He  noted  he  retained  the  services of a  tax  relief  company  that  is helping
him  resolve  the  tax  issues.  He also  submitted  documentary  evidence  showing  he  paid  the
two  accounts alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.d  and  1.e.  SOR ¶  1.d  was a  delinquent  medical  debt
for Applicant’s emergency   services at a   hospital on   or about 2017. He  paid this debt in
August 23,  2021.  (Tr.  36;  AE  5)  SOR  ¶  1.e  was a  delinquent  2014  energy  bill. He paid
this charged-off  account in August 11, 2021.  (AE  5)  He paid both  accounts after he  was
confronted   about   his  delinquent   debts   during   his  October  2020   Office   of  Personnel
Management investigative  interview, and after he received the  SOR in July 2021.
Applicant’s SOR admissions, and those at his hearing, are incorporated herein as
findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  review  of  the  record  evidence,  I  make  the  following
additional findings of fact:
Applicant  is  63  years  old.  He  graduated  from  high  school  in  1977,  received  a
certificate of completion for a technical school in 1981, and a certificate of completion for
a graphic design school in 2016. He married in 1986 and divorced in 2008. He has two
adult children, ages 31 and 28. He has been living with a cohabitant since around 2020.
(Tr. 25)
Applicant  was  employed  as  a  computer  automated  design  drafter  (CADD)  from
1987 to 2012. Between 2012 and 2014, he held small jobs as a steward, bartender, shift
lead, and  housekeeping  supervisor. He worked  as a  customer service associate  between
2014   and   2018.   He  started   working   as  an   armed   security   guard  in   October   2018.   His
current employer and  security  sponsor,  a  federal contractor, hired  him  as a  security  officer
in  July   2020.  Since   2012,   he   has  had   only   one   two-week  period   of   unemployment   in-
between  jobs, but some  positions were part-time  jobs and  his earnings were low. (Tr. 26-
28)
Applicant  is  making  about  $2,000  a  month,  sometimes  more  depending  on
overtime.  At  the  end  of  the  month,  he  has  $50  to  $100  of  disposable  income  in  his
checking  account.  He  has  less  than  $50  in  his  savings  account.  (Tr.  39)  He  rents  an
apartment and shares the $2,200 rent with his roommate. He carries five credit cards and
his total outstanding debt is about $3,700.
In Section 26 (Financial Record) of his 2020 SCA, Applicant disclosed that he had
financial problems that included owing income taxes to the IRS for TY 2013, because he
did not have the money to pay it. He also disclosed he failed to file income tax returns for
TYs 2013 through 2019 because he owed too much and was afraid of the penalties and
interest accrued. (GE 1; Tr. 31)
Applicant admitted, and the documentary evidence shows that he failed to timely
file  his  federal  income  tax  returns  for  TYs  2008  through  2019.  He  is  indebted  to  the
Federal  government  for  delinquent  taxes  for  approximately  $15,611  for  TY  2008  and
$14,944  for TY 2009.  He  stated  that  he  completed  his TY  2008  income  tax  form,  and
when he saw how much he owed, he did not file it because he did not have the money to
pay the tax owed. He did not file income tax returns for TYs 2009 through 2019 because
he did not have the money to pay the penalties and interest he accrued. He claimed he
filed his income tax returns for TYs before 2008. He prepared and filed his TYs 2020 and
2021  income  tax  returns.  He  was  expecting  a  $174  refund  for  TY  2020,  but  the  IRS
applied the refund to his 2008 delinquent taxes. There was no refund for TY 2021. (Tr.
33-34)
Applicant  believes  his failure  to  file  his  tax  returns  stemmed from his  divorce  in
2008. When his ex-wife bought out the marital home, he received $90,000 for his share
of the property. He failed to set aside sufficient money to pay taxes for the transaction.
He  loaned  some  of  the  money  to  a  friend  who  never  paid  him  back,  and  he  cannot
remember how he spent the rest. He explained that after his divorce, he was not in a good
state  of  mind  and  did  things  that  were  not  smart  and  made  bad  choices.  Prior  to  his
divorce, he believes his record would indicate that he was reliable.
Applicant  noted  that  he  works  hard,  but  does  not  earn  that  much  money.  He
believes he is not a spendthrift; he does his job and then goes home because he does
not  have  money  to  waste.  He  believes  he  has  made  efforts  and  achieved  progress
resolving his tax problems with the IRS, and paying his debts. (Tr. 31)
Applicant did not pay the delinquent taxes he owed for TYs 2008 ($15,611) and
2009 ($14,944). Except for the $174 refund for TY 2020 that the IRS applied to his 2008
tax debt, he never made any payments to the IRS, or attempted to establish a payment
agreement to pay his back taxes. He believes the IRS cannot collect the delinquent tax
debt for 2008 and 2009, because the Collection Statute Expiration Date (CSED) passed.
Internal Revenue Code section 6502 provides that the length of the period for collection
after assessment of a tax liability is 10 years. The collection statute expiration ends the
government's right to pursue collection of a liability. Applicant did not provide the dates
the IRS assessed his tax liability. He believes that he does not owe any back taxes to the
IRS. However, his evidence fails to establish that he filed income tax returns for TYs 2008
through 2014, or that the IRS has accepted the income tax returns he filed for TYs 2015
to 2019 in August 2021.
Between  2008  and  August  2021, Applicant made  no effort to file  his delinquent
income tax returns for TYs 2008 through 2019. In August 2021, he retained the services
of a tax relief company seeking help to file past-due tax returns and resolve his tax debt.
He claimed he prepared and filed his TYs 2012 to 2014 income tax returns. He presented
no documentary evidence to show that he filed income tax returns for TYs 2008 through
2014. His documentary evidence shows that the tax relief company he retained filed his
TYs 2015 to 2019 income tax returns on August 2021. (AE 7)
According to IRS regulations, in 2012, a person making over $9,750 gross income
had  to  file  an  income  tax  return,  and  in  2021,  the  filing  threshold  was  $12,550  gross
income. Applicant did not present documentary evidence to show he was below the IRS
filing threshold for the years in question.
Applicant  believes  that  if  he  is  granted  clearance  eligibility,  he  will  be  able  to
resolve all of his financial problems. He noted he was been upfront and truthful during the
clearance process. He stated that in 2015, his credit rating was about 580, and he has
raised it to about 710 recently. He believes that shows his financial situation is improving.
He  has  been  paying  his  bills  on  time  and  maintaining  good  credit,  and  he  intends  to
continue to do so in the future. He believes that he is in a good place now, with a steady
job, and steady living conditions; his life is good right now. (Tr. 54) He noted that he timely
filed  income  tax  returns  for TYs  2020  and  2021.  His  intent  is  to  continue  filing  his  tax
returns on time and to pay his taxes.
Applicant  promised  to  be  financially  responsible  in  the  future.  He  presented  no
evidence  to  show  that  he  is  following  a  budget  or  that  he  has  participated  in  financial
counseling. However, I will consider he has received financial counseling through his tax
relief company.
