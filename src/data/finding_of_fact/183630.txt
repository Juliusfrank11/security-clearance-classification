In  2012, Applicant  obtained  an  undergraduate  degree  in  criminal justice.  He  served  in the
U.S.  Marine   Corps   on   active   duty   from   July   1994   until   September   2000,   receiving   an

The Statement of Reasons (SOR) sets forth security concerns under Guideline F.
The SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.h lists eight delinquent debts totaling approximately $32,000.
(Items 4, 5, 6)  The delinquent debts include  student loan accounts, military consumer
accounts, and medical accounts. In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied SOR 1.a,
through SOR 1.d because he claimed they were paid. He admitted SOR 1.e through 1.h.
because they were not paid, but he would contact the creditor.  He did not provide any
other explanations.
In  his  2021  DOHA interrogatories, Applicant  stated  that all  the  SOR  accounts were
unpaid,   but   for  some   accounts   he   had   made   payment   arrangements  and   was  making
payments. (Item  4)   The  delinquent accounts appear in his 2020, 2021, and  2022  credit
bureau  reports. (Items  5, 6, and  7)  He provided  no  documentation  to  support his claim.
He submitted  a  letter, dated  January  26, 2021,  with  a  rehabilitation  offer for $37,220.21,
but there is no  evidence in the record that he  actually started the program. (Item 4)
Applicant  submitted  a  budget  revealing  a  monthly  net  income  of  $6,342,  with
monthly  expenses  of  $2,295.  These  amounts  are  for  alimony/child  care  and
miscellaneous.  (Item  4)  No  debt  payments  are  listed  on  the  budget.  There  is  no
information  in the  record concerning  Applicant’s  financial counseling. He did not report
any circumstances beyond his control.
As to  SOR  1.a  through  SOR 1. d, Applicant  answered  the  SOR  by  stating  that  he
has paid $23,000  of  his student loans, with  a balance  of  $7,912.97.  There was no  record
of his payments.
As to SOR 1.e, Applicant stated the student loan in the amount of $4,369 would
be paid as soon as possible. There is no documentation to support this claim.
As to SOR 1.f, a charged-off-account in the amount of $556, Applicant stated that
he needed to contact the creditor.
As to SOR 1.g, and SOR 1.h two medical accounts totaling $580, Applicant stated
that he needed to contact the creditor.
Applicant  submitted   a   screen   shot,   undated   for   two   Stafford  loans,  one   with   a
balance  of  $2,000  and  the  other  with  a  balance  of $7,912.27  This could be  the  amount
that   he   currently   owes for the   student  loans,   as he   answered   to   the   SOR,   but  it   is not
possible   to   conclude   without  more   information.  He  did  not  provide   any   evidence   of
payments.  Any doubts  must be resolved in  favor of the Government.
