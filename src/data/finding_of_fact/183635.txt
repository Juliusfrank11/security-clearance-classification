Applicant attributed his alcohol issues at least partially to PTSD and dealing with
the  effects  from  his  two  combat  deployments.  By  2013,  he  was  drinking  almost  every
day. He was arrested in  January 2016  and charged with driving  while impaired  (DWI).
He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to three days in jail, a fine, and court costs. (Tr. at
17-21; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  September  2019  and  charged  with  DWI  with  a  blood
alcohol concentration (BAC) of more than .15%. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced
in  March  2021  to  fines,  costs,  and  probation.  (Tr.  at  10-11,  21-28,  36;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 1, 2)
Shortly  after  his  arrest  in  September  2019,  Applicant  entered  a  veterans
treatment  program  for  PTSD  and  alcohol  use  disorder.  He  reduced  his  alcohol
consumption  throughout  his  treatment  until  he  stopped  drinking  in  March  2021.  He
received  treatment  from  the  program  through  about  May  or  June  2022.  His  therapist
(M.A.,  LPC  (licensed  professional  counselor),  LCDC  (licensed  chemical  dependency
counselor))  wrote  in  October  2021  that  Applicant  was  “extremely  engaged  and
consistent  with  his  treatment.”  He  made  significant  progress  and  displayed  an
awareness  of  the  negative  impact  his  previous  alcohol  use  had  on  his  wellbeing.  The
therapist concluded:
[Applicant]   has  developed   healthier   coping   strategies  for  managing   his
PTSD  symptoms  as   well  as  coping   strategies  for  managing   his  urges  to
use   alcohol.   He  has  displayed   an   increased   ability   to   express  difficult
emotions  related   to   his  past   trauma   and   effectively   manages  these
emotions without the use of  alcohol. (Applicant’s response  to SOR)
Applicant  went  through  a  court-monitored  veterans  program  (separate  from  the
program discussed above) as part of his probation. He is required as a condition of his
probation to abstain from alcohol. He completed therapy and group sessions under the
program. The court certified that he graduated from the program in March 2022, and he
completed  the  aftercare  program  in  October  2022.  His  probation  runs  to  about  March
2023. (Tr. at 10-11, 27, 29-32, 35-36, 47-48; Applicant’s response to SOR; AE A)
Applicant   initially   testified   that  he   had   been   abstinent  from   alcohol   since   March
2021.  He   later  admitted   that   he   violated   his  probation   in  June   2022   by   drinking.1   He
stated  he  had  significant stressors, including  the  death  of  his brother-in-law,  and he had
about four beers.  He was required  to  write  a   “think piece”   to  the  court explaining  what
happened,   and   the   court  increased   his  monitoring,   He  has  been   abstinent  since   June
2022  and  plans to  remain sober.  He relies on  the  skills he  learned  through  therapy  and
a strong support system through his friends and  family. (Tr. at 10, 12, 17, 32-37, 48)
The SOR alleges five delinquent debts totaling about $15,475, including $3,841
in  child  support  arrearages.  The  debts  are  established  through  credit  reports  and
Applicant’s admissions.
Applicant has been paying $1,060 a month since October 2017 toward his child
support.  Part  of  each  payment  goes  to  the  arrearages.  (Tr.  at  12,  37-40;  Applicant’s
response to SOR)
Applicant settled the $6,020 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 3.b with a $5,500 payment in
December  2021.  He  paid  the  $2,565  (SOR  ¶  3.c)  and  $1,842  (SOR  ¶  3.d)  debts.  He
contacted the Defense Finance and Accounting Service about the $1,210 debt  (SOR ¶
3.e), but the  agency was  unable to locate  the  debt. His  current finances are  stable as
verified  by  a  recent  credit  report  with  no  adverse  entries.  (Tr.  at  12-13,  16,  40-46;
