Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 1.e. He denied the SOR
allegations  in  ¶¶  1.c  and  1.d.  His  admissions  are  adopted  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a
thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  46  years old.  He served  in  the military from  1994 to 1998  and  was
honorably  discharged.  He  reenlisted  in  2000  and  was  honorably  discharged  in  the
paygrade E-5 in January 2010. He experienced periods of unemployment from January
2010 to June 2011 and December 2011 to July 2013. He was attending school during this
period. Applicant earned an associate’s degree in 2015. He was also unemployed from
January 2014 to February 2014 and from August 2017 to June 2018. He began working
for his present employer, a federal contractor, in November 2018 until the present.  His
initial  annual  income  was  approximately  $50,000  that  has  incrementally  increased  to
approximately $70,000. (Transcript (Tr.) 17, 21-23, 25-26, 44-46; GE 1)
Applicant married in 2001 and divorced in 2006. He has a 20-year-old child from
the marriage. He has four other children from relationships, whose ages are 22, 18, 17
and 13. He does not have court orders for child support, but provides monthly payments
of  $300  for  the  17-year-old  and  13-year-old  children.  He  also  helps  pay  some  college
expenses for the 18-year-old. The other two children are adults and he does not provide
financial support. (Tr. 18-22; GE 1)
The  debts  alleged  in  the  SOR  are  corroborated  by  Applicant’s  admissions,
testimony, and credit reports from April 2020, June 2021, and September 2022. (GE 1, 2,
3, 4)
Applicant attributed his financial issues to his unemployment. Since he began his
current job, he has had more financial stability. He testified that there were debts on his
credit report that he was unaware of and did not believe belonged to him. In 2018,  he
contacted a debt relief company to address the negative information on his credit report
and dispute it. The only debts he was aware he owed were his student loans. He did not
make payments on them from 2015, when he completed his degree, until 2019. Applicant
admitted  that  he  made  a  mistake  when  he  failed  to  begin  timely  repaying  his  student
loans.  He  testified  that  in  2019,  he  contacted  the  creditor  for  his  student  loans  and
provided a copy of his W-2 wage statement. At that time, he had not yet been working at
his  present  job  for  a  full  year,  so  the  previous  year’s  W-2  showed  he  earned  about
$18,000. He arranged  to  pay  $20  a  month  for  six  months to  move  the  student loans out
of  their  default status. He provided  a  document that  shows that from  August 2019  until
May   2020   he   made   10   monthly   payments.  These   consistent   payments   brought  his
student loans out of  default status. He then  contacted  the  creditor and  was mailed  a  form
to  provide  information  to  make  a  payment arrangement based  on  his current income  at
the  time.  He anticipated  his  monthly  payments would be  about  $300.  However, before  the
payment   plan   started,   the   loans  were  place   in  a   deferred   status   due   to   the   COVID-19
pandemic and  moratorium  on  student  loan  payments.  Applicant  testified  that  when  the
moratorium  is lifted  he  would  begin making  monthly  payments  likely  in January  2023. He
has also requested  an  application  for the  loan  forgiveness program. (Tr. 24-37, 41, 48-
54; AE B, C, D)
The  SOR  alleges  two  medical  debts  (¶  1.c  - $591  and  ¶  1.d  - $216).  Applicant
credibly testified that he has medical insurance and is also covered by the Department of
Veteran’s  Affairs  (VA)  for  his  medical  services.  He  receives  about  $2,100  monthly  in
disability  payments  that  began  in  2018.  He  disputes  that  he  is  responsible  for  these
medical debts. He said one is a hospital bill and he never went to the hospital. His children
have medical insurance under their mothers’ insurance plans. Both debts are reported as
collection accounts on his June 2021 credit report. The last activity date on the debt in
SOR ¶ 1.c is November 2015 and for ¶ 1.d the last activity date is September 2016. The
debt in SOR ¶ 1.c is not reported on Applicant’s most current credit report from September
2022. Applicant testified that he spoke with the debt relief company that was disputing the
debts on his credit report about someone using his identity for medical services. He stated
that  he  uses  the  VA  for  all  of  his  medical  needs  and  did  not  incur  medical  expenses
outside of the VA. (Tr. 39-41, 55-58)
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.e ($191) is a bill owed to a college that Applicant attended
when he went back to school in 2019. He believed his college expenses were all covered
by his GI Bill. He was unware he owed the bill and when he learned of it, he paid it. He
provided documentary proof that he resolved the debt. (Tr. 37-39; AE B)
Applicant’s current finances are stable. He has about $2,000 in savings and money
in  his  pension  plan.  Each  month  after  paying  his  expenses,  he  has  about  $2,800
remaining. He is confident that when  the student loan payment plan begins, he will be
able  to  make  the  required  monthly payments.  He  has  no  other debts.  He  admitted  he
made a mistake by not addressing his student loans when they became due, but he is
back on track. (Tr. 43, 47, 59-60)
