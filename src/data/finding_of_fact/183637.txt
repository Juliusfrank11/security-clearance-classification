In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, she admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b,
1.d-1.x.  She  denied  the  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  1.c.  Her  admissions  incorporated  in  my
findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  43-year-old  electrical  shop  supervisor  employed  by  a  defense
contractor. She graduated from high school in May 1998. She served on active duty in
the U.S. Navy from July 1998 to February 2003 and received an honorable discharge.
She  worked  for  federal  contractors  from  July  2008  until  she  was  hired  by  her  current
employer  in  December  2018.  She  received  a  security  clearance  from  another  federal
agency in July 2011.
Applicant  married  in December 2016. She  has a  22-year-old daughter and  a  20-
year-old  son   from   a   previous  relationship.  She   did   not  receive   child   support from   their
father because he was and continues to be incarcerated. (Tr-1 at 22.) She and her current
husband have two-year-old twins. The twins were in intensive care for about three weeks
after their birth. (Tr-1 at 25.)
Applicant’s husband is a deputy sheriff. He  previously was an independent truck
owner and driver. He currently earns about $54,000 annually. As an independent owner
and  operator,  his  earnings  varied.  In  2019  and  2020,  his  gross  income  was  about
$150,000. (Tr. 29.) He stopped driving in order to spend more time with his family. He is
attempting to sell his truck in order to pay off some of their debts. (Tr. 18.)
About  four  years  ago,  Applicant’s  father-in-law  was  seriously  injured  in  a  car
accident when he had a stroke while he was driving. Applicant’s husband stopped working
for about three months to take care of his father. Applicant testified that this reduction in
family income caused her to fall behind on her student-loan payments. (Tr-1 at 31-33.)
The SOR alleges 24 delinquent debts reflected in credit reports from  September
2020, April 2021, December 2021, and September 2022 (GX 2; GX 3; GX 4; GX 7.) The
evidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below.
SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.v, and 1.w: delinquent student loans placed for collection of
$48,716; $12,179; and $7,878. These loans were opened in December 2006 and were
delinquent as of December 2018. On October 13, 2021, after Applicant received the SOR,
she applied for a direct consolidation loan and an income-driven payment plan. As of the
date  of  the  hearing,  her  student  loans  had  been  consolidated  and  were  reflected  as
current. She has not begun making payments because of the COVID deferment. (GX 7
at 8; Tr-1 at 35-37.)
SOR ¶ 1.b: credit-card account placed for collection of $6,852. A judgment for
this debt was entered against Applicant in February 2021. (GX 5 at 3.) On October 14,
2021, Applicant and the creditor agreed that she would make an initial payment of $702
and monthly $150 payments until the debt is paid in full. (SOR Answer; AX E; AX F.) She
has made the required payments for every month through January 2022. (AX L through
Y; AX EE.)
SOR  ¶  1.c:  credit-card  account  placed  for  collection  of  $1,401.  Applicant
denied this debt and asserted that it was due to identity theft. She testified that after her
dispute of the debt was unsuccessful, she used funds from a federal income tax refund
to pay the debt in full. (AX AA; Tr-1 at 42.) However, she did not produce any documents
showing that the debt was paid. (AX Y.) An applicant who claims that a debt has been
resolved is expected to present documentary evidence supporting the claim. See ISCR
Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2016).
SOR  ¶¶  1.d,  1.f,  1.j,  and  1.u:  credit-card  accounts  placed  for  collection  of
$835, $21, $183, and $834. Applicant testified that she paid these debts in October 2021.
(Tr-1  at  44.)  She  did  not  provide  any  documentation  of  payment.  (Tr-1  at  44-45.)  The
debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.u appear to be the same account. (GX 3 at 3 and 7.)
SOR  ¶  1.g:  telecommunications  account  placed  for  collection  of  $368.
Applicant disputed this debt, but the dispute was not resolved in her favor. (AX AA; Tr-1
at 50.) She did not provide any documentation of the basis for her dispute. This debt is
not resolved.
SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.k-1.t: medical debts placed for collection of a total
of  $2,423:  On  October  13,  2021,  Applicant  paid  $1,144  to  a  collection  agency  for
numerous unspecified medical debts. (AX G.) On the same date, she paid $960 to another
collection agency for three medical debts. (AX H.) She paid the specific debts alleged in
SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.k, 1.o, 1.p, and 1.t on October 14, 2021. (GX 2 at 3; Tr-1 at 45-46.) She
paid the specific debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.s on October 19, 2021. (AX A.) She has made
regular $165 payments to a medical collection agency handling the other medical debts
for every month from October 13, 2021, through September 15, 2022. (AX L through AX
W; AX EE.)
SOR ¶ 1.x: medical debt reduced to judgment for $1,547. A default judgment
for $1,547 was entered against Applicant in May 2021 for this debt, which was for medical
care for Applicant’s twins. It is not resolved.
Applicant testified that she incurred numerous medical bills due to her high blood
pressure and an irregular heartbeat, but cardiologists successfully treated her, and her
symptoms  are  now  controlled  by  medication.  For  a  while,  she  had  a  health  savings
account  with  a  high  deductible.  After  her  twins  were  born  and  spent  three  weeks  in
intensive care, she incurred additional medical expenses. Her medical insurance carrier
for the expenses related to her childbirth has not yet reimbursed her. (Tr-1 at 47-48.) She
has about $2,000 in a health savings plan with a former employer, but she admitted that
she had not contacted the former employer about transferring the funds. (Tr-1 at 54-55.)
Applicant  owes  about  $19,584  for  hospital  care  that  her  insurance  carrier  has
declined to cover. (AX X; Tr. 56-60.) Because this debt is not alleged in the SOR, it may
not  be  an  independent  basis  for  revoking  her  security  clearance.  However,  it  may  be
considered to assess her credibility; to decide whether a particular adjudicative guideline
is applicable; to evaluate evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances;
to consider whether she has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; or as part of a whole-
person  analysis.  ISCR  Case  No.  03-20327  at  4  (App.  Bd.  Oct.  26,  2006)  (citations
omitted). I have considered this debt for these limited purposes.
Applicant admitted at the hearing that she did not take her medical bills seriously,
believing that she could pay them when she could afford it. After she submitted her SCA
and  was  interviewed  by  a  security  investigator,  she  began  focusing  on  resolving  her
debts. (Tr-1 at 18.) She sought financial advice from her credit union about a year ago
and she now has a written budget. (Tr-1 at 67.) In December 2021, she and her husband
refinanced their home to lower the interest rate on their mortgage loan. (Tr-1 at 24; AX
C.)
Applicant  is  highly  regarded  by  her  coworkers  for  her  hard  work,  integrity,  and
dedication, as well as for being a devoted mother and spouse. (AX Z; AX BB; AX DD; and
AX FF.) A former supervisor describes her as mission-focused with a reputation for hard
work, fairness, and integrity. (AX CC.)
