March 2020. He purchased marijuana from friends. He used  marijuana  at times as  often

From  about  2008

prescription narcotic painkillers without a prescription. He purchased them from friends
“a  few  times  every  few  years.”  He  used  them  in  2008  to  2009  to  help  cope  with
depression.  His  later  use  was  strictly  for  pain  relief,  not  for  recreational  purposes.  He
has  not  used  any unprescribed  painkillers  since  March 2018.  (Tr. at  18-22, 27, 57-61;

Applicant  has  not  used  any  illegal  substances  since  March  2020.  He  matured,
and he started a new job and realized that illegal drug use was not conducive to the job
or  a  healthy  lifestyle.  He  passed  multiple  drug  tests.  He  stated  that  he  is  healthier,
happier, and financially stable. His fiancée also gave up marijuana at the same time as
Applicant.  They  no  longer  associate  with  people  who  use  illegal  drugs.  He  signed  a
statement  of  intent  to  abstain  from  all  drug  involvement  and  substance  misuse,
acknowledging  that  any  future  involvement  or  misuse  is  grounds  for  revocation  of  his
national security eligibility. He testified that he does not intend to use marijuana or any
other illegal drug in the future. (Tr. at  16-18, 28, 35-36, 66-68; Applicant’s response  to

ethic,  professionalism,  trustworthiness,  technical  expertise,  loyalty,  and  integrity.  His
references recommend him for a security clearance. (AE F-H, N)
