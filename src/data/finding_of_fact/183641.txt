In  Applicant’s SOR response, he  admitted  the  SOR allegations in ¶¶  1.a  through
1.o. He denied  the  added  SOR allegation  (¶ 1.p). His admissions are accepted  as findings
of  fact. Additional findings follow.
Applicant is 58 years old, and he has been employed by a government contractor
as a network engineer since August 2021. His  monthly net salary is about $9,700. For
approximately the  past  eight  years,  he  has worked  as  a federal contractor with  a  two-
month break in employment in 2017. In 2006, he received a bachelor’s degree from an
on-line  university.  He  married  in 1999,  and he  does  not  have  any children.  His  wife  is
medically disabled and unemployed. He currently possesses a DOD security clearance.
(GE 1, GE 2; AE F; Tr. 24-25, 30-34, 36-37, 49, 64-66, 93, 107)
Financial Considerations
Applicant stated during his October 2020 background interview that he is able to
live within his means and pay his debts. He admitted that he had multiple medical debts
that were currently unpaid. The majority of  the medical bills resulted from his  wife and
grandchild’s medical issues. The authorized DOD investigator showed Applicant his credit
report revealing two delinquent student loans, two vet bills, a consumer cash loan, and
several outstanding medical accounts. Applicant was surprised at the total number and
combined amount of his delinquent accounts, some of which became delinquent in 2015.
He stated that it was his intention to obtain a credit report and contact the creditors to
determine if the balances owed were legitimate. If a balance was legitimate, he intended
to satisfy the account; if the balance was not  substantiated, he intended to dispute the
delinquent account. (GE 2)
At the hearing, Applicant’s wife testified that she has been hospitalized three times
within the past two years. She suffered from cancer, aphasia, cellulitis, and she had a
portion of her lung removed. Numerous medical bills accrued that they are unable to pay.
She  is  not  qualified  for  disability  income  because  the  government  determined  that
Applicant earns too much money. Applicant also has medical out-of-pocket expenses not
covered by insurance that are related to his diabetes and sleep apnea. (Tr. 25-29, 52-55,
60; AE C)
Applicant stated that he earns about $128,000 annually. His wife’s cousin and her
three children reside with Applicant and his wife. In July 2011, Applicant and his wife were
granted legal custody of the older two children, and the mother was ordered to pay child
support to Applicant and his wife. Applicant stated that the youngest child was also legally
placed  into  their  care.  The  children’s  mother  works  as  a  school  employee,  and  earns
between  $1,500  - $2,000  monthly  during  the  school  year.  She  also  receives  monthly
disability payments of about $2,000 from the Veteran’s Administration due to her previous
service in the U.S. Army. Applicant accepts financial responsibility for the three children
in his custody, and he charges his wife’s cousin $900 a month for living in their house.
There is insufficient evidence  in the  record to  show whether the  children’s mother also
pays child support to Applicant. (Tr. 64, 67-69; AE D)
Applicant testified that while he was unemployed for approximately two months in
1987, he received a phone call from his student loan creditor. He explained that he was
currently unemployed and the student loan provider gave him a six-month forbearance
before he was required to start student loan payments. He was initially on an income-
based payment plan, but when the plan lapsed, the loan payments increased to almost
$2,000 a month. He could not afford to make these payments. In about September 2017,
he  decided  he  would  allow  his  student  loans  to  go  into  default,  and  then  he  would
rehabilitate them. When he later attempted to communicate with the student loan provider
to rehabilitate his defaulted student loans, he was unable to make contact. He tried on
multiple occasions to make contact with the student loan provider without success. Over
the  years,  he  admitted  receiving  letters  from  the  student  loan  creditor,  but  he  denied
receiving correspondence within the past two years. Applicant last made a payment on
his delinquent student loans  in  about  August  2017. The total amount of  his delinquent
student loans alleged in the SOR is $82,787. (Tr. 50-52, 86-92)
Applicant testified that his short-term plan for resolving his student loans is to begin
making  interest-only  payments  so  that  his  student  loan  balance  does  not  continue  to
increase. His long-term  plan  is to  use  his  inheritance  from  his father’s estate  when his
father passes away. In addition, Applicant has an elderly friend who has promised that he
would  inherit  half  of  his  estate.  Applicant  estimated  that  the  inheritance money should
fully cover the outstanding student loan balance. (Tr. 60-61)
In   approximately   2005,   Applicant  participated   in  the   Dave   Ramsey   financial
program. At  that time, he  and  his spouse  had  recently  filed  for bankruptcy. After their  case
was  discharged,  they   successfully   handled   their   financial  obligations  for  several  years
until  Applicant’s  wife   became   ill  and   the   medical  bills  accumulated.   They   focused   on
paying   off   the   smallest  bills.  He  estimated   that   they   resolved   about   $5,000   of  their
delinquent  debt.   Applicant  testified   that  he   had   joined   a   consumer  credit  counseling
(CCC) program on the  same day as his hearing. He will begin making payments through
this CCC service next month.  Other than  his outstanding  student  loans, he  now  believes
he  only  has five  accounts in collection. There  was no  documentation  to  show  what specific
accounts were included  in the  CCC repayment plan. Post-hearing  documentation  showed
that  Applicant  made  his first monthly  payment  of $203  in September 2022. (Tr. 57-58, 61-
62, 79-81, 99-101; AE  G)
SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.f allege that Applicant owes a total of $305 for delinquent
medical accounts placed for collection. The May 2022 credit report in the record shows
that these accounts have been paid. (GE 5; Tr. 98-99)
SOR  ¶¶  1.g,  1.h,  1.n,  and  1.o  allege  that  Applicant  owes  a  total  of  $1,795  for
delinquent  medical  accounts  placed  for  collection.  There  is  no  evidence  that  these
accounts have been successfully disputed, paid, or that they are being paid through the
CCC program. These accounts are unresolved. (GE 3, GE 5; Tr. 99)
SOR ¶¶ 1.i alleges that Applicant owes a total of $3,933 for a consumer payday
loan that has been referred for collection. There is no evidence that the account has been
successfully disputed, paid, or that it is being paid through the CCC program. This account
is unresolved. (GE 5; Tr. 84-85)
SOR ¶¶ 1.j, and 1.k allege that Applicant owes the U.S. Department of Education
$82,787 for two delinquent student loans referred for collection. Applicant admitted that
he has not paid on his student loans since mid-2017, well before the COVID pause relief
was enacted by the government. There is no evidence that his student loans have been
successfully rehabilitated, or that Applicant has made any interest-only payments. There
is insufficient evidence to  determine that these student loans have been resolved through
an  inheritance,  or  are  being  paid  through  the  CCC  program.  These  student  loans  are
unresolved. (GE 5; Tr. 86-92)
SOR ¶¶ 1.l, and 1.m allege that Applicant owes a total of $856 to a pet hospital
since 2017. There is no evidence that these accounts have been successfully disputed,
paid, or if they are being paid through the CCC program. These accounts are unresolved.
(GE 3; Tr. 85-86, 92)
Applicant provided  a financial  summary  at the  hearing. It  showed  that his  monthly
net income  was $9,500  and  he  received $900 from  his wife’s cousin  each month.  With a
monthly net income of $10,400, he was paying the  following monthly expenses:

Department  Counsel  questioned  Applicant  about  his  financial  report  since  the
monthly expenses totaled $11,880, which is about $1,500 over his net monthly income.
Applicant stated that he may have been “a little on the pessimistic side” when he listed
his  monthly expenses.  According  to  the  chart  above,  groceries  for a  family  of  six cost
$545  each  week;  pets  (four  cats  and  1  dog)  costs  averaged  about  $112  each  week;
toiletries, school supplies, clothing, and personal care items cost about $380 each week.
Applicant resubmitted an amended monthly budget post-hearing. His monthly net income
is now $9,700 and he continues to receive $900 from his wife’s cousin. After paying his
monthly  expenses,  to  include  the  $203  CCC  monthly  payment,  he  has  approximately
$1,086 net remainder at the end of the month. (AE A; AE F; Tr. 69-76, 94-97)
SOR ¶ 1.p alleges Applicant fraudulently filed his 2021 federal income tax return
when  he  identified  three  children  who  are  neither  biological  nor  adopted  as  his
grandchildren when he claimed he was eligible for the child tax credit. Applicant denied
this allegation. He had a tax expert testify and provide a written analysis that indicated
that although he mistakenly identified the children under his care as his “grandchildren”
instead of “foster children” on his 2021 tax return, Applicant was legally entitled to receive
child tax credit as they met the requirements under the tax code. Documentation in the
record showed that Applicant and his wife were granted legal custody of two of the three
children in 2011, but there was insufficient evidence to show that the youngest child was
placed into their custody by Children Services. I find that Applicant testified credibly that
they have custody of all three children. This SOR allegation has been refuted. (GE 7, AE
B, AE D, AE E; Tr. 103-106)
