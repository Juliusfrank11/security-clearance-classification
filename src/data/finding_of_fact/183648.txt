3.a  with   some   explanations,   and   he   denied   SOR  ¶   1.c.  with   an   explanation.  His
admissions  and   other   comments  are  incorporated   into   the   findings  of   fact.   After  a
thorough  and  careful  review  of the  pleadings and  exhibits submitted,  I make  the  following
additional findings of  fact.
Applicant  is  31  years  old.  He  has  been  working  full  time  as  an  independent
contractor for a federal contractor since March 2020. He is attending college part time.
He  served  in  the  U.S.  Army  from  2010  to  2018,  and  was  discharged  honorably  as  a
sergeant.  He  joined  the  Army  National  Guard  in  2018  and  received  a  General  Under
Honorable  Conditions  discharge  in  2019.  (Item  3  at  25.)  He  held  a  security  clearance
while on active duty. Applicant married in 2014 and separated in 2016. The child from the
marriage resides with his spouse. He is in the process of obtaining a divorce. (Item 3 at
28-29.)
The  SOR  alleges  four  delinquent  debts  reflected  in  credit  reports  from  October
2020  (Item  4)  and  December  2021  (Item  5).  The  evidence  concerning  these  debts  is
summarized below.

foreclosure status with a total loan balance of $179,566. Applicant disclosed the debt on
his SCA. In his answer to the SOR he cited his marital situation for why he could not make
the payments. He is attempting to sell the property to get it removed from his credit history.
(Item 4 at 1 and Item 5 at 6.)
SOR ¶ 1.b: a delinquent auto loan with a balance of $8,617. Applicant disclosed
the  debt  on  his  SCA.  In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  explained  the  car  started  having
problems, and when he and his spouse separated, he did not have the money to get it
fixed. The vehicle was repossessed. He states he intends to resolve the debt by the end
of the year. (Item 4 at 7, Item 5 at 2, and Item 10 at 7.)

he settled the debt for a lesser amount. (Item 4 at 8 and Item 5 at 5.)
