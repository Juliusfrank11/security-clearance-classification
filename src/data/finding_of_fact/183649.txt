Applicant  admitted  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.c.  She  denied  the
allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.d through 1.g. Her admissions are incorporated into the findings
of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  testimony,  and  exhibits
submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is  48  years old.  She  married  in  2001  and  has children  ages 22,  14  and
9.  She   earned   a   bachelor’s  degree   in   2005.   She   started   her  current  job   for  a   federal
contractor in  September 2020.  She   was  unemployed   from   June   2008   to   August   2008,
January  2013  to  April 2014, and  May  2017  to  June  2017. She  also  experienced  periods
of   underemployment.  In   June   2017,   her  annual  salary   was  approximately   $70,000   to
$80,000  and  it increased  incrementally. She  now  earns $128,000  since  starting  her new
job  in  2020.  Her husband  is  self-employed  and  earns about $50,000.  (Transcript (Tr.)  15-
20; GE 1)
In February 2007, Applicant and her husband filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy. It was
dismissed in August 2011. She and her husband filed jointly because they did not want
to lose their house and car. They took the mandatory credit-counseling course required
for filing bankruptcy. She explained that in 2007 her husband’s job was the main source
of income. She was working at a restaurant in 2007 and stopped in May 2008 because
her daughter was born in June. She started a new job in August 2008 and worked until
January 2013. She earned about $21,000 annually. (Tr. 21-24, 39-43)
The required monthly bankruptcy payments were withdrawn  from  her husband’s
pay. They were to pay $84 a month for four months and then $450 a month for 56 months.
The case was pending for 57 months and the number of months from filing to her last
payment  was  52  months.  She  testified  that  they  missed  eight  payments.  They  were
notified in January 2011 that they were on probation for six months beginning in February
2011 to make all of their payments or the bankruptcy would be dismissed. She did not
check her husband’s pay stub to ensure the payments were being made. The bankruptcy
was dismissed in August 2011 for failure to make all of the required payments. She stated
that she was unaware at the time that the bankruptcy was dismissed.  Their home was
eventually foreclosed. (Tr. 21-24, 35, 41-50; GE 6)
In  November  2011,  Applicant  filed  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  separately.  She  was
separated from her husband at the time and was taking care of her own finances. They
have reconciled, but she continued to keep their finances separate. She said she wanted
to file bankruptcy again because she wanted to clear up all of the financial issues that
remained from the 2007 bankruptcy. She admitted she was having difficulty paying her
bills because she was trying to take care of her children on a limited income.  She took
the mandatory credit counseling again required to file bankruptcy. Her monthly payments
were $90 for 60 months. (Tr. 22-24, 50-52)
Applicant’s  car  stopped  working  and  her  lawyer  told  her  to  surrender  it  to  the
lienholder.  She  did  not  understand  that  she  was  still  required  to  make  the  bankruptcy
payments. She said the car was the only remaining secured debt on the bankruptcy. She
said the amount remaining that she owed  for the car was $2,200. She had $65,000 of
unsecured debts. She believed that by surrendering the car it resolved that debt and the
bankruptcy  was  completed.  She  did  not  think  she  had  to  make  any  other  bankruptcy
payments. She said she confirmed this with her lawyer.  She then got a letter from her
lawyer  telling  her  that  her  bankruptcy  was  dismissed,  and  she  could  not  make  up  the
missed payments. She had made 53 payments. She did not find out until 2017 that the
bankruptcy was dismissed in June 2016 and her debts were not discharged.  Applicant
testified that her lawyer explained the difference between a discharge and dismissal in
bankruptcy. She said she then realized  that she needed her debts to be discharged to
move on and start over. (Tr. 22-25, 44, 53-73)
Applicant said from June 2016 to May 2017, she paid her monthly bills and tried
not to accumulate new debts. She tried to pay some small bills, but could not afford to
pay any of the larger ones. She was living separately from her husband and was receiving
minimal support for the children. In June 2017, she started a new job and earned between
$70,000 and $80,000 annually. (Tr. 52-53, 77-80)
Applicant  filed  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  again  in  May  2017.  She  had  the  same
attorney for the three times she filed bankruptcy. She explained that she decided to file
bankruptcy again because she wanted to have a free and clear discharge of her debts.
She wanted a record to show she was trying to complete her bankruptcy and have her
debts discharged. She listed her assets as $20,856 and her liabilities as $106,959. She
explained the bulk of her liabilities were student loans (approximately $83,000 is student
loans).  She  testified that  her bankruptcy payments  were  sent  to  her attorney,  and  she
was  making  timely  payments  and  owed  one  final  payment  of  $128.  She  had  moved
residences and her lawyer did not have her new address and did not contact her about
the  last payment.  She missed  the  last payment,  and  it  was  too  late  to  have  her debts
discharged. She did not want to file a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The Chapter 13 bankruptcy
was  dismissed  in  March  2020.  Based  on  Applicant’s  testimony  it  is  obvious  she  was
confused  about  the  bankruptcy  process  as  many  of  the  debts  she  wanted  to  clear  up
through bankruptcy were likely barred by the statute of limitations when she filed in May
2017. She believed she was doing the right thing by filing bankruptcy. (Tr. 22-25, 68-75,
80-83)
The  SOR alleged  four delinquent debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.d  - $10,738; 1.e  - $965; 1.f  -
$617; and  1.g  - $403). Applicant denied  the  debt  in SOR ¶ 1.d  because  it  was no  longer
owed to the original creditor. She thought it was a student loan that she had paid. She
said she had a payment agreement with the collection company to settle the debt. She
completed  the  settlement  and  resolved  the  debt  in  January  2022.  She  provided
documentation to show it is resolved. (Tr. 25-26, 85-99; GE 8; AE F)
Applicant made payment arrangements in October 2021 to settle the delinquent
debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e. She affirmed that her contact with the creditor was after the
SOR was issued and it prompted her to take action. This debt was for equipment that she
had not been returned to her cable company. She paid the settlement and resolved the
debt in October 2021. She provided a document showing the debt is resolved. (Tr. 27-28,
99-102; AE G)
Applicant explained that the debt in SOR ¶ 1.f was for a payday loan from about
2017. She was unable to pay it at the time because she did not have the money. After
receipt of the SOR, she made a payment arrangement with the creditor. The debt had
been transferred to a new collection company. She provided a document to show the debt
was resolved. (Tr. 28-30, 103-107; AE D)
Applicant made payment arrangements to settle the debt in  SOR ¶ 1.g. She made
the required payments and settled the debt in December 2021. She provided a document
to show the debt is resolved. (Tr. 31, 33-34, 107-109; AE H)
Applicant  currently  has  $83,087  of  student  loans  that  are  deferred  under  the
current  government  program.  She  has  made  an  arrangement  with  the  student  loan
creditor to begin making monthly payments in November 2022 to resolve the debt. She
has two credit cards with minimal balances that are current. She spoke with a financial
counselor  on  how  to  manage  her  finances.  Applicant  said  she  never  learned  how  to
manage her finances, and she is trying to be fiscally responsible. Her husband handled
the finances until she took responsibility for her own in 2011. She pays the bulk of the
household  bills.  She  was  trying  to  be  responsible  when  she  chose  to  file  Chapter  13
bankruptcy.  She  was  trying  to  take  care  of  her  children  and  pay  her  bills.  She  is  the
primary person responsible for paying the bills. She is current with paying her bills. She
does not ask about her husband’s finances. She does not rely on her husband for financial
support, even though they live together. She makes sure that she and her daughter are
taken  care  of.  She  takes  full  responsibility  for  her  financial  issues.  Applicant  and  her
husband took a trip to Jamaica in 2021. (Tr. 32, 85-95, 109-128)
The debts listed in her bankruptcy filings include a significant number of medical
debts, utilities, and rent. There are also loans and other consumer debts. Her most recent
credit report does not report the debts from her bankruptcy or new debts other than what
was alleged in the SOR. (GE 6, 8)
