In his Response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations contained in SOR
¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, and 1.f. He denied SOR ¶¶ 1.a, and 1.d. His admissions are incorporated
into these findings of fact.
Applicant is 32 years old. He earned a high school diploma in May 2009, and a
bachelor’s degree  in September 2020. He served on active duty in the Army from July
2010 to June 2016, when he received an Honorable medical discharge. He held a security
clearance during his enlistment that lapsed after his discharge. He and his wife have a
nine-year-old child. He was unemployed while attending college from February 2017 to
September 2020. During that time, the family was supported by his wife’s earnings  and
his disability payments from the Army, although she had to quit working for an unspecified
period due to mental health issues. He is seeking to regain his national security eligibility
in connection with the graphic design associate position that he obtained with a defense
contractor in November 2020. (Item 3; Item 4.)
As discussed below, Applicant admitted four of the six delinquent debts alleged in
the  SOR,  totaling  $17,078.  He  said  during  his  December  2020  interview  with  an
investigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) that he had been using a
credit monitoring service for the previous two years to help him monitor his debts and to
dispute some accounts. He provided no other evidence of progress toward repayment or
other resolution of those debts. The debts are listed in record credit reports dated August
17, 2021; and November 18, 2020. (Item 2; Item 4; Item 5; Item 6.)
SOR ¶  1.a: Applicant  denied  owing  this  $18,645  medical collection  account,  stating
that he  had  never incurred  such  a  debt and  suggesting  that it might be  the  same  as the
SOR ¶  1.b  debt,  to  which he  admitted. Although  reported  by  the  collection  agency  as a
medical debt,  I conclude  that both  of  these  allegations are based  on  the  same  underlying
$12,862  deficiency  that resulted  from  the  automobile  collateral  repossession  by  a  credit
union  discussed below. The  credit reports show  this amount to  be  both  the  final balance
owed  to  the  credit union  and  the  amount of  the  underlying  debt,  for which the  collection
agency  subsequently  claimed  the  interest/fee-inflated  $18,645  debt. It is not resolved, but
represents a  collection  agency’s acquisition  and  subsequent  reporting  of  the  SOR  ¶  1.b
credit union  repossession deficiency. (Item 2; Item 4; Item  5; Item 6.)
SOR ¶  1.b: Applicant  and  his wife  purchased  a  car  for  $36,069  while  he  was in  the
Army. They  could no  longer afford to  make  the  required  loan payments after his medical
discharge,  while using  available funds for other priorities.  The car was repossessed later
in 2016, and the credit union that made the loan closed the account and charged off the
resulting  $12,862  deficiency  balance.  Applicant  admitted  this  debt,  but  offered  no
evidence of any effort to  contact the creditor or otherwise  resolve it, despite telling the
OPM investigator in December 2020 that he would do so immediately. (Item 2; Item 3;
Item 4; Item 5; Item 6.)
SOR ¶  1.c: Applicant took out a  personal loan  from  the  Army  Air  Force Mutual Aid
Association   while   he   was  still   on   active   duty,  but  stopped   making   the   $100   monthly
repayments when  he  was discharged  in June  2016. The  Association  placed  the  unpaid
$3,504  account  balance  for  collection  in  September 2018.  In  December  2020,  Applicant
said to  the  OPM  investigator that he  would contact the  collection  agency  immediately  and
begin  to   repay   this delinquency.  He  provided   no   evidence   of  any   action   since  2016   to
resolve the debt.  (Item  2; Item 3; Item 4; Item  5; Item 6.)
SOR ¶  1.d: Applicant  denied  owing  an  $1,881  debt  to  a cell  phone  company  that
he told  the  OPM  investigator was incurred  when  he  switched  service providers in 2018.
However, the  relevant credit report entries  show  that this debt was assigned  for collection
in  February   2014.  Applicant  provided   no   evidence   supporting   a  reasonable  basis  for
disputing this debt, or showing  other action to resolve  it.  (Item  2; Item 4; Item  5; Item 6.)
SOR ¶  1.e: Applicant  admitted  owing  the  $568  credit  card  debt  that  was  placed  for
collection  in  June  2018. Applicant  said he  chose  to  stop  paying  it when  he  left the  Army
in June  2016,  using  his  available funds  for other purposes.  He offered  no  evidence  of any
action  to resolve  this debt.  (Item 2; Item  4; Item 5; Item  6.)
SOR  ¶   1.f:   Applicant  admitted   that  he   owes   the   $144   delinquent   debt  to   a   pet
hospital that was placed  for collection  in  January  2017. He offered  no  evidence  of any
action  to resolve this debt.  (Item 2; Item  4; Item 5.)
Applicant  submitted  no  evidence  concerning  income  from  his  current  DoD
contractor position, or of his regular monthly living expenses, to demonstrate his current
or foreseeable possibility of financial responsibility. There is no indication he has received
legitimate financial counseling or education. The credit bureaus also report that he has
approximately $50,000 in student loan debt in good standing or deferred.
The  record  contains  no  evidence  concerning  Applicant’s  job  performance,
trustworthiness, or character in a professional setting. It is also silent with respect to his
track record in handling sensitive information and observation of security procedures. I
was unable to evaluate his credibility, demeanor, or character in person, since he elected
to have his case decided without a hearing.
