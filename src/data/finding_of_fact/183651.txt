Applicant  admitted  the  SOR  allegations  in  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.e.  He  denied  the  SOR
allegations  in  ¶¶  1.c,  1.b,  and  1.d.  Applicant’s  admissions  are  incorporated  into  the
findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  testimony,  and
exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 58 years old. He attended college  for two years, but did not earn a
degree. He was married from  1987 to 1991 and from 1996 to 2015.  He has one adult
child  from  his  last  marriage.  He  served  in  the  military  from  1983  to  1987  and  was
honorably discharged. Applicant was employed from June 2012 to April 2014 by a federal
contractor. He worked for a commercial contractor from April 2014 to June 2014 and was
unemployed  from  June  2014  to  February  2016.  Since  February  2016,  he  has  been
employed by a federal contractor. His current salary is $93,000. (Transcript (Tr.) 17-25;
GE 1)
Applicant  attributed   his  financial  problems   to   his  period   of   unemployment  from
June   2014   to   February   2016   and   his  2015   divorce.   The   SOR  alleges  two   charged-off
credit card debts (¶ 1.a  - $17,514  and  ¶  1.b  - $10,060), two  medical collection  accounts
(1.c - $1,126  and  1.d  - $1,552) and  approximately  $7,000  of unpaid federal  income  taxes
(¶  1.e).   The   allegations  are   corroborated   by   Applicant’s   admissions  in   his  security
clearance  application  (SCA),  statements made  to  a  government investigator, and  credit
reports from  February  2018, May  2019, January  2021, and  October 2022.  (GE 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7; AE E)
In Applicant’s January 2018 SCA, he disclosed that he failed to file his 2015 federal
income tax return because he and his wife were going through a divorce, and he believed
she had filed a joint return for them. She filed her 2015 federal tax return as single. In
Applicant’s SCA, he stated, “I have cleared this up and paid all monies owed.” He also
said in his SCA that he resolved  that tax debt in 2016 and  he paid what he owed  and
owed nothing additional. (GE 1)
Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator in December 2018. During
the interview, he told the investigator that in 2017, he received a notice from the IRS that
he had failed to file his 2014 federal income tax return and he owed $10,000. Applicant
said he was aware that the IRS had seized his refunds for subsequent tax years, but he
never contacted the IRS to make payment arrangements. He said he filed the delinquent
2014 federal tax return in 2017. He said he relied on the IRS to withhold his refunds until
the  tax  debt  was  paid.  He  said  he  had  spoken  with  a  tax  preparer and  he  planned  to
contact the IRS to start a payment plan by January 2019. In his answer to the SOR, he
stated, “I admit amount is still owed but I am paying IRS back-February 2020 I sent $1,800
and send approximately $100 per month.” At his hearing, Applicant did not provide proof
of  the payments he  claimed he made to the IRS. He testified that he never made any
voluntary payments to the IRS. It is unknown if the delinquent filing was for tax year 2014
or 2015. (GE 6)
Applicant testified  that when he was going through his divorce he thought his wife
would file their tax return as joint, but she  filed single for tax year 2015. He was unaware
until he  received  a  notice  from  the  IRS  in  approximately  2017  about  his delinquent  2015
taxes, but failed  to  make  payment  arrangements  with  them.  He  said  he  received  two  or
three  letters advising  him  of  the  tax  debt and the  last one  was in 2021.He called  the  IRS
on  the  telephone, but got tired  of waiting  on  hold.  He received  the  SOR in June  2020  that
alleged  his  delinquent  tax  debt.  He  reiterated  that he  relied  on  the  IRS to  withhold  any
refund   he   was  to   receive   and   apply   it  to   his  delinquent  tax   debt.  Applicant   has  not
contacted  the  IRS  to  make  payment arrangements to  pay  his delinquent taxes.  (Tr. 26-
35)
Post-hearing, Applicant provided documents to show that on October 19, 2022, he
employed the services of a tax relief company (TRC). Based on the emails he provided,
the TRC is investigating his tax issues and he had an appointment to meet with them on
November  1,  2022.  No  evidence  was  presented  to  show  Applicant  has  made  any
payments on his tax debt with the IRS. (AE A, B, C, D)
Applicant admitted he owed the credit card debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b and that
he is the sole owner of the accounts. His credit reports show that both debts were charged
off and the date of last activity was in 2016. Applicant disclosed both debts in his SCA
and said he had some financial difficulties due to his divorce, but he was working to pay
back both creditors. He said he was working with each of these creditors to make payment
arrangements to pay the debts. (Tr. 35-37; GE 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
During his background interview, Applicant told the government investigator that
he did not have the money to pay these accounts. He said he did not intend to pay the
account in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b, because he does not have the money. At his hearing, he
testified that he was making $20 payments twice a month for three years on the debt in
SOR ¶ 1.b that had a charged-off balance of $10,060. He said he has no idea what the
current balance is on the debt. He testified that he had made no effort to repay the debt
in SOR ¶ 1.a. He explained the reason he did not pay these debts was that he was angry
with his ex-wife. In his background interview, he told the investigator he used the credit
cards for living expenses. In his post-hearing email, he confirmed he has not made an
effort to repay the credit card debt in SOR ¶ 1.a. He agreed to provide proof that he has
been making payments on the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b, but did not. (Tr. 35-41; GE 6)
Applicant testified that he paid the collection accounts for medical services alleged
in SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d, and he would provide documentary proof of the resolution of these
debts. Applicant explained that during his 2014 period of unemployment, he did not have
medical  insurance  and  these  debts  became  delinquent.  He  said  he  contacted  the
creditors and made payment arrangements. His January 2021 credit report reflects the
debt in SOR ¶ 1.c was paid. He did not provide proof he paid the debt in SOR ¶ 1.d. (Tr.
41-47; GE 5)
Applicant  testified  that  he  purchased  a  2020  sports  car  two  months  ago  for
$73,000. He traded in his 2016 sports car, which he purchased in 2017, which he was
making approximately $1,300 monthly payments. His new vehicle loan reduced his car
payment to $1,000 a month. He has about $1,200 in his checking account and $5,000 in
his  saving  account.  He  has  not  participated  in  financial  counseling.  He  has  a  pension
plan, but no other investments. He withdrew money from his pension plan in 2014 to pay
his medical expenses because he was unemployed and did not have medical insurance.
He  did  not  pay  the  taxes  at  the  time  of  the  withdrawal.  He  does  not  provide  financial
support for anyone. (Tr. 48-56)
Two witnesses testified on behalf of Applicant. His supervisor stated that he has
known Applicant for about six or seven years. He described him as reliable, responsible,
and  exemplary.  He  completes  the  tasks  assigned  and  the  customers  provide  positive
feedback on his work. Applicant has not had any disciplinary action. (Tr. 57-62)
The  other  witness  testified  that  he  has  known  Applicant  both  personally  and
professionally  for  about  20  to  25  years.  Their  children  played  soccer  together  and
Applicant  is his daughter’s  coach.  He  is a  dedicated family  man.  In  his work  capacity,
Applicant is an outstanding employee. He is kind, honest, hardworking, punctual, and a
valuable asset to the command and the nation. (Tr. 63-67)
Applicant  testified  that  he  would  never  put  his  country  in  danger  and  disclose
sensitive information. He has had a clearance for many years without incident. His family
members have served in the military and he is dedicated to his country.
Applicant repeatedly made contradictory statements and misrepresentations in his
SCA, his answer to the SOR, his interview with the government investigator, and in his
testimony during his hearing. I did not find him credible.
