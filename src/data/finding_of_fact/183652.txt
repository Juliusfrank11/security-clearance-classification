Applicant,  32,  has  worked  for  a  federal  contracting  company  as  a  structural
engineer since February 2018. He completed a security clearance application, his first,
in October 2018. Applicant’s background  investigation  revealed  that he  has delinquent
student  loan  debt.  The  SOR  alleges  that  he  owes  $35,887  on  five  delinquent  student
loans. He admits the allegations. (Tr. 17-18; GE 1)
Applicant  attended  college  between  August  2008  and  December  2013,
graduating with a degree in visual media design. He financed his education with student
loans, borrowing $22,000.  After graduation, he completed an unpaid internship. He did
not secure a paying job until August 2014, when he began working for a small graphic
design company. He left the job after six months and was unemployed for two months
before  finding  a  part-time  retail  position.  He  started  a  full-time  position  as  a  graphic
designer with another company in September 2015. He left the position a month later,
citing a mutual agreement between himself and the company. Because he did not own
his designs, he could not develop a professional portfolio, which was necessary to show
prospective  graphic  design  employers.  In  effort  to  develop  more  transferrable  skills,
Applicant enrolled in a local community college to take classes in architectural drawing.
He  took  classes  between  July  2016  and  December  2017,  which  he  paid  for  out  of
pocket. (Tr. 18-19, 23-24, 42-43)
Between  November  2015  and  2018,  he  worked  a  series  of  low-paying,  entry-
level retail jobs. He could not afford to make payments on his student loan accounts. He
received  the  offer  of  employment  from  his  current  employer  in  November  2017.
Because he thought he would begin work immediately, he moved from his apartment in
his hometown in State 1 to the location of the new job in a higher cost of living market in
State 2. However, he did not receive a start date for another three months. In addition to
the  higher  cost  of  living,  Applicant  has  experienced  a  series  of  financial  setbacks.  In
August  2018,  he  experienced  a  medical  crisis  and  passed  out  at  work.  He  required
surgery and  the  treatment  resulted  in  $560  medical  bills,  which  he  paid  between  April
and August 2019. Because the incident happened at work, his employer required him to
go on short-term disability until the facility’s medical office deemed him able to return to
work. Applicant was out of work for approximately one month.  (Tr. 20-22, 30-32, 46-48;
GE 2; AE L-M)
In  November  2018,  his  car  became  inoperable  months  before  he  satisfied  the
loan  on  the  vehicle.  Once  the  loan  was  satisfied,  he  planned  to  apply  the  monthly
payment toward his student loans. Instead, he purchased a new car, which was totaled
in  an  accident  shortly  after  he  purchased  it.  In  late  2018,  Applicant’s  father  began  to
experience  significant  health  issues  and  became  unable  to  work  sometime  in  2019.
Applicant began making bi-monthly trips to State 1 to help his mother care for his father.
Although Applicant does not provide his parents financial support on a regular basis, he
incurs  expenses  related  to  his  trips  to  State  1  and  assists  his  parents  with  food  and
other expenses, as needed. (Tr. 30-33, 48, 51; GE 2)
In  the  nine  years  since  he  graduated  from  college,  the  balance  of  his  student
loan accounts has more than doubled. According to the credit reports in the record, the
balance  has  increased  from  $22,000  to  over  $52,000.  Between  2018  and  2019,  he
made $1,000 in payments on the loans alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d. He also paid $180 on an
unalleged  student  loan  account.  Currently,  his  student  loan  accounts  are  in  good
standing  because  of  the  Covid-19  student  loan  payment  pause  issued  by  President
Biden in March 2020. Applicant testified that he does not earn enough money to pay his
living expenses and his student loans. He is aware that his income makes him available
for loan forbearance once the pause is lifted. However, because of the accruing interest,
he  is hesitant  to  apply for the  relief  even  if  doing so  returns his  student loans  to good
standing. (Tr. 26-27, 53-54; AE A-I, K)
Applicant  is a  salaried employee.  His  net  income  is  just  over $31,000  annually.
His  recurring  expenses  are  for  housing,  transportation,  and  food.  He  cancelled  his
internet  service  to  reduce  his  monthly  expenses.  After  paying  his  recurring  bills  each
month,  he  has  approximately  $300  in  disposable  income.  The  credit  reports  in  the
record  show  an  otherwise  favorable  credit  history.  Applicant  does  not  have  any  credit
cards. His only consumer debt is for his car loan. The account is in good standing. (Tr.
22; GE 3-4)
Although  Applicant  does  not  have  a  government-issued  security  clearance,  his
employer  has  granted  him  access  to  proprietary  information  related  to  his  job  duties.
Applicant reported that he has handled that responsibility without incident. (Tr. 38)
