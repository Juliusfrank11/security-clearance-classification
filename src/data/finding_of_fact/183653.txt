In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied all of the allegations in SOR ¶ 1 and
the allegation in SOR ¶ 2, with explanations.
Applicant is 48 years old and married since 2002. He has two children, ages 9 and
19 years old. He served in the Army on active duty from 1992 to1998 and received an
honorable discharge. He then served in the Army National Guard from 1998 to 2007. He
was an E-5 at the time of his honorable discharge. (GE 1) He has held a Secret clearance
since 1992. (Tr. 24) He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2007. He used his G.I. benefits to
attend college. (Tr. 28-29)
Applicant started working for federal contractors in 2008. He has worked for his
current employer since 2010. (GE 1) In 2013, he was earning about $80,000 annually. In
2018 or 2019, he was promoted and transferred to a new location. He anticipates earning
about $100,000 this year. (Tr. 19-24)
Financial Considerations
In  about  March 2016, Applicant  was  in  a  serious  automobile  accident,  involving
three cars. His shoulder was injured, which prevented him from working 20 to 30 hours
of overtime per pay period. This resulted in a 30% loss of income. He did not return to his
previous level of income for about two years. (Tr. 30-33)
Subsequent  to  this accident,  Applicant filed a  lawsuit  against  one  of  the  drivers
involved in the accident for the injury to his shoulder. In May 2022, the case was settled
for $20,500; however, the medical bills have not been settled according to  his lawyer’s
July 2022 email. (AE G) Applicant said some of the medical debts in the SOR relate to
his accident. (Tr. 38) During a September 2019 interview with an investigator, Applicant
said his lawyer had advised him not to pay the medical bills until the case is settled. (GE
2 at 5)
A week prior to his accident, Applicant’s wife had a stroke and was hospitalized for
a couple weeks. While recovering, she had a heart attack. At the time of her stroke, she
had been earning about $50,000 to $60,000 annually. Her medical condition prevented
her from returning to work and she lost her position. For the first year after his accident
and her stroke, both of them spent time in the hospital. She continued to be hospitalized
periodically for the next couple of years. (Tr. 39-43) His wife handled their finances prior
to her hospitalization. After her stroke, he had to manage the bills and was late paying
them  at  times.  (Tr.  39)  The  loss  of  her  income  and  reduction  in  his  income  had  a
devastating effect on their finances. (Tr. 43; GE 2 at 6) Applicant’s wife finally returned to
work three or four months ago.
Prior to his accident, Applicant paid one student loan for $22,112  in June 2015.
(GE 3 at 6) Subsequently, in January 2018, he paid and settled three student loans, which
totaled $23,030. (Tr. 44-45; GE 2 at 4; AE E, AE F)
Based on credit bureau reports (CBRs) from September 2019, February 2020, and
June 2022, the SOR alleged 14 delinquent debts totaling about $41,905, which became
delinquent between 2015 and 2019. (GE 3, GE 4, GE 5) The status of each debt is as
follows:
1.   The  alleged  student loan  in  SOR  ¶  1.a  for  $19,367  and  the  student  loan  in  SOR  ¶
1.n  for $17,659  were consolidated. According  to  the  June  2022  CBR, the  balance
is $31,174. Applicant  made  monthly  payments of $144  from  August 2020  to  June
2022.  He continues to  make  those  payments.  (Tr. 50, 53; GE  3  at 5;  AE  D; AE  I-1
through I-33)  They are being resolved.
2.   The   $1,454   credit  card   debt  alleged   in  SOR  ¶   1.b  is   a   judgment   for  three   credit
cards  owed  to  the  same  creditor.  Applicant  said he  settled  the  judgment  for $500
and  paid  it 2015  or 2016. He submitted  two  credit card  statements from  August and
September 2015, both  of  which show  smaller amounts past due.  Since  receiving
the  SOR,  he  called  the  creditor, who  told  him  the  account  is  closed. (Tr. 58-60; AE
H-3 and H-4) There is insufficient evidence to  conclude  that it is resolved.
3.   The  $389  collection  account  alleged  in SOR ¶  1.c was paid  post-hearing. It  was a
medical debt from  2015. (AE H-1)  It is resolved.
4.   The  $213  medical debt alleged  in SOR ¶  1.d  is unresolved. Applicant is unsure if
this debt  was resolved  through the lawsuit or  is  waiting to be resolved. (Tr. 66)
5.   The  $166  collection  account  alleged  in  SOR ¶  1.e  was paid  post-hearing. It  was a
medical debt from  2015. (AE H-2)  It is resolved.
6.   Nine  SOR  alleged  medical debts  are  unresolved: ¶¶  1.d  for $213;  1.f  for $140; 1.g
for $140; 1.h  for $129; 1.i for $1,294; 1.j for 561; 1.k for $108; 1.l for  $72; and  1.m
for $213. They  were opened  between  2015  and  2017. They  total $2,870  and  they
were reported  as collection  accounts in September 2019. Some  or all  of  these  debts
may   be   pending   resolution   through   Applicant’s  personal  injury   lawsuit.  Applicant
thinks he  may have paid some. (Tr. 68-69; GE  at 5; AE G)
Applicant has resolved or is resolving $37,581 of the $41,905 alleged debt. Nine
medical debts, totaling $2,870, may be related to his accident, and are yet to be resolved.
The $1,454 credit card debt is not resolved. He stated that if any of these reported debts
were found to be his, he would pay them. (Tr. 78)
Applicant submitted  his budget.  His net  monthly  income  is $6,868  and  includes  his
wife’s income.  Their  expenses total  $2,585  and  payments  on  debts,  including  a  mortgage
and  student loans, are $3,205. They  have  $1,079  remaining  in  their budget  at  the  end of
the  month. (AE A)  He  has not participated in  credit or budget counseling. (Tr. 75)
Personal Conduct
The SOR alleged that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose delinquent financial
accounts in his August 2019 SCA). He denied that he intentionally failed to disclose that
information or attempted to deceive the Government.
During  his  September  2019  interview,  Applicant  said  he  misunderstood  the
financial questions. He told the investigator that he had recently learned of some student
loans with which he was unfamiliar. He was disputing them because he paid them, but
they  had  switched  creditors.  In  his  March  2021  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  again
denied that he intentionally attempted to deceive the Government about his finances. He
testified that he believed he had paid his debts and his accounts were current when he
submitted his SCA. He said that he also had found debts on his credit report that were
not his. (Tr. 71-73; GE 2 at 5)
