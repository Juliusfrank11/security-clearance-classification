Applicant is a  40-year-old employee  of  a  government  contractor  for whom  he  has
worked since April 2018.  He works in aircraft maintenance.  He previously  worked for the

In  the  SOR,  the  Government  alleged  Applicant’s  six  delinquent  debts  totaling
approximately $19,000. These delinquencies consist of auto loans, personal loans, and
a credit card. Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations with additional comment. His
admissions are adopted as findings of fact. (Answer; GE 1-5)
The   $13,737   auto   loan   alleged   in  SOR  ¶   1.b   has  not  been   resolved.  Applicant
opened   this   account  in   2015   to   purchase   a   vehicle.  The   vehicle   was  repossessed   in
2016  a  few  months after he  stopped  making  payments.  He told the  investigator during
his  2019   security   interview   that  he   was  making   $100   per  month   payments  on   this
account.   However,  he   testified   that   he   has  not  reached   out  to   the   creditor  to   make   a
payment arrangement on  this account and  has made  no  payments on  this account after
2016.  He provided  no  documentary  evidence  of  any  payments on  this account.  (Tr. 41-
45; GE 1-5)
The $3,477 auto loan alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c has not been resolved. This account
became delinquent in 2014 when Applicant totaled his car and his insurance company
did  not  cover  the  full  amount  of  the  loan.  Applicant  initially  believed  that  he  had  GAP
insurance  on  the  vehicle  but  later  learned  that  he  did  not.  In  May  2021,  Applicant
contacted  the  creditor  to  make  a  payment  arrangement  but  he  has  not  made  any
payments on this account. (Tr. 45-48; GE 1-4)
The  $1,225  credit  card  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.d  has  not  been  resolved.  Applicant
opened this account in 2013. It has a last activity date of November 2013.  He claimed
that he paid this account in May 2021 after making monthly payments, but he provided
no documents to corroborate this claim. (Tr. 49-51; GE 1-4)
The $288 personal loan alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e has not been resolved. Applicant
opened  this  account  to  pay  some  bills.  He  opened  the  account  in  July  2013  and  it
became delinquent in September 2013. He claimed that he paid this account in full on
an unspecified date, but he provided no documents to corroborate this claim. (Tr. 51-54;
GE 2-4)
The  $234  personal  loan  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.f  has  not  been  resolved.  Applicant
opened this account to pay living expenses in October 2013 and it became delinquent in
December  2013.  He  claimed  that  he  paid  this  account  in  full,  but  he  provided  no
documents to corroborate this claim. (Tr. 54-55; GE 2-4)
The  $36  credit  card  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.g  has  not  been  resolved.  Applicant
opened  this  account  in  March  2017.  It  has  a  last  activity  date  of  August  2017.  He
claimed  that he  paid  this account in full  in May  2021, but he  provided  no  documents to
corroborate this claim. (Tr. 55-57; GE 2-4)
Applicant attributed his financial issues to his purchase of a healthcare business
that  did  not  perform  as  expected.  He  and  his  wife  purchased  this  business  in  about
October 2013. He had some experience in the industry prior to the purchase. He paid
about $25,000 for the business, which he paid in monthly installments. He tapped into
about  $10,000  of  his  retirement  savings  in  order  to  pay  for  living  expenses  until  the
healthcare business started making some money.  He also borrowed money to pay for
living expenses. He owned the business for about three years. At some point while they
owned it, licensing requirements stalled their ability to earn income. This lack of income
and the amount of work the business required led him to sell the business in about 2016
for $25,000. Despite selling the business, it left him in debt. (Tr. 25-34, GE 1, 2)
After  he  sold  the  healthcare  business,  Applicant  continued  to  work  in  the
healthcare  industry,  but  he  earned  significantly  less  money  ($8-$10  per  hour)  than  he
had while working as a government contractor. He claimed that he tried to find a job in
aircraft maintenance, but was unable to find one until 2018. Applicant works between 40
and 60 hours per week. He earns $42.65 per hour and about $60 per hour for overtime.
He  has  earned  between  $40  and  $60  per  hour  since  April  2018.  Last  year,  he  took
home  about  $70,000  and  his  wife  took  home  about  $12,000.  He  takes  home  at  least
$5,000  per  month.  He  has  about  $200  in  a  checking  account  and  no  money  in  his
savings account. He has a retirement account with a balance of about $13,000. He pays
about  $1,200  per  month  for  his  daughter’s  college  expenses.  Applicant  purchased  a
new  SUV  for  his  wife  in  2019  for  $36,000.  He  pays  $676  per  month  for  this  vehicle.
Applicant purchased a new vehicle for his daughter sometime in the last two years. His
monthly payment on this vehicle is $421. Applicant was unable to testify accurately what
his monthly expenses are or whether he has a budget surplus at the end of each month.
He has never taken any credit counseling. (Tr. 24-25, 34-41, 69, 77)
Applicant  has  at  least  two  additional  credit  card  accounts  on  which  he  is
delinquent that are not listed in the SOR.1  He claimed that, in the two weeks prior to the
hearing,  he  made  payment  arrangements  to  bring  these  two  accounts  current  in  the
future. He was also delinquent on his account for the aforementioned 2019 SUV in July
2022, but claimed he is now current on that account. (Tr. 73-75, 79-80; GE 5)
In May 2021, Applicant sent a letter to Equifax disputing the debts listed in SOR
¶¶  1.a  (withdrawn)-1.c.  He  did  not  provide  a  basis  for  his  dispute.  He  did  not  provide
evidence of the outcome of his claim. (Answer)
