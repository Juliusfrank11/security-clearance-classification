Applicant is a 66-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for
her current employer  since  December 2015. She  seeks to  retain a security clearance,
which  she  has  held  most  recently  since  about  2016.  She  has  a  bachelor’s  degree
earned  in  1978,  a  master’s  degree  earned  in  1985,  and  a  Ph.D.  earned  in  1989.  She
has never married, and she has no children. (Tr. at 24; GE 1, 5; AE B)
The   SOR  alleges  six   delinquent   debts   totaling   about  $26,787.   The   debts   are
established through credit reports and  Applicant’s admissions.
A  number  of  events  contributed  to  Applicant’s  financial  problems.  She  paid
$10,000  to  help  her  mother  move  in  2002.  In  about  2004,  her  employer  closed  its
branch  in  her  geographic  location.  She  bought  into  a  franchise  that  ultimately  faiIed,
costing  her  thousands  of  dollars.  In  2006,  her  mother  had  a  series  of  strokes,  and
Applicant  paid  to  move  her  to  a  state  where  she  had  family.  Pipes  burst  during  the
winter of 2013, causing expenses not covered by insurance. She had to pay deductibles
and other costs for a surgery in 2015. In 2017, a drunk driver drove a truck through her
fence and into her pool. Insurance did not pay for all of the repairs. She had surgery in
2018 that was not covered by insurance. She had to pay the deductibles for a surgery in
2019  and  follow-up  appointments  in  2020.  In  2019,  she  had  expenses  related  to  a
cracked water pipe, a leaking faucet, and overhanging tree limbs. In 2021, a water pipe
broke. Insurance paid for the damages, but she had to pay the deductible. She had to
pay for the repairs to her pool after a snowstorm in 2022. (AE H, N, P, V, W, X)
Applicant lived in State A from 2007 to 2012, and State B from 2012 to 2015. She
moved  to  State  C  in  2015  to  accept  her  current  job.  She  was  making  mortgage
payments on houses in States A and B. She was paying to fix the house in State A so
that she could sell it, and she was also making repairs to the house in State B. She was
unable  to  maintain  payment  on  all  of  her  bills,  and  several  debts  became  delinquent.

Applicant has owned a part-time jewelry business for about ten years. She sells
her products at gem and jewelry trade shows, which can involve travel to other states.
She bought a camper in about 2014 for about $20,000 to $25,000. She planned to use
the  camper  to  travel  to  trade  shows  and  stay  in  the  camper.  She  paid  for  the  camper
with  cash  and  a  charge  to  a  credit  card  for  about  $13,000.  She  stopped  paying  the
credit card in about 2017. SOR ¶ 1.c alleges the $13,896 balance on that debt. During
her September 2019 background interview, Applicant stated that she was attempting to
sell the camper and would put the proceeds toward this debt. She  sold the camper for
$5,000  this  year.  She  used  the  proceeds  from  the  sale  to  pay  some  bills,  but  not  this
debt. (Tr. at 28-29, 32-34, 37-38; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE M)
Applicant purchased a timeshare for campgrounds at the same time she bought
the camper. She felt that she could park the camper at various campgrounds when she
traveled  for trade  shows.  She  stated  that  she  stopped  making  payments  because  she
was misled about the benefits from the timeshare and she was told that she could sell it
at any  time, but she  could not.  SOR ¶ 1.b  alleges the  $3,986  balance  on  the  financing
for the timeshare. (Tr. at 42-45; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 3, 5)
Applicant  purchased  a  water  filtration  system  for  her  current  home  for  about
$6,400 or $6,500 in about 2017. The sales pitch was that the savings from the system
would equal the monthly payments on the financing for the system. The savings did not
add up to the monthly payments. In addition,  the  system took  salt, which  was  another
expense.  Applicant  felt  that  she  was  misled,  and  she  stopped  making  payments.  She
admitted that the  local water is “not that great,” and  it has “a rather bad  smell  to  it,” so
her water is better with the system.  SOR ¶ 1.a alleges the $6,490 balance due on the
financing  on  the  system.  The  creditor  placed  a  lien  on  Applicant’s  home  for  the  loan.
She cannot refinance the mortgage  or sell the home unless she pays the debt. (Tr. at
39-42; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 5; AE M)
Applicant asserted that she paid the $748; $1,583; and $84 debts alleged in SOR
¶¶ 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f. The $748 and $1,583 debts are listed on the August 2020 Experian
credit report and the August 2021 Equifax credit report. They are not listed on any of the
credit  reports obtained from the three credit reporting agencies  in October 2022. They
were not dropped from the reports because of age, as the debts were less than seven
years old. She paid the $84 debt in April 2021. (Tr. at 45-46; GE 2-4; AE S-U)
Applicant stated that she receives minimal income from her jewelry business, but
it provides her some tax benefits. She is a part-time consultant for a food company. She
earns  about  $17  an  hour  and  works  about  four  or  five  hours  a  week.  She  receives  a
discount  on  the  company’s  food  products,  which  helps  with  her  expenses.  She  has
about $88,300 in a retirement account. (Tr. at 29-30; AE G, H, R)
Applicant  sold  the  houses  in  States  A  and  B  in  2016.  She  broke  even  on  the
house in State A. She made about $20,000 on the sale of the house in State B, which
she used as a down payment on her current house in State C. (Tr. at 36-37)
Applicant plans to refinance the mortgage on her home and use the equity to pay
her delinquent debts. She is unable to refinance at this time because her credit score is
too low. She is working to improve the score. Except for the unpaid debts, her finances
have improved. She earns a good salary. She is working with an investment broker to
build her retirement. She works whatever overtime is available. She has learned how to
service the pool herself. She lives a frugal lifestyle. She has a budget with an estimated
$450 left over at the end of the month. The budget did not reflect any payments toward
her  delinquent  debts.  Potential  upcoming  expenses  include  straightening  her  teeth,
repairing issues from previous surgery, repairs and improvements to her home and pool
(including  new  roof,  windows,  dishwasher,  and  air  purifier;  and  repairs  to  sewer  pipe,
irrigation system, and deck), and a new car. (Tr. at 21-22, 47; AE A, D, F, J, L, Q, S-U,
X)
Applicant  submitted  documents  attesting  to  her  excellent  job  performance  and
moral  character.  She  is  praised  for  her  kindness,  intelligence,  courage,  work  ethic,
professionalism, knowledge, expertise, and honesty. (AE C, E)
