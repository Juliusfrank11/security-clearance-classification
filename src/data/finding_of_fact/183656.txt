Applicant,  53,  has  worked  for  a  federal  contracting  company  as  a  program
manager since August 2021. He completed a security clearance application on June 27,
2019, while employed by another federal contracting company. He did not disclose any
derogatory  information  on  the  application.  The  ensuing  investigation  revealed  two
delinquent  accounts  totaling  $28,152,  which  are  the  two  SOR  allegations.  (Tr.  17-19,
31; GE 5)
In   2009,  Applicant’s  wife   became   ill  and   was  unable  to   work  for  one-and-a-half
years.  Their   household   income   decreased   from   $90,000   to   $56,000.  Also,   between
2011  and  2019,  Applicant lived  and  worked  apart from  his wife  and  children  outside  the
United   States,   earning   $40,000   annually.  Over  the   course   of  the   eight-year  period,
Applicant  provided  financial  support to   his family   of  four in  the   United   States  and   paid
for  his living  expenses  abroad,  which included  caring  for his elderly  mother  who  lived
with   him.  Applicant  used   the   two   credit  cards  alleged   in  the   SOR  to   make   ends meet.
He  stopped   paying   the   credit  cards  after   the   interest   rates   increased.   When   the
payments  became  unaffordable, he allowed the accounts to become delinquent.  (Tr. 20-
22, 27-30)
In 2021, Applicant contacted his creditors. He set up a payment plan for the debt
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a, for $200 per month to begin in April 2021, and ending in February
2022. The creditor automatically withdrew the payments from his bank account between
April  2021  and  October  2021.  When  he  followed  up  with  the  creditor  as  to  why  the
automatic  withdrawal  stopped,  the  creditor  informed  him  that  they  could  not  find  his
account and could no longer accept payments from him. (Tr. 23-25, 34-37; AE A, D)
Applicant also contacted the creditor alleged in SOR  ¶ 1.b., but could not afford
the terms of the repayment options presented to him. In 2021, the creditor cancelled the
$12,966 debt, issuing Applicant an IRS Form 1099-C. (Tr. 23, 25, 37-38; AE B-C)
Applicant’s  wife  is  currently  working.  Their  household  income  is  approximately
$186,000. The couple has over $500,000 in assets, including their home, cash savings,
and retirement accounts. Applicant is financially stable and lives within his means. He is
able  to  pay  his  oldest  daughter’s  college  tuition  and  living  expenses  without  incurring
debt. After paying the household’s recurring bills, he  has $2,000  in disposable income.
The  most  recent  credit  report  in  the  record  dated  April  2022  shows  no  delinquent
accounts. Each of the 21 reported accounts is in good standing.  (Tr. 34-34, 39-40; GE
