Applicant  is  a  47-year-old  technical  support  employee  for  a  Government
contractor,  employed  since  February  2022.  He  worked  similar  Government  contract
positions since 2015. He graduated from high school in 1993 and attended some college.
He served in the U.S. Army from 1996 to 1999, and again from 2004 to 2014. He was
honorably discharged. He married in 2005 and divorced in 2012. He remarried in 2012,
separated in 2014 and divorced in 2016. He does not have children. He currently holds a
secret level clearance.
The  SOR  alleges  under  Guideline  F  that  Applicant  has  eight  delinquent  debts
totaling  about  $20,544.  Applicant  admitted  to  debts  with  a  bank  (SOR  ¶  1.b);  the
Department  of  Defense  (SOR  ¶  1.c);  a  cable  provider  (SOR  ¶  1.f);  and  a  credit  card
company  (SOR  ¶  1.g).  He  denied  debts  owed  to  an  apartment  complex,  insurance
company, another general creditor, and a wireless provider. The evidence submitted by
the Government supports all of the SOR allegations.
SOR ¶ 1.a is an apartment complex debt for $9,620. Applicant claimed that this
debt belonged to his ex-spouse, which she incurred in 2014 while they were separated.
He stated in his Answer to the SOR that he was disputing the account. He testified that
his ex-spouse moved to another state and apparently leased an apartment, and later left
with an unpaid debt. His name appears as a joint account on his September 2020 credit
bureau  report  (CBR),  however  he  testified  that  he  did  not  sign  the  lease  or  live  in  the
apartment and alleged fraud by his spouse. He stated that he contacted a collection agent
holding the debt in 2021, and was told that the account was closed and they were unable
to  collect  on  the  debt.  No  documentary  evidence  was  provided  to  support  a  dispute,
contact  with  a  collection  agent,  or of  fraud. The  account does  not appear on his 2022
CBR.  (AE  B)  It  is  unclear  why  the  account  has  been  deleted,  but  it  may  have  been
removed because it is beyond the typical seven-year reporting period.
SOR  ¶  1.b  is  a  bank  debt  for  $4,710.  Applicant  stated  in  his  Answer  that  he
contacted the bank and  was  told  that the debt  was  written  off because it  is more than
seven  years  old.  He  testified  that  he  incurred  the  debt  in  about  2014  after  he  left  the
military and was divorced from his first wife. He testified that he discussed the account
with the bank about nine months before the hearing, and agreed to make $100 per month
payments beginning in December 2021. He provided an account statement that does not
show  the  same  account  number  or  debt,  and  a  2022  CBR  that  shows  a  credit  card
account that does not match the alleged debt. (GE 5, AE A and B) There is insufficient
evidence showing Applicant has a repayment agreement or a payment plan, is making
payments, or sought other efforts to resolve the delinquent account.
SOR ¶ 1.c is a charged-off debt owed to the Department of Defense for $2,473.
Applicant claimed in his Answer, that the debt resulted from “not turning paper work in on
time after leaving the military.” He said it was being paid by IRS captures of his income
tax refunds. In testimony, he said the debt was paid off in March 2022, and that he would
provide a receipt. He claimed that he left the debt alone between 2014 and 2022, because
of  the  IRS  actions.  No  documentary  evidence  in  support  of  these  contentions  was
submitted.
SOR ¶ 1.d is a charged-off bank debt for $1,263. In his Answer, Applicant claimed
that the debt was incurred by his ex-spouse during their divorce. He claimed that his name
was added to the account because he still had a joint savings account with his former
spouse, and “so when she applied for the loan it added me into it.” He denied ever signing
a loan agreement or agreed to be on listed on the loan. His ex-spouse has since filed
bankruptcy, and the creditor is pursuing payment from him. (Ans.) In testimony, he said
that his ex-spouse worked for the creditor in 2007 or 2008, and she agreed to a car loan
in about 2010. Applicant has not pursued resolution of the debt, despite being able to pay
it  now.  Applicant’s  CBRs  show  the  account  as  a  charged-off  joint  account  that  was
assigned in 2010, and the last activity was in 2015. (GEs 2-5) The debt no longer appears
on Applicant’s 2022 CBR. It is unclear why the account has been deleted, but it may have
been removed because it is beyond the typical seven-year reporting period.
SOR ¶ 1.e is a collection account for $837. Applicant said in his Answer that he
was unable to determine to whom the debt was owed or how it was incurred. In testimony,
he said he has not contacted the creditor or collection agent, and was not in the state
listed in 2015. He surmised that his ex-spouse opened the account. The debt appears on
Applicant’s  2018  and  2020  CBRs,  and  show  the  collection  account  as  an  individual
account,  assigned  in  2015,  and  defaulted  in  2018.  The  CBR  also  lists  the  original
collection agent. Applicant’s 2022 CBR no longer lists the account. It is unclear why the
account has been deleted, but it may have been removed because it is beyond the typical
seven-year reporting period.
SOR  ¶  1.f  is  a  cable  provider  account  placed  for  collection  for  $315.  Applicant
agreed with the debt, but claimed that it was written off and not collectable as it is over
seven years old. (Ans.) In testimony, he said he contacted the creditor and was told they
did not have a record of the account. He last used the company in 2013, and claimed to
have  returned  equipment  as  required.  The  account  is  no  longer  reflected  on  his  2022
CBR.  It  is  unclear  why  the  account  has  been  deleted,  but  it  may  have  been  removed
because it is beyond the typical seven-year reporting period.
SOR ¶ 1.g is a bank credit card account that was charged off for $400. Applicant
claimed in his Answer that the debt was written off and no longer collectable because it
is over seven years old. (Ans.) In his Office of Personnel Management subject interview,
he  claimed  that  he  never  had  a  bank  credit  card  from  this company,  but  in  testimony,
admitted he did have a credit card. He said he  contacted the creditor in 2021 and was
told the debt was written off and no record exists. It is no longer reflected on his 2022
CBR.  It  is  unclear  why  the  account  has  been  removed,  but  it  may  be  because  it  was
beyond the typical seven-year reporting period.
SOR  ¶  1.h  is  a  wireless  provider  debt  for  $926.  Applicant  said  this  was  a  joint
account  in  which  he  was  removed  after he  separated.  He  testified that he  went  to  the
provider’s store and  asked  to  be  removed  from  the  account. He  admitted to using this
provider, but not since 2014. He said he called the provider in 2021 and was told he was
not on the account. His 2018 CBR shows the account was assigned in 2015, and placed
for collection in 2018. This account does not appear on subsequent CBRs. Applicant did
not address any efforts to resolve the delinquent debt, rather it appears he contested its
reporting as a joint account.
Applicant reported a gross pay of $65,000, with a net remainder of $1,000 after
paying  monthly  expenses.  He  has  about  $27,670  in  a  checking  account,  and  about
$20,000  in  a  401k  retirement  account.  He  claimed  to  have  had  unspecified  financial
counseling while  in  the  military,  but none  since.  He testified  that he made  significantly
less  income  since  leaving the  military,  has  helped  other family members with  financial
expenses, and paid his spouse’s debts.
