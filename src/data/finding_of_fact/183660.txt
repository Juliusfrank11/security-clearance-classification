and   an   alcohol-related   probation   violation.  (Tr.  38)  After  his  most  recent  DUI   arrest  in
2016, he  attended  several outpatient alcohol counseling  and  treatment programs. (Tr. 44-
45)  He   ended   the   toxic  relationship,   and   he   does  not   associate   with   the   people  who

not  arrested   him   since   2016.  (Tr.  20)  He  attends  faith-based   meetings  in  a   12-step
