Applicant admitted the SOR allegations. His admissions are adopted as findings
of fact. After a review  of  the pleadings and  evidence, I make the  additional findings of
fact.
Applicant is 53 years old and an employee who is seeking a cleared position with
a  defense  contractor,  whom  he  formerly  worked  for  in  an  unclassified  position.  He
worked  for  his  last  employer  starting  in  March  2019  and  continued  until  he  recently
resigned  to  apply  for  a  cleared  position  within  the  company.  He  is  a  field  service
technician.  He  served  in  the  U.S.  Army  for  eight  years  until  he  was  honorably
discharged in 1996 holding the rank of staff sergeant (E-6). Since his military discharge,
he  has mostly  been  employed  by  defense  contractors  in  some  capacity.  He  has  been
married  29  years.  He  has  one  child.  His  wife  is  a  nurse.  He  is  involved  with  youth
activities within his community. This is his first request seeking a security clearance. He
did not hold a clearance while in the Army. (Tr. 5-6, 18, 20-21, 23; GE 1)
The SOR alleged that Applicant failed to timely file his 2010-2018 federal income
tax returns as required (SOR ¶ 1.a). The amendment to the SOR at his hearing added
the  allegation  that  he  failed  to  timely  file  his  2019-2021  federal  income  tax  returns  as
required (SOR ¶ 1.b).
Applicant  admitted  the  original  allegation  in  his  SOR  answer  and  admitted  the
amended  allegation  in  his  hearing  testimony.  He  was  straight  forward  with  his
explanation as to why he failed to file federal tax returns for 11 years. He stated that he
relied  on  erroneous  advice  from  coworkers who  professed  that  he  did  not  need  to  file
any federal tax returns as long as he was having enough pay withheld via an IRS W-2
wage  withholding  procedure.  If  he  did  this,  then  the  IRS  would  file  his  returns  for  him
and if he owed more money, it would send him a bill for what he owed. He apparently
believed   this  erroneous  advice,   despite   the   fact  that  he   had   always  been   a   “W-2”
employee  and  had always filed  yearly  tax  returns before  2010. Additionally, his wife filed
her separate  federal tax  returns under the  “married  filing  separate” classification  during
those years. (Tr. 22, 31, 33, 41; SOR Answer)
Applicant stated that he realized that he was wrong about his tax filing obligations
when  he  received  the  SOR  in  November  2020,  however  that  did  not  prompt  him  to
timely  file  his  2020  or  2021  federal  returns.  He  claimed  that  the  full  implication  of  his
non-filing  hit  him  in  September  2021  after  people  from  his  company  explained  the
consequences  of  his  actions  and  how  they  impacted  his  chances  of  receiving  a
clearance. Before this time, he admitted that filing his tax returns was not a priority for
him. (Tr. 30, 46)
Applicant  presented  documentation  supporting  his  testimony  that  he  hired  an
accountant  to  file  his  missing  federal  tax  returns  in  June  or  July  2022.  This
documentation  supports  Applicant’s  claim  that  on  approximately  July  19,  2022,  his
accountant  filed,  on  his  behalf,  federal  income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2012-2021.
There is no documentation to support that his 2010-2011 federal returns were filed or an
explanation for why they were not filed. (Tr. 22; AE A)
Applicant’s  annual  salary  in  his  last  position  was  approximately  $118,000.  He
testified  that  his  credit  is  good  and  that  he  uses  a  written  monthly  budget  to  track  his
finances. He provided a copy of his budget. (Tr. 34, 47; AE B)
