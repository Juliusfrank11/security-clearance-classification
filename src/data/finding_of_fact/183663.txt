The  SOR  alleges  seven  delinquent  medical  accounts,  totaling  $1,159  (¶¶  1.a  –
totaling  $296  (¶  1.h);  a  charged-off
1.g);  a  delinquent  credit  card  account,
communications  services  account,  totaling  $1,134  (¶  1.i);  and  six  U.S.  Department  of
Education  (DOE)  student  loans  in  collection,  totaling  over  $32,125  (¶¶  1.j  –  1.o).  Her
student loans were assigned to collections in 2014 and 2015.
In her answers to the SOR, Applicant denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.h,
because she had either paid or settled the accounts. She admitted the remaining SOR
allegations. (¶¶ 1.i – 1.o) Her admissions are incorporated into my findings of fact. After
a  thorough  review  of  the  record  evidence,  I  make  the  following  additional  findings  of
fact:
Applicant is 36 years old. She graduated from high school in 2005, and attended
college  during three  periods:  August  2005  to  July 2006;  August  2007  to August  2009;
and January 2014 to May 2016. She is still working on earning a college degree. She
has  been  using  student  loans  to  pay  for  her  education.  She  married  in  October  2012
and  divorced  in  October  2017.  She  has  two  children,  a  son,  age  13,  and  a  daughter,
age six.
Applicant’s  employment history indicates she worked for two federal contractors
between  April  2009  and  April  2014.  She  stated  that  the  Office  of  Personnel
Management (OPM) granted her eligibility for access to secret information during part of
that  employment  period.  She  was  unemployed  between  April  2014  and  May  2016;
worked  as  a  bartender  between  May  2016  and  February  2017;  and  was  unemployed
between  February  2017  and  September  2017.  She  worked  part-time  as  a  bartender
between  September  2017  and  October  2017,  and  as  an  assistant  property  manager
between  October  2017  and  December  2017.  She  was  self-employed  between
December 2017 and January 2020, working at a greenhouse and landscaping business.
Her  current  employer  and  security  sponsor,  a  federal  contractor,  hired  her  in  January
2020.
In  Section  26  (Financial  Record)  of  her  2020  SCA,  Applicant  revealed  that  she
was having financial problems and disclosed some of the accounts alleged in the SOR.
She attributed her financial problems to her 2017 divorce, her periods of unemployment
and underemployment, and being the sole provider for her children.
An  OPM  investigator  interviewed  Applicant  in  April  2020.  At  the  time,  she  was
underemployed,  doing  part-time  work  for  a  greenhouse.  She  told  the  investigator  that
she  was  unable  to  pay  her  debts  while  separated  from  her  ex-husband  and  after  her
divorce,  because  she  was  unemployed  or  underemployed.  She  prioritized  her  bill
payments  to  pay  for  living  necessities  and  the  children’s  needs.  She  promised  the
investigator  she  would  start  paying  her  debts  when  she  starts  her  full-time  job.  She
stated that she was willing to pay her debts, but she did not have the earnings to do so.
Concerning her student loan debt, she noted that the IRS withheld her 2018 tax refund
and applied it to her student loan debt. (Item 8)
Applicant’s  documentary  evidence  shows  that  she  paid  the  accounts  alleged  in
SOR ¶¶ 1.a, and 1.d through 1.g, on December 11, 2020. (Encl. 2) She did not present
direct documentary evidence that she paid the accounts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c,
but  her  December  2020  Experian  credit  report  shows  “0”  accounts  in  collection.
Considering  that  she  paid  her  other  medical  accounts  during  that  same  period,  I  find
these two accounts are resolved. (Encl. 4)
Applicant  paid  SOR  ¶  1.h  on  December  11,  2020.  (Encl.  1)  She  made  one
payment  of  $52  to  the  collector  of  the  account  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.i.  It  is  not  clear
whether she entered into a payment agreement to resolve the account. Concerning her
student loan debt, in June 2021, Applicant entered into a payment agreement with the
DOE to start the process to rehabilitate her student loans. (Encl. 5; FORM, Item 3)
Applicant  failed  to  submit  documentary  evidence  about  her  efforts  to  contact
creditors,  of  any  payment  agreements  established,  of  any  payments  made  to  her
creditors  before  she  received  the  SOR  on  December  4,  2020.  She  presented  no
evidence to show she has participated in financial counseling or has a working budget.
She  did  not  present  evidence  of  her current financial  situation  (gross  monthly income,
deductions, monthly expenses, and monthly net  remainder).  Without any documentary
evidence  of  her  current  financial  situation,  it  is  not  possible  for  me  to  assess  whether
she is financially overextended.
