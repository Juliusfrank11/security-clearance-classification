In  answering  the  original  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.g.  He
admitted the cross-allegation at SOR ¶ 2.a, but denied SOR ¶¶ 2.b through 2.e, as well
as  the  cross-allegation  at  SOR  ¶  3.a.  Each  of  his  answers  included  explanations.
Applicant’s SOR admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough
and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the  following
additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  36  years  old.  His  only  marriage  (2013-2019)  ended  in  divorce.  He
has no children. He lives with his long-term girlfriend. He served in the U.S. Army from
2006 to 2014. His duties included a 17-month combat tour in Iraq (2008-2009), a one-
year deployment to Qatar (April 2010 to April 2011), and several months in Afghanistan
(2013).  He  held  a  clearance  in  the  Army,  first  granted  in  2007  and  then  granted  on  a
conditional  basis  in  2012.  Applicant  earned  his  bachelor’s  degree  in  2017,  graduating
cum laude, and he earned a master’s degree  in  business administration  (MBA) in May
2021, with a 3.73 GPA. He has worked for a defense contractor as a research analyst
for about two years. (Answer; GE 1, AE D, AE H, AE I; Tr. 10, 22-33)
In  the  Army,  Applicant  was  awarded  three  Army  Commendation  Medals,  five
Army Achievement Medals, campaign medals for service in Afghanistan (one campaign
star)  and  Iraq  (two  campaign  stars),  the  Combat  Action  Badge,  and  other  appropriate
service  medals,  ribbons,  and  badges.  (AE  D;  AE  E)  He  received  a  general  discharge
under honorable conditions, following his 2013 alcohol-related offense discussed below.
He  has  a  70%  service-connected  disability  rating  from  the  Department  of  Veterans
Affairs, due to PTSD. (AE B, AE C)
Guidelines G  and J:
Applicant  has  a  history  of  alcohol-related  offenses,  from  2004  to  August  2021.
(GE 4 – 8; SOR Ex. 2) They are detailed as follows:
(1) In  December 2004,  around  Christmas, Applicant was arrested  and  charged  in
his home  state  (State  1) with  driving  under the  influence  of alcohol  (DUI) and  underage
possession  of  alcohol. At the  time, he was grieving  the  recent death of  his grandmother.
In   April 2005,   he   was convicted   of  both   offenses, placed  on  probation, and   ordered   to
attend  an  alcohol safety  awareness program. (ASAP)  (SOR ¶  1.a) He  initially  failed  to
complete   the   ASAP   program,  as  alleged,  because   he   had   difficulty   attending   daytime
ASAP  classes  without  reliable transporation. The  judge  gave  him  another chance, and
he  completed  the  classes. (Answer; GE  6; Tr. 83, 87-88, 90) There  is no  indication  that
his  probation   was  “revoked”  as  alleged,  particularly   in  August  2006   (as  alleged),  a
month   before  he   enlisted   in  the   Army.  Applicant  also   disclosed   the   offense   on   his
September 2006 SCA, prepared at the time. (GE 2)
(2) In  early  December 2009, Applicant was arrested  in  State  2  and  charged  with
DUI.   In   March  2010,   he   pleaded   guilty   to   a   lesser   charge   of  first-degree   negligent
driving. He was fined  about  $1,260  and  sentenced  to  90  days in jail, of  which all  but  five
days  were  suspended.  (SOR  ¶   1.b)  Three   months  before  the   arrest,   he   had   returned
stateside  from  a  lengthy  combat  tour in Iraq  and  had  difficulty  readjusting  due  to  PTSD.
He   testified   that  he   was  with   friends  in  a   large,  nearby   city.  He  was  pulled   over  after
getting  lost  on  the  drive  back to  post. He  was taken  into  custody  by  local police. He  did
not serve  time  in jail, but instead  was in a  work release  or weekend  program, which he
fulfilled   in   September  2010   (when   he   was  in   the   U.S.  for  a   court  hearing   for  his   next
offense, discussed below). (Answer; Tr. 88-92)
(3)  A   few   weeks  after  Offense   #   2,  in  late   December  2009,  Applicant  was
arrested  on  his home  U.S. Army  post  in State  2, and  charged  with  DUI.  (SOR ¶  1.c) He
testified  that  he  drove  a  fellow  soldier to  the  airport and  returned  to   post  in  the  friend’s
car. He had  been  drinking  earlier in the  day, and  stumbled  when  he  got out of  the  car at
the  post  gate.  (Tr. 92-94; GE  8, GE 9 at 1-19)
In  April  2010,  while  Applicant’s  offense  was  pending  in  federal  court,  a  federal
magistrate  judge  allowed  him  to  deploy  for  a  year  with  his  Army  unit  to  Qatar.  Since
alcohol use was not permitted there, Applicant could deploy and fulfill his court-ordered
abstention  requirement.  While
in  court-ordered
counseling, though he said it was not specifically “alcohol counseling.” (Tr. 82-83) (See
discussion of SOR ¶ 2.c, below)
in  Qatar,  he  also  participated
Applicant was subsequently evaluated and found to be chemically dependent on
alcohol  and  amenable  to  treatment.  (GE  5  at  2)  (This  diagnosis  is  referenced  in  a
September 2010 court order but is not itself documented in the record here). Relying on
this diagnosis, the federal magistrate authorized  Applicant’s placement into  a  five-year
deferred  prosecution  program.  Applicant  was  also  ordered  to  attend  and  successfully
complete a  two-year alcohol treatment program.  (SOR ¶ 1.d) (Answer; SOR Ex. 3;  Tr.
65-70, 95-96; GE 5 at 7, GE 8)
As part of the deferred prosecution program, Applicant was, in part, required: a)
to abstain from alcohol consumption; b) to comply with the law and not to “commit any
alcohol/drug offenses or other criminal offenses during the period of deferral;” and c) to
notify  U.S.  Probation  “within  72  hours  of  being  arrested,  questioned,  or  cited  by  law
enforcement.”  Failure  to  comply  was  potential  grounds  for  removal  from  the  deferred
prosecution  program.  (GE  5  at  8,  10)  Applicant  signed  the  judge’s  order  and  also
acknowledged the requirements of his probation. (GE 5 at 9, 10; Tr. 68-69)
Applicant  said he fulfilled the requirements of  his counseling in Qatar before he
returned to the U.S. in April 2011. (Tr. 68) He said he did not have contact with his U.S.
probation officer when he returned to this country. (Tr. 100) It is not clear that he fulfilled
the requirements of the “two-year treatment program” after he returned from Qatar.
(4)  In  September  2011,  months   after  he   returned   from   Qatar,  Applicant   was
arrested   in   State   1,  where  he   was  then   serving   in  the   Army,   and   charged   with   driving
while   intoxicated   (DWI),  2nd   Offense   within  5-10   years,  and   with   refusing   a   blood   or
breath test. In  February  2012, he  was found not guilty  on  both  counts  after a bench  trial.
(SOR  ¶   1.e)  Applicant   explained   that  he   was  stopped   by   a   police   officer  after  a   gas
station   attendant  reported   seeing   multiple   highly   intoxicated   individuals  exiting   a   red
SUV.   Applicant  said   he   was  driving   a   red   SUV  but  was  alone,  in military   uniform,  and
not intoxicated.  (Answer; GE  7 at 1-3;  Tr. 70-71, 96-100)
Applicant  acknowledged  under questioning that  he  knew and  understood at  the
time  that  he  had  been  arrested,  taken  into  custody  by  the  police,  taken  to  jail,  and
charged with DWI, even though he was later found not guilty at trial. He did not recall if
he had been drinking at the time.  (Tr. 96-100) He said he disclosed the offense to his
chain of command, but acknowledged that he did not inform his federal probation officer
of this arrest, and, in hindsight, said that he should have done so. (Tr. 71, 100, 103)
(5)  In   December  2013,  Applicant  was  arrested   on   an   Army   post   in   State   3   and
charged   with   drunk  driving.  He  had   a   blood-alcohol  content  (BAC)   of   0.187.  He
appeared  at  an  Article 15  hearing  and  was found  guilty  under Article  111  of  the  Uniform
Code  of  Military  Justice  (UCMJ) of  being  in “Physical Control of  a  Vehicle  while  Drunk.”
(SOR  ¶   1.f)  (GE  8,   GE   9   at   21-30)  Applicant  asserted   that   when   he   was  arrested,  he
had   not   been   driving,  but  was  sitting   in  his  car  listening   to   music  (with   the   key   in  the
ignition  but the  engine  off). The  day  before, he  had  returned  from  a  combat deployment
to  Afghanistan. He  chose  to  accept the   Article 15  findings rather than  request a  court-
martial,   since   he   was   soon   to   leave   the   Army   and   pursue   an   education.   (Answer)   He
received  a  general  discharge  under  honorable conditions, as noted  above. (Tr. 30;  AE
D)
Applicant acknowledged that he had been drinking prior to this arrest, and that, in
hindsight,  he  should  not  have  done  so  under  the  terms  of  his  federal  deferred
prosecution following offense # 3.  (Tr. 71-73;  GE  5 at 10)) However, he  also asserted
that he believed his chain of command and security officials were aware of the offense.
(Tr. 101-102)
In October 2015, the federal magistrate judge dismissed the deferred prosecution
of  Applicant’s  December  2009  DUI  (Offense  #  2),  on  the  grounds  that  he  had
successfully completed  the program. (GE 5) (There  is no  indication  that the  court was
aware of either Offense #4 or Offense # 5, above).
(6)  In   January   2020,  Applicant  was  arrested   in  State   1   and   charged   with   DUI,
refusing  a  breath  sample,  and  drinking  while  driving  with  an  open  container of alcohol.
In  October 2020, he  was found  guilty  of  DUI.  He received  a  90-day  suspended  jail term,
two  years  of probation  and  a  fine. The  remaining  charges were dismissed.  (SOR ¶  1.g)
(GE  7)  Applicant  said   in  his  answer  that   he   was  returning   home   from   a   family   social
event,   and   was  stopped   because   he   did   not  have   his  headlights   on.  He  had   an   open
container  of   alcohol  in   the   vehicle.  He   attended   a   court-ordered   alcohol   treatment
assessment   and   six   weeks  of  counseling.  He  also   attended   voluntary   behavioral
counseling.  (Answer;  Tr.  82)   His  probation   for  this  offense   was  scheduled   to   end   in
October 2022. (Tr. 55, 117)
(7)   During   his direct  testimony   at his   DOHA  hearing, Applicant disclosed   that  in
August  2021,  he  was  arrested   in  State   4,  where  he   now   lives,   and   charged   with   DUI.
(SOR  ¶   1.h)  Applicant   said  he   had   been   at  home   and   had   “a  couple  drinks.”  He  had
been  doing  yard work and  left  the  house  to  get a  massage  for his back. He was pulled
over  for   speeding.  In   April  2022,  he   pleaded   guilty   to   DUI  and   was  sentenced   to   one
year  of   probation.  He   was  referred   to   a   substance   abuse   counselor   for  a   12-hour
course.  At  the   time   of   his  DOHA  hearing   he   had   attended   four  or  the   required   nine
sessions.  He is  required  to  call  in  weekly  and  to  provide  urine  samples as  needed.  He
has passed  them  all and has paid  all fines and fees.  He is required  to  remain  “clean  and
sober” and to obey the law. He has a probation officer. He remains on probation for the
offense until April 2023. (Tr. 35-36, 47-51, 81-82, 121-122)
Applicant acknowledged in his testimony that he had yet to report his latest DUI
to  his  State  1 probation  officer.  He  was  unclear as  to  the  terms  of that  probation, and
was not sure he was required to report the arrest when it occurred. His most recent DUI
was adjudicated only two weeks before his DOHA hearing, and he intended to disclose
the matter to his State 1 probation officer as soon as his DOHA hearing was concluded.
(Tr. 55-57, 117-120)
Applicant  was  sober  for  about  six  years  while  attending  college  after  the  Army
and  afterwards.  He  did  well  in  schoo  and  was  happier.  He  later  resumed  drinking,
believing he was mature and responsible enough to do so. (Tr. 84-85)
Applicant said he does not believe he has ever been diagnosed with alcoholism
or  alcohol  dependence  by  a  professional  counselor,  assessor,  or
treatment
professional.  (Tr.  111-112)  However,  the  federal  magistrate’s  2010  order  placing  him
into  the  deferred  prosecution  program  addresses  the  fact  that  Applicant  was  found
chemically  dependent  on  alcohol  in  an  assessment.  (GE  5)  That  assessment  is  not
alleged in the SOR, so I will not consider it as disqualifying conduct.
When  he  was  married,  Applicant  attended  counseling  through  the  VA  at  the
urging of  his wife, in about 2014, after he was  discharged from  the  Army.  He solicited
the VA for an assessment of his PTSD and was referred to a counselor. He also saw a
counselor twice in the summer of 2018. He has not been in treatment or counseling for
his  PTSD  since  then.  Applicant  acknowledged  a  “linkage”  between  his  alcohol  issues
and  his  PTSD,  noting  that  his  December  2009  DUIs  and  his  2013  DUI  all  occurred
shortly after he returned from deployments. (Tr. 75-79)
Following  his  2020  DUI,  Applicant  attended  voluntary  substance  abuse
counseling  with  Ms.  W  between  about  January  and  March  2021.  He  successfully
completed the program, which included five behavioral health education and counseling
sessions over six weeks. Further treatment was not recommended. (Tr. 56-61; SOR Ex.
1; AE A) (Applicant’s most recent DUI occurred five months later).
Applicant said he attempted sobriety after his 2020 arrest, but it was not until his
most  recent  arrest  that  he  “really  sat  down  and  talked  with  my  family  and  became
honest  with myself.  Everything  states that  I  have  an  addiction” to  alcohol. He believes
that  without  alcohol, he  would  have  had more  success  in  the military.  He  gets  a  lot of
support from his family and his girlfriend. He said this latest incident led to an “epiphany”
and he realized that he is battling addiction and alcoholism.  He said he has not had a
drink  since  his  latest  DUI,  in  August  2021.  He  sought  out  on-line  AA  meetings  soon
thereafter, including some with military veterans. He attends AA meetings several times
a  week.  This  is  voluntary and  not  court  ordered.  He  has  deep  regrets  that  his  alcohol
issues ended his Army career. He described  alcohol as “my  Achilles heel.” (Tr. 34-41,
80-86, 120-121)
Applicant  acknowledged  his  history of  alcohol  use  but  asserted  that  it  does  not
define who he is. He has excelled at many things, including in the Army, in leadership
courses as a  distinguished  graduate,  and  in  earning  a  bachelor’s degree  and  an  MBA
with honors and excellent grades. He is a hardworking, trusted employee with excellent
references  and  evaluations.  He  loves  his  job  and  values  the  opportunity  to  serve  the
military. He is now more accepting of his alcohol issues and continues to deal with his
service-connected  PTSD.  He  does  not  believe  he  is  a  risk  and  wants  to  continue  to
serve. (Tr. 44-47)
Guideline E
In  2012,  following  Applicant’s  first  four  offenses  above,  the  Army  CAF  granted
him  a  conditional clearance. The  CAF noted that  “failure to  successfully complete  your
probation  requirements  or  other  subsequent  unfavorable  information  may  result  in  the
suspension  of  your  clearance.”  The  CAF  noted  that,  at  the  time,  Applicant  was  in  the
five-year deferred prosecution program, following his second December 2009 DUI, GE
4 at 32)
In  SOR  ¶  2.e,  the  Government  alleged  that  Applicant’s  December  2013  DUI
arrest (Offense # 5) constituted a violation of both his federal probation and the terms of
his conditional clearance. Applicant denied SOR ¶ 2.e and asserted that his conduct did
not  violate  any  probation  requirements.  (Answer)  He  also  testified  that  DOD  took  no
action to revoke or suspend his conditional clearance following his arrests in either 2011
or  2013.  (Tr.  102-104)  During  closing  argument,  Department  Counsel  conceded  that
there  was  no  documentary  evidence  to  support  a  finding  that  SOR  ¶  2.e  was
established. Specifically, there was no record evidence that the federal magistrate judge
had ruled that Applicant had violated his probation following his December 2009 arrest.
Nor  was  there  evidence  to  show  that  the  DOD  CAF  had  ever  acted  upon  Applicant’s
2013 DUI offense (at least as to his 2012 conditional clearance). (Tr. 151-152)
Applicant first submitted an SCA in 2006, when he joined the Army. He disclosed
his December 2004 DUI arrest in detail. (GE 2 at 19-23; Tr. 73-75)
When  Applicant  submitted  his  December  2019  SCA,  he  disclosed  some  of  his
DUI  arrests,  but  not  all  of  them.  He  disclosed  offense  #s  1,  2,  and  5,  above,  but  not
offense #s 3 or 4 (GE 1 at 32-36). The Government alleged that these omissions were
deliberate falsifications, an allegation he denied. (SOR ¶ 2.a)
As  to  SOR  ¶  2.b,  the  SCA  question  at  issue  asks,  “Have  you  EVER  been
charged  with  an  offense  involving  alcohol or  drugs?”  Applicant  asserted  in his Answer
that  he  interpreted  the  question  as  requiring  disclosure  of  offenses  of  which  he  had
been  “convicted” rather than  “charged.” (Answer)  He testified that he also did not have
the proper paperwork with him when he completed the SCA. He  said he was confused
about whether he should report the second December 2009 offense (Offense # 3), since
it led to a deferred prosecution. He also said he paid for an online criminal background
check and it was not listed. (Tr. 106) He said he did not intend to hide anything from the
Government,  and  acknowledged  that his various offenses “tend  to  blend  together.”  He
knew,  however,  that  he  had  been  arrested  in  December  2009  on  a  federal  military
installation and appeared in federal court.  As to Offense # 4, he also asserted that he
did  not  have  to  list  the  2011  DUI  charge  in  State  1  since  he  was  found  not  guilty.  He
also said he regarded Offense # 3 in a similar fashion since he was placed in a deferred
prosecution program, and the charge was later dismissed. (Tr. 41-43, 64-65, 105-09)
Applicant  also  allegedly  failed  to  disclose  on  his  SCA  both  that  he  had  been
ordered  to  seek  counseling  or  treatment  as a  result  of  his  use  of  alcohol,  and  that  he
had  received  such  counseling  or  treatment,  as  ordered  by  the  federal  magistrate  in
September 2010. (GE 1 at 37; SOR ¶ 2.c) Applicant denied the allegation of deliberate
falsification.  He  said  he  had  monthly  monitoring  sessions  while  he  was  in  Qatar  (an
alcohol-free  country)  but  did  not  consider  that  to  be  sufficiently  related  to  alcohol
“counseling”  or  “treatment”  to  be  considered  reportable  within  the  context  of  the
question on his SCA. (Answer; Tr. 83-84, 109-111)
Even  so,  the  federal  magistrate’s  September  2010  order  states  that  Applicant
“shall  enroll
treatment  program”
recommended by the behavioral treatment agency evaluators who diagnosed Applicant
as having a chemical dependency on alcohol. (GE 5 at 7)

the
In  his  February  2020  interview,  Applicant  discussed  his  2004  charges,  his  first
December 2009 DUI arrest, by civilian authorities in State 2, and his 2013 DUI arrest on
the  Army  post  in  State  3  at  length.  (GE  3)  At  the  start  of  his  March  2020  interview,
Applicant was confronted with evidence of his second December 2009 DUI in State 2,
as well as evidence of his January 2020 DUI in State 1, which he failed to mention in his
first interview, in February 2020. (GE 3) In November 2020, Applicant authenticated and
adopted the summaries of both interviews without comment. (GE 3 at 14)
SOR  ¶  2.d  alleged  that  Applicant  deliberately  withheld  information  from  the
interviewer,  in  both  interviews,  about  the  fact  of  his  second  December  2009  DUI.  As
above,  he  continued  to  assert  that  he  had  not  been  convicted  in  the  latter  incident.
(Answer)  Applicant  acknowledged  that  the  interviewing  agent  confronted  him  with
evidence of the December 2009 DUI before he disclosed it. (Tr. 113-116)
Applicant also  did  not disclose  in  those  background  interviews that  he  had  been
arrested   for   DUI in   January   2020,   only   weeks before.   He   asserted  that   he  “didn’t think
about it. I  was just  being  reactionary  with  her. She  asked  the  question,  I answered  the
question.” He acknowledged  that,   in hindsight,  he  should have  been  more candid. (Tr.
61-64,  116) Deliberate   lack of candor in  Applicant’s February   2020   interview   about   his
January 2020 DUI was not alleged as part of  SOR ¶ 2.d.
Applicant’s  girlfriend  is trained  as  a  nurse.  She  testified  that  she  is  aware  of  all
aspects of his alcohol issues. He has been “very open” with her about them. He has not
had  a  drink  since  his  most  recent  DUI,  in  August  2021.  She  was  disappointed  and
shocked after that incident. She believes he made a mistake. He attends AA regularly,
several times a week, often twice a day. He is passionate about the meetings and they
are helpful to him. She believes he will continue with his sobriety long term. She does
not drink and they have no alcohol in their home. She believes his most recent DUI was
“the last straw” and that he “has his life in a new direction.” (Tr. 124-131)
Applicant’s witness, Mr. W, retired from the Army in early 2019 as a colonel (O-6)
after  30  years  on  active  duty.  He  has  had  a  clearance  for  many  years.  He  first  met
Applicant in 2012, when Mr. W. was Applicant’s battalion commander. Applicant served
as  a  supply  sergeant  and  they  worked  together  for  two  years.  Mr.  W  wrote
recommendation letters for Applicant for graduate school and followed his career. Now
employed by a defense contractor, Mr. W  hired Applicant  for his current job two years
ago. Applicant interfaces with two-star commands and is trusted to do so. Applicant has
integrity, honesty, an excellent work ethic and is  “mission-focused.” Mr. W.  is aware of
the  SOR  allegations  in  the  case.  (Tr.  131-144;  SOR  Ex.  4)  Mr.  W’s  evidence
corroborates Applicant’s recent performance evaluations. (AE F, AE G)
