Applicant is a 61-year-old employee of a government contractor for whom he has
worked since June 2018. He has a high school diploma and took some college courses
but did not earn a college degree. He was divorced once and has been remarried since
1997.  He  has two  adult  children  and  two  adult  stepchildren.  He  served  on  active  duty
with  the  U.S.  Army  from  1984  until  2003,  when  he  received  an  honorable  discharge.
During  his  military  service,  he  was  deployed  to  active  combat  zones  three  times.  (Tr.
24-30; GE 1, 2)
In  the  SOR,  the  Government  alleged  Applicant’s  five  delinquent  debts  totaling
approximately $26,000. These delinquencies consisted of a credit card, personal loans,
and  telecommunications  debts.  Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations  with
additional comment, with the exception of SOR ¶ 1.c. He denied this debt and claimed
that it was a duplicate of another debt alleged in the SOR. His admissions are adopted
as findings of fact. (Answer; GE 1-7)
Applicant  attributed  his  financial  issues  to  his  employer’s  loss  of  a  government
contract in May 2017 that saw his salary reduced from $80,000 to $35,000, annually. As
a  result  of  his  drop  in  income,  he  could  not  afford  to  pay  all  of  his  creditors  and  he
defaulted  on  some  of  his  financial  obligations.  He  began  working  for  his  current
employer in June 2018, and earned about $50,000 annually. At the time of the hearing,
he earned between $51,000 and $52,000, annually. He takes home about $1,700 every
two weeks. He also earns $1,200 per month form his military retirement. His wife earns
about  $23,000  to  $24,000,  annually.  He  claimed  that  once  he  obtained  his  current
employment, he  earned  a  sufficient  income  to  begin  resolving his  delinquent debts.  In
August 2019, he hired a law firm to help him resolve his delinquencies. He claimed that
he paid this law firm $6,000 in monthly installments and that they owe him money back
because  he  paid  the  debt  listed  in  SOR  ¶  1.b  without  the  law  firm’s  assistance.  He
claimed that he began resolving his financial delinquencies prior to being evaluated for
a clearance. (Tr. 22-23, 30-34, 39, 46-47; Answer; AE A-I; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  has no  written  budget  that he follows.  He  has  about $800  left over at
the end of each month after paying his bills that he puts into savings in order to pay off
his creditors through the aforementioned law firm. He has about $4,000 in savings, but
does  not  have  a  retirement  account.  He  claims  he  is  working  very  hard  to  pay  his
delinquent debts. However, this year, he bought a 2022 truck for about $70,000 and a
2022 motorcycle  for about $30,000.1  He  claimed that he purchased  the truck because
he was having mechanical issues with his old vehicle, and he purchased the motorcycle
because it gets good gas mileage. He pays $1,000 per month on the truck and $600 per
month for the motorcycle. (Tr. 42-44, 50-54)
1  Any adverse information not alleged in the SOR, such as Applicant’s   spending on motor vehicles or any
additional delinquent accounts, cannot be used for disqualification purposes. It may be considered when
assessing the application of mitigating conditions and for the whole-person analysis.
The $14,357 credit card alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a  has not been resolved. Applicant
opened  this  account  in  2015  to  make  upgrades  on  his  home  and  to  pay  for  living
expenses. The last payment he made on this account was in November 2017. He had a
civil court hearing related to this account scheduled for November 2, 2022. He said that
after  this  date,  he  will  have  a  better  understanding  as  to  how  to  resolve  this  account.
One  of  the  options  he  is  considering  to  resolve  this  account  is  to  allow  the  statute  of
limitations  to  run  on  it.  He  also  may  resolve  it  through  payments.  He  is  allowing  the
creditor’s  collection  actions  to  inform  him  how  or  whether  to  resolve  this  account.  (Tr.
34-39; Answer; GE 2, 3, 4, 6, 7; AE A, B, G, I)
The  $6,121  credit  card  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.b  has  been  resolved.  This  account
became delinquent in 2017, when Applicant suffered a reduction in income. The credit
consolidation company helped him resolve this debt  through a wage garnishment. The
account was settled no later than October 2021. (Tr. 39-41, 47-52; Answer; GE 1-6; AE
A, B, D, G)
The $5,869 credit card alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c has not been established. This debt
was held by the same creditor as the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b with a similar balance. The only
credit  report  showing  two  delinquent  accounts  to  this  creditor  listed  Applicant’s
collections accounts twice. No other credit report in evidence shows that Applicant has
two  accounts  with  this  creditor.  Throughout  the  investigation  process,  Applicant  has
maintained  that  he  only  had  one  delinquent  account  with  this  creditor.  Based  on  the
foregoing, I find that the debt listed in SOR ¶ 1.c is a duplicate of the debt described in
SOR ¶ 1.b. (Tr. 41, 47-49; Answer; GE 1-6; AE A, B, D, G)
The $520 telecommunications debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d has not been resolved.
Applicant claimed that he would eventually settle this debt, but is waiting  until after he
resolves his other, larger delinquent debts. (Tr. 41, 52-54; Answer; GE 2, 3, 5; AE G)
The $90 telecommunications debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e has been resolved. This
account  became delinquent  when Applicant switched  cell phone providers and did not
pay  the  full  balance  on  his  former  provider’s  account.  He  settled  this  account  through
payment no later than September 2021. (Tr. 41; Answer; GE 2-6; AE F, G)
Applicant  settled  a  delinquent  debt  not  alleged  in  the  SOR  for  $2,000  no  later
than  December  2019.  He  has  an  additional  delinquent  debt  not  listed  in  the  SOR  for
about $6,700 that is the subject of a civil lawsuit. (GE 7; AE B, I)
Applicant  called  his  supervisor  as  a  witness.  His  supervisor  is  a facility  security
officer  and  a  security  manager  for  the  government  contractor  where  they  both  work.
Applicant’s  supervisor  interacts  with  Applicant  regularly  and  he  believes  Applicant  is
honest, trusts Applicant's judgment, and believes that Applicant should have a security
clearance. (Tr. 58-61)
