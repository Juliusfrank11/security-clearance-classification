There  are  19  delinquent  accounts  alleged  in  the  January  2021  SOR.  All  the
accounts except for SOR ¶ 1.m are credit card or credit accounts. The total amount of
debt  is  about  $26,000.  The  debts  became  delinquent  between  June  2015  and
November 2019. Applicant admitted that he owed the debts, and the Government credit
bureau reports confirm his admission. (GE 3, 4, 5, 7; Answer to SOR; Tr. 32)
Applicant is 32 years old. He earned some community college credits between
September 2008 and January 2012. From March 2013 to September 2013, he received
training  in  electronics  while  in  United  States  Navy  Reserve  (USNR).  He  has  been
married since February 2015 and has three stepchildren, 26, 23, and 14 years of age.
The 23-year-old still lives with Applicant and his wife. (GE 1 at 12; Tr. 30)
Since  February  2017,  Applicant  has  been  employed  by  a  defense  contractor.
Before his current employment, he worked at a national discount store and a pet store.
He  has  been  in  the  USNR  since  January  2013,  where  he  received  advanced  training
that qualified him for his current position. Applicant has held a security clearance since
November 2015. (GE 1 at 13-21, 37; Tr. 28)
Applicant  indicated  that  his  wife  became  seriously ill  in  July 2015.  The  illness
caused  several  of  her  internal  organs  to  stop  working.  She  was  hospitalized  for  four
weeks in July 2015, followed by various stages of care and recovery until October 2015.
Since  she  had  to  stop  working,  the  household  went  from  two  incomes  to  one,  with
Applicant shouldering all the financial responsibility. He was unable to keep abreast of
the bills. His wife still has some of the same lingering medical problems that her mother
suffered from and died recently. (GE 3, 4, 5, 7; Tr. 7, 32-34)
According  to  his  April  2020  PSI,  before  his wife  became  ill  in  2015,  Applicant
claimed  that  he  paid  his  bills  on  time.  In  November  2016,  the  last  time  Applicant
attempted to  address  the  listed  creditors,  a bankruptcy firm advised  him  that  they had
received  his  final  payment  to  allow  them  to  file  a  bankruptcy  petition.  After  he  began
working  for  his  current  employer  in  February  2017,  he  had  to  discontinue  the  petition
because  he  was  earning  too  much  income.  He  also  claimed  he  was  monitoring  his
financial obligations and discussing different payment options with the creditors.  At the
hearing,  he  testified  that  he  never  contacted  any  of  the  creditors.  He  was  unable  to
explain what the listed debts represented except for SOR ¶ 1.m, a utility. Regarding his
attitude  about  repaying  the  past-due  debts,  Applicant  testified,  “A  lot  of  these
[delinquent  debts]  are  from  a  long  time  ago.  I  don’t  remember.  I  was  trying  to  put  the
past of negativity behind me.” (GE 2 at 2-3; Tr. 35, 50; AE D)
SOR ¶  1.a  became  delinquent in  August  2015. (GE  4  at  2) SOR ¶  1.b  became
delinquent   in   February   2016.   (AE   E   at   32)   SOR  ¶   1.c   became   delinquent   in  October
2015. (GE 4  at 2) SOR ¶ 1.d  switched to a delinquent status in August 2015. (GE 4  at 2)
SOR  ¶   1.e   became   delinquent   in   June   2015.  (GE   5   at   1)  SOR  ¶   1.f  transitioned   to   a
delinquent   status   in   February   2017.   (GE   5   at  3)  SOR   ¶   1g   became   delinquent   in
September 2015.  (GE 5  at 2) SOR  ¶  1.h  became  delinquent  in  August 2015. (GE 4 at 3)
SOR ¶  1.i became  delinquent in September 2015. (GE 5  at 2) SOR ¶  1.j became  past
due  in  August 2015. (GE 5  at 2) SOR ¶  1.k  became  delinquent in  February  2016. (GE  5
at 2) SOR ¶ 1.l became past due in November 2019. (GE 5  at 2)
SOR  ¶  1.m  became  overdue  in  July  2017.  (GE  4  at  4)  SOR  1.n  cannot  be
independently  verified  and  is  withdrawn.  SOR  ¶  1.o  became  delinquent  in  May  2016.
(GE 4 at 4) SOR ¶ 1.r became delinquent in April 2019. (GE 3 at 7) SOR ¶ 1.s became
delinquent in March 2017. (GE 3 at 10)
Concerning  the  issue  of  changes  Applicant  and  his  wife  have  made  to  avoid
similar financial problems from reappearing in the future, he pointed to a change in his
“mindset.”  (Tr.  48)  When  the  debts  became  delinquent  back  in  2015,  Applicant  was
inexperienced in managing finances. He believed that his budget skills have improved,
redirecting his focus on family needs and not wants. He explained that his budget is not
in  writing,  but  a  verbal  agreement  between  Applicant  and  his  wife  that  encourages
ongoing discussions about his income and expenditures. He has a full-time career that
pays all the bills, rather than part-time employment. Even with the financial help from his
23-year-old  son  and  his  mother,  who  moved  into  his  residence  in  2019,  he  has  not
begun  addressing  the  delinquent  debts  because  he  does  not  earn  enough  money.
Applicant  has  never  participated  in  financial  counseling,  but  has  read  books  on  the
subject. (Tr. 45-50, 54)
