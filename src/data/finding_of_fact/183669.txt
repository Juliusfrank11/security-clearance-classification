In his answer, Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 3.a, and denied SOR ¶¶ 1.b,
and  2.b-2.e.  He  included  a  short  explanation  for  each  allegation.  His  admissions  and
explanations  are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  review  of  the  pleadings,
testimony, and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  36  years  old.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2015,  and  is  now
attending school to obtain a master’s degree. He was married in 2009, but he and his wife
have been separated since 2020. They were also separated from about 2017-2019. He
has two minor children. He served on active duty in the Air Force from 2008-2012, in the
Air Force Reserve from 2013-2014, and in the Air National Guard from 2014-2019. He
received an honorable discharge. He currently works as a victim notifications specialist
for a government contractor. (Tr. 21-26; GE 1)
On his 2008 SCA, Applicant reported that he used marijuana about 20 times from
January 2004  –  September  2007.  He  stated  that  he  used  it  recreationally  with  friends
before  entering  the  military.  In  his  September  2008  background  interview  with  a
government investigator, he stated that the usage number that he reported was just an
estimate, and the actual number could be double. He stated that he had no intent to use
marijuana again. (Tr. 27-36, 46; GE 3, 4)
On his 2013 SCA, Applicant did not report any illegal drug use in the last seven
years.  This  period  covered  March  2006  to  March  2013,  which  includes  some  of  the
marijuana use he reported on his 2008 SCA. In his April 2013 background interview, he
was  confronted  about  his  earlier  marijuana  use,  and  stated  he  had  no  intent  to  use
marijuana again. He testified that he did not intend to hide his marijuana use, and that he
wanted to explain the situation on the SCA, but failed to do so. (Tr. 36-46; GE 2, 4)
In  2015,  Applicant  applied  for  a  job  that  required  him  to  possess  a  security
clearance. The job also required a pre-employment drug screening as a condition of being
hired.  On  June  16,  2015,  the  employer  submitted  an  incident  report  through  the  Joint
Personnel Adjudication  System  (JPAS), which  stated  that  the  testing lab  notified  them
that  Applicant  tested  positive  for  one  of  the  eight  prohibited  substances,  and  that  in  a
prescreening interview,  he  stated  that  he  had  not  used  illegal  drugs  in  the past  seven
years. The DoD CAF issued him an SOR for the positive urinalysis. In his 2016 answer,
he stated that he does not understand how his urine tested positive for marijuana, and
that the testing office would not give him or the employer any information. He  asserted
that he believed his urine was contaminated at the testing facility through the process that
they used. He provided  no evidence supporting this assertion. In June 2016, the DOD
CAF rejected this explanation, and temporarily revoked his security clearance. In his July
2020 background interview, he stated that this must have been a false positive result. At
the hearing, he testified that he does not know how his urine tested positive for marijuana,
and that he had not used it at that time. (Tr. 27-46; GE 4, 5, 7, 8; AE C-D)
The record shows that on June 16, 2015, the testing lab contacted the employer
so  that  they  could  speak  with  Applicant  about  the  result.  The  employer  provided  the
testing lab with his contact information, and asked him to call the confidential line for the
lab. Not only did Applicant have the opportunity to get information from the testing lab,
they offered to discuss the results with him. Six days later, he emailed the employer and
stated that he ate a protein bar with hemp seeds or oil in it, and that it must have caused
him to test positive for marijuana. At the hearing, he did not mention the hemp protein bar
in his testimony, and there was no assertion about it in his 2020 background interview.
(Tr. 27-46; GE 4, 5, 7, 8; AE C-D)
On  his  2020  SCA,  Applicant  did  not  report any  marijuana  use  in  the  last  seven
years, or use while possessing a clearance. In his July 2020 background interview, he
reported  that he  used marijuana,  while  possessing a  security clearance, from  October
2017 – February 2018. He stated that he purchased it from a friend, and used marijuana
about 8 times. He reported that he was depressed at the time. He stated that he has no
intent  to  use  marijuana  again.  He  reported  that  he  did  not  list  this  usage  on  his  SCA
because he was scared that he would not get the clearance. At the hearing, he testified
that  he  did  not  recall  ever  saying  that.  However,  when  reminded  that  he  verified  the
accuracy of this interview in March 2021, he stated that he did not correct this statement
because of an oversight. He testified that he used marijuana in 2017 because alcohol did
not  suffice  to  deal  with  his  pain,  and  he  was  health  conscious.  He  stated  that  the
marijuana got him through it. He also stated that he could not remember how he obtained
the marijuana, and tried to evade answering the question. He admitted that he knew that
using marijuana with a security clearance was prohibited. He reported that he stopped
using  it  because  he  was  trying  to  get  his  life  back  on  track.  He  stated  that  he  had
counseling for issues relating to his marriage separation, and that his marijuana use was
discussed at the counseling. (Tr.27-36, 47-76: GE 1, 4)
In his March 2021 response to interrogatories, Applicant reported using marijuana
from September 27, 2017 to October 2, 2017, about every other day. At the hearing, he
was asked about the discrepancy in dates from the marijuana use he reported in his July
2020 background interview and his March 2021 interrogatory response. He stated that he
just  gave  an  estimate,  and  that  he  cannot  recall  the  timeframe.  He  said  that  he  was
depressed during this period, and used marijuana over four or five months. He also did
not report his first period of marijuana use  in the interrogatory response, despite being
asked if he “ever used any federally illegal drugs….” He claimed that he thought that he
was just being asked about the last seven years. (Tr. 45, 63-69; GE 4)
Applicant’s  credit  reports  show  a  charged-off  credit-card  account  for  about
$16,000. He asserted that it became delinquent after losing his job in 2019. This debt was
resolved in October 2020 through a settlement agreement with the creditor. (Tr. 50-54;
GE 9-11, 14; AE A, B)
The SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant used marijuana from January
2004 to February 2018, including while possessing a security clearance, and that his job
offer was rescinded in 2015 for failing a urinalysis. The SOR alleges under Guideline E
that he falsified his 2013 SCA and 2020 SCA for failing to disclose marijuana use, and
falsified his 2021 interrogatory response for failing to disclose all his marijuana use. The
SOR alleges under Guideline F that he is indebted on a charged-off credit card for about
$16,000.
