SOR ¶  1.a  alleged  that Applicant  illegally  used  nitrous  oxide  between  June  2014
and   January   2020,  and   that  he   intended   to   continue   using   it  in  the   future.  In   his  SOR
answer, Applicant  admitted  the  use,  but denied  his intent to  use  it in  the  future. SOR  ¶
1.b   alleged,   and   Applicant   admitted,   that  he   used   marijuana   from   June   1999   to   about
June   2018.  SOR  ¶   1.c  alleged,  and   Applicant  admitted,   that  he   used   MDMA   (3,   4-
methylenedioxy-methamphetamine   –   Ecstasy/Molly)   in  June   2018.   SOR  ¶   1.d   alleged
that Applicant used  amyl nitrate  (poppers)  between  June  2013  and  June  2017, and  that
he   intended   to   continue   using   “poppers”   in  the   future.  In   his  SOR  answer,  Applicant
admitted the use, but denied his intent to  use it in the  future.
Applicant’s SOR admissions are incorporated as findings of fact. After a thorough
review of the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is 41 years old. He received a bachelor’s degree in 2004. He married in
2007 and divorced in 2013. He has no children. He has been living with a cohabitant since
2018. Applicant has been working for his clearance sponsor, a federal contractor, since
September 2019. This is his first security clearance application (SCA).
In  Section  23  (Illegal  Use  of  Drugs  or  Drug  Activity)  of  his  March  2020  SCA,
Applicant disclosed that he experimented with marijuana in 1999, and then used it with
varying  frequency  between  2014  and  2018.  He  purchased  the  marijuana  from  state
licensed  dispensaries  to  self-medicate  anxiety  and  focus  issues,  no  more  than  two  to
three times per year, the latest use in 2018. He used amyl nitrate (and similar formulations
of inhalants; poppers) six to eight times a year between 2013 and 2017. He noted he had
not used poppers for several years, but stated his intent to do so in the future.
Applicant  disclosed  he  used  nitrous  oxide  three  to  five  times  per  year  between
2014 and 2020, at social gatherings and for recreational purposes. He stated his intent to
use nitrous oxide in the future. He used MDMA (molly) once in June 2018. He does not
intend to use it in the future. (Item 4)
During his 2020 interviews, government investigators questioned Applicant about
his  illegal  use  of  drugs.  (Item  5)  Applicant  confirmed  his  drug  use  as  disclosed  in  his
March 2020 SCA, but indicated he no longer intended to continue using illegal drugs in
the future, except for nitrous oxide, which he intended to use again, but not regularly. He
admitted to socializing with individuals who use illegal drugs at least twice a year.
Applicant  noted  that  if  he  were  assigned  to  a  position  where  the  use  of  nitrous
oxide  was  prohibited,  he  would  not  use  it.  He  claimed  he  is  now  focused  on  his
professional life and has chosen to settle down his social life, which is why he is no longer
using illegal drugs. He  presented no  documentary evidence to show that he sought or
received any medical or psychological treatment or counseling for substance abuse. He
has never participated in any drug counseling, treatment, or education.
