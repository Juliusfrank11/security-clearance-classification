Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. He is 41 years old, married, and has
two minor children. He earned an associate degree in 2009 and a bachelor’s degree in
2012. As of his November 2016 security clearance application (SCA), he owned his home
since August 2014. (Supp Answer; Tr. at 20-22, 62-63, 67-71; GE 1)
Applicant served honorably in the U.S. military from 2002 until he medically retired
in 2007. He has since worked for various DOD contractors, with the exception of when
he  worked  for  a  U.S.  Government  Agency  from  August  2014  to  July  2015.  He  was
unemployed from September 2010 to March 2011, July 2011 to October 2011, and July
2015 to November 2015. As of the date of the hearing, he was a software test engineer
for his employer since March 2019. He was initially granted a security clearance in 2003.
(Tr. at 6-7, 20-23, 54-63, 98-100, 102; GE 1)
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  had  five  delinquent  consumer  debts  totaling
approximately $30,160  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  - 1.e).  It also  alleged  that  he had  two  judgments,
entered against him by his homeowners association (HOA) in 2016 and 2019, for $5,425
and  $4,503,  respectively  (SOR  ¶¶  1.f  - 1.g).  The  SOR  allegations  are  established  by
Applicant’s admissions in his Answer, his SCA, credit bureau reports from 2018 and 2020,
and court records. SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e are reported on the 2018 credit bureau
report.  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.d  are  reported  on  the  2020  credit  bureau  report.  (Supp
Answer; GE 1-6)
Applicant  attributed  his  delinquent  debts  to a  period  beginning  in  approximately
March 2014. His then-employer, a DOD contractor for whom he had been working since
July  2013,  placed  him  in  a  non-billable  status  and  he  was  uncompensated  for
approximately  15  to  45  days.  His  four-month  period  of  unemployment  in  2015  further
exacerbated his situation. (Tr. at 32-35, 60-62, 100, 102-103; GE 1)
Applicant believed that the SOR debts had been resolved by their  removal from
his credit report due to the statute of limitations. After receiving the SOR, he realized that
his belief was erroneous. He was unable to reach the SOR creditors when he attempted
to do so after he received the SOR, to which he attributed the expiration of the statute of
limitations. In May 2022, he began working with a nonprofit credit counseling organization.
He  learned  from  the  credit  counseling  organization  that  he  could  still  resolve  his
outstanding debts, even though they were no longer reported on his credit bureau reports.
He contracted with the credit counseling organization, at $989 monthly for 36 months, to
locate his creditors and resolve his outstanding debts. He made three monthly payments
to the credit counseling organization, from June 2022 to August 2022, and he intended to
continue making the monthly payments in accordance with his contract. As of the date of
the hearing, he paid SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g, and he was working with the credit
counseling organization to resolve SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b. (Tr. at 24-30, 35-38, 41-42, 45,
47-48, 51, 65-72, 83-87, 95-98, 103; AE A, B, J)
SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b are two charged-off auto accounts, for $13,092 and $12,002,
respectively. Applicant financed the car in SOR ¶ 1.a for approximately $16,000, and the
car in SOR ¶ 1.b for approximately $14,000,  in around 2012. After he could no longer
afford to pay his monthly car payments, he reached out only to the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.b
and  unsuccessfully  attempted  to  negotiate  a  reduced  payment.  Both  of  the  cars  were
repossessed in around 2014. He could not recall whether either creditor notified him of
an outstanding balance after repossession, or whether he made any payments to either
creditor between 2014 and May 2022, when the credit counseling organization made its
first  payments  to  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b  on  his  behalf.  Prior  to  working  with  the  credit
counseling organization, he believed that he did not have any further obligation once the
creditors for both  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b  repossessed  the  cars. As previously stated,  he
intends  to  continue  working  with  the  credit  counseling  organization  to  resolve  both  of
these debts. (Supp Answer; Tr. at 31-38, 72-84; AE A, B)
SOR  ¶ 1.c  is for a  $1,145 television  and  internet  services  account in  collection.
Applicant returned the equipment when he switched providers in approximately 2019 or
2020, but the company did not have a record of him doing so. He disputed the debt with
the company, and he was unaware that the company billed him for it until he reviewed a
copy of his credit bureau report in 2021. He paid this debt in April 2021. (Supp Answer;
Tr. at 37-41, 82-84; AE C, I)
SOR ¶ 1.d is for a $419 charged-off credit card. Applicant believed he previously
resolved  this  debt.  He  learned  it  was  outstanding  when  he  received  the  SOR.  He
attempted to make payments toward this debt  between approximately 2021 and 2022,
and he paid it in June 2022. (Supp Answer; Tr. at 41-44, 84-87; AE D, E)
SOR ¶ 1.e is for a $3,502 charged-off credit card. Applicant contacted the creditor
in  2022  and  learned  that  the  creditor  issued  an  IRS  Form  1099-C in  December  2017,
which  cancelled  this  debt.  He  provided  documentation  to  corroborate  his  claim.  (Supp
Answer; Tr. at 44-48, 87-88, 92-93; AE F)
SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.g are for two judgments entered against Applicant by his HOA,
in October 2016 for $5,425 and in July 2019 for $3,852. When Applicant refinanced his
mortgage,  he  mistakenly  believed  that  money  was  automatically  set  aside  from  his
mortgage payments and applied to his HOA dues. He later learned that he had to pay his
HOA dues separately by check. His HOA dues accrued as he attempted to work with the
mortgage company to resolve his outstanding HOA dues, culminating in both judgments.
He negotiated a consolidation of both judgments, and made a payment of $914 in April
2021  and  a  payment  of  $1,829  for  June  and  July  2021.  He  took  out  a  loan  of
approximately  $12,000  loan  to  settle  his  remaining  outstanding  HOA  dues  through
September 2021, and was repaying this loan through the credit counseling organization.
The  judgments  in SOR  ¶¶ 1.f  and 1.g  were  released  in October 2021.  Since  then, his
HOA moved to an online system and he has timely paid his HOA dues of $110 monthly
through automatic deductions from his bank account. He was current on his HOA dues
as of the date of the hearing. (Supp Answer; Tr. at 48-52, 88-90, 99-100; GE 4, 5; AE A,
G, I, J)
Since  March 2019  and  through  the  date  of  the  hearing, Applicant earned  $125,000
annually. His  monthly   net income  was $5,200  and  his spouse’s was $3,000.  Since  his
medical retirement,  he  also received  $1,100  monthly  for his  50% disability  rating  from  the
U.S. Department  of Veterans  Affairs. He received  credit counseling  in May  2022  from  the
credit  counseling   organization,  through   which  he   also  developed   a   budget.  He   was
current on  his financial  obligations,  which included  his mortgage; car payment for  a  car
he  financed  in August 2020; a  $14,000  home  improvement loan;  and  the  $12,000  loan
that he  obtained  to  resolve  his outstanding  HOA  dues. His student loans of  approximately
$40,000  were in forbearance  until approximately  August 2022.  He  had  savings allotted  in
his budget  with  the  credit counseling  organization  to  pay  his student loans monthly  once
out of  forbearance. (Tr.  at 20-27, 30-31, 51-55, 62-65, 74,  88-95,  98-100,  103-104; GE  6;
AE A, H, I, J)
Applicant continued to monitor his credit. He learned to stay diligent and proactive
in  resolving  his  financial  issues  before  they  become  exacerbated.  He  timely  filed  his
federal and state income tax returns. A $595 state tax lien entered against him in August
2017  was  released  in  December  2018.  Although  he  could  not  recall  why  the  lien  was
entered against him, he paid it as soon as he learned about it. His May 2022 credit bureau
report reflects that he does not have any other delinquent debts. Character letters from
three  individuals,  including  two  lifelong  friends  of  whom  one  previously  served  with
Applicant in the U.S. military, all attested to his reliability, trustworthiness, and dedication.
(Tr. at 20-27, 30-31, 51-55, 62-65, 74, 88-95, 98-100, 103-104; GE 6; AE A, H, I, J)
