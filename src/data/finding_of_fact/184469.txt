Applicant is a 57-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since  about 1997. He seeks to retain a security clearance, which
he has held for more than 26 years. He has a bachelor’s degree earned in 1988. He is
married,  with  a  college-age  child  and  two  minor  children.  (Tr.  at  28-30;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 1)
The  SOR  alleges  three  unpaid  judgments  totaling  about  $129,810  and  three
delinquent  debts  totaling  about  $55,850.  However,  Applicant  was  only  an  authorized
user of the $21,370 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b and not legally responsible for the debt.
The remaining debts and judgments are established through credit reports, Applicant’s
admissions, and documents provided by him.
Applicant  admitted  that  he  and  his  wife  failed  to  manage  their  finances
appropriately. They did not communicate about their finances, and when they did, it led
to  discord.  Their  children  are  athletes,  and  there  were  costs  for  traveling  to
competitions. He and his wife had medical problems. By 2018, he realized that he was
financially overextended, and he was getting nowhere by making the minimum monthly
payments.  He  prioritized  his debts,  keeping  current  on  essential  accounts  such  as  his
mortgage,  and  he  stopped  paying  the  debts  that  he  deemed  to  be  non-essential.  He
rejected bankruptcy because he felt responsible for the debts and wanted to pay them
eventually. The debts were in Applicant’s name,  in his wife’s name, or joint accounts in
both of their names. (Tr. at 19-21, 32-33; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-8)
Several creditors filed suit against Applicant and his wife. They paid or settled a
number of debts and judgments, including some that were not alleged in the SOR. It is
unclear if the debts were paid by Applicant or his wife. It makes little difference for our
purposes, and I will refer to all of them as paid by Applicant.
Applicant and his wife were sued by a bank for a debt that was not alleged in the
SOR. He paid $500 toward this debt in November 2019 and another $500 in June 2020.
In  September  2020,  the  bank  offered  to  accept  $4,751  in  settlement  of  the  $10,559
debt.  Applicant  accepted  the  settlement  and  paid  that  amount  to  the  creditor  with  a
credit card in September 2020. (Tr. at 44-45; Applicant’s response to SOR; AE 1, 2)
Applicant paid $1,158 in November 2020 to a  collection company on behalf of a
fertility center for bills from 2017, 2018, and 2019. This debt was in his wife’s name and
was not alleged in the SOR. (Applicant’s response to SOR; AE 2)
In  December  2020,  Applicant  paid  $203  in  settlement  of  a  $442  debt  to  a
collection company on behalf of a department store credit card account. This debt was
in his wife’s name and was not alleged in the SOR. (Applicant’s response to SOR; AE 3)
Applicant paid $465 in March 2021 to a collection company to settle a $582 debt
to  a  bank.  This  debt  was  in  his  wife’s  name  and  was  not  alleged  in  the  SOR.
(Applicant’s response to SOR; AE 4)
Applicant paid $302 in August 2021 to a department store credit card to settle a
$550  debt.  This  debt  was  in  his  wife’s  name  and  was  not  alleged  in  the  SOR.
(Applicant’s response to SOR; AE 7)
Applicant  decided  that  he  would  not  litigate  the  remaining  lawsuits  as  the  filing
fees were about $200 each time they responded. A collection company on behalf  of a
bank  obtained a  judgment  of  $22,987  against  Applicant  and  his wife  (SOR  ¶  1.e). His
wages  were  ordered  to  be  garnished  in  August  2020.  His  pay  was  garnished  $697
every  two  weeks.  Applicant’s  December  2020  pay  statement  showed  that  $6,215  had
been  garnished  from  his  pay  year-to-date.  His  February  2021  pay  statement  showed
that  $2,743  had  been  garnished  from  his  pay  year-to-date.  The  balance  had  been
reduced to $18,700 by January 2021; $11,479 by May 2021; and $3,769 by December
2021. It was paid in full in 2022. (Tr. at 37, 41-42; Applicant’s response to SOR;  GE 2,
4-8; AE 8)
The bank that held the $13,346 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d sued Applicant and his
wife  for  $13,346  plus  $365  costs.  In  June  2022,  the  bank  notified  the  court  that
Applicant paid the creditor sufficient consideration to satisfy the judgment. (Tr. at 36-37,
41-42; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2; AE 5)
In  December  2021,  the  bank  for  the  $21,370  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.b
(Applicant’s  wife  account)  issued  an  IRS  Form  1099-C  (Cancellation  of  Debt)  to
Applicant’s  wife,  which  cancelled  or  forgave  $19,981  of  the  debt.  The  bank  considers
the debt resolved and listed it on the October 2022 credit report with a $0 balance. The
cancellation  affected  their  taxes  for  2021  resulting  in  a  larger  than  normal  tax  liability.
He  paid  the  IRS  $4,167  in  October  2022.  (Tr.  at  38-39;  Applicant’s  response  to  SOR;
GE 2,4-8; AE 6, 10)
The bank that held the $88,166 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a obtained a judgment
of  $88,166  plus  $406  costs  against  Applicant  and  his  wife  in  October  2019.  A
garnishment  order was  quashed,  but  the  judgment is still in  effect.  No  payments have
been made toward the judgment. (Tr. at 35-38; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 4-8;
AE 9)
A   collection   company   on   behalf  of  a   bank  obtained   a   judgment of  $18,311   plus
$347   costs  against  Applicant  and   his   wife   in   2020   (SOR  ¶  1.f).   The   judgment   has  not
been  paid. He has not  made  any  payments toward the  $21,135  debt alleged  in  SOR ¶
1.c.  (Tr. at 39-43;  Applicant’s response to SOR;  GE 2-8)
To   summarize,  SOR   ¶¶   1.d   ($13,346)   and   1.e   ($22,835)   were  paid  by
garnishment;  1.b  ($21,370)  is  Applicant’s  wife’s  account  and  was  cancelled  by  the
creditor; and  1.a  ($88,166),  1.c  ($21,135), and  1.f ($18,659) are  unpaid. Applicant also
paid about $7,879  to resolve five debts that  were not alleged in the SOR.
Applicant was unable to  pay  other debts while  his  pay  was being  garnished. He
then  had  to  save  $4,167  to pay  the IRS for the  extra taxes that  resulted from the  1099-C
that  cancelled  $19,981   in  debt.   His  finances  are  improving.  His  wife   inherited   $88,000
and  two  cars.  He  has  about  $180,000  equity  in  his  house  and  $130,000  in  retirement
accounts. He stated that he plans to pay his debts. (Tr. at 23, 31, 34, 40, 44; Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 2)
