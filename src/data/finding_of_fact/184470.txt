Under Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed $17,234 for six
delinquent or past-due debts (SOR 1.a – 1.f). SOR 1.f alleges a $16,264 debt (or about
94  percent  of  the  total  debt  at  issue)  for  the  delinquent  remainder  after  resale  from  a
vehicle  repossession.  In  response  to  the  SOR  (Answer),  Applicant  admitted  with
explanations  all  of  the  Guideline  F  allegations.  In  addition  to  the  facts  established  by
Applicant’s admissions, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 43 years old and has worked for a defense contractor since September
2020. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from March 2008 until being medically
retired as a sergeant first class in September 2019. Thereafter, he was unemployed until
he began working for his current employer in a position that requires eligibility for access
to  classified  information.  Before  he  joined  the  Army,  he  worked  for  a  construction
company near his hometown. When Applicant left the Army, the Department of Veterans
Affairs  (VA)  assessed  him  as  100  percent  disabled  and  he  receives  monthly disability
benefit payments based on that assessment. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; AX I;  Tr. 59 – 61)
Applicant and his wife have been married since May 2002. They have two children,
ages 18 and 20. In 2002,  when  she  was pregnant with  their first  child, Applicant’s wife
became  ill  with  cancer.  As  a  result,  she  was  unable  to  work  and  their  child  was  born
prematurely. Additionally, they incurred medical and other debts that went unpaid due, in
part, to the loss of his wife’s income. When Applicant joined the Army, he still owed more
than $43,000 in past-due or delinquent debts. He estimates that at one point, he owed
between  $250,000  and  $300,000  in  unpaid  debts.  His  first  application  for  a  security
clearance  was  denied  in  July  2011,  because  of  security  concerns  about  his  finances
alleged  in  a  Letter  of  Intent  to  Deny  Security  Clearance  and  an  enclosed  SOR,  dated
June  1,  2009.  However,  he  stated  in  his  e-QIP  that  in  October  2011,  he  received  a
clearance after reconsideration of the decision to deny his application. Applicant was able
to resolve some of the debts listed in that SOR, but he acknowledges many of them simply
aged off  his credit history.  None of  those debts  appears on either of  the credit reports
submitted by the Government in this case and the SOR did not allege any of these debts.
(GX 1 – GX 5; Tr. 33, 44 – 46)
Applicant asserts that the delinquent debts he  carried when he joined the Army
were the  result of  his wife’s inability to  work when  she  became ill in 2002. In 2009, his
wife’s  cancer  returned  and  she  again  could  not  work.  This  caused  further  financial
difficulties as they tried to resolve the debts alleged in the 2009 SOR and still make ends
meet on a junior enlisted salary. The debts listed in the 2009 SOR consisted of 26 unpaid
medical  debts  presumably  associated  with  his  wife’s  cancer  treatment  in  2002.  Those
debts totaled about $7,844, and one of them was the subject of a civil judgment against
him. At the time of his wife’s 2002 cancer diagnosis, he had medical insurance through
his construction job that covered about two-thirds of his wife’s medical expenses. In the
Army, he and his family also had medical insurance that would have covered most of her
cancer treatment. The 2009 SOR also listed other non-medical debts, including a $10,000
tax lien, two car repossessions, two civil judgments against him, and 12 other delinquent
debts, all of which totaled about $34,850. (Answer; GX 2; GX 5; AX G – I; Tr. 42, 46 – 49)
In March 2018, Applicant’s wife was diagnosed a third time with the same type of
cancer. This time, she underwent a procedure that her physicians previously had chosen
not to perform. The procedure in 2018, according to Applicant, resulted in a successful
eradication of her cancer. He and his wife are optimistic that the cancer will not return.
Again,  Applicant  had  medical  insurance  for  his  family  provided  as  part  of  his  military
service. Because of this latest bout with cancer, Applicant’s wife again was unemployed,
this time for about nine months. She returned to work in early 2019; however, later that
year, Applicant was medically retired from the Army and found himself unemployed. They
lived  on  his wife’s net monthly income of about $2,000 and Applicant’s VA  disability of
about $2,800 a month until he started his current job in September 2020. At that time, he
earned an annual salary of about $72,000. After a pay raise in April 2022, he now makes
about $92,500 and his total household income is about $150,000 before taxes and other
deductions. (Answer; GX 2; AX G – I; Tr. 33 – 34, 48 – 50)
When Applicant submitted his most recent clearance application, he disclosed the
debt alleged at SOR 1.d. During the ensuing background investigation, credit reports and
Applicant’s statements during his December 16, 2020, personal subject  interview (PSI)
yielded information that supports all of the allegations in the November 2021 SOR. During
his  PSI,  Applicant  discussed  all  but  one  (SOR  1.b)  of  the  debts  alleged  in  the  SOR;
however,  he  stated  in  his  Answer  that  he  was  not  aware  of  debts  other  than  the
repossession debt at SOR 1.d  until he received the SOR. In response to the SOR, he
provided  information  showing  that,  ten  days  after  the  date  of  the  SOR,  he  paid  or
otherwise resolved the debts at SOR 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c.  At hearing, he testified that the
statement that he was unaware of his debts until he received the SOR was the result of
help  he  received  from  a  fellow  employee  in  drafting  his  Answer.  However,  he
acknowledged  that  he  was,  indeed,  aware  of  his  debts  as  early  as  December  2020.
(Answer; GX 1 – 4; AX A – C; AX F; Tr. 33)
The $16,264 debt at SOR 1.d is still unpaid. It represents the remainder after resale
of a pickup truck Applicant purchased for $37,948 in October 2017. Starting in January
2018, he was two months behind on his loan payments. By September 2018, he was five
months behind on his $700-a-month payments and decided to have the truck voluntarily
repossessed. Applicant attributed his difficulty in staying current on that loan to the fact
that his wife again developed cancer in early 2018 and they did not have her income while
she underwent treatment. After resale of the vehicle, he still owed the amount alleged at
SOR 1.d. During his December 2020 PSI, Applicant stated that he was in negotiations
with the creditor to repay that amount over four years. In response to the SOR, he stated
that in November 2021, the creditor offered to settle this debt for $9,546 over 12 months,
or $795 each month. At hearing, he testified the creditor offered to settle the debt for 12
monthly payments of $940, which would total of $11,280. His position at hearing was that
he could not afford to pay that amount. This debt remains unresolved. (Answer; GX 1 –
4; AX G – I; Tr.)
Applicant  did  not  provide  any  corroborating  documentation  about  the  SOR  1.d
creditor’s  settlement  offer to  resolve  the apparent  discrepancy  between  the  settlement
terms described in his Answer and those described at hearing. He also did not provide
any detailed information about his current finances, such  as a monthly budget or other
personal financial  statement  that might  shed better light on his ability to  pay this debt.
Further, he did not present any information about what, if any, adjustments he and his
wife  made  to  their  expenses  during  her  periods  of  unemployment  or  after  his  medical
retirement. Applicant has not sought or obtained any professional financial counseling or
assistance in resolving his remaining debt or improving the way he and his wife manage
their finances.
In June 2020, while he was still unemployed,  Applicant purchased a motorcycle
for $10,273. He sold it in early 2022 for a price that enabled him to satisfy the remaining
$9,269 due on the loan as well as realize about $1,500 in profit. In November 2020, after
he began his current job, he purchased a new pickup truck for $69,500 to replace a used
vehicle he had been driving. Not long thereafter, he was in an accident and, in May 2021,
he  purchased  another  vehicle  for  $46,797.  He  did  so  with  an  understanding  from  the
dealer that in six months, he could trade that vehicle for the same model pickup truck as
he bought in November 2020, but on better terms. In November 2021, he tried to avail
himself  of  the  dealer’s  offer.  Instead,  he  claims  he  could  not  obtain  a  loan  on  a  less
expensive truck and wound up buying a new model pickup truck for  $66,141. His high
monthly payment includes the balance due on the May 2021 vehicle. Applicant claims he
could  not  obtain financing  for a  used  vehicle,  and  he did  not  explain  what  role,  if  any,
insurance played after his accident involving the first truck he bought in November 2020.
(GX 4; Tr. 52 – 59)
As noted, above, during the December 2020 PSI, Applicant and the investigator
did  not  discuss  the  debt  at  SOR  1.b,  and  he  avers  that  he  was  unaware  of  it  until  he
received the SOR. He subsequently resolved the debt through four payments made in
November  and  December  2021.  The  record  is  unclear  as  to  the  origin  of  this  debt.
Applicant claims the bills for this debt went to his mother’s house, which was his military
home  of  record,  even  though  Applicant  has  not  lived  there  since  he  and  his  wife  got
married  in  2002.  As  to  his  overall  knowledge  of  his  various  debts,  he  testified  that  he
checked his credit report when he completed his e-QIP in September 2020. According to
the  October  2020  credit  report  introduced  by  the  Government,  SOR  1.d  had  been
delinquent since October 2017. I did not find his explanation about his awareness of this
debt to be credible and I find as fact that he knew about this debt well before he received
the SOR. (Answer; GX 1 – 4; AX F – I; Tr. 36)
At  hearing,  Applicant  provided  a  character  reference  from  his  supervisor  of  the
past  two  years.  According  to  the  author,  Applicant  has  performed  exceptionally  well
during  his  tenure  with  the  company.  He  is  well-regarded  in  the  workplace,  and  he  is
knowledgeable, reliable and professional in the performance of his duties. (AX J)
