(Item 3 at 34-38; Item 4 at 3)
The PRC is an authoritarian state in which the  Chinese Communist Party is the
paramount authority. China is one of two countries that pose the greatest espionage and
cyber-attack threats to the United States. China is the most active strategic competitor
responsible for cyber espionage against the U.S.  Government, corporations and allies.
The PRC has expansive efforts in place to acquire U.S. technology, including sensitive
trade  secrets  and  proprietary  information  to  enhance  its  global  strategic,  military,
diplomatic, and economic influence. China’s focus is on obtaining U.S. information and
technologies beneficial to  its military modernization and economic development.  About
80 percent of all economic espionage prosecutions brought by the U.S. Department of
Justice allege conduct that would benefit the  PRC, and at least 60 percent of all trade
secret theft cases have at least some nexus to China. (HE I)
China’s intelligence services, as well as private companies and entities, frequently
seek to exploit Chinese citizens or persons with family ties to China who can use their
insider  access  to  steal  secrets.  The  PRC  sometimes  uses  coercion  or  blackmail  to
manipulate  its  citizens  overseas  to  conduct  influence  operations  on  behalf  of  China.
Additionally,  the  PRC targets  individuals in  other countries  to  support its  acquisition of
foreign technology; seeks to recruit individuals primarily, but not exclusively, from relevant
diaspora  populations  and  recent  emigrants  from  the  PRC,  as  well  as  foreign  national
experts  whose  recruitment  the  PRC  views  as  necessary  to  its  scientific  and  technical
modernization,  especially  with  regard  to  defense  technology.  The  PRC  also  has
significant human rights issues including pervasive and intrusive technical surveillance,
arbitrary  detention,  forced  labor,  trafficking  in  persons,  and  has  been  found  to  have
committed  crimes  against  humanity  against  members  of  ethnic  and  religious  minority
groups in the China. (HE I)
