Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations in his Answer. He is 52 years old.
He married in 1995, divorced in 2000, and remarried in 2004. He has three children, two
adults and a minor. A fourth child is deceased. Applicant obtained a  bachelor’s degree
in 1991 and a master’s degree in 1999. He took pre-med classes from 2000 to 2003, in
anticipation  of  attending  medical  school.  As  of  his  July  2020  security  clearance
application (SCA), he had worked as a senior software engineer for his employer since
July 2017. He also worked part time as a self-employed senior software engineer for his
own  company  since  October  2009.  He  was  granted  a  security  clearance  in  2017.  He
has owned his home since June 2014. (Items 1, 2, 5)
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  failed  to  file  his  federal  and  state  income  tax
returns,  as  required,  for  tax  years  (TY)  2013  through  2017,  and  that  his  federal  and
state  income  tax returns for TY 2013 through  2015  remained  unfiled  as of  the  date  of
the SOR. In addition to his admissions in his Answer, Applicant disclosed and discussed
his  failure  to  timely  file  his  federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  for  TY  2013  through
2017 on his SCA and during his August 2020 background interview, and this information
is also reported in IRS and state tax account transcripts from August 2021. (Items 1-5)
Applicant  attributed  his  failure  to  file  his  relevant  federal  and  state  income  tax
returns  to  the  advice  he  received  from  his  certified  public  accountant  (CPA),  in  2018,
that  it  was  unnecessary for  him  to  file  his federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  for TY
2013 and 2014, because he would have been due a refund had he timely filed, and he
forfeited his refunds since three years had lapsed. He also cited to his mother’s illness
and  passing  in  early  2018  as  factors  that  contributed  to  his  delay  in  filing  his  relevant
income tax returns. He also acknowledged that he delayed and procrastinated providing
necessary tax documentation to his CPA, so that his CPA could file his relevant federal
and state income tax returns. (Items 1, 2, 5; AE A)
IRS   and   state   tax   account   transcripts  reflect   that  Applicant:   (1)   had   not filed  his
federal and  state  income  tax  returns for TY  2013, 2014, and  2015  as of  August 2021;
(2) filed  his federal income  tax  returns for TY  2016  and  2017  in May  2019, and he  had a
zero account  balance  for those  tax  years; and (3) filed  his state  income  tax  returns  for
TY  2016,  2017, and  2018  in April 2019,  and  no  further action  was required  on  his part.
The  IRS  tax  account transcripts also  reflect  that Applicant was given  an  extension,  until
October 2017,  to  file  his federal income  tax  return for TY  2016, and  he  did  not request
an  extension  to  file  his  federal income  tax  return for TY  2017. Applicant provided  copies
of   his  federal   and   state   income   tax   returns   for  TY   2013,   2014,   and   2015.  He   filed   his
federal and  state  income  tax  returns for TY  2013, 2014, and  2015  in February  2022. He
did not owe  any  taxes for these  tax  years. He  would have  been  due  federal refunds of
$3,426,   $6,460,   and   $2,587,   and   state   refunds   of   $958,  $1,154,   and   $1,069,  for   TY
2013, 2014, and  2015, respectively. (Items 1-4; AE A)
Applicant  described  his  financial  status  as  “good”  during  his  background
interview.  He  indicated  that his  failure  to  timely file his relevant  income  tax returns did
not contribute to other financial problems. He indicated that he intended to timely file his
income  tax  returns  in  the  future  and  that  he  learned  his  lesson,  became  more
organized, and was more attentive to the deadline for filing his income tax returns. (Item
