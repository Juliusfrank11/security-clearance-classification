Applicant  admitted  all of  the  SOR  allegations.  He  is  49  years  old.  The  dates  of
his first marriage and divorce are not in the record. He remarried in 2011 and divorced
in 2019. As of his April 2021 background interview, he was engaged to remarry. He has
four adult children. He received his basic law enforcement certification in May 2013. He
previously  worked  overseas  as  an  armed  security  officer  for  another  DOD  contractor
from April 2017 to April 2019. He worked as a school resource officer from May 2019 to
February  2021.  As  of  his  SCA,  he  was  an  armed  security  officer  overseas  for  his
employer,  a  DOD  contractor,  since  March  2021.  He  has  never  held  a  DOD  security
clearance. (Answer; Items 3, 5)
The   SOR  alleged   that   Applicant  failed   to   file,  as  required,  his   federal  and   state
income  tax  returns for at least tax  years (TY)  2013  through  2020  (SOR ¶¶  1.a  - 1.b). It
also  alleged   that  he   had   seven   delinquent  consumer  debts,   totaling   $49,689   (SOR  ¶¶
1.c   –   1.i).  In   addition   to   his  admissions  in   his  Answer,   Applicant   also  disclosed   and
discussed   his   delinquent   taxes  and   debts   in   his   SCA,   during   background   interviews
from  April 2021  and  May  2021,  and  in his January  2022  response  to  interrogatories.  A
credit  bureau   report  from   March   2021   reports  all   of   Applicant’s  delinquent  consumer
debts.  A  motor vehicle  registration  record reflects the debt  for SOR ¶  1.g. (Items 1 - 6)
During  his  April  2021  background  interview,  Applicant  attributed  his  financial
issues to being the sole provider for his family and not having enough money to pay his
debts.  He  also  stated  in  his  Answer,  “My  former  wife  unbeknownst  to  me  had  a
chemical  dependency.”  He  also  stated  that  she  opened  various  credit  accounts  in  his
name  without  his  knowledge  until  he  blocked  her  from  being  able  to  do  so.  (Answer;
Item 5)
Applicant listed in his SCA that he failed  to file his federal and state income tax
returns for TY 2015, and that he consequently owed $10,000. He acknowledged during
his April 2021 background interview that he failed to file his federal and state income tax
returns for TY 2013, 2014, and 2015, but he could not provide a reason for his failure.
He indicated that he filed his federal and state income tax returns for these tax years in
2016, and that he owed between $5,000 and $7,000 in federal taxes. He indicated that
the IRS withheld his tax refunds to resolve his outstanding taxes. (Items 3, 5)
Applicant  indicated  during  his  April  2021  background  interview  and  in  his
response to interrogatories that he did not file his federal and state income tax returns
for  TY  2017,  2018,  and  2019  because  he  was  tax  exempt  due  to  his  overseas
employment. He further indicated during his April 2021 background interview that since
returning  from  overseas  employment,  he  did  not  file  his  federal  and  state  income  tax
returns for TY 2019 and 2020 because his employer did not provide him with a W-2. He
indicated that he last filed his federal and state income tax returns in 2016, and he was
willing  to  submit  any  unfiled  federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  if  required  for  his
employment or security clearance.  He stated in his response to interrogatories that he
was unemployed in 2020 and part of 2021. He stated in his Answer that he was in the
process  of  filing  his  federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  for  2013  through  2021.  He
stated in his FORM Response that he filed his federal and state income tax returns for
tax years 2013 to 2021, but he did not provide documentation to corroborate his claims.
IRS  records  reflect  that  as  of  January  2022,  the  IRS  did  not  have  record  of  federal
income tax returns for Applicant for TY 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021.  (Answer; Item 5;
FORM Response)
SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.h are for two charged-off auto accounts with the same creditor,
for  $7,560  and  $10,697,  respectively.  Applicant  acknowledged  during  his  April  2021
background  interview  that  he  financed  $10,000  to  buy  a  car  (Car  1)  through  this
creditor. He then traded in Car 1 when he purchased another car (Car 2), as discussed
below in SOR ¶ 1.g. He was unsure if he still owed a balance on the loan for Car 1. He
also  acknowledged  that  he  voluntarily  surrendered  another  car  (Car  3),  which  he  also
financed  through  this  creditor,  but  he  could  not  recall  specific  details  about  this  auto
loan.  He  stated  in  his  FORM  Response  that  both  debts  were  charged  off.  (Item  5;
FORM Response)
SOR ¶ 1.d is for a $599 gym account in collection. Applicant indicated during his
April 2021 background interview that he had this gym membership, in which he paid $25
monthly,  between  2019  and  2020.  He  did  not  make  any  payments  on  this  gym
membership for over a year, and then he left this gym for another gym. He stated in his
Answer that he paid this debt in February 2022. He maintained in his FORM Response
that  he  paid  this  debt,  but  he  did  not  provide  documentation  to  corroborate  his  claim.
(Answer; Item 5; FORM Response)
SOR ¶ 1.e is for a $451 energy account in collection. Applicant indicated during
his  April  2021  background  interview  that  unbeknownst  to  him,  his ex-spouse  used  his
name on this account at a residence she lived in while he was employed overseas. He
acknowledged that they were married when she did so.  Applicant stated in his Answer
and  FORM  Response  that  he  paid  this  debt,  but  he  did  not  provide  documentation  to
corroborate his claim. (Answer; Item 5; FORM Response)
SOR ¶ 1.f is for a $158 gym account in collection. Applicant indicated during his
April  2021  background  interview  that  he  opened  this  gym  membership  between  2011
and  2015,  while  he  was  self-employed.  He  assumed  that  he  had  an  outstanding
balance because he did not pay his last membership fee. Applicant stated in his Answer
and  FORM  Response  that  he  paid  this  debt,  but  he  did  not  provide  documentation  to
corroborate his claim. (Answer; Item 5; FORM Response)
SOR  ¶¶  1.g  and  1.i  are  for  a  $25,869  charged-off  auto  account  and  a  $4,355
charged-off  credit  account,  respectively.  Applicant  indicated  during  his  April  2021
background interview that he purchased Car 2 through a loan of approximately $35,000
from the creditor in SOR  ¶ 1.i. He was unable to make monthly payments on  his auto
loan  and  he  surrendered  Car  2  in  2016,  prior  to  his  overseas  employment.  He
acknowledged  being  told  that  he  might  still  owe  a  balance  on  the  loan  after  he
voluntarily  surrendered  the  car,  but  he  never  followed  up  with  the  creditor.  A  motor
vehicle registration record reflects that the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.g had a lien on Car 2. He
stated  in  his  FORM  Response  that  both  debts  were  charged  off.  (Items  5,  6;  FORM
Response)
Applicant stated  in  his  FORM  Response  that  his credit  score  was improving. He
stated   that   he   was  striving   to   continue   to   improve   his   financial  status.   There  is   no
evidence  in the  record  that  he  received  financial counseling. (Form  Response; Items 1-
6)
