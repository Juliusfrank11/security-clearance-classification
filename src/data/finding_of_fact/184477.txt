Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges a charged-off loan for about $21,000 (SOR ¶
1.a), and a charged-off student loan for $6,250. (SOR ¶ 1.b) Under Guideline E, the SOR
alleges Applicant intentionally falsified his April 2020 SCA when he failed to disclose the
accounts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b in his answers to the financial questions in his
2020 SCA. (SOR ¶ 2.a)
In his  answers  to  the  SOR, Applicant  admitted  the  financial  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶
1.a  and  1.b, but  denied  that he  deliberately  falsified  or withheld  information  from  his 2020
SCA.  (SOR  ¶  2.a)  He  averred  that the  omission  was unintentional,  an  oversight on  his
part.
Applicant’s  SOR  admissions  are  incorporated  into  my  findings  of  fact.  After  a
thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant  is  49  years  old.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2013,  a  master’s
degree in 2014, and a second master’s degree in 2015. (Item 3) He married in 1995 and
divorced in 2002. He married his current spouse in 2003. He has four adult children, ages
33, 29, 25, and 18, and two stepchildren, ages 29 and 36. (Item 3)
Applicant served in the U.S. Air Force between April 1993 and May 2013. He was
honorably retired in the grade of technical sergeant (E-6). He stated that the Air Force
granted him eligibility for a secret clearance in 2004, which he maintained without  any
security  concerns.  After  his  retirement,  he  worked  a  year  for  a  civilian  company.  His
current  employer and clearance  sponsor, a  large  federal contractor, hired  him  in  June
2014. Since then, he has held several positions with the federal contractor while holding
a clearance.
Applicant took a $20,000 home improvement loan in 2011, and defaulted on the
loan in 2017. (SOR ¶ 1.a) He failed to explain what circumstances, if any, prevented him
from making the loan payments. On October 26, 2021,  Applicant contacted the lender
and established a new payment schedule of $77 per month, and made one payment that
month.  He  established  this  payment  agreement  after  his  June  2020  interview  with  an
OPM investigator, but before the SOR was issued on November 5, 2021. His payment
history  shows  that  he  made  a  $154  payment  on  November  2,  2021,  and  consecutive
monthly payments of $77 from December 2021 until July 21, 2022. (See HE 1)
Concerning the defaulted education loan (SOR ¶ 1.b), Applicant explained he co-
signed the loan for his stepdaughter and she defaulted. After the creditor asked him to
repay the loan, he settled the account for less, and paid it. The creditor provided him with
a document indicating he was “fully released” from any further obligation as of May 2017.
(See documents attached to SOR answer.)
In Section 26 (Financial Record) of his 2020 SCA, Applicant failed to disclose the
two  accounts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  He  answered  “No” to  the  financial  questions  asking
whether in the last seven years he had an account turned over to a collection agency,
had  been  over  120  days  delinquent  on  any  debt,  or  was  currently  over  120  days
delinquent  on  any  debt.  Because  of  the  two  delinquent  accounts  alleged  in  the  SOR,
Applicant  should have  answered  “Yes” to  all  three  questions  with  respect  to  the  home
improvement loan, and “Yes” to the first two questions concerning the defaulted student
loan. If he resolved the education loan in 2017, then the education loan was not 120 days
delinquent when he completed the SCA.
During  his  June  2020  background  interview,  Applicant  volunteered  that  his
stepdaughter  defaulted  on  the  student  loan.  He  did  not  disclose  his  defaulted  home
improvement loan until the investigator confronted him about it.
In his answer to the SOR, and in his response to the FORM, Applicant stated that
his failure to list the two debts was an oversight and not an attempt to deceive or withhold
information. In his defense and in mitigation, Applicant highlighted his over 20 years of
military service on active duty in the Air Force, his honorable discharge, and his over eight
years of service for a large federal contractor supporting the U.S. military. He believes his
record demonstrates he is a man of integrity, honor, and of strong moral fiber. He claimed
his military and civilian records reflect no blemishes or negative entries, and demonstrate
he has been successful. Since he was hired in 2014, Applicant was promoted twice and
currently holds a managerial position.
Applicant  presented  no  evidence  to  show  he  has  participated  in  financial
counseling or has a working budget. He did not present evidence of his current financial
situation  (gross  monthly  income,  deductions,  monthly  expenses,  and  monthly  net
remainder). Without any documentary evidence of his current financial situation, it is not
possible for me to assess whether he is financially overextended.
The only glimpse at Applicant’s current financial situation arises from a review of
his 2021 credit bureau report (CBR). (Item 4) Except for the two accounts alleged in the
SOR, he has no other delinquent accounts. The CBR shows 20 accounts (trades) with
“0”  balance;  three  student  loans  totaling  $28,357;  and  13  open  accounts  with  an
aggregate balance of about $535,415, which include nine credit-card or revolving-charge
accounts, two mortgages, three auto loans, and two unsecured loans.
Applicant  did  not  report  any  adverse  information  under  the  SCA  financial
questions. He denied he deliberately falsified or withheld information from his 2020 SCA
about  his  finances.  After  considering  all  of  the  evidence,  including  Applicant’s  age,
education, experience, honorable military service, and service for a federal contractor, I
find he did not intentionally provide false information or conceal his finances on the SF
86.
