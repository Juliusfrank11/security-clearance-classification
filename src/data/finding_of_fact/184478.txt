In   the   SOR,   the   Government   alleged   Applicant’s  five   delinquent  debts   totaling
approximately  $31,000. These delinquencies are credit-card  accounts  (SOR ¶¶  1.a, 1.b,
and   1.d),  a   car  loan   (SOR  ¶   1.c),  and   a   business  loan   for  which   she   is  personally
obligated  (SOR ¶  1.e).  The  Government also  alleged  that  Applicant  had  not  timely  filed
her federal income  tax  returns for the  2016  and  2017  tax  years (SOR ¶  1.f). Finally, it
alleged  that she  did not  timely  file  her  State  A  income  tax  returns for the  2010  through
2012   tax   years  and   the   2016   through   2018   tax   years  (SOR  ¶   1.g).  In   her  Answer,
Applicant  admitted   all   of   the   SOR  allegations  with   the   exception   of   SOR  ¶   1.g.  She
partially   denied   the   allegations  in   SOR  ¶   1.g   because   she   claimed   that   she   was  not
required  to file  an  income  tax  return in State A for the  2010  through  2012  tax  years.  She
admitted   that  she   had   not   timely   filed   her   State   A   income   tax   returns  for  the   2016
through  2018  tax  years. Her admissions are  adopted  as  findings of  fact.  (Answer; GE  1-

Applicant  claimed her financial  issues  resulted from  unemployment  and a failed
business  venture.  In  about  2014,  she  started  a  vaping  business.  The  business  was
initially profitable. However, in 2017, after a change in federal regulations, the business
began  losing  money  and  she  sold  it  in  2018.  After  a  brief  period  of  employment  with
another  business  in  2018  where  she  earned  $300  to  $400  per  month,  she  was
unemployed from November 2018 until March 2019. (Tr. 27-30; GE 1-3)

and also used it for expenses related to her business. She became delinquent on this
account  in  2018  after  she  became  unemployed.  As  of  the  hearing,  she  had  yet  to

when  she  could  no  longer  afford  them.  As  of  the  hearing,  she  had  yet  to  contact  the
creditor  to  try to  resolve  her  delinquency  because  she  is  working  on  addressing  other
delinquencies.  The  creditor  filed  a  lawsuit  against  her  with  respect  to  this  debt.  In
October 2022, the creditor filed a garnishment with her employer in order to collect on
this  debt.  The  garnishment  was  set  to  begin  on  November  7,  2022.  (Tr.  25,  35,  40;

Applicant  has  two  additional  delinquent  credit  cards  that  are  not  listed  in  the

been paying down delinquent debts not listed on the SOR beginning in 2019 after she
starting  working  for  her  current  employer  because  she  had  the  income  to  do  so.  In

military service. (Tr. 26-27, 36-38; Answer; GE 5; AE F)
