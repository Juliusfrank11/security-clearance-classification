In Applicant’s SOR response, she admitted SOR allegations ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c,
and she denied SOR ¶ 1.d. Applicant’s admissions and  the credit reports in the record
support the SOR allegations. Additional findings follow.
Applicant is 52 years old, and she has been employed by a government contractor
as a business analyst since July 2019. Her annual salary is about $52,762. In 2016, she
received an associate’s degree. She has been married for 29 years, and she has six adult
children. She requires eligibility for a DOD secret security clearance in order to perform
specific duties for her employer. (GE 1; AE B; Tr. 22-26, 54)
Financial Considerations
The SOR alleges a previous Chapter 7 bankruptcy case filed by Applicant and her
spouse in December 2013, and three delinquent debts. Two of the three debts are student
loans referred to the U.S. Department of Education (Dept. ED) for collection, and the final
debt is a medical account referred for collection. Applicant denied the medical account in
her SOR response because this debt has been paid in full. (SOR response; Tr. 26-33;
GE 1-7)
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges that Applicant and her spouse filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy
protection in December 2013. The case was discharged by the bankruptcy court in March
2014. Applicant stated that the debts that were included in the case totaled about $70,000
and were mostly medical accounts. Her spouse was unemployed at that time and suffered
from  health  complications  after  their  medical  insurance  had  lapsed.  In  addition,  their
youngest son got into serious trouble and they had pay significant legal fees to provide
an attorney for him. (GE 1, GE 2, GE 3, GE 4; Tr. 47-49)
SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c allege that Applicant owes a total of $73,739 for two delinquent
student loans that were placed with the Dept. ED for collection in about 2018. The student
loans  are  currently  deferred  due  to  the  COVID-19  relief  pause  enacted  by  the
government.   Student  loan   payments  are  to   begin   after  December  31,   2022.   It   is  her
intention to repay her student loans.  (GE 4, GE 5, GE 8;  AE A, AE F,  AE G;  Tr. 29-42)
Applicant  stated  during  her  January  2021  background  interview  that  she  was
directed in about 2017 to make $1,200 monthly payments for her student loans. She could
not  afford  the  monthly  payment,  and  requested  to  be  placed  into  the  income-driven
student  loan payment plan.  Her payments  were  lowered  to $800 monthly.  Her spouse
had been laid-off by his employer, and she was still unable to make the lower monthly
student loan payments. In 2020, she submitted another income-driven application with
her student loan creditor. Shortly after submitting the application, her student loans were
deferred due to the COVID-19 pandemic. She also submitted a student loan consolidation
application with Direct Loans. As of January 2022, Applicant provided documentation that
she had successfully rehabilitated her student loans. Her monthly payments beginning in
about January 2023 will be about $288. (Tr. 29-42; AE C, AE D; GE 8, GE 9)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges that Applicant owes $422 for a medical account that has been
referred for collection. She provided sufficient documentation showing that this account
has been paid. (GE 1, GE 4; AE F; Tr. 27-28)
Applicant began to experience financial problems in about 2017 after her spouse
suffered from various medical issues without health insurance coverage and inconsistent
employment.  At  the  time  of  the  hearing,  he  was  unemployed  and  no  longer  receiving
unemployment  benefits.  They  recently  sold  their  house,  paid  off  their  debts  with  the
money,  and  moved  into  an  apartment.  Since  July  2019,  they  have  been  covered  by
medical insurance through her employer. She now manages the apartment complex and
receives an apartment rent-free plus a monthly salary of $685. She is able to live within
her means, and she has not developed any new delinquent debt. She is committed to
maintaining her financial responsibilities in a productive manner. (Tr. 48-50, 53-56; AE A)
Applicant  provided  a  financial  summary  and  monthly  budget  post-hearing.  After
deducting her monthly expenses from her net monthly income, she is left with a monthly
net remainder of about $1,200. Her budget included the student loan monthly payment of
$288. She also participated in financial counseling after filing for bankruptcy almost nine
years ago. (Tr. 59-60; GE 3; AE A)
Applicant’s employer considers her to be a valuable asset. She was nominated for
an award in 2019 due to her outstanding professionalism and willingness to serve others’
needs before her own. In 2021, she received an employee merit pay increase. (AE B, AE
