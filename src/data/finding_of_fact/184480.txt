Applicant, age 42, is a single mother of two adult children and one minor child. Her
two youngest children reside with her. She attended college between 2007 and 2011, but
did  not  earn  a  degree.  She  has  been  employed  as  a  material  handler  by  a  defense
contractor since January 2020. This is her first application for a security clearance. (Item

The   SOR  alleged   16   delinquent   debts   totaling   $16,166,   each   of   which  were
confirmed  by credit reports from 2020 and  2021.  In  her Answer, Applicant admitted  each
debt, with  explanations  in support of mitigation.  With  respect to  SOR ¶¶ 1.a  through  1.c,
1.e  through  1.h  and 1.l, she  stated that she  was working  on a  “credit  repair.” Concerning
SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.k, 1.n, and  1.o, she  stated  that they  were included  in  a  2013  Chapter 13
bankruptcy. She also stated that she resolved the  mortgage account in SOR ¶ 1.j (which
had  also been  included  in the  bankruptcy) and  was still  residing  in the  home. She  claimed
that she  paid SOR ¶ 1.m  “10  years ago,” and  SOR ¶ 1.p  (on  a  date  not indicated). With
regard  to   SOR ¶  1.i,  she   stated   that  it  was  a   “voluntary   repossession   due   to   getting   a
better vehicle  with  a  better price  that  Im  [sic]  currently  paying  for with  no  problem.”  She
did  not  proffer  any   documentary   evidence   to   corroborate   her  statements   or  refute   the
information  from the credit reports.  (Items 6, 7, 8)
Applicant reported no periods of unemployment in her April 2020 SCA. However,
during Interview 3, she revealed that she had been unemployed from November 1, 2019
through November 15, 2019. She left her prior employer at the end of October 2019 to
find a shorter commute to work. She was supported by her savings during that period of
unemployment while she searched for a new job. She worked primarily in retail jobs from
2009 until she began working with a defense contractor in January 2020. (Items 5, 10)
Applicant disclosed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy on her April 2020 SCA and reported
that it was initially filed in June 2013, refiled in January 2014 (due to a clerical error), and
then  discharged  in  December  2018.  She  stated:  “Filing  chapter  13  allowed  me  to  pay
all/portion of my debt.” She also disclosed that she voluntarily surrendered a vehicle for
repossession in about September 2019 to resolve a $5,600 debt. During Interview 1, she
attributed her bankruptcy filing to a combination of her pregnancy with her youngest child
and  an  employer  cutting  back  her  work  hours.  That  employer  changed  its  policy  and
required everyone to reduce hours to part-time except for managers (which she was not).
While  the  record  did  not  specify  the  period  when  her  hours  were  reduced,  Applicant
indicated that it began around the time when she was pregnant with her youngest child.
On the April 2020 SCA, Applicant reported that her youngest child was born in 2010 and
that she worked for said employer from October 2009 through June 2013. The record did
not otherwise specify her income history. (Items 5, 10)
During  Interview  1, Applicant explained  that  she  was not  behind  in  her payments
for the  vehicle  reported  in the  April 2020  SCA. She  decided  to  voluntarily  surrender the
vehicle  to  the  creditor when  she  realized  that she  could not afford to  keep  up  with  the
payments  ($265/bi-weekly) due  to  cost  of repairs and  gas. At the  time  of the  surrender,
the   creditor  told  her  that  she   might  owe   a   deficiency   balance.   However,  she   had   not
received  anything  from  the  creditor since  the  surrender.  This debt was reported  in  SOR ¶
1.i. After   the   surrender, she   purchased   another vehicle   with  a   lower monthly   payment,
saving her $110 per month. Her 2021 credit report corroborated that her current car loan
was  in  good   standing.   The   record   did   not  otherwise  specify   her  expense   history.  She
described  her then  financial situation  as decent.  She  did not expect  to  incur any  additional
delinquent debts  because  she  had  begun  reading  books on  repairing  credit, created  a
budget, and reduced her car payment.  (Item  6, 10)
Later during Interview 1, Applicant was confronted with delinquent debts that were
not reported on her April 2020 SCA. She did not believe that she needed to list the specific
debts included in her bankruptcy. She denied any knowledge of other debts that had not
been included in the bankruptcy, but stated that she would be willing to pay them if it was
determined that she owed them. She did not address what, if any, steps she would take
to  investigate  the  unknown  debts.  She  maintained  that  she  did  not  possess  any
documents concerning her finances. (Item 10)
During  Interview  2, Applicant volunteered  that she  was working  on  repairing  her
credit. She  also purchased  a  book titled  “By  the  Book Credit Repair” to  assist in those
efforts.  Upon   investigation,  she   learned   that  one   of   the   debts  that  she   had   previously
identified  as a  medical bill during  Interview  1  was actually  a  mortgage  loan. However, the
SOR and  credit reports indicate  that the  debt  was not a mortgage  loan  (SOR ¶  1.m), but
a childcare expense. She also reiterated that the federal student loan accounts discussed
during  Interview  1  were  in  forbearance  status  and  no  longer  past  due  (which  was
corroborated  by  her  November  2021  CBR).  She  did  not  discuss  her  delinquent  debts
during Interview 3. (Items 6, 10)
The Government provided a copy of the bankruptcy petition filed by Applicant and
the court’s docket sheet of the bankruptcy proceedings. According to  those documents,
the petition was filed in February 2014. The Chapter 13 plan was filed in February 2014
and confirmed in May 2014. Neither the terms of the plan nor any plan payments made
by Applicant were indicated in the record. In November 2017, the trustee filed a motion
to dismiss (MTD) for failure to make plan payments. A certificate of service for the MTD
was filed in June 2018. In November 2018, the court entered an order of default granting
the  MTD.  The  case  was  closed  in  January  2019.  The  docket  sheet  listed  the  “debtor
disposition” as “Dismissed for failure to make plan payments.” (Item 9)
