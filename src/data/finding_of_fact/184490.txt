In his Answer, Applicant admitted all allegations contained in SOR ¶¶1.a through
1.n,  and  denied  the  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  2.a,  with  explanations.  His  admissions  and
explanations are incorporated into these findings of fact.
Applicant is 35 years old. He is married and has four children. In April 2016, he
began  a  position  with  a  defense  contractor.  In  September  2021,  he  submitted  his first
security clearance application (SCA). In it, he disclosed periods of unemployment from
November 2011 to June 2012, December 2010 to March 2011, and from December 2009
to January 2010. (Item 3)
Financial Considerations
As part of its background investigation, the Government obtained Applicant’s credit
bureau  report  (CBR)  in  October  2021.  Thirteen  delinquent  debts  and  an  April  2013
Chapter 7 bankruptcy were reported  on it. The bankruptcy entry noted that $35,777 of
debt  was  discharged  in  the  bankruptcy.  (Item  6)  Subsequently,  the  Government
requested  that  Applicant  complete  interrogatories  inquiring  into  the  status  of  those  13
delinquent  debts.  Applicant  completed  the  interrogatories  and  submitted  them  to  the
Government on “January 21, 2021.” (Item 4 at 11) (The year should have been noted as
2022 and not the preceding year of  2021  at which time  Applicant had not submitted  a
SCA.)
In addition to addressing the status of  the debts in the interrogatories, Applicant
explained that his wife was unemployed when he stopped making payments on the debts.
(Item 4 at 7) He included a copy of his January 2022 budget, which indicated that his net
monthly  income  was  $9,127  and  his  expenses  were  $7,091.  He  has  about  $1,056
remaining at the end of the month. The budget included monthly payments on five debts
that total $980, the largest one being an automobile loan. None of the five debts noted in
the budget were alleged in the SOR. (Item 4 at 9)
Based  on  the  October  2021  CBR,  the  March  2022  SOR  alleged  the  2013
bankruptcy and the 13 delinquent debts included in Applicant’s interrogatories. The debts
totaled  $42,028  and  became  delinquent  between  2018  and  2021.  They  remain
unresolved. (Item 6)
Personal Conduct
The SOR alleged that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose delinquent financial
accounts  in  his  September  2021  SCA.  Applicant  denied  that  he  intentionally  failed  to
disclose  that  information.  In  his  Answer,  he  stated  he  was  confused  by  the  financial
questions and thought the inquiry was limited to delinquent accounts in the past seven
years that were not listed on his credit record. He said he did not attempt to hide his debts
or information from the government. (Item 2)
