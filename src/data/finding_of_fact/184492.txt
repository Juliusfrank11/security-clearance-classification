In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  she  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.f,  and
denied SOR ¶ 1.g as a duplicate debt. Her admissions are included in the findings of fact.
After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following
findings of fact.
As discussed below, this case resulted from a 2021 credit report of Applicant’s that
was noted through the DOD’s Continuous Evaluation Program.  Applicant’s biographical
information is largely taken from her July 2016 security clearance application (SCA), as
no later SCA is available. She is 39 years old. She has never married and she has no
children. She graduated from high school in 2000. She earned an associate degree in
2004 and a bachelor’s degree in 2013. She has worked as a  cleared federal contractor
since August 2006, and for her current employer and clearance sponsor since  October
2008. She works as an executive assistant. Since December 2015, she has also worked
part-time as a receptionist at a salon. (Item 3; AE 4)
Applicant’s 2016 background investigation (July 2016 SCA, September 2016 credit
report, and August 2017 interview) indicated no delinquencies. (Items 3, 4, 8) The SOR
is  based  on  credit  reports  from  January  2021  and  March  2022,  which  list  delinquent
accounts totaling about $54,000. (Items 5, 6, 7)
The  SOR concerns seven  alleged  delinquent  debts,  totaling  about $47,787.  (One
debt  is alleged  twice,  so  the  more accurate  amount is about $42,000). All  of  the  accounts
are  consumer  credit  accounts  that  have   been   charged   off.  This  includes  SOR  ¶¶   1.a
($16,082),  1.b  ($5,648), 1.c  ($7,703), 1.d  ($9,809),  1.e  ($1,627), and  1.f ($1,270). SOR ¶
1.g  ($5,648) is a  duplicate  of  SOR ¶  1.b,  as it is for the  same  amount,  and  owed  to  the
same creditor. (Items 5, 6, 7)
With her answer to the SOR, Applicant provided an agreement with a debt relief
company (DRC) she engaged in April 2019. She was to pay $1,000 a month to the DRC
for resolution and settlement of her debts. She enrolled 13 creditors, with almost $65,000
in combined debt. All of the SOR debts are included in the agreement. (Answer Att. F and
Exhibit A thereto)
As of April 2022, when Applicant answered the SOR, she had resolved all but three
of  the  debts  through  the  debt  relief  program.  (Answer  Att.  A)  Applicant  also  provided
several  IRS  1099-C  Forms  reflecting  the  cancellation  of  several  other  debts  in  2021.
These cancellations totaled about $12,470. (Answer Att. B, C, D, and E).
Little  is  known  about  the  origin  of  the  debts,  but  Applicant  noted  in  FORM
Response that, “In early 2019, I realized that making the minimum payments on my credit
cards and unsecured loans would not be the best way of paying off my debt.” (Item 1A).
Through the DRC program, she has made regular $500 payments twice a month since
May  2019,  except  the  month  of  October  2020,  when  she  changed  jobs.  (FORM
Response, Item 1A) She documented numerous bi-monthly recurring deposits from her
checking account from May 2019 through July 2022. (FORM Response Enclosure 2)
As of July 2022, nine of the 13 accounts in the DRC debt relief program had been
paid off (including SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f), three were in the process of repayment (SOR ¶¶
1.b,  1.c,  and  1.d),  and  one  (SOR  ¶  1.a,  the  largest  debt)  was  in  the  process  of  being
negotiated. Applicant expects to complete the payment and fully resolve her debts in May
2024. (FORM Response Enclosure 1; FORM Response Item 1A)
Applicant noted the status of the various accounts enrolled in the DRC debt relief
program in margin notes in FORM Response Enclosure 1. Since that information was not
independently  verified,  I  reopened  the  record  to  allow  her  the  opportunity  to  provide
corroborating documentation. (HE 1)
In  response, Applicant  provided  updated  information  in November 2022.  SOR ¶
1.b   is  under  a   settlement  agreement  for  $4,237.   SOR  ¶   1.c  is   under  a   settlement
agreement for $2,559.  SOR ¶  1.d  is under a  settlement agreement  for $4,905. Each  of
these  creditors receive  monthly  checks from  the  DRC and  the  payment plan  for each  debt
is  on  a  defined  timeframe.  (AE  6)  No  new  information  was  provided  for  SOR  ¶  1.a
($16,082), beyond the prior indication that the debt was being negotiated by the DRC.
With her FORM Response, Applicant also had provided documentation that, as of
July  2022,  she  had  almost  $133,000  in  her  company  IRA  account  (subject  to  market
fluctuation).  She  has  not  used  those  funds  to  address  her  debts,  given  the  taxes  and
penalties that would result from an early withdrawal, but they are available to her. She
also noted that the DRC has provided financial education to her on better use of credit
cards and loans to avoid large debt in the future. (FORM Response and Enclosure 3)
Applicant also provided a budget for November 2022. It shows $5,644 in income
($4,884 per month from her full-time job and $760 per month from her part-time job at the
salon)  and  $4,091  in  expenses,  including  her  debt  payments,  credit  card  and  loan
payments,  rent,  and  other  regular  monthly  expenses  (including
insurance,  utilities,
entertainment, charitable gifts, and gas). (AE 7)
Applicant’s supervisors at both of her jobs provided strong recommendations. Ms.
H has known Applicant since Applicant was a teenager. She later worked her way through
college,  and  later  became  Ms.  H’s  executive  assistant  in  a  cleared  DOD  position.
Applicant has her total confidence and Applicant has the discretion, decision-making, and
ability to work well with others that is required for the job. Ms. H would trust Applicant with
her life, secrets, possessions, and her family. (AE 4)
Applicant’s supervisor at the salon also credited her professionalism, and noted
that  he  entrusts  her  to  handle  cash  and  credit  card  transactions  regularly,  as  well  as
sensitive client information. He has also entrusted her with caring for family pets in their
home when they are on vacation. (AE 5)
