Applicant is 66 years old, married and has two adult children. He graduated from
high school and earned a bachelor’s degree. He was also awarded a certificate in 2004.
He  enlisted  in  the  U.S.  Navy  in  1981  and  served  until  1986,  when  he  was  honorably
discharged. He then enlisted in the Navy Reserve and served until 2013. At the time of
his discharge from the Reserve, he held the rank of Command Master Chief (E-9). He
has been employed by a defense contractor as an engineer since December 2012. He
has held a Secret security clearance continuously since 1992. (Tr. at 25-28, 31-33; GE 1
at 8, 12-19, 21-23.)
Paragraph 1  - Guideline F, Financial Considerations
The Government alleged in this paragraph of the SOR that Applicant is ineligible
for  clearance  because  he  has  failed  to  meet  his  financial  obligations  and  is  therefore
potentially  unreliable,  untrustworthy,  or  at  risk  of  having  to  engage  in  illegal  acts  to
generate  funds.  Applicant  admitted  three  of  the  five  allegations  in  the  SOR.  He  also
submitted additional information to support the granting of national security eligibility.
The  Government  alleged  that  Applicant  had  failed  to  timely  file  his  Federal  tax
returns for tax years (TYs) 2014, 2016, 2018, 2019, and 2020 (SOR subparagraph 1.a)
as well as TY 2017. (SOR subparagraph 1.b) Subparagraph 1.c alleged that Applicant
failed  to  timely  file  his  state  tax  returns  for  TYs  2014  through  2020.  The  SOR  further
alleged  past-due  state  income  taxes  of  $5,821  (SOR  subparagraph  1.d)  and  past-due
county  property  taxes  of  $204  for  TY  2019.  (SOR  subparagraph  1.e).  In  the  Answer,
Applicant denied the allegations in SOR 1.a and 1.c and admitted the other allegations.
He provided additional information with respect to each SOR subparagraph:
1.a  Failure to  timely  file  Federal tax  returns for TYs 2014, 2016, 2018, 2019, and
2020. Despite  Applicant’s denial, the  record established  that this allegation  was accurate.
Applicant filed  his Federal tax  returns for TYs  2019 and  2020  in or about May  2022, one
or two years late. He advised that his tax preparer was in the process of preparing Federal
tax returns for the three earlier years. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 30-54; AE J and AE K.)
Prior to the hearing Applicant provided IRS Account Transcripts for TYs 2019 and
2020. These transcripts reflect that Applicant paid in 2022 substantial sums due with each
return, specifically $19,239 for 2019 and $17,214 for TY 2020. They also reflect additional
taxes and penalties owed in the amounts of $3,693 and $1,213 for TYs 2019 and 2020,
respectively. Applicant planned to pay the amounts due on or before October 2, 2022.
The tax deficiencies were due to under withholding on his and his wife’s combined annual
income of about $300,000. Applicant did not file his TYs 2019 and 2020 returns on time
because he did not have a tax preparer that he trusted until after the TY 2020 return was
due in 2021. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 30-54; AE A, AE B, AE C, AE J, and AE K.)
Applicant  has  been  delayed  filing  his  Federal  returns  for  TY  2018  because  he
needs a specific tax document to prepare his tax return. He wants his recently hired tax
preparer to complete the return with an estimate of the missing information. He expects
to  have  the  TY  2018  Federal  return  filed  shortly  after  the  hearing  date.  The  IRS  had
assessed taxes for that tax year in the amount of $20,469, and he paid the assessment.
He had purchased tax preparation software for TYs 2014, 2016, and 2018, but he did not
feel confident that he was properly using it. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 30-54, 58; AE C.)
Applicant filed for an extension in 2017 for TY 2016 and paid an estimated tax due
of $19,319. He failed to file his return thereafter because he had no tax professional he
could trust. His current tax professional has not yet had the time to prepare the TY 2016
Federal  return  for  Applicant.  He  trusts  that  his  tax  professional  will  eventually  file  the
return for TY 2016. Applicant admitted that he has been lax about dealing with his tax
filing responsibilities. He expects the TY 2016 return to be filed before the end of 2022.
(Answer at 1; Tr. at 55-59; AE B.)
Applicant used commercial tax preparation software to file his TY 2015 tax return.
The return was timely filed. TY 2014 was the first year when Applicant failed to file his
federal tax return. The tax professional who had prepared his prior  returns had retired,
and  Applicant  did  not  identify  a  new person  to  help  him.  His  new  tax  professional  will
prepare this return when he has the time available to do so. Applicant has a goal to file
the return by yearend 2022. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 59-65; AE A.)
1.b   Failure  to   timely   file   Federal  tax   return  for  TY   2017.   Applicant   wrote   in  the
Answer  that  he   will  file   his  TY   2017   Federal  tax   return  once   his  tax   preparer  has
completed  it. As  of  the  hearing  date, the  return  had  not been  filed.  Applicant  attached  to
the   Answer  an   Account  Transcript  from   the   IRS   for  TY   2017.  It   reflects  that  the   IRS
prepared  a  substitute  return on  April 27, 2020,  for this year and  assessed  additional taxes
in the  amount of $30,929.  Applicant  made  a  payment  on  February  8,  2021,  in  the  amount
of  $24,964.  He intends to  have  his tax  professional file  his own  tax return for TY  2017.
(Answer at 1; Tr. at 65-70; AE F.)
1.c Failure to  timely  file  state  tax  returns for TYs 2014  through  2020.   In  the  Answer
Applicant wrote  that he  has  filed  his State  A  tax  returns for  TYs 2019  and  2020. He  also
wrote  that the  returns for the  other years  will  be  filed  once  his tax  preparer has  completed
the  returns.  For TY  2019  he  owed  $613,  and  he  received  a  small  refund  for TY  2020.  The
state  tax  authority  reassessed  his taxes for TY  2019  and  determined  that Applicant owed
an  additional $4,049. Applicant intends to  file  his other state  tax  returns when  he  files his
Federal tax  returns  for the  TYs 2014  and  2016  through  2018  and  will pay  any  taxes he  is
assessed  for those years. He filed his TY 2015 state tax return when he  filed his Federal
return for that year using  tax preparation  software. (Answer at 2; Tr. at 70-76.)
1.d Delinquent state  tax debt in the  approximate amount of $5,821. In the Answer
Applicant wrote  that this tax  debt arose  because  he  filed  separately  from  his wife  in 2019.
He has refiled  an  amended  joint return with  his wife. When  his return  was filed, he  paid
taxes due  per the amended  return  of $613. Shortly  before the  hearing  he  paid additional
state  tax  in the  amount of  $4,048, which is the  amount he  calculated  after the  state  makes
an   adjustment  of   over  $6,000.  The   state   has  not   yet  determined   if  Applicant’s  recent
payment satisfies his tax obligations. (Answer at 2;  Tr. at 76-79.)
1.e  Delinquent  county  property  tax  debt  for TY  2019 in  the  approximate  amount  of
$204.  Applicant did  not receive  the  county  tax  bill  for one  year on  a  timeshare he  owns.
He  became  aware of  the  tax  delinquency  when  he  received  the  SOR  and paid this debt
on June  9, 2022. (Answer at 2; Tr. at 79-81; GE 4;  AE  G.)
