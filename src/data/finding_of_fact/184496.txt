In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, she admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a-e and g-h. She denied
SOR ¶ 1 f. Her admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and
careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the  following  additional
findings of fact.
Applicant is 61 years old. She has been working full time as an accountant for a
federal contractor since December 2019. She was awarded a master’s degree in 2002.
She married in 1981 and has two adult children. (Item 3 at 16, 15-16, and 36.) She first
held a security clearance in 1983. (Item 7 at 6.)
Applicant states the  debts  were primarily  due  to  her and  her husband’s medical
conditions. (Item 2 at 3.) She states she has been unable to get a higher paying job after
leaving by mutual agreement a position she held for nine years with a government agency
in 2015. (Item 3 at 26.) In 2018, after a year with a company she left her position following
allegations of misconduct. (Item 7 at 6.) She notes her actions to reduce her expenses
by use of local social services, driving an older vehicle, and living in a low rent area. (Item
2 at 3 and Item 6 at 11.)
The SOR alleges eight delinquent debts that are established by two credit reports
from  March  2022  (Item  4),  April  2020  (Item  5),  and  her  answers  to  the  July  2021
interrogatories  (Item  6).  Applicant,  with  the  exception  of  SOR  ¶  1.f,  admitted  each
allegation and stated she did not have the funds to pay these accounts. The evidence
concerning these debts is summarized below.

she and her husband had entered into a foreclosure agreement. (Item 2 at 3 and Item 7
at 9.)
