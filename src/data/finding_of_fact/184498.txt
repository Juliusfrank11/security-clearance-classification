has  three  children--two  minors  and  one  adult.  He  resided  in  state  A,  in  a  home  he
purchased, from October 2014 to March 2016. He lived in state B from March 2016 to
May 2017. He then resided in his home in state A from May 2017 to August 2021, when
he sold the home as part of his second divorce. As of his December 2021 background
interview, he lived in state C since September 2021. (Answer; Form Response; Items 3,
4, 9)
Applicant obtained his high school diploma in 1994. He earned a certificate from
a college of aeronautics and technology in April 2014 and an associate degree in June
2019.  He  was  consistently  employed  since  2007,  but  he  voluntarily  resigned  in  April
2017  from  a  managerial  position  that  he  had  held  since  September  2014.  As  of  his
December 2021 background interview, he worked for his employer, a DOD contractor,
since September 2021. He has never held a security clearance. (Items 3, 4, 9)
The SOR and amended SOR allege that Applicant had six delinquent consumer
debts totaling $39,894,  a  state  tax warrant  entered against  him  by state  D in  2017 for
$3,513, and a state tax lien entered against him by state B in 2018 for $1,176 (SOR ¶¶
1.a-1.h).  Applicant  listed  and  discussed  his  delinquent  debts  on  his  November  2018
security clearance application (SCA) and during his January 2019 and December 2021
background  interviews.  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.f  are  reported  on  credit  bureau  reports
from  September  2021  and  April  2022.  Court  documents  reflect  the  state  B  tax  lien  in
SOR ¶ 1.h and the state tax warrant in SOR ¶ 1.g. (Items 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
Applicant attributes his financial issues to his second spouse’s overspending, his
second divorce, and the consequent child-care expenses for his two minor children.  In
addition,  he  experienced  a  decrease  in  income  after  he  voluntarily  resigned  from  his
managerial  position  in  April  2017,  as  previously  discussed.  He  again  experienced  a
decrease  in  income  due  to  reduced  work  as  a  result  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  His
finances were further affected when he relocated from state A to state C in September
2021 for employment. (Answer; FORM Response; Items 3, 4, 9)
Applicant  stated  in  his  SCA  and  during  his  January  2019  background  interview
that  he  began  working  with  a  credit  counseling  service  (Company  A)  to  resolve  his
outstanding  debts.  He  entered  into  a  debt  repayment  plan  with  Company  A  in
November 2018,  of  $295  monthly for  77  months,  to  resolve  his outstanding  debts.  He
did  not  provide  documentation  to  show that  he  made  any  payments  into  his  plan  with
Company  A.  He  indicated  during  his  December  2021  background  interview  that  he
retained  a  debt  settlement  law  firm  (Company  B)  to  assist  him  with  contacting  his
creditors,  negotiating  settlements,  and  facilitating  his  payments  after  settlement.  He
stated in his Answer and FORM Response that he mistakenly believed that Company A
and  Company  B  would  assist  him  with  resolving  his  outstanding  debts.  He  hired  an
attorney  in  July  2022  to  assist  him  with  contacting  his  creditors  and  negotiating
settlements, as further discussed below. (Answer; FORM Response; Items 3, 4, 9, 10)
SOR  ¶   1.a   is  for  a   $9,796   collection   account.   Applicant   indicated   during   his
December 2021  background  interview  that he  believed  this debt  was related  to  SOR  ¶
1.c.  He did not provide  documentation  to  corroborate  his claim.  He  stated  in his Answer
that   he   was  working   with   the   creditor  to   verify   this  debt.  As   of  July   2022,   his  attorney
was assisting him with resolving this debt.  (Answer; FORM Response; Item 4)

and  offered  the  creditor  a  settlement  of  $5,000,  payable  at  $208  monthly  over  24
months.  There  is  no  evidence  that  the  creditor  accepted  Applicant’s  offer.  (Answer;

personal  purchases.  He  stated  in  his Answer  and  FORM  Response  that  he  contacted

state  D  in  2017,  and  the  $1,176  tax  lien  entered  against  him  in  2018  by  state  B.
Applicant’s admissions and the court records are the only evidence in the record of the
tax  warrant  and  the  tax  lien.  Applicant  indicated  during  his  January  2019  background
interview that he received a letter in approximately January 2019 informing him that he
owed approximately $1,400 in back taxes. He did not indicate which state informed him
of his back taxes.  He indicated that he was unaware that he owed back taxes until he
received  this letter,  and  that  he  planned  to  set  up  a  payment  plan to  resolve  his back
taxes.  He  did  not  provide  any  documentation  of  his  efforts  to  resolve  SOR  ¶  1.g.
Although he stated in his FORM Response that he paid $1,786 toward SOR ¶ 1.h and
he intended to continue to pay his remaining balance, he did not provide documentation
to corroborate his claim. (FORM Response; Items 7, 8, 9)
Applicant  indicated  during  his  December  2021  background  interview  that  his
monthly net income was $5,200 since he began working for his employer in September
2021.  After  expenses,  his  monthly  net  remainder  was  approximately  $400,  which  he
sets  aside  as  savings  to  utilize  to  resolve  the  settlements  reached  for  his  debts.  He
received his aviation mechanic certificate in 2012. (Items 3, 4)
