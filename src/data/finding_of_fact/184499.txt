In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  in  the  typed  portion,  he  admitted  all  11
allegations  under  Guideline  F,  and  denied  the  allegation  under  Guideline  E.  His
admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 28-year-old cable technician for a defense contractor. He has worked
for the company since February 2021. He served honorably in the U.S. Navy from August

the military, but did not earn a degree. (FORM Item 3 at 7, 21-22, 38-38, 24, and 14.)
Applicant’s  11  delinquent  debts  total  $23,356  and  have  been  charged  off  or
referred  for  collection.  The  debts  are  established  by  an  October  2021  credit  report;  a
November 22, 2021 PSI; and his Answer. (FORM Items 5 and 4.) The specific debts in

Applicant  stated  in  his  PSI  that  his  financial  situation  “sucks”  and  needed
improvement.  He  explained  he  got  into  financial  trouble  while  on  active  duty  but  had
started to improve his financial situation by 2014. He cites his marriage for the decline in
his  financial  situation.  (FORM  Item  4  at  4.)  The  offered  documented  evidence,  AE2,
shows  no  evidence  of  a  repayment  plan  or  that  he  had  disputed  the  debts  with  his
creditors. He expressed hope that he would have his financial situation under control by
Spring 2022. (FORM Item 4 at 4.)
The  Guideline  E  allegation  stems  from  his  failure  to  include  any  of  the  debts
addressed above on his SCA. As noted, Applicant discussed the events in his PSI and
disclosed he had several accounts that gone into collection. (FORM Item 4 at 4.) In his
Answer  he  admitted  he  did  not  include  them  but  stated  it  was  a  mistake.  When  he
submitted his SCA, he answered “No” to all the questions regarding delinquent debts. In
his  Answer  he  handwrote:  “I failed  to  fill out the  entire  credit debit section  by  accident
believing  I  was  done  without  checking  I  submitted  the  application  incomplete.  I  never
intended on hiding this information.” He added in a typed section of his Answer that his
failure to disclose his financial information was due to a lack of attention to detail on his
part. He stated: “This was a major oversite [sic] on my part, I never intended to withhold
or  hide  any  of  the  information  requested  from  the  e-QIP  as  I  also  disclosed  in  my
interview.” In AE1 he reiterated he never intended to hide any information and his failure
to include his financial debt was “due to a lack of attention” on his part.
