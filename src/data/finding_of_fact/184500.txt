Applicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for
her current employer since July 2022. She worked for another employer from May 2019
until she was laid off because she did not have a security clearance. She is applying for
a security clearance for the first time. She attended college off and on since 1989. She
earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2006.  She  married  in  2002  and  divorced  in  2005.  She
has a 19-year-old child. (Tr. at 55-56, 62-67, 74; GE 1; AE H)
The SOR alleges two defaulted student loans totaling about $85,000; four unpaid
judgments totaling about $16,500; five delinquent medical debts totaling about $1,850;
three  miscellaneous  delinquent  debts  totaling  about  $2,000;  and  failure  to  file  her
federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2016 and 2018. Except as addressed
below,  the  allegations  are  established  through  credit  reports,  court  records,  and
Applicant’s admissions.
Applicant  attributed  her  financial  problems  to  her  2005  divorce  after  her  ex-
husband  abandoned  her  and  their  infant  child,  and  he  did  not  pay  child  support.  She
has ongoing health issues that at times prevented her from working. She had surgeries
in  2021  and  2022.  Her  child  also  had  health  problems  when  he  was  about  two  years
old,  resulting  in  nine  days  in  the  hospital,  followed  by  home  treatment,  during  which
Applicant  was  unable
to  work.  She  had  periods  of  unemployment  and
underemployment. (Tr. at 21-23, 77-81, 101, 131; GE 1, 2; AE H)
Applicant did not file her federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2016
and 2018 during the normal period. She submitted a Questionnaire for National Security
Positions (SF 86) in March 2019. She reported a number of delinquent debts, including
her  defaulted  student  loans,  unpaid  medical  debts,  a  judgment,  and  other  delinquent
debts. She also reported that she had not filed her 2016 income tax returns.  She wrote
that she missed the due date. The 2018 returns were not yet due. (GE 1)
Applicant  was  interviewed  for  her  background  investigation  on  April  23,  2019.
She  stated  that  she  did  not  receive  a  W-2  from  her  employer  for  2016.  She  told  the
investigator that she filed her 2016 and 2018 income tax returns in April 2019. (GE 2)
Applicant  replied  to  interrogatories  from  the  Defense  Office  of  Hearings  and
Appeals  in  February  2020.  She  reported  that  she  had  not  filed  her  2016  and  2018
federal and state income tax returns. She stated that she prepared the 2018 returns and
gave them to her mother to mail, but her mother never mailed them. She stated that she
would file the returns when she filed her 2019 returns. She also indicated that there was
a  problem  with  her  2017  taxes  because  her  former  employer  incorrectly  submitted  a
1099  form  for  an  auto  loan,  which  increased  Applicant’s  tax  liability  for  2017.  She
indicated  that  she  contacted  the  employer  to  correct  the  1099.  She  stated  that  if  the
employer  did  not  correct  the  1099,  the  IRS  would  investigate  the  employer  for
submitting a fraudulent 1099. (Tr. at 87-89; GE 2)
Applicant responded to the SOR in December 2020. She admitted that she had
not  filed  her  2016  and  2018  federal  and  state  income  tax  returns.  She  wrote:  “I  have
contacted the IRS regarding these tax years in February 2020 to rectify the situation, my
taxes have been placed on hold due to a discrepancy from my previous employer who
fraudulently claimed a $6,200 car loan as taxable work hours – once solved I can re-file
my taxes.”
Applicant  testified  that  she  filed  her  2016  and  2018  tax  returns  in  about
September or October 2021. She stated that she did not think that she was required to
file  a  return  if  she  was  due  a  refund.  An  IRS  account  transcript  shows  that  the  IRS
received  her 2018 tax return in  October 2021.  Her total income was  $11,577,  and her
adjusted gross income was $11,222. Because her gross income for 2018 was less than
$12,000, she was not required to file a federal tax return for that year. (IRS Publication
501 for 2018) The same is true for her state return. She would have been due a refund
of $541, but it was withheld and applied towards her federal taxes owed for 2017. She
stated  that  she  still owed  the  IRS  about  $2,500  and  some  amount  to  her  state  for  tax
year 2017.1 (Tr. at 26-40, 82-86, 92-96; AE A, C)
Applicant  submitted  an  IRS  wage  and  income  transcript  for  tax  year  2016.  A
wage and income transcript is a different document than an account transcript, which is
what  she  submitted  for  tax  year  2018.  Her  wages,  tips,  and  other  compensation  was
$31,123, so she was required to file an income tax return. She testified that she would
have  been  due  a  refund  of  $3,067  if  she  filed  on  time.  Any  refund  she  would  have
received was forfeited because the return was not filed within three years of the normal
filing date. Applicant was  informed at her hearing that the wage  and income transcript
did  not  show  that  she  filed  a  return.  She  held  up  what  was  apparently  a  2016  return.
She  was  told  that  she  could  submit  proof  after  the  hearing  that  she  filed  her  2016
returns.  She  submitted  a  document  from  the  IRS  showing  that  the  balance  due  (likely
from  2017)  was  $1,848.  After  receipt  of  her  post-hearing  documents,  she  was  again
informed  that  she  did  not  submit  proof  that  she  filed  her  2016  returns.  She  did  not
submit any additional documents  proving that she filed the 2016 returns. (Tr. at 26-27,
33-34, 84-85; AE A, B, I, S-U)
A  default  judgment  of  $198  plus  $56  costs  was  entered  against  Applicant  on
behalf of a fitness club in October 2011 (SOR ¶ 1.c). She stated that she unaware of the
debt until she received the SOR. She attempted to contact the company to pay the debt,
but  the  business  had  changed  hands,  and  the  new  owner  was  not  in  a  position  to
accept payments. (Tr. at 97-99; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3)
Applicant was sued for unlawful detainer in February 2016. A default judgment of
$2,746, plus $700 attorney fees, and $178 costs and other fees was entered against her
on behalf of a landlord in March 2017 (SOR ¶ 1.e). She stated that she gave 60 days’
1  The  SOR  did not  allege  that Applicant owed taxes. Any  matter that  was  not  alleged  in  the  SOR  will  not
be   used  for  disqualification   purposes.   It  may   be  considered  for  its   effect  on   Applicant’s   finances,  when

analysis.
notice to the landlord, and she was unaware of the judgment, but she was attempting to
arrange a payment plan. (Tr. at 24-25, 105-110; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3; AE
H)
Applicant was sued for unlawful detainer in October 2017. A default judgment of
$1,900, plus $700 attorney fees, and $149 costs and other fees was entered against her
on behalf of a landlord  in November 2017 (SOR  ¶ 1.d). She stated  in her response to
the  SOR  that  she  contacted  the  court,  and  the  plaintiff  in  the  case  “retracted  and  the
judgement has been dismissed.” Court records show that a garnishment was dismissed
in  January  2018  because  of  “No  Funds.”  She  later  realized  that  the  garnishment  was
dismissed,  but  not  the  judgment.  In  her  post-hearing  documents,  Applicant  provided
account  information  on  where  her  payments  will  be  sent,  but  no  evidence  that  any
payments had been sent. (Tr. at 100-106; Applicant’s response to SOR; AE H, V)
Applicant  was  sued  for  unlawful  detainer  in  May  2018.  A  default  judgment  of
$9,450, plus  $59  costs,  and $945  in  other fees  was  entered  against  her in  June 2018
(SOR  ¶  1.f). She  stated  that  the home  had  significant problems,  and  she  withheld  the
rent, but she did not hold it in an escrow account. She stated that she intends to pay the
judgment. (Tr. at 110-113; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1-3; AE I, L)
Applicant defaulted on two student loans totaling about $85,000 (SOR ¶¶ 1.l and
1.m).  She  stated  that  she  had  not  paid  the  loans  since  2015.  Credit  reports  show the
last payments on the loans were made in August 2018. Her federal student loans were
placed on pause pursuant to COVID-19 relief. As such, she was not required to make
loan payments. The pause was extended several times. It is currently extended through
December  2022.  She  stated  that  she  plans  to  clear  up  everything  else,  and  then
aggressively  pay  her student  loans,  at  least  $1,500  a  month.  (Tr. at  31,  42-44,  66-74,
118-130; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 4, 5; AE A)
Applicant  or  her  insurance  provider  paid  six  delinquent  medical  debts  totaling
about  $2,400  in  August  2020  and  December  2020.  The  two  largest  medical  debts
alleged  in the  SOR  (¶¶  1.g - $749 and  1.k  - $549)  were  paid. It  is unclear if  the other
paid debts were the ones alleged in the SOR. However, no other medical debts appear
on the recent credit reports, so I find that all of the medical debts alleged in the SOR are
resolved. (Tr. at 50-54, 114-117; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 4-6; AE A, M, N)
SOR  ¶¶  1.n  ($1,340)  and  1.o  ($480)  allege  debts  owed  to  the  same  collection
company  for  the  same  bank.  Applicant  settled  and  paid  both  debts.  (AE  G  for  the
$1,340  debt  and  AE  J  for  the  $480  debt).  It  is  unclear  when  the  debts  were  paid,  but
they  were  still  listed  on  the  December  2019  credit  report.  Applicant  reported  the  $480
debt  as  paid  when  she  responded  to  the  SOR.  Her  account  statement  from  the
collection company is dated May 29, 2022. It reflects that the account was paid, but it
does not indicate when it was paid. In her SOR response, Applicant indicated that she
settled the $1,340 debt  for $818, with  $40 monthly payments. She wrote  that she had
about $500 still to pay. Her documentation from the collection company showed that the
settlement amount was paid in full no later than April 27, 2022.  (Tr. at 50-53, 130-132;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 4-6; AE A, G, F, I, J, M-R)
Applicant asserted that she paid the $191 delinquent debt owed to an insurance
company  (SOR  1.p).  The  debt  is  reported  by  TransUnion  on  the  April  2019  combined
credit  report.  It  is  not  reported  on  the  later  Equifax  credit  reports.  (Tr.  at  132-133;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 4-6)
Applicant  stated  that  her  finances  have  improved.  Her  current  credit  report  is
clean, and she was able to buy a home. She has not received financial counseling, but
she  maintains  a  written  budget.  She  owns  her  car  outright  without  a  loan.  She  stated
that she would receive a $5,000 raise if  she receives a security clearance. She stated
that she plans to pay all of her debts. (Tr. at 25, 41, 75, 133-141; AE A, H)
Applicant submitted a letter attesting to her excellent job performance and moral
initiative,  and
