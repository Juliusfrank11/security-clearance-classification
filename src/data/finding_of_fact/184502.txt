Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶  1.a  and  denied  SOR  ¶¶  1.b,  2.a,  and  3.a.  He  is  51
years  old.  He  is  married  to  a  Kyrgyzstan-born,  naturalized  U.S.  citizen.  He  has  four
children,  one  is  an  adult  from  a  previous  relationship  who  is  a  citizen  and  resident  of
Germany, and three are minors from his marriage who are solely U.S. citizens residing
with Applicant and his spouse. (Answer; Tr. at 16; GE 1, 2)
Applicant was born and raised in the United States. His parents and two siblings
were  also  born  in  and  reside  in  the  United  States.  He  graduated  from  high  school  in
1989, he  earned  a  bachelor’s degree  in  2001, and he took classes toward but had not
yet earned  a  master’s  degree.  He served honorably in the U.S.  Army from September
1991 to August 1997; in the National Guard from August 2001 to September 2002; and
in the Reserve from August  2001 to October 2003. He has since worked  overseas for
various DOD contractors, with the exception of two periods of unemployment from June
2012 to March 2013 and April 2014 to February 2015. As of the date of the hearing, he
worked  overseas  in  information  technology  for  his  employer,  a  DOD  contractor,  since
December 2016. He was first granted a DOD security clearance in 1991. (Answer; Tr. at
5-6, 16-20, 63-67, 74-76; GE 1, 2)
Applicant’s  43-year-old  spouse  was  born  in  Kyrgyzstan.  When  she  was  in  high
school  or  college,  she  fulfilled  her  mandatory  one-year  service  with  the  Kyrgyzstan
military.  She  does  not  have  any  other  affiliations  with  the  Kyrgyzstan  military  or
government. When Applicant worked in Kyrgyzstan between 2003 and 2011, he met his
spouse there in 2004, through a mutual friend. They married in Kyrgyzstan in 2009. She
became a naturalized U.S. citizen and  was issued a U.S. passport in May 2010.  They
married  in  the  United  States  in  2013,  because  the  foreign  country  in  which  Applicant
worked at the time did not accept his Kyrgyzstan marriage certificate. Their two eldest
children were born in Kyrgyzstan, and their youngest child was born in another foreign
country where Applicant worked at the time. As previously discussed, all three children
are solely U.S. citizens, residing with Applicant and his spouse. Throughout the duration
of   their   marriage,  and   as  of   the   date   of   the   hearing,  Applicant’s  spouse   worked   on   a
U.S.  military   base.  She   is  aware  that  Applicant  works  in  information   technology   and
holds   a   security   clearance.   Applicant  has   discussed   with   her  the   importance   of  not
sharing  this information  with  anyone. (Answer; Tr. at  15-16, 20-25, 48-51,  63-74, 79-81;
GE 1, 2)
Foreign Influence
Applicant’s  elderly  father-in-law  and  mother-in-law  are  citizens  and  residents  of
Kyrgyzstan.  They  are  78  and  73  years  old,  respectively.  Applicant’s  father-in-law  is  a
retired  taxi  driver  and  his  mother-in-law  is  a  retired  factory  worker.  Now  farmers  in  a
rural  area,  they  own  the  home  in  which  they  live.  They  receive  a  pension  of
approximately  $200  monthly,  but  they  do  not  have  any  other  affiliation  with  the
Kyrgyzstan government. (Answer; Tr. at 20-29, 48-52, 60-74, 76-79, 81-89; GE 1, 2)
For a brief period in 2011, Applicant’s spouse  and  their two eldest children lived
with  her  parents  in  Kyrgyzstan,  while  Applicant  worked  in  a  country  that  was  not
conducive to his family joining him. He then moved with his family to the United States
in  2011.  He  and  his  family  traveled  to  Kyrgyzstan  to  visit  his  parents-in-law  in  2011,
twice in 2012, and in 2019. (Answer; Tr. at 20-29, 48-52, 60-74, 76-79, 81-89; GE 1, 2)
Applicant’s  spouse  has  weekly  telephonic  contact  with  her  parents.  Applicant
occasionally  talks  with  his  parents-in-law,  on  birthdays  and  during  holidays,  when  his
spouse  talks  to  her  parents.  His  spouse  usually  translates  for  him  since  he  speaks
minimal  Russian.  Applicant  manages  the  finances  in  his  household,  and  he  and  his
spouse gift her parents approximately $100 to $200 for their birthdays. Applicant stated
that his parents-in-law do not know what he does for a living. He testified that he would
report to the U.S. authorities any attempt by anyone in Kyrgyzstan to exploit his parents-
in-law  for  information  about  him.  He  has  complied  with  his  employer’s  reporting
requirements  for  foreign  contacts.  (Answer;  Tr.  at  20-29,  48-52,  60-74,  76-79,  81-89;
GE 1, 2)
Applicant has never owned property in Kyrgyzstan. When he met his spouse, she
lived  in  a  studio  apartment  in  Kyrgyzstan  gifted  to  her  by  her  parents.  She  and  her
parents  sold  this  property  for  approximately  $25,000  USD.  They  used  the  proceeds
from the sale, along with $25,000 USD that Applicant gave to his spouse, to purchase a
one-bedroom  apartment  in  Kyrgyzstan  in  September  2010  for  $55,000  USD.  This
property is solely  in  Applicant’s  mother-in-law’s name.  His  parents-in-laws  rent  out  the
apartment  and  use  the  rental  income,  of  approximately  $200  monthly,  for  living
expenses. (Answer; Tr. at 20, 25-26, 29, 51-60, 81-89; GE 1, 2)
Applicant’s spouse does not have any intention to manage  her parent’s property
in  Kyrgyzstan  once  her parents are  unable to  do  so.  Neither Applicant  nor his spouse
have any financial interest in this property. Applicant anticipates that his brother-in-law,
who  is  a  citizen  and  resident  of  Kyrgyzstan,  will  assume  those  responsibilities.
Applicant’s  spouse  has  minimal  contact  with  her  brother.  Applicant  is  unsure  what  his
brother-in-law  does  for  a  living,  but  stated  that  he  is  not  affiliated  with  the  Kyrgyzstan
government or military and he helps his parents on their farm. (Answer; Tr. at 20, 25-26,
29, 51-60, 81-89; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  listed  in  his  March  2017  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  that  he
purchased a home in the United States in April 2014. He resided in this home from April
2014  until  March  2015.  His  brother  occasionally  lived  in  this  home  while  Applicant
worked  overseas.  It  is  unclear  from  the  record  if  Applicant  still  owns  this  home.  The
record does not contain any evidence of any other U.S.-based assets. (GE 1)
Misuse of Information Technology and Personal Conduct
In  June  2016,  Applicant  downloaded  and  viewed  pornographic  material  on  his
corporate laptop in violation of  company policy. He had been working  overseas for his
then-employer, as a federal systems technologist, since approximately January 2015. At
the time of the incident, he was away from his spouse; his personal laptop was broken;
and  he  used  his  work  laptop  to  download  and  view  pornography  at  his  spouse’s
suggestion while she was on the phone with him. Although he had previously used his
work  laptop  for  personal  reasons,  this  was  the  only  instance  in  which  he  did  so  for
pornography.  He  did  not  engage  in  this  activity  over  a  U.S.  Government  network.  His
supervisor  notified  him  in  November  2016  that  he  violated  company  policy  by
downloading  inappropriate  material  on  his  company  computer,  and  he  accepted  his
supervisor’s offer to  resign  in lieu of termination. His employer kept him on board until
they found his replacement in December 2016. (Answer; Tr. at 15-16, 19, 26-48, 66-67,
89-107; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  disclosed  this  information  to  his  spouse,  on  his  SCA,  and  during  his
October  2017  background  interview.  Although  he  used  his  work  laptop  and  personal
laptop  interchangeably,  he acknowledged  that  he  exercised bad  judgment  in using his
work laptop to download and view pornography and he should have known better since
he  works  in  information  technology.  He  did  not  have  any  previous  incidents  of
unauthorized use of  information technology,  and  as of  the date of the hearing,  he had
not  had  any  subsequent  such  incidents.  He  received  bi-annual  training  from  his
employer on the rules governing the use of his work computer, and he was aware that
his employer prohibited  personal use  of his work computer.  (Answer; Tr. at 15-16, 19,
26-48, 66-67, 89-107; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  earned  various  information  technology  certificates,  to  include  his
CISCO certified network associate routing and switching in 2019. He provided letters of
support  from  three  individuals  who  attested  to  his  trustworthiness,  reliability,  and
judgment. One individual, a retired Lieutenant Commander from the U.S. Navy, came to
know  Applicant  in  2016,  when  Applicant  served  under  his  department  in  providing
classified  and  unclassified  network  support  to  military  warfighters.  They  subsequently
became  colleagues  in  2017,  and  he  associated  with  Applicant  professionally  and
personally. The other two individuals were colleagues who have known Applicant since
2016 and 2019, respectively. (Answer)
