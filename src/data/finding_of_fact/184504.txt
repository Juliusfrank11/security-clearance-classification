Applicant  is  a  52-year-old  aircraft  mechanic  for  a  Government  contractor,
employed since 2018. In 2015, she was laid off from her job while her youngest son was
living at home. She supplemented her income with unemployment insurance and a lower-
paying job. She did not complete high school. She married in 1987 and divorced in 2005.
She  again  married  in  2016  and  divorced  in  2018.  She  has  three  adult  children.  She
reported receiving a security clearance in 2005 or later.
The  SOR  alleges  under  Guideline  F  that  Applicant  has  ten  delinquent  debts
including  loans,  a  mortgage,  legal  fees,  credit  cards,  a  medical  debt,  and  a  telephone
service account totaling over $25,000 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.j). Applicant admitted all of the
debts  with  some  explanations,  except  she  denied  a  small  credit  account  (SOR  ¶  1.j),
claiming  it  was  paid.  The  evidence  submitted  by  the  Government  supports  the  SOR
allegations.
SOR ¶ 1.a is a personal loan that was originally a $30,000 auto loan in her son’s
name. She refinanced the loan in her name to help him, but could not afford the payments
after she was laid off. The car was sold in 2016, and the balance was partially paid off.
The loan was converted to a personal loan for $8,715. There is no evidence that Applicant
has made any payments on the loan since 2016, and it was charged off. Applicant testified
that in about late summer 2022, she started making $25 payments every two weeks on
the loan after speaking to a Government investigator about her security clearance. She
claimed she would provide documentation of the repayment agreement with the creditor
and proof of payments, but nothing was submitted after the hearing.
SOR ¶ 1.b is a credit union line of credit collection account for $7,672. Applicant
used the loan for home repairs in about 2015. She initially made payments, but stopped
in 2016. She spoke with a credit union representative in 2019 and October 2022, who
demanded payment in full. She does not have the funds to pay the debt.
SOR ¶ 1.c is a past-due mortgage that incurred late fees totaling $3,214. Applicant
testified that she began making payments in October 2021 and is paying an extra $25 per
month toward her late fees. Her recent credit report shows the account is now up to date.
SOR ¶ 1.d is a credit union personal loan that has been charged off for $2,792.
Applicant testified that she was able to arrange a repayment plan about six months ago,
and began making $25 payments every two weeks, beginning about four to five months
ago.  She  has  not  provided  documentary  evidence  of  a  repayment  plan  or  regular
payments on the plan.
SOR  ¶  1.e  is  a  telephone  account  debt  for  $766.  Applicant  claims  her  new
telephone carrier was to pay off this account when she switched, but failed to do so. She
disputed the account several years ago, and it is no longer reflected in her current credit
report.
SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.g include an attorney-fee debt for $677 and a medical debt for
$528. Appellant agreed to accept an attorney’s services to  assert an unclaimed money
account.  She  received  about  $2,000  in  2016,  but  failed  to  pay  the  attorney’s  fee.  The
medical debt resulted from a surgery in 2005, but she has taken no action to resolve the
debt.
SOR ¶¶ 1.h, 1.i, and 1.j are charged-off credit accounts. Applicant testified that she
paid  the  accounts  after  she  answered  the  SOR,  but  has  not  provided  documentary
evidence of payments or other actions to resolve the accounts.
Applicant claimed to have received financial counseling in 2019 from a credit repair
service. The counselor did not assist her with a budget, but she claims she currently has
a  written  budget.  She  did  not  submit  a  copy  of  the  budget  or  evidence  of  financial
counseling, despite the opportunity granted to her after the hearing. She has no savings
and about $417 in checking accounts. She owns a home valued at about $310,000, with
a remaining mortgage balance of about $50,000. She is preparing her home to eventually
offer for lease or sale. She rents another home for $650 per month. She claims to have
about $300 in a net monthly remainder. She contributes toward her youngest son’s tuition
and pays his car insurance.
