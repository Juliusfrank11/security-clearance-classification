Applicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He completed high
school  in  1993,  and  has  attended  college  on  and  off  through  the  years,  accumulating
about 60 college credits. (Tr. 5, 6) He enlisted in the military in 1993 and served on active
duty until October 2012. He was honorably retired as an E-7. (Tr. 20 - 21) While in the
service, he held a top-secret clearance that was continued after his retirement. Applicant
stated he had an impeccable record during his service. (Tr. 7, 8, 22)
Applicant married his first wife in 1998 and divorced in 2003. He has a son, age
23, of this marriage. His ex-wife was born in the Philippines. He maintains limited contact
with her, mostly to discuss issues concerning their son.
Applicant  married  his  current  wife  in  2013.  She  was  born  in  the  Philippines  to
Philippine parents. He met his wife in the United States while she was working in a retail
store. When they met, she was already a naturalized U.S. citizen. Her three children, ages
23, 28, and 30, were born in the Philippines. Her son and one daughter are living in the
United States. The second daughter is a resident of the Philippines. He testified he always
had limited contact and no father role with his wife’s children. (Tr. 22, 30 - 31; GE 1, 2)
In 2018, Applicant and his wife visited her relatives in the Philippines. This was his
first  visit  to  the  Philippines  and  met  her  father  and  children.  He  has  had  no  contact
(physical or verbal) with her father after the 2018 visit. Between 2013 and 2016, Applicant
provided  financial  assistance  (about  $250  per  month)  to  his  stepdaughters  in  the
Philippines. The money was to assist them with their expenses while in school. Applicant
has  not  provided  any  financial  assistance  to  his  stepdaughters  since  2016,  except  for
small presents during special occasions. He has provided limited financial assistance to
his  stepson  who  has  been  living  with  Applicant’s  son  while  in  college.  Two  of  his
stepchildren  are  currently  U.S.  residents.  He  does  not  know  whether  any  of  his
stepchildren are naturalized U.S. citizens.
Applicant testified that in 2019, he and his wife determined that their marriage was
not working out and they are considering a divorce. They stopped living together in April
2022 when their house rental contract ended. He is waiting for the statutory separation
period to lapse to file for divorce. (Tr. 32)
As amended, the SOR alleges that Applicant: is indebted to the IRS for $11,617
for tax year (TY) 2015 (SOR ¶ 1.a); failed to timely file his federal and state income tax
returns for TYs 2016, 2017, and 2018 (SOR ¶ 1.b); owed a bank $55,136 for a delinquent
2014  loan  (SOR  ¶  1.c);  and  owed  another  bank  $2,446  for  a  delinquent  credit-card
account (SOR ¶ 1.d). Under Guideline B, it alleges that his father-in-law (SOR ¶ 2.a) and
two stepchildren are citizens and residents of the Philippines, and that he provides $250
monthly in financial support to his stepchildren (SOR ¶ 2.b). He denied all of the financial
allegations and admitted the foreign influence allegations with explanations.
Applicant blames his wife for his financial problems and for him not filing his income
tax returns on time. He explained that while unemployed after his retirement, she would
withdraw $1,000 from their joint checking account without giving him prior notice. (Tr. 37
-38)  He  testified  that  she  refused  to  provide  him  with  documents  and  information  he
required to file his income tax returns, and refused to file income tax returns with him. (Tr.
83 – 84)
Concerning his TY 2015 debt to the IRS, Applicant explained his wife refused to
sign the income tax return as a joint return and he had to file as married filing separate.
The  change  in  filing  status  caused  an  increase  in  his  tax  liability.  In  March  2021,  he
convinced his wife to file amended income tax returns for TYs 2015 and 2017 as married
filing jointly, and he filed them both. He believes that when the IRS approves the amended
tax returns, his tax liability will be reduced.
According to Applicant and his accountant, he owes the IRS $1,456 for TY 2015;
he received a refund of $2,028 for TY 2017; he owes $2,190 for TY 2018; $6,978 for TY
2019;  and  $10,034  for  TY  2020;  for  a  total  balance  of  past  due  Federal  taxes  of
$18,639.00. (AE 5) For state A, Applicant owes $1,094 in income taxes for TY 2015; and
$1,525 for TY 2017. For state B, he owes $6,015 in income taxes for TY 2018; $3,254 for
TY 2019;  and  $1,850 for TY 2020.  (AE  5) Most  of  these facts  were  not alleged  in  the
SOR. As such, I will only consider these facts to determine the possible applicability of
the mitigating conditions.
Applicant  claimed  he  verified  the  balances  he  owes  per  TY  with  an  IRS
representative in August 2022. He stated he entered into a payment plan with the IRS
promising to pay a minimum of $500.00 each month. His intent is to pay $1,000.00 each
month to resolve his tax debt in the shortest period possible. As of his August 12, 2022
email, he had not received the approved IRS payment plan in the mail. He did not present
documentary evidence to corroborate the IRS accepted his TY 2015 amended income
tax return or that he has an IRS approved payment plan for his outstanding tax debt.
Applicant claimed that he timely filed his TYs 2018 and 2019 income tax returns
and the IRS rejected them because of problems with his TYs 2015 and 2017 income tax
returns. I note that the IRS Wage and Income Transcript for TY 2018 shows that as of
April 15, 2019, he had not filed his TY 2018 income tax return. Applicant’s documentary
evidence shows that his accountant filed his TYs 2018 and 2019 income tax returns in
March 2021. (See Answer to the SOR; Tr. 80 – 81; AE 5)
Applicant submitted an August 2022 letter from his accountant indicating that he
had just prepared Applicant’s income tax return for TY 2021. Applicant testified he did not
apply  for  or  receive  an  extension  to  file,  so  his  filing  would  be  late.  (Tr.  79  - 80)  The
accountant stated Applicant would owe the IRS $6,000 and his state $1,600 for TY 2021.
Applicant claimed he had saved $22,000 to pay his delinquent income taxes. He intended
to use $7,600 to pay his TY 2021 taxes, and reserved $14,400 to pay delinquent taxes
for  prior  years.  Applicant  presented  no  documentary  evidence  to  show  he  had  saved
$22,000 or that he paid his TY 2021 income taxes. (AE 5)
When  asked  why  it  took  him  so  long  to  address  his  delinquent  income  taxes,
Applicant claimed he had been addressing other delinquent debts first and did not have
the resources to pay all the debts at the same time. (Tr. 62) His current income is $94,000
a year. He has been earning over $90,000 a year since 2016. (Tr. 25 - 26) Additionally,
he  receives  $2,000  per  month  from  his  retired  pension  and  $1,200  per  month  from
disability pay. (Tr. 28)
SOR  ¶  1.c  alleged  that  Applicant  owed  a  bank  $55,136  for  a  delinquent  2014
consolidation loan. Applicant took the loan to consolidate debts that accumulated during
his  service.  He  retired  from  the  military  in  October  2014  and  was  not  able  to  find
employment until February 2015, which caused him to default on the loan. The creditor
obtained  a  judgment  against  Applicant  that  was  later  placed  for  collection  and  then
charged off. He settled the debt for $25,000 on May 13, 2021, after he received the SOR
in June 2020. (Tr. 54, 58; SOR Answer)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleged that Applicant owed a bank $2,446 for a delinquent joint credit-
card  account  he  opened  in  2012.  The  account  became  delinquent  in  2015,  and  was
charged off. Applicant contacted the creditor in May 2021, established a payment plan,
and paid it off in February 2022. (SOR Answer)
Applicant  stated  that  he  received  training  during  his  military  career  to  prevent
financial problems. Throughout his entire military career, Applicant knew how important it
was  to  maintain  good  credit  and  establish  a  track  record  of  financial  responsibility  to
maintain security clearance eligibility. (Tr. 23)
Applicant highlighted his military service and expressed his undivided loyalty to the
United States. He was deployed eight times with most of those deployments to combat
or dangerous zones in the Middle East. (Tr. 27) He credibly testified that his in-laws and
stepchildren in the Philippines could not be used to coerce or intimidate him into revealing
classified information, and that he would report any attempt to do so. (Tr. at 35, 40, 50-
51)
Applicant’s witness testified that he met Applicant six year ago at a cigar lounge
while smoking a cigar. He considers Applicant to be  a very close confidant and friend,
and he trusts him implicitly. He trusts Applicant with his life. He believes Applicant is a
patriot that he is loyal to the United States, and he would never betray the security of the
United States. (Tr. 92 – 93)
