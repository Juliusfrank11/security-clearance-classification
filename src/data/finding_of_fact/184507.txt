from 2003 until he was honorably discharged in 2007. He has worked continuously for
defense  contractors  on  the  same  military  installation  since  his  discharge  from  the

The   SOR  alleges   delinquent  credit  card   accounts  of   $50,843   and   $9,871.   The
debts are established through credit reports and Applicant’s admissions.
Applicant  accumulated  the  debts  up  through  about  2016,  when  he  stopped
paying  them.  He  admitted  that  he  made  poor  financial  choices  and  lived  beyond  his
means.  He  vacationed  in  foreign  countries  in  2010,  2011,  March  2013,  and  August
2013.  He  was  arrested  for  driving  under  the  influence  (DUI)  in  2013.1  He  had  to  pay
more  than  $10,000  in  fines  and  attorney  fees.  (Tr.  at  18-19,  24-25,  28-29;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 2-4)
Applicant  has  not  made  any  payments  toward  the  debts  since  2016.  He  stated
that he contacted the creditors several times, but their settlement offers were far more
than he could afford. He planned to pay the debts from the proceeds from the sale of his
condominium.  He  netted  about  $50,000  from  the  sale,  but  his  wife  was  unable  to  find
employment due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and they needed the money for expenses.
(Tr. at 14, 20, 23-28, 37-39; GE 2-4)
Except for the unpaid SOR debts, Applicant’s finances have improved. His wife is
working. He receives $301 per month in disability pay from the Department of Veterans
Affairs  (VA).  His  wife  maintains  a  budget  for  the  family.  He  has  not  accrued  any  new
delinquent debt. He has a surplus at the end of the month. He asserted that he plans to
resolve the two SOR debts. He has been saving money, which he hopes to use to settle
the debts. (Tr. at 13-17, 20-23, 26-36; GE 2-4)
