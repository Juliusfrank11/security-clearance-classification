Due   to   extensive   changes   to   the   original  SOR,  I  had   Applicant  confirm   at  the
hearing   her  admission   or  denial   to   the   remaining   SOR  allegations   alleged   under
Guidelines  J, G, F, and  E. She  admitted  SOR ¶¶  1.a, 1.d,  1.f,  1.g, 1.m, 1.n, 1.o,  1.t, 1.u,
1.y, 1.aa, 1.bb, 3.a  through  3.j, and  4.c.  She  denied   SOR ¶¶  1.l,  1.q, 1.v, 2.a, 3.k,  and
3.l. SOR ¶¶  1.b, 1.c,  1.e,  1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, 1.p, 1.r, 1.s,  1.w, 1.x, 1.z, 4.a, and  4.b  were
withdrawn.  SOR  ¶¶   1.aa,  and   1.bb   were  added   to   the   SOR.   Having   thoroughly
considered   the   evidence   in  the   record,  including   Applicant's  admissions,  I  make   the
following findings of  fact:  (Tr. 7-8, 11-14)
Applicant is 40 years old. She recently married in September 2022, and she has
two  daughters,  ages  14  and  16,  from  a  previous  relationship.  She  receives  $200
monthly in child support. She earned an associate’s degree in 2006. She began working
for  her  current  employer  in  November  2018.  She  started  out  as  a  customer  service
representative, and in 2021, she was promoted to a clinical support coordinator position
with  a  pay  increase.  Her  employer  requires  her  to  be  cleared  for  a  position  of  trust  to
perform specific employment duties. (GE 1; Tr. 27-30, 69)
The  SOR  alleged  approximately  25  incidents  of  criminal  conduct  and  rule
violations under Guideline J, as follows:
During the hearing, SOR ¶ 1.a. was determined to be a duplicate of SOR ¶ 1.aa.
It alleged an incorrect date of the same offense. (Tr. 30-33, 62-65; GE 1) The allegation
in SOR ¶ 1.a is mitigated.
Applicant was arrested in 2012 and again in 2017, for operating a motor vehicle
while under the influence of alcohol. (SOR ¶¶ 1.t, 1.u, and 1.aa.) She was found guilty
of both offenses, and she was required to go to an alcohol education class for the first
conviction,  and  a  multiple  offender  class  for  her  second  conviction.  Both  sentences
included a requirement that she install an interlock device on her car for one year, and
the court also restricted her driving privileges for one year. Applicant served five days in
jail for her second conviction. (Tr. 30-33, 51-58, 62-65; GE 2, GE 3, GE 8; AE A)
Applicant was arrested for disorderly conduct in 2013, 2014, 2015, and in 2018.
(SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.f, 1.m, and 1.y) She admitted these offenses and acknowledged she had
been drinking alcohol during some of these incidents, but she could not recall how much
alcohol. The SOR alleged two other incidents of  disorderly conduct in 2015 and 2017,
which  Applicant  denied,  and  she  provided  documentation  that  she  was  actually  the
“victim” in one of the disorderly conduct incidents. There was no evidence to support the
other denied allegation.  (SOR ¶¶ 1.l and 1.v) She admitted  that most of her disorderly
conduct  issues  stemmed  from  domestic  disputes  and  her  involvement  in  arguments
inside various bars. (Tr. 33-40, 43-47, 58- GE 2, GE 3, GE 4, GE 6, GE 7; AE A)
Applicant  was  cited  in  2014  for  being  a  passenger  in  a  motor  vehicle  with  an
open container. She was cited in 2015 for violation of a recreational fire pit regulation. In
July 2015, a warrant for her arrest was issued due to an unpaid fine. (SOR ¶¶ 1.g, 1.n,
and  1.o)  Applicant  admitted  these  offenses.  She  explained  that  she  frequently  had
bonfires in her backyard. The police requested she put out the fire because she did not
have a fire permit. She used a garden hose to put out the fire. She was later cited by
police  because  the  fire  re-started.  She  also  explained  that  she  forgot  to  pay  a  fine.
When she found out that a warrant had been issued, she immediately paid the fine. She
denied  that  she  had  been  issued  a  citation  for  speeding  in  December  2015,  and  the
Government  was  unable  to  provide  evidence  to  support  the  SOR  allegation.  (SOR  ¶
1.q.) (Tr. 40-43, 47-51; GE 5; AE A)
SOR ¶ 1.bb alleges that between March 2011 to September 2015, Applicant was
charged  on  13  occasions  with  operating  a  motor  vehicle  without  proof  of  insurance,
and/or operating a motor vehicle after license or registration was suspended or revoked.
Applicant admitted these allegations. She could not remember all of the details, but she
admitted  during  that  time  period,  she  could  not  afford  car  insurance,  and  she  was
immature and irresponsible. (Tr. 65-69; GE 9; AE A)
Paragraph  2  of  the  SOR  (Guideline  G  - Alcohol  Consumption)  cross-alleged
Applicant’s  2012  and  2017  arrests  for  operating  a  motor  vehicle  while  under  the
influence of alcohol. There is no new information cited under this Guideline. During the
hearing, Applicant stated she has taken steps to improve her quality of life. She moved
to  a  different  part  of  town,  and  no  longer  associates  with  her  old  friends.  She  rarely
drinks  alcohol  anymore,  and  her  spouse  does  not  drink  at  all.  At  the  most,  she  may
drink one or two beers twice a month. She rarely goes out and she is very busy with her
daughters’  after  school  activities.  Most  importantly,  she  has  matured  and  considers
herself a responsible adult. She has not been in any trouble since starting her job in late
2018. (Tr. 77-80, 82-84)
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged 12 delinquent accounts totaling $42,268, as
follows:
SOR  ¶¶  3.a  through  3.j  allege  Applicant  is  indebted  to  the  U.S.  Department  of
Education in the amount of $40,443 for ten unpaid student loans that had been referred
for  collection.  She  admitted  these  debts.  She  obtained  these  student  loans  to  pay  for
her  college  education.  After  graduation,  her  loans  were  placed  in  forbearance.  Once
she  was  employed  in  November 2018,  she  called  the  student  loan  creditor to  arrange
payments  to  be  deducted  directly  from  her  paycheck.  She  provided  documentation
which showed that beginning in June 2019, she had approximately $150 deducted from
each  paycheck  to  pay  her  student  loans.  In  March  2020,  the  payroll  deductions
automatically stopped due to the COVID-19 emergency relief for federal student loans.
The  student  loan  payment  pause  was  extended  through  December  31,  2022.  It  is
Applicant’s intention  to  resume  her student loan  payments beginning in January 2023.
She also stated that she has never had a tax refund intercepted due to non-payment of
student loans, and she always files her income tax returns on a timely basis. (Tr. 69-71,
75; AE D, AE E)
SOR ¶ 3.k alleges that Applicant is indebted to a cellular phone service account
that  was  referred  for  collection  in  the  amount  of  about  $1,600.  She  disputed  this  debt
because it was an account that belonged to her ex-boyfriend. She believed this account
was  successfully  disputed  because  this  account  is  no  longer  on  her  credit  report.  (Tr.
72; GE 10, GE 11)
SOR  ¶  3.l  alleges  that  Applicant  is  indebted  to  a  childcare  facility  account  that
was referred for collection in the amount of about $225. She disputed this debt because
at the time she was receiving support from the county to pay for her childcare expenses.
(Tr. 72; GE 10, GE 11)
Applicant  explained  that  she  developed  financial  issues  due  to  unemployment,
underemployment,  and  a  lack  of  maturity.  She  is  now  current  on  all  of  her  financial
accounts  and  denied  that  she  had  developed  any  new delinquent  debts.  She  has  two
more  car  loan  payments  before  her  car  loan  is  paid  in  full.  She  provided  a  personal
financial  statement  which  reflected  a  monthly  net  income  (including  the  $200  child
support) of approximately $2,700. She  is the only source of  income for the family. Her
spouse  was  employed  by  a  temp  agency,  but  his  work  assignment  was  recently
completed.  He  is  currently  unemployed,  and  he  is  not  receiving  any  unemployment
benefits while looking for another job. She is able to support the family with her income.
After  paying  their  monthly expenses,  she  has  a  net  remainder  of  approximately $800.
She  has  never  participated  in  a  consumer  counseling  program,  but  she  does  receive
assistance from her mom when she has any financial questions. (Tr. 72-74, 76, 85; AE
B, AE C)
Paragraph  4  of  the  SOR  (Guideline  E  –  Personal  Conduct)  cross-alleged
Applicant’s arrests and citations under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct). There is no new
information cited under this Guideline.
