Applicant  is  39  years  old,  unmarried,  and  has  no  children.  He  received  a  high
school  diploma  in  2001.  Applicant  has  been  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  as  a
fabricator since March 2020 and seeks to obtain national security eligibility and a security
clearance in connection with his employment. (Item 3 at Sections 1, 12, 13A, 17, and 18;
Item 4 at 1.)
Paragraph 1  (Guideline  F, Financial Considerations)
The Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is
financially  overextended  with  delinquent  debts  and  therefore  is  potentially  unreliable,
untrustworthy,  or  at  risk  of  having  to  engage  in  illegal  acts  to  generate  funds.  In  his
Answer,  Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations.  The  existence  and  amounts  of
these  debts  are  also  supported  by  Applicantâ€™s  disclosures  in  his  e-QIP  and  the  credit
reports in the record dated September 24, 2020, and March 21, 2020. (Items 1, 3, 5, and
6.)
