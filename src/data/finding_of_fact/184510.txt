Applicant is 37 years old. He earned a bachelor’s degree in computer engineering,
and master’s degrees in electrical engineering and business administration in 2007, 2009
and 2017, respectively. He married and had one child in 2018. He was employed by a
federal  contractor  from  June  2009  until  early  2021,  and  has  worked  for  his  current
employer since March 2021. He was granted a Secret clearance in September 2009 and
a Top Secret clearance in 2010. His security clearance was suspended in January 2016.
(GE 1, 2, 4, 5, 6; Tr. 12-13, 23-36)
Under Guideline  H,  the  SOR  alleges  that Applicant  used:  marijuana  from  2003  to
about February  2013, mushrooms  from  August 2003  to  2012, ecstasy  between  2007  and
2009,  and   cocaine   to   about  2013;   that  he   purchased   cocaine,  was  cited   for  THC
possession, and, after being  granted  access to  classified  information  in September 2009,
used  marijuana, mushrooms,  and  cocaine  (SOR ¶¶  2.a  –  2.g).  Under Guideline  E, the
SOR cross-alleges the  drug  involvement,  and  that  he  falsified  material facts  about that
drug  involvement on  security  clearance  applications  (SCA) executed  in 2009, 2010,  and
2014  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  –  1.f). Applicant  admitted  all SOR allegations.  (SOR Response; Tr. 15-
17) In  his response to  the SOR Applicant explained:
The  offenses  .  .  . occurred  a  minimum  of 7  years ago.  . . . were not  habitual
and  do  not indicate  dependency  . .  . .  were isolated  to  that period  of  time
and  associated  with  a more  adolescent and  immature  period  in my  life.  .  .  .
usually  occurred  with  college  friends  [and  those]  interactions  and  [special]
events have  been  eliminated  .  . .  and  are  no  longer a  part of my  life  style.  In
the  7  years since, I have  married  and  had  a  child  which has further changed
my priorities . . . social behavior [and] interactions with  [that]  social circle[.]
[With  respect to  the  Guideline  H allegations  he] provided  a  signed  statement
of   intent  to   abstain  from   drug   involvement  and   substance   misuse.   [With
respect to  the  Guideline  E  allegations]  I have  full[y] cooperated, was open,
was  honest,   and   voluntarily   provided   all   information   that   outlined   the
offense.  Again,  these  offenses were not  discovered  but  communicated  once
I understood the importance, severity, and consequences of my behavior.
In  August  2009  and  February  2010,  Applicant  submitted  SCAs  wherein  he
disclosed  that  he  had  used THC,  5-10  times,  from  approximately  January  2004  to
December 2006. He denied any other illegal use of drugs in the past seven years. In his
2010  SCA,  he  also  denied  using  controlled  substances  while  possessing  a  security
clearance.  In  his  November  2014  SCA,  Applicant  denied  illegally  using  controlled
substances  in  the  previous  seven  years  or  while  possessing  a  security  clearance.  He
reported  that  in  February  2013,  he  was  denied  or  not  granted  access  by  an  agency
because  “[p]assing  a  polygraph  was  required  for  access  [and]  I  did  not  pass  the
polygraph.” (GE 1 at 61-65, GE 2, GE 3)
During a July 2017 interview with a government investigator,  Applicant  reported
that he had failed a polygraph examination  in February 2013 because he had not fully
disclosed his substance misuse. He said that he had illegally used controlled substances
until  about  February  2013  and  had  not  recognized  the  seriousness  of  his  substance
misuse until the polygraph examination.  He admitted that he used marijuana 3-4 times
per year from 2003 to 2009 and 1-2 times per year from 2009 until about February 2013.
He also admitted that he used cocaine  on six different days  from about 2007 to 2013,
usually at  New  Year’s  Eve  gatherings  with  friends,  and that  he sometimes  contributed
money to purchase the cocaine. He said that he used ecstasy once in college, and used
mushrooms  three  times  from  about  2007  to  2012.  He  stated  that  he  used  marijuana
because he did not want to feel left out when his friends smoked, and that he used cocaine
because his friends were doing it and it seemed like fun. His responses to Interrogatories
and testimony were consistent with his disclosures to the background investigator. (GE 4
at 2-3, 10, 13-19; Tr. 32-35, 44-46)
Applicant  stated  that  he  has  not  illegally  used  controlled  substances  since  the
February 2013 polygraph. He said that  he has only seen his college friends at special
occasions like weddings since 2013, has not participated in drug use with them, declined
any drugs offered, and that they have not offered him drugs since he told them drug usage
was incompatible with his career. (GE 4 at 16; Tr. 39) He testified that he met his wife in
2012, that she disapproved of his drug use, and that he has been a different person since
meeting her, moving in together, getting married, and having a child. He has not received
drug treatment or counseling. (GE 4; Tr. 32-44)
Applicant  also  admitted  that  he  deliberately  falsified  his  2009,  2010,  and  2014
SCAs regarding his drug involvement. He said that he falsified information about his drug
use in his 2014 SCA because he had previously denied recent drug involvement including
drug  use  while  he  had  a  security  clearance,  and  because  he  did  not  believe  that
derogatory information that he had disclosed during the polygraph examination would be
shared with a different agency. He asserted that his acceptance of responsibility, lifestyle
changes, good character, desire to support the Defense community, experience, and the
passage of time supported granting him a security clearance. (GE 4; Tr. 27-54)
Applicant’s  supervisor  of  3.5  years,  who  participated  in  his  selection  for  a
management  position  after  his  security  clearance  was  suspended  in  2016  praised
Applicant’s  technical  and  organizational  skills,  leadership  ability,  and  commitment  to
product  quality.  He  also  characterized  him  as  “extremely  reliable,”  “completely
trustworthy, loyal to the United States, an asset to the defense community, [who] can be
completely  trusted  with  sensitive  information,” and  recommended  that he be granted a
security clearance. (AE A). Applicant’s wife, a medical doctor, noted that when they began
dating in  2012, he  was  socially  active  with  friends,  that  he  became  much  less  socially
active after they began living together in 2014, and that by 2018, when they married and
had a daughter, his outside social activity was rare. She said that she did not condone
his  past  drug  activities  and  had  no  indications  those  activities  continued  during  their
relationship.  She  also  attested  to  his  dedication  to  work  and  more  mature  social
behaviors. (AE B)
