Guideline H  - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
The Government alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances that
cause  physical  or  mental  impairment  or  are  used  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  their
intended purpose; and that he has engaged in conduct involving questionable judgment,
which can raise questions about an individual’s reliability and trustworthiness.
Applicant  began  working for his current employer in  2011.  He  is applying for a
security  clearance  for the  first  time.  As  part of  the  application  process,  he  completed
the  security  clearance  application  (SF-86)  dated  June  2,  2019.  In  the  application,  he
denied any illegal drug use.  During a subsequent subject interview, Applicant admitted
that  he  has  used  marijuana  on  a  regular  basis  since  2005,  and  that  he  answered  the
question on the application incorrectly.  (Government Exhibit 3.)
Applicant has used marijuana from about 2005 to at least July 2019 with varying
frequency.  Applicant  stated  that  he  smokes  on  average  between  five  to  ten  hits  from
the vape pen per weekly use.  He  further stated that he has never purchased,  sold or
manufactured  marijuana.  He  plans  to  continue  using  marijuana  for  recreational
purposes, unless he has to quit in order to obtain a security clearance.  Applicant stated
that his friends know that he smokes marijuana, but his parents do not.  He has never
received nor has ever felt the need to receive drug treatment or counseling of any sort.
(Government Exhibit 4.)
Applicant  also  stated  that  he  has  never  abused  any  other  kind  of  illegal  drugs
and has never abused prescription drugs or alcohol.  (Government Exhibit 4.)
