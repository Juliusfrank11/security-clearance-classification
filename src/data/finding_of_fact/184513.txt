Applicant  is  a  61-year-old  engineering  consultant  of  a  defense  contractor  who
seeks a security clearance. Admitted facts are adopted and incorporated by reference.
Additional findings of fact follow.
Background
Applicant  married  in  August  1984  and divorced  in  July 2009.  (GEs 1-2) He  has
two  children  and  one  stepchild  from  this  marriage.  He  remarried  in  August  2009  and
divorced  in  May  2020.  (GEs  1-2  and  AEs  A-C,  T-U,  and  X;  Tr.  41-42  and  48)  He
earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  electrical  engineering  in  August  1982  and  a  master’s
degree in December 1995. (GEs 1-3) Applicant reported no military service.
Since September 2021, Applicant has been continuously employed by his current
employer  as  a  subject  matter  expert  in  the  engineering  field.  (AE  V;  Tr.  62)  Between
April 2021 and September 2021 he  was employed by another defense  contractor. (Tr.
62-63) From September 2015 to February 2021, he was self-employed as an owner and
president  of  a  defense contracting firm  that  provided  engineering technical  services  to
companies in  the  defense  aerospace market.  (GEs  1-2; Tr.  55-56) Previously,  he  was
employed by other employers between March 2008 and September 2015. (GEs 1-2; Tr.
54-55) He has held a security clearance since June 1988.
Applicant’s finances
Between   2019   and   2020,   Applicant  accumulated   a   number  of   delinquent
accounts,  seven  in all  exceeding  $74,000.  (GEs 7-10  and  AE  V) His SOR-listed  debts
are  comprised  of the  following: SOR ¶¶  1.a  (for $725); 1.b  (for $467), 1.c (for $1,793);
1.d  (for $1,208); 1.e  (for $2,534);  1.f (for $68,175);  and  1.g  (for $1,888). (GEs 1-10)  His
debts   were  accumulated   during   a   difficult   financial   stretch   of  his   personal   business.
Compounding   his   business  losses  were  his   wife’s  appropriation   of   his  personal  and
business accounts prior to  filing  for divorce.   (GE  6  and  AE  X; Tr.56-58)  Upon  running
out  of   cash   to   operate   his  business   following   his  loss  of   a   DoD  contract  despite
investing   over $600,000  into  saving  the  contract, he  closed  it in  February  2021.  (Tr. 58-
61,  65-68)  Applicant’s  accumulated   debts   represent  both   business  and   personal
setbacks in income  flows from  his business and personal finances. (AE C; Tr.  56-61)
In March 2022, Applicant and his wife sold their home. (Tr. 54-55). Until recently,
he  has  been  unable  to  reach  any  of  the  proceeds  to  address  his  debts  due  to  holds
placed on the sale proceeds by several of his creditors. (Tr. 43-44, 51) Proceeds of sale
potentially available to him from the escrow total approximately $115,000. (AE R; 44-45.
117-118)  Once  the  sale  proceeds  were  released  to  him,  he  assured  he  could  pay  his
SOR debts (totaling $74,000). (Tr. 46) Some of these listed debts are business-related
debts associated with his start-up company; while some of the debts are personal debts
owned  by  Applicant  individually.  (Tr.  50-51,  67)  Mediation  proceedings  initiated  in  in
August 2021 between Applicant and his wife over rights to the escrowed sale proceeds
remained pending as of the date of the hearing. (AE D)
Since  the  hearing,  Applicant  has  addressed  his  SOR-listed  debt  delinquencies
with  documented  payoffs  and  a  well-documented  dispute  with  an  airport  authority
allegedly  responsible  for  his  airport-incurred  injuries  associated  with  his  $725  medical
debt covered by SOR ¶ 1.a. (AEs AA-BB) His post-hearing submissions document his
resolution of his  SOR 1.b debt with a payoff of $3,682 (AE CC). Debts covered by SOR
¶¶  1.c  and  1.d  were  resolved  by  respective  payments  in  full  of  the  account  balances
outstanding  with  the  creditors.  (AEs  DD  and  EE)  Applicant  was  able  to  work  out
payment  settlements  with  SOR  creditors  1.e  (AEs  FF  and  II-JJ)  and  1.f  (GG)  for
reduced amounts. And, he was able to resolve his delinquent SOR ¶ 1.g debt with a full
payoff of the account. (AE HH)
Additionally,  Applicant   documented  his bringing   his student  loan  and  other non-
SOR  accounts  current   and   settling   other  non-SOR  accounts.   (GEs  8-10   and   AEs  LL-
NN).  Applicant’s  previously   unresolved   debts  with   his  since-closed   business  were
successfully   resolved   by   settled   payouts.   (AEs  II-LL)   And,  he   has   an   installment
agreement in  place  with  the  Internal  Revenue  Service (IRS) to  cover  back  taxes due  for
tax  period  2009  and  itemized  in  the  Federal tax  lien  of  February  11, 2013. (GEs  3-5  and
AEs L-M)
Applicant earns $225,000 a year from his present job. After covering his monthly
expenses, he has little discretionary funds at his disposal. (AE B; Tr. 115-116) He has
accumulated  about  $14,000  in  the  401(k)  he  established  with  his  new  employer  and
hopes to add to his retirement account. (Tr. 112-113)
Endorsements
Applicant is well regarded by his colleagues (past and present) who have worked
closely with him. (AEs A, E, N, P, S, and X; Tr. 38) Each of his colleagues  credits him
with trusted financial responsibility with his business and personal accounts.
