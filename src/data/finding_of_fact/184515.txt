As  amended,  the   SOR  alleges  that  Applicant:   (1.a)   failed   to   file,  as  required,
Federal and  state  income  tax  returns for TY  2014  through  2019; (1.b)  is past-due  on  a
car note with a balance of  $8,867; (1.c) owes $4,407 in child support; (1.d)  owes $618 to

account;  (1.f)  owes the  IRS  $45,390  in  delinquent  taxes for TY  2012  - 2015  and  TY  2017
–  2019; and (1.g)  owes his state $9,661  in  delinquent taxes.
Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.d, 1.f, and 1.g. He denied the remaining SOR
allegations. I incorporated into my findings of fact his SOR admissions, and those at his
hearing. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following additional
findings of fact:
Applicant is 63 years old. He graduated from high school in 1977. He honorably
served in the military on active duty from 1981 to 1987. He started college in 1996, and
he  is  still  attending  college,  seeking  his  bachelor’s  degree.  He  married  in  1992  and
divorced in 2017. He has a 15-year-old daughter for whom he provides financial support.
Applicant’s employment history, as disclosed in his 2020 SCA, is difficult to follow,
appears to have conflicting employments, and contains several unaccounted periods. He
was self-employed as an investigator (part-time) for two employers between July 2002
and  December 2007,  while  at  the  same  time  working  full-time  as  an  investigator  for a
federal agency. He was employed full-time by a federal contractor as a residential sales
representative  from  December  2003  to  April  2005.  A  federal  contractor  employed  him
between  August  2007  and  November  2007  as  a  full-time  security  officer.  He  was
unemployed  from  December  2007  to  December  2008.  He  provided  no  explanation  or
reason for this period of unemployment.
A federal agency employed Applicant as a paralegal from December 2008 to July
2013. He received eligibility for a top-secret clearance in 2013, which was renewed until
the DCSA CAF revoked his clearance in April 2021. He worked for a federal contractor
between July and September 2013, but was terminated when he failed his training. He
was unemployed from September to December 2013. He failed to indicate his status from
January 2014 to April 2016. A federal contractor employed Applicant from April 2016 to
November 2017, when he was terminated for failure to perform. He worked full-time for a
federal contractor from November 2017 to December 2019, while at the same time doing
part-time work for a second federal contractor. His annual income during that time was
$87,000. (GE 1; Tr. 42-43) In December 2019, the contract ended and he was laid off.
Applicant  was  unemployed  until  June  2020, when  his  current  employer  and  clearance
sponsor  hired him.  His  current annual salary is $80,000. (Tr. 36; 42-43)  He  has about
$1,000  in  both  his  savings  and  checking  accounts.  He  has  about  $3,300  in  his  401K
retirement account. (Tr. 49)
In Section 26 (Financial Record) of his 2020 SCA, Applicant disclosed that he had
financial  problems  that  included:  not  filing federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  for  TY
2013 to 2018; owing income taxes to the IRS and his state; being delinquent $4,100 in
his child support obligation; having a car repossessed and owing $8,000; and having two
charged-off consumer accounts.
Applicant attributed his financial problems to: having to change his income tax filing
status  during  the  marital  separation,  which  increased  his  tax  liability;  his  divorce;  not
knowing  how  to  file  his  tax  return  as  an  independent  contractor;  and  his  periods  of
unemployment  and  underemployment.  He  claimed  that  at  an  undisclosed  date,  he
entered into a payment plan with the IRS to pay $120 monthly, but he failed to make the
payments.  (At  hearing,  he  acknowledged  this  was  not  true.)  He  also  claimed  he  paid
$1,100  to  a  tax  preparation  company  to  help  him  file  his  taxes,  but  the  company
disappeared. (GE 1; Tr. 31, 32)
In his answer to the SOR, Applicant denied that he failed to file Federal and state
income tax returns for TY 2014 through 2019. (SOR ¶ 1.a) He hired an accountant to help
him file his delinquent tax returns for TY 2014 - 2019 in February 2020. He claimed he
had  established  a  payment  agreement  with  the  IRS.  During  his  testimony,  he
acknowledged he did not have a payment agreement established with the IRS when he
answered the SOR or at the time of his hearing. (Tr. 80 – 81)
Applicant  testified  that  he  filed  his  income  tax  returns  for  TY  2013  to  2019  in
February 2020. (Tr. 66 - 70) Documentary evidence shows he filed his income tax returns
for TY 2017 and 2018 on February 27, 2020; for TY 2019 on February 28, 2020; and for
TY 2020 on October 15, 2021. The IRS noted that he requested an extension to file his
TY 2020 tax return on May 4, 2021. (See AE 3) Applicant highlighted that he timely filed
his income tax returns for TY 2020 and 2021. (Tr. 33) He presented no evidence to show
the IRS granted him extensions to file his tax returns, except for TY 2020.
The IRS assigned Applicant’s delinquent tax obligation to a collection agency on
May  21,  2021.  Documentary  evidence  shows  he  owes  the  IRS  $45,388  in  delinquent
taxes for TY 2012 to 2015 and 2017 to 2019. (SOR ¶ 1.f) (AE 3) He testified that he owes
the IRS an additional $1,000 for his TY 2021 income taxes, thus his total debt to the IRS
totals $46,388. (Tr. 80 - 81)
Applicant hired a tax relief company to help him with his income tax problems on
April 21, 2022. (AE 6) Apparently, he was not satisfied with it. He hired a second company
(CT) on May 26, 2022. (AE 9) At hearing, he testified he was working with CT to establish
a payment plan with the IRS. (Tr. 73 - 74) Post-hearing, Applicant submitted a statement
from CT, dated May 31, 2022, indicating the company was in the process of contacting
the IRS to bring his account into full compliance, amending a tax return, and negotiating
a resolution for the balances. (AE 11) Applicant testified that he had previously entered
into a payment agreement with the IRS (date undisclosed), and made several payments
of  $120 a month. When  confronted in cross-examination, he acknowledged  he did not
have a payment agreement established with the IRS when he answered the SOR or at
the  time  of  his  hearing.  (Tr.  80  –  81)  He  presented  no  documentary  evidence  of  any
payments  made  to  the  IRS,  or  of  any  payment  agreements  established  to  satisfy  his
delinquent taxes for TY 2012 to 2019.
Applicant admitted he was delinquent for $2,409, on an account with an $8,967
balance for a repossessed car. (SOR ¶ 1.b) He explained that he was laid off in 2013,
and did not have the money to pay the car. He surrendered the car to the creditor. He
claimed  he  established  a  payment  arrangement  to  pay  $125  per  month.  He  did  not
present  documentary  evidence  of  the  payment  agreement.  However,  he  presented
documentary evidence of a $632.95 payment made in March 2022. (AE 5; Tr. 32-33) He
did  not  present  evidence  of  any  other payments  made  before  or  after his  March  2022
payment.
Applicant  denied  he  was  $4,407  delinquent  in  his  child  support.  (SOR  ¶  1.c)  In
November 2015,  he  was  in  arrears for $8,688.  He explained  he  was  unemployed  and
could  not  afford  to  make  the  payments.  (Tr.  40)  The  family  court  did  not  find  him  in
contempt of court for failure to make the payments. (AE 7) He has been making his child
support  payments  as  required  since  he  found  work  in  2015,  and  is  current  on  his
payments. (See AE 8) He stated he has an arrearage balance of $2,400.
Concerning  SOR  ¶  1.e,  Applicant  admitted  he  owes  $474  to  a  credit  union  for
overdraft  fees  when  he  was  unemployed.  The  account  was  charged  off.  Prior  to  the
hearing, he claimed he had established a $25 a month payment arrangement. He did not
present documentary evidence of the payment arrangement. His documentary evidence
shows he made a $110 payment in March 2022, and a $60 payment in April 2022.  He
claimed he has been making payments well before and after he  received the SOR. He
presented no documentary evidence to support his claims.
SOR  ¶  1.g  alleged  and  Applicant  admitted  that  he  owes  his  state  $9,661  for
delinquent taxes. On January 31, 2022, Applicant established a payment  plan with his
state, promising to pay $310 monthly. He made two payments in January 2022, one in
March 2022, and one in April 2022. (AE 4; Tr. 83)
Applicant  presented  no  documentary  evidence  of  efforts  to  file  his  delinquent
income tax returns for TYs 2013 through 2019, until 2020. In February 2020, he retained
the services of a tax relief company seeking help to file past-due tax returns and resolve
his tax debt. His documentary evidence shows that the tax relief company  he retained
filed his TYs 2014 to 2019 income tax returns on February 2020. (AE 7)
According to IRS regulations, in 2012, a person making over $9,750 gross income
had  to  file  an  income  tax  return,  and  in  2021,  the  filing  threshold  was  $12,550  gross
income. Applicant did not present documentary evidence to show he was below the IRS
filing threshold for the years in question.
Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  has  made  mistakes  in  the  past  concerning  his
finances,  but  he  is  trying  to  correct  them.  He  believes  that  if  he  is  granted  clearance
eligibility, he will be able to resolve all of his financial problems. He noted that his credit
rating has recently increased. He believes that shows his financial situation is improving.
He  has  been  paying  his  bills  on  time  and  maintaining  good  credit,  and  he  intends  to
continue to do so in the future. He noted that he timely filed income tax returns for TYs
2020 and 2021. His intent is to continue filing his tax returns on time and paying his taxes.
He is looking forward to establishing a payment plan with the IRS, and promised to make
his payments on time and to pay his delinquent taxes.
Applicant promised to be financially responsible in the future. He testified that he
is  following  a  budget  and  he  has  received  financial  counseling  through  his  tax  relief
company.
