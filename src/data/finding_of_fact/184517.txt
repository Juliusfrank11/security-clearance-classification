In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR  and  its  amendments,  he  admitted  all  the
allegations except SOR ¶¶ 2.g and 3.a, which he denied. His admissions are incorporated
in my findings of fact.
Background
Applicant is a 36-year-old ship designer employed by a defense contractor since
January 2017. He was unemployed from September 2014 to January 2017. He received
an interim security clearance in 2019. (Tr. 17.)
Applicant  married  in  September  2010,  divorced  in  November  2015,  married  in
November 2016, and separated in August 2017. He has two children, ages 11 and 15.
Applicant attended  a  community  college  from August 2012  to  March  2014  and  a
university   from   August   2014   to   May   2016.  He  earned   a   bachelor’s  degree   in   graphic
design in May 2016.
Financial Considerations
The  amended  SOR  alleges  12  delinquent  debts  and  a  wage  garnishment.  The
debts  are  reflected  in  credit  reports  from  April  2020,  November  2020,  and  September
2022 (GX 2, 3, and 4), and court records reflecting judgments (GX 5, 6, and 7). Applicant
admitted all the debts in his answer to the amended SOR, stated that the debts alleged
in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.i had been paid, and stated that he was working on resolving the three
debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.j, 1.k, and 1.l.
The evidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below.
SOR  ¶  1.a:  medical  debt  placed  for  collection  of  $1,861.  This  debt  became
delinquent in May 2017. The November 2020 credit report reflects that it is disputed. (GX
3 at 1.) Applicant submitted no evidence of the basis for the dispute or its resolution. In
his  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  claimed  that  the  debt  was  paid  in  full.  He  submitted  no
documentary evidence supporting his claim.
SOR ¶ 1.b: telecommunications debt placed for collection of $63. This debt
became delinquent in September 2019. (GX 3 at 2.) Applicant paid it on April 16, 2021.
(AX A.)
SOR  ¶   1.c:   debt   to   insurance   company   placed  for  collection   of   $126.  The
November  2020   credit  report  reflects  this  debt.   (G  3   at  2.)  It   is  not  reflected   in   the
September 2020  credit  report (GX  4.) In  Applicant’s answer to  the  SOR, he  claimed  that
this debt was paid  in full, but he  did not submit any  documentation  to  support  his claim.
The   fact   that   a   debt   no   longer  appears  on   a   credit  report   does  not  establish   any
meaningful, independent evidence  as to  the  disposition  of  the  debt.  ISCR  Case  No.  18-
01250 at 2 (App. Bd. Feb. 13, 2019).
SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.h: two medical debts placed for collection of $75,
one debt for $135, and one for $1,691. In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he claimed
that these debts were paid in full. He submitted no documentary evidence to support his
claim. At the hearing, he testified that he had limited medical insurance while in college,
and his insurance either did not cover the medical expenses or did not pay the full cost of
the medical care. He had at least one serious medical issue with a hernia. (Tr. 19.)
SOR ¶ 1.g: automobile loan past due for $628. The November 2020 credit report
reflects this debt. (GX 3 at 3.) In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he claimed that this debt
was paid in full. The September 2022 credit report reflects a “paid repossession” and a
zero balance due. (GX 4 at 6.) This debt is resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.i: telecommunications debt placed for collection of $274. The alleged
creditor for this debt  is the  same as  the  $63  debt  in  SOR ¶  1.b. The  April 2020  credit
report reflects two debts to this creditor, one of which was disputed and resolved in favor
of the debtor, but the credit report does not list the amounts. The SOR does not reflect
the  account  numbers  of  the  two  debts  to  this  creditor.  Even  though  the  amounts  are
different, the one debt that was not disputed appears to be the same debt as SOR ¶ 1.b,
which has been resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.j: default judgment for $924 filed on February 29, 2016. (GX 5.) At the
hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  he  was  unaware  of  this  judgment.  He  learned  about  it
when he was searching for court records regarding the judgments alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.k
and  1.l.  He  denied  this  debt  and  testified  that  he  had  never  obtained  a  loan  from  this
creditor.  (Tr.  21.)  He  suspects  identity  theft.  (Tr.  39.)  He  provided  no  documentary
evidence of actions to dispute or otherwise resolve this debt.
SOR  ¶¶  1.k  and  1.l:  judgments  for  $113  and  $211  filed  in  2017.  (GX  6.)
Applicant testified that these judgments were for unpaid personal property taxes. He had
recently moved and did not receive the notices of taxes due, and did not know about the
judgments for unpaid taxes. (Tr. 39.) He submitted no evidence that the judgments have
been satisfied.
SOR  ¶  1.m:  wage  garnishment  in  2020  for  $1,483.  Applicant  testified  that  he
believed this garnishment was for unpaid personal property taxes. (Tr. 39.) However, the
evidence reflects that a  default judgment for unpaid rent was filed against Applicant in
September  2019  for  $1,101,  plus  costs  and  attorney  fees,  and  Applicant’s  pay  was
garnished to collect the judgment. (GX 7.)
Applicant testified that his delinquent debts were due to “growing pains, growing
up,” and not knowing how to manage his money. (Tr. 18-19.) He submitted no evidence
of financial counseling.
Criminal Conduct and Alcohol Consumption
In September 2014, Applicant was charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI).
He was convicted and sentenced to 60 days in jail (suspended for 60 days), fined $300,
and charged with court costs of $340. His driver’s license was restricted for 12 months.
(GX 12.) He testified that he was required to attend an alcohol safety class and had to
install a breathalyzer in his car for six months. (Tr. 26.) He testified that he now consumes
alcohol rarely, and he limits his consumption to drinking wine on special occasions like
Christmas or Thanksgiving. (Tr. 26-27.)
On  January 12,  2016, Applicant  was  charged  with  driving  without  a  license.  He
testified that his license was suspended because of an unpaid fine. (Tr. 23.) He has since
paid the fine. He pleaded guilty to driving without a valid license and was fined $600 plus
court costs. (GX 10.)
On  January  12,  2016,  Applicant  was  charged  with  failure  to  appear  in  court  on
December  16,  2015.  He  testified  that  he  was  challenging  a  speeding  ticket  and  was
scheduled for a court hearing, but that he mixed up the dates and forgot the correct court
date. (Tr. 24.) He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 60 days in jail, suspended for 60
days, and placed on unsupervised probation for three years. (GX 8; GX 11.)
In October 2020, Applicant was charged with violation of a protective order. The
record contains no evidence of the basis for the order or the charge of violating it, except
for  Applicant’s  testimony.  He  testified  that  a  neighbor  threatened  his  wife  and  then
obtained a protective order against him. The neighbors did not appear at the hearing. (Tr.
22-23.) In February 2021, the charge was dismissed. (GX 9.)
In November 2021, Applicant was charged with felony child cruelty and felony child
neglect after he spanked his son. His son was not seriously injured, but he had marks on
his buttocks. Disposition was deferred for the child cruelty, and Applicant was placed on
probation for two years. He was required to attend a parenting class, and he voluntarily
enrolled in an anger management class. (Tr. 34.) The child neglect charge was reduced
to assault and battery on a family member, a misdemeanor, and he was sentenced to 12
months in jail, suspended for 12 months. (GX 13.) Applicant still has joint custody of his
son and is entitled to supervised visitation. (Tr. 35.)
In   May   2022,  Applicant  was  charged   with   DWI,  2nd   offense,  and   refusing   a
breathalyzer test  within 10  years  after  a  DWI  conviction.  (GX  14.) Applicant  testified  that
while  he  was driving,  his wife  wanted  to  stop  at a  restaurant on  the  left side  of the  road.
He moved  to  the  left-turn lane. His wife  changed  her mind,  and  he  abruptly  moved  back
into  the  travel lane.  A  police  officer  observed  the  maneuver and  stopped  him.  Applicant
denied  having  consumed  any  alcohol before driving. (Tr. 29.) He testified  that he  refused
to  take  a  breathalyzer test because  his research reflected  that such  tests are  unreliable.
He asked  the  police  officer to  take  him  to  a  hospital for a  blood-alcohol test,  but the  officer
refused.  (Tr.  15.)  He   testified   that  he   believed   he   has   a   “constitutional  right  to   have   a
blood-alcohol  test.” (Tr.  32.) Applicant  notified  his probation  officer about this incident.  (Tr.
32.) His trial on  the  DWI  and  breathalyzer refusal was pending  and  not imminent when
the record  of his security clearance hearing  closed.
Without  objection  from  either  party,  I  have  taken  administrative  notice  of  the
“implied  consent”  law  applicable  to  the  jurisdiction  in  which  the  breathalyzer  refusal
occurred. (State Code §18.2-268.3). This law provides that a first breathalyzer refusal is
a civil offense, but a second or subsequent refusal is a misdemeanor if it occurs within
ten years after a conviction of certain offenses, including DWI.
Character Evidence
A coworker and former college classmate who has worked with Applicant for about
six  years  considers  him  an  extremely  dependable  and  dedicated  employee  who  goes
beyond what is expected. (AX B.) A friend who has been Applicant’s barber for more than
20 years describes him as loyal, dependable, a good man, and a proud father. (AX C.)
