The  SOR  alleges  15  delinquent debts  totaling about  $113,000;  that  he failed  to
file  Federal  income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  (TY)  2016  through  2020;  and  that  he  is
indebted to the Federal government for delinquent taxes for TYs 2016 through 2020. In
his answers to the SOR, Applicant denied the factual allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through
1.p, 1.r, and 1.t. He admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.q, 1.s, and 1.u though 1.y.
Applicant’s  SOR  admissions,  and  those  at  his  hearing,  are  incorporated  herein
as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following
additional findings of fact:
Applicant  is  42  years  old.  He  graduated  from  high  school  and  enlisted  in  the
Marine Corps in 1997. He completed his term of service and was honorably discharged
with  the  rank  of  corporal  in  August  2001.  He  testified  that  he  possessed  a  secret
clearance during some of his time in the service, and that he has held a clearance for
20  years.  (Tr.  23)  He  earned  an  associate’s  degree  and  has  completed  a  number  of
Information Technology (IT) certifications. He married in January 2010 and divorced in
June  2014.  He  has  been  in  a  domestic  partnership  relationship  since  2011  and  has  a
stepson, age 12, and a daughter, age two.
Applicant’s  employment  history  shows  he  worked  as  a  security  guard  between
September  2001  and  April  2007.  He  worked  at  restaurants  between  April  2007  and
December 2010. He resumed working as a security guard between November 2009 and
August 2013. He worked IT support between August 2013 and May 2016. He started a
house flipping business in 2015. He left his IT job to concentrate on his house flipping
business  and  was  self-employed  between  May  2016  and  May  2017.  He  worked  as  a
security  guard  between  May  2017  and  December  2019.  Applicant  became  a  licensed
realtor  in  2018,  seeking  a  second  job  to  increase  his  earnings.  (Tr.  28)  He  has  been
working  as  a  cyber-analyst  for  his  current  employer  and  security  sponsor,  a  federal
contractor, since June 2020. (Tr. 28)
Applicant’s fiancé was working in 2012. She stopped working when she moved in
with him in 2014. This resulted in a loss of $75,000 income to the household  when he
became the sole provider. She started working again in 2020, and she is making about
$93,000  a  year.  Applicant  testified  she  has  been  helping  him  address  his  financial
obligations. (Tr. 30, 40)
In  response  to  questions  in  Section  26  (Financial  Record)  of  his  2019  SCA,
Applicant  disclosed  that  he  had  financial  problems  and  revealed  four  of  the  accounts
alleged  in  the  SOR  in  which  he  had  established  payment  agreements.  He  was
interviewed  by  an  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  investigator  in  June  2020,
and discussed most of the accounts alleged in the SOR.
Applicant  explained  that  his  financial  problems  resulted  from  a  combination  of
factors.  His  fiancé  has  been  suffering  from  chronic  Lyme  disease  since  2011.  The
doctors did not realize she was suffering from it until 2016 or 2017, when it really started
to  affect  her  being  able  to  live.  She  could  not  work  and  was  in  constant  pain.  She
required special medical treatments and medicines. He stated that most chronic Lyme
disease  treatment  is  not  covered  by  insurance.  He  had  to  make  the  majority  of  the
medical payments out of his savings. (Tab F-1; Tr. 18-19)
Applicant  has  been  working  two  jobs  since  about  2012.  He  was  a  full-time
flipping  business
the  week  and  worked  a  house
security  guard  during
(construction/repairing investment properties) during the weekends. (Tr. 19) In 2016, he
purchased three out of state properties, two in state (1) one in state (2). He had trouble
with construction crews completing the jobs on time, and one of the properties burned
down.  The  insurance  did  not  cover  the  full  amount  of  the  loss  and  he  used  personal
funds  to  pay  the  creditor  for  the  property.  He  sold  the  properties  between  2017  and
2018. He is no longer in the house flipping business.
Applicant’s  financial  problems  exacerbated  in  2018.  He  sought  financial
counseling and assistance from an insurance company and a debt resolution company.
The insurance company helped him understand credit worthiness and how to work with
credit companies to mitigate his debt. He contacted his creditors, established payment
agreements, and started to settle and pay his delinquent debts. He is now concentrating
on  saving  money  for  his  fiancé’s  medical  expenses  and  repairing  his  credit.  Applicant
started  making  payments  on  his  delinquent  debts  after  his  fiancé  started  working  in
2020. Prior to that, he was the sole source of income and his income was insufficient to
pay the delinquent accounts and their living expenses. (Tr. 73-75)
The status of the SOR allegations is as follows:
SOR ¶¶ 1.a alleged a charged-off account for $16,193; 1.b a charged-off account
for $14,220; and 1.c a charged-off account for $12,569, all of  which were resolved via
cancellations of debt (IRS Form 1099-C). (See, Tabs F-4a, E, and F-4c; Tr. 52-53)
SOR  ¶  1.d  alleged  a  collection  account  for  $11,594.  Applicant  and  the  creditor
established  a  settlement  agreement  in  January  2019,  and  he  is  making  payments  as
agreed. (See, Tabs F-4d; Tr. 53)
SOR  ¶  1.e  alleged  a  charged-off  account  for  $8,910.  Applicant  settled  the
account and paid it off in April 2021.  (See, Tab F-4e)
SOR ¶ 1.f alleged a charged-off account for $8,300. Applicant settled the account
for less than owed in April 2021 and paid it off in May 2021. (See, Tab F-4f)
SOR ¶ 1.g alleged a collection account for $7,851. Applicant settled the account
for less than owed in April 2021, and paid it off. (See, Tab F-4g; Tr. 57)
SOR  ¶¶  1.h,  1.i,  and  1.j  alleged  collection  accounts  for  $7,846,  $7,801,  and
$7,796,  respectively.  Applicant’s  evidence  shows  he  established  payment  plans  in
January  2019  for  the  three  accounts  and  made  27  consecutive  payments  of  $50
monthly, until March 2021 for each account. He submitted evidence of three additional
$50 payments made on each of the three accounts during January through March 2022.
He testified he is still making his payments as scheduled. (See, Tabs E, F-4h, F-4i, and
F-4j; Tr. 59-63)
SOR  ¶  1.k  alleged  a  charged-off  account  for  $7,783.  Applicant  settled  the
account for less than owed in June 2020 and paid it off in April 2021. (See, Tab F-4k)
SOR  ¶¶  1.l  and  1.m  alleged  the  same  account  in  collection  for  $950.  Applicant
settled the  account  in February 2021  and paid  it  off  in April 2021.  (See, Tab  F-4n; Tr.
66)
SOR ¶ 1.n alleged an account in collection for $733. Applicant paid it off in April
2021. (See, Tab F-4l; Tr. 64-65)
SOR ¶ 1.o alleged an account in collection for $109. Applicant settled it for less
than owed and paid it off. (See, Tab F-4o; Tr. 67)
SOR ¶¶ 1.p through 1.t alleged that Applicant failed to timely file Federal income
tax returns for tax years (TY) 2016 through 2020. He claimed that he timely filed his TY
2016 income tax return. At hearing, Applicant presented a Form 1040X (amended filing)
for  TY  2016,  filed  in  2019.  During  his  testimony,  Applicant  explained  his  2016  tax
preparer made some mistakes with his 2016 income tax return and the IRS returned it
to be corrected. He asked the IRS what was wrong with his initial 2016 tax return, and it
took the IRS until 2019 to answer his questions.
In 2019, Applicant retained the services of a professional tax preparer to help him
file  an  amended  2016  tax  return.  (Tr.  13-14;  Tr2.  12)  He  was  not  happy  with  the  tax
professional  work  and,  in  2021,  he  retained  another  tax  professional  who  is  currently
helping him resolve his tax problems. (Tr. 51)
Applicant  filed   his  Federal  income   tax   returns  for TYs  2017,  2018,   and   2019   in
May  20, 2020.  (Tr2. 7;  Tab  F-4q)  He timely  filed  his TY  2020  income  tax  return.  (Tr2. 7-
8)
SOR  ¶¶  1.u  through  1.y  alleged  that  Applicant  is  indebted  to  the  Federal
government  for  delinquent  taxes  for  TYs  2016  through  2020.  Applicant  anticipated  a
$13,000  refund  for TY  2016,  and  he  received  only $3,000.  He  believes  that  when  the
IRS  finalizes  its  review  of  his 2016  income  tax  return,  he  will  receive  a  refund  of  over
$10,000.  To  claim  the  refund,  a  return  for  TY  2016  must  have  been  filed  by  July  15,
2020. (www.IRS.gov - three years after due date)
Applicant admitted he is indebted to the Federal government for delinquent taxes
for TYs 2017 through 2020. (Tr2. 7-8) However, his documentary evidence shows that
he  anticipated  a  $9,793  refund  for  TY  2017.  He  testified  that  he  did  not  receive  the
refund because the IRS applied it to prior years’ tax debt. (Tab F-4q; Tr2. 19-20)
Applicant’s 2018  income  tax  return shows that he  owes  the  IRS  $1,404. (Tab  F-
4r)  His 2020  income  tax  return shows that he   owes  the  IRS  $8,104. (Tab  F-4t)  He  did
not pay  either his 2018  or his  2020  tax  debt. He claimed  his tax  preparer advised  him
not  to   pay   them   because   the   IRS   allegedly   owes  him   over  $10,000   for  TY   2016.
Applicant   anticipates  that  when   his  2016   taxes  are   resolved   in  his  favor,  anything   he
owes  for other tax  years will  be offset  by  what the  IRS  owes him.  Applicant claimed  he
has set aside  $30,000  in a  savings account to  pay  any  possible  taxes he  may  owe  the
IRS. (Tr. 42; Tr2. 20-28) Applicant could not recall  whether he  owed  taxes or received  a
refund  for TY 2019.
Applicant  testified   he  owed   another state   (D) $24,000  for  delinquent  real estate
property   taxes   not   alleged   in   the   SOR.   He   paid   $8,000   in   2020,   $8,000   in   2021,   and
agreed  to  pay  $8,000  in 2022  to  settle the  debt and  avoid losing  the  property. (Tr2. 26-
27)
Applicant  believes  he  has  been  working  diligently  to  bring  all  of  his  accounts
current. He noted it was difficult to do so when he was the sole provider for the family.
Now  that  his  fiancé  is  working  again,  he  is  confident  that  if  he  is  allowed  to  keep  his
clearance he will be able to resolve all of his financial problems. He highlighted that he
served  in  the  Marines  and  has  held  a  clearance  for  over  21  years  with  no  issues  or
security concerns, except for those alleged in the SOR. He believes that his time in the
service and his current efforts to resolve his financial problems demonstrate that  he is
not a security risk.
Applicant  stated  that  his  financial  situation  is  getting  better,  and  that  he  is  in
decent financial shape. He is able and willing to pay his delinquent debts and promised
to be financially responsible in the future. To ensure his financial problems do not occur
again,  he  intends  to  continue  his  financial  counseling  and  using  the  services  of  a  tax
professional.
Applicant’s net cash flow per month is $5,800. His expenses per month including
short  and  long-term  debt  payments  are  around  $3,300.  He  noted  that  he  had  a  lot  of
things that were out of my control a couple of years ago and those amounts really took
a toll on his finances. He believes his debts are currently small because he put myself in
payment plans and worked with credit financial institutions that help him get back in the
black. He stated that the chance of accruing delinquent debt because of his cohabitant’s
medical problems and being unable to work outside their home are unlikely to recur.
