worked for his current employer since July 2020. He reports no unemployment in the last
sixteen years. He does not have a security clearance. (Item 3)
The Statement of Reasons (SOR) sets forth security concerns under Guideline F.
The SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.d lists four delinquent debts totaling approximately $35,000 for
three automobile loans that were charged off, and $168 for a medical bill that was placed
for  collection.  (Items  4,  5,  6)  In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  SOR  1.a,
through SOR 1.d. He did not provide any other explanations.
In  his  2020  subject  interview,  Applicant  acknowledged  that  all  SOR  debts  were
unpaid.  (Item  7) The  delinquent  accounts  appear  in  his  2020,  and  2022  credit  bureau
reports. (Items 4, 5) He told the Government investigator that he planned to consolidate
his auto loans in November 2020, but provided no documentation to support his claim.
He wants to pay his debts and now allows his spouse to maintain the household budget.
Applicant  provided  no  budget,  has  had  no  financial  counseling,  and  there  is  no
information concerning his income or expenses. He stated that he is willing and able to
pay his delinquent debts. He offered no documents to indicate that he has taken steps to
do so.
As to SOR ¶¶1.a, 1.c, and 1.d, Applicant answered that the three alleged debts
were delinquent automobile loans that were charged  off. (Item 7). He purchased a used
car in October 2018, had insufficient household income to maintain the payments, and
allowed  the  bank  to  repossess  the  vehicle.  As  to  the  second  delinquent  auto  loan,  he
purchased a used 2014 vehicle, which needed repairs that he could not afford to make.
In 2016, Applicant allowed the bank to repossess the vehicle. The last delinquent auto
loan was the result of a car that he co-signed for his girlfriend in February 2014. His friend
could not afford the payments, and allowed the bank to repossess the car. His girlfriend
wrecked the car in 2014. (Item 7)
As  to  SOR  ¶  1.b,  Applicant  stated  the  medical bill of  $168  was  the  result  of  an
emergency room visit in October 2017. (Item 3). He stated that he forgot about the debt.
The account became delinquent in 2017. He told the investigator he was willing and able
to repay the debt as he plans to contact the debtor. There is no evidence that he has done
so. (Item 7)
