Applicant  admitted  to  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a.~1.e.,  and  1.i.  and  1.j.  He
denied  SOR  allegation  ¶  1.f.~1.h.,  1.k.  and  2.a.  and  2.b.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 69-year-old Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of a defense contractor.
He has been CEO since November of 2015. He does not have a security clearance. He
is divorced, and has three adult children. (TR at page 5 lines 15~24, and at page 24 line
1 to page 26 line 5.) Applicant is a dual-national with Finland. (TR at page 16 lines 4~7,
and at page 23 lines 8~10.)
Guideline B - Foreign Influence
1.a.  Applicant  admits  that  his  sister  is  a  citizen  and  resident  of  Finland.  She  is
retired  from  working  with  an  “oil  company.”  He  communicates  with  her  through  social
media  on a  weekly basis, and  physically speaks to  her “maybe four times a  year.” (TR
at page 34 line 6 to page 38 line 15.)
1.b.  Applicant  admits that his one  brother is a  citizen  and  resident  of  Finland.  “He
is employed  . . . [by] a  Swedish industrial manufacturer.”   His communications with  this
brother are  similar to that with his sister, noted above. (TR at page 38 line 16 to page 41
line 21.)
1.c. Applicant admits that his other brother is a citizen of Finland, but is a resident
of France. He “runs a business with a business partner.” This second brother’s business
is  “in  industrial  equipment  used  by  the  pharmaceutical  industry.”  Applicant  has  little
contact with this brother, “maybe once in two years.” (TR at page 41 line 23 to page 45
line 17.)
1.d.  and   1.i.  Applicant   admits  that  he   has  a   very   close   female  friend   who   is  a
citizen  of  Finland,  but  who  resides with  Applicant  much  of the  time  in the  United  States.
“She’s a  correspondent  for a  Finnish  newspaper.”  They  are  romantically  involved,  and
they also co-own an apartment in Finland valued at about $357,000. (TR at page 45 line
18 to page 52 line 15, at page 63 line 3 to page 64 line 12, and at page 68 line 24 to
page 70 line 15.)
1.e. Applicant has been an Honorary Counsel for Finland from about January of
2019 to the present. “It’s completely pro bono. . . . no budget, no money, no payment.”
He  dedicates  “two  or  three  hours  per  month,”  to  this  honorary  service  to  the  Finnish
government. (TR at page 53 line 9 to page 55 line 2.)
1.f.  Applicant  denies  that  he   maintains  a   Finnish  bank  account  with   a   value   of
over $800,000. He avers that it’s value varies between $10,000~$50,000.  (TR at page
55 line 3 to page 56 line 17.)
1.g.  Applicant  denies  that   he   maintains  bank  accounts  and   business  interests,
with  his three  children,  in Finland  valued  at nearly  $2,000,000.  He avers that the  bank
accounts are  about  $30,000,  and  the  business investment  about  $700,000.  (TR at page
58 line 11  to  page 62 line 6.)
1.h.   and   1.k.  Applicant  denies  that   he   maintains   joint   bank   accounts   with   an
individual and  with  two  businesses  in  Finland,  in the  Netherlands, and  in  England. He  is,
in  fact,   CEO  and   co-owner  of  a   U.S.   business   worth   between   $6,000,000   and
$20,000,000. (TR at page  13  line  8  to  page  21  line  25, at page  26  line  14  to  page  29
line 10, at page  64 lines 16~24, at page  70 line 16 to  page 71 line 12,  and AppX A.)
1.j.  Applicant   admits   that   he   co-owns  investments   in  Finland   valued   at   about
$2,750.  This amount is diminutive in light of Applicant’s other foreign assets.
Guideline C - Foreign Preference
2.a.   As   a   dual-national,  Applicant  voted   in   the   Finnish   Presidential  election   in
about January of  2018. (TR at page  79 line 13 to page 82 line  6.)
2.b.  Applicant  will receive  a  monthly  pension  of  about $2,283  from  Finland   upon
his retirement. (TR at page 82 line 7  to  page 84 line  1.)
Notice
I  take  administrative  notice  of  the  following  facts  about  Finland:  The  United
States  established  diplomatic  relations  with  Finland  in  1919,  following  its  1917
declaration  of  independence from  the  Russian  Empire.  The  United  States and  Finland
have  enjoyed  decades  of  close  and  cordial  relations.  Finland  and  the  United  States
belong to a number of the same international organizations. Finland has most recently
applied for admission into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
