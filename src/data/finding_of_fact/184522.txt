Applicant is a 76-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since October 2010. There is no evidence in the record regarding
his  education  level.  He  has  been  married  to  his  current  spouse  since  1971,  after
divorcing his first spouse in 1969. He has two adult children. Applicant claimed that he
was awarded eligibility for access to sensitive information in 2014.  (Item 3)
Applicant has a history of financial problems, including seven years of not timely
filing  his  federal  income  tax  returns  and  owing  delinquent  federal  income  taxes.  The
SOR  alleges  untimely  filed  tax  returns  for  the  2013  through  2019  tax  years  and
delinquent  federal  taxes  totaling  $27,558  for  those  same  tax  years.  In  his  SOR
response,  Applicant  admitted  the  SOR  allegations  with  additional  comments.  He
provided documentation to show that, beginning in May 2021, he paid $300 per month
pursuant to an agreement  with  the IRS to pay his delinquent taxes. These documents
also  show  that  he  made  sporadic,  additional  payments  to  the  IRS  in  October  2020,
February 2021, and two payments in April 2021.
The   documents  he   submitted   with   his  response   to   the   SOR   reflect  that,  as   of
December 2021,  he  paid $7,525  toward his delinquent  taxes  for the  aforementioned  tax
years, as well  as for the  2021  tax  year.  In  exhibits attached  to  his FORM  response, he
provided   a   document   that  shows  that   he   has   made   five   additional  $300   monthly
payments   through   May   2022,  and  an  additional payment  of  $1,301   in  June  2022.  The
total  amount of payments  that  Applicant  made  to  the  IRS  reflected  in  these  documents
is about $10,300.  Applicant acknowledged  owing  about $40,000  in  back taxes in June
2022.  The   SOR  allegations  are   established   through   Applicant’s  admissions,  his
evidence,  and the Government’s evidence.  (Items 2-9, 11; the June  2022 letter; AE 1,  4-
8, 10-13)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
March  2017.  The  SF  86  required  information  about  Applicant’s  taxes.  He  had  an
interview with a Department of Defense (DOD) investigator in December 2018 in which
his  tax  problems  were  discussed.  Applicant  also  was  required  to  provide  documents
and  information  related  to  his  taxes  to  the  DOD  Consolidated  Adjudications  Facility
(CAF). He provided these documents and information in a response in November 2020
and  five  supplemental  responses  between  March  2021  and  July  2021.  Each  such
response  provided  evidence  of  incremental progress  of  Applicant’s  attempts  to  file  his
late federal tax returns and to pay his delinquent federal taxes. (Items 3, 4-9, 11)
As  evidenced  by  documents  Applicant  submitted  in  his  response  to  the  FORM,
the IRS acknowledged receiving his 2019, 2018, and 2016 tax returns in October 2020.
It  acknowledged  receiving  his  2017  tax  return  in  December  2020,  and  his  2015  tax
return in November 2020. It acknowledged receiving his 2014 tax return in September
2021,  and  his  2013  tax  return  in  May  2022.  He  claimed  that  he  submitted  his  2013
federal tax return in November 2020,  but the IRS did not process this return  until May
2022. However, in one of his supplemental interrogatory responses, he also claimed to
have  submitted  his  2013  federal  tax  return  in  February  2021,  so  his  claims  are
inconsistent.  Regardless,  there is no evidence  in  the  record that Applicant filed any of
the late federal tax returns or paid any of the delinquent taxes listed in the SOR for over
a year-and-a-half after he submitted his SF 86 and had his security interview.  There is
no  evidence  that  the  IRS  granted  Applicant  a  filing  extension  for  any  of  the  tax  years
relevant  to  the  SOR.  The  IRS  acknowledged  receiving  his  2020  federal  tax  return  in
June  2021,  with  no  outstanding  taxes  being  owed  for  that  tax  year.  (Items  2,  4-9;  the
June 2022 letter; AE 3-11)
Applicant  claimed  that  he  was  unaware  that  his  federal  tax  returns  were  not
being filed because he was traveling for work. He acknowledged that he was not staying
on  top  of  his  finances  because  of  this  travel.  He  claimed  that  the  outstanding  taxes
resulted from his wife’s social security income. When he realized he had several years
of unfiled tax returns, he did not think that he had the money to pay the taxes that would
be due, so he did not remedy these filing failures. He claimed that he did not have the
money to pay his taxes because his wife was unemployed, he was underemployed, and
they had expenses related to the care of his children, his parents, and his in-laws. He
also blames staffing shortcomings at the IRS and the pandemic for not allowing him to
remedy his late tax return filings as early as he claims he could have. (Items 3, 11; the
June 2022 letter)
