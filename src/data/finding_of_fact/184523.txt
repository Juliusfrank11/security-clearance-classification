Under Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed $27,602 for three
delinquent  credit  card  accounts  (SOR  1.a  –  1.c).  In  response  to  the  SOR  (Answer),
Applicant denied, with remarks, all three allegations. After a thorough review of the record,
I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  57   years  old   and   works  for  a   defense   contractor  in   a   position   that
requires eligibility  for access to  classified  information. He started  working  for his current
employer in March 2013  after a  six-month  period  of  unemployment that began  with  a  lay-
off  from  a  previous position  in the  same  industry. Applicant served  in the  Air  Force from
July  1983  until receiving  an  honorable discharge  in March 1989. In  December 2003, he
earned   a   bachelor’s   degree   in  electrical  engineering.  Thereafter,  he   worked   in  the
aerospace  industry  between  July  2003  and  October 2012. He held  a  top-secret  security
clearance  in the Air Force, but it has since lapsed. (GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 25  –  27)
Applicant  and   his  wife   have   been   married   since   January   2016.   He  has  been
married  twice before  –  between  June  1983  and  January  1986,  and  between  January  1988
and February 2014. Both  marriages ended in divorce. Applicant has one  adult child  from
his first marriage  and  two  adult  children  from  his second  marriage. (GX  1; GX  2;  Tr. 22  -
25)
After his discharge in 1989, Applicant and his second ex-wife, who also was in the
Air Force, stayed in State A until she also left the military. They then moved to State B
and Applicant began his college studies while also working to support his family. In 2003,
during his last year in school, he found work as an electrical engineer in State B, but at a
location about two hours away. Applicant’s ex-wife, who homeschooled their children and
did  not  work  outside  the  home,  did  not  want  to move.  Starting  in July 2003,  Applicant
continued to pay for their marital residence while also paying to live near work a few hours
away.  This  effectively  began  their  separation,  which  culminated  in  a  divorce  in  2014.
During that 11-year period, Applicant paid between $500 and $650 a month to rent an
apartment while also paying just under $1,000 a month for the mortgage on their marital
residence. Applicant’s ex-wife took possession of the house as part of their divorce and
Applicant has had no continuing financial obligation to her since their divorce. (GX 1; GX
2; Tr. 25 – 26, 54 – 56)
Applicant stopped paying the accounts listed in the SOR in March or April 2014. In
late 2021, the debts at SOR 1.a and 1.b were cancelled by the creditors and attributed to
Applicant as income for the 2021 tax year. He received an IRS Form 1099-C for each
debt and testified that he reported the amounts forgiven ($10,657 for SOR 1.a, and $8,195
for SOR 1.b) as income on his most recent federal income tax return. (AX A and B; Tr. 58
– 62)
Applicant disclosed several past-due debts, including those alleged in the SOR, in
Section  26  (Financial  Record)  of  his  e-QIP.  A  credit  report  obtained  by  investigators
shortly  thereafter  also  documents  the  debts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Applicant  discussed
those debts during a personal subject interview (PSI) with a government investigator on
September 24, 2019. He has attributed his financial problems to his divorce in 2014 and
to his unemployment between October 2012 and March 2013. He also testified that he
exercised poor financial judgment, which included following poor financial advice from a
girlfriend he had after he separated from his second wife. (GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 41)
In January 2019, Applicant resolved one of the debts he listed in the e-QIP when
the creditor filed a lawsuit against his ex-wife to collect a delinquent credit card debt she
had incurred in both their names during their separation. He paid about $10,000 to satisfy
his part of that debt. In late 2014, Applicant received a letter from another of the creditors
listed in his e-QIP to whom he owed about $20,000. The letter demanded payment and
may have offered settlement terms. When he got the letter, he contacted an attorney at
LegalShield™, a legal advice service provided by Applicant’s employer at a discounted
monthly rate. He spoke  on the phone once to  an attorney about what he should do  in
response to the creditor’s letter. The attorney advised him to settle the debt, which he did
for about $7,000 in early 2015. Applicant also asked what he should do about his other
debts. The attorney told him to wait until his creditors contacted him to take any action.
(GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 44 – 52)
Applicant never heard from his SOR 1.a – 1.c creditors. He also has not contacted
them  or made  any payments  to  them  in  the past  eight  years. Those  debts  have  since
fallen off his credit report because of the passage of time, as required by the Fair Credit
Reporting Act (FCRA), 15 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq. At hearing, Applicant acknowledged that
he intended to let reporting of his debts expire rather than initiate resolution efforts. He
also acknowledged that the LegalShield™ attorney did not advise him to let his debts fall
of his credit report. (Answer; GX 5; Tr. 37 – 41, 43, 57 – 58)
Applicant does not dispute any of the debts alleged in the SOR. He did not present
any information showing he has sought professional financial assistance or counseling to
help with his debts. He files and pays his income taxes on time, and he claims he now
has a good credit rating and is able to meet all of his current financial obligations. (Tr. 52
– 53)
When  Applicant  started  working  in  State  B  in  2003,  he  earned  about  $50,000
annually. When he lost his job in 2012, he was earning about $90,000. For the next six
months,  he  supported  himself  and  his  family  on  savings  and  unemployment  benefits.
When  he  started  working  in  March  2013,  he  earned  between  $70,000  and  $80,000
annually. He now earns about $105,000 annually. His current wife earns about $50,000
annually. They live in a house she owns, and he pays the mortgage and all utilities, as
well as his wife’s monthly car payment. Applicant’s net monthly income is about $5,200.
From that, he pays about $3,200 each month in expenses; however, he estimated that
he has only about $500 remaining each month after expenses. (Tr. 45 – 50, 56 – 57, 65
– 67)
Applicant  has  two  credit  cards.  On  one,  he  carries  a  balance  of  about  $8,000,
which he testified has been the case for over a year. The other card has a balance of
about $2,000. Applicant uses his cards to pay for regular expenses such as food, gas,
home-repair  items,  and  so  forth.  He  explained  that  he  uses  the  card  with  the  higher
balance instead of cash because it has a low interest rate. He pays about $1,000 a month
on his credit cards, but always carries a high balance. His wife has her own cards and
pays for them separately. (Tr. 62 – 65)
