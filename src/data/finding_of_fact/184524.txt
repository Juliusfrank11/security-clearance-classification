Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations in his Answer. He is 38 years old.
He was married and he has two children--one adult and one minor. He graduated from
high school in 2002. He attended college from 2002 to 2003, in 2010, and in 2014, but
he  did  not  earn  a  degree.  He  obtained  a  certificate  in  heating,  ventilation,  and  air
conditioning  in  2020.  As  of  his  April  2020  SCA,  he  worked  as  a  pipefitter  for  his
employer, a DOD contractor, since June 2006. He was granted a security clearance in
2010. (Items 1,3, 4, 5)
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  owed  the  IRS  $15,152  in  delinquent  federal
taxes for tax years (TY) 2011, 2013, 2014, 2016, 2017, and 2018  (SOR ¶ 1.a). It also
alleged  that  he  had  a  judgment  entered  against  him  in  2019  for  a  $1,150  past-due
medical debt (SOR ¶ 1.b) and a university account in collection for $336 (SOR ¶ 1.c). In
addition  to  his  admissions  in  his  Answer,  Applicant  disclosed  and  discussed  his
delinquent  federal  taxes  and  delinquent  debts  on  his  2020  security  clearance
application  (SCA),  during  his  June  2020  background  interview,  and  in  his  April  2021
response  to  interrogatories.  Court  records  also  report  the  liens  entered  against
Applicant  by  the  IRS.  Court  records  and  the  February  2021  credit  bureau  report  also
report SOR debt ¶ 1.c. (Items 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
Applicant attributed his delinquent federal taxes to a lack of income, his spouse’s
one-year period of unemployment from 2014 to 2015, and because “I had a lot going on
with helping my family.” He stated in his SCA that he hired a tax relief program to assist
him  with  resolving  his  delinquent  federal  taxes,  but  “all  they  did  was  take  over  3,000
dollars from me.” He also stated that he was working with another tax company to assist
him  with  resolving  his  delinquent  federal  taxes.  He  stated  that  this  tax  company
contacted  the  IRS  on his  behalf,  guided  him  to  change  his  tax  withholdings  to  zero  to
allow for more taxes to be taken out of his paycheck, and assisted him with setting up a
payment plan to resolve his delinquent federal taxes. (Items 1, 3, 4, 5).
Court records reflect that the IRS entered liens against Applicant in the amounts
of  $29,675,  $671,  and  $9,176,  in  July  2014,  September  2019,  and  June  2021,
respectively. April 2021 IRS tax account transcripts reflect that Applicant owed past-due
federal taxes in the amounts of $2,077, $2,597, $1,029, $2,688, $5,702, and $1,056, for
a  total  of  $15,149,  for  TY  2011,  2013,  2014,  2016,  2017,  and  2018.  The  transcripts
reflect that he did not have any outstanding federal taxes for TY 2012, 2015, and 2019.
The transcripts reflect that the IRS applied credits of $80, $3,701, and $4,453 in 2014,
2016, and 2020, respectively, to his outstanding taxes for TY 2011, and Applicant had
not  made  any  payments  toward  his  outstanding  taxes.  Applicant  contacted  the  IRS  in
May and June 2021 to set up a payment arrangement to resolve his outstanding taxes.
He  stated  that  he  entered  into  a  payment  arrangement  of  $106  monthly  beginning  in
June 2021. As of December 2021, he was still trying to reach a payment arrangement
with the IRS to resolve his outstanding taxes. He made four payments to the IRS, from
June to September 2021, of $110, $110, $100, and $50. (Items 1, 3, 4, 5, 6; AE A)
Applicant  stated  that  he  entered  into  a  payment  arrangement  of  $57  monthly,
between June 2021 and July 2023, to resolve the medical judgment in SOR ¶ 1.b. As of
December 2021, he stated that he made an initial payment of $228, and he would make
subsequent payments of $50, for a total of $836, to resolve this debt. Applicant paid the
debt in SOR ¶ 1.c. (Items 3, 5, 7; AE A)
Applicant  described  his  financial  status  as  “improving”  during  his  background
interview. He traveled to the Bahamas for tourism in 2014 and 2017, and to Mexico in
2018.  A personal financial  statement that  he  completed  in April 2021  reflected  that he
had a monthly net remainder of $147, not accounting for any payments toward the IRS.
