Applicant  is  a  39-year-old  customer  engineer  who  has  been  employed  by  a
defense  contractor  since  June  2018.  He  seeks  to  retain  his  Top  Secret  security
clearance,  which  is  a  requirement  of  his  continued  employment.  He  has  successfully
held  a  clearance  with  several  Government  agencies  for  approximately  the  last  ten
years. He is familiar with the requirements to hold a clearance. (Tr. 16-18, 22-23, 54-55;
GE 1; AE G)
Applicant graduated from high school in June 2001. He was awarded a Bachelor
of Arts degree in sport and fitness in August 2006. (Tr. 18-20; GE 1; AE H) He  married
in  May  2012.  He  and  his  wife  do  not  have  any  children.  (Tr.  20-21;  GE  1)  His  wife  is
employed by the Government as a visual arts specialist (GS-12). (Tr. 75-76)
Financial Considerations
The  16  financial  allegations  in  the  SOR  are  established  by  Applicant’s  June  8,
2020  SF-86;  his  background  interview;  his  SOR  Answer;  his  DOHA  interrogatory
responses; the credit reports in the record; and his hearing testimony. (GE 1, 2, 4 - 8;
SOR  Answer)  In  his  SOR  Answer,  Applicant  admitted  in  part  and denied  in  part  all  of
the 16 financial allegations. (SOR Answer)
Applicant stated that he incurred the debts “during a difficult time in my life when
several personal events  took  place that  resulted  in an  inability to  meet my basic living
expenses.”  He  explained  that  in  2013,  his  wife  became  very  ill  and  was  hospitalized
several times in an attempt to determine the cause of her illness. Her illness persisted
over the next several years requiring multiple surgeries until 2018 or 2019.  Applicant’s
wife  returned  to  work  after  she  recovered  from  her  surgeries.  (Tr.  59-61,  72-74;  SOR
Answer)
Because  of  her  medical  issues,  Applicant’s  wife  was  unable  to  work  for
significant  periods.  He  stated  that  with  his  income  alone,  there  “was  barely  enough  to
cover  our  mortgage   and   the   cost  of   food.”  To   add   further  to   their   financial  stress,
Applicant  unexpectedly   lost   his  job   in  2018.   Although   he   received   unemployment  for
several months, he  did  not receive  enough  income  to  pay  their  basic expenses or their
personal bills. He  stated  the  SOR debts listed  “are  the  result of this difficult time  period
in  our lives  and   the   culmination   of  multiple  events  that  led   to  us falling   behind   on   bills
and going into debt.” (SOR Answer)
Applicant  was  unemployed  from  March  2018  to  June  2018.  (Tr.  55-59,  72,  77;
GE 1) His wife had health insurance, but she still was responsible for a number of out-
of-pocket co-pays. She used all of her sick leave and was required to go into a non-pay
status. Applicant did not know how much sick leave she had at that point. (Tr. 76-78)
The following is a summary of Applicant’s six SOR allegations and their status:
SOR  ¶   1.a   –   Collection  credit  union  account   for  vehicle   in  the   amount   of
$27,406   after  it  was   totaled   in  2016.  At  his  hearing,  Applicant  stated  that  his  “gap
insurance”  did  not  cover  the  balance  owed  after  this  vehicle  was  totaled.  Applicant
stated  that  this  account  was  paid  in  full  and  he  would  provide  a  document  showing
payment post-hearing. Post-hearing, he submitted court documentation stating that the
judgment  for  this  account  was  satisfied  on  July  6,  2021.  (Tr.  24-27;  AE  I)  DEBT
RESOLVED.
SOR  ¶   1.b   –   Collection  credit  card  account   in   the   amount   of  $683.  At  his
hearing,  Applicant  stated  that  this  account  was  paid  in  full  and  he  would  provide
documentation  showing  payment  post-hearing.  Post-hearing,  Applicant  submitted  a
summary of a telephone conversation with the creditor in sufficient detail indicating that
this account was paid in full on July 12, 2019. (Tr. 27-29; AE R) DEBT RESOLVED.
SOR ¶  1.c  –  Collection cell phone  bill  in the  amount  of  $280. At his hearing,
Applicant stated that he has had an account with this cell service for the “last ten years,”
and  that  his  account  with  this  creditor  was  in  good  standing.  Post-hearing,  Applicant
submitted a summary of a telephone conversation with the creditor. He also provided a
recent statement from this creditor indicating that his account was in good standing. He
stated  the  creditor  would  provide  him  with  a  letter  stating  the  amounts  alleged  in  this
allegation as well as the amount of $466 alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f, infra, are incorrect. (Tr.
29-32; AE P, AE R) DEBT RESOLVED.
SOR ¶  1.d  –  Charged-off credit card account  in the  amount  of $1,340.  At his
hearing,  Applicant  stated  he  believed  this account  was  his  father’s  account  as  he  and
his  father  have  the  same  name,  with  Applicant  being  a  junior.  Post-hearing,  Applicant
submitted  a  summary  of  a  telephone  conversation  with  the  creditor.  He  then  learned
that  the  account  was  his,  and  that  it  was  being  automatically  billed  to  a  credit  card
account that was “charged  off  4-5 years ago.” He had changed his debit card account
and  telephone  numbers  and  he  forgot  to  update  the  creditor.  He  made  an  initial
payment of $466 in January 2022, and was to make final payments in February 2022.
(Tr. 32-33, 66; AE N, AE R) DEBT RESOLVED.
SOR  ¶   1.e   –   Collection  personal   loan  account   in   the   amount   of   $733.

34; AE A)  DEBT RESOLVED.

make  payments  because  he  lost  his  job.  He  contacted  the  loan  servicer  to  make  a
payment, and he was informed they were not accepting payments. In September 2021,
his loan servicer informed him by letters that his account was placed  on  a  “Collections
Pause”  and  transferred  to  the  Department  of  Education  (DoEd)  as  a  result  of  the
COVID-19 pandemic forbearance program. His loan servicer further advised him that a
DoEd  loan  servicer  would  contact  him  about  repayment  after  his  loan  had  been

guidance from the DoEd loan servicer. (Tr. 35-37; AE K) DEBT BEING RESOLVED.

Department  Counsel,  referring
to  Applicant’s  September  2020  Office  of
Personnel Management (OPM) interview, questioned him about a payment plan he had
established with the IRS for back taxes owed for 2018 and 2019. His “ballpark” estimate
is that he and his wife owe the IRS about $20,000. He stated that his monthly payments
to  the  IRS  are  on  time.  Applicant  opined  the  reason  he  owed  taxes  is  because  his
withholdings were not in accord with an increase in income. He started paying down the
majority of his debts in 2020 during COVID while he was working from home. (Tr. 61-63;
GE 2) He “had to reach into [his] 401k” to pay off his debt listed in SOR ¶¶ 1.k and 1.m
after the creditor filed suit against him, which triggered a tax penalty for an early 401k
withdrawal. The creditors listed in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.h (duplicate), 1.k, 1.m (duplicate), 1.n,
and  1.o  sued  Applicant  to  recover  money  owed  to  them.  (Tr.  64-65)  Applicant  stated
that he did not have any other open judgments. (Tr. 66)
Applicant  completed  credit  counseling  offered  through  a  debt  consolidation
company  (DCC).  He  had  retained  their  services  from  approximately  January  2020  to
September 2020, before his SOR was issued in April 2021. (Tr. 48-51) Applicant stated
that  his  annual  salary  was  $109,000  and  his  wife’s  annual  salary  as  a  GS-12  was
$92,000,  with  their  joint  annual  income  totaling  $201,000.  Applicant  and  his  wife  own
their home, which is valued at $515,000. They owe $398,000 on their mortgage. At his
hearing,  he  stated  that  he  had  approximately  $1,400  in  his  checking  account  and
$2,000 in his savings account. They have a joint checking account to cover household
expenses.  They  had  “[m]aybe  2,000”  in  their  joint  checking  account  with  the  amount
fluctuating as all of the household expenses are paid from that account. (Tr. 81-84)
Applicant  stated  that  he  and  his  wife  had  created  a  budget.  Post-hearing,  he
submitted a comprehensive budget reflecting that he and his wife are leading a modest
lifestyle and living within their means, which included line items paying down their debts.
Their  joint  monthly  income  was  $10,680,  and  their  net  monthly  remainder  is  $4,224.
They manage their family budget jointly. (Tr. 51, 85, 78; AE S)
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
SOR ¶ 2.a – Alleges in April 2018 Applicant tested positive for cocaine on a
urinalysis administered by local area alcohol safety action program.
This allegation is established by Applicant’s local Alcohol Safety Action Program
(ASAP) drug test administered on April 11, 2018. (GE 3) Applicant denied any drug use
in  his June  2020  SF-86,  in his September 2020 background interview,  in  his February
2021 DOHA interrogatory responses, and in his June 2021 SOR Answer. (GE 1, 2)
On  August  8,  2017,  Applicant  was  convicted  of  reckless  driving  and  placed  on
probation.  His  offense  date  was  February  22,  2017.  As  part  of  his  sentence,  he  was
required  to  complete ASAP.  As noted,  Applicant  participated  in  a  mandatory drug test
administered by ASAP, on which he tested positive for cocaine. On April 12, 2018, the
laboratory  received  Applicant’s  sample.  On  April  17,  2018,  the  laboratory  reported  his
urinalysis  test  results,  having  detected  447  ng/mL  of  benzoylecgonine  (cocaine
metabolite)  utilizing sophisticated  testing methods. The ng/mL  cutoff for a  positive  test
result was 100 ng/mL. (Tr. 52-53, 89; GE 2) [Note –  I have  not considered  Applicant’s
2017 reckless driving conviction in determining his security clearance eligibility, since it
was not alleged in the SOR.]
After Applicant’s probation officer (PO) informed him that he had tested positive
for  cocaine,  Applicant  requested  a  retest.  His  PO  warned  him  that  if  he  failed  the
urinalysis test again, he would be required to go to court and possibly be sentenced to
jail.  Applicant  stated  he  “was  afraid  of  this,  so  she  (PO)  told  me  just  to  wait  till  next
week”  to  take  a  urinalysis  retest.  He  stated  that  he  retook  the  urinalysis  test  the
following week and passed it. (Tr. 53-54, 92-94)
In Applicant’s SOR Answer, he denied this allegation stating, “I have never used
cocaine,  and I  do  not take  illegal drugs.  It  is my belief  that  this test  result  was  a  false
positive, as I was told immediately after the test that I did not pass, and I was asked to
retake the test. I retook the test the following week and passed without issue. I have no
idea  why  I  would  have  a  false  positive  test  result,  but  I  am  completely  confident  and
certain  in  the  statement  that  I  do  not,  and  have  not,  used  illegal  drugs,  including
cocaine.”  (SOR  Answer)  In  Applicant’s  June  2020  SF-86,  he  also  denied  any  use  of
illegal  drugs  in  the  past  seven  years  and  answered  “no”  to  all  questions  relating  to
drugs. (GE 1) Similarly, he denied any use of illegal drugs in his February 2021 DOHA
Interrogatories. (GE 2)
During  Department  Counsel’s  cross-examination,  Applicant  stated  that  the  April
2018 ASAP drug test was the first drug test he took while on probation with ASAP. He
has no explanation as to how cocaine could have gotten into his system. He does not
associate with people who use cocaine. (Tr. 67-69, 89-91) Applicant’s PO informed him
that  he  might  go  back  to  jail  if  his  drug  test  came  back  positive  a  second  time.  He
opined  that  [his  PO]  was,  “more  than  likely  was  just  trying  to  scare  me  .  .  .  .”  His  PO
then  advised  him,  “to  take  it  again  next  week.”  (Tr.  69)  The  following  question  and
answer followed between Department Counsel and Applicant:
MS. DRISKILL: So that whatever – if there was something in your system,
it was out of your system by then?
APPLICANT:  I  guess  that’s  what  she  said  that  for.  I  just  –  I  didn’t  really
know what – you know, what to think of whatnot. I wanted to take it again.
MS. DRISKILL: Uh-huh.
APPLICANT: But, you know, I just – I didn’t – I didn’t want to risk having to
go to jail for something that I didn’t know, you know, what a false positive
or what that was. (Tr. 69-70)
Applicant was unemployed in April 2018 when  he took the ASAP urinalysis. (Tr.
71-72)  He  did  not  report  this  positive  urinalysis  to  an  employer  because  he  was  not
working at the time. (Tr. 74-75)
Character Evidence
Applicant submitted  five  reference  letters, three  from  close  friends, and  two  from
colleagues. The  collective  sense  of  these  references conveys  that Applicant is honest,
trustworthy, dependable, family  oriented, and  an  asset to  any  organization. (Tr. 88; AE
E)   He  played   semi-professional basketball   overseas,  was  player   of   the   year and  male
athlete of the year in 2004,  and was recruited by a professional basketball team. (AE G)
