Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. She is 50 years old, single, and she
does not have any children. She earned a bachelor’s degree in 1995. She has worked as
an engineer for her employer, a DOD contractor, since 1995, but her medical issues since
2017  affected her ability to  work full-time, as further discussed below.  She  returned to
work full-time in July 2022. She has held a security clearance since 1996. (Answer; Tr. at

The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  had  eight  delinquent  consumer  debts  totaling
$56,284 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a - 1.h) and a $62 delinquent medical debt (SOR ¶¶ 1.i). The SOR
allegations are established by Applicant’s admissions  in her Answer, her 2020 security
clearance application  (SCA),  a  June 2020  background  interview,  and  by  credit  bureau
reports from 2020 and 2021. (Answer; GE 1-4)
Applicant began to incur delinquent debts in 2017, after she was in a near-fatal car
accident  and  sustained  injuries  that  caused  her  to  be  out  of  work  for  six  months.  Her
employer  placed  her  on  short-term  disability,  and  she  earned  only  half  of  her  annual
income  at  the  time,  or  approximately  $44,000.  She  subsequently  received  a  $19,000
settlement, which she applied toward the expenses that accrued while she was on short-
term disability. From January to May 2020, her employer again placed her on short-term
disability. She earned approximately $45,000 during this period. From March to July 2022,
her  employer  placed  her  on  short-term  disability  for  a  third  time.  She  earned
approximately $46,000 during this period. (Tr. at 32, 37-38, 45-50, 52-53, 55, 58-69; GE

debts. In June 2021, she made payments of $1,012 to SOR ¶ 1.c and $468 to SOR ¶ 1.g.
She stated that when she contacted the creditor in around August 2022  to resolve her
remaining balances of $5,464 and $874, respectively, the creditor informed her that it had
closed  both  accounts  with  a  zero  balance.  She  was  awaiting  documentation  from  the

her associate, to whom she owed $2,300 as of the date of the hearing. She established
a payment plan of $283 monthly,  from July to December  2022, and she made a $283
payment in July 2022, to resolve SOR ¶ 1.e. (Tr. at 38-41, 50-52; GE 2; AE C, D, M)
SOR ¶ 1.f is for an account in collection for $2,118. Applicant stated in her SCA
that she was in the process of settling this debt. In May 2021, the creditor offered her a
