Under Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed $180,585 for 22
delinquent or past-due debts (SOR 1.a – 1.v). In response to the SOR (Answer), Applicant
admitted  the  allegations  at  SOR  1.a  –  1.h,  1.j  –  1.m,  1.q,  1.s,  and  1.u.  He  denied  the
remaining allegations, and he provided explanatory remarks with all of his responses. At
the end of the hearing, as provided for by paragraph E3.1.17 of the Directive, Department
Counsel moved to amend the SOR based on information developed during the hearing.
(Tr. 92 – 98) I granted the motion and amended the SOR to add, as SOR 1.w, the following
allegation:
You   failed   to   timely   file,  as  required,  your  federal  and   state   income   tax
returns for at least  2018  through  2021.  As of the  date  of  this Amendment to
Statement of Reasons, the returns remain unfiled.
Because the record remained open after the hearing, I allowed Applicant to defer
his response to the new allegation until September 9, 2022, when his other post-hearing
submissions were due. I have included in the record as HX 3 a copy of the amendment
and Applicant’s response, in which he admitted the additional allegation. (Tr. 95 – 97) In
addition  to  the  facts  established  by  Applicant’s  admissions  to  the  original  SOR  and  to
SOR 1.w, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  38  years  old  and  works  for  a  defense  contractor  in  a  position  that
requires he be eligible for access to classified information. His current employment began
in July 2022, but his previous employer, for whom he still works in a similar position on a
part-time  basis,  sponsored  his  March  2020  security  clearance  application.  Applicant
served as an active duty and reserve member of the U.S. Navy between 2004 and 2007.
He  first  received  a  security  clearance  in  2004.  After  earning  bachelor’s  and  master’s
degrees in 2014 and 2015, respectively, he began studying for a doctoral degree in 2016,
but completed only one semester. (GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 54, 79)
Applicant was married from February 2005 until December 2020, when he and his
ex-wife finalized a divorce. They separated in 2016. Applicant has a son, age 15, and a
daughter, age 18, with his ex-wife. He has full custody of his son. When they separated,
Applicant and his ex-wife agreed that Applicant would provide between $600 and $1,000
each month to support his daughter. After their daughter turned 18 in December 2021,
his child support obligation ended. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 57, 77 – 79)
In   Section   26   (Financial  Record)   of  his  e-QIP,  Applicant  disclosed   that  he   had
experienced  “financial hardships”  after separating  from his ex-wife  in  2016. He  also  listed
a  credit counseling  resource with  whom  he  was working  to  resolve  his debts.  He did not
list  any   of   the   debts  in  his  e-QIP;  however,  credit  reports  obtained   by   government
investigators shortly  after he  submitted  his e-QIP  reflect the  debts alleged  in SOR 1.a  –
1.v.  Additionally,  Applicant  discussed   those   debts   during   a   personal  subject  interview
(PSI) on  April 16, 2020. (GX 1  –  5; GX 7)
The  debts  alleged  at  SOR  1.a  –  1.h,  and  1.j  –  1.m  are  for  student  loans  that
became delinquent in April 2017. They total $153,943, or about 85 percent of the total
debt alleged in the SOR.  Applicant obtained the loans between 2010 and  2016 to pay
tuition for his undergraduate and graduate studies. They were in forbearance when he
matriculated for his doctoral studies; however, those studies only lasted one semester in
2016. Applicant dis-enrolled because he and his ex-wife had separated and he decided
could not continue his studies while meeting his obligations as a single father and still
work enough hours to pay child support. After he stopped going to school, his loans were
no  longer  eligible  for  forbearance.  After  a  subsequent  grace  period,  his  student  loans
came due; however, he could not afford to pay them. (Answer; GX 2; AX A; Tr. 50 – 51,
79)
In June 2020, Applicant applied for relief from his student loans through the Public
Service  Loan  Forgiveness  (PSLF)  program.  PSLF  is  a  U.S.  Department  of  Education
(USDE) program that may allow certain employees of federal, state, and local agencies,
or  of  not-for-profit  organizations,  to  obtain  relief  from  or  forgiveness  of  student  loans
underwritten  by  the  federal  government.  Information  about  PSLF  found  on  the  USDE
webpage  (https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service),
and on Applicant’s application, lists the qualification requirements regarding, in relevant
part, type of employment, type of loan, and history of payment. Applicant did not present
information that shows he meets any of those qualifications. Even though his employer
contracts with the federal government, it is a for-profit company, a category specifically
excluded from PSLF. Additionally, Applicant did not show that he has made 120 qualifying
payments on his loans.  As to  the  type  of  loan  eligible  for PSLF, it  appears Applicant’s
loans are included in that program. (AX P; Tr. 40 – 41, 48 – 49, 56)
On  April  28,  2021,  Applicant  began  a  student  loan  rehabilitation  program
repayment plan. Under that plan, he consolidated all of his delinquent student loans into
one monthly payment. He was required to pay $5.00 each month for at least nine months.
If  he  did  so,  his  loans  no  longer  would  be  delinquent  and  would  start  making  higher,
income-based payments. Applicant made two or three payments, then stopped because
of  government-directed  suspension  of  payments  during  the  COVID-19  epidemic.  His
loans were then sold to another servicing corporation and he was advised to consolidate
his  loans  before  he  could  resume  his  rehabilitation  program  or  embark  any  other
repayment plan. On August 2, 2022, 16 days before his hearing, Applicant resubmitted
his PSLF application and a request to consolidate his loans. A credit report dated August
10,  2022,  lists  his  student  loans  as  deferred  until  November  2022,  at  which  time  he
estimates his monthly payments will be about $700. Based on all of the foregoing, I find
that Applicant’s student loans are not currently delinquent. However, he is not eligible for
PSLF and, after his current deferral ends, he will have to begin repaying all of the student
loans alleged in the SOR. (Answer; GX 3 – 5; GX 7; AX C; Tr. 51 – 57)
In  June  2019,  Applicant  enlisted  the  services  of  a  financial  counseling  firm  to
resolve debts that remained from his marriage.  He averred that the financial counselor
with whom he worked used improper methods to make it seem as if those debts he felt
were  his  ex-wife’s  responsibility  had  been  resolved  and  his  credit  rating  restored.  He
explained that she froze his credit and claimed to have corresponded with his creditors.
Because he thought the financial counseling firm had resolved his financial problems, he
took no further action, even after his PSI in April 2020.  After he received the SOR, he
contacted  another  financial  counseling  firm  who  guided  him  through  the  process  of
corresponding directly with his creditors to negotiate settlement of his debts. He testified
that  he  sent  letters  to  his  creditors,  but  that  he  has  not  followed  through  on  any  other
actions recommended by the second financial counseling firm. (Attachments to Answer;
GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 41 – 43, 63 – 66, 79 – 83)
The debt alleged at SOR 1.i is the remainder due from a car loan Applicant stopped
paying in March 2016. He claims the car was assessed as a total loss after a flood, and
that  gap  insurance  should  have  covered  the  balance  left  on  the  loan.  In  July  2022,
Applicant made a $500 payment, which left a remaining balance of $5,466. At hearing,
he claimed that he had reached a settlement with the creditor whereby this debt would be
resolved for $500. He has since satisfied the debt, but the record is not clear regarding
how much he had to pay to do so. Nonetheless, SOR 1.i is resolved. (Answer; GX 2; GX
3; AX D; AX O; Tr. 41 – 43, 58 – 61)
Applicant denies he is responsible for the $1,221 debt at SOR 1.n, claiming instead
that  it  his  ex-wife’s  obligation.  The  debt  is  for  an  unpaid  loan,  originally  for  $800,  he
obtained in 2016.  Credit reports list this as Applicant’s  individual account. The creditor
has agreed to accept $500 to resolve this debt. Applicant did present information showing
he actually has paid this debt and it remains unresolved. (Answer; GX 2 – 4; GX 7; AX B;
AX E; Tr. 43 – 44, 62 – 63)
Applicant denies he is responsible for the $588 debt at SOR 1.o. The debt is for
an  unpaid  utility  bill  he  claims  is  his  ex-wife’s  obligation.  Credit  reports  list  this  as
Applicant’s individual account. Despite having discussed this debt during his PSI, he did
not pay it until four days before his hearing. (Answer; GX 2; AX B; AX F; Tr. 44, 62 – 63)
Applicant denies he is responsible for the $560 debt at SOR 1.p, claiming instead
that it his ex-wife’s obligation. Credit reports list this as Applicant’s individual account. In
August 2022, the creditor agreed to accept $757 (after interest and penalties) to resolve
this debt through monthly payments of $122. Applicant made the first payment on August
1, 2022. This debt is not yet resolved. (Answer; GX 2; GX 3; GX 4; GX 7; AX B; AX E; Tr.
44, 62 – 63)
The  $224  and  $138  debts  alleged  at  SOR  1.q  and  1.s,  respectively,  are  for
overpayment of GI Bill benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). As of May
2021, Applicant’s VA debts were resolved. (Answer; AX B; AX H; Tr. 44 – 45)
The $205 debt alleged at SOR 1.r is for unpaid insurance premiums that remained
when Applicant switched insurance carriers. He claims he was unaware of the debt until
he received the SOR in April 2021. He paid the debt on August 1, 2022. (Answer; GX 3;
GX 4; GX 7; AX B; AX I)
Applicant denies he is responsible for the $4,555 debt at SOR 1.t, claiming instead
that  it  his  ex-wife’s  obligation.  The  debt  became  delinquent  in  March  2020  and  was
discussed during Applicant’s PSI. Credit reports list this as Applicant’s individual account.
The creditor has agreed to accept $396 monthly payments, the first of which Applicant
made on August 1, 2022. (Answer; GX 2; GX 3; GX 4; GX 7; AX B; AX J; Tr. 45 – 46)
Applicant denies he is responsible for the $12,179 debt at SOR 1.u. It represents
the remainder after resale of a car he owned before he and his ex-wife separated. It was
repossessed in August 2016. During his PSI, in response to the SOR, and at hearing,
Applicant claimed his ex-wife agreed to make the payments for this car but failed to do
so. Credit reports list this as Applicant’s individual account. On August 1, 2022, Applicant
reached  a  repayment  agreement  with  this  creditor  and  made  the  first  of  three  $1,624
payments to settle this debt for about one-third of the actual amount due. This debt is not
resolved. (Answer; GX 2 – 4; GX 7; AX K; Tr. 46 – 47)
SOR 1.v  alleges that,  as of  the  date  of  the  SOR, Applicant owed  $868  in unpaid
state   taxes  and   that,   in   September  2011,   the   state   obtained   a   tax   lien   against  him   to
enforce that debt.  Available information  shows that he  satisfied  the  lien  in April 2013. SOR
1.v is resolved for Applicant.  (Answer; GX 2; GX 5; GX 6; AX L;  Tr. 47, 65  –  66)
As  alleged  in  SOR  1.w,  Applicant  has  not  filed  his  federal  or  state  income  tax
returns since 2018. During cross-examination regarding the current state of Applicant’s
personal finances, Department Counsel asked him if he had complied on time with his
federal and state income tax reporting  obligations. Applicant disclosed that he has not
filed  any personal income tax returns  since 2018.  Based on  the advice  of  a friend,  he
believed he only had to file his income tax returns every three years. Applicant admitted
this  allegation  in  response  to  the  Government’s  SOR  amendment.  He  also  provided
information showing that he filed for filing extensions for the 2018 and 2020 tax years. He
did not provide information that shows he has actually filed any tax returns for the 2018
through 2021 tax years,  although he has gathered the  information he needs  to file his
2021 returns. (AX N; AX Q; HX 3; Tr. 66 – 68)
Applicant claims his current finances are sound and that he meets all of his current
obligations on time. He is working full time for one defense contractor and part time for
another. He  works between  46  and  70  hours weekly  and  earns  between  $53,000  and
$56,000 annually. Applicant has been living with his mother in a house she owns and has
been contributing about $800 monthly for her mortgage. As of the hearing, he planned to
move in with a girlfriend. As to his ability to start paying his student loans when his deferral
ends, he stated he would be able to because he no longer has to pay child support for his
older child. Apart from answering general questions about his finances, he did not provide
any detailed information from which to gauge his ability to repay his student loans when
his deferment ends, or that might shed better light on how he manages his income and
expenses each month. (Tr. 57, 68 – 76)
