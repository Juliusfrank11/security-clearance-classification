Applicant  is  a  59-year-old  packaging  engineer  for  a  Government  contractor,
employed since 1984. He earned an associate’s degree in 2016. He married in 1993 and
divorced nine months later. He remarried in 2001, and has one adult child. He has held
security clearances since 1985.
The  SOR  alleges  under  Guideline  F  that  Applicant  has  seven  delinquent  debts
including  loans  and  credit  card  accounts,  totaling  about  $42,971  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  to  1.g);
three Federal student loans in collections, totaling about $1,908 (SOR ¶¶ 1.h to 1.j); and
three medical debts in collections, totaling $238 (SOR ¶¶ 1.k-1.m). Applicant admitted all
of  the  debts  except  for  the  student  loans,  claiming  the  IRS  captured  his  refunds  and
applied them to his debts. The evidence submitted by the Government supports all of the
SOR allegations.
SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.g and 1.k to 1.m are bank loans, credit card accounts, and medical
debts that have been charged off or are in collections. Applicant admitted the debts and
testified  that  he  has  not  taken  action  to  resolve  them.  He  stated  that  he  became
overextended  on  loans  and  credit  while  supporting  his  daughter,  who  suffered  from
alcoholism and homelessness, and her two children. His debts occurred largely between
2015 and 2016, where he used one account to pay on other accounts. He argues that he
has not accumulated new debt since 2018 or 2019, but he has no payment plans nor has
he made payments toward his delinquent accounts.
SOR ¶¶ 1.h to 1.j are student loans in collections. He testified that the IRS has
recaptured $2,616 and applied it to his student loans, and he had a garnishment order
from March 2018 to April 2019. When he answered the SOR, he believed the loans were
paid, but after inquiring with the Department of Education after his hearing, he discovered
that he still owed $1,909. He initiated a payment plan and made one payment of $59.21
on October 26, 2022.
Applicant testified that he currently cannot afford to pay any debts and he had not
contacted  any  creditors.  He  began  working  with  a  credit  repair  service  in  February  or
March 2022, and opened a secured credit card. He hopes to improve his credit rating. He
lives  paycheck-to-paycheck,  does  not  have  a  budget,  and  has  not  had  financial
counseling.  He  has  about  $1,350  in  cash,  a 401k  retirement  fund, and  claims  to  have
about $500 to $600 in net monthly remainder after paying expenses.
