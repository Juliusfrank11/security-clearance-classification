Applicant is a 38-year-old employee of a government contractor for whom he has
worked  since  May  2021.  He  has  a  high  school  diploma  and  took  some  technical
courses  in  2014  and  2015,  but  did  not  earn  an  additional  degree.  He  was  married  in
2007,  but  he  has  been  separated  from  his  spouse  since  2012.  He  has  two  children
(ages six and two) with his current partner, with whom he has resided since about 2018.
He served on active duty with the U.S. Marines from 2003 until 2011, when he received
an honorable discharge. (Tr. 17-20, 46, 49; GE 1, 2)
In  the  SOR,  the  Government  alleged  Applicant’s  six  delinquent  debts  totaling
loans,  a
approximately  $53,000.  These  delinquencies  consisted  of  automobile
telecommunications  debt,  and  a  utility  debt.  Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  SOR
allegations  with  additional  comment.  His  admissions  are  adopted  as  findings  of  fact.
(Answer; GE 1-5)
Applicant  attributed   his  financial   issues   to   a   lack   of  employment   and   his   2012
separation  from  his estranged  spouse.  He  had  a  break in  employment from  May  2019
until  December  2019.  He  has   been   employed   since   December   2019   and   earns   about
$80,000  annually.  He worked  as a  government contractor in Country  A  from 2019  until
about  May   2021.   His  girlfriend,   with   whom   he   shares   income   and   expenses,   earns
about $2,200  per month  since  March 2022.  From  2017  until 2018,  he  hired  and  paid a
debt   consolidation   company   to   help   him   resolve   his  delinquencies.   He  stopped   using
this  company   because   he   was  not   happy   with   the   work  they   were   doing.   When   he
returned   to   the   U.S.  from   Country   A,  he   had   about  $17,000   to   $18,000   in  his  savings
account,  some of  which he  claimed he  used  to  pay  his delinquencies. At the hearing, he
claimed   that   he   had   about   $2,000   in   his  savings  account.   He   claimed   he   saves  about
$1,000  per month  after paying  all  his bills, but does not follow  a  written  budget.  (Tr. 19-

The  $12,120  automobile  loan  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.a  has  not  been  resolved.
Applicant  opened  this  account  in  2017  to  purchase  a  vehicle  on  credit.  Because  of  a
lack  of  employment,  he  could  not  afford  the  monthly  payments.  The  last  payment  he
made  on  this  account  was  in  December  2018.  At  about  this  time  he  voluntarily
surrendered the vehicle. In the beginning of 2020, he contacted the creditor to make a
payment arrangement, but was unable to come to an agreement on one. (Tr. 21-24, 39;
Answer; GE 2-5)
The  $10,015  automobile  loan  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.b  has  not  been  resolved.
Applicant  co-signed  on  this account  to purchase a vehicle for his estranged spouse in
2011. He has disputed this debt because he believes his wife should be responsible for
it  and  because  the  debt  was  old.  The  separation  agreement  between  him  and  his
estranged spouse does not provide that his estranged spouse is solely responsible for
this  debt.  Applicant  is  jointly  and  severally  responsible  for  the  debt.  He  has  not  made
any  payment  arrangements  or  payments  on  this  debt  after  it  became  delinquent.  (Tr.
30-34, 39; Answer; GE 2-4)
The $6,828 automobile loan alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c has not been resolved. At the
hearing,  Applicant  disputed  owing  this  debt  because  he  believed  his  estranged  wife
should  be  responsible  for  it.  He  provided  no  evidence  that  any  separation  agreement
provided  that  his  estranged  spouse  is  solely  responsible  for  this  debt.  At  hearing,  he
testified that he did not know about this debt, but during his 2019 security interview, he
told  an  investigator that  it  was for an auto  loan and  that he and  his estranged spouse
purchased the vehicle. He and his estranged wife are jointly and severally liable for the
debt.  He  has  not  made  any  payment  arrangements  or  payments  on  this  debt  after  it
became delinquent. (Tr. 34-37, 39; Answer; GE 2-4)

30, 39; GE 1-5)
