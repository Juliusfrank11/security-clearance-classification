Applicant is 62 years old. He married his wife  in 1986, and they have two adult
sons. He earned a  bachelor’s degree  in  1982. He has worked for a defense contractor
since  1982  as  a  supply-chain  analyst.  He  has  held  a  DOD  secret  clearance  since
approximately 2004. (Item 3; Item 4)
The   record  evidence   shows  that   Applicant  has  significant   outstanding   financial
obligations,  to include:  (1)  approximately  $43,729 in  delinquent Federal income  taxes for
tax  years  2008-2012, 2014-2015, and  2018-2019  (SOR ¶¶  1.a-1.e, 1.g, 1.h, 1.j, and  1.k.);
(2) $3,247  in outstanding  State  A  taxes for tax  year 2018  (SOR ¶  1.l.); and  (3) various
consumer and  mortgage  debts delinquent in the  approximate  amount of  $16,534.  (SOR
¶¶   1.m-1.p)  The   record   evidence   further  demonstrates   that,   with   the   exception   of   tax
years 2011  and  2017,  Applicant has failed  to  timely  file his Federal  income  tax  returns
for years 2008 through 2019.  (Item 1; Item 2; Item 3;  Item  4; Item 5;  Item 6)
In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all SOR allegations, except SOR
¶¶ 1.f. and 1.i, in which he denied that that he failed to file his 2013 and 2016 Federal
income tax returns. He also claimed he had entered into a repayment plan with one of his
consumer creditors (SOR ¶ 1.n), and that he had executed a deed in lieu of foreclosure
for  his  delinquent  timeshare.  (SOR  ¶  1.p.)  He  did  not  provide  any  supporting
documentation to corroborate his assertions regarding SOR ¶¶ 1.f, 1.i, 1.n and 1.p.  (Item
2)
In his February 2018 SCA, Applicant disclosed several delinquent accounts and
his unpaid Federal taxes  for tax years 2008-2015.  He claimed he was  in  a  repayment
plan  with  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS).  In  his  January  2021  response  to
Interrogatories, he provided Federal tax account transcripts for tax years 2008 through
2019, except for tax years 2013 and 2016. Several of the transcripts showed that he had
entered  into  multiple  installment  agreements  with  the  IRS,  but  failed  to  adhere  to  the
payment arrangements. (Item 3; Item 4)
Applicant was placed on notice that he had 30 days after receipt of the FORM to
supply additional information to mitigate the Guideline F security concerns. His failure to
submit any material would result in me making a determination based on documentation
provided solely by the Government. Applicant chose not to submit any documentation.
