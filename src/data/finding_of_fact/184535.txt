In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted all of the allegations, with explanations. His
admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence,
I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 33-year-old employee of a federal contractor working as an aircraft
electrician since March 2022. He holds an associate’s degree and a certification. He is
single, never married, and has no children. He was unemployed from October 2019 to
February 2020, February 2015 to January 2016, and March 2013 to October 2013.  (Tr.
4, 6, 24-25; GE 1)
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged eight delinquent accounts (student loans, car
debt, medical debt, and other consumer debts) totaling approximately $54,119. The debts
are established by credit reports from September 2020, April 2021, June 2021, and July
2022; Applicant’s personal subject interview (PSI) with an investigator in October 2020;
and his SOR response admissions (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.h). (GE 3, 5-8; Answer to SOR)
Under Guideline H, the SOR alleged that Applicant used marijuana with varying
frequency from about January 2011 to January 2017. This allegation is established by
Applicant’s admissions to an investigator during his October 2020 PSI, his admissions in
his January 2021 security clearance application (SCA), and his admissions in his SOR
response (SOR ¶ 2.a). (GE 2-3; Answer to SOR)
Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant deliberately falsified material
facts in his August 2020 SCA when he failed to list his marijuana use, as described in
SOR ¶ 2.a, in Section 23 of the SCA. It also alleged that Applicant falsified material facts
in his August 2020 and January 2021 SCAs when he failed to list his delinquent debts,
as described in SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.h, in Section 26 of the SCAs. (SOR ¶¶ 3.a – 3.c)
Financial Considerations
Applicant’s  financial  difficulties  began  after  he  finished  school  and  received  his
associate’s degree and his certificate. He financed his education with student loans. He
stated that at one time he had approximately $140,000 worth of student-loan debt. All but
approximately $60,000 of it was forgiven because the school that funded the loans went
out of business. He provided no corroboration for this assertion.
The   history   and   current  status  of  Applicant’s  student  loans  is  as   follows:  His
September 2020  credit  report  reflects  that a  national student-loan-servicing  company  was
assigned  Applicant’s student loans in  April 2015, with  a  balance  of $29,856.  The  date  of
last   activity   is  listed   as  May   2018.  The   status  of   the   loans  is  listed   as  “closed”  and   a
“charged-off  account.” The  credit report also  reflects that the  account was “purchased  by
another  lender.”   His  most   recent   credit   report  from   July   2022   still   shows  the   loans   as
charged  off. This credit report also lists 15  other student loans in the  name  of  a  federal
agency, with  a  total balance  of approximately  $59,648. None  of  these  loans show  a  “past
due” characterization  on  the  credit report. Applicant stated  that these  loans are currently
deferred, although  he  was not sure of  the  reason  for the  deferment.  Most likely, these
student  loans  are  deferred   because   of   the   Presidential  Executive   Order  deferring   all
student-loan  payments  and  interest accumulation  because  of the  COVID-19  pandemic.
There is no  evidence  linking  the  SOR listed  charged-off  student loans  with  the  15  currently
deferred student loans. (Tr. 30-32, 48, 66; GE 5, 8)
Applicant  claimed  that  the  car debt list  in SOR ¶  1.c was erroneous because  he
held  the   title   to   the   car.  He  did  not  produce   documentation   to   corroborate   that   he
possessed   a   free   and   clear  title   for  the   car.   For  all   the   remaining   delinquent  debts,
Applicant  claimed   that   he   paid   a   debt  repair   company   (DRC)  approximately   $3,000   in
August 2020. Once  he  hired  the  DRC, he  believed  it would “clean-up” his debt. He was
advised  by  the  DRC not to  pay  any  of  the  debts so  they  would “drop  off” his credit report.
Aside  from  his one-time  payment  to  the  DRC,  he  has  not made  any  payments  toward  his
SOR  debts.   He   stated   that   he   would  produce   documentation   showing   his  contractual
arrangement with  the  DRC. He did not do  so. SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.g  are based  upon  the
same underlying debt and  therefore, I  find  for Applicant on SOR ¶ 1.g. (Tr.24, 29-30, 41-
42, 63, 68-69-70; GE  5)
Applicant’s annual salary is between $50,000 and $60,000. He does not have any
savings currently. He is living in a recreational vehicle that his brother financed. He pays
his brother $800 per month to repay this loan. (Tr. 72, 74)
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
Applicant  admitted  in  his  testimony  that  he  used  marijuana  infrequently  starting
when his was about 22. He was not working for a federal contractor then. He knew it was
illegal  when  he  used  it.  He  listed  on  his  January  2021  SCA  that  he  stopped  using
marijuana in 2017, but he does not really recall the date. On cross-examination, he stated
that he had not used marijuana in the last two years. He understood that marijuana use
is illegal under federal law and prohibited by federal contractor employees. His company
does random drug testing and he was tested three times before he was hired.
Personal Conduct
Applicant failed to list his marijuana use under Section 23 of his August 2020 SCA.
He listed that activity when he completed his January 2021 SCA. He explained that the
reason for his omission on his earlier SCA was because he was not at his home when he
was completing it, and he did not have access to records that would  have  helped him
remember his activities seven years back. In between his first and second SCAs, he was
interviewed by an investigator in October 2020 and failed to disclose his marijuana use
between 2011 and 2017. When he completed the second SCA in January 2021, he was
at his home location. He also contacted people at work and asked about  this question,
and he was told to list his marijuana use on the SCA. I did not find Applicant’s explanation
credible. (Tr. 33-35; GE 1-2)
Applicant also failed to list his delinquent debts on either of his SCAs when asked
to do so in Section 26 of each one. Applicant explained that he did not list the debts on
his SCAs because he had hired the DRC and believed his debts were being resolved. He
admitted on cross-examination that he was asked about his debts  and made aware of
their delinquent status when he was interviewed by an investigator in October 2020. He
claimed he had no intent to deceive the government about his debt status. I did not find
Applicant’s testimony credible. (Tr. 40-42, 61; GE 1-2)
