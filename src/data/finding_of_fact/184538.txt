The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  had  six  delinquent  consumer  debts  totaling
$40,752  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.h).  Applicant  listed  his  delinquent  debts  on  his  SCA,  and  he
discussed them during his January 2021 background interview. A December 2020 credit
bureau  report  lists  all  of  the  SOR  debts,  and  a  March  2022  credit  bureau  report  lists
SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.e. (Items 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
Applicant’s  financial  issues  began  in  mid-2018,  when  he  became  financially
overextended due to medical and private tutoring expenses for his child. After his father
passed  away  in  late  2018,  he  was  despondent  and  did  not  handle  his  financial
obligations. As of his SCA, he had not yet taken action to resolve his debts due to a lack
of  funds.  He  indicated  during his background  interview  that  he  intended  to  resolve  his
delinquent debts; he cancelled his credit cards so that he would no  longer incur credit
card debt; and, he planned to cash out his 401(k) retirement account to pay his debts. In
his Answer, he  stated that he  was “trying to  find a remedy to remove these items from
my record.” He further stated, “Unfortunately I do not have a time table of when this will
be  completed,  if  at  all."  There  is  no  record  evidence  of  payment  toward  any  debts.
