Paragraphs  2.a.  and  3.a.  She  also  provided  additional  information  to  support  her
request for eligibility for a security clearance.
Applicant  is  35  years  old,  unmarried,  and  has  a  14-year-old  child.  (Item  3  at

1.a.,   2.a.,   and   3.a.  In  October  of  2016,  Applicant  admits  that  she  was  charged
with,  and  subsequently  convicted  of,  Driving  While  Intoxicated  (DWI).  She  was
incarcerated  for  ten  days,  placed  on  probation  for  two  years,  and  her  license  was
restricted for 12 months. Her restriction, in part, required the use of an Ignition Interlock
System,  of  which  Applicant  claims  she  was  unaware.  This  restriction  is  evidenced  by
court records. (Item 4 at page 2.)
1.b.,   2.a.,   and   3.a.  About   11   months  later,   in   September  2017,  Applicant  was
charged   with   and   convicted   of:  Refusal  of  Breath   Test  –  2nd  Offense,  Operating   a
Vehicle   on   a   Suspended   or  Revoked   License,  and   Operating   a   Vehicle   Without  an
Ignition   Interlock   System.   (Item   4   at   pages  7~16.)   She   was  incarcerated   for  ten   days,
and placed on probation  for three years.
1.c., 2.a.,  and  3.a. About six months later, in March 2018, Applicant admits that
she  was  charged  with  and  convicted  of  Operating  a  Vehicle  on  a  Suspended  or
Revoked License. (Item 4 at pages 17~20.)
Guideline J: Criminal Conduct
2.a. See above discussion.
2.b.  About  a  month  after  her  Paragraph  1.c.  allegation,  noted  above,  in  April  of
2018,  Applicant  admits  she  was  charged  and  convicted  of  ASAP  Non  comply/Show
Cause  (Operating  a  Vehicle  Without  an
Interlock  System).  She  was
incarcerated for ten days, and placed on probation for two years.
Ignition
2.c.  A  few  days  later,  in  April  of  2018,  Applicant  admits  she  was  charged  and
convicted  of  Good  Behavior/Show  Cause  (Operating  a  Vehicle  Without  an  Ignition
Interlock System). She was incarcerated for ten days,  and placed on probation for two
years.
2.d.  Less  than  two  years  later,  in  March  of  2020,  Applicant  admits  she  was
charged  and  convicted  of  Misdemeanor  Driving  Under  Revocation  or  Suspension.
Applicant was placed on probation until May of 2022.
Guideline E: Personal Conduct
3.a. See above discussion.
3.b.  In  answer  to  “Section  22- Police  Record  –  In  the  last  seven  (7)  years,”
Applicant answered “No,” and failed to disclose any of her six convictions that occurred
from 2016~2020. (Item 3 at page 33.) I find this to be a willful falsification.
