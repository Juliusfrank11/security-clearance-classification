Guideline F - Financial Considerations
1.a.,  1.c.~1.e.,  and  1.g.~1.j. Applicant admits to owing eight past-due debts totaling
about $69,776. Despite having about ten months (September 2021~July 2022) to do so,
Applicant has submitted nothing further in this regard. These allegations are found against
Applicant.
1.b. Applicant claims that the alleged past-due debt to Creditor B for about $1,179
“has been paid in full.” As this debt appears as past-due on the Government’s most recent
March  2021  credit  report  (Item  5  at  page  2);  and  Applicant  has  submitted  nothing  in
support of her averment, this allegation is found against Applicant.
1.f. Applicant denies the  alleged  past-due, medical debt to  Creditor F in the  amount
of   about  $3,738.  As  this  debt  appears  as  past-due   on   the   Government’s  March  2020
credit report  (Item  6  at  page  11); and  Applicant has submitted  nothing  in support of her
averment, this allegation is found against Applicant

to the SOR (Item 2 at page 4), and in her response to DOHA interrogatories  (Item 4 at

avers she was told there were no “unpaid bills.” Applicant thus claims she was unaware
