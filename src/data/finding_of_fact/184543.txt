The SOR alleges that, as of November 12, 2021, Applicant owed $51,424 in federal
student loans in collections status  (SOR ¶ 1.a) and a $630 medical debt in collections
(SOR ¶ 1.b). When Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, he admitted the debts
without explanation.
Based on his admissions, I accept and incorporate as factual findings that Applicant
defaulted on the SOR debts. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I
make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 46-year-old planning production control specialist who has worked for
a defense contractor since December 2020. (GE 2; Tr. 25-26.) He was married to his first
wife from March 1999 to May 2021. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 22-23.) She worked in a bank, earning
$50,000 a year, and handled the household finances during their marriage. (Tr. 35, 39-40.)
Applicant and his current spouse wed in October 2021. (Tr. 22-23.) Her 15-year-old
son lives with them. (Tr. 33.) Applicant has two sons now ages 21 and 14 from his first
marriage for whom he paid child support of $1,300 per month. As of the close of the record
in this case, he had a hearing scheduled for August 3, 2022, to remove his older son from
his child support obligation. He expects to pay around $788 per month for child support for
his younger son going forward. (Tr. 23-24.)
Applicant earned his associate’s degree in July 2007. He completed his bachelor’s
degree  in  business  management  online.  (GE  2;  Tr.  24-25.)  On  a  November  5,  2020
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86), he indicated that he took courses
from  September  2012  to  May  2014  at  the  online  university  from  which  he  earned  his
bachelor’s degree. (GE 1.) During a personal subject interview (PSI) with an authorized
investigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on December 17, 2020 (GE 2),
he stated that he earned his bachelor’s degree in May 2009.  On January 21, 2021, he was
confronted  by  the  investigator  with  information  showing  that  he  took  online  classes
between July 2010 and November 2014 with breaks in his attendance. He disputed the
information and stated that he was awarded his bachelor’s degree in May 2009. (GE 2.)
Student loan information reported on his credit report (GE 3) appears to corroborate the
enrollment dates reported by the university.
Applicant’s December 2020 credit report shows that he obtained student loans to
pay  for  his  college  education,  including  eight  federal  student  loans  totaling  $34,033
obtained through the schools  between December 2005 and July 2010, and a $16,192
student loan acquired in May 2014. As of November 2020, those loans were in collections
status with an aggregate balance of $51,424. Between July 2007 and December 2007,
Applicant obtained additional student loans totaling $14,646  that were being repaid on
time. As of  October 2020, the outstanding balances on those loans totaled only $994.
Applicant’s credit report also showed that a $630 medical debt from August 2018 was in
collections. (GE 3.)
Sometime  in  2018,  Applicant  found  a  collection  notice  for  his  defaulted  federal
student loans in the household trash. He confronted his then spouse about her failure to
make his student loan payments for him and told her to resolve the issue, but he did not
handle  it  himself.  When  he  tried  to  get  involved  in  the  household  finances, she would
“make it miserable,” and he did not want to deal with her. He was also overwhelmed by the
loan balances in collections. (Tr. 38-41.) Even after his marital separation in May 2020, he
took no steps to address his defaulted student loans because he was focused on obtaining
custody of his younger son and wanted to ensure that he had the funds to pay for any legal
fees incurred. (Tr. 41-42.)
Applicant  disclosed  on  his  November  2020  SF  86  that  he  was  in  default  of  his
federal student loans totaling about $50,000. In response to  an SF 86 inquiry into any
actions  taken  to  satisfy  the  debts,  Applicant  responded,  “got  an  email  about  loan
forgiveness.” (GE 1.) He provided no proof that he qualified for forgiveness, cancellation, or
discharge of any of his federal student-loan debts, and admitted at his June 2022 security
clearance  hearing that  none  of  his student-loan  debts  had  been  forgiven.  (Tr. 44.)  He
discovered that the email had been a scam. (Tr. 58.)
During his December 17, 2020 PSI, Applicant did not dispute that his federal student
loans were in collections status. He expressed an intention to satisfy the debts once his
divorce from his first wife was final. He explained that she had handled the household
finances  during  their  marriage  and  that,  unbeknownst  to  him  at  the  time  (Tr.  38),  she
stopped  making  payments  on  his  student  loans  when  the  monthly  payment  became
$2,500. He stated that the issue of his defaulted student loans was being worked out in his
divorce settlement. When confronted with the $630 medical debt in collection, Applicant did
not dispute the debt, and surmised that he and his first wife could be jointly liable as it was
for the care of one of their sons. He described his finances as improved since his divorce
filing, and he expressed a willingness and ability to repay his debts. (GE 3.)
Around the time of his marital breakup in 2020, Applicant asked a friend who is a
financial advisor if he should withdraw funds from his 401(k) account to pay his student
loans.  His  friend  advised  against  doing so  if  it  was  not  required  and  told  him  that  any
payments  would  adversely  impact  his  credit  as  they  would  reactivate  his  accounts.
Applicant gave priority to rebuilding his credit after a “pretty messy” divorce and took no
action that would reactive his student loan accounts. (Tr. 19-21, 42-44.)
In their divorce settlement, Applicant took responsibility for his defaulted student
loans and his car while his ex-wife was given the house, her car, and $100,000 of his
$300,000 in 401(k) assets. (Tr. 37, 50.) As of his June 29, 2022 security clearance hearing,
Applicant  had  not  attempted  to  rehabilitate  his  student  loans.  His  ex-wife  has  all  the
documentation for his student loans. She told him she does not know the whereabouts of
his student-loan documentation, although he has some doubts in that regard. (Tr. 54-55.)
Applicant testified that he is willing to pay off his student loans with funds from his
401(k) account, if necessary. (Tr. 19, 43.) He put off addressing his student loans in that
manner pending assurance from the Government that paying off his defaulted student
loans would fully resolve the security concerns. (Tr. 56.)
After Applicant received the SOR, he contacted his creditor to whom he owed the
$603 medical collection debt. He was informed the debt was for a 2018 procedure. He
plans to pay the debt after he receives requested documentation about the debt. (Tr. 44,
46.)
Applicant worked as a computer room supervisor for a company in the commercial
sector from January 2001 until October 2020, when he was terminated for failing to follow
company procedure. At the time of his termination, his salary was $82,000 annually. (GEs
1-2; Tr. 29.) He received unemployment compensation for a month or two before starting
his present employment in December 2020. (Tr. 29.)
Applicant’s  current  salary  with  the  defense  contractor  is  $73,000  annually.  He
started on second shift in December 2020 and was paid a shift differential of $6,000 until
he transitioned to the day shift. After his first year on the job, he received a pay increase
equivalent to 3% of his salary. (Tr. 27.) His spouse started working in 2021 as a preschool
teacher at $16 an hour. (Tr. 30.) She previously worked for a bank. (Tr. 35.) She owns their
home and does not have a mortgage. (Tr. 35.) She has a yearly condominium fee of $650.
(Tr. 59.) Applicant and his spouse split the household expenses. (Tr. 32, 35.) He described
their current household finances as “tight” with about $200 to $300 in discretionary monthly
income,  but  he  expects  their  finances  to  improve  once  his  child-support  obligation  is
reduced. (Tr. 51.) He has about $4,000 to $5,000 in his savings account and $200 in his
checking account. (Tr. 49.) He obtained an automobile loan for $21,323 in July 2016. As of
October 2020, he had been making his payments according to terms since late spring
2017. His loan was 30 days past due three times between November 2016 and April 2017.
(GE 3.)
As of June 2022, Applicant had paid about $10,000 in attorney fees for his divorce.
He  expects  to  incur  additional  legal  fees  for  the  hearing  to  reduce  his  child-support
obligation. (Tr. 36-37.)
