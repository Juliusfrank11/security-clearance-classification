In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions
are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 71-year-old project manager employed by a defense contractor. He
served  on active duty in  the  U.S. Air Force  from  July 1969  to April 1973. He attended
college  and  received  a bachelor’s degree  in June  1976. He participated  in the  U.S. Air
Force  Reserve  Officers  Training  Corps  in  college,  was  commissioned  as  an  Air  Force
officer, and served on active duty until he retired in November 1993. (FORM Item 6 at 7.)
He  has  worked  for  defense  contractors  since  December  2007  and  for  his  current
employer since August 2008. He first received a security clearance in July 1976.
Applicant married in February 1970 and divorced in March 1994. He married his
current spouse in April 1994. He has three adult children.
Applicant disclosed in his SCA that he failed to file federal income tax returns for
tax years 2014 to 2018 due to a “great increase in tax owed,” which he could not afford
to pay. He estimated that he owed $40,000 in federal taxes. (FORM Item 3 at 38.)  He
attributed the tax increase to an inheritance from his parents. (FORM Item 6 at 6.) He did
not  provide  any  information  about  the  amount  or  the  form  of  the  inheritance  or  the
circumstances in which the inheritance occurred.
Tax transcripts submitted by Applicant in response to DOD CAF interrogatories did
not include a transcript for 2014, but he admitted the debt for that tax year. The transcript
for 2015 reflects that Applicant obtained an extension of time and filed his 2015 return on
October 21, 2019. He did not file a return for 2016, and the IRS filed a substitute return.
He obtained an extension of time to file and filed his 2017 return on August 26, 2019. He
obtained an extension of time and filed his 2018 return on September 9, 2019. (FORM
Item 4 at 7-18.)
Applicant hired a professional tax service to negotiate and settle his tax debt.  In
June 2020, he  and his  wife made an installment  agreement  with  the  IRS providing for
payments of  $575  per month. (FORM  Item  2  at 4.) Applicant’s response  to  the  FORM
included documentary proof of the agreed payments through May 2022. (AX A.)
Applicant was given  a vacation time-share property by  “an  elderly  acquaintance
who could not afford to maintain it.” When the annual dues doubled, Applicant stopped
paying them and took action to terminate his membership. (FORM Item 4 at 5.) A credit
report from December 2019 reflected a delinquent debt placed for collection of $3,631.
(FORM Item 5 at 2.) The debt was for unpaid yearly maintenance dues. The time-share
owner  agreed  to  waive  the  past-due  fees  in  return  for  a  quit  claim  deed.  Applicant
submitted the quit claim deed in December 2020, and the debt was resolved. (FORM Item
2 at 6-7.)
