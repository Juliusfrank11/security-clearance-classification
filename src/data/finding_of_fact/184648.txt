In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied all of the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a
through 1.k with explanations.
Applicant is 40 years old and has been married since 2009. He has three children,
ages 13, 10, and 5 years old. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2006. He is also certified
in a specific management technique. (Tr. 16)
Applicant started working for federal contractors in 2007. He worked for one until
2010, when he was laid off and then unemployed for ten months. From 2012 to 2018, he
worked for another federal contractor before being laid off for a year. At the time of that
layoff,  he  was  earning  $89,000  annually.  His  employer  gave  him  $10,000  as
unemployment  assistance.  He  subsequently  applied  for  unemployment  benefits  and
received $400 to $500 monthly. He said the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR started
to accumulate during his layoff. His wife was working during his unemployment period,
although they were living separately. (Tr. 17-21, 23-27; GE 1)
In 2019, Applicant obtained a position with another federal contractor for whom
he worked until 2020. He earned $90,000 annually in that position. In 2020, he started his
current position, and earns $100,000 annually. His wife is the director of an engineering
program at a private university. They resumed living together in 2021. (Tr. 16, 23-24, 27;
GE 1)
Applicant obtained his first security clearance in 2015. (GE 1 at 34)  In May 2020,
he  submitted  his  second  security  clearance  application  (SCA).  In  it,  he  disclosed  an
$11,643 personal loan that became delinquent in 2019. He stated he was working on a
payment plan. (GE 1 at 36) He disclosed a $203 unpaid utility bill from 2019. He said he
contacted  the  company  to  make  a  payment  offer.  He  had  a  credit  card  that  was  in
collection with a $2,100 unpaid balance. He noted in his SCA that he was making $25
monthly payments on it. (GE 1 at 36 through 38)
In  July  2020,  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator  about
background issues and financial delinquencies. Applicant acknowledged that he relied on
credit cards to pay expenses after he lost his job in 2018. He reported that he intended to
establish repayment plans for 12 delinquent debts he discussed and said he would start
paying them in August 2020. (GE 2)
Based  on  a  credit  bureau  report  (CBR)  from  June  2020,  the  SOR  alleged  11
delinquent  debts  totaling  $26,779,  which  became  delinquent  between  2018  and  2021.
These debts were discussed in the above interview. (GE 3, GE 4) The status of the debts
are as follows:
1. The student loan alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a has a balance of $4,515, and was past
due $266, according to Applicant’s June 2020 CBR. Applicant said he has been making
a monthly minimum payment of $20 since October 2019. His evidence documents that
he made a $20 payment in March, April, and May 2021. He said the account is in good
standing. His September 2022  CBR reports the  loan  as “pays account as agreed.”  (Tr.
29-30, 58-62; GE 3 at 10; AE G, AE H, AE I) At some point, the loan was transferred to
another creditor. (Ex. M) The loan is currently in forbearance, as noted below:
In March 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the DoEd placed
all  federal  student  loans  in  forbearance  and  has  since  extended  the
student  loan  payment  pause  through  December  31,  2022.  The  pause
includes the following relief measures for eligible loans: a suspension of
loan payments; a 0% interest rate; and stopped collection on defaulted
loans. (See Federal Student Aid: https://studentaid.gov/announcements-
events/covid-19.)
2. The student loan alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b has a balance for $4,484, and was past
due  $199,  according  to  Applicant’s  June  2020  CBR.  Applicant  said  this  is  a  duplicate
allegation  of  the  loan  above,  and  it  bears  the  name  of  the  new  creditor  for  the  above
student  loan.  (Tr.  31-32;  AE  M)  This  student  loan  does  not  appear  on  Applicant’s
September 2022 CBR. It is a duplicate.
Applicant  testified  that  he  owes  about  $100,000  in  student  loans.  (Tr.  58)
According  to  the  September  2022  CBR,  his  student  loans  total  $104,434.  That  CBR
reports the loans as “pays account as agreed” and notes his last payment was in August
2022. The $4,515 student loan alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a, is reported as having a balance of
$4,745. It is not included in the $104,434 balance. (GE 3 at 10.) He said he has made
minimum payments on the loans since 2006 and they have not gone into collection. He
initially  borrowed  about  $70,000.  As  a  result  of  his  low  payments,  the  loans  have
accumulated a substantial amount of interest. He has not made larger payments because
he is trying to reduce other debts. (Tr. 59-62)
3. The $11,643 debt alleged in SOR  ¶ 1.c is owed to a company for a $14,000
personal loan Applicant took out in October 2017 to consolidate credit card bills and allow
him to make only one monthly payment. He made payments until he was laid off eight
months  later.  According  to  the  September  2022  CBR,  the  debt  became  delinquent  in
2019, and the last payment was in July 2021. Applicant said he set up an agreement with
the debt collector to make monthly payments of $120 in January 2021, and he has been
making them since; however, there is no proof documenting payments since May 2021.
The September 2022 CBR remains the most recent information on the debt, showing an
outstanding  balance  due  of  $11,133.  (Tr. 33-39,  58;  GE  3  at  8;  AE  I) This  debt  is  not
resolved.
4. The $4,690 credit card debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d was charged off in 2019. It
was settled and paid in February 2021. (Tr. 39; GE 3 at 10; Ex. R) It is resolved.
5.
The  $2,711  collection  account  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.e,  owed  to  a  credit  card
company, was charged off in 2019. It was paid in November 2020. (GE 4 at 10; AE O) It
is resolved.
6.
The $1,383 collection account alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f was owed to a credit card
company and was charged off in 2020. It was paid in October 2022, post-hearing. (Tr. 45;
GE 4 at 10; Ex. Q) It is resolved.
7.
The $675 utility debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g was charged off in 2019. It was paid
in October 2022, post-hearing. (Tr. 47; GE 4 at 11; AE K) It is resolved.
8.
was paid in October 2022, post-hearing.  (Tr. 49; AE N) It is resolved.
The $289 charged-off account alleged in SOR ¶ 1.h was charged off in 2019. It
9.
2019. It was paid in in April 2021. (Tr. 51; GE 4 at 11; AE H) It is resolved.
The $233 collection account alleged in SOR ¶ 1.i, a utility bill, was charged off in
10.
The $204 medical debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.j was placed in collection in 2018. It
was paid in October 2022, post-hearing. (Ex. P) It is resolved.
11.
The $201 internet bill alleged in SOR ¶ 1.k was placed in collection in 2020. (Tr.
52-53)  There  is  insufficient  evidence  to  determine  whether  that  this  debt  has  been
resolved.
Applicant submitted his budget. His net monthly income is $6,700 and includes his
wife’s income. Their expenses total $4,525. They have $2,100 remaining in their budget
at  the  end  of  the  month.  (AE  A)  He  has  not  participated  in  financial  counseling  since
college. (Tr. 54) He said he has paid all of the alleged debts, except the consolidated loan
he obtained in 2019. (Tr. 40)
