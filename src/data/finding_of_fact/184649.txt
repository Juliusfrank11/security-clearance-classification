Applicant denied all the allegations in the SOR, except for SOR allegation ¶ 2.a.
After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the
following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  51-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed  with  the  defense  contractor  since  March  of  2019.  Applicant  is  married,  and
has two adult children. (TR at page 15 line 12 to page 16 line 4, and GX 1 at page 12.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
Applicant  attributes  his  financial  difficulties  to  an  unexpected,  $20,000  special
assessment by his home owner’s association, to be used to replace the damaged roofs
of others in his condominium complex. (TR at page 27 line 13 to page 29 line 14.) As a
result, Applicant was forced to file for the protection of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. (GX 4.)
His  debts  were  discharged  in  September  of  2021.  (GX  4  at  the  last  page.)  Since  this
bankruptcy,  Applicant’s  credit  scores  have  risen  from  the  mid  500s  to  the  high  600s.
(AppX H.) He is also receiving credit counseling, and has a positive montly cash flow of
about $1,500. (AppXs C and G.)
1.a.  Applicant  was  indebted  to  Creditor  A  in  the  amount  of  about  $55,000,
including  penalties  and  interest,  as  a  result  of  the  special  assessment  noted,  above.
The loan for his condo unit also suffered a voluntary foreclosure. This real-estate debt is
included in Applicant’s  Chapter 7 bankruptcy. (TR at page 27 line 12 to page 36 line 18,
at page 43 lines 2~13, at page 46 lines 7~12, and GX 4.)
1.b~1.k. and 1.m. Applicant was indebted to Creditors B~K and M, mostly credit
cards,  in  the  amount  of  about  $27,000.  These  alleged  past-due  debts  are  included  in
Applicant  Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  (TR at page  33  line 3  to page 35 line 12, at page 36
lines 14~22, and GX 4.)
1.l. Applicant disputes a $1,369 jewelry debt to Creditor L, and it does not appear
on the Government’s December 2021 credit report. (TR at page 35 line 13 to page 36
line 13, and GX 4.)
1.n.  Applicant  disputes  a  $258  cable  TV  debt  to  Creditor  N,  and  it  does  not
appear  on   the   Government’s  December  2021   credit   report.   (TR   at  page  36  line  23  to
page 37 line 20, and GX 4.)
1.o. Applicant disputes a $158 debt to Creditor O, and it does not appear on the
Government’s December 2021   credit report.   (TR at page   37   line   21   to   page   38   line   8,
and GX 4.)
Guideline E - Personal Conduct
2.a.  Applicant  is  a  former  police  officer.  He  was  involved  with  a  charity  at  his
Police  Department.  The  charity  was  grossly  understaffed.  He  was  the  treasurer,  and
inadvertently commingled his personal check book  with that of the charity. As a result,
he  was  terminated  from  his  employment,  in  January  2013,  nearly  ten  years  ago.
Persecution was declined, as there was “insufficient  evidence to prove embezzlement.”
(TR  at  page  16  line  5  to  page  27  line  17,  at  page  43  line  14  to  page  44  line  25,  and
AppX F.)
