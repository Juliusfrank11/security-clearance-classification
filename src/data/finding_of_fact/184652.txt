Applicant is 45 years old. She has worked as an engineer for her current employer,
a U.S. Government contractor, since June 2022. She worked for other contractors for a
number of years prior to her current employment. She enlisted in the Army Reserve  in
2006 and was honorably discharged in 2014, with the pay grade of E-4. She deployed
twice to war zones as a contractor. At the same time she also discharged her duties as a
Reservist. She was granted eligibility for a Secret security clearance in 2006 and again in
2011. She is presently applying for eligibility for a Top Secret clearance. She has never
married and has no children. (Tr. at 18-22, 26; GE 1 at 57-58; GE 2 at 25.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations)
The Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she is
financially  overextended  with  delinquent  debts  and  therefore  potentially  unreliable,
untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.
The SOR identifies five debts in collection totaling about $53,000. In her Answer,
Applicant  denied  all  of  the  SOR  allegations  and  provided  additional  explanations
regarding her  understanding of  the  status  of  the  debts.  She  also attached  three  credit
reports, dated October 14, 2021. The existence and amounts of these debts is supported
by the Government’s credit reports in the record dated March 4, 2021; September 3, 2020;
February 23, 2017; and September 20, 2022. (GE 4; GE 5; GE 6; GE 8; AE A through C.)
The background and current status of each of the debts alleged in the SOR are as
follows:
1.a.  Credit-card  debt  placed  for  collection  in  the  approximate  amount  of  $577.
Applicant opened this account in November 2010. She defaulted on the account in about
2015, and the creditor referred the account for collection. Applicant testified that she paid
this debt  in 2015. She  wrote in her October 2021 Answer that she called  the creditor and
was advised  that it had  no  record of  this account.  The  creditor advised  Applicant  to  contact
the  credit bureau  reporting  the  debt and  to  ask that the  debt be  removed  from  its report.
In  2021  she  submitted  a  dispute  to  have  the  debt  removed  because  it  had  been  paid. The
Government’s  most  recent  credit  report  reflects  that  she   opened   a   new   credit-card
account   with   this  creditor   in  July   2018,   and   that  the   new   account  was   current.  The
creditor’s action  of  opening   a  new   account   in Applicant’s name  provides evidence  that
she  paid  the  account  alleged  in SOR 1.a  prior to  2018  and  that the  contrary  credit bureau
report is  erroneous. This former debt  was resolved  many  years ago.  (Tr.  at  28-29,  31-39;
GE 3  at 8; GE 4 at 2; GE 5  at 4; GE 6  at 4.)
1.b.  Government  account  for  overpayment  of  educational  benefits  placed  for
collection in the approximate amount of $81. Applicant testified that she has actually paid
this debt several times in her attempts to have it removed from her credit report.  In her
Answer she provided evidence of an $81 payment on August 17, 2021. She also provided
a record of a February 2021 payment she made of a second debt owed to the Government
in the amount of $1,034. This larger payment was for a debt owed for an overpayment for
housing  that  was  not  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Both  the  debt  at  SOR  1.b  and  the  larger,
unalleged debt to the Government are resolved. (Answer at 3; Tr. at 39-42, 58; GE 3 at
8; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 4; GE 7.)
1.c.  Auto  loan  account  charged  off  in  the  approximate  amount  of  $33,953.
Applicant  opened  this  account  in  October  2016  and  defaulted  on  the  account  after
February  2017.  The  creditor  never  repossessed  the  vehicle.  Applicant  states  that  she
made repeated attempts to contact someone at the creditor’s office who would help her
return the vehicle and resolve this debt, but was unsuccessful. In 2021 Applicant hired a
credit-repair company to address this debt. The creditor responded to the credit-repair
company’s correspondence that the debt was valid. She last spoke with someone at the
creditor’s office later in 2021 and asked for instructions on what to do. The creditor never
called  her  back.  About  a  month  prior  to  the  hearing,  Applicant  had  the  credit-repair
company write the creditor stating that she wanted to work out a payment arrangement
for this debt. The creditor never responded. The creditor had charged off the account and
sold it to a collection agency. Applicant testified that she is prepared and able to pay at
least $1,000 per month to settle this debt and is committed to resolving this debt. After
the hearing, Applicant entered into a repayment plan with the collection agency. Under
the plan, she is obligated to pay $2,000 by December 1, 2022, and $998 per month for
the  following  34  months  by  automatic  payments  from  her  bank  account.  Applicant
provided documentation evidencing her initial payment of $2,000 on November 18, 2022.
This debt is being resolved. (Tr. at 42-52, 59-64; GE 3 at 8; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 4; GE 6 at
4; GE 7; GE 8 at 5; AE A at 4; AE B at 5; AE C at 5; AE D at 5; AE E; AE F; AE G; AE H.)
1.d. Fitness club account placed for collection in the approximate amount of $767.
In 2018 Applicant canceled her new club membership after living for one month in the city
where the club was located. She deployed to a war zone at that time. She paid the early
cancellation  fee  to  the  club.  She  was  unaware  there  were  additional  fees  to  be  paid.
Shortly after her deployment she learned about the additional fees and paid the debt. The
club assigned the debt to a collection agency about the same time. During her background
interview in February 2021, she learned that the debt had not been deleted from her credit
report, dated September 3, 2020. The debt was subsequently deleted. It does not appear
in  the  more  recent  credit  reports in  the  record.  This  former debt  was  resolved  several
years ago. This debt is resolved. (Tr. at 55-60; GE 3 at 8; GE 5 at 4.)
1.e. Auto loan account placed for collection in the approximate amount of $17,368.
Applicant opened this account in 2010. Applicant defaulted on the loan payments in about
2014, and the creditor placed the account for collection. She paid the debt off over five
months, and by December 2014, she had finished paying this debt. The account appears
in  the  Government’s  credit  reports  as  “paid  charge  off”  and  as  “current.”  The  record
contains no credit report that reflects that the account was delinquent. This former debt
was resolved many years ago. (Tr. at 43, 45-46, 52-55; GE 3 at 8; GE 5 at 4; GE 6 at 4.)
Mitigation
Applicant explained that some of her oldest debts were the result of her decision
to help her mother save her house from foreclosure and to assist her mother by making
further mortgage payments. At a later point, Applicant helped her mother again by paying
her medical bills. This caused Applicant to fall behind in paying some of her own debts.
She also explained that in 2018, she made a bad investment that negatively affected her
finances. She subsequently paid some of her debts and was surprised that the paid debts
were  not  removed  from  her  credit  report.  Presently  Applicant  has  $5,000  to  $6,000  in
savings and earns a net monthly income of about $7,000. She does not live beyond her
ability to pay her bills. (Tr. at 25-27, 42-43, 52, 64-65.)
