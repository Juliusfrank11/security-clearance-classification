Applicant admitted the two SOR allegations (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b), and provided
explanations. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough
and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the  following
additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  42  years old.  He  and  his first  wife married  in  2006  and  divorced  in
April  2018.  He  and  his  first  wife  have  a  daughter,  age  14.  He  also  has  a  20-year-old
daughter  from  a  prior  relationship.  He  remarried  in  2020,  and  he  and  his  wife  have  a
young  daughter.  (GE  1;  Tr.  37,  49-51)  Applicant  held  a  clearance  about  15-20  years
ago  when  he  was  in  the  Army  Reserve  (2000-2006).  He  was  never  activated  for  a
deployment, and he was discharged honorably. (Tr. 10, 68-70; GE 1)
Applicant has an associate’s degree. He has worked as a federal contractor, for
different  employers,  with  limited  interruption  since  mid-2009.  He  was  terminated  from
one position in August 2018 for alleged poor performance. After about seven months of
unemployment, he was hired by his current employer, another contractor for the same
government  agency,  in  March  2019.  (GE  1)  He  earned  a  recent  promotion  and  now
earns an annual salary of $110,000. (Tr. 65-69; GE 1; AE K)
The  SOR  concerns  several  years  of  late-filed  state  and  federal  income  tax
returns,  and  a  single  charged-off  debt.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b)  Applicant  admitted  both
allegations in his SOR response, with explanations.
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges,  and  Applicant  admits,  that  he  failed  to  timely  file  his  state
and federal income tax returns on time, as required, for “at least” tax years 2015-2019.
Applicant disclosed on his June 2019 SCA that he had two years of unfiled tax returns
(2017 and 2018). He said he could not afford to pay his 2017 taxes and noted his recent
unemployment.  (GE  1)  He  discussed  his  tax-filing  issues  and  the  debt  at  SOR  ¶  1.b,
during his August 2019 background interview. (GE 2 at 5-6)
Applicant testified  that he  had  a  difficult relationship with  his first wife. During  the
tax  periods  at  issue  in this case,  they  were married  but  had been  living  separately,  since
about 2014.  Applicant  said he prepared  his returns  each  year but  acknowledged  that  his
rationale  for  not  filing   his  tax   returns  was   to   “protect  myself   as  much   as  I  could
financially” because  he did not want his  wife  to  get his refunds. He acknowledged during
his  testimony   that  this   was  not  a   good   decision.  He  also  acknowledged   that   once   his
tax-filing  issues began, it was difficult to  dig  himself  out.  (Tr. 39-49, 55-57; GE  3  at 22-
23)
During his hearing, Applicant was initially reluctant to discuss the circumstances
of  the  end  of  his  first  marriage  in  much  detail.  (Tr.  40)  After  the  hearing,  in  late
November  2022,  he  provided  additional  details  in  an  e-mail.  (AE  R)  Essentially,  he
stated  that  there  came  a  point  in  time  when  he  and  his  first  wife  had  a  significant
disagreement about his efforts to resolve a custody dispute with the mother of his eldest
daughter, in about 2011. Though the parties participated in family counseling and found
it  helpful,  the  dispute  also  led  to  the  end  of  their  marriage.  Applicant  was  reluctant  to
discuss the matter more fully in the hearing because it is painful and embarrassing. (AE
R; AE U) As of September 2022, Applicant no longer has child-support obligations as to
his eldest daughter. (AE J) He pays child support for his middle child. (Tr. 51)
Applicant filed his federal tax returns for tax years 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 at
the  same  time,  in  February  2021.  For  each  year,  he  received  a  tax  credit  of  several
hundred  dollars.  (AE  B)  He  acknowledged  that  he  was  prompted  to  address  his  tax
returns by the DOHA interrogatory he received in January 2021. (Tr. 60)  He filed most
of  his  remaining  unfiled  federal  returns  in  December  2021.  This  included  the  federal
returns  for  2017  ($1,165  credit),  2018  ($1,650  refund),  and  2020  ($1,912  credit).  He
filed his 2019 federal return in February 2022, and received a $3,273 refund. (AE B)
Similarly,  Applicant  provided  documentation  from  state  A  about  his  2015  and
2016 state taxes, including small state tax assessments (of $67 total) that he resolved in
2021.  (AE  P.  AE  Q).  He  filed  those  returns  in  December  2020.  (GE  3  at  15)  He  also
documented  that  his  state  2  income  tax  returns  for  2017,  2018,  and  2019  were  also
filed,  concurrently  with  his  federal  returns  for  those  years.  (Tr.  48)  He  was  to  receive
refunds  of  between  $100  and  $260  for  each  tax  year.  (AE  C,  AE  D,  AE  E)  His  2020
return  reflects  that  he  owed  about  $500  (AE  G),  but  he  testified  that  he  received  a
refund of less than $100. (Tr. 58) He has no other unfiled tax returns from prior years,
and no outstanding state or federal tax debt. (Tr. 55, 58)
Applicant  has  also   filed   his  state   and   federal  income   tax   returns   for  2021.  He
received  a  federal refund  of  $3,688  and  a  state  B  tax  refund  of $2,459. (AE  B, AE  F,  AE
H)   He  apologized   for  his  actions   and   now   has  a   better  understanding   of  his
responsibility  as a  citizen  to  file  his tax  returns on  time, and   he intends to  do  so  in the
future. (Tr. 49,  63-65, 73-74)
SOR ¶  1.b  ($32,532) is an  account that  was charged  off  by  a  credit union. (GE
XX) Applicant admitted  the  debt,  and  it is listed   as charged  off  on  credit reports  in the
record.  (GE   3,  GE   4,   GE   5).  The   debt  is   a   repossessed   vehicle   purchased   during
Applicant’s first marriage. The  April 2018  Final Order of  Divorce notes, in  part, that  his
wife   (“Plaintiff”)   “shall   be   solely   responsible for all   expenses  related   to   the   vehicle   and
shall hold Defendant (Applicant) harmless thereon.” (AE M, AE  V; Tr. 26, 30-33)
The vehicle was sold at auction in November 2018 for about $10,286, leaving an
outstanding  debt  of  $22,062.  (AE  O)  Even  though  Applicant’s  former  wife  was
responsible  for  the  vehicle  and  the  debt  following  their  divorce,  he  said  she  had  not
done so. Although the debt is her responsibility as noted in the divorce decree, he has
set  up  a  payment  plan  to  address  the  debt.  He  provided  documentation  at  his  2019
background interview (GE 6) and updated it at his hearing. (AE A, AE M, AE N, AE O)
Applicant  has  been  making  $100  monthly  payments  towards  the  account  since  late
2019, and the balance owed as of late September 2022 is down to $18,366. (AE N) He
expects to continue making payments on the account. (Tr. 30-36)
Applicant and his wife also recently sold their prior residence, a condominium, for
$265,000,  which  was  $16,000  over  the  asking  price. While  settlement  was  pending  at
the  time  of  the  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  he  expected  to  use  the  proceeds  from
the sale to address the debt at SOR ¶ 1.b. (AE L; Tr. 36-39) Applicant documented that
SOR  ¶  1.b  is  not  his  responsibility,  but  he  is  nonetheless  addressing  the  debt
responsibly  and  has  a  reasonable  plan  for  its  resolution.  Applicant  has  no  other
delinquencies alleged. (GE 3; AE I)
Applicant  attested  to  his  pride  and  dedication  to  serving  his  country  in  uniform
and his desire to continue to do so in his current role. He has worked hard to get where
he  is.  He  approaches  his  professional  role  and  his  role  as  a  husband  and  father  with
utmost integrity. (Tr. 53-54, 73-74; AE U)
Two  work-related  references  attested  in  reference  letters  that  Applicant  is  a
dedicated and hard-working  professional. He  maintains a  “cool head” under stress. He
has  respect  for  protection  of  sensitive  and  classified  information.  He  is  honest  and
trustworthy. He is also a veteran who wants to continue serving his country. There is no
reason to question his character or judgment and they recommend him for a clearance.
