worked since August 2020. He has been steadily employed since 2006. He has a high

In  the  SOR,  the  Government  alleged  Applicant’s  six  delinquent  debts  totaling
approximately $72,000. These delinquencies consisted of two home-improvement loans
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.e), three credit cards (SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d), and a local tax debt
(SOR ¶ 1.f). Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations with additional comment. His
admissions are adopted as findings of fact. (Answer; GE 1-6, 9)
Applicant  attributed  his  financial  issues  to  his  2017  separation  and  resulting
divorce in 2020. He claimed that when he separated from his ex-spouse, he was sending
her money in order to pay for marital debts, including some of the SOR debts. He claimed
that she was taking this money, but not using it to pay for the debts. He claimed that he
was responsible for the SOR debts through the divorce. He did not provide documentary
evidence of a separation agreement or a divorce decree to corroborate the assignment
of marital debts. He earns about $90,000 annually. He earns $32 per hour, and $48 per
hour for overtime. He pays between $1,000 and $1,060 per month for his mortgage. He
owns a working farm, but does not derive a regular income from it. He has about $1,000
in his savings account. (Tr. 18, 22-23, 27, 30-31, 34-36, 40; Answer; GE 1, 2)

The $46,920 home-improvement loan alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a has not been resolved.
Applicant opened this account in February 2016 to purchase solar panels for the marital
home. The last payment he made on this account was in about May 2018. He claimed
that he was providing money to his ex-spouse to pay this debt but she was not paying it.
He learned that the debt was not being paid in 2020. About six to eight months prior to
the hearing, he contacted the creditor about making a payment arrangement, but he was
unable to make one. (Tr. 21-25; Answer; GE 2, 4-6, 9)
The  $5,411  credit  card  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.b  is  being  resolved.  He  became
delinquent on this debt because he lost track of it, and he was not sure who would be
responsible for it given his divorce. He claimed that he made a payment arrangement with
the creditor after the SOR was issued and made payments of about $56 per month that
automatically  came  out  of  his  bank  account.  As  of  the  hearing  date,  he  claimed  the
balance on this account was about $4,600. The November 2021 credit report reflects a
payment of $57. (Tr. 25-26; Answer; GE 2, 4-6)
The $3,187 credit card alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c has not been resolved. Applicant used
this  credit  card  to  purchase  airline  tickets.  He  opened  the  account  in  2017  and  it  was
charged off in 2020. He claimed that he was providing money to his ex-spouse to pay this
debt, but she was not paying it. He has not made any payment arrangements or payments
on this debt after it became delinquent. (Tr. 26-28; Answer; GE 2, 5, 6, 9)
The $2,273 credit card alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d is being resolved. Applicant used this
credit card for every day expenses. He opened the account in 2002, and he last made a
payment on it in 2019. He claimed that he was providing money to his ex-spouse to pay
this debt but she was not paying it. He claimed that he made a payment arrangement with
the creditor in 2020 after the creditor contacted him. He claimed he made payments of
about $56 per month since then, but he provided no documentation to corroborate these
payments or the payment arrangement. (Tr. 28-29; Answer; GE 2, 4-6, 9)
The $14,734 home improvement loan alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e has not been resolved.
Applicant borrowed this money in 2016 to put a new roof on the marital residence. The
last payment Applicant made on this account was in about February 2018. He claimed
that he was providing money to his ex-spouse to pay this debt, but she was not paying it.
He  learned  that  the  debt  was  not  being  paid  in  2020.  He  has  not  made  any  payment
arrangements or payments on this debt after it became delinquent. (Tr. 29-31; Answer;
GE 2, 4)
The $83 local tax debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f has been resolved. Applicant claimed
that after the SOR was issued, he went to the tax office and paid this debt in person on
an undisclosed date. He claimed he was not aware he owed this tax until the SOR was
issued. (Tr. 31-32; GE 3)
In  about  2018,  Applicant’s  marital  residence  was  foreclosed  upon  and  sold  at
auction.  Applicant  claimed  that  he  was  providing  funds  for  his  ex-spouse  to  pay  the
mortgage on this home, but she was not doing so. He claimed that he found out about
the delinquency when the account was about five months past due and that he tried to
work with the creditor to avoid foreclosure, but was unable to do so. The sale of the marital
residence satisfied the mortgage. (Tr. 23-24; GE 1, 2, 7)
The IRS entered a $166,000 tax lien against Applicant in 2011 for failure to pay
income taxes. In 2012, he resolved the tax issue and the aforementioned tax lien was
released. Applicant claimed that he is current on all of his tax obligations.  Any adverse
information  not  alleged  in  the  SOR,  such  as  Applicant’s  foreclosure  and  his  tax  lien,
cannot be used for disqualification purposes. It may be considered when assessing the
application of mitigating conditions and for the whole-person analysis. Applicant has not
received  any  financial  counseling  and  he  does  not  follow  a  written  budget.  He
acknowledged at the hearing that he tends to “fly by the seat of my pants” with respect to
his budgeting. (Tr. 32-33; GE 8)
