Applicant,  45,  has  worked  for  a  federal  contracting  company  as  an  operations
supervisor  at  a  shipyard  since  March  2017.  He  completed  a  security  clearance
application, his first, in December 2019. He disclosed derogatory information regarding
a 2010 DUI. The ensuing investigation developed further information about the DUI  as
well  as  some  derogatory  financial  information.  The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  owes
$31,043 on a  delinquent medical  account. The SOR  also  alleges that he filed for, and
received relief from, $332,808 in debt through Chapter 7 bankruptcy in August 2008.
The record contains very little information about the 2008 bankruptcy. Given that
the  bankruptcy  occurred  eleven  years  before  he  completed  the  security  clearance
application,  Applicant  was  not  required  to  disclose  it  and  the  investigator  did  not  ask
about  it  during  Applicant’s  February  2020  background  interview.  The  only  available
information  is from  the  May  2008  bankruptcy  application.  According  to  the  bankruptcy
application, Applicant sought relief from $332,808 in debt. The largest debt, 86% of the
reported debt, was for a $289,310 mortgage opened in December 2006.
Applicant incurred the $31,043 medical debt after an accident in November 2013,
which required him to be airlifted to a hospital. At the time of the accident, Applicant did
not  have  insurance.  According  to  his  background  interview,  Applicant  did  not  learn
about  the  debt  until  2018.  He  began  making  $100  monthly  payments.  He  claimed  he
stopped  making  payments  when  the  interest  and  penalties  on  the  debt  exceeded  the
$100 payment. He tried to negotiate a settlement with the company to no avail.
Aside  from  the  alleged  medical  debt,  Applicant’s  January  2020  credit  report
shows  a  favorable  credit  history.  Applicant  obtained  a  mortgage  loan  in  2012  and  the
account is in good standing. He has no other consumer credit accounts in his name. He
is the authorized user on three credit cards, which are also in good standing.
