The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  had  four  delinquent  consumer  debts,  totaling
$31,804  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  - 1.d).  In  addition  to  his  admissions  in  his  Answer,  Applicant
disclosed  and  discussed  his  delinquent  debts  on  his  SCA,  during  his  February  2021
background  interview,  and  in  his  October  2021  response  to  interrogatories.  A  January
2021 credit bureau report lists all of the SOR debts, and a March 28, 2022 credit bureau
report lists SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d (GE 1 – 5)
Applicant attributed his delinquent debts to his second divorce and raising a child
with special needs. In 2016, while separated from his second spouse and going through
a  divorce,  he  made  minimal  payments  totaling  $1,200  monthly  toward  his  debts.  He
became responsible for the debts incurred during his second marriage when his spouse
did  not honor their agreement to share  in the  responsibility for the joint debts  incurred
during  their marriage.  He  was  also  ordered  to  pay  alimony  and  child  support.  He  was
falling slowly behind on his debts.
Applicant sought help from a debt consolidation company, who informed him that
it would represent him at a cost of $400 monthly. The debt consolidation company sent
letters  to  his  creditors  and  requested  that  all  correspondence  related  to  his  debts  be
directed to  the  company.  He  did not  learn, until  approximately one  year later when  he
noticed  his credit score  dropping drastically,  that  his debts needed  to be delinquent  in
order  for  the  debt  consolidation  company  to  negotiate  and  settle  his  debts.  He  also
learned at that point that the money he had paid to the debt consolidation company was
held  in  an  escrow  account  until  the  company  reached  a  settlement  with  his  creditors.
The debt consolidation company settled only SOR ¶ 1.d. He terminated his contract with
the  company  in  January  2018,  and  he  began  working  to  resolve  his  remaining  debts.
(GE 1 – 4)
Applicant  stated  in  his  SCA  and  response  to  interrogatories  that  he  worked  out
payment plans  with  his creditors, but  he  did not  provide  documentation  to  corroborate
his claim. He stated in his Answer that he contacted the credit bureaus and explained
what  happened  when  he  worked  with  the  debt  consolidation  company.  He  stated  that
the credit bureaus told him that “these accounts will be removed from  [his] credit report
in the very near future,” and stated that they were all accounts that were “very old” and
from 2014. (GE 1 – 4)

Answer that this debt was still reported on his credit report. (GE 1, 4)
SOR  ¶  1.b  is  for  a  $10,919  charged-off  personal  loan.  Applicant  obtained  this
loan to purchase home goods and pay for living expenses after his divorce. He stated in
his Answer that this debt was removed from his credit report.  (GE 1, 4)

card for living expenses.  He stated in his Answer that this debt was removed from his
credit report. (GE 1, 4)
SOR ¶ 1.d is for a $4,546 charged-off credit card. Applicant obtained this card for
daily  living  expenses.  As  previously  discussed,  he  stated  that  the  debt  consolidation
company settled this debt. Documentation reflects that the creditor offered to settle this
debt  for  $4,000  in  April  2017  if  Applicant  made  payments  according  to  a  payment
schedule  from  April  2017  to  September  2018.  He  did  not  provide  documentation  to
show that he abided by the creditor’s proposed payment schedule and settled this debt.
He stated in his in his Answer that this debt was removed from his credit report. (GE 1,
3, 4)
