In  his  Answer,  Applicant  admitted  SOR  allegations  ¶¶  1.a-1.g,  and  denied
allegations ¶¶ 1.h-1.j. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a
thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  evidence  submitted,  I  make  the
following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  41  years  old.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2004.  His  last
application for a security clearance was granted in 2009. He was married in 2003 and has
four  children, three of which  are minors. He has  worked for a federal contractor as an
emergency services dispatcher since 2014. (Item 3)
Applicant did not include a narrative with his SOR answer, and he did not provide
a response to the FORM. The only discussion of his debts in the record is in his  2019
background interview with a government investigator. He stated that his current financial
situation  could  be  better  and  that  it  was  a  work  in  progress.  He  asserted  that  he  was
willing and able to repay his debts. He reported that he followed a budget, but he had not
had credit counseling. He claimed that he was making an effort to communicate with his
creditors to resolve his financial delinquencies. (Item 7).
The SOR alleges ten delinquent debts totaling $80,631. Seven of these debts are
student loans totaling $79,171. The status of the debts are as follows:
SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.g are student loans in collection, totaling $79,171. The October 2020
credit report shows that two loans originated in 2006, three in 2010, and two in 2012. The
credit report also shows that these loans first became delinquent in 2104, and the date of
last  payment  for  these  loans  was  in  March  2020.  In  his  2019  SCA  and  background
interview,  he  reported  that  his student  loans  were  in  default.  He  stated  that  they  were
delinquent because of unexpected medical expenses, but he did not provide any further
information. He claimed that he previously arranged to rehabilitate the loans by making
$411  monthly payments.  He  claimed  that  he  made  nine  payments,  but  failed  to  follow
through to make the accounts current. In his interrogatory response, he provided a letter
from December 2020 showing correspondence with a collection agency to rehabilitate his
student loans. An unsigned agreement attached to the letter required that he make nine
payments  of  $882  to  rehabilitate  the  loans.  However,  Applicant  failed  to  provide  any
documentation  showing  that  he  ratified  the  agreement  or  made  any  payments  to  the
collection agency. (Item 3, 4, 5, 7,)
SOR  ¶  1.h  is  a  past-due  auto  loan  for  $1,207.  The  credit  report  shows  that
Applicant opened this loan in 2012, and the date of last activity on the loan was in August
2019. Applicant stated that he fell behind on his loan payment for one month, and was
unable to catch up. This debt is unresolved. (Item 5, 7)
SOR ¶ 1.i is a medical debt in collection for $66. The credit report shows that the
debt  has  been  delinquent  since  2019.  Applicant  denied  this  debt.  In  his  background
interview, he indicated that he was unaware of this debt, but would make every effort to
resolve it. He did not provide any documentation of his efforts to resolve this debt, and
this debt remains unpaid. (Item 5, 7)
SOR  ¶  1.j  is  a  2018  judgment  for  $187,  which  resulted  from  a  fine  for  a  traffic
infraction in 2018. Applicant resolved this debt in November 2020. (Item 6)
Applicant  did  not  provide  any  documentation  concerning  his  current  financial
situation,  such  as  his  monthly  income  and  expenses,  and  his  assets.  He  provided  no
evidence that he has received credit counseling.
