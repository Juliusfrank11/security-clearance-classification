Applicant  is  a  57-year-old  department  specialist  employed  by  a  defense
contractor  since  May  2008.  She  seeks  to  renew  her  Secret  security  clearance.
Maintaining a clearance is a requirement of her continued employment. (Tr. 13-14)
Applicant  received  her  high  school  diploma  in  June  1983.  She  later  received  a
certificate for completing training as a dental assistant in 1984. (Tr. 15-16) She married
in August 1986, and has three adult daughters. Applicant’s husband  is on disability and
unable  to  work.  Her  oldest  daughter  is  independent,  her  second  daughter  is  in  drug
rehabilitation, and her third daughter lives at home and studying to become a registered
nurse. Applicant provides complete financial support for her third daughter. (Tr. 16-18)
Financial Considerations
Applicant’s  15  delinquent  SOR  debts  totaling  approximately  $33,832  and  her
2011 Chapter 7 bankruptcy are established by her October 25, 2019 SF-86; her Office
of Personnel Management (OPM) background investigation conducted from January 6,
2020  to  January  20,  2020,  containing  her  January  9,  2020  OPM  Personal  Subject
Interview (PSI); her December 21, 2019, October 5, 2020, July 16, 2021, and January
20, 2022 credit reports; and her November 15, 2021 SOR Answer. (Tr. 10; GE 1 - 6)
Applicant explained that her financial difficulties began in 2016 after her husband
had  a  stroke,  was  unable  to  work,  and  went  on  disability.  He  earned  a  good  income
working in construction up until the time of his stroke. She also is paying for her middle
daughter’s  $440  monthly  car  payments  and  $220  car  insurance  payments.  Applicant
also provides miscellaneous support for this daughter as needed. (Tr. 18-21)
In  2011, Applicant and  her husband  filed  for Chapter 7  bankruptcy  following  the
2007-to-2009   recession   when   construction   came   to   a   standstill   and   her  husband   was
unable  to   work.  Applicant  had   started   her  current  job   in  2008   and   was  not  making
enough  income   to   fill the  income  gaps   created  by   her husband’s lack of work. (Tr.  21-
22)
Summarized, Applicant’s SOR  allegations  are: (1) collection  credit card account
for  $4,104;  (2)  collection   credit   card  account  for  $3,236;  (3)  collection   credit  card
account  for  $3,085;  (4)  collection   credit  card  account  for  $3,012;  (5)  collection   credit
card  account  for  $2,409;  (6)  collection   credit  card  account  for  $2,362;  (7)  collection
credit  card  account   for  $2,357;   (8)  collection   credit  card   account   for   $1,385;   (9)
collection   cell   phone   account  for  $1,143;  (10)  collection   credit  card   account  for  $868;
(11) collection  credit  card account for $627;  (12) collection  credit card account  for $611;
(13)  collection   credit  card  account  for  $5,751;  (14)  collection   credit  card  account  for
$1,739;   and   (15)  collection   cell   phone   account   for   $1,143   (duplicate   of  #9).   As
discussed  Applicant  and  her husband  filed  for Chapter 7  bankruptcy  in 2011.  (SOR ¶¶
1.a  –  1.p) Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  SOR allegations  in her November  15, 2021  SOR
Answer.
Following their 2011 Chapter 7 bankruptcy, Applicant and her husband were able
to  remain  current  on  their  bills  until  her  husband’s  2016  stroke.  It  took  “almost  two
years”  before  the  Social  Security  Administration  (SSA)  approved  her  husband’s
disability  claim.  He  receives  $2,083  in  monthly disability  payments.  Applicant’s  annual
salary is “[a]bout $70,000.” (Tr. 20, 22-23)
Department  Counsel  and  I  reviewed  each  of  Applicant’s  SOR  debts  with  her.
Applicant has not made any effort to contact, pay, or set up a payment plan with any of
her  creditors.  (Tr.  24-44)  Applicant  explained  that  given  her  current  income  and  the
need to continue helping her middle daughter in drug rehabilitation, she simply does not
have  the  money  to  pay  any  of  her  creditors.  Added  to  that,  Applicant’s  father  passed
away in 2013 and her mother moved  in with her shortly after. Applicant has found her
situation so overwhelming that she has not looked into debt consolidation or bankruptcy.
She has not had any financial counseling since her 2011 Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Apart
from her SOR debts, Applicant is current on her living expenses. (Tr. 44-45, 59)
Applicant’s  take-home  pay  is  $1,500  every  two  weeks,  for  a  total  of  $3,000  a
month. With her husband’s $2,083 SSA disability pay, that brings their monthly net total
to $5,083. She and her husband own a single-family four-bedroom home with a monthly
mortgage is $3,585. After paying her mortgage she has a balance of $1,498 to pay all of
her other living expenses such as her husband’s $750 monthly truck payment, utilities,
groceries, gasoline, and helping out her middle daughter. Applicant stated, “That’s why
it  just  felt  overwhelming  to  me.”  Applicant  has  no  money  left  over  at  the  end  of  the
month  and  has  no  savings.  She  has  a  small  401k  that  she  contributes  to  from  her
paycheck. Her husband has no other source of income other than his monthly disability
payments. (Tr. 46-51)
Applicant  stated  that  she  considered  various  options  to  regain  financial  stability
such as liquidating her 401k and consulting a credit counselor. She did not want to go
through bankruptcy again. (Tr. 56)
Character Evidence
Applicant’s  SIL  testified  on  her  behalf.  SIL  works  for  the  same  employer  in  the
same department  as Applicant  and  has  held  a  Secret  Security  Clearance  “close  to  20
(years).” She has known Applicant since she was five years old or “about 50 years.” SIL
described Applicant as a great sister-in-law, a great wife, mother, and grandmother. She
stated that Applicant is always there for her daughters, is a dedicated and hardworking
employee,  and  willing  to  do  anything  she  can  at  work  to  help  her  department.  SIL
described Applicant overall as a “great person.” SIL is familiar with all of the challenges
that  Applicant  has  faced  over  the  past  ten  years  to  include  her  husband’s  stroke,  her
mother  passing,  and  her  middle  daughter’s  drug  addiction.  SIL  stated  that  she  would
discuss options with Applicant to regain financial responsibility. (Tr. 53-57, 62)
Applicant submitted work performance reviews from 2018 to 2021. It is clear from
the  reviews  that  Applicant  is  a  highly  regarded  and  valued  employee.  (AE  A  –  AE  D)
She submitted six work-related reference letters. Her supervisors and co-workers have
a  very high  opinion  of  her and  describe  her  as  hard  working  with  a  strong  work  ethic,
honest,  dependable,  trustworthy,  and  helpful.  All  of  these  individuals  recommend  that
Applicant be allowed to keep her clearance. (AE E – AE J) Her employer also gave her
a  Spotlight  Award  in  September  2021  and  a  Mission  Excellence  Award  in  April  2021.

Conclusion
At the end of Applicant’s hearing, I  discussed keeping the record open to afford
her the  opportunity to submit additional mitigating evidence.  Her SIL  stated  she  would
assist  her  in  evaluating  and  pursuing  her  options.  (Tr.  60-65)  Post-hearing,  Applicant
forwarded an email to me thanking me for keeping the record open. She informed me
that she looked into various options to regain financial responsibility and none of those
options  were  feasible  for  her  at  this  time.  She  concluded  saying  that  she  is  a  very
honest and trustworthy person and would never jeopardize her job that she has worked
very hard to obtain and maintain for the last 14 years. (AE M)
