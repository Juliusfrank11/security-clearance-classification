Applicant is 45 years old and married for the second time with seven children. At
the time of the hearing four children were minors and lived with him and his second wife.
He  has  two  master’s  degrees.  Applicant  is  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  as  a
Software  Engineer  and  is  trying  to  retain  a  security  clearance  in  relation  to  his
employment. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, 17, and 25; Tr. 44-46, 49-52.)

The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  had  seven  past-due  debts,  including  one
automobile repossession, totaling $25,610 (SOR 1.a through 1.g). Applicant admitted the
allegations in the SOR with the exception of SOR 1.b and SOR 1.f, which he denied. The
existence and amounts of these debts is supported by credit reports dated July 20, 2021;
and May 24, 2022. (Government Exhibits 3 and 2.)
Applicant  stated  that  the  delinquent  debts  he  admits  all arose  before  the  2018
time-frame,  except  for  1.a.  He  went  through  several  years  of  underemployment  and
unemployment that lasted from 2011 through 2016. His pay fluctuated during this period.
At  one point  Applicant and  his family lived  in  public housing.  He also  had  serious and
expensive family issues between 2016 and 2018. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 13A,
26; Government Exhibit 2; Tr. 17-20, 42, 46-47, 52-57.)
In   2016,   he   accepted   a   job   with   the   Federal  government  that  required   a   trans-
continental move. While the  pay  was substantially  higher  than  what he  was previously
earning,  it  was  not  sufficient for him   to   pay   his regular debts and  resolve   his past-due
indebtedness.   In   August  2019,   he   obtained   his   current   employment,   which  carried
another   substantial  raise   in  pay.  With   the   increase   in  salary,  he   has  been   working   to
resolve the  debts in the SOR, as described below.  (Government Exhibit 2;  Tr.  16-17, 20-
21.)
The current status of the allegations in the SOR is as follows:
1.a.  Applicant  admitted   having   a   charged-off   automobile   loan   in  the   amount   of
$8,649.  Applicant reached  a  payment  arrangement with  this creditor in April 2021  in order
to  keep  the  car. He  made  continuous and  timely  monthly  payments and  paid this debt off
in  June   2022,  as   shown   by   documentation   from  the   creditor.  Now   that  this  debt  is
resolved,  Applicant  has  additional  funds  to   pay   toward  his  other  debts.  (Government
Exhibit 4 at 7; Applicant Exhibit A; Applicant Exhibit B  at 4-6;  Tr.  22-24, 31, 60-61.)
1.b.  Applicant has consistently  denied  any  knowledge  of  this past-due  debt in  the
amount  of $2,919. He  stated  that a  dispute  was filed  with  the  credit-reporting  agencies.
This debt does not appear in the  most recent credit report in the  record.  (Government
Exhibit 2.) Based  on  the  available  evidence,   I find  that there is insufficient  evidence  to
show  that Applicant actually  owes this debt.  In  addition, I also find  this debt is subject  to
a legitimate dispute. (Government Exhibit 4  at 6-7;  Tr.  24-27, 57-59.)
1.c. Applicant admitted  owing  a  creditor $1,621  for a  charged-off  debt. This debt
also arose  in the  2016  time-frame. He  admitted  that it remains  due  and  owing. For various
reasons,  including  the  fact that the  original creditor is now  out of business and  the  current
creditor will  not accept  payments,  he  has been  unable to  resolve  this debt. He is willing
and  able to  make  payments.  I find  this debt  is unresolved  through  no  fault of Applicant.
(Government Exhibit 4  at 6;  Tr.  28-29.)
1.d. Applicant admitted  owing  a  charged-off  debt in the  amount of  $877. This debt
arose   in   relation   to   a   washer  and   dryer  Applicant  purchased   after  moving   across  the
ith  his family. He wound up  returning  both  appliances due to  quality  issues.  He

has filed  a  dispute  with  the  credit-reporting  agencies,  as shown  by  the  most-recent credit
report in  the  record. I find  that  this debt  is  subject  to  a  legitimate  dispute.  (Government
Exhibit 4 at 5-6; Tr. 29-32, 58.)
1.e. Applicant admitted  that  he  is indebted  to a  credit union for a  charged-off  debt
in the  amount of  $108.  This credit union  is only  found  in one  state, on  the  opposite  side
of  the  country  from  where Applicant now  resides.  Applicant has recently  corresponded
with  this credit union  to  clarify  payment arrangements for  the  debt.  This debt is not yet
resolved.  (Answer; Applicant Exhibit B  at 3, 12-13; Tr. 32-35, 59.)
1.f. Applicant has consistently  denied  any  knowledge  of  this past-due  debt in the
amount  of $2,694. He  stated  that a  dispute  was filed  with  the  credit-reporting  agencies.
This debt does  not appear in  the  most  recent credit  report in the  record. Based  on  the
available evidence,  I find  this debt is subject  to  a  legitimate  dispute.  (Government  Exhibit
4 at 8; Tr. 25-36, 61.)
1.g. Applicant admitted  owing  $8,747  for a  vehicle  that was repossessed  during
the  period  he  was unemployed  or underemployed. This debt was subject  to  a  dispute  that
was  resolved,  as  reported   by   the   automobile   finance   company   in  2021.   (Government
Exhibit 3  at 4;  Government Exhibit 4 at 7; Tr. 36.)  This debt does not appear on  the  most
recent credit report in the  record. (Government Exhibit 2;  Tr.  36-39, 64-65.) I find  that this
debt was the subject  of a legitimate dispute.
Applicant stated that his current financial situation is stable, though tight. He is able
to pay his current debts. The credit reports in the record confirm that fact.  Now that he
has paid off the debt in SOR allegation 1.a in full, he has additional funds to use toward
other indebtedness. Applicant also pointed to the fact that the period of delinquency was
several  years  in  the  past,  and  he  has  had  no  past-due  debts  since  that  time.  This  is
important since Applicant has been working to support his large family on one income.
(Government Exhibits 3, 4, 5, and 6; Applicant Exhibit A; Tr. 39-44.)
Applicant  indicated  that  current  structural  issues  with  his  home  might  also  be
affecting  his  finances.  He  submitted  photographic  evidence  to  support  his  statements.
(Applicant Exhibit C.)
Mitigation
Applicant submitted  several letters of  recommendation  from  four current or past
co-workers and  friends. They  all  describe  him  as an  able, intelligent,  honest and  forthright
person.  The  writers confirm  the  existence  of  the  family  issues Applicant  discussed  in his
documentary  evidence  and  testimony. They  describe  him  as a  “reliable and  dependable
person” with  outstanding  character. All  of the  writers, who  also hold  security  clearances,
recommend  Applicant  for a  position  of trust  without  reservation.  (Applicant Exhibit B  at  7-
11.)
