Applicant is a 53-year-old lifecycle management engineer, employed by a defense
contractor since 2001. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2005 and a master’s degree in
2006. He married in 2010 and has three children. He has held clearance eligibility since
at least 2001.
The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant is delinquent on Federal taxes
and  other  debts  totaling  about  $45,315.  His  debts  include  Federal  taxes  owed  for  tax
years 2018 and 2019 totaling over $25,000. The remaining 15 alleged debts are charged-
off  and collection  accounts.  Applicant admitted  all of  the allegations  with  explanations,
except a $64 insurance company collection account, which he denied as his debt but said
he  will  nonetheless  pay  it  by  December  2024.  His  admissions  and  the  Government’s
documentary evidence are sufficient to support the SOR allegations.
Applicant  explained  that  in  January  2018,  his  spouse  started  a  job  that  ended
within six weeks, resulting in a loss of 35% of  their household income. In addition, the
following circumstances caused a financial strain on Applicant and his family: caring for
their pregnant daughter-in-law and child in May 2019, while their son was in military basic
training; his spouse’s surgery; and full-time care for their infirmed parents. As a result, his
wife lost 15 months of income that would have  contributed  to  the family’s  finances. He
stated  that  his  spouse  started  a  new  job  in  August  2020,  and  they  have  paid  about
$37,724 in non-SOR debts directly or through garnishments, and have about $43,279 in
debts left. He said that about 25% of his debts are being resolved through garnishments
that began in January 2021. Applicant expects most of the SOR debts to be resolved by
2023 or 2024. (Ans.)
Applicant  provided  documentary  evidence  to  show  that  he  is  in  a  repayment
arrangement  with  the  IRS  for  his  delinquent  Federal  taxes  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b).  He
submitted  a  page  from  an  undated  IRS  online  payment  agreement  that  shows  he  is
scheduled to pay $750 per month on an installment plan; however, he did not show the
terms  of  the  agreement,  when  payments  would  begin,  or whether any payments  have
been  made  to  date.  He  also  provided  evidence  that  he  has  resolved  SOR  ¶  1.c,  an
appliance  company  account,  via  garnishment,  totaling  $5,763.  No  other  documentary
evidence was provided of his efforts to investigate, pay, dispute, or otherwise resolve the
remaining SOR debts, or of his current financial status. I am not aware of any financial
counseling  or budgeting  assistance  he  may  have  received, or evidence  of  substantiated
disputes of any of  debts.
