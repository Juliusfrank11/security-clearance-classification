Applicant  is  60  years  old  and  married  with  three  children.  He  has  a  Master’s
degree.  Applicant  is  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  as  a  Program  Manager  and  is
seeking to retain a security clearance in relation to his employment. (Government Exhibit
1 at Sections 12, 13A, 17, and 25.)

The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  had  five  past-due  student  loan  debts  totaling
approximately $227,311 (SOR 1.a through 1.e). Applicant admitted all the allegations in
the SOR with explanations. Support for the existence and amounts of these debts is found
in credit reports dated November 25, 2019; and May 23, 2022. (Government Exhibits 3
and 4.)
Applicant stated that he took these loans out to provide a college education to his
oldest  child.  She  graduated  in  2016.  Repayment  of  the  student  loans  was  to  begin  in
2017. That  did  not  happen.  He  stated that  in  2018  he  began to  get  default notices on
these loans. He believed they were in error due to his daughter being on a mission for
her church and ignored them. Applicant did not begin to make payments until 2018. He
made one payment of $600 in 2018 and 4 payments of $600 in 2019. The last payment
in 2019 appears to have been in May. (Applicant Exhibit B at 1, MG-8 through MG-14; Tr.
17, 19-20, 25, 31-35.)
When asked why he did not make more payments in a timely fashion before the
summer of 2019, Applicant stated, “I don’t have an answer for that. They weren’t paid. If
they weren’t paid, they weren’t paid. But I don’t have a particular reason why they weren’t
paid.” Regarding repayment of the student loan debt in general he said, “There wasn’t a
good reason.” He also testified that he always had the financial ability to make monthly
payments of $600. (Tr. 35, 55, 57.)
Applicant  stated  he did  not make payments in  2020 or 2021 due to  the  student
loan  payment  deferments  enacted  because  of  the  Covid  pandemic.  Applicant  has  not
spoken to anyone at the Department of Education (DoE) about his loans since 2021. He
admitted his contact with DoE has been sporadic. He submitted emails from the DoE that
do discuss suspension of loan payments in 2020 through 2022. (Applicant Exhibit B at
MG-5 and MG-7; Applicant Exhibit C at MG-6; Tr. 35-38, 49-52.)
Applicant  discussed  the  fact  that  he  had  prepared  and  submitted  a  “Loan
Rehabilitation  and  Expense  Information”  form  to  DoE  in  2019.  After  the  hearing,  he
submitted a copy of that document. He stated that the form was submitted, but he had no
documentation to support a statement that the DoE had accepted the form or arranged
for a payment agreement. (Applicant Exhibit C at MG-4; Tr. 37.)
Applicant stated that he had begun making regular payments on this loan in 2022
for the months of January through May. After the hearing he provided documentation from
his bank showing that five checks of $600 each were cashed by the DoE in May 2022. It
is noted that the checks have sequential serial numbers, were received for processing
the same day, and all cleared his bank on May 31, 2022, the same day as the hearing.
He submitted evidence showing that he had made one additional payment. He stated that
he will continue to make monthly payments of  $600  on these loans into the future.  He
admitted that payments on this loan in the past were “sporadic.” (Applicant Exhibit B at
MG-1, MG-2; Tr. 19, 31-33.)
Applicant testified that he had another student loan go into default and eventually
a judgment was entered against him and his paycheck was garnished. However, he was
very vague on the particulars of the garnishment until he submitted documentation after
the hearing. (Government Exhibit 2 at 4, 7-8; Applicant Exhibit B at SC-4 through SC-6;
Tr. 17-18, 26-31.)
Applicant  also  admitted  that  he  has  gone  “a  couple  years”  without  filing  his  tax
returns  several  times  in  the  past.  An  investigator  from  the  Office  of  Personnel
Management interviewed applicant in January 2019. Applicant stated in the interview that
he had not filed his 2016 or 2017 tax returns in a timely fashion. (Government Exhibit 2
at 3; Tr. 54-55.)
Applicant testified that he had paid out of pocket for the education of his second
child, who has since graduated. He is currently paying for his youngest child and wife to
attend  community  college.  He  submitted  voluminous  documentation  after  the  hearing
showing  his  out-of-pocket  costs  for  their  education.  (Answer;  Applicant  Exhibit  A;
Applicant Exhibit B at SC-1 through SC-8; Applicant Exhibit B at LPC-1 through LPC-3;
Tr. 17-20.)
