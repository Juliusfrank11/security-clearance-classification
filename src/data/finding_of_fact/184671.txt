In his Answer, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.d, 1.e, and 1.h. He
denied the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.i through 1.t.
Applicant is 50 years old. He is a high school graduate. He has been married to
his second wife since 2009. They have a daughter. He has a son from his first marriage.
He enlisted in the Air Force in March 1993, and he was honorably discharged in March
1997. While in the Air Force, he held a security clearance and did not have any infractions.
He  then  joined  the  Air  Force  Reserve.  He  said  he  could  not  complete  his  enlistment
contract because of his  civilian job commitments. He was separated from the Reserve
with  an  other  than  honorable  discharge  in  1998.  (GE  2).  He  has  worked  for  defense
contractors since 2017 and his current employer since April 2021. (Tr. 17-22, 50; GE 1)
In May 2017, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA). In it, he
disclosed that he failed to pay Federal and state income taxes for years 2013, 2014, and
2015  because  he did not  have  enough  money.  He  said  he had  requested  the  Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) and his state to withhold his refunds to satisfy the debts. (GE 1 at
36).
In  November  2019,  Applicant  answered  the  Government’s  interrogatories.  He
acknowledged  that  he  had  not  paid  a  charged-off  automobile  loan  for  $9,896,  an
automobile repossession with a balance of $6,741, a $1,624 cell phone debt, and a cable
box debt of $242. (GE 2) None of these debts are resolved, as noted below.
Applicant  testified  that his financial  problems began  in  2015  when  he  moved  to
another  state,  and  then  moved  again  a  year  or  two  later  for  employment.  He  said  he
moved a couple times over the past 13 years, which resulted in additional expenses. (Tr.
54-56) After his divorce from his first wife in 2007, he was required to pay child support,
which at times strained his finances because his second wife was not  always working.
(Tr. 23)
Based  on  credit  bureau  reports  (CBR)  from  June  2017  and  March  2020,
Applicant’s admissions in his SCA, and his financial interrogatories, the SOR alleged 20
financial security concerns, which included eight Federal and state tax issues. (GE 4). His
tax liability for unpaid Federal and state income taxes  totaled $19,564. The 12 alleged
delinquent consumer debts totaled $21,540, and became delinquent between 2011 and
2017. The SOR alleged a total of $41,104 in outstanding debt. (GE 3, 5, 6, and 7)
SOR ¶ 1.a alleged Applicant failed to file his 2013 Federal income tax return. The
date that the return was filed is not in this record, however, there is evidence that he paid
his delinquent 2013 taxes, indicating that the return was filed. (GE 2; AE B at 1)
SOR ¶ 1.b alleged Applicant failed to file his 2014 Federal income tax return. The
return was filed in 2016. (GE 2; AE B at 1; AE E).
SOR ¶ 1.c alleged Applicant failed to timely file state income tax returns for years
2013 and 2014. He filed those returns in 2016. The state filed three liens against Applicant
in 2016, totaling $8,081. All outstanding taxes have been paid. (Tr.26; GE 2; AE B at 3;
AE C)
SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e alleged Applicant was indebted to the IRS for $5,868 for tax
year  2014  and  $5,615  for  tax  year  2015.  He  started  making  payments  on  his  Federal
taxes in 2018. (GE 2) He said he completed payments on his 2013 and 2014 Federal tax
debt, and continues to make payments on his 2015 tax debt. He thinks he still owes the
IRS  about  $5,200.  His tax refunds  have  been  withheld  by the  IRS to  reduce  the  debt.
Between 2018 and 2022, he has made 52 payments on three years of unpaid taxes. (Tr.
24-25, 30, 58; AE D) These taxes are being resolved.

in July 2013. He asked the creditor to add the unpaid amount owed to the balance of the
loan, and told them he would catch up when he obtained a position. The creditor refused
to  do  that.  Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  still  owes  this  debt.  (Tr.  38–40)  This  debt
appears on his February and September 2022 CBRs. (GE 6 and 7) It is unresolved.

he   lost   the   car   listed   in  SOR  ¶  1.j.  Applicant   purchased   this   car  at  an   automobile
dealership  through  their  in-house  financing  department.  He  drove  it for six  months and
