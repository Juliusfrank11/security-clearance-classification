In  her  answer  to  the  SOR, Applicant  admitted  the  allegations  contained  in  SOR  ¶¶
1.a  and  1.b.  Her  admissions  are accepted as findings of  fact.
Applicant is 30 years old. She is unmarried and graduated from high school in May
2011.  She  has  been  enrolled  in  college  since  2020  and  she  is  pursuing  a  bachelor’s
degree. (Tr. 33) She has become a firefighter. (Tr. 63)
While  in  high  school,  Applicant  began  working  with  a  military  recruiter.  She
submitted her first security clearance application (SCA) in November 2010. In it, she did
not disclose that she used cocaine and marijuana while in high school. (Tr. 26-29; GE 2)
She did not include  that  information on the advice  or her recruiter.  She  enlisted in  the
Marines when she turned 18 years old in 2011. (Tr. 30-32) She subsequently received a
security clearance.
Applicant testified that she began using marijuana in May 2010 while she was in
high school. The last time she used it was in August 2017, before she took a position with
a defense contractor. She estimated that she has used it 15 to 20 times. She used cocaine
once while in high school (Tr. 28, 68-69)
In September 2011, Applicant entered active duty and went to boot camp. (Tr. 34)
From 2012 to 2014, she was stationed overseas. While there, she was sexually assaulted
twice. (Tr. 38) In 2013, Applicant received an Article 15 or nonjudicial punishment (NJP)
for  wrongful  interference  with  an  adverse  administrative  proceeding.  (Tr.  47)  She  was
reduced from an E-3 to E-2 and was denied reenlistment. She left the Marines in 2015,
and went to the Marine Corps Reserve until 2016. (Tr. 47, 50-52; GE 4)
After returning to the states in 2014, Applicant used Ecstasy (Molly), an illegal drug,
with a friend who gave it to her. She used it twice between 2014 and the time she left the
Marines  in  2015.  She  used  it  to  “numb”  herself  from  past  traumas  (including  sexual
assaults) and her distress over leaving the Marine Corps. She held a security clearance
at the time. (Tr. 49-52, 60, 86-88)
Applicant  was  aware  that  using   marijuana   while  she   was  in  the   Marines  was  a
violation  of  the  Uniform  Code  of  Military  Justice  (UCMJ). She  estimated  she  used  it five
separate  times  during  her service.  She  held  a  security  clearance  at that time. (Tr. 72,  78-
79)  After  leaving   the   Marine   Corps   Reserve   in   2016,   she   used   it  twice  with   a   former
boyfriend  between  July 2017  and  August  2017. She  never purchased  marijuana. (Tr. 81-
82; GE 4)
From August 2017 to July 2020  Applicant worked for a defense contractor. She
deployed to the Middle East to provide assistance to the contractor’s management teams.
(Tr. 53) She continues to work for the contractor on a part-time basis. Currently, she works
fulltime for a non-profit organization that provides mental health services to veterans. (Tr.
22, 64-65)
In  October 2017, Applicant  submitted  her  second  security clearance  application
(SCA-2), after starting the above position with a defense contractor. In it, she disclosed
that she used marijuana from June 2008, while in high school, to August 2017, which was
a month before she started her position with the defense contractor. She disclosed that
she used Ecstasy between 2014 and 2017. (Tr. 67; GE 1 at 35-36) In December 2017,
her security clearance was suspended pending this investigation. (GE 3)
While testifying Applicant disclosed that she smoked marijuana, one time, with a
friend  in  August  2022,  about  two  months  before  the  hearing.  She  was  having  trouble
sleeping and decided to use it. (Tr. 85) She regrets her decision. She knew at that time
she  was  going  to  appear  at  this  hearing.  (Tr.  86,  94)  She  also  believed  that  it  was
important to be honest about her drug use. (Tr. 61)
Applicant  submitted  a  statement  in  which  she  acknowledged  her  past  use  of
marijuana, cocaine, and Ecstasy, and her intention not to use illegal drugs in the future.
If she were granted a security clearance, she agreed to an automatic revocation of it if
she involved herself in future substance abuse. (AE G)
Applicant has not participated in a substance abuse program. (Tr. 90) She has not
sought  treatment  for  her  history  of  childhood  abuse  or  post-traumatic  stress  disorder
(PTSD),  which  a  psychiatrist  recently  diagnosed  during  a  disability  interview.  The
psychiatrist recommended that she participate in therapy and try medication. To date, she
has not followed through with that medical advice. (Tr.  95-97)
Applicant submitted five letters of recommendation. All authors are aware of her
past drug issues and the NJP she received. They attest to her competency, honesty and
dedication to service. (AE A through E.)
