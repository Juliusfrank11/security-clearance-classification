the debt is a vehicle-related bank debt. (Tr. 18, 20) It was financing for his spouse’s 2008

communicated with the creditor and said he would make payments starting in early 2020.
(GE 1 at 51) At his hearing, he said he was making $100 monthly payments; however, he

however, if he receives information from the creditor, he will pay the debt. (Tr. 23, 54-56)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges an insurance-related debt placed for collection for $382. In his
December  2,  2019  SCA,  Applicant  said  he  communicated  with  the  creditor,  and  he
scheduled his payment for December 2019.  (GE 1 at 53) In his SOR response, Applicant
said he was making $32 monthly payments to the creditor; however, at his hearing, he

2022, and  the  debt is resolved. (Tr. 22, 59; AE  I) The  telecommunications creditor in  SOR
¶ 1.e is a subsidiary of  the creditor in  SOR ¶  1.c. (Tr. 24; AE  I)

make  $53  monthly  payments to  the  creditor  for 11  months. (Tr. 64; SOR response) At his
hearing, he  said he  contacted  the  creditor, and  the  creditor  advised  him  that  he  did  not
owe  anything. (Tr. 26, 28)  Department Counsel asked  Applicant, “So  is there any  reason
to  doubt that you  owe  approximately  $584?” Applicant said,  “I wouldn’t doubt it, but I  don’t
want to say yes, I do.” (Tr. 65) The debt does not appear on  his current credit report. (Tr.
26)   Applicant   provided   a   document   from  the   Internet  indicating   the   creditor  did  not
recognize his account number or SSN. (AE Q)
SOR ¶ 1.h alleges an $844 debt placed for collection. Applicant did not remember
having  an  account  with  the  original  creditor;  he  contacted  the  collection  agent;  the

Applicant  received  an  extension  until  October  15,  2021,  to  file  his  TY  2020  tax
return.  (AE  T)  On  May  18,  2019,  and  on  April  26,  2021,  he  established  installment
agreements with the IRS. (AE S) For TY 2018, he made $100 payments on September
3, 2020, and $106 monthly payments on May 16, 2022, and on October 6, 2022. (AE S)
On October 21, 2022, Applicant said he did not file his tax return for TY 2020 because his
tax  preparer said  he  needed  his spouse’s unemployment income  before the  tax  return
could be filed. (AE V) He did not explain what he and his spouse had done to obtain the
needed unemployment information or why he did not file as a single taxpayer. He did not
indicate he consulted with the IRS about whether to file an estimate of the unemployment
income received or why he could not obtain the needed information from deposits to her
bank account.
Applicant did not  disclose  on  his  December 2, 2019  SCA  that his mortgage  and
his homeowner’s association  debts were over 120  days delinquent in  the  previous seven
years; however, he  did disclose  16  other delinquent accounts.  (GE 1  at 40-54) According
to  a  document Applicant provided  after his hearing, from  September 2018  to  May  2019,
Applicant’s mortgage  was 180  days past due. (AE  K  at 18) He said  his mortgage  was
delinquent   about  six   months  during   an   unspecified   period,  and   he   obtained   a   loan
modification.  (Tr. 76,  93) His September 7, 2022  credit report indicates his  mortgage  was
in forbearance  in March 2020  and  January  2022,  and  he  received  a  loan  modification  in
March 2022. (AE  K at 17) He stopped  making his mortgage  payments for an unspecified
period   because   of  unemployment.   (Tr.  93)  Before   the   loan   modification,   he   said   his
monthly mortgage payment was about $2,300. (Tr. 93)
In  March  2022,  Applicant’s  mortgage  balance  was  $357,287;  in  April  2022,  his
mortgage was $395,847; and his monthly payment was $2,516. (AE K at 16) In his loan
modification, unpaid interest was added to the principal of the loan. (Tr. 93) He refinanced
his house around May 2022; the creditor received $399,713; and that mortgage loan was
closed. (AE K at 18) He received about $100,000 cash from the refinance of his mortgage.
(Tr. 83-84, 91) He did not use the proceeds from the refinancing to pay his SOR debts
because some of his other debts were of a higher priority. (Tr. 94) He paid about $954 in
August 2022 on his SOR debts; however, he did not make any other payments on his
SOR debts in 2022 up to the date of his hearing. (Tr. 95)
Applicant’s mortgage is now $584,296, and it is current. (Tr. 79; AE K at 3, 12) His
monthly mortgage payment is $4,018. (AE K at 3) His homeowner’s association monthly
dues were about $115. (Tr. 78) From the magnitude of the increase in his mortgage, he
may have received substantially more than $100,000 in the refinance. In 2016, he was
behind  $6,778  on  his  homeowner’s  association  dues.  (Tr.  77)  His  homeowner’s
association dues are now current. (Tr. 80) In 2022, he said he purchased a vehicle for
about  $50,000,  and  his  monthly  payments  are  about  $850.  (Tr.  82)  His  September  7,
2022  credit  report  shows  he  financed  $56,760;  his  monthly  payment  is  $998;  and  his
status is pays as agreed. (AE K at 39) He said he has about $55,000 in his bank account,
and he has about $50,000 in a retirement account. (Tr. 87-88)
Applicant and his spouse described themselves as a frugal people. (Tr. 33; AE U)
They made efforts to reduce expenses. (AE U) He received financial counseling. (Tr. 89)
He is able to save about $800 monthly. (Tr. 91) He plans to continue to make payments
on the debts in the SOR, and he is current on all of his debts. (Tr. 33-34) His September
7, 2022 credit report does not show any accounts in collections. (AE K at 67)
