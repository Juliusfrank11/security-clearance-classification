In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted each of the SOR allegations. He also
provided  mitigating  information.  His  admissions  are  accepted  as  findings  of  fact.
Additional findings follow.
Applicant  is  a  57-year-old  security  architect,  and  he  has  worked  for  his  current
employer for 26 months. (Tr. 6, 8-9) In 1983, he graduated from high school. (Tr. 6-7) In
1988, he was awarded a bachelor’s degree. (Tr. 7) He has never served in the military.
(Tr. 7) In 1988, he  was  married, and in 2002,  he  was  divorced.  (Tr. 7-8)  He has  eight
children who are ages 10, 11, 14, 18, 20, 22, 26, and 32. (Tr. 8) He does not pay, and he
has not received, child support payments. (Tr. 29)
Financial Considerations
Applicant  attributes  his  financial  problems  to  having  eight  children,  and  three
children are currently attending college. (Tr. 24; SOR response) They have scholarships;
however, he pays the following annual amounts: $14,000; $2,700; and $6,300. (Tr. 30,
56-57) The $14,000 is for his daughter’s law school room and board. (Tr. 56) He wanted
all of his children to complete college without student loans. (Tr. 57)
In 2015, Applicant purchased a car for about $300,000 to $320,000. (Tr. 64) He
eventually sold it for the amount remaining on his vehicle loan of $167,000. (Tr. 64) He
was not thinking about his IRS tax debt for TY 2005 when he was purchasing the vehicle.
(Tr. 64)
Applicant’s annual salary working for his current employer has been $172,000 to
$180,000 per year. (Tr. 26) He was unsure about his income from 2018 to 2020; however,
he believed one year it was under $100,000 and the other year it was not. (Tr. 27, 53)
From 2016 to 2018, his annual salary was $225,000 to $250,000. (Tr. 27) From 2011 to
2016,  his  annual  salary  was  about  $200,000.  (Tr.  28)  He  has  about  $40,000  in  stock
market assets in his retirement account. (Tr. 54-55)
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges Applicant owes  about $54,997 to the federal government for
delinquent taxes for tax year (TY) 2005. Applicant was a 1099 employee, and he failed to
pay quarterly taxes. (Tr. 31, 60-61) He had custody of his three youngest children since
2013. Their mother claimed them on her tax return. (Tr. 24) He was able to convince the
IRS that he should be the parent authorized to take the dependent deduction for the three
children.  (Tr.  24,  31)  He  received  a  letter  from  the  IRS  in  2015  or  2016.  (Tr.  61)  He
presented a April 23, 2018 IRS letter to the Office of Personnel Management investigator
indicating he owed $54,997 to the IRS for TY 2005. (GE 5 at 10) His federal income tax
overpayments for TYs 2016 and 2017 were  applied to address his TY 2005 debt. (Id.)
Year-after-year he ignored his federal income tax debt. (Tr. 62)
Applicant contacted the IRS in 2020 about his tax debt because he was seeking a
security clearance from another government agency (AGA); in 2020, he made an offer in
compromise; and in 2020, he paid his federal income tax debt. (Tr. 24, 32-33, 61-62) He
did not receive his AGA employment because he did not timely complete their security
clearance application. (Tr. 66) He did not remember how much he paid the IRS; however,
he estimated it was about $13,000. (Tr. 32, 63) Department Counsel asked him to provide
evidence of his payments; however, he did not provide it. (Tr. 33) He sent an IRS account
record,  which  shows  zero  balances  for  TYs  2018,  2019,  2020,  and  2021,  and  as  of
September 18, 2020, he had a zero balance. (AE A at 1, 10)
SOR  ¶  1.b  alleges  a  charged-off  account  for  a  vehicle  for  $23,713.  Applicant
purchased  a  2016  vehicle  for  his  business,  which  was  repossessed.  (Tr.  34-35)  He
admitted that purchase of the vehicle showed poor judgment. (Tr. 37) He said he sold a
different  vehicle,  and  he  applied  about  $12,000  to  the  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.b.  (Tr.  37)
However, the $12,000 payment may have  been applied to the debt  for a repossessed
vehicle in SOR ¶ 1.c. He has not been discussing settlement with the creditor for the SOR
¶ 1.b debt, and he did not make any other payments to address this debt. (Tr. 38, 40)
SOR  ¶  1.c  alleges  a  charged-off  account  for  $20,726.  In  May  of  2018,  he
purchased a vehicle. (Tr. 38) He stopped making payments in August of 2019, and the
vehicle was repossessed in late 2019. (Tr. 38) His credit report shows the balance for the
debt is now $5,466, and he plans to pay $2,700 to settle the debt by the end of 2022. (Tr.
39-40; AE A at 4)
SOR  ¶  1.d  alleges  a  charged-off  credit  card  debt  for  $14,588.  Applicant’s  son
charged  some  games  on  the  account,  and  Applicant  disputed  the  debt.  (Tr.  41)  The
creditor sought a judgment, and on October 24, 2016, the court dismissed the creditor’s
lawsuit without prejudice. (Tr. 41; SOR response at 2) The debt appears on Applicant’s
September  2021  Equifax  credit  report  with  the  narrative  code  “Charged  Off  Account,
Account Closed By Credit Grantor.” (GE 4 at 8) This debt does not appear on his October
20, 2022 TransUnion current credit report. (Tr. 42; AE A) This debt is mitigated.
SOR ¶ 1.e alleges a charged-off credit card account for $4,985. Applicant said the
credit card company erroneously paid for a rental car for several months after he returned
the vehicle, and he disputed his responsibility to pay the debt. (Tr. 44; SOR response at
3-4) He said the creditor offered to settle the debt for $1,496, and he intended to settle
the  debt  by  the  end  of  2022.  (Tr. 40,  44-45;  AE  C)  On  October 20,  2022,  the  creditor
confirmed a settlement agreement of 12 monthly $125 payments beginning in November
2022. (AE D at 9-10)
SOR  ¶  1.f  alleges  a  charged-off  account  for  $1,138.  Applicant  said  he  did  not
remember the account. (Tr. 45) His credit reports reflect that the account was opened in
October 2012, and his last payment was in March 2016. (Tr. 45) He called the creditor;
however, he was unable to get the information he needed to resolve the debt. (Tr. 46)
Applicant said he was going to dispute the account. (Tr. 45) The debt shows on his credit
report as having a zero balance. (Tr. 46; AE A at 5; SOR response at 1, 5; GE 4 at 4) This
debt is mitigated.
SOR ¶ 1.g alleges an account placed for collection for $435.  Applicant paid this
debt. (Tr. 46) His September 2021 Equifax credit report narrative code states, “Account
Closed At Consumer’s Request, Consumer Disputes After Resolution, Account Paid For
Less Than Full Balance.” (GE 4 at 6) This debt is mitigated.
SOR  ¶  1.h  alleges  a  judgment  entered  in  November  2015  for  about  $2,000.
Applicant’s landlord  obtained  the  judgment for repairs. (Tr. 47-48) He said he paid the
judgment, and he said he would provide proof of payment. (Tr. 48-49) However, he did
not provide proof of payment or satisfaction of this judgment.
SOR ¶ 1.i alleges a judgment for a utility bill entered in November 2016 for about
$448. Applicant said he paid the judgment, and he provide a utility bill for October 2021
indicating he owed a monthly utility bill of $74. (SOR response at 1, 5) He contended the
creditor would not have given him a new account if there was an outstanding judgment
owed to the creditor. (Tr. 50) Applicant said he could obtain proof of payment; however,
he did not provide evidence from the creditor showing payment.  This debt is mitigated
because he has an account in current good standing with the creditor.
SOR ¶ 1.j alleges a judgment entered in July 2017 for about $12,340, which was
obtained  by  a  landlord  because  of  damage  to  a  residence he  was  renting.  (Tr. 50-51)
Applicant  said  he  settled  the  debt  for  $6,000.  He  said  he  paid  the  debt  using  money
orders. (Tr. 51) He did not retain copies of the money orders. (Tr. 67) The landlord is in
Korea. (Tr. 51)
In  2022,  Applicant  enrolled  in  a  credit  counseling  course,  and  he  generated  a
budget. (AE E; AE F; AE G) His monthly remainder or surplus which is available to pay
the SOR debts is $4,451. (AE E at 3)
In  sum,  Applicant  believes  over  the  last  three  years,  he  has  made  substantial
improvements  in  his  finances.  (Tr.  69)  He  has  an  excellent  credit  score.  (Tr.  69)  His
payments over the last three years for routine accounts have been timely. (Tr. 69)
