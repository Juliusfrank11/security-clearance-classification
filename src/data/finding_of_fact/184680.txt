In  Applicant’s  answer to  the SOR,  she admitted  the sole  allegation in  the SOR,

In response to interrogatories from the DOD CAF (the predecessor of DSCA CAF)

using her veteran’s benefits. Her fiancé was the primary borrower on the loan, and she
was a co-borrower.
Applicant and her fiancé were both on active duty in the Navy when they became
engaged in 2010 and Applicant became pregnant. Her fiancé left active duty in October
2010.  Applicant  was  involved  in  a  serious  automobile  accident  with  a  drunk  driver  in

she received a letter from the lender in 2015. (Tr. 22.) She consulted with an attorney
about filing a partition action, but the lawyer advised her that it would cost at least $10,000
and would not resolve the delinquent loan. (Tr. 24.)
