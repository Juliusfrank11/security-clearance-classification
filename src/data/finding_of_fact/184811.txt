In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, she admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.f,
1.i, and 1.u-1.x. She denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.g, 1.h, and 1.j-1.t. Her admissions
are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  47-year-old  administrative  assistant  employed  by  a  defense
contractor since August 2007. She has held a security clearance since November 2017.
She  married  in  April  1999  and  separated  in  June  2013.  Her  husband  initiated  the
separation. (Tr. 16.) Applicant does not know where he works or what he does, and she
avoids contact with him. (Tr. 50.) She has a 20-year-old son who is a college student and
lives with her. (Tr. 15.) She took courses from an on-line university for three months in
2006 and attended a technical university from March 2010 to February 2012, but she has
not received a degree. (GX 1 at 9-10.).
The SOR alleges eight delinquent consumer debts, six delinquent student loans,
and  six  delinquent  medical  bills.  It  also  alleges  that  Applicant  failed  to  timely  file  her
federal and  state  income  tax  returns  for tax  years  2014  through  2016,  that  her  wages
were garnished twice for delinquent student loans and once for a delinquent account with
a military exchange, and that on one occasion she improperly used her employer’s credit
card  for  personal  expenses.  The  delinquent  debts  alleged  in  the  SOR  are  reflected  in
credit  reports  from  January  2007,  June  2020  (two  reports),  March  2021,  and  October
2022. (GX 3-6 and 8.) The evidence concerning the allegations in the SOR is summarized
below.
SOR  ¶  1.a:  debt  placed  for  collection  of  $10,522.  Around  2019,  Applicant
obtained a loan to pay off some of her other debts. She made the payments for about a
year, until she was hospitalized for blood clots. About $2,500 of her medical expenses
were not covered by insurance. (Tr. 27-29.) In response to DCSA interrogatories and the
SOR,  Applicant  admitted  this  debt  but  disputed  the  amount.  In  her  SOR  answer,  she
stated that she attempted to make a payment agreement, but the creditor wanted monthly
payments that she could not afford. (GX 2 at 21.) At the hearing, she testified that she
paid $541 on this debt and began paying $100 per month about two weeks before the
hearing. (Tr. 30.) She did not provide any documentation of these payments or a payment
agreement. The debt is not resolved.
SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.f and 1.i: student loans placed for collection of $3,633; $2,011;
$1,550;  $1,462;  $1,182;  and  $830.  Applicant  testified  that  her  student  loans  originally
totaled about $23,000. In May 2016 and March 2017, her pay was garnished for $222 per
pay period for her delinquent student loans. (GX 9; GX 10 at 4.) As of August 2018, she
owned  $23,780,  and  she  was  paying  $5.00  per  month.  (GX  7;  GX  8.)  On  a  date  not
reflected in the record, she stopped making the monthly $5.00 payments. She testified,
“In my mind I was like I’ll owe them until I’m 300 years old at $5.00 per month, which is
why I let the garnishment just go ahead.” (Tr. 22.) She believes that $19,080 was collected
by garnishment, and that she now owes about $12,900. (Tr. 19.) The garnishment has
been paused due to COVID-19. (Tr. 23.)
SOR  ¶  1.g:  credit-card  debt  placed  for  collection  of  $944.  In  Applicant’s
response  to  DCSA  interrogatories,  Applicant  stated  that  she  had  arranged  to  pay  $30
every two weeks, beginning in March 2021, until the debt was paid in full. (GX 2 at 23.)
At  the  hearing,  she  testified  that  the  debt  was  paid  in  full.  (Tr.  33.)  She  submitted
documentation  of  payments  to  this  creditor  in  March,  April,  and  May  of  2021,  but  the
account number and amount do not match the debt alleged in the SOR and reflected in
the credit reports in the record. The October 2022 credit report reflects that the balance
on this debt has been reduced to $584 and the last payment was in August 2021. (GX 11
at 2.) The debt is not resolved.
SOR  ¶¶  1.h,  1.j,  1.k, 1.o,  1.r,  and 1.s:  medical  bills  placed for  collection  of
$903, $717, $623, $378, $25, and $171. In response to DCSA interrogatories, Applicant
stated that one of these debts is not  valid  and  the  others are her estranged  husband’s
responsibility  for  their  son’s  medical  bills.  (GX  2  at  24;  Tr.  36-40.)  She  provided  no
documentation to support her testimony.
SOR ¶¶ 1.l, 1.m, 1.p, and 1.q: consumer debts placed for collection of $489,
$463, $345, and $314. Applicant testified that she made payment agreements for these
four debts and they had been paid in full. She provided documentation for settlement of
the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.l, 1.m, and 1.p, but her documentation for the debt alleged
in SOR ¶ 1.q has a different account number than the debt alleged in the SOR. The debts
alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.l, 1.m and 1.p are resolved but the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.q is not
resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.n: telecommunication debt placed for collection of $409. Applicant
testified that she disputed this debt because it was for something that she did not order.
She had not received a response to her dispute, and she had not followed up as of the
date of the hearing. (Tr. 43-44.) She provided no documentary evidence of the basis for
her dispute or efforts to resolve it.
SOR ¶ 1.t: failure to file federal and state income tax returns for tax  years
2014 through 2016. Applicant testified that her returns were filed late because she and
her husband separated in 2013 and she “couldn’t catch up with him to file joint returns.”
In  response  to  DCSA  interrogatories  in  March  2021,  she  stated  that  she  had  filed  her
federal and state income tax returns for 2014 and the returns for 2015 and 2017 were
“completed.” (GX 2 at 20.) In her answer to the SOR, she provided evidence that the 2014
and 2015 federal tax returns were filed and the taxes due were paid. She submitted wage
and income transcripts for 2014 and 2016, but they do not reflect that the federal return
for 2016 was filed. She provided no evidence that any of the past-due state tax returns
had been filed.
SOR  ¶¶  1.u  and  1.v:  wage  garnishment  for  delinquent  student  loans.  This
garnishment is for the delinquent student loans alleged in SOR ¶¶.1.b-1.f, and 1.i. In 2017,
$252 per two-week pay period was collected. The collection per pay period was $255 in
2018  and  $265  in  2019.  (AX  A,  B,  and  C.)  In  Applicant’s  response  to  DCSA
interrogatories, she stated that about $20,540  was  collected by garnishment. (GX 2 at
14.) The collection by garnishment was paused due to COVID-19.
SOR ¶  1.w: improper  use  of  employer’s  credit card  in June 2017. Applicant
admitted using a company travel card to buy gasoline on one occasion. She testified at
the  hearing  that  she  was  out  of  gas  and  did  not  have  the  money  pay  for  it.  She  self-
reported it and paid the bill as soon as it was due. (Tr. 48.)
SOR ¶ 1.x: wage garnishment for delinquent balance of $14,513 on a military
exchange credit card that was placed for collection. Applicant testified that she and
her husband obtained this credit card while he was on active duty. She was unaware of
the debt until she was notified of the garnishment. (GX 9; Tr. 49.) She believes that the
collection agency targeted her for collection because they could not find her husband. (Tr.
50.) She submitted documentary evidence reflecting a payment of $682 and a balance
due of $2,445 as of October 7, 2022. (AX D.) She anticipates that the debt will be paid in
full in about four months. (Tr. 51.)
Applicant submitted a personal financial statement when she responded to DCSA
interrogatories.  It  reflected  net  monthly  income  of  about  $3,928,  monthly  expenses  of
about $2,350, and debt payments of about $395. She has a monthly car payment of $350
and  a  credit  card  with  a  balance  of  $1,500,  on  which  she  pays  $50  per  month.  Her
estranged husband owns the home that she rents for $400 per month.  (GX 2 at 17.) If
these numbers are accurate, she has a net monthly remainder of about $1,183.
A  coworker, who  has known  Applicant since  2007  and  is familiar with  her family
situation, has observed her as she continues to “roll with the punches of life.” He considers
her loyal, dedicated, and trustworthy. (AX E.)
