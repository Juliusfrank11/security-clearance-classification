In  his  SOR  answer,  Applicant  admitted  all
the  allegations,  with  some
explanations.  His  admissions  are  adopted  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  review  of  the
pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  He began  working
at  his present  job  in  2017.  He  is  an  aircraft  maintainer.  He  has  served  in  the  U.S.  Air
Force  and  the  Air  Force  Reserve  for  approximately  20  years,  including  three
deployments, one to Afghanistan. He is retirement eligible this year from the Air Force
Reserve. He holds an associate’s  degree. He was married from 2005 to 2014. He has
two  minor  children from  this marriage  for  whom  he  pays  child  support.  He  married  for
the second time in 2016 to his current wife from whom he is now estranged. She lives in
a  different  state.  He  has  one  child  from  this  marriage  and  there  are  also  two
stepchildren. He provides financial support for his estranged wife and all three children.

The   SOR   alleged   18   delinquent   accounts   (automobile   repossessions,  payday
loans,  and  consumer  debts)  totaling  approximately  $66,212. The  debts are established
by  credit reports from  January  2018, September  2019, January  2021, and  August  2022;
Appellant’s SOR admissions;  and  his  hearing  testimony.  The  debts listed  in SOR ¶  1.g
is  the   same   debt   listed   in   SOR   ¶   1.m.   I  find   for Applicant   on   the   debt   listed   in   SOR   ¶
1.m.  (SOR ¶¶ 1.a  –  1.r).  (Tr. 21; GE 5-9; SOR answer)
Applicant admitted  all  the  SOR debts during  his testimony.  He also admitted  that
he   has   had   financial   problems  for  about  15   years,  going   back   to   2007.  He   described
himself  as “financially  illiterate” in his younger  years. He claimed  that he  made  efforts  in
the   past  to   contact  his  creditors  to   work  out  payment  arrangements.   He  did  not
document any  finalized  payment plans with  any  of  the  SOR creditors. He admitted  that
he has not made  any payments toward any of the SOR debts. He believed that once the
debts  went  into   collection   status  there  was  nothing   he   could  do   to   address  them.  He
also  claimed   that  he   disputed   some   debts  (SOR  ¶¶   1.g,  1.p-1.r),  but  the   debts  were
confirmed   by   the   credit  bureaus. All   the  SOR debts  remain   unresolved   (Tr.  21-22, 28-
29, 62, 64; GE  4-9)
Applicant’s  gross  monthly  income  is  approximately  $12,000.  He  pays  his
estranged wife approximately $2,000-$3,000 monthly for her living expenses. She also
has access to their (his) bank account. He pays approximately  $1,000 monthly in child
support for his two children from his first marriage. He stated that he is trying to buy a
home and is working with a credit counselor in an effort to get him qualified to make a
home purchase. He claimed he uses a monthly budget. He was given the opportunity to
provide  documentary  evidence  of  his  credit  counseling,  his  budget,  and  anything  else
about  his  current  financial  picture  after  the  hearing,  but  he  failed  to  produce  anything.
