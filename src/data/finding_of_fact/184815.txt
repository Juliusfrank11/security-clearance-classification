In  his  Answer,  Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations  (¶¶  1.a-1.g).  His
admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 45 years old. His last application for a security clearance was granted
in 2020. He was married in 1998 and has two children. One of his children is an adult,
and the other a minor. He served on active duty in the Army from 1997-2019. (Item 4)
Applicant told a government investigator during his September 2018 background
interview that he wanted to have his finances in order prior to retiring from the military in
July  2019.  He  stated  in  his  March  2022  SOR  answer  that  he  was  not  going  to  make
excuses for his past financial decisions, and that he has tried to get back on his feet for
the last two years after exiting the military. He stated that he is embarrassed by his past
poor financial decisions, and that he is finally in a position to repair his wrongs. (Item 5)
Applicant reported that his mother had cancer from about 2016-2019, and that he
and his siblings had been providing her with some financial assistance. He reported that
this impacted his ability to repay debt during this time period. He did not state how often
or how much financial assistance he was contributing to her. (Item 4, 5)
The  SOR  alleges  five  charged-off  debts  totaling  $55,365,  and  two  debts  in
collection, totaling $4,248. The status of the debts follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a is an auto loan that was charged off in 2017 for $26,737. In his 2018
background interview, Applicant stated that he fell behind on this debt because money
became  tight,  then  his  mother  had  cancer.  She  needed  financial  assistance,  and  he
wanted to help her out. In his answer, he stated he had monthly auto-pay on this account
until November 2016. He reported that he fell two months behind and he could not catch-
up with the required payments. The debt is unresolved. (Item 5, 6, 7, 8)
SOR ¶ 1.b is a motorcycle loan that was charged off in 2017 for $14,144. In his
2018  background  interview,  Applicant  stated  that  he  fell  behind  on  this  debt  because
money became tight, then his mother had cancer, needed financial assistance, and he
wanted to help her out. In his answer, he stated that he fell behind on his payments, and
could not catch up. He voluntarily surrendered the motorcycle in 2019. He claims that in
2021, he tried to set up a payment plan to repay this debt, but he did not earn enough to
be able to afford it. The debt is unresolved. (Item 5, 6, 7, 8)
SOR  ¶  1.c  is  a  personal  loan  that  was  charged  off  for  $9,564.  In  his  answer,
Applicant stated  that  because  of his “poorly planned  exit from  the  military,” he  was not
able to make monthly payments, and fell behind. The debt is unresolved. (Item 7)
SOR ¶ 1.d is an auto loan that was charged off in 2015 for $4,460. In his answer,
Applicant  stated  that  in  2016,  this  vehicle  was  totaled  in  an  accident.  His  insurance
company did not cover the full amount of the loss, and this debt is the remainder. The
debt is unresolved. (Item 7, 8)
SOR  ¶  1.e  is  a  debt  to  a  cellular  phone  service  provider  that  was  placed  for
collection in the amount of $2,752. The debt is unresolved. (Item 7)
SOR  ¶  1.f  is  a  debt  to  a  cellular  phone  service  provider  that  was  placed  for
collection  in the  amount  of  $1,496.  In  his 2018  background interview,  Applicant  stated
that he tried to turn off his cellular phone service before deploying overseas in 2014. He
claimed that he was told that he could, but when returned home, he was told that he owed
them $1100. He claimed that he paid $400 at the time, but provided no documentation to
corroborate his claim. The debt is unresolved. (Item 5, 6, 7, 8)
SOR  ¶  1.g  is  a  credit  card  that  that  was  charged  off  for  $460.  In  his  answer,
Applicant  stated  that  he  made  arrangements  to  resolve  this  debt  by  March  30,  2022.
However, he did not provide any documentation of either the payment arrangements with
the creditor or any payments made. (Item 6, 7)
Applicant did not provide any documentation showing that any of his debts have
been  or  are  being  paid,  or  otherwise  resolved.  He  also  submitted  no  documentation
concerning his current financial situation, such as his monthly income and expenses, his
assets, or whether he follows a budget. He provided no evidence  that he has received
credit counseling.
