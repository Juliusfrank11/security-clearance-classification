Applicant  is  a  49-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  a  few
college credits and numerous technical certifications. He is married for the third time. He
and  his  second  wife  divorced  in  2019.  He  remarried  his  first  wife  in  2019.  They  are
separated. He has three children, ages 19, 18, and 10. (Transcript (Tr.) at 22-24, 63, 66;
GE 1, 2)
Applicant  owned  his  own  consulting  company  from  2003  to  2013.  He  left  that
practice to work for another company, where he worked from 2013 until a reduction in
the workforce in February 2019. He was unemployed until he obtained his current job in
about January 2020. (Tr. at 20, 24-27, 71; GE 1, 2)
Applicant’s  second  marriage  did  not  end  amicably.  He  was  the  primary  wage
earner  in  the  household.  During  the  separation,  he  had  to  maintain  two  households.
Before the marriage ended, his ex-wife used his credit to take out about $30,000 from
various  bank,  savings,  and  credit  accounts. They were  supposed to  sell any assets  in
both of their names. He had a buyer for one of their vehicles, but she refused to sign the
sales agreement. The vehicle was repossessed and sold, leaving a deficiency of $6,792
(SOR  ¶  1.c).  Because  of  all  the  factors  related  to  his  ex-wife,  their  divorce,  and
unemployment,  he  was  unable  to  pay  his  bills,  and  a  number  of  debts  became
delinquent. (Tr. at 19, 23, 52, 56-58, 70-71; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1-7)
The   SOR   alleges  ten   delinquent   debts  totaling   about  $106,000.  The   debts   are
established through credit reports and  Applicant’s admissions.
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
January  2020.  He  reported  a  number  of  financial  issues,  including  $500  in  unpaid
federal  taxes  from  2017,  child  support  arrearages,  and  a  foreclosed  mortgage.  All  of
these  issues  were  resolved  before  the  SOR  was  issued  and  were  not  alleged  in  the
SOR.1  He also reported a number of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR, with the
comment, “While going through the divorce, I accumulated a lot of debt trying to sort out
living arrangements, bills for multiple homes and legal fees.” (GE 1)
Applicant  was  interviewed  for  his  background  investigation  in  March  2020.  He
discussed  his  finances  and  indicated  that  his  ex-wife  “maxed  out”  their  credit  cards
when they were going through the divorce. He stated that he intended to pay his debts
and planned to contact the creditors to set up payment plans. (GE 2)
Applicant responded to the SOR in February 2022. He admitted owing all of the
debts and pointed to his ex-wife’s actions  and  his unemployment.  He added the same
comment for all of the debts:
1 Any matter not alleged in the SOR will not be used for disqualification purposes. It may be considered in
assessing the overall state of  Applicant’s  finances, in  the  application  of  mitigating conditions, and in the
whole-person analysis.
All   of  these   factors  were  reasonably   outside   my   control.   This   item   has
already  been  listed  as a  charge  off  by  the  debtor. Therefore, entering  into
a  payment arrangement does not serve  to  reverse the  impact to  my  credit
report nor serve to positively increase my credit standing.
Applicant  has  not  made  any  payments  toward  the  SOR  debts  since  2019.  He
retained a law firm to assist him with his credit. He was advised that the creditors have
written  off  the  debts,  and  they  will  age  off  his  credit  reports,  but  if  he  attempts  to
negotiate with the creditors, it could restart the clock. Since seven years is the standard
window for reporting adverse matter, most of his debts will not “age off” the credit report
until  about  2026.  Several  debts  were  disputed  and  deleted  from  the  credit  report  for
reasons other than that Applicant did not owe them. (Tr. at 20-22, 42-44, 52-55; GE 4-7;
Applicant’s response to SOR)
Except  for  the  unpaid  SOR  debts,  Applicant’s  finances  have  improved.  His
annual salary is $150,000. He stated that since his credit cannot be repaired by money,
he  is  not  vulnerable  to  coercion,  and  that  in  his  opinion,  the  debts  should  have  no
bearing on his security clearance. (Tr. at 28, 36, 66)
