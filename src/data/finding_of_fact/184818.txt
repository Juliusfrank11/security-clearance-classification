In  her SOR answer,  Applicant admitted all  of  the allegations,  with explanations,
except for SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.l, which she denied. Her admissions are adopted as findings
of  fact.  After  a  review  of  the  pleadings  and  evidence,  I  make  the  following  additional
findings of fact.
Applicant
is  a  48-year-old  employee  of  a
federal  contractor  performing
administrative duties. She began working for a federal contractor in October 2016. She
has worked in the medical administration field in some form since she was 16 years old.
She is a high school graduate who was taken some college courses. She was widowed
within the last year. She has two children, ages 24 and 17. She has been a Girl Scout
leader for 12 years. (Tr. 6, 18, 20, 30; GE 1)
The  SOR  alleged  12  delinquent  accounts  (two  debts  arising  from  repossessed
cars,  a  debt  from  an  unexpired  lease,  and  nine  medical  debts)  totaling  approximately
$42,476. The debts are established by credit reports from January 2020, October 2020,
and  July  2022;  Applicant’s  personal  subject  interview  (PSI)  with  an  investigator  in
February  2020;  her  June  2020  answers  to  interrogatories;  and  her  SOR  admissions.
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.l) (GE 2-6; Answer to SOR)
Applicant’s financial difficulties began  in January 2016 when she was terminated
by her employer. She was told her termination was because of management changes.
She was earning approximately $60,000 at the time of her termination. She was given six
weeks’ severance pay by her former employer. She was unemployed from January 2016
until October 2016 when she was hired by a federal contractor. When she was hired in
October 2016, her annual salary was approximately $20,000. She voluntarily surrendered
two cars and moved to a cheaper home (described in detail below) to reflect her changed
circumstances. (Tr. 20-22)
Applicant  was without health  insurance  while  unemployed  and  when  she  became
reemployed, the  health  insurance  she  could  afford required  payment  of  high  deductibles.
She  underwent emergency  surgery  in 2017  when  she  was uninsured.  When  her husband
passed  away  in 2021, she  received  the  proceeds of  two  life  insurance  policies totaling
approximately  $50,000. After funeral expenses she  received  approximately  $37,000.  She
used  some  of  this money  to  pay  her medical debts  ($10,000). She  also gave  some  to  her
son  ($6,000) and  daughter ($2,000),  paid  cash  for a  second  car  ($3,500),  put some  into
her savings account ($3,500), helped  her mother, and  bought things for herself.  (Tr. 22-
23, 25-26, 61, 64)
The status of the SOR debts is as follows:
SOR ¶  1.a-$18,058.  This debt resulted  from  the  deficiency  balance  owed  after  the
voluntary   surrender   and   sale  of   Applicant’s  car.   The   debt  was  assigned   in  September
2015,  it  was  voluntarily   surrendered   in   2017,  and   it  was  charged   off   by   the   creditor  in
March 2019.  As of  the  hearing  date,  Applicant  had  not made  any  payment arrangements.
She  provided  a  handwritten  note  on  AE  A3, indicating  that she  would  begin making  $100
payments  on  the  26th  of  each  month. She  documented  making  one  payment in August
2022.  This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 22, 35-36; GE  2-4; AE  A2-A3, A6)
SOR ¶  1.b-$10,314.  This debt resulted  from  the  deficiency  balance  owed  after the
voluntary  surrender and  sale of  Applicant’s car. The  debt was voluntarily  surrendered  in
2016,   it   was  assigned   in  September   2017,  and   it  was  charged   off   by   the   creditor  in
October  2019.  As   of   the   hearing   date,   Applicant  had   not  made   any   payment
arrangements.  She  provided  a  handwritten  note  on  AE  A3, indicating  that she  would begin
making  $100  payments on  the  26th  of  each  month. She  documented  making  one  payment
in August 2022. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 33; GE 2-4; AE A4-A6)
SOR ¶  1.c-$4,000.  Applicant  admitted  this debt.  She  incurred  this unexpired-lease
debt when  she  vacated  an  apartment before  the  lease  was up  in 2017  because  of  health
concerns.  She  believed  there was mold  in the  apartment  that was affecting  her family’s
health. She  talked  to  management  about  moving  to  another apartment but nothing  else
was available.  She  complained  to  the  building  owner but  received  no  relief.  She  felt  she
had  to  break the  lease  and  leave  for the  safety  of her family. She  did not pursue  legal
action against the apartment complex. Applicant documented  actions she took in August
2022   to   contact  the   apartment   complex   to   learn  the   status   of  this   debt.   She   failed   to
present  documentation  supporting  her assertion  of  an  inhabitable apartment due  to  mold.
This debt is reflected  as a  third-party  collection  in her July  2022  credit report. This debt is
unresolved. (Tr. 36-38; GE 6; AE A7)

creditor in June  2020.  The  creditor told Applicant that the  minimum  payment plan  was
$50  per month. Applicant could not pay  that amount, but sent the  creditor a  $10  money
order on  June  11, 2020. There is no  further evidence  of  payment until August 11, 2022,
when  Applicant documented  a  $50  payment.  She  also stated  that she  would continue  $50
monthly  payments  to  this creditor.  This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 38; GE  3  (pp.4-5); AE  A8;
