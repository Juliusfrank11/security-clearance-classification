Applicant  admitted  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.m  through  1.t.  He  denied  the
allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶ 1.a  through  1.l.  His  admissions are  adopted  as findings  of  fact.
After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I
make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  32   years  old.   He   is  not  married   and   has  no   children.   He  earned   a
bachelor’s  degree   in   2017.   He  has  been   employed   by   a   federal  contractor  since
December 2020. His  annual  salary  when  he  was hired  was $64,000  and  his current salary
is approximately $72,000. (Transcript (Tr. 14-16)
The   SOR  alleges  12   student  loans   (¶¶   1.a   through   1.l)  totaling   approximately
$50,734  that are  in collection  status. Applicant attended  college from 2008  to 2017. Two
credit reports from  2021  reflect  that he  obtained  loans in 2008, 2009, 2013, and  2016. He
took time  off  from  attending  school during  this period. When  he  graduated  from  college  in
2017,  he   was  unable   to   pay   his  student  loans  because   he   was  underemployed   or
unemployed.   He  had   the   loans   placed   in   a   deferment  status   twice,   but   was  unable  to
defer them  a  third  time. He testified  that  before  he  graduated, he  attended  an  “exit” class
that provided  information  about the  loans. A  payment plan  was not set  up  at that time. He
testified  that about six or seven months after he graduated  he contacted the Department
of  Education  (DOE) and  asked  about consolidating  his loans and  a  repayment plan, but
he   was  unemployed  and   underemployed   at the   time  and   could not  afford   to  make   the
monthly  payments they suggested, which were  between $250  - $350. (Tr. 15, 26-27, 30-
37)
In December 2020, Applicant started a full-time job with a federal contractor. He
testified that he did not think about addressing his student loans until he was required to
apply for a security clearance. He completed his security clearance application (SCA) in
January 2021, and was interviewed by a government investigator in February 2021. In
August 2022, Applicant submitted an application to DOE to rehabilitate his student loans.
He  hopes  to  come  up  with  an  income-based  repayment  plan.  He  has  not  received
correspondence from DOE regarding his application. He said he is also hoping to qualify
to  have  some of  his student  loans forgiven,  but  understands  that program  has not yet
begun. (Tr. 27-29, 37-39 GE 1; AE A)
Applicant  testified  that  he  became  energized  to  pay  his  student  loans  after
receiving the SOR. He said he heard that under a new government program there was a
chance his loans could be forgiven, but the loans had to be in good standing to qualify for
a  forgiveness  program.  Based  on  that  information,  he  applied  for  the  rehabilitation
program. He is hopeful that some of his loans may be forgiven, if a government program
is approved. He has not made any payments on his student loans since graduating from
college.  He  stated  he  did  not  realize  failure  to  address  his  student  loans  might  be  a
hindrance to him obtaining a security clearance. He testified that his plan is to not make
contributions to his 401k pension plan and Individual Retirement Account and use that
money to pay his student loans. He understands he has an obligation to pay the student
loans and intends to do so. He stated he was aware that in February 2021 his student
loans were deferred due to the pandemic. (Tr. 39-40, 43-50)
SOR ¶  1.m  ($1,189) alleged  a  charged-off  credit-card account.  Applicant admitted
he  owed  this debt and  testified  that he  had  failed  to  pay  the  debt at the  time  it was due.
He said he  had  contacted  the  creditor about the  debt.  He told the  creditor that he  could
only  afford to  pay  what was originally  owed  and  could not  afford the  added  interest.  He
testified  that with  his other expenses, he  has not paid the  debt because  the  amount is too
much. He  said  he  could  afford  to  pay  $100. In  his  September 2021  answer to  the  SOR,
he   stated,  “I am   not  aware  of   a   [creditor in  SOR   ¶   1.m] debt  that requires  a   payment.
Currently  working on a payment plan  to execute and have that debt paid off.” (Answer to
SOR) He testified  that  he  does  have  a  plan  to  pay  the  debt,  but has not executed  it.  His
plan  is to  take  money  from  his health  saving  account to  pay  the  debt.  The  debt is reported
as  charged   off   on   two   2021   credit  reports.   After  his  hearing,  Applicant   provided   a
settlement agreement with  the  creditor. He was to  make  an  initial payment on  December
12, 2022,  of  $100 and  a  final payment on January 12, 2023 of $374.  He provided a copy
of  the  settlement  agreement.  He  did not  provide  proof he  made  the  first payment.  (Tr.  17-
22; AE B)
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.n ($167) was for unpaid insurance. He provided a receipt that
the debt was paid. (Tr. 22-23; Answer to SOR)
The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.o through 1.t are unpaid utility bills. Applicant explained he
and his roommates were renting a house together while in school. The utilities were in
Applicant’s  name.  Applicant moved  out and  his roommates  remained,  but  they did not
pay  the  utilities.  When  he  learned  the  bills  were  unpaid,  he  contacted  his  former
roommates who gave him the money to pay the bills. He stated he would provide proof
that  the debts  were  paid.  Post-hearing he  provided  a  document to show the  debt  was
resolved in February 2022. (Tr. 22-26; AE C)
