Applicant  admitted  the  December  2019  arrest,  in  which  he  was  charged  with
Extreme  DUI  and  had  a  blood  alcohol  content  (BAC)  above  .20%.  (SOR  ¶1.a)  He
admitted a June 2015 DUI charge with a BAC between .12 and .15%. (SOR ¶ 1.b) He

He pleaded guilty to the 2015 DUI, and he was ordered by the court to complete three
months  of  counseling,  fined  approximately  $2,000,  and  required  to  install  an  interlock
device  on  his vehicle  for  one  year. He  also pleaded  guilty  to  the December 2019  DUI

During  a  background  interview  in  July  2019,  Applicant  discussed  in  detail  his
alcohol-related charges with an authorized government investigator. He  also described
his general pattern of drinking as consuming four to eight beers at home on the weekends.
When questioned about the likelihood that he would consume alcohol to the point where
he once again faced  adverse  consequences,  Applicant’s  reply  was  that it  would never
happen. He stated that he made a conscious decision to not consume alcohol to excess
in the future. In the event he was out drinking socially, he would use the services of an
ride-share service to prevent another DUI. Five months after this interview, Applicant was
arrested in December 2019 for DUI with a blood alcohol content above .20%. (GE 4)
