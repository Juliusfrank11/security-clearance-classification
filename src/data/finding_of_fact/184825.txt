Applicant  admitted  the  SOR  allegations  in  ¶¶  1.a,  1.e,  1.f,  1.g  and  1.i,  with
explanations.  He  denied  the  SOR  allegations  in  ¶¶  1.b,  1.c,  1.d,  and  1.h,  with
explanations. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough
and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant is 74 years old. He is a college graduate and holds a master’s degree.
He married in 1969 and was widowed in 2004. He has an adult child from the marriage.
He  remarried  in  2006  and  has  two  adult  stepchildren.  He  was  employed  by  a  federal
contractor from 1997 until his retirement in 2006. He was unemployed for six months then
began work with another federal contractor from 2006 to 2013. He went back to work for
his previous employer from 2013 to the present. (Item 4)
In  2010,  Applicant  withdrew  $100,000  from  his  pension  plan  to  pay  for  home
improvements and the purchase of two vehicles. In Applicant’s November 2011 security
clearance  application  (SCA),  he  disclosed  that  he  was  making  payments  on  his  2010
federal income tax debt and that he owed the IRS $19,000. He said he had established
an installment agreement with the IRS to pay the debt. (Item 10)
In December 2011, a government investigator interviewed Applicant. He explained
that when he withdrew money from his pension plan, he asked that the federal taxes be
withheld, and he thought it was understood that he wanted to receive $100,000 after taxes
were withheld. He admitted he did not examine the documents as closely as he should
have. When he filed his 2010 federal income tax return, he realized the taxes were not
withheld, and he owed $30,000 to the IRS. He said he used the remaining funds he had
left from the withdrawal to pay some of the taxes owed and made a payment arrangement
with the IRS to pay $325 a month on the current balance owed at that time of $19,000. At
that time, he said that he intended to continue to make payments to the IRS until the debt
was paid. (Item 5)
In Applicant’s May 2019 SCA, he disclosed that he filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in
February 2017. It was dismissed in November 2018, and he and his wife planned to refile
under Chapter 7. He explained that his mortgage debt was being handled as a deed in
lieu of foreclosure and the mortgage company was going to forgive the deficiency owed.
He also said the IRS would forgive approximately $35,000 of “older debt, but not about
$11,000 of new debt.” (Item 4) He expected all of his unsecured debts to be discharged
in bankruptcy. (Item 4)
Regarding Applicant’s tax returns,  he  said in  the  SCA, “Always filed  tax returns,
but owe money to the IRS as described elsewhere.” (Item 4) He disclosed that he failed
to pay his 2015 federal income tax. He stated, “Loss of income because wife [L] lost her
job  years  ago,  remains  unemployed,  and  in  recent  years  had  significant  medical
expenses.”  (Item  4)  He  estimated  he  owed  $11,000  and  further  stated  his  actions  to
resolve the problem were through bankruptcy and by increased withholdings. (Item 4)
In July 2019, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. He told the
investigator  that  he  intended  to  resolve  his  financial  problems  through  bankruptcy.  He
acknowledged  that  when  his  debts  were  discharged  in  bankruptcy,  he  would  still  be
responsible for his student loans. He also discussed that he had tentatively reached an
agreement  with  the  IRS.  It  had  agreed  to  forgive  $35,000  in  older  tax  debt  from
approximately 2015,  but  he  would  still be  responsible for  his more  recent  tax  debts  of
about  $11,000.  He  acknowledged  that  he  had  not  spoken  with  an  IRS  representative
since November 2018. (Item 5)
Applicant and his wife filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in September 2021. Schedule E,
priority  unsecured  claims  reflects  $56,727  (federal  taxes)  and  Schedule  F,  nonpriority
unsecured  claims  reflects  $87,171  of  student  loans,  consumer,  and  other  debts.  His
bankruptcy  documents  reflect  that  his  gross  monthly  income  is  $10,172  and  after  his
deductions, it is $6,346 and his monthly expenses are $7,945, leaving a monthly deficit
of $1,598. He lists his annual income for 2020 as $174,712 and 2019 as $118,000. He
listed his income for 2021 from January to the date he filed bankruptcy as $90,800. His
debts were discharged in December 2021. (Item 6 at pages 13, 24-32, 36-42)
In  June  2022,  Applicant  responded  to  government  interrogatories.  He  indicated
that all of his federal income tax returns through tax year 2021 were filed. He stated that
he was verbally advised by the IRS in August 2021 that he owed taxes for 2011 ($37,949),
2013 ($4,775), 2015 ($1,964), 2016 ($5,714) and 2018 ($6,325). (Item 5)
Applicant further explained that in February 2022, he contacted the IRS and was
verbally told that due to his Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in December 2021, the IRS
eliminated his 2011 and 2013 tax debt and reduced his 2015 and 2016 tax debts. The
bankruptcy did not affect subsequent years’ tax debts. He believed that the amount the
IRS would indicate he owed was approximately $21,732 for tax years 2015, 2016, 2017,
and  2018.  The  2017  tax  debt  included  penalties  and  interest  for failing  to  file  on  time.
Applicant disputed that he failed to file on time. He claimed he mailed his tax return on
time. The IRS transcript for tax year 2017 indicates it was not filed on time. The amount
of  penalties  for  2017  were  approximately $6,663.  He  intended  to  resolve  the  disputed
amount owed with the IRS. (Item 5)
Included  with  Applicant’s  response  to  interrogatories  were  IRS  tax  transcripts,
which were from May 2022. The tax transcript for tax year 2021 showed that no tax return
was filed. For tax year 2020, it showed an extension was granted until October 2021, and
no  tax  return  was  filed.  For  tax  year  2019,  it  showed  an  extension  was  granted  until
October 2020, and no tax return was filed. For tax year 2018, it showed Applicant filed
his tax return late and a penalty was accessed. The balance owed for 2018 was $6,456.
(Item 5)
Applicant provided IRS tax transcripts from June 2022 with this answer to the SOR.
His 2011 tax-year transcript showed he did not owe a current balance because in March
2022 the IRS wrote-off the balance owed of $21,797. His 2013 tax-year transcript showed
he did not owe a current balance because in March 2022 the IRS wrote-off the balance
owed of $3,277. His 2015 tax-year transcript reflected that refunds from 2020 and 2019
(which included the pandemic tax credits for these years) were applied to his delinquent
balance,  and  he  owed  a  negligible  amount  (65  cents).  His  2016  tax-year  transcript
reflected that he owed $2,537, after a refund from 2019 was applied to the delinquent
balance. (Item 3)
Applicant’s 2017 tax-year transcript reflects he filed this return in October 2021 and
he  owes  a  balance  of  $9,289.  Applicant  disputed  the  late  filing  penalty.  He  did  not
document a resolution from the IRS regarding the dispute. He provided a paper copy of
his  2017  federal  income  tax  return  date.  The  date  is  illegible  and  is  not  proof  that  the
return was mailed and filed timely. His 2018 tax year transcript reflects he owes $6,477.
(Item 3)
In  Applicant’s answer to  the  SOR, he  provided  paper copies  of his 2019  federal
income  tax  return  dated  September 23,  2021.  He  provided  a  copy  of  a  request for an
extension for his 2019 federal income tax return, which would have extended the deadline
to  October  2020.  His  2019  tax-year  transcript  reflects  his  2019  tax  return  was  filed  in
September 2021. He was entitled to a refund that was applied to his 2015 and 2016 tax
debt. (Item 3)
In  Applicant’s answer to  the SOR, he provided  a  paper copy of a request for an
extension for filing his 2020 tax return. His 2020 tax-year transcript reflects he filed his
2020 return in September 2021, and he did not owe taxes and was entitled to a refund
($1,156). His refund was applied to his 2015 delinquent tax balance. (Item 3)
Applicant’s 2021 tax-year transcript from June 2022 reflects that his federal income
tax return had not been filed. The only item noted was he received a tax-relief credit of
$1,400 (due to the pandemic) that was applied to his delinquent tax balance. In his FORM
response, he included a paper copy of his 2021 tax return that shows he signed it on April
18, 2022. There is no proof it was mailed and received by the IRS. The tax transcripts are
the most probative evidence. (Item 3; AE B)
In Applicant’s response to the FORM, he  attributed his financial difficulties to his
wife  losing  her  job  in  2010  and  then  her  medical  problems  in  2015  or  2016.  He  also
indicated  he  has  provided  financial  and  other  support  to  two  adult  children  and
grandchildren.  They  assist  one  child,  who  has  a  chronic  medical  condition,  with  her
medical  bills  and  assistance  in  ensuring  she  attends  appointments  and  other  medical
matters. The other child and her three children continue to live with Applicant and his wife
and they are helping her become more financially independent.  She receives sporadic
child support from the fathers of her children. This has put a financial strain on Applicant
and his wife. He believes providing them support is beyond his control. Applicant’s 2019
SCA shows he and his wife took an all-inclusive vacation to Jamaica in 2014. (AE A)
Applicant stated that his finances are improving. He notes the significant reduction
in  the  amount  he  owes  the  IRS,  due  largely  to  its  write-off  of  his  older  tax  debts  and
because he has received tax refunds in 2019, 2020, and 2021, that were applied to his
delinquent tax debts. He said that he has been in contact with the IRS and agreed to an
installment agreement to pay $300 a month beginning in October 2022, toward what he
believes is the current balance owed of $15,880 for tax years 2016 through 2018. He did
not provide  a  copy of  the  installment agreement.  He said he is current  on his monthly
expenses, and he is paying delinquent gas and electric bills each  month that were not
discharged  in  bankruptcy.  Applicant  did  not provide  an  explanation  for  why  he  did  not
timely pay his federal income taxes for multiple years or timely file others. He also did not
comment on his 2017 tax year debt.
The SOR alleges that in 2018 Applicant misused his company’s travel credit card
for an ATM cash withdrawal. He admitted in his answer to the SOR that this happened,
but said it was inadvertent and he repaid the amount. He told the government investigator
in his July 2019 interview that in June 2018, he was short on money to pay some of his
wife’s medical bills and decided to take money from his account and inadvertently used
his work credit card and withdrew $400. His employer notified him and he was given a
verbal and written warning from his supervisor. He repaid the amount in December 2018.
(Item 5)
Any derogatory matters that were not alleged in the SOR will not be considered for
disqualifying purposes. They may be considered when applying mitigating conditions, in
making a credibility determination, and in a whole-person analysis.
