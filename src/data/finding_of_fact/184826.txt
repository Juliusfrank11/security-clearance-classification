Applicant is a 59-year-old employee of a government contractor. He has worked
for his current employer or a subcontractor thereof since about 2017. He was awarded a
high  school  diploma  in  1981,  and  has  taken  some  online  college  courses  without
earning  an  additional  degree.  He  was  married  from  1983  until  a  divorce  in  1996.  He
remarried his ex-spouse in 2019. He has two adult children. He served in the U.S. Army
from 1981 until 2001, when he received an honorable discharge. He has been working
for government contractors since he retired from the military. (Tr. 18, 21-24; GE 1, 3; AE

In  March  2014,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  operating  a  vehicle
while intoxicated (OVWI). On the night of his arrest, he claimed that he was in a hotel as
he  was  traveling  for  work.  He  claimed  that  he  had  taken  NyQuil  because  he  wasn’t
feeling well. He claimed that his co-workers had gone to a bar and needed to be picked
up, so he drove from the hotel  to a bar to pick them up. He claimed that he could not
find his friends at the bar, so he drove back to the hotel where he was staying. As he
pulled  into  the  hotel,  he  was  stopped  by  a  police  officer  who  told  him  he  had  been
swerving  while  driving.  He  claimed  that  he  explained  to  the  police  officer  that  he  had
taken  cold  medicine  and  had  not  been  drinking,  but  the  police  officer  arrested  him  on
suspicion  of  OVWI  because  he  had  been  swerving  and  because  the  police  officer
smelled  alcohol  on  his  breath.  At  the  police  station,  Applicant  was  administered  a
breathalyzer that indicated (at least) the presence of alcohol. Based upon the totality of
the evidence, including an analysis of Applicant’s credibility, Applicant was driving while
impaired by alcohol. (Tr. 24-32, 34-39; Answer; GE 3, 5)
Applicant failed to appear in court for his hearing regarding his 2014 OVWI. He
claimed that, prior to his hearing date, he contacted the court to let them know that he
would be out of the country for work on his hearing date, and that he provided the court
the information they requested to justify his absence. Regardless, in February 2015, the
court  found  that  he  failed  to  appear  and  issued  a  warrant  for  his  arrest.  Applicant
claimed that when he got back from being out of the country for work, he contacted the
court and the court told him that he did not need to take any further action regarding his
2014 OVWI arrest or his failure to appear. He claimed that he has e-mails to this effect
but he did not present them as evidence. (Tr. 20, 46-47; Answer; GE 3, 5)
In 2017, Applicant  learned from two different sources that he still had a warrant
out  for  his  arrest  for  failure  to  appear  on  his  2014  OVWI.  One  source  was  the
government contractor that conducted his November 2017 security interview. The other
source  was  a  security  police  officer  at  a  military  base  who  pulled  Applicant  over  for
expired  tags.  During  his  November  2017  security  interview,  he  told  the  government
contractor that he would resolve the outstanding warrant. He claimed that he contacted
the  court  via  telephone,  paid  a  fine,  and  believed  that  he  had  resolved  the  failure  to
appear.  He  provided  no  documentary  evidence  to  corroborate  any  resolution  of  his
failure to appear in 2017. He also claimed in his testimony and Answer that he did not
find  out  about  his  failure  to  appear  until  2020  or  2021.  When  asked  about  the
discrepancies  in  his  Answer  and  testimony,  he  was  evasive.  After  several  chances  to
explain  these  discrepancies,  he  eventually  claimed  that  he  had  made  a  mistake  when
he  indicated  that  he  found  out  about  his  failure  to  appear  in  2020  or  2021.  His
evasiveness  and  inconsistent  representations  regarding  his  discovery  of  his  failure  to
appear undermine his credibility. (Tr. 20, 46-52; GE 3, 5)
In 2020, Applicant claimed that, during another security interview, he learned that
the warrant for his failure to appear was still outstanding. He hired an attorney. On July
13, 2021, he entered a plea agreement whereby he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor of
operating a vehicle with a blood alcohol content of .08 or greater.  Pursuant to his plea
agreement, he was  sentenced to time  served  (2 days) and ordered  to pay court costs
and fees. He was not placed on probation and his license was not suspended. This plea
agreement  resolved  the  issue  of  his  failure  to  appear.  While  technically  breaking  the
law, given his efforts to resolve his failure to appear, he was not knowingly engaging in
criminal behavior while this charge was outstanding. (Tr. 20, 47-50; Answer; GE 3, 5)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  1996  for  driving  under  the  influence  of  alcohol  (DUI)
while  operating  a  vehicle  on  a  military  base.  He  failed  a  field  sobriety  test  and,  after
taking a breathalyzer test, his blood alcohol content was over the legal limit. In 1997, he
pleaded guilty in federal district court to a lesser charge of negligent driving in the first
degree. (Tr. 22, 35; GE 3, 4)
State  A  entered  a  tax  lien  against  Applicant  in  2011  for  $912  for  unpaid  taxes.
Applicant  claimed  that  he  paid  this  tax  lien  in  2018,  but  he  did  not  provide
documentation to corroborate that this lien has been satisfied. During his 2017 security
interview, he denied the existence of this lien, but admitted it in his Answer. He claimed
that he fell behind on his taxes to State A because he was not making enough money to
make  ends  meet  and  he  was  not  paying  attention.  He  was  also  not  having  enough
money in taxes withheld from his income. (Tr. 19-20, 37-39, 42; Answer; GE 3, 6)
Applicant  failed  to  timely  pay  his  federal  taxes  for  the  2008,  2009,  2013,  2015,
and 2016 tax years. He claimed that he made a payment arrangement with the IRS in
2017  to  pay  $600  per  month  towards  his  $7,600  federal  tax  debt.  He  provided
documents from the IRS corroborating that he made $600 monthly payments from June
2017  until  April  2018,  and  a  $3,423  payment  in  May  2018.  He  paid  these  delinquent
federal  taxes  in  full  in  May  2018.  Applicant  claimed  that  his  federal  taxes  were
delinquent because he was not paying attention and was not withholding enough money
in taxes from his income. He claimed that he has changed his withholdings so that he
does  not  owe  taxes  at  the  end  of  the  tax  year.  Applicant  did  not  timely  file  his  2012,
2013,  and  2015 federal  income  tax  returns.  He filed  his delinquent  federal  income  tax
returns  in  May  2017.  Any  adverse  information  not  alleged  in  the  SOR,  such  as
Applicant’s failure to timely file federal income tax returns  and his 1996 DUI, cannot be
used for disqualification purposes. It may be considered when assessing the application
of  mitigating  conditions  and  for  the  whole-person  analysis.  (Tr.  19-20,  37-38,  43-44;
Answer; GE 3, 7)
Despite  being  required  to  do  so,  Applicant  failed  to  report  his  2014  arrest  for
OVWI  on  the  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  he  submitted  in  May  2017
(2017 SF 86) and April 2020 (2020 SF 86). His failure to report the OVWI in the 2020
SF  86  came  after  a  DOD  investigator  confronted  him  with  the  arrest  during  his  2017
clearance  interview.  He  also  lied  to  a  DOD  investigator  during  his  2020  security
interview when he claimed that he had not been arrested in 2014 on an alcohol charge.
During his April 2021 security interview, he lied to a DOD investigator when he denied
ever  having  been  arrested  on  any  other  alcohol-related  charges  despite  having  also
been arrested in 1996. His explanations for why he failed to  report the relevant arrests
on  his  2017  and  2020  SF  86  and  during  his  2020  and  2021  security  interviews  were
varied  and  inconsistent.  Applicant’s  explanations  included  forgetting  about  the  arrests,
not  understanding  the  question  as  provided  in  the  clearance  applications,  being
confused,  and  claiming  that  it  was  actually  his  cousin  with  a  similar  name  and  Social
Security number who had been arrested. These inconsistent representations undermine
Applicant’s credibility and strain credulity. (Tr. 23-24, 28-32, 34-39; Answer; GE 1-3)
Despite  being  required  to  do  so,  Applicant  failed  to  report  his  state  and  federal
tax  delinquencies  on  his  2017  SF  86  and  2020  SF  86.  He  claimed  that  he  made  a
mistake when he failed to report these tax delinquencies on his 2017 SF 86. He claimed
that he did not report these tax delinquencies on his 2020 SF 86 because he thought he
did not have to because he had paid his delinquent taxes.  (Tr. 32-34; Answer; GE 1-3,
6, 7)
Applicant  has  filled  out  approximately  10  security  clearance  applications
throughout  his  career,  so  he  is  not  new  to  the  process.  Given  his  lack  of  credibility
based upon his evasiveness and inconsistent and unbelievable explanations, as well as
his failure to divulge the required information, he deliberately failed to disclose his 2014
OVWI arrest on his 2017 SF 86 and his 2020 SF 86. He also lied to a DOD investigator
regarding  this  arrest  and  his  1996  DUI  arrest.  For  the  foregoing  reasons,  he  also
deliberately failed to disclose his state and federal tax delinquencies on his 2017 SF 86
and  his  2020  SF  86.  He  did  admit  his  federal  and  state  tax  delinquencies  during  his
2017 security interviews before being confronted. (Tr. 32-34, 45-52; Answer; GE 1-7)
Applicant  provided  character reference  letters from two  of  his supervisors.  Both
claim  that  Applicant  needs  his  security  clearance  to  perform  his  job  and  recommend
that  he  be  awarded  one.  They  note  that  he  is  a  hard  worker  and  has  not  had  any
security related incidents. (AE A, B)
