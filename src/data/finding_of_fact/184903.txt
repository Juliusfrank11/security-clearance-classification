Applicant admitted to the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c., 1.h., and 1.i. He denied
SOR  allegations¶¶  1.a,  and  1.d.~1.g.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  51-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed with the defense contractor, off and on, since December of 2018. He is twice
divorced, and has one child, age 14, and two adult children.  (GX 1 at pages 7, 14, and
25~27,  and  TR  at  page  13  line  4  to  page  15  line  2.)  Applicant  attributes  the  alleged
financial  difficulties  to  a  loss  of  employment  “in  2019/2020,”  due  to  the  “Covid-19
Pandemic.” (TR at page 19 lines 2~5.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
1.a. and  1.e. Applicant denies past-due medical accounts totaling about $614. He
never  received  medical  bills,  and  these  two  alleged  debts  do  not  appear  on  the
Government’s most recent June  2022  credit report. (TR at page 15 line 14 to page 17
line 2, at page 20 line 23 to page 22 line 3, and GX 6.)
1.b. and  1.c. Applicant is current with his student loans. (TR at page 17 line 3 to
page 18 line 15, and AppXs I and J.)
1.d.  Applicant  denies  that  he  has  back  child  support  totaling  about  $2,143.  He
has  submitted  documentation  in  support  of  his  contention.  (TR  at  page  18  line  16  to
page 20 line 21, and AppXs A and H.)
1.e. has been discussed, above.
1.f. Applicant denies that he has a past-due cellular phone bill in the amount of
$182. (TR at page 22 line 4 to page 23 line 12.) He has offered documentation showing
it is “paid in full.” (AppXs K and L.)
1.g. Applicant denies that he has a past-due debt to Creditor G in the amount of
about $321. (TR at page 23 line 13 to page 24 line 22, and AppX M.) Furthermore, this
debt does not appear on the Government’s most recent June 2022 credit report (GX 6.)
1.h.  Applicant has submitted documentation that he has filed his Federal income
tax returns for tax years 2014 and 2016. (AppXs D and E.) Initially, his former spouse
filed  joint  returns  for  three  years,  which  precluded  Applicant  from  filing  an  individual
return, despite his best efforts. (TR at page 24 line 23 to page 27 line 10.)
1.i. Applicant avers credibly that he filed his state income tax return for tax year
2014, when he was able to file his Federal return for that tax year. (TR at page 27 line
11 to page 28 line 5.)
