Applicant  admitted  to  all  the  allegations  in  SOR.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  32-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed  with  the defense  contractor since 2019.  Applicant  has  never  held  a  security
clearance.  He is  not married, and has  no children.  (TR at page 6 at line 21 to page 7
line 14, and GX 1 at pages 7, 13~14, 22~23 and 38~39.)
Guideline I  –  Psychological Conditions  & Guideline E  - Personal Conduct
1.a.   and   4.a   From  about  June  of  2018  to  about  July  of  2018,  Applicant  was
hospitalized for Depression with suicidal ideation. He was diagnosed as suffering from a
Major  Depressive  Disorder
–  MDMA,
Methamphetamines,  Amphetamines,  and  Possibly  Alcohol.  (TR  at  page  33  line  18  to
page 36 line 4, and GX 4.)
and  Polysubstance  Dependence
1.b.  and  4.a.  In about August of 2020, Applicant was diagnosed as suffering from
a Bipolar 1 Disorder, Depressed Episode with Associated Features. (GX 5.)
1.c.  and  4.a. In May of 2021, Applicant was evaluated by a licensed psychologist.
He  was  diagnosed  as  suffering  from  an  Unspecified  Bipolar  and  Related  Disorder,
Unspecified  Schizophrenia  Spectrum  and  Other  Psychotic  Disorder,  Unspecified
Alcohol  Related  Disorder,  and  Stimulant  Use  Disorder,  moderate,  amphetamine  type
substance,  in  sustained  remission.  The  psychologist  further  found  that  Applicant’s
mental health  diagnoses may be  a  significant risk to  Applicant’s judgment, reliability or
trustworthiness  concerning  classified  information.  (TR  at  page  24  line  24  to  page  33
line 17, and GX 3.)
Guideline   H  -  Drug   Involvement   and Substance   Misuse   &   Guideline   E   -  Personal
Conduct
2.a.  and  4.a.  Applicant used the prescription drug Adderall without a prescription
from about 2017 to about June of 2018. (TR at page 32 line 5 to page 36 line 5.)
2.b.  and  4.a. Applicant used marijuana on various occasions from about 2006 to
May of 2021. (TR at page 22 line 23 to page 23 line 1, and at page 36 lines 6~17.)
2.c.   and   4.a.   Applicant  used  cocaine  on  various  occasions  from  about  2010  to
August of 2018. (TR at page 23 lines 2~4.)
2.d.  and  4.a. Applicant used MDMA on various occasions from about February of
2018 to July  of 2018. (TR at page 23 lines 5~8.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations  & Guideline E  - Personal Conduct
3.a.  Applicant  admits  that  he  had  a  past-due  credit  card  debt  in  the  amount  of
about $37,201.  Applicant avers that he has a “monthly schedule of repayment,” but has
offered nothing in  support of  his averment.  (TR at page 17 line 11 to page 20 line 13,
and GX 7 at page 7.)
Guideline E  - Personal Conduct
4.a. has been discussed, above.
4.b.  In  about  November  of  2011,  Applicant  was  charged  with  and  convicted  of
Driving  Under  the  Influence  of  alcohol  or  drugs.  He  was  placed  on  probation  for  ten
years. (GX 6.)
4.c.   Applicant  failed  to  disclose  his  past  marijuana,  cocaine  and  MDMA  use  in
answer  to  “Section  23  - Illegal  Use  of  Drugs  or  Drug  Activity”  on  his  August  8,  2019
Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). (TR at page 20 line 14
to page 23 line 8, and GX 1 at pages 35~36.) I find this to be a willful falsification.
4.d. Applicant failed to disclose his past marijuana, cocaine and MDMA use in his
Response to Interrogatories on December 18, 2021. (TR at page 23 line 9 to page 24
line 23, and GX 2 at page 11.)  I find this to be a willful falsification.
