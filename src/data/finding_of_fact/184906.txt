Applicant  is  a  48-year-old  sheet  metal  mechanic  work  lead,  who  has  been
employed  by  a  defense  contractor  since  August  2019.  He  is  a  first-time  applicant  for
security  clearance.  Successfully  vetting  for  a  clearance  is  a  requirement  of  his
continued employment. His employer has given him until January 24, 2023 to have his
clearance issues resolved or face termination. (Tr. 13-18; GE 1)
Applicant  graduated  from  high  school  in  1992.  He  was  awarded  a  Bachelor  of
Science  degree  in  business  administration  in  1996.  (Tr.  18-20;  GE  1)  He  married  in
2007, and has two children, a 14-year-old son and an 11-year-old daughter. His wife is
employed full-time as an assembler in the private sector. (Tr. 20-22)
Financial Considerations
Applicant’s SOR lists nine allegations under this concern. These allegations are
established  by  his  July  16,  2019  SF-86;  his  September  23,  2019  Office  of  Personnel
Management  (OPM)  Personal  Subject  Interview  (PSI);  his  September  1,  2022  SOR
Answer;  his  August  6,  2019,  February  6,  2020,  May  20,  2022,  and  October  26,  2022
credit reports; his July 16, 2022 Response to Interrogatories; and his hearing testimony.
(GE 1 through 7; SOR Answer)
Applicant’s financial difficulties began when his father passed away in 2002, and
his mother passed away two years later in 2004. Applicant is one of three children from
a  traditional  Vietnamese  family.  The  three  children  split  the  costs  of  their  parents’
funerals  with  each  contributing  $10,000  for their  mother’s  funeral expenses,  and  each
contributing $15,000 for their father’s funeral expenses. Additionally, the family incurred
the  further  expense  to  reinter  their  father  next  to  their  mother’s  gravesite.  (Tr.  22-26)
Applicant charged his portion of his parents’ funeral costs to his credit cards. (Tr. 26)
A  coworker  suggested  that  Applicant  consolidate  his  credit  card  debt,  which  he
did  with  a  $25,000  consolidation  loan  in  2011.  (Tr.  26)  However,  shortly  after  he  took
out the  consolidation  loan, he was  unemployed  and  was  required to use  consolidation
loan  funds  to  meet  living  expenses  for  his  family.  (Tr.  26)  Applicant  reported  several
periods of unemployment on his SF-86: June 2018 to January 2019; September 2015 to
June 2016; September 2011 to September 2012; and February 2010 to July 2010. (Tr.
27-28;  GE  1)  Applicant  drew  unemployment  compensation  during  those  periods  of
unemployment and his wife continued to work; however, he was never able to recover
from  the  income  shortfalls  from  his  loss  of  employment.  (Tr.  28-29)  In  short,  the
unplanned expenses for the funerals of both of his parents within a two-year period, and
four periods of unemployment were circumstances beyond his control. (Tr. 29)
Up until 2019, Applicant was current on his bills, but he was carrying significant
debt.  (Tr.  34-35)  In  2019,  before  he  started  his  current  job,  he  consulted  a  debt  relief
company (DRC) that advised him to stop paying his debts. Their counsel was that when
his  debts  became  delinquent,  the  DRC  could  negotiate  settlements  with  his  various
creditors.  However,  shortly  after  discussing  a  recovery  plan  with  the  DRC,  Applicant’s
wife was laid off due to Covid, and he was unable to afford the DRC monthly payments.
(Tr. 39-40)
On   July   16,   2022,   Applicant  entered   into   a   44-month   plan   with   a   debt
consolidation   company   (DCC),  approximately   one   month   before  his  August  24,  2022
SOR was issued.  He pays $393  by  direct debit to  the  DCC on  the  15th  and  30th  of each
month.   He provided  documentation  of  making  timely  payments to  the  DCC.  The  DCC
uses these  funds to  pay  off  and/or settle his enrolled  debts.  (Tr. 38-39; AE  C-1, AE  C-2,
AE   C-3,  AE   C-4,  AE   C-5,  AE   C-6)  Later,   on   November  9,  2022,  Applicant  signed   an
agreement with  a  law  firm  (LF)  to  resolve  three  of  his SOR debts that evolved  into  civil
lawsuits. (AE  B-2, AE  B-3)  The  applicability  of  these  agreements are discussed  further
below.

RESOLVED.
As noted  above,  two  out of  the  nine  accounts are  resolved,  and  Applicant  has a
plan  in place  to  resolve  the  remaining  debts.  Applicant is paid at a  rate  of  $40  an  hour,
and    estimates  his  annual  salary    to    be    in  the    range    of    $70,000    to    $80,000.  His  wife’s
annual salary  is approximately  $36,000. He  owns his home,  valued  at  $700,000,  and  he
owes  approximately   $330,000   on   his   mortgage.  Applicant  drives  a   2006   Honda   Pilot
and  his wife  drives a  2003  Honda  Accord. The  liens on  both  vehicles are paid. (Tr. 29-
32)  Applicant   sought  financial   counseling  through  his DCC, and  he   prepared   a  budget
for  DCC  when    he    signed    up    for  their    service  on    July    16,  2022.  Applicant’s  combined
monthly income is $6,688, his total monthly expenses are $5,848, his monthly deposit to
DCC is $786, and his net monthly remainder is $54. (Tr. 32, 65-65; GE 7; AE C-1)
Before  Applicant  encountered  his  current  financial  difficulties,  his  credit  score
was  in  the  800  range.  He  currently  has  one  credit  card  and  only  uses  that  when
payment is required by credit card. He is committed to becoming debt free. This entire
experience  has  been  very  stressful  for  his  family  and  himself.  He  is  not  interested  in
filing bankruptcy because these debts are his and he wants to do what is right by paying
them  off.  (Tr. 66-67) Applicant’s  “biggest  goal”  is to  pay  his debts and  get  his security
clearance.  He  does  not  want  to  go  through  this  process  the  next  time  his  security
clearance comes up for renewal. (Tr. 68)
Character Evidence
Applicant submitted  six  reference  letters  to  include his production  site  supervisor
and  direct supervisor,  his site  manager, and  four co-workers. Collectively, these  letters
describe   Applicant  as  hardworking,  honest,  reliable,   trustworthy,  a  team   player,  family
oriented, and  as  an  asset to  their  respective  organization. The  authors of  his reference
letters  enthusiastically  support his application  for a  security  clearance. (Tr. 69-72; AE  A-
1 –   A-6)
