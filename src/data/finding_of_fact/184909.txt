Applicant  is  a  50-year-old  forensics  analyst,  systems  engineer,  and  network
engineer,  who  has  been  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  since  August  2013.  He
seeks  to  retain  his  Top  Secret  security  clearance,  which  is  a  requirement  of  his
continued employment. Additionally, in April 2022 he became the facility security officer
for his company. (Tr. 12-14, 40-41)
Applicant  graduated  from  high  school  in  June  1990.  He  attended  an  online
university  and  is  “two  classes  short”  from  earning  a  Bachelor  of  Science  degree  in
information  technology.  (Tr.  14-15)  He  served  in  the  U.S.  Air  Force  from  November
1990 to October 1994. He then served in the Army National Guard from October 1994
to  December  1995,  and  transferred  to  the  Air  National  Guard  where  he  served  from
December  1995  to  December  2005.  He  was  honorably  discharged  as  a  technical
sergeant  (pay  grade  E-6).  He  has  almost  15  years  of  cumulative  military  service,  but
has not served  enough time in the armed forces  to qualify for retirement benefits from
either active duty or reserve service. [Note – I relied on Applicant’s statement of service
as the primary source document for his service dates.] (Tr. 15-17, 38-39; GE 1; AE CC,
AE DD, AE EE) Applicant stated that he has continuously held a clearance since 1990
until present, except for the time he was in the Army National Guard. (Tr. 86)
Applicant has been married three times, the first marriage was from May 1995 to
March  1999,  and  the  second  marriage  was  from  July  1999  to  October  2015.  Both  of
those  marriages  ended  by  divorce.  Applicant  married  a  third  time  in  August  2020,
separated  in  January 2022,  and  as  of  the  time  the  record  closed,  was  pending  a final
divorce.  He  has  two  adult  children  from  his second  marriage,  who  are  both  financially
independent. (Tr. 17-19, 87; AE O)
Financial Considerations
The  SOR  lists  15  allegations  under  this  concern.  The  first  two  allege  that  he
failed to file his Federal  income tax returns for tax years 2013, 2016, 2017, and 2018;
the  third  alleges  he  owes  the  Federal  Government  $9,503  for  delinquent  taxes  for  tax
year  2012;  and  the  remaining  12  deal  with  delinquent  accounts,  all  of  which  are
discussed in further detail below. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.o)
The SOR allegations are established by his March 5, 2020 SF-86; his Response
to  DOHA  Interrogatories,  undated,  with  his adopted May 12, 2020  Office of  Personnel
Management (OPM) Personal Subject Interview (PSI); his April 23, 2020 and December
27, 2020 credit reports; and his March 15, 2021 SOR Answer. (GE 1 – 4; SOR Answer)
Applicant  was  alerted  to  the  Government’s  concerns  regarding  his failure  to  file
his Federal income tax returns, his delinquent taxes owed to the Federal Government,
and his other debts during his May 12, 2020 OPM PSI, and also when he received his
February  2021  SOR  and  his  DOHA  Interrogatories.  (SOR;  GE  2)  [Note  –  Throughout
his  testimony,  Applicant  was  frequently  unsure  or  confused  which  of  his  exhibits
mitigated a particular debt. To add some clarity to the confusion that occurred during the
hearing,  I  generally  gave  greater  weight  to  Applicant’s  post-hearing  matrix  (AE  FF)
when attempting to match a mitigating document with a particular SOR debt.]
SOR ¶ 1.a: Failed to file Federal income tax returns for tax year 2013.
SOR Answer – I admit with clarification. I did initially fail to file tax returns for this
year. However, I am working with the IRS to determine the status of this year’s taxes, as
I was still married to my ex-wife during that year.
At  his  hearing,  Applicant  stated   that  his  ex-wife   did  not   cooperate   with   him   by
failing   to   provide   documents  needed   to   file   their   joint   Federal  income   tax   returns.  (Tr.
21) Applicant  stated  that he  has since  filed  his 2013  Federal income  tax   return and  “it
should  be   with   the   IRS.”  He  further  stated   that  it  has  been   difficult  for  him   to   get  tax
transcripts from  the  IRS. (Tr.  22-25)  However, Applicant was uncertain when  he  mailed
his 2013 tax return to the IRS stating that, “it was within the last year (2022).” (Tr. 41-47)
Post-hearing, Applicant again represented  that he  filed  his 2013  Federal income  return.
However, his post-hearing  documents  did  not contain documentation  of such  filing. (AE
FF)  ALLEGATION NOT RESOLVED.
SOR  ¶  1.b:  Failed  to  file  Federal  income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2016,
2017, and 2018.
SOR Answer – I admit with clarification. I did initially fail to file these tax returns.
For a period after my divorce, I was unable to get information from my ex-wife regarding
our filing status and back  debt. As  a result of  our divorce,  I  was made  responsible for
the back taxes, and was waiting to file until I could determine the status of those filings
and  back  taxes.  The  returns for all  these  years  have  since  been  submitted  along  with
my 2019 filing. I expect my back tax debt to be resolved.
At  his  hearing,  Applicant  stated  that  he  filed  his  2016,  2017,  and  2018  Federal
income  tax  returns.  (Tr.  25)  His  SOR  Answer  contained  copies  of  those  returns.
However, those returns are not signed or dated, and there is no evidence from the IRS
that  they  were  submitted  to  or  received  by  the  IRS.  (Tr.  25;  AE  C,  AE  D,  AE  E)
Applicant  also  stated  that  he  did  not  “really  have  a  reason”  for  not  timely  filing  his
income tax returns and was unsure of the date he mailed those returns to the IRS. (Tr.
48-54)  Post-hearing, Applicant  submitted  three  letters from  the  IRS  all dated  June  29,
2022  indicating  that  they  received  a  June  29,  2022  request  from  Applicant  for
verification  for  non-filing  of  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2018,  2020,  and  2021.  The  IRS
letters stated, “As of the date this letter, we have no record of a processed tax return for
the tax period listed above.” (AE HH) ALLEGATION NOT RESOLVED.
In  response  to  Department  Counsel’s  questions,  Applicant  stated  that  he  timely
filed  his  2020  and  his  2021  Federal  income  tax  returns.  He  did  not  recall  what  his
adjusted gross income was for either year. He received bonuses since 2019, but could
not  recall  how  much  he  received.  (Tr.  79-80)  He  did  not  know  much  he  had  in  his
checking or savings account or in his 401k account. (Tr. 80-81)
SOR  1.c –  Indebted to the  Federal Government for  delinquent taxes in  the
amount  of  $9,503  for  tax  year  2012.  This  tax  obligation  remained  unpaid  until
2020.
SOR Answer – I admit with clarification. See response to 1.b.
At his hearing, Applicant stated this debt would be completely settled with all the
taxes he filed with the IRS, and that he will be owed a refund. Applicant submitted a “tax
spreadsheet”  that  breaks  down  the  tax  years from  2013  to  2021  with  a  corresponding
column  that  indicates  the  amount  of  taxes  he  owes  or  the  refund  he  will  receive.
According to his calculations, his total refunds will total $7,153. He plans to pay as many
debts  as  he  can  with  that  refund.  (Tr.  25-26;  AE  Z)  Applicant  also  testified  that  he
entered  into  an  installment  agreement  with  the  IRS  in  April  2013  and  stopped  making
payments  in  February  2014  because  of  his  obligation  to  provide  spousal  and  child
support  to  his  estranged  wife  and  maintain  a  separate  household  for  himself.  He  also
stated that this debt would be settled with refunds due him from the Federal income tax
returns that he filed, discussed above. (Tr. 54-56) I take administrative notice of the fact
that  IRS  tax  refunds  are  usually  transferred  to  address  delinquent  federal  income  tax
debts. However, when a tax return is not filed within three years of its due date, the IRS
does not pay a refund. IRS website, “Don’t Lose Your Refund by Not Filing,” available at
https://www.irs.gov/individuals/dont-lose-your-refund-by-not-filing.  Applicant  did  not
submit any documentation from the IRS during his hearing or post-hearing to document
that this IRS debt was paid or being paid. (AE FF) ALLEGATION NOT RESOLVED.
Additionally,  Applicant’s  SOR  alleged  12  delinquent  commercial  accounts,
discussed below.
SOR ¶ 1.d – Collection gas company account in the amount of $13.
SOR  Answer   –   I   admit  with   clarification.  During   my   divorce  it  was  determined
that   I   would  be   responsible   for  the   debt   from   the   marriage.  I   also   at   this   time   accrued
around  $15,000  in  attorney’s  fees and  lost the  medical insurance  I  had  through  my  ex-
wife’s  policy.  I  have   more  recently   become   the   majority   provider  for  my   household  as
my  current spouse  lost  her employment and we  gained  full-time  custody  of  my  youngest
child. Most of  the  debts listed  here are  the  result of  my  divorce,  and  I am  in the  process
of resolving by making payments and arranging settlements/payment plans.
At  his  hearing,  Applicant  acknowledged  that  this  account  has  been  delinquent
since 2016. He stated that this debt “was paid yesterday” and that he would send proof
of payment post-hearing. He further stated, “I’ve  got a  receipt  right in front of me  that I
can  provide.”  [Note  –  this  was  a  TEAMS  hearing.]  Post-hearing,  Applicant  did  not
submit  any  documentation  of  payment.  (Tr. 26-28,  56-57,  77-79;  GE  4;  AE  FF)  DEBT
NOT  RESOLVED;  however,  a  $13  debt  does  not  raise  a  major  security  concern
aside from the carelessness for legitimate obligations it demonstrates.
SOR ¶ 1.e – Collection credit card account in the amount of $2,143.
SOR Answer – I admit with clarification. See response to 1.d.
At his hearing, Applicant acknowledged that he opened this account in 2017, and

FF) DEBT NOT RESOLVED.

RESOLVED.

SOR Answer – I admit with clarification. See response to 1.d.
At  his  hearing,  Applicant  stated  that  he  has  not  paid  this  debt  nor  is  it  in  a

SOR Answer –  I deny. I have recently gotten full custody of my youngest child.
Over the course of the hearings regarding custody, a stop order was put in place for the

child support and currently receive $100 a month.
At his hearing, Applicant reiterated what he claimed in his SOR Answer, adding
that he gained custody of his daughter in May 2021 and that his pay was garnished at a
rate  of  $1,000  per  month  from  May  2019  to  September  2019  for  child  support,  which
resulted in him overpaying his child support. He stated that he was awarded $1,000 in
back  child  support  by  his  former  spouse.  Based  on  his  SOR  Answer  and  explanation
provided  during  his  hearing,  this  debt  is  resolved.  (Tr.  33;  71-7;  GE  1,  p.  44;  AE  FF)
DEBT RESOLVED.
Applicant  identified  his  past  divorces  and  ongoing  divorce  as  circumstances
beyond his control. He incurred attorney fees for all of his divorces. He stated that his
second wife had two periods of unemployment, but was unsure of the dates. He added
that  his  third  wife  was  unemployed  for  “almost  nine  months.”  This  loss  of  income
adversely  affected  his  ability  to  remain  current  on  his  bills.  Additionally,  his  third  wife
had two back surgeries and he was responsible for paying the deductibles, which were
$2,500  and  $1,200,  respectively.  His  third  wife  also  had  an  automobile  accident  that
totaled her car. Applicant had to come up with a down payment for a new car and “work
with the insurance company to get . . . the vehicle paid off.” (Tr. 33-36; AE O)
Applicant  participated  in  financial  counseling and  stated  that  he  learned  how to
manage  his  money  better,  the  importance  of  paying  his  bills,  and  getting  his  financial
affairs in order. Applicant submitted a copy of  an  agreement with his credit counseling
service  dated  May  18,  2022.  (Tr.  36-37,  81;  AE  T)  His  take-home  salary  is
approximately $5,800 a month. Out of that, he is required to provide spousal support to
his  third  wife  pending  their  divorce,  to  also  include  her  expenses,  which  are
approximately $2,200 a month. (Tr. 37-38) Applicant owns a 2001 Chevrolet Silverado
and a 1995 Ford, and he and his wife co-own a 2016 Chevrolet Silverado. (Tr. 81-83)
Applicant  stated  that  he  is able to  pay  his “current debts.”  (Tr. 83) According to
an  analysis  conducted  by  his  credit  counseling  service,  he  would  need  to  allocate
$1,020  to  their  program.  As  far  as  where  those  funds  would  come  from,  he  stated,  “I
have not gotten that figured out yet. I told them I would contact them at a later date.”(Tr.
83-84) Applicant is living in a manufactured home that he rents for $1,100 a month. (Tr.
87)  Post-hearing, Applicant submitted  a  budget,  which reflects  a  net  monthly  income  of
$5,889, and a  net monthly remainder of  $488.  (Tr. 37-38; AE  GG)

he reported observing an individual removing classified information from a secure area.
He knew that by reporting this individual to the authorities that he would have to take on
the individual’s workload. (Tr. 39-40)
Applicant  submitted  three  favorable  work  performance  reviews  for  years  2016,
2018, and 2020. (AE P, AE U) [Note – AE U is a duplicate of the performance reviews
previously  submitted  in  AE  P]  He  also  submitted  three  supportive  and  favorable
reference letters from his company vice president, assistant facility security officer, and
professional  services  consultant.  Additionally,  Applicant  submitted  a  letter  on  his  own
behalf. (AE Q, AE V) [Note –  AE V contained a duplicate letter from his company vice
president  previously  submitted  in  AE  P]  Applicant’s  resume  describes  his  current  job
responsibilities and work history in more detail, and his biography provides background
information  regarding  his  situation.  (AE W, AE  X)  Lastly,  he  submitted  three  pages  of
family photographs. (AE Y)
