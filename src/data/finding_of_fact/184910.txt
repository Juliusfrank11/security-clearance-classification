has been employed by a defense contractor since May 2021. She seeks a public trust

Applicant  graduated  from  high  school  in  1999.  She  received  an  LVN  certificate
after completing a 13-month course in 2012. (Tr. 14-15; GE 1) She married in 2000 and

Financial Considerations
Applicant’s  SOR  lists  six  allegations  under  this  concern.  These  allegations  are
established by her August 17, 2020 SF-86; her Office of Personnel Management (OPM)
background investigation conducted from September 21, 2020, to September 29, 2020,
and from November 18, 2020, to November 24, 2020, which contained her September
23, 2020, September 28, 2020, September 29, 2020, and November 23, 2020 Personal
Subject  Interviews  (PSI);  her  March  4,  2022  SOR  Answer;  her  August  20,  2020,  and
June 30, 2021 credit reports; and her hearing testimony. (GE 1 through 4; SOR Answer)
Applicant’s  financial difficulties  began “[a]round  the  end  of  2016”  by agreeing to
provide financial assistance in the form of four credit union loans, discussed below, on
behalf  of  her  former  boyfriend.  He  agreed  to  pay  her  back;  however,  he  ceased
repaying  her  after  making  a  “few  payments.”  She  terminated  her  relationship  with  her
former  boyfriend  in  2019.  (Tr.  19-24)  She  acknowledged  using  poor  judgment  by
repeatedly  incurring  debt  for  her  former  boyfriend.  (GE  2)  Applicant  was  initially
repaying these credit union loans until approximately early 2017 when she moved into a
new apartment  and did not have the financial means to repay these debts. (Tr. 24-25;
GE 2)
After  her  2020  OPM  PSI,  Applicant  made  intermittent  payments  on  her  credit
union debts in amounts of $50 to $100, which given her current living situation and level
of income, was the best she could do without overextending herself. (Tr. 25-30; GE 2)
On  June  6,  2022,  Applicant  entered  into  four  separate  “formal”  agreements  with  her
credit union to document that she was making a good-faith effort to repay the four loans
she made to help her former boyfriend. Before her formal agreement in June 2022, she
had already begun depositing money into her credit union account to repay these debts
since at least April 2022. (Tr. 24-27; AE C) Per her June 6, 2022 payment agreement
with her credit union, she had set aside funds to cover her first payment in June 2022.
Her total monthly payment per her agreement is $400 and she pays that by direct debit.
Since she began her current job, she has the income to repay her debts. (Tr. 30-31)

maintaining financial responsibility from this experience. (Tr. 36)
Character Evidence

worker,  and   her   fiancé.  Collectively,  these   letters  describe   Applicant  as  hardworking,
honest,   reliable,  trustworthy,  a  team   player,  family   oriented,  and   as   an   asset  to   her
employer.  The   authors  of   her   reference   letters   enthusiastically   support  her   application
for a  public trust position.  (Tr.37-38; AE K  –  AE M)
