Applicant  initially  denied  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a.  and  1.b.,  but
subsequently admitted all the allegations of the SOR with explanations. (TR at page 31
line  20  to  page  32  line  14.)  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,
exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  38-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed with the defense contractor since 2014.  (GX 1 at pages 7 and 15.) Applicant
was married in December of 2015, and has two children. (TR at page 20 line 17 to page
21 line 17, and GX 1 at page 21.)

Personal Conduct
1.a.,  2.a.  and  3.a.  Applicant  admits
inadvertently  viewed  child
pornography from about 2000~2013. Starting when he was about 16 years old until his
late  20s,  Applicant,  who  liked  “petite  girls,”  used  the  Thai  word  “dek”  for  “younger
person” in  his internet  pornographic searches. Often, he accidentally viewed photos of
underage girls. (TR at page 22 line 14 to page 28 line 25, and at page 40 line 2 to page
46 line 7.) Applicant has not viewed such images in nearly ten years.
that  he
A health care professional avers that applicant "would not have engaged in such
behaviors  had  he  not  stumbled  upon  the  images  while  viewing  Internet  pornography.”
(AppX  K  at  page  2.) This  Licensed  Clinical Social Worker  and  Certified  Sex  Addiction
Therapist  further  avers:  “based  on  my  assessment,  I  do  not  believe  that  there  is  any
sexual addiction present.” (Id.) Applicant’s spouse is aware of these allegations against
Applicant. (TR at page 13 line 10 to page 19 line 10.)
Applicant  has  signed  a  Letter  of  Intent  not  to  engage  in  such  conduct  in  the
future. (AppX N.)
1.b.  2.a.  and 3.a.  Applicant  admits  that he  paid  women  for sexual acts from about
2002~2015. These  acts  included   with   “prostitutes  in   Thailand   .   .  .   three   or four times,”
and   at   massage   parlors  in  both   Thailand   and   in  the   United   States.  The   last   such
conduct  occurred   in   2015,   seven   years  ago,  before  he   was  married,  at  “a   Bachelor
Party” in Las Vegas. (TR at page  29 line  1 to  page 30 line 17, at page 32 line 13 to  page
34   line   10,  and   at  page   46   line   8   to   page   52   line   12.)    Again,   Applicant’s  spouse   is
aware of these  allegations against Applicant. (TR at page  13  line 10  to page 19 line 10.)
Applicant  has  signed  a  Letter  of  Intent  not  to  engage  in  such  conduct  in  the
future. (AppX N.)
