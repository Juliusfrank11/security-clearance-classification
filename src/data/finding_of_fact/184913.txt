Applicant is 46 years old, divorced, and has two adult children. He is engaged to
remarry. Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1996 and served as a paramedic. He was
honorably discharged in 2005 due to a disability. Following his discharge, he worked as
a  civilian  for  the  Army,  then  for  the  U.S.  Navy,  and  at  a  later  date  for  the  Veterans
Administration  (VA).  He  was  not  earning  enough  money  to  support  his  family  so  he
decided to pursue an education. He earned a bachelor’s degree in October 2017 and a
master’s degree in September 2019. Applicant was unemployed from 2014 to 2019 while
he  was  attending  college  and  pursuing  his  post-graduate  degree.  He  paid  for  his
education with benefits from the VA. His benefits terminated upon his graduation. After
receiving his master’s degree, he was unemployed for an extended period due in part to
the COVID-19 pandemic. He began working in his current position with a Government
contractor in October 2020. He is seeking eligibility for a public trust position in connection
with his employment. (Answer at 1; Tr. at 15, 24-31; GE 1 at 10-15, 19-20, 22, 24-25.)
Guideline F, Financial Considerations
The Government alleged in this paragraph of the SOR that Applicant is ineligible
for  clearance  because  he  has  failed  to  meet  his  financial  obligations  and  is  therefore
potentially  unreliable,  untrustworthy,  or  at  risk  of  having  to  engage  in  illegal  acts  to
generate  funds.  The  SOR  sets  forth  12  allegations,  10  of  which  are  for  debts  totaling
approximately $72,000. In the Answer, he admitted 11 of the 12 allegations in the SOR
and denied one debt for $3,594  (SOR 1.f). He also submitted additional information in
support of his eligibility for a public trust position.
The status of the matters alleged in the SOR is as follows:
1.a  Debt charged off in the approximate amount of $25,074. Applicant opened this
unsecured loan account in March 2017 and defaulted on the account in about October
2019.  In  March  2022  Applicant  entered  into  a  payment  plan  with  the  attorney  for  the
creditor. Under the plan,  he  agreed  to  pay $150 per month.  He  provided  a document
evidencing the agreed-upon plan, and he is current on his payments. This debt is being
resolved. (Answer at 3; Tr. at 32-40; GE 2 at 4; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 8; AE I.)
1.b. Debt charged off in the approximate amount of $21,234. Applicant opened this
loan account in July 2018 to pay off some debt that accrued during the years he attended
college. He defaulted on the account in about January 2019. Applicant has since made
payment arrangements with the creditor and is repaying the loan. Since April 15, 2022,
he has made payments of $50 per month. When other debts have been paid off by the
end of  2022, he expects  to increase  his monthly payment  on  this debt.  He provided a
letter from  the  creditor confirming  that  this  debt  is  under  a  payment  plan.  This  debt  is
being resolved. (Answer at 3; Tr. at 40-42; GE 2 at 5; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 8; AE J.)
1.c Debt charged off in the approximate amount of $5,280. Applicant opened this
credit-card account in June 2015 with the same creditor as the debt alleged in SOR 1.a.
Applicant defaulted on paying this account in about May 2019. He negotiated a settlement
of  this  account  with  the  creditor.  He  understands  that  the  settlement  covers  the  loan
account  in  SOR  1.a  and  this  credit-card  account,  which  are  both  owed  to  the  same
creditor. This debt is being resolved. (Answer at 3; Tr. at 42-46; GE 2 at 10; GE 3 at 2;
GE 4 at 9; AE I.)
1.d  Debt placed for collection in the approximate amount of $4,993. This is a credit-
card  account  that  Applicant  was  unable  to  pay  after  the  completion  of  his  master’s
program in 2019. Applicant negotiated a settlement of this account. He credibly testified
that since March 2022 he has been making payments of $50 per month pursuant to an
agreed-upon payment plan.  He has been unable to obtain  a  confirming letter from the
collection agency handling this settlement. This debt is being resolved. (Answer at 3; Tr.
at 46-47; GE 2 at 3; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 9, 10.)
1.e  Debt  placed  for  collection  in  the  approximate  amount  of  $3,822.  Applicant
defaulted  on  this  credit-card  account  in  2019.  He  has  reached  a  settlement  with  the
collection  agency  and  has  been  making  payments  of  $100  per  month  since  February
2022. Under the payment plan, his last payment is due in April 2025.  Applicant provided
a  letter from  the collection agency confirming the terms of  the settlement.  This debt  is
being resolved. (Answer at 3; Tr. at 47-54, 59-60; GE 2 at 6; GE 3 at 3; GE 4 at 9; AE N.)
1.f.  Debt  placed  for  collection  in  the  approximate  amount  of  $3,594.  Applicant
disputes  this account.  Applicant  does  not  recognize  the  address  the  collection  agency
has  on  file  for  this  account.  Applicant  is  willing  to  pay  this  account  if  the  creditor  can
establish that it is his account. The Government’s evidence in the record establishes that
this account  is in  Applicant’s name,  but it  does  not  provide  any  address information,  which
is the  subject  of Applicant’s dispute.  The  creditor has not yet responded  to  Applicant’s
dispute. This debt is being  disputed.  (Answer at 3; Tr. at 54-57,  59-63; GE  2  at 4; GE  3
at 3; GE  4 at 9.)
1.g. Debt charged off in the  approximate  amount of  $3,121.  Applicant opened  this
credit-card account in January  2019  and  defaulted  on  paying  the  account in  about July
2019.  He   reached   a   settlement  with   the   creditor   and   paid   the   amount   of  $468   in  full
satisfaction  of this debt.  The  Government’s August 2022  credit report  in the  record  (GE
2) reflects that this debt has  been  paid.   This debt  has been  resolved. (Answer at 3; Tr.
at 57-59; GE  2 at 11; GE 3  at 3; GE 4  at 10.)
1.h. Debt placed for collection in the approximate amount of $674. Applicant has
reached a settlement of this account and is making payments pursuant to a payment plan.
Under the settlement, he  is paying $108 per month  by automatic withdrawals from  his
bank  account.  All  payments  under  this  payment  plan  were  scheduled  to  have  been
completed by October 2022. As of the hearing date, Applicant believes that he has fully
paid this debt. This debt has been resolved. (Answer at 3; Tr. at 63-65; GE 2 at 5; GE 3
at 3; AE M.)
1.i. Debt charged off in the approximate amount of $352. Applicant paid this credit-
card debt in full in February 2022 and provided substantiating documentation. This debt
has been resolved. (Answer at 3; Tr. at 65-66; GE 4 at 10; AE K; AE L.)
1.j.  Failure to timely file Federal tax returns for Tax Years (TYs) 2016, 2017, 2018,
and 2019. Applicant was a full-time student during the years when he failed to file Federal
returns.  He  had  no  income  to  report  to  the  IRS,  though  he  did  receive  VA  education
benefits,  specifically  benefits  under  the  Vocational  Rehabilitation  and  Employment
Program, which he received as a disabled veteran. Applicant’s VA education counselor
advised  him  that  these  benefits  are  not  taxable.  Other  tax  advisors  have  told  him  the
same  thing.  Applicant  never  received  a  tax  document  from  the  VA  indicating  that  the
benefits  he  received  were  taxable  or  that  the  VA  reported  the  benefits  to  the  IRS  as
income. I provided Department Counsel with the opportunity to supplement the record if
the Government concluded that Applicant’s VA benefits were taxable under U.S. tax law
and  therefore  he  failed  to  report  the  benefits  as  taxable  income  by  filing  tax  returns.
Department  Counsel  timely  responded  after  the  hearing  and  declined  to  submit  any
additional documentation or information in support of its allegations in SOR 1.j and 1.k.
Accordingly, the record evidence supports the conclusion that Applicant was not obligated
to file tax returns during the period TYs 2016 through 2019 because he had no taxable
income. Since Applicant began his current employment in 2020, he has filed his returns
for TYs 2020 and 2021. (Answer at 3; Tr. at 67-73; GE 6.)
1.k.  Failure to timely file state  income tax return for TYs 2016, 2017, 2018, and
2019. Applicant filed no state returns for these four years for the same reason he failed
to file his Federal returns in those years, i.e., he had no taxable income in those years.
See the discussion in SOR 1.j, above, for more detail. (Answer at 3; Tr. at 73.)
1.l.  Child-support  arrearage  in  the  approximate  amount  of  $4,000.  Applicant
became delinquent on his child-support obligations for a child he had with a woman other
than  his  ex-wife  or  his  fiancée.  This  child  is  now  six  years  old.  Applicant  is  presently
making monthly payments of $350 or more to the state to pay his child support and the
arrearage. He credibly testified that he is making this payment every month.  As of  the
date of the Answer, March 29, 2022, Applicant had reduced the arrearage to $879. He
referenced in his Answer a letter evidencing the reduced debt amount, but he failed to
submit  it  with  his  Answer.  I  left  the  record  open  for  one  week  to  give  Applicant  the
opportunity  to  supplement  the  record,  if  he  chose  to  do  so.  He  made  no  further
submission. This debt is being resolved. (Answer at 3; Tr. at 73-78.)
Mitigation  and Whole-Person Evidence
Applicant submitted 11 character-reference letters. They all praised Applicant as a
hard-working  employee  who  was  proud  of  his  many  years  of  service  to  the  U.S
Government  in the  Army,  as a  civilian  employee,  and now as  a contractor. They have
confidence that Applicant will continue to resolve his financial obligations. (AE A through
H, P.)
