Applicant is 49 years old, married and has no children. He graduated from high
school in 1992. He owned a tow-truck business for a number of years. He did well until
the market in which he conducted business became too saturated with competitor tow-
truck  drivers.  He  closed  his  business  and  began  working  for  a  U.S.  Government
contractor in June 2020 as a maintenance technician. He is a first-time applicant for a
security clearance. (Tr. at 20-23, 37-39; GE 1 at 8, 12-19, 21-23.)
Guideline F, Financial Considerations
The Government alleged in this paragraph of the SOR that Applicant is ineligible
for  clearance  because  he  has  failed  to  meet  his  financial  obligations  and  is  therefore
potentially  unreliable,  untrustworthy,  or  at  risk  of  having  to  engage  in  illegal  acts  to
generate funds. The Government alleged that Applicant had failed to pay his Federal tax
liabilities for tax years (TYs) 2016, 2017, and 2018 (SOR 1.a). He owes  approximately
$90,908 in delinquent taxes. The SOR sets forth a second allegation stating that Applicant
is indebted to his local tax authority in the approximate amount of $2,028 for delinquent
taxes for TYs 2016 through 2021.  In the Answer, Applicant admitted both allegations.
The current status of the debts alleged in the SOR is as follows:
1.a   Failure  to  pay  Federal  tax  in  the  approximate  amount  of  $90,908.  While
operating  his  tow-truck  business,  Applicant  fell  behind  in  tax  year  (TY)  2016  on  his
Federal  taxes  related  to  his  business.  He  acknowledges  that  he  tried  to  ignore  the
problem, but his tax debts did not go away. Over the subsequent two years, his delinquent
tax debt increased to at least $90,000 because he was not paying any withholding taxes
or quarterly payments on his income from his business. As a first-time business owner,
he claims that he did not know what he was doing when it came to his tax responsibilities.
In 2020 he hired a tax consultant who negotiated with the IRS an expensive payment plan
to pay the delinquent taxes monthly over a number of years. Applicant was dissatisfied
that his advisor did not seek a compromise of the debt that would lower his tax debt. He
has not done anything since terminating his relationship with his tax advisor beyond some
general research on the process for making an offer in compromise settlement with the
IRS. Applicant wants to contact the IRS and seek a settlement in compromise that he can
afford.
Applicant and his wife together earn $200,000, but they live in an area with high
living  costs.  They  live  paycheck-to-paycheck  and  have  little  left  over  after  paying  their
monthly expenses and debts. Applicant’s debts include monthly payments of about $700
due on a new vehicle he purchased in 2020 and payments on a loan used to purchase a
camping trailer. Applicant and his wife are increasing their credit-cards debts to pay their
living and very high commuting expenses. Applicant recognizes that he has “to step up
and dig [himself] out of this hole.” With his wife’s income and expenses, their net monthly
income after all expenses gives them insufficient funds to make any significant payment
on  Applicant’s delinquent taxes.  (Tr. at 23-24, 37-40, 49-50, 53, 57-59; GE 1 at 32-33;
GE 2 at 3-8; GE 4 at 3; AE A.)
The  IRS  diverted  a  recent  Federal  tax  refund  for  $11,748  to  pay  down  taxes
Applicant owes for TY 2016. His bookkeeper filed for an extension for the filing of his TY
2021 tax returns. As of the hearing date, he was late in filing the tax return. He recognizes
that he has to complete and file the return.  He believes he has overpaid his taxes and
would receive a refund if he did not have a debt to the IRS for back taxes. As an employee,
he has withholding taken out of every paycheck and does not expect to have increased
tax problems in the future. Applicant’s delinquent Federal income tax debt has not been
resolved. (Tr. at 34, 41-43, 59; AE C.)
1.b  Failure to pay local taxes for TY 2016 through 2021 in the amount of about
$2,028. Applicant asserts that he paid this debt in late 2021. After the hearing he provided
documentary proof of payment. He may owe a small amount of current taxes, but he is
not delinquent on these taxes at this time. This debt is resolved. (Tr. at 25-34; GE 2 at 11;
AE C.)
