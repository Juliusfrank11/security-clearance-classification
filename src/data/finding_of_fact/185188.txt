In Applicant’s  answer to the SOR, she admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c, with
brief explanations and a narrative statement. Her admissions are included in the findings
of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant is 42 years old. She and her prior husband were married from 2007 until
they divorced in 2018. She has two children with him, ages 16 and 14, and one additional
child, age 18, through a prior relationship. (GE 1; Tr. 42-43) Applicant and her children
now live with her mother and sister. (Tr. 88)
Applicant has  a  high  school diploma.  She  has held her job  for 15  years, since  2008.
She  works as a  contractor for another department of  the  Federal government.  She  works
full  time  and  earns  about  $60,000  annually. She  has  held  a  prior clearance. (Tr.  10, 45-
46; GE 1)
The  SOR  concerns  three  alleged  delinquent  debts,  discussed  below.  Applicant
discussed  her  debts  freely  in  her  background  interview,  and  she  provided  supporting
documentation about some of her debts for the interviewing agent. (GE 2a, GE 2b) They
are also established by her admissions, statements in her answer, and by an April 2021
credit report. (GE 3)
SOR ¶ 1.a ($38,680) is a debt that has been charged off by a credit union. (GE 2b;
AE C) Applicant explained that the debt is a joint account between her and her former
husband, regarding two vehicles that they purchased together while they were married.
They fell behind on the car payments in about 2016, during their period of separation, and
the cars were voluntarily repossessed. The alleged amount is what remains after resale.
(Tr. 34-40, 66-68; GE 2a at 3; GE 2b)
Applicant testified that she contacted the creditor to propose a settlement several
years ago, without success, since she could not afford what they offered. This was when
she had to move following the  marital separation. Her funds went towards moving and
finding a home for herself and her children, and she could not address her debts until her
situation  stabilized.  Her  then  husband  was  also  unhelpful.  Since  the  vehicles  were
financed jointly, she could not settle her auto account alone. (Tr. 48-49, 67-68, 75-76)
Applicant provided a January 2022 letter, addressed solely to Applicant’s former
husband, referencing a repayment agreement under which he is to pay $380 per month
for 101 months, with the final payment in April 2030. (AE A) She testified that he is making
payments to resolve the debt. She has no documentation from him because they are not
on speaking terms. She said that she has asked the creditor to inform her of any issues
with his payments. In that event, she would assume the payments, though she has no
documentation from the creditor to document such an arrangement. She said her former
husband  told  her  that  he  was  advised  during  his  own  security  clearance  application
process  that  he  has  to  take  care  of  the  debt  and  is  doing  so.  (Tr.  37-42,  46-50)  She
agreed,  though,  that  “half  of  it  is  mine.”  (Tr.  69-71)  She  believes  he  is  a  government
contractor but does not know where he works. (Tr. 85-86, 89)
AE B is an excerpt from an October 2022 credit report for Applicant showing she
is a co-signer on the account. Several monthly payments of $631 are indicated in early
2021, $0 paid in April 2021, and $18,048 paid in May 2021. Yet the balance is now listed
as $35,636. The last payment, of $300, was made on September 30, 2022. (AE B; Tr. 26)
Applicant’s husband has sometimes paid less than what is owed on the account. (Tr. 49)
The  debt  is  being  resolved  by  Applicant’s  former  husband,  pursuant  to  a  documented
agreement with the creditor.
SOR ¶ 1.b ($1,209) is an account placed for collection by a utility company.  The
debt is about 8 or 10 years old, and is an account related to Applicant’s marital home,
which she left in 2016. She believes she brought the account current before she left. She
documented that the account was deleted from her credit report. (GE 3; AE D; Tr. 27-28,
31, 50-55, 65, 74-75)
SOR ¶ 1.c ($507) is a retail credit-card account placed for collection by a bank.
(GE 2b) Applicant indicated in her Answer that she had arranged to settle the account.
(Answer) She said in her testimony that she settled the account for about $200 about five
months before the hearing. She was unable to provide documentation of the payment,
but  said  she  would  repay  the  debt  if  needed.  She  said  a  recent  flood  in  her  home
destroyed any paperwork she might have had. (Tr. 32-34, 55-58, 84-85)
Applicant explained that her divorce precipitated her financial issues because her
former husband stopped making payments on their accounts, without caring about the
impact on her finances. She has taken care of her own finances since the divorce, and
has had no financial issues since then. She has had her job for 15 years, and this is the
first financial issue she has had. She knows her finances impact her job and needs the
job to provide for her children. She will do what it takes to resolve her debts. (Tr. 44; GE
4 at 6)
Applicant  provided  a  personal  financial  statement  (PFS)  with  her  interrogatory
response  in  March  2021.  It  shows  net  monthly  income  of  about  $3,330  and  monthly
expenses of about $2,620, leaving a net surplus of about $710. (GE 4 at 7) She testified
that her monthly income has since increased, to about $3,522, though her savings in the
bank have decreased by a few hundred dollars. She sends money to her daughter who
is in college. (Tr. 59-61) She has not participated in credit counseling. (Tr. 64) Her tax
filings are up to date. (Tr. 64)
Applicant’s former husband is supposed to pay her $619 a month in child support.
He has not done so in six months, but she was just notified that his wages will soon to be
garnished to address it. (Tr. 43, 72-73, 86-87)
Applicant submitted  an  additional statement  after her hearing. She  said  she  wished
she  “could  have  done  things differently” during  her separation  and  divorce.  Her aim  was
being  there  for her children  as a  parent  and  keeping  her life  from  falling  apart. She  enjoys
her  job,   which  has  been   a   big   part  of   keeping   things  together  as  a   family.  Losing   her
former husband’s income  was difficult,  since  he  was the  primary  “bread  winner.”  She  has
moved back in with her mother to help with the bills. She intended to do a better job of
addressing her debts but  was  not  able  to  do  so  in  a more  reasonable  timeframe.  She
intends  to work towards  resolving her debts,  and  she needs  her job  to  provide for her
children. (AE E)
Applicant’s project manager attests that she has been an integral part of the team
since 2008. She is reliable, detail-oriented, and hard working. She has a positive attitude
and is a willing team player. A close friend of 30 years attests that Applicant is a loyal,
giving, and caring friend and a devoted mother. She works hard to provide for her family.
She is honest and dedicated and would not do anything to jeopardize her job. She has
regained financial stability and is working hard to maintain it. (AE J – AE M) In her annual
work  appraisals  from  2018-2021,  she  is  chiefly  rated  from  Good  to  Excellent  to
Outstanding in her various evaluation criteria. (AE F-AE I)
