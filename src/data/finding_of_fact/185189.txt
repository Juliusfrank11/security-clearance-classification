Applicant  admitted  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.e.  He  denied  the
allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.b  through  1.d,  1.f  through  1.i,  and  2.a.  After  a  thorough  and
careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of
fact.
Applicant is 52 years old. He is a high school graduate and earned some college
credits, but not a degree. He served in the military from January 1989 to March 1990 and
received an honorable discharge. Applicant married in Turkey in 2000. His wife is a dual
citizen of Turkey and the United States. They have two children, ages 21 and  19 years
old. (Item 2)
In his March 2021 security clearance application (SCA), Applicant did not disclose
any periods of unemployment. He worked for a federal contractor from 2009 to 2018. He
left his job for a new opportunity. He worked for a different federal contractor from January
2019  to  September  2019,  and  was  laid  off  when  his  department  was  eliminated.  He
worked  for  different  employers  from  September  2019,  including  a  period  of  self-
employment from March 2020 to June 2020, until his present employment in December
2020. (Item 2)
In Applicant’s SCA, he disclosed that he had not filed his 2018 federal income tax
return because his accountant was amending his return. He stated he owed $4,000, but
the amendment would show he did not owe a balance. He said he was working with his
accountant. He also disclosed in his SCA that he had not filed his 2019 federal tax return
and was working with his accountant to file that tax return. He stated, “We have currently
hired [CE] and they are in the process of submitting our 2019 tax return and also will be
amending  my  2018  tax  return.”  He  provided  no explanation for his failure to timely file
either return. (Item 2)
Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator in April 2021. He told the
investigator that he had been late filing his federal income tax returns for tax years 2018
and 2019. He said he contacted the IRS and had been granted extensions for both tax
years. He said he did not owe taxes for either year and would receive a refund. (Item 3)
In Applicant’s April 2022 answer to the SOR, he said, “all taxes are being filed to
date, currently 2020 and 2021 and are expected to be completed by our CPA by June 1,
2022.” (Item 1) He said he had requested extensions at the appropriate time, and he was
waiting for his accountant to complete his paperwork to file the tax returns. He said he did
not owe taxes. He said  his accountant informed him  that there was a backlog of  2020
filings and his tax returns would be completed by June 1, 2022. He said he was told his
2020 tax returns would be filed by then and his 2021 return would follow shortly thereafter.
He  believed  he  would  receive  a  refund.  He  said  he  would  continue  to  work  with  his
accountant to ensure timely filing. (Item 1)
In the FORM, Applicant was put on notice as to what documents were required to
substantiate his claims about his tax returns. In  Applicant’s response  to  the  FORM,  he
did not say anything about his delinquent tax returns. Applicant did not provide a copy of
his 2018 federal tax return that he said was being amended,  which  presumably  would
have been filed if he was requesting it be amended. He did not provide documentation to
show he  had  timely filed  for extensions for tax  years  2018,  2019, or  2020.  He  did  not
provide copies of filed tax returns for 2018, 2019, and 2020, or any documentation from
his accountant. He did not provide an explanation for his failure to timely file for the three
tax years. (AE A)
The   SOR  alleges  eight   delinquent  debts  (SOR   ¶¶  1.b   through   1.i).  They   are
corroborated   by   Applicant’s  admissions   in  his  SCA,   statements  to   the   government
investigator,  and   a   March  2021   credit  bureau   report.  Applicant  provided   proof  that  the
collection   account  in  SOR  ¶  1.b   ($2,424)  was  settled   for  $1,940   in  February   2022.
Applicant  provided   a   copy   of  the   page   from   his  credit  report  showing   this  debt.   The
complete credit report was not provided. (AE  B, C)
In  Applicant’s  SCA,  he  disclosed  the  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.e  ($4,735),  1.f
($7,389),  1.g  ($4,431), 1.h  ($3,654), and  1.i  ($3,532).  He  stated  they  were  credit  card
debts that he fell behind on paying. The same collection company holds the debts in SOR
¶¶ 1.g, 1.h and 1.f. He said he contacted the collection company and it was unwilling to
accept a reduced payment. He was going to contact an attorney to assist him.  He also
disclosed the debt in SOR ¶ 1.e ($4,735) and said it was a credit card debt now owned
by a collection company. He had contacted the company to settle the debt. He said the
debt owed in SOR ¶ 1.i ($3,532), also a credit card debt held by a collection company,
was  not  owed  to  the  creditor  and  would  be  dismissed  in  court.  No  documentation
regarding any of the debts was provided. (Item 2)
In his April 2021 background interview, Applicant explained that he incurred credit
card debts for moving expenses in 2015, when he moved to a different state and his wife
was not working. He acknowledged to the investigator that he owed the debts in SOR ¶¶
1.f, 1.g and 1.h and they were not being paid. He stated  that in 2019, he purchased a
boat for $35,000 and as he was driving it to his residence the engine failed. He sold the
boat later in 2019 for $13,000. He also stated that during this time he was building a new
home. He told the investigator that he would not pay certain debts owed to the collection
company as alleged in SOR until they accepted his offer to pay a lesser amount.
Applicant stated in his SOR answer that he paid the debts in SOR ¶¶1.c ($65), 1.d
($319),  1.f,  1.g,  1.h  and  1.i,  and  they  were  removed  from  his credit  report.  He  did  not
provide documents to show he paid these debts and they were removed from his credit
report.  Regarding  the  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.e,  he  stated  that  he  had  reached  a  payment
arrangement with the creditor and the debt would be resolved by May 2022. He did not
provide proof the debt was paid. (Item 1)
Applicant  disclosed  in  his  SCA  that  he  and  his  family  took  cruises  in  2017  and
2018.  He  stated,  “We  may  have  outstanding  debt  but  I  have  more  than  $300,000  in
investments waiting for them to mature and previous debt to be settled.” Applicant did not
elaborate on his investments. (Item 1)
Applicant  stated  in his SOR answer “All  noted  previous collections will  be  paid and
satisfied  by  May  2022.  (Item  1)  He  further stated,  “All  taxes are being  filed  to  date  and
currently  2020  and  2021  are expected  to  be  completed  by  our CPA  by  June  1st ,  2022.”
(Item 1)  He stated  he had put measures  such  as budgeting, investing  and  savings plans
in place  to  prevent any  future problems. He had  investments that provided  a  significant
cushion. He  stated,  “Regardless money  is no  longer a  concern considering  the  available
funds  to  date  and  [incoming] capital from  the  sale  of our house  that will provide  $160K
over what is owed  on  the  mortgage.”  No substantiating  documents were provided. (Item
1)
Applicant stated in his response to the FORM, “During 2019 and into 2020, we had
some unexpected expenses and life events, while the debts added up to an unsustainable
amount.” He further stated that he had always planned  to pay his debts sooner, but he
had extra expenses for his daughter who was attending college and his move. He said
the pandemic also affected him. He said he was investing and saving money.
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant’s  mother-in-law  is  a  dual  citizen  of  the  United
States and Turkey and resides in Turkey. Applicant stated in his SOR answer that his
mother-in-law is a permanent resident of the United States and holds a green card. She
is a citizen of Turkey. He disclosed in his SCA that prior to the pandemic, she would live
with  them  in  the  United  States  for  most  of  the  year  and  said  during  his  background
interview that she lived with them for two to six months a year, but due to the pandemic,
she  had  not  been  to  the  U.S.  since  2020.  Prior  to  her  retirement,  she  worked  in  the
financial world and was not affiliated with any government entity. She was divorced from
her husband. Applicant stated that she is close with her grandchildren, who were born in
and are loyal to the United States, and would never put them in jeopardy or at risk.
