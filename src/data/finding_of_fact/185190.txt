Applicant is 51 years old. He earned a General Education Diploma in 1989. He is
not married, but cohabitated with the same partner from 1994 until at least 2021. He has
two children (ages 18 and 27). He has been employed as a maintenance worker since
July  2021,  and  has  held  various  positions  including  laborer  and  truck  driver.  He  was
unemployed for approximately three months in 2017. (Items 1, 2)
The SOR alleges eight delinquent debts, totaling approximately $22,318. Applicant
admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.f, and 1.h with explanations. He denied
the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.g, claiming that he had resolved that debt. (Item 1)
The evidence concerning debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below.
SOR  ¶  1.a:  credit  account  charged  off  for  $9,278.  Applicant  admitted  the
allegation.  He  reported  opening  the  account  in  November  2019  to  finance  a  $7,200
motorcycle/gear purchase. He voluntarily surrendered the motorcycle in March 2021, and
understood  he  was  responsible  for  any  deficiency  balance  following  sale  of  the
motorcycle at auction. He also reported that there had been no communications from the
creditor  since  he  returned  the  motorcycle  and  that  there  had  been  no  settlement
negotiations. The September 2021 credit report reflects the account as charged off with
a  $9,278  balance.  The  May  2022  credit  report  reflects  the  debt  as  charged  off  with  a
$9,278 balance and $7,650 past due. This debt is not resolved. (Item 1, Item 3 at 7-8,
Item 4 at 2, Item 5 at 3)
SOR ¶ 1.b: credit card account charged off for $4,634. Applicant admitted the
allegation. He reported the account became delinquent in early 2019 and did not recall
other account details. September 2021 and May 2022 credit reports reflect the account
as charged off with a $4,634 balance. In October 2019, a $4,634 “Civil Judgment”  was
entered against Applicant. This debt is not resolved. (Item 1, Item 3 at 4, 5, 7, Item 4 at
3, Item 5 at 5; Item 6 at 2)
SOR ¶1.c: credit card account charged off for $3,075. Applicant admitted the
allegation. He reported the account became delinquent in approximately April 2017, and
that  there  had  been  no  settlement  negotiations.  The  September  2021  and  May  2022
credit reports reflect the account as charged off with a $3,075 balance. This debt is not
resolved. (Item 1, Item 3 at 4, 7, Item 4 at 3, Item 5 at 5)
SOR ¶1.d: credit card account charged off for $2,212. Applicant admitted the
allegation. In September 2021, he reported the account delinquent in early 2019, that he
entered a payment plan in March 2021, and had made the agreed upon ($24) monthly
payments since. The September 2021 credit report reflects the account as charged off
with a $2,212 balance. The May 2022 credit report reflects the account as charged off
with a $1,953 balance. This debt is being resolved. (Item 1, Item 3 at 5, 7, Item 4 at 3,
Item 5 at 4)
SOR ¶1.e: collection account for $1,362. Applicant admitted the allegation, but
provided no additional details. The September 2021 credit report reflects the account as
placed for collection with a $1,362 balance. The May 2022 credit report does not reflect
the account. This debt is not resolved. (Item 1, Item 3 at 7, Item 4 at 4)
SOR  ¶1.f:  collection  account  for  $663.  Applicant  admitted  the  allegation  and
reported the debt is for a retail credit account, but could provide no further details. The
September 2021 and May 2022 credit reports reflect the account as placed for collection
with a balance of $663. This debt is not resolved. (Item 1, Item 3 at 7, Item 4 at 4, Item 5
at 4)
SOR  ¶1.g:  collection  account  for  $636.  Applicant  denied  the  allegation  and
claimed  that  he  had  paid  this account.  He  submitted evidence  that  the  account  payoff
amount was $636.78 until March 15, 2022, but did not submit evidence that he had paid
or otherwise resolved the debt. He told the background investigator that he believed this
was  a  high  interest  rate  credit  card  account,  and  that  he  had  decided  not  to  pay  the
exorbitant  late  fees  assessed  after  he  missed  a  payment.  He  has  not  engaged  in
settlement  negotiations.  The  September  2021  and  May  2022  credit  reports  reflect  the
account as placed for collection with a $636 balance, and that the consumer disputes the
account  information.  In  May  2021,  a  “Small  Claims  Judgment”  was  entered  against
Applicant for $636, and listed the same creditor as alleged in the SOR. This debt is not
resolved. (Item 1 at 4-5, Item 3 at 6-7, Item 4 at 4, Item 5 at 6; Item 6 at 1)
SOR ¶1.h: collection account for $458. Applicant admitted the allegation, could
not recall the account details, and has not engaged in settlement negotiations. September
2021 and May 2022 credit reports reflect the account as placed for collection with a $458
balance. This debt is not resolved. (Item 1, Item 3 at 7, Item 4 at 4, Item 5 at 5)
In  a  September  2021  background  interview,  Applicant  attributed  his  financial
issues  to  unemployment,  underemployment,  being  the  sole  wage  earner  in  his  home,
family  expenses,  and  a  truck  payment  that  he  could  not  afford.  He  explained  that  he
purchased a truck in July 2017 for $27,000 and made required loan payments until early
2019. When he voluntarily returned the truck to the dealer the outstanding loan balance
exceeded  the  vehicle’s  value  by  $5,000,  and  he  depleted  his  savings  by  paying  the
deficiency balance and purchasing another vehicle. He said that his fiancé was disabled,
unable to work and received approximately $600 monthly compensation for her disability.
(Item 3 at 4-8)
Applicant reported retaining a law firm in 2019 to assist in consolidating credit card
debt, making three of the required $350 monthly payments, and then terminating those
payments because he could not afford them.  He stated his intent to file for bankruptcy
after  saving  enough  to  pay  the  required  costs.  He  said  that  he  was  timely  paying  his
current debts, and indicated his willingness to pay delinquent debts, but said that he could
not afford to do so. Applicant’s recent credit records reflect no accounts in collection or
charged off, except those alleged in the SOR. (Item 3 at 4-8, Item 4, Item 5)
In response to the SOR, Applicant stated that he had been solely responsible for
supporting his family of four over the past 28 years, that his long-term relationship with
his cohabitant had recently ended, and that he had sold his house. He noted his intent to
apply  proceeds  from  the  sale  of  his  home  to  his  debts  and  provided  documentary
evidence of a pending sale, but provided no documentary evidence the sale occurred. He
wrote  that  he  was  working  on  contacting  his  creditors  and  resolving  his  debts,
communicating  with  lawyers  in  an  effort  to  resolve  his  debts,  and  hoped  to  declare
bankruptcy soon. He stated that his employer recently increased his pay in recognition of
his  hard  work  and  loyalty,  and  provided  documentary  evidence  of  his  excellent  job
performance. He said that he would never jeopardize his family or job because of financial
difficulties. (Item 1 at 3-11)
