Applicant is a 52-year-old aircraft mechanic for a government contractor, employed
since 2018. In 2015, she was laid off from her job while her youngest son was living at
home. She supplemented her income with unemployment insurance and a lower-paying
job. She did not complete high school. She married in 1987 and divorced in 2005. She
again married in 2016 and divorced in 2018 after a short marriage in which she described
as a “horror of a marriage.” (Tr. 19) She has three adult children.
The  SOR  alleges  under  Guideline  F  that  Applicant  has  ten  delinquent  debts
including  loans,  a  mortgage,  legal  fees,  credit  cards,  a  medical  debt,  and  a  telephone
service account; all totaling over $25,000 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.j). Applicant admitted all of the
debts  with  some  explanations,  except  she  denied  a  small  credit  account  (SOR  ¶  1.j),
claiming  it  was  paid.  The  evidence  submitted  by  the  Government  supports  the  SOR
allegations. Applicant attributed her financial problems to being laid off in 2015 and her
divorce  in  2018.  She  struggled  financially  since  2015,  until  she  secured  a  well-paying
position with her current employer in 2018 where she earned almost twice her previous
job. (Tr. 24-28)
SOR ¶ 1.a is a personal loan that was originally a $30,000 auto loan in her son’s
name, for a vehicle for his use. She refinanced the loan in her name to help him, but could
not afford the payments after she was laid off. The car was sold in 2016, and the balance
was partially paid off. The loan was converted to a personal loan for $8,715. Applicant did
not make regular payments on the loan after 2016, and it was charged off. Applicant’s
son stopped paying on the loan after being laid off, and does not contribute to repayment
of  the  personal  loan.  In  October  2022,  Applicant  arranged  a  repayment  plan  with  the
creditor, and she started making $25 payments every two weeks, beginning November
4, 2022, in accordance with the agreement. (AE I) She testified that she has been faithfully
making the scheduled payments and restated in January 2023 that she would continue
payments as agreed. (AE A) This account is being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.b is a credit union line of credit collection account for $7,672. Applicant
used the loan for home repairs in about 2015. She initially made payments, but stopped
in 2016. She spoke with a credit union representative in 2019 and October 2022, who
demanded payment in full. She did not have the funds to pay the full debt. Based on her
testimony  and  post-hearing  submission  (AE  F),  it  appears  that  Applicant  was  able  to
arrange a payment plan in November 2022, whereby she would deposit $25 per month
into an account with the credit union for that purpose, and the credit union would apply it
toward the loan. (AE F) She noted in an email that she will continue to pay on this account.
(AE A) This account is being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.c is a past-due mortgage that incurred late fees totaling $3,214. Applicant
testified that she began making payments in October 2021 and is paying an extra $25 per
month toward her late fees. Her most recent credit report shows the mortgage is up to
date.
SOR ¶ 1.d is a credit union personal loan that has been charged off for $2,792.
Applicant testified that she was able to arrange a repayment plan about six months ago,
and began making $25 payments every two weeks, beginning about four to five months
ago. She provided a post-hearing document showing a payment of $25 on November 4,
2022, and a balance of $2,250 that shows a decreasing balance on the account. (AE G)
She  also  noted  in  an  email  that  she  will  continue  to  pay  on  this  account.  (AE  A)  This
account is being resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.e  is  a  telephone  account  debt  for  $766.  Applicant  claims  her  new
telephone carrier was to pay off this account when she switched, but failed to do so. She
disputed the account several years ago, and it is no longer reflected in her current credit
report.  In  her  post-hearing  submission,  Applicant  provided  a  receipt  from  a  collection
agent showing a payment of $213.14 on December 31, 2022, and a total amount paid on
the debt of $426.88. This amount was the full settlement agreement, and the collection
account was closed. (AE B and AE C) This debt is resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.f  is  an  attorney-fee  debt  for  $677.  Appellant  agreed  to  accept  an
attorney’s services to assert a claim for an unclaimed money account. She received about
$2,000 in 2016, but failed to pay the attorney’s fee. In her post-hearing submission, she
provided documentary evidence that she settled the account in December 2022, and paid
the debt in full. (AE B and AE D) This account is resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.g is a medical debt for $528. The medical debt resulted from a surgery in
2005. She testified that she has taken no action to resolve the debt, and did not submit
any post-hearing documents regarding the debt. In an email, she alluded to accounts in
which she had not received a  response to her calls. This was apparently one of those
accounts. The debt is no longer reflected on her most recent credit report, and standing
alone, does not give rise to a security concern.
SOR  ¶¶  1.h  and  1.i  are  charged-off  credit  accounts.  Applicant  testified  that  she
paid  the  accounts  after  she  answered  the  SOR.  In  her  post-hearing  submission,  she
provided evidence that these accounts were settled in full in March 2022 and March 2021,
respectively. (AE E, AE H, AE K, AE L) Both accounts are resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.j is a charged-off credit account for $414. Applicant testified that she paid
the account after she answered the SOR. In an email, she alluded to accounts in which
she had not received a response to her calls. (AE E) This was apparently one of those
accounts. The debt is no longer reflected on her most recent credit report. It appears to
have been resolved.
Applicant stated that she received financial counseling in 2019 from a credit repair
service. The counselor did not assist her with a budget, but she claims she currently has
a written budget. She has no savings and about $417 in checking accounts. She owns a
home valued at about $310,000, with a remaining mortgage balance of about $50,000.
She is preparing her home to eventually offer for lease or sale. She rents another home
for  $650  per  month.  She  has  about  $300  in  net  monthly  remainder.  She  contributes
toward her youngest son’s tuition and pays his car insurance.
