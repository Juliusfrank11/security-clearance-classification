Applicant is 52 years old. He served in the United States Navy from February 1992
to  February  2012,  was  honorably  discharged,  and  retired  as  an  E-6.  He  completed
extensive  training and  a  number of  schools while  serving in  the  Navy,  and  attended  a
technical school from March 2012 to October 2015, earning a certificate. He married in
January  1998,  and  that  marriage  was  annulled  in  January  2022.  He  has  four  adult
children, ages 30, 27, 24, and 19. He has been employed as an aircraft mechanic since
2016 and works for a federal contractor. He also operates a small repair business. He
held a security clearance while on active duty in the Navy. (GE 1; AE E; Tr. 38-47)
In his September 2018 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-
QIP), Applicant reported utilizing or seeking assistance from a credit counseling service
or similar resource to resolve financial difficulties. He noted that he “h[as] charge off’s that
are affecting my credit report adversely”, named a law firm that was assisting him, and
noted that he was “[d]isputing negative marks on [his] credit record.” (GE 1 at 38) He did
not identify specific delinquent accounts, and denied that, in the previous seven years, he
had any property voluntarily repossessed,  defaulted on any loan, had accounts turned
over for collection or charged off, and denied that he had been, or was then, over 120
days delinquent on any debt. (GE 1 at 38-39)
The SOR alleges eight delinquent debts, totaling approximately $41,843 including
an  auto  loan  charged  off  in  December  2017  in  the  approximate  amount  of  $32,918.
Applicant denied all allegations, noting that he had retained a law firm and that the debts
alleged at SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.e were not reflected in, or had been deleted from,
his credit report. (SOR Response)
Applicant  submitted  a January  2022  civil  judgment reflecting  that he  had  married
a  woman  in  January  1998, they  “had lived  as Husband  and  Wife  until  their  final separation
in May  2017  [and]  it  was later determined  that said marriage  was and  is void as  Wife  was
married  to  another man  at the  time  that the  parties marriage  occurred.” (AE  E; Tr. 108-
111)  The  judgment  dissolved  Applicant’s  marriage, and  ordered  him  to  pay  $308  monthly
in child  support until no  later than  November 2022, to  support the  parties’ then  minor child.
He attributed his  financial difficulties to maintaining two separate households (for himself
near his employment since  June  2017  and  his family  a few  hours away), fraudulent  debt
accrued  in  his name  through  identity  theft, annulment of his  marriage, his purported  wife’s
expenditures, and  her failure to  make  payments on  certain  bills. (Tr. 32-37,  49-50,  113-
116)
Applicant reported being the victim of identity theft from November 2020 to April
2021  to  local  police.  (AE  F)  He  alleged  that  five  named  credit-card  accounts  and  a
“Legacy  (NOI)”  account  had  been  fraudulently  opened  using  his  personal  information,
and that charges totaling $4,700  ($500, $700, $800, $900, $900, and $900) had been
made on those accounts. (AE F; Tr. 33-34) Those accounts do not correlate by creditor
name, account number, debt amount or otherwise with any delinquent debt alleged in the
SOR. Applicant testified that, in approximately 2020, he submitted another police report
alleging other accounts had been fraudulently opened with his personal information, that
he believed that report included some accounts alleged in the SOR, and that he would
submit that report after the hearing, but did not do so. (Tr. 62-66, 73-76) He did not inform
police that he suspected his purported wife used his identify to open accounts in his name,
and was unaware of any police action taken after he filed the reports. (Tr. 111-112; AE F)
Applicant  testified   that  from   approximately   2018   until  approximately   2021,   he
retained  a  law  firm  to  assist in repairing  his credit, and  paid them  approximately  $100  per
month. He said  that he  terminated  that relationship in  2021  because  he  was not satisfied
with  the  results and  had  worked  with  another credit repair  company  since. (Tr. 48-58, 95-
106)  He  said  the   current  credit  repair   company   was  working   to   resolve   approximately
$4,000  in  debt,  and  submitted  evidence  that he  paid  them  approximately  $110  monthly
from February to June  2022. (Tr. 56-58, 66, 85-86; AE B at 2, 6, 10, AE M at 2, 7)
Applicant  submitted  three  credit  reports  dated  May  11,  2022,  that  did  not
specifically reference any of the debts alleged in the SOR. Those credit reports reflected
that he was then current on all except  one account, a credit account delinquent in the
approximate amount of $442. (AE A)
The evidence concerning debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below.
SOR ¶  1.a:  vehicle  loan account  charged off for $32,918. A  September 2018
credit report  reflects  an  individual vehicle  loan  account was opened  in August 2016, past
due  in  the  amount  of  $35,963, and   charged  off  in  December 2017  for $32,918. (GE 2)
Applicant provided  extracts of  credit records  from  July  2021  reflecting  that  the  individual
account  was  opened   in  August  2016,  delinquent  in  December  2016,   charged   off   in
December 2017,  and  purchased  by  another creditor.  (AE  J  at  1-2, AE  K  at 2, AE  L  at  2-
3)  Applicant  denied   the   allegation   noting   that  he   had   retained   representation,  that  the
creditor alleged  in  the  SOR had  no  record  of  the  account,  and  that this account was  not
reflected  in his credit report. (SOR Response)
Applicant  testified  that  the  delinquent  account  was  a  loan  he  had  obtained  to
finance a new pickup truck in 2016, that the monthly payment on the loan was $700, that
when he started missing payments he asked his then spouse to make payments from a
joint  account  they  shared.  He  did  not  confirm  whether  she  made  any  payments,  but
discovered  the  account was delinquent, contacted  the creditor to  resolve  the  matter, and
was  told  the   debt  had   been   charged-off,   and   that   the   creditor   did   not   have   additional
information.  He voluntarily returned  the  vehicle  to  the  creditor in approximately  2019.  (Tr.
49-58,  95-106) He  confirmed  that  he  made  no  payments  to  the  creditor after the  debt  was
charged-off. (Tr. 98-99)  He said that  the  creditor provided  documentation  indicating  that
because  it  was such  an  old  loan  that he owed  nothing  and  that  “they  couldn’t  come  after
the  money  that was supposed  to  have  been  owed  for it.” (Tr. 51, 53;  AE  G) He  provided
a September 2021  letter titled  “Explanation  of Calculation  of Surplus or Deficiency” that
stated  “[t]his communication  is from  a  debt  collector [and] is an  attempt  to  collect  a  debt
and  any  information  will be  used  for  that purpose.” (AE  I) The  letter noted  that:  due  to  the
debt’s age  the  creditor would not sue  Applicant  or report payment or non-payment of the
debt to  a  credit bureau; the  amount owed  on  the  loan  after the  September 2021  sale of
the   vehicle   was  $32,014.48   plus  additional  costs  for  a   total  deficiency   balance   of
$33,285.23;  Applicant   was  liable  for  the   deficiency   balance,  and   that  the   creditor
demanded   payment   of   the  deficiency   balance.  (AE   I; Tr.   130-131)  He   submitted   credit
reports from  May  2022  that did not reflect  this debt or the  creditor alleged  in the  SOR.
(AE  A)  Applicant  provided  no  documentary  evidence  that  he  or a  credit repair  company
acting  in  his  behalf contacted  the  creditor,  made  payments  on,  attempted  to  resolve  or
otherwise resolved  this  debt.  This debt  is not  resolved.
SOR  ¶1.b:   collection  account   for  $2,660.   A  September  2018  credit  report
reflects the individual account was opened in 2015 and assigned for collection in August
2017, with an account balance of $2,660. Applicant denied the allegation noting that he
had retained representation, and that this account was “no  longer on my credit report.”
(SOR Response) He submitted credit reports from May 2022 that did not reflect this debt
or the creditor alleged in the SOR. (AE A) He testified that the account was “fraudulent”,
that he did not open the account, and that he believed someone, possibly his purported
wife, used his personal information to open the account. This account was not listed in
the April 2021 police report Applicant submitted identifying credit accounts he reported as
being fraudulently opened using his personal information. He provided no documentary
evidence that he or a credit repair company acting in his behalf  contacted the creditor,
disputed the debt, made payments on, or otherwise resolved the debt. This debt is not
resolved. (GE 2; AE A, F; Tr. 58-64)
SOR ¶1.c: collection account  for $2,429. A September 2018 credit report reflects
the individual account was assigned for collection in April 2018 with an account balance
of $2,429. Applicant denied the allegation noting that he had retained representation, and
that  this  account  “is  not  being  reflected  on  my  credit  report.”  (SOR  Response)  He
submitted credit reports from May 2022 that did not reflect this debt or the creditor alleged
in  the  SOR.  (AE  A)  He  testified  that  he  did  not  open  the  account  and  believed  his
purported spouse opened the account using his personal information. He said that he had
the first credit repair firm address the debt, because it was on his credit report, and that it
was not on the list of debts his current credit repair company was addressing. He provided
no documentary evidence that he or any entity acting in his behalf contacted the creditor,
disputed the debt, made payments on or otherwise resolved the debt.  This debt is not
resolved. (GE 2; Tr. 64-66)
SOR ¶1.d: joint contract collection account  for $1,290. The September 2018
credit report reflects the joint contract was assigned for collection in August 2016 with an
account balance of $1,290, and that the account was in dispute. (GE 2; AE H at 3, 10)
Applicant  denied  the  allegation  noting  that  he  had  retained  representation.  (SOR
Response)  He  submitted  credit  reports  from  May  2022  that  did  not  reflect  the  debt  or
creditor alleged in the SOR. (AE A) He testified that the debt was for undisclosed charges
from a property management company after he moved from a residence managed by that
company to a different residence in 2016. He said the management company retained
his  deposit,  that  this  debt  appeared  in  his  credit  report,  and  that  he  contacted  the
management company after receiving a collection letter approximately 10 months later.
He said that he asked for documentary evidence supporting the debt and received none,
so  he  disputed  the  debt  with  a  credit  bureau.  He  believed  his  first  credit  repair
representative  sent  letters  to  the  management  company,  but  did  not  have  any
documentation of their efforts. He did not know if any portion of his monthly payments to
that  credit  repair  company  was  applied  to  this  debt,  but  believed  the  debt  had  been
resolved. He acknowledged that he had not received notice from the creditor that the debt
was resolved. He provided no documentary evidence that he or any entity acting in his
behalf  contacted  the  creditor, made  payments  on or otherwise  resolved  the debt.  This
debt is not resolved.  (Tr. 66-72, 106)
SOR  ¶1.e:  collection   account   for  $1,259.  The  September  2018  credit  report
reflects the individual account was assigned for collection in May 2017 with an account
balance of $1,259, and that the account was in dispute. Applicant denied the allegation
noting that he had retained representation, and that “[a]s of October 26, 2020, this account
has been deleted.” (SOR Response) He submitted credit reports from May 2022 that did
not reflect the debt or creditor alleged in the SOR. (AE A) He testified that he did not open
the account, was not familiar with the account, and believed that his purported wife had
used his personal information to open the account. This account was not listed in the April
2021 police report as an account reported by Applicant as fraudulently opened with his
personal information. He said that he believed it was included in another police report that
he had filed, stated that he would submit that police report after the hearing, but did not
do so. He said that he had not contacted the creditor but had turned the debt over to his
credit  repair  representatives  to  resolve  in  2017  or  2018.  He  provided  no  documentary
evidence that he or anyone acting in his behalf contacted the creditor, made payments
on or otherwise resolved the debt, or that he reported this debt resulted from identity theft
to police. This debt is not resolved. (GE 2; AE A, F; Tr. 72- 76)
SOR ¶1.f: medical collection account  for $477. A September 2018 credit report
reflects an individual account was assigned for collection in April 2018 with an account
balance of $477, and that the account was in dispute. (GE 2) In response to Applicant’s
dispute, a credit agency confirmed the $477 debt was in his name and remained unpaid
as of July 2021. (AE H at 4) Applicant denied the allegation noting that he had retained
legal counsel. (SOR Response) He testified that he had co-signed along with his son as
a responsible party for emergency medical treatment provided to his son in approximately
2018. After the past due bill appeared on his credit report in 2019 or 2020 and he learned
that his son could not pay the bill, Applicant said that he decided to contact the creditor
to  resolve  the  account,  but  was  advised  by  his  credit  repair  representative  to  let  them
address the debt. He said that he believed the debt was resolved, but had not received
written confirmation of resolution. He provided no documentary evidence that he or any
one acting in his behalf contacted the creditor, made payments on or otherwise resolved
the debt. This debt is not resolved. (GE 2; Tr. 76-80,106-107)
SOR ¶1.g: collection account for $405. A September 2018 credit report reflects
an individual account was assigned for collection in  May 2012 with a balance of $405,
and that the account was in dispute. Applicant denied the allegation noting that he had
retained  legal  representation.  (SOR  Response)  He  testified  that  this  was  his  military
exchange account, that he had added his purported wife as an authorized user, that she
had used the account to purchase various items, that the debt was currently $3,760, and
that  he  was  timely  paying  the  account.  Although  the  account  information  in  the  credit
reports does not fully align, Applicant’s testimony was partially corroborated by the May
2022 credit reports, and I find this account is being resolved. (GE 2; AE A; Tr. 80-83, 107)
SOR ¶1.h: utility  collection account  for $405. A September 2018 credit report
reflects the individual account as assigned for collection with a balance of $253. Applicant
denied the allegation noting that he had retained legal representation. (SOR Response)
He testified that this was a utility account for a residence occupied by his purported wife
and their then minor child, that he had paid the bill, and that he could contact the company
and obtain proof of payment.  He provided no documentary evidence that he contacted
the creditor, made payments on or otherwise resolved the debt. This debt is unresolved.
(GE 2; Tr. 83-84)
Applicant testified and provided documentary evidence that his financial condition
has improved. He provided documentary evidence of approximately $9,500 in net monthly
income  including  approximately  $5,000  (federal  contractor  pay),  $1,175  (Navy  retired
pay), $3,332 (Veteran’s Administration disability payments for 100% disability rating), and
unspecified income from a motorcycle repair business. (AE B; Tr. 86-93). Records from
February  2022  through  June  2022,  reflect  that  his  monthly  checking  account  balance
ranged from approximately $18,000 to $23,000, and his monthly savings account balance
increased from approximately $1,900 in November 2021 to $11,623 in May 2022. (AE B,
C, D, M) He did not provide a monthly budget, but estimated his monthly expenses at
approximately $3,500. (Tr. 90). He testified that he had reviewed his debts with a credit
repair agency and believed that constituted financial counseling, and received financial
management training while in the Navy. (Tr. 84-85, 94)
Applicant submitted  letters of recommendation  from a  supervisor, team  leader,  and
a  co-worker. They  favorably  commented  on  his work ethic, technical  skills, workmanship,
commitment  to  the  team, dependability, trustworthiness, integrity, and  recommended  him
for a  security  clearance  or a  public trust position. (AE  N)  His friend  and  romantic  partner
of  two  years also testified. (Tr. 120-137) She  said that she  overheard  his speakerphone
conversations  with   creditors/credit   agencies   regarding   suspected   fraudulent   accounts
after  he   disputed   those   accounts  and   had   reported   the   suspected   identity   theft   to   the
police,   and   that  those   representatives  said   the   disputed   accounts  included   his  ex-
spouse’s name. (Tr. 133-35). She  also testified  that Applicant “was unaware of  a  lot  of
things  [but  once  he  becomes  aware]  he  tries  to  correct  them”,  that  he  would  not
intentionally jeopardize his well-being, is trustworthy and reliable. (Tr. 136-37)
Any  derogatory  information  not  alleged  in  the  SOR  will  not  be  considered  for
disqualifying  purposes;  however,  it  may  be  considered  in  the  application  of  mitigating
conditions and in a whole-person analysis. (AE A)
