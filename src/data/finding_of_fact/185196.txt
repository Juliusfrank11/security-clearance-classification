Applicant is a 28-year-old, married man. He earned a high school diploma in 2013
and  an  associate  degree  in  2015.  Since  2018,  he  has  been  working  for  a  defense
contractor as an insulator.
Applicant has experienced financial stress over the course of several years that has
caused  him  to  incur  approximately $26,000  of  delinquent  debt,  composed  primarily of
student  loans.  (Item  3  at  34-36;  Item  5  at  3-5)  He  attributes  his  financial  problems  to
immaturity.  Applicant  contends  that  he  has  been  satisfying  his  debts  in  $500  monthly
payments and that he has reduced the balance to approximately $10,000. (Item 7)  He did
not specify when he began making these payments, nor did he provided any documented
proof  of  these  payments.  Applicant  also  asserts  that  he  now  manages  his  finances
responsibly,  uses  credit  cards  only  in  case  of  emergencies,  and  has  established  a
spending limit, which he does not exceed. (Item 4 at  9) He provided no evidence of a
budget, or nor evidence that he has ever received financial counseling.
