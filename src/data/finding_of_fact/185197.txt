Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d, and she denied SOR ¶¶ 1.e-1.i, all with brief
explanations. Her admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough
and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  the  record  evidence  submitted,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant is 33 years old. She graduated from high school in 2007, and she has
attended  some  college  courses.  She  studied  to  be  a  pharmacy  technician  but  did  not
complete the certification because she could not afford the required unpaid externship.
She  married  in  2010,  at  age  22,  separated  from  her  husband  in  June  2013,  and  the
divorce was finalized a year later. She has three girls, ages 12, 6, and 8 months. She
receives no child support from their fathers because she cannot locate them. (Tr. 29-33;
GE 1; AE E)
In  2010,  Applicant  was  working  in  aviation  for  a  small  airline.  She  married  and
moved to another state with her husband, and was unable to transfer jobs. Her husband
was from Africa. She sponsored his entry to the United States, in hopes that he would
become a U.S. citizen. When they moved to the new state for his job, he was not able to
provide financial support, so she sought employment in retail. (Tr. 45-46)
Applicant  had a  variety of  jobs until March  2015 when  she began working for a
large defense contractor and subcontractor, in State 1. She worked there for about three
years, earning $35,000 a year. (AE A, AE B, AE C) She then returned to her home state,
and worked at a computer help desk for a university health system. She was then self-
employed managing a cleaning service. That job is ongoing but the work is sporadic. (Tr.
36; GE 1; AE A)
Between January 2019 and early 2021, Applicant made between $20 and $24 an
hour in a job in the defense industry. She then worked for a large contractor as a project
manager  and  cyber-security  specialist,  with  an  annual  salary  of  about  $76,000  or
$80,000.  She  worked  in  that  job  for  about  a  year.  She  then  became  a  cyber-security
analyst earning $107,000 annually, until February 2022, when she likely lost her interim
clearance after the SOR was issued. Her youngest daughter was born a month later. (Tr.
33-42; GE 1; AE A, AE D, AE F)
Since  February  2022,  Applicant  has  had  only  sporadic  employment.  She  was
unemployed until June 2022, when she took a job as a security guard, making $16 an
hour, full time. That job ended in mid-October 2022, about six weeks before the hearing,
and she remains unemployed, though sponsored for a clearance. (Tr. 39-42)
The SOR allegations concern nine delinquent debts, totaling about $45,000. The
debts are established  by Applicant’s credit reports from  December 2018, August 2019,
and  December  2019,  as  well  as  Applicant’s  SCA,  on  which  she  disclosed  numerous
debts. (GE 1, GE 3, GE 4, GE 5)
SOR ¶  1.a  ($20,429) is a  charged-off debt relating  to  a  repossessed  auto. SOR ¶
1.c ($9,112) is  a past-due  account  relating  to  another repossessed  auto, purchased  at
the  same  time.  Applicant  purchased  the  cars in  State  1  after she  moved  there  with  her
husband. The  car relating  to  SOR ¶  1.c,  purchased  in 2015, was a  gift for a  friend. She
said she  had  settlement offers for both  debts, for either $2,000  or $3,000, and  planned
on  paying  them. She  has not been  able to  do  that  due  to  her employment instability  and
family  situation. (Tr. 49-54, 57-61; GE  3;  GE  4; GE  5) As of  December 2019, she  had
another auto  account,  with  the  same  creditor as for SOR ¶  1.c,  with  over $15,000  due
(though current at the time). (GE  5)
SOR  ¶  1.b  ($10,898)  is  an  account  placed  for  collection  related  to  educational
expenses  for  a  trade  school.  This  is  an  education  debt  that  Applicant  incurred  while
pursuing  certification  as  a  pharmacy  technician.  Her  then  husband  said  he  would  pay
those expenses but did not do so. She had to use student loans instead. She was on a
re-payment  plan  of  $5  a  month  between  2018  and  2012  but  the  account  is  again
delinquent and unresolved. (Tr. 32-33, 59-61; GE 3; GE 4; AE A) As of December 2019,
Applicant also had almost $26,000 in federal student loans. (GE 5)
SOR ¶ 1.d ($3,222) is an account placed for collection relating to unpaid rent from
an  apartment  in  State  1  that  Applicant  and  her  then  husband  lived  in  when  they  were
there. He told her he would pay it, but instead he just moved out. She was unable to afford
the rent alone. The debt remains unpaid. (Tr. 52; GE 3; AE A)
SOR ¶¶ 1.e ($1,438), 1.f (387), and 1.i ($115) are debts placed for collection, for
past-due telephone or cell phone accounts. The collection agency is the same for each
account, but the debts involve three different phone companies. SOR ¶ 1.g ($255) is a
debt  placed  for  collection  by  the  city  in  State  1  where  Applicant  moved  with  her  then
husband. SOR ¶ 1.h ($224) is a medical debt placed for collection. Applicant denied these
debts  and  believed  she  had  paid  them.  She  did  not  provide  documentation  of  any
payments. (Answer; Tr. 48-49, 56; GE 3)
Applicant  has  not  participated  in  recent  credit  counseling.  Due  to  her  recent
unemployment,  Applicant  has  depleted  her  retirement  and  other  savings.  She  is
dependent on support from friends and family to make ends meet. She has not been able
to  pay  rent  since  May  2022,  and  at  the  time  of  the  hearing,  she  was  facing  possible
eviction. (Tr. 62-66)
After her hearing, Applicant provided a narrative statement by e-mail (AE A), her
divorce decree (AE E) and several documents regarding offers of employment at prior
jobs. (AE B, AE C, AE D, AE F)
