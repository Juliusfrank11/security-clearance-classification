Applicant is a 70-year-old employee of a government contractor. He has worked
for his current employer since about July 2016. He was awarded a bachelor’s degree in
1979.  He  took  some  graduate  courses  but  did  not  earn  a  graduate  degree.  He  was
married  from  1983  until  a  divorce  in  2004.  He  remarried  in  2008.  He  has  six  adult
children and four adult stepchildren. (Tr. 30-32; GE 1-2)
In  the  SOR,  the  Government  alleged  that  Applicant  had  not  timely  filed  his
federal and state income tax returns for the 2012 through 2018  tax years (SOR ¶¶ 1.a
and  1.b).  In  his  Answer,  Applicant  denied  the  SOR  allegations,  as  he  claimed  that  he
had since filed all of the relevant income tax returns. (SOR; Answer)
Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for the 2012 through
2018  tax  years  despite  being  required  to  do  so.  Beginning  in  December  2019  and
ending  in  November  2022,  he  intermittently  filed  these  delinquent  federal  income  tax
returns,  until  he filed  them  all.  He  claimed  that  he filed  some  of  his  delinquent  federal
income  tax  returns  earlier  than  the  date  indicated  on  his  IRS  account  transcripts.
However, he did not file any of the relevant federal income tax returns until about nine
months after his May 2019 security interview. He acknowledged that his desire to earn a
security  clearance  motivated  him  to  file  his  outstanding  federal  and  state  income  tax
returns. (Tr. 28-29, 32-38, 43, 54; Answer; GE 1-4; AE E, L-O, R, S, U, W, X).
Applicant  timely  filed  his  federal  income  tax  returns  for  the  2019  and  2021  tax
years.  He  filed  his  2020  federal  income  tax  return  in  August  2022,  after  it  was  due.
Applicant  owed  approximately  $31,238  in  delinquent  taxes  for  the  2012  tax  year.  He
scheduled a payment  with  the  IRS  of  $12,500  on  his 2012 federal tax delinquency for
early  December  2022.  He  borrowed  the  money  to  make  this  payment  from  his
employment  savings  plan.  He  owed  about  $27,323  and  $39,867  in  delinquent  federal
taxes  for  the  2013  and  2015  tax  years,  respectively.  He  is  owed  a  refund  of  about
$4,309  from  the  IRS  for  the  2014  tax  year.  He  owed  about  $10,102  and  $1,538  in
delinquent federal taxes for the 2020 and 2021 tax years, respectively. He claimed that
the tax delinquencies listed on his IRS account transcripts will be reduced when the IRS
calculates the effects of  several real property sales  and offsets from state tax refunds.
He provided no documentation from the IRS to corroborate lower tax balances. He did
not have a payment arrangement with the IRS.  Any adverse information not alleged in
the  SOR,  such  as  Applicant’s  late  filing  of  income  tax  returns  for tax  years  other  than
2012  through  2018  or  delinquent  taxes  he  owed  cannot  be  used  for  disqualification
purposes. It may be considered when assessing the application of mitigating conditions
and for the whole-person analysis. (Tr. 44-49; GE 1-2; AE E, G, H, K, O, R, S, W, X)
Applicant was not required to file state income tax returns with the states in which
he was residing for the 2012 and 2013 tax years. He therefore did not fail to timely file
state  income  tax  returns  for  the  2012  and  2013  tax  years.  He  failed  to  timely  file  his
state income tax returns in State A for the 2014, 2015, and 2016 tax years. He claimed
that  he  has  now  filed  his  state  income  tax  returns  for  the  2014,  2015,  and  2016  tax
years  with  State  A.  He  provided  W2  and  1099  documents  from  the  State  A  taxation
authority to corroborate the 2014 filing. He provided W2 and 1099 documents from the
State A taxation authority, an unsigned copy of a 2015 State A income tax return, and a
mailing receipt from October 2020 that he claimed is proof that he mailed it. He provided
W2  and  1099  documents  from  the  State  A  taxation  authority  to  corroborate  the  2016
filing.  A  May  10,  2020  letter  from  the  State  A  taxation  authority  accompanying  these
2014 through 2016 W2 and 1099 documents indicated that State A had not yet received
his  state  income  tax  returns.  Given  the  corroborating  documentation,  I  find  that
Applicant  filed  his  2015  State  A  income  tax  return  in  October  2020.  Given  the  lack  of
corroborating  documentation,  I  am  unable  to  find  that  he  has  filed  his  State  A  income
tax returns for the 2014 and 2016 tax years. (Tr. 28-29, 32-38; Answer; GE 1-4; AE E,
Q,)
Applicant failed to timely file his state income tax returns in State B for the 2015
through 2018 tax years. He claimed that he has since filed his state income tax returns
with  the  State  B  taxation  authority  for these  tax  years,  but  State  B’s  taxation  authority
has no record of the 2015 and 2018 tax year filings. He provided an unsigned copy of a
2015 State B tax return. He provided no other documentation with respect to his State B
income  tax  filings  for  the  2016,  2017,  and  2018  tax  years.  Given  the  lack  of
corroborating  documentation,  I  am  unable  to  find  that  he  has  filed  his  State  B  income
tax returns for the 2016, 2017, and 2018 tax years. (Tr. 28-29, 32-38; Answer; GE 1, 2;
AE E, I, J, P)
Applicant  provided  no  documentation  to  corroborate  that  he  has  filed  a  state
income tax return for the 2021 tax year. He provided signed 2020 State A and State B
income  tax  returns  from  February  2022  corroborating  that  he  filed  these  returns.  He
provided no documentation to corroborate that he has filed a state income tax return for
the 2019 tax year. (Tr. 28-29, 32-38; Answer; AE I, J)
Applicant acknowledged that he owed State A and State B taxes for the 2015 tax
year  in  the  combined  amount  of  about  $1,300.  He  has  provided  no  evidence  of
payments towards this tax indebtedness. (GE 1, 2; AE P, Q)
Applicant’s excuses for not timely  filing  his federal and  state  income  tax  returns
are many and varied. He has moved several times, which led to him losing records. He
also  claimed  that  some  of  his  records  might  have  been  stolen  because  there  were
prowlers  who  apparently  broke  into  his  home.  In  2012,  he  was  a  self-employed
contractor  responsible  for  paying  his  own  taxes.  He  did  not  sufficiently  pay  taxes
resulting in an unspecified tax burden that he found out about in 2020. He  lost a job in
2014 and changed jobs several times. He was diagnosed with cancer in 2018, as was
his wife, in 2020. In 2013, he and his wife spent a significant amount of money opening
a business that failed because of a dispute with their landlord. Applicant’s wife, who was
a  trained  income  tax preparer,  thought  that she  could  use this loss  as  a  deduction for
tax  purposes,  so  they  delayed  filing  their  income  tax  returns.  Applicant  was  working
hard, and, as his wife had agreed to file the income tax returns, he lost track of  them.
When  he  realized  that  the  income  tax  returns  had  not  been  filed,  he  was  hesitant  to
confront  his  wife  for  fear  of  upsetting  her.  He  claimed  she  had  post-traumatic  stress
disorder  over  finances  from  the  conditions  of  her  earlier  marriage.  His  wife’s  growing
anxiety  over  these  untimely  filings  contributed  to  further  procrastination.  When  he
eventually began addressing the taxes himself, the pandemic and IRS backlog slowed
his efforts to remedy the situation. (Tr. 38-43, 50-52; Answer; GE 1-4; AE A, D, E)
Applicant  earned  approximately  $200,000  per  year  through  his  salary  and
bonuses. His wife cannot work because of her cancer diagnosis and resulting treatment.
He  has  a  few  thousand  dollars  in  a  savings  account  and  a  few  thousand  dollars  in  a
retirement  account.  He  has  paid  an  additional  $2,500  per  month  for  an  unused
apartment in City A since 2018 that is a significant drain on his resources. He claimed
that  he  has  been  saving  about  $300  per  month  in  order  to  pay  down  his  tax
delinquencies once he enters into payment plans with the IRS and the states to which
he owes taxes. He has been in regular contact with the IRS and relevant state taxation
authorities to resolve his tax deficiencies since no later than November 2021. He does
not follow a written budget and has not received financial counseling. Applicant planned
to  set  up  payment  arrangements  to  resolve  his  remaining  tax  delinquencies  once  he
and the IRS determine his tax indebtedness. (Tr. 49-53; Answer; GE 2; AE D)
Applicant  provided  a  periodic  and  year-end  performance  review  from  his
employer  for  2020.  According  to  these  reviews,  he  is  an  excellent  performer,  shows
leadership  skills,  acts  ethically,  and  is  honest.  He  also  provided  a  character  reference
letter from an individual who is a long-time security clearance holder that came to know
Applicant through church. This individual found him to be trustworthy and of high moral
character. (AE B, C, F)
