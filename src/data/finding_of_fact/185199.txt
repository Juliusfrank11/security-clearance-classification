Applicant  is  48  years old  and married.  His  wife  is  a  registered  nurse.  He  has  a
Bachelor’s  degree  with  additional  post-graduate  education.  Applicant  began  work  with
his  current  employer  in  August  2016.  He  requires  access  to  sensitive  personal
information  in  connection  with  his  employment.  (Government  Exhibit  1  at  Sections  12,
13A, and 17.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)
The SOR contained five allegations under Guideline F, Financial Considerations,
including the amendment discussed above. Applicant admitted all the allegations in the
SOR  under  this  paragraph  with  explanations.  Evidence  for  the  existence  of  the  debts
set  forth  in  the  SOR  is  found  in  credit  reports  of  Applicant  dated  August  14,  2018;
January 15, 2020; December 21, 2021; and June 10, 2022. (Government Exhibits 3, 4,
5, and 6.) Additional support is found in the Report of Investigation (ROI) of an interview
of  Applicant  by  a  Government  investigator  on  May  13,  2019.  (Government  Exhibit  2.)
The  total  amount  of  past-due  indebtedness  owed  by  Applicant  is  alleged  to  be
approximately $53,780.
Applicant  and  his  wife  (hereafter  “Applicant”  will  refer  to  both  of  them  unless
otherwise indicated) purchased a franchise from a national home-health-care company
(HHC)  in  approximately  2015.  In  order  to  fund  the  establishment  of  the  franchise  the
HHC  recommended  they  take  out  several  credit  cards  that  had  introductory  interest
rates  of  zero  percent  and  use  them  to  obtain  cash  advances.  During  the  introductory
period, which corresponded with approximately the first two years of the franchise, they
were  able  to  make  the  contract  payments.  Once  the  introductory  period  was  over  the
credit cards began charging interest. At this point, Applicant realized that the business,
while successful, would not allow them to make the required payments going forward. In
order  to  resolve  the  issue  in  a  proactive  manner  Applicant  obtained  the  services  of  a
debt  resolution  company  (DRC)  in  approximately  May  2017.  After  retaining  the  DRC
Applicant turned over negotiation of the credit card debts to the DRC and began making
consistent  monthly  payments  of  $1,900  to  the  DRC.  The  DRC  was  successful  in
negotiating  settlement  agreements  with  all  of  the  credit  card  debt  alleged  in  the  SOR.
Based on these negotiations Applicant paid off  the newly agreed amounts through the
DRC.  All  the  allegations  in  the  SOR  relate  to  the  business  run  by  Applicant’s  spouse.
(Answer; Tr1 at 14-16, 26-29, 31, 47, 51-53; TR2 at 7-10, 14-15.)
The status of the debts set forth in the SOR is as follows:
1.a  and   1.e.  Applicant   admitted   owing   $14,801   to   the   collection  agency   in  SOR
1.a.  This  debt  is   set  forth   in   Government  Exhibit  4   at  page   2.  The   high   credit   for  the
original underlying  credit card debt is $17,292. Date of last  activity is June 2017.
Evidence shows that this is the same debt as that alleged in SOR 1.e. This debt
to a financial institution  is set forth in Government Exhibit 6 at page 4.  The high credit
for this credit card debt is $17,292. Date of last activity is June 2017.
Applicant Exhibit E is a statement from the DRC concerning payment of the debt
set forth in SOR 1.a and 1.e through a different collection agency then the one set forth
in  SOR  1.a.  In  January  2019,  the  DRC  reached  a  50%  payout  of  the  $17,292  debt.
Records from the DRC show the debt was successfully paid off in June 2021. (Applicant
Exhibits A-2 and E.) This debt is resolved. (TR1 at 30-32, 35-38, 43-45; TR2 at 17-21.)
1.b.  Applicant admitted owing a past-due debt to this financial services company
in  the amount of  approximately $10,277. In September 2019 the DRC reached a 50%
payoff  agreement  with  this  creditor  as  shown  by  documentation  from  the  creditor.
(Applicant  Exhibit  C-1.)The  latest  credit  report  states,  “Account  paid  for  less  than  full
balance.  Paid  charge  off.  Fixed  rate.”  (Government  Exhibit  6.)  This  debt  is  resolved.
(TR1 at 33.)
1.c.  Applicant  admitted  owing  a  past-due  debt  to  a  bank  in  the  amount  of
approximately  $6,377.  In  April  2020,  the  DRC  reached  a  payoff  agreement  with  this
creditor as shown by documentation from the creditor. (Applicant Exhibit B-1.) The latest
credit  report  states,  “Account  paid  for  less  than  full  balance.  Paid  charge  off.”
(Government Exhibit 6.) This debt is resolved. (TR1 at 33.)
1.d. Applicant admitted owing a past-due debt to a financial services company in
the  amount  of  approximately  $5,033.  In  September  2019,  the  DRC  reached  a  payoff
agreement  with  this  creditor  as  shown  by  documentation  from  the  creditor.  (Applicant
Exhibit  D-1.)  The  latest  credit  report  states,  “Account  paid  for  less  than  full  balance.
Paid charge off.” (Government Exhibit 6.) This debt is resolved. (TR1 at 33.)
Applicant  testified that he and his wife have  learned their lesson on  using debt.
He acknowledged that the use of these credit  cards in this way did not work for them.
However, he argued that he used good sense in obtaining the services of the DRC and
using the  company to achieve  a  resolution  with  each of  the  creditors.  He  and his wife
currently  have  no  past-due  debt,  and  the  company  is  still  in  existence  and  profitable.
(Government Exhibit 6; TR1 at 25-26, 34; TR2 at 10-14, 21-22.)
Paragraph 2 (Guideline E  - Personal Conduct)
The  Government  alleges  in  this  paragraph  that  Applicant  is  ineligible  for
clearance  because  he  has  engaged
judgment,
untrustworthiness  or  unreliability.  Applicant  admitted  the  factual  allegations  under  this
guideline.  However,  he  denied  having  an  intent  to  falsify  the  questionnaire  or  the
subsequent interview.
that  shows  poor
in  conduct
Applicant filled out  his e-QIP on July 25, 2018. Section 26 of that questionnaire
concerns Applicant’s financial situation. Several subsections ask whether, within seven
years  of  filling  out  the  questionnaire,  Applicant  had  defaulted  on  a  loan;  had  debts
turned  over  to  a  collection  agency;  had  an  account  suspended,  charged  off,  or
cancelled  for  failing  to  pay  as  agreed;  or  had  been  120  days  delinquent  on  debts.  A
different subsection asked whether he was currently 120 days delinquent on his debts.
Applicant answered all the questions, “No.” As stated, Applicant had past-due debts, so
this  was  an  incorrect  answer  to  a  relevant  question  about  his  financial  situation.
(Government Exhibit 1.)
Applicant was interviewed by a Government investigator on May 13, 2019. When
first  questioned  about  delinquent  debts  he  demurred. When  confronted  with  the  debts
set forth in Paragraph 1 of the SOR Applicant agreed to their existence. The ROI stated,
“Subject [Applicant] did not report these [debts] on his security questionnaire, due to the
accounts being in the process of being resolved.” (Government Exhibit 2 at 6.)
Applicant subsequently stated in his Answer, “I misunderstood/misinterpreted the
question on Section 26 – Financial Record – Delinquency Involving Routine Accounts –
My understanding was that if I go via a debt relief company then that means that I am
not defaulting on my payments and I am agreeing to pay the amount that I owe.”
In his testimony, Applicant expanded on these statements. He stated that he had
a good-faith belief that working with the DRC meant that he was not delinquent on the
debts since he was agreeing to the revised payments and payment plans in a legal and
above-board  way.  Applicant  also  stated  that  he  believed  the  debts  were  not  in
collections at  the time he and his spouse  went  to  the  DRC.  (TR1 at  16-17, 45-48, 53;
TR2 at 7-8, 15-17, 22.)
