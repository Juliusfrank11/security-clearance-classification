In addition to the facts established by Applicant’s admissions to allegations under
both Guidelines H and E, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 38 years old.
In 2002, he earned a bachelor’s degree in political science. In 2013, he earned a master’s
of  business  administration  (MBA).  In  January  2012,  he  went  to  work  for  a  federal
contractor in an information technology (IT) position that required eligibility for a security
clearance.  He  worked  there  until  July  2016,  when  he  started  working  for  his  current
employer, also a federal contractor, in a position that also requires access to classified
information. (GX 1; Tr. 43 – 46)
Applicant has had access to classified information since 2012. He first applied for
a  security  clearance  by  submitting  an  Electronic  Questionnaire  for  Investigations
Processing  (e-QIP)  on  January  9,  2012  (e-QIP  #1;  admitted  as  GX  5).  Based  on  the
ensuing background investigation, he received a secret-level security clearance in early
2012. On December 12, 2012, he submitted another e-QIP (e-QIP #2; admitted as GX 3)
to obtain eligibility for access at the top-secret level, which he received in March 2013.
On  November  21, 2018,  he  submitted  another e-QIP  (e-QIP #3; admitted  as GX 1) to
initiate this current review of his eligibility for access. (GX 1; GX 3; GX 5)
Applicant was married from September 2011 until finalizing a divorce in May 2013.
He  and  his  ex-wife  separated  sometime  in  2012.  In  October  2012,  Applicant  obtained
what he termed a legal separation, and then proceeded through a contentious and bitter
divorce.  Applicant’s  ex-wife  reportedly  abused  alcohol  and  was  often  abusive  towards
him. The divorce caused Applicant to endure significant personal, physical, financial, and
psychological stress. Since 2017, he has been in a committed relationship with a woman
to whom he now is engaged, and with whom he has two children. (Answer 1; GX 1; Tr.
48, 53 – 55)
Applicant first used marijuana at age 17 in 2001 while on a student trip abroad. He
next used in 2004, while in college, and  between  2007 and 2010 with friends in social
settings. Available information shows he did not use marijuana again until October 2012.
At  that  time,  he  began  using  marijuana  as  a  means  to  cope  with  the  stressors  of  his
separation  and  pending  divorce.  He  was  having  trouble  sleeping  because  of  related
anxiety, and his doctor prescribed him different medications to address his condition. He
avers  that  the  medications  either  were  ineffective  or  had  significant  side  effects  that
impeded  his  ability  to  function  at  home  and  at  work.  He  chose  to  use  marijuana  as  a
replacement for the prescribed medications and for about the next two years, he used
frequently  each  week.  Applicant  obtained  marijuana  from  a  friend  with  whom  he  had
worked  in  2009  and  2010,  receiving  small  amounts  of  marijuana  from  that  friend  in
exchange for doing chores and odd jobs for him. Applicant often used marijuana with that
friend. This arrangement and Applicant’s frequency of use lasted until about May 2014, a
year after his divorce, when the friend moved away. At all times during this period of drug
use, Applicant had access to classified information. In e-QIP #2, submitted in December
2012,  despite  the  fact  that  he  had  been  using  marijuana frequently  each  week for the
preceding two months,  he stated he  had  last  used marijuana  in  2007 and that he had
used  it  a  total  of  about  five  times.  At  hearing,  he  conceded  he  intentionally  omitted
information about his drug use from e-QIP #2. (Answer 1; GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 48 – 60, 69, 75
– 77)
When Applicant submitted e-QIP #1 in January 2012, he did not disclose that he
had used marijuana during the preceding seven years; however, when he submitted e-
QIP #2 in December 2012, he disclosed that he had used marijuana “socially a few times
in college and grad school” between 2004 and 2007. Also in that application, he denied
any future intent to use marijuana, stating “I do not have any need or use for it and will
not jeopardize my way of life.” In e-QIP #2, he did not mention that, two months earlier,
he had begun using marijuana more frequently to cope with the breakup of his marriage.
(GX 3 and 5)
In June 2018, Applicant and his fiancée were travelling with friends in a state where
recreational use of marijuana is legal. They visited breweries and attended a concert, and
at  some  point  decided  to  try  edibles  containing  THC,  the  controlled  substance  in
marijuana. Applicant next used marijuana at a New Year’s Eve party in his home state,
where  marijuana  use  is  still  illegal  under  state  law.  He  was  intoxicated  and  smoked
marijuana when someone offered it to him while standing around a bonfire. (Answer 1;
GX 2; Tr. 59 – 60, 104 – 105)
Applicant submitted e-QIP #3 on November 21, 2018. In response to questions in
Section 23 (Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity), he disclosed that he used marijuana
between October 2012 and June 2018, and that he had used in social settings about five
times “since days of regular use,” by which he meant the period between October 2012
and  May  2014.  When  asked  if  his  drug  use  occurred  while  he  possessed  a  security
clearance, he answered “Yes.” When asked if he intended to use marijuana in the future,
he  answered  “No,”  and  stated  “The  stress  that  was  present  while  regularly  using
marijuana during my divorce are no longer present. I have developed proven routines and
activities that help alleviate stress and have a positive relationship for which the stress of
the past is no longer present.” In contrast to his reported five instances of marijuana use
after 2014, Applicant testified that he only used marijuana twice after 2014 – in June and
December 2018. On cross-examination, he referred to his e-QIP disclosure as “a general
statement.” (GX 1 at 31 – 32; Tr. 59 – 60, 76 – 77)
During the background investigation initiated by e-QIP #3, Applicant completed a
PSI  with  a  government  investigator  on  January  24,  2019.  During  that  interview,  he
reported he first used marijuana in October 2012 and last used marijuana in June 2018.
On  July  5,  2019,  a  government  investigator  conducted  two  follow-up  interviews  with
Applicant about his drug use. In the first July 5 interview, Applicant reported that he used
marijuana with the person from whom he obtained the marijuana an average of four nights
a week over an average of three weeks monthly. After his source of marijuana moved
away,  he  smoked  marijuana  in  social  settings  or  parties  if  someone  offered  it  to  him.
During the first July 5 interview, he also disclosed his use of marijuana on December 31,
2018.  He  stated  that  he  only  used  marijuana  that  night  because  he  was  intoxicated.
During the interview, he stated he did not intend to use marijuana in the future because
he now has good sleep habits, he meditates, and he is in a good relationship with his
fiancée. (GX 2)
The  summary  report  of  the  July  5,  2019  PSI  does  not  indicate  that  Applicant
explained why he had not disclosed his December 2018 marijuana use when discussing
his drug use during a PSI less than a month after his last use. Applicant denied SOR 2.d,
which alleged that he intentionally made a false official statement to the government by
failing to disclose his most recent drug use during the January 2019 PSI. In response to
the  SOR  and  at  hearing,  he  stated  that  he  did  not  disclose  smoking  marijuana  at  the
December 2018 New Year’s Eve party because he was so intoxicated that night he did
not  remember  doing  so.  He  claimed  it  was  not  until  the  spring  of  2019,  as  he  was
discussing  his  drug  use  with  a  friend  whom  he  had  listed  as  a  reference  in  e-QIP  #3,
Section 16 (People You Know Well) that he recalled his December 2018 use. That friend
was the same person who hosted the New Year’s Eve party, and according to Applicant,
reminded him that he had used marijuana that evening. (GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 70 – 72)
Applicant’s  fiancée  testified  for  Applicant.  She  recounted  their  use  of  edibles  in
June  2018,  and  she  was  present  at  the  New  Year’s  Eve  party.  Although  she  did  not
witness  Applicant  using  marijuana,  she  testified  she  knew  he  had  used  it  at  the  party
because Applicant told her that evening that he had smoked marijuana. (Tr. 110 - 111)
In   response   to   the   Government’s  information,  Applicant  presented   19   letters  of
support, all  attesting  to  his good  character, reliability, and  trustworthiness. (AX  A) He also
presented  a  series  of  lab  reports that show  he  tested  negative  for controlled  substances
through  hair  and  urine  tests each  month  between  May  2021  and  August 2022  (AX  B) In
April 2021, he  completed  a  marijuana  education  class that  discusses the  chemistry  and
legalities  associated   with   marijuana.  (AX   C;  Tr.  98   –   99)  Also  presented   were  recent
performance  evaluations from  his employer that reflect excellent work between  2016  and
2020. (AX  D)  Applicant also has  completed  several IT  certifications.  (AX  F)  A  co-worker
who  has known  Applicant since  2017  testified  that he  is an  excellent worker who  is a  “go-
to   guy”  on   important  projects.   The   witness  also  reported   that  Applicant  is  largely   self-
taught  in most of  his IT skills, and  that he  is honest  and  trustworthy. The  witness is  aware
of  Applicant’s use  of  marijuana  to  cope  with  divorce-related  stress,  but acknowledged  that
his drug use  thereafter was a stupid mistake. (Tr. 29  –  43)
Applicant insists that he does not intend to use marijuana in the future. To that end,
he presented a notarized statement of intent (AX E) in which he acknowledged that any
future drug use might be grounds for revocation of any clearance he holds. Applicant also
testified that he no longer associates with persons who use marijuana, and that he leads
a lifestyle that is conducive to continued abstinence. By contrast, the personal reference
who  he  claims  refreshed  his  recollection  about  his  December  2018  marijuana  use  is
someone with whom Applicant has smoked marijuana in the past, and who hosted the
New Year’s Eve party. Applicant’s fiancée characterized that party as a gathering of “very,
very close friends.” As of the July 2019 PSIs, Applicant was in contact with that person
about quarterly.  (GX 2; Tr. 91 – 93, 94 – 95, 105)
