After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  testimony,  and  exhibits
submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 52 years old. He served in the United States Navy from September
1989 to February 2017, was honorably discharged, and retired as an E-6. While serving
in  the  Navy  he  completed  extensive  training  and  numerous  schools  receiving
certifications as a journeymen electronics technician and master training specialist. He is
twice divorced and was married from April 1994 to June 1998, and August 2006 to May
2016.  He has  two  adult  children, ages 29 and  24.  He was  unemployed from  February
2017 to May 2018, and has been employed as an analyst for a federal contractor since
May 2018. He held a security clearance while serving in the Navy, including a top secret
clearance. (GE 1; GE 2; AE A; AE B; Tr. 11, 41-51, 77-80, 105-107)
Applicant  admitted  all  SOR  allegations.  (SOR  Response;  Tr.  17-22)  The  SOR
allegations and relevant evidence are summarized below.
Guideline E  - Personal Conduct  and Guideline  J  - Criminal Conduct
SOR ¶¶  1.a  and 1.b:  Deliberately  provided false   information for dependent
benefits  and renewed ID card for ineligible  former spouse:  Applicant admitted that
he deliberately provided false information to the Navy on at least three occasions from
about May 2013 to September 2014 in order to receive dependent benefits, including a
dependent ID card, to which he was not legally entitled. In about May 2013 and November
2013, he signed dependency application forms falsely identifying his former spouse, who
had  divorced  him  in June  1998, as his current  spouse. In  about September 2014, he  told
a  Navy  officer that his second  ex-wife,  then  his spouse,  was his ex-girlfriend, when  in fact
she  had  been  his spouse  since  August 2006.  He testified  that he  married  his first spouse
in April 1994  and  that  their  daughter  was born  in  1993.   At  some  point,  he  and  his  first
spouse  became  estranged. In 2005, he  decided  to  divorce his first spouse  in anticipation
of  marrying  another woman, but  learned  that  his first wife  had  divorced  him  in  June  1998.
He  testified   and   told  Navy   investigators  that  prior  to   2005,   he   did   not   know   he   was
divorced, had  not signed  or  received  any  divorce  paperwork, and  never went to  court. He
testified  “when  I  found  out I should’ve  said  something  then,  but I  thought I  did  something,
and  that’s where I tried  to  cover it up  because  I thought  I was already  screwed.” (Tr. 57)
He decided  not to  update  his dependents status when  he  married  his second  spouse  in
August 2006,  because  he  thought he  had  received  allowances that  he  was not eligible  for
after his first  marriage  ended  in  divorce and  “didn’t  want to  get  in trouble.” (Tr.  58)  (SOR
Response; GE 2  at 1-2; GE  6; Tr. 18-19, 42, 51-77, 105-115)
He continued to identify his former spouse as his current spouse on dependent ID
application  forms  until  at  least  November  2013,  and  she  received  dependent  benefits
including medical care through at least October 2013. He said that he did not know that
she  received  dependent  benefits,  that  he  did  not  intend  for  her  to  do  so,  and  that  he
reimbursed the Government for the cost of those benefits. He did not submit documentary
evidence to corroborate his claims.  In a sworn statement to investigators, his  first wife
stated  that  Applicant  would  not  cooperate  with  the  divorce,  so  in  accordance  with
guidance from her attorney, she sent copies of the divorce decree to him and his Navy
supervisor. She also said that thereafter “about every four years, around the time our ID
cards were about to expire [Applicant would call and tell her she] could get the ID cards
[for herself and their daughter].” (GE 6 at 23) She indicated her relationship with Applicant
was contentious and that one of the few reasons they communicated was when her or
her daughter’s military ID was about to expire. (SOR Response; GE 2 at 1-2; GE 6; Tr.
18-19, 42, 51-77, 105-115)
SOR ¶  2.a:  Special  court-martial guilty  plea  and sentence:  In  September 2014,
Applicant’s second  spouse  reported  that  she  had  been  married  to  Applicant since  2006
and   that  she  had   not  received   a   military   identification   (ID)   card or benefits.  In   October
2014,  Applicant  provided   a   statement  to   Navy   investigators  admitting   the   misconduct
alleged   in   SOR  ¶¶   1.a   and   1.b.  (GE   6   at   19-21).  In   response   to   the   SOR,   Applicant
admitted  that in about October 2015  he  pled  guilty to  four military  offenses  including  three
false  official  statements  for   identifying   his  former  spouse   as  his   current   spouse   in
dependent application  forms in May and November 2013,  and intentionally deceiving his
administrative   officer  in  September  2014   by   identifying   his   then   spouse   as  his  “ex-
girlfriend,”   and   wrongfully   renewing   his  former  spouse’s  military  ID   card.  He  was
sentenced to  reduction  in rate from  E-8  to  E-7, forfeiture  of  $3,000  pay  per month for six
months,   and   fined   $2,242.   Following   subsequent  administrative   proceedings,  the
Secretary  of  the  Navy  approved  his retirement in the  paygrade  of  E6. (SOR Response;

Guideline F – Financial Considerations
SOR ¶  3.a:  cross  alleges  information in SOR ¶¶  1.a  and 1.b. Applicant admitted
the allegation. (SOR Response; Tr. 20-21)
SOR ¶  3.b:  failure  to  file  federal income  taxes  for tax  years  2017  and 2018.
Applicant  admitted that  he failed  to file,  as required, federal income  tax returns for tax
years  2017  and  2018.  He  noted  that  he  was  “[a]waiting  paperwork  (W-2’s).”  (SOR
Response at 2) He testified that he had not filed federal income tax returns for tax years
2017 or 2018 because he was awaiting the outcome of the security clearance process to
determine whether he could afford to resolve his delinquent tax accounts, or if he should
file for bankruptcy. He acknowledged he had not contacted the IRS about filing or paying
his delinquent taxes, and said that he had been claiming zero exemptions to minimize his
tax debt. He said that he had consulted with a friend with tax preparation experience three
times from approximately April 2018 to June 2021. He attributed his financial difficulties
and  decision  not  to  file  income  tax  returns  to  divorce,  child  support,  loss  of  income
associated  with  his  court-martial  sentence,  including  administrative  errors  in  his  pay,
unemployment, and uncertainty about his future employment. (SOR Response; GE 1 at
41-42; GE 2 at 3; Tr. 20-21, 81-90, 117-126)
SOR  ¶   3.c:   collection  account   for  $5,895.   Applicant  admitted  the  allegation.
Credit  reports  from  September  2019  and  July  2020  reflect  the  account  as  placed  for
collection  with  a  balance  of  $5,895,  and  that  the  consumer  disputed  the  account
information. He testified the debt was for an apartment lease that he had signed in 2017
for a friend, and that his friend had moved out of the apartment in approximately 2018.
He attributed his financial difficulties to his friend’s failure to pay the rent,  divorce, child
support,
including
administrative  errors  in  his  pay,  unemployment,  and  uncertainty  about  his  future
employment. He said that he was awaiting the outcome of the security clearance process
to determine whether he could afford to pay the debt or if he should file for bankruptcy.
He provided no documentary evidence that he contacted the creditor, made payments on
or otherwise resolved the debt. This debt is not resolved. (SOR Response; GE 2 at 4; GE
3 at 5; GE 4 at 1; Tr. 20-21, 90-92)
income  associated  with  his  court-martial  sentence,
loss  of
SOR ¶  3.d: credit card account  in collection for $10,472. Applicant admitted
the allegation. A September 2019 credit report reflects an individual account in collection
for $10,472, and credit reports from July 2020 and May 2022 show that debt has been
charged off. He testified that this was his credit card account and that his second wife
was  an  authorized  user  on  the  account.  He  said  that  he  had  not  tried  to  contact  the
creditor  and  attributed  his financial  difficulties  to  divorce,  child  support,  loss  of  income
associated  with  his  court-martial  sentence,  including  administrative  errors  in  his  pay,
unemployment, and uncertainty about his future employment. This debt is not resolved.
(SOR Response; GE 3 at 4; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 5; Tr. 20-21, 92-93)
SOR  ¶   3.e:  vehicle   loan  charged  off  for  $6,905.   Applicant  admitted  the
allegation. Credit reports from July 2020 and May 2022 reflect the account as a vehicle
loan  opened  in  January  2015,  with  a  last  payment  in  March  2018,  charged  off  for
approximately $23,000, and with a past-due balance of $6,905. He testified that he fell
behind on payments in late 2017 and that the vehicle was repossessed in early 2018. He
attributed his delinquency to  divorce,  child  support,  loss of  income associated  with  his
court-martial  sentence,  including  administrative  errors  in  his  pay,  unemployment,  and
uncertainty about his future employment. He said that he contacted the creditor by phone
in late 2017, but provided no documentary evidence of that contact or other attempts to
resolve the debt. This debt is not resolved. (SOR Response; GE 4 at 2-3; GE 5 at 4; Tr.
20-21, 93-96)
SOR ¶  3.f: credit card account  charged off  for $3,880. Applicant admitted the
allegation. Credit reports from September 2019, July 2020 and May 2022 reflect the credit
card account was opened in 2008, with the last payment in January 2018, and charged
off for $3,880. He attributed his delinquency on the account to his divorce from his second
wife, child support, loss of income associated with his court-martial sentence, including
administrative  errors  in  his  pay,  unemployment,  and  uncertainty  about  his  future
employment. He said that he contacted the creditor by phone in late 2017, but provided
no documentary evidence of that contact or other attempts to resolve the debt. This debt
is not resolved. (SOR Response; GE 2 at 3-4; GE 3 at 5; GE 4 at 3; GE 5 at 4; Tr. 20-21,
96-97)
SOR  ¶   3.g:  delinquent   vehicle   loan   in  the   amount   of   $23,729.   Applicant
admitted the allegation. Credit reports from September 2019, July 2020, and May 2022
reflect  a  joint  auto  loan  account  was  opened  in  June  2015,  with  the  last  payment  in
September 2017, as an involuntary repossession account with a balance of $23,729 and
past due in the amount of $10,846. He testified that he cosigned a vehicle loan for his
son’s  mother,  and  that  when  she  could  no  longer  pay  the  loan  he was  also  unable  to
make payments because of his divorce from his second wife, child support, loss of income
associated  with  his  court-martial  sentence,  including  administrative  errors  in  his  pay,
unemployment,  and  uncertainty  about  his  future  employment.  The  past  due  balance
reflected in the credit records is $10,846; this debt is not resolved. (SOR Response; GE
2 at 5; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 5, GE 5 at 6; Tr. 20-21, 97-98)
Applicant testified that his net monthly income is approximately $8,400 including
$4,800 (federal contractor net pay), $1,800 (Navy retired pay), and $1,800 (Department
of Veterans Affairs  (VA) disability payments for an 80% service-connected disability). He
estimated  his  bank  account  balance  at  approximately  $6,000,  his  retirement  account
balance at about $20,000, and said that he had over $10,000 in cash. He did not provide
a monthly budget, but estimated his monthly disposable income after expenses at $3,000.
He  said  that  his  disposable  income  varied  and  that  he  had  recently  been  providing
financial assistance to his mother because she was ill. He testified that he had received
financial counseling in the Navy and every time that he made a big purchase.  He said
that he has never been late on his rent. (Tr. 45-47, 85-89, 99-104, 127)
Applicant provided documentary evidence that he was qualified in Navy nuclear
submarines, completed extensive submarine training, earned multiple qualifications, and
received  numerous  awards  and  decorations  during  his  Naval  service.  (AE  A)  He
submitted  a  letter  of  recommendation  from  a  retired  Navy  leader  that  favorably
commented  on  his  technical  skills,  performance  of  duties,  leadership,  judgement,
handling of classified information, dependability, and included a recommendation that he
be granted a security clearance. (AE B)
Applicant also testified that he had not filed federal income tax returns for tax years
2019  through  2021  because  he  was  awaiting  the  outcome  of  the  security  clearance
process. (Tr. 82-85, 117-126) Any derogatory information not alleged in the SOR will not
be considered for disqualifying purposes; however, it may be considered in the application
of mitigating conditions and in a whole-person analysis.
