Applicant  admitted  the  SOR  allegations  in  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.c  and  denied  1.d
through 1.f. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted,
I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 37 years old. She has lived with a cohabitant since 2016. She has no
children. From October 2004 to June 2006, she attended college full time and earned an
associate’s  degree.  She  then  attended  a  university  full  time  from  2007  to  2008.  She
attended online college classes from August 2009 to May 2013. She was also attending
a community college taking online classes at the same time from January 2013 to May
2013. Her college was funded through student loans. (Items 2, 3)
Applicant has been employed by her present employer, a federal contractor, since
March 2019. She was unemployed from January 2015 to July 2015 when the store where
she was working closed. She did not disclose any other periods of unemployment from
2008 to the present. She said she was also underemployed and provided a pay stub to
show how much she was earning for a period in 2015. (Items 1, 2, 3)
Applicant disclosed in her May 2019 security clearance application (SCA) that she
had approximately $116,000 in delinquent student loans that were in collection. (Item 2)
She stated:
I had  financial hardship  that prevented  me  from  paying  the  student loans or
pay  other bills. Once  behind, the  interest became  very  high  and  I could not
handle the  suggested  payments  of $1,000  per month.  I  tried  to  pay  what I
[could]   but   was  unable   to   keep   them   current.   I  am   currently   working   on
making  payments on  the  existing  student  loans and  working  to  make  a  plan
with the creditor to pay the charged  off  ones. (Item  2)
She   estimated   her  financial  difficulty   began   in  2015.   She   further  stated:  “I  have   been
making  payments  to  keep  my  federal student loans current.  I am  working  with  the  creditor
to   make   a   payment   plan   for   the   student   loans   that   were defaulted   and   charged   off.” (Item
2)
Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator  in  August  2019.  She
explained that she stopped attending college classes when her father became ill in 2013
and she went home to help her mother. She told the investigator that all of her student
loans  were  deferred.  Her  father  was  helping  her  with  her  student  loans  and  then  he
passed  away.  She  said  she  was  paying  $380  a  month  on  her  student  loans  and  the
creditor wanted to increase her monthly payment to $1,400, which she could not afford.
She said they were all current until July 2015, when she was laid off from work and could
not afford to make payments. When she resumed working in October 2015, she said she
resumed making payments on all of her loans. She told the investigator that she received
a  $33,686  settlement  offer  from  the  creditor  on  her  private  student  loans  that  totaled
$119,419.  She  was  going  to  accept  the  offer,  and  was  working  out  a  payment  plan
because  she  could not  pay the  entire  amount  in a  lump sum.  She was  going to  begin
payments in September 2019. The loans alleged in the SOR are for her federal student
loans. It is unclear if she confused the loans as there are no others reflected in her credit
reports unless they were removed.
Applicant then told the investigator that she had consolidated her federal student
loans and the estimated amount owed was $126,000. She said she was on a payment
plan and was making $154 monthly payments. She said her father had been helping her
with her federal and private student loan payments and when he passed away she could
not afford  to pay as much. She said  she made  payments,  but  they were  not  likely the
amount the creditors wanted.  She did not provide documentary evidence of payments.
(Item 3)
In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, she admitted she owed the delinquent student
loans in ¶ 1.a ($60,209), ¶ 1.b ($53,410) and ¶ 1.c ($3,527). She said she was unable to
make  payments  when  she  lost  her  job  in  2015  and  after  missing  several  monthly
payments the debts were charged off. She said she was out of work for almost a year. In
2016, she found employment, but the monthly payment the creditor wanted was $1,500
and she could not afford the amount as her salary was between $15,000 and $25,000.
She said she contacted the creditor to make a reasonable payment plan, and it refused.
The loans have been sold to different creditors and she is still working on handling these
debts.  She  did  not  provide  specific  evidence  of  what  actions  she  was  taking.  These
student loans  are unresolved. (Item 1)
Applicant denied she owed the student loan alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d ($1,951). She
provided proof that this debt was part of a class action lawsuit for unfair lending practices
and mismanagement and was forgiven. She provided  documents that support the debt
was forgiven. The debt is resolved. (Item 1)
Applicant was questioned by the investigator about the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e
($416).  She  explained  that  this  was  due  to  an  overdraft  on  a  bank  account.  She  was
notified that she had 30 days to resolve it, but had to do it in person and she no longer
lived in the area. She eventually went to the bank, but the account was closed and the
bank would not let her pay it unless she opened a new account. She told the investigator
she was expecting a letter from the bank, but never received one and then forgot about
the debt. She told the investigator that she would attempt to contact the creditor again. In
June 2022, Applicant satisfied the debt and provided supporting documentation.  (Items
1, 3)
Applicant told the investigator that she was unaware of the medical debt alleged in
SOR ¶ 1.f ($279). She explained that she was called by the medical provider advising her
that her medical services were not covered by insurance. She said she paid the balance
of $236 that was owed at the time. Applicant provided proof that the debt was satisfied in
July 2019. (Items 1, 3)
Applicant  did  not  provide  additional  information  as  to  the  current  state  of  her
finances, how much she earns in annual income, and if she has made any progress on
establishing a payment plan to resolve her student loans. She disclosed in her SCA that
she has took trips to Mexico and the Bahamas (2013); Dominican Republic (2016); Turks
and Caicos Islands (2017); France and the United Kingdom (2017); and a cruise to the
Bahamas in July 2019. No other financial information was provided. (Items 2, 3)
