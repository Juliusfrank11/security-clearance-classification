In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted all of the allegations, with explanations. His
admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence,
I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 49-year-old employee of a federal contractor performing the duties
of an information technology network instructor. He began working at his present job in
June 2017. He served in the U.S. Army from 1994-2017, retiring as a sergeant first class
(E-7)  with  an  honorable  discharge.  While  serving  in  the  Army  he  deployed  four  times,
including to Iraq twice, Afghanistan, and Africa. He receives disability income from the
Department of Veteran’s Affairs. He has taken some college courses. He is married and
has two children. (Tr. 7, 22-23; GE 1)
The SOR alleged that Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in 1998
and  2007.  It  also  alleged  16  delinquent  accounts  (repossessed  cars,  consumer  debt,
payday loans, and a utility debt) totaling approximately $31,368. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.r) The
debts  are  established  by  credit  reports  from  October  2017,  April  2019,  March  2020,
September 2020, and August 2022; Applicant’s personal subject interview (PSI) with an
investigator in October 2018; and his SOR admissions. The bankruptcies are established
by court database records.  (GE 2-9; Answer to SOR)
Applicant’s financial difficulties began after he joined the Army in 1994. He stated
that he was not savvy with financial matters and got into debt right away. This led him to
file his first Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 1998. He completed the payment plan approved by
the court and his debts were discharged in 2006. He accrued more unpaid debt later in
his military career. The payment of that debt was impacted by his deployments in places
where he did not always have ready access to the internet or telephone service to contact
his creditors about payment plans. He filed his second Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2007,
which was dismissed in 2012, when he stopped making his plan payments. He stopped
because he began to realize the impact bankruptcy would have on his security clearance.
When he returned from his last deployment, he discovered that his debts were more than
90  days  past  due.  He  recently  employed  a  national  law  firm  to  attempt  to  have  debts
removed from his credit reports. (Tr. 25-27, 31-33; GE 7-8)
The status of the SOR debts is as follows:
SOR  ¶   1.c-$1,901.   This  debt  resulted  from  a  delinquent  payday  loan. The  loan
became delinquent in July 2019. Applicant provided documentation showing that he paid
in July 2021. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 34; GE 6; AE A)
SOR ¶  1.d-$9,356.  This debt resulted from the deficiency balance owed after the
repossession and sale of Applicant’s car. The date of a major delinquency was July 2018.
Applicant admitted this debt in his SOR answer and stated that he got behind on it when
he was deployed in 2015-2016. He also stated that he planned to negotiate and pay this
debt once his other debts were paid. During his hearing testimony, he admitted that he
had not paid this debt, but had disputed it on his credit report and it was no longer showing
on the report. He gave no reason for the basis of the dispute. There is no documented
evidence showing the result of Applicant’s dispute. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 39, GE
6; AE G)
SOR ¶  1.e-$866. Applicant incurred this credit-card debt in 2012. A credit report
listed the date of a “major delinquency” was March 2015. This is a charged-off account.
Applicant  stated  in  his  SOR  answer  that  he  intended  to  pay  this  debt  once  his  other
accounts are paid. There was no evidence of payment submitted. This debt is unresolved.
(GE 6, SOR answer)
SOR  ¶   1.f-$510.   Applicant  incurred  this  credit-card  debt  in  2012.  The  date  of  a
“major delinquency” was February 2015. This is a charged-off account. Applicant stated
in his SOR answer that he intended to pay this debt once his other accounts are paid.
There was no evidence of payment submitted. A recent credit report shows that Applicant
has  an  account  with  this  creditor  with  a  status  of  “pay  as  agreed.”  This  is  a  different
account than the SOR-alleged debt that was opened in April 2019 with a different account
number. The SOR debt is unresolved. (GE 6; AE G (p. 18-21); SOR answer)
SOR ¶  1.g-$1,120. Applicant admitted this consumer debt. He documented settling
this debt in June 2021. This debt is resolved. (AE E; SOR answer)
SOR ¶  1.h-$606. Applicant admitted this credit-card debt. He documented settling
this debt in July 2021. This debt is resolved. (SOR answer (attachments))
SOR ¶ 1.i-$634.  Applicant admitted this debt. He documented settling this debt in
June 2021. This debt is resolved. (SOR answer (attachments))
SOR  ¶   1.j-$4,157.   Applicant  admitted  this  consumer  debt.  The  account  was
opened in September 2014. It was charged off in February 2015, in the amount of $7,185.
He received an IRS 1099-C for tax year 2021, cancelling the debt. This debt is resolved.
(Tr. 40; AE D; SOR answer)
SOR ¶  1.k-$966. Applicant admitted this consumer debt. Applicant documented
paying this debt in July 2022. This debt is resolved. (AE B; SOR answer)
SOR ¶  1.l-$1,003.  Applicant incurred this credit-card debt in 2013. The date of a
“major delinquency” was November 2019. This is a charged-off account. Applicant stated
in his SOR answer that he intended to pay this debt once his other accounts are paid.
There was no evidence of payment submitted. A recent credit report shows that Applicant
has  an  account  with  this  creditor  with  a  status  of  “pays  account  as  agreed.”  This  is  a
different account than the SOR-alleged debt that was opened in November 2019 with a
different account number. The SOR debt is unresolved. (GE 6; GE 9; SOR answer)
SOR ¶  1.m-$485.  Applicant admitted this consumer debt. He documented settling
this debt in June 2021. This debt is resolved. (AE C; SOR answer)
SOR  ¶   1.n-$1,588.   Applicant  admitted  this  consumer  debt  that  was  opened  in
2013.  The  date  of  a  “major  delinquency”  was  November  2019.  This  is  a  charged-off
account.  Applicant  stated  in  his SOR  answer  that  he  called  the  creditor to  resolve  the
debt, but was told the debt was sent to the IRS. He testified at hearing that when he called
the creditor, the person he spoke with was unhelpful and he decided to save this debt for
last. There is no evidence of payments submitted. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 40-41; GE
6; SOR answer)
SOR ¶  1.o-$466. Applicant admitted this debt. He documented settling this debt in
June 2021. This debt is resolved. (SOR answer (See attachments to answer))
SOR ¶  1.p-$363.  Applicant admitted this debt. He documented settling this debt in
June 2021. This debt is resolved. (SOR answer (See attachments to answer))
SOR ¶  1.q-$5,484.  This debt  resulted  from  the  deficiency  balance  owed  after  the
repossession  and  sale  of Applicant’s  daughter’s car, for which he  cosigned. When  she
failed  to  make  the  payments,  the  creditor turned  to  Applicant  for payment.  The  date  of the
first   delinquency   was  May   2018.  Applicant  admitted   this  debt   in  his  SOR  answer  and
stated  he would be  paying  it off.  In his hearing  testimony, he  stated that he  was trying  to
get the  debt  removed  from  his credit  report.  This debt  is unresolved. (Tr. 39;  AEG  (pp.72-
74))
SOR  ¶   1.r-$1,863.   Applicant  admitted  this  consumer  debt.  The  account  was
opened in October 2012. The date of last action was August 2018. It was charged off.
Applicant testified that he did not pay the debt, but it has fallen off his credit report. This
debt is unresolved. (Tr. 40; GE 3-4; SOR answer)
All the above resolved delinquent debts were paid after the issuance of the SOR
in April 2021. Applicant testified that his annual income is approximately $64,000 and that
his  wife’s  current  income  is  approximately  $36,000  annually.  In  August  2022,  he
purchased a home for $450,000. His monthly mortgage payment is $2,500. He claimed
that he typically has approximately $1,500 to $2,000 left over at the end of the month after
paying all his bills. He has no retirement savings account. He admitted that he recently
bought  a  2015  Mercedes  Benz  automobile  for  $38,000.  His  monthly  payments  are
approximately $750. He owes $800 on his 2021 federal income taxes (this information
will  not  be  used  for  disqualification  purposes,  but  it  may  be  used  in  determining  the
applicability of any mitigating conditions and in assessing the whole-person factors). He
hired a credit-relief law firm to help him send dispute letters for some of his debts, Other
than that assistance, there is no other evidence of financial counseling. (Tr. 29-30, 42-45;
AE F)
