In his answer, Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b, and denied SOR ¶ 2.a. His
admissions  are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  review  of  the  pleadings,
testimony, and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  42  years old.  He  took  some  college  courses,  but  has  not  earned a
degree. He was married in 2007 and divorced in 2012. He has three minor children with
his first wife. He was married again in 2016, and divorced in 2018. He remarried in 2020.
He served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1999-2003, and in the Army National Guard
from  2003-2020.  He  received  an  honorable  discharge.  He  has  worked  as  a  senior
financial  analyst  for  a  defense  contractor  since  early  2021.  He  previously  worked  in
finance as a Federal Government employee from 2007-2018. (Tr. 23-27, 39-40; GE 1)
Applicant was deployed with his military unit from August 2016 through September
2017. He married his girlfriend of about four years a few months prior to deployment. He
claims that before leaving, he signed a power of attorney so that she could file their joint
tax  return  while  he  was  away.  He  stated  that  while  overseas  he  was  told  by  military
leadership that he was not required to file his tax returns until after he came home, and
that there was an additional grace period to file after he came back. (Tr. 28-31, 67; AE A)
During  his  deployment,  Applicant’s  wife  filed  for  separation  and  divorce,  and
abandoned the home that he owned. He reported that when he returned in September
2017, he found his home in a serious state of disrepair. After she absconded, pipes froze,
which created leaks and holes in the ceiling and floors. His vehicle was left non-operable,
with mold growing on the inside and requiring major repairs. He also found that she had
drained the money in their joint bank account. He stated that he was not spending money
while on deployment, so he had not been checking his account balance. He later found
out that she did not file their taxes while he was away. (Tr. 28-31, 33-34, 71-72; AE A)
These unfiled federal and state income tax returns are alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b.
Applicant stated that the divorce was not amicable, and caused him considerable
depression and stress. He reported that he moved to a new location to get away from the
area where they used to live for his mental health, and he had to considerably downsize
his possessions. Some of his tax documentation was lost in the move, and some mail
was not preserved for him while he was deployed. He stated  that he became severely
depressed and distressed when he tried to prepare his tax returns from this time period
(2016-2018), because it made him think about the failed relationship and a very difficult
time in his life. He asserted that he had some kind of PTSD from these events. Further
complicating his efforts, he found out that his wife had filed her taxes separately for these
tax  years.  He  claimed  that  he  needed  to  know  if  she  itemized  the  deductions  on  her
returns,  so  he  could  make  the  same  selection,  or  the  returns  would  be  rejected.  He
asserted that she was not responsive to his attempts to contact her for this information.
(Tr. 28-31, 41-49, 71-74; AE A)
Applicant claimed that he tried to contact the IRS about his delinquent returns, but
could not reach them by phone. These attempts were made during the pandemic, when
there was reduced staffing. He was able to file his federal and state income tax returns in
2021,  but  they  were  not  processed  by  the  IRS  for  about  a  year  because  of  reduced
staffing.  His  IRS tax account records show that  he filed  his 2016 and 2017  returns on
April 30, 2021, and his 2018 return on May 4, 2021. There is no balance due for these
years.  IRS  account  records  also  show  that  he  timely  filed  his  2019-2021  returns,  and
there is no balance due for these years. (Tr. 35-36; AE I, J, K, N, M, R)
The  IRS  account  records for 2016-2018  show  that part of  Applicant’s refunds for
these  years were transferred  out  to  pay  tax  debts from  2012  and  2013. He  reported  that
he  did not  withhold enough  from  his salary  during  these   years, which  resulted  in a   tax
debt.  He  had   been   paying   these   debts   on   a   payment  plan.  His  2012   account  records
show  that  the  debt  originated  at  about $5,400, which he  made  monthly  payments  from
2013-2021.  His  2013   account  records  show   that  the   debt  originated   at   about  $7,400,
which he  made  monthly  payments from  2014 to  2020. Both  debts were paid  through  the
payment plan  and  the  transferring  of  his yearly  refunds, and  are now  resolved. (Tr. 46-
49, 75; AE P, Q)
Applicant reported that he filed his 2016-2018 state tax returns at the same time
as his federal returns. State tax records show that he made about $200  in monthly tax
payments in December 2021, and January and February 2022. He paid the remaining
balance on his state tax account, about $5,400, in July 2022. The state tax debt is now
resolved. (Tr. 54-56; AE S, T)
Applicant’s budget shows that he and his wife’s finances are stable and they are
able  to  afford  their  monthly  expenses.  Their  current  monthly  income  exceeds  their
expenses by about $12,000. Records also show that he is current with his child support
obligations. (AE O, U, V)
After returning to the U.S. in August 2017, but before returning home, Applicant
received  non-judicial  punishment  (NJP)  from  his  command  for  violating  equal
employment opportunity (EEO) standards of conduct with a subordinate service member,
while  intoxicated  off-duty.  (SOR  ¶  2.a)  For  the  NJP,  he  was  orally  reprimanded  and
forfeited $1,925 in pay. He claimed that the night before the unit was scheduled to return
home, he was out with friends on base for dinner and a few drinks. He reported that during
the evening, one friend, who was junior in rank, was acting rude and belligerent towards
him. He claimed that he pulled him aside in view of others, to talk with him and find out
what the problem was between them. He stated that after the conversation they shook
hands. He claimed that the next day, the soldier reported to command that he made a
racial  and  homophobic  slur  towards  him,  and  was  inappropriately  calling  him  names.
Applicant denied these allegations. He stated that he was unable to return home with his
unit because an investigation needed to be completed. After about a month, he agreed
to NJP so he could finally return home. He asserted that the alleged incident was over
five years ago, and that he served in his unit without problem for three years afterwards,
and was honorably discharged. (Tr. 31-35, 56-66, 76-77; AE A)
Applicant submitted three letters of recommendation, all of which state that he is a
good employee and soldier, and that he is reliable, trustworthy, and fit to hold a security
clearance.
