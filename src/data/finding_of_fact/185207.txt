In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a-i. His admissions are
incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings
and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  33  years old.  He  has  been  working  full time  as  an  apprentice for a
federal contractor since September 2018. He experienced a brief period of unemployment
in  2012,  but  otherwise  has  maintained  continuous  employment  since  2011.  He  was
awarded an associate’s degree in 2014. He is not married and has no children. He has
never held a security clearance. (Item 3 at 7, 16, 14, 23, and 23-26.)
Applicant in his SCA listed the reason why his student loans were delinquent as:
“Don’t  have  the  conditions to  pay for the  loans.”  (Item 3 at 36.) The SOR alleges eight
delinquent student loans. The August 2022 credit report, Item 4, documents the student
loans. The February 2022 credit report, Item 5, documents a charged-off credit-card debt.
His student loans total about $49,670. (Item 4 at 5-7.) In 2018, he stated on his SCA that:
“I plan  on  letting  the  collection  agencies  (within  a  week) know  that  I  will begin  making
payments on my loans. I will inform them on wanting to join the late payment forgiveness
plan. Then, eventually setting up a consolidation plan.” (Item 3 at 36.)
The evidence concerning these debts is summarized below.
SOR ¶ 1.a: education loan placed for collection of $12,102. (Item 4 at 5.)
