In his response to the SOR,  Applicant admitted SOR ¶ 1.c but denied all of the
other allegations (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d  through 1.j), all with brief explanations, but
no documents. His admission is incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough
and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional
findings of fact.
Applicant is 65 years old. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from 1979-
1993. He earned his GED while in the Navy. He was married from 1982-2010, when he
and his wife divorced, and he indicated that they separated several years earlier. He has
one adult step-daughter. Applicant is a computer database developer. He submitted his
SCA in January 2018 when employed or sponsored by one defense contractor, but he
has had several employers since then. The file reflects that Applicant received the SOR
through  his  current  clearance  sponsor,  a  large  defense  contractor.  (Item  3,  4;  SOR
receipt)
When  Applicant  submitted  his most  recent  SCA,  in  January 2018,  he  disclosed
several years of unfiled federal income tax returns, from 2006-2016. In his explanations,
he said his tax filing problems began after separating from his wife, in about 2006. He
asserted that he had always been  a “W-2” employee and that his taxes were paid.  For
several of his earlier unfiled returns (2006-2010), he said (on his 2018 SCA) that he was
working  with  an  accountant  and  that  he  expected  to  have  those  returns  satisfied
“by  the  end  of  July  2012.” (Item 2  at  46-47) (This  date suggests  those  items  were  left
unedited from an earlier SCA, not in the record here). For later returns (2011-2016), he
said  that  “due  to  questions  from  previous  years  unfiled  returns,  this  year  could  not  be
filed.” (Item 2 at 48-50).
Applicant had a background interview in May 2019. He discussed his unfiled tax
returns  (expanding  the  timeframe  from  “2006  to  present”)(Item  3  at  17).  Applicant
authenticated  his  interview  summary  as  accurate  (making  some  changes  not  related
here) in an August 2020 interrogatory response to DOHA. (Item 3 at 1-5)
In   the   same   interrogatory   response,  Applicant  also  confirmed   that  his  federal
income  tax  returns for tax  years (TY) 2006-2019  were still  unfiled.  (Item  3  at 6-7)  SOR ¶
1.a covers TY 2006-2018. (TY 2019 was omitted, likely in error).
In denying SOR ¶ 1.a, Applicant stated, “I am currently working with a CPA [name
redacted]  to  rectify  this.  Of  note,  I’ve  always  been  a  W-2 employee  so  my taxes  have
always been deducted and paid by my employers.” (Item 1) (This, of course, is beside the
point, as the issue is Applicant’s unfiled federal returns, not unpaid federal taxes, which
are not alleged). Applicant provided no details, and no documents to show that any of his
unfiled federal tax returns since TY 2006, have, even now, been filed.
The remaining SOR allegations concern various delinquent debts. He denied all
but one of them. The debts are established by an October 2019 credit report. (Item 4) The
SOR debts are detailed as follows: SOR ¶ 1.b ($7,559) is a charged-off debt to a military
credit union. SOR ¶¶ 1.c ($2,334) and 1.d ($1,838) are debts in collection with the same
collection agency. SOR ¶ 1.e ($796) is an account placed for collection. SOR ¶ 1.f ($496)
is a charged-off debt to a credit card company. SOR ¶ 1.g ($217) is a charged off debt to
a credit union. SOR ¶ 1.h ($159) is an account placed for collection by a gas company.
SOR  ¶  1.i  ($136)  is  an  account  placed  for  collection  by  a  bank.  SOR  ¶  1.j  ($72)  is  a
medical debt placed for collection. (Items 1, 4)
Applicant said most of the SOR debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.d. 1.f, 1.g, 1.i, and 1.j) had
been  paid  in  full.  He  denied  SOR  ¶  1.e  without  explanation.  He  said  SOR  ¶  1.h  was
incurred by his former wife but charged to his account. He admitted SOR ¶ 1.c and said
it  was  being  resolved  under  a  monthly  repayment  plan.  (Item  1)  He  provided  no
documents to corroborate any of his assertions with his SOR response. He also did not
respond to the FORM, so he provided no updated information.
