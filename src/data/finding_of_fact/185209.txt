Applicant  admitted  all of  the  SOR  allegations. He  is  44  years old, married, and  he
has two  minor children. He has owned  his home  since  2009. (Answer; Tr. at  18-20, 76-
79; GE 2-3)
Applicant graduated from high school in 1996. He attended a junior college in 2017
and then transferred to a four-year university, where he earned a bachelor’s degree  in
computer engineering in 2002. He earned a master’s degree in engineering management
in 2005. He worked for a DOD contractor from 2002 to 2007. He then worked for three
DOD contractors between 2007 and June 2018. Since then, he has worked as a computer
engineer  for  another  DOD  contractor.  He  was  first  granted  a  security  clearance  in
approximately August 2002. (Tr.  6-8, 19-23, 35-37, 40, 42; GE 1-3; AE G-H)
Under Guideline  H, the SOR alleged  that Applicant used  and  purchased  marijuana,
with  varying  frequency, from  approximately  1995  to  February  2015.  (SOR ¶¶  1.a-1.b)  It
also alleged  that  he  used  marijuana,  in  approximately  May  2003,  while  granted  access to
classified  information, and  in approximately  May  2013  and  February  2015,  while  holding
a   public  trust  position.   (SOR  ¶¶   1.c-1.d)  Under  Guideline   E,  the   SOR   alleged   that  he
falsified  his 2002  security  clearance  application  (SCA), by  failing  to  disclose  his prior drug
involvement.  (SOR  ¶  2.a) It  also  alleged  that he falsified  his  responses to  section  23  of
his July  2018  SCA,  by  failing  to  disclose  his use  and  purchase  of marijuana, and  by  failing
to  disclose  his 2003 marijuana  use  while  granted  access to  classified  information, as set
forth in  SOR ¶¶  1.a, 1.b, and  1.c, respectively.  (SOR ¶¶  2.b-2.d)
Applicant  experimented   with   marijuana   in  high   school;  he  used   it approximately
four times with  friends.  He used  marijuana  10  times while  in junior college, with  friends  or
on  his own.  He  significantly  increased  his marijuana  use  to  almost  daily  upon  joining  a
fraternity  while attending  university.  He used marijuana  with friends at parties and  on his
own.  He   and   members  of   his  fraternity   also   purchased   marijuana   from   a   fraternity
member’s friend, then  sold the  marijuana to  their college  friends. Sheriff’s officers visited
him   while   in  college   and   confiscated   “between   a   half  and   three-quarters  of  a   bag”  of
marijuana  from  his dorm  room.  He cooperated  with  the  officers and  they  did  not arrest
him. He  left  the  fraternity, disassociated  himself from  his  fraternity  friends, and  stopped
selling   marijuana   in  1999.  He  also   stopped   using   illegal  drugs,  with   the   exception   of
marijuana.   He   continued   to   use   marijuana,   decreasing   his  usage   over  time   until   he
stopped  in  February  2002,  six  months before  his  graduation. (Answer; Tr. at  23-27, 38-
41, 45, 64-68; GE 3-4)
Applicant completed his first SCA in May 2002. Although the 2002 SCA is not in
evidence,  he  recalled  completing  it.  He  recalled  the  questions  contained  therein
pertaining  to  drug  involvement.  He  admitted  to  omitting  his  drug  history.  He  had  just
graduated  from  college.  He  was  24  years  old.  He  did  not  take  the  security  clearance
process seriously. His past drug use embarrassed him. He did not want to jeopardize his
ability to obtain a security clearance by disclosing his drug history. (Tr. at 28-29, 40-41,
64; GE 4)
Applicant used marijuana again in May 2003. He was celebrating with friends on
the eve of his wedding, and he smoked from a marijuana joint that his friends shared. He
knew that he held a security clearance. He attributed this drug use to immaturity. (Tr. at
27-28, 41, 53-55, 68-69; GE 2-4)
In  March  2007,  Applicant  completed  a  questionnaire  for  non-sensitive  positions
(SF85) to obtain eligibility for a public trust position. As of the date of the hearing, this was
the only SF85 that he completed. Section 14 of that SF85 inquired only whether Applicant
had used, possessed, supplied, or manufactured illegal drugs within the past year. Since
he  had  not  used  illegal  drugs  in  2006,  he  truthfully  answered  that  question.  No  one
informed him that he had access to sensitive information after he completed the SF85.
He did not believe he worked with sensitive information. He did not receive annual security
training.  He  was  unaware  that  he  still  had  such  access  in  2013  and  2015.  When  he
completed another SCA in June 2018, as further discussed below, he did so through the
same  website  he  used  to  complete  his  SF85.  When  he  saw  his  completed  SF85,  he
realized  that  he  was  likely  granted  access  to  sensitive  information  in  2007,  and  he
estimated that he had such access for a period of between 10 to 15 years. (Tr. at 27-28,
42-44, 55-59, 65; GE 1-2, 4)
Applicant  used   marijuana   again  in   May   2013   and   February   2015,   while   he   had
access to  sensitive  information. In  May  2013, he used  marijuana  on  the eve  of a friend’s
wedding,  shared   by   friends   of  the   wedding   party.   He   used   marijuana   last   in  February
2015,  while  on  vacation  in Jamaica with  his  spouse. He smoked  from  a  marijuana  joint
that  beach-goers  shared.  He  also   purchased   and   smoked   a   marijuana   joint,   and   he
purchased  and  ate  a  marijuana  brownie.  As  discussed  above, he  was unaware that he
had  access to  sensitive  information  in  2013  and  2015.  (Tr.  at  27-28, 44-45,  51, 55-59,  69-
71; GE 2-4)
Applicant completed another SCA in July 2018.  Section 23 of that SCA inquired
about his illegal drug use and illegal drug purchase within the last seven years, as well
as any illegal drug use or drug activity while holding a security clearance. He knowingly
falsified his responses when he marked “No” and failed to disclose his relevant use and
purchase  of  marijuana,  as  well  as  his  2003  use  of  marijuana  while  holding  a  security
clearance. He anguished over it for several weeks. He discussed it with his spouse. He
sought  advice  from  an  attorney,  who  encouraged  him  to  correct  his  falsifications.  He
decided that he did not want to repeat his falsifications every time he was re-investigated,
and he was motivated to live by the advice he gives to his children to “be a man of their
word and not lie.” (Tr. at 29-37, 45-51, 59-64, 73-85; GE 2, 4)
In August 2018, Applicant notified his corporate facility security officer (FSO) that
he omitted information on his 2018 SCA. As directed, he then notified his local FSO. He
also notified one of his managers, who testified on Applicant’s behalf as further discussed
below, and this manager scheduled a meeting with his other managers. At this meeting,
he informed his managers that he “omitted some information off of my [SCA] and so we
talked  it over.” He disclosed  information regarding his drug use and his drug use while
holding a security clearance. They chose to retract his 2018 SCA, with the understanding
that he would complete another SCA in which he would disclose his drug involvement.
An authorized DOD background investigator did not interview him in 2018. (Tr. at 29-37,
45-51, 66, 73-76; GE 2-4; AE I)
Applicant has no regrets about coming forward, stating:
So, I’m  falling  on  the  sword trying  to  correct the  record. I feel like  I  cleansed
my  soul. I can  look back at my  kids with  a  pure heart and  a  clean  conscience
knowing  that I did the  right thing. I obviously  messed  up, I don’t deny  that
and   I’m   fixing   the   record  to   my   personal  detriment  financially   and
professionally. But I  feel supported  by  my  colleagues, my  friends, and  my
neighbors.
(Tr. at 36)
Applicant completed a third SCA in March 2019. He disclosed all of his prior drug
involvement, as discussed above. He was candid about his drug involvement during his
subsequent  interview  by  a  background  investigator  in  June  2019.  He  has  no  future
intentions to use illegal drugs. He stated that he has matured and he no longer socializes
with individuals who use or sell drugs. If he were to find himself in an environment where
drugs are present, he stated that he would remove himself from the situation. His spouse
is aware of his past drug involvement. He wants to continue to be a role model for his
children, respected by his peers and managers, and an active member of his community.
(Tr. at 64, 71-72, 76-85; GE 3-4; AE F)
Applicant is subject to random drug testing by his employer. As of the date of the
hearing, his employer had not yet selected him to report for such a test. He stated that he
voluntarily submitted to several drug tests through his doctor, and that he tested negative
for illegal drugs. In 2019, he provided the background investigator with two urinalysis tests
administered in January 2018 and May 2018 reflecting that he tested negative for illegal
drugs. (Tr. at 51-53; GE 4)
All of Applicant’s witnesses were aware of the SOR allegations, and they vouched
for  Applicant’s  trustworthiness,  integrity,  reliability,  and  judgment.  One  witness,  a
department head for a U.S. Government agency who has held a security clearance since
2007, has known Applicant since 2019. He referred to Applicant as a respected subject-
matter  expert  and  his  “go-to  guy.”  Another  witness,  who  has  worked  for  the  same
company as Applicant for 27 years, and who has held a security clearance for 20 years,
testified  that  he  has  known  Applicant  since  2018.  The  witness  testified  that  Applicant
served  under  his  supervision  from  2018  to  2022,  and  the  witness  was  one  of  the
managers to whom Applicant disclosed that he had falsified his 2018 SCA. The witness
scheduled  the  meeting  in  August  2018  with  Applicant  and  his  other  managers.  The
witness described Applicant as an excellent employee. Another witness who testified and
provided a letter of support was a retired U.S. Government civilian. This witness never
held a security clearance. This witness met Applicant in 2007, when Applicant was hired
as a contractor for the agency in which the witness worked. When the witness served as
a  branch  chief  in  2012,  he  oversaw  Applicant’s  work  assignments  until  2018.  He
described  Applicant  as  an  outstanding  colleague  with  exemplary  work  ethic  and
performance. A neighbor, close friend, fellow youth sports coach, and a lieutenant colonel
in the U.S. Air Force Reserve who also provided a letter of support, described Applicant
as a conscientious individual, willing to admit and correct his mistakes. (Tr. at 76-165; GE
4; AE F, I)
Applicant  also  provided  letters  of  support  from  four  individuals  who  attested,  in
2018,  to  his  trustworthiness,  integrity,  reliability,  and  judgment.  One  individual,  who
served as the chief operating officer for a defense contractor and who hired Applicant in
2014, attested to Applicant’s exemplary performance. Another individual, an Information
Technology Branch Chief who has known Applicant since 2013, stated that he granted
Applicant  elevated  user  privileges  as  a  computer  engineer.  This  individual  stated  that
Applicant  never  once  abused  his  heightened  privileges,  and  this  individual  would  not
hesitate to provide Applicant with the same level of access in the future. Two neighbors,
one of whom was a fellow youth sports coach and the other, a family friend for more than
30 years, described Applicant as a conscientious individual, willing to admit and correct
his  mistakes.  Performance  evaluations  from  2018  to  2021  reflect  that  Applicant’s
employer rated him favorably, noting that he is a strong performer who has demonstrated
high levels of leadership. He is an active member of his community. (GE 4; AE A-F)
