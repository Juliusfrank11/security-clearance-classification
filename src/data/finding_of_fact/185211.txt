Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations in his Answer with the exception of
SOR ¶ 1.d, which he denied. He is 30 years old. As of the date of the hearing, he was
single, he did not have any children, and he rented an apartment with a roommate since
approximately February 2021. (Answer; Tr. at 18-19, 38, 46; GE 1-2)
Applicant graduated from high school in 2011. He earned a bachelor’s degree in
psychology in May 2015. He attended classes towards a  master’s degree  from August
2016 to March 2017, but he had not yet earned that degree. He was unemployed after
college from May 2015 to September 2015, July 2016 to June 2017, February 2020 to
May  2020,  and  August  2020  to  February  2021.  He  completed  his  security  clearance
application  (SCA) in November 2020. As  of  the  date of  the  hearing,  he worked for his
employer,  a  DOD  contractor,  since  February  2021.  He  has  never  held  a  security
clearance. (Tr. at 5, 7-8, 18-19, 43, 46; GE 1-2)
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  used  and  purchased  marijuana,  with  varying
frequency, from approximately September 2013 to at least May 2021, and that he had not
committed to discontinue his marijuana use clearly and convincingly. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.b) It
also  alleged  that  he  used  and  purchased  hallucinogenic  mushrooms  twice  from
approximately April 2018 to June 2020, and that he used ecstasy in approximately April
2018. (SOR ¶¶ 1.c-1.e)
Applicant  first  used  marijuana  in  September  2013.  He  was  20  years  old  and  in
college. He spent about $40 every two to three weeks to purchase marijuana from college
friends,  and  he  used  it  with  those  friends  approximately  weekly.  He  stopped  using
marijuana as he approached his graduation date, because he knew he would be returning
to live with his parents and they would not permit marijuana use in their home. He used
marijuana during two periods when he did not live with his parents, from August 2016 to
March 2017 and January 2018 until August 2020. (Tr. at 21-31, 35-39, 49-50, 61-62; GE
1-2)
Sometime  in 2019, Applicant obtained  a  medical marijuana  card.  He obtained  a
medical  marijuana   card  after  he   read   that   marijuana   could   help  treat  the   neurological
disorder he has had  since  birth, and for which  he  was officially  diagnosed  at around age
11.  He sought  to  supplement  with  marijuana  the  medication  his doctor prescribed  him  for
his  disorder.   He  consulted   with   his  neurologist,  and   the   neurologist  advised   him   that
marijuana  could  not hurt to  try. He also enjoyed  using  marijuana  recreationally. He spent
around  $120  every  three  to  four weeks to  purchase  marijuana  from  a  dispensary  using
his  medical  marijuana   card,  and   he   used   marijuana   daily,  at  times,  for  almost  a   year.
When Applicant lived in state B from February 2020 to August 2020, he spent around $40
every three weeks to one month to purchase marijuana from his roommates, and he used
marijuana daily, at times. After he obtained a medical marijuana card, his parents’ attitude
toward his marijuana use somewhat changed, and they permitted him to use marijuana
in  their  backyard.  He  used  marijuana  while  he  resided  with  them,  from  approximately
August 2020 to February 2021. In his June 2021 response to interrogatories, he stated
that he last purchased marijuana in March 2021, from a marijuana dispensary. He also
stated in his response to interrogatories that he last used marijuana in May 2021, and
that his frequency of marijuana use up to that point was approximately once every two to
three weeks. He testified that he last used marijuana in approximately March 2022, and
that his medical marijuana card expired in May 2022. (Tr. at 21-31, 35-39, 49-59, 62-66,
68, 71; GE 1-2)
Applicant disclosed his marijuana use on his SCA.  In response to a question in
section 23 that inquired whether he intended to use it in the future, Applicant stated:
Honestly,  this  is  a   maybe.  If   my   employment  is  contingent  on   not  using
medical marijuana, then  I will fully  commit to  not using  it. However, due  to
its  medicinal   nature   and   the   fact  that   I   have   a   qualifying   condition,  if  my
employment   is  not   contingent   on   remaining   THC   free,  then   I  would   be
inclined to resume use.
(GE 1)
Applicant  indicated,  during  his  December  2020  interview  with  a  background
investigator,  that  he  would  not  use  marijuana  if  it  negatively  affected  his  chances  for
employment or a security clearance. He also indicated that if there were no issue with his
medical marijuana use, he would continue to use marijuana because he believed it helped
treat his neurological disorder.  He testified that at the time he  made the above-quoted
statement on his SCA, “my thinking was if I don’t have to stop, I wouldn’t like to because
I don’t personally see any -- I mean, it’s never affected my work . . ..” He testified, “. . . I
have stopped smoking marijuana in the last six months or so. And I’m willing certainly to
continue that.” (Tr. at 20-21, 31, 39; GE 1-2)
Applicant  testified  that  he  was  aware  when  he  completed  his  SCA,  when  the
background investigator interviewed him, and when he responded to the interrogatories,
that marijuana is illegal under federal law and that his illegal drug use raised concerns.
He acknowledged that he continued to use marijuana when he completed his SCA, in his
response  to  interrogatories,  and  since  receiving  the  SOR.  He  testified  that  he  was
unaware that illegal drug use was inconsistent with holding a security clearance. (Tr. at
20-21, 31, 39, 50-61, 70; GE 1-2)
Applicant  used  hallucinogenic  mushrooms  twice  between  April  2018  and  June
2020. He purchased it from friends on both occasions. He initially used it out of curiosity,
and then he used it again because he knew that he liked that it made him feel happy and
carefree. He purchased and used ecstasy once in April 2018, out of curiosity, and he did
not  like  how  it  made  him  feel.  He  testified  that  he  had  no  future  intention  of  using
hallucinogenic mushrooms or ecstasy. (Tr. at 39-43, 49-50, 66-68; GE 1-2)
Applicant testified that he submitted to a pre-employment drug test by his employer
in  February 2021,  and  that he  tested  negative  for illegal drugs.  He  stated  that he  was
subject to random drug testing by his employer, but he had not yet been selected for such
a  test.  He  testified  that  he  submitted  to  six  pre-employment  drug  tests  for  each  of  his
employers, and all tested negative for illegal drugs aside from one that was inconclusive
after he dropped the urine sample in the toilet. He maintained that the inconclusive test
would not have tested positive for illegal drugs had he not dropped it. He acknowledged
that he used marijuana during the periods leading up to, and in the periods after, each of
the pre-employment drug tests, to include the one administered by his current employer.
He testified, in reference to a pre-employment drug test administered to him in April 2020
when he lived in state B and was using marijuana daily, “I knew that I needed to clean up
as it were.” He testified that, aside from his marijuana use, he felt he has demonstrated a
consistent  pattern  of  employability  and  good  citizenship.  He  endeavored  to  be  honest
about his marijuana use, and stated that it never affected his work performance.  (Tr. at
31-36, 50-61, 66; GE 2)
Applicant  is  aware  that  his  roommate  uses  marijuana  “extremely  infrequently,”
although  he  has  never  witnessed  it,  and  that  his  roommate  had  products  containing
marijuana  in their apartment.  He has  two friends  who  also  use  marijuana  infrequently,
sometimes in his presence. As of the date of the hearing and since March 2022, he has
found himself in situations where marijuana was being used and where he was offered
marijuana, and he instead had a beer or entertained himself another way. He stated that
flower  containing  marijuana  and  marijuana-related
he  still  possessed  a  dried
paraphernalia. In September 2022, he signed a statement of intent not to abuse any drugs
in the future. He stated that as a showing of good faith and commitment,  he remained
abstinent  from  illegal  drug  use  and  he  removed  all  products  containing  marijuana  and
marijuana-related paraphernalia from his apartment. (Tr. at 47-50, 61-62, 66-72; AE A)
