Applicant is 52 years old and married to his third wife. Their marriage occurred in
January 2015. She is Korean and Applicant moved with his wife to Korea in early 2015.
He has six children, ranging in age from 34 to 6. The two youngest children live with him,
along with his wife’s two children. He is an honorably retired technical sergeant (E-6) from
the  United  States  Air  Force  (USAF).  Applicant  has  been  employed  by  a  defense
contractor  since September 2019  and  seeks to  retain  national security eligibility and  a
security clearance in connection with his employment. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections
13A, 15, and 17; Applicant Exhibit K; Tr. 26-27, 74.)
Applicant was on active duty with the USAF from December 1991 to September
2013, when he retired. After retirement, he worked in the oil industry until March 2015,
when he was laid off. He was unemployed from that time until he began work with his
current  employer. Applicant  stated that  his employment  situation  from 2015  to  2019  is
what caused his delinquent debt issues. Since becoming employed Applicant has worked
to resolve his past-due indebtedness. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 13A and 15; Tr.
22-24, 26-27.)
Applicant was divorced from his second wife in November 2014. The requirement
to pay child support after his lay off from the oil industry also affected his ability to repay
his other debts, as further described under 1.i, below. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section
17; Tr. 24.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he
therefore  potentially  unreliable,
untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Applicant
financially  overextended  and
is
admitted allegations 1.c, 1.h, and 1.i, under this guideline with explanations. He denied
the remaining allegations.
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  had  seven  charged-off  or  past-due  consumer
debts in the total amount of approximately $34,649. The existence and amount of several
of the debts is supported by credit reports dated October 9, 2019; and February 19, 2021.
They are also supported by Applicant’s answers on his e-QIP, and his statements to an
investigator from the Office of Personnel Management on July 1, 2020. Applicant is also
alleged to have not filed his Federal tax returns for tax years 2015 through 2019, and to
owe back child support of approximately $27,918. (Government Exhibits 1, 2, 3, 4, and
5.)
The current status of the debts is as follows:
1.a. Applicant denied that he owed $19,477 for an automobile loan that has been
charged off. This automobile was repossessed in February 2015 because Applicant lost
his job and could no longer afford to make payments. Applicant testified that he spoke
with the creditor several times over the telephone in 2020 in an attempt to resolve this
debt without success. There were also communication difficulties with the creditor due to
the Corona Virus pandemic and the fact that Applicant lives in South Korea. He provided
contemporaneous notes reflecting his contacts with the creditor. (Applicant Exhibit T; Tr.
21-23, 27-29, 66-68.) This debt is not resolved, but Applicant has been actively working
to resolve it.
1.b. Applicant has consistently denied that he owed a past-due debt to a telephone
company  in  the  amount  of  $2,062.  He  stated  that  he  did  not  know  of  this  debt  until
recently.  Applicant  explained  that  he  had  a  prepaid  phone  with  this  company  and  the
amount of $45 a month was automatically withdrawn from his account. The 2021 credit
report  submitted  by  the  Government  shows  this  debt.  The  Government’s  2019  credit
report,  and  Applicant’s  credit  report from  the same  year, do  not  show any debt  to  this
creditor. Applicant has recently attempted several times to contact this creditor without
success. (Government Exhibits 2 and 3; Applicant Exhibit T; Tr. 29-31, 63.) Based on the
state  of  the  record  I  find  there  is  insufficient  evidence  to  support  the  allegation  that
Applicant owes this debt.
1.c. Applicant admitted that he owed a collection account to a county government
in the amount of $341. Applicant stated in his Answer, during his July 2020 interview, and
in his testimony that he paid $70 a month on this debt until it was resolved. With regard
to this allegation the Government’s 2019 credit report stated, “Consumer disputes after
resolution.” This debt does not appear in the Government’s 2021 credit report. It also does
not appear in Applicant’s 2019 credit report. (Government Exhibits 2, 3, and 4; Applicant
Exhibit T; Tr. 31-33.) Based on the state of the record I find there is sufficient evidence to
support Applicant’s statements that he has resolved this debt.
1.d.  Applicant admitted that he owed a charged-off debt to a finance company in
the amount of $1,855. While admitting the existence of the debt he also stated that he did
not  open  it.  Rather,  Applicant  has  repeatedly  stated  his  second  ex-wife,  without  his
permission, took out this loan. This debt does not appear in the Government’s 2021 credit
report. Applicant provided documentation supporting his statement that he has attempted
to resolve this debt. (Government Exhibits 2, 3, and 4; Applicant Exhibit T; Tr. 33-34, 62.)
This debt is not resolved, but Applicant has been actively working to resolve it.
1.e.  Applicant  has  consistently  denied  that  he  owed  a  collection  agency  for  a
charged-off debt for a bank credit card in the amount of $580. He stated that he has never
had a credit card with this bank. With regard to this allegation  the  Government’s 2019
credit  report  stated,  “Account  information  disputed  by  consumer.”  The  Report  of
Investigation (ROI) from his interview with a Government investigator contains a read out
of  telephone  calls  Applicant  made  to  the  alleged  originating  bank  regarding  this  credit
card.  The  bank’s  representatives  and  Applicant  were  unable  to  confirm  this  particular
debt. (Governments Exhibit 2 and 4; Applicant Exhibit T; Tr. 35-37.) This debt is in dispute.
1.f.  Applicant  has  consistently  denied  that  he  owed  a  finance  company  for  a
charged-off debt in the amount of $9,819. He stated that he has never had an account
with  this  particular  creditor.  Applicant  stated  he  contacted  the  creditor  but  they  were
unable to find any information on him. This debt is found in the Government’s 2019 credit
report but is not found in the 2021 credit report. (Government Exhibits 2 and 3; Tr. 37-38,
63.) Based on the state of the record I find there is insufficient evidence to support the
allegation that Applicant owes this debt.
1.g.  Applicant  has  consistently  denied  that  he  owed  a  finance  company  for  a
charged-off debt in the amount of $515. He stated that he has never had an account with
this particular creditor and believes this account was opened fraudulently by his ex-wife.
He reported this to the creditor’s fraud department in 2020. The creditor investigated the
claim  and  came  to  the  conclusion,  “we  were  unable  to  find  evidence  of  unauthorized
activity.”  Applicant stated that he has a second dispute filed with this creditor since he
believes  they  made  a  mistake  with  the  original  one.  (Government  Exhibit  4;  Applicant
Exhibit U; Tr. 34-35.) This debt is not resolved, but Applicant has been actively working
to resolve it.
1.h. Applicant admitted that he had not filed his tax returns in a timely manner for
tax years 2015 through 2019. As stated earlier, Applicant was unemployed the majority
of  those  years,  living  in  Korea,  and  only  receiving  his  military  retirement  pay.  He  has
consistently stated that a financial adviser attached to the Air Force told Applicant in 2015
that he did  not have  to file tax returns if  his only income was  his retirement pay.  After
issuance of the SOR Applicant worked with a tax preparer to file all of his past-due returns.
The  tax  preparer  confirmed  this  fact  in  writing.  In  addition,  it  appears  that  Applicant’s
income would have fallen under the statutory minimum required for filing a tax return. For
example, Applicant provided documentation showing he made approximately $15,000 in
retirement pay in 2015. The statutory minimum for that year, as described by the IRS, for
a  married  taxpayer  filing  jointly  was  $20,600.  (Department  of  the  Treasury,  Internal
Revenue  Service,  Publication  501,  Exemptions,  Standard  Deduction,  and  Filing
Information,  Page  2,  Table  1:  2015  Filing  Requirements  Chart  for  Most  Taxpayers,
https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/p501--2015.pdf.) (Applicant Exhibits E, G, H, I, and P; Tr.
38-45, 56-62.)
1.i.  Applicant admitted owing a state child support arrears. The arrearage occurred
after Applicant lost his job in 2015.  However, he has provided documentation  from the
state attorney general’s office showing that the amount has been reduced from $27,918
when  the  SOR  was  issued  to  $17,208  at  the  time  of  the  hearing.  The  documentation
further shows that Applicant has been making consistent payments of $1,700 monthly to
cover  current  child  support  and  reduce  his  arrears.  (Government  Exhibits  4  and  5;
Applicant Exhibits C, D, E, and Q; Tr. 46, 64-66, 69-70.) This debt is being resolved.
Applicant’s  current  financial  status  is  stable.  Other than  the  accounts  described
above  he  has  no  other  delinquent  debt.  He  is  able  to  pay  his  current  debts  without
difficulty. The primary debt he is resolving is his child support arrearage, which is being
paid every month as described above. (Tr. 46, 49-50, 71.)
Applicant submitted evidence that he has been unable to access his credit report
online, due to the fact he lives overseas. He stated that this has impacted his ability to
resolve the alleged past-due indebtedness. (Applicant Exhibit F; Tr. 71-73.)
Mitigation
Applicant  submitted documentation  showing  that he is knowledgeable about  his
security responsibilities. (Applicant Exhibits L and M; Tr. 51-54.)
Applicant had a successful military career, as shown in his DD-214. He has also
received laudatory reviews in his current job, including a recent pay increase. (Applicant
Exhibits K, W, and X; Tr. 54-55.)
