In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted all of the allegations. His admissions are
adopted  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  review  of  the  pleadings  and  evidence,  I  make  the
following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 45-year-old employee of a federal contractor performing the duties
of  a  supply  technician.  He  began  working  at  his  present  job  in  December  2019.  He
previously worked for a federal contractor from 2009 until October 2017 when he was laid
off. He was unemployed for five to six weeks when he took a position with a substantial
pay cut. At the time of his lay off, he was earning approximately $65,000 yearly. When he
was hired after the layoff, he earned approximately $30,000 annually. He is a high school
graduate. He is married and has two adult children, one of whom still resides with him
and his wife. Applicant financially supports this child along with three grandchildren, ages
three, one, and an infant. (Tr. 6, 18-19, 21-23; GE 1)
The  SOR  alleged  15  delinquent  accounts  (credit  cards,  consumer debt,  a  time-
share debt, and medical debts) totaling approximately $52,752. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.o) The
debts are established by credit reports from October 2020, April 2021, and September
2022; Applicant’s personal subject interview (PSI) with an investigator in January 2021;
and his SOR admissions. (GE 2-5; Answer to SOR)
Applicant’s financial difficulties began  after he was laid off in 2017. Then he was
underemployed after his five-to-six-week layoff from 2017 until he was hired by his current
employer  in  2019.  He  started  at  the  salary  of  $63,000  in  2019.  He  also  has  been
supporting  his  daughter  and  her  three  children.  He  has  not  received  any  financial
counseling, but he developed his own plan to deal with his delinquent debts. That plan is
for him to save enough money to pay one debt at a time and then move to the next debt.
Using this plan, he has paid four debts (one was a non-SOR debt) and has an established
payment plan for a fifth debt. His wife works and makes approximately $100,000 per year,
but they keep their finances separate and he admitted that most of the SOR debt is his
alone. The exception is the time-share debt (SOR ¶ 1.n), which is a joint debt with his
wife. (Tr. 18-19, 23-24, 29-30, 32, 38, 42-43; GE 4)

payments. He claimed that he typically has approximately $300 left over at the end of the
month after paying all his bills. He has approximately $15,000 in a retirement account. He
uses a spreadsheet as a monthly budgetary tool. (Tr. 23-24, 26-27, 44, 53; AE D, E)
