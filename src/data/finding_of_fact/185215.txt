Applicant  is   a   42-year-old  employee   of   a   government  contractor.  With   the
exception   of  a   three-week  furlough   in   2013,  he   has   worked   continuously   for  this
contractor  or   a   predecessor  thereof   since   2006.   He   earned   a   high   school   diploma   in
1998. He  has  never been  married,  but has  resided  with  a  cohabitant since  2010.  He  is
financially   responsible   for  seven   minor  children;  three   of  whom   are  his  biological
children,   one   of  whom   is  his   cohabitant’s   child   from   a   prior  relationship,   and   three   of
whom  are  his cohabitant’s niece  and  nephews.  He has  held a  security  clearance  since
2007, and  has never received  a  warning  for a   security  clearance  violation.  (Tr.  23, 28-
32, 35-38;  GE  1, 6)
In  the  SOR,  the  Government  alleged  Applicant’s  15  delinquent  debts  totaling
approximately  $56,000  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.o).  These  delinquencies  consisted  of
insurance accounts,  vehicle  loans, utility accounts,  and personal loans, among others.
Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations  with  additional  comment,  with  the
exception  of  SOR  ¶¶  1.c,  1.h,  and  1.n,  which  he  denied  with  additional  comment.  He
neither  admitted  nor  denied  the  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  1.n,  so  I  have  treated  his  lack  of
response  as  a  denial.  His  admissions  are  adopted  as  findings  of  fact  and  are
corroborated by the Government’s 2022, 2021, and 2018 credit reports. (SOR; Answer;
GE 2-6)
The 2022 and 2021 credit reports listed the debt in SOR ¶ 1.g as paid prior to the
issuance of the SOR. This account is resolved in favor of Applicant. (Answer, GE 2, 3,
6)
Applicant denied the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c because he thought his insurance
should cover it. He claimed that he contacted the creditor of the debt in 2017 to file an
insurance claim that he thought would satisfy it. He claimed that the creditor told him he
did  not  have  the  necessary  insurance,  so  he  stopped  trying  to  address  this  debt.  He
provided no documentation corroborating these efforts, or corroborating that insurance
should  have  satisfied  the  debt.  The  debt  is  listed  as  delinquent  in  the  2022  and  2021
credit reports. (Tr. 54-56; Answer; GE 2, 3)
Applicant  claimed  that  the  debts  listed  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.f  and  1.h  are  duplicate
accounts because he only had one account with this creditor. He also claimed that he
believed that he paid the account in SOR ¶ f. He provided no documentary evidence to
corroborate these claims. Instead, the 2018 credit report listed two delinquent accounts
with  different  account  numbers,  different  balances,  and  different  dates  on  which  the
accounts were opened. The debts are listed as delinquent on the 2018 credit report with
a  last  action  date  of  2014  and  2013,  respectively.  Both  accounts  were  placed  for
collection more than six years ago, so it is possible that they aged off subsequent credit
reports.  Based  upon  the  foregoing,  I  conclude  that  Applicant  had  two  separate
delinquent accounts with this creditor and they are unresolved. (Answer; GE 4-6)
The  delinquent  personal  loan  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.n  is  listed  in  the  2018  credit
report as having been placed for collection. It has a last activity date of May 2013. As
the account was placed for collection more than six years ago, it is possible that it aged
off  subsequent  credit  reports.  Applicant  did  not  provide  documentary  evidence  to
support the account is resolved. (Answer; GE 4-6)
Applicant  claimed  that  he  would  resolve  his  SOR  debts  by  filing  a  petition  in
Chapter  7  bankruptcy.  He  has  yet  to  file,  but  he  claimed  the  he  has  retained  a
bankruptcy attorney, filled out the necessary paperwork and paid the fees to do so. He
claimed that he would have approximately $40,000 discharged through his bankruptcy
when the process is completed. He is waiting to file bankruptcy to avoid having it on his
credit  report  while  trying  to  locate  a  new  residence.  He  also  said,  without  providing  a
specified  reason,  that  he  has  been  waiting  until  his  security-clearance  adjudication  is
completed  to  file  bankruptcy.  He  acknowledged  that  he  decided  to  file  bankruptcy  in
January 2022, because  he realized  his security clearance  was  in jeopardy because of
his delinquent debts. He took the credit counseling class that is a prerequisite for filing a
bankruptcy petition. (Tr. 51-53, 57-58); Answer; GE 6)
Applicant claimed that he contacted the creditor of the debts listed in SOR ¶¶ 1.a
and  1.o  in  2014  or  2015  to  make  payment  arrangements,  but  he  could  not  reach  an
agreement because the  creditor wanted  him to pay more money than he could  afford.
These debts are unresolved. (Tr. 54-56)
Applicant  made  no  other  efforts  to  contact  the  creditors  or  dispute  any  of  the
remaining SOR debts. With the exception of SOR ¶ 1.g, he made no payments on the
SOR  debts  after  they  became  delinquent.  Other  than  SOR  ¶  1.g,  the  SOR  debts  are
established and unresolved. (Answer, Tr. 54-56; GE 2-6)
Applicant attributed  his financial  issues to  several causes.  He  had  a  three-week
furlough  in 2013, when  he  earned  no  income.  He claimed  that  not only  did this furlough
have  a  cascading  effect that detracted  from  his ability  to  pay  his debts,  it directly  led  to
his having   to  move   in  with   his father   and   to  falling   behind   on   the   debt   listed   in   SOR   ¶
1.d.  His cohabitant,  who  contributes  to  the  household finances,  has not  earned  as  much
money   as  he   has   and,  at   times,  has  been   unemployed.   His  cohabitant’s  63-year-old
mother resides with  them  while  only  providing  money  for the  water and  gas bill.  He has
had   to   take   out  short-term   payday   loans  in  order  to   meet  his  monthly   expenses,  and
then   was  unable   to   pay   some   of  these   payday   loans  pursuant   to   their   terms.   He
financially  supports seven  children.  He  also  acknowledged  that he  has mishandled  his
money   and   was  negligent  in   thinking   that  delinquent   debts   would  just   “go   away”  after
seven years.  (Tr. 32-35, 38-40, 54-55, 58;  Answer; GE 6)
Applicant’s  cohabitant  earns  about  $1,100  per  month  in  take  home  pay.
Applicant’s take home pay is about $3,400 per month. He pays $2,250 per month in rent
and $500 per month in utilities. In July 2021, he put $1,500 down on the purchase of a
used 2012 vehicle for $32,000. He pays $583 per month on it. He claimed that he tries
to  save  about  $100  to  $150  per  month;  however,  he  acknowledged  that  he  has  no
money in his savings account. He also acknowledged that most, if not all of his income,
is accounted for by his expenses. Applicant lived with his father from 2013 until August
2022,  when  he  moved  into  his  current  residence.  His  father  passed  away  in  August
2021. He does not expect to receive any inheritance from his father’s estate. (Tr. 40-50)
