In or about March 2019, while in the Army, Applicant used marijuana. He held a
security clearance at the time. His marijuana use led to the failure of a random urinalysis
test. Subsequently, he  received  non-judicial punishment under Article 15  of  the  Uniform
Code  of  Military  Justice  (UCMJ)  for the  offense  of  wrongful use  of  marijuana  –  detected  by
urinalysis, and  wrongful use  of  marijuana  –  not detected  by  urinalysis.  (Item  1  at 3)  During
a  follow-up  interview, Applicant admitted  using  marijuana  on  several occasions. (Item  6  at
2) He stated  that he  learned  his lesson  and  does not intend  to  use  marijuana  again.  (Item  2
at 4)
Applicant failed to disclose his use of marijuana and his non-judicial punishment for
failing a drug test, as required on his security clearance application of January 2021. In his
interview  with  an  investigative  agent,  he  said  that  he  failed  to  disclose  the  required
information because he forgot to include it. (GE 2 at 4) In his answer, he stated that he
“may have mistakenly selected the wrong button,” when completing the security clearance
application.” (Item 1 at 2)
