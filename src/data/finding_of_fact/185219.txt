In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  denied  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b,  and  2.b.  He
admitted SOR ¶ 2.a. He did not answer the cross-allegations at SOR ¶¶ 3.a and 4.a. He
included  a  brief  narrative  statement  with  his  answer.  Applicant’s  admission
is
incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 47 years old. He was married from 1999 until August 2013, when he
and  his  wife  divorced.  They  have  four  children,  all  born  between  1999  and  2005.
Applicant  has been  employed  in the defense  industry since  about 2007,  in  the field  of
logistics. He has worked for his current employer since August 2018. (Item 3)
On his June 2019 SCA, Applicant disclosed prior U.S. Government background
investigations in 2007 and 2012. He also disclosed that, in about January 2018, he had
a  security  clearance  eligibility  or  access  authorization  denied,  suspended,  or  revoked,
by an AGA. He reported that he had held a clearance without incident since 2007, but
that  the  AGA  had  revoked  his  access  to  a  particular  facility,  following  an  inconclusive
polygraph result. (Item 3 at 38-39)
Government  Item  4  is  a  Clearance  Decision  Statement  (CDS)  from  the  AGA,
dated  May  9,  2018.  The  CDS  notes  as  background  that  Applicant  had  held  access  to
sensitive compartmented information (SCI) since March 2008 through AGA 1, and then
was  indoctrinated  for  SCI  access  with  AGA  2  in  September  2014,  pending  final
adjudication. (Item 4 at 1)
Applicant  was  interviewed   by   AGA   2   counterintelligence   representatives  in
September  2014   and   January   2015   without  incident.   (Item   4   at  1)  During   a   third
interview, in February 2015, he revealed  the  following  security-significant information:
   Applicant advised  that  he  solicited  and  paid  a  prostitute  for  oral sex  three
times, once  in the  early  2000s, once  in 2009  or 2010, and  once   in spring
2013.  On   each   occasion,  he   went  to   an  area   known   to  be  frequented  by
prostitutes. A female approached his car at  a stop  light and  he  allowed  her
to   get   in.   They   drove   to   an   alley   and   she   performed   oral   sex   on   him,   for
which he paid  $20. (Item 4 at 2)  (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 3.a, 4.a)
   Applicant reported  a  history  of  excessive  alcohol consumption. His alcohol
consumption   was  moderate   until  2011   or  2012,  when   it  increased
significantly   after  he   learned   of  his  wife’s  infidelity.  He   would  become
intoxicated  twice weekly by  drinking  whiskey  and  vodka. On  one  instance
in winter 2012,  he passed out  on the  street in front  of his house. He  awoke
in bed after someone  helped him inside. (Item 4 at 2)  (SOR ¶¶ 2.b, 4.a)
   Applicant  also   acknowledged   that   on  five   or six   occasions  between   1990
(when   he   was  underage)  and   2014,  he   operated   a   motor  vehicle   while
knowingly  intoxicated. On  two  occasions in December 2014, he  consumed
whiskey  while driving. (Item 4  at 2)  (SOR ¶¶  2.a, 3.a, 4.a)
Applicant  had  a  fourth  interview in  July  2015.  It  revealed  no  security  significant
information.  He  had  a  fifth  interview  in  December  2018  that  revealed  the  following
information:
   Applicant  reiterated   facts  about  his  prior  solicitations   of  prostitutes,   as
discussed   above,  and   added   that  he   had   consumed   alcohol  in  his  car,
while   driving,   prior  to   the   2013   solicitation.   He  also  disclosed   that  he
similarly  solicited  and  paid a  prostitute  for oral sex, once  in 2015,  twice in
May  or June  2017, and  once  in July  2017, under similar circumstances to
those   as   previously   described   during   his  third   interview.  (Item   4   at  3-4)
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 3.a, 4.a)
   Applicant  also   acknowledged   searching   for  prostitutes  on   the   internet  in
January,  August,   October,   and   November  2017.  On   one   occasion,   he
exchanged one text message  with someone, but had second thoughts and
did not  follow through. (Item  4 at 3-4)  (SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 4.a)
   Applicant  said  he   had   not  consumed  alcohol to   intoxication   since  August
2013, and  had  not driven  while  impaired  by  alcohol since  December  2014,
when   he   drove   after  consuming   one   mixed   drink.  His  alcohol  use   since
August 2013 had remained consistent and “extremely light.” (Item  4  at 4)
AGA  1  subsequently  rescinded  Applicant’s  classified  access  and  he  was
debriefed in September 2017. (Item 4 at 1) A sixth interview, in February 2018, revealed
no information of significance. (Item 4 at 4)
As  part  of  an  interrogatory  from  DOHA,  Applicant  was  given  the  opportunity  to
review,  correct,  and  adopt  as  accurate  the  summaries  of  his  interviews  with  the  AGA
investigators,  discussed  above.  In  his  December  2021  response,  Applicant  affirmed
their accuracy without further comment. (Item 5)
Applicant  also  affirmed  the  accuracy  of  the  summary  of  a  security  clearance
background interview he had in September 2019  following his June 2019 SCA with an
agent  of  the  U.S.  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM).  During  that  interview,  he
discussed  the  fact  that  he  was  subject  to  two  polygraph  interviews  with  the  AGA.  He
asserted  that  he  was  told  that  one  of  the  interviews  was  inconclusive,  and  that  he
passed  the  other  one.  He  acknowledged  that,  in  January  2018,  he  was  told  that  the
AGA had revoked his access.  Unlike in his interviews  with the AGA, in his September
2019 OPM interview, Applicant did not address his prior engagement with prostitutes or
his history of alcohol involvement. (Item 5 at 8)
In  his  December  2021  interrogatory  response,  Applicant  provided  updated
information about his alcohol consumption. He said he no longer consumed alcohol and
did not intend to do so in the future. He said the last time he drank to intoxication was
“years ago” after he  learned  of  his wife’s infidelity. He could  not recall  the  last  time  he
drove under the influence of  alcohol. He  denied having been charged with any DUI or
DWI offenses and none were revealed elsewhere in the record.  Applicant also said he
had not solicited or engaged in sexual acts with a prostitute since July 2017. (Item 5)
Under  Guideline  D,  Applicant  denied  SOR  ¶  1.a,  which  alleged  that  between
2010 and July 2017, he engaged in sexual activity with prostitutes while granted access
to classified information. He also denied SOR ¶ 1.b, which alleged that during 2017, he
searched internet personal ads for prostitutes on multiple occasions. (Item 2)
Under  Guideline  G,  Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶  2.a,  which  alleged  that,  from
summer  2014  to  December  2014,  he  drove  on  multiple  occasions  while  under  the
influence of alcohol, and while consuming alcohol. He denied SOR ¶ 2.b, which alleged
that  from  late  2011  to  about  September  2013,  he  drank  alcohol  to  intoxication  about
twice a week, and that once in 2012, he was so intoxicated that he passed out on the
street  in  front  of  his  home.  (Item  2)  Applicant  did  not  answer  the  cross-allegations,
under Guidelines J and E. (Item 2)
Applicant  offered  no  explanation  or  specifics in  answering  the  SOR  allegations,
except the following statement:
This   was  coerced   by   the   polygrapher.  What   I  did  do   was  from   the   past
where  I  made   mistakes  like   any   human   being.  I  had   something   serious
the   gentleman   who   was  very
to
going   on,  which
I   explained
unprofessional.  I   DO   NOT  request   a   hearing.  (Item   2)  (Emphasis  in
original)
Applicant did not elaborate and did not respond  to  the  Government’s FORM, so
he provided no additional information in mitigation.
