Criminal Conduct
SOR  ¶  2.a  alleges  and  Applicant  admitted  he  was  charged  with  rape.  (SOR
response) However, he denied that he raped Ms. A. Court records indicate in July 2019,
he as indicted based on a grand jury true bill; he was arraigned; and in October 2019, the
charge  was  nolle  prosequi.  (GE  5  at  3)  There  was  a  search  warrant  for  the  sheets
because Ms. A described the sheets and said he ejaculated on the sheets after the rape.
(GE 6) Applicant denied that he ejaculated on the sheets. (Tr. 81; GE 6 at 3, 9) The police
found  the  sheets Ms. A  described  in Applicant’s washer  when the search warrant was
executed. (GE 6 at 9) Applicant said the police did not have his DNA or other physical
evidence to corroborate Ms. A’s allegation of rape. (Tr. 25, 68, 81-82) Ms. A was present
for one court hearing; she failed to appear at court for the next hearing; and the charge
was dismissed. (Tr. 25) Applicant was in jail for nine months. (Tr. 25) He was reinstated
at his job. (Tr. 71)
Applicant said a week before he met Ms. A, he applied for a passport because he
was planning a trip outside the country. (Tr. 24) He did not provide a copy of his passport
application. He met Ms. A through an online account. (Tr. 56) Ms. A was 38 years old.
(Tr. 56) He met Ms. A for the first time in person at a gym in February 2019, and she went
to his residence, where he received oral sex from her. (Tr. 21, 56, 72-74) The following
day, he purchased the parts to repair Ms. A’s brakes on her car, and he went to Ms. A’s
residence to work on the brakes of her car. (Tr. 21-22, 57-58) The third day, Ms. A came
to Applicant’s residence around midnight to watch a movie. (Tr. 58) She went outside of
his house to smoke marijuana. (Tr. 77) He said Ms. A was intoxicated when she was at
his residence. (Tr. 57-58) Even though he had fixed her brakes the previous day, it “never
crossed his mind” that she was coming over to his residence to engage in sexual activity
with him. (Tr. 89-90)
Ms. A said that she and Applicant were in bed watching a movie, and he put her
hand on his penis. (GE 6 at 6) She told him that she was not doing that, and he said, “I’ll
be  damned.” (Id.) Applicant got on top of her, pulled her pants down, pushed her legs
apart, and engaged in sexual intercourse with her against her will. (Id.) She screamed
and yelled that she did not want Applicant to have sexual intercourse with her. (Id.)
Applicant  denied  that  he  put  her  hand  on  his  penis,  climbed  on  top  of  her, and
engaged in sexual intercourse with her. (Tr. 75-77) He said she slept on his sofa, and she
did not sleep in his bed. (Tr. 87) He did not explain why she engaged in oral sex with him
and then two days later refused his sexual advances. (Tr. 77-78)
Applicant said he went to the restroom to take a shower, and when he came back
into the room where he left his wallet, he noticed his wallet had moved. (Tr. 22, 59, 78)
He believed Ms. A had gone through his wallet; he checked the contents of his wallet;
and he noticed one of his bank cards was missing from his wallet. (Tr. 22, 78) He accused
Ms. A of taking his bank card. (Tr. 22)
In response to Applicant’s accusation, Ms. A said “you don’t believe me, then I’ll
strip for you, and show you I ain’t got it.” (Tr. 22) Ms. A took off her pants; she pulled down
her panties; she pulled up her shirt; and his credit card fell out from under her bra strap
onto the floor. (Tr. 23, 78-79) Applicant did not explain why Ms. A would lift up her shirt if
she knew his bank card was under her bra strap. Ms. A put her clothes on and ran out of
his residence. (Tr. 23, 80-82)
At about 7:00 a.m., Ms. A backed her car into the street, and she hit another car
that Ms. B was driving down the street. (Tr. 23, 59, 83) Applicant said Ms. A drove away
without  telling  Ms.  B  her  contact  information.  Applicant  advised  Ms.  B  about  Ms.  A’s
contact information. (Tr. 23) About three minutes later, Ms. A drove back to Applicant’s
residence and almost hit him with her vehicle. (Tr. 23, 83) According to Applicant, Ms. A
complained about him providing information to Ms. B, she said “you so-and-so, you gave
my f’n information to that lady.” (Tr. 83) Ms. A continued, “. . . well you gave the lady my
information. I’m going to tell the police you raped me.” (Tr. 23, 81, 84) He did not know
whether Ms. B heard Ms. A make this threat. (Tr. 84)
Police  officers  went  to  Applicant’s  residence  because  of  a  report  of  an  accident
with no injuries. (GE 6 at 3) Ms. A told the police that she stayed overnight at Applicant’s
residence; he made sexual advances; she told him to stop; he got on top of her, pulled
down her pants; and raped her. (Id.) The police report does not mention where Applicant
was  located  when  the  police  were  getting  the  initial  report  from  Ms.  A.  (Id.)  Later  the
morning of accident, the police searched Applicant’s residence. (Id. at 5) Applicant was
not present during the search. (Id. at 6)
A  few  hours  later,  the  sheriff’s  office  called  Applicant,  advised  him  of  Ms.  A’s
allegations, and asked him what happened. (Tr. 24; GE 6 at 7) He denied that anything
happened except Ms. A hit Ms. B with  Ms. A’s vehicle. (Tr. 61, 91) The  sheriff’s office
asked  him  to  come  to  their  office;  Applicant  said  he  would  be  there  in  20  minutes;
Applicant contacted an attorney; and his attorney advised him that he did not need to go
to the sheriff’s office. (Tr. 24, 84; GE 6 at 7)
Shortly after the alleged  rape, Applicant  sent  Ms. A several texts  apologizing to
her. (Tr. 86) Copies of the texts are not part of the record, and Applicant said he did not
retain  copies  of  the  texts.  (Tr.  87)  He  said  he  sent  the  texts  to  show  he  was  being
reasonable and holding his cool. (Tr. 87)
A warrant for his arrest was issued; however, Applicant said he was unaware a
warrant had been issued until after he had already started his trip to another country. (Tr.
24, 60, 62) The September 10, 2020 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) personal
subject interview (PSI) states Applicant’s brother told him about the arrest warrant before
he left the jurisdiction where the arrest warrant was issued. (GE 8 at 5) At his hearing, at
first,  he  said  he  bought  his  airline  ticket  with  his  bank  card.  (Tr.  85)  Then  he  said  his
brother’s fiancé bought the ticket online. (Tr. 86) He flew out of the state where he is a
resident four days after the arrest warrant was issued. (Tr. 85) He could have cancelled
his flight and returned to his state of residence. (Tr. 62) At his hearing, he admitted that
he  elected  to  continue  his  trip  after  he  learned  of  the  warrant.  (Tr. 24,  61-62)  He  was
arrested at an airport where he was going to take a connecting flight outside the country.
(Tr. 24, 61-62) He spent 28 days in jail in the state where he was arrested before he was
extradited  back  to  his  residence  state.  (Tr.  64)  He  was  denied  bail  because  he  was
considered a flight risk. (Tr. 64) He denied that he was fleeing to avoid an arrest. (Tr. 24)
He said he was planning to return from the foreign country. (Tr. 63) He did not have a
reservation for a hotel in the foreign country, and he did not have a ticket for a return flight
to the United States. (Tr. 63)
Applicant believed Ms. A went through his wallet while he was in the shower and
had  written  down  his  credit  card  numbers.  (Tr.  22)  Several  weeks  after  the  incident
involving Ms. A, he noticed $400 in charges on one of his accounts, and he believed that
Ms.  A  made  them.  (Tr.  68-69)  He  did  not  tell  the  police  that  he  believed  Ms.  A  had
committed a $400 larceny. (Tr. 68) He did not pay the $400 bill. (Tr. 69) He said Ms. A
lied about her place of employment. (Tr. 88-89)
Credibility
In  1987,  when  Applicant  was  16  or  17  years  old,  he  was  arrested  for  three
allegations  of  second  degree  burglary  based  on  his  breaking  and  entering  into
commercial  establishments  to  steal  appliances  and  televisions.  (Tr.  65;  GE  8  at  6)  In
1988, he was convicted and sentenced to 10 years in jail. (Id.) He served about four years
in jail. (Id.)
In  1998,  Applicant  was  arrested for making a  false  statement,  a felony offense,
when  he  applied for a concealed  carry permit  because  he failed  to disclose  his felony
conviction  in  1988.  (GE  8  at  6)  He  was  subsequently  convicted  of  making  a  false
statement. (Id.) He was sentenced to pay a fine, and he was placed on probation. (Id.)
Section  22  of  Applicant’s  April  12,  2018  SCA  asked  “Have  you  EVER  been
charged with any felony offense?” (GE 1 at 26 (emphasis in original)) Applicant answered,
no, and did not disclose these felony charges. (Id. at 27) He said he did not disclose his
felonies because he thought they did not meet the reporting criteria.  (GE 8 at 6)
