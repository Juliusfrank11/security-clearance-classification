The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  has  six  delinquent  debts,  with  approximately
$112,000 in delinquencies. He disclosed that he incurred major business losses. He was
earning $600,000, but due to the downturn in the economy, his income adjusted down to
$200,000. (Item 3) He paid his employees and maintained his contractual obligation. He
took no income from the business and lived on his social security. The loss of  income
was not due to any behavioral irresponsibility on subject’s part. (Item 3)
Applicant attributes his financial situation  to  a  large  reduction  in personal income
due  to  business  losses.  His business  did  not  survive. The  Covid pandemic exacerbated
his financial distress, which delayed the sale of his home in October 2020. His income  in
2020  was  $20,000  and  increased  to  $138,720  in  2021. Applicant sold his  house,  cut his
