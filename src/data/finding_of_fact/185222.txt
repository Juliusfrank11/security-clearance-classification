Applicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He served on active
duty in the U.S. military from 1987 to 1991, in another branch of the military from 1991
to  1999,  and  back  to  the  first  branch  from  1999  until  he  retired  with  an  honorable
discharge in 2013. He seeks to retain a security clearance, which he has held since he
served in the military. He has a bachelor’s degree  earned  in  1996.  He married in 2003
and  divorced  in  May  2019.  He  married  his  current  wife  in  2021.  He  has  two  children,
ages 17 and 15. (Tr. at 20-26, 44, 49, 54; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  owned  his  own  consulting  business  after  his  retirement  from  the
military.  He  had  a  significant  downturn  in  about  2017  to  2018  because  he  lost  his
eligibility  for  access  to  sensitive  compartmented  information  (SCI)  over  an  issue  that
was resolved in 2018. In about November 2019, the three government programs he was
supporting through his company were either cancelled or cut to the point where he was
no longer funded. He was essentially unemployed and unable to receive unemployment
compensation  because  of  his  military  retirement  pay.  Then  in  2020,  the  COVID-19
pandemic hit, which affected his ability to find a contract. He received disability pay from
the  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs,  but  his  military  retirement  went  to  his  ex-wife  for
alimony and child support. He lived off loans and credit cards, and then he was unable
to  pay  the  balances.  He  obtained  a  contractor  job  in  May  2020  at  a  lower  salary.  He
obtained a better-paying job in September 2020 and his current job in September 2022.

The  SOR  alleges  four  delinquent  debts  totaling  about  $98,658.  Applicant
admitted owing all of the debts at one time, but several of the debts have been settled.
Applicant contracted with a debt-settlement company in April 2020 to assist him
in resolving his debts. He enrolled five debts, totaling $97,964,  in the  company’s debt-
resolution program (DRP). Applicant agreed to make monthly payments of $1,272 to the
debt-settlement  company  to  be  held  in  an  escrow  account.  The  debt-settlement
company  agreed  to  negotiate  settlements  with  his  creditors  and  use  the  accumulated
funds in the escrow account, minus their fees, to pay the settlements. Applicant made
most of the monthly payments. By November 2022, his deposits totaled $37,082. (Tr. at
17, 29-30, 47; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2)
Applicant enrolled a $3,440 debt in the DRP. The debt was settled with a lump-
sum  payment  of  for  $2,204  in  January  2021.  That  debt  was  not  alleged  in  the  SOR
because  it  was  resolved  long  before  the  SOR  was  issued.  (Applicant’s  response  to
SOR; GE 3-5)
A  $7,243  debt  was  settled  for  $4,394,  through  monthly  payments  of  $120  from
January 2021 through April 2021, followed by monthly payments of $652, with the final
payment made in October 2021. This debt was alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a with a balance of
$2,928, based on a December 2021 credit report. The credit reports in evidence show
the  balance  going  down.  The  debt  was  resolved  before  the  SOR  was  issued,  but  the
December  2021   credit   report  did  not  reflect   the   most  recent  payments.   (Tr.  at  26-32;
Applicant’s response  to SOR; GE 3-5)
SOR  ¶ 1.c alleges a $14,022 debt to a  credit  union. The debt was  listed with  a
$19,982  balance  in  the  July 2020  credit  report;  $16,025  in  the  September 2021  credit
report;  and  $14,022  in  the  December  2021  credit  report.  The  debt  was  settled  for
$8,012, through monthly payments of $667 from March 2021 through the final payment
in January 2022. (Tr. at 34-36; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3-5)
The  debts alleged  in  SOR ¶¶  1.b  ($14,353)  and  1.d  ($67,355) are enrolled  in  the
DRP.  As  of   November  2022,  the   balance   in   the   escrow   account   was  $15,802.  The
$67,355  debt  is the  next debt  to  be  settled once  sufficient funds  have  been accumulated
in the  escrow  account.  (Tr. at 18,  32-34, 36-38, 48; Applicant’s response  to  SOR;  GE  3-
5)
Applicant stated that his finances have improved. He is well compensated in his
current job. His wife works and pays part of the household expenses. His obligation to
pay  alimony  to  his  ex-wife  ends  next  summer.  He  owes  the  IRS  about  $6,000  for  tax
year 2021. He does not have a formal installment plan, but he has been making $300
payments. He expected to earn a bonus, which he planned  to use to pay off his taxes.
He  credibly  testified  that  he  plans  to  continue  to  pay  his  taxes  and  the  DRP  until  his
taxes  and delinquent debts are  resolved.  He  received  advice  from  the debt-settlement
company, but no formal financial counseling. (Tr. at 18-19, 22, 25, 39-50)
