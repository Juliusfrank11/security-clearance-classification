Applicant contracted with a debt-settlement company in October 2019, more than
two years before the SOR was issued. He notified his security office about his situation.
He  enrolled  29  debts,  totaling  $92,750,  in  the  company’s  debt-resolution  program
(DRP).  Applicant  agreed  to  make  monthly  payments  of  $1,556  to  the  debt-settlement
company  to  be  held  in  an  escrow  account.  The  debt-settlement  company  agreed  to
negotiate  settlements  with  his  creditors  and  use  the  accumulated  funds  in  the  escrow
account, minus their fees, to pay the settlements. (Items 1-3; AE A-G)

The  debt-settlement  company  had  an  arrangement  with  a  bank.  In  June  2022,
Applicant  borrowed  $17,950  from  the  bank,  which  was  used  by  the  debt-settlement
company  to  settle  the  remaining  14  accounts  in  the  DRP.  He  is  repaying  the  loan
through  monthly  payments  of  $925.  He  has  made  all  of  the  required  payments.  He
hopes  that his actions have  established that his financial affairs  are  back  in order and
that he is qualified to retain his security clearance. (Items 1; AE C-G)
