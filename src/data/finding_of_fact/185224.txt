Applicant is 33 years old.  In 2012, he  earned  a  bachelor’s degree  in aerospace
engineering, and in 2016, he earned a master’s degree. He has never married and does
not  have  any  children.  Since  October  2021,  he  has  been  employed  for  a  government
contractor as a structural design engineer. His annual salary is approximately $93,500.
He does not possess a DOD security clearance. (GE 1; Tr. 15-18, 22-23, 41)
Financial
The SOR alleges two delinquent accounts totaling $24,184, as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges that Applicant is indebted to a bank for a credit card balance
charged off in the amount of $19,782. He obtained a credit card to build up his credit while
he  was  attending  college.  Over  the  years  he  overspent  and  was  unable  to  make
payments, especially after his arrest in 2019 for driving under the influence (DUI). In May
2021, he hired a consumer credit company and in September 2022, they were able to
settle the  debt  with  the  creditor for about $10,500. After the  settlement  was  approved,
Applicant made two payments of $349.48 to the consumer credit company for payment
to the creditor. He estimated that the settlement would be paid in full in about 30 months.
He did not provide any documentation. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 18-21, 42-44, 47-48,
60)
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges that Applicant is indebted to a bank for a credit card balance
charged off in the amount of $4,402. He testified that he had obtained a second credit
card to help him pay off his original credit card debt, as cited above. Again, he could not
make  payments  to  the  creditor  following  his  2019  DUI  arrest,  because  the  financial
consequences  of  his  arrest  depleted  his  savings.  He  was  also  unable  to  include  this
delinquent account with the consumer credit company for management. In August 2022,
he initiated contact with the creditor, but he has been unable to negotiate a settlement or
a  payment  plan.  Contrary  to  his  testimony,  Applicant  disclosed  in  his  February  2022
Answer that he had “accepted a settlement offer of the debt, to be paid over 10 months
at $316 per month.” This debt remains unresolved. (Tr. 21-22, 45-49; Answer)
Applicant testified that he is current with his mortgage payment and utilities. He
does not have a family to support and his car has been paid off. He reported that after
paying his monthly expenses, he has about a $1,000 monthly net remainder. He had to
pay attorney fees of approximately $5,000 following his two DUI arrests. He has about
$175,000 invested in his 401k, $5,000 invested in stocks, and approximately $2,000 in
savings. He has not participated in a financial counseling program.  After the hearing, I
requested Applicant complete a PFS so that I could have a better understanding of his
finances. He did not submit documentation, to include the PFS, while the record was held
open for two weeks. (Tr. 23-26, 44-45, 50)
Alcohol and Criminal Conduct
Applicant was arrested in September 2019 and charged with DUI. (SOR ¶ 2.a)  He
testified that he had been with friends drinking alcohol and watching football all day. He
estimated that he had about seven beers and a couple of shots of whiskey. He thought
he was fine to drive home, but he got a flat tire and pulled his car over to the side of the
road. The police arrived, smelled alcohol, and asked Applicant to perform a field sobriety
test. He failed the test and was arrested. While the court evaluated his case for placement
into a diversion program, he was arrested for a second DUI, as set forth below. The court
denied  his  diversion  and  merged  the  two  cases  together.  In  December  2020,  he  was
found guilty and sentenced to six months in jail, suspended, fined $1,551, and placed on
one year of probation. He was also ordered by the court to complete outpatient alcohol
treatment. (Tr. 27-29, 31, 33-34)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  March  2020  and  charged  with  DUI  and  driving  while
license suspended or revoked. (SOR ¶ 2.b)  Applicant went to a bar to celebrate a friend’s
birthday.  He  consumed  alcohol,  and  when  he  attempted  to  leave,  he  hit  another  car
parked on the street with the doors open. The police were called and he failed the field
sobriety test. He registered .138% blood alcohol content (BAC) on the breathalyzer. His
2020 case was merged with the 2019 case, as set forth above. (Tr. 50-51; GE 5)
Applicant  started  alcohol  treatment  in  about  May  2020.  He  testified  that  he
successfully completed the alcohol treatment in June 2022, but he had to be readmitted
into the program after several months had passed without treatment. He was diagnosed
with alcohol use disorder. Applicant continued to use alcohol against medical advice until
October  2020,  when  he  last  consumed  alcohol.  Since  that  time,  he  has  completely
abstained from using alcohol. He does not use the services of Alcoholics Anonymous or
any  other  alcohol  support  group  to  maintain  his  sobriety.  He  is  required  to  have  an
interlock device installed on his car until April 2023. (Tr. 35-40, 51-52, 56-58)
Applicant first started consuming alcohol at the age of 16. He started to regularly
consume alcohol, drinking several beers at one sitting, at the age of  22. He estimated
that he consumed about 20 beers per week. Following his first DUI arrest in 2019, he did
not stop consuming alcohol, as requested by his attorney, but he did moderate his alcohol
use. After his second DUI arrest in 2020, he continued drinking for about seven months
until October 2020, when he made a decision to completely abstain from using alcohol.
