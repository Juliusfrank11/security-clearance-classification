Applicant is 63 years old and has been married and divorced twice. His second
marriage ended in 2012. He has no children. Applicant has earned a bachelor’s degree
and a master’s degree. He has been employed by a defense contractor as an engineer
since November 2020. He is a first-time applicant for a security clearance. (Tr. at 17-19;
GE 1 at 7, 13-14, 22-24, 41-43.)
Guideline F, Financial Considerations
The  Government  alleged  in  the  SOR  that  Applicant  is  ineligible  for  access  to
classified information because he failed to meet his financial obligations and is therefore
potentially  unreliable  and  untrustworthy.  Specifically,  the  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant
failed to timely file his Federal tax returns for the last ten tax years (TYs), i.e., TYs 2012
through 2021 (SOR ¶ 1.a); and failed to timely file his state tax return for at least TY 2020
(SOR ¶ 1.b). In the Answer, Applicant admitted both allegations and provided additional
information.
The  underlying  facts  and  the  status  of  the  matters  set  forth  in  the  SOR  are  as
follows:
1.a. Failure to timely file Federal tax returns for TYs 2012 through 2021. Applicant
and  his  second  wife  separated  at  the  end  of  2011.  He  described  the  separation  as
“unexpected.”  They  divorced  in  2012.  The  termination  of  what  had  been  a  ten-year
relationship with six years as a married couple was difficult for Applicant and affected him
greatly. Applicant took time off in 2011 and took an extended vacation for most of 2011.
He began working as a senior engineer in November 2011. He worked with that employer
until February 2014. (Tr. at 8, 32; GE 1 at 18; GE 2 at 3.)
Applicant did not file his Federal tax returns for TYs 2012 and 2013. He claimed
that his failure to file was due to his emotional turmoil following his divorce. He lived in
State A at that time, which had no state income tax. Accordingly, no state tax filing was
required.  (Tr. at 8-9, 12-14, 22-23, 32-33.)
In  early  2014,  Applicant  accepted  a  position  to  work  in  Canada  for  a  Canadian
company (Company 1). He relocated from State A to a nearby location in Canada that
was about 15 miles across the border of State A in February 2014 and began his new
position  as  a  senior  engineer.  From  February  2014  until  February  2016,  he  was  an
employee  of  Company  1.  In  February  2016,  he  began  working  as  a  contractor  for  a
second Canadian firm (Company 2). His Canadian work permit expired in 2018, and he
returned  to  the  United  States  and  continued  working  for  Company  2  remotely.  He
completed his work responsibilities in November 2019 and needed to look for a new job.
He earned the equivalent of about USD 60,000 per year while working for Companies 1
and 2. (Answer; Tr. at 13-14, 19-22, 26, 34; GE 1 at 16-18, 23.)
Applicant began a  job search in the  United  States. Shortly  thereafter, the  COVID-
19  pandemic shutdown began, making  it difficult to  find  a  job. In  November 2020, he  was
hired  by  Company  3, a  DoD contractor  and  his clearance  sponsor, and  began  working  in
State B. He was unemployed  from November 2019 until  November 2020. (Tr. at 27.)
His first Canadian employer, Company 1, withheld taxes for Canadian income tax
purposes. As noted, Applicant worked for Company 2 as a contractor. Company 2, which
withheld no Canadian taxes, and Applicant was responsible for paying his own Canadian
taxes for TYs 2016 to 2019 when he worked as a contractor. Applicant paid no estimated
taxes to the U.S. Government while working for either Canadian company. (Tr. at 22-24,
26, 34.)
Applicant did not file U.S. Federal income tax returns for the tax years when he
was living in Canada, i.e., TY 2014 through TY 2018. He explained that though he knew
that he needed to file tax returns in the U.S. while  he was living in Canada, he did not
know how to do so and did not know whom to contact for help. In addition, he filed no
income  tax  returns  with  the  Canadian  authorities  during  the  years  that  he  worked  in
Canada and paid no taxes to the Canadian Government  other than the taxes withheld
from his paychecks by Company 1. (Tr. at 22.)
In  2020,  Applicant  worked  for  Company  3  for  a  couple  of  months.  Applicant
retained a tax attorney in January 2021 to help him file his TY 2020 U.S. and state  returns
and his delinquent U.S. tax returns. He claimed at the hearing that he was determined to
resolve this long-standing problem. However, his attorney advised that she would not file
any returns until he provided her with all of the necessary tax information for all of the tax
years since TY 2012. Applicant claimed that he has made considerable efforts to obtain
the documentation required by the attorney, but he has encountered serious difficulties
due to the number of years involved. One significant problem he faces is that Company
1 is no longer in business, and he is unable to obtain any income information. (Tr. at 8-9,
14-16, 29-30.)
In June 2022, Applicant received from the IRS Account Transcripts for TYs 2012
through 2021. The transcripts confirm that he has filed no tax returns for the past ten tax
years.  The  transcripts  provide  all  of  Applicant’s  income,  withholding  and  related  tax
information from his U.S.  employers  contained  in  his W-2s for TY 2012  through  2014,
2020,  and  2021.  Applicant  was  not  specific  as  to  whether  he  needed  any  additional
information for those tax years to provide his tax attorney with the information she needed
to file returns for those years. He testified that his returns  in the past were very simple
and  could  be  filed  using  the  IRS’s  simplified  Form  1040  EZ  with  his  income  and
withholding information.  He believed that his U.S. taxes when he was living and working
in Canada were complicated and he could not prepare them himself as he had done in
the past. He could not find a tax preparer in Canada who could help him with his U.S. tax
returns. (Tr. at 24-28; GE 2 at 39-51, 71-77.)
Applicant expressed frustration with his tax attorney and her unwillingness to file
Federal tax returns for TYs 2020 and 2021 covering the income he earned in the United
States while working at his current job. He had all of the necessary documents. He does
not understand why the two most recent Federal returns have not been filed, though he
admitted he has never asked his lawyer that question. He believes that even though he
paid her for her services, it may be necessary for him to find a new tax advisor to prepare
his recent returns. He admitted that she has not done anything for about two years. (Tr.
at 27-30, 38-40, 44.)
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  was  unaware  about  how  the  U.S.  Government  taxes
foreign-earned income of U.S. citizens who live and work in another country. His attorney
has not explained to him how the U.S. foreign-earned income tax exclusion works and
how that exclusion would significantly reduce or eliminate his U.S. tax liability for the years
he lived and worked in Canada. He believes he owes about $40,000 in back taxes to the
IRS  for  the  four  years  he  worked  for  Company  2  as  a  contractor  (TYs  2016-2019),
exclusive of interest and penalties. He presently has about $51,000 in savings available
to pay his delinquent taxes. (Tr. at 31, 34-36; GE 2 at 15.)
1.b.  Failure to timely file state  income tax return for at least  TY 2020. Applicant
wrote in the Answer that he intends to file his TY 2020 tax return in State B in 2022. As
of the hearing date, he had not yet filed either his TY 2020 or his TY 2021 state returns
for the same reasons he has not filed his Federal tax returns for those years. (Answer at
1; Tr. at 42.)
