Applicant admitted the SOR allegation in ¶ 1.a. He denied the SOR allegations in
¶¶  1.b  through  1.d.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits
submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 29 years old. He married in November 2022 and has no children. He
graduated from high school in 2011. He attended college full time from 2011 to 2016. He
attended  college  part-time  from  January  2017  to  June  2017  and  from  August  2018  to
November 2019. He did not earned a degree. He intends to continue to pursue a degree.
He has worked for a federal contractor since October 2020. (Item 3)
After leaving  college  in 2016, Applicant had  a  series of jobs,  some  part-time  and
sometimes he  was self-employed  as a  rideshare driver. From  July 2017  to  June  2018, he
worked  full-time  as a  member of  AmeriCorps  and  moved  to  another state  (State  A). He
worked  with  inner city  and  at-risk youth.  He was not classified  as an  employee  under this
program  and  was paid a  stipend, which barely  covered  his expenses in a  high  cost-of-
living  state. He  did  not have  a  car, and  his commute  was  an hour to and from  the  school
by  bus. Although  he found  this experience  very rewarding, his days were often  13  hours
long  with  his commute. After he  completed  his obligation, he  returned  to  his home  state
(State  B) and worked as a  rideshare driver. (AE A)
In the past, Applicant’s father filed his federal and state income tax returns for him.
He was aware that because he lived in State A and State B for parts of 2017 and 2018,
he would have to file state income tax returns for both states. He believed his father had
filed his tax returns, but later learned that his father had only filed extensions. He resumed
college, continued working as a driver, and worked for a company that hosted afterschool
programs  for  elementary  school  children  that  centered  around  science,  technology,
engineering, and math. He was considered an independent contractor. In February 2019,
he started a new job with a restaurant and his father told him he would file an extension
for him for his 2018 tax returns. This is when he learned that his 2017 returns were not
yet filed, and he needed to complete them. Applicant admitted he was overwhelmed with
school and work. At the same time, his girlfriend, with whom he was living, was diagnosed
with Type 1 diabetes. He admitted he procrastinated in filing his tax returns. (AE A)
Applicant  admitted   he   was  intimidated   because   he   had   never  filed   them   on   his
own.  He  was  expecting   them   to   be   complex   because   of   his  multiple  moves   and   non-
traditional  income   from   AmeriCorps,  as  a   rideshare   driver,  and   as   an   independent
contractor. Because  of his limited  income,  he  did not  expect  to  owe  taxes. His parents
often filed  their  tax  returns late,  and he  believed  it  was permitted  to file  late  if  you  did  not
owe taxes. He now understands that is not correct. (AE  A)
Applicant suffers from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), which he is able to
control. It rarely affects his regular day-to-day activities, but he often feels compelled to
make  sure  everything  he  does  is  perfect.  It  sometimes  causes  him  to  delay  acting  on
certain things until he can ensure every detail is correct. He admits that he was reluctant
to immediately address his tax issues because once he started them they would consume
him. (AE A)
In 2020, Applicant and his girlfriend moved to State C. Because he had only lived
in one state the previous year, his tax returns were not complicated and he filed his 2019
federal and state tax returns. It was the first year he filed his tax returns by himself. He
admitted he did not budget enough time to complete them and his federal tax return was
filed on July 22, 2020. Due to the pandemic, the deadline for filing 2019 tax returns was
extended  to  July  15,  2020.  He  was  seven  days  late.  His  adjusted  gross  income  was
$24,475. He was entitled to a refund. (AE A, D).
In January 2021, Applicant’s apartment was burglarized. His backpack was stolen.
In it was his mileage log he kept when he was a rideshare driver in 2018. He was not sure
how  to  proceed  to  complete  his  delinquent  tax  returns  because  he  did  not  have  this
needed information.
In April 2021, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) and in it
disclosed his failure to timely file his federal and state tax returns for 2017 and 2018. He
explained  in the  SCA that he believed for 2017 that  he  would  not owe  taxes  and  they
would be complicated to complete. He filed his 2017 federal and state income tax returns
in April 2021. (AE B)
Applicant also disclosed in his SCA that he failed to file his 2018 federal and state
income tax returns. He explained that he did not think he owed taxes. During this tax year
he was a driver and when his mileage log was stolen, it complicated how to estimate his
expenses. He readily admitted that he should not have delayed filing his tax returns. His
2018 federal and state tax returns were filed in October 2021. His adjusted gross income
was $5,741. With penalties and interest, he owed $301, which he paid. (AE C)
SOR ¶ 1.a alleged Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for
tax years 2017, 2018, and 2019. Tax year 2017 was filed in April 2021, tax year 2018 was
filed in October 2021, and tax year 2019 was filed a week late in July 2020. (AE B, C, D)
SOR ¶ 1.b alleged Applicant failed to timely file State A income tax returns for tax
years 2017 and 2018. Applicant filed his 2017 State A tax return in April 2021. He owed
$10 with penalties and interest, which he has paid. He filed his 2018 State A tax return in
October 2021. He did not owe taxes. (AE A, H)
SOR  ¶  1.c  alleged  Applicant  failed  to  timely  file  State  B  income  tax  returns  for
2017, 2018, and 2019. He filed his 2017 State B income tax returns in May 2021 and his
2018 returns in October 2021. Applicant filed his 2019 State B returns on July 22, 2020.
He stated in his FORM response that State B allows for an automatic six-month extension
for  filing  if  no  taxes  are  owed.  State  B’s  filing  deadline  was  June  1,  2020.  Because
Applicant did not owe state taxes, he was within the six-month extension period. (AE A;
AE G page 1, 6, 9-11)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleged Applicant failed to timely file State C income tax return for tax
year 2018. Applicant erroneously disclosed on his SCA that he lived in State C in 2018.
He actually lived there in 2020, so he was not required to file in State C for 2018. Applicant
filed his 2020 State C income tax returns 14 days late. He owed $48 and paid the tax.
(AE I)
Applicant filed his federal income tax return for tax year 2020 in May 2021. He was
entitled to a refund. He filed his 2021 tax year federal income tax return on time in April
2022. His state tax returns for these years were filed timely.
Applicant takes responsibility for failing to timely file his federal and state income
tax returns. He primarily attributed his failures to being inexperienced; overwhelmed that
filing tax returns would be complicated because he lived in multiple states; believing for a
period that his father had filed for him; his belief that if you did not owe taxes you did not
have to file on time; and his procrastination. Applicant recognizes that he failed to make
filing his tax returns a priority, but that has changed. (AE A)
In Applicant’s response to the FORM, he said all of his delinquent tax returns are
filed and provided supporting documents. He paid whatever taxes were owed and any
penalties and interest imposed. He now uses a software program to help him prepare his
tax returns and plans to continue to use it in the future. He has created reminders on his
calendar to notify him when tax deadlines are approaching. He keeps a tax folder on his
computer with copies of his previous tax returns. He has opted to receive all of  his tax
documents electronically and stores them by year on his computer. If he receives a tax
document that is not delivered electronically, he scans it and saves it to the folder on his
computer. He no longer works as an independent contractor so his tax returns are simpler.
(AE A)
I have not considered any derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR
for  disqualifying  purposes.  I  may  consider  this  information  when  making  a  credibility
determination,  in  the  application  of  mitigating  conditions,  and  in  my  whole-person
analysis.
