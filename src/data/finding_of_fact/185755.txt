Applicant is a 36-year-old employee of a government contractor. He has worked
for his current employer since about December 2019. He earned a high school diploma
in  2006.  He  has  taken  some  college  courses  but  has  not  earned  an  undergraduate
degree.  He  has  been  married  since  2013.  He  has  four  children,  two  of  whom  are  his
stepchildren.  Their  ages  are  17,  13,  9,  and  5.  He  served  in  the  U.S.  Army  from  2007
until  2014  and  the  Army  Reserve  from  2014  until  2018.  He  earned  an  honorable
discharge  from  both.  He  has  held  a  security  clearance  since  2007.  He  has  never
received a warning for a security clearance violation. (Tr. 19, 21-22; GE 1, 2)
In  the  SOR,  the  Government  alleged  Applicant’s  six  delinquent  debts  totaling
approximately $47,000 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.f). The delinquency listed in SOR ¶ 1. a
was  an  automobile  loan.  The  remainder  of  the  delinquencies  were  credit  cards.
Applicant admitted the SOR allegations with additional comments. The delinquencies in
SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.c  are  with  the  same  creditor.  His  admissions  are  adopted  as
findings of fact. (SOR; Answer)
Applicant’s financial difficulties started in about December 2017 when he lost his
job because he would not agree to consecutive nine-month deployments away from his
family. He made this decision after deliberating with his family and deciding he wanted
to  be  with  them  more.  He  also  did  not  want  to  miss  the  birth  of  his  son.  He  and  his
family  then  moved  across  the  country  from  State  A  to  State  B,  where  his  extended
family lives. He was unemployed until about March 2018. (Tr. 26-28; Answer; GE 1, 2)
With   the   exception   of  the   auto   loan   in   SOR  ¶   1.a,   Applicant   incurred   the
delinquent   debt  listed   in  the   SOR   through   moving   and   living   expenses.  He   could  not
afford  to   pay  the   SOR   debts  because   he   was  unemployed.   He  claimed   that  he
contacted   the   SOR  creditors  in   2017   or  2018,  to   make   payment   arrangements  with
them  when  he  lost  his  job, but they wanted  more money than  he  could afford while he
was unemployed.  He  contacted  the  creditors in  SOR ¶¶  1.a  through  1.e  in August 2022
and  made  payment arrangements with  them.  He provided  documents  corroborating  his
$400  monthly payment  to  the  creditor  of the  debts  alleged  in  SOR ¶¶  1.a  through  1.c  in
November  and   December  2022,   and   January  2023.   He   provided   documents
corroborating  his  monthly payments  of  $135  to  the  creditor  in  SOR ¶  1.d  in November
and  December 2022,  and  January 2023.  He provided  a  document corroborating  that he
has  a   zero  balance   on   the   debt  listed   in  SOR  ¶   1.e.   He  paid  this  debt  off   in  August
2022.   He   contacted   the   creditor   in   SOR  ¶   1.f   in  April  2022   and   arranged   for  a   $50
automatic  debit  from   his  bank  account  in   December  2022.   He  has  a   payment
arrangement with  this creditor, as well. All  of  the  SOR debts  have  been  resolved  or  are
in the  process  of  being  resolved. He  acknowledged  that the  possible  loss  of  his  security
clearance  motivated  him  to  resolve the  SOR debts.  (Tr.  19, 25-33; Answer;  GE  1, 2,  5-
8; AE A-E)
Applicant claimed that in March 2021, he sold a home and paid off all of his credit
cards  with  the  exception  of  the  debts  listed  in  the  SOR.  Since  then,  he  has  opened
several credit cards, lines of credit, and retail installment contracts despite claiming that
he has sufficient income to pay his expenses without borrowing. In September 2022, he
financed  the  purchase  of  a  truck  for  $86,000,  on  which  he  pays  about  $1,550  per
month.  In  March  2022,  he  financed  the  purchase  of  a  recreational  vehicle  (RV)  for
$58,000  on  which  he  pays  about  $918  per month.  He  purchased  this  RV  because  he
was living in a smaller one and wanted more room for his family. He and his family have
since  moved  out  of  the  RV  into  a  home  for  which  he  pays  rent  of  about  $1,500  per
month. In January 2023, his father and cousin passed away, and he used credit to pay
some of the related expenses, including helping his mother financially. While they carry
a  balance,  none  of  these  non-SOR  credit  cards,  lines  of  credit,  or  retail  installment
contracts are delinquent. (Tr. 34-40; GE 2, 8)
When  Applicant  left  the  military  in  2018,  he  was  classified  as  40  percent
disabled.  After making additional claims  with the  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  (VA),
his  disability  increased  to  60  percent  and  then  to  100  percent  in  March  2022.  In  April
2022,  he  received  a  lump-sum  payment  from  the  VA  for  about  $5,000  for  retroactive
disability  benefits.  That  same  month,  he  began  receiving  about  $4,280  in  tax-free
disability  payments.  At  this  time,  his  wife  also  began  receiving  about  $1,100  for  an
educational  stipend.  Applicant  claimed  that  this  influx  of  about  $5,000  in  additional
monthly  income  helped  him  pay  his  bills  and  allowed  him  to  make  payment
arrangement on the SOR debts. Applicant earns $5,900 per month in take-home salary
and  his  wife  receives  $1,000  per  month  for  child  support  for  his  two  stepchildren.  He
provided  a  copy  of  his  working  budget  that  shows  a  monthly surplus  of  about  $2,000.
He has about $100 in a savings account and $2,000 in cash, so his actual savings do
not match his written budget. (Tr. 31-34, 41-45; AE D)
