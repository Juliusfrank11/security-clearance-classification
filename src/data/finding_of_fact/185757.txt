Applicant is 52 years old. He earned an associate’s degree in 2007. He has been
married since 1996. He has two children with his current wife, and they also adopted his
niece and nephew. He has four children before he became married in 1996. His youngest
daughter and nephew still reside in the home. Since 2007, he has been employed as an
electronic mechanic with a DOD contractor. This is his first application for a DOD security
clearance. (Tr. 17-21; GE 1)
The SOR alleges financial considerations security concerns in that Applicant did
not timely file Federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2017, 2018, 2019, and
2020, and he owes delinquent Federal and state taxes. Since his Answer was unclear,
Applicant clarified at the hearing that he had admitted all of the SOR allegations under
Guideline F. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d.) (Tr. 9-10)
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.c.) Applicant failed to timely file, as required, his Federal and
state income tax returns for 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020. Applicant and his wife used a
certified public accountant (CPA), a friend of his wife’s, to prepare and file their income
tax  returns.  In  2018,  Applicant  discovered  that  the  CPA  had  not  filed  their  2017  tax
returns. He spoke with his wife about the problem, and thought it was being handled. He
then later found out that the CPA had not filed their 2018 tax returns either. The CPA had
been diagnosed with cancer. They requested that the CPA return their tax paperwork, so
they  could  have  these  tax  returns  filed  by  another  tax  preparer.  By  the  time  Applicant
submitted his security clearance application (SCA) in March 2021, he admitted that he
was aware they were seriously behind on filing their Federal and state income tax returns
for  tax  years  2017-2019,  and  that  they  had  also  accumulated  delinquent  Federal  and
state tax debt. (Tr. 22-24)
After the submission of his March 2021 SCA, Applicant and his wife came up with
a plan to resolve their tax issues. His spouse tried two different tax companies, but the
companies  were  unable  to  provide  assistance.  When  Applicant  responded  to  the
Government interrogatories in November 2021, his IRS tax transcripts dated September
2021 showed that they had not filed a  Federal tax return for tax years 2017, 2019 and
2020. His Federal tax transcript showed that their 2018 tax return was filed in May 2021.
(Tr. 25-32; GE 2)
Applicant  provided  Federal  tax  transcripts  dated  December  19,  2022,  post-
hearing.  These  documents  showed  that  his  2017  Federal  tax  return  was  filed  on
September 26, 2022, and his 2019 Federal tax return was filed on March 7, 2022.  His
2020 Federal and state  tax returns were submitted  (Federal tax transcript unavailable)
which reflected they were “signed by Applicant and his wife” on December 12, 2021. His
2021  Federal  and  state  tax  returns  were  “signed  on  October 10, 2022.”  He  stated  the
2021 tax returns were timely filed, which would be correct assuming his tax preparer filed
for  an  extension.  The  2017,  2018,  and  2019  state  tax  returns  submitted  with  his
interrogatory were all undated. (AE B, AE C, AE G, AE H, AE I, AE J; Tr. 32-33)
Applicant stated the problems associated with the untimely filing of their state and
Federal tax returns were due to circumstances outside of their control. Their CPA was
diagnosed with cancer and they had difficulty trying to retrieve their tax papers from her.
At his hearing, he repeated his statement made in response to DOHA interrogatories that
his wife also attempted to hire two tax service companies to correct their tax issues, but
they were unable to provide assistance. In 2020, his wife’s identity was stolen, and  the
filing  of  her  2020  tax  return  involved  a  complicated  process.  Applicant  provided  email
communication from their hired tax preparer, who notified his spouse in February 2022,
that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) had rejected the electronic filing of her 2020 tax
return since it had been previously filed (due to identity theft.) The tax preparer informed
her that he would have to file a paper tax return for 2020, and that it could cause some
delays. (AE A, AE E; Tr. 31-33)
(SOR ¶1.b) Applicant is indebted to the Federal Government in the approximate
amount of $15,406, for tax years 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020. Applicant did not provide
any documentation about the current balance of his delinquent Federal tax debt, whether
he had arranged a payment plan, or made any tax payments to the IRS. A review of his
Federal  tax  transcripts,  and  his  signed  tax  return  for  tax  year  2020,  showed  the
outstanding delinquent taxes, as follows:
Tax Year 2017 - Transcript  Owes  - $27,296
Tax Year 2018 - Transcript  Owes  -  $15,406
Tax Year 2019 - Transcript  Owes  -    $5,378
Tax Year 2020 – sign retrn  Owes -    $1,815
The total amount Applicant owes the Federal Government for delinquent taxes for
tax years 2017-2020 is approximately $49,896. (GE 2; AE B, AE C, AE G)
(SOR  ¶1.d)  Applicant  is  indebted  to  his  state  of  residence  in  the  approximate
amount  of  $8,965  for  tax  years  2017,  2018,  2019,  and  2020.  He  disclosed  in  his
November  2021  interrogatory  that  he  had  arranged  a  payment  plan  with  the  state  tax
department, and he was making monthly payments of $240. He submitted documentation
dated December 2022 from the state department of revenue that showed he had made
12 payments of $240 and the current balance of his outstanding state tax was $12,530.
It is unclear if this amount was for a specific tax year, or whether it was a combined total
of all of his delinquent state taxes. His signed 2020 state tax return showed $2,586 was
owed to the state, and the 2021 state tax return showed $1,842 was owed to the state.
