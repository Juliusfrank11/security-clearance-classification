After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make
the following findings of fact:
Applicant is 41 years old, has never married, and has one child, seven years old.
She is a high school graduate, with some college credits but no degree. She and her child
live  with  her  parents.  Since  February  2010,  she  has  been  employed  by  a  defense
contractor. (Item 3.)
According  to  Applicant’s  April  28,  2021  Personal  Subject  Interview  (PSI),  her
financial  difficulties  began  in  2012  or  2013.  In  that  time  frame,  she  was  making  about
$65,000 gross per year. She then was moved, however, to work on a different contract
for the same employer; that reduced her pay to about $45,000 gross per year. Then in
2014, she had surgery and related uncovered medical expenses. In 2015, she gave birth
to her child. (Item 4.)
In  2021,  the  father  of  Applicant’s  child  was  also  having  financial  problems  and
stopped paying child support. She considered filing for bankruptcy but could not afford
the  filing  fee.  With  the  decreased  salary  and  loss  of  child  support,  she  was  unable  to
make minimum monthly payments on many of her accounts. She used her tax refunds to
repay loans from her parents. She managed to pay her auto payments and  insurance,
because she needed her car for transportation to and from work. At that time, her gross
monthly  income  was  $5,083  and  a  net  after  deductions  of  $3,032.  After  her  routine
household expenses, that left her with a monthly net remainder of negative $121. (Items
4 and 5.)  The majority of her accounts became delinquent between 2016 and 2017, or
later.  (Items 11 and 12.)
Applicant’s August 16, 2022 Response to the FORM stated that she is in a much
better position financially than at the time of her PSI. Since her PSI, she received a raise
that made her annual salary $57,833, up from $45,000. She also obtained a court order
directing her child’s father to pay $1,000 per month in child support, which he has been
consistently  paying.  Included  in  her  monthly  budget  is  $729  she  pays  to  a  debt  relief
agency to settle or resolve ten of her SOR debts. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.i & 1k.) Another monthly
budget item is a $150 payment to a collection attorney to resolve SOR ¶ 1.j. She now has
a monthly net remainder of $873, up from a negative $121 monthly net remainder at the
time of her PSI. She also attached documents showing that she is current on her utilities,
phone, and Internet bills (not alleged in the SOR).  Documents attached to her Response
support her assertions. (Response at 1-5, 9-12, 14-18, 22, 24-27.)
The   SOR alleged   20  delinquent   accounts   that  are   judgments,   charge   offs,  or in
collection  totaling  $65,078.  (Item  1.)  The  first  nine  accounts  and  the  eleventh  (SOR ¶¶
1.a  –  1.i  &  1.k) totaling  $53,789  have  been  enrolled  with  Applicant’s debt relief agency
and  are  being  resolved  by  Applicant’s monthly payment of  $729  to  that  agency, (Item  2
at 18-22; Response  at  4.) The  status of the  remaining  ten  SOR accounts  is  described
below.
SOR ¶  1.j is an  account in  collection  for $1,629. This account is being  resolved  by
Applicant’s monthly payment of $150  to  a  collection  attorney.  (Item  2; Response  at  4, 17-
18.
SOR  ¶  1.l  is  an  account  in  collection  for  $581.  Applicant  denied  this  debt,

did not produce any documents supporting that assertion. This debt is not resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.m  is  an  account  in  collection  for  $280.  Applicant  denied  this  debt,

that the charge was valid. (Response at 28.) This debt is not resolved.

plus interest and fees totaling $1,703. This debt was not resolved by Applicant.

SOR ¶ 1.s is a judgment for $1,009. Applicant admitted this debt, answering that
it has been paid in full. (Item 2.) This judgment was satisfied on July 19, 2021. (Item 8.)
This debt has been resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.t is a judgment for $1,251. Applicant denied this debt, answering that it
has been paid in full. (Item 2.)  A judgment in this amount was entered and a lien recorded
on March 4,2020, plus fees totaling $1,285. This debt has not been resolved.
The  FORM  included  Court  Case  Summaries  documenting  judgments  entered
against Applicant. (Items 6-10.)
In sum, Applicant resolved 13 SOR debts totaling $56,650, leaving 7 unresolved
debts totaling $8,428.
Law and Policies
It  is  well  established  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.  As  the
Supreme  Court  held,  “the  clearly  consistent  standard
that  security
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.” Department of the Navy
v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).
indicates
When  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability
for  a  security  clearance,  an
administrative  judge  must  consider  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  These  guidelines  are
flexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the
whole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a
decision.  The  protection  of  the  national  security  is  the  paramount  consideration.  AG  ¶
¶2(b)  requires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  national
security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.”
Under  Directive  ¶   E3.1.14,   the   Government   must  present  evidence   to   establish
controverted  facts alleged  in  the  SOR. Under Directive ¶  E3.1.15,  then  the  applicant  is
responsible  for presenting  “witnesses and  other evidence  to  rebut,  explain, extenuate, or
mitigate  facts admitted  by applicant or proven  by Department Counsel. . . .” The  applicant
has the  ultimate  burden of persuasion in seeking a  favorable security decision.
