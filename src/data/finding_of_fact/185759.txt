Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  allegations  in  his  Answer  to  the  SOR.  (¶¶1.a  and
1.b,  and  2.a.)  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits
submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  57  years old.  He  was  previously married  from  about  1984  to  2014,
and he married his current spouse in 2020. He has three adult children. He graduated
from  high  school  in  1983,  and  attended  college  for  one  semester.  He  has  been
employed by his present employer, a federal contractor, since November 2018. His job
title is director of information technology. Applicant was granted an interim DOD security
clearance in August 2019, and he has never been notified that his interim DOD security
was revoked. (Tr. 13-15; GE 1)
Drug Involvement and Falsification
In his February 2019 SCA, Applicant intentionally failed to disclose, as required,
that  he  had  used  and  purchased  marijuana  from  2012  to  present.  He  testified  at  the
hearing that he did not disclose this information because he was worried that he would
not  get  a  DOD  security  clearance,  and  he  would  be  fired  by  his  employer.  He  also
admitted  that  during  his  first  background  interview  conducted  in  June  2019,  he
deliberately failed to disclose his use and purchase of marijuana to an authorized DOD
investigator. A second interview was conducted in March 2020 to confront him about his
failure  to  report  illegal  drug  use.  He  then  admitted  that  he  had  used  marijuana  from
approximately  “2014”  to  the  present  time.  He  reported  that  he  smokes  marijuana  at
least  one  time  per  week,  and  if  he  is  on  vacation,  he  will  smoke  it  daily.  He  also
estimated  that  he  spends  about  $400  to  $500  on  a  monthly  basis  to  purchase
marijuana. (GE 1, GE 2; Tr. 15-18, 23)
Applicant stated that even though he applied for a DOD security clearance with
the  submission  of  the February 2019 SCA, he  never had  the  intention  to  abstain from
smoking  marijuana.  Both  he  and  his  wife  use  marijuana  in  the  home.  He  testified,
however,  that  he  recently  made  a  decision  to  stop  smoking marijuana.  His  last  use  of
marijuana  occurred  on  October  2,  2022.  He  decided  that  he  would  no  longer  smoke
marijuana because he would like to keep his current employment. His wife continues to
smoke marijuana in the home. He also acknowledged that using marijuana is illegal in
his state of residence and in violation of federal law. He has not reported his illegal drug
use to his facility security officer. (Tr. 18-22; GE 2
