Applicant is a 45-year-old employee of a government contractor. He has worked
for  his  current  employer  since  about  February  2018.  He  has  been  employed  full  time
since  about  2013.  He  was  awarded  a  high  school  diploma  in  1995.  He  took  some
community  college  courses  but  did  not  earn  an  associate’s  degree.  He  has  been
married and divorced twice. His first marriage was from 2002 until 2005 and his second
marriage was from 2009 until 2014. He has resided with a cohabitant since March 2020.
He has two children, ages 18 and 12. He served on active duty with the U.S Air Force
from 2001 until 2007 and with the Air Force Reserve from 2007 until 2010. He received
honorable discharges from both. (Tr. 33-34; GE 1, 2, 6, 7)
In  the  SOR,  the  Government  alleged  that  Applicant  had  not  timely  filed  his
federal income tax returns for the 2012 through 2017 and 2019 tax years (SOR ¶ 1.a). It
also alleged that he owed delinquent federal taxes in the following amounts: $8,000 for
the  2012,  2014,  2015,  and  2016  tax  years  (SOR  ¶  1.b);  $2,758  for  the  2013  tax  year
(SOR  ¶  1.c);  $7,062 for the  2017  tax year (SOR  ¶  1.d); and  $4,6667 for the 2019  tax
year (SOR ¶ 1.e). Finally, it alleged that Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2016
that  was  discharged  in  2018  (SOR  ¶  1.f).  In  his  Answer,  Applicant  denied  the  SOR
allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b  with  additional  comment.  He  admitted  the  SOR
allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.c through 1.f with additional comment. I have incorporated his
admissions as findings of fact. Despite his denial of the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and
1.b,  those  allegations  are  established  by  Applicant’s  Questionnaires  for  National
Security  Positions  he  submitted  in  April  2018  and  August  2020,  the  IRS  Account
Transcripts, and the 2019 and 2020 security interviews. (SOR; Answer; GE 1-3, 6, 7)
Applicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for the 2012 through
2017 and 2019 tax years despite being required to do so. He also failed to timely file his
2018 federal income tax return.  Any adverse information not alleged in the SOR, such
as  Applicant’s  late  filing  of  income  tax  returns  for  other  tax  years  cannot  be  used  for
disqualification  purposes,  however  it  may  be  considered  in  assessing  an  applicant’s
credibility;  in  evaluating an  applicant’s  evidence  of  extenuation, mitigation,  or changed
circumstances;  in  considering  whether  the  applicant  has  demonstrated  successful
rehabilitation; and in applying the whole-person concept. (ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3
(App.  Bd.  Aug.  16,  2017))  In  2017,  he  asked  his  sister,  who  is  an  income  tax  filing
professional,  to  file  his  income  tax  returns  for  the  2012  through  2016  tax  years.  He
acknowledged  that  he  had  not  timely  filed  his  2012  through  2017  federal  income  tax
returns because  he  was “lazy.”  She agreed to file these federal income tax returns for
him.  However,  she  never  filed  Applicant’s  2012  through  2016  income  tax  returns  with
the  IRS  and  forgot  to  tell  Applicant  about  this  failure.  He  was  aware  that  his  2012
through  2016  federal  income  tax  returns  had  not  been  filed  by  March  2018.  He  then
contacted  an  acquaintance  who  helped  others  file  their  income  tax  returns.  He  asked
this acquaintance to help him file his 2013 through 2017 federal income tax returns. (Tr.
23-27, 37-44, 47-51; Answer; GE 1-3, 6, 7; AE A-E)
Applicant believed that the aforementioned acquaintance filed his federal income
tax returns for  tax years  2013  through 2017, sometime  in  2018.  However, in  2020,  he
received  a  notice  from  the  IRS  stating  that  he  had  not  appropriately  filed  his  federal
income tax returns for at least some of these tax years. Applicant believed that the IRS
did  not  process  the  income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2013  through  2017  that  his
acquaintance submitted in 2018, because he did not sign them. Applicant claimed that
in  2020,  he  contacted the  IRS  in  response  to  this notice.  He  claimed  that, because  of
this contact with the IRS, he refiled his 2013 through 2017 federal income tax returns in
2020.  He  later  realized  that  he  had  refiled  unsigned  versions  of  these  returns,  and  he
believes that the IRS did not process them in 2020 for this reason. (Tr. 23-27, 41, 42-43,
45-52; Answer; GE 1-3, 6, 7; AE A-J)
Applicant  eventually  successfully  filed  his  2013  through  2017  and  2019  federal
income  tax  returns  between  August  2020  and  November  2021.  He  has  yet  to  file  his
2012 federal income tax return. He claimed that the IRS indicated that he is not required
to file this income tax return for an unspecified reason. He filed his 2018 federal income
tax return in March 2022, after it was due. He filed his 2020 federal income tax return in
September 2021, after it was due. He timely filed his 2021 federal income tax return in
March 2022. He claimed that he was in regular contact with the IRS about his tax filings
in 2018 and 2021. (Tr. 23-27, 41, 42-43, 45-52; Answer; GE 1-3, 6, 7; AE A-J)
Applicant  owed  approximately  $8,000  in  delinquent  federal  taxes  for  tax  years
2012, 2014, 2015, and 2016. He owed approximately $2,758 in delinquent taxes for the
2013 tax year. He owed approximately $7,062 in delinquent taxes for the 2017 tax year.
He owed approximately $4,667 in delinquent taxes for the 2019 tax year. He also owed
unspecified delinquent federal taxes for the 2018 and 2020 tax years. In October 2021,
he made a written offer to the IRS for a payment arrangement of $300 per month for his
delinquent federal taxes for the  2013 through  2019  tax years. In  March  2022,  the  IRS
acknowledged in writing that he had made a payment arrangement of $450 per month
for  tax  years  2013  through  2019.  Applicant  paid  the  delinquent  federal  taxes  for  tax
years  2013  through  2017  and  2019 from  March  2022  through  September 2022.  As  of
September 2022, these delinquent taxes are paid. He paid his delinquent federal taxes
for the  2018  tax year between  March and  November 2022,  when he paid them  in full.
He paid his delinquent federal taxes for the 2020 tax year between June and September
2022, when he paid them in full. He paid approximately $30,000 in delinquent taxes. He
was  able  to  pay  these  delinquent  taxes  with  his  income.  He  received  a  refund  for  the
2021 tax year. (Tr. 23-27, 45-48; 53; Answer; GE 1-3, 6, 7; AE A-J)
By 2018, at the latest, Applicant knew that he owed delinquent taxes. He claimed
that he waited until October 2021 to offer to make payment arrangements with the IRS
because  he  was  waiting  to  receive  a  bill.  He  claimed  he  did  not  make  any  payments
until March 2022 because he waited until he had a payment arrangement in place with
the IRS. He also stated that part of the reason for his delay in resolving his tax filing and
payment  issues  was  an  IRS  backlog  and  his  multiple  changes  of  residences  and
changes in employment. (Tr. 31-32, 45-50, 53; Answer; GE 1, 2, 6, 7; AE B-J)
Applicant  filed  a  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  petition  in  September  2016.  He  needed
financial  assistance  because  he  was  underemployed  and  could  not  pay  his  financial
obligations, which included child support.  He listed about $24,600 in unsecured claims
in his bankruptcy petition. In March 2017, the bankruptcy judge closed the case without
granting  a  discharge  because  Applicant  had  not  filed  his  proof  of  financial  education.
Applicant completed his required financial management class in April 2018. The judge
reopened  the  bankruptcy  case  in  April  2018  and  granted  Applicant  a  Chapter  7
discharge that same month. (Tr. 28, 30; Answer; GE 1, 2, 4-7)
After he filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy, notwithstanding his delinquent federal taxes,
he  has  been  mostly  current  on  his  other  financial  responsibilities  with  several
exceptions.  He  was  ninety-days  delinquent  on  two  student  loans  in  September  2016
and  July  2017,  when  he  allowed  these  loans  to  fall  out  of  a  forbearance  status.  He
resolved these student loan delinquencies in September 2017, by having them replaced
in forbearance. He was 30 days late on a small credit-card balance in June 2020, which
he paid in full in July 2020. He had two delinquent consumer debts of about $350 each
that he resolved in March 2021. (Tr. 28-30, 55; Answer; GE 3-7; AE T)
Applicant  has   been   working   and   residing   in   Country   A   since   May   2022.   He   is
currently  scheduled  to  work and  live  there  until May  2023,  but may  continue  there  until
May   2024.  He  provided   pay   stubs  showing   that  he  has  earned   between   about  $3,500
and   $6,000   in   take   home   pay   every   two   weeks  while  he   works  in  Country   A.  He   also
earns additional  income  of about $11,000 monthly  while  working  in Country A
.  Given  his
ability   to   pay   his  significant  federal   tax   indebtedness,   the   lack  of  delinquencies  on   the
credit reports in the  record, his bank  account  balances, and  his testimony  to  this effect
at the time of  the  hearing, he  has  enough income  while working in  Country A  to meet his
financial obligations and  to  save  money. His  parents have  indicated  their  willingness to
guarantee  any  of  his income  tax  delinquencies. (Tr. 33-37, 53-54; Answer; GE  5; AE  B-
T)
Applicant  provided  character  reference  letters  from  individuals  who  know  him
both socially and through work. Some of these individuals hold security clearances. All
attest  to  his  trustworthiness,  reliability,  professionalism,  and  discretion  involving
sensitive information. They believe that he should be granted a security clearance. He
has  completed  several  training  courses  relevant  to  the  protection  of  sensitive
information. (Tr. 31; Answer)
