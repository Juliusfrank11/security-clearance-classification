Applicant is a 33-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since June 2021. He served on active duty in the U.S. military from
2010  until  he  was  honorably  discharged  in  2016.  He  has  college  credits  and  training
certificates, but he has not earned a degree. He married in 2009 and divorced in 2014.
He has a ten-year-old child from the marriage. He lives with his fiancée, and they have
a  child  together.  She  also  has  another  child  that  lives  with  them.  (Tr.  at  15,  17-22;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2)
Applicant left the military after his father promised him a job, but that offer never
came  to  fruition.  He  had  periods  of  unemployment  and  underemployment.  He  also
admitted  that  he  lived  beyond  his  means.  He  was  unable  to  pay  all  of  his  bills  and  a
number of debts became delinquent. (Tr. at 15-16, 20, 23; Applicant’s response to SOR;
GE 1, 2; AE A)
The  SOR  alleges  four  delinquent  debts  totaling  about  $35,640.  Applicant
admitted that he owed all of  the debts, but he stated that he was  paying one of  them,
and the creditors for the remaining three debts charged off the debts as bad debts and
“released  [him]  from  any  obligation  to  pay  the  debt[s].”  The  debts  include  two  credit
cards, an account that he used to buy a motorcycle, and the deficiency owed on an auto
loan after the vehicle was repossessed.
Applicant paid a $1,607 debt that was not alleged in the SOR  in April 2020. He
paid a $570 debt that was not alleged in the SOR in 2020 or early 2021. (Tr. at 34-35;
GE 2-6; AE H)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  on
July 7, 2021. He reported the SOR debts. He stated that with his new job, he would be
able  to  satisfy  all  of  his  debts  within  a  few  months.  He  stated  that  he  contacted  the
creditor for one debt and he had “begun making minimum monthly payments of $50 [per
month] until the debt is resolved.” He stated that he also contacted the three remaining
creditors,  and  he  was  “making  minimum  $50  monthly  payments” on  one  debt;  and  he
would start making $50 and $100 monthly payments on the last two debts. (GE 1)
Applicant was interviewed for his background investigation on July 30, 2021. He
discussed his finances and delinquent debts. He  indicated that  he made  payments on
the  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b  in  2020  while  he  was  working  overseas.  He
admitted  that  he  had  not  made  any  of  the  payments  reported  in  the  SF  86.  Credit
reports show that as of the date of the SOR, no payments on any of the SOR debts had
been received since 2018. (Tr. at 24, 27-28; GE 2-6)
Applicant entered into an agreement with the collection company for the $9,667
debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b on April 6, 2022, the same date he responded to the SOR.
He agreed to pay $62 every week for 156 weeks, through March 2025. He documented
that he made all of the weekly payments through October 2022, except one payment in
August 2022 was returned for nonsufficient funds (NSF). He paid a total of $1,735, and
the balance was reduced to $7,994. (Tr. at 25, 36; Applicant’s response to SOR; AE A,
B, E, I)
Applicant  contracted  with  a  debt-settlement  company  in  October  2022  to  assist
him  in  resolving  his  debts.  He  enrolled  six  debts,  totaling  $43,359,  in  the  company’s
debt-resolution program (DRP). The four debts alleged in the SOR, including the debt in
SOR  ¶  1.b  that  he  was  paying,  were  included  in  the  DRP.  He  agreed  to  make  $320
payments twice a month to an escrow account. The debt-settlement company agreed to
negotiate  settlements  with  his  creditors  and  use  the  accumulated  funds  in  the  escrow
account,  minus  their  fees,  to  pay  the  settlements.  The  company  estimated  a  payoff
amount of $31,368, with an estimated debt-free date of November 30, 2026.  Applicant
documented that he made the first two $320 payments. (Tr. at 24-32, 37; AE F, G)
Applicant’s  finances  have  stabilized.  His  fiancée  is  self-employed,  and  they  are
staying  with  his fiancée’s  parents. He  has done a  lot  of  studying,  and he has  adopted
the sound advice of experts on managing his finances.  He stated that he is committed
to maintaining the DRP through its resolution and paying his debts. He has a job offer
from the parent company of his current employer for a cleared position, contingent upon
him  receiving  a  security  clearance.  If  he  is granted  a  security  clearance  and  gets  that
job, his finances will improve. He will lose his current job if he does not obtain a security
clearance. (Tr. at 30-34, 40-43; AE A, D, J, K)
