Applicant  admitted  all of  the  SOR  allegations  (¶¶  1.a-1.n),  except for  ¶  1.o.  His
admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a careful review of the pleadings and
evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  56  years  old.  He  has  worked  for  his  current  employer,  a  defense
contractor, since August 2020, as a subject matter expert. Since 2008, he has worked
for  various  defense  contractors.  He  had  short  periods  of  unemployment  (March-April
2020;  July-September  2018)  in  the  past.  He  is  a  high  school  graduate  and  has  taken
some college courses. He is married for the second time and has two adult children. He
has held a security clearance in the past. (Item 4).
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant  failed  to  timely  file  his  2015  through  2021  federal
income tax returns, as required, and that he failed to timely file his 2015  through 2021
state income tax returns (¶¶ 1.a, 1.o). Applicant admitted in his August 2022 answers to
interrogatories that he failed to file his 2015-2021 federal and state income tax returns.
He also admitted in his SOR answer that he failed to file his federal tax returns for the
same time period. (Items 3, 5)
Applicant  provided  documentation  showing  that  he  hired  a  tax  resolution
company (Tax Firm) in July 2022 to file his delinquent federal tax returns for tax years
2015-2021.  While  he  or  the  Tax  Firm  requested  and  received  “W-2  Wage  and  Tax
Statements”  for  years  2015-2021  from  the  IRS,  there  is  no  documentary  evidence
showing that Applicant’s delinquent returns were filed. Applicant indicated that his plan
was to file his federal tax returns first then start working on his state tax returns. There is
no  documentary  evidence  showing  that  he  filed  his  state  returns.  His  tax  filing  issues
are unresolved. (Item 5; SOR answer)
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant  owed  nine  delinquent  medical  accounts  totaling
approximately $2,600. (¶¶ 1.e-1.k, 1.m-1.n) Applicant admitted owing these debts in his
SOR  answer.  The  debts  are  also  supported  by  listings  as  delinquent  debts  in  credit
reports from February 2021, September 2021,  and November 2022. Applicant claimed
he was unaware of these medical debts when he was interviewed in March 2021. These
debts remain unresolved. (Items 5-8, SOR answer)
The  SOR  also  alleged  Applicant  owed  four  delinquent  consumer  accounts
totaling  approximately  $9,200.  (¶¶  1.b-1.d  and  1.l)  He  admitted  these  debts  in  his
background interview and in his SOR answer. The debts are also supported by listings
as  delinquent  debts  in  credit  reports  from  February  2021,  September  2021,  and
November  2022.  The  November  2022  credit  report  reflects  that  Applicant  made
payments toward SOR debts ¶¶ 1.b and 1c., reducing the balance owed for both debts.
An earlier credit report reflects that ¶ 1.l was paid. Of these consumer debts, only SOR
¶ 1.d is unresolved. (Items 3, 5-8)
Applicant  cited  a  number  of  reasons  leading  to  his  financial  difficulties.  These
reasons  include  having  to  rely  on  short-term  disability  pay  in  2017  or  2018,  where  he
received 60% of his normal pay; unemployment from July 2018 to September 2018, due
to a layoff; and unemployment from March to April 2020, due to a job termination. (Items
4, 5)
Applicant’s  financial  worksheet  that  he  completed  in  August  2021  reflects  a  net
monthly  income  of  $4,587  and  total  monthly  expenses  of  $4,121,  leaving  a  monthly
remainder of $466. Other than his hiring of the Tax Firm to file his tax returns, there is
no evidence of financial counseling. (Items 3, 5)
