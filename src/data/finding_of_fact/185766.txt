In her Answer to the SOR Applicant admitted the factual allegations in Paragraph
1  of  the  SOR,  and  denied  the  factual  allegations  in  Paragraph  2  of  the  SOR,  with
explanations.  She  also  provided  additional  information  to  support  her  request  for
eligibility for a security clearance.
Applicant  is  30  years  old,  unmarried,  and  has  no  children.  She  works  for  a
defense  contractor.  (TR  at  page  12  line  1  to  page  13  line  6,  and  GX  1  at  page  5.)
Applicant was born and raised in State A until about May of 2016, when she moved to
State B, where she presently resides. (GX 1 at pages 5, and 8~13.)
Guideline H –  Drug Involvement
1.a. and 1.b.  Applicant admits she used marijuana, with varying frequency from
about 2008 until her last usage in March of 2021, more than a year prior to the issuance
of the SOR. Applicant used it recreationally, but also to treat menstrual pains. Applicant
admits  that  she  used  marijuana  after  being  granted  a  security  clearance  in  August  of
2018. (TR at page 13 line 7 to page 16 line 14, and at page 21 line 22 to page 22 line
2.) She has submitted a Statement of Intent against future illegal drug usage, and has
submitted three negative drug tests: June 2022, and two in September 2022. (AppXs A,
B, J and P.)
Guideline E  - Personal Conduct
2.a. Applicant answered,  “No,”  to  “Section 23  –  Illegal Use of Drugs  . . . in the last
(7) seven  years”  on  her March 2021  e-QIP. (GX 2  at page  57.) Applicant  avers, in part,
that she  did not know the  use  of marijuana  was illegal. (TR at page  17 line  7  to  page  18
line   21.)    I   find   this  to   be   a   willful   falsification   as   the   use   of  marijuana   is  illegal  under
Federal law. Applicant  argues  that she  thought  that its use  is legal in State  B;  but this
argument   holds  little  weight,   as  it  was   not   legal  in  State   A   where   she   resided   prior  to
May 2016.
2.b.  Applicant  answered,   “No,”   to   “Section   23   –   Illegal  Use  of  Drugs   .  .  .   While
Possessing   a   Security  Clearance”  on   her  March  2021   e-QIP.  (GX   2   at  page   57.)
Applicant  avers, in part,  that she  did not  know the  use  of  marijuana  was illegal. (TR at
page   18   line  22   to   page  19   line  2.)   I   find   this  to   be  a   willful   falsification  as the   use  of
marijuana is illegal under Federal law.
2.c.   Applicant  also   previously  answered,   “No,”   to   “Section   23   –   Illegal  Use   of
Drugs  . . . in the  last  (7) seven  years”  on  her  February 2017  e-QIP.  (GX 1  at page  45.)
Applicant  avers, in part,  that she  did not  know the  use  of  marijuana  was illegal. (TR at
page   19   lines   3~25.)    I  find   this  to   be   a   willful   falsification   as  the   use   of  marijuana   is
illegal under Federal   law.  Applicant’s   use   of   marijuana   was  not   legal  in   State   A   where
she resided  prior to May 2016.
