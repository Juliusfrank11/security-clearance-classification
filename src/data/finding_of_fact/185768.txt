Applicant, age 47, has been married since 2014. He has two sons, ages 15 and
17, and two adult stepsons. He graduated from high school in 1993. He has worked for
his  current  employer,  a  defense  contractor,  since  June  2013,  and  listed  no  periods  of
unemployment  in  his  June  2021  SCA.  He  has  held  a  DOD  security  clearance  since
approximately 2019. (Items 3, 4)
The   SOR  alleged   that   Applicant   has  three   delinquent   consumer   debts   totaling
approximately $21,910   and  one   delinquent   $1,495  medical debt.  He   admitted   SOR   ¶¶
1.a  through  1.c; however, I construed  his  explanations  for SOR ¶¶ 1.a  and  1.b  as de  facto
denials,  because  he  indicated  these  debts no  longer appear on  his  “credit history.”    He
denied  SOR ¶ 1.d. (Items 1-2)
Applicant attributed his financial problems largely to purchasing his home in June
2011.
“I  bought [a] house  [and]  couldn’t afford anything   else so  I  started  to  charge
things and  before I  knew it I  was to  (sic) far behind  to  catch  up, most of this
is late  fees  and  interest. I  tried   to   work things out,   but   they wouldn’t   take   $10
a week they wanted  $100s and  I  couldn’t afford it.” (Items 3, 7)
The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a was opened in 2004, and it was charged off in the
amount of $12,840  in November  2021.  The debt alleged  in  SOR ¶ 1.b  was  opened  in
August 2016, and it was placed for collection in the amount of $7,055 in December 2021.
In Applicant’s November 2021 response to CAF interrogatories, he indicated he had not
paid  or  resolved  either  of  these  debts.  Neither  debt  appear  on  his  August  2022  credit
bureau report (CBR), but he provided no documentation demonstrating he paid, resolved,
or disputed them. (Item 2; Item 4; Item 6 at 2; Item 7 at 3-4)
The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c was opened in October 2017, and it was placed for
collection  in  the  amount  of  $2,015  in  November  2021.  In  Applicant’s  November  2021
response to CAF interrogatories, he indicated that he had not paid or resolved this debt.
In  his Answer,  he  admitted  the  debt,  and  it  appears  on  his August  2022  CBR  with  an
outstanding balance of $2,059. He provided no documentation demonstrating he paid or
resolved it. (Item 2; Item 4; Item 5 at 3; Item 6 at 2; Item 7 at 4)
The medical account alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d was opened in October 2017, and it
was  placed  for  collection  in  the  amount  of  $1,495  in  November  2021.  In  Applicant’s
November 2021 response to  CAF interrogatories, he indicated that he had not paid or
resolved this debt. In his Answer, he  denied  the  debt and  claimed  the  creditor “did  not
use the proper medical code.” This debt does not appear on his August 2022 CBR. (Item
2; Item 4; Item 6 at 2-3; Item 7 at 4)
In November 2021, Applicant’s annual salary was approximately $90,200, and he
was the sole income earner for his family. His net monthly remainder was $245 and did
not include payments toward the debts alleged in the SOR. There is no evidence in the
record that he has received credit counseling. (Item 7 at 8, 11-12)
