Applicant is a 52-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his  current  employer  since  1999.  He  has  an  associate’s  degree  earned  in  1996  and
additional  education  and  certifications.  He  married  in  2001  and  divorced  in  2011.  He
has no children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 12-13, 22; GE 1)
Applicant has a history of tax issues. He did not file his federal and state income
tax returns for tax years 2010 through 2016, 2018, and 2019 when they were due.1  He
filed  his  returns  for  tax  year  2017  on  time,  but  the  IRS  thought  that  there  could  have
been identity theft. This was likely because Applicant legally changed his name in 2015.
He accepted responsibility for his tax failures, which he attributed to poor organizational
skills,  mild  depression,  and  procrastination.  He  described  a  bad  period  of  his  life  in
which he went through a divorce, he was balancing work, and he was taking care of his
aging parents. He asserted that he never intended to shirk his responsibility to pay his
taxes. (Tr. at 14-15, 20-27; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1; AE G, H)
Applicant reported his failure to file his federal and state tax returns from 2014 to
2016,  2018,  and  2019  on a  Questionnaire  for  National Security  Positions  (SF  86) that
he  submitted  in  October  2020.  He  gave  “procrastination”  as  the  reason,  and  he  wrote
that they were “[c]urrently being resolved.” (GE 1)
Applicant retained a tax professional in 2020. His federal and state tax returns for
2010 through 2016 and 2018 through 2020 were filed in May 2021. He estimated that,
with  penalties  and  interest,  he  paid  about  $10,000  in  taxes  for  the  tax  years  2010
through  2013.  His  federal  tax  liability  for  2014  was  originally  $12,713.  He  had  $8,907
withheld from his pay, leaving about $3,806 owed if he filed his return and paid his taxes
on  time.  With  penalties  and  interest,  the  balance  grew  to  $7,294,  which  he  paid  in
October 2022. (Tr. at 16-19, 22-23, 28-30; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-4; AE E,

Applicant’s  federal  tax liability  for 2015  was  originally $12,363.  He had  $11,747
withheld from his pay, leaving about $616 owed if he filed his return and paid his taxes
on  time.  With  penalties  and  interest,  the  balance  grew  to  $1,228,  which  he  paid  in
October 2022. (AE H)
Applicant would have been due a federal refund of $2,101 for tax year 2016 if his
tax return had been filed within three years of  the due date. He  received refunds from
the  IRS  of  $1,289  for  tax  year  2018;  $851  for  tax  year  2019;  and  $1,434  for  tax  year
2020.  He filed  his returns  for 2021 on time. He  owed  the IRS $805 for tax year 2021,
which he paid on time with his return. He does not owe the IRS or his state any taxes.

1  The  SOR  did  not  allege  any  tax  issues  before  tax  year  2014.  Any  matter  that  was  not  alleged  in  the
SOR  cannot  be  used  for  disqualification  purposes.  It  may be  considered  in  the  application  of  mitigating
conditions and in the whole-person analysis.
Applicant  stated  that  the  bad  period  in  his  life  is  over.  He  researched  ways  to
become  more  organized.  He  now  relies  on  a  tax  professional  to  file  his  returns.  His
finances  are  otherwise  in  good  shape.  He  stated  that  he  will  continue  to  file  his  tax
returns  and  pay  his  taxes  on  time.  He  requested  a  conditional  clearance  with
acknowledgment that failure to file his tax returns and pay his taxes on time could result
in the loss of his security clearance. (Tr. at 16-19, 27; AE A, D)
Applicant  submitted  documents  and  letters  attesting  to  his  excellent  job
performance  and  strong  moral  character.  He  is  praised  for  his  work  ethic,  reliability,
trustworthiness,  judgment,  expertise,  professionalism,  and  willingness  and  ability  to
protect classified information. (AE B, C)
