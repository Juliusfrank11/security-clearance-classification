Applicant is a 47-year-old civilian of a defense contractor who seeks a  security
clearance.  Admitted  facts  are  adopted  and  incorporated  by  reference.  Additional
findings of fact follow.
Background
Applicant married in February 1994 and divorced in March 2004. (GEs 1-2) She
has  two  children  (ages  26  and  13).  (GEs  1-3;  Tr. 31,  51)  She  earned  two  associate’s
degrees: one in May 2001 and another in December 2007. (GEs 1-2) Additionally, she
earned  a bachelor’s degree  in 2013 and has taken college  courses since  2013 without
earning any diplomas or degrees. (Tr. 31) Applicant reported no military service.
Since May 2017, Applicant has been employed full time by her current employer
as  a  debt  management  analyst.  (GE  2;  Tr.  32).  Previously,  she  worked  for  other
employers in various jobs. (GEs 1-2) She reported a lay off and ensuing unemployment
in 2015 and 2016.
Applicant’s finances
Burdened   by   her  2015   layoff   and   her  struggles  with   alcohol  and   managing   her
family’s  needs  as  a   single  mother,  Applicant  accumulated   a   number  of   delinquent
accounts:   six   delinquent  debts   altogether  exceeding   $42,000.  (GEs  7-8   and   AE   E;  Tr.
27,  34-35)  The   listed   delinquent   SOR   debts   are  comprised   of   the   following   consumer
accounts:  SOR ¶¶  1.a  (for $13,087); 1.b  (for  $595); 1.c (for $6,674); 1.d  (for $12,675);
1.e   (for  $7,327);  and1.f   (for  $1,375).   After  making   a  few   payments  on   her  SOR   debts
following   her  2015   layoff,  Applicant  ceased   making   any   payments   in  2016.  (GEs  4-5
and   7-8)   To   her  credit,   she   has  kept  her  student  loan   accounts   current   and   paid   off
some  of  her student loans. (AE  L; Tr. 27, 37-38) However, by  the  close  of  the  hearing,
her listed  SOR debts remained unresolved and outstanding. (GEs 7-8, 35)
Afforded an opportunity to provide updated documentation of her addressing her
delinquent  SOR  accounts,  Applicant  documented  her  employment  promotion  (AE  P)
and receipts of payments made to her retained debt repayment firm.  (AEs Q-R) Under
the  terms  of  her  repayment  plan,  she  obligated  herself  with  making  an  initial  upfront
payment  of  $2,078  with  monthly  payments  of  $1,784  until  her  scheduled  debts  are
satisfied. (AE Q) Each of her payments is scheduled for allocation among her six SOR-
listed  debts.  (AE  Q)  With  her  post-hearing  submissions,  Applicant  documented  her
progress  in  addressing  her  individual  delinquent  accounts.  (AE  R)  Her  initial  upfront
$2,078  payment  was  allocated  in  December  2022  in  accordance  with  a  pre-arranged
allocation schedule established by Applicant and her debt repayment firm. (AE R)
In  January 2022, Applicant earned  a  lateral-move  promotion with  her employer.
(AE  P)  The  promotion  raised  her  annual  base-pay  compensation  from  $78,021  to  a
current  base  salary  of  $95,000.  (GE  P;  Tr.  32-33)  Currently,  her  monthly  expenses
include medical bills ($500), a home mortgage ($1,000), and insurance ($300 to $400).
(Tr. 38-39) In emergencies, she can turn to an IRA retirement account that currently has

Applicant’s alcohol consumption history
Applicant was introduced to alcohol at the age of six. (GE 4; Tr. 41) Her mother’s
friends  would  give  her  alcohol  at  a  local  bowling  alley.  Between  January  2001  and
December 2015, Applicant incurred five alcohol-related arrests. (GEs 1-6, 7-11 and AEs
A-D and F; Tr. 41)
Over the course of these 15 years, she drank heavily recurrently and (beginning
in 2005) to the point of intoxication, despite periodic attempts to quit drinking. (GEs 4-5;
Tr. 25) She attributed her excessive drinking to her layoff, her abusive relationships, and
parenting  issues  related  to  her  son  who  was  born  out  of  wedlock  in  2009.
Ongoing
legal  custody  problems  continued
to  plague  and  disrupt  her
relationships  with  her  son  and  the  son’s  father.  (GEs  2  and  AEs  J-K)  Other  stresses
endured  by  Applicant  in  the  2013-2015  period  included  her  anxiety  over  the  expected
release  of  her  stepfather  from  prison  in  2014.  (AE  C)  Before  his  conviction  for  sexual
exploitation  of  a  minor,  Applicant  reported  her  observation  of  her  stepfather’s  peering
through a window to gaze at her daughter’s bathing. (Tr. 26-27)
Chronologically,  Applicant  incurred  her  first  driving  under  the  influence  arrest
(DUI)  and  charge  in  January  2001.  Appearing  in  court,  she  was  found  guilty,  fined,
sentenced  to  one  day  in  jail,  and  placed  on  probation.  (GEs  4-5,  9  and  11)  Probation
conditions  included  required  alcohol  classes,  which  she  satisfactorily  completed.  (Tr.
43)
Applicant  was  arrested  again  in  April  2007  and  charged  with  DUI.  Records
document  that  she  pled  guilty,  was  fined  $500,  was  sentenced  to  one  day  in  jail,  and
was  placed  on  12  months  of  probation.  (GEs  4-5  and  AE  C)  Probation  conditions
included attendance of alcohol classes that she successfully completed.
Following  her  2007  DUI  incident,  Applicant  quit  drinking  and  maintained  her
abstinence for about three years. (GEs 4-5; Tr. 43-44)  Recognizing she had an alcohol
problem, she voluntarily attended AA meetings in 2007. (Tr. 43)  A motivating factor for
Applicant’s  maintaining  her  sobriety  during  this  three-year  stretch  was  her  pregnancy
with  her  son  in  2009.  Her  pregnancy  prompted  her  to  place  more  focus  on  her family
and career. (Tr. 43)
In December 2013, Applicant was arrested and charged with her third DUI.  (GEs
4-5 and 9; Tr. 45, 48) She pled guilty and was found guilty as charged. She was fined
$1,000 and sentenced to one day in jail and 12 months of probation with a suspended
license.  (GEs  4-5)  Applicant  successfully  completed  her  sentence  and  performed  50
hours of community service. (GE 4; Tr. 46) Months later, she was successful in setting
aside  her  2013  conviction  for  good  cause  shown  on  the  strength  of  her  credited
satisfaction of the court’s ordered substance abuse counseling classes. (AE D)
In  August  2014,  Applicant  was  arrested  for  the  fourth  time  and  charged  with
felony  aggravated  DUI,  based on  a  registering  of  a  .22%  blood  alcohol content  (BAC)
reading.  (GEs  5-6  and  AE  F)  Appearing  in  court,  her  case  was  dismissed  without
prejudice for lack of any filed complaint. (GE 5 and AE F; Tr. 28) Applicant reported the
incident  to  her  employer  and  self-referred  herself  to  a  substance  abuse  center  (A
Center) for intensive outpatient therapy for her diagnosed post traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD)  and  alcohol  dependence.  (GE  6)  Applicant  documented  her  ten  visits  to  this
facility between April 2014 and May 2014. (AE 6)
Applicant  followed  up  her  sessions  with  A  Center  with  additional  outpatient
sessions with another outpatient service center (B Center) in October 2014. (AE H; Tr.
28-29)  Diagnosed  with  an  updated  alcohol-related  disorder,  Applicant  attended
outpatient  sessions  with  this  B  Center  facility  and  was  discharged  with  an  unchanged
diagnosis  in  August  2015.  (AE  H;  Tr.  28-29)  With  her  discharge,  she  received  a
recovery  certificate  recognizing  her  84  hours  of  received  health  services  from  her  A
Center therapists. (AE H)
The stresses Applicant experienced from her parenting challenges and struggles
with her stepfather following his release from prison were leading factors in influencing
her  to  give  up  the  drinking  that  had  produced  a  “snowball”  effect  on  her  and  created
such a “slippery slope” and reminder of the death of her father in 2014 from liver issues
associated with alcohol abuse. (AE C; Tr. 26)
In  December  2015,  Applicant  was  arrested  for  a  fifth  DUI  offense  and  charged
with  felony  aggravated  DUI.  (GEs  5  and  9)  These  charges  were  dismissed  with  no
finding of alcohol in Applicant’s system at the time of her arrest. (GEs 5 and 9 and AE I;
Tr. 28-29) While her driver’s license  was temporarily suspended in connection with her
2015 arrest, her driving privileges were restored on her appeal to her state’s department
of motor vehicles. (AE K)
Since  her  last  alcohol-related  incident  in  2014,  Applicant  has  maintained  her
complete  sobriety  (with  no  slips  or  relapses)  with  the  aid  of  a  sponsor  and  weekly
attendance  at  AA  meetings.  (Tr.  55-56)  These  meetings  are  co-meetings  (men  and
women both) and include individual testimonials  and working the 12  steps.  (Tr. 55-56)
reinforced  her  sustained  abstinence  assurances  with  earned  chips

commemorating her eight years of maintained sobriety. (AE O)
Applicant’s  licensed  family  therapist  further  corroborated  Applicant’s  sustained
sobriety  over  the  past  eight  years.  (AE  M)  Noting  her  first  meeting  with  Applicant  in
2009,  the  therapist  confirmed  her  continuing  counseling  sessions  with  Applicant
“throughout the years” based around alcohol dependence, the factors that contributed to
her substance  abuse, and the  challenges she  continued  to  endure because  of it. (AE  M)
In  taking  her background  history, Applicant’s family  therapist traced  her earlier struggles
with   alcohol  dependence,  fueled   by   employment  and   family   difficulties  in  her  personal
life.   (AE   M) Applicant’s family   therapist  credited  her with  both   sustained   sobriety   since
2014, and  turning her life around with her work and  family relationships. (AE M)
Besides  seeing   her  family   therapist,  Applicant  has  consulted   with   a   licensed
health  provider for treatments  of her diagnosed  attention  deficit  disorder (ADD). (Tr. 29)
Her  treatment  sessions  have   helped   her  to   improve   her  focus  and   ability   to   endure
impulsive  behaviors and  hyperactivity. (AE  J-M; Tr.  29)  Out  of her desire  to  help  other
recovering   alcoholics,  she   obtained   her  certification   from   her  residence   state   as  a
recovery support specialist.  See  Applicant’s response to SOR.
