In  Applicant’s answer to  the  SOR, he  admitted  SOR  ¶¶ 1.a-1.h. His admissions
are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  62  years-old.  He  has  worked  as  an  administrative  technician  for  a
defense  contractor  since  December  2012.  He  has  held  a  security  clearance  since
November 2012. He earned his associates degree in 2012 and is currently attending an
online seminary college. He is able to attend cost free because he is a church member.
Applicant has been married for 38 years. He has three adult children. One of his
children is currently living at home.
Applicant’s eight delinquent debts total over $378,000. The debts are established
by his SCA, two credit reports, and his ESI. (Items 3-4 and 6-7.) The specific debts in the
SOR are as follows:
SOR  ¶¶   1.a-1.b:  past-due  accounts  charged-off  for  $26,667  and  $20,157
respectively. FORM Item 4 shows the status of the debts as closed and a last activity date
of May 2019 and a last activity date of November 2016. (Item 4 at 2 and 3.) The accounts
remain delinquent because Applicant states he challenged some aspects of the debts in
his state’s judicial system, up to his state’s court of appeals. The decision did not go in
his favor and he is waiting the final disposition instructions from the Court. (Answer at 3.)
SOR  ¶   1.c:  past-due  account  charged-off  for  $2,477.  FORM  Item  4  shows  the
status  of  the  debt  as  closed  and  a  last  activity  date  of  December  2021.  (Item  4  at  3.)
Applicant states the account remains delinquent due to the creditor not contacting him in
many years, which caused him to believe it had been settled. (Answer at 3.)
SOR  ¶   1.d:   past-due  account  charged-off  for  $1,210.  FORM  Item  4  shows  the
status  of  the  debt  as  closed  and  a  last  activity  date  of  November  2021.  (Item  4  at  4.)
Applicant states he believed this debt was going to be included  in his new re-financed
mortgage. (Answer at 4.)
SOR ¶  1.e: past-due utility account referred for collection for $134. FORM Item 4
shows a last activity date of November 2021. (Item 4 at 4.) Applicant states he incurred
the debt on a rental property he sold and the debt was not noticed or accounted for prior
to the sale. (Answer at 4.)
SOR ¶ 1.f: past-due medical account referred for collection for $80. FORM Item 4
shows a last activity date of November 2021. (Item 4 at 5.) Applicant states this debt was
incurred for services provided to a family member that he believed would be paid under
his health insurance policy. (Answer at 4.) He offered a payment summary showing he
had paid the debt by credit card in July 2022. (Answer at 8.)
SOR ¶  1.g: past-due mortgage account for $164,869, with a total loan balance of
$381,477  that  is  in  foreclosure  status.  (Item  4  at  6.)  Applicant  states  the  mortgage
payments were consistently made on time until a credit report error. He notes the account
remains  delinquent  while  the  lender  is  pursuing  a  foreclosure  action  to  re-claim  the
property. (Answer at 4.)
SOR  ¶   1.h:  past-due  home  equity  loan  for  $163,126,  with  a  total  balance  of
$289,018. (Item 4 at 6.) This debt was incurred when he took a loan against his primary
residence to obtain funds to start his Limited Liability Company (LLC).
Applicant  in  his  answer  explained  that  in  early  2012,  he  and  his  brother-in-law
formed an LLC “to acquire real estate for the purpose of investment (buy houses cheap,
make some needed repairs, then re-sell for a profit).” The LLC was a single member LLC,
and he was the sole member. His brother-in-law lacked the financial resources and credit
history to be a formal partner. However, his brother-in-law was experienced in buying and
selling real estate, so he handled finding properties and securing financing for the LLC.
Applicant handled repair work and hiring contractors. However, when Applicant began his
career  with  his  sponsor  in  December  2012,  he  found  he  had  significantly  less  time  to
spend on the LLC to expedite repair work and oversee transactions.
Applicant states in 2014 an erroneous action on the part of a lender resulted in the
LLC being unable to secure financing to buy properties and make necessary repairs to
attract  home  buyers.  This  error  and  the  ramifications  of  it  resulted  in  the  LLC  being
dissolved in 2017. (Item 7 at 5.).
