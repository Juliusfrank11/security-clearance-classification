Applicant is 59 years old. In 1982, he enlisted in the U.S. Army National Guard. He
received  an  honorable  discharge  at  the  rank  of  private  first  class  (PFC)  in  1991.  He
earned  an  associate’s  degree  in  1999.  He  has  never  married  and  does  not  have  any
children. From 2010 to February 2016, he was employed as a contract truck driver with
another  co-driver,  his  roommate  as  well  as  the  owner  and  operator  of  the  truck.  They
hauled classified cargo for a government contractor. Applicant’s DOD security clearance
was issued in 2010. (GE 1; Tr. 31-32, 37-38)
The co-driver appeared at the hearing and testified as a witness for Applicant. He
stated  that  beginning  in  February  2016,  Applicant  became  unexpectedly  unemployed
after he (co-driver) suffered a serious medical issue and was unable to work for several
months. Applicant was unemployed for about eight months, which seriously diminished
his  finances.  After  he  (co-driver)  recovered  from  his  surgery,  he  moved  out  of  the
residence,  accepted  employment  with  another  company,  and  no  longer  needed
Applicant’s services as a co-driver. This was another unanticipated event since Applicant
thought  he  would  resume  working  with  him  once  he  fully  recovered.  At  that  point,
Applicant  decided  he  would  take  any  employment  he  could  find  since  his  debts  were
substantial  and  he  no  longer  had  a  roommate  to  split  housing  expenses.  He  found
employment for minimal pay at a poultry farm. His weekly net pay at the poultry farm was
about $300 a week, and his current weekly net pay as a co-driver is about $1,000 per
week. In May 2018, his former co-driver requested that they work together again hauling
classified  cargo for their  previous  government  contractor.  Applicant  accepted his offer.
Applicant’s annual salary is approximately $60,000. (GE 1; Tr. 30-34, 46; AE K)

Character Evidence
Applicant’s witness and co-driver had previously served with Applicant in the U.S,
Army National Guard for a brief period of time. He recommended that Applicant’s security
clearance be continued since he considered Applicant completely trustworthy. In addition,
Applicant  submitted  a  letter  of  recommendation  from  the  government  contractor’s
assistant  facility  security  officer.  She  reported  that  Applicant  had  been  previously
employed  from  October  2010  to  May  2016.  In  May  2018,  he  was  rehired  without
reservation. During his career, Applicant has safely transported classified cargo without
incident. She considers Applicant to be an exemplary employee. (Tr. 30, 33-34; AE L)
