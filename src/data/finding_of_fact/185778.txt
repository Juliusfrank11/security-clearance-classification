Applicant  is  45  years  old,  married,  and  has  two  minor  children.  He  earned  his
Bachelor’s  degree  in  2000  and  a  certification  in  2009.  Applicant  has  worked  as  an
engineer since  2008  and  has  been  with  his sponsoring  employer since  October 2020.
He was granted national security eligibility in May 2012 in connection with his employment
with a Government contractor at that time. He seeks to retain his eligibility and security
clearance in connection with his current employment. (Item 4 at Sections 2, 12, 13A, 17,
18, 25.)
Paragraph 1  - Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
The  Government  alleged  in  the  SOR  that  Applicant  is  ineligible  for  a  security
clearance because of his illegal use of a controlled substance, marijuana. The three SOR
allegations are supported by Applicant’s admissions in his Answer and in his Response.
The  allegations  are  also  evidenced  by  Applicant’s  statements  in  his  e-QIP and  a  prior
security clearance application, dated March 8, 2012 (2012 SCA), and his comments made
during  interviews  with  investigators  from  the Office  of  Personnel Management  held  on
December 31, 2020, and March 20, 2012. (Items 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6; Response.)
The details regarding  the  three  SOR allegations and  Applicant’s admissions  are
as follows:
1.a. THC use from August 1995 to December 2018. In high school and  college,
Applicant  frequently  used  marijuana.  He  continued  using  marijuana  in  the  early  2000s
after  his  graduation  from  college,  but  that  use  significantly  decreased  as  his  career
progressed. After his marriage in 2007 and the birth of his first child in 2009, his use of
marijuana  became  “very rare.” During  the  period  from  2013  to  2016, he  used  marijuana
about one  time  per year on  average, typically during  camping  trips with  college  friends in
the  rural state  in which  they all  lived  at  that time  and  attended  college  together.  His friends
were  using  marijuana, and  he  wanted  to  feel involved. With  the  birth  of his second  child
in 2014  and  his  relocation  of his family to  a  state  across  the  country late  that  year,  he  saw
little  of  his camping  friends with  one  exception. He used  marijuana  with  that  friend  in  2015
and  2016. He used  marijuana  again  one  last time  in  December 2018.  He has not used
marijuana   in  more  than   four  years  because   he   is  a   “family  man”  and   is  dedicated   to
working   hard   to   support  his  family.  He  also  noted   that  he   understands   that  using
marijuana   is inconsistent  with  holding   a   security  clearance   and   he   no   longer enjoys  it.
(Item  3 at 41; Item 4  at 10, 32; Item  6 at 3.)
1.b. Use of marijuana after submitting his 2012 SCA. Applicant continued to use
marijuana  after  he  signed  his  2012  e-QIP,  as  described  above.  He  commented  in  his
2012 e-QIP that he does not plan on using marijuana again. (Item 3 at 41; Item 4 at 34;
Item 5 at 3-4, 8.)
1.c.  Use  of  marijuana  in  December  2018  while  holding  a  security  clearance.
Applicant was granted national security eligibility and a security clearance in about May
2012.  This allegation  is focused  solely on  Applicant’s  one-time use  in December 2018
while holding a security clearance. The reason for this limitation is unclear. In his e-QIP,
Applicant wrote that his use of marijuana was “very infrequent” and was “less than once
a year at most” during the past seven years (2013 to 2020). He also wrote in his e-QIP
and in his Answer that he does not intend to use marijuana in the future because of his
family responsibilities and his “rewarding career.” In his Response, Applicant noted that
he intends “to continue to abstain from all drug involvement and acknowledge[s] that any
future involvement is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.” He wrote that
his one-time use in 2018 at a New Year’s Eve party in December of that year “was the
last time I ever used THC. He also wrote that the use of marijuana was “not an enjoyable
experience.” He  expressed  his regret  for “his momentary  lack of judgment” “late  in the
evening” in which another person possessed the illegal drug. He also noted that he has
promised his wife that he will never again take any action that might jeopardize his ability
to  support  her  and  their  two  children.  Applicant  noted  that  he  takes  this  promise  very
seriously. (Item 2 at 1, 2; Item 3 at 41; Item 4 at 32; Item 6 at 4; Response at 4.)
Paragraph 2  –  Guideline E, Personal Conduct
The Government cross-alleged the three allegations set forth in paragraph 1 of the
SOR under the Personal Conduct guideline.
