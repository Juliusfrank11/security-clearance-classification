Applicant, age 33, is unmarried, and has been living with her partner since at least
2018. They have three children who are 4, 10, and 13 years old. She attended college
courses from 2009 to 2015, but did not obtain a degree, and there is no record evidence
of  how  many  credit  hours  she  competed.  She  has  worked  for  Department  of  Defense
(DOD) contractors since July 2015, and she has worked as a human resources consultant
for  her  current  employer  since  August  2019.  This  is  her  first  DOD  security  clearance
application, but she previously held a clearance during her 2010 to 2015 internship for
another government agency. (Item 1; Item 7)
The SOR alleged that Applicant has nine delinquent debts totaling approximately
$89,917.  Two  of  the  alleged  delinquent  debts  are  student  loans  totaling  $76,031.  She
admitted all of the allegations and indicated that she was working to repay and negotiate
settlement arrangements. The debts are substantiated by the two credit bureau reports
(CBRs)  in  the  record.  She  attributed  her  financial  problems  largely  to  being  a  single
mother, living beyond her means in the past, and not managing her money well. (Item 1;
Item 3; Item 5; Item 6; Item 7)
SOR  ¶ 1.a: This cable  account was placed for collection in 2021, in the amount of
$594.  During   Applicant’s  January  2022   interview  with   a   government  investigator,  she
acknowledged  the debt and  indicated  her intent to  resolve  it. She  claimed  in her Answer
that  she  “was slowly working  to  repay the  debt in  full.” This debt does not appear on  her
August 2022  CBR; however, she  did not provide  documentation  to  demonstrate  payments
or resolution of the debt.  (Item  3; Item 6  at 4; Item 7 at 5)
The   debts  alleged   SOR  ¶¶   1.b,   1.c,   and   1.d   are   for  credit-card  accounts  that
Applicant opened  between  July 2011  and  October 2016, and  they were  charged  off  or
placed  for collection  in  the  following  amounts:  $712;  $422;  and  $485, respectively.  She
stopped   making   payments  on   these   accounts   between   2016   and   2019.   During   her
January 2022  interview, she  said she  was going  to  reach  out to  the  creditors and  set up
payment agreements. In  her Answer, she  indicated  she  was working  to  settle each  of the
debts with  the  creditors but provided  no  supporting  documentation.  (Item  3; Item  5  at 3-
4; Item 6  at 4-5; Item 7 at 3-4)
The  debt alleged  in SOR  ¶  1.e  is for a  vehicle  that  Applicant purchased  in  July
2016 for $17,211. The monthly payment was $718, and she stopped making payments
in  approximately  July  2017,  because  she  could  no  longer  afford  the  vehicle.  It  was
voluntarily repossessed at a date not in the record. The deficiency balance is $10,397,
and she provided no documentation to demonstrate payments or resolution of the debt.
(Item 3; Item 4 at 39-40; Item 5 at 5; Item 6 at 10; Item 7 at 3-4)
The federal student-loan debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.f ($46,891) and 1.g ($29.140)
were opened by Applicant in February 2018 as consolidated federal student loans with
the Department of Education (ED). She last attended college in 2015, and was required
to start making payments toward her student loans in 2017. She told the investigator that
she  believed  she  made  four  $189  payments  in  early  2018.  Her  August  2022  CBR
indicates that her last payments were made in April 2018. There is no evidence in the
record that she has made any other payments toward her student loan accounts. (Item 3;
Item 4 at 35-39; Item 5 at 6; Item 7 at 2-3, 5)
Applicant  indicated  in  her  January  2022  interview  that  she  hoped  to  enroll  in  a
forgiveness program with the ED. In her Answer, she restated that she was “applying for
loan forgiveness and payment arrangements,” but provided no documentation to support
her  assertions.  There  is  no  evidence  in  the  record  from  either  party  regarding  the
applicability  of  the  COVID-19  related  Coronavirus  Aid,  Relief,  and  Economic  Security
(CARES) Act to  Applicant’s  federal student loans. Her loans continue to show as past
due in the August 2022 CBR; however, her required monthly payment for both loans is
reported as “$0”; therefore, it is likely that it is applicable to her.  (Item 3; Item 4 at 35-39;
Item 5 at 6; Item 7 at 2-3, 5)
The  $736  utility  account  alleged  SOR  ¶  1.h  was  placed  for  collection  in
approximately November 2021. Applicant believes this account is related to a home she
rented from 2016 to 2017, and according to her Answer, she was working with the creditor
“to pay off the final bill owed to [it].” This debt does not appear on her August 2022 CBR;
however, she did not provide documentation to demonstrate payments or resolution of
the debt. (Item 3; Item 6 at 4; Item 7 at 5)
Applicant indicated that the $540 cable account alleged in SOR ¶ 1.i is seven years
old, and she is working to resolve it. The account does not appear on her August 2022
CBR; however, she did not provide documentation to demonstrate payments or resolution
of the debt. (Item 3; Item 6 at 5; Item 7 at 4-5)
Applicant’s current total yearly income is approximately $99,000. In addition to her
full-time job, she also works part time as a bartender and as an Uber/Lyft driver. She did
not provide documentation regarding her partner’s income. There is no evidence that she
has sought or received financial counseling or follows a written budget. (Item 3; Item 7)
