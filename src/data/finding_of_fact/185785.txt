Applicant is a 35-year-old employee of a government contractor for whom he has
worked  since  December  2018.  He  has  attended  several  vocational  or  online  colleges
but has not earned a degree or certificate. He has been married since 2014, but he has
lived  separate  and  apart  from  his  spouse  without  being  legally  separated  since  about
2020.  He  has  three  children,  ages  11,  9,  and  4.  He  also  had  a  daughter  who  passed
away  in  a  car  accident  in  July  2015.  He  served  with  the  Virginia  National  Guard  from
2010 until 2017 and has since served with the Maryland National Guard. (Items 1, 7)
In  the  SOR,  the  Government  alleged  Applicant’s  16  delinquent  debts  totaling
approximately  $36,000  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.p).  These  delinquencies  consist  of  the
following:  car  loans  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b);  child  support  (SOR  ¶  1.c);  medical  debts
(SOR  ¶¶  1.d,  1.e,  1.g,  1.j,  1.n,  and  1.p);  student  loans  (SOR  ¶¶  1.i,  and  1.k  through
1.m); a credit card (SOR ¶ 1.f); and phone bills (SOR ¶¶ 1.h and 1.o). He admitted the
SOR  allegations  except  for  those  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.o  and  1.p,  which  he  denied.  His
admissions  are  adopted  as  findings  of  fact.  All  the  SOR  allegations  are  established
through  his  admissions  and  the  Government’s  credit  reports.  Most  of  the  SOR  debts
became delinquent between November 2017 and June 2020. (Items 2, 4-6)
Applicant  settled  the  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.f  through  voluntary  payments  before  the
SOR  was  issued.  He  provided  documentary  corroboration  to  that  effect  to  the  DOD
investigator during his April 2022 security interview. Prior to the SOR being issued, he
made a payment arrangement with the creditor of the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b to pay $249 per
month.  He  provided  documentary  corroboration  of  this  arrangement  to  the  DOD
investigator,  but  he  has  not  provided  documentary  corroboration  that  he  has  made
these payments. The Government’s March 2022 credit report reflects a balance on this
account  that  is  only  about  $20  less  than  the  balance  on  the  2020  Government  credit
report,  so  he  does  not  appear  to  be  complying  with  those  payment  arrangements.
(Items 3-7)
Applicant claimed that he settled the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.i and 1.l before the SOR
was  issued.  However,  he  has  not  provided  documentary  corroboration  that  he  settled
these accounts. He claimed that he is paying an additional $50 per month towards his
arrearage on the debt in SOR ¶ 1.c, but he has not provided documentary corroboration
of this assertion. For the remainder of the SOR debts he admitted, he  claimed that he
will  either  settle  or  make  payment  arrangements  on  those  accounts.  He  provided  no
information about the basis for his denial of SOR ¶¶ 1.o and 1.p. (Items 2, 7)
Applicant  fell behind  on  his  debts  after  his daughter  passed  away in  2015,  and
his spouse could not work because of her grief. He became the sole earner and could
not make ends meet.  He  was unemployed for about a  year from 2013 until 2014. He
was  also  placed  on  unpaid  leave  with  his  current  employer  from  November 2021  until
January  2022  because  his  security  clearance  had  “expired.”  According  to  the
information  he  provided  to  the  investigator  during  his  April  2022  security  interview,  he
spends  more  money  each  month  than  he  earns,  but  stays  afloat  by  borrowing  money
from  his parents every month  or so.  Applicant  did  not  respond  to  the  FORM,  so more
recent information about his finances is not available. (Items 3, 7)
