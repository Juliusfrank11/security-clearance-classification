Applicant is a 39-year-old employee of a government contractor for whom he has

(Item 3)
The SOR alleged two years of unfiled federal tax returns and related past-due tax
debt. Applicant did not timely file his federal income tax returns for the 2017 and 2018
tax  years,  despite  being  required  to  do  so  (SOR  ¶  1.a).  He  owed  delinquent  federal
income taxes in the approximate amount of $7,800 for the 2017 tax year (after an offset
for a refund from a subsequent tax year) (SOR ¶ 1.b). (Items 1-4)
Applicant filed his late income tax return for the 2017 tax year in February 2020.
He filed his late federal income tax return for the 2018 tax year in May 2022. He timely
filed his 2019 and 2020 federal income tax returns. He originally owed about $16,000 in
delinquent federal taxes for the 2017 tax year, but he received a credit of about $8,000
in April 2021, because of an offset from his income tax refund for the 2020 tax year. He
claimed  that  he  hired  a  tax  professional  on  an  unspecified  date  to  assist  him  with  his
taxes and believed that he will not end up owing any delinquent taxes. He provided no
documentary evidence to  corroborate  his belief  that  he  will not  owe  delinquent federal
taxes,  or  to  rebut  the  information  contained  in  the  2017  IRS  tax  account  transcript.
(Items 1-4)
Applicant  claimed  that he failed to timely file his 2017 and 2018 federal income
tax returns because he did not think he would have enough money to pay the taxes he
would  owe.  He  also  claimed  that  his  purchase  of  a  new  house  and  resultant  move
contributed to him missing the aforementioned income tax filing deadlines. He claimed
that  he  has  been  filing  his  income  tax  returns  for  23  years  and  has  not  had  any  tax
issues  other  than  for  these  two  years.  He  does  not  currently  have  a  payment  plan  in
place with the IRS, but plans to make one in the future if he still owes delinquent taxes.
In  May  2022,  he  provided  a  written  budget  that  reflected  a  monthly  surplus  of  almost
$5,000. He also claimed that he sold his house and used a portion of the proceeds to
pay  off  several  of  his  debts.  Applicant  did  not  respond  to  the  FORM,  so  more  recent
information about his finances is not available. (Items 1-4)
