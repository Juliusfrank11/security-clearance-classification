Applicant  admitted   all   of  the   SOR  allegations   (¶¶   1.a-1.c,  1.e-1.l),   except  for  ¶
1.d.  His   admissions  are  adopted   as  findings  of  fact.   After  a   careful   review  of  the
pleadings and  evidence, I make the  following  additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  56  years  old.  He  has  worked  for  his  current  employer,  a  defense
contractor,  since  November  2019,  as  an  information  systems  security  officer.  Since
2004, he has worked for various federal contractors. He holds a bachelor’s degree. He
is  married,  since  December  2020,  and  has  one  minor  child.  He  has  held  a  security
clearance since approximately 2002. (Items 2-3).
The SOR alleged Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in April 2013, resulting
in  a discharge in July 2013  (SOR ¶ 1.a); incurred nine delinquent debts,  comprised of
student loans and consumer debts totaling $177,801 (of which approximately $160,000
derive from his student loans) (¶¶ 1.b-1.j); and failed to file his 2019 and 2020 federal
and state income tax returns (¶¶ 1.k-1.l).
Court  records  establish  that  Applicant  filed  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  in  April  2013
and  his  dischargeable  debts  were  discharged  later  that  year.  He  listed  assets  of
approximately  $65,000  and  liabilities  of  over  $181,000  in  his  petition.  Included  in  his
liabilities,  were  approximately  $100,000  of  delinquent  student  loans.  They  were  not
discharged.  Applicant received  financial  counseling  as part of  the  bankruptcy  process.
(Items 3-4, 11)
Applicant admitted having delinquent student loans of approximately $159,000 in
his  SOR  answer.  He  further  stated  that  he  was  “Pending  to  make  arrangements  for
monthly payments.” He failed to provide any evidence that he set up any payment plans
for his student loans. His student loans were initially placed in collection in June 2014.
Applicant  claimed  the  loans  were  then  put  in  deferment  for  a  period.  They  were
subsequently placed in collection in June 2018. (Items 4, 6, 8; SOR answer)
Applicant admitted  failing  to  file his 2019  and  2020  federal and  state  income  tax
returns.  He claimed  the  reason  he  failed  to  file  was because  he  owed  federal taxes in
the   amount  of   over  $6,000   and   he   did  not   have   the   funds  to   pay.  He  produced   no
evidence   that  he   has  subsequently   filed   his  federal   and   state   tax   returns.   Since
Applicant’s   owing   of  federal  taxes  for  2019   was  not   alleged   in   the   SOR,  I  will   not  use
that   information   for   disqualification   purposes,  but  I  may   consider   it  as   it  relates   to   the
applicability  of any mitigating  conditions and  in  my whole-person  assessment.  (Items 2-
3; SOR  answer)
The  SOR  also  alleged  Applicant  owed  seven  delinquent  consumer  accounts
totaling approximately $17,725. (¶¶ 1.d-1.j) He admitted these debts in his background
interview and in his SOR answer, except for ¶ 1.d, which he denied. That debt no longer
appears on Applicant’s credit reports and is resolved for him. The remaining debts are
reported  as  delinquent  debts  in  credit  reports  from  February  2020,  July  2021,  and
November 2022. He provided no documentary evidence showing that he contacted the
creditors,  established  payment  plans,  or  paid  any  of  the  remaining  debts.  (Items  3-8;
SOR answer)
Applicant  cited  a  number  of  reasons  leading  to  his  financial  difficulties.  These
reasons included being told to reestablish his credit after his bankruptcy by using credit
cards, experiencing job layoffs, having low paying jobs, being involved in a serious car
accident, and having to deal with the death of his parents. He indicated that he sought
financial counseling with a debt relief company, but failed to produce any documentation
reflecting any actions he or the company took on his behalf. Applicant stated during his
background interview in October 2021, that his net monthly income is $2,576 and total
monthly expenses of $4,880, leaving a monthly deficit of $2,123. (Items 3-4)
