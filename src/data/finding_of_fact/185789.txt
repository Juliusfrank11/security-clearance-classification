In  his  answer,  Applicant  admitted  all  the  SOR  allegations  (¶¶  1.a-1.j).  His
admissions  are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  Based  on  my  review  of  the
pleadings, evidence submitted, and testimony, I make the following additional findings of
fact:
Applicant  is  37  years  old.  He  has  never  been  married  and  has  no  children.  He
attended trade school in 2014. He has worked for a government contractor as a maritime
electrician since 2018. (Tr. 11-12; GE 1)
The    SOR  alleges    Applicant’s  tax    filing    issues  and    delinquent  debts.    He    cited
different  reasons  for  his  financial  problems.  He  stated   that  he   had   unstable  living
circumstances  between  2013-2018  because  he  did  not earn  enough  money to  be  able  to
lease  a  place  of  his own. He asserted  that in  2014  he  had  an  injury which  kept him  out of
work for several weeks. He reported  that he  lived  in his car for about  five  months in  2014
while attending  trade  school. He rented  rooms and  stayed  with  friends for several years
after.  He   claimed  that he   was depressed   at   the   time  and   his finances  were  not on  his
mind.  He also did not file  his income  tax returns  during  that time  period. (Tr. 21-25, 59-
60)
The SOR alleges failure to file six years of Federal and state tax returns, and about
$14,052 of delinquent debt including $11,745 of student loans, $601 of consumer debt,
and $1,706 of medical debt. The status of the allegations is as follows:
SOR ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b concern  Applicant’s failure to  file Federal  and  state  income
returns for tax years  (TY) 2013-2018.  Applicant  admitted  that he  had  not  yet filed  these
returns,  but  claimed  that he  was working  on  it. He stated  that he  did  not file these  returns
because  it was  not  on  his mind, and  thought  that he  had  five  years to  file.  He claimed  that
he  tried  to  file his 2019  tax returns,  but they were  rejected. He claimed  that he  was able
to  file his 2020  returns,  and  stated  that he  filed  his 2021  returns late.  He submitted  three
unsigned  and  undated  Form  1040s for tax  years 2019-2021. These  forms  show  that  he
should be  due  refunds  for 2019  and  2020, but owes about $2,500  for 2021. He  did not
submit  sufficient documentation  to  show that  these  returns  were  filed  or that his tax debt
from  2021  was paid. He also submitted  W-2  wage  and  tax statements for tax years 2016-
2021, which  do  not show whether  his returns were  filed  for these  years. His tax  issues
remain unresolved.  (Tr. 26-39, 55-58; GE  2;  AE  G-O)
SOR ¶¶  1.c-1.f and  1.j are medical debts placed for collection for $136, $406, $574,
$292,  and  $352,  respectively.  The  debts  originate  from  the  2012–2018  timeframe.
Applicant  claimed  that  he  paid  these  debts  in  2019  or  2020,  but  did  not  provide  any
documentation supporting this claim. These debts remain unresolved. (Tr. 39-42, 48-49;
GE 3, 4, 5)
SOR  ¶   1.g   is  a  debt  in  collection  for  cellular  phone  service  for  $601.  Applicant
stated that this debt became delinquent in 2015, and he forgot about it. He claimed that
it was paid in  October 2022, but did not  provide  any documentation  supporting  this claim.
This debt remains unresolved. (Tr. 42-44; GE  3, 4, 5)
SOR  ¶¶  1.h  and  1.i  are  student  loans  in  collection,  for  $4,217  and  $7,528,
respectively. Applicant incurred these loans when he attended trade school in 2014. He
admitted that  he never made  any payments on  these  loans.  He  claimed  that  when  he
checked on the loans a couple of years ago the balances were zero and he was told that
he did not owe anything on them. He did not provide any documentation supporting this
claim.  In  his  post-hearing  submission,  he  stated  that  he  found  out  that  he  was  still
responsible for these loans, and he will sign-up for relief. These debts remain unresolved.
(Tr. 44-48; GE 3, 4, 5)
Applicant’s budget  shows that he is meeting his monthly expenses, and that his
current monthly income exceeds his expenses by about $1,500. He has not had any credit
counseling. Applicant submitted three employment records showing that since 2020, he
has received two merit increases and a cash award from his employer. (Tr. 52-53; AE C,
D, E, F)
