In his Answer, Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b, without further comment.
His  admissions  are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings
of fact.
Applicant  is  30  years  old.  He  has  never  married  and  he  has  no  children.  He
earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2017.  In  June  2020,  he  began  working  for  his  current
employer and sponsor for a position of public trust. On his application, he disclosed “at
least”  daily  use  of  marijuana  from  September  2016  to  August  2021,  the  month  he
submitted his application. He  indicated that he enjoyed smoking marijuana, and would
continue to do so. He also said:
I am  aware of the  consequences  for  smoking  weed, and  I  know  what type
of trouble I can get in if this is a concern to  anybody. I am a respectful user
and  only  smoke  when  I am  in the  apartment and  have  no  intentions  to  go
anywhere. (Item  3 at 32)
In his background interview two months later, Applicant indicated that he had continued
purchasing and using marijuana and would continue to do so. (Item 4)
The  SOR  alleges  Applicant’s  purchase  and  use  of  marijuana  with  varying
frequency,  from  September  2016  to  August  2021,  and  his  stated  intention  to  continue
using  it.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b,  respectively)  Applicant  admitted  both  allegations  in  his
answer to  the  SOR  without further comment.  He  did  not  respond  to  the  FORM,  so he
offered no new information that could mitigate his past conduct or future intentions.
