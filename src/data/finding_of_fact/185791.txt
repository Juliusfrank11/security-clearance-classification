Applicant, age 54, has been married and divorced three times. She was married
for less than a year in 1992, from 1999 to 2004, and from 2005 to 2012. She has three
adult children who are approximately 22, 27, and 32 years old. In 2011, she received an
associate degree in general studies, and in 2021, she received  a  bachelor’s degree in
business administration management. She has worked as an administrative assistant for
her current employer, a DOD contractor, since April 2018. She served on active duty in
the  U.S.  Army  from  2007  to  2017,  and  was  honorably  discharged  as  a  sergeant.  She
served in Iraq from May 2009 to May 2010, and has held a DOD security clearance since
approximately 2008. (Items 1-3, 7; AE A; AE I; AE J)
The SOR alleged that Applicant has fifteen delinquent debts totaling approximately
$71,031. She admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.g; however, I construed her explanations
as de facto denials, because she indicated these debts were either paid, resolved, two of
her ex-husbands’ responsibility, or unknown to her. She denied the remaining Guideline
F allegations. She admitted the Guideline E allegation, that she falsified her 2018 SCA
by failing to disclose the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.o; however, because she
explained that her failure to disclose the debts was unintentional, I construed her answer
as a de facto denial. (Items 1-2, 7; AE A)
Applicant   attributed   her  financial  problems  largely  to   being   a   single   mother,   her
divorces,  a  lack  of  financial  support  from  her  sons’  three  fathers,  a  period  of
unemployment  (December  2017  to  March 2018) after she  left the  Army, and  her middle
child’s extensive  medical  bills and  treatment  for numerous  medical  conditions,  including
terminal brain  cancer. She  left the  Army due  to  her middle son’s extensive medical issues
and  his need  for specialized  medical care. (Items 2, 7; AE  A; AE  E)
In  Applicant’s  October  2018  SCA,  she  failed  to  disclose  any  of  her  delinquent
debts,  but  she  disclosed  that  while  she  was  on  active  duty  she  was  counseled  or
disciplined  for  misusing  her  Government  credit  card  in  2016.  (Item  3)  During  her
December 2018 personal subject interview, the government investigator confronted her
regarding many of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. (Items 3-7)
SOR  ¶  1.a:  This  automobile  loan  was  opened  in  July  2016,  in  the  amount  of
$26,326. The last payment was made in approximately October 2017, and it was charged
off in the amount of $10,895. This debt is a duplicate of SOR ¶ 1.o, as both accounts were
opened in the same month. Although the account number for SOR ¶ 1.a is incomplete in
the credit bureau reports (CBR), the available account numbers in other portions of the
record match for both allegations. This debt remains outstanding in her most recent CBR.
(Item 2; 4 at 7; Item 5 at 6; Item 6 at 11)
During  Applicant’s  December  2018  interview,  she  told  the  investigator  that  a
vehicle she purchased with her son was damaged by hail. Her insurance company, which
also happens to be the creditor alleged in SOR ¶ 1.i, took possession of the vehicle and
subsequently paid off the loan. In her Answer to the SOR, she inconsistently indicated
there  was  a  recall  on  the  engine  that  the  manufacturer  did  not  honor.  She  “called  the
company  and  told  them  what  the  issue  was  and  they  stated  that  they  would  take  the
[vehicle] back and send it to auction and the balance would be paid off.” She also claimed
in  her  Answer  that  “we”  are  making  payments  but  did  not  provide  substantiating
documents. (Item 2 at 6, 9; Item 7 at 5-6)
SOR ¶ 1.b:  This account was opened in May 2017, and it was charged off in the
amount of $6,614, after it became delinquent in November 2017. Applicant claimed in her
Answer that she paid this debt when she left active duty. In her response to the FORM,
she provided documentation that this creditor overcharged her $1,071 in interest that was
refunded to her in April 2022 via a check. However, her most recent CBR, dated August
2022, indicates the balance for the alleged debt is currently $9,858, and the original loan
details are consistent with the debt alleged in the SOR. (Item 2 at 6; Item 4 at 7, 9; Item
5 at 2; Item 6 at 3; AE C)
SOR ¶ 1.c:  This account was opened in February 2012, Applicant’s last payment
was made in June 2016, and it was eventually charged off in the amount of $3,092. She
told the investigator that her ex-husband was responsible for this credit-card account. In
her Answer, she claimed that this debt was for a vehicle, she paid the debt, and had title
for the vehicle. She did not provide documentation to support her various assertions, and
based upon the information in the CBRs, this appears to be a credit-card account. (Item
2 at 6, 9; Item 4 at 6; Item 5 at 2; Item 6 at 9; Item 7 at 12, 16)
SOR ¶ 1.d: In February 2017, this account was placed for collection in the amount
of $3,026. In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant asserted that she did not recognize the
alleged debt. She provided no documentation to demonstrate resolution of the debt or to
dispute the debt. (Item 2 at 6, 9; Item 5 at 2; Item 6 at 9)
SOR ¶ 1.e:  In February 2017, this account was placed for collection in the amount
of $2,783. Applicant told the investigator that her military separation pay was garnished
to resolve this debt, and she provided documentation to demonstrate the balance is $0.
(Items 4-7; AE D)
SOR ¶ 1.f:  This credit-card account was opened in July 2011, and it was charged
off in the amount of $2,528 in approximately 2017. Applicant initially told the investigator
that she had a joint account with third ex-husband to whom she was married from 2005
to 2012. In a subsequent interview in January 2019, she indicated that she contacted the
creditor, the account was solely in her third ex-husband’s name, and she intended to file
a dispute. She provided no documentation to demonstrate resolution of the debt. (Item 2
at 7, 9; Item 4 at 6; Item 5 at 2; Item 6 at 10; Item 7 at 10, 14-15)
SOR ¶ 1.g:  This installment account was opened in April 2017. In September 2019,
it was 180 days past due in the amount of $1,998. According to Applicant’s August 2022
CBR, this account was eventually charged off in the amount of $2,978. She provided no
documentation to demonstrate resolution of the debt. (Item 2 at 6, 9; Item 4 at 8; Item 5
at 2; Item 6 at 3)
SOR  ¶  1.h:   This  $580  credit-card  account  was  opened  in  November  2013,  and
charged off in 2016 or 2018. In December 2018, Applicant told the investigator that her
middle son was using this card and not paying it and that she paid the debt in full once
she became aware of the issue. In her Answer, she indicated that she had just paid the
debt. She provided no documentation to demonstrate resolution of the debt. (Item 2 at 7,
9; Item 4 at 6; Item 5 at 2; Item 6 at 10; Item 7 at 10)
SOR ¶ 1.i: This $239 insurance account was placed for collection in approximately
2014. Applicant told the investigator that she had a current account with this company
without a past due balance. In her Answer, she indicated she had no knowledge of this
debt, but would call the creditor and pay it if necessary. She provided no documentation
to demonstrate resolution of the debt. (Item 2 at 7, 10; Item 5 at 2; Item 6 at 10; Item 7 at
11)
SOR ¶ 1.j:  This $6,615 credit card account was opened in 2011, and placed for
collection in 2015. Applicant told the investigator that her second ex-husband opened this
account in her name, and he was required to pay it per their divorce settlement. However,
they were married from 1999 to 2005. In January 2019, she told the investigator that she
intended  to  dispute  this  debt.  In  her  Answer,  she  reiterated  that  her  ex-husband  is
responsible,  and  asserted  that  it  no  longer  appears  on  her  CBR.  She  provided  no
documentation to demonstrate resolution of the debt. (Item 2 at 7, 10; Item 3 at 24; Item
6 at 8; Item 7 at 12, 16)
SOR ¶ 1.k: This $546 cable account was opened in 2017, and placed for collection
in 2018. Applicant told the investigator that she had no knowledge of the account. In her
Answer, she asserted that she has an open account with this company. She provided no
documentation to demonstrate resolution of the debt. (Item 2 at 7, 10; Item 6 at 8; Item 7
at 12)
SOR  ¶  1.l:   This  $3,150  cellular-phone  account  was  opened  and  placed  for
collection  in  2018.  Applicant  told  the  investigator  that  she  had  no  knowledge  of  the
account. In her Answer, she asserted that she has an open account with this company.
She provided no documentation to demonstrate resolution of the debt. (Item 2 at 7, 10;
Item 6 at 8; Item 7 at 11)
SOR ¶ 1.m:  This $122 medical account was placed for collection in approximately
2018.  Applicant’s  middle  son  has  significant  medical  issues,  and  in  2017,  unalleged
medical  bills  totaling  approximately  $70,000  to  $80,000  were  placed  for  collection.
According to her, TRICARE was responsible for all of these medical bills, including this
$122 medical debt. Although she did not provide substantiating documentation, because
there are no other delinquent medical bills on her CBRs the lack of additional medical bills
on her CBRs, lends credence to her argument. (Item 2 at 7, 10; Item 6 at 9; Item 7 at 3,
5-9; AE F; AE G)
SOR ¶ 1.n:  This $229 cable account was placed for collection. Applicant told the
investigator that this debt was paid and should not be on her CBR. She also indicated in
her  Answer  that  she  paid  the  bill  in  full  years  ago.  She  provided  no  documentation  to
demonstrate resolution of the debt. (Item 2 at 7, 10; Item 6 at 11; Item 7 at 10)
SOR ¶ 1.o:  This debt is a duplicate of SOR ¶ 1.a as discussed above. (Item 2 at
7, 10; Item 6 at 10; AE G)
Applicant receives disability pay due to her service in the Army and has a 100%
disability rating. Her total yearly income is over $100,000, but she did not provide a written
budget or information regarding her savings or other assets.  There is no evidence that
she has sought or received financial counseling. (Item 2 at 6)
Applicant’s most recent CBR from August 2022, reflects two new delinquent debts
that were placed for collection totaling $2,304. These debts were unalleged in the SOR
and will not be considered disqualifying, but they may be considered in determining if the
mitigating conditions and whole person are applicable. (Item 4 at 4, 7)
Applicant reported in her SCA that, in 2017, while she was still on active duty in
the Army, she received an Article 15 for misusing her Government credit card. She did
not disclose any debts in her SCA and told the investigator that she was not aware of the
debts alleged in the SOR as she thought she was doing well financially. In her Answer to
the SOR and response to the FORM, she indicated that she did not intentionally falsify
her SCA. (Item 2 at 2-3; Item 3; Item 7 at 3, 10-13; AE A)
Applicant provided a letter of recommendation in her response to the FORM from
a senior colonel who has supervised her since June 2021. He finds her to be “a paragon
of  integrity  and  character,”  who  has  “unequivocally  demonstrated a history of  honesty,
discretion, reliability, sound judgment, strength of character, trustworthiness, and loyalty
to this great Nation.” (AE H)
