Applicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since about January 2020. He served in the National Guard from
1985  until  he  was  honorably  discharged  in  1992.  He  has  been  married  for  about  27
years. He has two adult children. (Items 4, 8)
Applicant  was  interviewed  for  a  background  investigation  while  working  for  a
previous employer in October 2017. A credit report from that period is not in  evidence,
but  Applicant  admitted  that  he  had  several  delinquent  debts,  including  a  charged-off
$5,959 debt to a credit union. He stated that he refinanced his mortgage loan, and used
the proceeds to pay all of the debts in full in February 2017. The debts discussed in the
interview were  not  alleged  in  the SOR  and were  not  listed  with  balances on the  credit
reports in evidence. A credit report from January 2022 lists an account that was settled
for less than the full balance in February 2017. (Items 6, 8) His statement that he paid
debts in February 2017 is accepted.
Applicant was terminated from a job in April 2018 after he failed to report that a
company vehicle had been in an accident. He stated that he was initially the driver, but
he switched with another worker, and he was a passenger when the co-worker had the
accident.  Applicant asserted  that he did  not report the  accident because he felt  it  was
the co-worker’s responsibility to report it. Applicant stated that his wife was only working
part-time,  and  he  was  denied  unemployment  compensation  because  he  was  fired.
During  his  unemployment,  he  could  not  pay  all  of  his  bills  and  several  debts  became
delinquent. (Items 3, 4, 8)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
January 2020. He did not report any unemployment in April or May 2018. He reported
that he was employed from April 2018 until he left for a better opportunity in November
2018.  He  was  employed  from  November  2018  until  he  left  for  a  better  opportunity  in
October 2019. He reported unemployment from October 2019 through December 2019.
He  worked  for  another  employer  from  December  2019  until  he  started  at  his  current
position in July 2020. (Item 4)
The  amended  SOR  alleges  five  delinquent  debts  totaling  about  $23,480.
Applicant owed all of the debts at one time, as established through his admissions and
credit reports. (Items 3-8; AE A)
Applicant retained  a  law  firm  to  assist him  in  managing  his and  his wife’s debts.
He  entered   into   payment  agreements  to   pay   the   $3,666   and   $366   debts  owed   to   the
same  collection  company  for the  same  bank.  The  original amount owed  on  the  $3,066
debt   (SOR   ¶   1.c)   is  unclear,   but   the   March   2021   credit  report   listed   the   balance   as
$4,837.  It  was $3,066  by  the  January  2022  credit report,  and  it  was listed  with  a  $1,472
balance  in October 2022. Applicant stated  that he  is making  $177  payments on  the  15th
of every month. (Items 3-8; AE A) That statement is accepted.
The original amount owed on the $366 debt (SOR ¶ 1.e) is also unclear, but the
March 2021 credit report listed the balance as $1,192. It was $336 by the January 2022
credit  report,  and  it  was  listed  with  a  $128  balance  in  October  2022.  Applicant  stated
that he finished  paying this debt  in August 2022.  (Items 3-8; AE A) I find  that account
has been paid.
Applicant  stated  that  he  paid  the  $105  medical  debt  (SOR  ¶  1.f)  in  November
2022.  He  provided  a  reference  number.  Because  credit  reports  corroborate  his
statements about payments toward other debts, I find this debt is paid. (AE A)
Applicant  stated  that  he  will  address  the  $6,663  credit  union  debt  (SOR  ¶  1.b)
after he finishes paying the smaller debt. (Item 3; AE A)
Applicant’s vehicle was repossessed in 2018 after he lost his job and was unable
to maintain the payments on the auto loan. He stated that he asked the credit union that
financed  the  loan  to  give  him  a  few  months  until  he  found  another  job,  but  the  credit
union  was  unwilling  to  work  with  him  and  repossessed  the  vehicle.  The  credit  union
charged off $13,342 (SOR ¶ 1.g), which was apparently the deficiency balance owed on
the loan after the vehicle was sold. He told a background investigator in April 2022 that
he missed about four payments before the vehicle was repossessed. He does not feel
that  he  should  have  to  pay  for  a  vehicle  that  he  does  not  own.  He  stated  that  he  will
continue to dispute the account. (Items 3, 5-8; AE A)
Applicant helps his daughter who lives in another state and has been unable to
work  because  of  health  reasons.  He  and  his  wife  took  in  his  wife’s  niece  who  was
sexually abused by her father before he kicked her out of the house. Her father is in jail.
Applicant stated that his family would be under tremendous stress if he lost his job. (AE
