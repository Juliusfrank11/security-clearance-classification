Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶  1.a.  He  denied  SOR  ¶¶  2.a-2.g  and  3.a,  all  with
explanations. His admission to SOR ¶ 1.a is incorporated into the findings of fact. After
a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  evidence  submitted,  I  make  the
following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  32  years  old.  He  and  his  wife  married  in  2014.  They  separated  in
June  2016.  They  have  one  child,  a  seven-year-old  boy,  who  lives  with  his  mother  in
another state. Applicant graduated from high school in 2009. In 2010, he enlisted in the
Army, serving on active duty for about six years followed by two years in the Reserve.
He  served  in  the  signal  corps  and  held  a  clearance.  He  was  discharged  honorably  in
2018  as  a  specialist  (E-4).  He  works  as  a  video  technician  for  a  contractor  on  a  U.S.
military base. He has worked there since leaving the Army in 2016. (Tr. 24, 41-45, 83;
GE 1)
Applicant’s  son   was  born   in  December   2015.  Applicant  testified   that  he   had   to
take  his son  to  the  hospital emergency room  several times. The  first ER visit was after
the  boy  was  spitting   up   blood.  The  doctor  diagnosed   him   with   having   GERD
(gastroesophageal reflux disease).  A  second  ER visit  was similar. A  third time  was after
the  baby would not eat. Applicant said an  examination  of the  baby found “brain injuries,”
so  the  police  became  involved,  and  the  child  was  placed  in foster care.  (Tr. 47-48, 87-
88)
In his background interview, Applicant discussed the three incidents: once when
his  son  was  injured  after  falling  off  a  love  seat,  an  occasion  when  both  parents  were
present. A second incident occurred when Applicant discovered his son had vomited in
bed;  and  the  third  incident  occurred  when  his  son  fell  out  of  a  swing  seat,  where
Applicant had placed him while Applicant was taking a shower. After the third incident,
doctors  diagnosed  the  boy  with  broken  ribs,  bleeding  in  the  brain,  and  blood  in  his
retina. The boy remained in the hospital’s custody until he was placed in foster care. (Tr.
86-88; GE 2 at 9)
The Government’s documents reflect that Applicant was indicted by a grand jury
and charged with felony child abuse with the offense date between December 29, 2015,
and May 28, 2016. In August 2016, Applicant was arrested in state 1 and charged with
felony child abuse. (GE 3) The Government’s documents also include a motion filed by
the state prosecutor seeking to exclude from evidence at trial a finding by social workers
of  the  county  department  of  social  services  (DSS)  that,  while  allegations  for  both
parents  were  unfounded,  abuse  of  the  child  was  concluded  to  have  occurred,  “by  an
unknown abuser.” (GE 3 at 20) The DSS report itself is not in evidence here.
In   July   2018,   Applicant   pled   no   contest  to   a   reduced   charge   of  misdemeanor
trespassing.  He  was  sentenced   to   a   maximum   of  12   months  in  jail   and   a   $2,500   fine,
with   imposition   of  the   sentence   suspended   for  two   years  (“two-year   SIS”)  on   the
condition  of general good behavior. He  was  not allowed  unsupervised  contact with  the
victim   for  two   years.  The  case   was  dismissed   on   July  10,   2020,   following   Applicant’s
successful  completion   of  the good  behavior period.   (SOR  ¶  1.a)   (GE   3;   Tr.  48-50,   95-
96, 98)  (The  portion of  SOR ¶  1.a  alleging  that Applicant was  “sentenced  to  two  years
suspended   …”   is  erroneous).  The   record  does  not  contain   a   police   report  or  any
evidence   from  law  enforcement   about  the   circumstances   that  led   to   the   indictment
beyond  what Applicant reported in  his background  interview and testimony.
Applicant maintains that he was not at fault and did not cause his son’s injuries.
He does not believe his wife caused them either,  except perhaps when the son fell off
the love seat. Applicant does not believe his wife did anything intentionally to harm him.
He denied any anger management issues at the time, or financial problems, or getting
physically  violent  with  his  wife  or  child.  He  did  acknowledge  some neglect.  He  denied
any subsequent incidents involving violence or anger management. (Tr. 88-94) He has
not been involved in any subsequent criminal offenses. (Tr. 100)
Applicant  took  anger  management  classes  and  10  weeks  of  parenting  classes,
which  were  mandatory  to  resume  custody.  He  and  the  boy’s  mother  also  saw  a  child
psychologist,  and  Applicant  and  his  son  also  attended  without  her.  (Tr.  93,  96-100)
Applicant explained in his background interview that he once foster care ended, his son
was placed in the care of the boy’s mother. (GE 2 at 11)
The boy lives in another state with his mother. They moved there in July 2020.
Applicant said he last saw his son in November 2022, a few weeks before the hearing,
when he was visiting with Applicant’s parents. Before then, he saw the boy in July 2022
when Applicant flew down to see his son and he took him to an amusement park out of
state,  with  the  mother’s  permission.  He  is  not  subject  to  any  visitation  orders  from  a
court. (Tr. 50-52)
The  financial  security  concerns  in  the  SOR  relate  to  delinquent  child  support,
past-due federal income taxes and other delinquent debts, and unfiled federal and state
income  tax  returns.  He  denied  all  the  Guideline  F  allegations  in  his  answer,  asserting
that his debts either had been, or were being, paid, and that his overdue tax returns had
been  filed.  The  debts  are  established  by  credit  reports  from  November  2018,  August
2019, and February 2022. (GE 6, 7, 8)
Applicant  explained  in  his  interview  that  his  debts  accrued  for  several  reasons,
among them a drop in pay after he left the Army, renting a large apartment, paying child
support costs while their son was in foster care, and child support to the boy’s mother
after she assumed custody. (GE 2 at 11)
SOR ¶ 1.a ($5,577) is a child support arrearage, as of August 2019. (GE 6, GE 7)
Applicant asserted that the account has been paid in full. A February 2022 credit report
shows  no  balance  and  that  the  account  is  in  “pays  as  agreed”  status.”  (GE  5)  The
arrearage  accrued  during  the  period  his  son  was  in  foster  care,  and  Applicant  was
responsible for providing financial support to the state for his son. (Tr. 80) He pays $350
in child support every two weeks, directly to the boy’s mother on a voluntary basis. (Tr.
53, 79) The arrearage is resolved and his child support payments are current.
SOR ¶ 1.b ($2,458) is an account placed for collection by a military retailer. (GE
6, GE 7) Applicant asserted in his answer that the balance is $432 and he is paying $88
every two weeks. A February 2022 credit report shows a balance of $370. (GE 5) The
account is now closed and paid in full. (Tr. 81; AE A at 10)
SOR  ¶¶  1.c  ($1,452)  and  1.d  ($830)  are  cell  phone  accounts  placed  for
collection. (GE 7 at 8) Applicant said they are paid in full. (Answer. Tr. 81-82) He was
unable  to  provide  documentation  but  noted  in  a  post-hearing  e-mail  that  they  are  no
longer listed on his credit report. (AE C)
SOR ¶ 1.e alleges that Applicant failed to file his federal and state 1 income tax
returns  for  TY  2017  and  2018.  He  filed  his  TY  2017  federal  and  state  returns  in  June
2020, when he filed his TY 2019 federal and state returns. (AE J, AE K) He used a well-
known tax preparation software program. In 2018, he could not afford the filing fee, so
he  decided  to mail  the returns, which he  then  neglected  to  do.  (Tr. 57) In  2019,  when
the  software  program  reminded  him  that  his  prior  tax  returns  were  still  unfiled,  he
contacted  his  parents’  tax  accountant  for  assistance.  She  helped  him  prepare  and  file
his late returns, and he has “been up to date ever since.” (Tr. 56-58)
SOR  ¶   1.f   ($4,500)  concerns   past-due   federal   income  taxes  for  TY   2017.
Applicant  said   he   had   a   $9,408   balance   due   for  TY   2017   and   about   $595   due   for  TY
2018   and   was  in   a   150-month   repayment  plan.   (GE   2)   He   said   he   entered   into   the
payment  plan  with  the  IRS  in  September 2020  and  has  been  making  regular payments
since  then. (Tr. 59, 67,  85) As of the  hearing  date, he  owed  $6,523  on  his 2017  federal
taxes and  $632  for TY  2018, for a  total of $7,155  remaining.  (AE  B;  AE  H, AE  I; Tr. 58-
59)
SOR ¶ 1.g ($3,803) concerns past due federal income taxes for TY 2016. (GE 2,
GE 4) As of January 2021, he owed $1,947 in taxes, penalties, and interest. (AE F) As
of December 2022, the debt has been paid. (AE G)
Applicant filed his TY 2020 federal and state tax returns on May 15, 2021 (a date
I  consider  timely  during  the  COVID  pandemic).  He  was  to  receive  a  federal  refund  of
$1,828, and he owed $73 in state taxes. (AE M) He filed his TY 2021 federal and state
tax returns on April 3, 2022. He was to receive a federal refund of $1,889, and he owed
$54 in state taxes. (AE N) He is up to date on his tax filings, and he owes no past-due
state taxes. (Tr. 56, 59-60, 77)
Applicant  participated  in  credit  counseling  in  the  Army  but  not  since  then.  He
keeps a budget to track income and expenses. (Tr. 101-202) A November 2022 credit
report shows no  delinquencies.  (AE  A) A  mid-December 2022  pay  stub  reflects  a year-
to-date   2022   income   of  about  $82,300.  (AE   E)   Applicant’s  current   annual   salary  is
$82,000.  He  also  receives  about  $6,000   from   the   VA   due   to   his  disability   for  a   total
income  of  about $88,000. (Tr. 82)
A January 2022 disability rating decision from the Department of Veterans Affairs
(VA) reflects a 30% disability  rating for degenerative arthritis  (20%) and tinnitus (10%)
(AE D) Applicant earns about $4,800 per month, after taxes, including his disability pay.
He said he has about $800 or $900 left over each month. He drives a 10-year-old car.
(Tr. 83-84)
Applicant disclosed several delinquent debts on his SCA, including past-due child
support. In the comments sections, he noted that he “attempted to enter the information
about delinquent payments” and that he had “additional debtors owed,” but was unable
to obtain complete court and financial records. (GE 1 at 37, 40) He also disclosed that
he  was  arrested  on  suspicion  of  felony  neglect/abuse  and  that  the  charges  were
lowered to misdemeanor trespassing, to be dismissed in July 2020. (GE 1 at 31)
In  SOR  ¶  3.a,  as  amended,  the  Government  alleged  that  Applicant  deliberately
failed  to  disclose, on his August  2018 SCA, that he  owed  past-due  taxes for TY  2016
and TY 2017, in answer to the following question:
Section   26   –   Financial   Record:   Taxes   In   the   past   seven   (7)  years,   have
you  failed  to  file or pay  Federal, state, or other taxes when  required by law
or ordinance.”  (GE 1  at 37)
Applicant filed his 2016 federal tax return on time, on or about April 15, 2017. A
2020  IRS  account  transcript  in  the  record  shows  he  had  past-due  tax  debt  from  that
year (as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g). (GE 4)
As  previously  noted,  Applicant  did  not  file  his  2017  federal  or  state  income  tax
returns  until  June  2020,  and  he  still  owes  past-due  federal  taxes  for  that  year  (as
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f). However, the IRS account transcript for TY 2017 (AE H) shows
that he filed an extension on April 15, 2018. That pushed the filing deadline to October
15,  2018  –  a  date  after  Applicant  prepared  his  SCA  in  August  2018.  Thus,  when  he
prepared  his  SCA,  his  2017  federal  return  was  not  yet  late  (though  it  would  be  later
when he did  not meet the October 2018  deadline).  (AE  H;  Tr. 71-73) It also  stands  to
reason that  it  was not yet established as of August  2018  that he owed  taxes  for 2017
(though he later did).
In answering the original SOR ¶ 3.a, Applicant denied the allegation of deliberate
falsification.  He  said  he  filed  (prepared)  his  2017  tax  return  through  the  software
program  but  had  a  dispute  with  his  son’s  mother  about  claiming  their  son  as  a
dependent. He then did not follow up and complete the filing (until 2020, as discussed).
(Answer)
During his hearing testimony, Applicant explained that he was paying on his past-
due  2016  taxes  when he  prepared  his SCA,  which  he  believed  meant  that  he  was  no
longer “in arrears” and did not have to disclose the debt. He also said he thought he had
filed his 2017 tax return through the software program, but only learned later such was
not  the  case.  He  said he  did not intend  to  mislead  the  government when  he  prepared
his SCA.  (Tr. 61-65, 106-107) Applicant also acknowledged  that he  should have been
more diligent in filling out the SCA. (Tr. 64-65, 109)
