Applicant is 51 years old. He came to the United States from his native country in
April  1991,  after  graduating  from  high  school  and  attending  college  for  one  year.  He
enlisted in the U.S. Navy in October 1995, and served four years on active duty, followed
by four years in the Inactive Reserve. From October 1999 to October 2003, he worked as
an architectural drafter for a laboratory design firm. During that time he also earned a two-
year associate’s degree in Architecture from a community college. He enlisted in the Army
in October 2003, and served honorably until he retired from active duty as a geospatial
engineer staff sergeant (E-6) on November 1, 2019. He and his first wife married in April
1997 and divorced in November 2015.  They have three daughters, one of whom is 36
years old and graduated from college. He continues to pay child support for the other two
daughters. He married his second wife in 2017, and they have a six-year-old daughter.
(GE 1; AE C; AE D; Tr. 37-39, 76-77, 111-112.)
Applicant held security clearances during his time on active duty and is seeking a
security clearance to enable his potential employment as a civilian geospatial analyst. On
April 2, 2019, while he was still on active duty, the DoD CAF issued him a Letter of Intent
to revoke his national security eligibility, including an SOR citing financial concerns under
Guideline F and personal conduct concerns under Guideline E. That SOR alleged that
his September 7, 2016  credit bureau  report included  21  delinquent  debts totaling over
$156,000; and that he failed to disclose them by answering, “No,” to the question on his
August  2016  security  clearance  application  that  asked  whether  he  had  any  financial
delinquencies. Applicant answered that LOI, but then applied to retire from the Army when
he  reached  20  years  of  service  on  November  1,  2019.  He  signed  a  document
acknowledging that he would not retain a security clearance after retiring from active duty.
He currently performs unclassified work, involving some deployments to an overseas U.S.
Army  base.  He  is sponsored  for this  clearance  application  by  a  prospective  employer.
(GE 1; GE 3; GE 7; AE D; AE E; Tr. 4-5, 9, 24-26, 42.)
The 2021 SOR, which is the subject of this adjudication, alleges that Applicant had
20 delinquent debts, totaling $170,650. Two of the debts involved the first and second
mortgages  on  Applicant’s  former  home;  ten  were  student  loan  accounts  placed  for
collection;  and  the  others  were  consumer  credit,  medical,  and  car  loan  delinquencies.
Their  existence  was  documented  in  credit  bureau  reports  from  September  2016,
September 2019, June 2021, and April 2022. (GE 3; GE 4; GE 5; GE 6.)
SOR ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b:  Applicant and his first wife bought a home for $217,000 in
2004 and took out a $70,000 second mortgage in 2006. His September 2019 credit report
showed  that  the  first  mortgage  was  delinquent  in  the  amount  of  $4,181  (2  monthly
payments plus fees) with  a  then-outstanding  balance of  $174,061;  and  that  the lender
had  charged  off  the  second  mortgage  with  a  delinquent  balance  due  of  $52,197.  This
account was charged off in March 2016 after Applicant stopped making payments on that
loan in July 2015. He was one to five months late on payments toward the first mortgage
from October 2018 to April 2020, according to his June 2021 and April 2022 credit reports.
Applicant  sold  the  home  in  September  2020,  and  used  the  proceeds  to  pay  off  these
delinquent loans. (Answer; GE 3; GE 4; GE 5; GE 6; AE I; AE J; Tr. 47-50, 79-83.)
SOR ¶¶  1.c  and  1.l:  Applicant obtained two $12,500 student loans, while on active
duty in December 2008 and April 2009, to pay for computer animation classes he took
from an online art institute. He testified that animation is a hobby he loves, and he wanted
to obtain a degree and explore it as a post-Army career field. These were Federal Direct
Student  Loans,  in  which  the  U.S.  Government  is  the  lender,  not  a  private  financial
institution. He testified that he chose not to repay these loans because he was unsatisfied
with the quality of the instruction he received over the two years he took these classes.
His  September  2019  credit  report  stated  that  both  loans  were  assigned  to  the  U.S.
Department of Education (ED) in a collection status, with a combined $22,514 balance
due,  after  each  became  delinquent  in  April  2013.  His  September  2022  credit  report
showed one combined ED  Direct student loan outstanding balance of $23,069 with no
scheduled payments, apparently under the COVID-related suspended collection policy.
Applicant said that he recently delayed paying these loans while he figured out whether
they had  been  consolidated  with his other  private  student  loans, discussed below.  His
testimony evinced confusion concerning the status of his numerous outstanding student
loans, which he admitted became delinquent due to his extended failure to pay them as
required. (GE 4; GE 6; AE K; Tr. 50-56, 59-61, 64-66, 83-92, 112-114.)
SOR  ¶¶   1.d,  1.f   to1.j,   1.n,  and   1.o:   From  July  2006  to  January  2008,  Applicant
obtained eight Stafford student loans, originally totaling $37,426. These were Federally
guaranteed  loans  issued  by  banks  or  other  financial  institutions.  The  record  evidence
does not establish what educational program each of these loans was used to pay for.
Applicant  commented about  taking  unsatisfying  online  architectural classes  during this
period, but his college-graduate daughter would have been approximately 19 to 22 years
old  during  those  years  as  well.  In  any  event,  he  acknowledged  that  these  loans  were
legitimately  his  obligations.  Applicant’s  September  2019  credit  report  showed  that  all
these loans had been placed for collection after becoming delinquent in April or May 2013,
with a combined balance due of $68,737. On his April 2022 credit report, the combined
balance due to the current loan servicing company had increased to $74,747. It showed
the  loans  to  be  in  a  ‘deferred’  status  until  April  2023,  also  apparently  under  the
Government’s suspended collection policy for student loan debtors. Applicant submitted
some evidence of sporadic payments under agreements to begin repaying these loans,
but nothing showing consistent repayment compliance. (Answer; GE 4; GE 6; AE K; Tr.
55-56, 59-61, 77-78, 83-92, 112-114, 120-121.)
Student   Loan   Consolidation:   Applicant’s   post-hearing   submission   of  evidence
included   a   May   20,  2022   letter   from   the   student  loan   management/collection   agency
agreeing   to   consolidate   all   ten   of   his  delinquent  student   loans  into   one   loan,  with
payments  scheduled   to   begin  60   days  thereafter.  The   letter  directed   him   to   continue
making  required  monthly payments on  his existing  loans until receiving  written  notification
that they had  been successfully consolidated. The  outstanding  balance on the new loan,
after consolidation  of the  ten  loans discussed  above, is to  be  $97,852.61,  and  he  will  owe
360  monthly payments  of $618.50.  The  total interest  charges will  be  $124,807.30, with
total repayments of $222,660  over the  next  30  years.  He also submitted  a  payment  history
from   the   collection   agency  showing   that   he   made   no   payments  toward   these   loans
between  August 1, 2012, and  May 31, 2021. During  2021  he  made  four payments totaling
$2,050;  and  he  made  two additional $550  payments after his hearing, in  May and  June
2022. His loan consolidation  appears to  have been executed  on June 10, 2022. (AE  Y.)
SOR ¶ 1.e:  In July 2019, Applicant had a $269 past-due balance on a car loan he
opened in April 2016 to purchase a 2010 BMW for $18,399. The loan was for five years
with monthly payments of $480, and he had paid it down to $11,273 by July 2019. His
June 2021 credit report shows that from August 2017 to July 2019 he was one- or two-
months delinquent in paying this loan 18 times, and made current payments 6 times. He
testified  that  his  payments  were  late  because  the  seller  did  not  pay  for  some  engine
repairs  he  thought  should  have  been  covered  under  the  contract,  and  he  paid  for  the
repairs  instead  of  paying  the  loan.  In  July  2019  the  loan  was  transferred  to  another
creditor,  and  in  April  2021  Applicant  accepted  a  debt  consolidation  loan  offer  from  a
different finance company. He used some of those funds to pay off the former creditor on
this loan, and his payments to the latest lender are current. (Answer; GE 4; GE 5; AE L;
Tr. 55-56, 92-94.)
SOR ¶¶  1.k  and  1.m:  Applicant obtained two credit cards from a credit union  in
1999  and  2007,  with  limits  of  $8,000  and  $7,000  respectively.  He  stopped  making
payments  on  both  accounts  in  April  2015,  and  they  were  charged  off  and  closed  with
outstanding  balances  of  $7,543  and  $7,138  as  of  August  2019.  His  June  2021  credit
report stated that these accounts were being paid under a partial payment agreement,
with each balance having been reduced by $10, and last payments made in November
2020. Applicant testified that he had recently reached a verbal agreement with the credit
union to settle these accounts for $1,500 and $1,200 payable in May and June 2022, and
provided  a  receipt  documenting  a  $200  cash  advance  on  April  18,  2022,  from  an
unidentified credit card account to make $100 payments toward each of these debts. No
corroborating  evidence  of  this  agreement,  or  of  subsequent  payments,  was  provided.
(Answer; GE 4; GE 5; AE M; Tr. 61-64, 94-97, 109-110.)
SOR  ¶   1.p:   A  collection  agency  reported,  in  August  2019,  that  Applicant  owed
$3,013 in past-due payments on a cell phone account that the agency had acquired in
December 2018. Applicant’s last payment on this debt had been made in February 2016.
Applicant  claimed  in  his  Answer,  without  documentation,  that  he  completed  paying  a
settlement agreement with this creditor on September 30, 2020. He testified that he paid
off the debt in October 2020, for $602. He explained that he originally didn’t pay the cell
phone  company  because  he  thought  that  roaming  charges  from  calls  while  he  was
deployed  to  the  Middle  East  were  excessive.  His  settlement  of  the  alleged  debt  is
supported  by  the  absence  of  this  account  from  his  June  2021  and  April  2022  credit
reports. (Answer; GE 4; GE 5; GE 6; Tr. 66-68, 97-99.)
Applicant opened  another cell  phone  account  with  the  same  company in October
2020.  That  account  also   became   delinquent   and   was   placed   for  collection.  Applicant
explained  that  he  did not make  contractual payments  on  this  new  account because  he
thought that he  should have  been  provided  a  better new phone  than  the  one  he  received
from   the   company  under  the   contract.   He  provided   documentation   from   the   collection
agency stating  that  on  May 25, 2022, per his authorization,  a  $253  payment would be
processed  from  his  credit card  or checking  account  toward  the  $1,192  balance  due  on
this delinquent cell  phone  account  with  the  same  service  provider.  (Answer; AE  Z; Tr. 66-
68, 97-99.)
SOR ¶  1.q:  Applicant opened this automobile loan in March 2018, to purchase a
2009 used car for his second wife. Applicant testified that the car kept breaking down, so
he  decided  to  “return”  it  rather  than  make  the  required  monthly  payments.  The  lender
repossessed the car and charged off the $2,579 balance due in January 2019. Applicant
acknowledged his responsibility to pay this debt. His June 2021 credit report reflected no
payments  since  2018,  but  he  submitted  a  June  6,  2021  account  statement  from  the
creditor stating that a $129 post-dated payment was scheduled to be deposited on June
15,  2021,  toward  the  new  total  due  of  $2,908.  His  April  2022  credit  report  showed  a
reduced balance of $1,579 outstanding, with a last payment made in September 2021.
He testified that he had reached a new settlement agreement in April 2022, under which
he would not be charged additional interest if he paid off the debt within six months, and
he made a $100 payment toward the debt on April 21, 2022. (Answer; GE4; GE 5; GE 6;
AE O; Tr. 68-70, 100-101.)
SOR ¶  1.r:  Applicant opened this $1,779 credit card account in 2002. He testified
that  he  stopped  making  required  payments  after  December  2012  due  to  “financial
oversight,”  and  the  creditor  charged  off  the  account.  On  March  27,  2022,  the  creditor
offered him three different payment options to settle the balance for less than the amount
owed.  On  April  20,  2022,  he  chose  and  executed  the  option  to  make  one  payment  of
$432. This account was recently resolved, after more than nine years of delinquency, by
paying 25% of the amount owed. (Answer; GE 4; AE P; Tr. 70-71, 101-103, 110-111.)
SOR ¶  1.s: Applicant opened this credit card account in July 2008. He testified that
he used it for online purchases from iTunes. He stopped paying the account in June 2016
because  of  what  he  described  as  a  communication  issue  concerning  billing,  and  the
creditor  charged  off  the  $363  balance  due.  He  settled  this  debt  for  less  than  the  full
balance with one $163 payment on October 5, 2020. (GE 4; GE 6; AE Q; Tr. 71-72.)
SOR ¶  1.t: Applicant failed to pay a $297 medical debt in February 2017, and it
was placed for collection with a balance-due of $337 in October 2017. Applicant claimed
that, after initially  disputing this debt,  he  paid  it  off.  He provided a copy of an undated
bank checking account statement that showed a pending $273.44 point of sale debit to a
medical  debt  collection  agency.  Applicant  wrote  on  this  copy  that  he  had  two  medical
collection  accounts  for  $94  and  $248  that  he  settled  for  this  $273.44  amount.  The  bill
attached to this exhibit says that the service dates for these two debts were in January
and March 2021, not in 2017. No evidence corroborates that the $337 collection account
was resolved by this payment, although it does not appear on either his 2021 or 2022
credit reports. (Answer; GE 4; AE R; Tr. 72.)
Applicant testified that he owed more than $5,000 in unpaid Federal income taxes
that apparently became delinquent due to under-withholding from wages he earned while
working in the Middle East during 2019 and 2020. He was laid off and returned to the
United  States  before  qualifying  to  exclude  his  earnings  from  his  taxable  income.  This
unpaid balance remained after an unspecified amount from Applicant’s refund from his
2021  tax  return  was  applied  toward  the  debt.  He  said  that  he  was  making  monthly
payments to the IRS, but that his last such payment had been two or three months before
his hearing. No documentation concerning this tax debt was submitted. (Tr. 104-106.)
Applicant submitted a personal financial statement stating that, to the best of his
knowledge,  his  and  his  spouse’s  gross  monthly  income  was  $13,443;  and  their  net
income after taxes and a $1,000 child support allotment was $10,511. They had car loan
and  credit  card  payments  of  $1,610  and  other  living  expenses  of  $5,586.  This  left  a
monthly remainder of $4,924. He  testified that  he  saved  these  remaining  funds,  which
would  total almost $60,000  per year, “to  pay  off  all  my  education  loans and my taxes,
save it for retirement too.” He then estimated the current balance of his retirement account
to be about $2,500. They had $9,500 in bank savings, investments, and personal assets.
(AE W; Tr. 106-107.)
Applicant also submitted a one-page copy of a page from an Equifax credit report
stating that, “as of June 13, 2022, . . . You currently have no Collections on your credit
file.” That document has no identifying information concerning whose credit file it pertains
to.  However,  since  no  objection  was  made  to  its  authenticity,  although  it  was  merely
identified  by Applicant’s counsel as, “Current  Equifax statement  reflecting  no  collection
accounts,” I presume it to have been a good-faith submission of a page from Applicant’s
credit report. (AE AA.)
Between June 30 and July 3, 2021, Applicant completed 11 online FDIC financial
management  courses.  He  said  that  he  had  failed  to  pay many  of  his  delinquent  debts
because he disputed them.  These disputes were  either justified  by  his disappointment
with the quality of the items he purchased or by what he described as overcharges and
hidden  fees.  He  nevertheless  acknowledged  that  he  actually  incurred  the  debts  in
question. (GE 7; AE U; Tr. 73-76, 103-104, 113-115.)
Applicant  was  promoted  to  staff  sergeant  in  August  2011.  His  NCO  Evaluation
Reports from 2016 through 2018 stated that he “met standard.” His senior rater comments
in those evaluations included: “…has potential, with detailed instruction and supervision
the NCO can accomplish assigned tasks”; “Soldier has reached his maximum potential
for service and will RCP [meaning Retention Control Point, his maximum service time in
rank]  next  year”;  and,  “reached  the  limit  of  his  potential  for  advancement  and  has  an
approved  retirement date.” Applicant was awarded  three Army Commendation Medals,
including  one  in  July  2019,  a  Joint  Service  Achievement  Medal,  and  two  Army
Achievement Medals, in addition to five Army Good Conduct Medals, and other unit and
service awards. (AE E; AE G.)
