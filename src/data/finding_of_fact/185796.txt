Applicant’s history of  drug and alcohol-related and other  offenses
Between July 2004 and March 2018, Applicant was involved in multiple criminal
offenses, for which he was  arrested,  charged,  and  convicted.  (items  1-5)  Specifically,
he  was  arrested,  charged,  and  convicted  of  the  following  offenses:  in  July  2004  for
violation  of  the  Controlled  Substances,  Drug,  Device,  and  Cosmetic  Act;  in  December
2011  operating  under  the  influence  of  alcohol  (DUI);  in  January  2012  for  driving  on  a
suspended license; in March 2012 for violating the conditions of release after drinking in
violation of the court-order issued in relation to his 2011 charge of operating under the
influence  of  alcohol;  in  March  2018  for  driving  and  operating  under  the  influence  of
drugs  or  liquor  (DUI);  and  in  July  2017  for  domestic  violence  assault,  obstructing  the
report of a crime and violation of condition of release.
One  of  the  incidents  covered  by  the  SOR  was  an  alcohol-related  one  that
resulted  in  his  arrest  in  December  2011  for  driving  under  the  influence  (DUI).  Arrest
records confirm that his blood-alcohol content (BAC) registered .22 % prior to his arrest.
(Items 4-5)
Applicant was again arrested and charged with DUI in March 2018. (Item 3) The
reported police account for this incident confirmed that after Applicant had consumed a
number of  mixed  vodka  drinks  during  a  six-hour  stay  in  a  local bar,  he  chose  to  drive
home after turning down an offer from friends to put him up in a local hotel  across the
street. (Item 4) Because Applicant refused to blow into a police-offered breathalyzer, his
BAC percentage for his 2018 incident is not known. (Item 5)
In 2017, Applicant was charged with domestic violence assault of his wife with a
related charge of obstructing  a report of a crime. (Items 4 and 5) These charges were
dismissed, in part because Applicant’s wife declined to testify. (Item (item 2)
Remaining  charges covered  in the SOR  consist  of  his  January 2012  arrest and
charge  of  driving  on  a  suspended  driver’s  license  and  his  March  2012  charge  of
violating the conditions of release after drinking in violation of the court-ordered alcohol-
abstention  conditions  in  relation  to  his  2011  DUI  charge.  (Items  3-4)  Both  of  these
arrests and dispositions reflect a pattern criminal behavior.
