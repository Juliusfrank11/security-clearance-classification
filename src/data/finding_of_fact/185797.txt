Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c; he admitted, in part, and denied, in
part, SOR ¶ 2.a; and he denied SOR ¶¶ 2.b and 2.c. As he neither admitted nor denied
SOR ¶ 2.d, I construe his silence as a denial. He is 47 years old. He married in 2003,
separated in 2015, and divorced in 2017. He has three children; one is an adult and two
are  minors.  According to  his  December  2019  security  clearance  application  (SCA),  he
has owned his home  in state A since May 2003. (Answer; Tr. at 55, 65-66, 70, 75-76,
218, 229; GE 1, 4; AE H)
Applicant  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  electrical  engineering  in  1999,  and  a
master’s degree in public administration in 2006. He served honorably in the U.S. military
from  May  1997  to  May  2006,  when  he  medically  retired.  He  briefly  worked  for a  DOD
contractor  from  May  2006  to  October  2006.  He  worked  for  another  U.S.  government
agency  (AGA  2)  as  a  deputy  director  and  program  manager  from  October  2006  to
February 2009, and as a director and program manager from February 2009 to February
2014.  From  October  2008  to  November  2013,  he  was  also  a  self-employed  chief
executive officer for a holistic health care facility that he co-owned with his then-spouse,
who served as its chief physician officer. He worked as a chief information officer (CIO)
for  AGA  1  from  February  2014  to  March  2019,  when  AGA  1  removed  him  from
employment because he did not hold a requisite security clearance. He was unemployed
from March 2019 to December 2019. Since then, he worked as an executive advisor for
his employer, a DOD contractor. He was first granted a security clearance in 1997. (Tr.
at 6-7, 52-62, 66-69, 228, 232-234; GE 1, 4; AE I, J)
The  SOR  alleged,  under  Guidelines  F  and  E,  that  Applicant  filed  Chapter  7
bankruptcy in September 2019, and his bankruptcy was discharged in December 2019.
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 2.d) It also alleged that he failed to file, as required, his federal income tax
returns for at least tax years (TY) 2012 through 2014. (SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 2.d) It also alleged
that he failed to file, as required, his state income tax returns for at least TY 2012 and
2013.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.c,  2.d)  These  SOR  allegations  are  established  by  Applicant’s
admissions in his Answer; his SCA; his background interviews from 2015 and 2020; his
response to interrogatories;  tax account transcripts;  bankruptcy records; court records;
and a 2021 credit bureau report. (Answer; GE 1-6)
The SOR also alleged, under Guideline E, that  Applicant provided at least three
contractors  with  his  username  and  password  to  an  invoice  processing  platform  (IPP),
between approximately February 2014 and March 2017, in violation of security protocols
while he was employed by AGA 1. (SOR ¶ 2.a) It also alleged that he improperly used
the  services  of  a  contractor  when  he  tasked  her  with  his  personal  responsibilities,  to
include work related to an au pair handbook, in approximately August 2015. (SOR ¶ 2.b)
It also alleged that he falsified material facts during an interview with an authorized DOD
investigator, when he stated that the AGA 1 contracting officer (CO) gave him permission
to share his IPP credentials with his executive assistant, as alleged in SOR ¶ 2.a. (SOR
¶ 2.c)
Applicant  disclosed  information  about  his  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  and  failure  to
timely  file  his  relevant  federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  on  his  SCA,  during  his
background  interviews,  and  in  his  response  to  interrogatories.  He  attributed  them  to
marital stress, his failed business with his ex-spouse, her financial mismanagement, his
separation and divorce, and his period of unemployment. Two substantial judgments of
$117,707 for his business’s unpaid rent and $231,940 for a business loan, were entered
against Applicant and his ex-spouse’s business, in 2013 and 2015, respectively. His ex-
spouse  handled  the  judgment-related  matters  and  told  him  that  the  judgments  were
entered solely against their business. He was unaware that he  and his ex-spouse had
personally  guaranteed  some  of  the  contracts  that  resulted  in  the  judgments,  and  that
consequently the judgments were also entered against them individually. Simultaneously,
he and his ex-spouse were negotiating the terms of their divorce settlement, to include
debt allocation. (Tr. at 56-77, 159-162, 170-176, 218-230, 234-240, 246-247; GE 1-6)
Applicant learned  of his personal  liability  for the  judgments  in 2017, when  he  was
so  counseled  by his  attorney,  and  he reached  out to  the  creditor  for  the  larger  judgment
to   try  to   resolve   it.  His  wages   at   AGA   1   were   garnished   for  a   period   to   satisfy  the
judgments, but once  he  was separated  from  AGA, he  no  longer had  the  assets to  continue
his  resolution   efforts.   He  then   elected   to   resolve  the   judgments  through   Chapter  7
bankruptcy.  Records of  Applicant’s Chapter 7  bankruptcy reflect that he  claimed  liabilities
totaling $818,412, which consisted primarily  of business debts. He  disclosed on his SCA
that  he  agreed  to  pay  the  bankruptcy  trustee  $18,000  over 12  months, at  $1,500  monthly,
so  that he  could  keep  his home. (Tr. at  56-77, 159-162, 170-176, 218-230, 234-240, 246-
247; GE  1-6)
During  his period  of  personal and  professional  turmoil,  Applicant  was  unable  to
locate documents and obtain necessary information from his ex-spouse to timely file his
relevant  federal  and  state  income  tax  returns.  His  ex-spouse  was  an  independent
contractor  during  their  marriage,  and  he  discovered  that  she  had  not  been  paying  her
taxes. In addition, she wrote checks for their business without documenting them in the
logs. He needed to ascertain the business expenses by locating copies of the checks and
obtaining bank statements before he could file his relevant income tax returns. In 2013,
he  hired  an  accountant  to  file  his  federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  for  TY  2010  to
2013.  He  indicated  during  his  January  2020  background  interview  that  he  paid  his
outstanding federal and state taxes in 2018. He testified that his accountant electronically
filed his federal and state income tax returns concurrently for TY 2012 to 2014, and that
he did not owe any taxes for those tax years as of the date of the hearing. (Tr. at 56-77,
159-162, 170-176, 218-230, 234-240, 246-247; GE 1-6)
October  2022  IRS  tax  account  transcripts  reflect  that  Applicant  filed  his  federal
income tax returns for TY 2012 and 2014 in June 2020 and July 2020, respectively, and
he did not owe federal taxes for those tax years. An April 2022 letter from the IRS reflects
that  the  IRS  accepted  Applicant’s  August  2020  claim  of  identity  theft  pertaining  to  TY
2013. The IRS noted that it received tax returns with Applicant’s taxpayer ID number (TIN)
for  TY  2013;  identity  theft  occurred  under  Applicant’s  TIN;  and  the  IRS  removed  the
incorrect tax return information from Applicant’s TIN. It instructed him that he did not need
to take any further action. (Tr. at 68-77, 218-225, 234-238; GE 4; AE L)
As of the date of the hearing, Applicant’s monthly income was $8,000, of which he
received $4,000 from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for a 100% disability
rating. His monthly net remainder was $6,000. His 2021 credit report reflects that he had
no  delinquent  debts,  and  he  was  current  on  his  mortgage.  He  completed  a  personal
financial management course and he received credit counseling through his Chapter 7
bankruptcy, in 2019. He testified that he has since timely filed his federal and state income
tax returns and he intends to continue to do so. IRS tax account transcripts from August
2020  reflect  that  he  filed  his federal  income  tax  returns  for  TY  2015,  2016,  2018,  and
2019, and he did not owe federal taxes for those tax years. He provided documentation
reflecting that a $2,629 tax lien, entered against him in May 2014 by state B for TY 2010,
was released in July 2017. He testified that he owed approximately $4,000 in state taxes
to state A for TY 2021, and he intended to pay it. He testified that he learned a lot from
his experience with attempting to run a business, and “I know for a fact that nothing will
ever happen to my credit again.” (Tr. at 76-77, 161, 176, 228-229, 233; GE 2, 4-5; AE K)
When Applicant worked as a CIO for AGA 1, he was also tasked with serving as a
contracting  officer  representative  (COR)--a  certification  he  received  years  before  he
worked for AGA 1. He testified that he was the only CIO within AGA 1  that also was a
designated  COR,  and  that  his  deputy  was  the  only  other  individual  who  was  COR-
certified. Due to staffing shortages, AGA 1 necessitated that an executive such as himself,
not normally tasked with junior-level-COR responsibilities, perform the COR function. In
his capacity as a COR, he acted as the liaison between the CO and approximately 200
contractors.  He  was  responsible  for  accessing  the  IPP  to  verify  that  the  contractors
worked  the  hours  claimed  on  their  invoices,  then  approving  their  invoices  in  a  timely
manner so that they were paid. (Tr. at 85-87, 89-110, 162-164, 168, 176-196, 205-217,
224, 240-246; GE 1, 4, 7-14; AE A)
On  various  occasions  between  approximately 2014  and  2017, Applicant gave  his
IPP  username  and  password  to  two  to  three  of his executive  assistants, who  were  also
contractors,  so  they could access the  IPP  to  assist him.  His repeated  requests for more
COR-certified  personnel were  unanswered.  Unable to  timely  review and  approve  all  the
contractors’   submitted   invoices   while   also   performing   his  CIO   duties,   he   sought   and
received  authorization  from  an  individual whom  he  mistakenly believed  at the  time  to  be
the   CO,  to   delegate   his  authority   and   allow his  executive   assistants  to   assist   him   with
reviewing  the  data. He  did not recall  this individual informing  him  that he  could delegate
his authority to  a  back-up  COR. He acknowledged  that  he  did not explicitly inform   this
individual that he  would  be  giving  his executive  assistants  access  to  the  IPP  using  his IPP
credentials. He  testified  that  his executive  assistants reviewed  the  contractors’  submitted
time  and  work, but only he  approved  the  contractors’  invoices.  (Tr. at 85-87,  89-110,  162-
164, 168, 176-196, 205-217, 224, 240-246;  GE 1, 4, 7-14; AE  A)
Applicant  denied  telling  a  DOD background  investigator,  in February 2020,  that the
CO told him  he  could give his executive  assistants his IPP  credentials. He testified  that
when  he  adopted the  February 2020  ROI  in his response  to  interrogatories, he  overlooked
the portion of the ROI in which  he discussed this issue and  that he  should have provided
clarification. He  testified  that the  individual,  whom  he  believed  to  be  the  CO, never told
him  he  could give out his  IPP  credentials. He acknowledged  that he  did  and  that doing  so
was in violation  of security protocols. In  2016,  a  CO from  another U.S.  government agency
(AGA   3)  learned   of  Applicant’s  executive   assistants  accessing   the   IPP   using   his  IPP
credentials. That  CO  informed  him  that  such  a  practice  was  impermissible and  should  be
immediately  stopped,  and   he   did  so.   Applicant  learned,  in   2017,   that  the   individual  he
believed  was a  CO from  whom  he  sought  authorization  was also a  contractor. He testified
that he  learned  from  this experience  and  intends to  abide  by all  security protocols in the
future.  (Tr. at  85-87, 89-110, 162-164, 168, 176-196, 205-217, 224, 240-246; GE  1, 4, 7-
14; AE A)
In   approximately  2015,  Applicant’s  executive   assistant   compiled   an   au   pair
handbook  for him. He maintained  that he  did not task  her with  doing  so. He testified  that
she  worked  on  it voluntarily  after  learning  through  his  work and  personal  to-do  lists,  that
it was a  priority for  him  to  find  an  au  pair  because  he  was separated  from  his then-spouse
and  needed  childcare. He acknowledged  that  once  she  compiled  the  handbook,  he  sent
her an  email  asking  her to  make  certain changes to  it. He  testified  that he  should  have
instructed  her not to  perform  any tasks on  his personal to-do  list.  He testified  that he  also
learned  from  this experience  and  will  ensure that no  one  at work performs any personal
tasks for him  in the  future.  (Tr. at  150-158,  162-164, 166, 168, 196-205,  238-239,  243-
244; GE  1, 4, 7-14)
Applicant  disclosed  the  information  about  sharing  his  IPP  credentials  with  his
support staff and about using a contractor to perform personal tasks on his SCA, during
his  background  interviews,  and  in  his  response  to  interrogatories.  He  maintained  that
these were among a host of unsubstantiated allegations brought against him by AGA 1
in retaliation for him being a whistleblower. (Tr. at 77-150, 162-170, 230-232; GE 1, 4, 8;
AE A-G, I, J)
