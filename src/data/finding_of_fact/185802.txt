Applicant  is 36  years old.  He married  his first wife  in 2006 and was  divorced  in
2009. He has been married to his second wife since August 2011. He has a 17-year-old
son. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2015 and a master’s degree in 2017. He enlisted
in the U.S. Air Force and served on active duty from September 2006 until his medical
separation  in  October  2011,  under  honorable  conditions.  He  has  worked  for  federal
contractors since 2012, and he was granted a top secret security clearance that same
year. Since April 2017, he has been employed as a database administrator for a federal
contractor. (Items 3 and 4)
Applicant received  the  SOR  in February 2022. The  first ten  allegations,  SOR   ¶¶
1.a. through  1.j, allege  delinquent debts totaling  $53,247. Applicant disclosed  during  his
March 2019  background  interview that  beginning  in  2017, his wife  had  a  medical  issue
that  caused  numerous  unexpected  medical bills.  In  addition, his wife  was laid  off  by her
employer, which  also contributed  to  their  financial problems. In  June  2018, his wife  found
full-time  employment, which  significantly helped  in their  efforts to  pay off their  debts.  They
have  made  a  conscious effort to  reduce  their  spending, focus  on  paying  bills, and  reducing
their  entertainment expenses, such  as  going  out to  the  casino  for date  night.  Applicant
also admitted  in  his Answer that he  did not  handle the  family finances well during  the  time
their bills became delinquent.  (Items 2  and  4)
On  March  22,  2022,  Applicant  filed  for  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  protection.  His
Chapter 13 plan, which was confirmed by the court on June 14, 2022, requires him to
make 60 monthly payments of about $1,900. His payment plan to the trustee will continue
until  mid-2027,  and  at  that  time  any  remaining  unsecured  nonpriority  debts  can  be
discharged. (Item 6)
SOR ¶ 1.b. alleges that Applicant issued a check in the amount of $200, that was
returned for insufficient funds, and referred for collection.
SOR ¶  1.n.  alleges  that between  2016  and  2018,  Applicant  repeatedly engaged  in
check kiting  by presenting  over $100,000  in checks without sufficient funds. The  financial
scheme  also included  him  making  ATM  withdrawals and  cash  deposits.  Applicant,  using
two  different  bank  accounts, took  advantage  of  the  fact  that a financial institution  takes
days to  process a check. Check kiting, by  definition, is the  illegal practice involving  the
fraudulent  use  of  a  financial instrument to  obtain additional credit  that is  not authorized,
or for which  there are insufficient funds.  He stopped  in 2018, after the  bank admonished
him  for his involvement in deceptive  financial practices.  Both  of the  SOR allegations  (¶¶
1.b  and 1.n.)  were cross-alleged  under Guideline E. (SOR ¶  2.a.)
Applicant did not provide many details or documentation about the current status
of  his  delinquent  debts.  Department  Counsel  reported,  however,  that  many  of  these
details  can  be  gleaned  from  his  bankruptcy  paperwork  in  the  record.  According  to
Applicant’s April 18, 2022 Bankruptcy Schedule D, the amount he owed on his delinquent
mortgage, $174,701, is the same amount he owed in September 2020. (SOR ¶ 1.g) He
did reduce three of the debts, such as SOR ¶ 1.d ($8,830 which was reduced to $8,030);
SOR ¶ 1.e ($11,272 which was reduced to $9,172), and SOR ¶ 1.f (originally $1,651 now
$51).  The  Bankruptcy  Schedule  E/F  indicates  that  the  outstanding  amounts  alleged  in
SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.j, remain unchanged. (Items 1 and 6)
Applicant admitted in his Answer that he had not filed his state or Federal income
tax returns for 2018. (SOR ¶¶ 1.k and 1.l.) He also admitted he had unpaid Federal taxes
(amount not alleged) for tax year 2019, and he listed that he had arranged a payment
plan  with  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS).  He  did  not  provide  supporting
documentation of the IRS payment agreement, or any recorded payments. (SOR ¶ 1.m)
According to the Bankruptcy Schedule E/F, he declared that he owed a combined total
amount of $6,962 in delinquent Federal income taxes for 2019 and 2020 together. (Items
2 and 6)
Applicant admitted to gambling and he acknowledged that he made approximately
$20,000 of cash withdrawals at one or more casinos, between 2016 to 2018, the period
he was involved in check kiting. He estimated that he visited a casino once or twice per
month from 2015 through 2018, spending as much as $100 to $200 per visit. In 2019 and
2020, he increased his visits to casino(s) every weekend, spending approximately $200
per visit. He also stated in his December 2020 response to interrogatories that he had
reported gambling losses on two other income tax returns, but he was unable to find the
tax records. The bankruptcy records indicate that his gambling losses totaled $23,056 in
2021. (Items 4, 5 and 6)
