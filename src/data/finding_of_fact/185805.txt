Applicant,  31,  has  worked  for  a  federal  contracting  company  as  a  program
analyst since June 2016. He completed his first security clearance application in 2014,
and  was  initially  granted  a  security  clearance  in  2015.  He  completed  his  most  recent
security  clearance  application  in  September  2019.  The  investigation  revealed  that
Applicant owed $45,560 for 12 delinquent student loans. (GE 1- 3)
Applicant attended college from August 2009 to May 2014. Since graduating, he
has  not  experienced  any  period  of  unemployment.  He  is  unmarried  and  has  no
dependents. He lives rent-free in his parents’ home, but contributes between $200 and
$500  each  month  toward  household  expenses.  He  uses  his  salary,  which  is  now
approximately  $57,000  annually,  toward  traveling  and  other  personal  expenses.
Applicant testified that he did not pay his student loans because they slipped his mind.
He made a few payments after the servicer contacted him in 2015 and 2016. He did not
make any payments after mid-2016 and defaulted on the loans in April 2019. (GE 1-3;
Tr. 8-25, 31-34)
After  receiving  the  SOR  in  January  2021,  Applicant  contacted  the  collection
agency to rehabilitate the loans. He completed the rehabilitation program  in November
2021. The loans have not been consolidated. They remain 12 separate accounts, each
with  their  own  repayment  terms.  Because  of  the  student  loan  payment  pause  initiated
by President Biden in March 2020, Applicant is not currently required to make payments
on the accounts. However, the servicer informed him that the pause did not prohibit him
from making payments. Applicant has chosen not to do so, and plans to pay the loans

After paying his recurring expenses each month, which includes his car payment,
cell  phone,  and  a  medical  subscription  payment,  Applicant  has  between  $1,200  and
$1,300 in disposable income. He has less than $10,000 in other assets. The repayment
terms of the 12 loans are unclear from the record, but he testified that he would be able
to afford the payments. (Tr. 23, 26-30, 35-36)
When Applicant completed the security clearance application in September 2019,
he disclosed one derogatory account in response to Section 26 – Financial Record. He
disclosed  a  2013  eviction  for  non-payment  of  rent  and  the  settlement  of  that  $11,000
account in 2014. He explained the origin of the debt and provided a detailed explanation
of  its  resolution.  He  did  not  disclose  his  delinquent  student  loan  accounts.  In  his
February 2020 subject interview, the background investigator asked Applicant if he had
been over 120 days delinquent on any debt; to which Applicant answered ‘no’. After the
investigator  confronted  him  with  evidence  of  the  student  loan  accounts,  Applicant
acknowledged  that he owed  the accounts, explaining that he had not paid  the student
loans because they slipped his mind and that he had other bills to pay. At the hearing,
he  could  not  provide  a  reason  for  failing  to  disclose  his  delinquent  student  loan
accounts. (GE 1-2; Tr. 31, 38-40)
The  record  contains  a  January  2020  credit  report.  Applicant’s  credit  history
begins in September 2009, when he opened his first student loan accounts. Aside from
the 12 student loan accounts, Applicant only has four other consumer credit accounts,
which he opened between 2016 and 2017. Those four accounts are in good standing.
The only reported derogatory accounts are the defaulted student loans. (GE 3)
