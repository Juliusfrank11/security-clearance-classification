Applicant is a 54-year-old employee of a government contractor. He has worked
in  the  same  position  for  several  different  government  contractors  since  about  August
2015. He was awarded a bachelor’s degree in 1990. He has been married since 1997.
He has five children, four of whom are minors. He served on active duty in the U.S. Air
Force from 1986 until December 2014. (Tr. 21-22; GE 1)
In  the  SOR,  the  Government  alleged  Applicant’s  six  delinquent  consumer  and
medical  debts  totaling  approximately  $38,000  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.f).  These  delinquencies
consist of a medical account, credit-card accounts, auto loans, and a personal loan. The
Government also alleged that Applicant did not timely file his federal and state income
tax returns for the 2015 through 2018 tax years, despite being required to do so (SOR
¶¶ 1.g and 1.h). Finally, it alleged that he owed delinquent federal income taxes in the
approximate amount of $13,450 for the 2015 through 2018 tax years (SOR ¶ 1.i). In his
Answer  and  Answer  to  Amendment,  he  admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations  with
additional comment. I have adopted his admissions  as findings of fact.  (SOR; Answer;
Answer to Amendment)
The  delinquent  medical  account  for  $244  listed  in  SOR  ¶  1.a  has  not  been
resolved.  This  account  became  delinquent  in  approximately  May  2017.  Applicant
claimed  that  he  contacted  the  creditor  about  this  debt  and  paid  it  over  the  phone
approximately a year ago. He contacted the creditor after the SOR was issued. He did
not  provide  corroborating  documentation  regarding  this  payment.  (Tr.  32-38,  41,  77;
Answer; GE 1-4)
The delinquent online credit card for $490 listed in SOR ¶ 1.b has been resolved.
Applicant  opened  this  account  in  August  2019,  but  fell  behind  on  payments  in  2020
because  he  had other expenses to  cover.  In approximately March  2021,  he  contacted
the  creditor  and  paid  approximately  $456  to  settle  the  account  for  less  than  the  full
balance. (Tr. 41-42; Answer; GE 2-4)
The auto loan delinquent for $746 with a total balance of approximately $12,861
listed in SOR ¶ 1.c has been resolved. Applicant opened this account in about August
2015 for the purchase of a used vehicle. He became delinquent on the account in about
November 2020 because he did not have enough income to make the payments on it.
In approximately November 2021, his wife contacted the creditor and paid about $6,000
to settle the account for less than the full balance. (Tr. 41-45, 72-74; Answer; GE 2-4)
The delinquent auto loan for $29,101 listed in SOR ¶ 1.d has not been resolved.
Applicant opened this account in about August 2016 for the purchase of a used vehicle.
He  fell  behind  on  payments  on  this  account  in  about  September  or  October  2020
because he did not have enough income to pay all of  his financial  obligations and the
account  was  charged  off.  In  approximately  November  2021,  either  he  or  his  wife
contacted  the  creditor about  this debt  and  the  debt  listed  in  SOR  ¶ 1.c.  Applicant  and
his wife claimed that the creditor told them that they could make payments on this debt,
but they were not required to because the debt had been written off. He has not made a
payment  on  this  debt  after  the  account  was  charged  off.  He  acknowledged  that  he
probably should make payments on it. (Tr. 45-49, 73-75; Answer; GE 1-4)
The credit-card account delinquent for $105 with a total balance of approximately
$3,719 listed in SOR ¶ 1.e has been resolved. Applicant opened this account in about
2008. He has had periods of time when he has been delinquent on the account because
of a lack of sufficient funds to pay all of his financial obligations, but manages to catch
back up. The account has been current since about November 2021. The status of this
account is corroborated by credit reports (Tr. 49-50; Answer; GE 2-4)
The  delinquent  personal  loan  for  $4,880  listed  in  SOR  ¶  1.f  has  not  been
resolved.  Applicant  opened  this  account  in  about  August  2015  to  pay  for  daily  living
expenses. The creditor charged off the account in about 2016 when Applicant stopped
making  payments  on  it.  Applicant  claimed  that  he  contacted  the  creditor  about  this
account in 2018, although he also testified that he did not contact any of the creditors in
the SOR until after the SOR was issued in December 2020. Applicant claimed that the
creditor acknowledged  that  the  account  was  “off  their  books,” so  he  did  not make any
payment arrangements or payments on this account. (Tr. 41, 50-53; Answer; GE 1-2)
Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for the 2015
through 2018 tax years, despite being required to do so. He filed all of these late income
tax  returns  in  August  2022.  He  filed  his  federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  for  the
2019 through 2021 tax years in August 2022. He provided no evidence that he had an
extension from the IRS or his state tax authority to file any of these income tax returns
beyond  the  deadline.  Any  adverse  information  not  alleged  in  the  SOR,  such  as
Applicant’s late  filing  of income  tax returns for tax years other than  2015  through  2018
cannot be used for disqualification purposes. It may be considered when assessing the
application of mitigating conditions and for the whole-person analysis. (Tr. 17-18, 23-28,
41, 78-79; Answer; GE 1)
Applicant  claimed  that  he  failed  to  timely  file  his  federal  and  state  income  tax
returns  in  2015  because  he  completed  the  forms  and  realized  that  he  owed  about
$10,000  in  federal  taxes.  He  knew  he  could  not  afford  to  pay  that  amount,  so  he
procrastinated. He wanted to wait to formulate a plan and to save money, so he did not
file.  He  claimed  that  prior  to  2015,  he  had  always  received  an  income  tax  refund,  but
believed that his retirement from the military must have changed his tax status. A similar
thought process resulted in his not timely filing his federal and state income tax returns
for  the  2016  through  2021  tax  years.  He  was  worried  about  not  being  able  to  pay  his
federal taxes, so he procrastinated and avoided filing so as not to draw the attention of
the IRS. (Tr. 17-18, 23-29, 41, 78-79; Answer; GE 1)
Applicant  owed  about  $13,450  in  delinquent  federal  taxes  for  the  2015  through
2018  tax  years.  He  believed  that  after  the  IRS  finished  calculating  his  balance  after
receiving  his  2015  through  2021  income  tax  returns,  he  would  ultimately  owe  about
$10,000.  He  provided  no  documentary  evidence  to  corroborate  that  he  will  owe  this
lesser amount. There is no evidence in the record that he owed any state income taxes.
He claimed that he included a form with his late federal income tax filings requesting the
IRS  enter into  a  payment plan  with  him. He did not provide  a  copy  of  this form. He did
not  request  a   specific   amount  to   pay   to   the   IRS,  but   believed   that  he   can   pay   about
$1,200  per month. His plan  is to  wait for the  IRS  to  get back to  him  about his payment
arrangement request and  then  make  the  required  payments.  (Tr. 17-18, 23-29, 58, 78-
80; Answer; Answer to Amendment;  GE  1)
Applicant  claimed  his  financial  problems  with  respect  to  his  consumer  and
medical  debts  were  attributable  to  several  causes.  In  2016,  he  and  his  family  had  to
move  on  short  notice  because  their  landlord  was  not  paying  the  mortgage  on  their
residence and the property was foreclosed upon. This foreclosure resulted in Applicant
moving twice in about a year. The difficulty and expense of his moves were exacerbated
by his need to accommodate a large family and a number of farm animals. His resultant
rent of $2,300 per month for his current residence was relatively high for the area.  He
has  operated  a  working  dairy  farm  that  loses  a  significant  amount  of  money.  His  wife
was  a  stay-at-home  mother  until  2020  and  then  was  in  and  out  of  work  until  October
2022.  Finally,  he  blames  inflation  for  his  rising  costs.  Given  his  inability  to  pay  his
financial  obligations,  he  has  not  presented  sufficient  evidence  to  show  that  he  has
enough income to cover his expenses. (Tr. 14, 29-31, 65-66, 71, 75-76)
Applicant  has  earned  about  $140,000  annually  in  salary  since  about  2015.  He
has  also  received  about  $4,300  per  month  in  military  retirement.  Applicant’s  wife  has
contributed to the family income when  she has  been employed.  She  worked for about
six  months  in  2020,  and  then  was  unemployed  until  about  August  2021.  She  was
employed again beginning in August 2021 for about six months. From then until October
2022, she was either unemployed or worked part time for a friend. As of October 2022,
she  started  a  new  job  and  has  earned  about  $1,000  to  $1,200  every  other  week.
Applicant  claimed  that now that  his wife  has income,  he  is able  to save  some money.
He claimed that he is also cutting back on the expenses of his farm, but did not explain
how he is doing so. (Tr. 15, 21-22, 65-66)
Applicant’s  regular  monthly  expenses  are  the  aforementioned  $2,300  in  rent,
$300 to $500 per month for electricity, about $1,000 a few times per year for propane,
$2,500 per month for animal feed, $100 per month for veterinary bills, and about $400
per  month  for  cell  phones.  He  also  spends  about  $1,200  to  $1,400  per  month  on
groceries. He has about $400 in his checking account and no money in savings. He has
about  $10,000  to  $11,000  in  a  retirement  account.  His  wife  has  been  handling  the
budget, but they do not have a set, written budget. He claimed that they are working on
establishing  one.  Applicant  attended  credit  counseling  consisting  of  two  to  three  in-
person meetings  totaling two  to  two  and  one-half  hours total in  2016 or 2017.  (Tr. 31,
53-58, 60-62, 65-68, 76)
