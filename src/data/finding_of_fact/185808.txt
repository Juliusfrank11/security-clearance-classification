Applicant  admitted  SOR ¶¶  1.a-1.l,  1.n, and  1.s-1.w,  and  he  denied  SOR  ¶¶  1.m,
1.o-1.r,  1.x-1.z,  and  2.a.-2.c.  He is  33  years old. As of the  date  of  the  hearing, he  was
engaged   to   be   married.  He  has  two   minor  children.  He  graduated   from   high   school  in
2009. He has  attended  college  since  2019, but  he  has  not yet earned  a  degree.  He served
honorably  in  the   U.S.   Army  Reserve   from   January  2010   to   July  2018.  He   deployed
overseas in  2013. As of his April 2020  security clearance  application  (SCA), he  worked
as a  fuel  distribution  operator  and  controller  for his  employer, a  DOD contractor, since
June  2014.  He was granted  a  security clearance  in 2014. (Answer; Tr. at  7-10, 26-29,  33-
36, 82-83, 85, 95, 107-109; GE  1)
The SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file, as required, his federal income tax
returns for tax years (TY) 2013, 2015, 2017, and 2018, and that his federal income tax
returns for TY 2013 and 2015 remained unfiled as of the date of the SOR. (SOR ¶ 1.a) It
also alleged that he failed to file, as required, his state income tax returns for TY 2013,
2015, 2017, 2018, and 2019, and that his state income tax returns for TY 2013 and 2015
remained  unfiled  as  of  the  date  of  the  SOR.  (SOR  ¶  1.b)  It  also  alleged  that  he  was
indebted  to  the  federal  government  for  delinquent  taxes  in  the  amounts  of  $7,418,
$10,340, $1,560, and $1,144 for TY 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. (SOR ¶¶
1.c-1.f) It also alleged that he was indebted to the state tax authority for delinquent taxes
in  the  amounts  of  $6,949,  $612,  $621,  and  $263  for  TY  2015,  2016,  2017,  and  2019,
respectively,  and  that  a  $5,538  state  tax  lien  was  entered  against  him  in  2017  and
remained unpaid as of the date of the SOR. (SOR ¶¶ 1.g-1.k)
The SOR also alleged that Applicant’s employer garnished his wages from around
2016  to  2020  for  $1,701,  to  satisfy  a  judgment  entered  against  him  by  a  consumer
creditor. (SOR ¶ 1.l) It also alleged that his employer was garnishing his wages for $8,531
since  2020  to  satisfy  a  judgment  entered  against  him,  and  that  the  garnishment  order
remained in effect as of the date of the SOR. (SOR ¶ 1.m) It also alleged that he had 8
delinquent consumer debts totaling $30,020. (SOR ¶¶ 1.n-1.r, 1.v-1.x) It also alleged that
he had three delinquent debts with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), totaling
$4,158. (SOR ¶¶ 1.s-1.u) It also alleged that he had two delinquent medical debts totaling
$357. The SOR allegations under Guideline F are established by Applicant’s admissions
in his Answer, his 2020 SCA, his June 2020 interview with a background investigator, his
July 2021 response to interrogatories, documentation from the state tax authority, four
credit bureau reports from 2020 to 2022, and court records. (Answer; GE 1-12)
The SOR also alleged that Applicant falsified his responses to section 26 of his
SCA, when he marked  “No” and  failed  to  disclose: (1) his failure to file his federal and
state income tax returns and his failure to pay his federal and state income taxes, as set
forth in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.k; (2) SOR ¶¶ 1.c-1.f and 1.k-1.m, in response to questions that
inquired  whether  he  had  any  delinquency  involving  enforcement;  and  (3)  SOR  ¶¶  1.l
through  1.z,  in  response  to  questions  that  inquired  whether  he  had  any  delinquency
involving routine accounts.
Applicant attributed his financial difficulties, to include his outstanding federal and
state  taxes,  to  being  underemployed.  He  acknowledged,  however,  that  he  also
mismanaged his finances, and he did not seek help when he should have. His finances
spiraled in 2018, when he was hurt on the job and out of work for 11 months. In 2020, he
was hurt on the job again and he was out of work for eight months. During both periods,
he supported himself solely through workers’ compensation, which amounted to only 66%
of his gross annual salary. He testified that he contacted his creditors and informed them
about his inability to pay his debts after he suffered both on-the-job injuries, but only three
of them, whose names he could not recall, were willing to work with him. Although he and
his fiancée have lived together since October 2017, and she contributes to the household
expenses, he was the primary breadwinner and they maintained separate finances. He
returned  to  work in January 2022. He received  a  workers’  compensation  settlement  of
$5,000 in April 2022, which he used, in part, to resolve some of his debts. (Tr. at 29-31,
34-39, 48, 50-51, 59-60, 66-67, 71-72, 83-92, 104-105, 107-109, 111-112; GE 2)
IRS tax account transcripts provided by Applicant with his July 2021 response to
interrogatories reflect that as of June 2021, he timely filed his federal income tax returns
for  TY  2012  and  2014,  and  he  did  not  owe  federal  taxes  for  those  tax  years.  The
transcripts reflect that he filed his federal income tax returns for TY 2016 in June 2017,
for TY 2017 and TY 2018 in May 2020, and for TY 2019 in August 2020. He testified that
he filed his federal income tax returns for TY 2013 and 2015 in 2021, with the help of a
tax company, but he did not provide documentation to corroborate his claim. He testified
that he did not realize he had not timely filed his federal income tax returns for TY 2013
and  2015.  Upon  returning  from  his  2013  overseas  deployment,  he  did  not  think  about
filing his federal income tax return for TY 2013. He testified that he did not timely file his
federal income tax returns for TY 2016 through 2019, because he was “not doing what I
was supposed to do at the time,” and he acknowledged that he filed his federal income
tax returns for those tax years after he completed his SCA, in which he was required to
respond to questions concerning his taxes. He also testified that he timely filed his federal
income tax returns for TY 2020. He also testified that he did not understand there was a
deadline in which he was required to file his federal income tax returns, or that he could
have requested an extension to  do  so.  (SOR ¶ 1.a;  Tr. at 30-31, 39-44, 51-52, 92-97,
102-103; GE 2, 3)
The  transcripts  also  reflect  that  Applicant  owed  federal taxes  in  the  amounts  of
$7,418, $10,340, $1,560, and $1,144 for TY 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively.
He  acknowledged  in  his  response  to  interrogatories  that  he  owed  $20,463  in  federal
taxes.  Although  he  did  not  provide  tax  account  transcripts  for  TY  2013  and  2015,  he
testified that the tax company that filed on his behalf told him he did not owe any federal
income  taxes  for  those  tax  years.  He  stated  in  his  response  to  interrogatories  that  he
unsuccessfully  attempted,  on  multiple  occasions,  to  reach  an  IRS  representative
telephonically to discuss a payment plan for his outstanding federal taxes. He stated that
an IRS representative  told him that the IRS had a significant backlog  and directed him  to
complete   his  request  online   through   the   IRS   website,  but  did   not   give  him   any  further
information. He submitted  an  online  request for a  payment plan  for his federal taxes in
July 2021, and he was awaiting a response. He testified  that he  also  voluntarily mailed a
payment  toward his outstanding  federal  taxes, in the  form  of a  check to  the  IRS  in July
2021, but the  IRS  had  not yet cashed  it. As of the  date  of the  hearing, he  had  not taken
any further action  since  July  2021  concerning  his outstanding  federal taxes.  (SOR ¶¶  1.c-
1.f; Tr. at 39-44, 102-103; GE 2, 3)
Applicant  stated  in  his  response  to  interrogatories  that  he  timely  filed  his  state
income tax returns for TY 2012 and TY 2014. He stated that he filed his state income tax
returns for TY 2016 in June 2017, for TY 2017 and 2018 in May 2020, and for TY 2019 in
August 2020, respectively. He testified that he filed his state income tax returns for TY
2013 and 2015 in 2021, through the same tax company that he used to file his federal
income tax returns for the same TY. He stated in his response to interrogatories that he
was  awaiting  transcripts  from  the  state  tax  authority  reflecting  that  he  filed  his  state
income tax returns for TY 2013 and 2015. He testified that he timely filed his state income
tax returns for TY 2020 and 2021. (SOR ¶ 1.b; Tr. at 44-53; GE 2, 3, 9; AE B)
Applicant testified  that  he  did  not owe  state  taxes for TY  2013, 2015,  2018,  or 2020,
and  that he  paid $230  in  state  taxes that he  owed  for TY 2021  when  he  filed  his state  tax
returns for that TY.  In  his response  to  interrogatories,  Applicant  provided  documentation
from  the  state  tax authority reflecting  that he  owed  $6,949, $612, $621, and  $263, for TY
2015,   2016,  2017,  and   2019,  respectively,  for  a   total  of  $8,446.  He  testified   that  he
received  only one  notice  from  the  state  tax  authority,  in around  2016  or 2017, about his
outstanding  state  taxes, after which  time  he  made  a  one-time  payment of $150. In  July
2017, a  $5,538  state  tax lien  was entered  against  Applicant.  (SOR ¶¶  1.g-1.k;  Tr. at 44-
54, 102-103; GE  2, 3, 9; AE B)
Applicant testified that he agreed on a payment plan with the state tax authority to
resolve the state tax lien and his outstanding state taxes. Documentation reflects that he
entered into a payment agreement with the state tax authority in July 2021, consisting of
monthly payments of $230  for 36 months, and that he made an online payment to the
state tax authority of $250 each for TY 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2019, for a total of $1,000,
in  July  2021.  He  testified  that  he  was  unable  to  abide  by  the  plan’s  monthly  payment
terms, due to the circumstances discussed above, but that he made payments totaling
$2,000 when he could. As of the date of the hearing, he owed $6,481 in outstanding state
taxes. He agreed on another payment plan with the state tax authority  in August 2022,
consisting of monthly payments of $234 for 29 months. His first payment was due within
two days of the hearing date. He testified that he expected to be able to abide by this
payment plan since he was working full time. (SOR ¶¶ 1.g-1.k; Tr. at 44-53; GE 2, 3, 9;
AE B)
Court  records  reflect  that  writs  of  garnishment  were  issued  following  three
judgments  entered  against  Applicant  in  the amounts  of  $1,701,  $8,542,  and  $8,381  in
April  2017,  February  2020,  and  August  2021,  respectively.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.l-1.n)  Applicant
could not recall which debt was associated with the  2017 judgment. He stated that the
2020  judgment  related  to  his  car  that  was  repossessed  after  he  stopped  paying  the
associated loan in December 2019. Court records reflect that the 2021 judgment was also
for his outstanding balance on a car loan, and he testified that this loan related to another
repossessed car. (Tr. at 55-67, 105-112, 114-116; GE 2, 8, 10, 11)
In January 2020, the garnishment order for the 2017 judgment was dismissed and
an order of satisfaction was entered in February 2020. In June 2021, Applicant and the
creditor settled the 2020 judgment and associated fees for $11,700, and Applicant agreed
on a monthly payment plan of $300 for 39 months to resolve the settlement. He testified
that he paid the settlement, but he did not provide documentation to corroborate his claim.
In May 2021, Applicant and the creditor settled the 2021 judgment and associated fees
for  $8,600,  and  Applicant  agreed  on  a  bi-weekly  payment  plan  of  $150  to  pay  the
settlement.  He testified  that he  made  only  one  to  two  payments, and  then  the  creditor
began garnishing his wages. He testified that his wages were being garnished to resolve
this settlement as of the date of the hearing.  (Tr. at 55-67, 105-112, 114-116; GE 2, 8,
10, 11)
SOR  ¶¶  1.o  and  1.p  are  for  two  accounts  placed  for  collection  by  the  same
insurance company, in the amounts of $54 and $556, respectively. Applicant testified that
both debts  stem  from a  billing error  that  has since been  corrected.  He  did not  provide
documentation to corroborate his claim. (Tr. at 67-69)
SOR ¶ 1.q is for a $1,061 wireless, internet, television, and phone account placed
for collection. Applicant testified that he settled this debt with a one-time payment of $500
in around March 2022. He did not provide documentation to corroborate his claim. (Tr. at
69-72)
SOR ¶ 1.r is for another wireless, internet, television, and phone account, placed
for collection for $381. Applicant testified that he paid this debt several days before the

SOR  ¶¶  1.s  through  1.u  are  for  three  debts  in  collection  with  the  VA,  for  $844,
$3,210,  and  $104,  respectively.  Applicant  testified  that  these  debts  also  stem  from  a
billing  error  that  has  since  been  corrected.  He  did  not  provide  documentation  to
corroborate his claim. (Tr. at 73-75)
SOR ¶ 1.v is for Applicant’s $9,341 outstanding balance on a third repossessed
car. In May 2020, he agreed on a payment plan with the creditor consisting of monthly
payments of $200. He testified that he was complying with his payment plan, but he did
not provide documentation to corroborate his claim. (Tr. at 62-67, 105-112, 114-116; GE
2)
SOR ¶ 1.w is for Applicant’s $9,396 outstanding balance on a fourth repossessed
car. He testified that after this car was sold at auction in 2021 for $5,000, he requested
that the creditor update his outstanding balance accordingly. He neither heard from nor
followed up with the creditor as of the date of the hearing. He testified that he planned to
resolve  this  debt  once  he  and  the  creditor  agreed  on  the  amount  of  his  outstanding
balance. (Tr. at 64-67, 105-112, 114-116)
SOR  ¶  1.x  is  for  a  $631  charged-off  account.  Documentation  reflects  that  he
agreed on a payment plan of $150 monthly in May 2021 to resolve this debt. He testified
that he paid this debt in 2021, but he did not provide documentation to corroborate his
claim. (Tr. at 75-77; GE 2)
SOR  ¶¶  1.y  and  1.z  are  for  two  medical  debts,  for  $185  and  $172,  placed  for
collection by the same company. Applicant testified that he paid these debts. He did not
provide documentation to corroborate his claim (Tr. at 72-73)
As of the date of the hearing, Applicant earned approximately $61,000 annually,
and  his  fiancée  earned  approximately  $42,000  annually.  In  September  2022,  the  VA
assigned him a 30% disability rating, from which he expected to receive $532 monthly.
He had $3,200 in his 401(k) retirement account as of August 2022. He used approximately
$3,800 of his $5,000 workers’ compensation claim as the down payment for a car that he
purchased  in  April  2022,  and  for  which  his  monthly  payments  were  $532.  His  fiancée
purchased a home solely in her name in December 2021, and he paid the $1,242 monthly
mortgage. He recently established a budget for himself, with his fiancée’s help, and he
estimated that his monthly net remainder after expenses was $100. He intends to obtain
part-time employment to supplement his income. He intends to timely file his federal and
state income tax returns in the future. He understood that it was his responsibility to gain
control  of  his  finances.  As  of  the  date  of  the  hearing,  he  had  not  received  credit
counseling, but he intended to do so through the VA as suggested by his fiancée. (Tr. at
29-38, 55-57, 66-67, 71-72, 81-82, 84-91, 96-102, 111-113, 116; AE A)
Applicant  testified  that  he  did  not  disclose  his  outstanding  taxes  on  his  SCA
because he did not think about them, and he thought he did not have to list those he had
already resolved. He testified that he received only one notice from the state tax authority,
in  around  2016  or  2017,  about  his  outstanding  state  taxes.  He  testified  that  he  was
unaware  of  the  2017  state  tax  lien  when  he  completed  his  SCA,  because  he  did  not
receive any notice from the state tax authority about it, and that he first learned about the
lien as he underwent the security clearance process. He testified that he did not disclose
his  three  VA  debts  on  his  SCA  because  they  were  not  valid  debts  since  he  was
erroneously billed. He testified that that he was unaware of most of the judgments entered
against him, as he only received notice for one,  which he did not think to disclose. He
testified  that  he  mistakenly  did  not  disclose  his  relevant  car  repossessions  or  wage
garnishments. He testified that he was no longer being garnished for the 2017 judgment
when he completed the SCA, so he did not think he had to list it. He indicated during his
2020 interview with a background investigator that he had so many debts that he was
unable to list them all on his SCA, and he planned to address them during the interview.
(Tr. at 47-48, 53-54, 77-82, 113-114)
