In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  all  the  allegations,  with
explanations. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  33-year-old  network  engineer  employed  by  a  defense  contractor
since November 2017. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from November 2009
to November 2017 and received an honorable discharge. He held a security clearance in
the Navy.
Applicant  married  in  June  2009  and  divorced  in  October  2012.  He  married  his
current  spouse  recently  on  a  date  not  reflected  in  the  record.  He  has  taken  college
courses since August 2019 but has not received a degree.
Applicant testified that his financial problems began around 2016, when his then
girlfriend became pregnant, and he felt an obligation to assist her financially. He stopped
the financial assistance after she had an abortion in May 2017. (Tr. 21, 31.) He has since
married his current spouse and has no further obligations to his ex-girlfriend.
At about the same time, Applicant was involved in an automobile accident in which
his vehicle was totaled, but his insurance coverage was insufficient to cover the full cost
of replacing it. It appears that he was at fault in the accident, having rear-ended another
vehicle. (GX 1 at 37-42; Tr. 31-35.)
Applicant  testified  that  he  has  been  unable  to  deploy  for  the  past  15  months
because  his  security  clearance  was  suspended.  Previously,  about  one-third  of  his
income, about $30,000, was from extra pay during deployments. In addition, his wife, who
is a barber, had reduced income during COVID-19. (Tr. 23-25.)
Applicant testified that he hired a debt-consolidation company to help him resolve
his delinquent debts. He paid the company about $300 per month for more than two years,
until a judgment was entered against him and he realized that it had not provided any
services. (Tr. 19.) He did not provide any documentation of  his contract with the debt-
consolidation company or payments to them.
The debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.f are delinquent credit-card accounts totaling
about  $26,976.  The  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.g-1.j  are  medical  debts  totaling  about
$718. The debts are reflected in credit reports from April 2020 and December 2021 (GX
2 and 3.). I granted Department Counsel’s motion to withdraw SOR ¶ 1.k. (Tr. 14.)
Applicant  testified  that  he  contacted  the  creditor  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.a,  but  the
creditor would not discuss the debt with him because he was represented by the debt-
consolidation company. (Tr. 39.) He made no further attempts to resolve this debt. As of
the date of the hearing, he had not  contacted any of the other creditors alleged in the
SOR. (Tr. 52.)
Applicant currently earns about $5,200 per month, and his spouse works four days
a  week and  earns $100  to  $150  per day. He  described  his financial situation  as “living
paycheck to paycheck.” (Tr. 44.)
