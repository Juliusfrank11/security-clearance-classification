Applicant  admitted  the  two  SOR  allegations  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b).  His
admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  77  years  old.  He  has  been  married  twice  and  has  a  longtime
cohabitant.  After  college,  he  served  as  a  U.S.  Naval  officer  from  1969-71,  with  a
security  clearance.  He  later  earned  a  master’s  degree.  He  has  also  had  a  clearance
since 2004, through various federal contractor jobs. Applicant lived overseas from June
2015  to  December  2017,  working  for  State  Department  contractors.  He  submitted  his
SCA in April 2018, for a job in the U.S. with a defense contractor, a job with an $89,000
annual salary. (GE 1 at 15; Tr. 41-42, 46-48) Shortly before his hearing, he accepted a
new  position  with  another  defense  contractor,  one  that  would  require  him  to  move
across  the  country,  which  he  did  shortly  after  his  hearing.  His  new  job  has  an  annual
salary of $200,000. (AE A; GE 1; Tr. 41-52, 69-70)
The SOR concerns Applicant’s unfiled state and federal income  tax returns from
tax years 2017-2019 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b). Applicant’s tax issues began in 2017 when he
was  working  for  a  State  Department  contractor  at  a  U.S.  Embassy  overseas.  He
typically  utilized  a  well-known  tax  preparation  software  program  to  prepare  his  taxes.
The program developed technical difficulties he was not able to cure at the time and he
was not able to complete or file his 2016 tax returns. Things “snowball[ed]” from there,
as he said he needed to complete his 2016 tax returns before turning to later years. (GE
2 at 7; Tr. 35-36, 41-43) He had not had tax filing issues before then. (Tr. 71)
Applicant  did not declare  any tax issues  on his April 2018  SCA,  (which  he  filed
days before the April 15, 2018 federal tax filing deadline for tax year 2017). However, he
disclosed  his unfiled  returns  in  his October 2018  background  interview.  He  also  noted
that  his  recuperation  from  an  operation  also  impacted  the  filing  of  his  2017  taxes  in
2018. (GE 2 at 7; Tr. 35-36, 41-43)
Applicant authenticated his background interview with a government investigator
(with some edits and margin notes) in February 2021. At that time, he also reported that
his  2017  taxes  had  been  filed,  but  not  2018  or  2019.  He  provided  no  supporting
documentation,  as  requested.  (GE  2)  Applicant  recalled  speaking with  the  investigator
during  his  background  interview  about  his  tax  returns,  and  recalled  speaking  with  a
Department Counsel about them as well, about a year before his hearing. (Tr. 58-61)
Applicant  testified  that  his  tax  issues  were  not  due  to  deliberate  action,  and  he
did  not  intend  to  defraud  the  government.  He  knew  his tax  issues  were  “hanging over
[his]  head.  (Tr. 19-20, 40-41) He  accepted  responsibility for his inaction,  and  asserted
that he was now “back on track” and his issues would not be repeated. (Tr. 49-50, 75)
Applicant filed his 2016 federal tax returns  on  October 17, 2019. He  received a
refund of $7,445. (AE E; Tr. 43-44) (This late filing was not alleged). He did not offer an
explanation for why he did not then address his other unfiled returns more promptly. He
does  his  taxes  through  a  well-known  software  program  rather  than  through  an
accountant. (Tr. 52-55)
Applicant filed his 2017 federal tax returns on April 1, 2020. He received a refund
of $14,810. (AE B, AE E; Tr. 44, 55) He believes he filed his 2017 state tax return at the
same time. (Tr. 55-56)
Applicant filed his 2018 federal tax returns on November 18, 2021. He received a
refund of $445. (AE C; AE E; Tr. 44) He believed he filed his 2018 state tax return at the
same time but was not certain. (Tr. 56-58)
Applicant filed his 2019 federal and state tax returns on September 26, 2021, the
day  before  the  hearing.  He  owed  $1,051  in  federal  taxes,  before  calculation  of  any
penalties. (AE E, AE G, AE H; AE I; Tr. 37-38, 44))
Applicant  filed  his  2020  federal  tax  returns  on  June  12,  2021.  He  received  a
refund  of  $1,734,  later  reduced  by  a  small  penalty  for  late  filing.  (AE  D;  Tr.  44)  He
acknowledged  that  he  prioritized  his  2020  returns  before  finalizing  and  filing  his  2019
returns, which he did in September 2021. (Tr. 61) (This was not addressed at hearing,
but the April 15 federal tax deadline for tax year 2020 was extended by a month due to
the COVID-19 pandemic).
At the time of his hearing, in September 2022, he had yet to file his 2021 federal
tax returns, though he had filed an extension until October 2022, and intended to file his
returns. (Tr. 44-45)
Post-hearing  submissions  from  state  tax  authorities  concern  Applicant’s  state
taxes for 2017-2021. They each contain a stamp from the state department of taxation
dated  November  15,  2022.  Applicant’s  name  does  not  appear  but  his  social  security
number is listed on the documents. (AE L – AE P)
The document from tax year 2017 from  state tax authorities reflects that $4,029
was  withheld  from  Applicant’s  income.  No  tax  is  listed.  Documentation  is  listed  as
having been “received with return.” (AE L)
The  document  from  tax  year  2018  from  state  tax  authorities  reflects  a  tax  of
$2,106, and that $3,012 was withheld from Applicant’s income. (This suggests a refund
of $906). Documentation is listed as having been “received with return.” (AE M)
The document from tax year 2019 from state tax authorities reflects that $3,737
was  withheld  from  Applicant’s  income.  The  line  item  for  tax  owed  is  not  listed  on  the
document.  Documentation  is  listed  as  having  been  “received  with  return.”  (AE  N)  His
2019 state income tax return reflects a $786 refund. (AE I)
The  document  from  tax  year  2020  from  state  tax  authorities  reflects  that
documentation  is  listed  as  having  been  “received  with  return,”  but  no  financial  data  is
provided. (AE O)
The document from tax year 2021 from state tax authorities reflects that $4,156
was withheld from his income. The line item for tax owed is not listed on the document.
(AE P)
Two  colleagues  submitted  references  for  Applicant.  Mr.  C  has  known  Applicant
as  a  friend  and  work  colleague  since  2004.  They  worked  on  a  classified  State
Department project together. Applicant fulfilled his duties in an exemplary manner, and
took  steps  to  avoid  compromise.  He  is a  “good  person” who  “will uphold  the  laws  and
requirements of our nation.” (AE J)
Ms. V worked with Applicant more recently, in 2021 and 2022. He was essential
to  the  project,  and  showed  vital  diligence  and  attention  to  detail.  He  has  an  excellent
work  ethic  and  she  is sorry  to  lose  him  from  her  team.  He  has  always  endeavored  to
show the “ethical and trustworthy behavior necessary for a security clearance.” (AE K)
