Applicant  is  a  49-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor  for  whom  she  has
worked since April 2000. She claimed she was out of work from about June 2017 until
about  February 2018 and  August  2020  until July 2021  while  she  recovered  from  back
surgeries.  There  is  no  evidence  in  the  record  regarding  her  education  level.  She  has
been  married  since  November 1999.  She  has  two  children,  ages  20  and  12.  She  had
two  adult  stepchildren,  both  of  whom  are  deceased.  She  claimed  that  she  has  held  a
security clearance since 1997. (Items 3-5)
The SOR alleges untimely filed federal and state tax returns for the 2014 through
2019 tax years (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b); delinquent federal taxes totaling $19,355 for the
2014  tax  year  (SOR  ¶  1.c);  delinquent  taxes  to  State  A  for  the  2014  tax  year  in  the
amount of $8,219 (SOR ¶ 1.d); delinquent taxes to State A for the 2018 tax year in the
amount of $2,753 (SOR ¶ 1.e); a county tax lien for $238 entered in 2021 (SOR ¶ 1.f); a
2018 judgment for $2,619 (SOR ¶ 1.g); a wage garnishment in 2017 for $2,711 (SOR ¶
1.h);  and  a  delinquent  telecommunications  debt  for  $1,163  (SOR  ¶  1.i).  In  her  SOR
response, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations with additional comments. The SOR
allegations  are  established  through  Applicant’s  admissions  and  the  Government’s
evidence. (Items 1, 3-8)
Applicant  claimed  that  there  are  several  reasons  for  her  financial  difficulties,
including  her failure  to  timely file  and  pay  federal,  state,  and  local taxes.  She  claimed
that  her  husband  suffers  from  a  drug  addiction,  has  undergone  drug  treatment
counseling, and spent six months in prison in 2018. She also claimed that he mentally
abused her in an unspecified manner. Her stepdaughter passed away in 2018 and her
stepson  was  murdered  in  late  2021.  She  was  out  of  work  for  about  eight  months
between 2017 and 2018 and for about a year between 2021 and 2022 because she was
recovering from back surgeries. She also claimed that she financially supports her two
children and two grandchildren. (Items 3-5)
There is documentary evidence that Applicant filed her 2016 federal and State A
income  tax  returns  in  about  May  2021.  Also,  there  is  documentary  evidence  that
Applicant filed her 2019 federal income tax return in about August 2020. Finally, there is
documentary  evidence  that  Applicant  filed  her  2020  federal  and  State  A  income  tax
returns  in  about  May  2021.  The  delinquent  income  tax  returns  listed  in  the  SOR  that
Applicant  eventually  filed  were  all  filed  after  she  submitted  her  Questionnaire  for
National Security Positions (SF 86) and had her security interview. (Item 5)
There is no evidence that the IRS or State A granted Applicant a filing extension
for any of the tax years relevant to the SOR. The documents reflect that she consulted
with a professional tax filing service in order to file these tax returns. Applicant claimed
that  she  would  file  all  of  her  late  income  tax  returns  in  2020,  however,  there  is  no
documentary  evidence  that  Applicant  has  yet  filed  her  2014,  2015,  2017,  and  2018
federal  and  State  A  income  tax  returns.  Also,  there  is  no  documentary  evidence  that
Applicant has filed her 2019 State A income tax return. (Item 5)
The $19,355 federal tax debt for the 2014 tax year alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c has not
been resolved. This balance reflects an offset from  a federal tax refund from the 2020
tax year. Applicant admitted owing these taxes. She provided no documentary evidence
to show that these taxes were paid, disputed, or otherwise resolved. (Items 1, 3-5)
The $8,219 tax debt to State A  alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d was resolved involuntarily
through a wage garnishment in 2017 and 2018. (Items 1, 3, 5)
The  $2,753  tax  debt  to  State  A  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.e  has  not  been  resolved.
Applicant  admitted  this  debt  and  acknowledged  that  she  recently  received  a  wage
garnishment to pay it. She claimed that she has been working overtime in order to pay
the debt more quickly. She provided no documentary evidence to show that these taxes
were paid, disputed, or otherwise resolved. (Items 1, 3, 5, 6, 8)
The $238 lien entered on behalf of County B alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f  has not been
resolved.  Applicant  admitted  this  debt  and  claimed  that  she  will  pay  it.  However,  she
provided  no  documentary  evidence  to  show  that  this  lien  was  satisfied,  disputed,  or
otherwise resolved. (Items 1, 3, 8)
The  $2,619  judgment  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.g  has  not  been  resolved.  Applicant
admitted  this  debt,  but  could  not  recall  its  status.  She  provided  no  documentary
evidence to show that this judgment was paid, disputed, or otherwise resolved. (Items 1,
3, 8)
The 2018 wage garnishment for overdraft fees for  $2,711 alleged in  SOR ¶ 1.h
has  been  resolved.  Applicant  admitted  this  allegation.  She  provided  no  documentary
evidence  to  show  that  this  judgment  was  paid,  disputed,  or  otherwise  resolved.
However, there is no evidence in the record that this garnishment remains in place or is
ongoing. (Items 1, 3, 8)
The $1,163 telecommunications debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.i has not been resolved.
Applicant admitted this debt.  She provided no documentary evidence to show that this
debt was  paid,  disputed, or otherwise  resolved.  This debt does not  appear in the  May
2022 credit report. (Items 1, 3, 4)
Applicant  anticipates  that  she  will  incur  an  additional  approximately  $10,000  in
late federal and state taxes once she files her unfiled tax returns. She claimed that she
will make arrangements to pay these taxes at that time. Applicant did not respond to the
FORM, so more recent information about her finances is not available. (Item 5)
