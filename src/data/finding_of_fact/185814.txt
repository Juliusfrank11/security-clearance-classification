Applicant  is  a  58-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor  for  whom  he  has
worked  since  March  2005.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2012.  He  was  married
from 2007 until 2012, resulting in a divorce. He remarried in 2013 and divorced in 2017.
In 2018, he remarried his second wife, to whom he is still married. He has three  adult
children  and  two  adult  stepchildren.  He  served  in  the  U.S.  Air  Force  from  1983  until
2005, when he received an honorable discharge. (Tr. 21-23, 42; GE 1, 5)
Under Guideline  F, the  Government alleged Applicant’s ten delinquent consumer
debts  totaling   about  $39,000   (SOR  ¶¶   1.a   through   1.j).   Under  Guideline   E,  the
Government alleged  Applicant’s failure to  divulge  the debts listed  in  SOR ¶¶  1.b  through
1.j  in  the   SCA  despite   being   required   to   do   so.  In   both   his   Answer  and   Answer  to
Amendment, Applicant  admitted  the SOR  and  Amended  SOR allegations  with  additional
comment.   While   he   admitted   failing   to   divulge   his  delinquent  debts  on   his  SCA,   he
claimed   that   he   did   not  know   about   these   delinquencies   and   denied   trying   to   mislead
the Government.  (SOR; Amended SOR; Answer;  Amendment to Answer)
The   delinquent  credit   card   for   $2,610   alleged   in   SOR  ¶   1.a   has  not   been
resolved. Applicant  does not know  what this  debt is for and  has  not investigated  it. He
has not  contacted  the  creditor or made  any  payments  on  this  debt  since  2016. (Tr.  24-
25, Amendment Answer, GE  3, 4)
The delinquent credit card for $906 alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b has not been resolved.
Applicant  claimed  that  he  paid  this  debt  in  2018  or  2019,  but  he  provided  no
documentary  evidence  to  corroborate  a  payment.  The  credit  reports  reflect  a  last
payment date of April 2016. (Tr. 25-26; Amendment Answer, GE 2-5)
The  delinquent  credit  card  for  $1,580  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.c  has  been  resolved.
Applicant settled this charged-off debt for less than the full balance in about April 2019.
This  payment  is  corroborated  by  the  February  2022  credit  report.  (Tr.  26-28;
Amendment Answer; GE 3, 5)
The  delinquent  credit  card  for  $1,686  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.d  has  been  resolved.
Applicant  settled  this  charged-off  debt  for  less  than  the  full  balance  in  about  March
2019.  This  payment  is  corroborated  by  the  February  2022  credit  report.  (Tr.  28-29;
Amendment Answer; GE 3, 4, 5)
The  delinquent  credit  card  for  $5,648  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.e  has  not  been
established.  Applicant  is  listed  as  an  authorized  user  on  this  account  and  is  therefore
not legally responsible for the balance. (Tr. 29-31; Amendment Answer; GE 2-5)
The delinquent credit card for $4,230 alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f has not been resolved.
Applicant claimed he does not recall opening or using this account. He believed that his
wife  may  have  opened  this  account  in  his  name,  but  he  has  not  asked  her  about  it
because it is a touchy subject. There is no evidence that he contacted the creditor or the
credit reporting agencies to dispute or otherwise investigate this debt. He has not made
any payments on this debt since 2016. (Tr. 31-32, 34-40; Amendment Answer, GE 2-5)
The  delinquent  credit  card  for  $17,498  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.g  has  not  been
resolved.  Applicant  claimed  he  does  not  recall  opening  or  using  this  account.  He
believed that his wife may have opened this account in his name, but he has not asked
her about it because it is a touchy subject. There is no evidence that he contacted the
creditor or the credit reporting agencies to dispute or otherwise investigate this debt. He
has not made any payments on this debt since 2016. (Tr. 32-40; Amendment Answer,
GE 2-5)
The  delinquent  online  account  for  $750  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.h  has  not  been
resolved.  While  there  is  an  account  with  the  same  creditor  listed  as  a  paid  collection
account  on  the  June  2020  credit  report,  there  is  an  additional  charge-off  account  with
this  creditor  on  the  February  2022  and  November  2022  credit  reports.  Given  this
account’s  inclusion  as  a  charge  off  on  subsequent  credit  reports,  there  is  insufficient
evidence  to  show  that  this  account  has  been  paid  or  otherwise  satisfied.  Additionally,
Applicant testified that has taken no action to resolve this account. He believed that his
wife might have opened this account in his name. He has not contacted the creditor, the
credit reporting agencies, or asked his wife about this account. (Tr. 36-40; Amendment
Answer; GE 2-5)
The delinquent credit card for $3,886 alleged in SOR ¶ 1.i has not been resolved.
Applicant claimed he does not recall opening or using this account. He believed that his
wife  may  have  opened  this  account  in  his  name,  but  he  has  not  asked  her  about  it
because it is a touchy subject. There is no evidence that he contacted the creditor or the
credit reporting agencies to dispute or otherwise investigate this debt. He has not made
any payments on this debt since 2016. (Tr. 37-40; Amendment Answer; GE 2-5)
The  delinquent  rental/leasing  account  for  $512  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.j  has  been
resolved. Applicant settled this charged-off debt for less than the full balance sometime
between 2020 and 2022. This payment is corroborated by the February and November
2022 credit reports. (Tr. 40-42; Amendment Answer; GE 2-5)
Applicant  claimed  that  he  was  not  aware  of  many  of  these  SOR  accounts.  He
claimed that he and his wife had a falling out in about 2016 after they had been living in
separate  places  because  of  work  requirements.  He  also  claimed  that  many  of  these
accounts  became  delinquent  because  his  wife  thought  she  was  going  to  be  earning
more money through a new job that ended up “falling through,” and she “did things she
probably should not have done credit-wise.” She thought they were going to make a lot
more  money  and  that  is  what  put  them  “in  that  position.”  His  father  passed  away  in
August 2022, further delaying his attempt to resolve the SOR debts.
Applicant provided inconsistent evidence with respect to the origination of  some
of the SOR debts. On one hand, he claimed that his wife opened these accounts in his
name, without his knowledge, and that he has confronted her about it. Alternatively, he
claimed  that  he  only  suspected  that  she  did  it,  and  has  not  asked  her  whether  she
opened  these  account  in  his  name.  I  found  that  his  varying  explanations  about  these
accounts  detracted  from  his  credibility.  I  also  found  that  he  showed  a  lack  of  candor
while  testifying  about  his finances  and  his wife’s  potential fraud. (Tr.  20, 30-31, 34-35,
37-40, 42; GE 5)
Despite  telling  the  security  investigator in June  2020  that he  was in the  process
of   filling   out  the   paperwork,  he   has  not   disputed   any   of   the   SOR  debts   with   either  the
creditor or the  credit reporting  agencies. He has not filed  a  police  report with  respect to
any   of   the   SOR  debts.   He  claimed   that  since   2017,  he   and   his  wife   have   been
separating   their   finances  and   that  they   “don’t  talk  finances.”  He  believed   that  his  wife
had  contacted  some  of  the  creditors of  the  SOR debts  that he  thinks she  opened  in  his
name  but he  was not sure. Unless noted  above, there  is no  corroborating  documentary
evidence  of  any  resolution  or attempted  resolution  of  the  SOR debts.  (Tr. 20, 30-31, 34-
35, 37-40, 42; GE 5)
Applicant  claimed  that  he  budgets  his  money  online  through  an  online  banking
tool,  but  he  provided  no  documentary  evidence  of  a  monthly  budget  outlining  income
and  expenses.  He  claimed  that  he  is  responsible  for  paying  for  his  mortgage  and  the
utilities.  He  claimed  his  wife  pays  the  monthly payment  for  a  truck  that  is  in  his name
because his wife could not qualify for the credit necessary to purchase it.  He financed
this truck for his wife in 2021 despite telling a security investigator in June 2020 that he
would  not  cosign  for  her  for  financing.  The  purchase  price  of  this  truck  was  about
$41,000 and the monthly payments are $732. Applicant also recently paid $17,000 for a
camper. The monthly payment on  the  camper is  $300.  He  purchased  a home  in  June
2022 for $369,000. The monthly mortgage payment is $2,600. He purchased a vehicle
in 2021 for $22,000. His monthly payment on that vehicle is $450. He has not taken any
credit counseling. (Tr. 42-44, 49, 57-60; GE 5)
Applicant  claimed  he  takes  home  $7,620  in  income  from  his  wages,  military
service disability, and military retirement.  His wife brings home about $1,100 per  week
in  wages.  He  has  about  $1,500  in  his  savings  account  and  saves  $1,700  to  $1,800
every month. He  could  not plausibly account for the  discrepancy in  his stated monthly
savings  and  his  savings  account  balance.  He  claimed  he  has  about  $153,000  in  his
retirement account. (Tr. 51-54, 56-57; GE 5)
Applicant claimed that he did not disclose any financial delinquencies on his SCA
because he was either unaware of the accounts that he believed his wife opened in his
name without his knowledge, or because he did not understand that he was responsible
for debts that were charged off. However, he reviewed a credit report in April 2019 that
listed  delinquent  accounts  prior  to  filling  out  his  SCA.  He  also  admitted  that  he
suspected that he had outstanding financial delinquencies when he filled out the SCA,
and  that  his  2017  separation  was  partly  attributable  to  financial  issues  caused  by  his
wife’s overspending.  Given  his admitted  suspicion  that  he had financial  delinquencies,
the  timing of  his review of  his credit  report, and  the  implausibility  of  his explanation  of
not understanding the consequence of a charged-off debt, he knew about his financial
delinquencies when he filled out his SCA. He intentionally omitted that information.  He
did  not  volunteer  his  financial  delinquencies  before  a  security  investigator  confronted
him  during  his  June  2020  security  interview.  There  is  no  evidence  of  any  form  of
behavioral or marital counseling. (Tr. 20, 44-49; GE 5)
