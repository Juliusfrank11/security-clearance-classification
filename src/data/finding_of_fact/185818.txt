In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admits  to  all  allegations  in  the  SOR  with
some explanations.
Applicant  is  a  36-year-old  employee  of  a  DOD  contractor  who  seeks  a  security
clearance. He has held a security clearance since 2009. He has been employed with his
current  employer since  January 2021.  He was  employed by  other defense contractors
prior to this position. He earned  a  bachelor’s degree  in the  spring 2022. He married in
2011, but separated from his wife in 2013. They have a ten-year-old son who lives with
his wife. He has lived with a cohabitant since 2018. From 2009 to 2014, he served on
active duty in the United States Army. He was separated for medical reasons due to a
shoulder  injury.  (Gov  2,  Gov  3,  Tr.  19-26)  (Note:  The  facts  in  this  decision  do  not
specifically  describe  employment,  names  of  witnesses,  or  locations  in  order  to  protect
Applicant’s  and  his  family’s  privacy.  The  cited  sources  contain  more  specific
information.)
Drug  Involvement
Under the drug involvement concern, the SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana
from March 2018 to August 2018. (SOR ¶ 1.a: Gov 1 at 1; Gov 2 at 42)  In his response
to the SOR, he admits to using marijuana on a couple occasions. In response to Section
23,  Illegal  Use  of  Drugs  or  Drug  Activity,  on  his  January  21,  2020  security  clearance
application,  he  listed  using  marijuana  between  March  2018  and  August  2018,  on  10
occasions. He indicated he used marijuana for relaxation and pain.  During the hearing,
he testified that he used marijuana to help with pain in his shoulder. He injured his left
shoulder while in the Army. He was ultimately medically boarded and discharged from
the  U.S.  Army  as  a  result  of  this  injury.  He  stopped  using  marijuana  when  the
Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  (VA)  prescribed  him  a  long-term  pain  medication  that
was effective in controlling his pain. (Tr. 26-27; Gov 2 at 27)
Applicant  states  he  never  used  marijuana  before  this  time  and  has  not  used
marijuana since August 2018. He is aware that use of illegal drugs is not consistent with
holding a security clearance.  He provided the results of numerous drug tests taken on
May  14,  2019;  October  22,  2019;  February  3,  2020;  and  September  30,  2021,  which
indicate he tested negative for marijuana and other illicit substances. He tested positive
for his prescribed pain medication. He also provided a statement of intent to refrain from
illegal  drug  use  acknowledging  any  future  use  of  illegal  drugs  would  be  grounds  for
revoking his security clearance. (Tr. 12, 26; Gov 1 at 1, 5 - 21)
Personal Conduct
Under  the  personal  conduct  concern,  the  SOR  alleges  Applicant  deliberately
falsified  material  facts  on  a  security  clearance  application,  dated  April  23,  2019,  when
he answered “No” in response to “Section 23 – Illegal Use of Drugs and Drug Activity –
Illegal  Use  of  Drugs  or  Controlled  Substances  – “In  the  last  seven  years,  have  you
illegally used any drugs or controlled substances? Use of a drug or controlled substance
includes  injecting,  snorting,  inhaling,  swallowing,  experimenting  with  or  otherwise
consuming  any drug  or controlled  substance.” Applicant failed  to  list his marijuana use
between March 2018 and August 2018.  (Tr. 28; Gov 3 at 41)
Applicant admits he failed to list his marijuana use on his 2019 security clearance
application,  but  it  was not  intentional.  He  said  it  did  not  cross  his mind.  He  completed
the 2019  security  clearance  in a hurry.  He  testified 2019  was not a  great  year for him
and he had a lot of other stuff on his mind. He honestly does not know why he did not
list his 2018 marijuana use on the 2019 security clearance application. He did not intend
to  provide  false  or  misleading  information.  (Tr.  28-30;  Gov  1  at  1)  About  nine  months
later,  he  was  asked  to  submit  a  security  clearance  application  for  a  top  secret
clearance.  He  completed  another  security  clearance  application  on  January  21,  2020.
Applicant listed his marijuana use on this application in response to Section 23. (Tr. 29;
Gov 2 at 42)
Financial Considerations
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial  irresponsibility.  The
SOR alleged 26 delinquent accounts, an approximate total balance of $71,891. Three of
the  accounts  were  for  student  loans,  totaling  $25,697.  The  remaining  23  debts  were
consumer/credit card accounts, totaling approximately  $46,194. Applicant purchased a
house  in  2017.  He  started  to  purchase  furniture  and  other  items  for  his  house  and
became financially over-extended. (Tr. 16-18, 32, 52)
In  2019,  Applicant  entered  into  an  agreement  with  a  debt  company  to  help
resolve his accounts. The debt  company advised  Applicant to stop  paying towards his
debts.  They  wanted  the  debts  to  go  delinquent.  They  would  then  negotiate  settlement
agreements  for  their  clients.  Applicant  paid  the  debt  company  money  twice  a  month.
The  debt  company  was  to  use  the  money  for  negotiating  settlements  on  the  debts.
Applicant  did  not  realize  that  his  debts  would  default  if  he  did  not  make  payments
toward  the  accounts.  After  several  months,  he  did  not  think  the  debt  company  was
making  sufficient  progress  satisfying  his  debts.  He  quit  doing  business  with  the  debt
company  in  December 2019  and  began  to  resolve  the  accounts  on  his  own.  Some  of
the accounts were charged off and sent to collection. He said it was his mistake to enter
into  an  agreement  with  the  debt  company.  He  is  now  slowly  working  to  resolve  his
delinquent debts. He claims that he is not living outside his means. He was able to pay
all  of  his accounts  before  he  entered  into  an  agreement  with  the  debt  company.  Over
the past year, he has been able to raise his credit score almost 100 points as a result of
working to get his debts in good standing. (Tr. 16-18, 32-34, 52; Gov 1 at 2-3)
After  the   hearing,  Applicant   consulted   with   a   counselor   from   a   non-profit
counseling service  (counseling service)  on December 20, 2022.  He is working with  them
to  create  a  budget,  and  a  plan  to  resolve  his  debts.  He  entered  into  a  debt  management
agreement  on   December   22,  2022.  The   counseling   service   was  able  to   locate   the
current creditors of the  debts alleged  in SOR ¶¶  1.b, 1.c,  1.g, 1.h  and  1.z.   These  debts
were  added   to   Applicant’s  payment  plan   which   is  to   last  for  a   period   of  40   months.
Applicant   agreed   to   pay   a   first  payment  of  $1,142   a   month   on   January   15,  2023,  and
subsequent   payments   of   $1,117   due   on   the   15th   of   each   month.   He  intends   to   make
payments   by   monthly   allotment   from   his  checking   account.   (AE   B   at  1-11)   It   appears
that all  of Applicant’s unresolved debts were  included  in the  counseling  service  payment
plan.
The status of the debts alleged in the SOR are as follows:
SOR  ¶   3.a:  $7,047  delinquent  student  loan  account  placed  for  collection.
Applicant  claims  this account was a mistake  on his  credit report.  He  disputed  it online

locate  the  current  creditor  and  the  debt  was  added  to  the  new  payment  agreement
Applicant has with the counseling service. (Tr. 14, 32-34; Gov 1 at 3; AE B at 2, 11)
