In Applicant’s answer, she admitted the six debts alleged in the SOR at ¶¶ 1.a-1.f.
Her admissions are included in the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 52 years old. She has earned a bachelor’s degree, a master’s degree
in business administration (MBA), and a teaching certificate. She is employed as a project
manager by a large defense contractor at a naval shipyard and has worked there since
September 2009, largely in a cleared position. (GE 1; Tr. 8-9, 20-24, 37, 89-90) She earns
an annual salary of almost $76,800. (AE E) She is well-regarded at work. (AE F) She has
never married. She has no children of her own, but she is a licensed foster parent. (GE
1; AE J; AE Q)
The SOR concerns six delinquent debts, discussed below. Applicant’s debts are
established  by  her  admissions  and  by  credit  reports  in  the  record,  from  May  2020,
February 2021, and February 2022, as well as a January 2020 credit report provided by
Applicant after the hearing. (GE 3 at 3; GE 4 at 11-12, GE 2-GE 4; AE S at 5)
Applicant testified that her financial problems began in March 2019, when she was
hit by a car while walking her dog. She said her student loans were in good standing at
that  point.  She  missed  several  months  of  work,  and  her  student  loans  went  into
forbearance. She has been trying to work with her student loan provider since then. (Tr.
25)
SOR ¶¶  1.a  ($93) and  1.b  ($537) are debts that  are past due  to  unidentified  medical
creditors.   (GE  2   at  2,   GE   3   at  2)   After  Applicant’s  accident,   she   received   a   financial
settlement of about $100,000.  She  then  was able to  address her medical debts.  (Tr. 30-
32; AE  C)  She  testified  that she  intended  to  pay certain medical debts first, such  as  the
$537 debt at SOR ¶ 1.b, but that the creditor often assigned her payments to other debts.
(Tr. 40-43) The settlement covered about $40,600 in specific medical expenses, with a
remainder of about $59,000. (AE C) After addressing her medical debts, she then turned
to other debts on her credit report. (Tr. 30-32, 40-43)
A post-hearing document reflected $628 in medical debts with a collector. These
debt were incurred from 2015, 2016, 2020, 2021, and 2022. (AE R) It is not clear if these
debts are  reflected  in the  SOR.  They  largely either pre-date the accident  or are  dated
after the accident settlement.
SOR ¶ 1.e ($405) is a debt that has been charged off by a money lender. Applicant
also  asserted that  this debt  has been  paid, and this payment  is reflected in a  January
2020 credit report she provided. (Tr. 32, 55, 56-58; AE S at 6) Later credit reports show
a $200 past-due balance. (GE 2 at 7; GE 3 at 4)
SOR ¶ 1.f ($4,612) is a debt placed for collection. (GE 4 at 12) She believes this
debt has been paid off. (Tr. 33) A post-hearing document from January 2020 shows that
this debt rose to $5,212. (AE S at 5) It is not reflected on later credit reports. Applicant did
not provide documentation that this debt is being resolved.
The  two  largest debts by far are  Applicant’s delinquent federal student loans, SOR
¶¶  1.c ($114,425) and  1.d  ($58,775), totaling  $173,200. (GE  2  at 6; AE  S  at 5)  This is
almost  exactly the  amount reflected  in  the  post-hearing  document  she  submitted  detailing
her student loans. ($154,815 in principal and  $18,386 in interest, totaling  $173,201). (AE
P)   The   most  recent  credit  report  in  the   record,  from   February  2022,  shows  that  the
accounts are  in “Pays as Agreed” status,  with  no  past-due  amount.  No payment  amount
due is reflected, however. (GE 2 at 6)
Applicant  financed her graduate  education  and  some  of  her certificates  through
student loans. She had a scholarship in college. She was working on paying them off until
her accident in March 2019. Until then, her loans were in good standing. She then put her
loans  into  forbearance  status.  (Tr.  24-26,  38,  44-45)  Credit  reports  reflect  that  they
became delinquent in about March 2020, but that they were also delinquent in 2018 and
2019. (GE 2 at 3-4).
Following the accident, Applicant was out of work for about four months, until July
2019, and she fell behind on her bills. She was on short-term disability before going back
to  work.  (Tr.  26-27,  33-34;  GE  1;  AE  B)  At  the  time  of  her  accident,  she  was  making
minimum payments on her loans to keep them current. (Tr. 36, 77)
AE A is a document from Applicant’s loan-rehabilitation company, dated April 24,
2020. At that time, she owed $154,314 in principal plus $18,386 interest, and $31,037 in
collection costs, for a total of $203,737. She was in discussions with the company but has
had trouble figuring out who to contact. She had yet to formalize an agreement or put it
into  effect.  (Tr.  34-35,  77-78)  She  hopes  to  have  her  loans  forgiven.  She  applied  for
President Biden’s student loan  forgiveness program  shortly before the  hearing  when  it
was  implemented.  (Tr.  34-35,  69-70,  77-78,  85-88;  AE  O)  (That  program  is  now  the
subject of ongoing federal litigation and remains on hold).
At the time of the hearing, repayment of federal student loans had been on hold
due to the COVID-19 pandemic under multiple Presidential Executive Orders since March
2020.  Federal  student  loan  payments  remain  paused  until  June  30,  2023.  See
https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19.
Applicant said she is also working  part-time to earn more income. She works as a
substitute  teacher  and  in sports therapy, providing  therapy  to  children.  Her  income  from
those  positions  is limited.  (Tr. 47-53, 75,  AE  G,  AE  H)  She  takes  home  about $3,900  a
month  from  her full-time  job  at the  shipyard. (Tr. 59) She  has about $2,300  in checking
and  savings accounts  combined. (Tr. 59-63)  She   has   about $55,000  in   her company’s
retirement plan. (AE  E)  She  rents her home  and  is looking  to  buy a  house. (AE  K, AE  L,
AE  M, AE  N)  She  recognizes that her student loans  are problematic  in that regard.  (Tr.
78)  Last year,  she  retained  a  credit repair  company to  dispute  her debts. She  paid them
$100  a  month  but  soon  realized  she  could  do  the  work herself. She  has also worked  to
cut unnecessary expenses. (Tr. 70-71)
Applicant has been a licensed foster parent for about six years. She often cares
for as many as five foster children at a time. At the time of the hearing, she was caring for
three  foster  children,  ages  7,  10,  and  16.  (Tr.  64-70,  74-75;  AE  J)  She  is  an  active
volunteer in her community. (AE I)
