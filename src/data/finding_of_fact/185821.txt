In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions
are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 60-year-old ship designer employed by a defense contractor since
August  2003.  He  earned  associate’s  degrees  in  August  1983  and  May  1997  and  a
bachelor’s  degree  in  July  2013.  He  married  in  October  2018  and  has  four  adult
stepchildren. He received a security clearance in July 2004, which was renewed in April
2010.
In  March  2001,  Applicant  filed  a  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  petition,  listing  debts
totaling $102,111. The petition was dismissed in March 2004 for failure to comply with a
court order. (GX 6.) The bankruptcy is not alleged in the SOR.
The SOR alleges 16 delinquent debts. Thirteen of the debts are student loans. The
debts are reflected in credit reports from February 2020, February 2021, and April 2022
(GX 2, 3, and 4.) and in court records from February 2017 through January 2022 (GX 5).
The evidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below.
SOR ¶  1.a: credit-card account  placed for collection of  $7,664. This debt was
charged  off  in  April  2015.  (GX  3  at  3.)  On  January  17,  2023,  Applicant  entered  into  a
payment agreement providing for  307 monthly payments of $25. (AX A.) On the same
day, he settled a second debt with this creditor for an unsecured personal loan, which is
not alleged in the SOR, for $162. (AX B.)
SOR  ¶¶   1.b-1.j:  student   loans   placed  for   collection  by   the   Department  of
Education totaling about  $64,900.  These loans were placed for collection in 2018. (GX
3 at 2-4.) Applicant made $50 payments in April, August, and October 2020. (AX H, I, and
J.) At the hearing, he was unsure whether they had been in forbearance for any time. (Tr.
21-25.) He took no further action to resolve them until he applied for the one-time Student
Loan  Debt  Relief  plan  announced  by  the  President  on  August  24,  2022.  (AX  C.)  On
January 24, 2023, he contacted a debt-resolution company for assistance in consolidating
and  resolving  his  federal  student  loans.  As  of  the  date  the  record  closed,  he  had  not
accepted the terms of the subsequent debt-resolution contract or made the initial payment
of $1,095. (AX K.)
SOR ¶¶  1.k-1.n: private student loans  placed for collection of  a  total of  about
$41,132.
These  loans  were  placed  for  collection  in  January  2020.  (GX  4  at  13-14.)
Applicant made  one $50  payment  on  this debt  in  May  2020.  (AX G.)  He  submitted no
evidence of any further payments or efforts to resolve them.
SOR ¶  1.o: telecommunications account  placed for collection of  $683.  This
debt was placed for collection in February 2020. (GX 4 at 19.) Applicant testified that he
contacted  this  creditor  two  or  three  weeks  before  the  hearing.  (Tr.  37-38.)  He  did  not
present any evidence of payments or a payment agreement.
SOR ¶  1.p: medical debt  placed for collection of  $193.  This debt was placed
for collection in March 2017. (GX 4 at 20.) Applicant paid it on January 23, 2023. (AX F.)
Applicant testified that the  student loans were in forbearance for a while, but he
did  not  know  when  the  forbearance  ended.  He  was  not  sure  whether  he  made  any
payments before the forbearance. (Tr. 19-22.) He did not remember the amounts of any
payments that he made. (Tr. 25.) As of the date of the hearing, he did not know the status
of the private student loans. (Tr. 26.)
Applicant’s annual income is about $56,000. His spouse earns about $38,000 per
year. (Tr. 39-40.) He has nominal savings but has a retirement account of about $90,000.
He testified that he and his spouse live paycheck to paycheck. (Tr. 43.) Default judgments
for unpaid rent on his home were entered against him in March 2021 and January 2022.
(GX 5 at 3-6.) These judgments are not alleged in the SOR.
