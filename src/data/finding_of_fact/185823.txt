Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. She is 43 years old. She married in
2009 and divorced in 2012. She has two children; one is an adult and the other is a minor.
One of her children is physically and intellectually disabled and requires personal care
and  supervision.  Applicant  graduated  from  high  school  in  1997,  and  she  obtained  a
bachelor’s  degree  in  2011.  She  has  owned  her  home  in  state  A  since  October  2017,
where she lives with both of her children. (Answer; Tr. at 7-8, 20-22, 45-48; GE 1; AE A)
Applicant  was  unemployed  from  December  2010  to  March  2012,  after  she
relocated  to  state  B.  During  this  time,  she  provided  24-hour  home  care  to  her  elderly
grandparent.  She  worked  for  a  previous  DOD  contractor  from  February  2018  to  April
2020. She was unemployed for one month in 2020.  As of the date of the hearing,  she
worked  as  a  senior  software  engineer  for her  employer,  a  DOD  contractor,  since  May
2020. She was first granted a security clearance in 2018. As of the date of the hearing,
she held access to public trust since 2012. (Tr. at 5-9, 22-30; GE 1; AE A)
The  SOR alleged  that Applicant  failed  to  timely  file  her federal and  state  income
tax  returns  for tax  year (TY) 2017, as required  (SOR  ¶  1.a).  It  also  alleged  that  she  had
two   delinquent  medical  debts,   totaling   $2,827   (SOR  ¶¶   1.b,  1.e),  and   13   delinquent
consumer debts,  totaling  $39,748  (SOR ¶¶  1.c,  1.d, 1.f  - 1.p).  The  SOR allegations are
established  by  Applicant’s admissions  in her  Answer;  her May  2020  security  clearance
application   (SCA);  her  April  2021   response   to   interrogatories;   a  background   interview
conducted  in  June  2020; and  credit  bureau  reports from  2020  and  2021.  SOR  ¶¶  1.c and
1.e  through  1.p  are reported  on  the  2020  credit bureau  report. SOR ¶¶ 1.b  through  1.k
are reported  on  the  2021  credit bureau report.  (Answer; GE 1-4)
Applicant attributed her failure to timely file her federal and state income tax returns
for TY 2017 to losing her tax documentation when she moved into her home in 2017, and
then having to reassemble her required tax documentation. She stated, “And it honestly
slipped my mind, because I’m one of  those people, since I never owe, I usually file my
taxes  later  in  the  year,  and  I  just  didn’t  that  year.”  She  also  testified  that  she  was
misinformed  by  a  family  member,  years  ago,  that  she  had  seven  years  to  file  her  tax
returns if she did not owe taxes, and because she was due federal and state tax refunds
for TY 2017, she mistakenly relied on that misinformation. (Tr. at 31-33, 82-88; GE 1, 2;
AE A)
Applicant  completed  both  her federal and  state  income  tax  returns  for TY  2017
using an online tax filing software, but she could not file them electronically because too
much time had lapsed since they were due. She mailed her federal income tax return for
TY 2017 to the IRS in September 2021. As of the date of the hearing, she had not yet
mailed her completed state income tax return for TY 2017 to the state tax authority, but
she stated that she would do so. She forfeited her federal and state income tax refunds
for TY 2017 due to her late filing. (Answer; Tr. at 31-33, 82-88; GE 1, 2; AE A)
April 2021 IRS tax account transcripts reflect that Applicant filed her federal income
tax returns for TY 2016 in April 2017, for TY 2018 in May 2019, and for TY 2019 in March
2020.  The  transcripts  also  reflect  that  Applicant  was  issued  refunds  in  the  amounts  of
$572;  $2,260;  and  $3,353,  respectively.  She  stated  in  her  2021  response  to
interrogatories that she filed her state income tax returns: (1) for TY 2016, but the date in
which  she  filed  was  not  listed  on  the  tax  documentation;  (2) for  TY  2018  and  2019  in
March 2019 and February 2020, respectively; and (3) she anticipated owing $1 in state
taxes for TY 2016, and nothing in state taxes for TY 2017 to 2019. (Answer; GE 1, 2; Tr.
at 31-33, 82-88; GE 2; AE A)
Applicant  attributed  her  delinquent  consumer  debts  to  beginning  in  2014,  when
she transferred jobs due to a lack of income. Simultaneously, her roommate moved out
of  their  rental  abruptly,  and  the  leasing  company  charged  Applicant  $3,120  in fees for
breaking her lease. She also experienced financial strain when she had medical issues
related to a minor surgery in approximately 2014 and a major surgery in 2016, for which
she was hospitalized. Losing her grandmother in 2015 and her niece in 2017 also weighed
heavily on her. (Answer; GE 1, 2; Tr. at 21, 36-45, 88-89; AE A)
Applicant stated that when she purchased her home in 2017, “I had really decent
credit . . . and then things kind of got out of hand.” She was unprepared for the expenses
of homeownership. She earned minimal income from September 2017 to February 2018.
She did not expect  that her job  would turn out to be a sales position,  with  her income
dependent on earning commissions. She left her sales position “because I couldn’t make
enough  money  to  pay  my  bills,”  and  she  obtained  employment  with  a  previous  DOD
contractor in February 2018. She stated that “by that time, it was a snowball effect.” She
did  not  reach  out  to  any  of  her  creditors  to  try  to  work  out  payment  arrangements.
(Answer; GE 1, 2; Tr. at 21, 36-45, 88-89; AE A)
In October 2019, Applicant contacted a debt-consolidation company (Company A)
to clean up and get control of her credit. Company A provided her with credit counseling.
Company A told her that she did not qualify for consolidation, due to the nature of her
collection  accounts  and  her  desire  to  include  debts  that  were  not  yet  delinquent.  She
chose  to  take  a  “short-term  hit”  for  a  “long-term  gain.”  At  Company  A’s  advice,  she
enrolled
in  Company  A’s  debt-settlement  program;  immediately  stopped  making
payments toward any of the creditors included in her program, to include those debts that
were not yet delinquent; and referred her creditors to Company A. Company A negotiated
her debts on her behalf. (Answer; GE 1, 2; Tr. at 21, 36-43, 45-48, 51, 58, 61-63, 68-69,
73; AE A)
Applicant  paid  approximately  $612  monthly  into  Company  A’s  debt-settlement
program, from around November 2019 to August 2021. She then graduated to Company
A’s  debt-consolidation  program,  and  company  A  settled  her  debts  utilizing  money  she
paid  into  Company  A’s settlement  program, as well  as a  $24,000  loan  she  obtained  in
September  2021.  At  her  ex-spouse’s  suggestion,  she  also  refinanced  her  home  in
November 2019, for a better interest rate that would lower her monthly mortgage and free
up money to allow her to continue addressing her debts. Through refinancing, her monthly
mortgage payment decreased by approximately $61, to $1,719 monthly. (Answer; GE 1,
2; Tr. at 21, 36-43, 45-48, 51, 58, 61-63, 68-69, 73; AE A)

reports reflect that this debt is paid. (Answer; Tr. at 33-35; GE 3; AE A)
SOR ¶ 1.c is for a $920 home internet account in collection. Applicant indicated
during her background interview that when she moved in 2017, she transferred her home
internet service from her previous home to her current home. The service provider created
a second account for her, but continued to bill her for the old account.  She settled this
debt for $459 in June 2021. (Answer; Tr. at 35-36, 42-43; GE 2, 3, 4; AE A)
SOR  ¶  1.d  is  for  a  $3,120  rental  account  in  collection,  for  charges  related  to
Applicant  breaking  her  lease  in  2014.  The  charges  consisted  of  two  months’  rent,  in
addition to cleaning fees. Applicant offered to pay the leasing company one month’s rent,
or $1,400, but the leasing company rejected her offer and demanded she pay the charges
in full. On her minimal income at the time, she could not afford to pay the leasing company
$3,120, so she applied the $1,400 she offered the leasing company to expenses related
to her home. She settled this debt for $1,560 in August 2021. Her April 2022 credit bureau
reports reflect that this debt is paid. (Answer; Tr. at 43-45, 48-49; GE 3; AE A)

1, 2, 4)
