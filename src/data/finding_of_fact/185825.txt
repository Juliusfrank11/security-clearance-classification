Applicant  is  a  55-year-old  civilian  of  a  defense  contractor  who  seeks  a  security
clearance.  Admitted  facts  are  adopted  and  incorporated  by  reference.  Additional
findings of fact follow.
Background
Applicant  married  in  May  1989  and  divorced  in  April  1993.  (GE  1)  He  has  no
children  from  this  marriage.  (GE  1)  He  remarried  in  June  1998  and  has  no  children
from  this  marriage.  (GE  1;  Tr.  45,  59-60)  Applicant  has  taken  vocational  and  college
classes  over  the  course  of  a  number  of  years  (January  2000  to  March  2012)  without
earning a degree or diploma. (GE1; Tr. 16-17) He enlisted in the Army Inactive Reserve
in  October  1985  and  served  five  years  of  military  service.  He  received  an  honorable
discharge in February 1990. (GEs 1-2 and AEs F-G; Tr. 19)
Since November 2021, Applicant has been employed by his current employer as
a  network  installer.  (GE  1;  Tr.  17,  44)  Previously,  he  has  worked  for  other  employers
(some  contemporaneously)  in  various  positions  in  the  engineering  and  electronics
fields. (GE 1) Applicant has previously held a security clearance, both during his military
service and civilian employments. (GE 1; Tr. 17-18, 36)
Applicant’s finances
three
Applicant’s  credit   reports  documented   Applicant’s  accumulation   of
delinquent,  charged-off   accounts  between   2018   and   2021.   (GEs   3-6)  Applicant’s
delinquent  accounts  are  reported  as follows:  SOR ¶¶  1.a  (for  $2,282); 1.b  (for $4,031);
and   1.c (for $15,207). He attributed  his  debt  delinquencies  to  oversight and  fraudulent
use   of  his credit  card by  a   woman   he   befriended   on-line.  (GE 2   and   AEs  B-E;  Tr. 20-
27))
Applicant has since  arranged  payment plans  with  SOR creditors 1.a  and  1.b  that
call   for  $50   a   month,  beginning   in  June   2021   with   SOR  creditor  1.a   and   September
2022  with  SOR creditor 1.b. (AEs  A-B;  Tr. 22-24,  38-40)  Addressing  his disputed  debt
with   SOR  creditor 1.c,   Applicant  filed  a   criminal complaint  with   the   attorney  general of
his state  in March 2018, claiming  the African  woman  he  met  in  an  online  chat room  in
2018   asked   for  financial  assistance   in   exchange   for   an   investment  opportunity  in   an
overseas   construction   company.   (GE   2   and   AE   D   Tr.   24-26)  Once   he   saw  deposits
appear  in  his  SOR  creditor  1.c   account  and   then   mysteriously  removed   before  his
account  was   linked   to   three   other  on-line   accounts   unknown   to   him,  he   contacted   his
bank (SOR  creditor 1.c) and  reported  unauthorized activity in his account. (AE D; Tr. 36-
37)
Responding  to  Applicant’s complaints,  his SOR creditor 1.c froze  his credit card
account and  initiated  an  investigation. (AE  D)  After  completing  an  internal investigation,
SOR creditor  1.c  informed  Applicant  that (a)  the  overdrawn balance  in his creditor card
account had increased  to  $13,000  and  (b) the  creditor wanted  no  further business  from
Applicant.  (AE  D)  No further results of  investigation  by either his creditor (SOR  creditor
1.c  or his state’s attorney general’s office are available.
Without more  information  from  Applicant,  no inferences  can  be  drawn  as  to  the
merits of his dispute with SOR creditor 1.c over his unresolved credit card balance with
the  creditor  who  (SOR  creditor  1.c)  thereafter  charged  off  Applicant’s  $15,207  credit
card  debt  (exact  date  unknown)  and  has  not  pursued  Applicant  with  any  collection
actions. (GE 6)
Applicant’s  on-line  dating website chats
Between  2017  and  2018,  Applicant  communicated  and  provided  monetary
assistance  to  two  foreign  nationals  he  met  on  an  online  dating  website  (one  from  the
Philippines and one from Africa). (GE 2 and AEs E and I; Tr. 27-28, 40-41) He attributed
his  accessing  these  websites to “intriguing curiosity.”  (Tr. 45)  He has no  real hobbies
that interest him and has not explored marriage counseling with his wife. (Tr. 48) Asked
about the state of his marriage, he considers his marriage relationship to be “strong and
solid.” (Tr. 48)
Information  supplied  by  Applicant  to  an  investigating  agent  from  the  Office  of
Personnel  Management  (OPM)  confirmed  Applicant’s  transferring  over  $2,300  in
varying increments to the Philippine national he befriended between October 2017 and
May 2018. (GEs 2 and AEs E and I; Tr. 27-28) Each of these women asked for financial
assistance, which he provided before breaking off his contacts with both women in 2018
to fulfill his wife’s family demands. (Tr. 28).
Applicant assured that he has since timely informed his wife of his contacts and
money  transfers  to  the  foreign  nationals  he  befriended  in  online  dating  web-sites.  (Tr.
41,  47)  Asked  to  confirm  her  understanding  of  Applicant’s  communications  with  the
foreign nationals he contacted on the dating websites he accessed, his wife responded
that  she  became  aware  of  Applicant’s  contacts  in  2016,  two  years  before  Applicant
initiated  his contacts with  the  women.  (Tr. 61,  64) Questioned  further  about  when  she
became aware of Applicant’s remitting money to these foreign nationals, she indicated
she learned of these money transfers (uncertain of amounts) much later. (Tr. 63) With
his  wife’s  uncertainty  over  the  dates  and  details  of  his  communications  with  these
foreign nationals, assigned weight to his wife’s hearing testimony is quite limited.
Applicant confirmed his frequent communications with these two women and the
frequent support payments in various amounts he provided them (ranging from weekly
to monthly). (GE 2 and AEs E and I; Tr. 31-32) Since breaking off his contacts with the
women  he  met  in  his  online  dating  website  and  ceasing  his  financial  support  he
provided them in 2017 and 2018, he  has come to realize his mistakes in helping these
women and will never repeat his errors in judgment. (GE 2)
Applicant’s  E-QIP omissions
Asked  to  complete  an  e-QIP  in  June  2019,  Applicant  denied  ever  providing
financial  assistance  to  a  foreign  national.  (GE  1)  He  attributed  his  omissions  to
inadvertence  and  his  misunderstanding  of  the  phrase  “foreign  national.”  (GE  2  and
Response  to SOR;  Tr.  30-31) When asked about his  repeating  his denials of contacts
with  the  two  foreign  nationals  from  the  Philippines  and  Africa,  respectively,  in  a  PSI
conducted  in  September  2019,  Applicant  initially  confirmed  his  negative  responses  in
his  e-QIP.  (GE  2)  Confronted  with  information  about  the  Philippine  national  he
communicated  with,  he  acknowledged  his  contacting  her  with  varying  frequency,
between  February  2017  and  September  2018.  (GE  2)  Confronted  about  providing
financial  support  to  this  Philippine  national,  he  acknowledged  both  a  relationship  of
friendship and affection  with the foreign national and providing financial  support to her
exceeding  $17,000  (in  increments  ranging  from  $20  to  $900)  over  a  lengthy  stretch
spanning May 2017 to December 2018 . (GE 2 and AE E)
Confronted  with  information  about  his  contact  with  an  African  national  in  an
online dating site, Applicant acknowledged his contacts with this foreign national over a
period of many months spanning July 2017 and July 2018. (GE 2 and AEs E and I; Tr.
31-32)  Pressed  by  the  OPM  agent  about  dates  and  money  amounts  he  provided  this

Queried  further  by  the  interviewing  OPM  agent  in  his  November  2019  PSI,
Applicant  acknowledged  his taking  money  from  this  African  foreign  national  and  using
the money to purchase gift cards in U.S. stores, which he returned to her for use in her
business.  (GE  2).  He  admitted  to  35  transactions  with  local  stores  costing  exceeding
$17,000  in  U.S.  dollars.  Records  confirm  that  in  May  2018  alone,  Applicant  received
money from the African national exceeding $3,000. (GE 2)
