In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  all  the  allegations,  with
explanations. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 28-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from
high school in June 2013 and worked at various jobs in the private sector until December
2019. He was unemployed from December 2019 to February 2020, when he was hired
for his current job. He was trained as a welder but is working as an electrician. (Tr. 13.)
He has never held a security clearance. He has never married and has no children.
In November 2011, while Applicant was in high school, he and two other juveniles
were apprehended for shoplifting packages of cold medicine from a Navy Exchange store.
They were issued “no trespass” orders and released to their parents. (GX 6.) This incident
was not alleged in the SOR.
In January 2017, Applicant was driving without insurance, a misdemeanor. He was
fined $100 plus court costs. (GX 3 at 9.) This incident is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g.
In  April  and  May  2017,  Applicant  was  charged  with  driving  with  a  revoked  or
suspended driver’s license, a misdemeanor, on two occasions. The offenses were within
two  days  of  each  other  but  in  different  locations.  For  each  offense,  he  was  fined  and
assessed court costs. (GX 3 at 7-8.) These offenses are alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f.
In  July 2017, Applicant  was charged with failure  to appear, a misdemeanor. He
was convicted and fined. (GX 3 at 6.) This offense is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d.
In  the  summer of  2017,  Applicant was  charged  with stealing a  basketball pump
from a Navy Exchange store, convicted, and sentenced to 24 hours of community service.
In  July 2017, he was barred  from the  Navy  base  where the theft occurred.  In  January
2021, he wrote a letter to the base commander, asking that the bar be lifted so that he
could work on the base. The base commander granted his request and lifted the bar. (AX
D.) This incident is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a, but the date is incorrectly alleged in the SOR as
2018 instead of 2017.
In March 2018, Applicant was charged with possession of marijuana and driving
without a license. In October 2018, he was convicted of both offenses. For the marijuana
offense,  he  was  sentenced  to  12  days  in  jail  (suspended),  placed  on  unsupervised
probation for 36 months, and fined $250 plus court costs. For driving without a license,
he was sentenced to 60 days in jail (with 50 days suspended) and fined $250. (GX 3 at
3; GX 4.) These offenses are alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c.
At the hearing, Applicant testified that the marijuana incident happened because a
friend had left a small quantity of marijuana in his car and that he was unaware of it until
he  was stopped by  the  police. When  asked by  Department Counsel when  he had last
used marijuana, he admitted that he used it about four months before the hearing. (Tr.
27.) He characterized this use as a “one time thing,” in which he went to a party and “got
influenced” to use it. (Tr. 3.) This recent use of marijuana is not alleged in the SOR.
As of the date of the hearing, Applicant had not paid the fines and court costs for
the convictions alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c. (GX 3 at 5.) He paid the fines and costs
totaling $1,596 on January 23, 2023, five days after the hearing. On January 24, 2023,
he  paid  $82  in  court  costs,  fines,  and  interest.  His  documents  do  not  identify  which
offenses were the basis of these fines and court costs. (AX E.)
After the hearing, Applicant’s program manager submitted a letter attesting to his
hard work, excellent performance, and good conduct. (AX A.)
