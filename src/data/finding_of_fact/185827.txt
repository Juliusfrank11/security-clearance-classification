The SOR alleges that Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, is delinquent on
federal income taxes for multiple tax years totaling approximately $421,176, delinquent
on state income taxes in the approximate amount of $6,129, ten delinquent student loans
totaling approximately $252,335, and 3 additional delinquent debts totaling approximately
$15,212. In Applicant’s Answer to the SOR and Response to the FORM, she admitted all
SOR allegations. Her admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
SOR   ¶   1.a:  Applicant  filed  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  in  2011.  She  states  the
bankruptcy was a result of her husband being out of work for almost two years starting in
the summer of 2007. During this period the family relied on a single income. (Answer at
1.) She offered her September 2011 Discharge of Debtor letter from the Bankruptcy Court
as evidence of the final order releasing her of her debts. (AE at 5.)
SOR ¶  1.b: delinquent federal income taxes for tax years 2007 through 2018
in the approximate amount of $421,176. In her PSI she told the investigator she was
just late when she filed. (Item 11 at 6.) In two letters in June 2020, the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) temporarily closed her case for tax years 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012,
2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018. (AE at 6 and AE at 7.) The IRS stated in both
letters she still owed the amounts in question. She was further advised to continue making
voluntary  payments  for  the  amounts  owed.  The  IRS  noted  applicable  penalties  and
interest would continue to accrue. (AE at 6 and 7.) She provided canceled checks showing
a monthly $700 payment to the IRS from June 2019 through April 2020. (AE at 8-18.) She
also provided evidence of a payment in November 2021. (AE at 19.) She explained that
“once things improved due to COVID-19, [the IRS] would reconnect and reopen the case.”
(RE at 2.) She stated that she had been working with the IRS to reinstate the installment
agreement closed by the IRS and that she had submitted forms 433F (Financial Collection
Information Statement) and 9465 (Installment Agreement Request) per the IRS's request.
(RE at 2.) Until the plan is approved she said that she is resuming monthly payments of
$700, based on the pre-COVID agreement. She provided a receipt for a payment made
for tax year 2011 taxes dated in November 2022. (RE at 7.)
SOR ¶ 1.c: delinquent state  income  taxes totaling approximately  $6,129.  She
provided   documentation   showing   she   entered   into   a   payment  agreement  effective
October 31, 2021. (AE  at 20-21.)  She  provided  her  payment history  and  correspondence
showing  that  the  debt was paid in full  in  November 2022.  This debt is resolved.  (RE at 8-
13.)
SOR  ¶¶   1.d-1.i  and   1.k-1.o:  ten  student  loan  accounts  placed  for  collection
totaling $252,335. (Item 7.) A September 2022 credit report  shows that these student
loans were first reported delinquent in May 2018, with a last payment date of April 2020.
(Item 7 at 5, 6, 5, 7, 4, 4, 6, 4, 5, and 7.) In April 2020, the Department of Education issued
her  employer  a  Notice  of  Cancellation  Order  For  Withholding  Of  Wages  For  All
Employees (Order). The Order requested her company cease garnishment of her wages
to  provide  relief  to  those  impacted  by  COVID-19.  (AE  at  27.)  Applicant  states  in  her
Answer that “the  plan  is  to  resume  payments in May 2022” and  adds in her Response
that she has been in discussion with the Department of Education to work on reinstating
a payment plan. (RE at 6.) Until the payment plan is approved, she indicated she would
resume making monthly payments of $700 and provided a receipt for a $700 payment
made in November 2022. (RE at 16.)
SOR ¶  1.j: automobile loan charged off for $14,324. Applicant acknowledged
she stopped making payments in March 2020 and had missed payments because of other
garnishments. (Item 11 at 7.) In her Response  she stated she had made regular $400
payments  and  a  $4,000  final  payment  to  resolve  the  debt.  (Response  at  15.)  She
submitted  a  letter  from  the  creditor  stating  the  debt  had  been  settled  in  full  as  of
September 19, 2022. This debt is resolved. (RE at 14.)
SOR  ¶   1.p:  medical  account  referred  for  collection  of  $62.  (Item  8  at  4-5.)
Applicant  states  this  debt  has  been  paid  but  provided  no  supporting  documentation.
(Answer at 4 and Response at 6.)
SOR  ¶   1.q:   credit-card  account  charged-off  for  $826.  Applicant  provided  a
February  1,  2022  letter  from  the  current  creditor  thanking  her  for  her  assistance  in
resolving the account. This debt is resolved. (AE at 29.)
Applicant is 54  years old. She  has been  married  since  2005  and  has one  child  and
three  adult step-children. She  earned  her master’s degree in 2006 and was awarded  her
doctorate  in  2014. She  has worked  as  a  federal contractor since  2013.  (Item  at 22,  28-
30,  12, 13, and 13-16.)
Applicant states  she  had  an  unscheduled  medical expense  of $8,501  in  October
2021. She  provided  her fee  agreement  for  proof of the  medical  expense  and  the  out-of-
pocket  cost to  her.  (RE at 18.) She  states that since  this medical expense  is resolved,
she  can  now  address the  remaining  debts.  She  specifically identified  her federal tax  debt
and  the delinquent student loans for resolution.  (Response  at 6.)
