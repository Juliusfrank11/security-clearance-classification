Applicant is a 59-year-old married man with four adult children, two of whom are
from a previous marriage. He is a veteran, serving in the inactive Army reserve from 1982
until  2002,  when  he  retired  honorably.  (GE  5  at  20)  Applicant’s  wife  is  also  a  military
veteran. (Item 6 at 17) After retirement, Applicant completed a bachelor’s degree in 2011.
(Item 5 at 13) He was married from 2006 to 2018.
Since retiring from the Army, Applicant has worked for a federal contractor as a
logistics  analyst.  Between  2006  and  2017,  he  worked  overseas,  supporting  the  U.S.
military in several combat zones. (Item 4 at 14-15) While overseas, he typically worked
12 hours per day for seven days per week. (Item 4 at 14-15)
In 2006, Applicant and his wife relocated to another state and purchased their first
home. After the move, his wife was unable to find another job. Consequently, the family
income  decreased  by  $50,000.  (Item  6  at  7)  The  move  also  created  unanticipated
challenges for their two children. Specifically, both are autistic and struggled to adjust to
the change. (Item 6 at 7) The problems with their children compelled Applicant’s wife to
stay home and support them. (Item 6 at 9) Consequently, the loss of her income and the
stress it created on the family evolved from a temporary problem to a persistent one. (Item
6 at 7)
By the time Applicant returned home between overseas assignments in May 2008,
his delinquent bills had increased to the point where he could not afford to satisfy them.
Consequently, he consulted an attorney who helped him file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy
protection, as alleged in subparagraph 1.b. (Item 6 at 7; Item 10) Approximately $81,000
was  included  in  the  payment  plan.  (Item  6  at  7-8)  By  November  2013,  Applicant  had
successfully completed the court-mandated payment plan, and the following month, the
case was discharged. (Item 10 at 5)
When working overseas, Applicant earned approximately $140,000 annually. (Item
6 at 16) In 2017, he did not pass a physical that his job required to enable its employees
to work overseas. (Item 6 at 16) His employer did not fire him; however, they transferred
him to a position at a U.S. location. This transfer resulted in an $80,000 annual pay cut
for Applicant. (Item 6 at 16)
Unable  to  adjust  to  this  pay  cut,  Applicant  fell  behind  on  his mortgage  in  2017.
(Item 6 at 16 - 17) He contacted the mortgage company who told him to apply for their
mortgage assistance program. (Item 6 at 16) Applicant applied but was not accepted into
the program.
In early 2019, the mortgage company moved to foreclose. In response, Applicant
contacted a bankruptcy attorney. The attorney advised him to file a motion for Chapter 13
bankruptcy protection. Applicant did as advised and filed the petition in February 2019. It
included the debts alleged in the SOR. (Item 9 at 25-26) As part of the requirements to
file the petition, Applicant completed credit counseling. (Item 9 at 11)
Per the bankruptcy plan, Applicant was supposed to pay $3,500 monthly. (Item 9
at 16) Initially, Applicant made the payments, as ordered. Then, his wife, who by then was
receiving disability payments through the Department of Veterans Affairs, experienced a
disability rating change, followed by a decrease in monthly pay. Then, one of his children
received a reduction in Supplemental Security Income benefits. Consequently, Applicant
was unable to make the monthly payments through the bankruptcy plan, and the court
dismissed the petition.  (Item 1 at 16)
As  for  the  unsecured  debts  that  were  included  in  the  bankruptcy,  Applicant  is
aware that the creditors could reach out to him to obtain payments since the petition has
been  dismissed,  but  he  suspects  that  these  debts  had  all  been  charged  off  his  credit
report. (Item 16 at 20) As of March 2021, these debts remained outstanding. ((Item 3 at
2-3)
As  for  the  mortgage,  Applicant  has  not  made  a  mortgage  payment  since  2017.
(Item 6 at 17) Applicant sought a refinance after the dismissal of the bankruptcy petition.
The  mortgage  company  denied  his  request.  (Item  6  at  17)  However,  the  mortgage
company,  in  late  July  2019,  allowed  Applicant  to  participate  in  a  financial  hardship
forbearance plan. (Item 6 at 17) During the forbearance period, Applicant did not have to
make any payments.
The mortgage has been out of forbearance since August 2021. (Item 6 at 17) The
current mortgage delinquency totals $97,977. (Item 3 at 3) Since the forbearance expired,
the  mortgage  company  refuses  to  accept  partial  payments  towards  satisfaction  of  the
delinquency. Although  the  home’s value  is worth  approximately $38,000  more than  he
owes, Applicant has no plans to sell the home, or otherwise resolve the mortgage. (Item
6 at 18)
Applicant  maintains  a  budget.  He  has  $10,000  deposited  in  a  savings  account,
approximately  $3,100  invested  in  a  retirement  account,  and  he  has  $2,127  in  after-
expense monthly income. (Item 9 at 18)
Applicant  completed  a  security  clearance  application  in  April  2018.  He  did  not
disclose any delinquent debs, as required, in response to Section 26 of the application.
(Item  5  at  35-36)  During  an  interview  a  few  months  later,  in  October  2018,  Applicant
disclosed his delinquent debt to the investigative agent after being confronted about it,
and attributed his failure to include his delinquent debt on the application to unintentional
oversight. (Item 6 at 12-13)
Applicant  completed  a  security  clearance  application  in  November  2020.  He
disclosed all pertinent financial information about his financial  problems, as required in
response to Section 26, and stated in response to a request to provide steps that he was
taking to resolve his financial problems, that he was “working on the situation.” (Item 4 at
36)
The SOR alleges that Applicant falsified material facts during a 2009 interview with
an  authorized  DOD  investigator  when  he  denied  having  any  derogatory  financial
information  or  accounts.  Per  the  agent’s  summary  of  the  interview,  Applicant  “was
confronted with derogatory financial information as directed under special interview [and]
he provided the following explanation.” (Item 6 at 7) Applicant proceeded to discuss his
financial difficulties in depth, identifying multiple debts that were included in a bankruptcy
that he had filed.
The  SOR alleges that Applicant failed to  report to  his company’s facility security
officer that he was experiencing financial hardship. In support thereof, the Government
submitted a continuous evaluation report, dated April 2020, disclosing several delinquent
debts and noting that Applicant did not self-report them. (Item 12)
