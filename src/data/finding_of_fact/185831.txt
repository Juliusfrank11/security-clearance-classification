Applicant admitted to the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c.~1.i. and 1.k. She denied
SOR  allegations  ¶¶  1.b.,  1.j.  and  1.l.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  38-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  She  has  been
employed  with  the  defense  contractor  since  March  2019.  Applicant  is  separated  from
her spouse, and has one child, age 13. (GX 1 at pages 7, 12 and 21~23.) She attributes
much  of  her  financial  difficulties  to  a  bad  home  environment  that  cause  her  to  leave
home, and resulted in periods of unemployment. (TR at page 39 line 20 to page 40 line
10.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
1.a.,   1.d.~1.f.,   1.h   and   1.k.  Applicant  admits  to  outstanding  student  loans  to
college  #1  totaling  about  $18,668.  She  has  recently,  on  October  11,  2022,  submitted
documentation  seeking  “loan  rehabilitation.”  (AppX  A,  and  TR  at  page  42  lines  2~7.)
Applicant attended this college more than a decade ago. (GX 1 at page 12.)  Her action
is too little, too late. These allegations are found against Applicant.
1.b. Applicant denies that she has a past-due debt to Creditor B in the amount of
about $4,350. (TR at page 16 line 11 to page 21 line 15.) As this debt appears as past-
due  on  the  Government’s  May  2022  credit  report,  this  allegation  is  found  against
Applicant.
1.c.  and  1.g.  Applicant admits to outstanding student loans to college #2 totaling
about  $5,940.  (TR  at  page  41  line  20  to  page  42  line  1.)  She  has  submitted  nothing
further in this regard, these allegations are found against Applicant.
1.j.  and   1.l.  Applicant  denies  that  she  has  past-due  debts  to  Creditor  J  in  the
amount  of  about  $970.  As  these  alleged  past-due  debts  do  not  appear  on  the
Government’s May 2022 credit report, these allegations are found for Applicant.
