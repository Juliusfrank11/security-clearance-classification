S)  Applicant  married  in  September 1987. His wife  is not  employed  outside  the home.  He
and  his  wife  have  one  adult  daughter,  who  is attending  college.  They are  providing  their

Financial Considerations
Applicant’s SOR lists 16 allegations, one of which is for delinquent taxes owed to
the  Federal  Government  for  tax  years  2015  through  2017,  and  the  remaining  15
allegations are for various delinquent consumer and medical debts. The allegations are
established by his October 19, 2020 SF-86; his Office of Personnel Management (OPM)
investigation containing his November 24, 2020 and January 27, 2021 Personal Subject
Interviews (OPM PSI); his November 17, 2020, September 9, 2021, and March 31, 2022
credit reports; his September 27, 2021 SOR Answer in part; and his hearing testimony.
(GE 1-5; SOR Answer)
Applicant’s financial difficulties resulted from a series of events largely beyond his
control. In 2014, his father passed  away,  and  he  had  to pay for  the  funeral expenses.
After dealing with the loss of his father, as Applicant described it, “we went through a very
terrible 2015. I got very, very sick. My wife was having bleeding. It was a bad year – sorry.”
Applicant’s kidneys  failed, and he was unable to determine the cause. Additionally, he
was having indigestion and heart problems. During that year, he had “multiple emergency
room visits.” It was determined that he had kidney and gallbladder problems and he only
had catastrophic medical coverage. For the most part, his hospital visits were not covered
by insurance. (SOR Answer; Tr. 26-28, 20, 33, 81-82; AE O)
Also  in  2015,  Applicant’s  wife  was  experiencing  severe  medical  problems
requiring  surgery  and  numerous  consultations  with  specialists.  When  surgery  failed  to
correct her problem, she consulted  additional specialists. Applicant’s wife  likewise  only
had catastrophic medical coverage. Her condition continued until the “tail end of 2016.”
(SOR Answer; Tr. 28-29, 33, 45-46; AE P)
While  Applicant  and  his  wife  were  experiencing  these  medical  problems,  their
daughter was being treated for Metabolic Syndrome and was taking multiple medications,
including  Metformin  used  to  treat  pre-diabetes.  (SOR  Answer;  AE  O  –  AE  Q)  Her
treatment  included  consulting  dieticians,  which  was  also  not  covered  by  Applicant’s
catastrophic medical coverage plan. (Tr. 29-30, 33; AE Q)
To compound matters even more, Applicant was caught up in the aftermath of the
2008  housing  crisis.  He  had  a  reverse  amortization mortgage  on the  family  home  that
caused  his  mortgage  payments  to  increase  “significantly”  by  “more  than  a  thousand
dollars  a  month.”  Applicant  was  and  is  the  sole  income  earner  for  the  family.  (SOR
Answer;  Tr.  30,  50)  Applicant  also  had  an  unexpected  water  leak  in  his  home  that
increased  his water bill  far beyond  the  norm.  He  had  to  prioritize  fixing  the  water leak
instead of paying the lease on his car. Applicant and his wife were forced to liquidate their
retirement  savings  to  pay  off  past-due  bills  that  accumulated  during  their  unexpected
health issues. This created a larger tax bill, given the IRS penalties for early withdrawal
of retirement savings. Consequently, Applicant was unable to remain current on his debts.
(SOR Answer)
Applicant submitted the following summary of documented medical expenses  in
2015 for himself, his wife, and his daughter. [Note – the following figures are totals vice
the breakdown Applicant provided in his exhibit.] Applicant’s medical expenses - $61,000,
wife’s  medical  expenses  - $104,000,  daughter’s  medical  expenses  - $18,000.  Total
medical expenses documented - $183,000. Applicant noted that his catastrophic medical
coverage has an $8,000 deductible  that covered 80% of medical expenses in network
and 60% of medical expenses out of network until out-of-pocket maximum of $20,000.
This  did  not  include  uncovered  medical  expenses  not  in  his  plan  such  as  fertility.  He
estimated that his out-of-pocket medical expenses in 2015 were “closer” to $30,000. (Tr.
31,  46-49;  AE  DDD)  Applicant  paid  the  $30,000  out  of  pocket  expenses  with  “various
loans, cash, out of pocket, and then some things [he] couldn’t cover . . . are still on [his]
credit report.” Applicant stated that once his credit was  destroyed, he  “couldn’t recover
from it.” (Tr. 49)
The following is a summary of Applicant’s SOR allegations and their status:
SOR ¶  1.a  –   Indebted  to  the  Federal Government  for delinquent  taxes  in the
amount   of   $55,000   for  tax   years  2015   through   2017.  In his SOR Answer,  Applicant
admitted this allegation with clarification. Applicant retained a second CPA in September
2019 to assist him with his tax debt, after the first tax accountant that he hired in 2017
was unable to make satisfactory progress. His CPA provided a letter dated October 4,
2021,  that  outlines a plan  to  resolve Applicant’s  tax debt.  He accrued  a  significant  tax
debt as a result of miscalculating his past withholdings. With the help of his CPA, he has
since  adjusted  his  withholdings.  His  CPA  stated  among  other  things  that  the  IRS
resolution group had completely shut down for nearly 12 months due to COVID-19 and
had an enormous backlog of cases to work through.  Applicant has been in a payment
plan with the IRS in various formats since 2017. Currently, he is on an approved monthly
payment plan of $1,000 per month payable to the IRS. In 2023, that amount will increase
to $1,800 a month, and in 2024, that amount will increase to $2,500. (SOR Answer; Tr.
