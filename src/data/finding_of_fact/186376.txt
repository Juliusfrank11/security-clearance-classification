Tr. at 7, 18-26, 115-118, 124-125; GE 1; AE M, N, P, Q, R, S, T, AA)
The SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file, as required, his federal income tax
returns for tax years (TY) 2014 through 2020, and that his federal income tax returns for
TY 2016, 2017, and 2020 remained unfiled as of the date of the SOR. (SOR ¶ 1.a) It also
alleged  that  he  was  indebted  to  the  federal  government  for  delinquent  taxes  in  the
amounts of $16,000 and $14,000 for TY 2014 and 2015, respectively. (SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.c)
It also alleged that he failed to file, as required, his state income tax returns for TY 2014
through  2020,  and  that  his  state  income  tax  returns  for  TY  2016  and  2020  remained
unfiled as of the date of the SOR. (SOR ¶ 1.d) It also alleged that he was indebted to the
state tax authority for delinquent taxes in the amounts of $3,973 and $3,000 for TY 2014
and  2015,  respectively.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.e-1.f)  The  SOR  allegations  are  established  by
Applicant’s  admissions  in  his  Answer,  his  August  2019  security  clearance  application
(SCA), his October 2019 background interview, and his December 2020 and July 2021
responses to interrogatories. (Answer; GE 1-3; AE A, B)
Applicant disclosed on his 2019 SCA and during his 2019 background interview
that he did not file and pay, as required, his federal and state income tax return for TY
2015; he did not file, as required, his federal and state income tax returns for TY 2016
and 2017; and he owed $20,000 in federal and state taxes for TY 2015, 2016, and 2017.
In his December 2020 response to interrogatories, he indicated that he made payment
arrangements to resolve his outstanding federal and state taxes, and he was paying his
outstanding state taxes. In his July 2021 response to interrogatories, he indicated that he
mailed his federal and state income tax returns for TY 2018 and 2019 in September 2020.
He  provided  a  copy  of  a  September  2020  U.S.  Postal  Service  certified  mail  receipt
addressed to the IRS. He indicated that his federal income tax returns for TY 2014 through
2017 and 2020 were prepared or were in the process of being prepared, and he expected
to mail them in July 2021. He indicated that in July 2021, he mailed his state income tax
returns  for  TY  2014,  2015,  and  2020,  and  he  anticipated  mailing  his  state  income  tax
returns for TY 2016 and 2017. (Tr. at 105-108, 111-113; GE 1-3)
Applicant  estimated, in  his July 2021  response  to  interrogatories,  that  he: (1)  owed
federal  taxes  in  the  amounts  of $16,000  and  $14,000,  respectively,  for TY 2014  and  2015;
(2) anticipated  a federal refund  of $13,000  for TY 2017, and  credits  of  $7,837  and  $1,862,
respectively,  for TY  2018  and  2019;  and  (3) owed  $7,500  in  federal taxes  after his federal
refund  and  overpayments from  TY 2017, 2018, and  2019  were  applied  to  his outstanding
federal  taxes.  Having  not  yet filed  his federal  income  tax returns for TY 2016  and  2020,
he expected  to  owe  federal taxes for TY  2016,  and  he  anticipated  a federal refund  for  TY
2020. He estimated  that he  owed  state  taxes of $3,973, $3,000,  and  $4,000, respectively,
for TY 2014, 2015, and  2016. He also estimated  that he  was due  state  refunds of $3,000,
$3,150, $2,644, and  $1,600, respectively, for TY  2017  through  2020. (Tr. at 105-108, 111-
113; GE  1-3)
Applicant attributed his failure to timely file his federal and state income tax returns
for TY 2014 through 2020 and his outstanding federal and state taxes, to problems with
his marriage from the onset; his spouse’s overspending and his lack of visibility into her
finances due to her unwillingness to combine finances; his spouse’s health issues related
to the births of their children; the financial strain of having four children and purchasing a
home; his periods of unemployment and self-employment; becoming the breadwinner in
early 2018, when his spouse became a stay-at-home mother; his health issues; and the
COVID-19 pandemic. Applicant described the first seven and a half years of his marriage
as toxic. He found himself in a state of constant chaos and conflict, in which his spouse
subjected him to mental, verbal, and emotional abuse. At times, she threatened to take
their  children  and  file  divorce,  and  she  reported  him  to  law  enforcement  on  several
occasions after they argued. The stress from his marriage impacted his health. He found
it difficult to function and was unable to focus on addressing his tax situation. When he
attempted  to  talk  to  his  spouse  about  filing  their  income  tax  returns,  she  was  non-
cooperative. (Tr. at 26-36, 51-53, 55-72, 77-81, 84-98, 117-124; GE 1, 3; AE QQ)
Applicant testified that his spouse initially led the effort to resolve their tax situation
and  reached  out  to  a  certified  public  accountant  for  assistance  with  preparing  their
relevant income tax returns. When her efforts did not materialize, he sought help from an
accounting firm in 2016.  He testified that the accounting firm helped them file their income
tax  returns  for  TY  2013  and  2014,  but  then  was  unhelpful  with  filing  their  income  tax
returns for TY 2015, 2016, and 2017 and was non-responsive to his emails beginning in
June 2017. He hired another accounting firm in August 2017. He  testified that this firm
told him it was going to cost him a significant amount of money for the firm to file  his
income tax returns, and the firm ultimately did not take the work despite his willingness to
pay. In May 2018, he hired a tax resolution company. The company notified him in June
2018 that it contacted the IRS and was ready to begin the process of preparing his income
tax  returns  for  TY  2014  through  2017.  It  also  notified  him  that  he  had  an  $8,383
outstanding federal tax liability on a filed return for TY 2013. It requested that he provide
them with additional information that month. He testified that after he paid the company’s
$2,000 retainer fee, the company ultimately wanted him to complete the tax forms so that
the company could simply file them. He did not complete the tax forms and the company
never filed his income tax returns. (Answer; Tr. at 73-75, 85, 93-98, 113-116, 120-124,
129-135; GE 1, 3; AE C, D, E, F)
IRS  tax  account  transcripts  from  July  2021  and  November  2021  reflect  that
Applicant filed his federal income tax return for TY 2018 in March 2021. He had a zero
balance for that tax year. The transcripts reflect that he had not filed his federal income
tax returns for TY 2014 through 2017, 2019, and 2020.  Applicant testified that he was
unsure why the IRS had not received his federal income tax return for TY 2019, since he
mailed it in March 2021 along with his federal income tax return for TY 2018, and that he
mailed it again in July 2022. (Tr. at 72-73, 75-76, 81-84, 98-106, 124-133; GE 3; AE H,
DD-PP)
In July 2021, Applicant made a $950 payment to the state tax authority. He testified
that  he  believed  this  was  his  final  payment  to  resolve  his  outstanding  state  taxes.  He
could not recall for which tax year(s) this payment pertained. He testified that he should
no  longer  owe  any  state  taxes.  A  February  2022  court  record  reflects  that  Applicant
satisfied a notice of state tax lien judgment entered against him in June 2019 for $2,779.
He also could not recall for which tax year(s) the lien pertained, but he believed it was for
his outstanding state taxes. He learned about the lien when he refinanced his home, and
he resolved it through his home’s  refinancing process. (Answer; Tr. at 76-77, 105-111,
127; AE G, CC)
Applicant eventually used tax software to complete his federal and state income
tax  returns  for  TY  2012  through  2021  himself.  He  was  required  to  file  his  income  tax
returns  by  mail  rather than  electronically,  given  their  untimeliness.  He  testified  that  he
mailed his federal and state income tax returns for TY 2014 to 2021, and he provided a
copy of a September 2022 FedEx receipt addressed to the IRS. He testified that he was
unaware  whether  his  April  2022  request  for  an  extension  to  file  his  federal  and  state
income  tax  returns  for TY  2021  was  granted,  and he  agreed  that he  untimely  filed  his
federal and state income tax returns for that tax year when he mailed them in September
2022. (Answer; Tr. at 72-73, 75-77, 81-84, 98-106, 124-133; AE DD-PP)
Applicant’s completed tax documentation reflects that he was due federal refunds
of $4,367, $9,604, $7,837, $1,862, $2,795, and $4,555, for a total of $31,020, for TY 2012
and 2017 through 2021,  respectively. It also reflects that he owed federal taxes in  the
amounts of $5,679, $13,597, $12,357, and $8,377, for a total of $40,010,  for TY 2013
through 2016, respectively. In November 2021, he made a payment of $1,811 to the IRS
for his outstanding federal taxes for TY 2013. He anticipated that his refunds would offset
any outstanding federal taxes once his federal income tax returns were processed. His
completed tax documentation also reflects that he was due state refunds of $717, $3,800,
$3,150, $2,644, $360, and $2,940, for a total of $13,611, for TY 2012 and 2017 through
2021,  respectively.  It  also  reflects  that  he  owed  state  taxes  in  the  amounts  of  $1,592,
$4,174,  $2,661,  and  $1,704,  for  a  total  of  $10,131,  for  TY  2013  through  2016,
respectively. (Answer; Tr. at 72-73, 75-77, 81-84, 98-106, 124-133; AE DD-PP)
Applicant’s annual salary was $211,328 as of October 2021. His November 2021
budget reflects a monthly net income of $10,600 and a monthly net remainder of $3,591
after  expenses.  It  also  reflects  assets  totaling  $811,000.  He  testified  that  he  and  his
spouse  continued  to  maintain  separate  finances.  His  2021  credit  reports  reflect  a  fair
credit score with only a few minimal delinquent debts. He was current on his mortgage.
He testified that he takes his finances seriously, and he is resolved to remain prudent to
avoid  similar situations  in  future.  He  indicated  during  his background  interview that  he
received financial counseling from the tax company in 2018. (Tr. at 77-81, 116-117, 124;
GE 2, 3; AE I, J, K, L)
Two individuals testified on Applicant’s behalf. One was his best friend of almost
30 years, and the other was a friend of 20 years. The former, who described Applicant as
frugal, learned about Applicant’s spouse’s overspending habits while Applicant was self-
employed. Both described Applicant as dedicated, loyal, and determined, a man of faith,
trustworthy  and  reliable.  Applicant  provided  letters  of  support  from  four  individuals
attesting  to  his  trustworthiness,  reliability,  and  judgment.  He  received  favorable  input
regarding  his  work  performance  from  2020  to  2021.  He  is  actively  involved  in  his
profession and community. (Tr. at 36-53; AE O, U, V, W, X, Y, Z, AA, QQ)
