Applicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since May 2021. He served on active duty in the U.S. military from
2000  until  he  was  honorably  discharged  in  December  2014.  He  seeks  to  retain  a
security clearance, which he has held since about 2018. He has college credits, but he
has not earned a degree. He married in 2002 and divorced in 2012. He married again in
2012  and  divorced  in  2016.  He  married  for  the  third  time  in  2018.  He  is  separated,
pending  a  divorce.  He  has  two  children,  ages  19  and  17,  and  three  teenage
stepchildren. (Tr. at 14, 17-21, 24, 28-29, 33; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1)
The  SOR  alleges  18  delinquent  debts  totaling  about  $48,000.  The  debts  are
listed  on  a  November  2020  credit  report,  a  June  2021  credit  report,  or  both  credit
reports. The debts include a credit card (SOR ¶ 1.a - $11,342), the deficiency owed on
an  auto  loan  after  the  vehicle  was  repossessed  (1.b  - $12,737),  child  support
arrearages (1.c - $10,608), payday loans (1.e - $3,371 and 1.i - $1,514), eight medical
debts  totaling  $2,527  (SOR  ¶¶  1.k-1.r),  and  five  miscellaneous  debts  totaling  $6,285
(SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.j)
Applicant  made  multiple  deployments  while  he  was  in  the  military,  and  he  was
stationed in a  foreign country from 2009 to 2012.  His  first wife  apparently remained  in
the  United  States  and  was  responsible  for  paying  the  bills.  She  did  not  pay  all  of  the
bills. He was denied a security clearance for a government agency in about 2014 “due
to income vs debt.” (Tr. at 19-21; GE 1)
Applicant worked for a defense contractor from January 2015 until he was laid off
in March 2021. He was unemployed until he started his current job in late May 2021. His
prior  job  required  him  to  periodically  work  overseas.  He  worked  in  Afghanistan  from
February 2020 through January 2021. When he was not overseas, he spent a lot of time
away from home for work. He asserted that most of the SOR debts accumulated when
he was overseas or working in the United States away from home, and his wife was in
charge of handling the finances.  He gave her a  power of attorney. He  did not find out
until he returned from Afghanistan that she did not pay all of their bills, his vehicle was
repossessed,  and  she  opened  accounts  without  his  knowledge.  (Tr.  at  14,  22-23,  41;

Applicant  contracted  with  a  debt-settlement company in  about November  2021  to
assist  him   in  resolving   his  debts.   He  enrolled   13   debts,   totaling   $45,890,  in  the
company’s  debt-resolution  program  (DRP). The  program  began  on  December 2,  2021.
The  enrolled  debts included  the  debts  alleged  in SOR ¶¶  1.a  ($11,342), 1.b  ($12,737),
1.d   ($1,062),  1.e   ($3,371),  1.f   ($2,621),  1.g   ($1,221), 1.h   ($1,079), 1.n   ($688), and   1.r
($643).   The   SOR   debts  not   included   in   the   DRP   are   1.c   ($10,608),  1.i   ($1,514),  1.j
($302), and six medical debts.  The plan also included four debts that were not alleged in
the   SOR   for   $1,032   for  a   pool  service   company;   $847   for  a   cable   services   provider;
$7,432  to  a  bank;  and  $1,963  to  another  bank.  (Tr. at  38,  47;  Applicant’s  response  to
SOR; AE A-C)
Applicant  agreed  to  make  $282  payments  every  two  weeks  to  an  escrow
account.  The  debt-settlement  company  agreed  to  negotiate  settlements  with  his
creditors and use the accumulated funds in the escrow account, minus their fees, to pay
the settlements. The company estimated a payoff amount of $27,045, with an estimated
debt-free  date  of  August  2025.  As  of  the  last  statement  in  September 2022,  Applicant
had deposited $5,027 into the DRP, and the balance in the escrow account was $448.
(Tr. at 47; Applicant’s response to SOR; AE A-C)
The debt alleged in 1.h ($1,079) has been settled for $541 and paid. The debts
alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a ($11,342), 1.d ($1,062), and 1.f ($2,621) have been settled, and
payments are being made to those creditors. The DRP statement shows a total of $220
paid  to  those  three  creditors.  Based  upon  the  $5,027  Applicant  paid  into  the  DRP,
payments  to  creditors  totaling  $761,  and  the  balance  of  $448,  it  appears  the  debt
settlement company takes their settlement fees before paying the creditors. (AE A, B)
The  $11,342  delinquent  credit  card  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.a  was  listed  on  a
March  2018  credit  report  as  current  with  a  $14,593  balance.  It  was  listed  on  the
February  2020  credit  report  as  charged  off  with  a  $14,392  balance.  The  June  2021
credit report listed that the debt was charged off for $15,216, with the first delinquency
in May 2018. A payment of $150 was made in April 2021, and the balance was $11,342.
Applicant stated that he was paying this debt outside the DRP. The DRP reported the
balance of the debt when it was settled was $10,642. Applicant’s statement that he was
paying this debt is accepted because the balance went down on the credit reports. The
debt  has  been  settled  through  the  DRP  for  $6,831,  which  includes  the  settlement
amount  and  the  debt  settlement  company’s  fees.  The  documents  do  not  include  a
breakdown  of  the  settlement  amount  and  the  fees.  It  is  unclear  how  much  has  been
paid to the debt settlement company, but only $50 has been paid to the creditor. (Tr. at
35-37; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-4; AE A-C)
Applicant bought a vehicle in about November 2017 and financed it with a loan of
more than $33,000, through 72 monthly  payments  of  $761. It  was listed on the  March
2018 credit report as current with a $33,451 balance. It was listed on the February 2020
and June 2021 credit reports as charged off with a $12,737 balance (SOR ¶ 1.b). The
date  of  first  delinquency  was  December  2019,  and  the  date  of  last  payment  was  July
2020. The debt is in the DRP. (Tr. at 37-38; Applicant’s response to  SOR; GE 2-4; AE
A, B)
The  June  2021  credit  report  listed  a  child  support  debt  to  a  state  that  was
$10,608 past due (SOR ¶ 1.c) with a balance of $11,767. The date of first delinquency
was May 2020, and the date of last payment was June 2021. Applicant stated that his
employer  stopped  the  court-ordered  deduction  from  his  pay  while  he  was  in
Afghanistan. He stated that he realized in June 2020 that the deduction stopped, and he
started sending money to the Department of Child Support Services and his ex-wife. He
stated that deductions for his child support have been taken out of his pay  consistently
since  June  2021,  and  that  the  arrearages  have  been  paid.  He  did  not  submit  any
documentation  supporting  his assertions.  (Tr. at  25-27,  30-32;  Applicant’s  response  to
SOR; GE 4)
The $1,062 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d was listed on the March 2018 credit report
as $239 past due with a balance of $1,107, and the last activity in December 2017. It is
reported  on  the  two  later  credit  reports  with  a  balance  of  $1,062.  The  date  a  major
delinquency was first reported was August 2018. Applicant stated that the account was
up to date and deactivated before he left for Afghanistan. His wife activated the account,
made  purchases,  and  then  did  not  pay  the  account.  He  acknowledged  at  the  hearing
that  he  could  have  been  mistaken  about  when  the  debt  became  delinquent.  The  debt
has  been settled  through  the  DRP  for $724, which  includes  fees.  Payments are  being
made  to  the  creditor, with  $120  paid  as  of  September  2022.  (Tr. at  38-39;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 2-4; AE A, B)
Applicant  asserted  that  his  wife  used  the  power  of  attorney  to  take  out  the
payday  loans  (1.e  - $3,371  and  1.l  - $1,514).  However,  credit  reports  indicate  the
$3,371 debt was opened in August 2018 and the $1,514 debt was opened in November
2019. At the hearing he clarified that he gave his wife a power of attorney in 2018, and
his  wife  opened  the  accounts  without  his  knowledge  while  he  was  working  on
assignment away from home. He testified that both debts are in the DRP.  The $3,371
debt is in the DRP, but the $1,514 debt is not. He stated that the company does not list
the debt until it begins negotiations with the creditor. That statement does not appear to
be accurate. (Tr. at 39-43; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-4; AE A, B)
The  March  2018  credit  report  listed  the  $2,621  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.f  as
becoming delinquent in  June 2017. It is listed with the same balance on the two more
recent credit reports. Applicant stated that he was assigned responsibility for this debt in
his  2016  divorce.  He  enrolled  the  debt  in  a  debt  consolidation  program  (apparently  a
different  program  than  the  current  DRP),  but  his  wife  removed  the  debt  from  the
program  while he was in  Afghanistan.  The debt has been settled through  the  DRP for
$1,656, which includes fees. As of September 2022, $50 has been paid to the creditor.
(Tr. at 42-43; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-4; AE A, B)
Applicant  asserted  that  his  wife  used  the  power  of  attorney  to  open  a  utility
account in his name, and then did not pay the debt (SOR ¶ 1.g - $1,221). Credit reports
indicate that the account was opened during the period he was in Afghanistan. The debt
is in the DRP. (Tr. at 44-45; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-4; AE A, B)
Applicant stated that he was assigned  responsibility for the $1,079 (SOR ¶ 1.h)
debt in his 2016 divorce. He enrolled the debt in a debt consolidation program, but his
wife  removed  the  debt  from  the  program  while  he  was  in  Afghanistan.  The  debt  has
been  settled  for  $789,  including  fees,  and  paid.  About  $248  was  paid  to  the  debt
settlement  company  for  their  fees,  and  $541  was  paid  to  the  creditor.  (Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 2-4; AE A, B)
The June 2021 credit report listed SOR ¶ 1.j debt as $302 past due, with a $343
balance. Applicant asserted, without supporting documentation, that the debt is in good
standing. The debt is not in the DRP. (Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 4)
Applicant stated that the six medical debts were accrued by his wife for medical
services for herself, his children, or his stepchildren. The credit reports and SOR do not
name a creditor, they are only identified as “medical” or “medical health care.” He stated
that he paid three of the debts. Medical debts of $688 and $643 are in the DRP. (Tr. at
45-46; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3, 4; AE A, B)
Applicant stated that he learned valuable lessons from his financial dealings with
his  wives.  He  and  his  wife  separated  after  he  returned  from  Afghanistan,  and  he
cancelled  the  power  of  attorney.  He  is  managing  his  finances,  and  he  maintains  a
budget and spreadsheets to keep himself on track. He has an accountant to assist him.
He  earns  about  $105,000  annually,  and  he  receives  disability  pay  of  about  $1,200  a
month  from  the  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  (VA).  He  stated  that  he  intends  to
continue  with  the  DRP  until  his debts  are  paid.  He  anticipates  finishing  the  DRP  early
and buying a home. (Tr. at 15, 22, 27-29, 48-52; Applicant’s response to SOR)
