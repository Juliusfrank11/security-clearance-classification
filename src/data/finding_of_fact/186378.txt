Applicant is 29 years old. He has never been married and he does not have any
children. He earned an associate degree in 2014, and two bachelor’s  degrees in 2016
and 2019. Since August 2020, he has worked for a government contractor as a software
engineer. This is his first application for a DOD security clearance. (Item 3)
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
The SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant had used marijuana from 2010
to  June  2020,  and  that  he  sold  marijuana  in  2014.  It  also  alleged  he  used  psilocybin
mushrooms from 2014 to  February 2020, and that he sold psilocybin mushrooms from
July 2017 to May 2019 (on two or three occasions, and no more than six ounces on each
occasion).  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b,  1.h,  and  1.j.)  It  also  alleges  he  used  LSD  (on  three
occasions)  from  2016  to  2017,  and  he  used  cocaine  (on  two  occasions)  in  November
2016  and  February  2019.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.c  and  1.d.)  The  SOR  also  alleges  that  he  used
medications  not  prescribed  to  him,  such  as  Hydrocodone  (once)  in  July  2015,  and
Adderall (about ten times) from December 2013 to November 2015. (SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f.)
Also  alleged  is  that  in  April  2012,  he  was  charged  with  possession  of  marijuana  and
possession  of  paraphernalia.  (SOR  ¶  1.g.)  It  is  alleged  that  in  August  2016,  he  was
charged with felony possession of a controlled substance, and that he was convicted of
three  misdemeanors  –  possession  of  marijuana,  possession  of  paraphernalia,  and
ingestion  of  an  intoxicant other than alcohol.  (SOR  ¶ 1.i.) Applicant  admitted all of the
allegations, with detailed explanations in his Answer to the SOR. (Item 1; Item 2)
Applicant  stated  that  his  illegal  drug  use,  which  was  generally  sporadic  and
recreational, occurred mainly during his high school and college years. In his Answer, he
listed  that  he  is  remorseful  for  his  past  illegal  drug  use.  He  also  believed  a  significant
amount of time had passed since he last used any illegal drug, which was marijuana in
June 2020. He explained that he is more mature and has consistently demonstrated good
judgment in his career as a software engineer. He no longer associates with friends who
use illegal drugs. (Item 2)
Applicant  was  in  high  school  when  he  was  charged  in  2012  with  possession  of
marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia. He was not convicted of these charges.
He abstained from using marijuana for about two years after this incident. In August 2016,
Applicant, the driver of the car, and two other passengers were pulled over by the police
for speeding. All four occupants were arrested for possession of a controlled substance,
(hashish brownies), a felony, less than two ounces of marijuana, ingestion of intoxicant,
other than alcohol, and drug paraphernalia (bong and pipe with residue). Applicant was
22 years-old at the time of this arrest. He pleaded guilty to three misdemeanor offenses.
(Item 2 Exhibits D and E, Item 3, Item 4)
In  May  2021,  Applicant  participated  in  a  drug  abuse  evaluation  and  submitted
documentation with his Answer. The record showed that he started smoking marijuana at
age 16, and he progressed to daily use of marijuana from approximately age 17 to 18.
After his 2016 offense, he smoked marijuana about two or three times a year until June
2020. He used Adderall without a prescription on about ten occasions during college to
help him study. He took psilocybin mushrooms five to ten times, and LSD three times. He
ingested unprescribed Hydrocodone one time. The counselor found Applicant to be very
credible and noted  that  he  fit the criteria  for cannabis  use disorder,  mild, in remission.
Applicant is considered to be in a low-risk category. (Item 2 Exhibit E)
Applicant was completely candid about his illegal drug use and drug-related arrests
on his August 2020 SCA. He understands marijuana use is against federal law, and it is
unacceptable for individuals possessing DOD security clearances  to smoke marijuana,
even if the state law makes it legal to do so. He signed a letter of intent declaring that that
he had no intention of using any illegal drug in the future. (Item 2, Item 3)
