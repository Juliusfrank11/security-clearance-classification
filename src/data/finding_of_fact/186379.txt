Applicant  is  a  42-year-old  civilian  of  a  defense  contractor  who  seeks  a  security
clearance.  Admitted  facts  are  adopted  and  incorporated  by  reference.  Additional
findings of fact follow.
Background
Applicant married in December 2016, separated in December 2019, and divorced
in November 2021. (GEs 1-2 and AE K; Tr. 24, 36, 48) She has two children from this
marriage: a daughter (age 5) and a son (age 18). (GE 1) She attended college classes
between  January  2010  and  May  2016,  but  did  not  earn  a  diploma  or  degree.  (GE  1)
Applicant reported no military service. (GE 1)
Since  March  2020,  Applicant  has been  employed  by  her current  employer  as  a
lobby  receptionist.  (GE  1;  Tr. 31). Between December 2017 and December 2019,  she
worked  for  her  husband’s  privately  owned  masonry  business:  initially  with  general
assistance  to  her  husband’s  business  and  later  (beginning  in  2018)  as  an  office
manager.  (GE  2;  Tr.  36-39)  Before  her  marriage,  she  was  employed  as  an  assistant
manager  for  a  dentist,  where  she  worked  for  over  12  years.  (GE  1;  Tr.  24)  She  has
never held a security clearance.
Applicant’s finances
Before her marriage in December 2016, Applicant enjoyed good credit and stable
finances. Following her marriage in December 2016, she began helping her husband in
his masonry business with cleaning and filing. (Tr. 36) By 2018, she had assumed other
company tasks and responsibilities, including keeping track of business purchases and
payouts  and  managing  the  company’s  payroll.  (Tr.  37-40)  During  her  tenure  with  her
husband’s company, she aided the company’s formal office manager and  was given a
company business card to facilitate her ability to sign company checks when the office
manager was unavailable. (Tr. 40) While Applicant never owned any proprietary interest
in her husband’s business, held any officer’s position in the business, or exercised any
control over the business, she and her husband presumably filed joint tax returns for tax
years 2017-2018. These tax returns could be expected to include reported income and
expenses from her husband’s business.
In  2019,  an  IRS  agent  visited  Applicant’s  work  site.  (Tr.  34)  During  one  of  the
agent’s  visits,  he  inquired  about  her  company’s  2018  tax  debt.  (Tr.  41)  Applicant
acknowledged  to  the  agent  her  understanding  that  her  husband  owed  money  on  his
company’s 2018 federal taxes. (Tr. 41) Asked why he owed business taxes, she told the
agent  she  did  not  know.  (Tr.  42)  While  Applicant’s  involvement  with  her  husband’s
business  in 2018  was very limited,  she  was listed  on the  company’s  signature  card.  It
was  her  listing  on  the  company’s  business  card  that  prompted  the  agent’s  questions
about her husband’s company and taxes owed. (Tr. 43)
In April 2019, the IRS filed a notice of federal tax lien against both Applicant and
her husband for federal taxes owed for tax year 2016 in the amount of $13,782. (GE 4;
Tr.  43)  For this tax  year,  Applicant  and her husband filed  separate  federal  income tax
returns  due  to  their  late  marriage  in  December  2016.  (Tr.  43)  Because  Applicant  had
nothing  to  do  with  her  husband’s  business  before  their  marriage,  she  denied  any
responsibility for the taxes owed for tax year 2016. (GE 4; Tr. 43-44) For further proof
that she does not personally owe any federal taxes for tax year 2016, she cited to the
Government’s  failure  to  file  any  proof  of  claim  in  her  January  2022  Chapter  7
bankruptcy petition.  (Tr. 45-46) To date, the IRS’s 2016 tax lien remains unsettled and
unresolved.
In  November  2019,  the  IRS  filed  a  notice  of  federal  tax  lien  against  Applicant
exclusively for federal taxes owed for tax year 2018 in the amount of $102,471. (GE 5
and  AE  A)  The  lien  covers  an  original  tax  assessment  of  $17,300,  along  with  added
assessments  throughout  the  2018  tax  year  for  accrued  penalties  and  interest.  (GE  5,
AE A, and HE 1)
While Applicant has made in-person inquiries to the IRS of why she owes taxes
for  her  husband’s  business,  she  has  not  to  date  received  any  substantive  assistance
from the IRS on how she can resolve this 2018 company tax debt. (Tr. 50-51) Even with
her  extra  jobs,  she  is  not  in  a  current  position  to  address  this  debt  without  help  from
either her ex-husband, her father-in-law (previous owner of her ex-husband’s business),
or both. (Tr. 29-30, 42, 53-55)
Applicant’s stated  intentions  are to  repay the  IRS  on  this 2018  tax debt, but she
needs a  manageable repayment plan  or compromise of the  debt with  the  IRS  to  do  so.
(Tr.  55)  Applicant  assured   she   will   continue   to   work  with   her   legal  counsel   and
accountant  to   achieve   a   compromise   of   the   tax  debt   that   she   can   safely manage.   (Tr.
56)  Afforded   a   post-hearing   opportunity   to   document  applications   to   the   IRS   for  either
an  installment agreement, abatement of penalties and  interest,  or compromise  of debt,
she has not provided any.
Applicant  has  continued  to  look  to  her  ex-husband  to  fulfill  his  accepted
responsibilities for federal taxes owed for tax years 2016 and 2018, both explicit under
the terms of their divorce decree and implicit by virtue of his 100% ownership interest in
his business. (AE A and  K; Tr. 25-28) Nothing in Applicant’s divorce decree, however,
binds the IRS to pursue her husband exclusively in its enforcement initiatives.
Because Applicant and her ex-husband filed joint federal tax returns for tax year
2018,  they  became  jointly  and  severally  liable  for  federal income  taxes  for 2018.  And,
the  IRS  federal  tax  lien  for  tax  year  2018  lists  only  Applicant  and  her  social  security
number  as  the  taxpayer  covered  by  the  IRS  tax  lien.  (GE  5  and  AEs  B  and  O)
Presumably,  the  IRS  filed  a  similar  tax  lien  against  Applicant’s  ex-husband  (using  her
husband’s social security number); although, this is not documented in the record. (GEs
5; Tr. 27-28) Whether the IRS ever pursued Applicant’s husband to enforce satisfaction
of its 2016 and 2018 tax liens is unclear.
Since  the  issuance  of  IRS  tax  liens  for  tax  years  2016  and  2018  in  November
2019 against Applicant (and presumably her husband as well), Applicant has taken no
documented  steps  to  address  her  reported  tax  liabilities  for  these  covered  tax  years,
despite the plethora of payment options available to her. Options available to her since
2019  include  applications  for  installment  agreement  relief  using  IRS  form  9465.
Required  information  in  this  request  form  includes  data  about  the  taxpayer’s  income
receipts and affordable monthly payments to facilitate IRS means testing.
Other  available  tax  relief  options  include  (a)  claims  for  refund  and  requests  for
abatement  using  IRS  form  843  and  (b)  offers  in  compromise  based  on  the  taxpayer’s
documented  ability  to  pay  (calculated  by  consideration  of  the  taxpayer’s  income  and
expenses  and  asset  equity).  Neither  these  latter  stated  options  nor  the  installment
agreement option were apparently availed of by Applicant or her tax accountants (either
before her hearing or post-hearing) to seek cancellation, or abatement, or compromise
of the covered assessments in issue. Whether Applicant’s ex-husband ever addressed
the taxes owed by his company for the tax years in issue is unclear.
This is not to minimize the financial hardships Applicant’s ex-husband has placed
on her and her children. Not only has her ex-husband left her with heavy tax debts that
rightfully belong to him, but he has failed to meet the child support obligations he agreed
to in his 2017 court-approved parenting plan. (AE L; Tr. 70-71) Nor has Applicant’s ex-
husband reportedly complied with court-ordered monthly child support payments ($445
a  month)  since  the  entry  of  the  child  support  order  in  November  2021.  (AE  I)  Asked
whether she had ever considered taking legal steps against her ex-husband to enforce
child support compliance, she replied that “I cannot find him.” (Tr. 71)
Essentially,  from   Applicant’s   accounts,   her  ex-husband   abandoned   her  and   her
children   and   left   her   to   fend   for  herself   in   raising   her  family  and   covering   her  ex-
husband’s tax obligations.  Considering  all  of  the  facts and  circumstances of Applicant’s
tax  and   family  difficulties,   her  claims   are  laden   with   equities   worthy  of   consideration
were  such  claims  to  be  evaluated  inter se  by a  court of  competent  jurisdiction  over the
marital disputants. Third  parties  like the  IRS, however,  fall  outside  of the  jurisdiction  and
authority  of  a   state   family  court  and   cannot be   bound   by  a   state   court’s   orders  arising
from  a marital dispute.
In  May  1992,  Applicant  petitioned  for  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  relief.  (AE  N)  She
scheduled  assets  of  $35,136  and  liabilities  of  $51,364.  Her  listed  liabilities  were
comprised  of  secured  claims  totaling  $27,741  and  unsecured  non-priority  claims  of
$23,364. (AE N) Applicant’s non-priority unsecured claims included SOR debts covered
by SOR ¶ 1.c (for $11,087) and SOR ¶ 1.d (for $27,741).
In  an  amended  Schedule  E  filing  in  May  2022,  Applicant  added  a  priority  IRS
2018  tax  debt  ($108,696)  to  her  scheduled  unsecured  creditors.  (AE  N)  The  IRS,  in
turn, filed a proof of claim in June 2022 in the amount of $93,504. (AE P) Whether this
reduced figure represents a calculated reduction of the tax amount covered by its 2019
tax lien against Applicant for tax year 2018 is unclear.
Applicant’s  listed  secured  and unsecured  claims  were discharged  in  bankruptcy
by order of the bankruptcy court in August 2022. (AE N) Dispositions of both the 2018
and 2016 tax liens remain pending and unresolved.
While both of the consumer debts listed in the  SOR (SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d) have
been discharged in bankruptcy and are no longer enforceable, Applicant still retains the
vehicle  covered  by  SOR  ¶¶  1.d.  (Tr.  66-68)  Although  the  discharged  creditor  has
continued  to  decline  taking  possession  of  the  vehicle,  Applicant’s  retention  of  the
vehicle (even without title to the vehicle) does not affect her bankruptcy discharge. (Tr.
68-70)
