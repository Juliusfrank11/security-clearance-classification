Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.d and 1.e. He denied the
allegation in SOR ¶ 1.c. I have incorporated his admissions into the findings of fact. After
a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 62 years old. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 1982 and a master’s
degree in 2017. He has a 40-year-old child from a relationship. He married in 1984 and
divorced in 2000. He has a 38-year-old child from the marriage. He remarried in 2004 and
has two adult stepchildren from the marriage, ages 39 and 32. He worked for a federal
contractor  from  June  2005  to  June  2014.  He  changed  jobs  and  worked  for  a  different
federal  contractor  from  June  2014  until  February  2018  when  he  was  terminated  from
employment.  He  was  unemployed  until  March  2019  when  he  began  working  for  his
present employer, also a federal contractor. He has held a top secret security clearance
since 2008. His wife is employed as a school teacher. (Transcript (Tr.) 20-24, 51; GE 1)
In March 2019, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) as part
of his reinvestigation. He disclosed that in February 2018 he was terminated from his job
with a federal contractor because he misused his corporate credit card for personal use.
During his hearing, he testified that in 2013, while working for the same employer, he had
misused his corporate credit card for personal use. He acknowledged that he was aware
of  the  prohibition  of  using  his corporate  credit  card  for personal use.  He  had  signed a
document about the proper use of corporate credit cards and was aware that using it for
personal reasons was in violation of the agreement. He received a written warning for the
2013 misuse. In 2018, he used the corporate credit card again for personal use. He was
terminated from employment for the second violation. He testified he was aware he was
not permitted to use the corporate credit card for personal use. Applicant explained that
on both occasions, he repaid the amount owed in a short period of time. (Tr. 52-56; GE
1, 3)
When Applicant was terminated from his job, he was entitled to a pension for the
years he had worked with the federal contractor. He chose to receive monthly payments,
and he also withdrew $50,000 from his 401k pension plan. He testified that an amount
from  the  pension  plan  was  used  to  pay  the  taxes  owed  for  the  early  withdrawal.  He
testified that he used the lump-sum to pay down his federal tax debt. (Tr. 29-30, 55-59)
In  his SCA, Applicant disclosed that he failed  to pay  his  2009 federal and  state
income taxes. He stated:
Upon relocation in 2014 from State A to State B, our federal tax debt was
under an installment agreement. Coupled with the relocation and my wife
not  working,  our  debt  grew.  We  always  kept  a  rapport  with  the  IRS  and
maintained an installment agreement to pay. (GE 1)
Applicant further stated regarding his current tax debt and years impacted, the following:
Federal (2009, 2011-2017); Adjusted  withholding  over the  years to  correct
the  problem  of  owing.  A  relocation  in 2014  affected  the  Federal taxes owed.
I am  currently in negotiations with  the  IRS  for an  Offer-in-Compromise  (OIC)
estimated  to  conclude June  4, 2019  (set  by IRS). Estimate: $100,062; OIC
TBD. [B]  state  (2015-2017); Also adjusted  withholdings to  avoid owing  each
year. Installment agreement in place  for $200  per month  until debt satisfied.
Estimate: $8,000. (GE 1)
Applicant testified that his OIC to the IRS was to settle the tax debt for $25,000. It
was rejected in June 2019. The SOR alleges Applicant’s income tax debt to the IRS at
the time of the SOR was $66,479 and to State B was $20,767. Applicant testified that he
currently owes the IRS $73,491 and he owes $22,502 to State B for delinquent income
taxes.  Post-hearing,  Applicant  provided  documents  from  the  IRS  showing  the  total
amount he owes for delinquent federal income taxes is $71,651 and state income taxes
is $22,352. (Tr. 24, 65-66; AE A, H)
Applicant testified that over the years he has had installment agreements with the
IRS  and  this  is  corroborated  by  his  income  tax  transcripts.  From  at  least  2012,  as
confirmed  by  tax  year  transcripts  for  tax  years  2011  through  2017,  an  installment
agreement would be repeatedly established, reflect it was pending, and then stopped and
removed.  During  these  years  penalties  and  interest  continued  to  accrue.  Applicant
testified that he was unaware that his installment agreement would be removed each new
tax year when he failed to pay his income taxes on time. (Tr. 29-30; GE 2)
Applicant disclosed in his SCA that in 2018 a federal tax lien was entered against
his residence for $57,000 and State B entered a tax lien for $5,744. He hired an attorney
to address the liens. He stated in his SCA the following: “The federal tax lien was  lifted
due to soliciting the help from an attorney which we paid for their services, plus we are in
negotiations with the IRS to settle our debt with an OIC.” He stated the reasons for his
tax  issues  were  because  his  move  from  State  A  to  State  B  was  more  costly  than
anticipated. His wife was unemployed from 2014 to 2017 and once she resumed working
in the summer of 2017 their finances improved. He also stated that withdrawing money
from  his  pension  plan  resulted  in  penalties  and  additional  federal  taxes  owed  which
caused financial hardships. (Tr. 45-47; GE 1)
Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator in May 2019. He told the
investigator that he always filed his income tax returns on time as required, but he owed
federal income taxes for tax years 2009 and 2011 through 2017 and to State B for tax
years  2015,  2016  and  2017.  He  explained  that  although  he  was  earning  a  substantial
income, he  was not having  enough  withheld  from  his paychecks,  and  he  and  his family
needed  the  money to  live. In  addition, his  wife  was unemployed  from  2014  to  the  summer
of 2017. He  also  admitted  that he  and  his  family were  spending  more money than  they
should have,  which  caused  his debts to  grow.  He withdrew some  money from  his pension
plan  to  pay for his stepdaughter’s college  tuition, which  had  tax  consequences. He said
he  would not have  been  able to  pay his living  expenses if he  had  paid  his yearly tax bills.
He said he  deliberately made  the  decision  to  not pay his tax  bills each  year  because  he
would not have  been  able to  cover his living  expenses. Instead,  he  contacted  the  IRS  and
State  B  to  negotiate  payment arrangements.  He  said,  that at the  time  of the  interview,
none  of  his tax  debts had  been  satisfied.  He  said he  was able to  make  an  arrangement
with  State  B  in  January  2019  to  pay $200  a  month  and  was in compliance. He  anticipated
that  his tax debts would be  resolved  within the  next five  years. He  said he  had  readjusted
his withholdings  and put his family on  a budget.  (Tr. 66-67;  GE  2, 3)
Applicant’s tax transcripts from  December 2020  reflect  his  adjusted  gross income
in  2011   was  $193,491;  2012   -  $171,032;  2013   -  $170,859;  2014   -  $150,960;  2015   -
$191,631;  2016  - $152,642; 2017  - $173,586;  2018  - $273,634;  2019  - $204,099; 2020  -
$227,991; and 2021  –  $211,427. (Tr. 68-69;  GE 2; AE C, D, E)
The tax transcripts from 2011 through 2014 show a zero balance owed each year.
It  appears  a  refund  from  tax  year  2019  may  have  been  applied  to  these  tax  years’
balances. Tax transcripts from December 2020 show balances owed for 2015 - $31,036;
2016 - $10,578; 2017 - $17,222; and 2018 - $7,903. Post-hearing, Applicant provided his
2019 tax year transcript, which reflected a zero balance owed and a refund was applied
to his delinquent 2015 tax debt. He also provided his 2020 and 2021 tax transcripts which
reflect he owes $8,673 for tax year 2020 and $3,726 for tax year 2021. Applicant stated
in his post-hearing letter that he was unable to obtain tax transcripts for years earlier than
2013 because the IRS only had the past ten tax years available. (GE 2, AE A, C, D, E)
Applicant testified that he had an installment agreement with the IRS sometime in
2020  to  pay  $760.  Based  on  documents  he  provided  post-hearing,  it  appears  this
agreement  started  in  March  2021  and  continued  to  July  2021.  He  made  the  monthly
payments.  His  2020  tax  transcript  reflects  that  in  March  2022  he  established  an
installment  agreement.  His  2021  tax  transcript  reflects  another  installment  agreement
established  in  July  2022.  He  testified  that  in  October  2022,  he  had  a  new  installment
agreement with the IRS to pay $1,162 a month for five years. (Tr. 24-30, 34; AE A, C, D,
E, F, G)
The  SOR alleged  that Applicant failed  to  timely file State  A  income  tax returns  for
tax years 2010, 2011  and  2012. Applicant denied  this and  claimed  he  has always filed  his
tax returns timely. He provided  a  document from  State  A  that shows  his  2010  income  tax
return was filed  and  he  made  monthly payments toward  the  tax  due. He was unable to
produce  the  2011  and  2012  returns. He  provided  a  letter from  the  State  showing  he  did
not have any balance owed  for taxes. I found  Applicant’s testimony credible. (Tr. 37, 48-
49; GE 2)
The  SOR alleged  that  Applicant owed  State  B  $20,767  for delinquent  income  taxes
that  remained   unpaid.   Applicant provided   documents from   his State   B’s department of
revenue. The  documents show the  current balance  owed  is $22,352  for delinquent taxes,
and   his  2021   refund   was  applied   to   the   balance   owed.  He  provided   a   history  of  past
payments   he   made   on   his delinquent  state   tax  debt.  It  appears that  in   2017   he   had   a
payment  plan  with  State  B. He  did  not provide  a  copy of it. From  June  2017  to  July 2021,
he  made  a  total of 36  payments, of which  29  were  applied  to  his delinquent 2015  taxes
and  the  remaining  7  payments  were  made  in  2018, 2019,  and  2020  and  applied  to  his
2016  tax debt. Applicant also  provided  a  document from  February 1, 2023, showing  he
entered  into  an  installment agreement with  State  B  to  pay $419  a  month  for 60  months to
resolve his debt. (Tr. 41; AE H, I, J)
Applicant has not had financial counseling. He said he had a financial planner in
2007 and 2008, and he should have continued their services. Prior to 2014, he prepared
his own tax returns. After 2014, he had a professional prepare his tax returns. When he
learned he would owe taxes each year, he would contact the IRS and State B to make
payment arrangements. He said he was unaware of how installment agreements worked.
He was unaware that if he failed to pay a subsequent year’s taxes owed the installment
agreement  would  likely  stop.  He  testified  that  he  did  not  pay  his annual  income  taxes
because he was unable to do so since he did not have the money. (Tr. 33, 59-62)
Applicant’s  current  salary  is  $185,000.  He  qualifies  for  bonuses  and  last  year
received one between $10,000 and $12,000. He and his wife have numerous credit cards
that are  current  and have  a cumulative  balance  owed  of  approximately $30,000.  They
own  a  condominium  in  another  state  that  they  rent  to  his  stepson  and  family.  The
mortgage is $2,400 and they charge his stepson $2,000. His monthly residential mortgage
is $2,700. He and his wife have three vehicles. Two are older models and paid for. His
wife has a 2018 vehicle that they make $982 monthly payments. He tithes approximately
$1,000 a month. Applicant and his sisters support their elderly mother who has serious
medical issues. He provides $1,172 of support each month and has been  doing so for
about two years. Applicant has approximately $300,000 in his employer’s pension plan
and about $7,000 in his savings. (Tr. 60, 71-80)
Any derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will not be considered
for disqualifying purposes. It may be considered when making a credibility determination,
in the application of mitigating conditions, and in a whole-person analysis.
