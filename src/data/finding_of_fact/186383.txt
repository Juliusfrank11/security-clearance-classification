Applicant’s  drug history
Applicant was introduced  to  marijuana  in high  school  in 1996.  (GEs 1-2; Tr. 32-
34) In  the  ensuing  years, he  increased  his use  of the  drug  to  regular use. (GE 2; Tr. 32)
Between   2007   and   September  2019,   Applicant   used   and   purchased   marijuana   with
varying  frequency  before giving  up  marijuana  altogether.  (GEs  1-2;  Tr. 44-45) Applicant
attributed   his  marijuana   use   and   purchases  to   being   young   and   immature.  (GE  2;  Tr.
45-46)
Between   2006   and   2012,  Applicant  was   arrested   and   charged   with   marijuana-
related   offenses  on   three   occasions:  in  January  2006,  in  June   2009,  and   in  October
2012. (GEs  1-3)  Records document Applicant’s being  arrested  and  charged  in January
2006  with  marijuana-possession  for sale  (a  felony)  of  a  weighted  amount  of  between  ¼
and ½  of  a  pound  of marijuana  and  a  drug  paraphernalia  violation  (a  felony). The  felony
charges were  reduced to  a misdemeanor, and Applicant was found guilty of a marijuana
violation  (a  misdemeanor)  in June  2006. In  turn, he  was sentenced  to  18  months  of un-
supervised probation. (GEs 1-3; Tr.  29, 36)
Following his completion of his probation conditions in 2007, Applicant resumed
his usage of marijuana. (Tr. 37-38) Returning from college in May 2009, he reinstituted
his purchasing and selling of marijuana to earn money to pay his bills (typically ¼ to ½
of a pound). (Tr. 28-29, 36-37) In June 2009, Applicant was  stopped and searched by
police while driving his wife’s car. During their search of his wife’s car, police found ¼ of
a pound of marijuana in the trunk. (Tr. 39)
After  searching  Applicant’s  wife’s  vehicle,  the  police  arrested  Applicant  and
charged  him  with  narcotic  drug-possess  or  sale  (felony),  and  marijuana  possess/use
(felony).  (GEs  1-3;  Tr.  39-40)  Appearing  in  court  November  2009  to  answer  charges,
Applicant  was  found  guilty  of  marijuana  violation  and  sentenced  to  three  years  of
probation.  (GEs  1-3;  Tr.  40-41)  Applicant’s  felony  conviction  was  later  reduced  to  a
misdemeanor,  and  his  probation  conditions  were  reduced  to  30  months  of  probation.
(Tr. 40-41) Applicant was able to obtain an expungement of his marijuana violation and
restoration of his voting rights in 2016. (Tr. 40-41)
Between   2009   and   2012,   Applicant   resumed   his   use   of   marijuana   but  did  not
engage  in any selling  of the  substance. (Tr. 42) In  October 2012, he  was arrested  and
charged   with   marijuana-possess/use,  failure  to   appear  (2nd   degree),   and   drug
paraphernalia   violation.  (GEs  1-3;  Tr.  30-31   and  42-43)  After  he   was  stopped   and
searched   in  his  car,  police  found   a   bag   of  marijuana   (1/2   of   an   ounce)  and   drug
paraphernalia. (GEs 1-3; Tr. 30, 43)
Appearing in court to answer his 2012 drug charges, Applicant pled guilty to the
drug paraphernalia violation charge in October 2012 and was fined $300 and ordered to
perform  20  hours  of  community  service.  (GEs  1-3;  Tr.  43)  After  paying  the  fine  and
completing  the  court-ordered  20  hours  of  community  service,  Applicant  was  able  to
obtain an expungement  of these charges as well. (Tr. 43)
In   October  2014,   Applicant  was   involved   in   an   altercation   in   a   gambling   casino
and  was detained  by police  for disorderly conduct. (GEs  1-3; 31, 46-48)  Applicant had
smoked  marijuana  earlier in the  day but was certain of his not being  under the  influence
of  marijuana   when   he   was  detained   by  police.  (Tr.47)   Applicant  self-reported   the
incident to  his facility security office  (FSO) and  was  referred  for a  randomized urinalysis.
(GE  2; Tr.  45), After failing  his administered  drug  test, he  was terminated  for cause.  (GE
2) Applicant has never been cited for any other failed urinalysis.
Since  September  2019,  Applicant  has  sustained  his  abstinence  from  marijuana
use and has avoided old acquaintances and others who use marijuana and who may be
involved  in  marijuana  activities.  (Tr.  32-33)  He  signed  and  submitted  a  statement  of
intent  never  to  use  marijuana  or  other  illegal  drugs  again  at  the  risk  of  having  his
security clearance suspended or revoked should any illegal drug be found in his system.
He submitted this statement with the understanding that marijuana is banned by federal
law  and  DoD  policy.  (AE  A;  Tr.  25-26,  48-51)  Asked  whether  his  statement  of  intent
should be interpreted to include a waiver of his due process rights, he responded in the
affirmative. (Tr. 51)
Endorsements  and work  recognitions
Applicant  is  well-regarded  by  his  manager,  supervisor,  coworkers,  and  friends
who have known Applicant for many years. (AEs B-H); Tr. 21-23) They credit Applicant

“shout
outs”
Whether  Applicant’s  character  references  were  aware  of  Applicant’s  past
marijuana use and activities when they endorsed him is unclear. None of his references
acknowledged  awareness  of  his  past  misuse  of  marijuana  or  any  other  illegal  drugs.
Nonetheless,  his  references  provided  strong  backing  of  his  overall  reliability  and
trustworthiness and their letters are entitled to considerable weight.
