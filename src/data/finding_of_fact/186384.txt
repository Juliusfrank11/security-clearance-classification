Applicant, age 49, married his wife in 2013. He was married to his ex-wife, with
whom  he  has  two  adult  children,  from  1996  through  2013.  His  also  has  two  adult
stepchildren,  one  of  whom  currently  resides  with  Applicant  and  his  wife.  Applicant
received his high school diploma in 1991. He attended college in the 1990s for three years
without earning a degree. He has been employed as an engineer by a defense contractor
since April 2018. He was initially granted a DOD security clearance in about 2006. (GE
1; Tr. at 17, 38-46)
Applicant attributed his indebtedness to a “tsunami of unfortunate events” over the
period between about 2016 and 2018, when he was either unemployed or underemployed
and his wife suffered from complications after sustaining a serious injury. His wife’s injury
led to her loss of income and extraordinary medical expenses for which she did not have
“very  good”  medical  insurance  to  cover.  Because  she  was  self-employed,  she  had  to
close her business and was not eligible for unemployment compensation.  In 2018, she
briefly worked part time “to help make  money for the  family.” However, soon  after she
began  her  part-time  employment,  she  had  to  quit  due  to  ongoing  health  issues  that
precluded her from performing the duties required of the position. As of the hearing, his
wife had made progress in recovering from her injury, but remained unemployed due to
an ongoing medical condition unrelated to her injury. (Answer; Tr. at 28, 67-69)
While  working  on  the  same  DOD  contract  from  about  2006  through  December
2013, Applicant’s salary increased from about $151,000 to $160,000. In 2013, he decided
not to continue working on that contract because it was acquired by an employer with a
bad  reputation.  Instead,  he  found  employment  with  another  defense  contractor  from
December 2013 through April 2014, earning a salary that was not indicated in the record.
He then was employed by a defense contractor to work on another government agency
(AGA  1)  contract  from  April  2014  through  about  February  or  March  2016,  earning  an
annual salary of $220,000. During his time with AGA 1, his DOD security clearance had
been  archived,  which  he  did  not  realize  until  he  was  searching  for  a  new  employer.
(Answer; Tr. at 29-38)
Applicant  remained  unemployed  through  November  2016,  when  he  found  an
employer willing to sponsor him for a clearance. During that period, he was supported by
his savings and unemployment compensation of about $1,300 per month. While waiting
for his clearance to be reinstated, he worked on a contract for another government agency
(AGA 2) from November 2016 through April 2018, earning an annual salary of $121,000,
which he described as “a very significant cut in pay.” His AGA 2 salary was insufficient to
meet  expenses  that  were  strained  by  the  loss  of  his  wife’s  income,  increased
transportation expenses due to a longer commute to work, and the $3,000 per month he
continued to pay his ex-wife for alimony and child support.  He never missed a support
payment  to  his  ex-wife,  which  ended  in  2020  when  his  youngest  child  turned  20.
Attempting  to  stay  current  with  his  financial  obligations,  he  relied  on  credit  cards  and
depleted  his  “life  savings”  of  over  $20,000.  Eventually,  he  fell  behind  and  incurred
delinquent debts, including those alleged in the SOR. He began earning an annual salary
of $151,000 upon being hired by his current employer in April 2018. That salary increased
over time to $181,000 in about February or March 2022. (Answer; GE 5 at 1; Tr. at 18,
29-38, 44, 103-104)
On July 28, 2020, after he completed his SCA, Applicant was interviewed by an
investigator who confronted him with SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b, about which he had no prior
knowledge.  On  August  5,  2020,  after  completing  his  own  investigation  of  those  debts,
Applicant followed up with the investigator to provide the information he learned about
them and to profess his intent to pay both debts. He then worked with his wife to develop
a budget and a plan to address their finances. At the hearing, he explained that process:
I took the  credit report, and  we  started  reviewing  everything  at that point.
We  –  my  wife  keeps a  running  folder of  what our accounts are,  what the
bills are, and  she  also has a  notebook of what's  due  and  what the  budget
plan   is  to   pay  all   these   items   down,   and   that's  where   we  kind   of   did  a
reconciliation   of   what's  what,   what   needs   to   be   refocused   as   I  started
making  more money, and  also as things are paid off,  taking  that money that
was,  let's say, applied  to  a  car  payment that  is now paid  off, we can  take
that,  let's  say, $600 and  apply that somewhere  else to  another bill  and  pay
down faster. (GE 5, Tr. at 48-49)
In August 2020, Applicant resolved an unalleged credit card account that had been
charged  off  (for  the  same  reasons  described  above)  in  the  approximate  amount  of
$10,195. He made $600 monthly payments towards the $10,195 debt which reduced the
remaining balance to $1,095 as of July 2020. February 2021 and November 2021 CBRs
listed a $0 balance and noted, “paid charge-off.” (Answer; GE 1 at 47-49; GE 2 at 5; GE
4 at 5; GE 5 at 2)
SOR ¶ 1.a ($11,763) is a charged-off credit card Applicant opened jointly with his
wife in 2015 with a $12,000 credit limit. They fell behind in their monthly payments for the
reasons described above. In April 2021, he paid the debt in full via one lump-sum payment
using a portion of a $15,000 gift he received from his mother. He explained that, since his
father’s passing in 2004, his mother has occasionally gifted money to him and his sister,
in  lump-sum  amounts  ranging  from  about  $10,000  to  $15,000.  The  gift  is  purely
discretionary, and he neither expects it nor is allowed to ask for it. There have been years
when he does not receive the monetary gift. The record did not indicate when and how
much he had received in prior years. (GE 2 at 3; AE F; Tr. at 46-50, 72-73)
SOR  ¶  1.b  ($22,420)  is  a  charged-off  student  loan  Applicant  co-signed  with  is
stepson, in 2017, to help him pay for college. His stepson only attended about one and a
half  semesters  before  disenrolling  due  to  poor  performance.  Initially,  the  loan  was
deferred because his stepson planned to reenroll in a local community college. Then, it
was  deferred  due  to  COVID-19.  When  the  deferral  ended,  the  loan  fell  into  arrears
because  his  son  was  unable  to  obtain  employment  due  to  COVID-19.  Prior  to  his
November 2021 CBR, he made some payments that reduced the remaining balance to
$20,331. At the hearing, Applicant testified that he continued to make payments further
reducing the remaining balance to $5,082. After the hearing, he proffered documentary
evidence to corroborate that he consistently paid $339 per month from November 2021
through January 2023. As of February 24, 2023, the remaining balance was $3,050. (GE
2 at 4; GE 5 at 4; Tr. at 18-20, 27, 50-55; AE I)
SOR ¶ 1.c ($13,293) is a charged-off $29,943 loan Applicant opened, in 2017, to
consolidate higher interest credit-card accounts. Those credit cards, which were  not in
delinquent status at the time of the loan, were used to pay living and medical expenses.
He defaulted on the loan for the reasons described above. Upon receipt of a letter from a
collection  company  about  the  debt,  in  about  2020,  he  began  making  $832  payments
towards  the  debt.  A  balance  of  $5,389  was  reflected  on  a  November  2021  CBR.  The
creditor confirmed that the debt was paid in full in May 2022. (GE 1 at 48, 49; GE 2 at 4;
GE 5 at 4; Answer; AE A, H; Tr. at 19, 57-64)
Appellant’s November 2021 CBR and his credible testimony demonstrated that he
lives  within  his  means  and  is  responsibly  managing  his  current  finances.  He  has  not
incurred any delinquent debts beyond what was alleged in the SOR, despite some recent
unexpected  expenses  due  to  necessary  repairs,  including  $3,000  to  replace  a  rotted
bathroom floor, and $1,500 to replace a well pump. (GE 2; Tr. at 74)
At the hearing, Appellant expressed regret that he had not taken a larger role in
educating himself about his finances and promised to involve himself more. He explained
that his wife had been primarily responsible for managing their finances which led to his
uncertainty about certain specific details he was asked to provide during the hearing. He
stated,
I guess I'd  also like  to  state  that  I'm  happy to  take  a  better  role  in  the  financial
planning   in  my  family.   It's  something   that's  scary  to   me   that  I   just  don't
understand, and  I should get smarter, and  I  will.  (Tr. at 79, 102)
After the hearing, Applicant declared that he continued to take on “a larger roll [sic]
in  our  families  [sic]  financial  planning  and  bill  paying.”  He  stated,  “I  have  150%
understanding of all moneys [sic] owed and possessed.” Applicant provided a copy of his
family budget, which showed his salary of $171,000, a $1,681 net remainder, and $5,091
in savings. His listed debts included a $363 monthly payment towards SOR ¶ 1.b. It also
indicated that his alimony and child support obligation had ended.  He asserted, “Since
my  hearing,  we  have  continued  to  reduce  our  debt,  grow  our  credit  and  improve  our
financial health better than it has ever been.” (GE 2-4; GE 5 at 3; AE D, H, I; Tr. at 73-75,
81)
Applicant’s  former  supervisor  lauded  his  “exceptional”  work  ethic,  integrity,  and
professionalism.  He  described  Applicant  as  an  “exceptional”  software  engineer  and
mentor.  He  stated,  “I  highly  recommend  [Applicant]  for  continued  clearance  to  access
classified systems.” Applicant was recognized in March 2022 for his extraordinary work
performance, for which he received a $2,500 monetary reward. (AE B, G)
