After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I
make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  37  years old.  He earned  an  associate’s degree  in September 2009
and attended college in 2011. He has never been married and has one child (8 years old).
He has been employed by federal contractors in various information technology positions
since September 2015, and has worked for his current employer since March 2016. He
was unemployed from December 2014 to January 2015. (Item 3)
The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  failed  to  file,  as  required,  federal  income  tax
returns for tax years 2016 through 2018, and 2020 (SOR ¶ 1.a), state income tax returns
for tax years 2017, 2018, and 2020 (SOR ¶ 1.b), and that he failed to pay, as required,
his Federal income taxes for tax year 2014 (SOR ¶ 1.c). (Item 1) In Applicant’s answer to
the SOR, he admitted all SOR allegations with explanations. (Item 2)
In  his August 2018  security  clearance  application  (SCA), Applicant  reported  that
he   forgot  to   file   federal   and   state   income   tax   returns  for  tax   year  2017.   (Item   3   at  40)
During  background  interviews with  a  government investigator  in September 2019, he  said
that he  had  not  filed  federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  for tax  years 2017  and  2018,
and  had  not requested  filing  extensions. (Item  4  at 5) He said that he  had  attempted  to
file  his taxes in  February  2019  “on  the  IRS  website,  but he  got confused.”  He stated  his
intent to  hire  an  accountant and  to  file  the  delinquent income  tax  returns.  (Item  4  at 5  and
6) During  a  September 18, 2020  interview, he  reported  that  he  had  filed  federal  and  state
income  tax  returns for tax  years 2017  to  2019  in July  2020. The  investigator told Applicant
that  he  had  five  days to  provide  tax  account transcripts.  (Item  4  at  7) During  a September
21,  2020   interview,  Applicant  reported   that   his  online   federal  tax   account  transcript
reflected  that his 2018  income tax  return had  not been  filed.  (Item  4  at 8)
In response to DOHA interrogatories in March 2022, Applicant submitted federal
income tax account transcripts dated in March 2022 reflecting that he had not filed income
tax  returns  for  tax  years  2016  through  2018  and  2020,  and  that  credits  from  his
overpayment of taxes in tax year 2019 were applied to arrearages for tax years 2012 and
2014. (Item 4 at 12-15) In his narrative response to inquiries, he reported that he had filed
federal income tax returns for tax years 2015 through 2019; that he owed an unknown
amount for tax year 2014, and had “setup a payment arrangement to get it paid.” (Item 4
at 10-11) He reported that he had filed state income tax returns for tax years 2015 through
2019, and that he had not filed state income tax returns for tax years 2020 and 2021, but
planned to do so. (Item 4 at 20)
In  Applicant’s June 2022 answer to the SOR, he admitted failing to file his 2016
federal income tax return, claimed that he filed returns for tax years 2017 and 2018, and
said that he would be filing returns for tax years 2016 and 2020. (SOR ¶ 1.a) He admitted
that he had not timely filed state income tax returns for tax years 2017, 2018 and 2020,
claimed  that  he  had  since  filed  returns  for tax  years  2017  and  2018,  and  said  that  he
would file his 2020 and 2021 returns. (SOR ¶ 1.b) He admitted that he had not paid federal
income taxes due for tax year 2014 (SOR 1.c), and indicated that he would “go to the IRS
website and start a payment arrangement to get the taxes paid.” (Item 2 at 2) He provided
documentary  evidence  that  in  July  2020,  a  tax  service  prepared  his  federal  and  state
income tax returns for tax years 2017 and 2018, and that he and the tax preparer signed
those  returns.  (Item  2  at  3-42)  He  submitted  documents  including  his  declaration  and
signature authorization for the tax preparer to electronically file the subject returns and a
signed  tax  preparer’s  “Certification  and  Authentication”  confirming  federal  and  state
income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2017  and  2018  were  electronically  filed  by  the  tax
preparer. (Item 2 at 11, 15, 32, 36)  He did not submit documentary evidence  his 2017
and  2018  income  tax  returns  were  received  or  processed  by  federal  or  state  tax
authorities, or that he received anticipated refunds for tax years 2017 and 2018. (Item 2
at 6, 11, 13-15, 19, 21, 27, 29, 32-36, 40-42)
Applicant submitted a personal financial statement reflecting a net monthly salary
of approximately $5,200, monthly expenses of approximately $1,500, and a net monthly
remainder  of  approximately  $3,641.  (Item  4  at  22)  He  did  not  provide  documentary
evidence of his current financial budget, savings or expendable income.
