In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c,
1.f-1.l,  and  1.p-1.r.  He  denied  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.d,  1.e,  and  1.m-1.o.  His
admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 32-year-old engineer electrician employed by a defense contractor
since November 2018. (Tr. 22.) He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from May 2010
to April 2013 and received a medical discharge as a result of service-connected injuries.
He held a security clearance in the Navy but does not currently have a clearance.
Applicant  attended  college  from  July  2013  to  May  2015  and  received  an
associate’s degree in culinary arts in May 2015. He married in March 2011 and has three
children, ages 13, 11, and 9 (Tr. 17.)
The SOR alleges three unsatisfied judgments, 17 delinquent debts, and failures to
file  federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  for  2016,  2017,  and  2018.  The  unsatisfied
judgments alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c are reflected in court records (GX 3.) The
delinquent debts are reflected in credit reports from March 2021 and January 2020 (GX
4 and 5). The evidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below.
SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c: judgments for $16,634; $5,379; and $1,780. During a
personal subject interview (PSI) with a security investigator in January 2020, Applicant
told the investigator that the three judgments entered against him in 2019 and 2020 were
caused by the failure of his tenants in a rental property to pay the rent, which made him
unable to make the payments on the mortgage loan. He told the investigator that he had
modified the loan and that all payments were current. (GX 2 at 4.)
At the hearing Applicant testified that the judgment for $16,634 (SOR ¶ 1.a) was
for  the  amount  due  on  an  auto  loan  after  the  auto  was  stolen  and  totaled,  and  the
insurance  was  insufficient  to  pay  off  the  loan.  (27.)  He  testified  that  he  established  a
payment plan “a few months ago” providing for payments of about $200 per month. He
testified  that  he  has  been  making  the  payments  when  he  can.  He  did  not  submit  any
documentation of payments or a payment plan.
At the hearing, Applicant testified that the judgment for  $5,379 (SOR ¶ 1.b) was
due to the loss of an auto that was destroyed in a flood. He testified that he intended to
resolve it, but he provided no documentation of any steps to carry out his intent.
Applicant testified that the judgment for $1,780 was for unpaid rent for the family
residence, and that it had been resolved. (Tr. 32-33.) The court records reflect that it was
for “unlawful detainer,” which is consistent with Applicant’s testimony. (GX 3 at 3.) After
the hearing, he submitted a resident ledger showing his payment history from June 2019
to  December  2020.  (AX  B.)  The  ledger  does  not  reflect  the  judgment  or  any  steps  to
resolve it, but it does reflect late charges and legal fees assessed in September 2019,
January  2020,  February  2020,  September  2020,  October  2020,  November  2020,  and
December 2020. Applicant submitted no evidence that the judgment has been satisfied.
SOR ¶ 1.d: delinquent child-support payments totaling $8,300. During the PSI,
Applicant stated that he had an agreement to pay $286 to resolve the arrearage. (GX 2
at 4.) In his answer to the SOR, he stated that he had reduced the arrearage to less than
$3,000. At the hearing, he testified that he had reduced it to about $1,400. (Tr. 35, 65.)
He  no  longer  pays  child  support  because  his  son  is  living  with  him.  (Tr.  65.)  After  the
hearing, he submitted his payment history as of February 6, 2023. It reflects that he was
paying $286 monthly, that the last payment was in May 2022, and that the arrearage is
$2,221.62. (AX C.)
SOR ¶ 1.e: delinquent debt charged off for $45,752. Applicant testified that this
debt is a duplicate of SOR ¶ 1.a. (Tr. 37.) The debt was charged off in February 2016,
and the judgment alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a was entered in 2019 by the same credit union.
The credit reports do not reflect any other auto loans with this creditor.
SOR  ¶  1.f:  delinquent  debt  charged  off  for  $15,752.  In  the  PSI,  Applicant
admitted this debt. He stated that it was a joint auto loan account with his wife and that
he forgot to make a payment. He stated that he had a payment plan providing for monthly
payments of $525 and that the payments were current. (GX 2 at 7-8.) He provided no
documentary evidence of payments or a payment plan. At the hearing, he admitted that
that this debt was a deficiency after a repossession and that it was not resolved. (Tr. 40.)
SOR ¶¶ 1.g, 1.h, and 1.k: delinquent debts charged off for $9,133; $8,347; and
$1,365. The same credit union is the creditor for all three debts. Applicant testified that
he  was not  sure if  they  were  credit-card  accounts or personal loans.  He  has  taken  no
action to resolve them. (Tr. 41-42.)
SOR ¶ 1.i: delinquent credit-card account placed for collection of $3,832. This
debt  was  a  delinquent  credit-card  account  associated  with  a  military  exchange  store.
Applicant testified that it is being satisfied by garnishment of $300 per month. (Tr. 42-43,
56.)  After  the  hearing,  he  submitted  a  “Confirmation  of  Authorization  for  Recurring
Transfers from Account” from a collection agency, dated February 6, 2023. The document
reflects Applicant’s credit-card account number and reflects an agreement to pay $300
per month beginning on February 28, 2023. It does not reflect that any payments have
been made.
SOR  ¶  1.j:  delinquent  debt  placed  for  collection  of  $1,365.  During  the  PSI,
Applicant stated that he had no knowledge of this debt. (GX 2 at 6.) At the hearing, he
testified that it was for a television set or a computer, and that he had taken no action to
resolve it. (Tr. 44.)
SOR ¶ 1.l: delinquent debt charged off for $1,236. Applicant testified that this
debt was for furniture, and that he had taken no action to resolve it, but that he intended
to resolve it. (Tr. 45.) In his post-hearing submission, he provided a confirmation number
but no documentation of any action.
SOR ¶ 1.m: telecommunications debt past due for $726. Applicant testified that
this debt was for unreturned equipment, and that he had paid it two years ago. (Tr. 46.)
In his post-hearing submission, he provided a confirmation number but no documentation
to support his testimony.
SOR ¶ 1.n: utility bill past due for $352. Applicant testified that this debt arose
when he moved to another residence, and that he paid it in 2020. (Tr. 48.)  In his post-
hearing submission, he provided a confirmation number but no documentation to support
his testimony.
SOR ¶ 1.o: insurance debt past due for $283. Applicant testified that this debt
arose when he switched insurance companies, and that he paid it in 2021. (Tr. 48-49.) in
his post-hearing submission, he provided a confirmation number but  no documentation
to support his testimony.
SOR ¶ 1.p: delinquent debt charged off for $1,364. In the PSI, Applicant told
the investigator that this debt was for the purchase of a television set. (GX 2 at 5.) At the
hearing, he testified that he could not identify the debt. (Tr. 49.) The debt is not resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.q: delinquent auto loan charged off for $7,055. In the PSI, Applicant
told the investigator that he had no knowledge of this debt. (GX 2 at 7.) At the hearing, he
testified that he learned two years ago that the debt was delinquent but that he had taken
no action to resolve it. (Tr. 51.)
SOR ¶ 1.r: failure to file federal and state income tax returns for 2016, 2017,
and 2018. During the PSI, Applicant told the investigator that he and his wife had filed
joint returns prior to 2016, and he forgot to file his returns for 2016, 2017, and 2018. In
the January 2020 PSI, he told the investigator that he had delivered his tax information to
a professional tax preparer who would prepare the returns. (GX 2 at 8.) At the hearing,
he submitted no evidence that he had filed his returns. He attributed his failure to file his
income tax returns to “bad information” he received, leading him to believe that he was
not required to file tax returns if he did not earn a certain amount of money, and that he
was  unemployed  or  in  school  during  those  three  years.  (Tr.  18.)  His  testimony  is
contradicted by the employment information he provided in his SCA, which reflects that
he was employed full time during 2016, 2017, and 2018. (GX 1 at 14-16.)
Applicant’s  net income is about $2,400 per month. He receives disability  pay of
about  $1,600  per month.  He  had about $9,000  in  his retirement account  when he  last
checked it a year ago. His wife is not employed outside the home, but she is a disabled
military veteran and receives about $4,000 per month in disability pay. They have three
automobiles,  model  years  2012,  2017,  and  2022.  Their  total  car  payments  are  about
$1,100 per month, and car insurance is about $380 per month. They pay $93 per month
for cable and internet, and $600 for utilities. He estimates that he and his wife have a net
monthly remainder of about $600 after paying their bills. (Tr. 56-65.)
