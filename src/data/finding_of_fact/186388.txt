In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  she  admitted  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.g
and 1.i-1.n. She denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.f and 1.h. Her admissions are
incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  39-year-old  project  manager  employed  by  a  defense  contractor
since  August  2022.  She  worked  as  a  government  employee  at  a  naval  shipyard  from
about February 2002 to July 2016. She received a security clearance in February 2002.
She was self-employed as a graphic designer from July 2016 to December 2017. She
worked  for  non-federal  employers  from  December  2017  to  June  2019.  She  was
unemployed  from  June  to  November  2019,  while  caring  for  her  mother.  She  was  a
federal employee  from November 2019 to August 2022.  She was hired  by her current
employer,  a  defense  contractor,  in  August  2022.  She  has  held  an  interim  clearance
since November 2020. (Tr. 27.)
Applicant  was  enrolled  in  college  courses  from  an  online  university  from  July
2011 to July 2014 and from April 2020 to the present. She does not yet have a degree.
She is not married and has no children.
Applicant  testified  that  her  financial  problems  began  when  she  was  arrested  in
October  2014  for  driving  under  the  influence.  Although  the  charge  was  reduced  to
reckless  driving,  she  incurred  about  $8,000  in  legal  expenses.  (Tr.  16.)  Her  self-
employment was not as profitable as she expected. Her student loans went into default,
and she fell behind on credit-card payments and the loan for her motorcycle. (Tr. 18.).
Wage  and  income  transcripts  from  the  IRS  reflect  the  drastic  reduction  in  her  income
during her period of self-employment. (AX C, D, and E.)
The  SOR  alleges 14 delinquent debts  reflected  in  credit  reports  from  July 2021
and  November  2020  (GX  2  and  3).  The  evidence  related  to  the  debts  is  summarized
below.
SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.f:  student  loans  totaling  $46,135.  In  February  2020,  Applicant
entered  into  a  rehabilitation  agreement  providing  for  $5  payments  for  12  consecutive
months. (AX H.) At the hearing,  she provided documentation showing that  her student
loans  were  rehabilitated  and  that  she  had  a  payment  plan  providing  for  monthly
payments  of  $483.  She  was  scheduled  to  begin  payments  in  January  2021,  but
payments were deferred in accordance with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic
Security (CARES) Act. (AX H; Tr. 22.)
The   CARES   act   provided   for  automatic  forbearance   and   zero  interest   charges
during  the  forbearance. This student-loan  debt relief was extended  several times. Most
recently,  it   extended   to   permit  the   Department  of  Education   to   implement  a   debt-relief
program,  which   is  under  litigation.  Loan   payments  will   restart   60   days  after  the   debt-
relief  program  is  implemented   or  the   litigation   is   resolved.1   Appellant’s  student    loans
were   current  when   the   forbearance   went   into   effect.   Her  student  loans  are  not
delinquent.
SOR ¶¶ 1.g and 1.h: credit-card accounts charged off for $3,717 and $2,157.
The  debt  for  $3,717  was  charged  off  in  August  2020  and  the  debt  for  $2,157  was
charged off in October 2020. (GX 3 at 4.) At the hearing, Applicant testified that she was
making  monthly  payments  of  $300  on  each  of  these  accounts.  (Tr.  36.)  She  did  not
submit documentation of payments.
SOR ¶ 1.i: personal loan charged off for $2,035. This debt was charged off in
August 2020. (GX 3 at 5.)  At the hearing, Applicant testified that this debt  was paid in
full. (Tr. 37.) She did not submit any documentation of payment.
SOR  ¶  1.j:  telecommunications  account  placed  for  collection  of  $1,105.  In
October  2020,  Applicant  made  a  payment  agreement  providing  for  six  monthly
payments  of  $122.87.  (AX  F.)  At  the  hearing,  she  testified  that  it  was  paid  in  full.  (Tr.
38.) She did not submit any documentation of payment.
SOR ¶ 1.k: credit-card account charged off for $808. This debt was charged
off in October 2020 (GX 3 at 6.) At the hearing, Applicant testified that she is willing to
pay this debt but has been unable to do so  because  she cannot find out who owns it.
She  testified  that  she  disputed  the  debt  electronically  and  it  was  removed  from  her
credit  record.  (Tr.  40,  61.)  However,  the  debt  is  still  reflected  in  the  July  2021  credit
report.  (GX  2  at  4.)  She  did  not  submit  any  documentation  of  her  dispute  or  its
resolution.
SOR  ¶  1.l:  credit-card  account  placed  for  collection  of  $1,575.  Applicant
testified that she paid this debt with the proceeds of the loan alleged in SOR ¶ 1.i. (Tr.
41.)  The  debt  was  charged  off  in  March  2016  and  is  reflected  as  disputed  in  the  July
2021  and  November  2020  credit  reports.  (GX  2  at  4;  GX  3  at  6).  Applicant  did  not
submit any documentation of payment.
SOR ¶ 1.m: personal loan charged off for $2,417. Applicant testified that she
incurred this debt to buy a motorcycle, that her mother gave her the money to pay the
debt,  and  that  it  was  paid  off  when  she  sold  the  motorcycle.  (Tr.  43.)  The  loan  was
1 https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19.
charged off in October 2020. (GX 3 at 5.). Applicant testified that she needed to pay off
the loan to obtain the title to the motorcycle so that she could sell it. After the hearing,
she submitted a screen shot of state motor vehicle records showing that she owned the
motorcycle and that the license plate would expire in August 2023. (AX G.) She argued
that the motor vehicle records show that she sold the motorcycle, but her evidence does
not  support  her  claim  that  the  motorcycle  was  sold.  (AX  A  at  3.)  Furthermore,  even  if
she sold the motorcycle,  she presented no evidence showing that the proceeds of the
sale were used to pay off the personal loan.
SOR ¶ 1.n: medical debt placed for collection of $718. This debt was placed
for collection in October 2020. (GX 3 at 6.) Applicant testified that she incurred this debt
when she went to an urgent care facility while she was unemployed and without medical
insurance.  She testified  that  this debt has  been paid.  (Tr. 45.) She  did not  submit any
documentation  of  payment.  However,  the  debt  is not  reflected  on  the  July  2021  credit
report. Because the debt is too recent to have aged off her credit record under the Fair
Credit Reporting Act, its absence from the credit report suggests that it was resolved.
Applicant  testified   that   her  current  salary  is  about  $9,000   per  month,  which  is
about $3,000  more than  her salary for her previous job. She  has about $500  in savings
and  $2,600  in her retirement account.  Her monthly rent is $1,800. She  has a  ten-year-
old  car  that   she   bought  in  2019,  and   her  payments  on   the   loan   are  $414.   She   has  a
monthly  remainder  of  $200   to   $300   after  paying   all   her  expenses.   She   plans  to   travel
overseas in  the  summer and  has budgeted  $6,000  for the  trip. She  testified that she  has
a  financial counselor, and  she  uses computer software  to  track her expenses. (Tr. 46-
54.)
Applicant’s supervisor has known  her for 10 years. He  submitted  a  letter stating
that  she  has  been  selected  for multiple  special  assignments  because  of  her character
and willingness to help. He states that she has left a positive impact and improvement
on every assignment. In addition to her work, she has “volunteered for more causes and
mentored more people than [he] can list.” (AX B.)
