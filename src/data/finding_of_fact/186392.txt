Applicant, age 33, is unmarried and has no children.  She attended college from
approximately August 2011 through April 2013 without earning a degree. She has been
employed as a correctional officer by her state  since September 2022. She previously
worked  there  from  November  2016  through  August  2021.  The  record  indicates  that
Applicant  had  more  than  one  sponsor  associated  with  the  SCA,  which  is  her  first
application  for  a  security  clearance.  In  her  FORM  response,  she  indicated  that
employment  with  her  current  sponsor  is  pending  the  successful  adjudication  of  her
security  clearance.  The  interim  security  clearance  she  was  granted  sometime  in  2021
was withdrawn in about June 2022, presumably in connection with the issuance of the
SOR. (Item 3; Item 5 at 17-18; AE A, C)
Applicant  worked  in  the  retail  and  food  service  industry  from  February  2008
through  November  2016.  She  was  employed  full  time  from  February  2008  through
October  2010  when  she  relocated  to  attend  community  college.  She  remained
unemployed until she began a full-time position in March 2012, which she left in January
2015 for a reason identified as a “location change.” Applicant began a part-time position
with Employer A at the beginning of May 2015 that continued until November 2016. She
ended a full-time position with Employer B at the end of May 2015. She was able to work
concurrently  for  Employers  A  and  B  in  May  2015  because  she  worked  her  full-time
position in the mornings and the part-time position in the evenings. (Item 3; Item 4 at 2,
5; AE C)
The record was confusing about Applicant’s employment status between January
2015 and May 2015. Applicant did not disclose Employer B in her SCA. During her March
2021 security clearance  interview (SI), she  reported working for Employer B from May
2015  through  November  2016.  However,  in  a  May  2022  response  to  DOHA-issued
interrogatories, she indicated that the timeline she gave the investigator for Employer B
was incorrect, but only corrected the end date and not the start date. (Item 3; Item 4 at 2,
5; AE C)
The record was also unclear about Applicant’s employment status between August
2021 and September 2022. Applicant provided a December 31, 2021 paystub indicating
that she had been employed by Employer C for several months. In her September 2022
FORM  response,  she  reported  a  period  of  unemployment  between  about  June  and
September 2022. The record is otherwise silent on the issue. (Item 5 at 17-18)
The SOR alleged 25 debts, including a $7,398 car loan (SOR ¶ 1.a), eight federal
student  loans  totaling  $23,978  (SOR  ¶¶  1.b  –  1.h,  and  1.l)  and  11  medical  accounts
totaling $3,561 (SOR ¶¶ 1.k, 1.m, 1.o, and 1.r – 1.y). In her Answer, Applicant admitted
each of the SOR allegations.
Applicant responded “no” to each question about her financial record and did not
otherwise disclose any delinquent debts in her SCA. During her SI, she initially answered
“no” to whether she had any financial delinquencies in the past seven years. After being
confronted  by  the  investigator  with  debts  from  her  February  2021  credit  bureau  report
(CBR), which were also alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.y, Applicant recognized some
of the creditors and disputed others. She admitted that she was notified about a week or
two prior to the SI about SOR ¶ 1.p but denied prior knowledge that any other debts were
in delinquent status. (Item 3 at 29-30; Item 4 at 6-9)
Applicant  acknowledged  the  car  loan  in  SOR  ¶  1.a  but  did  not  consider  it  in
delinquent  status  because  she  had  been  paying  $100  per  month  to  the  creditor.  She
intended  to  continue  those  payments  until  the  debt  was  settled  by  her  insurance
company. The loan related to a car that was totaled in an August 2019 accident, which
she described as a 20-car pile-up on the freeway. She was not the cause of the accident.
(Item 4 at 7, 8)
Applicant  acknowledged  that she defaulted on  the  student loans  in  SOR ¶¶ 1.b
through  1.h  and  1.l  but  did  not  indicate  the  circumstances  of  the  default.  She  did  not
consider the loans in delinquent status because she had been making payments via an
automatic  payroll  deduction,  which  was  halted  due  to  COVID-19.  She  referenced  her
wages being garnished, but the record did not otherwise establish that the deduction was
involuntary. She planned to contact the creditor to investigate the status of her accounts.
She had no intent to default on her loans and planned to resume payments. (Item 4 at 8,
10).
Applicant denied that she was responsible for SOR ¶ 1.i, which was a charge for
damage to the common area of her college dormitory. She attributed the damage solely
to her roommates. She intended to dispute the debt the following day. She would only
pay  the  debt  if  she  were  required  to  do  so.  Any  such  payment  would  be  done  via  a
payment plan. (Item 4 at 7-8)
Applicant denied any knowledge that SOR ¶ 1.j was in collection status prior to the
day of the SI. She attributed the debt to her sister’s cell phone. Although Applicant’s plan
included  her  sister’s  phone,  her  sister  apparently  agreed  to  make  the  payments
associated with her sister’s phone. Unbeknownst to Applicant, her sister lost the phone
and fell behind with her payments. She planned to contact the creditor the following week
to set up a payment plan to begin at the end of March. (Item 4 at 7)
Applicant did not recognize the medical accounts or creditors in SOR ¶¶ 1.k, 1.o,
and 1.r through 1.y. She denied having any delinquent medical accounts  because she
had  medical  insurance  and  never  received  any  bills  for  medical  treatment.  She
recognized  that  the  SOR  ¶  1.m  creditor  was  the  hospital  to  where  she  was  sent  via
ambulance following the August 2019 accident but denied owing them any money. As of
the  SI,  she  did  not  have  any  then  existing  injuries  from  the  accident.  She  intended  to
investigate the accounts the following week and pay any that were deemed legitimate by
March 30, 2021. (Item 4 at 6-7)
Applicant  recognized SOR  ¶  1.n  as  past-due  rent  incurred  when  she  broke  her
lease to relocate in July 2017. She was not able to pay it right away nor had she previously
known how much she owed. She planned to contact the creditor the following week to set
up a payment plan to begin at the end of March 2021. She attributed her delay in resolving
this debt to not being smart with her finances at the time. Applicant did not explain what
she meant by that statement. The record did not otherwise indicate that she had been
irresponsible with respect to her finances. (Item 4 at 7)
Applicant recognized SOR ¶ 1.p as a carpet cleaning fee that she incurred at a
former apartment due to having a dog. At some point prior to the SI, she made a verbal
agreement with the creditor to resolve the debt via monthly payments of $50, beginning
at the end of March 2021. (Item 4 at 6)
Applicant acknowledged that she had car insurance with the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.q
but denied owing any delinquent balances because she made her monthly payments via
automatic payment. (Item 4 at 7)
After discussing the debts with which she was confronted, Applicant affirmed that
no other circumstances were involved besides those she explained. She characterized
her financial situation as okay. She asserted that she was actively trying to improve her
financial wellbeing. She had begun budgeting differently, obtained a new job, and working
a  lot  of  overtime.  She  believed  that  these  actions  would  allow  her  to  avoid  financial
difficulties in the future. She planned to resolve any legitimate debts and expressed her
intent to provide financial documents to the investigator at a later date. (Item 4 at 8-9)
After the SI, Applicant provided three documents to the investigator related to SOR
¶¶  1.a,  1.r.  and  1.q.  A  February  23,  2021  letter  confirmed  that,  because  of  her
cooperation,  the  SOR  ¶  1.a  creditor agreed  to  settle  the  debt  for $7,500  to  be  paid  in
monthly  installments  of  $100,  beginning  February  26,  2021.  A  March  5,  2021  letter
confirmed that she agreed to pay $44.49 per month, beginning March 30, 2021, to resolve
SOR ¶ 1.r. The SOR ¶ 1.q creditor confirmed via a March 12, 2021 letter that two $25
payments were scheduled to be paid on March 30, 2021 and April 30, 2021. The record
did not address whether the two payments were part of a larger settlement or resolved
SOR ¶ 1.q in full. (Item 4 at 12-14)
The  CAF  issued  interrogatories  to  Applicant on  January  11,  2022.  In  response,
she explained that she fell behind on bills due to “periods of times in my life where I fell
on hard times;” and asserted, “I am able to work a job that will allow me to pay my debts
off  in  a  timely  manner.”  She  included  in  her  response  three  documents,  including  a
duplicate of the SOR ¶ 1.a. letter previously provided to the investigator. A December 31,
2021  paystub  showed  a  $1,954  net  pay  for the  period  of  December  13,  2021  through
December  26,  2021,  and  a  $6,837  year-to-date  net  pay  for  an  unspecified  period.  A
January  11,  2022  letter  confirmed  that  Applicant  hired  an  agency  to  work  with  her  “to
repair inaccuracies” on her CBR. In response to questions about the status of her student
loans,  she  answered  “no”  to  whether  they  had  either  been  paid  or  any  payment
arrangements been made. She similarly responded to questions about the status of the
medical accounts in the SOR, and the other debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.i, 1.j, 1.n, 1.p, and 1.q.
(Item 5)
DOHA issued additional interrogatories to Applicant on May 27, 2022. In response,
she asserted that she was still making the monthly payments towards SOR ¶ 1.a, which
had reduced the balance  to $5,900. She  also  stated  that she  was “focusing  on  paying
each creditor and removing those accounts from my report;” and that, since the  SI, she
has “shown significant improvement in relation to my finances along with the removal of
previous  accounts  that  were  affecting  my  credit  score.”  She  did  not  proffer  any
documents. (Item 4 at 2)
In  her Answer, Applicant stated  that she  had  been  making  consistent payments to
reduce  the  balance  of  debt  in  SOR ¶  1.a  to  $5,000  and  continued  to  work  with  the  agency
she   hired   in  January 2022   to   dispute   the   $2,265   collection   account  in  SOR  ¶   1.i.   She
asserted   that   the   agency  helped   her  dispute   and   delete   from   her  CBRs  the   $1,881
collection   account  in  SOR  ¶   1.j,   the   $840   collection   account  in  SOR  ¶   1.n,   and   $758
medical debt in  SOR ¶  1.o.  She  claimed  that  the  $735  collection  account  in SOR ¶  1.p
was “pending  dispute,” and  that the  nine  medical debts totaling  $1,865  in SOR ¶¶  1.k and
1.r through  1.y were  no  longer showing  on  her  CBRs. She  did  not proffer  any documents.
Nor did she  provide  an  explanation  or status update  concerning   her student  loans, the
$938  medical debt in SOR ¶  1.m, or the  $388  car insurance  account in SOR ¶  1.q. She
concluded  by stating:
I am  dedicated  to  working  on  paying  off my debt  and  understand  that it  is
not just  necessary to  keep  my security clearance  but to  better myself. My
job  is  my  livelihood and  how I  am  able  to maintain  and  continue  to work on
paying  off  my debt.  I  take  pride  in the  work I  do  and  would like  to  continue
for as long  as I can.
In  her  September  2022  FORM  response,  Applicant  acknowledged  that  she
defaulted on some of the payment plans she established and fell behind on some bills
due  to  her  recent  period  of  unemployment  (from  approximately  June  2022  through
September 2022) caused by the withdrawal of her interim security clearance. She did not
provide  further  details.  She  obtained  a  new  job  to  help  her  catch  up  on  her  bills  and
resume her payment plans. She continued to engage the services of the agency that she
hired  in  January  2022  to  assist  her.  She  provided  a  September  3,  2022  letter  that
confirmed the SOR ¶ 1.a creditor received payments totaling $1,600, which reduced her
balance to $5,900 and that her next scheduled payment was due on September 30, 2022.
(AE A-C)
A February 2021 CBR confirmed each of the SOR debts. SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.j,
1.l, 1.m, 1.p, and 1.q were reported on her January 2022 CBR. The 2021 CBR indicated
that the medical debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.k, 1.m, 1.o, and 1.r went to collections after the 2019
accident, while those in SOR ¶¶ 1.s. through 1.y went to collections before the accident.
The 2021 CBR noted Applicant’s dispute of SOR ¶¶ 1.i, 1.n, 1.p, and 1.r. through 1.y; and
the 2022 CBR noted Applicant’s dispute of SOR ¶¶ 1.i, 1.j, 1.m, 1.p. and 1.q. The 2022
CBR revealed no new delinquent debts and that she was current in her monthly payments
of $30 and $25 per month for two credit cards opened in September 2021 with credit limits
of $300 and $200. (Items 6, 7)
