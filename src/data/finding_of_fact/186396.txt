Applicant,  age  33,  is  divorced  with  three  children,  ages  11,  9,  and  5.  He  was
married from March 2011 through January 2012. His youngest child resides with him. His
eldest child resides at another address in his home state. His middle child, with a different
last name, resides in another state. He received his high school diploma in May 2008. He
earned a technical degree in February 2018. He has been employed as a mechanic by a
defense contractor since May 2021. He previously worked for the same employer from
November 2008 through May 2010. In October 2012, he was honorably discharged from
the U.S. Air Force. He reported active-duty service dates from May 2012 through October

The  SOR  alleged  14  debts  derived  from  Applicant’s  June  2021  and  May  2022
credit  bureau  reports  (CBRs).  Without  explanation,  Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a
through 1.c, 1.e through 1.i, and 1.l, totaling $26,732; and denied SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.j, 1.k,
1.m,  and  1.n,  totaling  $9,498.  An  October  2022  credit  report  revealed  that  Applicant
opened six new credit accounts between May 2020 and June 2022, one of which was in
a charged-off status. (Items 4-6)
The  record  did  not  indicate  the  reason  why  Applicant  responded  “no”  to  each
question about his financial record and did not otherwise disclose any delinquent debts
in his SCA. In April 2022, Applicant responded to interrogatories propounded by the CAF
about his finances. He was asked specific questions about SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.j
through 1.n. He disclosed SOR ¶ 1.b in response to a question asking him if he had any
other delinquent accounts. He explained, “I finally have a steady job and getting caught
up it is just taking longer than planned but I am starting to pay stuff down or off.” (Item 3,
7)
In his interrogatory responses, Applicant  answered  “no” to  whether  he had paid
SOR  ¶¶  1.b,  1.e,  1.g,  1.h,  and  1.j  through  1.n.  He  acknowledged  SOR  ¶  1.b  as  an
equipment return charge. He attributed SOR ¶¶ 1.e. and 1.n to a third party for which he
had  cosigned  the  accounts  and  asserted  that  he  was  “trying  to  communicate  with  the
other party to get it figured out.” He attributed SOR ¶ 1.g to missing a payment and then
forgetting about it. He attributed SOR ¶ 1.h to being unable to afford the monthly payment
and asserted that he made payment arrangements to resolve it. He maintained that he
was not aware of the medical debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.j, 1.k, and 1.m. Without proffering any
corroborating  documents,  he asserted  that he  was  trying  to  settle SOR  ¶  1.b and  that
none  of  the  medical  debts  appeared  on  a  credit  report  he  reviewed.  He  provided  a
document  confirming  that he negotiated a  settlement  agreement  on  March  7,  2022,  to
repay $3,551 to resolve SOR ¶ 1.h via 24 monthly payments of $148, beginning April 1,
2022. There was no evidence of any payments in the record. (Item 3, 7)
Included  with  Applicant’s  interrogatory responses  was  a  pay  stub  dated  April 8,
2022  and  a  personal  financial  statement  (PFS)  dated  March  15,  2022.  The  pay  stub
revealed after-tax deductions for two loans. There was no other information in the record
about  these  loans.  The  pay  stub  showed  that  he  worked  the  following  year-to-date
overtime  hours: 57.90 time-and-a-half hours,  94.90 double-time hours, and  8.10 triple-
time hours. He also received a $1,500 award at some point. On his PFS, he reported a
net remainder of $291 and listed two monthly debt payments, a $868 auto loan, in current
status, and $147 for SOR ¶ 1.h. (Item 7 at 9)
Applicant reported four periods of unemployment on his SCA. He was unemployed
from February through May 2012 after he left his retail job to enlist in the Air Force. He
was unemployed from April through August 2014 following his relocation from State A to
State B. He was unemployed from January 2015 through June 2016 while he attended
school. He was unemployed from February through June 2017 after he left his job to focus
on school because his grades had been slipping. (Item 3)
