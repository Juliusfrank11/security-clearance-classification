Applicant  is  a  35-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  worked  in
security for his current employer or a predecessor company on the same contract since
December  2020.  He  has  a  General  Educational  Development  (GED)  high  school
equivalency diploma. He has never married. He has one child. (Tr. at 21-22; GE 1)
Applicant had periods of underemployment and unemployment when he did not
have  medical  insurance.  (Tr.  at  32-33;  GE  1,  3)  The  SOR  alleges  a  $9,966  auto  loan
that was placed for collection and 20 delinquent medical debts totaling about $10,560.
A  credit  report  from  February 2021  lists  a  $9,966  auto  loan  that was  placed for
collection (SOR ¶ 1.c) and 19 medical debts totaling about $9,523 that were placed for
collection  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.d-1.u).  There  were  no  other  debts,  such  as  credit  cards,  on
the report. The $64 medical debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b (addressed below) was listed on
a June 2022 credit report. (GE 4, 5)
Applicant  stated  that  he  cosigned  an  auto  loan  for  his  mother  in  about  2016.
They later became estranged, and he was unaware that she stopped paying the loan. It
is unclear if the vehicle was ever repossessed. All three credit reporting agencies listed
the loan on the February 2021 credit report as an individual account with a balance of
$9,966 (SOR ¶ 1.c). The activity date was January 2021. The loan is not listed on any of
the later credit reports. Applicant credibly testified that he thought it was a joint loan, but
he  admitted that  it  is possible that he  was  the  only one  placed on the  loan.  He  stated
that in either event, his mother had possession of the vehicle and was supposed to pay
the loan. (Tr. at 34-38; GE 4-6)
Applicant retained a law firm in about September 2022 to assist him in  verifying
the  accuracy  of  debts  on  his  credit  report  and  disputing  any  inaccuracies.  He  also
completed a financial counseling session. (Tr. at 18, 24-27, 40; Applicant’s response to
SOR; AE A-D, F)
The February 2021 combined credit report lists a medical debt in the amount of
$979, with a balance of $90 (SOR ¶ 1.t). The debt was assigned in 2018, but the activity
date  was  February  2021.  This  appears  to  indicate  that  the  debt  was  paid  down  from
$979 to $90. The debt is not listed on later credit reports. (GE 2, 4-6; AE F)
In about January 2022, Applicant paid a $56 medical debt that was not alleged in
the SOR. He paid $64 (SOR ¶ 1.b) and $78 (SOR ¶ 1.u) medical debts in September
2022. He testified that he paid a $393 medical debt. While he did not submit  payment
documentation,  a  $346  debt  (SOR  ¶  1.q)  is reported  by  TransUnion  in  February 2021
and September 2022, but not in January 2023. (Tr. at 39; GE 2,4-6; AE E, F)
The  June  2022  Experian  credit  report  (GE  5)  listed  the  paid  $56  medical  debt
and unpaid debts of $64 (SOR ¶ 1.b –  addressed above) and $938 (not alleged in the
SOR). There are no other accounts of any kind reported.  The November 2022 Equifax
credit  report  (GE  6)  listed  a  joint  auto  loan  that  was  opened  in  August  2022,  with  a
balance of $4,767, and a credit card account with Applicant as an authorized user. Both
accounts  are  current.  Applicant  submitted  credit  reports  from  all  three  reporting
agencies obtained in December 2022 and January 2023. The reports list the same joint
auto  loan  and  authorized-user  credit  card  as  listed  on  the  2022  Equifax  credit  report.
There are no other accounts with balances. (GE 4-6; AE F)
Applicant’s finances have stabilized. He lives a modest lifestyle. He is able to pay
his  current  bills  without  accruing  any  additional  delinquent  debts.  He  pays  $147  per
month on his auto loan, and he has some left over at the end of the month for savings
and other issues. (Tr. at 23-24, 40-41; GE 5, 6)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
January 2021. He  reported that he  had  a protective order issued against  him  in 2018,
but he answered “No” to all of the financial questions under Section 26, which included
the following:
In the last seven (7) years, [have] you had bills or debts turned over to a
collection  agency?  (Include  financial  obligations  for  which  you  were  the
sole debtor, as well as those for which you were a cosigner or guarantor)1
Applicant credibly denied intentionally falsifying the SF 86. He stated that it was
his first time filling out an SF 86, he did not have much help with it, and he filled it out to
the best of his ability. (Tr. at 17-21, 41-42; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1)
