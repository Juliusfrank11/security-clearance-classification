In  his response  to the SOR, Applicant admitted  SOR  ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.h, and
1.k., and he denied SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.i, and 1.j, all with brief comments.  His
admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 42 years old.  He has attended some college but has not earned a
degree. He has been employed with a large defense contractor since January 2004, and
he has held a clearance since 2015. He and his wife have been married since 2007. He
has two children and two stepchildren. (Item 3)
Applicant disclosed several debts on his SCA and he discussed them further in
his background interview. (Items 3, 6) His debts are established by credit reports from
September 2022 and March 2022. (Items 4, 5)
The SOR details 11 delinquent debts, totaling about $44,681. Applicant admitted
some  but  denied  others,  claiming  he  did  not  recognize  them.  (Item  2)  They  are
established  by  Applicant’s  admissions  and  by  the  credit  reports  in  the  record  from
February 2020, October 2021, and January 2022. (Items 5, 6, 7)
Applicant stated that SOR ¶ 1.f ($106), a charged-off debt to a financial institution,
had been paid after it went to collection. (Item 4)
SOR  ¶   1.g   ($11,941)  is  the   balance   owed   on   a   repossessed   auto.  Applicant
asserted  that  he  was not aware  of  any balance  owed  after the  repossession.  (Item  3  at
36) It  was initially charged  off  at  $26,617  but  the  amount alleged  is  the  balance  owed.
(Item  4)
SOR ¶ 1.a ($103) is an insurance bill placed for collection.  (Item 4) SOR ¶ 1.b
($7,838) an account placed for collection by a lender. (Items 4, 5) SOR ¶ 1.c ($575) an
account placed for collection by a phone or internet provider. (Item 4) SOR ¶ 1.d ($952)
an account placed for collection by a bank. (Item 4) SOR ¶ 1.e ($4,831) is an account
charged off by a financial institution. (Item 4) SOR ¶ 1.h ($1,569) is a gas credit card
account that has been charged off. (Item 4) SOR ¶ 1.i ($ 2,985) is a department-store
credit card account that has been charged off. (Item 4) SOR ¶ 1.j ($8,193) is an account
charged off by a bank. (Item 5) SOR ¶ 1.k ($5,561) is an account charged off by a credit
union. (Item 5)
For the debts he admits, Applicant said that they were incurred when his wife was
not  working,  so  he  was  the  sole  income  in  the  household.  He  used  credit  cards  and
check-cashing institutions when he was falling behind on his debts. (Items  2, 3, 6) He
provided his background interviewer some documentation of payments on non-alleged
debts. (Item 6)
For the debts Applicant denied, he said he did not recognize them. (Item 3) He
set  forth  no  plan  to  dispute  or  address  his  delinquent  debts.  He  provided  no
documentation of any payments or any details about any arrangements or agreements
to pay his debts, either through the debt relief company or to the individual creditors. He
provided no documentation to support his assertions in his background interview that his
financial stability has improved. The record did not indicate that he participated in credit
counseling through the debt relief company, or otherwise.
