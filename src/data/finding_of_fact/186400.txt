Applicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for

He has never married, and he has no children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 19, 28; GE 1)
Applicant had a sales job from 2008 to 2018 in which commissions were a large
part  of  his  compensation.  His  sales  declined  as  did  his  compensation,  and  he  had  to
find  another  job.  He  was  unable  to  pay  all  of  his  bills  and  several  debts  became
delinquent. (Tr. at 17-18, 25; GE 1)
Applicant paid or settled debts of $80; $1,148; and $1,994. (GE 4-6) These debts
were not alleged in the SOR as they were resolved before the SOR was issued.
The SOR alleges a $29,476 charged-off loan from a credit union and a $416 debt
placed  in  collection  by  a  cellular  telephone  services  company.  Applicant  settled  the
$416  debt for $249, which  was paid  on  December 27, 2022.  (Tr. at  23-24; Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 4-6; AE A)
Applicant borrowed about $32,000 from a credit union in 2016, which he used to
buy a boat. The loan was not secured, and there was no lien on the boat. He stopped
paying  the  loan  in  2018,  and  the  credit  union  charged  off  $29,476.  He  stated  that  he
contacted the credit union about the debt, but the credit union was unwilling to settle the
debt for less than the full balance, and it was unwilling to go beyond 24 months for him
to pay it. Applicant stated that he did not have the $1,400 per month that it would take to
pay the full amount over 24 months. He sold the boat for about $18,000. He did not use
any  of  the  proceeds  of  the  sale  to  pay  the  loan,  as  he  needed  the  money  for  living
expenses. (Tr. at 18-19, 24-29; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 4-6)
Applicant  did  not  file  his  federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  for tax  year  2018
when  they  were  due.1  He  filed  the  returns  in  August  2022.  He  does  not  owe  the  IRS,
and he is on a payment plan with his state. (Tr. at 29-32; GE 1, 2; AE B-D)
Except  for  the  unpaid  SOR  debt,  Applicant’s  finances  have  improved.  He
asserted  that  he  has  changed  his  spending  habits  since  2018  to  ensure  that  his
finances remain in order. (Tr. at 19-23, 27; GE 4-6)
