Applicant,   31,  has  worked   for  a   federal  contracting   company   since   November
2018.   He  served   in  the   Marine   Corps  from   June   2009  to   February  2017,  as  an
infantryman,  and   was  honorably  discharged.   He  deployed   twice  on   combat  tours.   He
was initially  granted  access  to  classified  information  while  on  active  duty.  He completed
a security  clearance  application  in  August 2019  and  reported some  derogatory  financial
information. The  ensuing  investigation  discovered  Applicant had  substantial delinquent
debt. The  SOR  alleges that  Applicant  owes  $36,977  on  11 delinquent  accounts.  (GE  1-
5; Tr. 36-37, 38)
Applicant’s financial problems began in April 2018 after he was fired for fighting
with  another  employee.  He  was  unemployed  for  seven  months.  As  a  result,  his
household  income  decreased  from  $53,000  to  $39,000.  To  make  ends  meet, he  used
personal  loans  and  credit cards  to  pay  his living  expenses. He did  so  knowing  that he
had  no  means of repaying the  debt  as he  incurred it.  (GE  1-2; Tr. 39-40, 41)
In   Applicant’s   current  position,  he   earns  approximately  $63,600   annually   after
taxes.  His  wife’s  income   has  also  increased,  and  their  household  income   is  now
$110,600.   He  began   working   on   the   resolution   of  his  delinquent   debts  in  April  2021,
using the proceeds from an employee referral bonus to  pay  the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶
1.d  ($3,096),  1.j  ($721),  1.k  ($2,338), and  one  non-SOR debt for  $1,272.  (This non-SOR
debt   is   the   same   amount   as  the   debt   alleged   in   SOR   ¶   1.f.   Though   it   has  not   been
established   by  the   record,  it   is  possible  it   is  the   same   debt).   He  also   set   up   an
installment  agreement   for  a   2020   tax  liability.  He  has  made   timely  payments  since
August 2021.  (GE 5; AE J; Tr. 44-45, 50, 52-53, 62, 64-65)
In January 2022, Applicant received a 100% disability rating from the Department
of  Veterans  Affairs.  As  a  result,  he  began  receiving  $3,400  per  month  in  disability
benefits. He has used the extra income to reduce his living expenses, pay unexpected
expenses  in  March  2022,  and  resolve  his  delinquent  accounts.  In  April  2022,  he  paid
SOR ¶ 1.h ($789). In May 2022 he paid another non-SOR debt for $3,000. (AE I) After
the  hearing,  Applicant  established  payment  agreements  for  the  accounts  alleged  in
SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 1.g, and 1.i. He paid off the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.g,
and 1.i according to the payment plans. He has not yet made plans regarding the debt
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f ($1,272). (Tr. 38, 40, 44, 51, 57, 62-63; AE B-F, H, J)
Applicant’s government client’s representative testified at the hearing. He knows
Applicant  personally  and  professionally.  The  witness  testified  that  Applicant’s  position
has  a  large  financial  component.  He  is  responsible  for  handling  hundreds  of  financial
mechanisms for the command he supports that value upwards of six million dollars. He
is often required to handle large sums of cash.  He has managed these responsibilities
without  issue.  The  witness  is  aware  of  the  security  clearance  concerns  related  to
Applicant’s finances and has no concerns about Applicant performing the financial tasks
related to his job. (Tr. 25-33)
Applicant’s  second-level  supervisor  also  testified.  He  has  a  personal  and
professional relationship with Applicant. He is aware of the financial concerns related to
Applicant’s  security  clearance.  Applicant  has  discussed  with  him  his  strategy  for
resolving  his  debt.  His  supervisor  believes  that  Applicant  lives  within  his  means.  He
testified that Applicant has not exhibited any behaviors that raises concerns about how
he manages his personal finances. (Tr. 18-24)
Applicant attributes a lot of his financial problems to a lack of knowledge. At the
hearing, he testified that upon separating from the military at age 27, he only knew how
to be an infantryman. He admitted that he is still learning how to manage his finances.
He and his wife, who welcomed their first child together in August 2022, have developed
a  written  budget.  They  have  adjusted  their  expenses  to  ensure  that  they  are  not
overspending. Going forward, Applicant intends to use his disability benefits to resolve
his  remaining  delinquent  accounts.  He  is  paying  the  smaller  accounts  first  and  then
moving on to larger accounts that require payment plans. (Tr.43-44,48, 56-58, 61)
