Applicant  is  a  33-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor  for  whom  he  has
worked  since  May  2014.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2015  and  has  taken
additional  college  courses  without  earning  another  degree.  He  has  never  married  and
has no children. (Items 3, 5, 8)
From  about  2009  through  December  2014,  Applicant  used  marijuana  with
varying  frequency.  From  about  2011  until  about  2014,  he  purchased  marijuana  with
varying frequency. During this timeframe, he used marijuana socially with friends and to
help him sleep at night. In April 2015, he claimed that he had no intention to use illegal
drugs  in  the  future.  Notwithstanding  this  marijuana  usage,  Applicant  was  granted  a
security clearance in about June 2015. He did not use illegal drugs between 2014 and
September 2019. In about September 2019, while he held a security clearance, he used
the illegal stimulant “Molly,” or MDMA, on one occasion with friends before attending a
concert.  He  volunteered  his  illegal  drug  use  in  his  two  Questionnaires  for  National
Security Positions (SF 86), discussed it openly with the investigator during his security
interviews in 2015 and 2020, and self-reported the September 2019 illegal drug use to
his facility security officer (FSO). He has not used an illegal drug since September 2019.
He claimed that he does not intend to use illegal drugs in the future. He acknowledged
that he has made some poor choices related to illegal drug usage in the past, but that
he has learned from his mistakes. He claimed that he understands that illegal drug use
is not compatible with holding a security clearance. He claimed that he has “cut virtually
all contact” with the friends with whom he used illegal drugs in the past. His reporting of
derogatory  information  regarding  his  illegal  drug  use  enhances  his  credibility  with
respect to these claims. (Items 2, 3, 5, 6, 8; FORM Response)
Applicant  failed  to  timely  file  his  2017  and  2018  federal  income  tax  returns
despite  being  required  to  do  so.  His  failure  to  timely  file  his  2018  federal  income  tax
return  was  not  alleged  in  the  SOR.  He  was  indebted  to  the  IRS  for delinquent  federal
taxes  in  the  amount  of  $1,100  for  tax  year  2017  and  $1,900  for  tax  year  2018.  He
reported this information on his SF 86. Any adverse information not alleged in the SOR,
such as Applicant’s late filing of income tax returns for the 2018 tax year cannot be used
for disqualification purposes; however, it may be considered in assessing an applicant’s
credibility;  in  evaluating  an  applicant’s  evidence  of extenuation, mitigation,  or changed
circumstances;  in  considering  whether  the  applicant  has  demonstrated  successful
rehabilitation; and in applying the whole-person concept. (ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3
(App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017)). (Items 2-5, 8; FORM Response).
Applicant filed his late 2017 federal income tax return with the IRS in September
2020.  He  filed  his  late  2018  federal  income  tax  return  with  the  IRS  in  March  2021.In
February  2021,  he  made  an  arrangement  with  the  IRS  to  pay  his  delinquent  federal
taxes  for  the  2017  and  2018  tax  years.  He  had  already  made  two  payments  on  his
delinquent federal taxes for the 2017 tax year in September 2020 and January 2021. He
satisfied his delinquent federal taxes for the 2017 tax year in July 2021. He satisfied his
delinquent federal taxes for the 2018 tax year in June 2022. He claimed that he did not
file his federal income taxes for the 2017 and 2018 tax years for several reasons, to wit:
he  was unfamiliar  with the process; he unknowingly failed to withhold  sufficient  wages
and incurred a larger tax obligation than he could afford; he had always received a tax
refund  in  the  past;  and  he  did  not  have  enough  money  to  pay  his  federal  taxes  in
addition to his other financial responsibilities. He claimed that he timely filed and paid all
his  federal  income  tax  obligations  before  and  after  the  2017  and  2018  tax  years.  His
reporting  of  derogatory  information  regarding  his  drug  usage  and  federal  tax
deficiencies during the clearance process enhances the credibility of his claims. (Items
