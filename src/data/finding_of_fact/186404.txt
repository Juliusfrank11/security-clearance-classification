In his answer, Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.e, and 1.h, and denied SOR
¶¶ 1.c, 1,d, and 1.g. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After review
of  the  pleadings,  testimony,  and  evidence  submitted,  I  make  the  following  additional
findings of fact.
Applicant is 59 years old. He was married in 2001, and has two children, one who
is a minor. He earned a associates degree in about 2008. He has worked for a defense
contractor for about 15 years as a designer of mechanical parts. (TR. 21-23; GE 1)
Applicant stated that he started taking college classes at a for-profit school in about
2006. He reported that he was working as a janitor at that time, and had a difficult time
earning enough money to support his family. He stated that the school recruiter induced
him to add extra courses to his studies to increase the value of his degree. He asserted
that  the  information  that  he  was  provided  was  false,  and  these  additional  classes  just
increased his costs. He reported that in 2008, he had to make a $9000 lump sum payment
to  the  school,  because  they  threatened  to  remove  him  shortly  before  he  earned  his
degree.  He  stated  that he  took  this money  from  his savings, and  it created a  financial
hardship for his family. (Tr. 24-25, 32-34, 41-43; GE 3, 4, 5, 6)
In 2022, the U.S. Department of Education approved $3.9 billion to discharge the
student loans for students who attended this school from 2005 through 2016, before it
was forced to shut down. Some of the reasons cited for the discharge were the lies and
false promises made to students, and that the school intentionally mislead students and
induced them to take student loans they would be unable to afford. (AE A, H, J)
Applicant stated that over the last ten years, his children have required expensive
medical treatment for chronic medical conditions. This treatment included surgery for his
daughter  in  2012,  and  a  medical  device  for  his  son  in  2016.  He  reported  that  these
unexpected medical expenses created a financial hardship for his family, and they were
unable to afford to pay the full costs of this medical treatment at the time it was obtained.
(Tr. 20, 23-25, 34-37, 44-46; GE 2)
The  SOR  alleges  about  $35,000  of  delinquent  debt.  This  includes:  $6,104  of
medical debt, $28,621 of student loan debt, and $908 for one consumer debt in collection.
The status of the allegations is as follows:
SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.f  are  medical  debts  in  collection  for  $108;  $108;  $1,138;  $3,800;
$715; and $235, respectively. Applicant claimed that ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b were for x-rays, ¶ 1.d
was for his daughter’s surgery, and ¶ 1.e was for his son’s medical device. He stated that
he could not discern the origin of ¶¶ 1.c and 1.f. He reported that he was unable to pay
all of the medical expenses up front. He claimed that he made some payments on the
surgery related debts debt until about 2016, and then was unable to afford regular monthly
payments.  He  claimed  that  he  called  the  creditors  to  set  up  a  payment  plan  but  was
referred  to  the  collection  agencies.  He  stated  that  when  he  contacted  the  collection
agencies,  he  found  that  they  had  inflated  some  of  the  balances.  He  claimed  that  he
contacted the original creditor to determine the origin of the additional charges, and they
told him that these charges were not part of their bill. Applicant stated that he came to
believe that the collection agency was trying to gouge him, and he stopped working with
them. At hearing, he was asked why he did not try to settle the medical debt for a lower
amount, and he stated that he did not know that he could do that. He stated that these
communications were done over the phone and that he does not have documentation of
the  contacts  with  these  creditors.  In  a  post-hearing  submission,  he  provided  a  receipt
showing a $1,200 payment for a medical debt, and a payment plan to pay $1,779 of  a
medical debt in $99 monthly installments. (Tr. 20, 23-25, 34-37, 44-46; AE E, I; GE 2, 3,
4, 5, 6)
SOR  ¶  1.g  is  a  debt  in  collection  to  a  cellular  phone  service  provider  for  $908.
Applicant denies this debt. He stated that he had had poor cellular service at his home,
and transferred his service to another carrier. He claimed that the original provider billed
him for a phone for which he had already paid. He claimed that shortly after receiving the
bill, he disputed the charge. He asserted that the provider never took action on his dispute
and  moved  the  debt  into  collection.  He  stated  that  he  has  no  documentation  from  the
dispute, because it was done over the phone. (Tr. 43-44; GE 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
SOR ¶ 1.h is a student loan in collection for $28,261. Applicant reported that after
graduation, he had a forbearance on his student loan repayments. He claimed that once
the forbearance ended, he made two monthly loan payments of about $600, and then the
monthly payment was raised to over $1,000 monthly. He stated that he was unable  to
afford this amount and stopped making payments. The record shows that the first major
delinquency for his student loans was in 2016, and they went into collection status. He
stated that in 2019, in an effort to resolve his delinquent debts, he requested forbearance
from  the  lender  to  remove  the  loans  from  collection  status.  In  2022,  Applicant  was
contacted by the Department of Education about the student loan discharge program for
former students from the for-profit school. He applied for discharge of his student loans,
and it was approved. This debt is now resolved. (TR. 24-25, 32-34, 37-40, 41-43; AE A,
H, J; GE 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
Applicant’s budget shows that he and his wife’s finances are stable, and they can
afford their monthly expenses. Their current monthly income exceeds their expenses by
about $1,000. (AE G)
Applicant  submitted  some  employment  records,  and  three  character  references
which state that he is a good and hardworking employee, involved in the community, and
is trustworthy. (AE B, C, D, F, K)
