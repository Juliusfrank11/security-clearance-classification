The SOR alleges that Applicant filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy petitions in June 2016
and November 2019 that were dismissed due to his failure to file required information,
and five delinquent debts, totaling approximately $37,288, including a mortgage past-due
in the amount of $23,288. In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in
SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.f, and 1.g, and denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.e with
explanation.
Applicant is 38 years old. He married in October 1998, separated in August 2018,
and divorced in May 2019. He has one child, age eight, and two adult stepchildren ages,
18 and 20, from his marriage. He is engaged and has resided in his fiancé’s home since
May 2020, they have one child, age one. His two youngest children reside with Applicant.
He attended technical school from March 2012 to October 2015 and has earned multiple
certificates. He has been employed as a technician for a federal contractor since October
2016  and  has  been  site  lead  since  June  2020.  He  held  a  security  clearance  while  on
active duty in the Navy. (GE 1; Tr. 37-51, 135-136)
Applicant served in the United States Navy from October 2002 to October 2013
attaining  the  paygrade  of  E-6  and  was  honorably  discharged.  The  stated  reason  for
separation  was  “Disability,  Severance  Pay,  Non-Combat”  and  he  received  “Disability
Severance Pay” of $70,148 when discharged. He completed extensive training and many
schools  while  in  the  Navy,  was  qualified  in  submarines,  earned  multiple  qualifications,
and received numerous awards and decorations. (AE D)
Applicant attributed his financial difficulties to severe back issues that resulted in
his medical discharge from the Navy  and unemployment/underemployment, and to his
former spouse’s financial irresponsibility, separation, and divorce. He testified that he was
bedridden for approximately 18 months before and after back surgery from sometime in
2013 until late 2014. He experienced significant back pain until a second surgery in 2015
alleviated most of his pain  issues and enabled him to obtain employment as a  federal
contractor. He reported being unemployed from September 2013 to January 2014. From
January 2014 to October 2014, he worked part-time doing administrative work for an auto
repair business earning $300 a week. He was employed as an installer or technician from
October 2014 to October 2016. (GE 1; SOR Response; Tr. 37-41, 40-56, 59-64, 73-85,

The evidence concerning debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below.
SOR ¶  1.a: mortgage  account  past due in amount  of  $23,238  with outstanding
balance of $204,193. Credit reports from  March 2019  and  April 2020 reflect the  account
as  past   due   for  $5,764   and   $23,238,  respectively.  In   response   to   the   SOR,  Applicant
admitted   the   mortgage   account  had   been   past  due,  but   said   it  was  then   current   and
submitted  evidence  corroborating  his claim. He  testified  that he obtained  the  mortgage  in
2008, that it was delinquent in approximately 2013  and  again in 2018. He attributed  the
2018  delinquency to  his  wife’s failure to  make  agreed  upon  payments while  they were
separated.  He  said  that he  was  unaware  that  she  missed  payments and  about  a pending
foreclosure  because account statements were  sent to her  address. After she  moved  out,
he returned  to  the  family home, and  filed  for bankruptcy in  November 2019  to  forestall
foreclosure.  He moved  in  with  his fiancé  in  May 2020  and  has paid the  mortgage  with
rental income  from  the  property  since. He provided  a  September 2020  loan  modification
agreement  and   account  statements  showing   payments  from   November  2020   to   May
2022. His balance  due  in June  2022,  included  the  required  monthly payment ($1,414.74)
and  one   overdue  payment  ($1,414.74).  This  account  is  being   resolved.   (GE   2-3;   SOR
Response;  Tr. 39-41, 44-48, 73-85, 124-126; AE B-C)
SOR  ¶1.b:   credit  card  account   charged  off   for  $3,738.   An  April  2020   credit
report  shows  the  account  as  charged  off  with  a  past  due  balance  of $3,738.  The  credit
report  reflects  delinquencies  in  2015   and   the   last   account  activity   in  October  2019.  In
response  to  the  SOR, Applicant admitted  the  account had  been  charged  off  and  said  that
he   was   attempting   to   settle  the   account.   He   testified   that  his   ex-wife   had   opened   the
account without his knowledge  using  a  power  of attorney  that he  had  previously provided
her,  and  thought  that he  had  paid  the  card off  in late  2021. He  provided  an  email  from  the
creditor dated  June  13,  2022,  stating  his credit  card  account  “was delinquent  with  a  $0.00
balance.”   This account  is  resolved.  (GE 3;  SOR Response; AE A  at 1;  Tr. 85-89, 121-
126)
SOR  ¶1.c:  credit  card  account   charged  off   for  $1,071.   A  March  2019  credit
report shows the account was opened in 2007 and charged off for $1,271 in February
2016.  An  April  2020  credit  report  reflects  the  account  as  charged  off  with  a  past  due
balance of $1,071. In response to the SOR, Applicant denied the allegation stating that
he thought the account had been paid. He testified that he had opened the joint account
with his ex-wife and thought he paid it off in approximately 2018. He provided a letter from
the  creditor  dated  June  23,  2022  stating  the  account  balance  was  $0.00.  This  debt  is
resolved. (GE 2-3; SOR Response; Tr. 89-92, 127; AE E)
SOR ¶1.d: credit account  charged off for $8,791.  A March 2019 credit report
shows the account was opened in November 2011, 2007, charged off for $8,791, and in
collection.  An  April  2020  credit  report  does  not  reflect  this  account  or  delinquency.  In
response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the account had been charged off and stated
that he was attempting return the account to good standing. He testified that he was first
delinquent on the account in about 2018 and had been making payments in accordance
with an agreement. He provided a letter from the creditor dated June 8, 2022, confirming
his  compliance  with  a  March  2021  payment  arrangement,  payments  made  totaling
$3,500, and an account balance of $5,291. This account is being resolved. (GE 3; SOR
Response; Tr. 92-94, 127; AE A at 3)
SOR  ¶1.e:  medical   collection   account   for  $450.   A  March  2019  credit  report
shows the account was assigned for collection in July 2017 with a balance of $450. An
April 2020 credit report does not reflect this account or delinquency. In response to the
SOR, Applicant denied the allegation and said that he paid the agreed upon copayment
for dental work, and later received a bill from the dentist. He said that he contacted the
collection agency and requested evidence the debt was legitimate. He testified that after
receiving  the  bill,  he  contacted  the  dentist’s  office,  that  they  agreed  with  him  and
demanded payment from his insurance company, that he had not been contacted about
the debt since, and that it was no longer on his credit report. I find that GE 2 corroborates
Applicant’s testimony that the debt was resolved. (GE 2-3; Tr. 94-96)
SOR  ¶¶1.f   and  ¶1.g:  Chapter  13   bankruptcies   filed  and  dismissed  in  June
Applicant admitted the allegations, stating that
2016,  and November 2019, respectively.
he filed the bankruptcies to prevent foreclosure on his family home after unsuccessfully
attempting  to  resolve  the  delinquencies,  and  after  being  advised  by  an  attorney  that
bankruptcy would forestall foreclosure. He said that he filed for bankruptcy in June 2016
to prevent foreclosure after his wife failed to make payments while he was bedridden. He
stated that the November 2019 bankruptcy filing was to prevent a second foreclosure on
the family home because his wife failed to pay her share of the mortgage in accordance
with their separation agreement, unbeknownst to him until he moved back into the home
in 2019. (GE 2, 4; SOR Response; Tr. 30-31, 37-39, 99)
Applicant testified  that  he  received  financial counseling  through  a  workshop  and
now  uses   a   digital  application   to   help  manage   his   budget.   He  said  that  his  financial
condition has improved. He reported  gross annual income  of  $56,000 (federal contractor
pay) with  net monthly earnings of approximately $2,800,  and $1,200  monthly  disability
payments (Department  of Veterans Affairs (VA) disability payments for 80% permanent
disability rating). After receiving  the  SOR, he  reported  developing  and  executing  a  plan
to  get his remaining  debts in order. He  reported  retirement savings ($9,159), a checking
account ($508), employer retirement account ($8,000) and  more than  $100,000  equity in
a home  purchased  in about  2010  and  occupied  by  his parents.  (Tr.  40-41,  51-52,  98,  127-
131;  GE 4, 5; AE A  at 4)
