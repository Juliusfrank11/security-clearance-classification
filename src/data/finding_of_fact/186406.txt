In  her answer,  Applicant  admitted all the  SOR allegations  with explanation.  Her
admissions  are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  review  of  the  pleadings,
testimony, and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 34 years old. She was married in 2013 and has one minor child. She
took college classes from 2007-2010. She resumed her studies in 2018, and earned a
bachelor’s  degree  in  2021.  Recently,  she  has  been  taking  classes  to  earn  a  master’s
degree. She served in the Navy from 2010-2018 and received an honorable discharge.
She has worked as a program analyst for a defense contractor since 2018. (TR. 22-26;
GE 1)
When  Applicant  left  the  Navy  in  May  2018,  she  was  unemployed  until  October
2018.  She  reported  that  in  2018,  her  husband  was  also  out  of  work  for  six  months.
Applicant claimed that she worked steadily from October 2018 until August 2019, when
her son, who was about two years old at the time, began having serious health problems
and required hospital care. She reported that she took a leave of absence from work until
his health stabilized, and she returned to work full-time in January 2020. She stated that
her employment continued until May 2020, when the contract she worked on ended. She
reported that she worked part-time for about three months, before she found a new full-
time project with her employer. (Tr. 27-35, 74-78; GE 1, 2; AE E)
Applicant stated  that the  unemployment events from  2018-2020  created  financial
hardship   and   caused   some   of  her  debts  to   become   delinquent.   Her  son’s  medical
treatments also created  new debt for the  family. Applicant asserted  that once  her and  her
husband’s employment  situation   stabilized,  she   started   to   resolve her   delinquent  debt.
(Tr. 27-35, 74-78; GE  1, 2; AE  E)
The SOR alleges about $35,000 of delinquent debt. The status of the allegations
is as follows:
SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c,  1.e, 1.g, and  1.h  are student loans in collection  totaling  $17,724.
The  original  loan  debt was for  about $44,000.  Applicant  claimed  that  she  stopped  taking
college  classes in  2010, shortly before  she  entered  the  Navy. Her student loan  records
show that  she  had  made  loan  payments while  in the  military,  but the  payments  stopped
in  2018,  and   she   entered   default  status.  She   claimed   that   because   of  the   financial
hardship that  she  faced  during  that time, she  was unable to  make  payments. In  March
2019, she  reported  that  her paycheck was  garnished  to  pay  her student loans. She  stated
that in  2021, she  was able to  make   some  voluntary payments on  her student loans to
bring   them   out  of  collection.  The   record  shows  that  these   loans   were   consolidated   in
March  2022,   are   no   longer in   collection.   The   consolidated   loans   were  entered   into   the
government  program   for  Covid-19   deferment   status   in  June   2022.  She   estimated   that
once  the  deferment period  ends, her payments will be  about $150  monthly. (Tr. 27-35,
45-53, 74-78; AE D, E, I; GE  3)
SOR  ¶¶   1.b   and   1.d   are  personal  loans   in   collection   for  $4,841   and   $4,219,
respectively. Applicant claimed  that these  are the  same  debt. The  credit report shows that
the  debts are from  the  same  creditor, and  ¶  1.d  appears to  be  a  duplicate  entry  from a
collection  agency  for  a  slightly  lesser amount. She  stated  that  she  took out  a  personal
loan  in  2015  to  help  pay for the  funeral expenses of  a  family member. She  reported  that
she   was  making   payments   on   the   loan   until  2018,  when   she   was   unable  to   afford  the
payments.  She  claimed  that this debt  is  paid, and  her 2022  credit report shows that  all
accounts with  this creditor have  no balance. This debt is resolved. (TR. 32, 53-59; GE 3,
5)
SOR ¶  1.f is a  credit card that was charged  off  for $2,917. Applicant  reported  that
she   stopped  making   payments  in 2018  due  to   financial  hardship. She  asserted   that  in
2021,  she  started  making  $50  monthly payments on  the  account,  and  the  record  shows
that the balance is down to  $475. (Tr. 32, 57-59; AE B; GE 3, 5)
SOR  ¶¶   1.i,  1.k,  1.t,  1.u,  1.v,   and   1.w  are  medical  debts  that  were   placed   for
collection. Applicant reported  that these  medical debts originated  during  her son’s hospital
care in  2019.  The  2021  credit  report shows that these  debts have  been  paid.  (Tr.32-33,
59-64;  GE  3, 4)
SOR ¶¶  1.o, 1.r, and  1.s are  medical debts placed  for collection  for $390, $164,
and  $134,  respectively. Applicant  reported  that these  medical  debts  originated  during  her
son’s  hospital  care  in   2019.  She   testified   that  she   has  made   $50   monthly  payments
towards ¶¶  1.o  and  1.r and  has paid  1.s. In  post-hearing  documentation  from  the  creditor,
the  account documentation  shows that she  has made  27  payments for medical debts to
this  creditor  from   January  2021   to   December  2021.  There  is  no   indication   in  the
documentation  that she  continues to  owe  a  balance  on  these  medical debts.  These  debts
are resolved. (Tr. 32-33, 59-64; AE H;  GE  3, 4)
SOR ¶  1.j is a  loan  that was placed  for collection  for $750.  Applicant  claimed  that
this  was   a   loan   to   cover  rent   and   that  it   has   been   paid.  However,   she   did  not   provide
sufficient documentation to substantiate  this claim. (Tr. 33-34, 65-66;  GE 3)
SOR ¶  1.l is a  credit card that was placed  for collection  for $734. Applicant claimed
that  she  paid  the  debt,  and  the  record  shows that it was  settled  in  October 2020. This
debt is now resolved. (Tr. 66-67; AE C;  GE  3)
SOR ¶  1.m  is a debt in  collection  for $713. Applicant stated  this was a  fee  from  a
home   rental  lease.   She   claimed   that   she   paid  it  in  2021,  but   did  not  provide   sufficient
documentation to substantiate this claim. (Tr. 33, 67; GE 3)
SOR ¶  1.n  is a  credit card that was charged  off  for $401. Applicant stated  that this
was her husband’s credit card and  that she  was only an  authorized  user. She  claimed
that the  debt was paid in  2021, however, she did not provide  sufficient documentation  to
substantiate her claims. (Tr. 67-68, 73; GE 3)
SOR ¶  1.p  was a  debt  in collection  for a  cable  tv  and  internet  provider for $233.
She  claimed  that it was paid in 2020, but did  not provide  sufficient documentation.  (Tr.
33, 68; GE 3)
SOR ¶ 1.q  is a debt to  a cellular phone service provider. Applicant claims that this
debt   was   for   a   phone   that   she   co-signed   for  her   sister,   who   needed   assistance.   She
reported  that her sister failed  to  meet her payment obligations, and  she  had  to  pay the
debt. The  record  shows that this debt was paid  in 2020. This debt  is resolved.  (Tr. 33-34,
68-70; AE  B; GE 3)
Applicant’s budget shows that her and her husband’s finances are stable, and they
can afford their monthly expenses. Their current monthly income exceeds their expenses
by about $1,000. (Tr. 37-45; AE J)
Applicant  submitted  two  character  references  which  state  that  she  is  a  talented
employee, a respected member of her community, and she is reliable and trustworthy.
