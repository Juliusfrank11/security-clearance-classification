In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a-f, and did not admit or
deny SOR ¶¶ 1.g-h, which were added by the Government in the FORM. SOR ¶¶ 1.g-h
will  be  treated  as  if  he  denied  the  allegations.  His  admissions  are  incorporated  in  my
findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  49-year-old  technician  employed  by  a  federal  contractor  since
September 2020. He graduated high school in 1987. He divorced in 2006 after 14 years
of marriage and remarried in 2007. He has three adult children, two minor children, and
one adult stepchild. He has never held a security clearance.
SOR ¶ 1.a as amended: Applicant’s 2022 bankruptcy filings show he failed to file,
as required, his federal income tax return for tax year 2016 and that this tax return remains
unfiled. (FORM Item 7 at 72.)
SOR ¶ 1.b as amended:  Applicant’s 2022 bankruptcy filings show he is indebted
to the federal government for delinquent taxes in the approximate amount of $56,121 for
tax years 2016 through 2021, and the taxes remain unpaid. (FORM Item 7 at 72.)
SOR ¶¶ 1.c-f: delinquent consumer debts totaling $6,171. Applicant admitted the
debts. He stated without documentation that he had started repayment on SOR ¶ 1.d. He
explained in his Answer that the creditors involved in SOR ¶¶ 1.c and e-f, would not work
with  him  during  his  period  of  unemployment,  and  the  debts  had  subsequently  been
charged off by the respective creditors. As a result of the charge-off, he concluded the
respective creditors had moved on. (FORM Item 2 at 1.) The October 2021 credit report
shows each debt as delinquent and in collection. (FORM Item 6 at 2-3.)

requests that his “financial hardship in 2017 as well as going through a pandemic” making
$15.54 hourly compared to his previous annually salary from 2008 to 2017 of $110,000
annually be considered. (FORM Item 2.) He disclosed on his SCA that he had not filed
