Applicant  admitted  all of  the SOR allegations  in  Answer  1.  She  is 47  years old,
single, and she has three children, all of whom are adults. As of the date of the hearing,
her children resided with her. (Answer 1; Tr. at 6-7, 23-26, 29-32; GE 1)
Applicant  obtained  her  general  education  development  (GED)  in  2009.  She
attended  a  community  college  from  2009  to  2015,  and  she  earned  an  associate’s
degree.  She  attended  a  four-year  university  from  2015  to  2019,  and  she  earned  a

The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  has  seven  delinquent  consumer  debts  totaling
$27,904  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.b,  1.e-1.i),  and  three  delinquent  medical  debts  totaling  $373
(SOR ¶¶ 1.c-1.d, 1.j). It also alleges that she filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in
June  2002 and  March 2012, and her bankruptcy cases  were  discharged  in  November
2002  and  June  2012,  respectively  (SOR  ¶¶  1.k-1.l).  The  SOR  allegations  are
established by Applicant’s admissions in Answer 1 and Answer 2, her 2019 SF 86, and
her  February 2020  and  April  2020  background  interviews.  A  credit  report from  August
2020  lists  the  debts  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.f,  as  well  as  her  2012  Chapter  7
bankruptcy case discharge. Bankruptcy records reflect both of her Chapter 7 bankruptcy
cases. (Answer 1-2; GE 1-8)
Applicant  attributed  her  delinquent  debt  to  raising  three  children  as  a  single
mother  with  significant  periods  of  unemployment  or underemployment.  She  raised  her
children in an area with a higher cost of living, instead of an inner city, so that they could
live  in  a  safe  environment  and  receive  a  quality  education.  She  stated  that  she  filed
Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2002, at age 27, because she lacked financial literacy, and her
mother  advised  her  to  do  so  to  avoid  wage  garnishment  and  to  wipe  her  slate  clean.
She  feared  the  impact  that  wage  garnishment  would  have  on  her  ability  to  raise  her
children.  Despite  her  2002  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  case  discharge,  she  accumulated
debts after she lost her job in 2009. She enrolled in college to obtain a degree so that
she  could  have  job  security,  but  her  debts  again  accumulated.  She  stated  she  filed
Chapter  7  bankruptcy  again,  in  2012,  for  the  same  reasons  that  she  filed  Chapter  7
bankruptcy in 2002. Her debts accumulated again beginning in 2015, when she became
a  caretaker  for  her  mother  at  various  periods  until  October  2018,  when  her  mother
passed  away;  when  she  moved  within  state  in  January  2017;  and  when  she  became
unemployed again  in February 2017.  She  stated that  she began  to  take  control of  her
finances  in 2019, and she has learned  that another bankruptcy would  denote financial
irresponsibility. (Answer 2; Tr. at 23-36, 62-70, 76-92; GE 1-2)
SOR  ¶  1.a  is  for  a  $20,907  charged-off  auto  account,  for  a  car  Applicant
purchased  in  2016.  She  fell  behind  on  her  monthly  car  payments  in  2018,  when  she
was  unemployed.  During  this  time,  she  also  began  having  to  pay  for  significant  car
repairs, and then her car’s engine failed. She could not afford to pay $5,000 to replace
her car’s engine, so she purchased another car, a used minivan, for $15,000. She could
not  make  the  car  payments  for  the  car  whose  engine  failed,  so  she  voluntarily
surrendered it. She unsuccessfully attempted to reach a payment arrangement with the
creditor,  both  before  and  after  she  voluntarily  surrendered  it.  In  Answer  2,  she  was  in
the  process  of  finalizing a  $2,090  settlement for this debt.  Documentation  reflects  that
she made a $2,094 payment in January 2022, and she settled this debt in March 2022.
Her October 2022 credit bureau report also reflects that this debt is settled. (Answer 2;

SOR  ¶  1.b  is  for  a  $5,048  charged-off  rent-to-buy  furniture  account.  Applicant
opened  this  account  in  approximately 2016  to  purchase  furniture  for  a  friend,  with  the
understanding  that  her  friend  would  be  responsible  for  the  payments.  She  bore
responsibility  for  the  account  after  her  friend  backed  out.  She  indicated  during  her
background  interview  that  she  could  not  afford  the  high  interest  rate  on  this  account.
She  stated  in  Answer  2  that  she  discussed  with  the  creditor  in  approximately  2022  a
settlement of $1,872 for this debt, which she intended to begin saving towards once she
tackled some of her other delinquent debts. This debt was still reported on her October
2022 credit bureau report. She intends to resolve this debt. (Answer 2; Tr. at 48-55, 82-

SOR  ¶¶  1.c,  1.d,  and  1.j  are  for  three  medical  debts,  for  $195,  $116,  and  $62
respectively.  Applicant believed her medical insurance covered her medical expenses,
and  she  was  unaware  that  these  amounts  were  outstanding.  She  stated  in  Answer  2
that  she  contacted  the  creditor  for  SOR  ¶  1.c  to  resolve  this  debt.  Documentation
reflects  that  she  made  a  payment  of  $50  toward  this  debt  in  February  2020.  She
intended to set up a monthly payment arrangement of $40 for six months to resolve the
remaining balance. She stated in Answer 2 that she pulled a copy of her credit bureau
report from each of the three major credit bureaus, but she could not locate the debt in
SOR  ¶  1.d.  She  testified  that  she  paid  $62  to  resolve  SOR  ¶  1.j.  Documentation
reflecting  that  she  made  a  $62  payment  in  February  2020  corroborates  her  claim.

she  used  this  card  for  gas  and  emergencies.  At  her  request,  the  creditor  closed  this
account in October 2021, because she could no longer afford to pay it. She stated in her
SF  86  that  she  reached  out  to  the  creditor  to  try  to  resolve  this  debt.  She  stated  in
Answer  2  that  she  made  a  payment  of  $547  to  resolve  this  debt.  Her  October  2022
credit bureau report reflects that this debt is “paid” with a zero balance. (Answer 2; Tr. at
57-60; GE 1-3; AE A)

background  interview  that  the  creditor  charged  her  for  two  items  from  a  catalog  order
that  she  did  not  receive.  She  accepted  responsibility
the  charges  after
unsuccessfully disputing them with the creditor. She stated in Answer 2 that she settled
this  debt  for  $120  and  she  was  awaiting  a  letter  from  the  creditor  stating  such.
