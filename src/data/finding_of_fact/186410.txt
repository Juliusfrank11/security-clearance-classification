Under  Guideline  F,  the  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  did  not  file  as  required  his
federal (SOR 1.a) and state (SOR 1.b) income tax returns for the 2018 tax year. It also
alleged that Applicant owed $41,185 for 22 delinquent or past-due debts (SOR 1.c – 1.aa).
Ten  of  the  debts  alleged  (SOR  1.c  –  1.h  and  1.x  –  1.aa)  are  for  unpaid  medical  bills
totaling $5,570. Three of the debts alleged (SOR 1.o – 1.q) are for unpaid student loans
totaling  $15,513.  The  remaining  12  allegations  (SOR  1.i  –  1.n  and  1.r  –  1.w)  address
unpaid commercial accounts totaling $20,615. In his Answer, Applicant admitted all of the
allegations  without  comments.  In  addition  to  the  facts  established  by  Applicant’s
admissions, I make the following findings of relevant fact.
At  the  outset,  I  resolve  SOR  1.a  and  1.b  for  Applicant.  In  his  July  29,  2021,
response  to  interrogatories  propounded  by  Department  Counsel,  Applicant  presented
substantial information showing he filed his 2018 and 2019 income tax returns in 2020.
Available information shows that the late filing of his taxes was an isolated event caused
by  circumstances  beyond  his  control,  that  he  has  otherwise  complied  with  his  tax
reporting obligations, and that he does not owe any unpaid taxes. (GX 2; Tr. 21, 34 – 35,
38 – 39, 49)
Applicant is 38 years old and is employed in an information technology (IT) position
by a defense contractor, for whom he has worked since August 2019 after a three-month
period  of  unemployment.  Except  for  brief  periods  of  unemployment  due  to  the  end  of
contracts,  he  generally  has  been  steadily  employed  since  about  July  2007,  when  he
completed  his  studies  at  a  technical  institute.  Since  November  2016,  he  has  worked
primarily for federal contractors. (GX 1; GX 2)
Applicant and his wife have been married since August 2010, but they have been
separated since August 2018. Applicant petitioned for divorce in February 2019, and  a
hearing to finalize their divorce is scheduled for the end of May 2023. Applicant and his
wife have two children, ages 16 and 10. Between 2018 and 2020, the children lived with
their mother and Applicant paid her $1,860 for monthly support. Applicant has had sole
custody of his children since then and his wife is now required to pay him the same for
monthly support. She satisfied that obligation through an involuntary wage garnishment
until August 2022, when she moved to another state. She now owes him about $7,000 in
unpaid support. (GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 25 – 27, 39 – 40)
Applicant  attributes  his  financial  problems  to  a  combination  of  the  effects  of  a
serious car accident in 2014, his estranged wife’s financial malfeasance while they were
together, and the expenses associated with their pending divorce. He also recently began
caring for and financially supporting his mother. (GX 2; Tr. 11)
During their marriage, Applicant’s wife did not work outside the home and did not
contribute financially. In 2017, Applicant started traveling for work three weeks out of each
month on average. While he was away, he had to rely on her to manage their finances;
however, in 2017 and 2018, she failed to pay their rent on time to such an extent that they
were evicted for non-payment from one residence and accrued significant late fees and
forfeitures  of  deposits  at  another.  Also,  during  this  period,  she  opened  several  credit
accounts under his name and neglected to pay them as required. When they separated
in 2018, Applicant had to fund both his own residence and a residence for his wife and
children. (GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 23 – 25)
On May 30,  2014, Applicant was injured in  a car  accident and was unable to work
for nine  months. He supported  himself and  his family through  workman’s compensation
payments and drawing on his savings. The medical and commercial debts alleged in the
SOR first became  past  due  in late 2014  and early 2015  because  of his loss of income  in
2014.  Additionally,   some   of   the   pain   medication   prescribed   for   Applicant   included
controlled  substances.  When  he  was  hired  by a  federal contractor in  2018,  he  was still
taking  some  of  those  medications  and  reported  his circumstance  to  his  facility security
officer  (FSO),  who   subsequently  reported   it   through   the   Joint   Personnel  Adjudication
System  (JPAS). This had  the  unintended  result of placing  a  hold on  Applicant’s ability to
obtain  a  security clearance. In  May 2019, Applicant was terminated  from  his employment
because  he   could   not get a   clearance.  He   was  unemployed  for the   next   three  months
before starting  his current job. His loss of income  along  with  his ongoing  separation  and
its associated  costs further adversely impacted  his  finances.  (GX 1; GX  2; Tr.  11,  22  –
23, 33)
Applicant  obtained  the  student  loans  listed  in  the  SOR  to  fund  his  tuition  for
technical school in 2007. Almost from the outset, he has been unable to consistently make
the required payments on those loans because he was not making enough money. He
last made a regular payment in 2010 or 2011. He communicated with his student loan
creditors  in  late  2020,  but  took  no  further  action.  He  again  contacted  his  student  loan
creditors in mid-2021 to see what federally-mandated relief might be available, and he
testified that he intends to submit an application for an Income-Driven Repayment (IDR)
plan. He did not produce any documentation to corroborate his claims in this regard. (GX
2; Tr. 30 – 31, 44 – 45)
In  April 2020, Applicant started  working  with  a  credit repair  firm  to  challenge  and
separate  his wife’s financial information  from his credit history. During  his May 21, 2020,
personal subject interview (PSI) with a  government investigator, he provided  information
about his monthly finances in which  he  claimed  he  was making  $730  debt payments,  but
he   did   not  specify  which  debts  were   being   paid  or  how  much.  That  summary  of  his
finances showed  he  still had  a  positive monthly remainder of about  $1,000. At hearing,
he  testified  that since  October 2022, he  has  paid  some  of  his  smaller debts,  such  as the
SOR 1.e, 1.f, and  1.g debts, which total less than  $100.  His testimony about  his monthly
finances showed  he  has about $2,000  remaining  each  month  after  expenses; however,
he  also testified  that legal fees and  other expenses related  to  his divorce  take  up  most of
his  remaining   money.  Applicant   did   not  submit   any  documentation   of   payments,
correspondence   with   creditors,  disputes   with   creditors,   or  other  efforts  to   address  his
debts. (GX 2; Tr. 21  –  22, 27  –  30, 34  –  35, 40  –  45)
