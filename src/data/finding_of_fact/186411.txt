In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  “admitted”  SOR  ¶  1.a,  but  he  provided  an
explanation that I construe as a denial. He denied SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c, and he admitted
SOR  ¶  1.d,  all  with  explanations.  I  incorporate  his  admission  to  SOR  ¶  1.d  into  the
findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  the  record
evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 28 years old. He has never married and has no children. He earned
a bachelor’s degree in computer information science in 2016. He has held multiple jobs
in  the  information  technology  (IT)  field  since  2017,  both  in  cleared  and  uncleared
positions. At times, including currently, he has held both full-time jobs during the week,
and second jobs, either at night, or on the weekends.
Applicant  began  working  in  IT  with  healthcare  Company  M  in  2017,  first  as  a
contractor, and then, as of March 2018, as a Company M employee. (Tr. 31-32, 50, 55-
57; GE 1) He initially worked on weekends during the day. Then he was asked to work
12  am  to  8  am  (Monday  nights  and  Tuesday  nights).  (Tr.  55-57)  His  departure  from
Company M in August 2019 is the subject of SOR ¶ 1.a, discussed below.
From  August  2018  to  about  December  2019,  Applicant  also  had  a  full-time  job
(Monday  to  Friday,  9  to  5)  with  federal  Contractor  I.  (Tr.  57-58;  GE  2)  After  his
clearance  was  granted  in  2019,  and  after  leaving  Company  M,  Applicant  was  also  a
self-employed  “1099”  contractor  with  Company  T  from  December  2019  to  February
2020 as a systems administrator. His departure from Company T is the subject of SOR
¶ 1.b, discussed below. (Tr. 48-50, 57-58)
Since March 2020, Applicant has worked a full-time, weekday job for Contractor
J,  a  defense  contractor  who  is  his  current  employer  and  clearance  sponsor.  During
much of this time, he has continued working nights as well, first with Company MS, from
January 2020 to July 2020; then with another government agency (AGA), from August
2020 to August 2021, when the contract ended. He briefly had a second job at a health
club.  Since  March  2022,  he  has  also  worked  a  40-hour  night  shift  job  outside  the
defense industry, with Company IM. He therefore currently works two full-time 40-hour-
a-week jobs. (Tr. 48-54, 111-112, 116; GE 2)
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges first, that Applicant falsified time records while he was working
at Company M, “representing that you worked hours that you did not work.” SOR ¶ 1.a
also  alleges  that  Applicant  “resigned  upon  being  advised  that  you  were  under
investigation for falsification of time records.”
Applicant admitted that,   “at [Company M], I did falsify time records”   by  “clocking
in hours where I wasn’t, while   I was not at the   job,” by  taking  advantage of the remote
clock-in system. (Tr. 32-34) He acknowledged that as an IT help desk professional, he
had a responsibility to be available to help those who sought assistance. He had been
able to leave early to go to his day job with Federal contractor I because he had a co-
worker  who  would  cover  for  him,  which  he  said  was  common  practice  in  IT.  An
investigation ensued when his practice was discovered, after the coworker who covered
for him was transferred to another location. (Tr. 34-37; GE 4)
Records  from  Company  M  showed  several  occasions  during  July  and  August
2019  when  Applicant:  a)  clocked  in  remotely  at  his  start  time,  but  actually  showed  up
15-30 minutes later; and b) left his job before 6 am, but clocked out about three hours
later, at about 8:30 am, at the end of his shift. (GE 3 at 9; GE 4, Tr. 39, 60-64)
Applicant  also  acknowledged  that  on  multiple  occasions  during  this  time,  he
falsified time records for an entire eight-hour shift, to make it appear that he had worked
40 hours a week, when he had only worked 32 hours. He did this for a period of about
two to three months in 2019 (Tr. 41-42, 58-59, 67-69, 110-111; GE 4) He acknowledged
that  he  was  essentially  stealing  from  his  employer  by  doing  so.  He  was  an  hourly
employee, and he said he did it to make more money. (Tr. 77, 110-111)
Applicant was confronted about his conduct in a phone call with his Company M
supervisors on Thursday, August 1, 2019. He said he was told that an investigation was
pending  and  was  told  to  turn  in  his  equipment  and  to  go  home,  which  he  did.  He
considered  that  he  was  essentially  suspended  because  he  could  not  work  without  his
equipment. (Tr. 89-90)
The  next  evening,  Applicant  received  a  text  from  a  co-worker,  who  had  heard
that  Applicant  had  been  terminated.  (AE  D,  AE  E,  AE  F)  Applicant  submitted  his
resignation the next day, on Saturday, August 3, 2019, apparently by e-mail but also by
fax. (GE 4) He had  not  heard confirmation  from  his manager “about being  let  go” before
he did so. (Tr. 33-34, 70-72, 88-89; Answer)
Applicant  acknowledged  being  told  in  the  August  1  meeting  that  he  was
suspended.  (Tr.  72-73)  He  also  acknowledged  being  concerned  about  his  job  status
after his friend texted him: “That’s when I took the, I guess, I just went forward [with] just
resigning because  I didn’t know and  I was worried, you  know, at that point. It was like,
race is on.” (Tr. 74, 75)
Applicant also asserted that had he not been told by his friend that he had been
terminated,  that  he  had  “every  intention  of  going  through  with  the  investigation”  and
returning  to  work  the  following  Monday.  He  acknowledged  that  he  resigned  before
confirming whether or not he would be fired. (Tr. 76, 88-89, 91, 93)
Applicant’s faxed resignation was received at Company M the following Monday,
August 5, 2019. In the letter, he gives no reason for his departure, which was “effective
immediately.”  His  resignation  was  confirmed  and  accepted  by  his  employer,  and
considered effective as of Saturday, August 3, 2019. (GE 4) GE 4 includes a company
“Record of Conference” about the August 1 phone call, prepared on August 5. There is
a  notation  that  Applicant  “resigned,”  but  he  did  not  sign  it.  Under  “Action  Taken  by
Supervisor,  the  box  marked  “Termination”  is  checked.  The  document  also  says
Applicant  “elected  to  resign  in  lieu  of  termination.”  (GE  4)  Applicant  said  he  was  not
aware of GE 4 until two years later. (Tr. 69-71)
SOR  ¶  1.b  alleges  that  Applicant  was  terminated from his employment  contract
with  Contractor T for falsification of  time  records  in  February 2020.  Applicant admitted
he was terminated but denied falsifying time records. Essentially, he questioned why he
would be so foolish as to do so soon after being terminated by Company M for doing the
same  thing.  He  said  it  would  have  been  “stupid  to  steal  time  and  defraud  the
Government of all places, to do that with my prior history.” (Tr. 42-44; GE 3 at 2)
From  December  2019  to  February 2020,  Applicant  was  a  self-employed  “1099”
contractor with Company T working as a systems administrator. He said that he had to
enter and exit the government facility with a common access card (CAC), and he had to
prepare a timesheet for his work.  He had  to log in and out on-site,  via  e-mail.  (Tr. 86,
118-121; GE 3 at 11-12) He said he left the job in part because he had been hired by
another employer, but also because he was terminated. He acknowledged he had been
terminated  following  an  allegation  of  falsifying  his  time,  but  he  denied  any  timecard
falsification. (Tr. 87, 95, 99-100, 104, 118, 121)
AE  B  is  a  text  exchange  between  Applicant  and  Ms.  L,  his  supervisor  at
Contractor T, between February 27 and March 17, 2020, after he had left. It concerned
the  company’s  need  for  him  to  provide  time  cards  documenting  the  hours  he  had
worked, as well  as Applicant’s concern about being  paid.  One  text from  Ms. L  says, in
part, “we are waiting for the government and [a related customer, P] to tell us how many
hours must be repaid. I will let you know as soon as I know. (AE B)
On March 27, 2020, Ms. L emailed Applicant and said,
“We   are  still   waiting   to   hear  from   [customer  P].   In   the   interim,  we   are
willing to pay you for the remaining 96 hours that you entered on [the time
card] as long as you reimburse us for any cost or refunds we may have to
pay  to  [customer  P]  if  they  request  a  refund  due  to  the  discrepancy
between   your  [  ]  timecard  and   the   Government’s  “badge-in  log.”   If   you
agree,  please   respond,  “Agreed”  to   this  e-mail  and  we  will  do  a  direct
deposit into the account we have on file on March 31, 2020. If not, we will
have to wait for [customer P] to respond before we pay you. Thanks.
Applicant responded minutes later: “Agreed.”
Ms. L then responded that “We will make a deposit on March 31, 2020.” (AE C)
Applicant then asserted to Ms. L that he should be paid based on a higher pay
rate,  effective  January  2020  ($3,672  total  instead  of  $3,096).  (AE  C)  He  testified  that
Company  T  paid  him  the  full  amount  he  requested.  (Tr.  44-45,  100-103)  Department
Counsel  acknowledged  that  there  was  no  record  evidence  of  a  timecard  discrepancy
beyond what was referenced in Applicant’s documents. (Tr. 104)
In reporting the circumstances of his August 2019 departure from Company M on
his September 2019 SCA, Applicant wrote the following:
I  resigned  due  to  wanting  to  free  up  time  for  my  family.  I  was  working  7
days a week with this job from Saturday to Monday. I now currently work 5
days a week. (GE 1 at 15; Tr. 79)
Applicant  answered  “No”  to  the  next  question  on  his  SCA,  asking,  as  to  this
employment,  if  he  had  been  fired,  quit  after  being  told  he  would  be  fired,  or  left  by
mutual  agreement  following  charges  or  allegations  of  misconduct,  or  notice  of
unsatisfactory performance. (GE 1 at 15)
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges that Applicant’s stated reason for leaving Company M and his
negative  answer  to  the  next  question  on  GE  1  were  deliberately  false.  He  asserted  in
his Answer and in his testimony that he had not lied because he had not been fired  nor
did he resign having been told he would be fired, and there was no mutual agreement
about the reason for his departure. (Answer)
At  his  hearing,  however,  Applicant  acknowledged,  that  his  given  reason  of
wanting   to   spend   more  time   with   his  family   “was  not  entirely   true.”  (Tr.  92)  He
acknowledged that, while he had not been terminated, he quit because of the rumor that
he would be fired. (Tr. 80-81) He denied that he left after a “mutual agreement” following
allegations of misconduct or poor performance. (Tr. 82-83)
When  Applicant  submitted  his  second  SCA  (GE  2)  in  June  2020,  he  did  not
change any of the information he had previously provided on his prior application (GE 1)
about his departure from Company M. (GE 2 at 19).  He acknowledged   that he   “glazed
over”   the   information   on   GE   2   and   did not review   it as closely as he should have. (Tr.
94) Falsification of that question on GE 2, as to Company M, is not alleged in the SOR.
In disclosing the job with Contractor T on GE 2, Applicant listed the name of his
supervisor, Ms. L, but did not list the name  of the company, and did not report that he
had been terminated. He wrote that he “left for new employment because I was hired for
an  entirely  different  job  than  what  my  employment  title  stated.  .  .  .”  (GE  2  at  16)  He
answered  “No”  to  the  next  question,  asking if  for  this  employment,  he  had  been  fired,
quit after being told he would be fired, or left by mutual agreement following charges or
allegations of misconduct, or notice of unsatisfactory performance. (GE 2 at 17)
SOR ¶ 2.d alleges that Applicant’s stated reason for leaving Contractor J and his
negative  answer  to  the  next  question  on  GE  2  were  deliberately  false.  In  his  Answer,
Applicant admitted the allegation, and said, “I honestly don’t know why I tried to conceal
this particular information, and it was stupid to try and do so, especially when I know the
truth. . .” He noted that he later volunteered the information to the investigator. He also
said  his  given  reason  was  not  “entirely  false”  since  he  had  another  job  that  he
interviewed  for  and  began  soon  thereafter.  (Answer)  When  asked  about  this  at  his
hearing,  he offered no excuse  and said it  was  a poor decision. He  acknowledged  that
his termination related to an allegation of falsified time cards, but he  again denied that
he did so. (Tr. 106-107)
Applicant  did  not  have  a  background  interview  after  his  first  SCA.  (Tr.  47)
Following  his  second  SCA,  he  was  twice  interviewed  in  July 2020.  During  the  second
such interview, he denied facing any disciplinary actions or suspensions in the previous
10 years, and he said he had not quit a job after being told he would be fired. He also
did not disclose his timesheet falsification at Company M until he was confronted about
it by the interviewer. (Tr. 84-85; GE 3 at 8-9)
Later  the  same  day,  in  July  2020,  Applicant  called  the  interviewer  and
volunteered that he had been terminated from Contractor T in February 2020 following
an  allegation  of  stealing  time.  He  said  he  was  removed  from  the  contract  after  the
government  contractor  compared  the  times  he  times  he  entered  and  left  the  building
with his CAC card against his timesheet and there were discrepancies. Applicant denied
the allegation that he had stolen time. (GE 3 at 11-12; Tr. 88, 107-109)
Applicant  earns  a  $102,000  salary  for  contractor  J  (full-time)  and  a  $74,000
salary  for  company  IM  (also  full  time).  His  two  jobs  are  about  20  miles  apart  in  the
suburbs of the large metropolitan area where he works.  (Tr. 111-112) He attested that
there is no risk of future recurrence. He said both employers know he works two jobs,
and  have  no  issue  with  it.  He  loves  his job  as  a  contractor with  the  AGA,  has  worked
there  for  almost  three  years,  and  has  had  no  disciplinary  issues.  Previously,  he
acknowledged that he was “trying to do too much.” (Tr. 113-114)
Applicant  said  he  has  learned  from  his  mistakes.  He  acknowledged  that  he  did
make good decisions at the time. He is maturing and trying to make better decisions. If
he is tired or overworked, he needs to cut back. It is not worth trying to cheat people. It
puts  his  team  in  a  bad  position  and  “that’s  not  right.”  (Tr.  127)  He  apologized  for  his
actions as he concluded. (Tr. 131)
AE A is a December 2019 email in which Applicant inquired about being rehired
by Company M. He was told there were no weekend positions available.
Applicant provided eight recommendation letters from references. All but one of
them  are  from  co-workers  and  supervisors  from  his  contractor  position  with  the  AGA,
including the office’s chief of staff, executive officer (a major general), a major, the chief
information  officer,  the  lead  IT  analyst,  the  chief  of  personnel,  and  an  executive
assistant. They attest that Applicant is exceptionally reliable and trustworthy, remarkably
dependable, and an innovative problem solver. He has integrity, and his  references all
endorse  his eligibility for a  clearance.  A final reference, from  a  job Applicant  held at  a
fitness center, also attested to his positive character and work ethic. (AE G – AE N)
