Applicant  is  30  years  old.  He  married  in  2012,  has  been  separated  since
approximately 2016, and was in the process of a divorce as of the date of the hearing. He
has been with his current partner since approximately 2016. He has three children, ages
9, 6, and 5; his two eldest children are from his first marriage and his youngest child is
from  his  current  relationship.  In  2021,  he  received  a  Bachelor  of  Science  in  business
administration. He enlisted in the United States Navy in May 2012 and was discharged in
April 2016, with a general discharge under honorable conditions. He has been the facility
security officer (FSO) and information system security officer for his current employer, a

The SOR alleged that Applicant has three delinquent debts totaling $26,045, and
he  admitted  these  financial  allegations.  Additionally,  the  SOR  alleged  that  he  was
arrested  in  May  2008,  charged  with  shoplifting,  larceny,  and  theft,  and  placed  in  a
diversion  program,  which  he  denied.  He  admitted  to  being  convicted  at  a  Navy  court
martial in 2016 for his involvement in a bank fraud scheme in 2013. Finally, he admitted
that he was terminated from employment in May 2018 for time-card fraud.
Applicant testified that his financial problems were the result of a six-month period
of unemployment after he was abruptly discharged from the Navy in 2016, following his
court martial. During that period, he received bi-weekly unemployment benefits of $900.
He spent half of that on his rent in State A, where he had been discharged, and half on
his  wife’s  rent  in  State  B,  where  she  lived.  Additionally,  his  Navy  rating  or  job  did  not
translate well into the civilian job market, making it difficult for him to find employment. He
was also unemployed from April to June 2017; May 2018 to January 2019, following his
termination  mentioned  above;  and  April  2021  to  October  2021.  He  owed  the  Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) approximately $10,000 for tax year 2017, for failing to pay taxes
on his unemployment benefits. He repaid this debt in 2020 and 2021, which affected his
ability to repay his other delinquent obligations. He also testified that his divorce attorney
cost  him  $3,500,  and  his  attorney  for  the  DOHA  hearing  cost  him  $4,000,  limiting  his
ability to repay his delinquent debts. (GE 1-3; Tr. 20-22, 40-43, 51-52, 57-60, 63, 78-79,
90)
SOR  ¶   1.a.  Applicant  purchased  a  vehicle  in  2012  for  $16,753.  The  monthly
payments  were  $309,  and  he  was  unable  to  make  payments  after  he  was  discharged
from the Navy. The vehicle was involuntarily repossessed. According to his 2020 credit
bureau report (CBR), the outstanding balance on the loan was $10,398, as alleged in the
SOR. In his 2017 SCA, he indicated he was “working towards paying back” this debt. He
told the government investigator in January 2019, that his intent was to repay this debt
and he was working to repay it. At hearing, he admitted that he does not know what his
intent is regarding this debt. Initially, he was planning to wait for the seven-year statute of
limitations to expire. His last contact with the creditor was in 2016, when the vehicle was
repossessed. His March 2022 CBR reflects that this debt was charged off in the amount
of $7,079. (GE 1; GE 3 at 8; GE 4 at 3; GE 5 at 2; GE 6 at 8; Tr. 20-22, 79-80)
SOR ¶  1.b. This was a  $4,635  personal loan  that Applicant opened  and  used  to
cover his expenses  while  he  was unemployed  following  his court-martial and  subsequent
discharge  from  the  Navy.  The  creditor sent  him  a  letter shortly  before the  hearing  that it
was willing  to  settle  the  account.  Following  the  hearing, he  provided  proof that he  paid
and  settled  the  account for $2,155.40. (GE  5  at 3;  GE  6  at  7; AE  A; AE  G;  AE  H; Tr. 22-
23, 81)
SOR  ¶   1.c.  Applicant  purchased  a  vehicle  for  his  wife  in  October  2015,  in  the
amount of $16,720. He was unable to continue to make the $365 monthly payments when
he was discharged from the Navy, and it was repossessed. According to his 2020 CBR,
the outstanding balance on the loan is $11,011. This debt does not appear in his 2022
CBR. (GE 3 at 8; GE 4 at 7; GE 5 at 2; Tr. 23, 82-83)
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  he  was  essentially  waiting  for  his  older
delinquent  debts  to  fall off  of his CBRs.  “Like  if  it  was  left  to  me,  if  I’m  being  honest,  I
would wait it out because of the fact that it’s no longer hitting my clearance. [I]t has to has
been close to seven years and I would wait it out.” In 2019, Applicant spoke to his mother’s
friend, a financial advisor (FA), at a family barbecue regarding the repayment of the debts
alleged in the SOR. He did not hire FA as his advisor. FA recommended to Applicant that
he wait out the seven-year statute of limitations for his debts. (Tr. 63-64; AE A)
In  May  2022,  just  prior  to  the  hearing,  Applicant  retained  a  credit  counseling
service  (CCS),  and  the  company  helped  him  create  a  budget,  but  due  to  his  pending
divorce, he was unable to follow it. Applicant’s starting salary at his current company was
$95,000, and he currently earns $109,000 annually. His partner earns $26 an hour and
works  36  hours  a  week.  The  budget  created  by  CCS  does  not  include  his  partner’s
income, and it indicates that he has a net monthly remainder of $3,148. He does not pay
any money in child support for his children, nor is he required to pay alimony to his soon-
to-be ex-wife. (AE B-C; Tr. 31-34, 53-54, 62, 72, 77, 84-86, 91)
SOR ¶  1.d. In 2008, Applicant was arrested and charged with shoplifting, larceny
and theft and consequently placed in a diversion program. He disclosed this incident in
his  2012  SCA.  In  his  Answer,  he  denied  this  allegation  and  indicated  that  he  did  not
remember  the  incident.  At  the  hearing,  he  again  stated  that  he  could  not  recall  the
underlying behavior or incident. (GE 2; GE 4; Tr. 25, 67-68)
SOR  ¶   1.e.   In  2016,  Applicant  was  convicted  at  a  court  martial  of  attempts,
conspiracy,  and  soliciting  another  to  commit  an  offense  for  his  role  in  a  bank  fraud
scheme. He was sentenced to 30 days in the brig. He admitted this allegation.
Applicant  told  the  government  investigator  during  his  January  2019  interview,
which he later adopted, without changes, that he received a Facebook message from a
man that he did not know. The man told Applicant that he did credit card fraud. Applicant
responded that he was straight; however, Applicant was from City X; therefore, “he knew
what the deal was.” Applicant told two of his Navy friends about the offer, and they were
interested. He then recontacted the man from Facebook and told him that his friends were
interested. When Applicant went home to City X, he gave the Facebook man his friends’
debit cards, and that was the extent of his involvement. A couple of days later, Applicant’s
debit  card  stopped  working.  When he  called his bank,  he  was  transferred  to  the  fraud
department, and he learned that he was involved with his friends’ cards being involved in
a fraud case. (GE 3 at 6)
At a May 2019 follow-up interview with a government investigator, Applicant told
the investigator that the man from Facebook was someone he knew from high school. He
also disclosed that he was aware that the individuals above were going to commit bank
fraud, he also indicated that he took cards belonging to six individuals to City X to give to
his high school friend. (GE 3 at 14)
In Applicant’s Answer, he wrote, “Someone from high school…reached out to me.
He told us that he generates check and that he could name some in our name to deposit
them. [B]ack then, neither of us had no clue what we were in for.”
At the hearing, Applicant testified that during his first year in the Navy, a friend from
high school contacted him and told him that he could generate checks for Applicant to
deposit into Applicant’s bank account. Applicant told his friends about it, and they decided
to do it with him. They all gave Applicant’s friend their “card” and online bank information.
He  said,   ‘Give  me   your  cards  and   online   info.  What  I’ll   do   is    --  I   make
checks.  I’ll   deposit  a   check.’  And   then   we   take   it   out  or  he’ll  take   it  out
because  he  has the  cards.  He’ll  take  it out and  then  he’ll take  his cut and
leave  my cut  on  and  send  my cards  –  send  our cards back. [T]hat was the
deal. (Tr. 70)
According   to   Applicant,   he   backed   out,   because   “it  seemed   a   little  fishy  –
suspicious…, meaning  I called  [my bank] kind  of cancelled  my card  and  everything. But
even  … with  doing  that –  even  with  backing  out,  the  Court felt like  –  well, not the  Court,
Naval Criminal Investigative  Service  felt like it  was still on  me  because if it wasn’t for me,
no  one  would have  been  doing  which  was correct.  Which is why  I chose  to  –  pled  guilty
to  solicitation  because  I did tell  my friends about it.” The  underlying  conduct occurred  in
2013, but the  sentencing  and  plea  was in 2016. He is unaware  of what the  consequences
were  for the  other sailors who  were  involved  in this criminal enterprise.  (GE  1-3;  Tr. 25-
27, 69-71, 83-84)
SOR ¶  2.b.  In May 2018, Applicant was terminated from his employment for time-
card fraud. At that time, he was working for a defense contractor. He was initially hired as
a data management specialist (DMS), but in August 2017, he started filling in for the FSO
who was on maternity leave. At that time, he was interested in obtaining a full-time FSO
position. He told the government investigator during his January 2019 interview that he
was fired for timesheet issues and attendance. He was logging more hours than he was
actually working in May 2018. He told the investigator that an example of this behavior
was that he would schedule an email to be sent to his manager two hours before leaving,
because he did not feel like walking back upstairs to his desk, but he disputed showing
up late for work. (GE 3 at 5)
In May 2019, Applicant was re-interviewed by a government investigator regarding
the  reasons  for  his  termination  in  May  2018.  The  investigator  confronted  Applicant
multiple times with developed information from the investigation regarding the issue of his
time  sheets.  He  admitted  to  the  investigator  that his behavior of not  reporting  his time
accurately was intentional. (GE 3 at 13-14)
Applicant testified that he started showing up late to work and leaving early, as he
was attending night classes. As a result, his then-employer gave him a verbal warning.
According to him, he was told that he was not supposed to be logging his hours as both
the  DMS  and  FSO,  but  he  was  not  aware  of  this  requirement  and  made  an  “honest
mistake.” (Answer; GE 3 at 5, 13; GE 7; Tr. 28-31, 48-49, 77-78)
Applicant’s former employer reported in a Defense Information System for Security
(DSS) report that Applicant had,
been  sending  false  emails to  his manager stating  he  was at work when  he
was  not.   Because   of   his  previous   attendance   issues,   [Applicant]   was
required  to  email  his manager when  he  arrived  and  departed  for the  day.
Last week his manager went to  ask him  a  question  and  he  [had] already left
for the  day, when  she  returned  to  her desk she  received  an  email  stating  he
was now leaving  for  the  day.  [Applicant]  was let go  on  May  1st  2018  at 2pm,
later that afternoon  his  manager received  an  email  stating  he  was leaving
for  the   day,  she   then   received   an   email   the   next   morning   May  2nd   2018
stating  that he  had  just  arrived  to  work, even  though  he  was terminated  the
day before.
Applicant provided two letters of recommendation. He is described as having a
strong work ethic and performing his duties well. According to his current employer, he
has fully disclosed his past misconduct and regrets his prior poor decisions. “[Applicant]
is capable of handling and managing any situation with thoughtfulness and maturity to
achieve the right decision.” (AE D; AE I; Tr. 35)
