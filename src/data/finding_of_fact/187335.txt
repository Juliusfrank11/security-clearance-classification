Applicant denied all the SOR allegations. He is 38 years old, married, and he has
one child. He obtained his general educational development certification in 2014. He was
unemployed from December 2008 to June 2012, and from September 2015 to January
2017. He worked as a laborer for the same DOD contractor from June 2012 to August
2015,  and  from  January  2017  to  December  2018.  He  has  worked  as  a  laborer  for  a
different DOD contractor since December 2018, through whom he is assigned to work at
shipyards throughout the United States. He has never held a security clearance. He has
resided in state A since 2013. (Answer; Tr. at 5-6, 8-10, 24-25, 48-52, 65-66, 75; GE 1,
5; AE A)
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  had  six  delinquent  student  loans,  totaling
approximately $25,539. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.f) The delinquent student loans are reported on
credit bureau reports from 2017 to 2020. They were not reported on credit bureau reports
from 2022. (Tr. at 40-43; GE 2-4, 7; AE A)
Applicant maintained that he was a victim of identity theft given that  he has not
attended school beyond high school, and never applied for student loans. He opined that
someone  must  have  stolen  his  identity  during  a  period  when  he  briefly  resided  with
acquaintances in approximately 2012 in state B ( where the student loans were incurred),
before moving to state A in 2013. (Answer; Tr. at 5-6, 25-48, 53-80; GE 1, 3, 5; AE A)
Applicant  first learned that  student loans were  incurred  in  his name,  without  his
permission, in 2013, when he began receiving telephone calls from a school located in
state  B  seeking  payment  on  the  loans.  He  communicated  with  the  school  and
unsuccessfully attempted to obtain further information about the individual who stole his
identity. He also telephoned the student loan creditor, who instructed him to file a dispute
with the credit reporting agencies. He also telephoned the state B police department and
attempted to file a report, but he was told he had to file a police report in person or online.
He recalled receiving a garnishment letter from the school, in approximately 2015, but he
did not recall whether his employer garnished his pay before he became unemployed that
August. He telephonically disputed the student loans with the credit reporting agencies in
2017, May 2019, and October 2019, and he was informed that they would send a dispute
letter to the school on his behalf. (Answer; Tr. at 5-6, 25-48, 53-80; GE 1, 3, 5; AE A)
In  2021, Applicant  attempted  multiple  times  to  file an  online  police  report with  the
state  B  police  department,  but his responses to  the  questions did not permit him  to  do  so,
and  he  was told  that he  had  to  file a  police  report in  person.  He went to  the  state  A  police
department and  attempted  to  file  a courtesy  police  report  with  state  B, but he  was told
that  he  could not  do  so. At one  point,  he  and  his spouse  discussed  hiring  an  attorney to
further   assist   him,  but   they  could   not   afford   the   attorney’s  fees   with   their   income.   He
intends to continue disputing these student loans on  his credit reports. (Answer; Tr. at  5-
6, 25-48, 53-80; GE 1,  3, 5;  AE  A)
During  his  background  interview,  Applicant  favorably  described  his  financial
situation. He indicated that he and his spouse, who worked as a nail technician, were able
to financially support their family. He does not have any other delinquent debts. He has
not received credit counseling. Since approximately 2002, he has worked with a credit
repair law firm to try to build his credit so he and his spouse can purchase a home. He
also monitors his credit through Credit Karma  (Tr. at 72-74; GE 5; AE A)
