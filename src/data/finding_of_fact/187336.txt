Applicant is a 58-year-old employee of a government contractor for whom he has
worked since August 2020. He was unemployed for about four months after he was laid
off  in  April  2020.  Prior  to  his  current  employment,  he  worked  for  another  government
contractor  from  2009  until  April  2020.  He  married  in  1997,  but  he  has  been  legally
separated  since  October  2019.  He  and  his  estranged  spouse  have  initiated  divorce
proceedings, but the divorce has not been finalized. He has a 20-year-old daughter. He
has  an  associate’s  degree,  has  taken  other  college  courses,  but  he  has  not  earned
another degree. (Tr. 12, 18-22, 46; GE 1, 6)
In the SOR, the Government alleged  Applicant’s 20 delinquent credit cards and
personal loans totaling approximately $141,000 (SOR ¶¶ 1.c-1.v). It also alleged that he
incurred  these  debts  because  of  gambling  losses  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b).  Applicant
admitted the SOR allegations.  His admissions  are adopted  as findings of fact. (Tr.  13,
16-17, 23-24; SOR; Answer; GE 1-6)
For  at  least  20  years,  Applicant  has  lost  a  significant  amount  of  money  while
gambling  at  casinos.  To  fund  his  gambling,  he  took  out  personal  loans  and  opened
credit  cards.  The SOR debts  are all a  result of  his gambling. He hid  his gambling and
the money he lost from his wife until about 2019. His gambling led to the breakdown of
his  marriage.  While  it  is  not  alleged  in  his  SOR,  he  also  borrowed  $10,000  from  his
sisters  to  fund  his  gambling.  He  was  delinquent  on  the  mortgage  for  his  marital
residence twice because of his gambling losses. Any adverse information not alleged in
the SOR, such as Applicant owing money to his sisters because of his gambling or his
mortgage delinquencies, cannot be used for disqualification purposes; however, it may
be  considered  in  assessing  an  applicant’s  credibility;  in  evaluating  an  applicant’s
evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances;  in considering whether
the  applicant  has  demonstrated  successful  rehabilitation;  and  in  applying  the  whole-
person concept. (ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017)). He has not
taken any financial counseling or counseling for his gambling problem. He signed up for
counseling for his gambling problem in early 2020, but it was cancelled because of the
pandemic. He acknowledged that he signed up for this gambling counseling because he
realized his security clearance was in jeopardy. (Tr. 25-33; 44-46, 50; Answer; GE 1, 6)
Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  has  a  problem  with  gambling,  but  he  claimed
that  he  will  not  gamble  again.  He  tried  to  stop  gambling  before  but  failed.  As  of  the
DOHA  hearing,  he  last  gambled  in  December  2022,  when  he  went  to  a  casino.  He
acknowledged  that  part  of  the  reason  he  has  not  been  gambling  as  much  is  that  he
does not have the money to do so. In May 2022, he entered into an agreement with a
debt  consolidation  company  to  pay  off  his  SOR  debts.  He  paid  the  debt  consolidation
company a little over $1,000  for disbursement to the SOR creditors. However, in June
2022, he withdrew from the agreement because he wanted to pay back the $10,000 he
owed to his sisters first. He provided no evidence that any of the money he provided to
the debt consolidation company was disbursed to creditors. He provided no documents
to  corroborate  his  dealings  with  the  debt  consolidation  company  or  any  payments  to
creditors  made  on  his  behalf.  He  claimed  that  he  plans  to  work  with  a  credit
consolidation  company  again  to  pay off  his  delinquencies.  (Tr. 16-17,  22-23,  32-38, 50-
51;  GE  1-6)
Applicant claimed that he satisfied the debt in  SOR ¶ 1.f through an involuntary
garnishment on an unspecified date. He provided no documentation to corroborate this
information  and  the  Government’s  credit  reports  do  not  reflect  that  this debt  has  been
satisfied.  The  2023  credit  report  reflects  a  lower  balance  than  the  SOR.  I  find  he  is
resolving the debt in SOR ¶ 1.f through an involuntary garnishment.  Except for the debt
in  SOR  ¶  1.u,  he  has had no  contact  with  any  of  the  creditors of the  SOR debts.  The
creditor for the debt  in SOR  ¶  1.u  contacted him  in  about  November  2022,  but he  did
not  make  a  payment  arrangement  because  he  did  not  have  enough  money  to  do  so.
Except for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.f, he has not resolved any of the SOR debts. He claimed
that in about December 2022, he paid his sisters back the $10,000 he owed them. He
did not corroborate this claim with documentation. (Tr. 39-46, 50; GE 1-6)
