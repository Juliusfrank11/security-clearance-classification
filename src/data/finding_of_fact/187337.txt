In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.m and denied SOR
¶  1.n.  His  admissions  are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and
careful  review of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the  following  additional
findings of fact.
Applicant  is  46  years  old.  He  married  his  current  spouse  in  February  2013  and
divorced his first spouse in May 2013. (Item 3 at 17 and 18.) He served on active duty in
the U.S. Navy from 1996 to 2016 and retired with an honorable discharge. (Item 3 at 14.)
He noted he had not attended schools in the last ten years and had not received a degree
or diploma going back more than ten years. In July 2016, after retiring from the military
he became a boat driver for his sponsor. He was granted a Secret clearance while in the
military. He currently does not hold a clearance.
Applicant’s  fourteen   delinquent   debts  total  over  $54,346.  The   debts  are
established  by  three  credit reports,  and  his response  to  DOHA  interrogatories. (Items 4-
7.) None  of the  debts are reflected  on  his SCA. (Item  3.)  The  specific debts in the  SOR
are as follows:
SOR  ¶¶   1.a-1.b:  past-due  accounts  charged-off  for  $14,309  and  $13,390
respectively  from  the  same  lender.  Applicant  notes  in  his  Answer  that  he  was  in  the
progress of resolving SOR ¶ 1.a. In his response to interrogatories, he marked that both
debts were paid but then marked that no documentation was provided to show that either
debt was paid. (Item 7 at 1.) FORM Item 4, a June 30, 2022 credit report, does not show
either debt.  A July 1, 2020  credit  report shows  the status of both debts as closed and
charged off, with a last activity date of December 2013. (Item 5 at 2.)
SOR ¶  1.c: past-due account placed for collection in the amount of $616. The June
30, 2022 credit report shows the last activity was in February 2017. (Item 4 at 3 and Item
5 at 2.) Applicant admits the debt and notes “corrected” without explanation  in his SOR
Answer.
SOR ¶  1.d: past-due account placed for collection in the amount of $567. The June
2022 credit report and the July 2020 credit report show the last activity was in December
2016. (Item 4 at 4 and Item 5 at 2.) Applicant admits the debt and notes “corrected” without
explanation in his SOR Answer. In his response to DOHA interrogatories, he marked that
the debt had not been paid but that pay arrangements had been made and that he was
making  payments  but  did  not  provide  documentation  to  show  proof  of  payment  or  the
current status of the debt. (Item 7 at 3-4.)
SOR ¶  1.e: past-due account placed for collection in the amount of $315. The June
2022 credit report and the July 2020 credit report show the last activity was in December

shows the account charged-off. (Item 6 at 2.) The debt is not reflected on the most recent
credit report, Item 4. Applicant admits the debt and notes “progress” without explanation
in his SOR Answer. In his response to interrogatories,  he  did not mark either “paid” or
“not  paid”  but  marked  that  payment  arrangements  had  been  made  and  that  he  was
making payments. He also marked “no” to  whether  documentation of proof of payment
was provided. (Item 7 at 2.)
