Applicant admitted  all the SOR allegations. She is 34  years old. She married in
2015 and separated in January 2019. She has three minor children, all of whom reside
with her; the eldest child is from a previous relationship and the two younger children are
from her marriage. She obtained her general educational development (GED) certification
in 2006, and a dental assistant certification  in 2010.  Her employer also paid for her to
attend an apprenticeship program from 2019 to 2020, but she was unable to complete it.
She worked at a grocery store part time from January 2008 to April 2009, and then she
was unemployed until October 2009. She then worked at a pizzeria part time until April
2014, and then she was unemployed for a second time until September 2014. She has
worked for her employer, a DOD contractor, since February 2018. She was first granted
a security clearance in approximately 2020. (Answer; Tr. 2 at 5, 7-9, 25-31, 62-67, 69-73,
86-87; GE 1-2)
The  SOR alleged  that Applicant  filed  Chapter  7  bankruptcy in  October 2018, and
her bankruptcy  case  was dismissed  in  December  2018. (SOR  ¶  1.a)  It  also  alleged  that
she  had  four  delinquent consumer debts totaling  $14,069  (SOR ¶¶  1.b, 1.e, 1.i, 1.l), and
nine  delinquent medical debts totaling  $4,375   (SOR ¶¶  1.c-1.d,  1.f-1.h, 1.j-1.k,  1.m-1.n)
The   SOR  allegations   are  established   by   Applicant’s   admissions   in  her   Answer,  her
December 2020 security clearance  application (SCA),  her  January 2021  interview with a
background  investigator, two  credit bureau  reports from  2020  and  2021, and  a  bankruptcy
court record.  (Answer; GE 1-5)
Applicant attributed her financial difficulties to her financial illiteracy; her periods of
underemployment and unemployment; being the sole provider for her children after she
separated from her spouse; her health issues; and her lack of health insurance. The first
time she had health insurance was during a three-month probationary period through her
employer  between  2017  and  2018.  She  unsuccessfully  attempted  to  work  with  her
creditors, and then she made a hasty decision to file Chapter 7 bankruptcy to try to resolve
her debts. She withdrew her petition after her mother advised her that proceeding with
bankruptcy could negatively affect her ability to purchase a home in the future. She sought
help from Credit Karma in 2019, but she elected to apply the money she would have paid
for their services to her debts. Her income increased and she obtained health insurance
through  her  current  employer,  and  she  was  working  to  resolve  her  financial  issues.  In
November 2022, she entered into an agreement with a consumer advocacy law firm, to
whom she paid  $60 monthly,  for help with  verifying her debts and repairing her credit.
She  intended  to  resolve  all  her  debts.  (Tr. 2  at  31-35,  42, 47,  57,  59-61,  69-73,  87, 89-93,
96-99; GE  1-5; AE B)
SOR  ¶  1.b  is  a  $6,588  charged-off  account  for  the  balance  due  on  Applicant’s
vehicle.  She  purchased  this  vehicle  in  approximately  2016,  and  it  was  involuntarily
repossessed in 2019 because she failed to make her payments. In approximately 2022,
she settled this debt for approximately $1,800. She has since made monthly payments of
$100, and her updated balance as of January 2023 was $757. Once she pays this debt,
she intends to apply the money she used to pay this debt to tackle her remaining debts.

SOR  ¶¶  1.c-1.d,  1.f-1.h,  1.j-1.k,  and  1.m-1.n  are  Applicant’s  delinquent  medical
debts, which total $4,375. The most recent credit bureau report from 2021 lists only SOR
¶¶ 1.c and 1.d. She made a payment towards her medical debts in January 2022, but the
amount of her payment is not in the record. She testified that she paid SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d,
1.k, 1.m and 1.n between January and March 2022, through a $1,500 loan she received
from her mother that she has since repaid. In early 2022, she also spoke with the creditor
for SOR ¶¶ 1.f, 1.g, and 1.h, and she informed the creditor that she intended to pay these
debts as soon as she had the financial means to do so. (Answer; Tr. 2 at 41-51, 56, 59,
74; GE 2-4; AE C)
SOR ¶ 1.e  is the  $6,878  balance  due  on  Applicant’s  second vehicle, which was
also involuntarily repossessed in 2019 because she failed to make  her payments. She
purchased this vehicle after her first one was repossessed, as discussed above, because
she  needed  another  vehicle.  Her  wages  are  being  garnished  since  approximately
November 2022 to resolve this debt. (Tr. 2 at 51-55, 67-68, 88-89; GE 2-4)
SOR ¶ 1.i is a $400 account in collection. The 2020 credit bureau report does not
reflect  the  type  of  account  this  is.  Applicant  did  not  know  what  this  debt  was  for.  She
unsuccessfully attempted to locate this creditor online. She was unaware that she could
try to locate the creditor’s contact information through her credit bureau reports, and she
intended to do so to resolve this debt.  (Tr. 2 at 47, 55-58; GE 4)
SOR ¶ 1.l is a $203 insurance account in collection. Applicant did not know what
this debt was for, but she learned when she contacted  the creditor that it was incurred
before she married. She testified that she paid this debt in early 2022. (Tr. 2 at 43, 58-59;
GE 4)
Applicant was initially a shipboard handler when her employer hired her in 2018,
and  her  annual  salary  was  $25,000.  She  has  been  promoted  annually,  and  she  was
promoted to a technician several months before the hearing date. Her annual salary as
of  the  date  of  the  hearing  was  $41,000.  Her  net  monthly  income  was  approximately
$2,600. She also received $700 monthly in Social Security benefits from her eldest child’s
father. She has around $23,000 in a retirement savings account. She utilized her bank’s
mobile application to track her expenses. She has not received credit counseling, but she
intended  to  determine  whether  her  employer  offered  such  counseling  and  a  financial
literacy program. She was current on filing her federal and state income tax returns. She
incurred  approximately  $9,000  in  student loans when  she  obtained  her 2010  certification,
but they  had  been  deferred  and  she  intended  to  contact  the  creditor to  discuss  repayment
options.   Her  manager  of  three   years  attested   to   her  trustworthiness  and   reliability.  He
noted   that  she   was  his  “go   to   person,”  and   she   was  recently  nominated   for  shipyard
worker of  the  year  for her outstanding  work ethic and  work quality.  (GE 1; Tr.  2  at 29-31,
