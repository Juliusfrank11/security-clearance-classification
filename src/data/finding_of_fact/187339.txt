In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted all of the allegations. His admissions are
adopted  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  review  of  the  pleadings  and  evidence,  I  make  the
following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He began working at
his present job in December 2005. Before that he served in the U.S. Navy for nine years,
after which he was honorably discharged. He has an associate’s degree. He is married
and has four adult children, three who still live at home and who he supports financially.
He has held a security clearance without incident for approximately 27 years. (Tr. 6, 17,
30; GE 1)
The  SOR  alleged  16  delinquent  accounts  (credit  cards)  totaling  approximately
$96,500. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.p) The debts are established by credit reports from March 2022
and April 2020; and his SOR admissions. (GE 2-3; Answer to SOR)
Applicant’s  financial  difficulties  can  largely  be  attributed  to  some  major  issues
related  to  his  wife’s  behavior.  Sometime  after  2010,  his  wife  became  addicted  to
prescription  pain  pills.  It  is  unclear,  but  apparently  she  was  arrested  on  drug-related
charges. Applicant struggled to support the family during this time. His wife went to drug
rehabilitation at some point, paid for by Applicant. In  addition  to  his wife’s drug  issues,
she  ran  a  day  care  center  out  of  her  home  and  was  charged  with  felony  child
endangerment (no further information provided) in approximately 2017. Applicant stated
he  was  forced  to  use  the  family’s  financial  resources  to  pay  his  wife’s  bail  bond  and
attorney’s fees resulting from the felony charge. He estimated that these expenses totaled
approximately $40,000-$50,000.  He used  credit  cards  to  fund these  payments.  Before
these expenditures, he had a total balance owed on all his credit cards of about $45,000.
(Tr. 17, 20, 22)
He has settled three credit card debts as described below (SOR ¶¶ 1.g, 1.i, and
1.o), but he has failed to make any efforts to pay or contact any of the remaining creditors.
His rationale for inaction was that some of the debts were past or near the state’s statute
of limitations and are, or will become unenforceable. With this in mind, he did not want to
start paying towards these debts and restart the clock if he might lose his job because his
clearance was not granted. So, he did nothing toward paying those debts. He contacted
an attorney about the possibility of filing for bankruptcy protection, but he decided against
pursuing  that  option  because  he  did  not  know  how  that  might  impact  his  security
clearance. (Tr. 18, 23-24, 28-29; AE A1-A7)
