Applicant  is  a  54-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  The  company  is
sponsoring her for a security clearance, but she is essentially on unpaid leave pending
her  security  clearance  adjudication.  She  has  worked  part-time  at  another  job  since
January  2023,  but  she  expects  to  return  to  the  defense  contractor  if  she  receives  a
favorable result. She has associate degrees that she earned in 2009 and 2010, and she
is  close  to  obtaining  a  bachelor’s  degree.  She  married  in  1986  and  divorced  in  1990.
She married again in 1998 and divorced in 2004. She has three adult children. A fourth
child passed away. (Tr. at 18-24; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1)
Applicant  has  worked  on  the  same  military  installation  for  different  contractors
since  about  2012.  She  was  periodically  laid  off  when  there  was  no  work  or  when  a
contract  changed.  When  that  occurred,  she  would  fall  behind  on  her  debts  and  then
attempt to pay them when she returned to full-time employment. (Tr. at 19-24; GE 1-4)
The SOR alleges two defaulted student loans totaling $98,958 and 12 delinquent
debts  totaling  about  $17,000,  except  the  $1,188  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.e  and  1.k
are duplicates. The SOR debts are listed on a May 2021 credit report, an August 2022
credit report, or both credit reports. The $1,842 and $2,190 debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.d
and  1.l  appear  that  they  may  also  be  duplicates,  with  the  $2,190  debt  listed  on  the
August 2022 credit report with a $0 balance.
The May 2021 credit report listed that Applicant paid or settled delinquent debts
of $1,073, $182, $275, $144, $811, and $206. These debts were not alleged in the SOR
because they  were resolved before the SOR was  issued. Other debts resolved before
the SOR was issued include a $944 debt (SOR ¶ 1.g) that was paid in September 2021,
a $327 debt (SOR ¶ 1.i) that was paid in June 2021, and a $522 debt (SOR ¶ 1.j) that
was settled and paid in April 2018. The $300 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.m has been paid.
Applicant paid $50 to a collection company for an unidentified debt in March 2023. (Tr.
at 32-37, 41; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1-4; AE A, C-I)
Applicant  consolidated  her  student  loans  in  2017.  They  became  past-due  at
some point. She stated that  she attempted to address them in 2020, but she was told
that they were on hold because of relief associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. That
hold has been extended several times and is currently in effect until at least June 2023.
She is in the process of applying for an income-driven relief plan. She credibly testified
that she intends to pay all of her debts. She intends to keep her part-time job after she
returns  to  work  for  the  defense  contractor  and  use  the  extra  money  to  pay  her  debts.
