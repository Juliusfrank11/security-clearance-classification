Applicant  is  a  46-year-old  employee  of  a  government  contractor.  Except  for  a
week  in  August  2022  when  he  relocated,  he  has  been  continuously  employed  since
2005. He was divorced twice and remarried in 2012. He has two children, ages 19 and
18, and an adult stepchild. He served on active duty with the Army from 1995 until 2000,
when he was honorably discharged because of a medical disability. (Tr. 23, 66; GE 1, 6)
In   the   SOR,   the   Government  alleged   Applicant’s  32   delinquent   debts   totaling
approximately $16,500   (SOR  ¶¶   1.a-1.ff).  SOR  ¶¶   1.a-1.c,  1.e-1.g,   1.i-1.k,   1.s,  and   1.t
are  consumer   accounts.   The   remainder   of   the   SOR  debts   are   delinquent   medical
accounts.   The   delinquent   consumer   accounts   total   about  $10,000.   These   consumer
delinquencies   consist   of  vehicle   loans,   credit  cards,  personal  loans,  and   unreturned
satellite   TV   equipment.   The   delinquent   medical  accounts   combine   for  a   total  of   about
$6,500.   Applicant   admitted   the   SOR   allegations,   except  for  SOR   ¶¶   1.c,   1.g,   1.j,   1.s,
and   1.t,  which   he   denied   without   additional  comment.   His   admissions  are  adopted   as
findings of  fact.  Despite   his denials  of the  allegations  in   SOR  ¶¶   1.c,  1.g,  1.j,  1.s,   and
1.t,  those  allegations  are established  by the  Government’s 2018, 2019,  2020, 2022,  and
2023  credit reports.  (Tr. 61-64; SOR; Answer; GE  1-9)
Over the last decade, Applicant and his wife had significant, often life-threatening
health  issues.  In  November  2013,  Applicant  tore  his  Achilles  tendon  and  missed  a
month  and  a  half  of  work.  In  2014,  Applicant’s  wife  had  heart  issues,  causing  her  to
faint.  After  about  six  months  of  missed  diagnoses,  doctors  correctly  diagnosed  her
condition and inserted a pacemaker. Applicant and his wife lived in a remote area, so,
on three occasions, she had to be medevacked by helicopter to a hospital that had the
capability  to  treat  her  heart condition.  As  a  result  of  this health  issue,  she  lost  her  job
and has not had a job that paid as much since. In 2015, Applicant’s appendix burst. His
heart stopped twice, but doctors were able to revive him. He was in a coma for 28 days.
He missed about 70 days of work. In 2017, his wife was once again medevacked  to a
hospital for what doctor’s believed was a ruptured appendix, where she was treated for
five days. Each medevac flight cost tens of thousands of dollars that was not covered by
insurance. While these debts are not part of the SOR as they are his wife’s, Applicant
has been using his income to pay them off. In August 2020, his wife was diagnosed with
stage  four  lung  cancer  which  required  chemotherapy  and  radiation.  She  has  been
unable  to  work  to  contribute  to  the  household  finances  since  that  cancer  diagnosis.
While he and his wife had health insurance throughout this time, the cost of uncovered
treatment,  along  with  the  ancillary  costs  of  travel  and  missing  work  has  overwhelmed
them. (Tr. 24-25, 27, 35, 39-43, 66-67; Answer; GE 1, 5)
In about 2019, Applicant hired a bankruptcy attorney to resolve his debts through
a  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  petition.  After  following  his  attorney’s  advice  and  allowing
creditors to repossess two vehicles, his bankruptcy attorney told him that he made too
much money to file Chapter 13 bankruptcy, so he decided not to file. (Tr. 36-39; 41-42,
61-64; GE 1)
Applicant claimed that he took his current position working in Country A because
he  would earn twice as  much  money as he has ever earned  in his life.  He planned to
use  the  additional  wages  to  pay  his  delinquent  SOR  debts.  He  began  working  his
current job in about August 2022. For the first five and a half months after he started his
new job he earned about $3,600 per month. He was living in a hotel in the U.S and was
not  yet  earning  his  overseas  pay.  In  about  December  2022,  he  began  working
overseas.  Since  then,  he  has  been  earning  about  $10,000  per  month.  He  has  about
$300  in  a  savings  account  and  about  $2,000  in  a  checking  account.  He  has  about
$2,000  to  $3,000  in  a  retirement  account.  (Tr.  24,  32-36,  39-41,  46-49,  60-62,  73-74;
Answer; GE 5)
For  the  last  year  and  a  half  to  two  years,  he  has  been  paying  down  his  wife’s
medical  debts  through  a  debt  consolidation  company.  He  has  been  paying  $150  per
month through an automatic bank account debit. Applicant thought he was also paying
down  his  own  debts  but  recently  learned  that  his  debts  were  not  part  of  the
consolidation plan. The record is silent as to why his debts were not included or when
he  learned  this  information.  He  claimed  he  will  include  his  debts  in  the  consolidation
plan and begin paying them back immediately.  As of his DOHA hearing, he had yet to
make any payments on his SOR debts. With exception of the SOR debts listed below,
he  has  not  attempted  to  contact  creditors  or  credit  reporting  agencies  to  resolve  the
SOR debts. Except for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.t, he has not resolved any of the SOR debts.
(Tr. 24, 32-36, 39-41, 46-49, 60-62, 73-74; Answer; GE 5)
Applicant claimed  that  he  contacted  the  creditor  for  the  debts  alleged  in  SOR ¶¶
1.g   and   1.j   once   about  two   months  ago   and   again   about  two   weeks  ago.  He  claimed
that he  has paid  this debt. He  claimed  there  is a  miscommunication  between  the  local
and  the  national offices of this creditor whether he  has paid this account.  He  provided
no  documents to  corroborate  this payment or  his efforts to  resolve his dispute.  Applicant
claimed  that  he  contacted  the  creditor of  the  debt  listed  in  SOR ¶  1.f  a  week  before  the
DOHA  hearing   to   make   payment arrangements,   but he   could not   reach  an  agreement
with  them.  On  an  unspecified  date, he  claimed  he  contacted  the  creditor in  SOR ¶  1.t  to
attempt  to  resolve  that  debt. He  claimed  the  debt  was for  satellite  TV  equipment that  he
claimed   he   returned.   He  provided   no   documentation   to   corroborate   his  attempt  to
resolve  this  debt.   However,  based   on   his   testimony,  I  find   that  he   returned   the
equipment. This debt is resolved.  (Tr. 49-58, 61-63)
Applicant has three delinquent debts on his credit reports that are not listed in the
SOR. In the last week, he contacted the creditor of two of these debts and one of these
creditors  contacted  him.  He  did  not  make  any  payment  arrangements  with  these
creditors  or otherwise resolve  these  debts.  Any  adverse  information  not  alleged  in  the
SOR,  such  as  Applicant’s  additional  financial  delinquencies  cannot  be  used  for
disqualification  purposes;  however,  it  may  be  considered  in  assessing  an  applicant’s
credibility;  in  evaluating  an  applicant’s  evidence  of extenuation, mitigation,  or changed
circumstances;  in  considering  whether  the  applicant  has  demonstrated  successful
rehabilitation; and in applying the whole-person concept. (ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3
(App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017)). (Tr. 49-60)
Applicant  claimed  that  prior  to  receiving  his  SOR,  he  did  not  believe  that  his
financial  delinquencies  would  affect  his  security  clearance.  He  claimed  that  in  about
November 2022, his employer  inaccurately told him that his clearance application  was
approved.  Based  upon  this  inaccurate  information,  he  thought  he  had  more  time  to
resolve his financial delinquencies to avoid any ill effect on his security clearance. (Tr.
70-72)
Applicant  provided  a  character  reference  letter  from  his  work  supervisor.  His
supervisor  opined  that  Applicant  is  honest,  responsible,  and  reliable.  He  noted  that
Applicant  does  well at  work and  is very professional.  He  believes Applicant  should  be
granted a security clearance. (AE A)
