Applicant denied all the SOR allegations. He is 56 years old. He married in 1987,
separated in 2017, divorced in 2018, and remarried in 2019. He has two adult children, a
son and a daughter. He earned an associate degree in 1988 and a bachelor’s degree in
1997.  He  has  worked  for  various  DOD  contractors,  both  in  the  United  States  and
overseas, since 2010, except for periods of unemployment from December 2011 to April
2012 and January 2014 to August 2014. He has lived and worked overseas as a system
administrator  for  his  employer  who  is  a  DOD  contractor,  since  2017.  He  and  his  ex-
spouse have co-owned a home in the United States since 1996, and she resides in the
home. He has never held a security clearance. (Answer; Tr. at 28; GE 1-2)
The SOR alleged that Applicant has a $54,203 charged-off student loan. (SOR ¶
1.a)  It  also  alleged  that  he  failed  to  file,  as  required,  his  federal  and  state  income  tax
returns for tax years (TY) 2019 and 2020. (SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.c) Applicant’s delinquent  student
loan  is  listed  on  credit  bureau  reports  from  September  2020  and  April  2021,  and  he
discussed  it  during  his  January  2021  interview  with  a  background  investigator.  He
reported his failure to timely file his relevant income tax returns  in his November 2021
response to interrogatories. (Tr. at 18-; GE 2-4)
In approximately 2011, Applicant co-signed with his daughter the student loan at
issue, with the understanding that she  would be responsible for repaying it. When she
graduated from college, she told him that she was repaying the student loan through a
repayment plan. He was unaware that the student loan was delinquent until he began to
receive email correspondence from the creditor in approximately 2019. He then contacted
his daughter and reiterated to her that the loan was her responsibility. He also told her to
communicate with the creditor to request a forbearance, since she was unemployed at
that  time.  She  told  him  that  she  would,  and  she  also  informed  him  that  the  creditor
permitted her to remove him as a co-signer from the loan. (Tr. at 18-25, 31-32, 34-45; GE
2-4; AE A)
Documentation  from  the  creditor  reflects  that  in  September  2019:  the  creditor
informed Applicant’s daughter that she  was solely responsible for the  loan; the  creditor
released the cosigner from all future responsibility for repayment of the loan; Applicant’s
daughter was solely responsible for repaying the loan; and the outstanding balance was
$41,753. Applicant relied on this information and believed he was no longer responsible
for his daughter’s student loan. He disputed the student loan with the three major credit
bureaus.  The  December  2022  credit  bureau  reports  reflect  that  his  disputes  were
successful, and the credit bureaus deleted the loan from his credit reports. (Tr. at 18-25,
31-32, 34-45; GE 2-4; AE A)
Applicant attributed his failure to timely file his relevant federal and state income
tax returns to his move overseas in 2017, his inability to locate documents necessary for
filing those returns, and his misunderstanding after speaking with an IRS representative
that he was able to file his federal income tax returns every three years so long as he did
not owe taxes. His tax accountant filed these income tax returns between January and
February 2022. He timely filed his income tax returns for TY 2021 and 2022, and he did
not owe taxes.  He understood that he was legally required to file his federal and state
income  tax  returns  annually,  and  he  expected  to  file  his  future  income  tax  returns
accordingly. (Answer; Tr. at 25-27, 32-33, 46-51)
As  of  the  date  of  the  hearing,  Applicant  earned  $130,000  annually,  or
approximately $9,000 monthly. He also received $500 monthly in rental property income.
His  spouse owned  their residence, but he contributed to  the household expenses.  His
estimated monthly net remainder, after expenses, was approximately $3,000 to $5,000.
He  had  approximately  $22,000  in  his  savings  account  and  $175,000  in  his  retirement
savings accounts. He received financial counseling in approximately 2008. He does not
have any other delinquent debts. (Tr. at 27-34, 36, 45-46; GE 3-4; AE A)
