submitted his first security clearance application (SCA). Prior to this position, he worked
for non-government employers and was unemployed at times. (Item 3)
In his SCA, Applicant disclosed a history of alcohol abuse and criminal conduct,
which is set forth below:
1.a:  In August 2007, Applicant was arrested and charged with Driving Under the

license was suspended for 30 days. (Item 2)
1.c: In August 2009, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI and Refusal to
Submit to a Preliminary Breath Test, both misdemeanors. He failed to appear in court in
February 2010 and a warrant was issued for his arrest. (Item 2)
In April 2013, Applicant was convicted of DUI. He was sentenced to 12 months of
probation and ordered to pay a fine. He was required to attend and complete an alcohol
and drug treatment program, participate in Alcohol Anonymous (AA) meetings, install an
interlock device, and complete a DUI victim panel class. (Item 2)
In accordance with the terms of the court’s April 2013 order, Applicant participated

program, he attended AA meetings and group sessions. (Item 4)

his arrest. (Item 2)
In   April 2018,  Applicant   was  served   with  an   arrest  warrant  and   was   additionally
charged  with  Possession  of Marijuana  and  Use/Possession  with  Intent to  Use.  In  June
2018, he  pleaded  guilty  and  was convicted  of DUI (2nd  conviction) and  Incapable  of Safely
Driving. The  marijuana  possession  charge  was dismissed. He was sentenced  to  five  days
in  jail. (Item  8  at  22, 24)  After serving  his jail time, he  was placed  on  reporting  probation
for 12  months  or until such  time  as  he  completed  all  probationary conditions.  He  was  also
fined  and  required  to  attend  a  DUI victim  panel and  an alcohol  education  class. (Item  8  at
23-25)
1.e:   In  January  2019,  Applicant  was  charged  with  Violate  Driver  License
Restriction, No Valid Driver’s License in Possession, and Speed-30 MPH. He was also
charged with violating the probation that was imposed in June 2018. He denied the driver
license charges. He waived his right to a probation violation hearing and agreed to serve
two  days  in  jail  for that  infraction.  The driver license  charges  were dismissed,  and  the
speeding ticket was reduced to a lesser violation. He pleaded guilty to that violation and
was fined. (Item 2, Item 8 at 28)
1.f:  In April 2019, Applicant was charged with Tampering with an Ignition Interlock
Device.  He  denied  the  charges  but  was  required  to  serve  two  days  in  jail  because  he
violated the terms of his June 2018 probation. In May 2019, the tampering charge was
dismissed  because  at  the  time  of  the  arrest,  he  was  no  longer  required  to  have  an
interlock device.
On  June  27,  2019,  the  court  entered  an  order  releasing  Applicant  from  the
probation that was imposed in June 2018. (Item 8 at 29)

or relationships. (Item 4 at 9)
In   interrogatories  that   Applicant   signed   in  February  2022,  he   reported   that  an

from  alcohol consumption.  He  stated  he  was diagnosed  as  a  “social  drinker.”  (Item  4  at

court   and   while  he   was  on   probation   between   2013   and  2014.  He  is not   attending  AA
meetings   or   other  recovery  programs.   (Item   4   at   21)  Applicant   also   disclosed   in   his
interrogatories  that he  continues to  consume  alcohol once  or twice a  week, and  drinks
two  to  five  beers each time.  (Item 4  at 20) In  his August  22,  2022  Answer, he  stated  that
he  has not been stopped  or charged with  an  alcohol-related  offense since  2014. (Item 2)
