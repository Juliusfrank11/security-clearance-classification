After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 51 years old, married (since September 1993), and has an adult son
and an adult daughter. He is a high school graduate. He served in the Inactive Reserve
of  his  state’s  Army  National  Guard  from  June  1990  until  June  1994,  when  he  was
honorably discharged. Since March 1990, he has worked for a defense contractor. (Item
3.)
Guideline F
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant has 16 delinquent debts totaling
about $36,000, a total that includes a $12,550 debt for state taxes (2016, 2017, and 2018).
(Item  1.)  Applicant’s  credit  reports  (8/2020,  3/2021,  6/2022)  support  the  Guideline  F
allegations.  (Items  5  through  7.)  He  admitted  SOR  ¶1.a,  a  voluntary  car  repossession
($11,612), and SOR ¶ 1.p, the state tax allegation.  For the latter, he said he is paying
$500 per month to pay it off; the balance is $5,300. He provided documents showing his
paycheck deduction for the tax debt but none showing the balance due. His payments
are under an involuntary tax levy. He denied SOR ¶ 1.b ($468), because “I have not seen
a  collection  letter.”  He  denied  medical  accounts  SOR  ¶¶  1.c  through  1.n  ($5,800
combined),  because  he  has  “not  seen  collection  letters.”  He  denied  SOR  ¶  1.o,  a
consumer debt ($8,615), because he does “not recall this collection.” (Items 2 and 8.)
Applicant’s financial problems began in 2011 when his wife lost her longstanding
government  job.  The  medical  accounts  are  for  his  wife’s  medical  condition.  Her  lost
income was aggravated by a “health issue that caused her not to have a stable income.”
(Items 4 and 8.)  The record supports the Guideline F allegations. (Items 4-8.) During his
September  24,  2020  Personal  Subject  Interview  (PSI),  Applicant  said  his  delinquent
accounts would be paid, settled, or satisfied within 60 days of the PSI, or he would file for
bankruptcy. (Item 8.) Neither has occurred. (Items 6 and 7.) His collection accounts show
last activity dates in the summer of 2020 and became delinquent at that time. (Items 4
through 8.)
Applicant submitted a Personal Financial Statement. It showed a total net monthly
income  of  $8,820.  After  expenses  and  debt  service,  his  monthly  net  remainder  was
$1,985. (Item 4.)
Guideline E
Under Guideline E, SOR ¶ 2.a alleged that although Applicant answered “yes” that
he had accounts that were in collection or charged off, he failed to disclose the specific
information  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.n.  (Item  1.)  He  admitted  that  allegation,
stating  that  over the  “last  few years my  wife  and  I have  been  trying  to  reconcile  these
issues . . . looking for a good solution on a re-fresh program or possibly bankruptcy . . . .”
(Item 2.)  In his SCA, he disclosed the state tax delinquency, its estimated amount, and
when it will be paid off. (Item 3.) In his PSI, he testified in some detail about the delinquent
debts that were ultimately alleged in the SOR. (Item 8.)
Law and Policies
It  is  well  established  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.  As  the
that  security
Supreme  Court  held,  “the  clearly  consistent  standard
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.” Department of the Navy
v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).
indicates
When  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability
for  a  security  clearance,  an
administrative  judge  must  consider  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  These  guidelines  are
flexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the
whole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a
decision.  The  protection  of  the  national  security  is  the  paramount  consideration.  AG  ¶
2(b)  requires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  national
security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.”
Under  Directive  ¶   E3.1.14,   the   Government   must  present  evidence   to   establish
controverted  facts alleged  in  the  SOR. Under Directive ¶  E3.1.15,  then  the  applicant  is
responsible  for presenting  “witnesses and  other evidence  to  rebut,  explain, extenuate, or
mitigate  facts admitted  by applicant or proven  by Department Counsel. . . .” The  applicant
has the  ultimate  burden of persuasion in seeking a  favorable security decision.
