Applicant  denied  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  through  1.c.  He  admitted  SOR
allegation  ¶  1.d.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and
testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  43-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed  with  the  defense  contractor  since  May  of  2007.  He  has  held  a  security
clearance since June of 2007. He is divorced and has two minor children.  (TR at page
11 line 24 to page 13 line 6, and GX 1 at pages 7, 14, 19~20, 22~23 and 42.) Applicant
attributes some of his alleged financial difficulties to his former spouse, from whom he
was divorced from in July of 2020.
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
The SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted to three creditors totaling in excess of
$65,000. It also alleges that Applicant filed for the protection of a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy
in 2016.
1.d. Applicant admits that he filed for the protection of a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy in
2016, and that his debts were subsequently discharged by said bankruptcy. (TR at page
19 lines 3~23, and GX 2.)
1.a. Applicant denies that he has a past-due debt to Creditor A in the amount of
about  $48,000.  He  admits  to  a  $22,000  past-due  debt,  which  he  began  to  address  in
June of 2022 (AppX L) and made his first monthly payment of $457 towards in August
2022 (AppX N), only a week prior to his hearing. (TR at page 13 line 16 to page 15 line
24,  and  at  page  25  line  14  to  page  28  line  17.)
I  find  Applicant’s  response  to  this
significant past-due debt to be too little, too late.  From his testimony it is clear he was
aware of this debt, but only began to address it about four months after the issuance of
the SOR. (AppX L.) This allegation is found against Applicant.
1.b. Applicant denies that he has a past-due debt to Creditor B in the amount of
about  $16,000.  His  former  spouse  had  agreed  to  pay  this  motor  vehicle  loan;  and  as
such,  Applicant  was  unaware  of  this  past-due  debt  until  he  received  the  SOR.  (TR  at
page 15 line 22 to page 17 line 15.) He has satisfied this debt prior to his hearing, as
evidenced by documentation. (AppXs J, K and M.) This allegation is found for Applicant.
1.c. Applicant denies any knowledge of a past-due medical debt of about $1,874.
(TR  at  page  17  line  16  to  page  19  line  2.)  This  alleged  debt  does  not  appear  on  the
Government’s three most recent credit reports: April 2021, August 2021 and May 2022.
(GXs 6~8.)  This allegation is found for Applicant.
