Applicant is  52  years old, married,  and  has two  minor  children. He  graduated  from
high  school in 1989 and  earned  an  associate’s degree  in 1992. Since  June 2014  he  has
worked  as a  technician  for a  Federal contractor. He  was  granted  a  security clearance  in
about 2012.  He is seeking  to  retain  his clearance  in relation  to  his employment.  (Tr. at  24-
26; GE 1 at Sections 2, 12, 13A, 17, 18, 25.)
Guideline F, Financial Considerations
The Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is
financially  overextended  with  delinquent  debts  and  therefore  potentially  unreliable,
untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The SOR
identified  27  charged-off  debts  or  debts  in  collection  owed  by  Applicant  totaling  about
$49,000. The Government also alleged that Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in
about  November  2008  and  his  debts  were  discharged  in  March  2009.  In  his  Answer,
Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations with additional explanations regarding his
wife’s  2018  diagnosis  with  cancer  and  years of  medical  expenses.  The  existence  and
amounts of these debts is also supported by credit reports in the record dated January
29, 2020; November 3, 2021; and May 31, 2022, and  Applicant’s disclosures in the  e-
QIP. (GE 3 to 5 and 7.)
The background and current status of each of the debts alleged in the SOR is as
follows:
1.a. 2008 Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Applicant and  his wife faced financial hardship
when she was laid off from her job  as a  social  worker  during her pregnancy with their
second  child.  She  was  bedridden  with  a  high-risk  pregnancy,  and  her  employer  of  20
years  terminated  her  during  the  pregnancy.  Applicant  was  also  unemployed  or
underemployed with seasonal jobs for a lengthy period of time. They lost their house to
the mortgage lender and their accumulated debts were discharged in bankruptcy. (Tr. at
29-31, 50-51; GE 6 at 35)
1.b  Federal  Student  Loan  in  collection  in  the  approximate  amount  of  $23,491.
Applicant  incurred  this  debt  in  connection  with  his  associate’s  degree.  His  repayment
obligation was deferred for several years before going into collection. He has applied for
debt forgiveness under a Federal policy that is presently being addressed in the Supreme
Court of the United States. No payments are currently due following the Federal COVID-
related “pause” policy on  the  repayment of student loans. Applicant understands that if
the debt-relief program is determined to be legal, most of his student loan debt will be
forgiven. Once the litigation is resolved and he knows how much he has to pay, he intends
to  begin  making  monthly  payments.  This  debt  is  not  delinquent  at  this  time.  I  take
administrative  notice  of  the  fact  under  Federal  student  loan  policy,  Applicant’s  future
payments when they must commence will be based upon an income-driven repayment
plan that takes into consideration Applicant’s income, family size, and ability to repay the
loan at affordable monthly rates. See www.Studentaid.gov. (Tr. at 34-38; AE F.)
1.c.  through  1.p.  Medical debts in collection in the amounts ranging from $76 to
$5,214, totaling approximately $14,600. Applicant has medical insurance for himself and
his family through his employer. The payments alleged in the SOR are co-pays on each
of the bills for medical services for his wife and child. After the hearing, Applicant made a
$3,000  payment  that  resolved  ten  of  the  medical  debts  in  full.  He  also  entered  into  a
payment plan to address the remaining medical debts held by this collection agency. The
plan requires payments of $194.74 per month for 36 months for a total amount of about
$7,000.  Applicant’s  first  payment  was  made  in  early  February  2023.  These  debts  are
being resolved. (Tr. at 39-42; AE G.)
1.q.  Store  credit  account   in   collection   for   approximately   $1,906.  Prior   to   the
hearing, Applicant’s wife  was in discussions with  this creditor to  work out a  settlement of
this debt.  After the  hearing, Applicant provided  a  document evidencing  his  settlement  of
this debt with  a  payment of $953  in full  resolution  of the  debt.  The  exhibit reflects that the
account has a zero balance. This debt is resolved.  (Tr. at  42-44, 56-57;  AE L.)
1.r.  through  1.t  Medical  debts  in  collection  in  amounts  of  $1,014;  $1,014;  and
$1,108, respectively. See discussion of debts 1.c through 1.p, above.
1.u.  Communication  service  account  in  collection  in  the  approximate  amount  of
$458. Applicant’s wife believes that this bill relates to services provided to the house they
lost  in  bankruptcy.  After  the  hearing,  Applicant  provided  a  document  evidencing  his
settlement of this debt with a payment of $458 in full resolution of the debt. The exhibit
reflects that the account has a zero balance. This debt is resolved. (Tr. at 44-45, 57-58;
GE 5 at 16; AE I.)
1.v. Credit-card account in collection in the approximate amount of $375. After the
hearing,  Applicant  provided  a  document  evidencing  his  settlement  of  this  debt  with  a
payment of $197. The exhibit reflects that the account has a zero balance. This debt is
resolved. (Tr. at 45, 58-; AE J.)
1.w. Account in collection in the approximate amount of $334.  This debt is for a
medical account, according to the Government’s January 2020 credit report. Applicant is
unaware of this debt or the collection agency. He needs to research this debt further so
that he can arrange a settlement. (Tr. at 45, 59; GE 5 at 17.)
1.x.   Account  in  collection  in  the  approximate  amount  of  $294.  Applicant’s  wife
testified  that  this  is  a  medical  debt.  The  Government’s  November  2021  credit  report
reflects that the debt is indeed a medical account and is a “Paid Collection” with a zero
balance. This debt is resolved. (Tr. at 45, 59; GE 4 at 5.)
1.y  Internet  account  in  collection  in  the  approximate  amount  of  $258.  After  the
hearing,  Applicant  submitted  a  document  evidencing  his  settlement  of  this  debt  with  a
payment of the full amount of the debt. The exhibit reflects that the account has a zero
balance. This debt is resolved. (Tr. at 45; GE 5 at 18; AE K.)
1.z. through  1.dd. Medical debts in collection in the amounts of $160, $159, $157,
$156, and $80, respectively. See discussion of debts 1.c through 1.p, above.
Mitigation and Whole-Person Evidence
Applicant submitted three character-reference letters, one from a long-time friend
of  Applicant’s,  a  second  from  a  therapist  who  has  known  Applicant  personally  and
professionally for over 22 years, and a third from another close friend. All of his references
praise  Applicant’s  dedication  to  his  work  and  his  family.  They  describe  him  as  a
trustworthy person with strong religious values and integrity. (AE B through C.).
Applicant  loves  his  job  and  asserts  that  he  does  it  well.  The  income  he  earns
supports his wife and two children. He is determined to repay his debts that arose in 2018
following  his  wife’s  cancer  diagnosis  and
included  surgery,
chemotherapy, and radiation.  His  wife’s treatment  and  medical bills continue  up  to  the
present. She is currently in remission, but she gets tested every three months. She still
sees the same doctors that make up part of the medical bills listed in the SOR. She was
unable to work for a lengthy period and given her present condition is able to only work
parttime as a caregiver.
treatment,  which
They  also  had  medical  bills  arising  from  complications  in  one  of  his  children’s
medical condition. The child was born prematurely with medical problems. As a teenager,
the child continues to have issues with depression and anxiety, which require ongoing
treatment. For the last six or seven years, the child has also been seeing the same doctors
that are owed money. Applicant’s wife  testified  that the  doctors are willing  to  work with
them on a payment plan for the past-due accounts. She is current on the co-pays owed
to the family’s doctors. Applicant asserted that he is a man of his word and he intends to
fulfill his promises and address all of his debts. (Tr. at 27-28, 31-34, 51-56, 60, 70-71.)
Applicant testified that he and his wife had agreed that they would borrow money
from his 401K plan to repay some of the debts and enter into a payment plan on others.
That is exactly what Applicant did after the hearing.  He and his wife have not received
any financial counseling to help them with their planning or their negotiations with their
creditors. He testified that they intend to seek financial counseling to help them. His wife
testified that they are current on all of their monthly bills. (Tr. at 46-50, 61.)
