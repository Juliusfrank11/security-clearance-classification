Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in his Answer. He is 42 years old. He is
married  and  he  has  one  child,  a  minor.  He  previously  owned  a  home  between
September  2003  and  October  2021.  As  of  his  October  2021  security  clearance
application  (SCA),  he  has  owned  a  home  since  July  2012.  He  attended  college  from
2009 to 2021 but did not earn a degree. He has worked as an electronic technician for
his  employer,  a  DOD  contractor,  since  February  2006.  He  was  granted  a  security
clearance in 2012. (Items 1-2)
The SOR alleges that Applicant had a $12,558 delinquent consumer debt and a
$40 delinquent medical debt. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b) The SOR also alleges that Applicant
falsified his response to questions in section 26 of his 2021 SCA, which inquired about
financial delinquencies, when he failed to disclose SOR ¶ 1.a and an unalleged $54,756
past-due  mortgage  account.  (SOR  ¶  2.a)  In  addition  to  his  admissions  in  his  Answer,
Applicant  discussed  his  delinquent  debts  in  his  January  2022  and  February  2022
interviews  with  a  background  investigator,  and  in  his  June  2022  response  to
interrogatories. SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b, and his past-due mortgage account referenced in
SOR ¶ 2.a, are reported in a December 2021 credit bureau report. SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b
are  also  reported  in  a  September  2022  credit  bureau  report.  Incident  reports  from  the
Defense  Information  System  for  Security  Case  Adjudication  Tracking  System  also
reflect Applicant’s delinquent debts. (Items 1-7)
SOR  ¶  1.a  is  for  a  charged-off  credit  card.  Applicant  indicated  during  his
background interviews that he neglected to set up auto-payments after this account was
transferred  to  a  different  servicer.  He  then  forgot  about  it  because  he  did  not  receive
any  notices  from  the  creditor about  a  delinquent  balance,  and  he was  unaware  it  was
delinquent.  He  intended  to  contact  the  creditor  to  resolve  this  debt.  He  stated  in  his
response to interrogatories that he had not made efforts to resolve this debt. (Item 3)
SOR ¶ 1.b is a medical debt for a 2020 emergency room visit. Applicant indicated
during  both  of  his  background  interviews  that  he  forgot  about  this  debt,  and  he  was
unaware it was delinquent. He thought his medical insurance paid it and he was never
billed  for  it.  He  intended  to  contact  the  creditor  to  pay  this  debt.  He  failed  to  provide
documentation to corroborate his efforts at resolution. (Item 3)
Applicant maintained during his February 2022 background interview that he did
not intend to deceive by failing to disclose his past-due mortgage account on his SCA.
He indicated that this mortgage  is for his primary residence. In late 2019, he made an
error  when  he  attempted  to  rearrange  his  automatically  deducted  monthly  mortgage
payment  on  the  creditor’s  website.  His  last  mortgage  payment  was  auto  deducted  in
December 2019, and he made no subsequent mortgage payments. He indicated that he
attempted to correct his mistake on multiple occasions during the COVID-19 pandemic,
but he never received a live representative  when he contacted the creditor’s customer
service department. He acknowledged that he was neglectful and irresponsible in failing
to  continue  to  follow  up  with  the  customer  service  department.  In  early  2022,  he
reached  a  live  representative  who  arranged  for  him  to  make  a  $63,890  payment  at  a
retail branch, which brought his mortgage current. He was able to make such a payment
because  his  “budgeted  mortgage  payment  fund  was  still  in  my  account,”  and  he  used
savings to pay the penalties. He indicated that he likely completed his SCA during the
period when he was trying to reach the creditor, and his mortgage was not on his mind.
(Item 3)
Applicant  indicated  during  his  February  2022  background  interview  that  his
monthly net income was $5,881, and that his monthly net remainder after expenses was
$2,173. He indicated that he had assets totaling $1,291,260. He described his financial
situation during his background interviews as stable and indicated that he had a budget.
He planned to timely pay his debts. He had not received credit counseling. He traveled
to Ireland for tourism in 2009 and 2019, and to Canada in 2011. (Items 2-3)
