Applicant admitted all 16 remaining allegations in the SOR with explanations. Her
admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. (Item 2) After a thorough and careful
review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  42  years  old  and  unmarried.  She  has  one  child.  She  earned  a
bachelor’s degree in 2002 and a master’s degree in 2016. In March 2019, she started a
position  with  her  current  employer,  a  defense  contractor and  she submitted  a  security
clearance application (SCA). (Item 3)
In her SCA, Applicant reported that she had been granted a security clearance in
2006. She listed numerous periods of unemployment since January 2011, including from
October 2018 up to the time she started her current position. She attributed those periods
to layoffs and her medical disabilities. Consequently, she experienced financial difficulties
that she could not address on her limited income. (Item 3) She disclosed that she failed
to file and pay Federal and state income taxes for 2016 because she had been evicted in
2016 and was on medical leave into 2017. She said she did not have a stable address
during that time. She stated that she made an appointment with a credit counselor through
her employer’s financial assistance program. She noted that she is a single mother. (Item
2)
In March 2020, Applicant was interviewed  by a government investigator. During
that background interview, Applicant discussed her delinquent debts, including taxes. She
discussed her Federal and state income tax returns. She told the investigator that she did
not file her 2016 and 2017 tax returns because she had not received a W-2 Form. She
was uncertain of the amount she owed for 2016. As of the date of the interview, she had
not filed those returns. (Item 8)
In her September 2022 Answer to the SOR, Applicant repeatedly stated that her
inability to pay her delinquent debts was due to periods of unemployment, being a single
mother, having no health insurance, and suffering from medical disabilities. She stated
that  in  August  2022,  she  started  working  with  a  debt  management  company  and
established a repayment plan for her debts. (Item 2)
Based on Applicant’s admissions and credit bureau reports (CBR) from November
2022, March 2022, and April 2019, the SOR alleged 13 delinquent debts totaling $34,365
that became delinquent between 2014 and 2019. It also alleged that she filed a Chapter
7 bankruptcy in 2013 and failed to file Federal and state income taxes for 2016. (Items 4,
5, and 6) The status of these allegations is as follows:
1.a: In August 2013, Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. In December 2013,
the court discharged $27,000 of delinquent debts. (Item 7)
1.b  through  1.n  are debts in collection or charged off. They consist of consumer
debts; an unpaid lease; medical bills; a personal loan; credit cards; a car loan; cell phone
bill; and an insurance premium. Applicant included all of them in her August 2022 payment
plan. The total amount owed is approximately $34,365.
1.o: Withdrawn.
1.p: Applicant has not filed her 2016 Federal income tax return. She stated that
she did not file it because in December 2016 she was evicted from her residence and did
not have a mailing address. (Item 2)
1.q:
Applicant has not filed her 2016 state income tax return, for the reason stated
above.
Applicant  participated  in  financial  counseling.  Her  annual  salary  for  2022  was
about $125,000. She submitted a written budget for June 2022. Her net monthly income
was $9,600 and monthly expenses were $8,200, leaving $1,400 remaining. (Item 2)
Applicant  takes  full  responsibility  for  her  delinquent  debts  and  tax  filings.  She
acknowledged  that  “she  should  have  been  more  responsible.”  (Item  2) She  intends  to
rectify her debts. (Item 2)
