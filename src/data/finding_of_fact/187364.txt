Applicant  denied  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  and  1.b.  After  a  thorough  and
careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of
fact.
Applicant  is  an  85-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed  with  the  defense  contractor  since  July  of  2021.  He  has  held  a  security
clearance  in  the  past, but  not  currently.  He  is  divorced  and  has  three  children.  (TR  at
page  17  line  16  to  page  25  line  8,  and  GX  1  at  pages  7,  12,  24~25  and  28~30.)
Applicant  attributes  his  current  financial  situation  to  periods  of  unemployment,  a  failed
business, and to health issues.
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
The SOR alleges that Applicant is excessively indebted to the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) for a delinquent tax lien, and that he filed for the protection of a Chapter 7
bankruptcy in March of 2011.
1.a.  Applicant  initially  denied,  “due  to  mitigating  circumstances,”  that  he  owed
back-taxes totaling about $16,875 (GX 3), but now admits the allegation. In the past, he
failed  to  pay  sufficient  Federal  income  taxes;  that  were  due  after  filing  his tax  returns,
putting them last on his priorities of debts to pay.  He was satisfied with letting his state
tax  refunds  go  towards  his  Federal  tax  debt.  Now  realizing  the  gravity  of  his
circumstances,  Applicant  has  initiated  a  payment  plan  by  which  he  is  making  monthly
payments  of  $500  towards  his  back-taxes,  as  evidenced  by  documentation  from  the
Federal taxing authority. (TR at pages 22 lines 15~20, page 27 line 15 to page 28 line,
at page 42 line 22 to page 44 line 17, and AppXs B, C and I.)
1.b.  Applicant  filed  for  the  protection  of  a  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  in  March  of
2011;  and  as  a  result,  his  debts  were  discharged  in  June  of  2011.  (GX  4.)  As  noted
above, Applicant attributes his financial difficulties to periods of unemployment, a failed
business, and to health issues. (TR at page 31 line 10 to page 39 line 4, at page 40 line
11 to page 41 line 6, and at page 42 lines 15~19.) Having occurred more than a decade
ago, I find that it has no current security significance.
