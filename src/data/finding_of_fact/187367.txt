Response)
The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  had  7  delinquent  consumer  debts  totaling
$14,450 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.b, 1.e, 1.i-1.j, 1.m-1.n), and 13 delinquent medical debts totaling
$7,260  (SOR  ¶¶  1.c-1.d,  1.f-1.h,1.k-1.l,  1.o-1.t).  In  addition  to  her  admissions  in  her
Answer,  Applicant  discussed  her  delinquent  debts  in  her  August  2021  security
clearance  application  (SCA).  Her  delinquent  debts  are  also  reported  on  three  credit
bureau reports from September 2021, July 2022, and October 2022. (Items 1-5)
Applicant  attributes  her  delinquent  debts  to  her  periods  of  unemployment.  She
stated  that  a  credit  repair  company  assisted  her  with  resolving  some  of  her  medical
debts. In her Answer, she stated that she worked with a consumer advocacy law firm in
the  past  to  pay  and  remove  inaccurate  debts  from  her  credit  bureau  report,  but  that
several of those debts have reappeared. She stated that she was resolving her debts as
she  could,  while  providing  for  a  child  in  college,  helping  her  eldest  child  with  her
grandchildren,  and  maintaining  her  daily  living  expenses.  She  intends  to  purchase  a
home. (Items 1-2)
SOR ¶ 1.a is a $9,358 charged-off debt. Applicant stated in her Answer that this
account was paid and closed after her car was sold. This debt was not reported on the
July and October 2022 credit bureau reports. (Items 1, 3)
SOR  ¶  1.b  is  a  $2,602  collection  account  involving  an  eviction  action  filed  by
Applicant’s former landlord in September 2015. Applicant stated in her Answer that she
did  not  owe  this  debt.  She  provided  documentation  reflecting  that  the  eviction  action
was dismissed in October 2015. Her October 2022 credit bureau report reflects that she
is disputing any debt associated with the collection agency in SOR ¶ 1.b. (Items 1, 3-5)
SOR ¶ 1.e is a $1,010 collection account. Applicant stated in her Answer that this
account  was  deleted  from  her  credit  bureau  report  because  the  creditor  reported
erroneous information. A June 2018 credit bureau record reflects that she successfully
disputed  a  debt  with  the  same  creditor  as  SOR  ¶  1.e  but  with  a  different  account
number, and that debt was consequently deleted from her credit report. Only SOR ¶ 1.e
is reported on the 2022 credit bureau reports. (Items 1, 3-5)
SOR  ¶   1.i   is  a   $517   charged-off   debt.   Applicant  stated   in  her  Answer  that  the
creditor reported  an  incorrect  amount on  her  credit bureau  report. She  also stated  that
she  lacked  the  income  to  pay this debt due  to  her  periods  of  unemployment. (Items  1,  3-
5)
SOR  ¶¶  1.j  and  1.n  are  two  charged-off  debts  with  the  same  creditor,  for  $498
and  $224,  respectively.  Applicant  stated  in  her  Answer  that  these  accounts  were
deleted  from  her  credit  bureau  report  because  the  creditor  reported  erroneous
information. They are not reported on her most recent credit bureau report from October
2022. (Items 1, 3-4)
SOR ¶ 1.m is a $241 collection account. Applicant stated in her Answer that she
never  received  any  services  from  this  creditor.  It  is  not  reported  on  her  most  recent
credit bureau report from October 2022. (Items 1, 4)
SOR ¶¶ 1.c through 1.d, 1.f through 1.h, 1.k through 1.l, and 1.o through 1.t are
Applicant’s  delinquent  medical  debts.  She  stated  in  her  Answer  that  some  of  these
medical  debts  were  paid  by  either  her  primary  or  secondary  health  insurance,  and
others  were  deleted  from  her  credit  bureau  report.  A  June  2018  credit  bureau  report
reflects  that  she  successfully  disputed  various  medical  debts,  and  they  were
consequently deleted from her credit bureau report. She also provided health insurance
documentation  reflecting  claims  processed  between  2018  and  2022,  in  which  her
member  responsibility  was  $0. She  maintains  that  these  claims  are  the  same  medical
debts as  those  alleged  in  the SOR.  Her  most  recent  credit  bureau  report does not  list
any delinquent medical debts. (Items 1-4)
