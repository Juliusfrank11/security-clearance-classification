Applicant is 43 years old, unmarried, and has no children. He served in the U.S.
Navy  from  August  1997  until  his  medical  discharge  in  October  1997.  He  has  been
employed by a U.S. Government contractor as a project manager since December 2013.
Applicant  has  held  a  security  clearance  in  the  past  and  seeks  to  renew  his  national
security eligibility in connection with his employment. (Item 2 at Sections 1, 12, 13A, 17,
18, 25; Item 4 at 1.)
Guideline  F, Financial Considerations
The Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is
financially irresponsible, which is evidenced by his failure to file his Federal tax returns
for tax years (TYs) 2013 through 2017, as required (SOR ¶ 1.a), and his failure to file his
state tax returns for TYs 2009, and 2013 through 2017, as required (SOR ¶ 1.b). In the
Answer Applicant admitted both of the SOR allegations. In the e-QIP, Applicant wrote that
he “forgot” to file his Federal and state tax returns for TYs 2013  through 2017.  During
his security interview, he admitted that his untimeliness in filing his tax returns was due
to laziness and forgetfulness. (Items1 at 27; Item 4 at 6.)
The record evidence regarding the two SOR allegations is as follows:
1.a. Failure to file in a timely manner, as required, Federal income tax returns for
TYs 2013 through 2017. Applicant submitted with his September 2022 Answer copies of
his Federal tax returns for TYs 2014 through 2017. The returns were self-prepared and
are  undated  and  unsigned.  All  four  of  the  returns  reflect  that  Applicant  was  entitled  to
refunds ranging in amounts of $573 to $774. Applicant failed to provide a date or dates
when he filed these tax returns. If the returns were in fact submitted, they had to have
been filed after the November 2020 e-QIP and before the September 2022 Answer. Not
only were the returns submitted after their due dates, but Applicant is also likely barred
from  claiming  any refunds due  the  three-year statute  of limitations on  refund  claims. 26
U.S.C.  § 6511(a).  (Item 1, Answer at 3, 5, 8,11.)
With  respect  to  his  2013  Federal  tax  return,  Applicant  wrote  in  his  Answer  that
“2013 was a mistake I made when filling out the form . . . 2013 was lost in a hard drive
failure.” It appears that he is stating that he mistakenly included TY 2013 on the e-QIP as
a year in which he had not filed his Federal tax return. It further appears that he is stating
that he cannot provide a copy of the return due to a computer problem. Applicant provided
no documentation to support a finding that he in fact filed his TY 2013 Federal tax return,
or that his return was filed as required, i.e., on or before April 15, 2014. Though not alleged
in the SOR, Applicant also disclosed in the e-QIP that he had not filed his Federal tax
return for TY 2009. He provided no comments about that Federal tax return.
1.b. Failure to file in a timely manner, as required, state income tax returns for TYs
2009 and 2013 through 2017. Applicant responded to the Government’s interrogatories
in February 2022 and provided notices from his state government, dated September 9,
2021.  The  notices  covered  the  TYs  2014  through  2017.  In  the  notices,  the  state
government advised Applicant that he was not eligible to receive refunds for  these tax
years  because  his  returns  were  filed  more  than  three  years  after  they  were  due.  The
notices do not reflect when the returns for those tax years were filed, but they were likely
filed after his submission of the e-QIP in November 2020 in which he disclosed that his
state  returns  for  the  same  years had  not  yet  been  filed.  Applicant  did  not  provide  any
information about his tax returns for TYs 2009 and 2013, which were both alleged in the
SOR  to  have  been  filed  untimely.  He  wrote  in  his  response  to  the  Government’s
interrogatories that he lost the document for TY 2013. With his response, he also provided
documentation evidencing that he had paid a state tax lien in the amount of $2,221. The
documentation does not reflect what tax year the lien covered, though it noted the date
of the lien as February 13, 2016. The SOR does not allege the existence of a state tax
lien. (Item 3 at 7-14.)
In the November 2020 e-QIP, Applicant wrote that, “2018 has been mailed to both
state  and  federal, 2019  has  been  received  by  both  state  and  federal.” He provided  no
filing dates for any of those returns. The vague information provided does not confirm that
that any of the returns were timely filed. By not responding to the Government’s FORM,
Applicant provided no more recent information regarding his subsequent tax returns  to
demonstrate that he has changed his past practice of untimely tax filings. Applicant also
elected not to submit any information about his work performance or ability to safeguard
classified information.
