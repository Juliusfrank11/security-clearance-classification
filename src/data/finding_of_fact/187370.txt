In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions
are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 31-year-old systems administrator employed by a defense contractor
since  December  2020.  He  received  an  associate  degree  from  a  community  college  in
2015. He has never married and has no children. He was cleared for a public trust position
by another government agency in 2018, but he has never held a security clearance.
A  credit  report dated  April  7,  2022,  reflects  six  delinquent  debts  charged  off  for
$12,833  (SOR  ¶  1.a);  $7,622  (SOR  ¶  1.b);  $7,124  (SOR  ¶  1.c);  $4,800  (SOR  ¶  1.d);
$2,900  (SOR  ¶  1.e);  and  $2,714  (SOR  ¶  1.f).  During  an  interview  with  a  security
investigator in April 2022, Applicant attributed his delinquent debts to a downturn in the
economy  due  to  COVID-19.  In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  stated  that  he  intended  to
resolve the delinquent debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f by May 2023 and to resolve
the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.d by December 2023. He has not provided any
specific information about his plans for resolving the debts.
