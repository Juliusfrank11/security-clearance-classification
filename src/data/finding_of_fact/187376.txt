Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.d through 1.n. He denied the SOR
allegations  in  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.c  and  2.a  through  2.c.  Applicant’s  admissions  are
incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings,
testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 43 years old. He holds two associate degrees earned in 2000 and a
bachelor’s degree earned in 2014. He also holds numerous computer certifications. He
never married. He has five minor children. He began working as a government contractor
in 2004, and in 2010 he started his own company, which has been successful. He has
held a security clearance since at least 2005. (Tr. 22, 26-32, 35)
In  2010,  Applicant  started  his business  under a  government program  where his
business was provided with government contracts, and he was mentored for the first five
years.  Each  subsequent  year  after  the  fifth  year,  the  business  was  required  to
incrementally  increase  obtaining  government  contracts  on  its  own.  In  year  six,  the
program required the business to obtain 20% of its own contracts, year seven 30%, year
eight 40%, year nine 50% and then the company would graduate from the program and
be  solely  responsible  for  obtaining  its  own  contracts.  The  business  had  reporting
requirements to the government. (Tr. 22, 35-36,56-57; Answer to the SOR)
Applicant testified that he is the sole owner of the company and is its president and
chief executive officer. He receives an annual salary from the business of $170,000. It is
a  Subchapter  S  corporation.  He  has  a  contracted  facility  security  officer  (FSO).  He
explained that under a Subchapter S corporation, he files his business tax returns first
then his personal income tax returns. He receives an IRS Form K-1 from the company,
which reflects the profit from his business, for which he is the recipient as the sole owner.
It was requested that Applicant provide copies of IRS Form K-1 for the past five years.
He  did  not  provide  the  documents.  In  2022,  his  company  grossed  approximately  $6
million. Applicant testified that since 2011 he has not had a good grasp on understanding
his  taxable  income.  At  the  time  of  hearing,  he  said  he  had  not  had  any  financial
counseling. He is responsible for monitoring all financial matters of his company. He now
understands that he needs a dedicated person to handle his finances who is more than
a bookkeeper. (Tr. 92-103)
Applicant  testified  that  when  he  started  his  business,  he  had  a  woman  in  the
neighborhood prepare his tax  returns. He said  everyone in the area  had her complete
their returns. Although she worked for H & R Block, she completed people’s tax returns
outside of her employment. Sometime after he filed his 2011 tax return, the IRS contacted
Applicant and asked him if he had a barn that burned down. He learned that this woman
was  making  fraudulent  claims  on  his  tax  returns.  He  credibly  testified  that  he  never
intentionally meant to mislead the IRS. He said that the IRS told him to hire a certified
public accountant to prepare his tax returns. This woman had filed his 2009, 2010, and
2011 income tax returns. (Tr. 48-53)
In 2012, Applicant hired accounting firm KK who completed his tax returns for tax
years 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015. He stopped using them after tax year 2015 when they
advised  him  that  his  company  was  getting  too  big  for  their  expertise  with  all  of  the
government reporting requirements and financial aspects of the business. Applicant said
that his business and personal income tax returns were combined. (Tr. 53, 57)
Applicant testified that in 2015 he hired another certified public accounting firm, IA,
to handle his tax returns and the government reporting requirements for the business. He
received tax advice from Mr. H of IA. Applicant testified that in 2017, he became aware
that previous tax years’ returns were filed late and penalties and interest were incurred
that  Applicant  was  responsible  to  pay.  He  said  he  was  unaware  why  this  happened
because his accountant had the documents he needed to timely file. Mr. H was working
with the IRS to potentially have the penalties for his late filings waived. Applicant testified
he never saw a waiver request that was sent to the IRS. He said he was making periodic
lump-sum payments to reduce his tax liabilities. (Tr. 57-73, 85-86)
Applicant’s  IRS  tax  transcript  for  tax  year  2016  shows  that  someone  was
communicating with the IRS on Applicant’s behalf. Applicant testified that he and Mr. H
met with the IRS representative a couple of times in 2017 and multiple times after 2017.
Applicant’s 2016 income tax return was filed in August 2019. Applicant testified that he
did not know the return was filed late because Mr. H had all of the documents to timely
file. Applicant said he asked Mr. H how to resolve his tax problems, and he was advised
to  make  lump-sum  payments  towards  his  delinquent  taxes.  His  tax  transcript  from  tax
year  2020  shows  he  had  $95,457  withheld  for  taxes  during  the  year,  which  was  then
applied to tax debts for years 2008, 2009, and 2010. Applicant testified that IA had access
to all his financial information that was stored on a software program, and they had their
own bookkeeper who was responsible for Applicant’s account. Tax transcripts show he
did make periodic lump-sum payments to the IRS. (Tr. 62-73; AE D, G, H, I)
Applicant stated that when he completed his security clearance application (SCA)
in February 2017, he asked his FSO and Mr. H whether he needed to disclose his failure
to timely file and pay his past income taxes and whether he was currently delinquent on
any federal debt. He said he was told by Mr. H that he did not need to disclose he was
delinquent because he was making payments to the IRS and was under an installment
agreement. Applicant testified that he terminated IA accounting services in 2019. He hired
another accounting firm to complete his tax returns. (Tr. 75, 83-86)
Applicant testified that he  then hired a tax accountant to file his 2020 and 2021
income tax returns. He also had his own bookkeeper, who managed the corporate books,
provide the financial information to the tax accountant. In December 2022, Applicant hired
a new accounting firm who is now responsible for all of Applicant’s tax returns.  He has
signed a power of attorney for the firm to help him resolve his tax issues with the IRS. He
meets with his accountant quarterly to ensure he is ahead of any potential issues.  The
firm also does his bookkeeping. (Tr. 38-39, 81-90)
Tax transcripts reflect Applicant’s adjusted gross income was as follows:
Tax year  2013-$63,358
Tax year  2014-$211,444
Tax year 2015-$309,233
Tax year 2016-$313,758
Tax year 2017-$383,017
Tax year 2018-$403,031
Tax year 2019-$397,785
Tax year 2020-negative $650,447
Tax year 2021-$170,258
(AE A through I)
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant  was  indebted  to  the  IRS  for  delinquent  taxes  from
years  2008  through  2011  and  2014  through  2017.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.h)  Specifically  as
follows:
Tax year 2008-$17,393
Tax year 2009-$76,426
Tax year 2010-$64,219
Tax year 2011-$24,494
Tax year 2014-$20,590
Tax year 2015-$52,237
Tax year 2016-$11,202
Tax year 2017-$124,233
The SOR alleged Applicant failed to timely file federal income tax returns for tax
years 2011, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and as of the date of the SOR, he had not filed his
2018 federal income tax return. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.i) Documents support that his 2014, 2015,
2016, and 2017  returns were filed late. I was not provided a tax transcript for tax year
2011. Applicant admitted he failed to timely file his 2011 federal income tax return, but
disputed the amount he owed. Applicant filed his 2018 federal income tax return in March
2020. He had an adjusted gross income of $403,031 and owed a balance of $117,659 for
taxes for that year. (GE 2; AE B, C, D, E, F)
In September 2019, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. He
discussed his federal tax liens and explained that the IRS conducted an audit on his 2008
through 2011 income tax returns. He  said he agreed to make $200 monthly payments
and  had  been  making  the  payments  since  June  2012.  He  expected  the  liens  to  be
resolved  in  2020.  His  November  2019  tax  transcript  for  tax  year  2008  reports  an
installment agreement was established in May 2013 and payments of $200 were made
until September 2017 and applied to his 2008 delinquent taxes. An offer-in-compromise
was made to the IRS in September 2017 and withdrawn in January 2018. (Tr. 132-133;
GE 2)
A letter from his accountant dated November 11, 2019, was provided that stated
that  Applicant’s  2018  federal  income  tax  had  not  been  filed  because  the  current
accountant  was  waiting  for  documents  from  his  previous  accountant;  a  balance  of
$317,970  was  owed  at  that  time  to  the  IRS;  they  were  in  the  process  of  requesting
information and waiting for the IRS to appoint a revenue agent to provide them documents
regarding  a  fraud  determination  on  Applicant’s  2009  and  2010  returns;  and  that  an
installment  agreement  was  not  in  place,  but  his  account  was  flagged  to  show  an
installment agreement was being discussed and waiting for the assignment of a revenue
agent. (AE U)
Applicant provided a copy of an installment agreement with the IRS from January
2022, which notes he owes $266,548. It provides for him to pay $500 a month towards
his balance that includes tax years 2009, 2011, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. He has been
making payments that have been applied to his delinquent tax debts. Tax transcripts show
he  made  other  payments  towards  his  tax  debt  in  the  past,  sometimes  lump-sum
payments. Applicant’s November 2019 tax transcript for tax year 2008 reflected Applicant
owed  $17,393.  In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  stated  that  he  paid  his  2008
delinquent federal taxes. I do not have a current 2008 tax transcript, but based on the
installment  agreement,  it  is  likely  any  outstanding  debt  from  2008  would  have  been
included. The most current tax transcript I have for tax year 2010 is from November 2019
and it shows an outstanding balance owed of $64,219. However, using the same logic as
the  2008  balance  owed,  this  tax  year  would  also  likely  have  been  included  in  the
installment agreement if it was still owed. (Tr. 39; GE 2; AE D, J)
Applicant  provided  tax transcripts  from  February 2023  with  current balances  for
tax years below. I did not receive updated tax transcripts for tax years 2009 through 2011.
(AE A, B, C, D, E, F, G)
Tax year 2013-zero
Tax year-2014-zero
Tax year-2015-zero
Tax year-2016- $11,794
Tax year-2017-$71,743
Tax year-2018-$117,659
Tax year-2019-$1,313
Federal tax liens were filed in December 2010 ($5,453), May 2013 ($131,684) for
tax years 2008, 2009, and 2010; and July 2016 ($17,298) for tax year 2011. No evidence
was presented to show they have been released. (SOR ¶¶ 1.j through 1.l) (GE 2)
The SOR also alleged state tax liens filed against Applicant in May 2014, August
2014, and July 2018, which were resolved with payments (SOR ¶ 1.m). Documents were
provided to show these state tax liens were released. SOR ¶ 1.n alleges he was indebted
to  his  state  for  $1,394  and  state  tax  lien  was  filed  in  August  2019  for  that  amount.
Applicant  testified  that  his  state  taxes  were  paid,  and  the  liens  were  released.  No
documents were provided to substantiate the 2019 state taxes were paid or the lien was
released. (Tr. 74; GE 2)
Applicant’s May 2017 credit report shows that there was an additional federal tax
lien that was filed in May 2013 ($13,200) and was paid and released the same month.
There were also tax liens filed in May 2014 ($725) that was paid and released in June
2014 and August 2014 ($1,434) that was paid and released the same month. (GE 4)
SOR ¶ 2.a alleged that Applicant committed fraud in the preparation of his federal
income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2008,  2009,  and  2010.  (SOR  ¶  2.a)  As  part  of  his
response to Interrogatories, Applicant included a tax transcript from November 2019 for
tax year 2008. An entry from October 2012 shows a “penalty for fraud” was accessed for
$12,644  along  with  other  accuracy  penalties,  which  appear  to  be  for  underreporting
income. No other evidence was provided regarding the fraud allegations. (GE 2)
SOR ¶ 2.b alleged Applicant intentionally failed to disclose on his February 2020
security clearance application that he failed to file or pay his federal and state income tax
returns by answering “no” to the inquiry and did not disclose his 2008 through 2011 and
2014 through 2017 tax debts or his 2011 through 2018 failure to timely file his federal
income  tax  returns.  SOR  ¶  2.b  alleged  that  he  also  failed  to  disclose  that  he  was
delinquent on any federal debt. A 2020 SCA was not offered or admitted into evidence.
Applicant maintains a three-bedroom apartment in a large city, and he also owns
a residence in his home state. He testified that he pays approximately $4,000 a month for
child support. However, in his personal financial statement from February 2022 that he
provided in his answer to the SOR, he reported his child support as $2,500. He testified
that he had $120,000 of student loans that are deferred due to the pandemic. He said he
was making $200 monthly payments on the loans until the pandemic. He stated that his
salary  is  approximately  $170,000  annually.  However,  tax  transcripts  show  his  taxable
income in some years to be much higher and some years lower because of his business.
(Tr. 41-48, 103-107; Answer to the SOR; AE N, P)
In  2017,  Applicant  purchased  a  2016  truck  and  owes  about  $20,000  on  it  with
monthly  payments  of  $586.  In  late  2020,  he  purchased  a  2020  luxury  sports  car.  The
purchase price of the car was $90,000. Applicant stated that he helped a person obtain a
contract and the friend paid the car dealership $40,000 toward Applicant’s purchase price
of the vehicle and Applicant paid the remaining $50,000 cash towards the purchase. In
Applicant’s budget, he does not list this car as one of his assets.  He stated that he told
his accountant that he purchased a car and $40,000 of the purchase price was paid by
someone else. His company also purchased a larger vehicle for business travel that he
uses. (Tr. 107-119)
Any  derogatory  information  that  was  not  alleged  will  not  be  considered  for
disqualifying  purposes,  but  may  be  considered  when  applying  mitigating  conditions,  in
making a credibility determination, and in a whole-person analysis.
Applicant  stated  that  he  is  a  good  person  who  is  devoted  to  public  service  and
helping his community. He provided documents to show his participation and support for
his son’s basketball team; serving as a judge for a competition in support for a local high
school; his nomination for small business person of the year in 2014; his recognition as
an entrepreneur; and his 2012 sponsorship for a school rally and other civic activities. (Tr.
125-131; Answer to the SOR).
Post-hearing, Applicant provided a copy of a budget; an email that showed how to
obtain a free credit report; a document explaining rights under the Fair Credit Reporting
Act; a certificate from February 2023 to show he attended credit counseling through the
Internet as approved by the bankruptcy court; and emails from his accountant from 2019
and 2021 regarding Applicant’s attempts to resolve his tax issues. (AE P, Q, R, S, U, V)
