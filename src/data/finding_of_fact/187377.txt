Applicant, 47, is a systems engineer currently employed by a defense contractor
since  June 2021. He has  worked as  a Federal contractor since  2000.  He  received his
bachelor’s  degree  in  1998  and  his  master’s  degree  in  2000.  He  married  in  2000  and
divorced in 2012. He has two children, ages 16 and 8. Applicant married again in 2020.
He has held a security clearance since 2000. (GX 2; GX 3; Response.)
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant was indebted for a Federal tax
lien entered in 2012 in the approximate amount of $37,123; that he is indebted to his state
of residence for tax lien entered in 2016 in the approximate amount of $628; that he was
past due on a vehicle-loan account in the amount of $656 with the total debt of $35,372;
that he is indebted on the charged-off mortgage-loan account in the approximate amount
of  $27,458;  and that  he  is indebted for a judgment entered against him  in  2020 in  the
amount  of  $2,703.  In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  the  first  three  SOR
allegations with an explanation for how he incurred the debts and their current statuses.
He denied that the mortgage-loan debt remained delinquent. (GX 2; GX 3; Answer.) At
the hearing, Applicant admitted SOR ¶ 1.e, but stated that he paid the judgment of $2,073
in full. (Tr. 78-81.) Applicant’s admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
SOR ¶ 1.a.
While  living  in  another  state  between  2001  and  2005,  Applicant  hired  a
professional tax preparer to file his income tax returns. He received refunds for each of
those tax years. In 2005, he moved to his current state of residence. In 2007 or 2008,
Applicant received a letter from the IRS that stated that he was being audited for tax years
2001 through 2005 and that the information provided on his tax returns would likely be
adjusted. As a result of the audit, the IRS informed Applicant that he owed taxes for 2001
to 2005, as well as repayment of the erroneous refunds. (Tr. 41-42; Tr. 106-124.)
After selling his house in another state in 2005, Applicant paid off all his existing
consumer debt. However, his wife spent excessively and again maximized their credit-
card debt and incurred other consumer debt. At the time that Applicant received notice
from the IRS about his tax liability due to the results of the audit, Applicant did not have
the  funds  to  pay  the  taxes  owed.  Additionally,  for  tax  years  2008,  2009,  and  2010,
Applicant  was  inadvertently  not having  enough  taxes  withheld from  his paychecks.  He
was also earning income from his rental properties, which created greater tax liabilities.
He adjusted his withholding rate beginning in tax year 2011. (Tr. 56-57; Tr. 115-124.)
Applicant was laid  off from  his job  in February 2010  and  was unemployed  until April
2010. He withdrew money from  his 401(k)  to  cover his and  his family’s living  expenses,
to   include   his  mortgage   loan   payments  and   credit  card  and   other  consumer  debt
payments. At  the  time  of the  withdrawal,  Applicant did  not understand  the  rate  at which
he  would be  taxed, and  opted  to  defer paying  taxes in favor of having  access to  a  larger
sum  of  money. He  was unable  to  fully meet  his tax  obligation  owed  from  the  withdrawal.
(Tr. 45-47; Tr. 67-70.)
The IRS secured a tax lien against Applicant and his wife in November 2012 in the
amount of $37,123. The tax debt was comprised of the 2001 through 2005 tax debts, the
taxes owed for the 401(k) withdrawal, the taxes incurred due to improper withholding, and
the  taxes incurred  from  the  income  from  the  rental properties. Applicant and  his wife’s
divorce was finalized in September 2012. As part of their divorce decree, they entered a
settlement agreement that contained a provision under which they agreed that Applicant
would pay $922 a month and his wife would pay $550 month towards their joint tax debt
until the debt was satisfied. (AX J; Tr. 123.)
When  Applicant  moved  out  of  the  marital  home  in  January  2013,  his  expenses
increased  significantly.  In  addition  to  remaining  responsible  for  half  of  the  costs  of
maintaining the marital residence and paying the credit card and other consumer debt,
he  was  also  paying  rent  for  his  residence  and  associated  expenses.  He  also  became
responsible for monthly child support that was backdated to September 2012. As a result
of this increased financial strain, his payments to the IRS were sporadic. (Tr. 43.)
In late 2012 or early 2013, Applicant realized that his wife was not making any tax
payments on their joint tax obligation. He went to the local IRS branch with the intention
of setting up a repayment plan. He also asked if his name could be removed from the tax
debt once he paid his required share of his joint tax debt. He was informed that as long
as  his  name  was  on  the  debt,  he  was  responsible  for  it.  He  agreed  to  a  repayment
arrangement  that  would  automatically  take  $500  a  month  from  his  Federal  civilian
employee pay by allotment. (Tr. 57-68.)
When  Applicant  left  federal  employment  in  2016,  the  automatic  $500  a  month
allotments  stopped.  He  continued  to  make  payments  on  the  tax  debt  and  the  IRS
continued  to  withhold  his  refunds.  In  March  2018,  Applicant  entered  an  installment
agreement with the IRS under which he paid $500 a month. Applicant’s former wife did
not make payments on their joint tax debt as agreed. Applicant stated, “I have paid more
than  the  agreed-upon  amount  in  my  divorce  decree,  but  have  done  so  because  I
understand the significance of resolving taxes owed.” (Tr. 68; AX E; AX F; Answer.)
When  Applicant  completed  his  e-QIP  in  November  2016,  he  estimated  his  total
debt to be approximately $43,000. However, through his payments and the withholding
by the IRS of the refunds that Applicant was due to receive, he paid the tax debt in full.
The  2012  tax  lien  was  released  in  July  2018,  and  Applicant  satisfied  the  installment
agreement in May 2021. Applicant has a $0 balance owed for his delinquent taxes. (GX
3; Tr. 106-124; AX E; AX F.) Applicant owes approximately $6,000 for his 2021 Federal
taxes  and  is  making  automatic  payments  of  $600  per  month  beginning  in  September
2022. (Tr. 72.)
SOR ¶ 1.d.
In 2005, Applicant bought three rental duplexes located on the same street in his
then  wife’s hometown in  another state.  He purchased  the  properties  as  an  investment
that he  intended  to  ultimately use  to  fund  his children’s college  educations. Two  of the
properties were financed through 80/20 mortgage loans, where one lender provided 80%
of the loan and a second lender provided 20% of the loan. The third property was financed
through a single lender. (Tr. 56-57; Tr. 82-83.)
The neighborhood where the properties were located was comprised of primarily
rental units and Applicant frequently received offers to purchase the rental properties from
him. Around the time of  Applicant’s  2012  divorce,  he  decided  to  sell  the  properties  for
financial and personal reasons, which included increased difficulty in renting to reliable
tenants who regularly paid their rent. He also found it difficult to manage the properties
while living in another state. Finally, he did not want to incur tax liabilities that he could
not afford to pay. He contacted one of the people who had routinely offered to purchase
the properties, and they negotiated a verbal agreement. However, the agreed-upon sales
prices were less than what Applicant owed on the existing mortgage loans. (Tr. 61-62; Tr.
115-121; Tr. 81-96.)
Applicant  then  contacted  a  real  estate  agent  who  acted  as  the  liaison  between
Applicant and the lending banks. Applicant submitted paperwork to each of the lenders
for their agreement and approval of short sales of the properties. The lender that held the
100% the loan on the one property agreed to the short sale and forgave the deficiency
balance owed on the loan. (Tr. 81-96.)
However, the negotiations with the 80% lender for the two properties with 80/20
loans were extensive. Before Applicant was able to reach an agreement with the 80%
lender, the lender began foreclosure proceedings. The two properties were foreclosed.
The 80% lender on both properties forgave the deficiency balances, if they existed. The
20% lender forgave the deficiency balance on one of the properties, but not the other.
This is the $27,458 charged-off mortgage-loan debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d. (Tr. 81-96.)
At the time of the sales of these properties, Applicant erroneously thought that in
a short sale or a foreclosure, the lender necessarily assumed the loss for any deficiency
balance.  Following  the  foreclosures  and  short  sale,  Applicant  was  never  contacted  by
either the former or the current creditor for the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d. (Tr. 86-91.)
At some point between 2014 and 2016, while working with a real estate agent in
anticipation of possibly purchasing a primary residence, Applicant pulled his credit report.
Upon  seeing  the  charged-off  mortgage-loan  debt  on  Applicant’s  credit  report,  the  real
estate agent suggested that Applicant contact the mortgage lender listed as the creditor
and try to resolve the debt. Applicant contacted the creditor and was informed that there
was no record of the loan. The creditor was unable to locate any loan associated with any
of  the  rental  properties  or  Applicant’s  name.  Because  the  three  other  mortgage-loan
balances on the loans on the two foreclosed properties had been forgiven and were listed
as  “settled”  on  his  credit  report,  Applicant  thought  that  the  delinquent  mortgage-loan
account listed on his credit report was a reporting error. (Tr. 90-92; Tr. 98.)
In  2018, Applicant again noted  that the  delinquent mortgage-loan  was still  listed
on  a  recent credit bureau  report, however with  a  different creditor, also  a  mortgage  lender.
Applicant  contacted   the   current  creditor  that   could   not   find   a   loan   associated   with   the
property or Applicant’s  name. He gave  the  creditor the  account number from  the  original
loan,  and   the   creditor   was  still   unable  to   locate   any  loan   account  associated   with
Applicant.  After receiving  the  SOR in  May  2021,  Applicant  made  the  same  outreach  to
the  creditor with the  same  result. He  contacted  the  creditor most recently  in June  or July
2022, again with  the  same  result. Applicant is willing  and  has the  resources to  resolve
this debt.  The  debt does not appear on  Applicant’s September 2019  credit bureau  report.
He has always timely filed  his Federal and  state  tax returns. (Tr. 91-102; Tr. 146; Tr. 115-
124.)
The statuses of Applicant’s other SOR are debts are as follows:
SOR  ¶   1.b   –   state  tax  lien  $628,  paid.  This  debt  arose  because  Applicant  was
unknowingly under withholding his state taxes from his pay in 2013. This debt was paid
with Applicant’s 2014 state tax refund, and the lien was released in July 2016. (AX T; Tr.
125-127.)
SOR ¶  1.c –  $656 past-due on a vehicle loan with a balance of $35,372, current.
At the time the SOR was issued, Applicant was past due on his vehicle payment. He is
current  on  the  payments  and  in  May  2021,  began  making  the  payments  through  an
automatic debit from his checking account. (AX H; Tr. 127-131.)
SOR  ¶   1.e   –  $2,703  judgment,  paid.  This  debt  was  owed  to  an  e-commerce
company from which Applicant had made multiple purchases over many years. However,
when he learned that he had incurred this debt, he did not recognize the amount and was
unable  to  correlate  it  with  a  specific  purchase.  He  disputed  the  debt  and,  after  not
receiving any correspondence from the creditor, thought the dispute had been successful.
In 2021, he was notified that the debt had gone to collections and a judgment had been
entered  in  August  2020  in  favor  of  the  collection  agency.  In  January  2022,  Applicant
contacted the collection agency, made an initial payment over the telephone, and verbally
entered a repayment agreement. In March 2022, he noticed that the payments were not
being debited from his account, and again contacted the collection agency. In June 2022,
he made a lump-sum payment to satisfy the debt. (AX U; AX S; Tr. 79-81; Tr. 136-138.)
Applicant’s performance appraisals from 2011 through 2015, 2021, and mid-year
2022 are outstanding and collectively state that Applicant is a reliable, strong leader, who
is  trustworthy  and  exercises  good  judgment.  (AX  N.)  Throughout  his  career,  Applicant
has received multiple awards, letters of recognition, and certifications. (AX P.)
Applicant  called
three  character  witnesses  and  submitted  six
letters  of
recommendation. Applicant’s current supervisor since June 2020 stated that Applicant is
loyal and dedicated and strongly recommends him for a security clearance. (Tr. 29-35;
AX R.) Two of Applicant’s current coworkers collectively stated that Applicant is a person
of  integrity  who  is  professional  and  trustworthy,  with  a  strong  work  ethic.  (AX  R.)
Applicant’s former supervisor met Applicant in 2008 when they were working as peers on
the classified project. In 2018, she hired him to work on a project for her. She strongly
recommends Applicant for a security clearance, stating that he has already proven his
ability to properly handle classified information. (Tr. 151-157; AX R.) Applicant’s project
manager from 2008 submitted an official letter of appreciation, specifically commenting
on Applicant’s extraordinary work ethic. (AX R.) Applicant’s former supervisor described
Applicant  as  a  mentor  to  the  junior  engineers  who  worked  on  her  team.  (AX  W.)  The
volunteer  coordinator  of  the  organization  for  which  Applicant  volunteers  stated  that
Applicant is respected and is a motivated leader. (AX R.)
Applicant’s wife,  an  engineer  who  has  held a  security clearance  for  a  number of
years, recommends Applicant for a  security clearance, stating  that Applicant is a  detail-
oriented  person  who  is  trustworthy,  intelligent,  and  hard  working.  They  completed  a
financial education program together in 2019, maintain and adhere to a written budget,
and have a net remainder monthly. (Tr. 155-167; AX K; AX L.)
Applicant lives within his means, has no recent delinquent accounts, and is current
on all his ongoing financial obligations. He has positive balances in his checking account,
savings account, and several retirement accounts including a 401(k) and a Thrift Savings
Plan. Applicant was recently added to the deed of the home his wife purchased prior to
their  marriage,  and  they  are  current  on  the  mortgage  payments.  (Tr.  163.)  He  is  a
dedicated volunteer for an organization whose mission is to empower families to advance
out of poverty. He was sincere and credible while testifying. (AX K; AX L; AX M; AX Q.)
