Applicant admitted to all the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  44-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed with the defense contractor since June of 2016. He is married, and has two
children, and one adult stepchild. (TR at page 5 lines 9~20, at page 12 line 7 to page 13
line 8, and GX 1 at pages 14, 26 and 51.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
1.c. Applicant filed for the protection of a Chapter 13 Bankruptcy in July of 2006,
but he  was unable to keep up  with his payments;  and as  a result,  it  was dismissed  in
July of 2009. (TR at page 16 line 18 to page 17 line 16, and at page 41 line 14 to page
42 line 10.)
1.a. and  1.b. Applicant admits that he  was indebted to the Federal Government
for delinquent taxes for tax years 2004 and 2005 in  an amount totaling about $11,129.
From  about  August  2002,  until  he  graduated  from  college  in  June  of  2016,  Applicant
was, for the most part, either underemployed as a private investigator, or unemployed.
He  filed  his tax  returns  for 2004  and  2005, but  was  unable  to  pay his taxes  that  were
due. Applicant began to  address his past-due  income taxes,  after securing his current
employment.  (TR  at  page  13  line  23  to  page  15  line  14  GX  1  at  page  13,  at  pages
15~23.)  These  tax  debts/liens  were  added  to  Applicant’s  “Offer  in  Compromise
contract”  with  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS).  (TR  at  page  13  line  23  to  page  15
line 14, at page 42 lines 11~20, and AppXs B  and F2.) As Applicant “met the payment
provisions’” of his contract with the IRS, these tax debts/liens have been released by the
IRS. (AppX B.)
1.f.  Applicant  admits  that  he  was  indebted  to  the  Federal  Government  for
delinquent  taxes  for  tax  year  2009  in  an  amount  totaling  about  $10,241.  This  tax
debt/lien  was  part  of  Applicant’s  “Offer  in  Compromise  contract”  with  the  Internal
Revenue  Service  (IRS).  (TR  at  page  15  lines  15~24,  and  AppX  B.)  As  Applicant  “met
the  payment  provisions’”  of  his  contract  with  the  IRS,  this  tax  debt/lien  has  been
released by the IRS. (AppX B.)
1.g.  Applicant  admits  that  he  was  indebted  to  the  Federal  Government  for
delinquent taxes in an amount totaling about $99,250. This combined tax debt/lien was
part  of  Applicant’s  “Offer  in  Compromise  contract”  with  the  Internal  Revenue  Service
(IRS).  (TR  at  page  16  lines  1~17,  and  AppX  B.)  As  Applicant  “met  the  payment
provisions’” of his contract  with the IRS, this combined tax debt/lien has been released
by the IRS. (AppXs B and C.)
1.d. and  1.e. Applicant failed to file his Federal and state income tax returns for
tax  years  2006~2013,  2015  and  2017,  in  a  timely  fashion,  during  a  lengthy  period  of
underemployment  or  unemployment.  He  has  now  filed  those  returns.  (TR  at  page  17
line 17 to page 18 line 18, at page 27 line 21 to page 30 line 10, and AppXs B  and C.)
Applicant has now also complied with the state taxing authority’s concerns regarding his
filings for tax years 2006~2013, 2015 and 2017. (TR at page 18 line 19 to page 19 line
11, at page 42 line 21 to page 43 line 15, and AppX C.)
1.h.  Applicant  is  currently  making  monthly  payments  to  Creditor  H,  through  a
“Creditor Counseling Service.” (TR at page 19 line 12 to page 20 line 16, and AppX D.)
As of April 2022, the alleged delinquency of $2,179 has been reduced to about $1,402.
(AppX D at page 2.)
1.i,  1.j, 1.m,  and  1.n. Applicant admits he is indebted to Creditor I due to medical
debts  in  an  amount  totaling  about  $4,600.  (Applicant’s  documentation  lists  a  current
balance of $8,092, which includes part of the medical debts noted below.) He is making
“$131.00 twice monthly” payments towards this past-due medical debt, and towards the
additional  medical  debt  noted  in  1.l,  below.  Applicant’s  testimony  in  this  regard  is
corroborated by documentation from a “Credit Counseling Service.” (TR at page 20 line
17 to page 21 line 20, and AppXs I~K.)
1.l, 1.o, and  1.p.  Applicant’s admitted past-due medical debt to Creditor L, in the
amount  of  about  $8,995,  has  been  recently  added  to  Applicant’s  payment  plan  noted,
immediately  above.  Again,  Applicant’s  testimony  in  this  regard  is  corroborated  by
documentation.  (TR at page 22 lines 1~4, at page 37 line 20 to page 38 line 7, page 39
line 17 to page 40 line 15, and AppXs I~K.)
