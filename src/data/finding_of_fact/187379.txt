behavior was.  He stated  he  is not a  bad  person  and  was just a  young  man  doing  what  he
thought  was  "fun"  and  in  dealing  with  the  consequences  of  his  actions  he  has  “since

test administered while he was on probation. (SOR ¶¶ 2.b, 3.c). He was on probation for
being drunk and disorderly, the offense at SOR ¶ 1.e.

on  both  occasions.  (SOR  ¶¶  2.c,  2.d,  3.c)  In  his  Answer,  he  states  he  did  not  claim
ownership of the marijuana.

alcohol-related offenses addressed above, these incidences were part of a chapter of his
life when he was not mature enough to fully understand how poor his behavior was. (Item
2 at 2.)
Guideline J
In December 2016 Applicant was charged and later found guilty in August 2017 of
pointing a laser at a police officer. (SOR ¶ 3.a) He states it was not his intention to do any
of  this.  He  believed  there  was  a  possible  break-in  because  when  he  saw  flashlights
shining up at the neighboring townhouse windows while he was sitting on his balcony. He
states in his Answer that he shined his laser pointer to deter the suspected thieves. He
was surprised to find out that it was law enforcement and apologized to them. (Item 2 at
2.)  The  reporting  police  officer reported  that he  saw  them  and  “he  thought  it  would  be
funny to mess with us.” Item 6 at 20.)
Applicant  offered  a  letter  with  his  Answer  and  Response  documenting  his
comprehensive  outpatient  addiction  and  treatment.  (AE  B).  The  treatment  started  in
December 2020. He attended three times a week for three hours a day and he completed
29  sessions.  He  attended  and  participated  in  all  aspects  of  the  treatment,  including
random  breathalyzer  (BAI)  testing  for  alcohol  use  and  urinalysis  testing  for  drugs.  He
tested negative for alcohol and all other substances tested. His program manager noted
he had made significant progress in the areas of recognizing and managing craving, the
ability to identify emotions, and gain insight to the motivations and reasons for his past
treatment-focused,  engaged,  well-respected  and
substance  use  and  was  very
participatory in group sessions. Applicant completed the program in February 2021. (AE1)
Applicant in his Response stated he “was honestly embarrassed to see how many
charges and mishaps”  he  had to admit to.  He offered that  his Answer was made  “in a
panic”  and  he  was  looking  for  “excuses  or  small  discrepancies  in  the  contents  of  the
package  to  try  and  lighten  things  up  a  bit,”  but  as  he  went  through  the  SOR  he
acknowledged  “there  was  a  whole  lot  of  truth  written  out”  for  him  “to  finally  own.”  He
acknowledged the reports describe him during a time in life where he was a “young adult
having trouble finding [his] way.” He states these actions do not define [him] accurately
as the man [he has] grown to be.” He offers that he has taken control his life is working
on a plan to obtain a double major in cybersecurity and cloud computing. He asserts in
his Response that he is using this experience to explain to the two children that depend
on him “that your actions can and will catch up to you if you let them.”
