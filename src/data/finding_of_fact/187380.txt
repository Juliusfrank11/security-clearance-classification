Applicant,  52,  is  a  logistics  planner  currently  employed  by  a  federal  contractor
since January 2020. She served an active duty in the Army from January 1994 until she
retired  as  an  E-7  in  January  2018.  Her military  career  included  five  deployments.  She
received a bachelor’s degree in October 2022. She married in 1995 and divorced in 2004.
She married again in 2004 and she and her husband separated in 2019. This is her first
application for a security clearance. (GX 1; Tr. 32-36.)
The  SOR  alleges  22  delinquent  accounts  totaling  $56,564.  The  debts  are
comprised  of  delinquent  credit-card  accounts.  Applicant  admits  each  of  the  debts  and
states that she  has resolved each of them either through 1099-Cs with her 2019/2020
federal  tax  returns  or  directly  with  the  creditors.  The  delinquent  debts  are  reflected  in
Applicant’s January 2022, October 2020, and January 2020 credit-bureau reports (CBR).
(GX 5; GX 4; GX 3.) Applicant’s admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant’s  financial  difficulties  initially  arose  in  2016  when  she  returned  from  a
deployment. She received her pay, paid her ongoing financial obligations, and spent the
remaining  money.  She  was  then  paid  a  second  time  for  the  same  pay  period.  She
contacted the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) and wanted to return the
money  in  a  lump-sum.  However, DFAS  would  not  permit  her to  do  so.  Instead,  DFAS
prorated the repayment over a three-month period. While Applicant and her husband did
not share any primary banking accounts, Applicant’s husband had historically contributed
to  household  and  other  living  expenses.  After  Applicant’s  husband  also  returned  from
deployment  in  2016,  he  stopped  making  financial  contributions  to  the  household.  This
caused Applicant to not have enough money to meet her monthly financial obligations.
She  asked  her  husband  for  financial  assistance  and  he  declined  to  contribute.  The
combination of these events was too great a strain on Applicant’s finances, and she began
to fall behind on her consumer credit-card obligations. (Tr. 28-31; Tr. 62-64.)
Applicant retired from the Army in January 2018. At the end of 2017, she enrolled
in  an  out-of-state  university  because  it  had  a  program  of  study  in  logistics,  and  she
commuted to attend her classes. She initially attended classes full-time. Her income was
her retirement and VA disability pay. While she was able to pay her living expenses and
not incur additional delinquent debt, she was unable to address the consumer credit-card
debt that became delinquent beginning in 2016. In October 2019, she began working at
a local department store to increase her income. (Tr. 36-38.)
In  approximately  2018,  Applicant  became  determined  to  resolve  her  delinquent
accounts. She began contacting her creditors to enter repayment agreements with them.
She attended several credit counseling sessions on her university campus. She learned
methods for negotiating repayment agreements as well as how to prioritize the repayment
of  debts.  Specifically,  she  learned  the  prioritizing  technique  of  paying  as  many  of  the
smallest debts off as quickly as possible rather than small payments on each of the debts.
(Tr. 51-53.)
When she was hired by her current employer in January 2020, Applicant changed
her  school  schedule  to  part-time,  worked  full-time  as  a  government  contractor,  and
continued to work part time at the local department store. She continued to work at the
department store for additional income to address her debts until it permanently closed in
May 2021. (Tr. 36.)
Applicant  stated  that  she  has  resolved  all  of  the  SOR  debts  either  through
repayment  plans  or through  cancellation  of  debt  as  reflected  in  1099-Cs.  She  has  not
been contacted by any of her former creditors since she resolved each of the accounts.
(Tr. 52-53.)
With her answer to the SOR, Applicant provided six 1099-Cs that she filed with her
2019 Federal tax return, as required. She also submitted a 1099-C that she filed with her
2020  federal  tax  return,  as  required.  (AX  E.)  They  correspond  with  the  following  SOR
debts, totaling $27,160:
¶ 1.b  - $3,078;
¶ 1.c - $819 (AX E);
¶ 1.g  - $6,693;
¶ 1.h  - $5,849;
¶ 1.i - $6,394;
¶ 1.q  - $2,369;
¶ 1.t  - $1,958.
Applicant  has  provided  documentation  showing  that  she  has  paid  the  following
accounts, totaling $14,168:
¶ 1.m - $1,331 (AX B; AX J);
¶ 1.o  - $699 (AX G);
¶ 1.p  - $1,180 (AX B; AX J);
¶ 1.r - $8,721 (AX A);
¶ 1.v - $2,237 (AX F).
Applicant combined  the  debts  alleged  in SOR ¶  1.a  - $927,  ¶  1.e  –  $595, ¶  1.j  -
$620, and  ¶  1.k - $397,  totaling  $2,539. These  debts were  owed  to  the  same  creditor and
Applicant paid them off over a six-month period in 2019 to 2020. Applicant stated that she
paid the $1,782 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d on a monthly payment plan, but also thinks
that she received a 1099-C. She has not been contacted by any of her former creditors
since she resolved each of the accounts. (Tr. 52-57; Tr. 90-91.)
On  the advice  she received in  credit counseling, Applicant has been  working to
reestablish her credit. She has opened new credit-card accounts with six of the creditors
of the SOR debts. She was advised to maintain small balances on several accounts long
enough  for  the  accounts  to  be  reported,  then  pay  the  balance  of  the  accounts.
Additionally, Applicant stated that there are several circumstances, such as travel and car
rental, where a credit card is required. (Tr. 77-81.)
In  January 2022,  Applicant’s  total  balance  on  her 16  open  credit-card  accounts
was $19,014 with the highest balance on one credit card being $8,062. As of October 23,
2022, the outstanding total balance on those same accounts is $10,602, with the highest
balance on one credit card being $6,988. She is current on all of her open accounts and
has a overall on-time payment history. Ten of the accounts have a $0 balance. (AX J; GX
5.)
Applicant  purchased   a   car  in  May  2019   with   a   car-loan   amount  of   $13,605.   In
January 2021,  Applicant’s mother totaled  her car. Applicant gave  her car to  her mother
and  purchased  a  used  vehicle  for herself.  She  has continuously made  on-time  payments.
Applicant’s mother also totaled Applicant’s car. Applicant has continued to  make on-time
payments and  the  car-loan  balance  is now approximately $3,200. (Tr. 24; Tr. 48-49; AX
J.)
Since beginning her current job, Applicant has maintained a written budget. She
bought her house in 2014 and her October 2022 CBR shows her mortgage-loan payment
history beginning in May 2015. She has never made a late payment. She refinanced her
house in June 2021 at a considerably lower interest rate. Applicant uses an application
on  her  cell  phone  to  monitor  her  accounts  and  her  credit  score.  The  application  also
provides credit-management tips. Applicant is current on her ongoing financial obligations
and has not incurred any recent delinquent debt. She has a checking account, savings
account, and makes contributions to a 401(k). She has a net monthly remainder. (AX J;
Tr. 49-50; Tr. 82.)

to  be  reliable,  trustworthy,  and  dedicated.  Applicant’s  coworker  and  friend  since  2015
