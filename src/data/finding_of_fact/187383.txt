On  the  page  of  her  Answer  that  listed  subparagraphs,  Applicant  admitted  all
allegations  except  what  she  described  as  ¶¶  1.d,  1.e,  1.i,  1.q,  1.r,  and  1.s,  which  she
denied.  In  what  apparently  was  the  original  first  page  of  her  Answer,  she  did  not  list
subparagraphs, but admitted or denied all but one of the alleged debts by describing the
creditor and debt amount. She did not mention the single debt listed on the first page of
the SOR (¶ 1.a). The Facts section of the FORM simply recited Applicant’s admissions
and  denials  as  stated  in  the  Answer  page  that  contained  subparagraph  notations.
However,  comparison  of  the  two  Answer  pages  and  the  SOR  showed  that  Applicant
mislabeled  the  subparagraphs  on  that  page.  By  merging  the  responses  from  the  two
Answer pages with the SOR’s subparagraph allegations, I determined that she actually
admitted to all of the SOR allegations except SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, 1.j, 1.k, 1.p, and 1.q, which
she denied. Her admissions are incorporated into these findings of fact. (Item 1; Item 2.)
Applicant is 45 years old. She earned a high school diploma in 1996, an associate
degree in 2001, and certification diploma in medical billing and coding in 2006. She never
served in the U.S. military or civil service. She has held a Secret security clearance since
2008. She has never married and has no children. She has worked as a security officer
for  a  security  guard  and  patrol  service  company  since  2011,  after  performing  similar
duties for other contract security companies since at least 2001 without any periods of
unemployment. She has always lived in her parent’s home, except for a one-year period
in 2011 and 2012 when she rented an apartment in a nearby town. (Item 3.)
Applicant said that her financial problems began after she underwent surgery for
a serious chronic medical condition in July 2018, and was on unpaid leave for five and a
half weeks while she recuperated. She said that she lived off her credit cards while not
receiving paychecks, then fell behind on her debts and didn’t know what to do, although
she had always paid her bills before her surgery. She did not submit a budget from which
to determine her living expenses while living in her parent’s home, nor otherwise explain
how she accumulated over $49,000 in delinquent credit card debt while off work for just
over a month. (Item 2; Item 3; Item 4; Item 5; Item 6.)
The status of the 22 SOR-alleged debts, totaling $83,892, is as follows:
SOR  ¶¶   1.a   –   1.d,   1.p   –   1.s:   After  returning   to   work  in   August  2018,   Applicant
incurred   these   eight  delinquent  medical  debts,  totaling   $3,709,  between   January  2019
and  November 2019.  The  individual  amounts due  range  from  $78  to  $1,773.  She  admitted
owing  four of them, totaling  $3,316.  She  denied  the  other four, totaling   $393, because
she said she didn’t receive those bills. The  existence  of all these debts is documented in
record credit reports, and  she  submitted  no  evidence  of any effort to  contact or repay the
creditors.  These  debts remain unresolved.  (Item 2; Item  4; Item 5.)
SOR  ¶¶   1.f  –   1.h, 1.j –   1.o:  Applicant   last made   timely   payments   toward   five   of
these   nine   delinquent credit  card  accounts  during   July or August  2018, and   payments
toward  the  remaining  four between  December 2018  and  November 2019. They have  all
been   charged  off  by  the   creditors,  with   balances  ranging  from   $1,343  to   $10,648,  and
totaling  $49,215. Applicant  said,  in her Answer,  that she  repaid  two of these  debts:  SOR
¶  1.k  in 2019  ($1,343),  and  SOR ¶  1.j  in  2021  ($8,455);  but provided  no  documentation
to  corroborate  this claim.  Applicant’s February 22,  2022  credit  report  stated  that the  ¶  1.j
account  was  paid  in  September  2021,  and  it has a  $0  balance.  However, the  ¶  1.k  account
was  last   reported  on  February 15,   2022,   with   an  unpaid  $1,343   balance   on   that   credit
report. She  made  no  apparent  effort to  resolve  the  remaining  seven  delinquent  credit card
accounts, which remain outstanding.  (Item  2; Item 4;  Item  5;  Item 6.)
SOR ¶¶  1.e, 1.i:  Applicant admitted that she owes two delinquent retailer charge
accounts totaling $1,544. These accounts were placed for collection in August 2019 and
January 2020, after  she  stopped paying them  in  February and May  2019.  She did not
claim to have made any effort to resolve either account. (Item 2; Item 4; Item 6.)
Applicant’s February 2022 credit report listed three additional delinquent debts that
were not alleged in the SOR. These debts total $13,190 and were placed for collection
by three different banks between January and September 2020 after last payments were
made in June or October 2019. These will be considered only in connection with mitigation
and whole person analysis. (Item 4.)
On  January  10,  2018,  Applicant  entered  into  a  $104,800  joint  mortgage  loan,
presumably with her 71-year-old mother whom she lives with and cares for in the longtime
family home. She did not explain the uses to which these funds were put, but her credit
report  shows  that  in  July  2019  she  paid  off  the  seven-year  $41,354  car  loan  she  had
opened  in  May  2017,  rather  than  use  those  funds  to  repay  her  SOR-listed  medical  or
consumer credit debts. (Item 4.)
The  record  contains no  evidence  concerning whether Applicant sought financial
counseling, her job performance, trustworthiness, or character in a professional setting.
It  is  also  silent  with  respect  to  her  track  record  in  handling  sensitive  information  and
observation of security procedures. I was unable to evaluate her credibility, demeanor, or
character in person, since she elected to have her case decided without a hearing.
