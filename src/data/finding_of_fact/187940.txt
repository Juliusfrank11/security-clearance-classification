In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, she admitted all the allegations except SOR ¶
1.f. Her admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  60-year-old  human-resource  manager  employed  by  a  defense
contractor since March 2017. She married in August 1983, divorced in March 1993, and
married in May 2005. She has two adult children and two adult stepchildren. She received
a  bachelor’s  degree  in  May  1986  and  a  master’s  degree  in  May  2008.  She  has  been
employed  steadily  since  about  February  2015.  She  received  a  security  clearance  in
November 2019. (GX 5)
The SOR alleges a Chapter 13 bankruptcy (SOR ¶ 1.a), a failure to timely file a
federal income tax return for 2017 and pay the taxes due (SOR ¶ 1.b), and six delinquent
debts totaling about $10,000 (SOR ¶¶ 1.c-1.h). The bankruptcy filing is reflected in court
records (FORM Item 7), and the delinquent debts are reflected in credit reports from June
2021 and May 2020. (FORM Items 8 and 9)
In Applicant’s SCA, she disclosed that she engaged a tax preparer to prepare and
file her federal income tax 2017 tax return, but the tax preparer failed to file it. Applicant
stated that she was unaware that the return had not been filed until she received a letter
from the IRS. She stated that the return was filed in February 2019, and that she was
making  monthly  payments  on  the  tax  debt.  (FORM  Item  3  at  41)  When  she  was
interviewed by a security investigator in August 2021, she stated that the debt had been
satisfied through a payment plan and diversion of tax refunds. (FORM Item 4 at 10)  In
response to DOHA interrogatories on January 10, 2022, she submitted IRS tax transcripts
reflecting  that  all  tax  returns  for  2017  through  2020  had  been  filed,  an  installment
agreement  was  established  in  April  2019,  six  payments  were  made  in  May  through
November 2019, and her tax debt was satisfied. (FORM Item 4 at 17-23)
Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in December 2019. The delinquent
debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.c-1.h were included in the bankruptcy. Her case was dismissed
in  August  2020  for  failure  to  make  payments  on  the  bankruptcy  plan.  (FORM  Item  7)
When she was interviewed by a security investigator in August 2021, she stated that she
expected that the bankruptcy plan would require payments of about $876. However, when
the plan was finalized, it required payments of $1,523. She told the investigator that, after
making two or three payments, she found that she had insufficient income for her living
expenses.  After  she  missed  two  payments,  she  decided  to  negotiate  directly  with  her
creditors. (FORM Item 4 at 9)
When  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  the  security  investigator,  she  had  not
contacted any of the creditors alleged in the SOR. (FORM Item 4 at 10-11) She told the
investigator that she delayed contacting her creditors after the bankruptcy was dismissed,
because she waited to see if they would contact her. She knew that she could not afford
to pay all her creditors at the same time. (GX 4 at 12) She attributed her financial problems
to overextending herself to help her children pay their bills. (GX 4 at 9)
In  Applicant’s  response  to  the  January  2022  interrogatories,  she  submitted
evidence that she had resolved three debts not alleged in the SOR. (FORM Item 4 at 24-
26) In April 2022, after she received the SOR, she paid the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.c,
1.g, and 1.h. In May 2022, she settled the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e. In June 2022, she
settled the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d and paid the debt alleged in ¶ 1.f. (FORM Item 2 at
4-12; FORM Response at 4-9)
During the security interview, Applicant disclosed that she had traveled on cruises
in 2014 with her husband, in 2015 with friends, in 2017 with her husband, and 2019 with
her husband. (GX 4 at 8) She also disclosed to the investigator that she traded in an older
luxury  car  for  a  newer  two-year-old  luxury  car  after  her  older  car  began  to  have
mechanical problems. The trade-in value of her old car was sufficient to pay off the loan
on that car. Her monthly car payments on the newer car are $735. (GX 4 at 9)
In her response to the FORM, she asserted that her foreign travel did not contribute
to  her  financial  problems.  (FORM  Response  at  2)  She  and  her  husband  keep  their
incomes  separate,  and  they  have  agreed  which  one  will  pay  joint  expenses  such  as
housing, vehicles, and vehicle maintenance. Her husband paid for all the cruises except
one.
