Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.n without further comment. His admissions are
incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings
and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 52 years old. He served in the Navy for 20 years, from May 1991 to
May 2011. He has taken some college courses but has not earned a degree. He has been
employed  in  a  cleared  position  as  an  engineer  with  his  current  employer  or  its
predecessor since July 2013. He previously underwent security investigations in about
March 2007 and July 2012. (Item 2)
Applicant  and  his  first  wife  married  in  April  1996.  They  separated  in  2014  and
divorced in August 2018. He remarried in September 2018. He has three adult children,
and an adult stepson. (Item 2)
The SOR alleges several years of unfiled state and Federal income tax returns,
about  $100,000  in  past-due  Federal  income  taxes,  and  several  charged  off  consumer
debts,  totaling  about  $37,000.  Applicant  admitted  all  the  allegations  in  the  SOR  and
offered no explanation or subsequent evidence. (Item 1)
On  his  April  2020  SCA,  Applicant  disclosed  several  years  of  unfiled  state  and
Federal income tax returns (for tax years (TY) 2014-2017). In his July 2020 background
interview, and then later in interrogatory responses, he acknowledged additional unfiled
state and Federal returns, now encompassing TY 2014-2020. (SOR ¶¶ 1.i, 1.n)
In April 2021, Applicant hired a tax relief service (Service). By contract, the Service
was to provide him with recommendations regarding his tax compliance. Applicant did not
provide any additional evidence detailing what services were ultimately provided. (Item 3)
IRS account transcripts dated March 2022 reflect that the IRS prepared substitute
tax returns for TY 2014-2018. (An IRS tax transcript shows that Applicant timely filed his
2019 tax return and did not owe any past-due taxes.) (Item 4)
IRS  transcripts  further  reflect  that  Applicant  owes  about  $106,154  in  past-due
taxes for 2014-2018. (SOR ¶¶ 1.j-1m) No substitute tax return was submitted for tax year
2020, so any Federal taxes owed for that year are unknown.
Besides W-2 withholdings, the IRS transcripts show that in April 2021, Applicant
made  a  single  $100  payment  towards  his  past-due  Federal  income  tax  debt  of  over
$100,000. (Item 4)
Applicant  admitted   that  he   failed   to   file   his   state   tax   returns  for tax   years   2014-
2020. (SOR ¶  1.n)  He provided no  evidence  to  show that those  returns have  since  been
filed or what his outstanding  state tax liability is, if any. (Item 4)
During his interview, Applicant was initially unable to explain why he did not file or
pay his taxes on time. He later disclosed that he thought it was a way to be vindictive
towards his first wife. (Item 4)
The remainder of Applicant’s debts in the SOR involve charged-off accounts with
private  creditors,  mostly  banks.  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  ($11,225),  1.b  ($7,390),  1.c  ($5,797),  1.d
($4,793) and 1.f ($3,358) are credit-card accounts and loans with a credit union. During
his interview, Applicant stated his intent to start a payment plan with the credit union, but
there is no evidence that he has done so. The debts are unresolved. (Items 3-7)
SOR  ¶  1.e  ($3,408)  is  a  charged-off  credit-card  account.  During  his  interview,
Applicant stated his belief that the account was paid off. However, there is no evidence
in the record of a payment. The debt is unresolved. (Items 3-6)
SOR  ¶  1.g  ($1,271)  is  a  charged-off  credit-card  account.  During  his  interview,
Applicant was unsure whether he owed any amount on this account. The debt is reflected
in Applicant’s credit reports and it is unresolved. (Items 3-6)
SOR  ¶  1.h  ($440)  is  a  charged-off  credit-card  account.  During  his  interview,
Applicant stated his belief that the account was paid off. However, there is no evidence
in the record of a payment. The debt is unresolved. (Items 3-6)
During his interview, Applicant explained that most of his financial struggles were
the result of his separation and divorce. During this period, he experienced financial strain
while attempting to pay for rent, a mortgage, alimony, child support and legal fees.  He
stated he was now able to keep up with his finances and was taking steps to repay his
debts. Applicant said he intends on keeping up with all of his debts going forward.
(Items 4, 6)
Applicant has an annual salary of $100,000 in addition to military retirement and
disability  benefits.  He  estimates  that  he  maintains  a  monthly net  remainder of  $2,780.
Applicant  also  contributes  to  a  401k  retirement  plan  with  an  estimated  balance  of
$40,000-$50,000. (Items 3-4)
Applicant  provided  no  documentation  of  his  efforts  to  pay  or  resolve  either  his
$100,000 Federal income tax debt, state tax filings or delinquent consumer debts.
