Applicant  is  34  years  old  and  single.  He  received  a  bachelor’s  degree  and  a
master’s  degree.  Applicant  has  been  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  as  a  senior
software engineer since March 2019. He seeks to obtain national security eligibility and
a security clearance in connection with his current employment. Applicant has not held a
security clearance in the past. (Item 3 at Sections 12, 13A, 17, and 25.)
Paragraph 1  (Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  has  used  illegal  drugs.  Applicant  admitted  all  the  allegations  under  this
paragraph with explanations.
As  a  general  statement,  Applicant  admitted  that  he  had  an  extensive  history  of
illegal drug abuse when he worked in the restaurant industry before 2014. After he began
school in 2014 his drug use continued as further described below. (Item 3 at Section 23;
Item 4 at 12-14.)
The allegations will be discussed in chronological order:
1.b.   Applicant  used  and  purchased  marijuana  on  various  occasions  from
approximately  May  2006  until  February  2018.  (The  SOR  allegation  that  Applicant’s
marijuana  use  began  in  2003  is  based  on  a  typographical  error  in  the  Report  of
Investigation of an interview of Applicant by a Government investigator dated December
10, 2019.) Applicant’s most frequent use of marijuana occurred between 2006 and 2013.
During that period, he used marijuana on a daily, weekly, or bi-weekly basis. From 2014
to 2018 Applicant used marijuana infrequently. His last use was at a family wedding in
February 2018. (Item 3 at 46-47; Item 4 at 12; Applicant Exhibit B.)
Applicant submitted  a  notarized  statement of intent  dated  February 4, 2022, as  an
attachment  to  his  interrogatory  responses. Part of  that  statement says, “I  am  not  able to
commit to  not associating  with  individuals who  use,  because  many  members of  my  family
use  marijuana, and family is very important to me.” (Item  4 at 19-20.)
1.j.  Applicant  was  arrested  in  July  2007  and  charged  with  Operating  Under  the
Influence of Alcohol, Speeding, and Possession of a Class D Substance: Marijuana. He
stated that he was put on probation for a year and had to obtain counseling. (Item 3 at
42-43; Item 4 at 11.)
1.f.  Applicant  purchased  and  used  hallucinogenic  mushrooms  about  four  times
from about March 2007 to about May 2010. (Item 3 at 47; Item 4 at 13.)
1.g. Applicant purchased and used LSD about four times from about March 2007
to about May 2010. (Item 3 at 47; Item 4 at 13.)
1.c. Applicant used cocaine from about April 2007 to about April 2014. He stated,
“During most of my restaurant career I would use cocaine once every few months, but in
2013 when I was at . . . Steakhouse there was a couple months were [sic] I used once a
week on ‘guys night.’ Towards the end of this I realized that cocaine is basically a waste
of money and I haven’t used it since.” (Item 3 at 47-48; Item 4 at 13; Applicant Exhibit B.)
1.i.  Applicant  was  arrested  in  about  October  2009  and  charged  with  Drug
Possession  of  a  Class  A  Substance:  Heroin.  Applicant  stated  that  the  charges  were
dropped. (Item 3 at 43-44; Item 4 at 11-12.)
1.h.  Applicant  was  arrested  in  December  2009  after  he  was  involved  in  an
automobile  accident.  He  was  charged  with  Negligent  Operation  of  a  Motor  Vehicle,
Marked Lanes Violation, and Possession of a Class D Substance: Marijuana. He stated
that the Possession charge was dropped and he was put on probation for a year. (Item 3
at 44-45; Item 4 at 12.)
Applicant became  addicted  to  prescription  painkillers in approximately 2009  due
to  serious pain in his legs and  feet from  his work in the  restaurant industry. He stated, “I
tried  to  combat this [pain]  with  Aleve  or Ibuprofen, but I eventually started  to  use  stronger
prescription  medication that wasn’t prescribed for me.” (Applicant Exhibit B  at 2.)
1.e. Applicant used the prescription medication Oxycontin that was not prescribed
for him between May 2009 to June 2012. (Item 3 at 50-51; Item 4 at 13.)
1.d.   Applicant  used  the  prescription  medication  Oxymorphone  that  was  not
prescribed  to  him  from  about  May  2011  to  November  2012.  Applicant  used  this  drug
because Oxycontin became more difficult to acquire. (Item 3 at 51; Item 4 at 13.)
1.a.  In  about  May  2012  Applicant  began  using  the  prescription  drug  Suboxone
daily as a way to combat his opioid addiction. Applicant did not obtain a prescription for
it. Rather, he obtained the Suboxone from his father. His use of Suboxone continued for
ten years, until March 2022, just before issuance of the SOR. This was after he submitted
his e-QIP in 2019 and responses to DOHA interrogatories in February 2022. (Item 3 at
51; Item 4 at 13-14.)
Applicant enrolled in a Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) program on March
8, 2022, aimed at persons suffering from Opioid Use Disorder. A Progress Report dated
July 7, 2022, states that Applicant had made eight appointments without any absences.
The  Report  describes  the  program:  “MAT  is  arranged  as  part  of  a  comprehensive
treatment that includes medication with counseling and participation in [a] social support
program.” (Applicant Exhibits A and B at 3.)
Also attached to Applicant Exhibit B, at 4, is a statement dated July 7, 2022, from
a  Lead  Behavioral  Health  Technician  at  the  counseling  center  Applicant  attends.  The
statement  says,  “He  [Applicant]  is currently stable and  seen monthly by provider . . . .
[Applicant] is consistent and appears committed to his recovery by reliably participating
in MAT services. He would benefit from the continuance of medication.”
Applicant  stated  that  he  is  currently  on  the  drug  Buprenorphine,  with  a  proper
prescription to help him combat Opioid Use Disorder. He further stated, “So far, my time
in the MAT program has proven to be stable and successful, so I will continue this route
until this is finally behind me.” (Applicant Exhibit B at 2.)
As  stated,  Applicant  submitted  a  signed  statement  of  intent  that  said  in  part,  “If
issued security clearance, I am willing to abstain from any drug involvement or substance
misuse, and I acknowledge that any future involvement or misuse would be considered
grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.” (Item 4 at 19.)
Paragraph 2  (Guideline  E, Personal Conduct)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  engaged  in  conduct  involving  questionable  judgment,  lack  of  candor,
dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. Applicant did not admit
or deny the sole allegation under this guideline. His silence is viewed as a denial.
2.a.   The  Government  alleges  in  this  subparagraph  that  all  of  the  information  to
which Applicant admitted set forth under paragraph 1, above, is also cognizable under
this guideline.
Paragraph 3  (Guideline  J, Criminal Conduct)
The  Government alleges in this paragraph  that Applicant is ineligible  for  clearance
because   he   has  engaged   in  criminal  conduct  that  creates  doubt  about   a   person’s
judgment,   reliability,  and   trustworthiness.   Applicant  did  not   admit  or  deny   the   sole
allegation under this guideline. His silence is viewed as a denial.
3.a.   The  Government  alleges  in  this  subparagraph  that  all  of  the  information  to
which Applicant admitted set forth under paragraph 1, above, is also cognizable under
this guideline.
The record contains no evidence concerning Applicant’s recent job performance,
trustworthiness,  character  in  a  professional  setting,  or  track  record  with  respect  to
handling sensitive information and observation of job-related security procedures. I was
unable to evaluate his credibility, demeanor, or character in person, since he elected to
have his case decided without a hearing.
