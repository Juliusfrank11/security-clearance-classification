In  his  Answer, Applicant admitted  the  following  allegations:  SOR ¶¶  1.a, 1.c,  1.d,
1.e, 1.g, 1.i, 1.k,  1.l, 1.m, and  1.n. He denied the  allegations in SOR  ¶¶ 1.b, 1.f, 1.h,  and
1. j. He  admitted  the  allegations in SOR ¶¶  2.a  and  2.c; he  denied  the  allegations in SOR
¶¶ 2.b  and  2.d. His admissions  are  incorporated  into  these  findings of fact.  He  did  not
answer the  allegations in SOR ¶ 3.a,  and  in  SOR ¶ 4.a; hence,  they will be construed as
denials.  (Item   1)  After  a   thorough   and   careful  review  of  the   pleadings  and   exhibits
submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 41 years old and has been married three times. From 2006 to 2008,
he was married to Wife 1. They resided in the United States. From 2015 to 2017, he was
married  to  Wife  2.  They  resided  in  South  Korea.  In  2018,  he  married  Wife  3  in  the
Philippines. She, his two children, and a stepchild reside there. At the time he completed
his SCA, he was residing in South Korea (Item 2)
Applicant graduated from high school in 2000. He served in the Army from 2001
to 2018, when he was honorably discharged. In November 2011, he received a security
clearance with a warning that if he failed to resolve his delinquent debts, his clearance
could be suspended. (Item 2, Item 7)
In  January  2020,  Applicant  began  a  position  with  a  defense  contractor.  In  July
2020,  he  submitted  a  security  clearance  application  (SCA).  Prior  to  this  position,  he
worked for two other defense contractors during 2019. He reported that he has been living
in South Korea since January 2020. (Item 2)
In  February,  March,  and  May  2021,  a  government  investigator  interviewed
Applicant  about  background  information.  Subsequently,  the  Government  sent  him
interrogatories,  which  included  a  report  of  his  enhanced  subject  interview.  Applicant
verified that the information contained in the report was accurate. (Item 3)
Financial Considerations
Based on Applicant’s admissions and credit bureau reports (CBR) from September
2022, July 2021, and July 2020, the SOR alleged 12 delinquent debts totaling $57,815,
which became delinquent between 2015 and 2022. (Items 4, 5, and 6) The status of those
debts is as follows:
Applicant  admitted  owing  the  debts  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  ($25,016);  1.c  ($2,494);  1.d
($1,336); 1.e ($1,260); 1.g ($463); 1.i ($337); 1.k ($3,759); and 1.l ($13,694). They total
$48,359. Applicant did not submit evidence to prove they are paid or being paid.
Applicant denied owing the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b ($7,456); 1.f ($1,228); 1.h ($436);
and 1.j ($336). He presented proof that he resolved the $7,456 debt in SOR ¶ 1.b. (Item
at 7). He did not provide documentation that he resolved the other three, which total $772.
During a February 2021 interview, Applicant did not recognize all of the debts that
the government investigator asked him about but said he would pay those that are legally
his obligation. He said he did not have money to pay his debts because his former wife,
Wife 2, created a financial hardship for him and spent all his money. He also disclosed
that he  was paying  the  Defense  Finance and  Accounting  Services  (DFAS)  15%  of his
salary through a garnishment. He owed $13,694 for a part of the reenlistment bonus he
received but was not entitled to because he left the Army before the end of the enlistment
period. (Item 2 at 50, Item 3 at 5, 8, 10)
Under  Guideline  F,  the  SOR  alleged  in  ¶  1.m  that  in  October  2018,  Applicant
received  nonjudicial  punishment  (NJP)  for  violations  of  the  Uniform  Code  of  Military
Justice  (UCMJ)  Article  92,  for  wrongfully  borrowing  money  from  two  junior  enlisted
soldiers,  and  Article  134,  for  dishonorably  failing  to  repay  another  junior  soldier  from
whom he borrowed money for personal expenses. He was subsequently reduced in rank,
forfeited pay, and received an oral reprimand. Applicant disclosed this information during
his February 2021 interview. (Item 1, Item 3 at 3-4)
The SOR alleged in ¶ 1.n that in November 2016, Applicant received NJP for a
violation  of  the  UCMJ,  Article  107,  for  making  multiple  false  statements  that  he  was
obtaining funds to help him pay his rent, and a  violation of Article 134 for dishonorably
failing to then pay his rent. He received an oral reprimand, 45 days of extra duty, and a
reduction in rank. At the time he made the false statements, he was in Belgium and told
the soldier that he would obtain the money from his wife, who was in a different country,
to repay the money he borrowed. (Item 2, Item 3 at 3-4)
Foreign Influence
As noted above, I take administrative notice of the facts about the Philippines that
were  set  forth  in  the  official  U.S.  Government  publications  that  were  attached  to
include  that  the
Department  Counsel’s  request  for  administrative  notice.  These
Philippines  are  a  constitutional  republic  with  a  bicameral  legislature.  Its  citizens  and
foreigners have been targeted by domestic and transnational terrorist groups for many
years.  The  U.S.  State  Department  warns  U.S.  citizens  to  reconsider  travel  to  the
Philippines due to the presence of terrorism, crime, civil unrest, and rampant kidnappings.
There  are  significant  human  rights  abuses  with  respect  to  detainees  and  personal
freedoms. (Item 8)
In  response  to  SOR  ¶  2.a,  Applicant  admitted  that  his  wife,  two  children,  his
stepchild, father-in-law, and mother-in-law are citizens and residents of the Philippines.
In his July 2020 SCA, he reported that  the last time he saw his family was in January
2020 when he visited them. He sees his in-laws whenever he visits his children. He said
his family does not have connections to the Philippines’ government or military. (Item 2
at 6-7, 31-39) During his interview in February 2021, he reported that he visited his family
in  the  Philippines  from  November  2018  to  March  2019,  and  in  September  2019  for
fourteen days. He also traveled there in 2015 to see his former spouse, Wife 2. (Item 3 at
7)
During  his  February  2021  interview,  Applicant  stated  that  he  and  his  current
spouse, Wife 3, own a residence in the Philippines, which his wife purchased in 2019.
The property has a value of about US $3,000. His relatives are aware of their ownership
of the property. (Item 3 at 6) In his Answer to SOR ¶  2.b, Applicant denied owning the
property, but offered no explanation for his denial.
During his February 2021 interview, Applicant admitted that since November 2020,
he had been having an affair with a woman who is a Moroccan citizen. He said that he
had daily contact with her since then. He was living in South Korea at the time. (Item 3 at
7)
In his Answer to SOR ¶ 2.c, which alleged that he failed to report that affair to his
employer, Applicant admitted that he did not report it because he was starting to divorce
Wife 3. He did not think his wife was aware of his infidelity. (Item 3 at 7)
In his Answer to SOR ¶ 2.d, which alleged that Applicant had been conducting an
extramarital affair with a foreign person since November 2020, while residing outside of
the United States, Applicant denied the allegation. He provided no information explaining
the discrepancy between his admission during his interview and his denial in his Answer.
Sexual Behavior
In SOR ¶ 3.a, the Government cross-alleged under this guideline the allegations
in SOR ¶ 2.c and SOR ¶ 2.d. Applicant admitted the allegation in SOR ¶ 2.c, and denied
the allegation in SOR ¶ 2.d, which is inconsistent with his previous admission.
Personal Conduct
In SOR ¶ 4.a, the Government cross-alleged under this guideline the allegations
in  SOR  ¶¶  1.m,  1.n,  2.c,  and  2.d.  As  noted  above,  Applicant  admitted  all  allegations,
except SOR ¶ 2.d, to which he gave an answer inconsistent with a previous admission,
and without an explanation.
