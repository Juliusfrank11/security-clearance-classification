Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
The  SOR  alleges  under  Guideline  H  that  Applicant  had  used  marijuana  with
varying frequency from December 2011 through November 2020. (SOR ¶ 1.a.) His use
of  marijuana  continued  after he had  been granted a  DOD security  clearance in  March
2018.  He  denied  both  of  the  allegations.  He  did  not  provide  an  explanation  of  the
circumstances or time period of his marijuana use in his Answer to the SOR. (Items 1 and
2)
Applicant listed in his December 2016 security clearance application (SCA) that he
had used marijuana from December 2011 through December 2013. He described his use
as  experimental  and  primarily  in  college.  He  also  stated  that  he  did  not  intend  to  use
marijuana in the future. He acknowledged marijuana use was illegal, and he did not like
the way it made him feel. (Item 3)
Applicant  completed  another  SCA  in  March  2021.  He  disclosed  that  he  used
marijuana from December 2011 through November 2020. His continued use of marijuana
occurred after college and after he claimed he had no intent to use marijuana in the future.
Based  on  the  information  he  disclosed  in  the  2021  SCA,  his  use  of  marijuana  also
occurred after he was hired by his sponsoring employer in June 2015, and after he was
issued a DOD security clearance in March 2018. (Item 4)
Applicant was interviewed on May 28, 2021, by an authorized DOD investigator.
Applicant  admitted  that  he  sporadically  used  marijuana  between  December  2011  and
November  2020.  His  most  recent  use  occurred  during  the  pandemic,  and  he  had
purchased it from a dispensary in his state where marijuana use is legal. After using it, he
realized that although marijuana is legal in his state of residence, it is considered illegal
under federal law. He used marijuana while possessing a security clearance because he
was  not  clear  about  the  laws.  He  told  the  investigator  that  he  did  not  intend  to  use
marijuana in the future. (Item 5)
