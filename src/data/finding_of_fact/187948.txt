Applicant  is  33  years  old  and  single.  He  received  a  bachelor’s  degree  and  is
currently studying for his master’s. Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor
as an engineer since September 2020 and seeks to obtain national security eligibility and
a  security  clearance  in  connection  with  his  current  employment.  He  had  worked  for
another defense  contractor from 2013  to  2020.  (Government  Exhibit  1  at  Sections  12,
13A, and 17.)
Paragraph 1  (Guideline  J, Criminal Conduct)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  has  engaged  in  criminal  conduct  that  creates  doubt  about  a  person’s
judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Applicant admitted both allegations under this
guideline.
1.a.  Applicant  was  arrested  on  December  28,  2016,  and  charged  with  Felony
Assault with a Deadly Weapon. Applicant stated that he was extremely intoxicated that
night and does not really remember the event. However, Applicant admitted he hit another
person in the head with a glass during a bar fight. The glass broke, the other person was
injured, and Applicant was arrested. Applicant subsequently pled guilty in May 2017 to
the Assault with a Deadly Weapon charge. He was sentenced to five years of supervised
probation,  two  days  in  jail,  and  30  days  community  labor.  (Government  Exhibit  1  at
Section 22, Exhibit 4 at pages 10-11.)
Applicant’s probation terms included the following, as described by Applicant:
Do  not  use  or  possess  any  narcotics,  dangerous  or  restricted  drugs  or
associated  paraphernalia,  except  with  a  valid  prescription  and  stay  away
from places where users or sellers congregate. Do not associate with drug
users or sellers unless attending a drug treatment program. . . Abstain from
the  use  of  alcoholic  beverages,  including  beer  and  wine,  and  stay  out  of
places  where  they  are  the  chief  items  of  sale.  .  .  You  [Applicant]  are
specifically ordered not to use or possess any quantity of marijuana, even
with  an  otherwise  valid  prescription  or  recommendation.  (Government
Exhibit 1 at Section 22.)
Applicant’s  probation  ended  in  May  2022.  (Tr.  49.)  He  repeatedly  violated  the
above terms of his probation as described below.
1.b.  Applicant used illegal drugs and alcohol on a frequent basis from May 2017
through June 2019 while he was on probation for the offense set forth in 1.a, above. He
knew his conduct was in violation of his probation. Applicant admitted that he did not tell
the probation department at any time that he was violating his probation. He stated that
he discussed telling the probation department about his drug and alcohol use once he
stopped using all drugs and alcohol after June 2019. He was advised by relatives that he
should not do so, since admitting to a probation violation may require him to go to jail or
prison.  Applicant  agreed  not  to  tell  probation  personnel  about  his  conduct.  Applicant
stated that his probation officer never asked Applicant if he used drugs or alcohol during
his mandatory monthly interviews. (Government Exhibit 4 at 24-25; Tr. 52-54.)
Paragraph 2  (Guideline  G, Alcohol Consumption)
The  Government alleges in this paragraph  that Applicant is ineligible  for  clearance
because  he  consumes  intoxicants to  excess.  Applicant admitted  both  allegations under
this guideline.
2.a. Refer to that information set forth under subparagraph 1.a, above.
2.b.  Applicant  used  alcohol  from  May  2017 through  December  2018.  He  stated
that from about the middle of 2018 until September 2018 he consumed alcohol frequently
and excessively. During that time, as set forth under paragraph 1, above, Applicant was
on probation and required to abstain from any use of alcohol. Applicant was interviewed
by a Government investigator on March 2, 2021. The investigator’s Report of Investigation
(ROI) stated, “He [Applicant] decided to keep drinking alcohol during the time he was on
probation  because  he  had  already  violated  his  probation  at  that  time.”  (Government
Exhibit 1 at Section 24; Exhibit 4 at pages 12, 22-23; Tr. 54-55.)
Paragraph 3  (Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  has  used  illegal  drugs.  Applicant  admitted  all  the  allegations  under  this
paragraph with explanations.
As a preliminary matter, Applicant held a security clearance from approximately
January 2015  through March  2017.  According  to  Applicant  his clearance  was  revoked
due  to  the  criminal charges  set  forth  in  paragraph  1,  above.  (Government  Exhibit  1  at
Section 25.)
3.a. Applicant used marijuana on various occasions from approximately February
2003 until July 2019. As stated, between January 2015 and March 2017 Applicant was
granted access to classified information. He used marijuana daily from June to December
2018. Applicant stopped use for several months until he last used marijuana with an ex-
girlfriend in July 2019. (Government Exhibit 4 at pages 8-19.)
3.b.  Applicant  used  cocaine  on  various  occasions  from  May  2010  to  December
2018. As stated, between January 2015 and March 2017 Applicant was granted access
to  classified  information.  He  used  cocaine  weekly  during  2017.  He  used  cocaine  daily
during 2018 until his last use around New Year’s 2018/19. (Government Exhibit 4 at pages
19-20.)
3.c.  Applicant  used  cocaine  at  work  while  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  in
2018. He stated in his Answer, “I used at an unclassified site with no classified information
present, nor any secure rooms or locations present at the facility.” (Government Exhibit 4
at pages 19-20.)
3.d. Applicant used Ecstasy one time in June 2010 and a second time in July 2018.
It is further alleged that Applicant’s 2018 use of Ecstasy occurred while he was granted
access  to  classified  information.  The  record  is  unclear  as  to  whether  he  actually  had
access in July 2018. He stated in his Answer that his clearance was under reinvestigation
at that time, and he may have had an interim clearance. However, Government Exhibit 5,
a  DISS/CATS  Incident  Report,  stated  Applicant’s  “Eligibility  Level”  was  “none.”  The
document also stated, under “Eligibility Determination,” “’No Determination Made’ made
on  2019-02-11  by  DoD  CAF.”  (Internal  punctuation  added  for  clarity.)  (Government
Exhibit 4 at pages 20, 24; Tr. 51-52.) Given the state of the evidence this allegation is
found for Applicant.
3.e. Applicant used hallucinogenic mushrooms one time in about November 2018.
It is further alleged that Applicant’s 2018 use of hallucinogenic mushrooms occurred while
he was granted access to classified information. The record is unclear as to whether he
actually had access in July 2018. He stated in his Answer that his clearance was under
reinvestigation  at  that  time,  and  he  may  have  had  an  interim  clearance.  However,
Government Exhibit 5, a DISS/CATS Incident Report, stated Applicant’s “Eligibility Level”
was  “none.”  The  document  also  stated,  under  “Eligibility  Determination,”  “’No
Determination Made’ made on 2019-02-11 by DoD CAF.” (Internal punctuation added for
clarity.)  (Government  Exhibit  4  at  pages  20-21,  24;  Tr.  51-52.)  Given  the  state  of  the
evidence this allegation is found for Applicant.
3.f.  Applicant  admitted
that  he  used  marijuana,  cocaine,  Ecstasy  and
Hallucinogenic Mushrooms between at least May 2017 and July 2019 as set forth above.
During that period, he was prohibited from using any illegal drugs under the terms of his
probation.  He  stated  in  his  Answer  that  his  use,  including  daily  use  of  cocaine  and
marijuana,  was  because,  “I  was  under  extreme  depression  and  anxiety  due  to  the
circumstances that arose from my arrest in December 2016 as stated in subparagraph
1.a.” (Answer; Government Exhibit 4 at pages 18-21; Tr. 49.)
With regard to his drug use, as well as his alcohol use, Applicant stated that he
made a conscious decision at the end of 2018 to stop using all the substances in order to
live a better, healthier life. He also stated that his decision was the result of a religious
awakening  in  his  life.  Applicant  testified  that  his  management  is  aware  of  his  past.
However,  no  additional  information  was  forwarded  by  Applicant  from  his  current
employers setting forth the extent of their knowledge. (Government Exhibit 4 at 18; Tr.
42-48, 54-55.)
Paragraph 4  (Guideline  E, Personal Conduct)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  has  falsified  material  facts  during  the  clearance  screening  process.  In
addition, it is alleged that Applicant engaged in conduct involving questionable judgment,
lack  of  candor,  dishonesty,  or  unwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and  regulations.
Applicant admitted both allegations under this paragraph with explanations.
4.a.  The Government alleges in this subparagraph that all of the information set
forth under paragraphs 1, 2, and 3, above, is also cognizable under this guideline.
4.b. Applicant submitted an e-QIP on January 11, 2018. (Government Exhibit 2.)
Section 23 concerned Illegal Use of Drugs and Drug Activity. Applicant was specifically
asked,  “In  the  last  (7)  seven  years,  have  you  illegally  used  any  drugs  or  controlled
substances?” Applicant answered, “Yes.” He disclosed marijuana use between 2003 and
2013,  cocaine  use  in  2010,  and  Ecstasy  use  in  2010.  These  were  false  answers  to
relevant questions about Applicant’s drug involvement. In his Answer, Applicant explained
this conduct:
Note that while I falsified information at this time, I was using alcohol and
drugs and was not applying my best judgment. The substance abuse did
create my conduct to be questionable and this is what caused me to falsify
information. Another reason was my fear of admission of substance abuse
could be reported to my probation officer and this would cause me to serve
my suspended sentence.
Applicant was forthcoming on a 2020 questionnaire and in subsequent interviews
with Government investigators. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section 23; Government Exhibit
4 at pages 18-21, 25; Tr. 50.)
Mitigation
The  pastor of Applicant’s church testified  on   his behalf. The  witness has known
Applicant  for  three   years.  He  testified   at  length   about  what  the   witness  views  as
Applicant’s personal growth  in the  past three  years. The  witness had  knowledge  of  the
allegations  in  the   SOR.  He  stated   that  Applicant  has  been   open   with   him   about  his
conduct  and   about   his  battle   with   alcohol  and   drugs.   Applicant   provides   substantial
financial   support   to   the   church.   The   witness  believes  Applicant   to   be   trustworthy.
(Applicant Exhibit A; Tr. 17-40.)
