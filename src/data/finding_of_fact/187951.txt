Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.k, 1.m, and 1.n, and he denied SOR ¶1.l. He is
61 years old, married, and he has two adult children. He graduated from high school in
1979, and he attended some college but did not earn a degree. He served honorably in
the  U.S.  Navy  from  1982  until  he  retired  in  1998.  He  has  worked  for  various  DOD
contractors since 1999, except for two periods of unemployment from February 2014 to
October 2014 and February 2016 to April 2016. He has worked as a field engineer for his
employer,  a  DOD  contractor,  since  April  2017.  He  has  also  worked  as  a  part-time
overnight  stocker  for  a  retail  corporation  since  August  2018.  He  was  first  granted  a
security clearance in 1985. As of his October 2020 security clearance application (SCA),
he owned a home since 1999. (Answer; Tr. at 5-6, 8-9, 31-33, 66, 71-73, 85-86; GE 1-2)
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  had  13  delinquent  consumer  debts  totaling
$44,956. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.m) It also alleged that he failed to file, as required, his federal
income  tax  return  for  tax  year  (TY)  2019.  (SOR  ¶  1.n)  The  SOR  allegations  are
established  by  Applicant’s  admissions  in  his  Answer,  his  SCA,  his  interviews  with  a
background  investigator  in  January  2021  and  February  2021,  and  three  credit  bureau
reports from 2021 to 2022. (Answer; GE 1-5)
Applicant attributed his financial difficulties, and his failure to timely file his federal
income tax return for TY 2019, to a loss of income from approximately October 2015 to
February 2016, when his previous employer experienced issues receiving funds from its
contract with the U.S. Government. As a result, his employer decreased his monthly work
hours from 160 hours to 20 to 30 hours. His employer ultimately lost its contract, and he
was unemployed from February 2016 to April 2016, as noted above. Although he obtained
another job, his annual income decreased from $85,000 to $52,000.  Simultaneously in
2016, his spouse lost her job due to an injury, and her disability claim was rejected. He
has since been the sole breadwinner. (Answer; Tr. at 16-18, 68-76, 78-79, 81, 89-90; GE
1-2; AE H)
In 2017, Applicant sought advice from a bankruptcy attorney, who advised him to
cease  payments  on  his  debts  and  provide  his  creditors  with  the  bankruptcy  attorney’s
information. He did so, and he stopped hearing from his creditors. He ultimately elected
to resolve his debts on his own because he could not afford the  bankruptcy attorney’s
fees. In 2018, as noted above, he obtained a part-time job to supplement his income so
that he could address his debts. He completed his federal income tax return for TY 2019,
but because his financial constraints affected his ability to pay approximately $2,000 in
federal taxes he expected to owe for that tax year, he did not timely file that return. He
learned about several of his delinquent debts through the security clearance process. He
was tackling his debts one at a time and he intended to resolve them all. (Answer; Tr. at
16-18, 68-76, 78-79, 81, 89-90; GE 1-2; AE H)

Applicant contacted the creditor regarding the debts in SOR  ¶¶ 1.l and 1.m. He
reached a payment plan for one, and he was referred to another creditor for the other and
that creditor had no record of the debt. He re-contacted the creditor in November 2022 to

SOR ¶  1.n relates to  Applicant’s failure to  timely file,  as required, his federal income
tax return for TY  2019.  As noted  above,  he  completed  his  federal income  tax return for
TY 2019, but because  his financial constraints affected  his ability to  pay approximately
$2,000  in  federal taxes  he  expected  to  owe for that tax  year, he  did  not timely file that
return. He  mailed his federal income  tax return for TY 2019 in July 2021, and then  he  re-
sent  it to  the  IRS  in  December 2021  after  the  IRS  informed  him  that  it did  not receive  it.
He   simultaneously  submitted   a   payment   request   form.   He   timely  filed   his   income   tax
returns for TY 2020 and 2021.  (Answer; Tr. at 17, 62-65, 86-92; GE  1-2; AE G, H)
Although  not  alleged  in  the  SOR,  Applicant  owes  $1,129  for  TY  2019,
approximately  $1,800  in  federal  taxes  for  TY  2020,  and  approximately  $2,000  in  state
taxes for TY 2020 and 2021. He received a federal refund for TY 2021, which the IRS did
not intercept and apply to his outstanding federal taxes for TY 2019. He contacted the
IRS, and the IRS told him that it would accept a monthly payment arrangement of $500
to resolve his TY 2019 debt. He intends to enter such a payment arrangement as soon
as he has the financial means to do so. He has been paying the state tax authority $195
monthly towards his TY 2020 and 2021 taxes. (Answer; Tr. at 17, 62-65, 86-92; GE 1-2;
AE G, H)

$7,000 in his 401(k)-retirement savings account. He was current on his $1,305 monthly

obtained  credit  counseling  but  intended  to  do  so.  His  spouse  manages  the  household
expenses,  and  they  pay  their  bills  together.  She  stated  that  he  is  a  trustworthy  and
honorable man. Four individuals, to include Applicant’s site lead, attested to Applicant’s
trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment. (Tr. at 31-32, 64-71, 76-79, 85-86, 89-90,
