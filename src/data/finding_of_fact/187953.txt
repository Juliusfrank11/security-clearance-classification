In   his  Answer  to   the   SOR,  Applicant  admitted   the   five   debts  alleged   under
Guideline   F   (SOR  ¶¶   1.a   through   1.e)  but   denied   the   falsification   allegation   under
Guideline   E   (SOR  ¶   2.a).  His   admissions   and   explanations   are   incorporated   into   the
findings   of   fact.   After   a   thorough   and   careful  review   of   the   pleadings  and   exhibits
submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 54 years old. He married his wife in 1999 and they separated in 2013.
He  references  children  in  his  February  2021  background  interview,  but  no  details  are
provided. He has a longtime cohabitant. (Items 3, 5) Applicant served in the U.S. Air Force
Reserve  from  1996  to  2008  and  was  discharged  honorably.  He  attended  community
college while in the Air Force but did not earn a degree. (Item 3)
After leaving the Air Force, Applicant worked for several months in Afghanistan for
a large defense contractor (2010-2011). He returned to the U.S. when the contract ended
and was then unemployed from July 2011 to November 2012. He then spent five years
(2012-2017) as an employee of the transit system for a major U.S. city. He left to relocate
to another state. He was again unemployed from November 2017 to March 2019, living
off his savings. From March 2019 to September 2020, he worked in the Middle East as a
mechanic for a U.S. aerospace company. He was briefly unemployed at the end of 2020
when that contract ended. Since December 2020, he been sponsored for a clearance by
a new employer, for a job in aviation. (Item 3) In his February 2021 background interview,
he  indicated  that  he  had  not  yet  begun  working  for  the  company,  as  the  job  required
transfer to Iraq, and he had only recently received a visa. (Item 5)
In Applicant’s undated response to DOD Interrogatories sent to him in July 2021
about  his  finances,  Applicant  references  an  unspecified  “health  setback”  in  2018  from
which,  he  said,  he  was  only  then  recovering  from.  (Item  4  at  9).  In  his  Answer,  he
referenced  an  unexpected  “financial  loss”  in  2018  but  he  gave  no  details.  In  his
background  interview,  he  stated  that  he  tried  to  start  a  business  as  a  mechanic  and
purchased tools in order to do so, but the business never materialized. He took no action
on his debts because he believed they had been written off by the creditors. (Item 5)
The SOR debts total just under $32,500. The record includes credit bureau reports
(CBRs) from October 2021 and January 2021 (Items 7, 8), which, along with Applicant’s
admissions, establish the delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR.
In an interrogatory response to the CAF in July 2021, Applicant was asked about
all  five  of  the  debts.  He  said  he  had  recently  made  arrangements  to  pay  them,  and
provided phone numbers for the creditors, but no documents about them. (Item 5 at 9)
The debts are detailed as follows. The documents discussed were all provided with
Applicant’s Answer:
SOR ¶¶  1.a ($7,020) and  1.e ($3,398) are accounts that were both charged off by
the same financial services company (accounts #1077 and #1012, respectively).
For SOR ¶  1.a  (#1077), which concerns a pickup truck, he provided a settlement
offer  from  the  company  for  about  $3,510.  He  provided  three  checks,  apparently  from
February,  March,  and  April  2022,  for  $1,200,  $1,200,  and  the  balance  of  $1,109.96.
(Answer) This account is resolved.
For SOR ¶  1.e (#1012), Applicant provided a February 2022 settlement offer from
the company noting that the balance ($1,417) could be settled for a one-time payment of
$283. Applicant settled the debt with a check in February 2022. (Answer Attachments)
This account is resolved.
SOR  ¶   1.b   ($6,136)  is  an  account  that  was  charged  off  by  tool  company  S.
Applicant  provided  an  October  2021  letter  from  the  creditor  referencing  a  payment
schedule of $50 per week to begin in October 2021. The balance owed is not referenced,
and there is no indication whether there is a settlement or the full amount owed is to be
paid.  (Answer  attachment)  No  subsequent  documents  are  included  with  Applicant’s
Answer so no payments are documented. This debt is not resolved.
SOR  ¶   1.c   ($1,088)  is  an  account  that  was  placed  for  collection  by  a  phone
company. Applicant provided an October 2021 letter showing payments to be made of
$172  in  October  2021  and  November  2021,  with  the  balance  at  $888.  (Answer
attachment) He appears to indicate in his Answer that the account has been paid, but this
is not documented. The account is not reflected on a February 2022 credit report provided
with the Answer. No subsequent documents are included with Applicant’s Answer so no
payments are documented. This debt is not resolved.
SOR  ¶   1.d   ($14,792)  is  an  account  that  was  charged  off  by  tool  company  M.
Applicant provided a letter from the collection law firm showing a balance of $20,075 as
of February 7, 2022, with one payment of $200 to be made two weeks later.  An earlier
letter,  dated  September  10,  2021,  shows  a  balance  at  that  time  of  $20,875.  (Answer
Attachments)  No  subsequent  documents  are  included  with  Applicant’s  Answer  so  no
payments are documented. This debt was apparently being paid at the time, though the
amount  owed  (about  $20,000)  is  more  than  what  was  alleged.  The  account  is  not
resolved.
Applicant  provided  a  personal  financial  statement  (PFS)  with  his  July  2021
interrogatory response. He reported net monthly income of just under $9,800, monthly
expenses of $3,135 and a $435 monthly car payment. He did not list any payments for
his SOR debts. He listed a net remainder of $3,970. (Item 4)
Applicant did not disclose  any of these  delinquent debts on  his SCA, but he  did
volunteer in his February 2021  background  interview that he  had  delinquent debts,  mostly
involving  a  loan  and  debts  to  tool companies. He said  he  did  not have  information  about
his debts available  when  he  prepared  his SCA, so  he  could not list  any debts. (Item  5  at
2) He also explained  in his Answer that at the  time  he  filled  out his SCA,  he  was recovering
from  pneumonia  and  was hospitalized  for a  week following  a  mild  heart attack. He  was
not  working   at  the   time.   He  requests  consideration   to   be   allowed   to   continue   his
employment and earning income for his family. (Item 2)
Applicant  did  not  respond  to  the  Government’s  FORM,  so  he  did  not  provide
updated documents or other, more recent information regarding any payments towards
his  debts  after  February  2022,  or  any  more  recent  information  about  his  income,
expenses, or overall financial stability and ability to address his debts. He did not indicate
that he has participated in recent credit counseling or follows a budget (other than his July
2021 PFS).
