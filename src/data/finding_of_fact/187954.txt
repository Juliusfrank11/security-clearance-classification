Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.f, 1.g, 1.j, 1.k, 1.l, 1.m, and he denied SOR ¶¶ 1.a,
1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.h. 1.i, and 1.n in his Answer. He is 40 years old. He married in 2016
and divorced in 2018. He has one child. He earned his high school diploma in 2000. He
served  in  the  National Guard  from 2002  to 2011,  when  he  was  honorably  discharged.
He  attended  college  from 2015  to  2016  but did  not  earn a  degree. He  has  worked  for
various DOD contractors since 2002, except when he worked part time for a university
from 2005 to 2006. He was also unemployed from August 2007 to November 2007, and
from  July  2018  to  October  2018.  As  of  his  December  2020  background  interview,  he
had  worked  as  a  desk  manager  for his  employer, a  DOD contractor,  since  May  2020.
He was first granted a security clearance in 2006. (Items 1-6)
The  SOR  alleges  under  Guideline  F  that  Applicant  had  four  delinquent  student
loans  totaling  $11,082  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.d);  seven  delinquent  consumer  debts  totaling
$6,518 (SOR ¶¶ 1.e-1.k); $251 in child support arrears (SOR ¶ 1.l); and two judgments,
from  2011  and  2016,  for  $12,019  and  $5,721,  respectively  (SOR  ¶¶  1.m-1.n).  The
allegations  are  established  by  his  admissions  in  his  Answer,  a  March  2018  security
clearance application (SCA), a December 2020 background interview, his responses to
interrogatories from August 2021 and April 2022, court records, and three credit bureau
reports from October 2020 to February 2022. (Items 1-7, 9-11)
Applicant attributed his delinquent debts primarily to his youth. He also incurred
his  debts  while  attending  school,  during  his  periods  of  unemployment,  or  when  he
earned minimal income. He also cited his divorce as a contributing factor. He earned a
minimal income when he was ordered in 2009  to pay $1,006 monthly in  child support,
and  he  could  not  always  fulfill  this  obligation.  His  tax  refunds  have  been  intercepted
yearly  and  applied  to  his  child  support  arrears,  and  he  intended  to  address  his
delinquent debts after he resolved his arrears. (Items 2-5)
A  May 2022  payment summary reflects that Applicant has been  paying  his  child
support obligation  in  SOR  ¶  1.l since  at  least  July 2021. He  stated  that he  paid  SOR  ¶¶
1.a  through  1.d,  1.j,  and  1.n,  and  that  he  was  paying  SOR  ¶¶  1.g  and  1.k,  but he  did  not
provide   documentation   to   corroborate   his   claims.   He  did   not  provide   any  information
about the  status  of  SOR ¶¶  1.e,  1.f,  or  1.i.  He  stated  that  SOR ¶¶  1.h  and  1.m  are  older
than   seven   years,  and   although  he  made  attempts  to  address  these   debts,   he   did not
feel obligated  to  continue  to  do  so  as he  expected  them  to  be  removed from  his credit
bureau  reports  given their age.  (Items  2-5)
Applicant’s   August  2021   personal  financial   statement   reflects  a   net  monthly
income   of  $3,076,  and   a   net   monthly  remainder  of   $537   after  expenses.   It   does  not
reflect payments to any of the  SOR debts,  except for his child  support obligation  in SOR
¶   1.l.  The   most  recent  credit  bureau   report   from   October  2022   does  not  reflect  any
delinquent  debts.  There  is no  evidence  that he  received  any credit  counseling.  (Items  4-
5, 8)
