Applicant is 42 years old and has two sons ages 19 and 20, who live with her. She
and her cohabitant have lived together since January 2008. She married her first husband
in  June  1998;  they  divorced  in  November  2000.  She  married  her  second  husband  in
August 2005; they divorced in May 2009. Since February 2016, she has worked full-time
for a defense contractor. (GE 3; Tr. 17.)
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant is past due for $7,837 on a loan
whose total balance is $39,687. The SOR also alleged that she is past due for $21,549
on  a  mortgage  whose  total  balance  is  $191,579.  (SOR  ¶  1.)  She  admitted  both
allegations,  with  explanations  during  her  testimony.  From  June  2007  until  December
2020, she and her family lived in the home that is the subject of the two SOR allegations
(the Townhouse). (Answer; Tr. 23; GE 1.)
Direct Testimony. Applicant testified that she bought the Townhouse in 2007. In
2008 the market crashed. Almost immediately her home mortgage was underwater. As
the mortgage remained underwater for years during the financial  crisis, COVID struck.
She contacted the mortgage company to try a short sale. It denied that, saying she could
use COVID relief. But she could not afford to sell the Townhouse without a short sale.
She also asked about a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. The mortgage company said it was
not doing those because of the President’s mandate against foreclosures during COVID.
(Tr. 15.)
Applicant  testified  that  the  Townhouse  was  never  refinanced,  but  the  mortgage
loan might have been sold a few times. It was an 80/20 loan. That was what mortgage
companies were doing in 2007. It was an interest-only loan. She was trying to get out of
the  loan,  because  she  was  having  problems  with  rodents  getting  into  the  Townhouse.
She could not stop them, because her home was connected to everyone else in that row.
She could only clean up and close holes in her home. She also found a copperhead snake
in her basement. (Tr. 15-16.)
At this point, Applicant offered two exhibits. The first, marked AEA, was identified
as a Judgment of Absolute Divorce dated May 6, 2009, captioned XYZ v. Applicant, in
the Circuit Court for State A. (XYZ was her second husband. GE 1.)  AEA involves the
disposition  of  her  and  her  second  husband’s  home  (the  Marital  Home).  The  second,
marked  AEB,  was  a  photograph  of  a  copperhead  snake  she  found  in  her  basement.
Applicant ended her direct testimony. (Tr. 16-17.)
Cross-Examination. Applicant works for a contracting company doing Information
Technology.  She  has  worked  there  for  seven  years.  Her  annual  gross  pay  is  about
$85,000.  She  has  worked  full-time  for a  federal contractor since 2001.  She has had a
Secret security clearance since 2011, and her current employer is her security clearance
sponsor. (Tr. 18-20.)
Applicant’s cohabitant works in construction and makes about $45,000 per year.
He is the father of both her sons. She, her sons, and her cohabitant live in State A (the
Residence).  She is on the deed for the Residence, but not on the loan. She is not on the
loan, because she did not want to be on the loan. She helps with household bills but not
with the mortgage. She is asked about a $711 per month rental charge on GE 5. That
rent is for her son’s apartment when he is at college. Neither of her sons pay rent to her
cohabitant, nor do they help with the mortgage.  Only one of her sons is in college; the
other son works. (Tr. 20-22.)
Applicant  was  questioned  about  the  SOR.  When  she  bought  the  Townhouse  in
2007, she did not intend it to be a rental property. The purchase price was $225,000. After
the purchase, she and her family moved in. Asked about its market value now, she was
unsure,  “like $200,000, maybe.”  She was asked whether online estimates of $224,000
and $253,000 seemed “about right.” She answered “no;” they were “too high.” She based
her $200,000 on “other ones that have sold recently in the area.” (Tr. 22-24.)
Applicant  was  referred   to   GE   2,   page  7, account   11.  (GE 2   is a   credit  report of
2/24/2022.) The  “opening  date”  is when  she  bought the  Townhouse  in June  2007.  But
the  $180,000  high  credit is not the  only loan; she  bought the  Townhouse  for  $225,000.
There  were   two   loans  “technically.”   The   other  loan   was  for  $45,000,   for  a   total   of
$225,000,  the   sale  price.  She   did  not  use   her  own  money  for  a   down  payment.   She
confirmed  that  she  never refinanced  her Townhouse  mortgages, saying: “How can  you
refinance   a   loan   that’s  under  water?”   Applicant  was  asked   if  the   “bank  has  changed
payments?” She replied that: “[They]  sell loans. I didn’t do it. It was –  the  banks.” (Tr. 25-
27.)
Applicant was referred to GE 4, page 5, top two entries. (GE 4 is a credit report of
8/2/2011.) She was asked how the $180,000 loan balance was reduced by only $22 in
four years. She explained that it was an interest-only loan. She testified that was what
mortgage companies were doing in 2007.  That was the only way she could get a loan
and  “out of the  of the  house  to  get away from  my ex-husband with my children.”  She
explained that the $45,000 loan balance was reduced by only $222, because it too was
an interest-only loan.  (Tr. 27- 31.)
Applicant was asked why she stopped paying her two Townhouse mortgages in
April or May 2020.  She stopped paying to qualify for a short sale. The mortgage company
said since she was paying on time, “they wouldn’t work with me.” They did not approve
her short sale. She has not paid on the Townhouse mortgages, since the spring of 2020.
She  moved  out  in  December  2020.  The  mortgage  companies  are  in  the  process  of
foreclosure. (Tr. 31-32.)
Applicant was asked if she hired an exterminator about the snake. She did not but
said:  “We  went  around  the  house. We  closed  up  all  the  holes  like  you’re  supposed  to.
You know, you put vents on the thing. We did everything we could do.” A neighbor came
in and killed the snake. She never saw another snake, but she did not stay long after the
photo of the snake (AEB) was taken in June 2020.  Her Townhouse was a middle unit,
with units on the left and right. She tried her best to close up holes or gaps between her
Townhouse and her neighbors. But “stuff was still getting in.” The Townhouse complex
is in the country surrounded by woods. (Tr. 23-24, 33-34.
After moving out in the summer of 2020, Applicant has never tried to rent or sell
the Townhouse. She has keys to the Townhouse but believes the bank has changed the
locks.  She  was  referred  to  GE  11,  page  7,  account  13.  (GE  11  is  a  credit  report  of
1/23/2023.)  She “had no clue” her mortgage account had been transferred until she saw
GE 11. She received nothing in the mail from the new mortgagee shown on GE 11. Every
once  in  a  while  she  receives  statements  from  the  lender  shown  in  SOR  ¶  1.b.  but  no
phone calls. She submitted paperwork for her short sale request, but that lender denied
it. (Tr. 34-37.)
Applicant’s short sale was denied, because the bank kept saying she could use
COVID  relief.  She  no  longer  felt  safe  in  the  house,  and  her  family  had  outgrown  the
Townhouse.  She  tried  to  hold  on  to  it  as  long  as  she  could.  She  understood  that  the
COVID program could be a pause on the payments or lower the mortgage payments but
would not get her out of her underwater loan. (Tr. 37-38.)
Applicant has nothing in writing from a real estate broker as to what her Townhouse
could sell for. She has not spoken with one since she left in December 2020, because
she was trying to work with the banks.  Her opinion that the Townhouse is worth about
$200,000 is based on comparable sales in the area. When she left the Townhouse, “they
were going for a lot less.” Her plan is to keep working with the mortgage company, but it
has “sold it [the mortgage] again, so she will need  “to track down the latest number [for
the latest mortgage holder].” (Tr. 38-39.)
Applicant  was  referred  to  GE  10,  page  2,  second  paragraph.  (GE  10  is  the
Personal Subject Interview (PSI) of 9/2/2021.) She was asked if it was still her plan to let
the Townhouse go into foreclosure, if she cannot work out a sale? She answered: “The
loan is underwater. I mean I’m trying to work with the mortgage company. I can’t afford to
pay the difference of what I owe and what the house would sell for.” In the PSI, she said
she  could not  “maintain  two  mortgages.” She  clarified  that  it is “not really a mortgage.”
She is paying household bills at her current Residence. (Tr. 39-40.)
When Applicant lived in the Townhouse, she did not pay homeowner’s association
fees. She was responsible for outside upkeep. After she left, she and a neighbor mowed
the yard; it was very little. The Townhouse still has water, but when she left, she turned
off the electricity. She is up to date with all utilities. (Tr. 40.)
Applicant was  referred  to  GE  11,  account  12. The  entry shows  a  joint  mortgage.
She  confirmed that the  mortgage  is on  her parents’ house.  She  is on  that  mortgage.  Her
father  lost   his  job.  So,   she   signed   on   to   the   loan,  so   her  parents  would  not  lose   their
house. It  was not a  refinancing.  They bought the  house  in about 2005. She  pays nothing
on  their  house. She  has never helped  them  pay the  mortgage. She  believes she  is on  the
deed. If  her parents sold the  house,  she  would  not  receive  any  of the  proceeds.  (Tr. 41-
42.)
Applicant was referred to GE 6. (GE 6 is a Notice of Default of 10/20/2009.) She
confirmed that this is about a foreclosure on the Marital Home she owned with her second
husband. She was referred to GE 4, page 4, the last entry. (GE 4 is a credit report of
8/2/2011.)  She  believes  that  transaction  was  a  transfer,  not  a  refinance.  She  was  not
involved  in  that  transfer;  it  was  all  handled  by  her  second  husband.  There  was  no
deficiency. (Tr. 42-44.)
Applicant  testified that she does  not have any  delinquent or collection  accounts
that have not been discussed during the hearing. Applicant was referred to GE 11, page
4, account 3. That account was opened in July 2022, with a balance of $16,130. She was
asked why the balance was so high. She explained that there were car issues, braces,
wisdom teeth pulled, and college.  (Tr. 44-45.)
Department  Counsel  asked  a  series  of  questions  about  Applicant’s  personal
finances and spending habits. Her answers did not prompt any follow-up by Department
Counsel. Cross-examination ended. Tr. 45-48.)
Redirect Testimony.  Applicant testified that they had mice in the Townhouse.
They were getting into the kitchen. It was so bad “all the food had to go into containers
just to keep them out.” When she was trying to qualify for a short sale, she had to be in
default before the lender “would even talk to [her] about it.”  She reiterated that COVID
relief would not help her with the loan being underwater. It would lower her payments for
perhaps six months but would not help sell the house.  Applicant provided a third page to
complete AEA. (Tr. 50-53.)
Recross-examination. No new material information was gleaned during re-cross.
(Tr. 52-53.)
Applicant’s relevant credit history follows:
2011: GE 4, page 7 shows both Townhouse mortgages to be Pays As Agreed. At
page 6, there is a foreclosure reported where the creditor “reclaimed the collateral to settle
defaulted mortgage.” This appears to be the Marital Home, the foreclosure of which under
court order was handled by Applicant’s former husband. All other accounts are Pays as
Agreed.
2021: GE 3, pages 2 and 3 show both Townhouse mortgages past due. All other
accounts are Pays As Agreed.
2022: GE 2, accounts 7 and 11  show both Townhouse mortgages past due. All
other accounts have no balances past due.
2023: GE 11, accounts 13 and 18 show both Townhouse mortgages past due. All
other accounts have no balances past due.
Law and Policies
It   is  well  established   that  no   one   has  a   right  to   a   security  clearance.  As  the
Supreme   Court  held,  “the   clearly  consistent  standard
that   security
determinations should err, if they must,  on  the  side  of denials.” Department of the  Navy
v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).
indicates
When   evaluating   an   applicant’s  suitability
for  a   security  clearance,  an
administrative   judge   must   consider   the   adjudicative   guidelines.   These   guidelines   are
flexible  rules of law that apply together with  common  sense  and  the  general factors of the
whole-person  concept.  An  administrative  judge  must consider all  available and  reliable
information  about  the  person,  past and  present,  favorable  and  unfavorable, in making  a
decision.  The   protection   of   the   national  security  is  the   paramount   consideration.   AG  ¶
¶2(b)  requires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning   personnel  being   considered   for  national
security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.”
Under  Directive  ¶   E3.1.14,   the   Government   must  present  evidence   to   establish
controverted  facts alleged  in  the  SOR. Under Directive ¶  E3.1.15,  then  the  applicant  is
responsible  for presenting  “witnesses and  other evidence  to  rebut,  explain, extenuate, or
mitigate  facts admitted  by applicant or proven  by Department Counsel . . . .” The  applicant
has the  ultimate  burden of persuasion in seeking a  favorable security decision.
