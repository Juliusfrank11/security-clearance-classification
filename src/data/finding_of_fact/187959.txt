Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a government contractor for whom he has
worked  since  July  2021.  He  also  worked  part-time  for  another  government  contractor
from  2018  until  November  2021.  He  married  in  2003,  but  his  wife  passed  away  in
November 2022. He was living separate and apart from his wife at the time of her death.
He has two children, ages 19 and 17. He earned a high school diploma in 1994. He has
taken  some  college  and  technical  courses,  but  he  has  not  earned  another  degree  or
certificate.  He  served  on  active  duty  in  the  Navy  from  1998  until  2006,  earning  an
honorable  discharge.  He  served  in  the  Navy  Reserve  from  2006  until  2012,  when  he
returned to active duty with the Navy until July 2020, when he was released with a bad-
conduct discharge. (Tr. 22-27, 55-57; GE 1, 6)
In   April  and   May  2018,  while  working   at  the   DOD  Inspector  General  (DOD  IG)
Hotline  Center, on  two  separate  occasions, Applicant  used  his cell  phone  to  take  under-
the-dress photographs  of two  of his female colleagues  (collectively the  “victims”)  without
their   knowledge   or  consent.   One   of  the   victims   notified   the   U.S.  Naval  Criminal
Investigative   Service   (NCIS),  which   opened   an   investigation   into   the   incident.   Based
upon  the  NCIS  investigation, the  Navy charged  him  under the  Uniform  Code  of Military
Justice   (UCMJ)  Article  120c  (other   sexual  misconduct:   indecent  viewing,   visual
recording,  or  broadcasting).   In   2019,  after  a   court-martial,   he   pleaded   guilty   and   was
convicted  of this charge.  He was sentenced  to  eight months confinement  and  reduction
in rank. He was  released  with  a  bad-conduct  discharge.  In SOR ¶  1.a, the  Government
alleged  Applicant’s 2018  behavior  in  taking the  photographs. In SOR ¶  2.a,  it alleged  his
conviction   and   sentence   pursuant   to   UCMJ  Article  120c.   It   also   alleged   a   violation   of
UCMJ  Article  92,  failure  to   obey  an  order  or  regulation   charge   and   conviction   and   his
bad-conduct discharge  in SOR ¶  2.a.  In  the  Answer, Applicant admitted  the  allegations
in  SOR ¶¶  1.a  and  2.a. His  admissions are adopted  as findings of  fact.  Other than  his
admission,  there  is  no   evidence   of  a   2019   UCMJ  Article   92   charge   or  conviction.   (Tr.
18-21; 27-32;  Answer;  GE 1-3, 6; AE  A)
Applicant claimed that he was going through a bad time between 2015 and 2018.
He  claimed  he  and  his  wife  were  having  marital  problems.  He  claimed  he  was
dissatisfied with his job and did not want to be there. He claimed that there was nothing
sexual about the pictures he took, but that he was acting out to get caught. He thought
that  if  he  got  in  trouble,  the  Navy  would  move  him  to  a  different  role.  He  was  having
trouble  with  his  life  and  did  not  know  how  to  handle  it.  He  claimed  his  time  in
confinement gave him clarity and he is now in a better  place. He claimed that he took
“multiple  hours”  of  behavioral  counseling  where  he  learned  that  he  had post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. He did not specify the dates of his counseling
sessions. He did not provide documentation related to this counseling, a diagnosis, or a
prognosis.  He claimed that he now understands how to  appropriately deal with  stress,
and that he will not engage in this type of behavior again. (Tr. 18-21; Answer)
Sometime  in  the  summer  of  2017,  Applicant  filmed  his  wife  while  she  was
unclothed  in  her  bedroom  without  her  knowledge  or  consent.  He  used  an  iPad  and
filmed  her  through  the  crack  between  her bedroom  door and  the  floor.  He  claimed  he
was  trying  to  catch  her  being  unfaithful  because  he  suspected  she  was  with  another
man. Any adverse information not alleged in the SOR, such as Applicant filming his wife
without her knowledge or consent, will not be considered for disqualification purposes;
however,  it  may  be  considered  in  assessing an  applicant’s  credibility;  in  evaluating  an
in
applicant’s  evidence  of  extenuation,  mitigation,  or  changed  circumstances;
considering  whether  the  applicant  has  demonstrated  successful  rehabilitation;  and  in
applying the whole-person concept. (ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 16,
2017)). (Tr. 32-35; GE 2)
In  about  April  2018,  Applicant  was  counseled  at  work  for  making  inappropriate
comments  to  a  female  colleague  regarding  her  appearance.  His  inappropriate
comments  made  his  female  colleague  feel  uncomfortable,  so  she  filed  a  complaint
against  him.  Applicant’s  supervisor  told  him  that  he  would  be  reassigned  if  anything
similar  happened  again.  The  Government  did  not  allege  this  information  in  the  SOR.
(GE 2)
While  Applicant  claimed  to  be  remorseful  for  his  actions,  he  also  deflected  the
blame and responsibility for his actions to others. He claimed the court-martial process
was  unfair  as  he  was not  allowed  to  tell  his side  of  the  story. He  claimed  that  he  had
been  caught  up  in  the  “Me  Too”  movement  and  was  judged  more  harshly  than
appropriate  because  of  the  timing  of  his  offenses.  He  claimed  that  the  victims  were
coerced  into  requesting  that  he  receive  a  harsher sentence  than  they  otherwise  might
have.  He  also  claimed  that  he  would  not  receive  a  fair  outcome  from  his  security
clearance adjudication. In short, he casts himself as the victim and has not  fully taken
responsibility for his illegal actions. (Answer; AE A)
In the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant’s six delinquent financial accounts
totaling  approximately  $29,000  (SOR  ¶¶  3.a  through  3.f).  Applicant  admitted  the  SOR
allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.c and 1.e. His admissions are adopted as findings
of  fact.  He  denied  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.d  and  1.f.  Despite  his  denials,  the
allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.f are established by the Government’s 2020, 2021, and
2023 credit reports.  (SOR; Answer; GE 4-7)
The  judgments  entered  in  April  2018  and  January  2020  in  favor  of  Applicant’s
homeowner’s  association  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  3.a  and  3.b  have  not  been  resolved.
Applicant  claimed  that  he  made  a  payment  of  about  $4,000  toward  these  judgments
sometime  in  2022.  He  also  claimed  that  he  is  paying  a  little  bit  extra  towards  these
obligations every month. He provided no documentation to corroborate these payments.
He  is  unsure  how  he  fell  behind  on  payments  to  his  homeowner’s  association  but
suspected his wife was supposed to pay this obligation and failed to do so. He claimed
he will continue to pay a little extra every month until these judgments are resolved. (Tr.

The  delinquent  car  loan  in  the  amount  of  $6,499  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  3.c  has  not
been resolved. Applicant claimed that he fell behind on this loan when he was confined.
He  claimed  his  wife  was  supposed  to  make  payments  on  this  loan  while  he  was
incarcerated but she did not. However, in his November 2020 security interview, he also
claimed  that  he  did  not  want  the  car  any  longer.  He  claimed  that  he  made  payments
again  once  he  was  no  longer  incarcerated,  but  he  was  not  able  to  catch  up  on  his
delinquency.  He  claimed  that  he  will  pay  this  account  through  payment  arrangements
when  he  is  able  to  do  so.  The  2023  credit  report  reflects  a  last  payment  date  of
February 2020. He provided no documentation about the resolution of this debt. (Tr. 20,
38-43, 60-61; Answer; GE 4-7, 9)
The delinquent credit card in the amount of $2,927 alleged in SOR ¶ 3.d has not
been  resolved.  Applicant  claimed that  he  did  not open  this account  and  he  disputed  it
with the credit reporting agencies several times. The account was opened in September
2015. He claimed that his wife had power of attorney for him while he was deployed and
may  have  opened  it  without  his  knowledge.  The  last  time  he  deployed  was  between
February  and  October  2014.  He  did  not  provide  documentation  to  corroborate  his
disputes  with  the  credit  reporting  agencies  or  the  creditor,  nor  did  he  offer  any  other
resolution  of  this  debt.  The  Government’s  2020,  2021,  and  2023  credit  reports  do  not
reflect  a  dispute  with  respect  to  this  account.  This  account  appears  on  all  three  credit
reports. The 2023 credit report reflects a last payment date of September 2016. (Tr. 20,
40, 43-46, 59-60; Answer; GE 4-7)
The  delinquent  car  loan  in  the  amount  of  $9,909  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  3.e  has  not
been resolved. Applicant claimed that he took out this loan to purchase a car for his wife
because she could not afford to pay for it herself. He opened the account in April 2017
and last made a payment on it in July 2019. He claimed that he did not know the loan
was  delinquent  because  his  wife  was  receiving  the  statements  for  it.  He  also  claimed
that he could not afford to pay for the vehicle, but he agreed to open the account for his
wife  as  an  act  of  kindness.  He  claimed  that  he  will  pay  this  account  through  payment
arrangements when he is able to do so. (Tr. 20, 44-45, 60-61; Answer; GE 4-7)
The  delinquent  telecommunications  account  in  the  amount  of  $2,027  alleged  in
SOR ¶ 3.f has been resolved. Applicant claimed that he did not open this account. He
claimed  that  he  disputed  it  with  the  credit  reporting  agencies.  Although  he  did  not
provide  documentation  to  corroborate  his  dispute,  the  debt  no  longer  appears  on  his
2023 credit report. While this account’s absence on a subsequent credit report could be
for  reasons  other  than  a  favorable  resolution,  his  claimed  dispute,  combined  with  the
absence of the account on a subsequent credit report, provide sufficient evidence of a
favorable resolution. (Tr. 20, 45-47, 58-59)
Applicant  owes  the  IRS  about  $900  in  delinquent  federal  income  taxes  for  the
2018  tax  year.  He  owed  about  $3,000  until  2022,  when  he  made  a  payment  of  about
$2,100. These delinquent federal taxes were not alleged in the SOR. (Tr. 47-48)
Applicant earns between $83,000 and $84,000 in annual wages. He earns about
$5,200  per  month.  He  receives  a  monthly  Veterans  Affairs  (VA)  disability  payment  of
$2,215. While working his part-time job, he also earned about $22 to $23 per hour for
the 16-30 hours per week he worked. He claimed that he has about $4,000 combined in
his  checking  and  savings  account.  He  provided  no  documentation  to  corroborate  his
income,  benefits,  or  account  balances.  He  provided  no  evidence  that  he  has  sought
financial counseling. (Tr. 25-26, 53-58)
