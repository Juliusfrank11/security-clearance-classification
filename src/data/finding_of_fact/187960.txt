These allegations are established by Applicant’s: (1) January 12, 2021 SF-86; (2)
July  6,  2022  Response  to  DOHA  Interrogatories,  including  tax  documentation  and
adopting  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  April  23  and  May  5,  2021  Personal
Subject Interview(s) (PSI); (3) February 27, 2021, August 13, 2021, and April 13, 2022
credit  reports;  (4)  Lexis  Nexis  Public  Records  –  Bankruptcy,  Judgments  and  Liens
search results; and (5) August 11, 2021 SOR Answer. (GE 1-6; SOR Answer)
SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b - During her April 23, 2021 OPM PSI, Applicant stated that
she did not file her Federal and state income tax returns because she thought that she
would not owe any money because she did not work much. Sometime in 2018 or 2019,
she  retained  the  services  of a tax preparer service  (TPS)  to file her Federal and  state
income tax returns for 2017, 2018, and 2019; however, she did file them until 2022. See
below.  The  TPS  determined  that  she  owed  approximately  $1,300  to  the  IRS.  She  did
not  pay  any  delinquent  taxes  owed  at  that  time  relying  on  her  TPS  to  negotiate  a
reduced balance. She fired that TPS because they were not effective in negotiating any
type of settlement or payment plan with the IRS or her state tax authority. As of the date
of  her  OPM  PSI,  she  had  not  paid  any  of  her  delinquent  taxes  because  she  was
attempting  to  negotiate  a  payment  plan  with  the  IRS  and  her  state  tax  authority.  After
Applicant  fired  her  TPS,  her  fiancé  has  been  helping  her  with  her  tax  returns.  (Tr.  68;
GE 2)
SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c – 1.e, 1.g - In her Response to DOHA Interrogatories and during
her testimony, Applicant stated that she filed her Federal income tax return for tax year
2016 on November 1, 2018, and filed her Federal income tax returns for tax years 2017
through  2021  on  March  6,  2022.  However,  copies  of  her  Federal  tax  transcripts
indicated  that  the  IRS  received  her  2016  and  2017  Federal  income  tax  returns  on
October  17,  2018,  but  did  not  receive  her  2018  through  2021  Federal  tax  returns.
Applicant insisted that she filed all of her Federal income tax returns. She noted in her
Response  to  DOHA  Interrogatories  that  she  owed  the  IRS  $1,985  for  tax  year  2016,
$3,696 for tax year 2019, and $2,775 for tax year 2020. (Tr. 26-33; GE 2) Also, in her
July 6, 2022 Response to DOHA Interrogatories, she stated that her current outstanding
Federal tax liability was $1,985 for tax year 2016, $3,696 for tax year 2019, and $2,775
for tax year 2020. (GE 2)
SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b - Post-hearing, Applicant submitted copies of her 2018 and
2019  Federal tax transcripts  that  the IRS processed  on  March 11, 2022, and April  18,
2022,  respectively.  (Tr.  37-41;  AE  B,  AE  C)  Although  Applicant  did  not  provide
documentation  that  the  IRS  received  her  2020  and  2021  Federal  income  tax  returns,
given the staggered dates of  IRS receipt, I accept her explanation that she did submit
them;  however, they were  not timely filed  as  required. Applicant  testified  that she  was
disabled in 2018. Applicant did not have a “good reason” for not filing her tax returns as
required other than she did not think she made enough money. She did not file her tax
returns until getting a clearance became a priority. (Tr. 48-49)
SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.f - In her Response to DOHA Interrogatories, Applicant stated
that she filed her state income tax returns for tax years 2016 and 2017 on October 15,
2018,  filed  her state  income tax returns  for tax  years 2018, 2019, and 2020 on March
10, 2022, and filed her state income tax return for tax year 2021 on February 27, 2022.
She  noted  in  her  Response  to  DOHA  Interrogatories  that  she  owed  her  state  tax
authority  $2,014  for  tax  year  2019  and  $2,171  for  tax  year 2020.  (GE  2)  Post-hearing
she  submitted  documentation  from  her  state  tax  authority  that  her  state  income  tax
returns  were  filed  from  2016  through  2021,  and  that  she  owed  her  state  tax  authority
$2,017  for  tax  year  2019  and  $3,214  for  tax  year  2021.  (AE  A)  She  also  submitted
documentation from her state tax authority that they had issued a garnishment order to
her employer to collect $5,213 owed for tax years 2019 and 2020. (Tr. 32-37, 41-42; AE
F)
SOR  ¶  1.h  –  With  regard  to  the  $10,000  debt  owed  to  Applicant’s  state  of
residence for collecting unauthorized unemployment benefits, Applicant stated that she
“was having problems with [her] marriage” and went back to the Philippines in the 2006
to  2008  timeframe.  (Tr.  21-26)  In  her  April  4,  2021  OPM  PSI,  Applicant  stated  that
between 2005 and 2010, she would work between two and four months in her state of
residence at temporary jobs and then to  go to the Philippines for the remainder of the
year. While in the Philippines, she collected unemployment from her state of residence.
Applicant  believed  that  she  was  permitted  to  do  this  because  she  was  still  looking  for
work  in  her  state  of  residence  despite  being  in  the  Philippines.  During  a  routine
interview with her state unemployment office, Applicant was informed that this practice
was  not  permitted  and  that  she  would  have  to  repay  the  money  she  received.  (GE  2)
Applicant did not have the money to repay the unemployment benefits received and in
June  2017,  her  state  of  residence  began  garnishing  her  wages.  (GE  2)  Post-hearing,
Applicant  submitted  documentation  that  as  of  October  10,  2022,  the  balance  owed  to
her  state  of  residence  for  receiving  unauthorized  unemployment  benefits  was  $1,464.
(Tr. 49-53; AE D, AE E)
SOR  ¶¶ 1.i,  1.j,  1.k –  Applicant  stated that  she  does not  recognize these  debts
claiming  that  she  never  went  to  these  medical  facilities.  She  did  not  provide  any
documentation  that  she  had  contacted  these  creditors,  disputed  these  debts,  or
otherwise resolved these debts with these creditors. (Tr. 42-43)
Applicant was alerted to the  Government’s  concerns regarding her failure to file
her  Federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  during  her  April  23,  2021  OPM  PSI.  She
stated  during  that  interview  that  she  planned  on  contacting  the  IRS  and  her  state  tax
authority to work out a payment plan by the end of May 2021. (GE 2) During that same
interview, she was alerted to the Government’s concerns regarding her other delinquent
accounts. (GE 2) Applicant was later advised of the  Government’s concerns regarding
her failure to file her Federal and state tax income tax returns and delinquent accounts
when she received her August 3, 2022 SOR.
Foreign Influence
The SOR alleges one allegation under this concern. It states that Applicant owns
a  home  and  land  in  the  Philippines  with  an  approximate  value  of  $3,000  to  $6,000.
(SOR ¶ 2.a) Applicant admitted this allegation. (SOR Answer)
Applicant testified that a cousin who raised her and that she viewed as a mother
figure  passed  away  in  2012  and  left  her  that  property.  Applicant  most  recently  visited
the  property  in  the  Philippines  in  September  2022.  Her  niece  lives  in  the  house  and
serves as caretaker of the property and rice field. When Applicant retires in “maybe four
to five years,” she plans to split her time between the United States and on her property
in the Philippines. (Tr. 43-46)
As noted, Applicant was born in the Philippines and graduated from high school
there. (Tr. 53; GE 1) She  immigrated to the United States in April 1982 and became a
naturalized U.S. citizen in January 1990. Her father was working in the United States at
the  time  he  petitioned  to  have  her  join  him.  Applicant  was  issued  a  U.S.  passport  in
August 2021. Her two adult sons are U.S.-born citizens. (Tr. 53-55) Applicant gave her
fiancé  $5,000  to  assist  him  with  the  down  payment  of  the  house  they  live  in,  but  her
name is not on the title. As of the date of her hearing, she had $69 in her bank savings
account,  $96  in  her  credit  union  savings  account,  and  $149  in  her  bank  checking
account.  She  has  three  401k  retirement  accounts  with  a  combined  value  of
approximately $30,000. She owns free and clear a 2014 BMW. Her take home pay less
garnishments is about $400 weekly. She is registered to vote and exercises her right to
vote. (Tr. 55-60)
Applicant stays in contact with both of her sons, but more so with her older son.
She has three brothers and two  sisters and all of them live in the United States. All of
her siblings are naturalized U.S. citizens. She remains in contact with all of them using
various platforms. (Tr. 61-63; GE 2)
