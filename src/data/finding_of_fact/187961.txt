In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, she admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.c. She denied
SOR ¶ 1.b. Her admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and
careful  review of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the  following  additional
findings of fact.
Applicant is 47 years-old. She has been married twice. She has two adult children.
She separated from her second husband in December 2016. (Item 3 at 23.) She earned
her bachelor’s degree in 2002. (Item 3 at 11.)
Applicant  lost  her  job  in  January  2017  and  moved  from  outside  the  continental
United States (OCONUS) to the continental United States (CONUS) to obtain work. (Item
2  at  5.)  She  obtained  employment  in  April  2017  and  remained  with  the  company  until
February 2018. (Item 3 at 14.) Thereafter, until May 2018, she lists just March 2018 as a
period of unemployment, when she was hired by her sponsor as a senior manufacturing
planner. (Item 3 at 13-14.)
Applicant’s  debts  consist  of  a  personal  loan  in  a  charged-off  status;  an  unpaid
deposit for an apartment application in collection; and the balance on a mortgage account
that is in foreclosure status. The three delinquent debts total over $73,800. She attributes
the delinquent debts to separation from her husband,  loss of employment, subsequent
unemployment, and costs associated with moving to CONUS to obtain employment after
losing  her  job.  Prior  to  the  job  loss  and  move,  she  states  her  debts  “were  managed.”
(Response.)
SOR  ¶  1.a:  past-due  account  charged  off  in  the  amount  of  $9,798.  Applicant
acknowledges the debt on her SCA. (Item 3 at 39-40.) In her January 3, 2022 ESI she
disputed  the  balance,  citing  payments  she  had  made  and  money  she  requested  be
applied to the loan. (Item 5 at 2.) The May 23, 2022 credit report shows the status of the
debt as a charged-off account, with a last activity date of February 2017. (Item 6 at 2.) In
her Answer she states that before she moved, the loan was paid according to the loan
agreement. She offered that “once the mortgage loan gets resolved, I will know how much
I have available to comply with a payment plan and complete the payment of the loan.”
(Item  2  at  3.)  In  her  response  she  provided  an  agreement  with  the  creditor  dated
December 16, 2022. The agreement calls for  monthly payments of $125  beginning on
January  20,  2023,  with  an  agreement  that  “After  six months,  changes  in  messages  to
credit agencies will be evaluated.” (AE B.) This debt is not resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.b: past-due account referred for collection for $192. She denied the debt
in her Answer and her dispute was noted on her October 1, 2021 credit report. (Item 7 at
3.) In her Response she stated she was 100% certain she did not owe this debt and that
she had never lived in the apartment complex. She states that because an investigation
could take 30 to 60 days to complete, she would rather pay the amount and get it off her
credit report. She provided a letter from the creditor dated January 4, 2023, stating it had
received final payment on the account and the debt was now satisfied. (AE C.) This debt
is resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.c: past-due mortgage account for $63,810, with a total loan balance of
$233,350,  that  is  in  foreclosure  status.  (Item  3  at  38.)  Applicant  states  the  mortgage
payments were consistently made on time until she lost her job and was forced to move
in  January 2017.  Her efforts were  further  complicated  by  the  hurricane  that  struck  her
location in September 2017. (Item 2 at 5.) Her husband filed for divorce in 2019 and for
bankruptcy in 2021, which complicated the foreclosure action. (Item 2 at 5.) She cites the
COVID pandemic for disrupting normal services which prevented the foreclosure. (Item 2
at 5.) She offered in her Response a letter dated November 2, 2022,  from her current
mortgage  holder  denying  her  request  for  a  modified  payment  plan  on  the  basis  the
modified  payment  would  cause  her  debt-to-income  ratio  to  exceed  the  program’s
guidelines.  (AE  A at  1.)  She  cites  in her Response  multiple  trips  to  her old  location  to
“manage the process” and find a solution. Based on her previous attempts to resolve this
debt and the fact the foreclosure process has started; she now believes  the process of
foreclosure on the house is the best way to  resolve the  debt “due to the economy and
dynamics of the process in [her previous location].” (Response.) This debt is not resolved.
