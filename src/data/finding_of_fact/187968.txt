Applicant is a  40-year-old employee  of  a  government  contractor  for whom  he  has
worked  as a   consultant  since  about   December  2020.   He has   also   been   self-employed
as a  consultant  since about July 2017.  He is  a  citizen  of Nigeria  and  a  naturalized  U.S.
citizen.   He  earned   a  bachelor’s  degree   in  2004   and   a   master’s  degree   in  2010.  He  is
twice divorced.  He married  for the  third  time  in  December 2017.  He is a  father to  seven-
year-old twins  and  a three-year-old.  (Tr.  20-27,  65;  GE  1, 2)
In  the  SOR,  the  Government  alleged  Applicant’s  two  delinquent  debts  totaling
approximately  $35,000  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b).  These  delinquencies  were  for  credit
cards. Applicant admitted both SOR allegations. His admissions are adopted as findings
of fact and  are corroborated  by the  Government’s  February 2023 and May 2022 credit
reports.  Despite  being  required  to  do  so,  Applicant  did  not  divulge  these  financial
delinquencies  on  his  October  2021  security  clearance  application  (SCA).  During  his
November  2021  security  interview,  he  did  not  disclose  these  delinquencies  until  the
investigator confronted him with them. These failures to voluntarily divulge his financial
delinquencies  were  not  listed  on  the  SOR.  Any  adverse  information  not  alleged  in  the
SOR, such as Applicant’s failure to divulge financial delinquencies, cannot be used for
disqualification  purposes;  however,  it  may  be  considered  in  assessing  an  applicant’s
credibility;  in  evaluating  an  applicant’s  evidence  of extenuation, mitigation,  or changed
circumstances;  in  considering  whether  the  applicant  has  demonstrated  successful
rehabilitation; and in applying the whole-person concept. (ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3
(App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017)). (SOR; Answer; GE 2-4)
The delinquent credit card in the amount of $20,848 listed in SOR ¶ 1.a has been
resolved. Applicant opened this credit card in June 2016 to pay for living expenses. He
became delinquent on the account in February 2020. He claimed he fell behind on this
account  because  of  the  extra  expenses  he  incurred  because  one  of  his  children  was
diagnosed with autism. He also claimed that he was not making nearly as much money
in February 2020 as he currently does. During his November 2021 security interview, he
claimed that he had a dispute with some of the charges on the account. He provided no
documentation  to  corroborate  or  substantiate  the  nature  or  validity  of  his  dispute  with
the  charges  on  this  account.  He  first  contacted  the  creditor  to  settle  this  account  in
about January or February 2022. After a delay caused by his indecisiveness regarding
the  effect  his  settlement  would  have  on  the  mortgage  he  was  attempting  to  secure,
Applicant made a payment arrangement to pay off this debt  in July 2022. He complied
with  this  payment  arrangement  by  paying  a  down  payment  of  $2,999,  five  monthly
payments of $2,000, and a $4,000 payment in January 2023. He provided an undated
document reflecting that he settled this account for less than the full balance. (Tr. 17-19,
27-46; Answer; GE 2-4; AE A, B)
The delinquent credit card in the amount of $15,302 listed in SOR ¶ 1.b has been
resolved.  Applicant  opened  this  personal  credit-card  account  in  April  2016  to  pay  for
employment expenses related to travel for the employer for whom he worked until April
2017. He became delinquent on the account in about June 2018. He claimed that he fell
behind on this account because he had a dispute with his employer over the expenses
they  should  cover.  He  also  claimed  that  the  creditor  took  away  his  access  to  the
account  and  its  information  on  an  unspecified  date,  which  made  it  difficult  for  him  to
resolve  his  dispute  with  his  former  employer.  He  provided  no  documentation  to
corroborate or substantiate the nature or validity of his dispute with his employer or his
efforts to resolve it. He did not provide documentation to corroborate his claim that the
creditor  denied  his  access  to  the  account.  He  claimed  he  fell  behind  on  this  account
because of his dispute, because he did not have access to this account, because of the
extra expenses he incurred because one of his children was diagnosed with autism, and
because he was not making nearly as much money in 2018 as he currently does. After
his  account  access  was  allegedly  denied,  on  several  occasions,  he  received  written
communications  from  the  creditor  advising  him  that  his  account  was  delinquent  and
providing  contact  information  to  resolve  it.  In  August  2022,  he  settled  the  account  for
less  than  the  full  balance  by  making  a  lump-sum  payment  of  $1,989.  He  provided  a
document from the creditor dated  August 24, 2022, reflecting the terms of his pending
settlement.  The  February  2023  credit  report  corroborates  that  he  settled  the  account.

Since  about  early  2018,  Applicant  has  earned  at  least  $165,000  to  $200,000
annually in salary. He did not provide information regarding his earnings prior to 2018.
Beginning in December 2020, he earned about $390,000 in annual wages. Applicant’s
wife,  a  Nigerian  citizen,  earns  about  $200,000  in  annual  wages.  She  and  Applicant’s
children lived in Country A, so they do not combine their income. Instead, they pay their
expenses  separately.  Applicant,  his  spouse,  and  his  children  now  live  together  in  the
United States. Applicant has approximately $50,000 to $100,000 in a savings account.
He  has  several  hundred  thousand  dollars  invested  in  stocks.  He  has  about  $100,000
invested  in  a  retirement  account.  In  about  May  2016,  he  purchased  a  home  for  over
$400,000. His monthly mortgage is about $3,300. In 2015, he financed the purchase of
a  vehicle  for  $72,000.  His  monthly  payments  on  this  vehicle  were  over  $900  until  he
satisfied the car note in about July 2021. (Tr. 21-27, 63-65, 69-71)
While  Applicant  was  delinquent  on  at  least  one  of  the  SOR  accounts,  he  took
numerous  trips  involving  international  flights  that  were  not  related  to  work.  Some  of
these trips were vacations. Some were trips to visit his family in Country A. Some were
to  visit  his  family  in  Country  B.  Applicant  claimed  that  his  wife  paid  for  some  of  these
trips with her own income, but he did not specify which trips and he did not provide any
documentation  to  corroborate  this  claim.  Applicant  acknowledged  that  several  of  the
trips  he  made  that  he  paid  for  while  the  SOR  accounts  were  delinquent  cost  at  least
$1,000 each. (Tr. 55-59; GE 1, 2)
In addition to not earning as much money as he later did, having disputes about
both SOR delinquencies, and having a child diagnosed with autism, Applicant claimed
he  did  not  settle  his  debts  until  after  the  SOR  was  issued  because  he  had  to  pay  for
other expenses for his family. For example, he claimed that he had to pay for a live-in
nanny in Country A, and he had to pay for his family and him to make trips to visit one
another. He also claimed that he has always had enough money to  pay his debts, but
he did not prioritize the SOR debts  until the time he satisfied them.  He denied that he
settled the SOR debts because his position of public trust was in jeopardy and claimed
that it was merely a coincidence that he settled the accounts after he received the SOR.
