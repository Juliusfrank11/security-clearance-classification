Applicant admitted 14 of the 16 allegations in the SOR and offered explanations.
Her admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. (Item 1) After a thorough and
careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of
fact.
Applicant is 37 years old and has been married since 2013. She and her husband
have two children. She earned a bachelor’s degree in 2010. She is currently enrolled in
an  on-line  university.  (Item  2)  In  March  2022,  she  started  a  position  with  her  current
employer, a defense contractor, and she submitted her first security clearance application
(SCA). (Item 2)
In  her  SCA,  Applicant  reported  short  intervals  of  unemployment  since  2014,
including up to the time she started her current position. She disclosed financial difficulties
that resulted from low paying positions, medical expenses for her two children, and times
when her husband was the sole provider for the family because she chose to stay home
with their children. She stated that a couple years prior to obtaining her current position,
she started working with Law Firm M to help her address her student loan debts. She was
unable to continue because she became unemployed and did not have sufficient money
to  make  payments.  She  did  not  submit  any  evidence  indicating  that  she  made  any
payments on her student loans while previously working with Law Firm M. (Item 2 at 48)
Based on Applicant’s admissions and credit bureau reports (CBR) from June 2022,
November  2021,  and  September  2020,  the  SOR  alleged  16  delinquent  debts,  which
totaled  about  $143,817.  They  included  eight  charged-off  student  loans,  which  totaled
about $136,317. There are six medical debts and two consumer debts, which total about
$7,500. The loans and debts became delinquent between 2015 and 2021. (Items 3, 4,
and 5) The status of these allegations is as follows:
SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.h: Applicant took out these student loans between 2005 and
2008. They are being reported as charged off in Applicant’s credit reports. The last activity
date for the loans is noted as 2015. With her September 2022 Answer, she included a
copy of a contract she signed in September 2022, with Law Firm M to address her student
loans. The contract required her to begin monthly payments on October 25, 2022. The
initial payment was $750, and all subsequent payments  were to be $1,380. (Item 1) In
her  Response  to  the  FORM,  she  included  a  new  contract  with  Law  Firm  K,  dated
November 22, 2022. Her monthly payments were to start on  November 25, 2022, and
continue  thereafter.  The  amounts  were  the  same  as  listed  in  her  September  2022
contract. According to the payment plan, her student loan balance was $136,322. (Ex. B)
The student loans remain unresolved.
In  March  2020,  as  a  result  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  the  Department  of
Education (ED) placed all federal student loans in forbearance and has since extended
the student loan payment pause through  June 2023. The pause includes the following
relief measures for eligible loans: a suspension of loan payments; a 0% interest rate; and

company  that  were  incurred  in  2020.  The  amounts  owed  are  $2,860,  $1,268,  $1,009,

paid in May 2021. (Item 1) It is resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.o alleged a $222 debt owed to a creditor for medical services. Applicant

Applicant submitted two monthly budgets she established with Law Firm M. One
was drafted in September 2022 and the second one was drafted in November 2022. Her
September 2022 budget reported her net monthly income as $8,518 and included rental
income. It listed numerous expenses that totaled $5,661, leaving $2,857 remaining at the
end of the month. Some of those expenses were a mortgage payment, a car payment,
various insurance payments, transportation costs, a $150 payment to the IRS, payments
on four credit cards, and a $1,400 payment on her student loans per her contract with the
Law Firm M. (Item 1)
Applicant’s  November  2022  budget  reported  her  net  monthly  income  as $2,735
and did not list any rental income. Her expenses totaled $979. They included gasoline,
internet, groceries, and a few other items mentioned in her September 2022 budget, but
not all of the expenses included in the September 2022 budget. It did not list payments
on  credit  cards,  a  car  loan,  any  payment  to  the  IRS,  more  than  one  utility,  and  no
insurance payments or medical expenses. Instead of a $1,794 mortgage payment, this
budget listed a $500 rental payment. Her $1,400 student loan payment was not included
in this budget. The monthly remainder was $1,756. (Ex. B at 13) Applicant did not provide
an explanation for the large discrepancies between the two budgets.
Applicant  acknowledged  that  she  has  made  financial  mistakes  by  ignoring  her
financial responsibilities, which resulted in her debts becoming delinquent. She said she
takes responsibility for them. (Item 2 at 58)
