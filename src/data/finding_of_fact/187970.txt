Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.k  with  explanation.  His  admissions  are
incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is 34 years old and married. In 2013, he enrolled in a technical program
and  earned  his  associate’s  degree  in  2015.  Unable  to  find  employment  in  his  field  of
expertise,  he  worked  a  variety  of  jobs  including  as  a  baggage  handler,  a  car  service
agent and a security guard. By 2019, he was not making enough money to pay all of his
bills. That same year, he experienced a brief period of unemployment when he cared for
his  sick  father.  In  2020,  Applicant  started  working  with  his  current  employer  in  a
technical field related to his degree. (Items 3, 6)
Applicant did not list any delinquent debts in his October 2020 SCA. However, he
voluntarily disclosed his delinquent debts in detail during his January 2021 background
interview. (Items 3, 6)
SOR  ¶¶  1.a  ($9,238), 1.b  ($5,741),  1.c  ($4,989),  1.d  ($3,997),  1.e  ($3,950),  1.f
($3,487), 1.h ($951) and 1.i ($877) are all past-due federal student loans with the U.S.
Department  of  Education  (DOE)  that  Applicant  opened  in  2013  and  2014.  The  debts
total  about  $33,000.  During  his  interview,  Applicant  stated  he  had  not  made  any
payments  on  the  loans  since  2015  or  taken  any  subsequent  steps  to  repay  the  debt.
However, he intended on setting up a payment plan as soon as possible. (Items 4-6)
In his March 2022 Response to DOHA’s Interrogatories, Applicant stated he was
in the process of making payment arrangements on the student loans. He submitted a
copy of a  March  2022 DOE  Loan  Rehabilitation application. There is  no evidence  that
the application was approved or that he submitted any payments in compliance with it.
An April 2022 credit report reflects that the loans are in collection status with the DOE
as the creditor. (Items 4, 5)
In  his Answer, Applicant  admitted all of the  delinquent student  loans.  He  stated
he  was  scheduling  a  payment  plan  and  included  a  copy  of  his  March  2022  Loan
Rehabilitation application. He did not include any evidence of payments. (Item 2)
As  of  this  writing,  the   repayment  of  several  federal  student   loans  are   in
forbearance   status   due   to   the   COVID-19   pandemic  under  multiple   Presidential
Executive   Orders   since   March  2020.  Federal  student  loan   payments  remain  paused
until  at   least   June   30,   2023.  See   (https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-
19).
SOR  ¶  1.g  ($1,453)  is  a  charged-off  credit  card  account.  During  his  interview,
Applicant  disclosed  that  this  account  became  late  in  2019  and  that  he  intended  to
satisfy  it.  In  his  March  2022  Response  to  DOHA’s  Interrogatories,  he  stated  that  “full
payments have been made” and that a payment confirmation was attached. In support,
he produced two documents confirming the settlement of a debt not alleged in the SOR.
In his Answer, Applicant included one of these documents  and again claimed the debt
had  been  paid.  However,  neither  the  account  name,  number  or  other  identifiable
information  from  the  document  can  be  associated  with  this  SOR  debt.  The  debt  is
reflected as charged off in Applicant’s April 2022 credit report. (Items 2, 4-6)
SOR  ¶  1.j  ($86)  is  a  medical  debt  that  was  placed  for  collection.  Applicant
admitted the debt and stated he would resolve it as soon as possible. However, there is
no evidence of a payment or other resolution of this debt in the record. (Items 2, 4-6)
SOR ¶ 1.k ($44,756) is a joint mortgage account that is past due with a total loan
balance of $378,803. Applicant’s April 2022 credit report reflects that the mortgage was
opened in May 2017 with a date of last activity of May 2020. Applicant admitted the debt
and stated he was a “co-signer to the house.” He did not elaborate on when or why the
loan  became  past  due.  He  did  not  present  any  plan  to  bring  the  mortgage  current  or
state whether he intended on refinancing or selling the house. (Items 2, 4-6)
Applicant’s  March  2022  paystub  showed  that  he  earned,  with  overtime,  take-
home pay of $2,999 every two weeks. He did not specify how often he earned overtime.
A Personal Financial Statement shows he maintained a net monthly remainder of about
$700. (Item 5)
