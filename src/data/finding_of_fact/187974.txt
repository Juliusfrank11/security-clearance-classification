In  her  Answer,  Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.c  under  the  financial
considerations  guideline  and  2.a  under  the  drug  involvement  and  substance  misuse
guideline. She neither admitted nor denied SOR ¶ 2.b, and I am construing her silence
as  a  denial  of  that  allegation.  She  is  56  years  old,  married,  and  she  has  an  adult
stepchild.  She  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  1988.  She  was  unemployed  from  June
2014  to  July  2015  and  August  2018  to  May  2021.  She  found  short-term  employment
from May 2021 to November 2021, but then she was unemployed for a third time from
November 2021 to August 2022. Since then, she has worked as an administrator for her
employer.  She  has  never  held  access  to  sensitive  information.  She  has  owned  her
home since 2009. (Items 1-4; FORM Response)
Applicant  failed  to  file  and  pay,  as  required,  her  federal  and  state  income  tax
returns for tax years (TY) 2015 through 2018 and 2021. Since she was unemployed in
2019 and 2020, she was likely not required to file an income tax return and did not owe
taxes  for  those  tax  years.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.b)  She  also  has  delinquent  federal  student
loans  totaling  approximately  $155,777.  (SOR  ¶  1.c)  She  attributes  her  financial  issues
to  her  family’s  ongoing  health  issues  after  her  spouse  suffered  from  a  heart  attack  in
2010, and  she consequently became  the primary  source of  income  for her household.
Her  spouse  suffered  a  second  heart  attack  at  a  date  not  in  the  record,  and  he  was
admitted  into  the  emergency  room  twice  in  December  2022.  In  addition,  she  was
diagnosed  with  a  chronic  medical  condition  in  2017,  which  led  to  her  periods  of
unemployment  and  underemployment,  as  discussed  above.  (Items  1-4;  FORM
Response)
Applicant  stated  in  her June  2022  Questionnaire  for National Security  Positions
(SF  86)  and  in  her  Answer  that  she  met  with  an  Internal  Revenue  Service  agent  to
resolve  her  outstanding  tax issues. Having brought their mortgage  current  in  February
2023, she was working to address her family’s other financial obligations. She intended
to  resolve  her  delinquent  student  loans  when  she  had  the  financial  means  to  do  so.
There is no  further evidence in the record about her student loans,  to include whether
her payments are paused under the COVID-19 relief for federal student loans. There is
also  no  evidence  in  the  record  that  she  received  credit  counseling.  (Items  1-4;  FORM
Response)
Applicant  used  and  purchased
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)  with  varying
frequency from approximately December 2018 until at least July 2022. (SOR ¶ 2.a) As
of  the date  of  the SOR,  she  intended  to  use  THC in  the future.  (SOR  ¶ 2.b) As  noted
above,  she  has  suffered  from  a  chronic  medical  condition  since  approximately  2017.
None of the 13 medications she was previously prescribed provided effective treatment,
so she used THC, at her neurologist’s recommendation, to do so. She used “cannabis
edibles”  approximately  four  to  five  times  weekly  between  2018  and  2022.  She  denied
using THC recreationally. (Items 1-4; FORM Response)
Applicant purchased marijuana in her state, where it is legal under state law, and
she is aware that federal employees and contractors are not permitted to use marijuana.
She  hoped  to  have  access  to  better  medication  through  her  employer’s  health
insurance,  and  she  stated  in  her  Answer,  “As  soon  as  I  am  able  to  get  prescription
medication  to  control  [my  medical  condition],  I  will  not  use  THC.”  After  the  new
medication  prescribed  by  her  neurologist  was  approved  by  her  insurance  in  January
2023, she stated in her FORM Response, “I have been able to begin transitioning from
cannabis to  the  prescription  medication,”  and  she  hoped  to  be  completely transitioned
within two weeks. (Items 1-4; FORM Response)
Applicant’s  supervisor  favorably  rated  her  performance  in  November  2022.  He
attested to her reliability and noted that she was an outstanding employee. In addition,
Applicant’s  program  manager  attested  to  Applicant’s  trustworthiness,  reliability,  and
judgment. (Item 2; FORM Response)
