In  his  Answer,  Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.j  with  explanations.  His
admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant  is  50  years  old.  He  has  been  married  twice.  He  and  his  second  wife
have been married since 1999. He has four adult children and one child, age eight. He
served  in  the  Army  from  1992-1996  and  again  from  1998-2001.  In  both  instances,  he
received an honorable discharge.  He joined the National Guard in 2009  and continues
to  serve  as  an  Army  Reservist.  He  obtained  his  bachelor’s  degree  in  2010.  Applicant
has  been  with  his  sponsoring  employer  since  2018  and  works  as  an  acquisitions
specialist. (Items 3-4)
The SOR allegations concern ten  delinquent debts,  totaling about $30,000.  The
debts are established by Applicant’s credit reports  from August 2021 and August 2022
as well as his admissions. (Items 2, 5-6)
Applicant’s current financial issues began in 2017 when he stopped paying on his
vehicle  loan  (SOR  ¶  1.a),  discussed  below.  He  then  experienced  financial  difficulties
with the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020. His wife, a registered nurse, left
her  employment  because  of  COVID-19  related  work  restrictions.  She  then  cared  for
their one young child at home when the school transitioned to virtual learning. Applicant
described  their  financial  situation  when  he  was  the  sole  income  earner  as  “tight.”  She
did not return to work until December 2022. (Items 2-4)
SOR  ¶  1.a  ($23,682)  is  a  charged-off  vehicle  loan.  Applicant  purchased  the
vehicle  in  2013.  In  2017,  he  received  notification  that  a  state  attorney  general  filed  a
lawsuit  against  the  creditor  for  unfair  loan  practices.  Applicant  was  informed  that  he
might have qualified for compensation under a proposed settlement of that case. Based
on this information, he stopped paying on the loan. In the years that followed, he never
contacted the creditor, and he claimed the creditor never contacted him. He never took
steps  to  confirm  the  applicability  of  the  lawsuit  to  his  loan  or  verify  whether  he  was
entitled to any compensation from the settlement. (Item 2; FORM Response; AX I)
During his background interview in August 2021, Applicant claimed that the loan
had  been  paid in full  and  that he  may have  been  a  victim  of the  creditor’s “false credit
reporting.”  In  January 2023,  after  receiving  the  SOR,  Applicant  contacted  the  creditor.
He  learned  that  he  was  not  included  in  the  2017  settlement  of  the  state  attorney
general’s lawsuit, and that the account had been charged off. Based on this information,
Applicant  made  one  $300  payment  toward  the  account.  He  also  said  he  considered
withdrawing funds from his retirement to pay the balance. (Items 2, 4; AX A)
However,  in  his  FORM  Response,  Applicant  claimed  that  the  loan  had  been
charged  off  and  he  had  title  to  the  vehicle  free  of  any  liens.  He  stated  that  he  was
disputing  the  account  with  the  credit  bureau  and  would  not  be  sending  any  additional
payments  to  the  creditor.  The  debt  is reflected  as  charged  off  in  both  credit  reports  in
the record. (FORM Response; AX G; Items 5-6) The account is not resolved.
SOR ¶¶ 1.b ($1,425) and 1.c ($1,141) are charged-off credit cards. The accounts
were opened in 2019 and became delinquent in late 2021.  In January 2023,  Applicant
enrolled in payment plans for both accounts. He later claimed that the accounts were on
auto-draft and would be paid off in one year. He did not provide any proof of payment.
(Items 2, 5; FORM Response; AX B-C) The accounts are not resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.d ($539) is a charged-off credit card. The account was opened in 2019
and  became  delinquent  in  2021.  In  his  FORM  Response,  Applicant  claimed  that  he
successfully disputed the account and it was removed from his credit report. Applicant
did  not  describe  the  basis  for  the  dispute  and  he  did  not  provide  any  supporting
evidence. The debt is reflected in both credit reports in the record. (Items 2, 5-6; FORM
Response) The account is not resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.e ($264) is a charged-off credit card. The account was opened in 2015
and became delinquent in 2016.  In his FORM Response, Applicant provided evidence
that  the  account  was  paid  in  full  in  2019.  (Items  2,  5-6;  FORM  Response;  AX  H)  The
account is resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.f  ($102)  is  a  medical  debt  that  was  placed  for  collection  by  an
unidentified  medical  creditor.  Applicant  made  multiple  attempts  to  find  and  pay  the
correct creditor to resolve this account. (Items 2, 5-6; FORM Response)
SOR  ¶  1.g  ($1,628)  is a  past-due  credit  card  account.  In  his  FORM  Response,
Applicant stated he recently set up a payment plan with the creditor and was scheduled
to  make  his  first  payment  in  February  2023.  He  provided  a  document  confirming  a
payment  plan  for  a  separate,  past-due  account  with  the  same  creditor  that  was  not
alleged in the SOR. (Item 5; FORM Response; AX F) The account is not resolved.
SOR ¶¶ 1.h ($956) and 1.j ($802) are a past-due credit card accounts. In January
2023,  Applicant  enrolled  in  payment  plans  for  these  debts  and  claimed  the  accounts
were  on  auto-draft and  would be paid off  in one  year.  He did not provide any proof of
payment. (Items 2, 5; FORM Response; AX D-E) The accounts are not resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.i  ($814)  is  a  past-due  credit  card  account.  In  his  FORM  Response,
Applicant claimed that he paid the account in full in February 2023. He did not provide
any supporting evidence. (Items 2, 5; FORM Response) The account is not resolved.
With regard to his current circumstances, Applicant stated that his wife’s return to
work “greatly improved” their finances, but did not further elaborate. He did not submit a
budget and his total income and expenditures are unknown. (Item 2; FORM Response)
Applicant  previously held  a  security  clearance  while  in military service.  In 2010,
he  received  a  SOR  due  to  financial  issues.  It  alleged  he  had  about  $17,000  in
delinquent  debts.  In  2013,  following  credit  counseling  and  his  submission  of  favorable
financial  information,  he  was  granted  a  security  clearance  conditioned  on  financial
monitoring  by  his  Command.  (Item  7)  This  is  not  alleged  in  the  SOR  and  will  not  be
considered by me for disqualification purposes, but I may consider it as it may relate to
any mitigating conditions and in my whole-person assessment.
