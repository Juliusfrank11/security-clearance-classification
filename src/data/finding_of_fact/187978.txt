Applicant  admitted  all of  the SOR  allegations  with  explanations.  His admissions
are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  63  years  old.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  1981  and  a  master’s
degree  in  1997.  He married  in  1983  and  has  an  adult  child.  He  has  lived  in  the  same
house since 1999. He has been steadily employed since 2005, except  in 2013 he was
unemployed from March to May, and in 2015 he was unemployed from June to August.
He received $24,000 in severance pay after losing his job in 2013. He has been employed
by his present employer since August 2015. (Items 3, 4)
Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in November 2015. In
it he disclosed he failed to pay his 2013 federal income taxes due to “temporary financial
hardship  due  to  unemployment.”  He  stated  he  owed  the  IRS  $24,581.  He  said  he
contacted the IRS to make arrangements. He also disclosed he failed to pay  his 2014
state income taxes due to “financial hardship during work layoff” but he paid the debt in
September 2015. (Item 3)
In February 2016, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. He told
the  investigator  about  his  unemployment  in  2015  and  that  he  received  a  severance
package, and he did not have financial difficulties during this period but did have some
when he was unemployed in 2013. (Item 4)
Applicant told the investigator that he also owed federal income taxes for tax years
2012, 2013, and 2014. He was unable to pay them because he was earning less than he
was accustomed to. He said he contacted the IRS in August 2015 to establish a payment
plan. He did not explain if an installment agreement was executed. He said he paid the
IRS $200 a month starting in August 2015 but stopped paying in October 2015 because
he  was  paying  other  bills.  He  intended  to  resume  the  $200  payments.  He  told  the
investigator that he attributed his financial problems to changing jobs and being laid off in
2010. His SCA reflects he was laid off in October 2010 and started a new job in November
2010. He told the investigator he had no intention to fail to pay his taxes in the future.
(Items 3, 4)
The  investigator  also  discussed  with  Applicant  his  delinquent  student  loans.
Applicant explained he had cosigned student loans for his daughter beginning in 2005
and they had been past due since about 2010. He could not pay them because he had a
lower income. He had no idea when they went to collection. He said they were current in
2014  and  the  initial  balance  owed  of  approximately  $80,000  was  reduced  to  $70,000.
SOR  ¶  1.c  alleges  Applicant  is  indebted   to   his  state   higher  education   authority   for  an
account in  collection  in  the  approximate  amount  of  $125,848. In  his  answer to  the  SOR,
Applicant admitted  the  debt  and  stated  “I admit,  and  I am  working  to  negotiate  a  payment
plan.”  No evidence  was provided  to  show he  made  any payments or  has a  plan  to  resolve
this debt.  The  debt is reflected on his April 2021 credit report. (Items 4, 5)
The  SOR  alleges  Applicant  owes  delinquent federal  income  taxes  for  tax  years
2010  through  2018  in  the  amount  of  $47,263  (SOR  ¶  1.a).  In  March  2021,  Applicant
responded to government interrogatories and provided tax transcripts from March 2021
and  an  IRS  installment  agreement  summary  from  January  2021,  which  reflects  the
following:
2010-balance owed $2,320
2011-balance owed $13,450
2012-balance owed $3,001
2015-balance owed $3,179
2016-balance owed $10,188
2017-balance owed $4,249
2018-balance owed $10,873
Applicant only provided page 3 of the IRS installment agreement summary. He did
not  provide  any  evidence  of  an  approved  installment  agreement  with  the  IRS  or  any
payments made. In his March 2022 answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the delinquent
federal income tax debts and  said “I am  working  to  negotiate a repayment plan. In the
meantime, I will make a payment on IRS website of at least $200 every 2 weeks.”. (Items
2, 4)
The  March  2021 tax transcripts show Applicant’s adjusted  gross  income  (AGI) for
the following tax years:
AGI for 2013-$77,327
AGI for 2014-$111,891
AGI for 2015-$128,195
AGI for 2016-$112,122
AGI for 2017-$100,321
AGI for 2018-$118,450
The  tax  transcripts  also  show  that  there  may  have  been  installment  agreements
established over the years, but then they stopped. No explanation was provided, and it
did not appear that monthly payments were being made. (Item 4)
The  SOR alleged  Applicant was indebted  to  his state  for delinquent taxes in  the
amount  of $1,610  (SOR ¶  1.b). A  document from  Applicant’s state  tax authority  reflects
he  owed  state  income for tax years 2015  and  2018  for a  total of $1,610. Applicant made
a  handwritten  notation  on  the  document that  he  mailed  a  payment  of $420. In  Applicant’s
answer to the SOR, he admitted the debt, and said it was paid. He did not provide any
documentary proof of payment. (Item 4)
