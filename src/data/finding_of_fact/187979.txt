Under Guideline  F,  the  SOR alleged  that Applicant owed  $57,000  for 12  delinquent
or past-due  debts (SOR 1.a  –  1.l). In  response, Applicant denied  SOR 1.f  –  1.h, and  1.j –
1.l.  He  admitted   the   remaining   Guideline   F  allegations,  all   without  comment  or
explanation.
Under  Guideline  E,  the  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  deliberately  made  a  false
official  statement  by  answering  “no”  to  questions  about  his  past-due  debts  in  e-QIP
Section 26 (Financial Record – Delinquency Involving Routine Accounts) (SOR 2.a). In
response, he admitted this allegation without comment. However, at hearing, he denied
any intent to make a false statement. (Tr. 10 – 11) Accordingly, his answer to SOR 2.a is
entered as a denial. In addition to the facts established by Applicant’s admissions, I make
the following findings of relevant fact.
Applicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor, where he has worked
since  June  2019.  In  July  1998,  he  enlisted  in  the  U.S.  Marine  Corps.  He  served  until
October 2018, when he retired as a master sergeant. His service included deployments
to combat zones between 2003 and 2012, as well as other overseas assignments. After
leaving active duty, he was unemployed until he was hired by his current employer. Before
he  completed  his military  service,  he  completed  his  studies  for  a  bachelor’s  degree  in
business management. (GX 1; Tr. 6, 32)
Applicant  was  married  from  April  2000  until  divorcing  in  February  2012.  He
remarried in July 2015 but divorced again in December 2018. He and his first wife have
three  minor  children  together.  He  also  has  another  minor  child  from  outside  either
marriage. (GX 1; Tr. 35)
In May 2009, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) to renew
his eligibility for a security clearance in connection with his military duties. The ensuing
background investigation revealed that he owed about $22,000 for 23 delinquent or past-
due  debts.  In  January  2011,  the  Department  of  Defense  Consolidated  Adjudications
Facility (DOD CAF) revoked his clearance; however, Applicant appealed that decision,
explaining that his financial problems arose from circumstances beyond his control. He
also  provided  information  showing  that  he  acted  responsibly  in  the  face  of  those
circumstances by obtaining financial counseling and establishing a debt repayment plan.
In May 2011, his clearance was reinstated with the condition that he continue to meet his
financial obligations and avoid incurring any new delinquent debts. (GX  3; Tr. 20, 36 –
37)
On March 24, 2020, pursuant to Applicant’s most recent application for clearance
in January 2020 (GX 1), government investigators obtained a credit report (GX  4) that
documented all of the debts alleged in the SOR. Applicant had not disclosed any of those
debts as required in Section 26 of his e-QIP. On April 6, 2020, a government investigator
conducted a personal subject interview (PSI) of Applicant that covered, in relevant part,
his  finances.  During  the  interview,  the  investigator  conducted  “routine  financial  related
questioning,” in response to which Applicant volunteered that he had one delinquent debt
that he had paid off. He was then confronted with the information contained in the March
2020  credit  report.  Applicant  has  denied  any  intent  to  falsify  his  omission  of  adverse
financial  information  from  his most  recent  e-QIP  (or in  the  PSI,  for that  matter).  At  his
hearing, he explained in a credible way that he thought the Section 26 question on his
most  recent  e-QIP,  as  well  as  the  investigator’s  questioning,  sought  information  about
debts in addition to those he either had previously disclosed on another SCA he submitted
in 2015 or 2016 (not part of this record), or that he knew were in his credit history and
known to investigators. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 10 – 11, 40 – 48)
As  to  the  specific  allegations  of  debt  in  the  SOR,  the  record  establishes  the
following:
Applicant disputed the amount of the $20,170 debt at SOR 1.a, claiming he owed
only about $7,000. After the PSI in 2020, he negotiated with the creditor and settled the
debt.  Applicant  further  claimed  that  he  even  received  a  $3,000  refund  as  part  of  the
settlement. The debt does not appear on any credit report after March 2020. This debt is
resolved. (Answer; GX 2; GX 4 – 6; Tr. 61 – 64)
A credit report obtained on February 18, 2022, shows that the debt at SOR 1.b is
now being paid as required. It is a line of credit from Applicant’s credit union for which he
did not make payments between February and June 2020. As shown in his post-hearing
submissions, he set up a repayment plan and is making $242 payments each month. His
post-hearing submissions also established that he resolved a separate account with the
same creditor through monthly $89 payments. The debt at SOR 1.b is resolved. (GX 4 –
6; AX G; AX H; Tr. 64 – 65)
Available information about the SOR debts shows that Applicant has not taken any
action to resolve the $10,924 debt at SOR 1.c. He did not provide any information about
this debt. It is not resolved. (Answer; Tr. 65 – 66)
Applicant  had  four  Military Star  credit accounts  while he was in the military that
were delinquent when he retired. (SOR 1.d and SOR 1.i – 1.k) He testified that his retired
pay was garnished at a monthly rate of $700 between September 2020 and April 2022.
He claims those debts have been satisfied and provided credit report information listing
them as paid collection accounts. Notwithstanding that these accounts were paid through
involuntary garnishments, they are nonetheless resolved. (AX A; AX I; Tr. 66 – 67)
As to the debts at SOR 1.e – 1.h and 1.l, Applicant denied those allegations and
claims to have paid off those debts around the time he was applying for a loan to buy his
house in late 2019 and early 2020. He has owned his home and paid the mortgage as
required since February 2020. Only one of those debts (SOR 1.l for $114) appears in any
of the credit reports after March 2020. I conclude that these debts are resolved. (Answer;
GX 1; GX 2; GX 4 – 6)
Applicant has a long history of financial problems manifested by multiple past-due
or delinquent debts. The debts that were the subject of the information presented in GX
3, a 2010 adjudication of his clearance eligibility, arose mainly from the untimely death of
his father. That event resulted in financial hardship because Applicant had to take custody
of his two younger brothers. Thereafter, his mother died, and both of his brothers died.
These events occurred as his first marriage was ending. When he divorced his first wife
in 2012, he incurred a monthly child support obligation of $1,600, which he paid as an
allotment  from  his  active  duty  pay.  In  2012,  he  also  incurred  a  monthly  child  support
obligation of $645 for a child born to a different woman after his first divorce. At the time,
he was a staff sergeant (E-6) and the $2,245 total child support payment equated to about
75 percent of his monthly pay. He also incurred travel expenses to see his children who
lived, at that time, on the opposite coast of the United States from where he was stationed.
(GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 27 – 32, 34 – 35, 48, 80)
In  connection  with
the  2010  clearance  adjudication,  Applicant  obtained
professional debt-resolution assistance and established a debt repayment plan starting
in  September 2010 at $290  a month.  When Applicant  remarried in July 2015, his new
wife’s  income  helped  him  further  improve  his  finances  and  his  money  management
practices. However, he again had difficulty paying his bills when a few months after he
left the Marine Corps, his second marriage ended in divorce, and he was unemployed
from November 2018 until going to work for his current employer in June 2019. He briefly
fell behind in his child support payments and he accrued new unpaid debts. (GX 3; GX 4;
Tr. 36 – 40)
In early 2021, Applicant’s first wife and their children moved in with him. This has
reduced his monthly child support obligation to $645 for his one child from outside his
marriages.  Applicant  brings  home  about  $5,000  each  month  in  regular  pay.  He  also
receives $2,300 in military retired pay and $4,100 in monthly disability benefits from the
Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  (VA).  In  about  June  2022,  he  started  a  trucking  and
delivery  business  under  the  auspices  of  a  state  small  business  program  that  provides
funding and business management resources. Applicant’s business appears to be doing
well as he testified he had a profit of nearly $30,000 in November 2022. To his credit, he
is  not  yet  taking  income  from  the  business,  choosing  instead  to  redirect  his  profits  to
paying company debt and growing his business capabilities. As to his personal finances,
Applicant  has  not  incurred  any  new  past-due  or  delinquent  debts.  He  meets  all  of  his
current  regular  obligations,  and  after  expenses  each  month,  he  has  about  $5,000
remaining, most of which he directs to his business. (Tr. 33, 49 – 60, 69 – 77)
At  hearing,  Department  Counsel  asked  Applicant  about  more  recent  debts
reflected in the February 2022 credit report admitted as GX 6. Applicant explained those
accounts  pertain  to  his  new  business.  For  example,  he  has  several  loans  or  credit
accounts opened to procure vehicles for his business. None of those accounts are listed
as  past  due  or  delinquent.  He  also  presented  information  post-hearing  that  shows  he
recently has paid off an auto loan as required. (AX B; Tr. 69 – 70)
