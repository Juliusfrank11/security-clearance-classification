In Applicant's Answer to the SOR, he admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d, 1.f-1.g, and 1.j. He
denied SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.h-1.i. He admitted SOR ¶ 2.a. His admissions are incorporated
into the findings of fact.
Applicant is 43 years old. He is divorced with four children ranging in ages from 12
to 5. Two of the children are from a prior relationship. Applicant retired honorably from the
Navy in 2018 after 20 years of service.  He first held a security in 1998 while on active
duty.  After  retiring,  he  attended  college  and  worked  for  a  defense  contractor  from
September 2019 until around July 2020. He was out of work for about two months. (Tr. at
24-25.) He found a new position in September 2020 that paid about $10,000 less than his
previous position.  (Tr. at 25.)  He held the position  from  September 2020 until October
2022.  (Tr.  at  25.)  He  left  his  position  for  a  higher  paying  position  with  his  sponsor  in
October 2022. His new salary is approximately $15,000 more than his previous salary.
(Tr. at 25-26.)
Applicant testified he is the subject of two separate court orders. One order is for
$2,000 for his children from a prior relationship. (Tr. at 22 and GE-5 at 7.) The other order
for  $5,040  covers  his  children  from  his  marriage  and  alimony.  (GE-7.)  He  was  not
represented by counsel at his divorce. (Tr. at 74.) His former spouse was awarded half of
his retired pay in their divorce. (Tr. 25-26.) He receives approximately $631 a month in
military  retired  pay  after  withholdings.  (Tr.  at  27.)  He  also  receives  a  $2,500  monthly
veteran disability payment. (Tr. at 27.) He has been working side jobs to add an additional
$2,000 a month to his income. He acknowledged he had about $8,600 in monthly income
and had to pay $7,000 in child support and alimony each month before expenses. (Tr. at
63.) He makes payments on his other debts when he has a little extra money. (Tr. at 53.)
SOR ¶ 1.a: past-due account  charged off in the  amount  of  $22,180.  Applicant
admitted this credit card became delinquent in 2019. The credit card was used by both
him  and  his wife. The  credit card was used  mostly for household items,  but he  admitted
he  used  it to  help another woman  out.  He gave  the  woman  $10,000, but her  check did
not clear which  resulted  in “this debt.”  (Tr. at 36.) When  he  was “hit with  this debt,” he  was
paying  $2,000  in child support. He admitted  he  hadn’t taken  any actions yet on  the debt.
(Tr. at  40  and  GE-8 at 6.) This debt is not  resolved.
SOR ¶  1.b: past-due account referred for collection for $8,521.  Applicant took
out a personal loan in 2016-2017 for $10,000, when he fell behind on his finances. He
testified he tried to pay it back. (Tr.  at 44.) He stopped making payments sometime in
2017. Since 2017 he has not taken any action. (Tr. at 47 and GE-8 at 8.) This debt is not
resolved.
SOR ¶  1.c: past-due account  charged off in the  amount  of  $4,263. Applicant
took out a personal loan in 2016–2017 after he fell behind on his rent. (Tr. at 49.) He could
not recall when he stopped making payments, because “it’s been that long.” (Tr. at 50.)
He acknowledged receiving notices but not taking any action (Tr. at 50 and GE-8 at 7.)
This debt is not resolved.
SOR  ¶   1.d: past-due account  charged   off the   amount   of   $3,195.   Applicant’s
credit card became  delinquent in 2019  after he  became  “overextended  slightly.” (Tr. at
51.) He admitted he had not taken action on this debt since 2019. (Tr. at 51 and GE-8 at
8.) This debt is not resolved.
SOR ¶  1.e:  past-due account  charged  off the  amount  of  $906. Applicant denied
this  account,  testifying  he  had  paid  it  off  in  2019.  He  did  not  have  documentation  to
support his testimony, but Department Counsel noted the account was not on the most
recent credit report, GX8. (Tr. at 52.) I have resolved this debt in Applicant’s favor because
the absence of this debt from his recent credit report, corroborated in part by Applicant’s
testimony that he paid it. This debt is resolved.
SOR  ¶   1.f:  past-due   account   charged  off  the   amount   of   $611.  Applicant
admitted this debt but testified he paid when he got his first job in 2019.  He identified the
specific branch he went to and paid it with a check. (Tr. at 52.) He explained he paid the
smaller debts whenever he had a little bit of extra money. The most recent credit report
shows the same outstanding balance and a last payment date of December 2019. (Tr. at
53 and GE-8 at 7.) This debt is not resolved.
SOR ¶  1.g: past-due account  charged off the  amount  of  $446. Applicant could
not recall what the debt was for. (Tr. at 53 and GE-3 at 2.) This debt is not resolved.
SOR  ¶   1.h:  past-due   cellular  service   account   referred  for   collection   for
$1,090. Applicant offered nothing to support his denial. (GE-4 at 6 and GE-5 at 6.) This
debt is not resolved.
SOR ¶  1.i: past-due account  referred fo
r collection for $632.  Applicant denied
this allegation; however, it is supported by the Government’s information.  Applicant did
not offer any information to refute or mitigate this allegation. (GE-4 at 6 and GE-5 at 6.)
This debt is not resolved.
SOR  ¶   1.j:  wage   garnishment   of   $5,040   for  child  support,  past-due  child
support, spousal support, and past-due spousal  support.  Applicant’s child  support
garnishment  was  triggered  when  his  wage  withholding  stopped  after  he  moved  and
changed  jobs.  He  has  since  coordinated  with  his  employers  to  avoid  payments  being
interrupted. (Tr. at 42-43 and GE-7 at 1.)
SOR ¶  2.a. Applicant admitted  in his Answer  to  being  counseled  in  August 2021
for leaving  overnight  an  unsecured  a  binder containing  a  password  to  a  classified  system.
(GE-6  at 1.) He provided  the  training  certificates he  completed  to mitigate his error. (AE-
A  through  AE-E.)  After  the  incident,  Applicant  stayed  on  with  the  company  for  almost a
year  before leaving  to  take a higher paying  position. (Tr. at  25-26.)
Applicant testified he filed his 2021 taxes and owed $14,000. He could not afford
to  pay  the  tax  bill. (Tr.  at  66.)  He  was  not  aware  of  his  tax  withholding  or  reporting
requirements for the side jobs he held as an independent contractor. He has not contacted
the IRS to establish a payment plan. (Tr. at 69, 74.) He testified he was in a car accident
and his car was severely damaged. He stopped making payments on the auto loan when
he  could  not  afford  the  $2,500  insurance  deductible.  The account  was  charged  off  for
$11,815 in April 2022. (Tr. at 53 and GE-8 at 10.) None of these debts were alleged in
the  SOR.  I  have  considered  the  evidence  of  these  delinquent  debts  for  the  limited
purposes of deciding which adjudicative guidelines are applicable, evaluating evidence
of mitigation, and as part of my whole-person analysis.
