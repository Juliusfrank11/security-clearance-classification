Applicant is 39 years old. He served in the United States Army from May 2008 to
April  2016  and  was  honorably  discharged  as  a  corporal  (E-4).  He  served  in  the  Army
National  Guard  or  Army  Reserve  from  April 2016  until  2020.  He  has  attended  college
since May 2016, earned an associate degree in August 2017, and is pursuing a bachelor’s
degree. He was unemployed from May 2016 to September 2016. He has been employed
as  a  mechanic  for  two  different  contractors  under  the  same  federal  contract  since
September 2016. He reported having a security clearance since 2008. (GE 1-2; AE G; Tr.
11, 17-18, 32, 42-50, 53-56, 77-80, 109-111)
The  SOR  alleges  that Applicant has  six delinquent  debts  totaling approximately
$70,734,  including $64,826  in  child  support arrearages (SOR  ¶¶ 1.a,  1.b and 1.c) and
$5,908 for three other delinquent debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.e and 1.f). Applicant admitted all
SOR allegations with explanation. (SOR Response; Tr. 17-22)
Applicant married in November 2011, separated in July 2018, and at hearing stated
his intent to obtain a formal separation agreement or divorce but had not yet done so. He
has one child, age six (CH4), from the marriage and provides $250-$350 per month in
child support. He has three children from other relationships, ages 19 (CH1), 16 (CH2)
and 9 (CH3). (GE 1-2; Tr. 33-38, 71-73)
Applicant attributes his financial difficulties to the cost of supporting four children,
a reduction in his income when he served in the Army, underemployment, unemployment,
and judges’ decisions not to credit all financial support he had provided his children when
determining past-due child support. He testified that he attended a financial class while in
the Army but said that he has not received financial counselling for the SOR debts. (SOR
Response; GE 2 at 4-5; Tr. 53-54, 61-69, 85-90, 97, 02-108)
The SOR allegations and relevant evidence are summarized below.
SOR ¶  1.a:  child  support arrearages  in the  amount  of  $35,788  (CH3).   Applicant
admitted the allegation, reported a court-ordered garnishment of his pay for current and
past-due child support, and that his income tax refunds were withheld to pay arrears. He
testified that he paid approximately $350 per month in child support following CH3’s birth
in March 2013  for an unspecified period of time, and he submitted a letter from  CH3’s
mother confirming  he  provided  $350  in monthly child  support  until at least March  2014.
He testified  that CH3’s mother went to  court because  she  wanted  more child  support. In
April 2019  a  state  court ordered  monthly child  support payments of $771  including  $642
(current child  support)  and  $128  (past-due  child support). Credit reports submitted  by the
Government,  and   pay records  submitted   by  Applicant  reflect  payments  consistent  with
the   April  2019   court   order.  The   May   2022   credit  report   reflects   a   past-due   balance   of
$32,475,  and   court   records  dated   June   6,   2022,   show a   total  amount   due   of   $33,049.
(SOR Response;  GE  2  at  6-7,  GE  3  at 7,  GE  4  at 2, GE  5  at  4;  AE  B  at 1, AE  F; Tr.  27-
30,  74-84, 102-105)
SOR ¶  1.b: child support arrearages  in the  amount  of  $22,302  (CH1).  Applicant
admitted the allegation, reported a court-ordered garnishment of his pay for current and
past-due child support, and that his income tax refunds were withheld to pay arrears. He
testified  that  after  CH1  was  born  in  October  2003,  he  did  not  have  a  formal  support
agreement with CH1’s mother but paid for necessities and cohabitated with her and CH1
for about two years. He testified that after they separated, CH1’s mother went to court for
child  support  in  approximately  2008,  that  the  judge  calculated  child  support  and
arrearages based upon his earnings at the time, and that the judge did not credit past
child  support  when  calculating  arrearages.  He  said  that  his  income  decreased
significantly in May 2008, when he commenced active duty in the Army, and said that he
listed CH1 as his dependent when in the Army. He submitted evidence a July 2015 court
order requires monthly withholding of $846 for total child support. Credit reports submitted
by  the  Government  and  pay  records  submitted  by  Applicant  reflect  regular  payments
consistent  with  that  court  order.  Applicant’s  obligation  to  pay  current  child  support
terminated in October 2021, because CH1 was emancipated. Since November 2021, the
entire  monthly  withholding  has  been  applied  to  past-due  support  only.  The  May  2022
credit report reflects a past-due balance of $12,771, and court records of June 6, 2022,
show a total amount due of $12,380. (SOR Response; GE 2 at 6-7, GE 3 at 7, GE 4 at 2,
GE 5 at 4; AE A, AE B at 2; Tr. 27-30, 38-41, 60-72, 83-88, 105-109)
SOR ¶  1.c: child support arrearages in the amount of $6,736  (CH2). Applicant
admitted the allegation, reported a court-ordered garnishment of his pay for current and
past-due child support, and that his income tax refunds were withheld to pay arrears. He
testified that he paid for necessities after CH2 was born in July 2006. In July 2007, a court
ordered monthly child support payments of $302, including $274 (current child support)
and $27 (past-due child support). Credit reports submitted by the Government and pay
records submitted by Applicant reflect regular payments consistent with that court order.
The May 2022 credit report reflects a past-due balance of $5,929 and court records dated
June 6, 2022, show a total amount due of $6,199. (SOR Response; GE 2 at 3-4; GE 3 at
3; GE 4 at 2; AE B at 3; Tr. 27-30, 70-74, 88-90, 106-109)
SOR  ¶   1.d:  credit  account   charged  off  for  $998.   Applicant  admitted  the
allegation, and stated that he had paid the debt. Credit records from 2019 and 2020 reflect
the account was opened in June 2014, transferred or sold and assigned for collection in
March 2017, and subsequently charged off.  Applicant reported the debt in his January
2019 SCA and told background investigators that he was in the process of settling the
debt. He testified that he received a settlement letter reflecting the debt was resolved in
about  2020  and  would  provide  documentation  after  the  hearing.  After  the  hearing  he
submitted evidence that he contacted the company identified as collecting the debt in the
March 2019 credit report, and that the company representative was unable to locate an
account  under  his  name  or  social  security  number.  This  debt  is  not  resolved.  (SOR
Response; GE 2 at 3; GE 3 at 4, 7; GE 4 at 2-3; AE E; Tr. 23, 30; 90-92)
SOR  ¶   1.e:  loan  account   charged  off  for  $4,575.   Applicant  admitted  the
allegation,  stating  that  he  had  paid  the  debt.  Credit  records  reflect  the  account  was
opened in March 2016, charged off in November 2017, purchased by another lender with
no balance and nothing past due  in May 2022. Applicant submitted a June 2022 letter
stating that the debt had been settled in full on an unspecified date. This debt is resolved.
(SOR Response; GE 3 at 4, GE 4 at 2-3, GE 5 at 7; AE D; Tr. 92-95, 122-127)
SOR  ¶   1.f:  medical   collection  account   for  $335.   Applicant  admitted  the
allegation and provided documentary evidence that he settled this debt in May 2020. This
debt is resolved. (SOR Response; AE C; Tr. 23, 31, 95-97)
Applicant’s  pay records from  July  2020  through  January 2021  show that  he  earned
$29   per  hour   or  about   $4,694   per   month,   and   that  after  deductions  for  child   support,
insurance  and  taxes, his net  monthly income  was about  $1,770.  He said that  his pay  had
recently  increased   to   about  $32   per  hour,  that  he   received   $1,800   monthly  from   the
Department  of Veterans Affairs (VA) for a  70% disability rating,  and  also  earned  $150-
$600  per month  for mowing  grass and  repairing  small  engines.  He estimated  that his bank
account  balance   was   approximately  $2,600   and   his  retirement  account  balance   was
about $9,000. His monthly expenses  include  rent ($550), auto  loan  payments for a 2016
economy  vehicle   ($406),  utilities,  food   and   other  miscellaneous  expenses.   He  did  not
provide  a  written  monthly budget but said  that  he  had  no  disposable income  after monthly
expenses   and   could   not  afford   to   pay  more   towards   his   child-support  arrearages.   He
estimated  that he  could pay all  past-due  child  support within about  five  years. His May
2022  credit report reflected  an  improved  financial situation, and  the  three  child  support
accounts were  the  only past-due  accounts listed. (SOR Response  at 4-9; GE  5; Tr. 45,
51-54,  83-88, 97-102)
Applicant completed extensive training and many schools while in the  Army. He
was a qualified “wheeled vehicle mechanic,” and deployed to Afghanistan for an extended
period. He earned the Afghanistan Campaign Medal with two campaign stars, three Army
Commendation  Medals,  two  Army  Achievement  Medals and other  military  awards  and
