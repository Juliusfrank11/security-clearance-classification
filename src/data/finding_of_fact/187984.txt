In his answer, Applicant denied all of the SOR allegations with explanation. After
review of the pleadings, testimony, and evidence submitted, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant is 36 years old. He was married in 2007 and has two minor children. He
took college classes from 2008-2010 and 2013-2014, and earned a bachelor’s degree in
2014.  He  has  worked  for  a  defense  contractor  for  about  10  years  and  serves  as  a
construction supervisor. (Tr. 20-22; GE 1)
In 2011, Applicant’s son was born. He reported that within two weeks of his birth,
his son had a life-threatening medical emergency, and was on life-support for a month
and a half. He stated that the child required intensive medical care, and his wife cared for
him full time. He asserted that he was the sole provider for his family and was working as
grounds  maintenance.  He  claimed  that  during  the  2011-2013  time  period,  he  worked
seven days a week, and worked 1000 hours of overtime a year to provide for his family.
When his son was three, he had another serious medical emergency, and required more
medical care. Around that time his daughter was born. His wife provided full-time care for
their son until he was five years old, and was unable to return to full-time work until 2018.
All of these circumstances created a financial hardship for his family. (Tr. 24-28; GE 1)
Applicant took out about $62,000 in student loans to finance his college education.
He reported that after he completed his studies, he had a six-month grace period before
his loan payments were supposed to start. He stated that at the time, it was beyond his
financial  abilities  to  make  student-loans  payments.  He  did  not  formally  apply  for
deferment, and his student loans went into collection status. (Tr. 24-47; GE 2)
Applicant reported that when he started working for a defense contractor in 2013,
he made about $15 an hour as a pipe fitter, and earned small salary increases yearly. He
became  a  salaried  employee  in  2017  and  earned  about  $52,000  yearly.  Applicant
asserted that he has received promotions at work since that time, and now earns about
$71,000. (Tr. 24-47)
Applicant stated that in 2015, his pay was garnished for $53 a month for his student
loan  debt.  He  claimed  that  the  garnishment  only  lasted  a  few  months,  and  then  the
garnishment ended. He reported that in 2019, his financial situation was more stable, and
he  contacted  the  lender  to  rehabilitate  his  student  loans.  He  stated  that  he  started  by
making $5 monthly payments and after nine months of rehabilitation, the loans were no
longer  in  a  default  status.  He  reported  that  in  2020,  he  made  several  $363  loans
payments, before requesting an income-based repayment plan. His payments under the
new plan were $61 monthly. Applicant made those payments through December 2021,
before  his  loans  were  moved  into  the  national  Covid-19  student  loan  forbearance
program.  Applicant  is  scheduled  to  restart  loan  payments  once  the  government
terminates the national forbearance program. (Tr. 24-63; AE A, B, C; GE 1, 2)
The  SOR  (¶¶  1.a-1.j)  alleges  about  $62,000  of  student  loans  in  collection.
Applicant provided documentation showing that these loans were rehabilitated, and are
in a current status. The estimated payoff date is in ten years. (Tr. 24-63; AE A, B, C, D;
GE 3, 4 )
Applicant and his wife had credit counseling shortly after they were married.  His
October 2022 credit report shows that they are current on their debts. Their budget shows
their  finances  are  stable,  and  they  can  afford  their  monthly  expenses.  Their  current
monthly income exceeds their expenses by about $850. (Tr. 24-28; AE D, E)
Applicant submitted four character references which state that he is an exemplary
and hardworking employee, has good character, and is reliable and trustworthy. (AE F,
G, H, I, J)
