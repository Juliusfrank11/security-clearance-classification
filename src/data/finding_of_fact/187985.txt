Applicant is 60 years old. He married in 1989 and divorced in 1997. He has three
adult children. He has owned his home since 2010.  He earned  a  bachelor’s degree  in
1985 from a  military academy, and  a  master’s degree  in  2007. He served in the  U.S.
military  from 1985  until he  honorably retired in  2008. He  worked for  a  DOD contractor
from 2008 to 2010. He was self-employed from 2010 to 2015. He worked as a general
manager for an auto body shop from 2015 to 2019. He worked as a consultant for a DOD
contractor  since  2019.  He  was  first  granted  a  security  clearance  as  a  civilian  in
approximately 1997. (Answer; Tr. at 8-9, 33, 18-20, 22-23, 33-34, 38-39, 46-48; GE 1, 2;
AE G-I, L-M)
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  failed  to  file,  as  required,  his  federal  and  state
income tax returns for tax years (TY) 2015 through 2019, and that they remained unfiled
as of the date of the SOR. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.b) In his Answer, Applicant admitted, in part,
and  denied,  in  part,  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b.  The  SOR  allegations  are  established  by
Applicant’s admissions, his July 2019 security clearance application (SCA), his October
2019  interview  with  a  background  investigator,  and  his  January  2021  and  June  2021
responses to interrogatories. (Answer; GE 1-3)
Applicant attributed his failure to file his TY 2015 through 2019 federal and state
income tax returns to personal and professional difficulties that began in 2015, when his
mother  was  diagnosed  with  cancer  and  his  business  dwindled  due  to  sequestration.
When he worked for the auto body shop, he continued to travel to the state in which his
mother lived so that he could care for her. He found it difficult to manage his workload
and personal responsibilities while also assembling the documentation needed to file his
income  tax  returns--a  process  further  complicated  by  his  rental  properties  and  self-
employment. His tax preparer of five years also went out of business in 2016. He spent
several months dealing with his mother’s  affairs after she lost her battle with cancer  in
2016. (Tr. at 20-25, 33-34, 35-42, 46-53, 59-67, 71-73; GE 1-3)
Applicant initiated  efforts in 2019  to  find  a  new tax preparer, and  he  hired  one  in
approximately October  2020. He acknowledged  that he  should have  started  these  efforts
sooner. His previous tax preparer  untimely  filed  his federal  and  state  income  tax returns
for TY 2015 in  October  2016, before going out  of business. After his current tax preparer
prepared   his  subsequent  tax  income   tax  returns,   he   filed   them.  October 2022   IRS   tax
account transcripts reflect that  he  untimely filed  his  federal income  tax returns  for  TY 2018
and  2019  in  April 2022,  and  for TY  2016,  2017, and  2020  in  October  2022.  At  his request,
he   was granted   an   extension   to   file   his   federal income   tax  return   for TY   2021,   and   he
untimely filed  it  in December 2022.  He untimely filed  his state  income  tax returns for TY
2016  through  2020  in March 2022, and  for TY 2021  in December 2022. (Tr. at 20-25,  33-
37, 40-46, 49-50, 53-58, 65-70, 75-78; AE A-D, P-R)
Tax account transcripts and Applicant’s federal and state income tax returns reflect
that  he  did  not  owe  federal  taxes  and  he  was  due  a  $3,697  refund  from  the  state  tax
authority for TY 2015. He had federal tax overpayments for TY 2016 and 2019. He owed
$1,174; $16,879; $503; and $73,180 in federal taxes for TY 2017, 2018, 2020, and 2021
respectively. He owed $4,452; $3,304; $2,206; $15,918; $20,422; and $18,849 in state
income taxes for TY 2016 through 2021, respectively. Prior to and simultaneous with filing
his relevant income tax returns, Applicant made payments to the IRS and the state tax
authority to address any outstanding taxes. In 2016 and 2017, he paid the U.S. Treasury
$6,072 and $10,000, and he paid the state tax authority $3,317 and $3,000, for TY 2015
and  2016,  respectively.  W-2  wage  and  tax  statements  for  2016  through  2018  reflect
withholdings for his federal and state income taxes. He paid the IRS $20,000 in  2018,
$50,000 in 2020, $47,773 and $68,473 in 2021, and $25,000 in 2022. He also paid the
state tax authority $15,076; $19,176; and $18,849 in 2022. He testified that he resolved
his outstanding federal and state taxes. (Tr. at 20-25, 35-37, 40-46, 49-50, 53-58, 65-70,
73-78; GE 2-3; AE A-D, P-R)
Applicant intends to  timely file his federal and  state  income  tax returns in the  future.
He  understands   the   importance   of  timely  filing   his   income   tax  returns.   Through   the
process  of  filing   his  delinquent  returns,   he   developed   a   system   for  gathering   all   his
required  tax documents  to  provide  them  to  his  accountant  in a  timely manner and  intends
to use  that system going forward.  A credit bureau report from 2021  reflected  that he was
responsibly managing  his finances and  does  not have   any delinquent debts.  As of the
date  of the  hearing,  he  had  not  received  credit counseling. (Tr. at  23-25,  56-63,  66, 70-
71; GE 2, 4-5; AE  E)
Nine  individuals,  all  of  whom  have  called  Applicant  a  friend  for  40  years  since
meeting as classmates at the military academy, attested to Applicant’s trustworthiness,
judgment, and reliability. Several of them stated that they were aware that the passing of
Applicant’s  mother  contributed  to  Applicant’s  failure  to  timely  file  his  federal  and  state
income tax returns, and that Applicant was accountable by self-reporting this information
and  correcting  his  lapse.  They  were  confident  that  Applicant  would  meet  his  financial
obligations in the future. Applicant received a number of certifications and awards. His
employer  recognized  his  critical  contributions  in  2022.  He  is  an  active  member  of  his
community. (Tr. at 19-20, 26-33; AE F, G, I, J, K, N, O)
