Applicant is 52 years old. He was born in Israel on the West Bank, and was not a
citizen of Israel, but was at the time considered a citizen of Jordan. He immigrated to the
United States in 1989 to attend college.  In 1997, he married his ex-wife  in Israel, they
separated in 2015, and their divorce was finalized in 2017. She was born in Canada to
American citizens and is a dual citizen of both countries. They have two sons, who are
10 and 11 years old. They were both born in Qatar but are American citizens. In 1996, he
received a Bachelor of Science in electrical engineering from a U.S. university. This is his
first  application  for  a  security  clearance;  however,  in  2007,  he  underwent  a  National
Agency  Check  with  Inquiries  (NACI).  At  the  time  of  the  hearing,  Applicant  was  not
employed, but he was sponsored by a company who intends to hire him as a translator.
(Tr. 12, 20-21; GE 1-3)
After the  September 11th  attacks,  Applicant and  his  ex-wife  moved  to  Jordan  to  live
with  his family for approximately one  year  due  to  fears of anti-Muslim  retaliation. They
then  moved  to  Qatar for her work. While  living  in Qatar, his wife  was the  primary wage-
earner for their  family.  He  became  a  naturalized  U.S. citizen  in 2003, as a  result of his
marriage   to   his  ex-wife.  Between   2007   and   January  2015,   he  worked   for  defense
contractors  as  a  security escort  and  then  as  a  security  manager  at  an  Air  Force  base,
which required him to  hold a NACI. (Tr. 22-30, 38, 56-57, 68-69, 81; GE  1-4)
According to Applicant’s  divorce paperwork, he and his wife separated in March
2016,  when  he  left  Qatar.  He  testified  that  he  went  to  Jordan  to  receive  financial
assistance  from  his  family.  His  father  gifted  him  a  piece  of  property  in  Jordan  worth
approximately $200,000, which he sold, and used, in part, to pay for his divorce attorneys.
He  then  returned  to  the  United  States  to  start  the  divorce  proceedings.  He  was
unemployed from January 2015 to July 2016. (Tr. 22-30, 38, 56-57, 68-69, 81; GE 1-4)
As noted above, Applicant’s wife is a dual citizen of the United States and Canada,
and  when  she  left  Qatar,  she  filed  for  divorce  in  Canada.  Based  upon  the
recommendations of Applicant’s attorney, he found a job in State A in July 2016, rented
a two-bedroom apartment there, and purchased a vehicle. Between his March 2016 and
July  2016,  he  supported  himself  with  the  money  left  over  from  selling  the  Jordanian
property gifted to him from his father. As stated above, Applicant has been unemployed
since January 2017. In October 2017, he returned to Jordan to reside with his father, who
currently provides him approximately $2,500 a month to pay his expenses. (Tr. 29-37; GE
1-4)
Applicant has not resided in the United States since October 2017. He returned to
the U.S. one time, in 2019, to be interviewed for his security clearance. (He listed on the
2019 SCA his sister’s address in State  B  as his permanent address, but he has never
resided there.) For his SCA he provided his sister’s address in State B as his permanent
address, but he has never resided there. He resided in Jordan with his father from October
2017 to January 2021. He then moved to Israel with his father, where he lived as of the
hearing date. His father has continued to financially support him since 2017. Applicant
does not have a bank account or a credit card,  and when he needs money, his father
gives him cash. (Tr. 38-41; GE 1; GE 3)
In Applicant’s 2019 SCA, he disclosed the following visits to his family in Jordan
during the previous seven years: 3/12-4/12; 6/13; 5/14-6/14; 7/15; 1/16; 3/16; and 6/16.
During  Applicant’s  May  2019  interview,  the  government  investigator  reviewed  his  U.S.
passport (valid from October 2008 to October 2018) and noted the following stamps from
Jordan: 10/09; 6/10; 7/10; 9/10; 11/10; 3/11; 6/11; 7/11; 11/11; 12/11; 6/13; 3/16; 4/16;
5/16; and 10/17. (GE 1; GE 3)
When  Applicant  completed  his  2019  SCA,  he  anticipated  he  would  inherit
$1,000,000 in assets from his father’s estate in Jordan and Israel. At one time his father
owned the only insurance company in Israel and owned an extensive real estate portfolio.
“I know my dad is rich, but my dad is secretive. [H]e likes to help his kids,
but  he  doesn’t mention  what he’s got.  [W]hen I went to Jordan, I realized
he’s richer than what I thought. And when I came to Israel I  … now know
he’s … richer than what I thought in Jordan even.”
At  the  time  of  the  hearing,  Applicant  estimated  he  would  inherit  assets  in  Jordan  and
Israel worth approximately $1.5 million. (Tr. 42-43; GE 3)
When Applicant was born in Israel, he was issued a Jordanian passport. Because
he was born on the West Bank in Israel and he is not Jewish, he cannot be a citizen of
Israel. His Jordanian passport or travel document (he has made inconsistent statements
regarding the document) expired in 2018. His Israel identification card does not have an
expiration  date.  He  cannot  live  in  Israel  without  it,  and  he  must  show  it  with  his  U.S.
passport when he enters and exits Israel. (Tr. 44-46, 72-74; GE 1; GE 3)
Applicant’s  parents,  brother,  and  sisters  reside  in  both  Jordan  and  Israel.  His
parents own land in both countries, and his brother lives in part of their parents’ home in
Israel.  Their homes  in the  two  countries  are approximately one  hour apart.  Two of  his
sisters  reside  in  Jordan  and  Israel.  None  of  his  family  members  work  for  either  the
Jordanian or the Israeli governments. (Tr. 48-54, 72)
At the  hearing, Applicant denied  having  close  ties to  his family residing  in Jordan
and   Israel,  including   his  parents  who   provide   him   complete   financial   support  and   with
whom  he  resides.  However, due  to  living  with  his parents,  he  does speak to  his siblings
when   they   call   his  parents,   and   his  brother  resides  in   the   same   building.   Additionally,
Applicant  provides hourly care to  his father and  is essentially his caretaker.  “I’m  by myself
24/7  except my dad. I’m  helping  my dad. I don’t go  anywhere. I don’t go  out.  I don’t talk
to anybody because  the place is dangerous anyways.” He  testified that  he has  no ties or
affection  to  Jordan  and  Israel  and  his allegiance  is to  the  United  States. (Tr. 55-56, 60-
62, 75)
Applicant has one sister who resides in the United States with her family; however,
she  also  owns  property  in  Israel.  He  has  an  uncle  and  cousins  who  live  in  the  United
States. His sons are U.S. citizens, but he does not know where they are currently residing.
According to Applicant, they could be living in the U.S, Canada, or Australia. He does not
pay his ex-wife child support, and the last time he saw his sons was in 2015. According
to their 2016 divorce paperwork, his children were residing in Canada  at that time. His
only asset in the U.S. is a bank account with a $100 balance. (Tr. 58, 61, 65-68; GE 4)
Jordan
Jordan  is  a  nation  in  the  Middle  East,  and  it  is  governed  by  a  constitutional
monarchy ruled by a king who has ultimate executive and legislative authority. The United
States has a long history of cooperation and friendship with Jordan and appreciates the
leadership role Jordan plays in advancing peace and moderation in the region.
Jordan remains at high risk for terrorism. Local, regional, and transnational groups
and extremists have demonstrated a willingness and capacity to plan and execute attacks
in  Jordan.  The  current  travel  advisory  from  the  U.S.  State  Department  is  Level  3  –
reconsider travel due to COVID-19. The U.S. involvement in Iraq and Syria and the U.S.
government’s  policies  regarding  Israel  led  more  than  80%  of  Jordanians  to  hold  an
unfavorable opinion of the U.S. government, although the anti-Western sentiment did not
extend  to  U.S.  citizens  or  culture  generally.  Significant  human  rights  issues  occur  in
Jordan as well.
Israel
Israel  is  a   nation   in   the   Middle   East,   and   it   is  governed   by   a   multiparty
parliamentary democracy.  Israel and  the  United  States have  historically strong  bilateral
relations and ties, including cooperation  on defense  and security matters. With  that said,
U.S. officials remain concerned about the potential for Israeli espionage.
There is a significant level of terrorism threat directed at or affecting official U.S.
Government interests in Israel. Numerous terrorist attacks or incidents involving foreign
terrorist organizations have occurred over the last several years.
The State Department advises not to travel to Israel due to COVID-19; and it warns
to exercise increased caution due to terrorism and civil unrest. Additionally, all persons
entering  and  departing  Israel,  the  West  Bank,  Gaza  are  subject  to  immigration  and
security screening, which may include search of their personal devices and data.
