After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, the Government’s exhibits,
and Applicant’s Response, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  50  years  old  and  has  been  married  since  June  2009.  He  has  no
children of his own but has two adult stepchildren. He is a high school graduate. Since
November 2018, he has been employed by a defense contractor. (Item 5.)
Under Guideline  F, the  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant:  (1) filed  Chapter 13  Bankruptcy
in December 1993, which was converted  to  Chapter 7  and  discharged  in  January  1997;
(2)  filed  Chapter 7  Bankruptcy in1999, which  was discharged  in March 2000; and  (3) filed
a   Chapter  13   Bankruptcy  in  August  2018,   which   remains   open.   (Item   1.)   Applicant
admitted those  allegations with  the  following  quoted  explanations.
SOR  ¶   1.a.  During  this  time  [January  1997]  I  was  working  in  [a
hospital] where I slipped on wet floor and no sign was indicated floor being
wet. Workers compensation took about 1.5 years to release any payment
to  me  which  I  had  to  hire  an  attorney.  During  this  time  my  bills  were  all
behind and I had no financial support from family and friends. I had surgery
on left knee because of the injury I sustained.
SOR  ¶   1.b.  During  this  time  [March  2000]  I  was  working  at  .  .  .
Correctional Center where a co-worker crushed my hand on a 1500 lb door
because she accidentally pushed wrong button. My right hand was crushed
where I had 9 surgeries, 2 plates and 14 screws within 5 years. Workers
compensation in the beginning was paying me but then payments stopped
for  more  than  10  months.  My  attorney  was  able  to  get  my  payments
reinstated and I was medically retired.
SOR ¶ 1.c. Prior to this time [August 2018], my wife was working 60
hours a week. She started to have a lot of pain to where she could barely
get out of bed. We saw numerous doctors and out-of-pocket expense was
a lot. Multiple dr. visits during the week would average to $500 a week and
that wasn’t including cost for injections, mris or ct scans [and] prescription
cost was extremely high as well. My wife has had 2 surgeries during this
time  frame  and  the  outcome  was  not  great.  She  had  to  quit  her  job  and
apply for disability. We had no other option but to file for Chapter 13 to where
we can still keep what we have and continue to pay on it. (Item 2.)
For about a decade, Applicant worked as a contractor for federal and international
employers. When he returned from some of those deployments, he experienced periods
of unemployment. During a period of unemployment in 2018, he was also caring for his
wife in their home state and for his father, who lived out of state. They both had medical
problems. (Items 5 and 6.)
Applicant began experiencing financial problems not long before 1993, which lead
to his first bankruptcy filing, a Chapter 13 in December of that year.  Even though the plan
was  amended  in  February  1994  not  long  after  it  was  filed,  he  failed  to  make  his  plan
payments. Therefore, it was converted to a Chapter 7 and discharged in January 1997.
But his financial problems persisted, and he filed for Chapter 7 in December 1999 which
was discharged in March 2000. (Items 7 and 8.)
Thereafter, Applicant seemed to be on an even keel financially, but in early 2011
his financial issues resurfaced. His May and December 2015 SCAs identified delinquent
accounts. (Items 3 and 4.) Several other accounts went into default in 2017 and 2018.
(Item  6.)  He  attributed  those  delinquencies  to  his  wife’s  medical  conditions  and  two
surgeries. Her surgical outcomes were “not great.” She had to quit her job and apply for
disability. Applicant dipped into retirement funds to attempt to defray some of the medical
expenses and make up for his wife’s lost income. (Items 2, 5, and 6.)
Notwithstanding Applicant’s efforts, he filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection
in August 2018. His filings showed three motor vehicles, two repossessions, and multiple
credit cards. The filings also showed $27,500 in unsecured debt. He estimated he and
his wife made a total gross monthly income of $5,500 with a net remainder of $950. (Items
6 and 9.)
It has been difficult for Applicant to adhere to his plan payments. In October 2018,
numerous objections were file that caused an Amended Plan to be issued in November
2018. Between January 2019 and June 2022, there were eight motions to dismiss filed
for nonpayment. The plan has been modified on numerous occasions, because he could
not afford to make plan payments. (Item 9.) In July 2022, the monthly plan payment was
set at $1,412. But when he failed to make regular payments, a new monthly payment was
set at $1,507. Department Counsel observed that this amount is significantly beyond the
budgeted $950 monthly net remainder. (Item 9.)  Even though confronting obstacles to
make plan payments, he opened new credit cards and took out a vehicle loan for $15,763.
(Item 11.) In his Personal Subject Interview, he offered that he has not used  any debt
consolidation or credit counselling services. (Item 6.)
Law and Policies
It  is  well  established  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.  As  the
Supreme  Court  has  noted,  “the  clearly  consistent  standard  indicates  that  security
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”  Department of the Navy
v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).
When   evaluating   an   applicant’s   suitability  for   a   security  clearance,   the
administrative judge  must consider the  adjudicative  guidelines. These  guidelines, which
are flexible  rules of law, apply together with  common  sense  and  the  general factors of the
whole-person  concept.  The  administrative  judge  must consider all  available and  reliable
information  about  the  person,  past and  present,  favorable and  unfavorable, in making  a
decision.  The   protection   of   the   national  security  is  the   paramount   consideration.   AG  ¶
2(b)  requires  that   “[a]ny  doubt  concerning   personnel  being   considered   for  national
security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.”
Under Directive ¶  E3.1.14, the  Government must present evidence  to  establish
controverted   facts   alleged   in   the   SOR.   Under  Directive   ¶   E3.1.15,   the   applicant   is
responsible  for presenting  “witnesses and  other evidence  to  rebut,  explain, extenuate, or
mitigate  facts admitted  by applicant or proven  by Department Counsel. . . .” The  applicant
has the  ultimate  burden of persuasion in seeking a  favorable security decision.
