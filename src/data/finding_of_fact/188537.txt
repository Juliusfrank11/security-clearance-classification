In his Answer, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations ¶¶ 1.a-1.d with explanation.
SOR ¶ 1.e is considered denied. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact.
After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the
following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 62 years old. He has never been married and has no children. He has
worked as an engineer for a government contractor since 1997. He earned an associate
degree  in  1985,  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  1997,  and  a  master’s  degree  in  2015.  He  last
obtained a security clearance in about 2008. (Item 3)
The SOR alleges failure to file federal and state income tax returns; a federal tax
debt of $91,000; a state tax debt of $11,000; and a 2014 state tax lien or judgment for
$1,248. The allegations and relevant evidence are summarized below:
SOR ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b allege  failures  to  file federal income  tax returns for tax years
2018-2020, and State  A income tax returns for tax years 2019  and  2020, respectively. In
his 2021  background  interview with  a  government investigator, Applicant  stated  that he
did not have a  good reason  for failing to file his tax returns. He stated that these were on
his  to-do   list,   and   that   moving   a   few  times  and   starting   a   new  job   contributed   to   the
problem. He  claimed  that his 2019  and  2020  tax returns would be  filed  by the  end  of 2021.
In  his Answer, he stated  that he  is working  closely with  his tax preparer to  have  his 2019-
2021  returns submitted  by  the  end  of  October 2022, and  that  his  2018  return was  already
filed. However, he  did  not  provide  any documentation  to  substantiate  his  claims.  (Answer;
Item 5)
SOR  ¶   1.c  is  an  unpaid  federal  tax  debt  for  $91,000.  In  his  Answer,  Applicant
claimed that his IRS debt will be paid in full by the end of 2022. He claimed that he was
making payments on the debt, and that the rest of the payment will come from multiple
year refunds and a real estate sale. However, he did not provide sufficient documentation
to substantiate his claims. (Answer; Items 5, 6)
SOR  ¶   1.d   is  an  unpaid  tax  debt  to  State  A  for  $11,000.  In  his  background
interview, Applicant stated that in late 2019 he learned of this tax debt when he went to
renew his automobile registration. He claimed that he was required to arrange a payment
plan prior to renewal. He admitted that he has not made any payments on the plan. In his
Answer, he claimed that the debt was paid down to $2,700 and that it will be paid in full
by the end of 2022. However, he did not provide sufficient documentation to substantiate
his claims. (Answer; Items 5, 6)
SOR ¶  1.e  is an unpaid judgment for a tax lien from State A for $1,248. Applicant
did not provide any input about this allegation. The court judgment and lien record shows
that  a  tax  lien  was  entered  against  Applicant  on  August  15,  2014.  This  debt  remains
unresolved. (Item 7)
In  his Answer, Applicant  asserted that  his monthly income exceeds  his monthly
obligations.  A  budget  submitted  in  2021  shows  that  he  has  about  $10,000  of  excess
monthly income. He claimed that he does not live lavishly and that he expects to be totally
debt free by mid-2023. He asserted that he is not a risk to national security and could not
be  compromised  through  financial  inducements  or  blackmail  to  reveal  classified
information. (Answer, Item 6)
