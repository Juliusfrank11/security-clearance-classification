In Applicant’s July 2022 SOR response, she admitted all of the debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-
1.k.) and provided some clarification if the specific debt was considered a joint debt, or
an account owned by her ex-husband. The SOR alleges 11 delinquent accounts with a
combined total of $134,323. Her admissions are accepted as findings of fact.
Applicant  is  54  years  old,  and  she  has  been  employed  by  different  federal
contractors since June 2009. She began working for her current employer in September
2018. She is an assistant program manager for a program called Education with Industry.
She  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2002  in government  and  international politics.  She
was married in 1990, separated in 2016, and divorced in May 2021. She has three adult
children. She has recently remarried. Her annual salary is approximately $83,000, and
her husband’s net monthly income is about $3,000. (Tr. 27-28, 59; GE 1; AE A)
Financial Considerations
Applicant testified that beginning in 2015, she and her spouse began to experience
financial  problems.  At  that  time,  her  first  husband  was  unemployed  and  a  severe
alcoholic. When he was employed, his salary was substantially higher than her  annual
income of about $60,000. When he was unemployed, she would have just enough money
to support the family but not enough to pay all their bills. Over time, the bills accumulated,
and  they  soon  were  faced  with  an  overwhelming  amount  of  delinquent  debt.  They
separated   in   2016   and   their   divorce   was   finalized   in   May   2021.   She   does   not
communicate  with  her ex-husband  as their  divorce was contentious. (Tr. 27-31, 35, 60-
61)
SOR ¶  1.a  alleges a  student loan  referred  for collection  in the  amount of $113,181.
Applicant admitted  that about 63%  of this debt belongs to  her,  which  would  amount to
approximately $68,000,  and   the   remainder   belongs  to   her ex-husband.  In   about 2005,
they consolidated  their  student  loans  which, at that  time, totaled  approximately  $87,617.
Since  voluntary payments were  not  being  sent to  the  creditor, the  creditor  garnished  her
wages. She  provided  a  December 2019  pay stub  that  showed  her 2019  wages had  been
involuntarily garnished  in the total amount of about  $5,498  for the  year.  An  April 2020  pay
stub  reflected  her wages were  garnished  in  the  total amount of $3,550 for the  year, for a
combined   total  of  $9,048.  Thereafter  the   garnishment  stopped,  presumably   due   to
President Biden’s  March 2020  order for an  emergency pause  on  the  payment of student
loans.  Under the  CARES  Act,  Federal student loan  payments  remain  paused  until at  least
June   30,  2023.  See   https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19   (Tr.  32-41;
GE 2, GE 7; AE C)
Applicant stated in response to interrogatories dated November 2021, that as soon
as  the  federal  pause  on  student  loans  is  lifted,  she  will  begin  making  payments.  The
outstanding  student  loan  balance  is  $113,181.  She  did  not  provide  supporting
documentation to show that 63% of the student loan debt is her responsibility, or that she
had voluntarily made payments on her delinquent student loans before the CARES Act
was passed. (Tr. 32-41; GE 2, GE 7; AE C)
SOR  ¶¶  1.b,  1.c,  1.d, 1.e,  and  1.f  allege  five collection  accounts  with  the  same
creditor totaling $1,322. Applicant stated in her July 2022 SOR response that a payment
plan was established with this creditor. Monthly payments of $100 would start on July 25,
2022, through August 2023 to pay these accounts in full. On March 9, 2023, she provided
documentation which showed the payment plan is in process with an outstanding balance
of $522. These accounts are being resolved. (SOR response; Tr. 41-42; AE E)
SOR ¶  1.g  alleges a  delinquent account with  a  retail  store  that was charged-off  as
a  bad  debt  in the  amount of $1,947. Applicant  stated  in her July 2022  SOR  response  that
a  payment plan  was established  with  this creditor. Monthly payments of $25  would start
on July 25,  2022  and  continue  until  the  account  was paid  in full.  During  the  hearing  she
stated  she  would submit supporting  documentation  while  the  record was  held  open.  She
timely submitted  information  that showed  the  account payment plan  was not  in effect.  The
payments   had   stopped   in   2022   due   to   incorrect  bank  information.   The   balance   of  the
account is $1,848. Applicant stated  in  an  email  that she  requested  monthly statements
be  sent  to  her so  she  can  start  to  make  payments  again.  She  did  not provide  supporting
documentation. This account has not been  resolved.  (SOR response;  Tr. 42; GE  3; E-
mail dated March 9, 2023)
SOR ¶ 1.h alleges a delinquent account with a credit union that was referred for
collection in the amount of $492. Applicant testified that this was a joint account she had
with her ex-husband. The December 2019 credit bureau report showed that the account
was opened in about 2009 and became delinquent in about 2019. Applicant testified that
she had not taken any action to resolve this account.  On March 9, 2023, she provided
information in her email that the account had been referred to a collection agency that
had  been  unable  to  contact  her  or  her  ex-husband.  She  has  now  provided  updated
addresses  to  the  creditor.  The  account  balance  has  increased  to  $1,295,  due  to  the
accrual  of  interest.  She  requested  an  account  statement  be  sent  to  her  and  her  ex-
husband. No supporting documentation was provided by Applicant. This account has not
been resolved. (GE 3; Tr. 42-43; E-mail dated March 9, 2023)
SOR ¶¶ 1.i and 1.k allege two delinquent accounts with a bank creditor that was
referred for collection in the  total amount of $4,059. Applicant provided documentation
with  her  February  2022  SOR  response  that  she  had  been  making  payments  and  the
combined  total  amount  of  these  accounts  was  approximately  $2,196.  She  also  stated
during the hearing she would submit supporting documentation while the record was held
open. On March 9, 2023, she provided documentation which showed one of the accounts
had been paid, and the outstanding balance for the other account was $941. One account
has been resolved and the second account is being resolved. (Tr. 43; SOR response and
attachments; AE D)
SOR ¶ 1.j alleges a delinquent account with a credit card bank creditor that was
charged-off as a bad debt in the amount of $13,322. Applicant testified that it was a credit
card account that had been opened in her name that was used to buy household supplies
after she and her husband purchased a house. She testified that she would be able to
gather more information about this account and would provide it while the record was held
open. She timely provided information in her email that the creditor bank has merged with
another bank, and that all past unpaid debts with the original bank had been charged-off.
The bank representative advised her to work with a credit counselor to have this account
removed  from  her  credit  bureau  report.  Applicant  failed  to  provide  supporting
documentation.  This  account  has  not  been  resolved.  (Tr.  43-45;  GE  3;  E-mail  dated
March 9, 2023)
Applicant testified that she does not have a formal monthly budget and she has
not sought the assistance of a financial counseling program to resolve her indebtedness.
She completed a personal financial statement (PFS) in November 2021. The PFS showed
that after paying her monthly expenses, she had a net monthly remainder of about $2,700.
The PFS did not reflect any payment to her delinquent creditors. When she was asked
during the hearing why she was not paying on her delinquent accounts, Applicant stated
that she did not make payments on the unpaid accounts because she was waiting for her
divorce to be finalized. (Tr. 45, 53-56, 62; GE 2; AE B)
