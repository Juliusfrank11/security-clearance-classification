Applicant is a 34-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since August 2021. He attended college for a period, but he did not
earn a degree. He is married with two children. (Items 2, 3)
Applicant had periods of unemployment and underemployment while raising two
young  children.  He  was  unable  to  pay  all  of  his  bills,  and  several  debts  became
delinquent. (Items 1-6)
The SOR alleges five delinquent debts with balances totaling about $46,700. The
debts include a  charged-off credit card ($27,543), two defaulted student loans ($1,749
and  $1,144),  a  debt  to  a  collection  company  on  behalf  of  a  bank  ($1,046),  and  a
charged-off  auto  loan  ($15,266).  The  balance  on  the  auto  loan  appears  to  reflect  the
deficiency  owed  on  the  loan  after  the  vehicle  was  repossessed.  The  debts  are
established through Applicant’s admissions and credit reports. (Items 1-6)
The  two  largest  debts  are  to  the  same  credit  union.  The  $27,543  charged-off
credit card was opened in 2018 and became delinquent in 2019 (SOR ¶ 1.a). Applicant
financed  an  auto  loan  of  about  $35,000  in  2018.  The  October  2021  credit  report  lists
that  loan  as  current  with  a  balance  of  $31,432.  It  was  voluntarily  surrendered  shortly
before  or  after  October  2021,  resulting  in  the  deficiency  balance  of  $15,266  (SOR  ¶
1.e). He financed another vehicle in September 2021, with a loan of about $35,000. He
is current on this loan, and it was not alleged in the SOR. (Items 1-6)
Applicant  stated  that  he  was  a  scholarship  athlete  in  college,  and  he  signed
some loan documents without realizing what they were. He did not recall signing for the
two defaulted student loans (SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c), but he acknowledged they were his
responsibility. He thought the $1,046 debt (SOR ¶ 1.d) to a collection company was for
a medical debt, but the original creditor was actually a bank. (Items 1, 3-6)
Before  the  SOR  was  issued,  Applicant  paid,  settled,  or  brought  current  several
debts that were not alleged in the SOR. There is no evidence of any payments toward
the SOR debts. He stated that he intended to pay his debts. He and his wife are doing
much better career wise, and they are more mature. His parents both served more than
20 years in the U.S. military, and Applicant asserted that he would never do anything to
betray his country. (Items 1, 3-6)
