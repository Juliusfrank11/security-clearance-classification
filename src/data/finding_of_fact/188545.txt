Applicant is 62 years old. He married in 1984 and has two adult children. He served
in  the Navy  from  1978 to  1982,  and  in the  Air Force  Reserve  from 1982  to  2010, and
received honorable discharges. He has taken some college classes but has not earned
a degree. He has worked for government contractors since at least 2011. (Item 3)
On  his  2021  SCA,  Applicant  reported  financial  problems  due  to  gambling  from
2007  to  2012.  He  stated  that  his  gambling  resulted  in  maxing  out  his  credit  cards,
depleting his savings, and a mortgage delinquency. (Item 3)
The SOR alleges eight unpaid judgments totaling $89,261 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.c,
1.e, 1.f, 1.i, 1.l, 1.m); delinquent federal taxes for tax years 2010, 2011, 2013, 2014, and
2015, totaling $60,773 (SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.g, 1.n, 1.o, 1.p); two unpaid federal tax liens from
2011, totaling $31,362 (SOR ¶¶1.h, 1.j); failure to file a federal income tax return for tax
year 2012 (SOR ¶ 1.k); a state tax debt for $2,476 (SOR ¶ 1.q); a debt in collection for
$938 (SOR ¶ 1.r); and that Applicant’s unpaid and delinquent debts were caused in part
from excessive gambling (SOR ¶ 1.s). (Items 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
In Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, he admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.j, 1.l-1.p, 1.r, and 1.s.
He denied SOR ¶¶ 1.k and 1.q. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
With respect to SOR ¶ 1.k, Applicant claimed that he filed his federal income tax
return for tax year 2012,and the Government did not provide sufficient documentation to
establish this allegation. For SOR ¶ 1.q he claimed that he had a payment plan to resolve
his state tax debt. He provided a letter from the state tax commission stating that he does
not have any outstanding liabilities for his account. These two tax issues are resolved. He
did not provide documentation for any of the other SOR allegations. (Answer; AE A)
In his Answer, Applicant stated that his financial troubles started in 2008 when his
daughter became pregnant in college. She moved home and he supported her and his
grandson for four years. He did not state how much support she required, why she was
unable to contribute to their household during those years, or in what  specific way this
impacted his finances. He reported that he lost his job in 2010 and used credit cards and
casino earnings to generate income. On his 2017 SCA, he reported gambling as a reason
for his delinquent debts. This SCA also  shows that he left his employment with the Air
Force in May 2010 because he hit his high-year tenure. This departure could not have
been unexpected or unplanned. He started his next job with a government contractor in
September 2011. He claims that he has not been able to pay his creditors because of
garnishments on his income and levies on his bank account. He claims that he is working
with a tax service to set up a payment plan with the IRS. (Answer; Items 3, 10)
In  his  Response  to  the  FORM,  Applicant  admitted  that  he  has  made  poor
decisions, but says that they do not define his character. He asserted that he did not have
any  bills listed  as delinquent on a  recent credit  report  that he obtained,  but  he did  not
submit a copy of that report. The most recent credit report in the record shows that he is
still actively using his credit cards. The report shows that he has 16 revolving accounts,
which have over a $21,000 balance combined. He stated that in the past, he has gambled
to increase his income. He has not had any counseling for gambling, but claims he has
stopped through prayer and church attendance. He did not provide any other evidence
that  supports  this  claim.  He  reports  that  he  has  recently  paid  off  his  first  and  second
mortgages. He asserts that he plans to pay off all of his debt. (AE A; Item 4)
Applicant  submitted  a  character  letter  that  states  that  he  is  a  respectable
employee, is a valuable asset, and is not a threat to national security. (Answer)
