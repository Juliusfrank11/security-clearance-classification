Applicant  admitted  the  sole  allegation  in  the  SOR  that  he  used  marijuana  with
varying  frequency  from  January  2003  to  October  2022.  His  admission  is  incorporated
into  the  findings  of  fact.  (Item  2)  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings
and Items submitted, I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant  is  31  years old.  He  earned  a  General  Education  Development  (GED)
certificate in 2008 and a Certificate of Electrical Technician in 2010. He is divorced and
has two children, ages 12 and 15. He and his girlfriend have lived together since 2020.
In  August  2020,  he  started  a  position  with  his  current  employer, a  defense  contractor.
Previously,  he  worked  from  August  2012  to  August  2020  for  a  different  defense
contractor. In April 2022, he completed his first security clearance application (SCA). In
May 2022, he was granted an interim secret security clearance. (Items 3, 6)
In  June  2022,  a  government  investigator  interviewed  Applicant.  During  that
interview, Applicant disclosed that  he started using marijuana  in 2002 when he was in
eighth grade. He used it with friends and has continued to use it since then. He uses it
every other day or twice a week to help him sleep, relax, or relieve a headache. He said
he did not disclose this information in his SCA  because marijuana is legal in his home
state. When he turned 18 in 2006, he began purchasing marijuana at a dispensary with
the  medical  marijuana  card  he  obtained  for  headaches.  He  also  purchases  it  from
friends. He said marijuana does not affect his personality or judgment. (Item 4)
While  discussing  Applicantâ€™s  history  of  marijuana  use,  the  investigator  informed
him  that  using  marijuana  is  considered  an  illegal  drug  for  purposes  of  a  security
clearance. Applicant told the investigator that he intended to continue using it. (Item 4 at
3)
In  November  2022,  Applicant  completed  interrogatories  regarding  his  history  of
marijuana use. He estimated that he started using it in January 2003 and used it once a
week or more up to October 16, 2022. He stated he did not intend to use it in the future
because having a security clearance  was more important than smoking marijuana. He
did not want to miss an opportunity to obtain a security clearance. (Item 5)
