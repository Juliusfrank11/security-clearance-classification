(Items 3, 11)
The SOR alleges 20 delinquent debts, totaling approximately $70,992 including 10
delinquent student loan accounts totaling $67,464. Applicant admitted the allegations in
SOR ¶¶ 1.a-j and 1.l-1.n, with explanation. He denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.k and
1.o-1.t, with explanation. (Item 2)
In his SCA and January 2018 background interview Applicant attributed some of
his  financial  difficulties  to  unemployment  including  being  illegally  fired  because  of
disability  and medical conditions  that  negatively affect his concentration, memory, and
sometimes caused him to fall asleep. (Item 1 at 17-21, 49-50; Item 11 at 3-4, 6-8).
The evidence concerning debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below.
SOR  ¶   1.a-1.j:  student   loans   placed  for  collection  totaling  approximately
$67,464.  Applicant admitted each allegation noting that “[t]his is for my college education,
most  people  have  school  loans,  and  I  actually  planned  on  going  back  to  finish  my
Bachelor’s. That should suspend this until I finish.” (Item 2 at 2) The student loan accounts
were opened in November 2012 (SOR ¶ 1.a), July 2011 (SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.f), December
2013 (SOR ¶¶ 1.c-1.d), November 2011 (SOR ¶ 1.e), November 2010 (SOR ¶¶ 1.g and
1.i), January 2013 (SOR ¶¶ 1.h and 1.j). The November 2018 credit report lists 10 student
loan accounts as past due for more than 120 days. Applicant’s January 2018 background
interview does not reflect any discussion of his delinquent student loans. (Item 11) The
January 2020 credit report reflects 10 student loan collection accounts totaling $68,715.
(Item 6 at 2) The March 2020 Credit report reflects five student loan collection accounts
totaling $43,460. The February 2022 credit report reflects all student loans alleged in the
SOR as collection accounts totaling $67,464. That credit report also lists April 2018 dates
of last activity, first major delinquencies reported in April 2019, and last payment dates of
May 2020 for all SOR student loan accounts. (Item 4 at 4-7) These debts are not resolved.
SOR ¶  1.k: delinquent  on 2017  judgment  for  $754  with $135  balance. Applicant
denied the allegation, stating that he thought this judgment was paid and that he would
contact the creditor. (Item 2 at 2) A default judgment was entered in the amount of $754
plus  $56  in  costs  in  July  2017.  (Item  8  at  1-2)  An  account  with  the  same  creditor  and
collection company with a high balance of $754 and past due balance of $135 is reflected
in the February 2022 credit report. (Item 4 at 7) This debt is not resolved.
SOR  ¶   1.l:  credit  account   charged  off  for  $544.   Applicant  admitted  the
allegation. He stated that “I have no idea what this is regarding, and it will probably drop
off soon.” (Item 2 at 2) The November 2018, January 2020, and March 2020 credit reports
reflect the account as charged off with a balance of $544. (Item 5 at 2, Item 6 at 1, Item
7 at 7) This debt is not resolved.
SOR  ¶   1.m:  medical   account   delinquent   for  $100.  Applicant  admitted  the
allegation  and  said  that  he  would  “look  into  this  [debt]  to  pay  it  off.”  (Item  2  at  2)  The
January  2020  credit  report  reflects  the  account  as  opened  in  August  2019  and  as  a
collection account with a past due balance of $100. (Item 6 at 2) This debt is not resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.n: collection account   for  $400.  Applicant  admitted   the   allegation  but
said that  he  had  received  a  call  about the  debt and  “paid  it,  several  years ago.”  (Item  2  at
2) The  November 2018  credit report shows this account as placed  for collection  with  a
balance  of $400.  (Item  7  at  8)  This debt  is not  reflected  in  the  January 2020  or later credit
reports.  (Items 4-6) I  have  resolved  this  debt  in Applicant’s favor because  the  absence  of
this debt from  the  three  most recent  credit  reports, corroborate  in  part, Applicant’s  claim
that he  paid it.  This debt is resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.o-1.p:  delinquent medical  accounts   for  $2,244   and $105. Applicant
denied these allegations and said that these debts should have been paid by a grocery
store because  he  “slipped  and  fell  in  their  [store].”  (Item 2 at 2-3) The November 2018
credit report shows theses accounts as placed for collection with balance of $2,244 and
$105, respectively. (Item 7 at 8) These debts are not reflected in the January 2020 or later
credit reports. (Items 4-6) I have resolved these debts in Applicant’s favor because  the
absence  of  these  debts  from  the  three  most  recent  credit  reports,  corroborate  in  part,
Applicant’s claim that the delinquent accounts were paid. These debts are resolved.
SOR  ¶   1.q:  delinquent   on  2017   judgment   for  $1,114.   Applicant  denied  the

SOR ¶  1.t: delinquent  on September  2010 judgment  for $6,373  until  October
2011.   Applicant  denied  the  allegation  stating  that  it  had  been  settled  in  full  in  October
