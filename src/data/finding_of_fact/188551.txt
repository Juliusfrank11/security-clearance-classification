Applicant admitted the sole allegation in the SOR with explanations. Her admission
is incorporated into the findings of fact. (Item 2) After a thorough and careful review of the
pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 39 years old and is a high school graduate. She is unmarried but has
cohabitated with a person periodically since 2008. She has four children, ages 18, 15, 12,
and 9 years old. In June 2022, she started a position with her current employer, a defense
contractor, and she  submitted  a security clearance application  (SCA)  for the first time.
(Item 3)
In her SCA, Applicant reported that prior to this position, she had been unemployed
since  February  2022.  Before  that,  she  worked  for  two  insurance  agencies  from
September 2016 to September 2021. (Item 2)
In September 2022, the Government sent Applicant a set of financial interrogatories
and inquired about a delinquent account owed to a bank in the amount of $22,167 for a
personal loan. According to her July 2022 credit bureau report (CBR), she took out the
loan  in  July  2018  for  $35,000.  It  went  into  collection  in  May  2022  with  a  balance  of
$22,167. (Item 5 at 2)
In response to those interrogatories, Applicant stated that in 2020, her work hours
were decreased, which caused her financial problems. (Item 4) She also included a copy
of her monthly budget that stated her net pay was $2,904, her expenses were $1,674,
and payments on other debts were $1,219, leaving $11 remaining at the end of the month.
She  was  making  payments  on  eight  credit  cards,  which  had  a  combined  balance  of
$22,317, and a $214,000 mortgage. She noted that her partner does contribute to some
expenses. (Item 4 at 9)
Based  on  Applicantâ€™s  admission  and  the  July  2022  CBR,  the  SOR  alleged  the
$22,167 delinquent personal loan.  Applicant acknowledged that she had been unable to
pay  the  debt  because  of  a  lack  of  money  and  stated  that  she  has  not  heard  from  the
creditor since 2020. She claimed the creditor refused to work out a payment plan. She
intends to establish a plan if she obtains a security clearance. (Item 7)
