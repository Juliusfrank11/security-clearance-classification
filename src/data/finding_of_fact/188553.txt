Applicant  admitted  all  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a.~1.f,  and  2.a,  with
explanations.  However, he denied certain aspects of SOR allegations ¶ 1.c, and ¶ 1.e.
After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the
following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  26-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed with the defense contractor, off and on, since May of 2018, when he was an
intern. He has held a security clearance, off and on, since May of 2018. He is single and
has no children. (GX 1 at pages 7, and 25~26.)
Guideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
1.a.   and   1.c.  Applicant  admits   that   he   used   marijuana,   with   varying   frequency,
from  about  January of  2016  until  about  May of 2019.  (TR at  page  26  line  23  to  page  29
line   13,  and   at  page   42   lines   21~25.)    He  also  admits  that  he   used   marijuana   while
granted  access to  classified  information, as an  intern,  from  about  July  through  August  of
2018. (TR at page  31  line  2  to  page  34  line  13, at page  50  lines 1~21, and  at page  52
line 4 to page 53 line  10.)
1.b.   and   1.e.   Applicant  admits
through
intermediaries, on  two occasions during  the  two-year  period  from  May of 2016  to  May of
2018.  He  also  purchased   marijuana   during   the   period   March  of  2018   to   May  of  2019,
after completing  an  SF-86 application  in March of 2018.  (TR at page  31  line  2  to  page
34 line 13, and at page 35 line 10 to page  38 line 8.)
that   he   purchased   marijuana,
1.d.  and   1.f.   Applicant  admits  that   he   used   and   purchased   hallucinogenic
mushrooms  once, in  March of  2018, after  completing  an  SF-86  application  in  March  of
2018.  (TR at page  34 line 14 to page  35 line 9, and at  page  36  lines 9~16.)
Guideline E - Personal Conduct
2.a. In  answer to  “Section  23 –  Illegal Use of Drugs . . .,”  on  his March 2018  SF-
86,  Applicant  failed   to   disclose   his  drug   involvement,  noted   above.  (GX  2   at  pages
36~37.) Although  he  did disclose  his  usage  on  his subsequent July 2019  SF-86,  I find
this  to   be   a   willful   falsification.   (TR  at   page   36   line   17   to   page   38   line   11,  at  page   53
lines 11~20, and  GX  1  at pages 45~47.)
