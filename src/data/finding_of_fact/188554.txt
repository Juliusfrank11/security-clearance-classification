Applicant is 50 years old and has married twice, first in1991 and again in 2018. His
first marriage ended in divorce in 2009. He has four children with his first wife and one
child and a stepchild with his second wife. His second wife, their child, and his stepchild
live in Mexico, and Applicant visits them when he is not working remotely on assignments.
He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2006 and a master’s degree in business administration
in 2009. Applicant has held a security clearance in the past. Most recently, he was granted
a  security  clearance  in  2009.  He  was  badly  injured  in  a  car  accident  in  late  2006  and
became disabled. He was unable to work full time again until 2017, and he collected social
security disability benefits during his period of unemployment. Since about October 2021
he has worked as a technician for his current employer, a DoD contractor. He is seeking
national security eligibility in relation to his employment. (Tr. at 6-7, 15-22, 46-47; GE 1
at Sections 2, 13A, 13B, 17; and AE A at 1.)
Paragraph 1 - Guideline F, Financial Considerations
is
financially  overextended   and
The  Government alleged  in this paragraph  that Applicant is ineligible  for clearance
because   he
therefore  potentially  unreliable,
untrustworthy, or at risk of having  to  engage  in illegal acts  to  generate  funds. The  SOR
identifies  12  past-due  debts  that have  been  charged-off  or placed  for collection, totaling
about $120,000  (SOR ¶¶ 1.a  through  1.l). In his Answer, Applicant admitted  seven  SOR
allegations involving  delinquent student loans (SOR ¶¶ 1.a  through  1.d  and  1.i through
1.k) and  one  credit card debt (SOR ¶ 1.e). He  denied  the  remaining  four allegations (SOR
¶¶   1.f   through   1.h   and   1.l).   The   existence   and   amounts  of   all   of   the   SOR   debts  are
established by credit reports in the record, dated August 23, 2022; September 2, 2021;
February 3, 2021; and January 20, 2023. (GE 3, GE 4, GE 5, and GE 11.)
Applicant’s delinquencies arose during his period of disability. His current job pays
him  a  gross  salary  of  $12,000  per  month,  or  about  $6,000  net.  He  lives  remotely  for
months at a time wherever his job site is located. When he is not working at a jobsite, he
lives in his wife’s home with their child and his stepchild in Mexico. He is paid a per diem
of about $1,500 per month to cover his living expenses when he is working remotely. He
has no mortgage and pays no rent. When he is working out of his employer’s offices in
the  United  States,  he  lives at his brother’s house  during  the  week and  with  his wife  on
weekends. He has about $600 in savings. He is learning how to manage his money. He
claims he is “very wise” with his money and is “consistently” paying off his debts. He is
trying to rebuild his credit score. (Tr. at 21-26; 34-36, 61-63.)
The current status of the debts listed in the SOR is as follows:
1.a  through  1.d  and  1.i  through  1.k.  Federal Student  Loan  Collection Debts
in the  Amounts  of  $23,595, $18,611, $14,441, 14,441, $10,500, $13,312, and $13,31,
respectively.  Applicant testified  that he  is currently paying  these  debts.  He pays $188
per  month   on   all   of  his  student   loans.   I  note   that   Federal  student   loans   have   been   in
forbearance   under  the   COVID-19   moratorium   since   March  2020.   Applicant  has  been
paying  his loans notwithstanding  the  forbearance. (Tr.  at 26-27, 29,  33, 63-68; GE  3  at 8-
9; GE 4 at 2-3; GE 5  at 3, 4, 5, 6; and  GE 11  at 4, 5.)
Applicant  provided  after  the  hearing  detailed  statements  from  one  of  the
Government’s student loan service companies. It appears from these statements that ten
of Applicant’s student loans have been consolidated and are being paid every month from
Applicant’s monthly payments of about $184. The statement marked as AE G also reflects
that Applicant’s monthly payments began February 2022. The statements marked as AE
H reflect that all ten of the loans are Federal Subsidized and Unsubsidized Stafford Loans
and that the payments are solely being applied to interest accruing on the loans. These
documents support Applicant’s claim that all of the student loans alleged in the SOR are
being paid every month with his single payment.  These debts are in the initial stage of
being resolved. (AE G; AE H.)
1.e.  Charged-Off  Credit-Card  Debt in the  Amount  of  $464.  Applicant credibly
testified  that he  paid  this debt, though  he  is uncertain  when  it was  paid.  The  debt  is listed
in the  February 2021  credit report in  the  record, but not in  any of the  more recent  credit
reports.  This debt is resolved. (Tr. at 27, 65; and GE  5 at 4.)
1.f   through 1.h.   Medical   Debts   in   Collection   in  the   Amounts   of $148,   $109,
and $108, respectively.  Applicant testified  that he  mistakenly  denied  these  debts  in  his
Answer. He  acknowledged  that they  are  his debts  and  credibly testified  that  he  has  paid
them. The debts are  listed in  the February 2021 credit report in the record, but not in any
of the more recent credit reports. These debts are resolved. (Tr. at 27-28, 65; and GE 5
at 5.)
1.l.   Auto   Loan   Debt  in  Collection  in  the   Amount   of   $12,259.   Applicant
purchased  a  vehicle  with a  loan  in  2010.  The vehicle  was stolen  in Mexico when he  took
the  car there  in about 2014. His insurance  company declined  coverage  for the  loss  since
the  loss  occurred  outside  the  United  States  and  was not  covered  by  his U.S. insurance
policy.  Applicant has not repaid the  loan  and  believes it  may have  dropped  off  his credit
report due  to  age. He understands that he  still  owes this debt,  but he  does not know how
to  approach  the  creditor or whatever company owns the  debt at this time.  He asserted
that  he   is  “open”   to   paying   off   the   loan   because   he   wants   to   pay   off   every   debt  he   is
“capable” of paying. This debt is not yet resolved, but  Applicant  intends to  pay it when  he
is able to do so. (Tr. at 29,  45, 68-70; and  GE  5 at 7.)
Applicant also admitted at the hearing that he has not yet filed his 2021 Federal
income tax returns. He claimed he lost the paperwork he needed to  file his return. He
plans to file this tax return when he submits his 2022 return. Applicant was questioned at
the hearing about an unpaid personal loan that was referred to collection in the amount
of $3,209. The debt appeared  in the Government’s January 20, 2023  credit report (GE
11). He took out the loan during a period of unemployment in 2021 and then was unable
to repay it. He paid the debt shortly before the hearing. Neither the un-filed tax return nor
the recent paid collection debt is alleged in the SOR. (Tr. at 49-50, 58-60.)
Paragraph 2 - Guideline J, Criminal Conduct
The Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because of his
criminal  conduct,  which  raises  questions  about  his
judgment,  reliability,  and
trustworthiness;  and  about  his  ability  and  willingness  to  comply  with  laws,  rules,  and
regulations.  In  his  Answer  Applicant  admitted  that  he  plead  guilty  to  criminal  charges
during the period 2006 through 2014. The specifics of the charges and guilty pleas are
as follows:
2.a.   Driving  Under  the   Influence   of   Alcohol  (DUI)  in  2006.  Applicant  was
arrested  in 2006  and  charged  with  DUI and  DUI .08% BAC or more. He plead  no  contest
in 2007  to  DUI  0.08%  BAC or  more  and  was  sentenced  to  five  years of  probation  and
fined.   This DUI  charge   arose   out  of  a  bar fight  in   which  Applicant   was  involved   with  a
number of other individuals. He was  intoxicated  at the  time. He drove  away from  the bar
to   flee   the   others  involved   and   had   a   serious  accident.  He   has   experienced   multiple
surgeries  since   that   have   caused   him   to   experience   periods  of   disability  and
unemployment.  Starting  in  2017  he  has  been  healthy enough  to  work full  time.  (Tr. at  22-
23, 37, 51-52; GE 1  at Section 22; GE 8.)
2.b.  False  Imprisonment  and Battery  of  Spouse  in 2010.  Applicant was arrested
in 2010  and  charged  with  False Imprisonment  and  Battery of Spouse. He plead  guilty to
Battery  of  Spouse  and  was sentenced  to  five  days in  jail and  three  years of  probation.  He
was on probation at the time due to his 2006 sentence for DUI  .08% BAC or more, as
noted above. The incident that gave rise to Applicant’s arrest in 2010 came at a time when
his first marriage was ending. His then-wife accused Applicant of picking her up by her
neck and throwing her against the wall. He denied the allegation at his security clearance
hearing stating that he was recovering from back surgery three or four weeks earlier and
could not physically have done what he was accused of doing. He also testified that he
pled guilty to avoid a six-month jail sentence. The reduced sentence “played a major role”
in his decision to plead guilty to the charge of Battery of Spouse.  He conceded that he
lied to the criminal court judge by pleading guilty and admitting the offense, which he now
denies  committing.  He  further explained  that  he  was  experiencing  a  lot  of  pain  from  a
recent surgery and was not “thinking straight” at the time of his guilty plea. (Tr. at 37-39,
52-56, 77-78; GE 1 at Section 22; and GE 6 at 5-6.)
2.c. DUI and DUI within Ten Years of Prior DUI Conviction. In 2014 Applicant
was arrested again for DUI. He pled guilty to DUI within Ten Years of Prior DUI Conviction.
He  was  sentenced  to  five  years  of  probation  and  fined.  This  incident  occurred  after
Applicant lost custody of his children. A consequence of his conviction on that charge was
that Applicant’s  license  was  suspended for a  period. He  has never sought to have  his
license  reinstated.  He  does  not  currently  have  a  driver’s  license.  He  takes  public
transportation instead. (Tr. at 40-42, 56-57; GE 1 at Section 22; and GE 6 at 7; GE 7.)
Mitigation
Applicant is trying to become financially stable and pay his debts that arose during
his disability. He has provided a list of his assets and liabilities. His assets include about
$4,000  of  investments  in  certificates  of  deposits.  His  liabilities  include  a  car  loan  on  a
vehicle he purchased for his wife in Mexico. He also provided evidence of an investment
portfolio with a value of about $3,200. In addition, he provided evidence of a whole-life
insurance policy in the face amount of $100,000 that he purchased in November 2022.
With respect to his unfiled Federal tax return for tax year 2021, he provided an IRS Wage
and Tax Statement for 2021 that provides him with the necessary information to file his
return, though the return will be filed late. (AE C through F.)
