Applicant is 48 years old, married, and has four children and three stepchildren.
Four of the children live with Applicant and their mother. Applicant served in the U.S. Navy
for 20 years and retired honorably in January 2015 as a member of the Submarine Force
as an Auxiliaryman (E-6). He held a security clearance while in the Navy. Since 2018, he
has worked for a U.S. Government contractor as a quality assurance specialist. He has
applied to continue his security clearance in relation to his employment. (Tr. at 24; GE 1
at Section 2, 15, 17, 18, 25.)
Guideline F, Financial Considerations
The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for a security
clearance  because  he  is  financially  overextended  and  therefore  potentially  unreliable,
untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. The SOR
identified  five  past-due  or  charged-off  debts  owed  by  Applicant  totaling  about  $40,000
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.e). In his Answer, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations
and commented that he has paid one of the debts. He also argued that three of the debts
will  be  removed  from  his  credit  report  in  2023  or  2024  and  a  fourth  is  “closed.”  The
existence  and  amounts  of  all  five  debts  is  supported  by  Applicant’s  admissions  in  the
Answer and by credit reports in the record, dated January 11, 2023; October 13, 2021;
and March 12, 2021. (Answer; GE 2, GE 3, GE 4.)
Applicant first started to experience financial problems in about 2015 and the year
or so after his Navy retirement. He was unemployed for a period and in November 2015,
he had a bad motorcycle accident that kept him from working for a period. He then had
more periods of unemployment and underemployment.  He defaulted on all of the SOR
debts  during  the  first  two  years  following  his  retirement.  (Tr.  at  30-31,  49-53:  GE  1  at
Section 13A, 26.)
Applicant testified that he and his wife presently have monthly take-home pay of
about  $9,700.  In  addition,  he  has  monthly  retirement  benefits  from  the  Navy  of  about
$1,500 and VA disability benefits of about $160. Their total net monthly income is over
$11,000. Based upon his off-the-cuff calculations of his monthly expenses, he believes
he has on average about $2,000 left over at the end of every month. He presently has
about $1,000 in savings. At one time, he had about $8,000 in savings, but it has been
reduced recently due to some emergency expenses and because he loaned money to a
family member who lost his job. In light of his savings history, Applicant’s estimated net
monthly  remainder  appears  to  be  based  upon  an  incomplete  listing  of  his  monthly
expenses. (Tr. at 33-46, 59.)
Applicant  never  contributed  to  a  Thrift  Savings  Plan  account  when  he  was  a
servicemember. He does not contribute to his current employer’s retirement account. (Tr.
at 59-60.)
The current status of the debts listed in the SOR is as follows:
1.a. Credit Union Debt Charged-Off in the Amount of $14,638. The creditor that
charged off this credit-card account is the same creditor that charged off the debts listed
in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c. He was able to keep these accounts current until he retired, but
without stable new employment, his savings alone were not enough to pay his debts. The
creditor has transferred these three debts to a collection agency. In the week or so prior
to the hearing, Applicant tried to contact the agency to discuss settlement options, but he
has  not  been  successful  in  reaching  anyone.  He  wants  to  slowly  “chip  away”  at  these
three debts when he is able to do so. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 54-60; GE 3 at 2;
GE 4 at 2.)
1.b. Credit Union Debt Charged-Off in the Amount of $9,173. Applicant took
out this loan to purchase a motorcycle. The motorcycle is the same one that was involved
in an accident in November 2015. It was a total loss. See discussion in SOR ¶ 1.a, above.
This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 60-62; GE 2 at 4; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 3.)
1.c. Credit Union Debt Charged-Off in the Amount of $5,106. This debt is for
an auto loan that Applicant could not afford after his retirement. The car was repossessed.
See discussion in SOR ¶ 1.a, above. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. at 60-61; GE 2 at 4;
GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 3.)
1.d. Personal Loan Account Charged-Off in the Amount of $10,792. Applicant
opened this account when he was on active duty in the Navy. He needed the credit to pay
for travel expenses to see his mother, who had suffered a heart attack. He subsequently
retired and had little income to repay this loan. In November 2015, after his retirement,
he also had medical expenses due to a motorcycle accident. He was unable to work for
an extended period. He also incurred significant medical bills. This debt is not resolved.
(Tr. at 49- 52; GE 3 at 3; GE 4 at 3.)
1.e.  Cellular  Phone Account in  Collection in  the  Amount of $794. Applicant
testified that he paid this account in July 2021, when his finances finally became stable
enough  so  that  he  could  afford  to  pay  this  collection  account.  He  provided  no
documentation to corroborate his claim that the debt is paid. The debt only appears on
the Government’s earliest credit report, dated March 12, 2021 (GE 4). That credit report
reflects the debt has been placed for collection. Based upon the totality of the record, I
find that this debt is resolved. (Tr. at 46-48; GE 4 at 3.)
Mitigation
According to the credit reports in the record, Applicant has paid and closed two
delinquent accounts with debts totaling $2,000, (GE 3 at 3; GE 4 at 4-5). Those debts
were not alleged in the SOR. He has also paid  the debt listed in SOR ¶ 1.e. His debt-
resolution strategy is to pay the smaller debts first, including the debt alleged at SOR 1.e
and the two debts that were not listed in the SOR, and then as his finances permit, start
paying down the larger debts. He testified that the experience of discussing all of his debts
in  a  hearing was a  “sobering”  experience.  He  said  that  he  wants  to  “chip  away” at  his
debts, but he acknowledged that it is difficult to do that with a large family creating a lot
of competing  financial priorities. Applicant’s finances today are much  more stable  than
they were during the 2015-to-2017 period. He has not incurred any delinquent debts since
he defaulted on the last of the five SOR debts in 2015 or 2016. (Tr.at 53-64.)
