Applicant admitted to all the allegations in the SOR with no explanation.  After a
thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  testimony,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  37-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed  with  the defense  contractor since February of  2019.  Applicant  was divorced
from  his  first  wife  in  2012  and  remarried  in  2018.  He  has  two  children  from  his  first
marriage. (TR at page 14 line 6 to page 16 line 9, and GX 1 at pages 7, 12, 19~20 and
26~27.) He attributes much of his admitted past-due debt to his decade old divorce. (TR
at page 20 line 14 to page 23 line 8.)
