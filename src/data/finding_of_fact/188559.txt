Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b through 1.d, and 1.h. He denied
the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.e through 1.g, and 1.i through 1.p. His admissions are
adopted  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,
testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 41 years old. He is a high school graduate, and he has earned some
college credits, but not a degree. He served in the military on active duty from 2010 to
2015 and received an honorable discharge. He married in 2014 and has a five-year-old
child. He also has custody of a 16-year-old child from a previous relationship. Applicant
worked for different federal contractors and non-federal contractors since his discharge
from the military. He disclosed a one-month period of unemployment. He has worked for
his present employer, a federal contractor, since October 2018. (Tr. 14-18; GE 1)
In 2015, as part of his employment with a federal contractor, Applicant worked in
a foreign country. In September 2016, he and his wife purchased a house in the United
States  while  he  was  working  overseas,  and  they  relocated  to  a  different  state.  They
believed  they  could  cover  their  expenses.  When  he  returned  from  his  overseas
employment in February 2017, he experienced a substantial reduction in pay.  His wife
had been working full time, but then lost her teaching job in June 2022. She is seeking
new employment. Applicant is hoping she can find a new job, which will substantially help
resolve some of their financial issues. They have also reduced their spending. Applicant
testified that he attempted to obtain a loan to help pay some debts but was unable. (Tr.
18-24, 50-53,57-58)
The SOR alleges 16 delinquent debts totaling approximately $66,741. The debts
are corroborated by Applicant’s admissions in his answer, admissions during his April and
May 2020 background interview with a government investigator, and credit reports from
April 2020, January 2021, and February 2022. (GE 1-5)
Applicant disputes the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a (past due $642) for a timeshare. Applicant
is  disputing  this  debt  because  the  property  was  sold,  and  he  disagrees  with  the  final
accounting believing the sale satisfied the debt. He  disputed it on his credit report and
provided  a  copy  of  it  showing  his  dispute.  A  report  of  resolution  had  not  yet  been
completed. (Tr. 41-44; AE A)
Applicant also disputes the debt in SOR ¶ 1.p owed for an insurance policy that he
canceled when the insurer raised his premiums. Applicant believed he was entitled to a
prorated bill and was instead charged for the entire premium. He disputed the charge on
his credit report and provided a copy of it showing his dispute. A report of resolution had
not yet been completed. (Tr. 33-34; AE P)
Applicant provided documentary evidence to show the debts in SOR  ¶¶ 1.b, 1.e
through 1.g, and 1.i - 1.o are paid, settled, or resolved. Some were resolved in 2021 and
others in early 2022. Applicant has a payment plan for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.h ($2,880) to
make $100 monthly payments until the debt is resolved. He began making payments in
2022. His documents reflect the amount to be paid in settlement is $2,380.  He testified
that SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.h are duplicate debts. Both are resolved in his favor.  (Tr. 25-35,
40, 44-49; AE B, E-P)
The charged-off debt in SOR ¶ 1.c ($36,165) is for a car loan and the debt in ¶ 1.d
($5,957) is a credit card debt. Applicant explained that the car stopped working and he
fell  behind  on  the  payments.  He  got  behind on  the  credit  card  when  he  returned  from
overseas and could not keep up with the payments. He contacted the original creditor in
SOR ¶ 1.c and attempted to pay a $5,000 lump sum he had received as a bonus to them,
but  the  creditor  would  not  accept  the  payment.  The  creditor  advised  him  it  would  only
accept  a  lump-sum  payment  for  the  entire  amount  to  resolve  the  debt.  Applicant  was
unable to pay the full amount. (Tr. 36-39, 44; AE R)
Applicant testified he had a payment plan with the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.d. However,
in his post-hearing submission, he indicated that he was unable to pay the amount owed
on the debt and could not make payment arrangements at the time. He recently contacted
the  collection  companies  for  both  SOR  ¶¶  1.c  and  1.d  and  they  offered  to  establish
payment agreements, but he had to pay a percentage of the total owed before a payment
plan would be established. Applicant has been paying other debts and is unable to make
the percentage payments currently. He intends to continue resolving other debts and then
when  they  are  paid,  he  will  contact  the  collectors  for  these  accounts  and  establish
payment plans to resolve them. (Tr. 40-45; AE R)
Applicant participated in financial counseling in 2021. He has not opened any new
accounts and has no new delinquent accounts. He has a written budget that he follows.
He is committed to paying the remaining delinquent debts. (Tr. 56-57)
Applicant’s mother and sister testified on his behalf. They described Applicant as
responsible, dependable, and a dedicated father, son and brother. He is a person devoted
to his faith, honest, loyal, reliable and a leader. They have witnessed the values he has
instilled in his children. (Tr. 61-71)
