Applicant is a 50-year-old vice president, part owner, and facility security officer
(FSO) of a defense contractor, where he has worked since 1999. He seeks to retain a
security clearance, which he has held since about 2002. He has two associate degrees
that  he  earned  in  1994  and  additional  education.  He  married  in  2013  and  divorced  in
2019. He has two children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 15-19, 53, 67-68; Applicant’s response to
SOR; GE 1, 2; AE F)
Applicant went through an extraordinarily difficult time  starting in about 2014. In
late  2014,  his  mother  had  a  brain  aneurism  and  became  severely  mentally  and
physically  incapacitated.  After  his  mother  was  released  from  the  hospital  and
rehabilitation, he took her in to live with him and his family. She lived with Applicant until
sometime  in  about  2016.  After  she  stopped  living  with  him,  he  visited  her  often  and
continued  to  deal  with  her  condition  until  she  passed  away  in  2021.  His  two  young
children made it more difficult. In 2017, Applicant suspected his wife was unfaithful. He
hired  a  private  investigator  who  confirmed  his  suspicions.  (Tr.  at  21-25,  35-42,  54-58,

Applicant is part owner of his company, which was a Subchapter S corporation.
His interest was about 21.5% in 2016. In order to be competitive on a large contract, the
company needed to bring in experienced workers. The company used partial ownership
as a recruitment tool. As part of that process, in 2017, the company was converted to a
limited liability company (LLC). Applicant’s ownership was involuntarily diluted to about
6.5%, but he received $3 million as compensation for his share of the company. He felt
that he did not receive a fair deal. The $3 million was to be paid in quarterly installments
over several years, but the tax liability  for the capital gains was completely in tax year
2017. He received payments of about $900,000 in 2017, and the rest in later years. The
company  won  a  $900  million  contract.  (Tr.  at  26-35,  58-62,  66,  72-73;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE D, E)
Applicant  has  a   history   of  tax  issues.   He  did  not  file   his  2016   through   2019
federal and  state  income  tax returns when  they were  due, and  he  failed  to  pay his 2016
through  2018  federal and  state  income  taxes when  they were  due.  The  forms  from  his
company  that were  necessary to  file  his  returns were  always  late, but not  to  the  extent
that it justified  how late  his returns were. He had  the  means to  pay the  taxes when  they
were  due,  even  in  2017  when  the  large  capital gains tax was  due.  He does not  excuse
his failures,  but the  stress of dealing  with  his  mother, his now ex-wife, his children,  and
the  issues with  his company,  distracted  him  from  resolving  his tax problems.  (Tr. at 42-

the interest by $163 and indicated that Applicant was due a refund of $13,269. (GE 2;
AE M, N, DD)

State Taxes
Applicant filed his state tax returns at the same time he filed his federal returns.
He  owed  about  $5,188  for  2016;  $173,000  for  $2017;  and  $3,725  for  2017.  Those
figures  did  not  include  all  of  the  penalties  and  interest.  The  taxes  were  paid  between
November  2019  and  January  2020.  His  state  waived  much  of  the  penalties.  He
significantly  overpaid  his  2019  and  2020  state  taxes  resulting  in  large  refunds.  He
donated $13,000 from what would have been penalties to charity. (AE G, I, K, M, O, P,
U, GG)
Applicant reported his failure to file his federal and state tax returns from 2016 to
2018  on  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  that  he  submitted  in
April  2020.  He  wrote  that  the  issues  were  satisfied  in  December  2019,  with  the
comments,  “The  taxes  and  all  associated  interest  were  paid  in  full  with  two  payments
(one for tax and one once interest was calculated). I have written an abatement request
letter to request relief from penalties which is pending.” I misstated the evidence during
the  hearing  and  made  inaccurate  comments  about  Applicant’s  answers.  I  find  that
Applicant’s responses on the SF 86 were correct, as the taxes and interest were paid,
while the penalties, which were extensive, were paid later. (Tr. at 80-86; GE 1)
Applicant  was  interviewed  for  his  background  investigation  in  August  2020.  He
discussed his 2016 through 2018 federal and state taxes. He stated that he filed all of
the returns in November 2019 and made all payments in full, as required. He stated that
he had no issues with his 2019 tax filings. (GE 2) As indicated above, after submitting
his  SF  86  and  completing  his background  interview,  Applicant  was  late  filing  his 2019
federal and state income tax returns and paying the taxes owed.
Applicant admitted that as the FSO, he knew that he was  required to report his
tax issues to the DOD. He did not do so before the SF 86. He stated that if he became
aware that an employee had similar tax issues, he would report the employee.1  (Tr. at
89-90)
1  The SOR did not allege that Applicant failed to report his tax issues. Any matter that was not alleged in
the  SOR  cannot  be  used  for  disqualification  purposes.  It  may  be  considered  in  assessing  Applicant’s
credibility, in the application of mitigating conditions, and in the whole-person analysis.
Applicant  received marriage  counseling,  which  has  helped  him  in  other aspects
of his life. He has better tools and coping mechanisms to deal with emotional stress. He
has  systems  and  reminders  in  place  with  his  accountant  to  prevent  any  additional  tax
issues. He stated that he will continue to file his tax returns and pay his taxes on time.

Applicant called witnesses, and he submitted documents and letters attesting to
his  excellent  job  performance  and  strong  moral  character.  He  is  praised  for  his
trustworthiness,  reliability,  professionalism,  and  willingness  and  ability  to  protect
classified information. (Tr. at 92-116; AE T, W-Y)
