The  SOR  identified  twelve  delinquent  student  loan  debts  totaling  $71,150.
Applicant admitted each of the allegations set forth under this guideline.  A credit report
of the Applicant dated January 29, 2021, confirms the indebtedness listed in the SOR.
(Government Exhibit 2.)
Applicant  attended  college  from  2005  to  2009.  To  pay  for  his  education,  he
obtained student loans totaling about $60,000.  He graduated from college in 2009, and
joined the U.S. Air force.  He served in the Air Force from November 2009 to  January
2019.  While in the Air Force, Applicant was deployed overseas for about eight years,
and his student loans were deferred for about six or seven of those deployment years.
(Tr. p. 21.)  He achieved the rank of Staff Sergeant, E-5, and an honorable discharge.
Applicant  has  been  employed  with  a  U.S.  defense  contractor  since  January
2019,  and  he  currently  resides  in  Japan.  He  testified  that  he  first  learned  that  his
student loans were in default sometime in 2015/2016.  (Tr. p. 42.)  At that time, he did
nothing to address the loans.  He stated that it was not until he received the SOR in July
2021,  that he knew who  to  contact  about his  student loan  debt and  took  some  action.
A letter from the Applicant indicates that he has reached out to these creditors and set
up  a payment  plan to get  the  loans  out  of their delinquent  status.  (Applicant’s  Exhibit
A.)  He  testified  that  in  November  2021,  he  received  correspondence  from  the
Government about his student loans,  listing a contact  telephone number,  advising him
on how to rehabilitate his loan status, and how to apply for Federal Student Loan Debt
Relief.  Applicant testified that he has not yet had the chance to call them.  (Tr. p. 29.)
Applicant  stated  that  his  student  loans  were  sold  and  were  split  between  two
different  creditors.  At  some  point,  he  thought  that  he  owed  Creditor  A  a  total  of
$52,262;  and  Creditor  B  $18,863.  Concerning  Creditor  A,  Applicant  stated  that  he  is
currently going through the process of loan rehabilitation.  To pull his loan out of default
status,  he  must  make  the  required  payments  for  several  months  to  complete  the
rehabilitation  process before he  is allowed  to  start  a payment plan.  He stated that he
has paid $150 monthly for five months so far while in rehabilitation.  Once he completes
the  rehabilitation  process,  he  will  be  permitted  to  set  up  a  payment  plan  with  the
creditor,  to  begin  to  resolve  the  debt.  He  stated  that  he  plans  to  begin  his  regular
monthly payments plan in January 2023.  (Tr. p. 36.)  Concerning Creditor B, Applicant
stated that he is required to pay $250 monthly through the rehabilitation process before
he can start their payment program.  (Applicant’s Post-Hearing Exhibits B and C.)
Applicant  testified  that  his  wife  is  pregnant  with  their  second  child.  She  earns
about $25,000 annually.  Applicant earns about $67,000 annually.  He has $2,800 in his
checking  account,  and  $15,000  in  his  savings  account.  (Tr.  p.  47.)  He  believes  that
even with the new baby and the related expenses, he can also afford to pay his regular
monthly  expenses,  and  make  his  payments  towards  resolving  his  student  loan  debt.
Applicant stated that when he starts his payment plan with the creditors he understands
that he will be making payments for more than ten years to resolve these debts.  (Tr. pp.
47-53.)
