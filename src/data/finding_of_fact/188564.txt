There  is  one  forfeited  deed  in  lieu  of  foreclosure  allegation  and  11  delinquent
accounts alleged under ¶ 1 of the November 2021 SOR. The accounts are in collection
or charged  off.  The  debts  became  delinquent  between  April 2014  and  May  2020.  The
total  amount  of  debt  is  $64,537,  including  a  balance  Applicant  owes  to  the  mortgage
company  for  mortgage  fees  related  to  the  SOR  ¶  1.a  account.  Applicant  admitted  all
financial  accounts  under  SOR  ¶  1.  (Undated  answer  to  November  2021  SOR)  The
Government credit bureau reports dated September 2021 (GE 2) and March 2021 (GE
3),  and  Applicant’s  September  2019  PSI  (GE  4),  confirm  the  validity  of  the  listed
delinquent debts.
Under  SOR  ¶  2,  Applicant  denied  that  he  falsified  information  about  his  child
support. (¶ 2.a). Though he admitted ¶ 2.b, he answered “no” to the delinquent account
questions  because  he  did  not  have  his  credit  report  available.  (Undated  answer  to
November 2021 SOR)
Applicant is 40 years old. According to his August 2019 e-QIP, he served in the
United  States  Navy  (USN)  from  June  2001  to  March  2009,  when  he  was  honorably
discharged with a 30% disability that is currently 50%. In April 2003, he married his first
wife. They had three children. He divorced his first wife in March 2014. He attended an
aviation school from September 2014 to June 2016. He indicated that he did not receive
a diploma. (GE 1 at 13) He married his second wife in December 2014. They have two
children, ages four and three. Applicant has worked for his current employer since 2017.
In September 2022, he was promoted to a quality assurance inspector after beginning
his  employment  as  a  mechanic  with  this  contractor.  (Tr.  21-23)  Before  his  current
employment, he worked in jobs as an aircraft mechanic or mechanic. During his period
of  unemployment  from  September  2014  to  June  2016,  he  was  attending  an  aviation
school. (GE 1 at 9-40)
Reasons for Financial Problems
Applicant was issued a child support order in April 2013. Following six years of
making timely payments on his mortgage, his first late payment in September 2013 was
due to the  earlier  child support order. After he  could  not  achieve  an  adjustment  of  the
mortgage in October 2013, he listed the property for sale in November 2013. When he
could not execute a short-sale of the property, in June 2014, he relinquished the deed to
the mortgage company. (SOR ¶ 1.a) He still owes the company late fees amounting to
about  $35,000.  The  mortgage  company  filed  a  judgment  in  November  2016,  which
Applicant has not addressed to date. After his divorce from his first wife in March 2014,
he moved to another state in September 2014 to attend an aviation school. While at the
school,  he  planned  to  pay  his  expenses  using  his  disability  pay  and  his  wife’s
anticipated  salary  at  the  school’s  location.  He  claims  he  graduated  in  June  2016,
however, in his August 2019 e-QIP, he stated that he did not graduate. (GE 1 at 13; Tr.
10-18)
Applicant opened other credit-card accounts between 2014 and 2019 to cover
day-to-day  expenses  (Tr.  23),  moving  expenses  (Tr.  28),  and  utility  bills  (Tr.  35),  that
eventually became delinquent. He opened a cable account at a time not disclosed in the
record.  (Tr.  31)  He  purchased  a  car  in  March  2014  (Tr.  37-39).  He  fell  behind  in
payments and the car was repossessed in late 2015. In sum, he opened new accounts
while he had outstanding delinquent accounts.
SOR  ¶   1.a   –   Applicant  owes  approximately  $35,000  in  late  fees  to  the
mortgage  company.  Though  Applicant  did  not  specifically  explain  reason  for  the  late
fees, I find the fees  were  assessed because failure to pay the mortgage payments  on
time. (Tr. 14-16) See GE 3 at 1.
SOR  ¶   1.b  –  This  was  a  credit-card  account  that  Applicant  opened  in  early
2014 that became delinquent in the summer of 2014. (GE 3 at 2) Applicant informed the
credit-card  company  that  he  was  in  school,  and  he  would  resume  paying  when  he
graduated.  He claimed  they  told him to resume payments when he  could.  There  is no
evidence that Applicant has made any payments to the creditor since 2014. (Tr. 23-27)
SOR ¶  1.c –  Applicant used this credit card in the same manner as SOR ¶ 1.b.
The  account  became  delinquent  in  April  2014.  The  creditor  advised  Applicant  in  2019
that they closed the account and requested the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) treat the
delinquent  balance  as  additional  income.  The  IRS  sent  him  a  Form  1099-C  to  reflect
that additional income. (GE 3 at 2; Tr. 27-28) The account is unresolved.
SOR ¶  1.d  –  Applicant believes this account is a credit card. He used the card
to pay for moving expenses after he  supposedly  graduated  from school in  June 2016.
The  account  became  delinquent  in  October  2017.  He  claimed  he  satisfied  the  debt  in
August 2020 and provided a confirmation number of payment. (GE 3 at 2; Tr. 28-29, 53;
Undated answer) No documentation was presented to prove the account was paid. The
account has not been paid.
SOR  ¶   1.e   –   This  is a utility  account  that  Applicant  claims  he  satisfied  in  July
2020. The account became delinquent in July 2016. (GE 3 at 2) Applicant contended he
satisfied the account in order to purchase a home. (Tr. 31) Applicant’s testimony is not
credible because he provided no documentation to support his pay-off claim.
SOR  ¶   1.f   –  This  is  a  cable  account  that  became  delinquent  in  March
2019. (GE 3 at 2) The unsupported claim that he satisfied the account in April 2020, and
has  a  confirmation  number,  is  not  sufficient  to  prove  he  satisfied  the  debt.  (Tr.  31;
Undated answer) The debt remains unresolved.
SOR ¶  1.g  –  Applicant claimed without proof that his account was related
to  SOR  ¶  1.j.  However,  because  the  tracking  comments  under  the  SOR  ¶  1.j  account
indicate it was sold in September 2017 and the SOR ¶ 1.g account was opened in April
2018,  I  find  the  two  accounts  are  the  same.  With  no  documentary  proof  of  paying  the
account  in  January  2020  in  bi-weekly  payments,  Applicant  still  owes  the  delinquent
amount appearing in SOR ¶ 1.j. SOR ¶ 1.g is resolved in Applicant’s favor. (GE 3 at 2;
GE 4 at 3-4; Tr. 33-34; Undated answer)
SOR ¶  1.h  –  This is a utility account that changed to a delinquent status in June
2019.  Applicant  indicated  he  satisfied  the  account  in  March  2020.  He  was  not  aware
that he owed electricity for his house that he returned to the mortgage company. (SOR
¶  1.a)  The  lack  of  corroborative  documentation  makes  Applicant’s  payment  claim  not
worthy of belief.
SOR ¶  1.i –  The installment car loan account became delinquent in July 2019.
Applicant purchased a car in March 2014, coinciding with his divorce and a few months
before  his  departure  to  another  state  for  aviation  school  in  September  2014.  He
believed  that  he  could  keep  abreast  of  payments  with  his  disability  pay  and  his  wife’s
anticipated  earnings  at  the  school  location.  After  his  payments  became  delinquent  in
September 2015, the car was towed. Subsequently, he returned the car payments to a
current status and the car company returned the car to him. He discovered a couple of
months later that he could not sustain car payments, and the car company repossessed
the car. (GE 3 at 5; Tr. 36-40)
SOR ¶  1.k  – This is a utility account that became delinquent in August 2019. He
stated  that  he  paid  the  account  in  August  2020.  He  provided  no  documentation
confirming that the debt was paid. . (GE 4 at 2, 4; Tr. 40; Undated answer) The account
is unresolved.
SOR ¶  1.l –  This is a mail-order account that became delinquent in May 2020,
when a  collection  company purchased the  account.  With no documentation  to  support
Applicant’s  claim  of  satisfying  the  account  in  November  2021,  the  debt  remains
unresolved. (GE 2 at 6; Undated answer)
Personal Conduct
SOR ¶  2.a  –  Applicant answered  “no”  to all questions under Section  26 of his
August 2019 e-QIP. He answered “no” to having any delinquency involving child support
enforcement in the last 7  years. Applicant denied that he has ever been delinquent on
his child support. He did not know that he was in arrears on child support because the
payments  have  always  been  automatically  withdrawn  from  his  paycheck.  The
September 2021 credit report shows that Applicant was only one month behind on child
support.  (GE  3  at  5;  Tr.  44-45;  Undated  answer)  SOR  ¶  2.a  is  resolved  in  Applicant’s
favor.
SOR ¶  2.b  –  Under the  Section  26  of Applicant’s August 2019  e-QIP, questions
involving  routine  delinquent accounts  in  the  past 7  years, Applicant answered  “no” that
he  did  not  have   any  debts  turned   over  to   collection,  or  credit  accounts  suspended,
charged off  or cancelled. Applicant claims he  answered  “no”  because  he  did  not have  a
credit  bureau   report  when   he   filled   out  the  e-QIP   in   August  2019.  (Tr   44-47)   While
lacking  a credit  report is a  reasonable explanation  for negative  answers  in the  financial
section,  I  do   not  find   his  claim   credible   because   he   knew  in  August  2019   that  he   had
delinquent  debts. He knew about the  delinquent credit-card accounts in SOR ¶¶  1.b and
1.c.   He   knew  about   the   car  he   purchased   in  2014,   that   was  first  towed   then
repossessed  when  he  realized  that he  could not  maintain  the  payments.  The  purpose  of
the   e-QIP   is  to   allow   an   applicant  to   make   truthful   responses   to   all   e-QIP   questions.
including   delinquent  debts.   When   Applicant   submitted   his  e-QIP,  his  “no”   answers  left
the  undeniable impression  that he  had  no  delinquent  debts.  Demonstrating  compliance
when   confronted   with   the   investigator’s  questioning   regarding   Applicant’s  delinquent
debts   in   his   subsequent   September  2019   PSI  does  not   cure   Applicant’s  untruthful
omissions of his delinquent debts from  his August 2019 e-QIP.
Applicant has never had financial counseling but believes that he needs it. He
does not have a written budget. He has about $100 left over each month after he pays
all his expenses. He enrolled in a debt consolidation company in November 2022. When
he learned the company could not help him, he cancelled the enrollment. (Tr. 50-51)
