Applicant  is a  33-year-old employee  of a  defense  contractor. He  served  on  active
duty  in   the   U.S.   military  from   2008   until  he   was  medically  retired   with   an   honorable
discharge  in  October 2017. He  served  two  combat deployments to  Afghanistan.  He was
injured   on   one  of  his deployments, and   he  has  post-traumatic stress  disorder   (PTSD).
He is rated  at 70% disabled  by the  Department of Veterans Affairs. He has worked  for
his  current  employer   or  a   predecessor  contractor  on   the   same   contract   since   shortly
after his discharge  from  the  military. He seeks to  retain a   security clearance, which  he
has  held   since   his military  service.   He   attended   college   for a   period   without  earning   a
degree.  He  married   in  2009   and   divorced   in  2018.  He  has  two   children   from   the
marriage  who  live  with  him. He married  his current wife  in 2018. (Transcript (Tr.)  at  16-

Applicant did not file his federal income tax return for tax year 2017 when it was
due  (SOR  ¶  1.a).  He  explained  that  his  tax  returns  were  simple  while  he  was  in  the
military. There were more  forms and other documents required for his 2017 return, he
was  pending  a  divorce,  and  he  missed  the  filing  deadline.  In  his  January  2019
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86), he reported that he failed to file in
2018. (Tr. at 23-26; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1-3) His 2018 tax return was not
yet  due  when  he  submitted  the  SF  86.  His  2017  tax  return  should  have  been  filed  in
2018. I am satisfied that he meant his tax-year 2017 returns, which should have been
filed in 2018.
Applicant  was  interviewed  for  his  background  investigation  on  March  19,  2019.
He admitted that he had not filed his 2017 federal income tax return. He stated that he
planned to file the return by the end of March 2019. Applicant was interviewed again in
October 2019. He stated that he had not filed his 2017 return as he was still attempting
to obtain the necessary documents. He stated that he filed his 2018 federal return and
recently went through an audit in which the IRS determined that he owed a 10% penalty
for a withdrawal from his Thrift Savings Plan. (GE 2, 3)
The  IRS  tax  account  transcript  for  2018  shows  Applicant’s  federal  income  tax
return was filed in March 2019; an amended return was filed in September 2019; there
was an examination of the return; and additional tax was assessed in December 2019.
His 2018 IRS wage and income transcript reports that he had taxable income of $8,177
and  $8,836  due  to  distributions  from  retirement  accounts,  with  $1,635  withheld  for
taxes.  The  extra
the  retirement-account
distributions.  The  remaining  taxes,  penalties,  and  interest  owed  for  2018  were  paid  in
April 2020 with the withholding of his refund from his 2019 taxes. (AE A, B)
taxes  owed  were  apparently  due
to
Applicant wrote in his response to the SOR that he filed his 2017 federal income
tax return “the following year in 2018 and was even audited.” Applicant testified that he
filed  his  2017  federal  return  in  late  2018  or  early  2019.  However,  he  admitted  in  his
October 2019 interview that he  had not  filed  the  return. He presented as evidence his
2018 IRS wage and income transcript and 2018 tax account transcript. He was informed
that  he  presented  transcripts  from  the  wrong  year,  and  that  a  2017  tax  account
transcript would clarify the matter and establish when the 2017 return was filed. (Tr. at
23-28, 40-41; Applicant’s response to SOR; AE A, B)
Applicant  stated  in  his  post-hearing  submission  that  his  2017  tax  account
transcript does not show up on the  IRS portal.  He stated  that he attempted to call the
IRS, but “[t]rying to get them on the phone is like pulling teeth.” He presented his 2017
wage  and  income  transcript  as  proof  that  he  filed  his  2017  return  and  paid  a  penalty.
That  document  does  not  state  whether  a  return  had  been  filed.  I  note  that  unlike  his
2018 wage and income transcript, his 2017 wage and income transcript does not report
any distributions from retirement accounts. (AE D, F)
The  SOR  alleges  Applicant’s  unfiled  2017  federal  income  tax  return  and  ten
delinquent debts totaling about $23,915. The debts are reported on one or more credit
reports.
Applicant  cosigned  the  lease  on  an  apartment  in  about  2017.  He  lived  with  the
other tenant previously and thought they could be roommates again. She told him that
she did not want him living there, and he never moved in. He later discovered that she
broke the lease shortly after moving in. The landlord listed the debt to the three credit
reporting  agencies  as  a  joint  account  placed  for  collection  with  a  balance  of  $11,057
(SOR  ¶  1.b).  Applicant  stated  that  the  monthly  rent  was  about  $700  to  $800,  so  it  is
unclear  how  the  landlord  arrived  at  the  $11,057  figure.  He  stated  that  he  has  been  in
contact with the cosigner, and they are working together to get some type of resolution
on the account. The debt is listed by all three credit reporting agencies on the October
2019 combined credit report as a joint account with an activity date of October 2019. It
is listed on the June 2020 and February 2021 Equifax credit reports with an activity date
of  July  2017.  It  is  not  listed  on  the  July  2022  Equifax  credit  report.  (Tr.  at  18-20,  42;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1-7)
SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d allege delinquent debts of $5,535 and $2,939 for two military
exchange credit card accounts. The debts were paid through a combination of attaching
Applicant’s  and  his  ex-wife’s  income  tax  refunds  and  payments  from  his  paycheck,
either  through  garnishment,  voluntary  payments,  or  a  combination  of  the  two.  Credit
reports show mostly declining balances of $6,703 and $2,444 in October 2019; $6,425
and  $2,684  in  June  2020;  and  $5,535  and  $2,939  in  February  2021.  The  July  2022
credit report lists both debts with $0 balances and the note, “Paid Collection.” (Tr. at 17,
43-44; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1-7)
SOR ¶ 1.e alleges a $1,896 delinquent debt to a collection company on behalf of
a  telecommunications  company.  Applicant  told  a  background  investigator  that  he
planned to dispute the account because he did not know that there were additional fees.
He denied owing the debt in his response to the SOR, claiming that it was “due to the
spoils  of  divorce.”  He  testified  that  he  and  his  ex-wife  had  an  account  with  the
telecommunications company, but he thought that they closed the account and paid the
final  bill  when  they  divorced.  He  stated  that  he  attempted  to  dispute  the  account.  The
debt is listed as an individual account on all of the credit reports in evidence. The date
of  last  activity  is  September  2017.  The  credit  reports  do  not  indicate  that  the  account
was disputed. (Tr. at 44-46; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 4-7)
SOR  ¶  1.f  alleges  a  $579  delinquent  debt  to  a  financial  institution.  The  debt  is
listed by all three credit reporting agencies on the October 2019 combined credit report
as an individual charged-off credit card, assigned in July 2008, with an activity date of
October  2019.  It  is  listed  on  the  June  2020  and  February  2021  Equifax  credit  reports
with an activity date of November 2014. It is not listed on the July 2022 Equifax credit
report. (GE 4-7)
Applicant  provided  inconsistent  explanations  about  the  $579  debt.  During  a
background interview in March 2019, he stated that he had to use the card following his
divorce,  and  he  would  take  steps  to  pay  the  debt.  In  his  October  2019  interview,  he
stated that he was unaware of any delinquency with the creditor, but he would contact
the creditor. He denied owing the debt in his response to the SOR, stating that he was
the victim of fraud, and that he would file a fraud claim to get the account resolved. He
testified  that  he  had  a  credit  card  account  with  the  creditor,  but  he  paid  it.  When
questioned  about  the  apparent  inconsistencies,  he  testified  that  he  let  his  brother  use
his bank account and routing number, which resulted in the fraud. Applicant’s 2018 IRS
wage  and  income  transcript  reports  that  this  creditor  issued  an  IRS  Form  1099-C
(Cancellation of Debt) in 2018, cancelling $2,144 of Applicant’s debt. There is no proof
that Applicant paid this debt, but I am satisfied that it is no longer being collected. (Tr. at
47-52; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-7)
Applicant  admitted  that  he  owed  the  $986  debt  to  a  bank  (SOR  ¶  1.i)  on  the
financing of a computer purchased from an electronics store in about 2015. The debt is
not listed on the most recent credit report. He has not paid it, and he acknowledged that
the debt likely fell off the credit report because of its age. He stated that he would pay it,
“[i]f need be.” (Tr. at 56-57; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-7)
Applicant  denied  owing  the  remaining  four  debts,  which  total  about  $923  (SOR
¶¶ 1.g, 1.h, 1.j, and 1.k). None of the debts are listed on the July 2022 credit report. (Tr.
at 21, 52-59; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-7)
Applicant  stated  that  he  is  serious  about  repairing  his  credit.  He  retained  a
financial  advisor  in  February  2023  to  provide  “[c]redit  evaluation  and  repair;  [and]
[u]nderwriting.” He maintains a budget. He stated that he owes the IRS about $738 for
tax  year 2021.1  He plans  to make payment arrangements  with the IRS.  (Tr.  at 23, 47,
68; AE D, E, G, F) He wrote post-hearing:
Since  the  hearing  I have  gone  back and  have  been  closely monitoring  my
credit.  I  have   created   a   budget   and   am   sticking   to   it.   I  have   sent
correspondence   to   each   of  the   creditors  in   question   as   per  my   rights
1  The  SOR  did  not  allege  that  Applicant  owed  taxes  from  2021.  Any  matter  that  was  not  alleged  in  the
SOR  cannot  be  used  for  disqualification  purposes.  It  may  be  considered  in  assessing  Applicant’s
credibility, in the application of mitigating conditions, and in the whole-person analysis.
placed  forth  by 15  U.S. Code  1692  from  the  Fair Debt Collection  Practices
Act (FDCPA). If  it comes back validated  that I in fact am  lawfully obligated
to  pay, I will  make  the  arrangements to  do  so. I never had  the  intent  of not
paying   my  debt.   However,  as  previously  stated   it  needs  to  be   proven   to
me  that the  information  is accurate, as some  was the  product of divorce.  I
desire  to  continue  to  repair  my credit and  regain your trust as well  as the
trust of the  Department of Defense. I desire  to  make  things  right so  that  I
may  continue   to  serve  my   country,  something   I  have   done   since   I  was
seventeen  years old. My wife  is picking  up  extra  shifts and  is prepared  to
help me  correct this situation. I also  have  hired  a  financial advisor to  help
me   navigate   through   these   issues.   The   sentiment  that   no   progress  has
been  made  with  my credit repair  is simply untrue. Since  the  onset of these
inquiries,   I  managed   to   repay  my   Star  Cards,  which   totaled   nearly  ten
thousand   dollars  in   debt.   That  alone   proves  my   propensity  for  repaying
debt, as well as the  leases I am  currently in,  all  are being  paid  on  time. I
also elected  to  begin placing funds in a 401K.  (AE E, G)
Applicant  submitted  letters  attesting  to  his  excellent  job  performance.  He  is
praised  for  his  calm  demeanor,  positive  attitude,  timeliness,  and  reliability.  He  is
recommended for a security clearance. (AE C)
Applicant provided an eloquent plea to retain his security clearance:
I  am   a   patriot  through   and   through,  I  am   [a]  disabled   combat  veteran.  I
have   always  been   willing   to   serve   my   country  and   answer  the   call   when
needed.   I   also   will   state   that   I   joined   the   [military]   during   a   time   of   war.  I
knew  exactly   what   I   was  getting   into,   and   rose   my  right   hand   with   pride
and   honor.  I  never  have   and  never   would  do   anything   that   would
jeopardize   the  safety   and   security  of   my  country   nor   my   brothers  and
sisters in arms.  (Applicant’s response to SOR)
