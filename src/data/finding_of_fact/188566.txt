children. He graduated from high school in 2008. He attended college from August 2008
to May 2009 and January 2010 to May 2011, and he earned an associate degree. He has

The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  had  five  delinquent  consumer  debts  totaling
$25,075  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.h,  1.j,  1.n,  1.o);  six  delinquent  student  loans  totaling  $26,688
(SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.g); four delinquent medical debts totaling $906 (SOR ¶¶ 1.i, 1.k-1.m); a
$2,484 judgment entered against him October 2019 for an eviction action filed by a former
landlord (SOR ¶ 1.p); and at least five eviction actions brought against him from 2015 to
2021 for failure to timely pay his rent (SOR ¶ 1.q). The SOR allegations are established
by Applicant’s admissions in  Answer 1 and Answer 2; his May 2020 security clearance
application (SCA); four credit bureau reports from 2013, 2020, 2021, and 2022; and court
records. (Answer 1; Answer 2; GE 1-7)
to   his
Applicant  attributed   his
immaturity,
financial   difficulties
mismanagement,  and   a   lack  of  income.  In   addition,  his  former  girlfriend   became
unemployed   during   the   COVID-19   pandemic,  and   her  inability  to   contribute   to   their
household   expenses  compounded   his  financial  problems.  He   began   working   with   a
nonprofit credit counseling  agency in September 2022  to  resolve SOR ¶  1.o,  as well a
credit card  not alleged  in the  SOR  that was not delinquent. He pays the  credit counseling
agency $273  monthly,  and  the  agency  makes  payments  to  both  creditors on  his behalf.

financial
SOR ¶  1.a  is a  $13,158  charged-off  auto  loan. Applicant  co-signed  this loan  with
his  former  girlfriend   in   approximately   2015,  with   the   understanding   that  she   was
responsible   for  repaying   it.  She   stopped   paying   the   loan   when   they  ended   their
relationship  shortly after  they purchased  the  car. When  the  creditor  contacted  him  at  an
unrecalled  date,  he  made  several payments  of an  unrecalled  amount until he  could no
longer afford to  do  so,  and  then  the  creditor repossessed  his former girlfriend’s car.  He
made  a  mistake  co-signing  this loan  for his former girlfriend,  and  he  learned  not to  co-
sign  for anyone  in the  future. In  approximately 2018, he made  several payments of an
unrecalled  amount,  but  he  could  not consistently afford to  do  so. He contacted  the  creditor
in approximately August 2022.  In  September 2022,  he  reached  a  payment arrangement
with   the   law  firm   collecting   the   debt   on   the   creditor’s  behalf,  consisting   of   bi-weekly
payments of $170. He made  two  payments  of $340  in October  2022  and  November 2022,
and  he  set up the  remaining  payments  through  automatic  deductions.  (Answer 1; Tr. at
24-29, 60-61, 63, 65,  75-81, 109-110, 113-115, 123-125; GE 1-4, 6;  AE A,  K,  Q)
Applicant incurred approximately $25,000 in student loans while attending college
from 2010 to 2011. (SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.g) After his 2011 graduation, he made an unrecalled
number of monthly payments, between $100 and $150, but stopped because he could no
longer afford such payments. He believed his loans were then deferred until an unrecalled
date. The creditor garnished $366 from his wages bi-weekly, from December 2019 to April
2020, and then stopped due to the COVID-19 student loan payment pause. He made a
$30 payment in August 2021. In September 2022, he contacted the creditor and entered
into a rehabilitation agreement consisting of $5 monthly payments for nine to ten months,
after which time the creditor would determine a new monthly payment plan. He scheduled
his $5 monthly payments for automatic deductions. Although his payments were paused
due to the COVID-19 pandemic forbearance, he made a $100 payment in October 2022,
and his first $5 payment under the rehabilitation agreement was scheduled for January
2023. He intends to comply with the rehabilitation agreement and continue to resolve his
student loans. (Answer 1; Tr. at 29-33, 48-50, 81-84, 109-110; GE 1, 3-5; AE B-C, K, Q)
SOR  ¶  1.h  is  a  $2,619  collection  account  for  the  outstanding  balance  on  his
apartment lease that he rented with a roommate in approximately 2014. He did not recall
the amount of his monthly rent. He stated in Answer 1 that he contacted the management
company to verify this debt and was referred to a collection agency. When he contacted
the collection agency, it did not have a record of this debt, and he was further researching
it to see if it was referred to a different collection agency. In August 2022, he settled and
paid this debt for $2,108. (Answer 1; Tr. at 33-35, 95-107, 113-116, 121-123; GE 3; AE

SOR ¶¶ 1.i and 1.k through 1.m are Applicant’s medical debts. He was unaware
of them until he received the SOR, and then researched them through Credit Karma. He
paid SOR ¶ 1.i. in September 2022. He consolidated and settled SOR ¶¶ 1.k through 1.m
and made an initial payment of $40 in August 2021; he made $50 monthly payments from
September 2021 to July 2022; and the creditor notified him in August 2022 that he paid
these debts. He reached a preauthorized recurring payment arrangement for SOR ¶ 1.l,
consisting  of  a  one-time  payment  of  $40  in  August  2021,  followed  by  $50  monthly
payments from September 2021 to October 2022. (Answer 1; Tr. at 35-37, 40-41, 84-87;
GE 1, 3, 4; AE E, G, H)

95; AE H)
SOR ¶ 1.o is a $704 past-due loan. Applicant obtained a $10,000 loan in March
2020 so that he could pay his daily living expenses, and he missed one or two payments
on  the  loan.  He  was  resolving  this  debt  through  the  credit  counseling  agency,  as
discussed above, and the loan was in good standing. The credit counseling agency made
a payment on his behalf to this creditor in September 2022 and October 2022, for $203
and $211, respectively. (Tr. at 42-45, 66-75, 109-110; GE 1, 7; AE I-K)
SOR ¶ 1.p is a $2,484 judgment entered against Applicant in October 2019 for an
eviction action filed by his former landlord. Applicant lived in this apartment complex with
his former girlfriend until several weeks before the hearing, when he moved in with his
parents. He did not receive any court notices concerning eviction proceedings filed by this
landlord, and he was never evicted from this apartment. He acknowledged that he was
delinquent in his rent payments. Applicant contacted the creditor in August 2022 and was
in  the  process  of  negotiating  a  payment  arrangement  to  resolve  this  debt.  He made  a
$1,000  payment  in  November 2022  as  a  showing  of  good  faith.  (Tr.  at  45-50,  95-107,
113-116, 121-123; GE 6; AE K, O, Q)
At least five eviction actions were brought against Applicant from 2015 to 2021, for
failure to timely pay his rent. As with SOR ¶ 1.p, he maintained that he never received
court notices concerning eviction proceedings, and he was never evicted from any of his
residences.  He  acknowledged  that  he  was  delinquent  in  his  rent  payments  at  various
residences, and he received notices from his landlords concerning his delinquent rent.
(SOR ¶ 1.q; Tr. at 51-53, 95-107, 115-116, 121-123; GE 6)
Applicant developed  a  budget with  the  help  of the  credit  counseling  agency. He
moved  in with  his parents several weeks before the  hearing  to  save  money so  that he
could continue  to  resolve  his debts. His  annual salary in 2018, when  he  started  working
for  his   employer,  was   $83,000;   as   of   the   date   of   the   hearing,  it  was  approximately
$92,000.  His   monthly   net   income   was  $4,116,   and   his   monthly   net   remainder  was
approximately $1,769  after expenses, which  included  payments to  the  credit counseling
agency.  He  also  received  credit counseling  through  the  credit counseling  agency, through
which  he  learned  how to  manage  his expenses with  a  budget and  how to  begin a savings
account.   He  understood   the   importance   of   responsibly  managing   his  finances.   His
manager rated  his performance   favorably for   the   July   2019   to   July   2020   rating   period.
She  described  him  as reliable and  stated  that he  was “turning  into  one  of my go[-]to  team
members.”  Ten  individuals, to  include  a  sibling, life-long  friends,  former coworkers,  and
coworkers,  attested  to  his trustworthiness, reliability, and  judgment (GE  7-8, 23-24, 43-
45, 48-51, 53-65, 107-109, 111-121, 125-126; AE I-K, M-N, P-Q)
