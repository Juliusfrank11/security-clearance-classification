Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted for nine delinquent
accounts  totaling  $32,848.  In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admits  each  of  these
debts  and  states  their  current  status.  Applicant’s  admissions  are  incorporated  in  my
findings of fact.
Applicant,  60,  is  a  service  technician  analyst  currently  working  for  a  defense
contractor since January 2011. He served honorably on active duty in the Air Force from
1987 until 2011. He was deployed to Iraq in 2006 to and 2007. He married in 1990 and
divorced  in  1993.  He married  again  in  2000  and  divorced  in  2013.  He  has  three  adult
children  and  a  17-year-old  child.  He  earned  his  bachelor’s  degree  in  2017.  He  has
continuously held a security clearance since 2002, and was granted his first clearance
while on active duty. (GX 3; GX 5.)
Applicant has a history of struggling financially and told the investigator during his
personal subject interview (PSI) in November 2019 that he was not good at managing his
finances.  However,  Applicant  and  his  second  wife  incurred  joint  debt  during  their
marriage, some of which became delinquent while he was deployed in 2006-2007. They
separated  in  2012  and  she  moved  with  their  two  minor  children  to  another  state.  The
delinquent  joint  accounts  became  Applicant’s  sole  responsibility  through  the  divorce.
Beginning during their separation, Applicant had $400 to $500 per month of his military
retirement payments automatically deducted and sent to his wife. From 2012 until June
2020,  $2,000  per  month  in  child  support  was  automatically  deducted  from  his  pay.
Beginning in July 2020, his child support obligation decreased to $1,500 per month. He
will continue to pay this obligation until September 2023.. (GX 5; GX 4; GX 3.)
Beginning in July 2019, Applicant was unable to meet his mortgage-loan payment
requirements. In August 2019, his wages were garnished for a delinquent account in the
amount  of  $2,053.  In  late  2019  or  early  2020,  the  mortgage  lender  began  foreclosure
proceedings on Applicant’s mortgage. Ultimately, the house was sold in a short sale and
Applicant’s financial obligations to the mortgage lenders were satisfied. In January 2020,
Applicant’s wages were garnished for a delinquent account in the amount of $2,666. (GX
5; GX 11.)
The status of the SOR debts is as follows:
¶ 1.a  - $5,783 credit-card account  – paid a negotiated amount (AX A; GX 12);
¶  1.d  and  1.g  - $2,051  and  $3,222  credit-card account  – duplicate – paid (AX A;
GX 11);
¶ 1.f  - $5,706 mortgage-loan  account –  paid a negotiated amount (GX 12);
¶ 1.h  –  $2,180 credit-card account  –  paid (GX 10);
¶ 1.i - $2,576 credit-card account – paid (GX 10.)
These paid accounts total $16,086.
¶ 1.b  - $2,842 credit-card account  – charged off, no longer on CBR (GX 12);
¶ 1.c - $2,475 credit-card account – charged off, no longer on CBR (GX 12);
¶ 1.e  - $6,013 personal loan  – charged off $0 balance (GX 12).
These accounts totaled $11,330.
Applicant has taken steps to improve his financial circumstances. In September
2022, he hired a credit-repair company that also provides credit education to contact the
creditors of his delinquent accounts and establish settlement agreements or repayment
plans. The credit-repair company will advise Applicant on how to resolve the debts. He
also has enlisted his sister to help him with his budget and debt resolution. He entered a
repayment plan for the credit-card debt alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.g in April 2021 prior
to  receiving  the  SOR,  and  the  account  was  paid  in  full  in  July  2022.  The  SOR  debts
alleged in ¶¶ 1.f, 1.h, and 1.i were resolved with the short sale of the house prior to the
issuance of the SOR. Applicant received an offer to settle the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a
on July 27, 2022, and paid the settlement offer on August 22, 2022. AX A; AX B; AX E;

Applicant’s June 7, 2022, CBR shows that he had several accounts that became
delinquent  in  2020  and  2021  that  were  not  alleged  in  the  SOR.  He  paid  two  of  the
collection accounts for $2,867 and $4,139 in August 2022. The CBR shows that he had
total delinquent revolving-account debt of $2,873. This total is comprised of two charged-
off  credit-card  debts,  one  for  $2,065  and  the  other  for  $808.  He  entered  repayment
agreements for these two accounts in March 2023. Under the agreements, he is paying
$172 a month for 12 months on the account with the $2,606 balance and is making four
$200 payments on the account with the $808 balance. (GX 11; AX D.)
The  June  2022  CBR  also  shows  that  Applicant  opened  an  automobile-loan
account in the amount of $36,743 in October 2020, which was charged off in April 2022
in  the  amount  of  $36,100.  However,  his  March  1,  2023,  CBR  shows  that  the  account
balance was $33,310. He is actively negotiating with the creditor to reach a settlement
agreement  or  to  enter  a  repayment  plan.  Of  the  13  installment-account  debts  that
Applicant currently has open, with a total balance of $39,450, this is the only delinquent
account. (GX 11; AX A; GX 12; Response.)
Applicant’s  March  2023  CBR  also  shows  that  he  has  a  high  revolving-account
credit limit but low credit usage. He currently has 45 open revolving accounts with a total
credit limit of $105,409. However, between June 7, 2022, and March 1, 2023, Applicant
reduced his total revolving-account debt from $15,149 to $7,028 and his total delinquent
revolving-account debt from $9,780 to $2,873. Applicant submitted a budget spreadsheet
that includes a list of the balances of his current debts and the monthly payments on each
account. As of March 15, 2023, Applicant’s total revolving-account debt was $5,972, his
total  delinquent  revolving-debt  was  $2,673,  and  his  total  installment-account  debt  was
$37,424. He will make a payment on each of the two delinquent revolving-debt accounts
on March 17, 2023, bringing the total delinquent amount down to $2,301. He will continue
to make monthly payments on his current accounts. (AX C; GX 11; GX 12; Response.)
Applicant  makes  payments  on each  of  his ongoing  financial  obligations  through
automated payments, including his recent repayment plans. He has also been making
double  payments  on  several  of  his  open  accounts.  He  has  reduced  his  nonessential
spending, and is using accounting software tools that help him track his overall spending.
He is working on establishing savings. Applicant lives within his means, has not incurred
any  delinquent  debt  in  over  two  years,  and  is  paying  or  working  to  resolve  all  of  his
ongoing  financial  obligations.  He  accepts  responsibility  for  not  having  managed  his
finances  as  diligently  as  he  could  have  in  the  past  and  has  committed  making  better
financial decisions in the future. (AX B; AX C; Response.)
