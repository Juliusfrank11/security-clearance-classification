In  her  answer,  Applicant  admitted  all  the  SOR  allegations  (¶¶  1.a-1.f).  Her
admissions  are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  Based  on  my  review  of  the
pleadings, evidence submitted, and testimony, I make the following additional findings of
fact:
Applicant is 37 years old. She has never been married and has no children. She
attended  some  college  classes  in  about  2015.  She  has  worked  in  shipbuilding  for  a
defense contractor for about four years. (Tr. 16-18; GE 1)
The SOR alleges six delinquent debts totaling $20,433, including $5,482 of student
loans in collection, $304 of medical debt in collection, and $14,647 for a charged-off auto
loan. The status of the allegations is as follows:
SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b  are  student  loans  in  collection  for  $3,365  and  $2,117,
respectively. Applicant reported that she attended some college classes in about 2015.
She stated that after she completed these classes, she never made any payments on her
student loans, and admitted she has no plans to make any payments. These loans are
unresolved. (Tr. 23-31; GE 2, 3)
SOR  ¶¶ 1.c-1.e are medical debts placed for collection for $169, $69, and $66,
respectively.  Applicant stated  that  these  debts  were  either copays or deductibles.  She
asserted that she would consider paying the two small debts but has not taken any action
on them. These debts are unresolved. (Tr. 24-24; GE 2, 3)
SOR ¶  1.f is an  auto  loan  that  was charged  off  for $14,647. Applicant stated  that
in about 2015, she  co-signed  a  loan  for a  new car for her sister. Her sister made  payments
for a  few months, but  then  stopped  and  the  car was repossessed. She  reported  that she
has no  idea  what  ultimately happened  to  the  car. She  stated  that she  has not  taken  any
action  to  resolve this debt and  has no  plans to  pay  it. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 25, 28-
29, 36; GE 2, 3)
Applicant  has  not  had  any  credit  counseling  and  did  not  submit  a  budget.  She
claimed that she brings  home about $3,200 monthly and  has about  $2,000  in monthly
expenses.  She  reported  that  in  early  2021,  she  got  a  random  text  message  from  a
company offering to assist her with “updating her credit.” She first thought it was a scam,
but  looked  up  the  company  on  the  internet.  She  paid  them  about  $1,000  over  seven
months to look at her debt and “update her credit.” They did not make any debt payments
on her behalf. She reported that she is not sure what they did for her and did not ask a
lot of questions. She stated that she wants to purchase a home, so she hoped this service
would make it easier for her to get a mortgage. (Tr. 18-23, 33)
