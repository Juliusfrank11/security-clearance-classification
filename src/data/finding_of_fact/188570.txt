Applicant is a 37-year-old single woman. She is a high school graduate and has
taken  some  college  courses.  She  is  a  secretary  who  has  been  working  for  various
employers in this line of work since 2015, and has been working with her current employer
since December 2021. (Tr. 13)
In  the  late  2010s, Applicant worked  as the  secretary in  a  chiropractor’s office.  (Tr.
20) She  was  laid  off in  March 2020  after  the  pandemic  began  and  was either  unemployed
or underemployed  for  the  next  20  months.  (Tr. 18)  During  this time,  she  received  rental
assistance and unemployment compensation. (Tr. 18)
Applicant  has  approximately  $25,000  of  delinquent  debt.  The  debts  alleged  in
subparagraphs  1.a,  and  1.f  through  1.k  are  delinquent  medical  bills,  totaling  $3,800.
Subparagraph  1.b  is  the  deficiency
from  a  repossessed  car,  totaling  $7,600,
subparagraphs  1.c  and  1.d,  totaling  $15,000,  are  delinquent  student  loans,  and
subparagraph  1.e,  totaling  $970,  is  a  delinquent  credit  card.  She  incurred  these  bills
primarily because through most of her career, she has been living paycheck to paycheck,
struggling to pay bills. (Tr. 29) During her lengthy unemployment during the pandemic,
her struggle to pay bills devolved into a struggle to avoid eviction, as she had to apply for
rental assistance from her county of residence. (Tr. 18) While unemployed, she briefly
worked as a grocery delivery driver, but had to stop when her car broke down. (Tr. 18)
Applicant incurred the medical bills because she did not have medical or dental
insurance for several years. (Tr. 16) When she periodically fell ill, she did not want to risk
her health, so she would go to the emergency room. (Tr. 22) Unable to pay the bills when
she received them, she would set them to the side to pay when she could afford them,
but  then,  forget  about  them.  Applicant  intends  to  begin  paying  these  bills  after  she
satisfies more pressing ones. (Tr. 23)
Applicant purchased a car in 2016. The monthly car note was $315. (Tr. 24) Often
unable  to pay the full amount,  she  frequently  made  partial monthly  payments.  (Tr. 24)
Gradually, the delinquencies from these partial payments “started to add up.” (Tr.  24) In
March  2021,  the  car  was  repossessed.  The  amount  alleged  delinquent  in  SOR
subparagraph 1.b totals the amount delinquent at the time of the repossession. Since the
repossession, the holder of the car note resold the car. The remaining deficiency totals
$2,722. (GE A) Applicant has not yet begun a payment plan to satisfy this debt. (Tr. 25)
Applicant originally opened her student loan accounts in 2005. As of July 27, 2021,
she was paying the creditor $5.00 per month under a payment plan. (Answer at 1) As of
January  2023,  there  was  a  government-mandated  pause  on  federal  student  loan
payments. (AE B)
Subparagraph  1.e,  totaling  $970,  is  a  credit  card.  She  has  not  satisfied  the
delinquency, yet, but has been in contact with the creditor. (Tr. 16)
Applicant does not maintain a budget and continues to live paycheck to paycheck.
(Tr. 29) She tracks her bills with a wall calendar to ensure that every time she gets paid,
she  makes  a  bill  payment.  (Tr.  30)  She  has  a  job  as  a  bartender  to  supplement  her
income. (Tr. 29) She did not submit a copy of the wall calendar. Recently, she took a part-
time job.  The salary from this job is unknown from the record.
