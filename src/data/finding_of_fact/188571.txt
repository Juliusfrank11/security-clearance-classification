He denied SOR allegations ¶¶ 1.b, 1.e, and 1.g. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He retired from the
U.S.  Air  Force  in  June  of  2010  and  has  been  employed  with  the  defense  contractor
since June of 2010. He has held a security clearance since about 1987. He is divorced
and has one adult child. (TR at page 31 line 14 to page 44 line 7, and GX 1 at pages 7,
13, 18, 25 and 36~37.)  He attributes his financial difficulties to a failed  side-business,
involving firearms, and to his divorce.
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
1.a. Applicant admits that he has a past-due debt to Creditor A in the amount of
about $6,530 “for computers.” Since April of 2022, Applicant has been making monthly
payments  of  $320 towards  this admitted debt,  as  corroborated  by documentation  from
Creditor A.  (TR at page  44  line  18  to  page  48  line 8, and  AppX  E.)    This allegation  is
found for Applicant.
1.b.  Applicant  denies  a  past-due  debt  to  Creditor  B  in  the  amount  of  about
$1,001. He avers that this debt has been “paid in full,” as is corroborated by a document
from  the  successor  creditor  to  this  debt.  (TR  at  page  48  line  9  to  page  50  line  6,  and
AppX F.)  This allegation is found for Applicant.
1.c, 1.d and 1.f. Applicant admits that he has past-due debts to Creditor C in the

business; and have been either “successfully settled” or “paid in full,” as corroborated by
documentation from Creditor C. (TR at page 50 line 7 to page 54 line 25, at page 55 line
24 to page 58 line 20,  and AppXs G, H, KK and LL.)  These allegations are found for
Applicant.

$3,177. He avers that this debt has been “paid in full,” as is corroborated by a document
from the successor creditor to this debt. (TR at page 55 lines 1~23, and AppX I.)  This
allegation is found for Applicant.

This allegation is found for Applicant.
Guideline I - Psychological Conditions
2.c. (These allegations are discussed chronologically) Applicant admits that since
at least August of 2016, he has been treated for depression. He was treated by “several
doctors and several different medicines.” These medications would work for a while, but
then Applicant  would begin feeling  like  “a  zombie.”  As  a  result,  Applicant  would  go  off
the medications for periods of “a couple of months,” as recently as February 2020. (TR
at page 86 line 22 to page 83 line 6, and at page 97 line 7 to page 99 line 5.)
2.b. Applicant admits that in November of 2020, he was involuntarily hospitalized
for  suicidal  ideation.  However,  not  to  exacerbate  his  situation;  Applicant  intentionally
loaded his firearm, backwards, so that it could not be discharged. He also spoke to his
treating physician prior to  his hospitalization.  (Tr  at  page 71  line 23  to  page 77  line 7,
and at page 90 line 1 to page 96 line 1.)
2.a.  Applicant  admits  that  in  July  of  2021,  he  was  involuntarily  hospitalized  for
twelve  days  as  the  result  of  suicidal  ideations.  (GX  7.)    Prior  to  this  hospitalization,  in
discussions  with  his  treating  physician,  Applicant  “realized  .  .  .  that  he  “was  just
chemically off balance.” After his discharge, and with a change in medication, Applicant
has “been 100 percent better since then.” (TR at page 64 line 11 to page 71 line 19, and
at page 103 line 17 to page 112 line 25.)  His treating physician testified that Applicant’s
change in “the medication [was] definitely a turning point.” She avers that “his prognosis
is  great  .  .  .  as  long  as  he  takes  his  medication.  It’s  a  chemical  thing.”  Applicant’s
treating physician has no cause “for concern regarding . . . [Applicant’s] judgment, . . .
trustworthiness or . . . reliability.” (TR at page 115 line 21 to page 134 line 5.)
