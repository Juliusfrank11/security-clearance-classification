Applicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security
clearance.  Admitted  facts  are  adopted  and  incorporated  by  reference.  Additional
findings of fact follow.
Background
Applicant never married and has one child from a prior relationship for whom he
is  obligated  to  pay  currently  enforced  weekly  child  support  through  garnished
deductions  of  his  paychecks.  (GE  1;  Tr.  16)  He  earned  a  high  school  diploma  in  May
2003 and a bachelor’s degree in May 2010. (GE 1) He reported no military service.
Since October 2010, Applicant has been employed by his current employer as a
system design engineer. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 33) He has held a security clearance since 2011.
(GE 1)
Applicant’s finances
Between   November   2018   and   December  2019,   Applicant   accumulated
delinquent  medical  and   consumer  accounts   exceeding   $44,000.  (GEs  2-5)  Included
SOR debts  are  as follows: 1.a  (a  medical  debt  for $163);  1.b  (a medical debt  for $488);
1.c (a utility debt for $272); 1.d  (a consumer debt for $2,947); 1.e  (a consumer debt for
$6,428);  1.f   (a  consumer  debt  for  $950);  1.g   (a  consumer  debt  for  $15,184);  1.h   (a
consumer debt for $4,625); 1.i (a consumer debt  for $8,579); and  1.j (a consumer debt
for $5,647). (GEs 2-5;  Tr. 42-44)  These  debts are  listed  in  Applicant’s credit  reports as
unresolved and outstanding.  (GEs 2-5)  Once  he was able to verify these reported debts,
Applicant confirmed  the  following: (a) the SOR  ¶  1.j debt was previously satisfied;  (b) he
had   either  worked   out   settlement  agreements  with   the   creditors  (SOR  ¶¶   1.d-1.f   and
1.h-1.i);   he   was  still   working   with   the   creditors.  (SOR  ¶¶   1.c  and   1.g);   and   (c)   he   was
unable to resolve his two remaining delinquent accounts with the information available
to him (as with SOR creditors 1.a-1.b). (AEs B-L)
Applicant attributed  his  debt delinquencies to a  poor start out  of  college before he
even   received   his   first  paycheck  from   his  first  employer  in   2010.  (Tr.  31)  While   flying
home   from   college,  he   was  stopped   at  a   local  airport  and   cited   for  having   a   loaded,
albeit legal, handgun  inside  his checked  luggage  bag. (Tr. 28) The  airport  citation  cost
him   $8,000,   in  addition   to   added   attorneys  fees.   Additional  unexpected   expenses
included   weekly  court-ordered   (in   August   2022)  payroll garnishments  of   $650   to   cover
his child  support arrearage  and  payments to  his student loan  lenders. (AE  A; Tr. 36, 39-
40)
With   a   recent  promotion   and   salary  increase,  expected   reduction   in  his  student
loans  due   to   the   student  loan   forgiveness  program,   and   his  son’s   reaching   the   age   of
majority   (freeing   him   from   child   support  obligations),  Applicant   stressed   his  “new
roadmap   to   how  he   can   pay”  his  unresolved   SOR   debts.   (AE   E;   Tr.  31,   58)  His  post-
hearing  submissions credited  him  with  resolving  his SOR ¶  1.j debt  with  a  prior payoff
($5,647) and  payment agreements with  SOR creditors 1.d  (agreed  monthly payments of
$50   beginning   in  October  2022);  1.e   (agreed   monthly  payments  of  $150,  beginning   in
September  2022);  1.f  (agreed   monthly  payments  of  $60,   beginning   in  October  2022);
1.h   (agreed   monthly payments   of   $55.49,   beginning   in   October 2022); and  1.i   (agreed
monthly payments  of $142, beginning  in September 2022). (AEs C and H-L)
Before the issuance of the initial decision in this case, Applicant documented his
payoff  of  his  SOR  ¶  1.j  debt  and  payment  agreements  with  five  of  his  SOR  creditors
(SOR creditors ¶¶ 1.e-1.f and 1.h-1.i) His agreements were accompanied by scheduled
first  payments  in  compliance  with  the  terms  of  the  respective  agreements.  (AEs  D-L)
Each of his payment agreements were concluded after the hearing and involved agreed
scheduled  monthly  payments  to  be  honored  by  Applicant  in  the  future  and  were
accompanied by scheduled first due payments.
Still unresolved prior to the remand of this case were  his listed debts with SOR
creditors 1.a-1.c and 1.g. With these three creditors, Applicant had been unsuccessful in
resolving  his  debt  delinquencies  before  the  completion  of  the  initial  hearing  and  post-
hearing proceedings. (Tr. 59-60)
Since  the  remand,  Applicant  has  continued  to  make  his  monthly  payment  in
compliance  with  the  payment  schedule  established  for  each  of  the  debt  delinquencies
covered by SOR ¶¶ 1.d-1.f and 1.h-1.i. (AEs N-R) Applicant also documented his payoff
of the debt covered by SOR ¶ 1.g with an $8,500 payment. (AE M) Altogether, Applicant
addressed all but three of the listed SOR debts (SOR  ¶¶ 1.a-1.c). (AE E) These three
unresolved  debts  total  less  than  $1,000  and  do  not  materially  detract  from  his  overall
good-faith efforts in resolving his delinquent accounts.
In  his  hearing,  Applicant  represented  that  he  currently  earns  around  $100,000,
and  nets  around  $5,000  a  month.  (Tr.  35-36)  After  allowing  for  monthly  expenses,  he
estimated  a  net  monthly  remainder  of  around  $1,000.  (Tr.  35-36  62)  With  such  a
remainder,  more  good-faith  payments  on  his  delinquent  accounts  presumably  can  be
reasonably expected. (Tr. 62-63) Applicant reported no savings account, but did claim a
401(k) retirement account with about $120,000 in the account. (Tr. 38)
