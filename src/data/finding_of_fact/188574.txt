Applicant,  age  45,  has  been  married  since  2019  to  his  wife  with  whom  he  had
cohabited  since  2008.  He  received  his  bachelor’s  degree  in  1999.  He  worked  as  a
journalist for the same publication for 20 years; a job he began one week after graduating
college.  He  held  various  positions  as  the  publication  became  a  subsidiary  of  several
companies over the years until  December 2018, when his position was eliminated. He
was unemployed until June 2019. He decided to pursue a new career path and has been
employed as a communications specialist by a defense contractor since June 2019. This
is his first application for a security clearance. (GE 1; GE 2 at 6; Tr. at 9, 26-28, 29, 37,
43)
Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for tax years
(TY) 2012 through 2020. As of the date of the SOR, he had filed his TY 2017 returns and
the other returns remained unfiled. Since then, he has filed all delinquent returns with the
help of a professional tax preparer. Tax account transcripts  confirmed that the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) received his TY 2017 returns on May 28, 2021; TY 2019, 2020,
and 2021 on September 19, 2022; TY 2013 and 2018 on September 27, 2022; and TY
2014 and 2016 on September 28, 2022. Although the IRS had not yet confirmed receipt,
he credibly testified that he filed paper returns for TY 2015 on September 15, 2022; and
TY 2012 on October 3, 2022. Additionally, he was unable to obtain confirmation from the
state; however, he credibly testified that he filed his state returns with his federal returns.

On his June 7, 2019 SCA, Applicant attributed the delay in filing his returns for TY
2012 through 2018 to unemployment and having “missed [the] deadline.” He explained,
I need  to consult a tax  advisor to file  back income taxes; have been  unable
to  do  so  without  funds . . . I am  very much  aware  that my lack of filing  income
taxes is a  severe issue  that I need  to  address ASAP  and  will  be  doing  so
immediately  upon   regaining   employment.   I  have   not,   in  any  way,   been
contacted  by either the  [Internal Revenue  Service  (IRS)] or [state] for  owing
of taxes and  believe  I  do  not currently owe state  or federal income  tax as I
claimed no exemptions with my employers since 2001. (GE  1)
During his July 24, 2019 security clearance interview (SI), Applicant explained that
he was in the process of searching for professional help with filing his delinquent TY 2012
through 2018 returns. He reiterated that he did not believe that he owed any taxes for the
years he failed to file his returns, because he was claiming zero tax deductions from his
paychecks. He asserted that he was willing to repay any tax debt owed. He anticipated
that once he successfully obtained a professional to assist him, he would be able to file
the delinquent returns. He asserted that he would never file late again. (GE 2 at 4)
In  his  September  20,  2021  response  to  DOHA-issued  interrogatories,  Applicant
stated that he had been working with a professional tax preparer. However, due to the
COVID-19 pandemic, the process was taking longer than he originally anticipated. At the
hearing, he explained that it was not until he received the interrogatories that he realized
the potential negative impact on his security clearance. (GE 2 at 7; Tr. at 25)
Applicant attributed his delayed filings to the “snowball” effect of him missing the
deadline to file his TY 2012 returns. He had successfully filed his returns using an online
tax  software  program  prior  to  TY  2012.  For reasons  he  could  not  explain  or  recall,  he
missed the deadline for TY 2012 and “did not think to file late.” Then, the software would
not allow him to input data for TY 2013 without the data for TY 2012, which he did not
have. He did not make any further efforts to file his TY 2012 or 2013 returns until after he
completed his SCA in June 2019. (GE 1; GE 2 at 7; Tr. at 16, 39, 41, 43)
Applicant accepted full responsibility for what he called a “very stupid, very foolish
mistake” in failing to timely file his returns and to initiate action to resolve the delinquent
returns  sooner.  With  respect  to  reasons  for his  persistent  delays,  he  stated,  “I am  not
making any excuse for my actions whatsoever,” and “[t]there’s nothing that I am going to
say  that  does  not  sound  stupid.”  He  acknowledged  that  he  did  not  “take  it  seriously
enough” until “finally getting  smacked  by having  to  find  another job.” He explained  that
when he saw the question on the SCA asking whether he had timely filed his tax returns,
he  realized  the  repercussions  of  failing  to  do  so.  Prior  to  seeing  that  question,  he
understood that he had a requirement to file his returns. However, he had not prioritized
doing  so  because  he  did  not  anticipate  owing  any  taxes.  In  all  the  years  that  he  filed
income  tax  returns, he only ever owed  taxes one time in the amount of about $178 in
about 2004 or 2005, due to an error his employer made on his tax-withholding form. He
assumed that the IRS or state would reach out to him if he owed any money. He never
received any notices or communications about his missing returns and never followed up
with either the IRS or his state. (GE 2 at 7; Tr. at 16-17, 23, 31, 40, 43-44)
After  Applicant  completed  his  SCA  and  before  his  SI,  he  conducted  internet
searches to see what needed to be done to rectify his delayed filings. Although he did not
recall the specific dates, he attempted reaching out to his wife’s tax preparer prior to hiring
her  in  May  2021.  However,  the  COVID-19  pandemic  impaired  their  ability  to  connect,
because she was only working with current clients at the time. He wanted to hire the same
tax preparer that his wife (filing separate returns) and her parents used. (GE 2 at 4; Tr. at
33, 51-54, 64-66)
Applicant attributed his lack of action to resolve his delinquent returns between the
time he completed his SCA and when he initially reached out to his tax preparer to a lack
of funds and COVID-19-related delays. While he was not sure how much it would cost to
hire a tax preparer, he assumed it was more than he could afford, because his wife had
routinely  paid  about  $100  per  year  for  filing  her  separate  returns.  Once  he  became
employed in 2019, he prioritized getting caught up on bills that had fallen behind during
his period of unemployment. He also wanted to build a “financial cushion.” (GE 2 at 4; Tr.
at 33, 51-54, 64-66)
Before being laid off, Applicant earned $59,000 annually. After he was laid off in
September  2018,  the  unemployment  compensation  and  the  monthly  installments  he
received as part of his $9,000 severance package were insufficient to meet his expenses.
Although  he  could  not  recall  exactly  how  much  the  monthly  installments  were,  he
estimated that they  were  just about enough to pay his mortgage and nothing  else.  He
ended up paying $1,000  to  the tax preparer in one  lump sum  via his wife’s credit card,
because he and his wife could not afford to pay cash. He did not want to borrow from his
401k due to excessive taxes he would incur. He preferred not to pay the tax preparer in
installments. As of the hearing, he had about $1,000 in savings and earned an annual
salary  of  $61,000.  His  wife  earned  about  $55,000  annually.  He  explained  that  they
generally do not have funds left over after paying two car payments, their mortgage, and
groceries. (Tr. at 37-38, 47, 64-72)
Applicant hired the tax preparer on May 11, 2021, at which time he also delivered
all the necessary tax information for her to file his TY 2012 through 2020 returns. That
same day, she was able to prepare and file his TY 2017 returns. She anticipated that she
would be able to turn her attention to the  remaining  returns  in  “about  a  month  or two.”
However, that timeline was delayed because “she had fallen severely ill.” They connected
again in August 2021, but she was further delayed due apparently to some inattention on
her part and the nature of the task. Because he believed she was doing him a “huge favor”
in remedying his voluminous late filings, he felt it would be “rude” to rush her. However,
once he found out that he would be having a hearing, he contacted her, at which time she
apologized for the delay, and “then she put her foot on the gas and got everything squared
away [sic] she possibly could.” (GE 1; GE 2 at 7; Tr. at 32, 53-57)
Applicant delivered  his TY 2021  information  to  the  tax preparer in a  timely manner,
but  she  delayed  filing  it to  finalize  earlier returns and  then  filed  them  together. He  currently
has no  outstanding  federal or state  tax debt. After filing  all  his returns,  TY 2014  was the
only year in  which  he  owed  any  income  taxes.  Immediately upon  receipt  of  a  $62  bill from
the   IRS   for  TY  2014,  he  paid   it  in  November  2022.  Then,  in  March  2023,  $408   of  his
$1,505   TY   2022   refund   was  applied   to   the   balance   owed   for  TY   2014   penalties  and
interest.  He   filed   his   TY  2022   return   early.   He   plans   to   continue   using   the   same   tax
preparer to  ensure that  his returns are  timely filed  in  the  future.  (AE  B-H; Tr. at 54,  61, 72-
73, 85)
Applicant  understands the  importance  of  filing  his returns  on  time. He  loves  his
country and  enjoys  serving  and  promoting  the  military through  his work.  He  described
himself  as  an  honest  and  trustworthy  person.  With  respect  to  his  delayed  filings,  he
asserted  that  he  “never  consciously  thought  that  I’m  going  to  pull  one  over  on  the
Government.  I  never did  this maliciously.”  He  also  asserted,  “I understand  and  realize
wholeheartedly  that  my  initial  actions  were  neglectful,  but  I  have  taken  action  that  will
ensure  I never,  ever  find  myself  in an  even  remotely similar position  again.”  His  direct
supervisor  wrote  a  letter  praising  his  trustworthiness  and  work  performance.  She
confirmed  that  he  self-reported  his  delayed  tax  return  filings  and  his  efforts  to  resolve
them. (AE A, B; Tr. at 24, 42, 84-85)
