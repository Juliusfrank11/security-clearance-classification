Per the  SOR and  the  Amended  SOR, Applicant incurred  approximately $50,000  of
delinquent  debt.   The  debt alleged  in subparagraph  1.a, as duplicated  in  subparagraph  1.h,
totals  approximately  $10,000.  (Answer  at  1)  It is a  deficiency remaining  from  a  car  that
Applicant  purchased  in the  early 2010s. (Tr. 60)  Applicant  voluntarily  surrendered  the  car  in
approximately 2016  after he  could  no  longer make the  car payments  after a  death  in the
family compelled  him  to  provide  financial support to  some  extended  family members.  (Tr.
21)  Within  a  year of surrendering  the  car, in 2017, Applicant traveled  to  another country  for
a  six-to-ten  day vacation.  (GE 1  at 17)  In  approximately  2021,  Applicant  began  reaching  out
to the creditor to ascertain the status of the debt.  (Tr. 60)  In  October  2022,  he  received a
letter from  the  current creditor informing  him  that the  file was closed  on  this debt, and  that
they  had  terminated  collection  action. (AE  K)  Applicant previously  owned  another car  that
was repossessed in  2006 for failure to  pay  the loan. (Tr. 68)
The debt alleged in subparagraph 1.b, totaling $4,204, stems for a furniture loan.
Applicant resolved it in October 2022. (AE H)
The  debt  alleged  in  subparagraph  1.c,  totaling  $1,917,  is  a  delinquent  loan.
Applicant opened it in 2015 and was originally scheduled to have satisfied it by January
2017. (AE G) Although he did not satisfy it by the agreed-upon date, he was current on the
amount due as of October 2022. (AE G)
The debt alleged in subparagraph 1.d, totaling $1,364, was owed to an insurance
company. On October 19, 2022, Applicant confirmed his contention that this debt was paid.
(AE F)
Subparagraph 1.e, totaling $1,090 is a loan Applicant opened to finance a vacation.
As of January 2022, this account was paid in full.
The debts alleged in subparagraphs 1.f and 1.g are timeshare maintenance fees.
Applicant admits that he purchased a timeshare for a one-bedroom property, but explained
that when he canceled the one-bedroom property agreement and upgraded it to a two-
bedroom property,  the company  never cancelled  the  maintenance fees for the original
purchase, and instead, billed him maintenance fees for both the one-bedroom property and
the two-bedroom property. (Tr. 29-31) Applicant brought this discrepancy to the attention of
the timeshare company, and it confirmed that he no longer owes money for either property.
(AE J)

medical treatment Applicant received in the spring of 2019. (Tr. 27)  Applicant receives
medical benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs (the VA) for a service-connected
disability. (Tr. 27; GE B) Per the agreement, the VA should have covered the bill, but they
did not receive it from the hospital. (Tr. 27; GE B) Neither Applicant, nor the VA has been
able to contact the current collection agent for the bill. (Tr. 28) Applicant disputed the bill
with a credit reporting agency and it was removed from his credit report. (Tr. 74)
Applicant owes delinquent state  income  tax  for tax  years 2010  and  2011,  as  alleged
in subparagraph  1.j.  As  of  January 2020, the  delinquency totaled  $8,243. (GE  5  at 1)  That
month, Applicant entered  a  payment  agreement whereupon  he  was to  pay  $244  per  month
over the  next 36  months to  satisfy the  account. (GE 5) Applicant has not made  payments
consistently. (Tr. 77) He attributed  his failure to make  consistent payments to  “little small
issues [that]  kind  of arose  and [that]  kind of made  [him]  broke  for the  payment  plan.”  (Tr.
78)   The   month   Applicant   entered   the   payment   plan,  he   spent   $2,000   on   an   overseas
vacation. In  January 2021, he  spent $2,000  on  another overseas vacation, and  in August
2021,  he  spent  $2,000  on an  island  vacation for his tenth  wedding  anniversary. (GE  1 at
42)  In  August 2022, Applicant financed  the  purchase  of  a  luxury  vehicle  through  an  $82,000
loan. (Tr. 48)

developed a payment plan. (Tr. 85)

the past two years at a job earning $30,000. (Tr. 37) Before then, she was unemployed for

insurance bills. (Tr. 88) When she was unemployed, Applicant had to handle these bills.

approximately  $1,500  in  a  savings  account.  (Tr.  89)  One  week  before  the  hearing,  on
October 18, 2022, Applicant enrolled in financial counseling.
