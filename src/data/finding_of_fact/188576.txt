The SOR alleged  under Guideline H, and cross alleged under Guideline E,  that
Applicant  used  marijuana,  with  varying  frequency,  from  approximately  May  2020  to  at
least April 2021. (SOR ¶ 1.a) It also alleged that her use of marijuana from approximately
May  2020  to  at  least  April  2021  occurred  while  she  was  granted  access  to  classified
information. (SOR ¶ 1.b)
Applicant  used  marijuana  approximately  twice  monthly  from  May  2020  to  April
2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic. She maintained  that she did not use marijuana
recreationally, but to manage her anxiety from the impact the pandemic had on her, her
family,  and  her  employment.  She  did  not  find  her  prescription  medication  helpful  in
managing her anxiety, and she did not want to go through the process of seeking medical
help during the pandemic. She used marijuana in edible form at night as a sleep aid. Her
spouse obtained it from his mother, who had a medical marijuana card in state A, or he
purchased it from a legal marijuana dispensary  when they visited family and friends  in
state C. She stopped using marijuana in April 2021, when she received her COVID-19
vaccination. (Answer; Tr. at 17-47, 49-65, 68-70; GE 1-3; AE A)
Applicant acknowledged that her decision to use marijuana to manage her anxiety
was  a  bad  one.  She  understood  that  her  use  of  marijuana  while  holding  a  security
clearance was unwise, against the rules, and jeopardized her ability to continue to hold a
clearance.  She  self-reported  her  marijuana  use  on  her  May  2021  security  clearance
application and she discussed it during her July 2021 background interview. (Answer; Tr.
at 17-47, 49-65, 68-70; GE 1-3; AE A)
Applicant  has  no  future  intention  to  use  marijuana  or  other  illegal  drugs.  She
sought medical help with managing her anxiety in state B in February 2022, and she has
since been under her doctor’s care for anxiety and insomnia. Her doctor prescribed her a
different medication for managing her anxiety and helping her sleep. She also exercises
and has developed hobbies to further manage her anxiety. She and her spouse do not
have  any  marijuana  in  their  home.  She  indicated  during  her  July  2021  background
interview that she had never tested positive for illegal drugs. She  is subject to random
drug  testing by her employer. As of  the date  of the  hearing, her employer had not yet
selected her to report for such a test. In March 2022, she signed a statement of intent not
to illegally use any drugs, to include marijuana, and that any violation would be grounds
for automatic revocation of her security clearance. (Answer; Tr. at 17-47, 63-68; GE 1-3;
AE A)
Applicant provided letters of support from her spouse as well as three friends she
has  known  for  over  10  years.  Each  of  them  attested  to  her  trustworthiness,  integrity,
reliability, and judgment. Her employer has favorably rated her performance annually and
has awarded her for her performance in 2020 and 2021. As of the date of the hearing,
she  was  in  a  pool  of  candidates  for  promotions  for  management  and  director-level
positions. (Answer; Tr. at 68-70; AE A)
