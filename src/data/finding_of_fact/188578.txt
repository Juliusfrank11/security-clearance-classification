In Applicant’s SOR response,  he admitted all of the allegations in SOR  (¶¶ 1.a,
through 1.g). His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.
Applicant is a 63-year-old aircraft mechanic who has worked for a DOD contractor
since March 2013. He has continuously worked for various DOD contractors since 1995.
He currently earns $65,000 a year in this position. He received an airframe power plant
license in 1994. He is married and has three adult children. His wife is currently employed
as a medical technologist. Her annual salary is $80,000. (Tr. 20-22, 48; GE 1)
Financial Considerations
Applicant stated  that he  experienced  financial problems over the  years due  to  his
wife’s periods of unemployment,  his personal  health  issues, and  because  his home  was
heavily damaged  by  fire in  May 2021.  His wife  was  unemployed from  November 2009  to
February  2011,  December  2012   to   May  2015,  and   from   February  2021   to   September
2022, for a  total  of  63  months.  He  said  his wife  had  been  laid  off from  these  employments,
but he  did not give an  explanation  as to  why she  was unable to  find  employment for an
extended  period  of time  between  jobs. In  November 2020, Applicant had  elective surgery,
which   soon   required   a   second   surgery  after  he   developed   a   staph   infection.  He   later
acquired   another   serious  infection,  MRSA,  which   required   even   more  antibiotics  and
seven  weeks of intravenous fluids  and  a  return  to the  hospital for surgery. Then, on  May
27,   2021,   his  house   caught  on   fire  and   the   damages   totaled   over  $300,000.   He   had
homeowner’s insurance at the time of the fire.  (Tr. 23-35, 41, 48; AE  E; GE  2)
The SOR alleges four separate bankruptcy filings (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d).
Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in October 2001. The case was discharged in
January  2002.  He  then  filed  for  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  in  May  2010.  The  case  was
discharged in August 2010. In August 2018, he filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, but since
his  tax  returns  were  not  yet  filed,  the  bankruptcy  case  was  dismissed.  He  refiled  for
Chapter  13  bankruptcy  in  June  2019.  This  case  was  subsequently  dismissed  in
September 2022. (Tr. 29, 39; GE 6, GE 7, GE 8, GE 9, GE 10; AE C; SOR Response)
Applicant stated that he filed for the first Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2001 because he
and  his  wife  fell  behind  on  paying  their  credit  cards,  and  a  creditor  had  garnished  his
wages.  His  wife  had  been  laid  off  from  her  part-time  employment  as  a  medical
technologist. They decided to file for bankruptcy  in 2001 to  stop the garnishment. The
second Chapter 7 bankruptcy was filed in May 2010, after his wife had been laid off from
her full-time employment in November 2009. The Chapter 13 bankruptcy, initially filed in
2018, and then refiled in 2019, was initially filed due to their delinquent home mortgage,
and  their  home  being  placed  into  foreclosure.  While  the  bankruptcy  case  proceeded,
Applicant was able to obtain a mortgage loan modification and get the foreclosure action
dismissed.  Once  that  was  arranged,  he  intentionally  failed  to  make  payments  to  the
trustee, and allowed the Chapter 13 bankruptcy case to be dismissed. (Tr. 28-35, 37-39,
42, 45-47; AE B, AE E)
The SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file his Federal and state income
tax returns for tax years 2012 through 2018. He failed to pay his Federal and state taxes
for those tax years, as required, and the taxes remain unpaid. (SOR ¶¶ 1.f, and 1.g.) In
Applicant’s response to the SOR, he stated that all of his tax returns were filed except for
tax year 2019. He attributed the late filings due to complications from his wife’s identity
theft. He did not give a sufficient explanation as to why he was unable to file his income
tax returns separately during those years, or why his wife could not file her tax returns on
paper rather than electronically, which is the method the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
advises when an individual’s identity is compromised. (Tr. 40-41, 45; SOR Response; GE
1, GE 2)
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  stated  that  all  unfiled  state  and  Federal  income  tax
returns had been filed. He was uncertain of the total amount of state and Federal back
taxes owed. He had not yet arranged a payment plan with the IRS or with the state tax
office, but he hoped to start making tax payments soon. The IRS filed a proof of claim in
August 2019 through the bankruptcy court.  The  claim for unpaid Federal taxes  totaled
$20,304 for tax years 2011, 2013 through 2018. No information was provided about the
total amount of delinquent state taxes owed. These tax debts remain unresolved. (AE B,
AE D; Tr. 39-45)
The SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted for delinquent student loans totaling
$33,220 (SOR ¶ 1.e). He stated that these loans are currently in deferment due to the
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, and that he is not obligated
to make payments while they are deferred. He admitted that these student loans were
delinquent  before  the  CARES  Act  deferment  in  March  2020.  It  is  his  intention  to  start
repaying  these  student  loans  when  they  come  out  of  deferment.  (Tr.  43,  49;  SOR
response, GE 2)
The  2015  state  tax  return  in  the  record  reflected  that  Applicant  and  his  spouse
earned  $95,000  for  the  year.  In  2016,  they  earned  $97,340.  In  2017  and  2018,  they
earned  six  figures,  $108,121,  and  $100,606,  respectively.  In  2020,  Applicant’s  filed
separately with  reported  income  of $67,165, and  in  2021, his income  was  reported as
$48,878. I did not see separate income tax returns for his spouse for tax years 2020 or
2021,  but  this  may  be  due  to  her  period  of  unemployment.  Based  on  Applicant’s
testimony, their joint income for tax year 2022 should be near the six-figure range again,
with his wife now employed. (GE 2; Tr. 48)
