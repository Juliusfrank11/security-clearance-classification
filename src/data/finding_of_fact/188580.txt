evidenced by documentation attached to his Answer. (TR at page 55 line 20 to page 57

Russia. All of Applicant’s siblings, to include his eldest brother, live in the United States.

Administrative  Notice
As  Applicant no  longer has a  Filipina  fiancé, I only take administrative  notice  of
the following facts about Russia:  It is a highly centralized authoritarian political system
dominated  by  its  president.  Russia  has  violated  Ukraine’s  sovereignty  and  territorial
integrity in 2014 and again in 2022. Russia is a serious threat to our national security.
