Applicant is a 55-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since June 2019. He served in the U.S. military from 1987 until he
was  honorably  discharged  in  1992.  He  deployed  in  support  of  Operations  Desert
Shield/Desert Storm. He  is a high school graduate. He is married for the second time.
He has three adult children. (Tr. at 18, 20-22; GE 1; AE A)
The IRS informed Applicant that he owes about $50,000 in federal taxes for  tax
years 2008 through 2011. Applicant admitted that he owed the IRS, but he stated that it
should be less than $50,000. He stated that the mothers of his three children permitted
him to claim the children as exemptions, but apparently one or more of the mothers also
claimed  one  or  more  of  the  children.  The  current  status  of  the  taxes  is  unclear.  He
stated that the last letter he received from the IRS indicated that he owed, with penalties
and  interest,  about  $50,134.  He  is  still  “battling”  with  the  IRS.  He  submitted  no
documentation from the IRS as to the balance owed for his taxes. He has not yet filed
his federal income tax return for tax year 2021.1  (Tr. at 18, 37-41; Applicant’s response
to SOR; GE 2)
Applicant  had  a  good  job  in  an  industry  that  can  be  volatile.  There  was  an
upheaval in the industry in 2015, which significantly cut his hours and reduced his pay.
His annual income went from about $153,000 down to about $72,000. He was unable to
pay all of his bills, and he stopped paying his debts. (Tr. at 16, 19-20, 28-30; GE 1-4)
The SOR, as amended, alleges the federal tax debt and 19 delinquent consumer
debts totaling about $94,600. Applicant admitted owing all of the  debts. The consumer
debts are also listed on credit reports.
1  The SOR did not allege that Applicant failed to file his 2021 income tax return. Any matter that was not
alleged in the SOR cannot be used for disqualification purposes. It may be considered in the application
of mitigating conditions and in the whole-person analysis.
Applicant  has  not  made  payments  toward  any  of  his  delinquent  debts,  and  he
does not intend to. He rejected bankruptcy because he  considers that “the worst thing
that  you can do.”  He  is  earning  a good  salary  again,  about  $146,000 per year, but he
stated  that  he  has  put  his  old  debts  behind  him.  His  wife  is  a  teacher  earning  about
$36,000 per year. He stated that the debts are  “water under the bridge,”  he is treating
them  as  a  learning  experience,  and  he  is  “just  moving  forward.”  He  is  waiting  for  the
debts  to  fall  off  his  credit  report  because  they  are  beyond  the  seven-year  reporting
period.  He  believes  that  his  finances  have  stabilized,  and  there  will  be  no  additional
issues going forward. He has not received financial counseling. (Tr. at 16-22, 25, 27-37,
41-43, 46-47; GE 2-4)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
April 2019. This is the only SF 86 in the record. He did not report any specific financial
issues,  but  he  reported  that  he  was  “currently  utilizing,  or  seeking  assistance  from,  a
credit counseling service or other similar resource to resolve [his] financial difficulties.”
He wrote that he was using a credit repair service to rebuild his credit, and that he was
getting  rid  of  bad debt and  rebuilding  his credit.  Applicant  denied  intending  to  mislead
the DOD about his finances. He stated the application was long, he could not remember
all  of  his  accounts,  and  he  knew  that  he  could  discuss  the  information  with  an
investigator. He discussed his finances and tax issues during his June 2021 background
interview. (Tr. at 17-19, 37, 43-44; GE 1, 2)
