The SOR alleges 34 delinquent debts totaling approximately $87,267, including 22
delinquent  student-loans  totaling  $66,601  and  12  delinquent  credit  accounts  totaling
$20,666.  In  Applicant’s  Answer  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  all  the  allegations.  His
admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 39-year-old property and asset management analyst employed by a
defense contractor since September 2017. He was employed as a laborer from July 2009
to July 2014, a warehouse coordinator from July 2014 to July 2016, and worked in retail
sales from May 2016 to January 2023. He has never held a security clearance. (GE 1; Tr.
14, 29, 35-42)
Applicant  attended  a  university  from  August  2001  to  May  2003,  a  state  college
from  2007  to  2009,  and  enrolled  in  a  different  college  in  2021,  but  has  not  earned  a
degree. He married in July 2013 and has been separated since September 2020. He has
one child, age nine. (GE 1; Tr. 29-31, 33-34, 117-127)
Applicant  attributes  his  financial  problems  to  unemployment,  underemployment,
financial  support  to  extended  family  members,  and  mistakes.  (Tr.  95-97,  110-117)  He
testified that he admits his mistakes, continues to try and correct them, and has made
steady progress on his delinquent debts. (Tr. 25-28, 109)
The evidence concerning the specific SOR allegations is summarized below.
SOR ¶ 1.a: auto loan charged off for $8,177 for repossessed vehicle. Applicant
admitted  the  allegation.  (Answer;  Tr.  25)  He  testified  that  the  loan  was  for  his  wife’s
vehicle, that after falling behind on payments they contacted the creditor and made small
payments to avoid repossession but could not afford the required payments. The vehicle
was  repossessed  and  sold  at  auction,  and  Applicant  was  notified  that  the  deficiency
balance  was  approximately  $8,000.  (Tr.  52-67)  Credit  records  show  the  account  was
opened in February 2015, delinquent from August 2019 to January 2020, and charged off
for $6,806 with a past-due balance of $8,177. (GE 2 at 7, GE 3 at 2, GE 4 at 7) This debt
is not resolved.
SOR  ¶¶  1.b-1.i  and  1.u-1.hh:  student  loans  placed  for  collection  totaling
approximately $66,601. Applicant admitted each allegation. (Answer; Tr. 25) He testified
that he incurred $30,000-$40,000 in student loans from 2001 to 2003 and 2007 to 2008,
that  he  could  not  afford  to  make  the  required  payments,  and  that  he  had  sought  and
qualified for deferment or forbearance on several occasions. (Tr. 67-77, 121) He said that
he had not communicated well with his creditors, but that he had made some payments,
perhaps as recently as 2021, and resolved some of the debt. (Tr. 72-73, 79-80, 99-102,
127) He noted that his federal income tax refund for tax year 2019 was withheld to pay
his  delinquent  student loans.  (Tr. 46)  In 2021,  he  was told  that he was  not  eligible  for
additional student  loans.  (Tr.  78-79,  102).  He  said that  consolidating  his student loans
and paying them off was “on his list of things to do.” (Tr. 102) He testified that prior to the
hearing,  he  had  engaged  in  email  communications  regarding  student-loan  payment
options and his possible eligibility for additional deferments. (Tr. 80-82) He provided no
documentary  evidence  to  support  his  claims  that  he  had  contacted  his  student-loan
creditors or made payments on his student loan debt.
Credit reports from March 2020 and August 2019 show the debts alleged in SOR
¶¶ 1.b-1.i, and SOR ¶¶ 1.u-1.x and 1.z-1.hh, as past due and assigned to the government
for collection. (GE 3 at 2-3, GE 4 at 11-14) After careful review of the credit reports I have
determined that the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.i are duplicated in SOR ¶¶ 1.u, 1.v,
1.z-1.bb,1.dd,  1.ff,  and  1.hh  and  find  those  allegations  for Applicant.  A  February 2021
credit report shows 13 student loan accounts totaling $36,180 past due and assigned to
the government for collection. (GE 2 at 4-7)
SOR ¶¶ 1.j-1.k: telecommunications accounts placed for collection of $1,190
and $1,463. Applicant admitted the allegations. (Answer; Tr. 25) He testified that when
he and his wife were unable to make payments in about 2019, he contacted the creditors
about settlement but had not settled the accounts. (Tr. 82-85) He said that he was in the
process of trying to settle his individual debts or enter a debt-consolidation program. (Tr.
83) Credit reports reflect the accounts were placed for collection prior to August 2019.
(GE 3 at 3, GE 4 at 8-9) He provided no documentary evidence of efforts to resolve the
delinquent debts.
SOR ¶ 1.l: credit card charged off for $290. Applicant admitted the allegation.
(Answer;  Tr.  25)  Credit  reports  show  the  account  was  charged  off  for  $290  and  that
Applicant paid the charge off. (GE 2 at 10, GE 3 at 3, GE 4 at 9) This debt is resolved.
SOR  ¶¶  1.m-1.q:  medical  accounts  placed  for  collection  of  $344;  $1,620;
$148; $753; and $499. Applicant admitted the allegations. (Answer; Tr. 25) He testified
that  the  debts  were  delinquent  insurance  co-payments  for  family  medical  expenses
including hospital visits, urgent care, testing, and office visits in about 2018 or 2019 that
he could not afford to pay.  (Tr. 86-90) He said that he was not in a payment plan, but
planned on paying the debts, believed that some of them no longer appeared on his credit
report, and thought that some of the debts had been resolved. (Tr. 90-91) A credit report
reflects the accounts were placed for collection no later than August 2019. (GE 4 at 9-10)
He provided no documentary evidence that the debts were resolved.
SOR ¶¶ 1.r-1.s: apartment debts placed for collection of $3,235 and $2,720.
Applicant admitted the allegations. (Answer; Tr. 25) He testified that the debts were for
two apartments he leased from about 2012 to 2014. He moved about two months before
the  first  lease  term  ended  because  he  was  unsatisfied  with  the  property  manager’s
response  to  criminal  activity.  (Tr.  32,  91-92)  He  was  required  to  vacate  the  second
apartment due to nonpayment of rent. He notified the landlord that he had been laid off
and made some rental payments but was asked to vacate after falling about two months
behind on rent. (Tr. 95-97) He understood that he was responsible for arrearages on both
leases but did not believe they would be so much. (Tr. 93-95, 97) He did not communicate
with his landlords after vacating the apartments because he did not see the debts on his
credit report and hoped they would not be reported. (Tr. 94-95, 97-98) Credit reports from
August 2019 and March 2020 reflect both debts were placed for collection; neither debt
is reflected in a February 2021 credit report. (GE 3 at 2, GE 4 at 10-11, GE 2)
SOR ¶ 1.t: insurance debt placed for collection of $227. Applicant admitted the
allegation. (Answer; Tr. 25) He testified that he planned to pay or negotiate a payment
arrangement in the near future because it is a “smaller amount out of all the other debt
that I have.” (Tr. 98) He said that he did not contact the creditor when the account became
delinquent, but that he tried to pay it down before it was charged off. (Tr. 98) Credit reports
reflect the debt was placed for collection and one report states that “consumer disputes
this account information.” (GE 2 at 1, GE 4 at 11) He provided no documentary evidence
of any payment on this debt or of a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the debt.
Applicant testified that he earned $1,500-$2,000 per month while working in retail
from May 2016 until September 2017. (Tr. 42-43) He earned approximately $27,000 per
year,  when  hired  by  the  defense  contractor  in  September  2017,  and  his  gross  annual
salary has increased to $66,000. (Tr. 38-42, 103) He did not provide a financial budget,
but estimated his monthly expenses at approximately $3,000, including his car payment
($600). (Tr. 103-108) He said that he has less than $1,000 left after monthly expenses.
(Tr. 108-109) His total bank account balances  are approximately $2,000 and he has a
retirement account but  does not know the  current  balance  and has borrowed  from the
account to pay off some debts. (Tr. 109) He has not sought financial counseling. (Tr. 103)
Applicant  testified  that  he  failed  to  file  federal  income  tax  returns  for  tax  years
2017, 2020, and 2021. He said that he attempted to electronically file returns for tax years
2021 and 2022, but that they had been rejected. He also said that he was working with a
tax preparer and intended to submit all delinquent federal income tax returns. (Tr. 43-50)
Any derogatory information not alleged in the SOR will not be considered for disqualifying
purposes; however, it may be considered in the application of mitigating conditions and
in a whole-person analysis.
