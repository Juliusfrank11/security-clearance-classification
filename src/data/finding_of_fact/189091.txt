Applicant is 57 years old and is a college graduate (July 1990). She married in May
1996  and  divorced  in  December  2011.  She  has  two  sons  ages  20  and  24.  She  was
unemployed  from  January 2015,  when  her employer eliminated  her position, until July
2016, when she was hired by the same employer, a federal contractor.  (GE 1.)
Under  Guideline   F,   the   August  31,  2021   SOR  alleged   that  Applicant:   (a)  failed
timely to  file federal income  tax returns for tax years 2010,  2011,  2013,  2015, and  2016;
(b) failed  timely to  file a federal income tax return for tax year 2017; (c) is indebted  to  the
federal government for unpaid taxes of $9,439, for tax year 2016; (d) failed  timely to  file
state  income  tax  returns for tax years 2012  and  2013: (e) failed  timely to  file state  income
tax returns for tax years 2014  and  2015, and;  (f)  is indebted  to  the  state  for a  tax lien  of
$19,419, entered  against  her in  December 2013.  (SOR.) She  admitted  those  allegations.
(Answer.)
Applicant  testified  about  the  circumstances  she  faced  that  preceded  and
accompanied her federal and state income tax problems. She estimated that what she
called  “the  chaos” started  “earlier” than she even  knew, about 2005.  (Tr. 48.) In  about
2010, she found out her husband had been cheating on her and had been for years. In
2011, he failed timely to file their 2010 income tax returns. (Tr. 20.) She had relied on her
husband to file their income tax returns. In hindsight, she did not know “everything about
the financial aspects of marriage.” “It was a hard time because of what was happening in
the marriage.” In 2009, she and  her husband separated, but “it took about until 2011 to
get the papers filed.” (Tr. 20-21.)  The divorce was finalized in 2012. (Tr. 13-14.)
In January 2015, three years after the divorce, Applicant’s job was eliminated. She
went  from  a  six  figure  income  to  zero.  In  response,  she  started  her  own  consulting
business.  But  the  business  only  generated  about  $12,000  per  year.  So,  in  2016,  she
started doing hourly work for her former employer earning $12 per hour. She worked her
way up to nearly what she was earning before her position was eliminated. In July 2016,
she was re-hired full time by her former employer. She now earns $123,000 per year. (Tr.
39-41; GE 1.)
The following are the SOR allegations, the relevant testimony, and exhibits.
SOR ¶¶  1.a  - b:  Failure  timely  to  file  federal  income  tax  returns  for 2010-2011,
2013, and 2015-2017.  Applicant believed she filed all those tax returns in 2019, because
she was a candidate for a public trust position at that time. That filing was before the SOR
was issued in August 2021. She missed her filings, because of the “difficulties” in her life,
e.g., “failed marriage, divorce, and the loss of a job in 2015.” (Tr. 15-18.) AE C contains
IRS Account Transcripts for 2010-2011, 2013, and 2015-2017. Although those transcripts
do not match her recollection of filing dates, they show that her returns for the years in
question were filed in 2012, 2015, and 2017 through 2019, respectively. For three of those
years (2015-2017), she  established  payment plans that  she  has  satisfied.  These SOR
allegations have been resolved.
SOR ¶  1.c: Applicant is indebted to the federal government for unpaid taxes
of  $9,439  for 2016. Applicant believed this indebtedness has been cleared. She set up a
payment plan in 2019 and made all payments.  Those payments and any refunds were
applied  to  satisfy  this  debt.  Her  payments  were  $248  per  month.  (Tr.  24-25.)  Her
testimony is materially consistent with the record. AE C has the Account Transcript for
2016. She filed her return in January 2018 and began a payment plan in April 2018. Her
monthly  payments  were,  with  some  variations,  $246  per  month.  She  successfully
completed the plan in November 2022. AE G further documents those payments. This
SOR allegation has been resolved.
SOR ¶¶  1.d –  e: Failure  timely  to  file  state  income  tax  returns  for  2012  through
2015. In her Answer, Applicant admitted these returns were not timely filed but they were
filed and any amounts due were paid. They were belatedly filed, however, in 2019 due to
the “chaos in [her] life.” She does not owe any taxes for 2012 or 2013. (Tr. 26.)  AE E are
certified copies of her state tax returns for 2012 through 2015. Those returns, however,
were filed in 2014, 2015, undated, and 2019, respectively. Those returns show no taxes
due for the four years at issue, only modest refunds. These SOR allegations have been
resolved.
SOR  ¶   1.f:   Applicant   is   indebted  to   the   state  for  a   tax   lien  against  her  in
December 2013  for $19,419. In April 2017, Applicant and her employer received a Notice
of Income Tax Wage Lien for $30,472 from the state. (AE A.) She recalled that the tax
years in question were 2001 through 2006, and 2009. There was a tax lien, because her
ex-husband also had a business and, and unbeknownst to her, failed to take out taxes
for  that  business.  The  lien  was  “rectified  with  the  garnishment  [the  lien].”  AE  B  is  a
document confirming that the tax lien was released on April 23, 2018. All of her state tax
returns after 2015 have been filed timely, and there have been no tax debts since then.
(Tr. 30-34.) AE H is a screen shot of a March 15, 2023 state judgment and lien search
and shows no current judgments or liens filed against her. This SOR allegation has been
resolved.
Current finances: Applicant currently makes $123,000 per year. Her net monthly
remainder is between $400 and $500. Some of her monthly remainder goes to savings,
and ten percent goes to her church. She  underwent  free financial counseling online in
2019. In 2023, she took her mother on a vacation for her 80th  birthday. That cost about
$2,100. She has  taken  no other vacations. She  has  one  car, a  2015 model that  costs
$350 per month. She has three checking accounts, one with a $500 balance, another with
$1,500, and a business account with $50. Her savings account has about $2,000. She
has three retirement accounts, a 401k with $58,000, another 401k with $19,000, and a
Roth IRA with $7,000. She pays off her credit cards regularly and has no unpaid or unfiled
taxes. (Tr. 40-45.)
Law and Policies
It  is  well  established  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.  As  the
Supreme  Court  held,  “the  clearly  consistent  standard
that  security
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.” Department of the Navy
v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).
indicates
When  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability
for  a  security  clearance,  an
administrative  judge  must  consider  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  These  guidelines  are
flexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the
whole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a
decision.  The  protection  of  the  national  security  is  the  paramount  consideration.  AG  ¶
¶2(b)  requires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  national
security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.”
Under  Directive  ¶   E3.1.14,   the   Government   must  present  evidence   to   establish
controverted  facts alleged  in  the  SOR. Under Directive ¶  E3.1.15,  then  the  applicant  is
responsible  for presenting  “witnesses and  other evidence  to  rebut,  explain, extenuate, or
mitigate  facts admitted  by applicant or proven  by Department Counsel . . . .” The  applicant
has the  ultimate  burden of persuasion in seeking a  favorable security decision.
