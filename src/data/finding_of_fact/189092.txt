Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.f,  with  explanations.  His  admissions  are
incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings and the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 37 years old. He was married from 2011-2014, when he and his wife
divorced. They have an 11-year-old daughter, and he also has a 6-year-old son with his
current  cohabitant.  Applicant  has  a  high  school  diploma.  He  joined  the  Navy  in  2007
and  was  discharged  honorably  in  January  2016.  He  was  in  the  Navy  Reserve  until
2019.  He  was  a  quartermaster  in  the  Navy  and  held  a  clearance,  though  he  does  not
hold  one  currently.  (Tr.  12,  32,  33,  52;  GE  1)  Post-hearing  evidence  indicates  he
receives a $1,700 monthly benefit from the VA. (AE T)
Applicant  explained  that  when  he  was  in  the  Navy,  he  consulted  a  psychiatrist
and  was  advised  to  leave  the  Navy.  He  left  the  Navy  in  2016.  This  led  to  economic
hardship.  He  was  a  full-time  student  with  a  growing  family,  and  he  had  difficulty
maintaining  employment.  He  was  also  in  the  Navy  Reserve.  He  worked  for  several
months in 2016 and 2017 for  a large retailer while pursuing his degree. He earned an
associate degree at a community college and then earned his bachelor’s degree in May
2019. (Tr. 45-46; GE 1, GE 2)
Applicant’s  finances   improved   when   he   joined   the   defense   industry   in  software
development. He began  with  contractor C in May 2019. He  had  a  starting  annual salary
of  $105,000,  and   then   increased   to   $107,000.  He  remained   there  until   moving   to
contractor H, his  current  employer, in  October 2020,  with  a  $115,000  starting  salary.  In
December 2022, his salary increased  from  $120,000  to  $155,000.  (Tr. 27-31, 36-37, 42-
44; GE  1)
Applicant  disclosed  on  his  SCA  that  he  had  been  ordered  to  pay  a  12-month
child  support  arrearage  of  $1,060  a  month,  which  was  being  taken  out  of  his  pay.  He
also reported some past-due car payments. (GE 1, GE 2)
The  original  SOR  alleges  $28,742  in  delinquent  debts.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.f)  The
debts  are  established  by  Applicant’s  admissions  and  by  credit  reports  in  the  record,
from January 2019, January 2020, and April 2022. (Answer; GE 3-5)
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  that  Applicant  owes  $24,347  in  past-due  child  support  to  a
state enforcement agency. He testified that when he left the Navy, he was to pay about
$1,100 a month in child support. He thought his monthly requirement would decrease to
$1,000 when he left the  Navy but  initially  it did  not. A judge  later reduced the monthly
amount to $800, but he could not make those payments when he was unemployed. (Tr.
33-34)
It was not until 2019, when Applicant began working in the defense industry that
he could make consistent child support payments. Since June 2019, he has paid $860 a
month (of which $60 is payment for arrearages). In December 2019, he attempted to get
payments reduced in family court because his daughter was no longer in daycare. The
COVID shutdown happened a few months later, and he stopped contesting the amount.
He  recognizes  that  he  is  to  notify  the  court  of  salary  increases,  as  his  child  support
amount  may  be  affected  (up  to  25%  of  his  salary),  but  he  has  not  done  this  since
December 2020. His ex-wife has also been fully employed since October 2016, he says.
(Tr. 34, 35, 37-40, 49-52, 66)
Applicant  provided  documentation  from  the  state  that  he  made  $860  monthly
payments  during  2020,  2021,  and  2022.  As  of  March  2022,  he  was  current,  owing
$21,350. (AE A, AE B) After the hearing, he attempted to provide all his paystubs since
2020  to  reflect  this  but  they  were  password-protected  and  could  not  be  opened  and
printed.  He also  was unable  to  get  a  letter from  the  state  verifying what  he owes.  (Tr.
25-26, 39-40, 57; AE K, AE U) He indicated in post-hearing e-mails that the has been
making child support payments since 2020 to the present and now owes $19,830. (AE
H, AE I, AE U) This account is being resolved.
The  remaining  SOR  debts  were  incurred  when  Applicant  was  struggling
financially. He addressed most of them shortly before the hearing. (Tr. 41, 57-60)
SOR ¶  1.b  ($1,854) is a debt placed for collection by an old landlord. The debt is
paid and resolved. (Tr. 57; AE D, AE L)
SOR ¶  1.c  ($1,471) is a debt placed for collection by a phone company. The debt
was settled for 50% and resolved. (Tr. 41, 57-58; AE C, AE M)
SOR  ¶¶   1.d   ($798)  and  1.e  ($308)  are  medical  debts  placed  in  collection  by  a
veterinary clinic. The debts are paid and resolved. (Tr. 41-42, 59-60; AE F, AE G)
SOR ¶  1.f  ($164) is a medical debt in collection. There is no documentation in the
record  showing  that  it  is  resolved,  but  Applicant  intends  to  pay  it  and  can  afford  to  so
without difficulty. (Tr. 60)
Applicant financed his education  with  about  $20,000  in federal student loans. He
is aware  that they are in forbearance  status due  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic, but this is
soon to  end, and when it does, he plans to  pay $200 a  month towards his loans. (Tr. 45-
47, 67)  This is reflected on his monthly budget. (AE T)
Applicant acknowledged during his hearing that his federal and state income tax
returns remained unfiled for tax years (TY) 2019 and 2020. The SOR was amended to
reflect this. (SOR ¶ 1.g) He acknowledged  that he did not have a good reason  for not
filing beyond the COVID pandemic. He said he is disorganized and has procrastinated.
(Tr. 62-65)
Applicant  filed  his  2019  federal  and  state  tax  returns  (AE  R,  AE  S)  and  2020
federal and state returns (AE O, AE Q) after the hearing. He said he was due a refund
of  $3,499  for  2019  (federal  and  state  combined)  and  owed  $81  for  2020  (federal  and
state combined). (AE H (e-mail of Mar. 20, 2023))
Applicant  also  acknowledged  during  his  hearing  that  he  owed  about  $3,500  in
past-due  federal  income  taxes  to  the  IRS,  and  the  SOR  was  amended  to  reflect  this.
(Tr. 62, 65) (SOR ¶ 1.h) This tax debt concerns tax years 2016 and 2021, according to
his payment agreement. (AE J) After the hearing, he provided evidence that he is now
on a payment plan with the IRS to address his federal tax debt. He is to pay $140 per
month  for  the  next  five  years.  (AE  H,  AE  J,  AE  P)  This  suggests  that  he  owes  about
$8,400 in past-due federal income taxes. ($140 per month X 12 months a year = $1,680
annually, X 5 years = $8,400). On March 15, 2023, Applicant made two $100 payments
towards his federal tax debt for TYs 2016 and 2021. (AE J, AE N)
Applicant’s  ex-wife  has  full custody  of  his daughter,  and  he  has  visitation  rights
and some court-ordered custody over the summer and winter school breaks. (Tr. 47-49)
His cohabitant works full time. She and Applicant share household expenses. He owns
the  home,  purchased  in  May  2021.  They  own  separate  cars  and  pay  for  them
separately. Their son often stays with his grandparents, and Applicant provides financial
support. (Tr. 52-54)
An  April  2022  credit  report  shows  the  collection  debt  at  SOR  ¶  1.b,  which  has
been paid, and a $202 debt in collection to a cable company, also paid. (AE E) All other
accounts  are  listed  as  “pays  as  agreed.”  Applicant  had  a  $611,000  balance  on  his
$620,000  mortgage.  The  child  support  account  is  not  listed  on  the  April  2022  CBR.
(Item 3)
Applicant and his girlfriend will soon visit a financial counselor to put  together a
budget and improve their savings and finances. They have not done this previously. He
has 6% of his pay taken out for a 401(k) retirement plan. (Tr. 55-56) He said that all of
his household accounts are current. He has one credit card. (Tr. 61)
A  post-hearing  exhibit  details  Applicant’s  monthly  expenses  and  income.  He
earns  $9,567  after  taxes.  He  also  receives  a  $1,700  monthly  benefit  from  the  VA.  His
expenses  include  his  mortgage,  car  payment,  car  loan,  another  loan,  a  credit  card,
standard household expenses, as well as $860 in child support, a $140 payment to the
IRS, $200 for his student loan, and $300 into an emergency fund. His monthly budgeted
expenses total about $8,950. He estimates a monthly remainder of $2,313. (AE T)
