In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b,
1.c, 1.m, and 1.n. He denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.d through 1.l. His admissions
are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a   44-year-old  systems   engineer  employed   by  defense   contractors
since  October 2015. He  served  on  active  duty  in the  U.S. Navy  from  May 2000  to  October
2010   and   received   an   honorable   discharge.   He  has  held   a   security  clearance   since
September  2007.  He   received   an   associate   degree   in   October  2008   and   a   bachelor’s
degree  in June  2012. He  married  in July 2002, divorced  in November 2004, married  again
in August  2005,  and  divorced  in  2009.  He  has  three  children,  ages  19,  11, and  3.  (Tr. 26-
27)
After Applicant was discharged from the Navy, he worked for a federal contractor
from November 2010 to January 2012. He was laid off when his employer’s contract was
cancelled,  and  he  was  unemployed  from  January  to  May  2012.  He  worked  for  a  non-
federal employer from May 2012 to August 2013. He worked for a federal contractor from
August  2013  to  April  2015,  when  his  employer’s  contract  ended.  He  was  unemployed
from May to September 2015.
Applicant’s  income  for  tax  year  2014  was  about  $76,000.  His  income  for  2015
dropped  to  about  $37,700.  For  tax  years  2016  and  2017,  his  income  ranged  between
$65,000 and $75,000.
Between March 5, 2013 and August 31, 2014, Applicant fell behind on his child-
support payments. In August 2016, he was court-ordered to begin paying child support of
$837 per month plus $205 per month toward an arrearage of $6,051. (AX B)
The SOR alleges 14 delinquent debts totaling about $29,392, which are reflected
in credit reports from April 2020, September 2019, April 2018, July 2016, and September
2006. The evidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below.
SOR  ¶   1.a:  home   mortgage   foreclosure   in   2016. Applicant  lived in  this home
from May 2009 until May 2015, when he became unemployed and moved to another state
to seek employment. He rented the house to a friend while he was seeking employment.
In August 2016, he was notified by his mortgage lender that he was two months past due
on his mortgage payments. (AX C) He applied for a refinancing of the loan, and the lender
refused to accept payments while the application was pending. He held the rental income
in  a  bank  account,  awaiting  a  decision  on  his  application  for  refinancing.  (Tr.  41)  The
application for refinancing was denied. Foreclosure was initiated in 2015, and the house
was sold in April 2016. (AX A) There is no evidence that Applicant received any proceeds
from the foreclosure sale, nor is there any evidence of a deficiency after the foreclosure
sale. (Tr. 42-47; GX 6 at 7)
SOR ¶  1.b: loan  for motorcycle  charged  off for $15,393. Applicant purchased a
motorcycle in April 2013 and financed the purchase with a loan of $15,840. (GX 6 at 3)
He was unable to make the payments when he became unemployed.  He submitted no
evidence of contacts with the lender or efforts to avoid defaulting on the loan. The loan
was  charged off  in  October 2014.  (Tr. 47-49;  GX 5  at 2)  Applicant testified  that  it was
impossible to deal with the original lender after it was charged off, because they had no
record of the debt. He submitted no evidence that he disputed the motorcycle debt with
the credit-reporting agencies. It is not resolved.
SOR ¶  1.c: credit card charged off for $3,331. This account was opened in April
2012 and charged off in August 2013. The credit reports state, “Consumer disputes after
resolution,” indicating that he persisted in a dispute after it was resolved against him. (GX
4 at 2; GX 5 at 2) He did not submit any evidence of the basis for the dispute. The debt
is not resolved.
SOR ¶¶  1.d-1.h: student  loans  placed for collection of  $2,057;  $1,831;  $1,596;
Applicant obtained these student loans to attend a technical college.
$1,552;  and $817.
(Tr.  57-58)  They  were  assigned  to  the  government  for  collection  on  various  dates  in
December 2007, September 2008, and October 2008. (GX 4 at 2) During an interview
with a security investigator in November 2017 and at the hearing, Applicant stated that
his  education  was  covered  by  the  GI  Bill and  that  no  student  loans  should  have  been
opened. (GX 2 at 10; Tr. 59) I have taken administrative notice that federal student loans
that  students  received  to  attend  the  technical  college  between  January  2005  and
September 2016 were forgiven by the Department of Education because of widespread
fraud by the technical college. See www.ed.gov/news/press-releases, August 16, 2022.
(Hearing Exhibit II) All the delinquent federal student loans reflected in the GX 3, the most
recent credit report in the record, were initiated in 2007 and 2008, while Applicant was
attending the technical college.
SOR  ¶   1.i:  delinquent  medical  debt   for   $327.   This  debt  is  reflected  in  credit
reports from April 2020 (GX 3) and September 2019 (GX 4). The debt became delinquent
in  August  2017.  Applicant  denied  this  debt  in  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  stating  it  was
incurred by his twin brother. Applicant’s  first  name  and  his brother’s first name  are  the
same  except  for  one  letter.  (Tr.  62-63)  However,  at  the  hearing,  he  testified  that  he
believed  the  debt  was  paid  from  his health savings  account.  (Tr. 62)  He  submitted  an
account statement reflecting that his health account statement had a balance of $4,903
in February 2023, but the statement did not reflect any transactions related to this medical
debt. (AX G) It is not resolved.
SOR ¶  1.j: telecommunications  account  placed  for collection of $847. At the
hearing, Applicant testified that he disputed this debt because it was his  twin brother’s
debt. The debt is reflected in the credit reports from July 2016 (GX 6) and April 2018 (GX
5), but not in the credit reports from September 2019 (GX 4) and April 2020 (GX 3). The
debt is too recent to have aged off the credit reports under the Fair Credit Reporting Act,
which suggests that the dispute was resolved in his favor.
SOR  ¶¶   1.k   and  1.l:  two  telecommunications  accounts   with  the   same
provider, placed for collection of  $454  and $196.
Applicant denied these debts in his
answer to the SOR. He claimed that one of the debts probably belonged to his twin brother
and the other debt was paid in full. At the hearing, he testified that he did not recognize
these  debts  and  could  not  remember  if  he  disputed  them.  (Tr.  65)  He  provided  no
documentary evidence that they were resolved.
SOR  ¶   1.m:  medical  debt   referred for  collection of   $515.  Applicant  admitted
this debt in his answer to the SOR. At the hearing, he claimed that he paid it. (Tr. 65) He
provided no documentary evidence to support his claim.
SOR ¶  1.n: debt  placed for collection of  $476. Applicant admitted this debt in
his answer to the SOR, but he testified at the hearing that he did not recognize it. (Tr. 66)
He provided no evidence of payments, payment agreements, or other resolution of the
debt.
