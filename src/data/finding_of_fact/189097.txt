Applicant admitted all the allegations in the amended SOR. Applicant’s admissions
are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 37 years old. She attended college from 2015 to 2017 but did not earn
a  degree.  She  has  two  children,  ages  16  and  6.  She  receives  $480  monthly  in  child
support  for  her  younger  child  and  no  support  for  the  other  child.  She  has  worked  for
federal contractors since 2010, except from October 2017 to October 2018 when she did
not work because she stayed home with her younger child.  She was supported by her
boyfriend  during  this  time  and  lived  with  her  sister.  She  explained  that  she  was
uncomfortable sending her child to daycare because he initially had some medical needs
but admitted later this was her choice. She has worked for her present employer since
October 2018. She also had a part-time job working three days a week, along with her
full-time job in 2021, but not 2022. At the time of her hearing, she did not have a second
job. Post-hearing, she stated that she was hired for a second job and was now earning
from the two jobs approximately $129,000 annually. (Tr. 15- 21, 65; GE 9; AE A, L)
Applicant began experiencing financial difficulties after the birth of her second child
and when she was not working. She used credit cards to supplement her income. Also,
during  a  period  of  time,  she  was  the  only  one  working  when  her  boyfriend  was
unemployed. She now lives with her sister and they share expenses.  She completed a
security  clearance  application  in  February  2017  and  disclosed  some  of  her delinquent
debts. She was interviewed by a government investigator in May 2019 and acknowledged
she had delinquent debts. She was unable to maintain her home and pay her bills so she
began using credit cards. Some of them became delinquent. She told the investigator that
she  had  not  made  payment  arrangements  to  satisfy  the  debts.  She  was  pursuing  a
second job and intended to satisfy the debts once she did. (Tr. 19-21; GE 9)
SOR  ¶¶  1.c  through  1.f  allege  Applicant  has  approximately  $21,585  in  student
loans that became delinquent sometime after 2017, when she stopped attending college.
She explained that she planned on going back to college, so she did not pay them. She
testified she now does not intend to resume college. She said that in 2021 she made one
payment of $50. She has applied for a student loan forgiveness program. She intends to
repay the student loans in the future when she has the resources. Post-hearing, Applicant
provided  a  document  from  the  Department  of  Education’s  (DOE)  Default  Resolution
Group showing her payment history. It showed that, on the day of hearing, she made a
payment of $587. One other payment was reflected as a refund and Treasury offset in
March  2020  for  $7,152.  She  also  provided  a  copy  of  her  bank  statement  showing  a
payment  made  on  April  12,  2023,  for  $587  to  DOE.  She  wrote  on  the  statement  that
payments of $500 will resume each month and she did not have a payment plan due to
the pause in the program. (Tr. 31-34, 63-64; AE B, H)
The SOR alleges four delinquent debts to the same credit card company that are
in collection. Applicant testified that she was aware she owed two of the credit card debts
but was unfamiliar with the other two.  She was confused about the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a
($4,127) but said it was not paid. A judgment was entered for this debt in February 2018.
Post-hearing, Applicant provided a payment agreement regarding the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a,
which stated that Applicant would pay $1,000 on April 24, 2023, and then make monthly
payments beginning in May 2023 of $188. It appears Applicant made the first payment.
(Tr. 23-28 34-35; GE 7; AE F)
Post-hearing,  Applicant  provided  documents  from  the  collection  company  that
corroborates the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b ($208) and 1.k ($486) are for the same account,
and it was paid from January to May 2022. She provided another document to show in
January  through  March  2022  she  made  three  monthly  payments  to  satisfy  the  debt  in
SOR ¶ 1.g ($413). These debts are resolved. (Tr. 29-31, 34-35, 37; GE 2 - 5; AE C, D, E)
A judgment was entered in December 2017 for the credit card debt in SOR ¶ 1.i
($3,815)  for  $4,649.  Applicant  complied  with  a  settlement  agreement  and  had  a  final
payment due in May 2023. Her April 2020 credit report reflects she defaulted on the debt
in June 2016. The debt is being resolved. (Tr. 36-37; GE 3, 6; AE G)
The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.h (credit card $1,113) and 1.j ($4,944) became delinquent
in approximately 2016. Applicant testified that she intends to pay these debts when she
completes her payments with the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.i. Post-hearing, Applicant provided
a copy of her bank statement showing a payment of $700 was paid to the creditor in SOR
¶ 1.h on April 12, 2023. She wrote on the statement that this debt was paid off on  that
date. She did not provide evidence that the creditor agreed to settle the debt and that the
debt was settled for less than the full amount. She also provided a copy of a $500 money
order from April 16, 2023, paid to the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.j. She said the creditor does not
have payment plans on accounts in collection and the current balance owed is $5,704.
(Tr. 38; GE 3; AE H, I)
Applicant testified that when she moved in 2018, she lost track of the debt in SOR
¶ 1.l (communications services $1,459). Post-hearing, she stated that she could not find
the collection company holding the account. She was continuing her pursuit. (Tr. 39-40;
AE A)
Applicant   said  the   debt  in  SOR   ¶  1.m   was  her  ex-boyfriend’s  responsibility,   but
admitted   it  was  held   jointly  (alarm   system   $1,453).   Post-hearing,  she   provided   a   letter
showing   the   debt  was   settled   on   April  24,  2023,  for  $1,000.  Applicant  admitted   being
responsible  for the  medical debts in SOR  ¶¶  1.n  (medical debt $732)  and  1.o  (medical
debt  $243).  She   said   she   has  contacted   the   hospital  where  she   believes   the   debts
originated  but is having  difficulty finding  the  actual bill. None  of these  debts are resolved,
and no documentation  was provided  to show Applicant disputed  any of them. (Tr. 40-41-
43; GE 1, AE J)
Applicant has not had any financial counseling or education. She has a budget but
lives paycheck to paycheck. She testified that recently she received an $10,000 income
tax refund, she used about $2,000 to pay some debts, and she keeps the remainder as
an emergency fund. She said she has cut her expenses. (Tr. 43-45)
Applicant recently had a delinquent medical debt in collection because she had to
go to the hospital. Her children receive free medical care through the state, but she opted
not  to  take  medical  benefits  through  her  employer  in  exchange  for  an  increase  in  her
hourly wage. She paid the delinquent debt in April 2023. She also provided a document
to show she paid a medical bill for an October 2021 hospital visit that is reported on her
March 2023 credit report but was not alleged in the SOR. These debts are not alleged in
the SOR. (Tr. 45-46; GE 5; AE K)
Applicant  and  her  sister  live  together  and  share  expenses.  Applicant  holds  the
mortgage  on  the  house  where her parents  live.  It is in  her name. Her  parents  pay  the
monthly mortgage payment and all the associated expenses. She understands if they fail
to do so she is responsible for the mortgage. She does not provide financial  support to
her parents or anyone other than her children. (Tr. 48-53)
In 2020, Applicant purchased a new vehicle for $23,000. She traded the car in July
2021 because its exhaust system was damaged, and she purchased a new 2022 vehicle.
Her car payments were $700 a month. In February 2023, she traded in her 2022 vehicle
because she hit a pothole and damaged the vehicle. She received approximately $20,000
for the trade-in value of the 2022 car. She financed $68,000 to purchase a 2023 electric
vehicle.  Her  monthly  car  payments  are  now  $1,300  for  72  months.  Her  commuting
distance to work and to pick up her children are each about 12 miles away. (Tr. 53-62,
67-68)
Applicant  attributed  her financial  issues to  the  time  she took off from  work from
October 2017 to October 2018 to be home with her child, and then she chose not to return
to work. She stopped paying some of her bills. She testified that she always planned to
pay her debts but can only do so one at a time. (Tr. 66)
The debts alleged in the SOR are corroborated by Applicant’s admissions, court
documents of judgments, credit reports from March 2019, April 2020, February 2022, and
March  2023.  Some  of  the  older  debts  are  not  on  her  most  recent  credit  report.  Any
derogatory  information  that  was  not  alleged  in  the  SOR  will  not  be  considered  for
disqualifying purposes, but may be considered in the application of mitigating conditions,
in making a credibility determination, and in a whole-person analysis. (GE 1 - 9)
