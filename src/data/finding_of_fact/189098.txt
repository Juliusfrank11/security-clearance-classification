The  SOR  contains  two  allegations  pertaining  to  delinquent  federal  and  state
taxes. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b). Applicant denied both allegations. SOR ¶ 1.c alleges that
he  did  not  file  federal  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2018  and  2019.  He  admitted  this
allegation.  SOR  ¶¶  1.d  and  1.e  allege  delinquent  credit-card  accounts.  Applicant
admitted SOR ¶ 1.d, but denied SOR ¶ 1.e, indicating that the account was settled.
Applicant is 47 years old and single. He was married from 1996 to April 2008,
when he divorced. He has no children. He has owned his residence since 2015. He took
college courses at several academic locations between 2000 and 2017, but received no
degree.  He  recently  received  a  bachelor’s  degree  from  a  local  university  and  is  five
credits  short  of  attaining  a  master’s  degree  in  business  administration.  (GE  1  at  9-16,
24, 32-40, 44; Tr. 7-8, 36, 38)
Applicant has been working for a defense contractor at his current deputy-lead
position  since  June  2021  and  earns  about  $130,000  annually  ($120,000  salary  plus  a
$10,000 military pension). In his previous job from 2020 to June 2021, in a similar task-
lead  position,  he  also  earned  about  $130,000  a  year.  From  June  2015  to  2020,
Applicant  earned  about  $80,000,  then  $90,000  a  year,  as  a  task  lead.  Apparently,  his
temporary move to another state in 2020 or 2021 to reduce his chances of catching the
COVID  virus  did  not  interrupt  his  consistent  employment  since  2015.  Applicant  was
honorably discharged from the United States Navy (USN) in March 2015, after 20 years
of service. He has held a security clearance since 1995. (GE 1 at 21; Tr. 8-11, 41-43)
Applicant  was  asked  several  times  to  explain  the  reasons  for  his  financial
problems. In his September 2019 PSI, he initially claimed that he forgot to file his 2018
federal  and  state  tax  returns.  Then  he  claimed  he  was  waiting  on  his  mortgage
company to provide a document so that he could file the returns. He informed the OPM
investigator that he intended to file the missing returns in September 2019. That did not
happen.  He  admitted  procrastination  for  not  filing  his  tax  returns.  He  also  told  the
investigator  that  he  owed  $6,000  in  federal  taxes  for  2016,  but  he  predicted  that  the
Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  would  keep  his  2018  refund  to  pay  2016  delinquent
taxes. He claimed the refund he received for federal tax year 2019 will be applied to his
2015 tax bill. Documented information related to his 2019 federal tax return appears in
AE D. (GE 2 at 9-11; Tr. 50-51; AE D)
Applicant  began  paying  on  the  2015  federal  tax  debt  in  2020.  (SOR  ¶  1.a)
When asked why he waited five years to establish a repayment plan, he replied that he
did not have an answer. There was no reason why he could not have initiated the plan
sooner. Applicant’s federal tax payment-plan documentation indicates that his last $300
payment  was  received  by  the  IRS  on  January  1,  2023.  The  remaining  balance  was
$1,014, with the next payment due on February 1, 2023. (GE 2 at 6-7; Tr. 45-48; AE D)
For the delinquent state taxes (SOR ¶ 1.b), which have been delinquent since
tax year 2015, Applicant made two payments totaling $5,926, on January 24, 2023. He
has no remaining tax liability with the state. He provided the same reason for the delay
in  not  paying  his  state  taxes  as  he  expressed  for  the  delinquent  federal  taxes.  He
conceded that when he moved into his house in December 2015, he did not understand
that  his  mortgage  payments  would  fluctuate  because  no  one  fully  explained  the
disadvantages of his mortgage. (GE 2 at 6-7; Tr. 45-48; AE E)
SOR  ¶  1.c  –Applicant  provided  answers  to  interrogatories  indicating  that  he
filed  his  2018  and  2019  federal  tax  returns  on  December  8,  2020.  The  account
transcript for tax year 2018 indicates that the 2018 return was filed on March 21, 2022.
Applicant provided no explanation for the discrepancy between the dates in his answers
to interrogatories (GE 2 at 6-7) or testimony and the 2018 account transcript. (AE C)
The   tax  account  transcript  for  tax  year  2019   (AE  D)  shows   that   no   tax  return
was  filed.   Instead,   Applicant  submitted   a  2019   Form   W-2  wage   and   tax  statement,   a
Form  1098  mortgage  interest  statement,  a Form  1098-T information, and  a  Form  1098-
R Distributions from  pensions. A portion  of  a  federal tax  return  for tax  year 2019, time-
stamped  February 8, 2023, was included in  Applicant’s post-hearing submission. (AE E)
Regarding  the  SOR ¶  1.d  credit-card account, Applicant used  the  credit card to
purchase   furniture.   He   stopped   making   payments  on   the   account   in  January   2017,  as
he  could   no   longer  afford  the   payments.   The  creditor  extended   a   settlement  offer  of
$8,900,  which  Applicant was  unable to  accept because  he  did not  have  the  money.  His
last  contact with  the  creditor  was in  2022.  (GE  2  at 9-10; GE  2  at  4; GE  6  at 5;  Tr. 52-
53)  The account is still unresolved.
Applicant  stopped  paying  on  the  SOR  ¶  1.e  account  in  January  2017  for  the
same  reason  he  gave  for  not  paying  the  SOR  ¶  1.d  account.  He  stated  that  he  was
using his credit cards too much and was living beyond his means. He indicated that he
settled  the  account  in  2021  for  $4,000.  Applicant’s  documentation  reflects  that  the
account was “settled in full,” though no payment date is posted in the exhibit. (GE 2 at
10; AE A)
In  the  financial  record  section  of  his  July  2019  e-QIP,  Applicant  indicated  he
had  not  filed  his  federal  tax  returns  for  tax  year  2018,  and  he  was  working  with  an
accountant  to  resolve  the  issue.  He  disclosed  the  SOR  ¶¶  1.d  and  1.e  accounts  as
being in a delinquent status. He explained that he was receiving advice from an attorney
about  his  financial  problems.  Applicant  stated  that  he  and  the  attorney  were  debating
whether to file a Chapter 13 or Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. No action was taken as of
the date  of  e-QIP. It  is difficult to  correlate the  discussions  that Applicant had with  the
attorney concerning bankruptcy to fundamental elements of financial counseling. (GE 1
at 45-50)
In 2015 and 2016, Applicant took two one-to-five-day trips to Central America.
(GE  1  at  37-40;  Tr.  59)  In  May  2022,  Applicant  took  a  seven-day  trip  to  Europe  for
vacation.  The  excursion  cost  a  total  of  $1,100,  including  air  fare.  Applicant’s  current
discretionary monthly remainder after payment of his expenses is between  $2,300 and
$2,500. (Tr. 60-61)
