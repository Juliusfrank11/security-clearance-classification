Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations  except  ¶  2.a.  His  admissions  are
incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings,
testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 46 years old. He served in the National Guard from December 2008
to  January  2017.  He  deployed  to  Afghanistan  for  12  months  in  2011  and  2012.  He
received  an  honorable  discharge.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2017.  He  is  not
married.  He  has  one  child.  Applicant  testified  he  has  been  steadily  employed  with  no
periods of unemployment. He has worked for his current employer since September 2018.
He stated he held a secret security clearance from 2009 and it was upgraded to a  top
secret clearance in 2018. (Tr. 8, 17-20, GE 1)
Applicant’s answer to the SOR; statements to government investigators; hearing
testimony; and credit reports from May 2019, April 2020, May 2020, and February 2022
corroborate the SOR allegations.
In  2015, while  serving  with  the  National Guard, Applicant was scheduled  to  deploy,
but  due   to   a  medical  disqualification,  he   was  unable.   He   was  paid   for  the   deployment
anyway.  In   August  2018,  Applicant   was   interviewed   by  a   government  investigator.  He
was confronted with the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a ($25,953)  owed to the federal government  for
repayment of  the  deployment pay  he  should not have  received.  He said he  was  advised
of the  overpayment  in  February 2016. He told  the  investigator that he  was working  two
jobs and  planned  to  make  payment arrangements  to  resolve  the  debt. He also  said he
did not have  any other  delinquent accounts and  his current  finances  were  good. (Tr. 22-
35;  GE 6)
In July 2020, Applicant was interviewed again by a government investigator. He
acknowledged  he  owed  the  debt  to  the  federal  government  for  the  overpayment  as
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a. He told the investigator that he was unable to make the payments
to  repay  the  debt.  He  said  he  was  making  more  money  and  was  going  to  look  for
additional  employment.  He  planned  to  contact  the  creditor  in  July  2020  and  make
payment arrangements. (GE 7)
Applicant  testified  that  after  he  received  the  overpayment,  his  first  sergeant
advised  him  that  he  would  have  to  repay  the  amount.  Applicant  said  he  did  not  know
about the overpayment until his first sergeant told him. He testified that the money was
deposited   into   an   account   he   did   not  check.  He  received   approximately  $25,953,  as
alleged.  He   did  not   contact  anyone   while   he   was   in  the   military  to   make   payment
arrangements.  He said  he  did  not  know who  to  contact.  When  he  was discharged  from
the  military, he  did  not  make  arrangements to  repay  the  amount owed. He testified  that
sometime  in 2020, he  received  a  letter in  the mail  from  the federal creditor telling  him  he
had  to  pay the  debt. He then  set up  an automatic payment of $500  a  month  to  repay the
debt. Applicant testified that he kept the  overpayment in  a  designated  account and could
pay  most of  the  debt.  He admitted  he  used  about $1,000  of the  money for his personal
expenses.   When   questioned   why   if  he   had   the   overpayment   money  in   his   personal
account,  he  said  he  did  not  have  it to  pay  it all back. He said he  did not know. He said he
currently had  about $12,500  of the  overpayment  in his account and  could pay  that  amount
immediately.  It  is unknown what  he  spent the  balance  of the  overpayment on, but it was
not readily available in  his account. I did not find  Applicant’s testimony credible. (Tr. 22-
35)
Post-hearing,  Applicant  provided  a  document  dated  April  5,  2022,  from  a  third-
party  collector  for  the  Department  of  the  Treasury.  It  reflected  an  agreement  with
Applicant from December 2020 to pay $494 a month. He provided proof that he has made
payments from May 2022 until March 2023. The balance owed in April 2022 was $22,162,
which  includes  penalties  and  costs.  On  April  14,  2023,  after  his  hearing,  he  made  a
$10,000 payment toward the debt. He did not provide evidence if he made any payments
in accordance with the agreement prior to May 2022. (AE A, B)
Applicant attended college full time from 2009 until he graduated in May 2017. He
used  his  military  educational  benefits  and  student  loans  to  fund  his  education.  His
defaulted student loans, alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b through 1.h and 1.j-1.l total approximately
$63,115.  In  July  2020  when  questioned  by  a  government  investigator,  Applicant
acknowledged all of his delinquent student loans and told the investigator that he planned
on contacting the creditor that day to discuss options for getting the debts out of collection
and paid. He testified that he never followed up on contacting the creditor. He said  that
the  creditor  never  contacted  him  about  repaying  the  debts,  so  he  did  not  make  any
payments. He said if he does not receive a bill, he does not know how to pay the debt.
He said he pays all of his expenses through automatic withdrawals. He said now that he
knows how to pay the debts, he will. (Tr. 36-38, 57-59; GE 2, 3 ,4 5, 7)
In July 2020, Applicant was confronted by the government investigator with a debt
owed  to  the  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  (VA).  (SOR  ¶  1.m  $1,488)  He  told  the
investigator this was a loan for education. He stopped attending class and received an
incomplete, which resulted in an overpayment to him. He said he  was paying the debt
through monthly installments, but then he had to start child support payments. He planned
to contact the VA in July 2020 to set up payment arrangements to pay the debt in full. He
testified that he did not make arrangements to pay this debt. (Tr. 42-44; GE 7)
SOR  ¶1.i  alleged  child  support  arrearages  of $4,283.  Applicant  testified  that  he
had  his  child  support  payments  automatically  withdrawn  from  his  paycheck.  When  he
changed jobs, he  was unaware  that  the automatic  payments  stopped. When he found
out, he began making cash payments for the child support to the mother. He stated he
does not owe any arrearages, and he is current on his child support. He provided a copy
of an online payment inquiry dated March 29, 2023. It states the non-custodial parent’s
order balances and specifically states that it is not an official document and may not be
complete regarding information about child support. It appears there is a balance owed
of $1,427. Applicant did not provide any specific information about the current balance
owed. (Tr. 39-42; AE E)
Applicant testified that he was unable to pay his debts because two years ago his
mother developed medical problems and he has been helping her financially. He gives
her about $200 a month to help pay for medication and also occasionally he helps with
other  unexpected  expenses.  He  bought  her  a  washer  and  dryer  that  cost  about  $600
about six months ago. (Tr. 21, 38, 48-50, 61)
Applicant testified that his annual income is approximately $70,000. He has about
$1,800 of expendable monthly income. He will no longer be required to pay child support
in June 2023, when his son reaches majority. Applicant has approximately $11,500 in his
checking  and  savings  account.  He  works  as  a  driver  for  three  different  rideshare
companies and depending on how much he works he could make an additional $300 a
month. He testified that he intends to start paying all of his debts,  he  just needs more
time. (Tr. 17, 21, 46-48-50; AE G)
Applicant  completed   a   security  clearance   application   (SCA)   in   March  2018.
Questions under Section  26,  regarding  his finances,  asked  if he  was  currently delinquent
on any Federal debt, and he responded “no.” He did not disclose  his debts  to the federal
government alleged  in SOR ¶ 1.a  for an  overpayment,  ¶¶  1.b  through  1.h  and  1.j through
1.l  for student loans, or  his VA  debt  in  ¶  1.m. Applicant’s explanation  was that he  did not
understand  the  question. He was  aware  since  February 2016  that  he  owed a  debt  to  the
federal government  for  his overpayment  made  for the  deployment he  did not  take. I did
not believe  he  misunderstood  that he  had  to  disclose  this debt.  I find  Applicant deliberately
failed  to  disclose  the  debt in SOR ¶ 1.a  owed  to  the  federal government.  (Tr. 45, 52-58;
GE 1)
It is unclear that since Applicant graduated from college in May 2017 if his student
loans would have been due to be paid or delinquent when he completed his SCA in March
2018. I have insufficient evidence to conclude he deliberately failed to disclose  that his
student  loans and  VA loan  (SOR ¶¶ 1.b  - 1.h  and 1.j  - 1.m)  were delinquent  when  he
completed his 2018 SCA.
Applicant completed another SCA in January 2020. Questions under Section 26,
regarding his finances, asked if he was currently delinquent on any Federal debt, and he
responded  “no.”  It  also  asked  if  in  the  last  seven  years  if  he  had  been  delinquent  on
alimony or child support. He responded “no.” Applicant testified that when he completed
the January 2020 SCA, he did not know it was an SCA. He believed it was an application
for some other job with his company. He also testified that he had completed SCAs in the
past. I did not find his testimony credible. Applicant did not disclose his debts owed to the
federal creditor alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a, which he had been aware of since 2016. In 2020,
he had not made payments on his student loans, and they were delinquent, and he did
not disclose any of  them or his VA  debt.  I find  he  intentionally  failed  to  disclose  these
debts were delinquent. (Tr. 45; GE 8)
The evidence supports that Applicant was paying the mother of his child directly
for  child  support  and  it  was  not  being  accounted  for  by  the  state.  I  find  he  did  not
intentionally fail to disclose his child support issue  on his January 2020 SCA. There is
insufficient  evidence  regarding  whether  he  was  aware  he  was  delinquent  on  his  child
support payments.
