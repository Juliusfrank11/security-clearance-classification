Applicant is a  43-year-old employee  of  a  government contractor.  He  has  worked
full  time  for his  government contractor  employer since  about  2020.  He also  has another
full-time   job   that  he   began   in   March  2023.   He   was  awarded   a   bachelor’s  degree   in
2004. He  has  never married  but has lived  with  a  cohabitant since  2011.  He  has  a  six-
year-old  daughter.   He   served   in  the   Army  National  Guard   from   January  2014   until
January  2020,   and   the   Army  Reserve   from   2020   until  February  2022,  earning   an
honorable  discharge   from   both.   The   DoD  Consolidated   Adjudications   Facility  (CAF)
awarded  him  eligibility for a secret clearance  in July  2020.  (Tr.  37-40;  GE  1-2; AE C)
In  the  SOR,  the  Government  alleged  that  Applicant  had  not  timely  filed  his
federal income tax returns for tax year (TY) 2012, 2015, 2016, 2018, and 2019, despite
being  required  to  do  so  (SOR  ¶  1.a).  The  Government  also  alleged  that  he  owed
approximately $5,421 in delinquent federal taxes for TY 2010, and that this federal tax
debt  remained  unpaid  until  about  2022  (SOR  ¶  1.b).  Finally,  the  Government  alleged
that  he  owed  approximately  $2,339  in  delinquent  federal  taxes  for  TY  2011,  and  that
this  federal  tax  debt  remained  unpaid  until  about  2021  (SOR  ¶  1.c).  In  his  Answer,
Applicant  admitted  the  SOR  allegations,  but  he  claimed  that  he  has  since  filed  all  the
relevant federal income tax returns and paid the relevant delinquent federal taxes. With
his Answer, he also provided a document from the IRS showing he had a zero balance
for TY 2018, 2019, and 2020. (SOR; Answer)
Applicant  failed  to  timely  file  his  federal  income  tax  returns  for  TY  2012,  2015,
2016,  2018,  and  2019,  despite  being  required  to  do  so.  He  claimed  that  he  filed  his
federal  income  tax  return  for  TY  2012  with  the  IRS  in  December  2020.  He  did  not
provide  an  IRS  account  transcript  to  corroborate  this  filing.  He  did  provide  documents
showing  that  he  received  a  refund  from  the  IRS  for  TY  2021.  He  would  not  have
received a refund if he had not filed his income tax return for TY 2012, so I find that he
has late filed his income tax return for TY 2012. He filed his federal income tax returns
for TY 2015 and 2016 in June 2018. He filed his federal income tax return for TY 2018
in August 2021. He filed his federal income tax return for TY 2019 in November 2020.
While  his  IRS  account  transcript  shows  he  filed  the  TY  2019  return  in  April  2022,  a
November  13,  2020  IRS  letter  reflects  that  he  filed  his  TY  2019  return  by  November
2020. (Tr.17-21, 23-32, 40-43, 46-47; Answer; GE 1-3; AE D)
Applicant  filed  his  federal  income  tax  return  for  TY  2020  in  October  2021.  He
claimed that he obtained a filing extension until October 2021 from the IRS for TY 2020,
but  he  provided  no  documentary  evidence  of  this  extension.  He  provided  a  document
from the IRS reflecting a universal extension to file returns for TY 2019 from April 2020
to July 2020, because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Any adverse information not alleged
in the SOR, such as Applicant’s failure to timely file his federal income tax return for TY
2020,  will  not  be  considered  for  disqualification  purposes;  however,  it  may  be
considered in assessing an applicant’s credibility; in evaluating an applicant’s evidence
of  extenuation,  mitigation,  or  changed  circumstances;  in  considering  whether  the
applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; and in applying the whole-person
concept. (ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017)). He timely filed his
federal income tax return for TY 2021 in March 2022. He timely filed his federal income
tax return for TY 2022 in March 2023. (Tr. 62-65; Answer; GE 1-3; AE D)
Applicant  owed  approximately  $5,421  in  delinquent  federal  taxes  for  TY  2010
until about March 2022, when he satisfied this debt through IRS refund intercepts from
other tax years. He owed approximately $2,339 in delinquent federal taxes for TY 2011
until about October 2021, when he satisfied this debt through IRS refund intercepts from
other tax years. He did not contact the IRS about voluntarily paying his 2010 and 2011
federal  tax  delinquencies  because  he  thought  the  refund  intercepts  were  a  sufficient
means of addressing these debts. (Tr. 17, 30-32, 63-64, 73-75; Answer; GE 1-3; AE D)
Applicant claimed that he owed taxes for TY 2010  and 2011 because he received
bad  advice  from  his tax preparer  (TP  A).  He  hired  TP  A  to  assist  him  to  prepare  and  file
his federal income  tax returns for TY 2010, 2011, and  2012  based  upon  a  referral from
a  friend  of  his  that  he  trusted.  With  respect to  his  federal  income  tax  return  for TY  2012,
he  assumed   TP  A   was  filing   his  return   because   he   had   provided   TP  A   the   necessary
paperwork,  but   he   learned   sometime   in   2013   that  TP   A   was  no   longer  in  business.
Despite   knowing   TP  A   was  out  of  business  sometime   in  2013,  he   claimed   he   did  not
realize   he   had   not  filed   his   2012   federal   income   tax   return   until  2020,  when   he
completed  the  interrogatories identified  as GE  2.  He  claimed  that  TP  A  told him  that he
could   claim   an   exemption   for a   training   course  that   the   IRS   later   determined   he   could
not  claim.  This improperly claimed  exemption  is what caused  him  to  owe taxes for TY
2010   and   2011.   He   claimed   that   he   did   not  learn   that   he   owed   the   IRS   money   for
delinquent  federal  taxes  for  TY  2010   and   2011   until  June   or  July   2012,  when   he
received   a   notice   from   the   IRS.   He  claimed   that  when   he   asked   TP  A   how to  pay   the
taxes  he  owed  the  IRS  for TY 2010  and  2011, TP A  told him  to  wait  until  the  IRS  offset
those  delinquencies  with  future  federal tax refunds.  (Tr. 17-21, 23-32,  41-43,  51-52,  76-
77; Answer; GE  1-3; AE C)
Applicant  also  claimed  that TP  A  told  him  that he  could file  his  federal income  tax
returns   every  other  year.   He  claimed   that   he   filed   his   income   tax  returns  late   based
upon  this advice.  He claimed  that he  later learned  that he  had  to  file  his  federal income
tax  return  annually,  and   pay  any  federal  taxes  owed   when   he   filed   the   return.   He
acknowledged  that he  filed  his federal  income  tax returns  annually prior to  TY 2012.  He
claimed  that  he  never had  any  federal tax issues  prior to  receiving  this advice  from  TP
A.  (Tr. 17-21, 23-32,  41-43,  51-52, 76-77; Answer; GE  1-3; AE C)
For TY 2013 and 2014, Applicant used a “chain” tax preparation company (TP B)
to assist him with filing those federal income tax returns. He filed his federal income tax
returns on time for those tax years, but his refunds were intercepted to partially satisfy
his 2010 and 2011 federal tax delinquencies.  He did not  seek advice  from  TP  B as  to
how  to  satisfy  his  2010  and  2011  tax  delinquencies  other  than  through  refund
intercepts, but he acknowledged that he should have. He  did not question TP B about
whether  it  is  acceptable  to  file  federal  income  tax  returns  every  other  year.  However,
given his annual income tax return filing for those consecutive years, he knew it was an
annual requirement. He claimed that he filed his federal income tax returns late for TY
2015 and 2016 because he was waiting to file to see if he could pay off his delinquent
taxes  prior  to  filing  those  returns.  There  is  no  evidence  showing  why  paying  off  his
federal tax delinquencies could cause him to fail to file subsequent income tax returns,
and  he  acknowledged  he  used  bad  judgment  in  following  this  course  of  action.  TP  B
offered to file his federal income tax returns for TY 2015 and 2016, but he did not use
TP B because their price increased. He did not consider filing his income tax returns on
his own,  and  he  did not  use  military  resources  that  were  available to  him.  He  claimed
that  his  mother  passed  away  in  2015,  and  dealing  with  his  grief  also  contributed  to
failure to comply with income tax return requirements.  (Tr. 17-21, 23-32, 52-61, 65-68,
77; Answer; GE 1-3; AE D)
Applicant  timely  filed  his  TY  2017  federal  income  tax  return,  using  another  tax
preparation  company  (TP  C).  He  also  used  TP  C  to  late  file  his  TY  2015  and  2016
federal income tax returns in 2018. He filed his TY 2018 return late because he claimed
he  had  a  work  obligation  that  interfered  with  his  doing  so.  TP  C  also  went  out  of
business, so it was not available to assist him with filing. He claimed without providing
corroborating documentation that he received an IRS extension for TY 2018, but he did
not  meet  the  extended  deadline.  He  ultimately  late  filed  his  income  tax  return  for  TY
2018  because  he  realized  he  might  not  be  able  to  obtain  a  security  clearance  with
outstanding tax obligations. He claimed that he now knows the importance of complying
with tax responsibilities, partly because it is part of his civic duty, and he will continue to
do so in the future. I observed Applicant while he testified and found him to be honest
and credible. (Tr. 17-21, 23-32, 52-61, 65-68, 77; Answer; GE 1-3; AE D)
Applicant  claimed  that  he  keeps  close  track  of  his  credit,  especially  as  his
personal  information  has  been  involved  in  data  leaks.  He  has  worked  with  a  police
detective in State A when he found out that his information was being used on the dark
web  and  has  availed  himself  of  credit  monitoring  services  offered  by  the  companies
whose  computer  information  systems  were  breached.  He  claimed  that  these  data
breaches  interfered  with  his  ability  to  timely file  his  federal  income  tax  returns,  but  he
provided no reasonable nexus between the two. Notwithstanding the debt contained in
SOR  ¶  1.d  that  the  Government  withdrew,  Applicant  has  one  other  account,  a  credit
card, that is not more than two payments past due. This credit-card debt is not alleged
in the SOR. (Tr. 33-37, 67-69, 72-74; GE 4)
