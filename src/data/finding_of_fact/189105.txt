Applicant admits the five debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.e, totaling $20,600.
The debts consist of four consumer debts and a small medical debt. His admissions are
incorporated into the findings of fact.
Applicant is 53 years old. He has worked as a security guard since 2009. He has
held security clearances for over a decade. (Tr. at 15-16 and GE-2 at 13.) He divorced in
2006 after seven years of  marriage and has two adult children. He married his current
spouse in 2018. His spouse is employed.
Applicant worked full time as a corrections officer from 1998 until 2013. He was
terminated  from  the  position  for  fraternization  with  an  inmate  by  providing  the  inmate
additional  food.  He  has  maintained  a  side  business  in  the  entertainment  and  events
industry since 2000. In 2012, he was required to obtain a business license, and he lists
2012 on his security clearance application as the year he started this business. After his
termination, his security guard company took him on full time. He relied primarily on his
security guard income during this five-year period. (Tr. at 49.) In 2018 and 2019 he worked
as an armed security officer. He has worked with a correctional facility since July 2019.
His income from working the two jobs was less than $100,000 annually. (Tr. at 40.)
Applicant  testified  his  side  business  required  him  to  use  credit  cards  to  obtain
equipment. He has spent about $20,000 over the years for equipment, and now must pay
“a lot of taxes, personal property taxes every year, based on all of that equipment” that
he owns. (Tr. at 101-102, 105.) Prior to COVID, he typically did 25 to 30 events and would
charge anywhere from $200 to $300 per event. Since COVID he has done approximately
10 to 15 events. He testified he spent more on the business than what he made. (Tr. at
107.)
Applicant moved in with his father after his 2006 divorce. His father did not charge
him rent, and he would  give his father money every month. The amount of support he
gave  his  father  “varied  between  anywhere  from  $100  to  $500.  . .  .”  (Tr.  at  86.)  He
remained in the house after his father passed away in 2017. (AE-Q.) He sold his father’s
house  in  2018  as  part  of  the  settlement  of  his  father’s  estate.  Prior  to  the  sale  of  his
father’s home, he bought a home in 2017. (AE-M.) He provided $7,858 in cash to close.
His monthly mortgage payment was estimated to be $1,326. (Tr. at 91-92 and AE-L.) His
new home also required repairs. (Tr. at 92 and AE-M.) He is the only person listed on the
mortgage  paperwork.  He  testified  that  he  and  his  wife  split  the  mortgage  on  the  new
home. (Tr. at 43.)
In his 2020 security clearance  interview, Applicant stated multiple times that his
financial issues started in 2013 and 2014 after his father passed away, when his father
actually passed away in 2017. He had no explanation for why he said his father’s death
was in 2013. (Tr. at 48 and GE-2 at 5.) He cited using his own credit card to do some
home repairs on the house for his father while his father was sick. (Tr. at 47, 60.)
Applicant provided evidence that in 2018 he engaged a law firm to assist him in
resolving  his debts.  On  the  intake  forms  for the  firm,  under  the  “Reason  for  Hardship”
section he marked “Company Reduced Hours” and “Other (Death in the family (Father)”
and completed a budget analysis. (AE-R at 6.) The law firm explained their debt resolution
strategy as a negotiation and settlement approach. He initialed the page that explained
the “debt resolution strategy” consisted of stopping payment to his creditors to allow the
law firm to negotiate and settle his debts from these saved funds. (AE-R at 10.) This action
was not discussed in his 2020 security clearance interview or raised during the hearing.
He engaged another law firm in May 2020 to help him resolve his debts and repair his
credit. (Tr. at 28, 51-52, GE-2 at 36, and AE-J.) He released the second law firm and has
been resolving the remaining debts on his own. (Tr. at 66.)
SOR  ¶   1.a:   past-due   account   referred  for  collection  for  $9,651.   Applicant
admitted he took a loan for about $11,000 at a 25.26 percent interest rate. (Tr. at 54.) He
could  not  state  when  he  made  his  last  payment.  (Tr.  at  56.)  He  ultimately  settled  the
account in August 2021 for $4,727, in ten payments from September 2021 through June
2022. (Tr. at 27, 56 and AE-H.) He cited other obligations, such as child support, for why
he stopped making payments on the loan. (Tr. at 57-58.) He did not mention child support
or alimony in his security clearance interview and raised it for the first time at the hearing.
(Tr. at 58.) In his post-hearing submission, he  provided  the  creditor’s letter dated June
28, 2022, stating the “account has been Settled in Full and closed.” (AE-R at 14.)
SOR ¶  1.b: past-due account  referred for collection for $5,935.  Applicant used
this credit card, when his father was living, for repairs to his father’s home in 2016. (Tr. at
60.)  The  credit  card  became  delinquent  in  2018.  (GE-4  and  Tr.  at  60.)  The  law  firm
contacted the creditor and as a result the creditor placed a block on the account. He had
to get the block released in order to settle the account. (Tr. 28-29 and 61.) In his post-
hearing  submission,  he  provided  a  letter  to  the  creditor  summarizing  his  $2,700
settlement agreement, that he had reached with the company’s agent. The letter stated:
“On April 11, 2023[,] I have agreed to make payments in the amount of  $112.50 every
28th of the month starting on April 28, 2023[,] for 24 months. No interest and no late fees.”
(AE-R at 18.)
SOR  ¶   1.c:  past-due   account   referred  for  collection  for  $3,639.  Applicant
incurred the debt from online purchases during COVID. (Tr. at 62.) In August 2021, he
settled the account in the amount of $1,970.76 by agreeing to a payment plan of $164.23
a  month.  (Tr.  at  62  and  AE-C.)  Applicant  Exhibit  E  shows  the  debt  was  resolved  on
September 2, 2022. (Tr. at 63.)
SOR  ¶   1.d:  past-due   account   referred   for  collection   for  $1,208.   Applicant
opened  the  account  in September 2015,  and it  first became  delinquent  2018.  He  took
action  to  resolve  the  debt  in  September  2020,  with  payments  of  $69.56  a  month.  He
defaulted  on  the  agreement  but  reestablished  a  payment  plan  to  pay  off  the  debt.
Applicant  Exhibit  D  shows  that  on  January  24,  2022,  he made  a  payment  of  $268.56,
which satisfied the account. (Tr. at 63, 64.)
SOR  ¶   1.e:  past-due  account   referred  for   collection  for  $166.   The  account
became delinquent in May 2020. Applicant provided Applicant Exhibit F showing he paid
the debt off on March 24, 2022. (Tr. at 29.)
As noted above, Applicant has resolved four of the five accounts, and has provided
evidence of an agreement to resolve the remaining debt. He has a plan to keep his debts
current.
Applicant  submitted  reference  letters,  promotion  emails,  and  certificates  of
accomplishment covering his career from 1997 through 2022.  Collectively, these items
describe  him  as  reliable,  trustworthy,  calm,  pleasant,  courteous,  conscientious,  family
oriented, and an asset to their respective organizations. (AE-N.)
