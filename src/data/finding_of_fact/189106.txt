In  her  SOR  answer,  Applicant  denied  all  the  allegations.  I  make  the  following
additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 37-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She has worked for
federal contractors since 2017. She served in the U.S. Air Force from 2004-2008. She
was medically discharged (honorably) from the Air Force a few months shy of completing
her enlistment. She received a disability rating from the Department of Veterans Affairs
(VA)  and  receives  a  monthly  pension  of  approximately  $825.  She  holds  a  bachelor’s
degree. She has been married and divorced twice. She has two children from her first
marriage, ages 14 and 13. She has custody of both children, and one has special needs.
She is currently engaged, and her fiancée has two special needs children. They all live in
the same household. (Tr.3 7, 18-19, 23, 27, 34-35; GE 1)
The  SOR  alleged  six  delinquent  accounts  (medical  debts  and  consumer  debts)
totaling approximately $75,900. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a –  1.f) The debts are established by credit
reports from January 2019, July 2020, January 2021, May 2022, and December 2022.
(GE 4-8)
Applicant attributed her financial problems to several contributing factors. Her first
husband only made  sporadic child  support payments,  often paying  less  than the  court
ordered him to pay. She estimated that he was approximately $10,000 in arrears. She
expended  about  $50,000  in  attorney’s  fees  to  contest  her  first  husband’s  custody
litigation.  Some  of  her  SOR  consumer  debts  are  directly  related  to  these  fees.  In  her
hearing  testimony,  she  admitted  all  six  underlying  SOR  debts,  although  she  disputed
some of the fees and costs of the debts. She also has had medical procedures over the
last two years, which required her to miss work and take short-term disability, reducing
her normal yearly gross income of $150,000 by about 40 percent ($60,000). (Tr.3 19-20,
24-25, 28, 36; GE 2)
Applicant and her fiancée recently purchased a home valued at approximately $1.3
million. Their monthly payments are approximately $6,700.  They both contribute to the
payments.  Applicant  explained  that  they  bought  a  large  home  with  outside  acreage
because their special needs children each needed their own room, and they needed the
large  outdoor  area  so the  children  would  have  enough  room  to  have  their own  space.
(Tr.3 22-23, 38)
Applicant  explained  that  she  thought  several of  these  debts  were  taken  care  of
when  she  hired  a  debt-relief  law  firm  to  negotiate  settlements  with  her  creditors.  She
indicated that she had correspondence from the law firm establishing their relationship
and payment plan. I asked her if she could provide it post-hearing and she said yes. She
did not provide any payment plan documentation. Post-hearing, she provided information
that  she  learned  about  the  law  firm  she  hired.  She  indicated  the  firm  was  no  longer
operating  and  had  been  sued  for  misconduct  and  malpractice.  She  stated  she  filed  a
complaint  with  the  Better  Business  Bureau,  but  she  did  not  supply  any  supporting
documentation. (AE A)
The status of the SOR debts is as follows:
SOR ¶  1.a-$1,045.  This is a medical debt. Applicant believes this was her second
spouse’s medical debt. Applicant paid this debt in 2020 or 2021. It does not appear on
her three most recent credit reports. This debt is resolved. (Tr.3 29-30; GE 6-8)
SOR ¶  1.b-$182.  This is a medical debt. Applicant believes this was her second
spouse’s medical debt. Applicant paid this debt in 2020 or 2021. It does not appear on
her three most recent credit reports. This debt is resolved. (Tr.3 29-30; GE 6-8)
SOR ¶  1.c-$13,990.  This is a delinquent credit card. Applicant documented making
payments  toward  this  debt  from  May  2021  to  October  2021  in  the  amount  of  $292
monthly.  She  used  the  proceeds  from  her  home  sale  in  November  2021  to  pay  the
remainder of the debt. This debt is resolved. (Tr.3 30-31; AE B-C)
SOR ¶¶  1.d, 1.f-$31,738;  $21,486. These are two delinquent credit cards. The first
major delinquency for these accounts were  in  October and December 2018.  Applicant
asserted  that  these  were  two  of  the  accounts  she  hired  the  law  firm  to  resolve.  She
believed  the  law  firm  disputed  the  debts.  When  asked  to  supply  supporting
documentation, she failed to do so. Both debts appear on her latest credit report. These
debts are not resolved. (Tr.3 31-32, 34, 40-41; GE 8)
SOR ¶  1.e-$7,544.  This is a delinquent credit card. The first major delinquency for
this account was in May 2019. Applicant asserted that this was an account she hired the
law  firm  to  resolve  by  setting  up  a  payment  plan.  When  asked  to  supply  supporting
documentation, she failed  to do  so.  This debt  appears on her latest  credit report.  This
debt is not resolved. (Tr.3 33, 34, 40-41; GE 8)
