Applicant  admitted  to  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a.  through  1.e.,  and  2.a.  He
denied  SOR  allegations  ¶¶  2.b.  and  2.c.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  50-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed with the defense contractor since 2008. He is separated from his spouse, and
has four children, three of whom are adults. (TR at page 15 line 22 to page 17 line 15,
and GX 1 at pages 7, 10, 14 and 17~18.)
Guideline J: Criminal Conduct  & Guideline E:  Personal Conduct
Although it is not specifically alleged, most, if not all, of Applicant’s Criminal and
Personal  Conduct  can  be  attributed  to  his  addiction  “to  Crystal  Methamphetamines.”
(GX  2  at  pages  4,  7 and  8.)  His  spouse,  whose  whereabouts  are  unknown,  also  has
this addiction problem. Applicant has been clean and sober since February 21, 2007, for
about  15  years,  and  actively  helps  others  with  their  sobriety.  (TR  at  page  25  line  7  to
page 30 line 23.)
1.a. and  2.c.  Applicant admits that in April of 1999 he violated a protection order
vis-à-vis  his  now,  separated  spouse.  He  was  sentenced  to  “30  day(s)  incarceration,”
pursuant to a guilty plea. (GX 3 at pages 1~3.)
1.b.,  2.a.  and  2.c. Applicant admits that in April of 1999 he was also charged with
Assault, a felony. Pursuant to his “No Contest” plea, Applicant was initially sentenced to
six  months  of  confinement  and  five  years  of  probation.  However,  in  May  of  2002,  he
violated that probation, which was revoked, and Applicant was sentenced to five years
of confinement. While incarcerated he joined a prison street gang. (TR at page 20 line 2
to page 22 line 19, at pages 24 line 23 to page 25 line 6, and GX 3 at pages 4~9.)
1.c.   and   2.c.   Applicant  admits  that  in  January  of  2004,  he  was  charged  with
resisting arrest, was convicted, and sentenced to 30 days confinement. (TR at page 22
line 20 to page 23 line 4.)
1.d.,  1.e.  and 2.c. Applicant admits that in February of 2007, he was charged with
Unauthorized Entry of a Dwelling, a felony; and in March of 2007, he was arrested and
charged with criminal contempt of court. In October of 2007, Applicant was sentenced to
one year of confinement (suspended) and placed on five years’ probation. (TR at page
23 line 5 to page 24 line 22, and GX 3 at pages 10~13.)
Guideline E:  Personal Conduct
The allegations in 2.a. and 2.c. have already been discussed, above.
2.b. Applicant denies that he falsified his 2019 SCA, in answer to  “Section 23 –
Illegal  Use  of  Drugs  or  Drug  Activity,”  by  failing  to  disclose  his  participation  in  drug
programs  in  2007.  He  avers,  credibly,  that  he  “misunderstood  the  question,”  and
“inadvertently answered it incorrectly.” (Answer at page 3.) Applicant has since become
“a manager of the program.” (TR at page 35 line 23 to page 36 line 14, and Answer at
page  3.)  His  character  and  credibility  in  this regard  are  supported  by  those  who  know
Applicant in the workplace. (AppX A.)
