Applicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security
clearance.  Admitted  facts  are  adopted  and  incorporated  by  reference.  Additional
findings of fact follow.
Background
Applicant  married  in  September  2007  and  has  two  children  from  this  marriage
(ages 12 and 10). (GEs 1 and 3; Tr. 27) He and his wife briefly separated in April 2017
before reuniting in later in 2017. (Tr. 32) He earned a high school diploma in May 2003.
Applicant  earned  an  associate’s  degree  in  May  2014  and  attended  sufficient
engineering  classes  between  November  2014  and  September  2016  to  meet  the
requirements for an electronics engineering associate’s degree before the college was
shut down by the Government. (GE 1; Tr. 30) Applicant enlisted in the Marine Corps in
September  2003  and  served  nine  years  of  active  duty  before  receiving  an  honorable
discharge in April 2012. (GE 1)
Since  March  2020,  Applicant  has  been  employed  by  his  current  employer  as  a
ballistics technician. (GE 1; Tr. 29) He reported periods of unemployment between April
2012  and  January 2016.  (GE  1) Between  December 2016  and  June  2019,  he  worked
for  other  employers  as  a  maintenance  technician.  (GEs  1-2)  He  has  held  a  security
clearance since April 2004. (GE 1; Tr. 28)
Applicant’s finances
Between  2018  and  2021,  Applicant  accumulated  delinquent  student  loans
exceeding  $93,000.  (GEs  1-3;  Tr.  23-30)  He  accrued  these  student  loan  deficiencies
during recurrent periods of unemployment when he could not work. Applicant’s student
loan records document that his loans were in forbearance throughout the 2017 calendar
year  and  early  2018.  (Tr.  34)  Once  the  forbearance  was  lifted  in  2019,  he  was  not
financially  able  to  address  them.  As  a  parent  of  an  autistic  child  (their  youngest),
Applicant’s wife could not work outside of the home. (Tr. 27) Compounding his financial
difficulties  in  2019,  Applicant  injured  his  foot  (causing  a  stress  fracture)  and  could  not
work for at least six months.  (GE 3; Tr. 34) While unable to address his student loans
for  lack  of  monetary  resources,  Applicant’s  student  loans  were  placed  in  collection
status  by  the  DoE.  (Tr.  34)  During  his  time  away  from  work,  he  was  treated  for
pulmonary issues. (GE 1 and AEs Q-R and X-Y)
Once Applicant returned to full-time employment in 2019, he made  contact with
his  student  loan  lender  and  entered  the  lender’s  rehabilitation  program.  Applicant
successfully completed his rehabilitation program. Records document that in May 2021,
Applicant’s rehabilitated student loans were returned to his servicing agent in December
2020  for  administering  and  collection  if  necessary.  (GE  2  and  AE  A  Tr.  37)  By  White
House  Executive  Order,  Applicant’s  still  outstanding  student  loans  were  placed  in
deferment  status  in  December  2021,  and  are  tentatively  scheduled  to  be  returned  to
active  enforcement  status  October  2023.  (Tr.  37)  At  this  time,  all  but  $38,763  of  his
accrued delinquent student loans have been forgiven and discharged. (AE D; Tr. 37-38)
In  December  2021,  Applicant  contracted  COVID-19  and  did  not  return  to  work
until  March  2022.  (Tr. 24-25)  For most  of  his COVID-19  absences,  he  received  short-
term  disability  payments  while  being  treated  for  his  COVID  symptoms.  Records
document  that  Applicant  was  approved  for  short-term  disability  and  missed  over  three
months of work. (AEs Q-R and X-Y; Tr. 24-26) Because his treating physician declined
to  provide  more  medical  information  about  his  condition,  he  was  denied  any  further
financial assistance. (Tr. 24-26)
With  his job  promotion  and  salary increase  (from  $26  to  $33  an  hour),  Applicant
fully expects to  be  able to  meet his  student loan  demands  once  the  payment   pause  is
expectedly  lifted   in  October 2023.  (Tr.  29,  38,  43-44)  Since   his  recovery   from   COVID-
19,  he   has   returned   to   full   time   employment.   (AEs   F-N;  Tr.  25)  His  remaining   student
loans  are   currently   in  good   standing.  While   he   has  personal  loans   to   repay  (two   from
financial  institutions   exceeding   $16,000)   along   with   advances  from   his  brother  and
friends exceeding  $1,400.  (Tr. 47-48)  He remains confident that he  will be  able to  fulfill
these  personal obligations and  still  meet  the  $143 set monthly payments on  his student
loan  debts   when   the  pause   is lifted.   (Tr. 49)  Applicant’s  payment   assurances   are   both
credible  and  reasonable  considering  all  of  the  circumstances  surrounding  his medical,
family, and employment loss issues that he has experienced over the past ten years.
