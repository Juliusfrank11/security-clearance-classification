Applicant admits the nine debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.i, totaling $33,197.
The  debts  consist  of  eight  consumer  debts  and  a  child  support  delinquency.  His
admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact.
Applicant is 41  years old. He  graduated  high school in  1999 and  attended  college
for  two   years  until  he   was  severely   injured   in  a   car  accident.   He   has   worked   for  his
sponsor since  2009.  He  holds a  second  job  as a  courier working  two  hours a  week in the
morning. He earns $100,000  a  year from  his sponsor. His second  job  pays $100  a  week.
Tr. at 19-21.)  He divorced  in 2019  after ten  years of marriage  and  has two  grade  school
aged   children.   His  spouse   left   him   in   February 2019  and  moved   in   with  one  of  his   co-
workers. He currently pays $1,100  in  child  support but  child  support has had  been  as high
as $1,390. His former spouse  has custody of  the  children  and  in  2020  moved  them  to
another state without court approval.
Applicant’s financial issues started in 2016. In addition to his salary, his wife earned
$35,000. His wife handled their finances. Unbeknownst to him she used money intended
for their bills to give to her parents who resided in a foreign country. (Tr. at 21-22.) They
had a home with $2,100 monthly mortgage. After his wife left him, he held onto the home
so  that he  had  a place  for his children.  His  former  spouse then  fled  the  state  with  the
children. As part of the marital settlement agreement, he was responsible for 60 percent
of the debt and his former spouse 40 percent. She has not paid her share of the marital
debts.  (Tr  at  56  and  AE-L  at  8.)  He  stated  he  “failed  to  make  a  lot  of  payments,  just
because I was trying to maintain my mortgage and my kids and live too.” (Tr. at 16.) He
sold the house in April 2020 and was essentially homeless for a period until he found a
room to rent in a home. (Tr. at 16, 44 and AE-D.) He has been “able to knock down a lot
of these bills” because he was able to get the part-time job, restructure the child support
amount, and sell the house. (Tr. at 16-17.) He has been “paying off smaller debts first and
moving on to the bigger ones” as additional income  becomes available.  (Tr at 39.)  He
provides support for his children above his court ordered obligation. (Tr. at 52.)
SOR ¶  1.a:  past-due car loan charged  off  for $3,947. The loan was in Applicant’s
and  his spouse’s  names.  The  car had  been totaled  in  2018 and  the  insurance did  not
cover  all   that   he   owed.   After  the   divorce,   his  spouse   stopped   making   payments.   He
assumed  the  payments and  has  reduced  the  debt  to  $784.  (Tr. at  28, 35  and  AE-C at  28.)

1.e  when  the  debt alleged  in SOR ¶  1.a  is resolved  in May 2023. (Tr. at 41  and  AE-C  at
30.)
SOR ¶  1.f:  past-due store  account  charged off for $1,953.  Applicant and his
former spouse held this account jointly. He did not realize it was still delinquent. He stated
he will begin payment on this debt when the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a is resolved in May
2023. (Tr. at 41 and AE-C at 30.)
SOR ¶  1.g: past-due child support referred for collection for $6,872. The initial
child support order was ordered vacated on November 18, 2021. (AE-A.) The initial child
support  order  had  been  backdated  to  when  his  former  spouse  left  with  the  children,
resulting in an immediate arrearage. The Consent Order modified the amount downward.
(AE-B at 2.) He presently has a positive balance of $120. (Tr. at 41-42.)
SOR ¶  1.h: past-due  credit card  account  charged off for $7,420. Applicant and
his former spouse held this card jointly. He has spoken with the creditor and explained
his plan. He will start payments when he finishes paying off some of the other debts (Tr.
at 42.)

he had paid off this account. He provided AE-K showing he paid the debt off on March 1,
2021. (Tr. at 29.)
As noted above, Applicant has resolved three of the eight consumer accounts, and
has provided evidence of ongoing payments for two more. He has acted consistent with
his  stated  plan  of  resolving  a  debt  and  moving  onto  another  debt  with  the  previously
obligated income.
