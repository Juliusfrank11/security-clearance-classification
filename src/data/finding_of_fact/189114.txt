Applicant  admitted  the  four  allegations  under  the  drug  involvement  guideline,
and the three allegations under the personal conduct guideline, without explanations.
Applicant is 31 years old. She has been married to her second husband for two
years.  The  couple  have  no  children.  She  married  her  first  husband  in  February  2016,
and divorced him in March 2017. She has been working for her employer since January
2017. She began as a branch manager and currently is an engineering manager on the
leadership team. She supervises 300 individuals. (GE 1 at 25; GE 3 at 6; Tr. 33-37)
From August 2006 to March 2010, Applicant attended a military academy and
received  a  high  school  diploma  in  May  2010.  She  attended  an  aeronautics  university
from August 2010 to June 2014, where she earned a bachelor’s degree. She received
three  work-related  certificates  in  2019,  and  a  cash  award  in  2020.  Her  performance
evaluations for 2018, 2019, and 2021 registered eight or higher on a one to ten  rating
system.  In  August  2021,  she  received  a  master’s  degree  in  science  in  unmanned
systems. (GE 1 at 13-15; GE 3 at 5; Tr. 65-66; AE 1, 2, 3)
After graduating from the university in June 2014, Applicant was commissioned
to  the  United  States  Army  Reserve  (USAR)  as  an  officer.  She  was  then  assigned  to
United States (U.S.) duty locations while working civilian jobs. She went on active duty
to  Afghanistan  from  January  2016  to  January  2017,  when  she  returned  to  the  United
States  and  began  working  for  her  current  employer.  She  remained  in  the  USAR  until
July 2019, when she left by mutual agreement after unsatisfactory performance, though
the  record  persuasively  demonstrates  there  was  nothing  wrong  with  her  performance.
She never explained the nature of the unsatisfactory performance. She made reference
to: (1) an incident during her deployment that she did not want to be recorded; (2) her
subsequent  marijuana  usage  because  of  sleep  problems;  and  (3)  counseling  she
received from her chain-of-command in August 2018 because of her failed drug test in
July 2018. (GE 1 at 17; GE 3 at 4-5; GE 4; Tr. 43)
Drug Involvement
SOR  ¶   1.a   –  In  her  August  2021answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  that
she initially used marijuana at varying frequencies from August 2009 to June 2014, and
later  purchased  marijuana  from  January  2017  to  August  2018.  She  began  using
marijuana  in  August  2009  sporadically  in  high  school  in  social  settings.  Though  she
testified that she could not recall how many times she used the drug in high school, she
estimated  two  times  in  her  August  2019  e-QIP.  She  acquired  the  drug  from  her  high
school friends. (GE 1 at 37; GE 3 at 5; Tr. 62) There is no evidence indicating that she
purchased the drug during this period.
In college from 2010 to June 2014, Applicant testified that she used marijuana
sporadically. While  she  could not attach  a  number  for the  times  she  used  the  drug,  in
her August 2019 e-QIP, she estimated her use as “a handful of times in college.”  She
testified that she did not purchase the drug while in college. (GE 1 at 37-38; Tr. 41, 54,
63)
After  graduating  from  the  university
in  June  2014,  and  receiving  her
commission into the USAR, Applicant stopped using marijuana because she recognized
the zero-tolerance policy against drug use in the U.S. Army (USA). Before receiving her
commission, she tested positive for marijuana in June 2014. (GE 4 at 5; Tr. 41)
Applicant stated in her April 2020 PSI that she used marijuana two months after
returning  from  her  active-duty  deployment  in  December  2016.  Anxiety  and  post-
traumatic  stress  syndrome  (PTSD),  two  undiagnosed  medical  conditions  that  were
related  to  Applicant’s  foreign  deployment  which  caused  sleep  problems,  were  the
reasons  that  she  resumed  using  marijuana.  She  justified  drug  use  over  alcohol  use
because of her father’s ongoing problems with alcohol; she rationalized marijuana use
over  treatment  from  a  medical  professional  because  of  Applicant’s  family’s  risk  of
addiction. She smoked marijuana less than 12 times in 2017, and once a month in 2018
until June 2018 when she failed a drug test. She purchased the drug during this period.
(GE  3 at 4-5; GE 4 at 5; Tr.  50-52, 54, 74) Applicant  testified that after returning from
foreign  deployment,  she  did  not  resume  marijuana  use  until  June  or  July  2017,  rather
than January 2017. (Tr. 49-50) In her December 2019 e-QIP, she stated that she did not
intend to use marijuana in the future because of her discharge from the military in July
2019 (SOR ¶ 2.b), which helped reduce her stress and sleep problems. (GE 1 at 37-38)
In the same form, she admitted using marijuana while possessing a security clearance,
but  falsely  denied  purchasing  marijuana  in  the  previous  7  years.  (GE  1  at  38)  This
falsification is not alleged in the SOR, but will be considered in the whole-person section
of this decision.
SOR  ¶   1.b   –    Applicant  admitted  in  her  answer  that  between  November  2011
and August 2018, she used and purchased marijuana while she was granted access to
classified  information.  Though  she  had  a  security  clearance  during  the  entire  period
covered by  SOR  ¶ 1.b,  she did not use or purchase marijuana between  June 2014 to
the  middle  of  2017.  She  claimed  she  did  not  know  that  she  had  a  security  clearance
until she was receiving briefings in 2015 in advance of foreign deployment in early 2016.
(Tr. 42) She also claimed that she did not know that the e-QIP she filled out in 2011 had
a connection to her security clearance. She believed her security clearance was granted
to her by virtue of her military status as an officer. (Tr. 42)
SOR ¶  1.d –   In June 2014, Applicant tested positive for marijuana based on a
urinalysis  test  administered  by  Applicant’s  Army  unit.  She  did  not  receive  the  results
until  2018,  when  she  took  another  urinalysis  test.  In  the  interim  years,  she  registered
negative results from seven urinalysis tests between June 2014 and June 2018. (GE 4
at 5; Tr. 43-44)
SOR ¶  1.c  –   In June 2018, Applicant tested positive for marijuana based on a
urinalysis test administered by her Army unit. (GE 4 at 5)
After  Applicant’s  positive  marijuana  test  in  June  2018,  she  sought  treatment
from medical professionals, using her employer’s assistance program. During five or six
months  of  treatment,  she  learned  different  tactics  to  alleviate  stress,  such  as  physical
fitness, medication techniques, and alternative communication practices. (Tr. 55-56, 78,
86-89)
In  her  testimony,  Applicant  stressed  that  she  does  not  intend  to  resume
marijuana  use  in  the  future.  She  has  made  positive  changes  in  her  lifestyle.  She  no
longer  associates  with  the  person  she  purchased  the  marijuana  from.  She  does  not
associate with any drug users or environments where drugs are used. She has provided
a  statement  of  intent  to  refrain  from  future  drug  use,  recognizing  that  any  future  drug
involvement is grounds for revocation of eligibility for security clearance eligibility. (AE 6)
She and her husband plan to start a family. She is thriving in her career development.
One aspect of Applicant’s job is counseling her employees on career development and
security  issues.  She  emphasizes  the  importance  of  supplying  truthful  information  on
security forms. (Tr. 57-58, 81-82)
Personal Conduct
SOR  ¶   2.a   –    Applicant’s  illegal  use  of  marijuana  between  August  2009  and
2014,  and  between  the  middle  of  2017  to  June  2018,  while  possessing  a  security
clearance, demonstrates questionable judgment under the personal conduct guideline.
SOR ¶  2.b  –   Applicant was administratively separated from USAR in July 2019
for misconduct, specifically drug use. (GE 3 at 5; AE 1-2) Applicant claimed that if she
had told her commander that she intended to stay in the military, the commander was
willing to ensure that Applicant would not be administratively separated from the USAR.
(Tr.  56-57,  76-77)  In  her  undated  character  statement  describing  Applicant’s  remorse
for her drug use and her good job performance, the commander indicated that “I would
have  fought  to  keep  [Applicant]  in  the  military  if  I  could  have.”  (AE  4  at  4)  I  find  that
Applicant was administratively  separated from the USAR for her drug use. (GE 3 at 5;
GE 4 at 1)
SOR ¶  2.c –   In her October 2011 e-QIP, Applicant was asked in Section 23 of
the application if she had used illegal drugs in the last seven years. By answering “no”
to the question, Applicant deliberately failed to disclose her marijuana use (SOR ¶ 1.a)
that began on August 9, 2009. In her answer to the SOR, she admitted she falsified her
answer to the question. (Tr. 63-65)
In 2010, when Applicant was 19 years old and applying for colleges, a military
recruiter recommended that she not disclose her marijuana use since she aspired to be
an officer in the military. (Tr. 38) In 2011 at age 20, after attending a Reserve Officer’s
Training  Corps  (ROTC)  scholarship  ceremony,  she  went  into  a  conference  room  and,
under  the  supervision  of  military  recruiters,  filled  out  different  forms  that  she  believed
related to her ROTC scholarship and to join the military. She did not know that one of
those forms was a security clearance application, but she did know that information that
she  put  on  2011  security  clearance  application  was  incorrect.  (Tr.  40)  At  the  hearing,
she indicated that she did not know she had a security clearance until she was receiving
briefings  in  2015  for  foreign  deployment  in  early  2016.  (Tr.  42)  Regardless  of  when
Applicant became aware she had a security clearance, she knew in October 2011 that
she deliberately concealed her marijuana use as set forth in SOR ¶ 1.a.
Character Evidence
Witness  A,  a  project  manager  for  Applicant’s  employer,  has  had  a  security
clearance since late 2017. In the last five years, he has worked with Applicant in several
locations. They have worked on several projects together. Witness A believes Applicant
is honest and pleasant to work with. The adverse information in the SOR occurred many
years ago and does not change Witness A’s favorable opinion of Applicant. Though not
fully  aware  of  his  employer’s  drug  policy,  he  is  aware  that  using  illegal  drugs  while
holding a security clearance could result in loss of the clearance. (Tr. 16-22)
Witness   B   works for Applicant’s employer as   a   financial officer in   the   office of
intelligence   and   analytics.   He   has   had     security  clearance   for  10   years.  He  has  been
working  with  her  since  2018. Besides being  trustworthy, Witness B  praises Applicant’s
professional   approach   in  evaluating   a   task  from   all   angles  before   proceeding   with   a
pragmatic   solution.   Witness   B   is  not   aware   of  his  employer’s  drug   policy,   but  believes
that a  person’s  drug  use  while holding  security clearance  must be  evaluated  on  a  case-
by-case basis. (Tr. 23-33)
Applicant  submitted  four-character  references.  Reference  C  works  as  a
scheduling supervisor for a distiller. In 2016, he served with Applicant in the Middle East
where she was the officer in charge (OIC) of operations. In that position, Reference C
watched  Applicant  develop  a  commendable  reputation  for  organizational  skills  and
problem-solving abilities. Reference C believes Applicant is security conscious. (AE 4 at
C)
Reference D works for a defense contractor and has a security clearance. This
reference  has  known  Applicant  for  13  years  and  met  her  in  college.  They  were  in
separate  branches  of  the  military  through  the  ROTC  program.  Reference  D  believes
Applicant is reliable and merits a security clearance. (AE 4 at D)
Reference  E,  a  program  manager,  has  known  Applicant  since  2010  and
considers her a role model who is very trustworthy. He recommends her for a security
clearance. (AE 4 at E)
Reference F was Applicant’s commander and is currently a major  in the USA.
Reference  F  relied  on  Applicant  as  OIC  of  the  weapon  ranges  or  as  the  training  and
planning officer. Based on Applicant’s performance in all tasks she was assigned, and
her  security  consciousness,  Reference  F  recommends  that  she  receive  a  security
clearance. (AE 4 at F)
Reference G has been an employee of the intelligence and analytics division of
Applicant’s employer since 2012. Having worked with Applicant since 2018, reference G
believes she exercises good judgment and trustworthiness. In his view she has earned
security clearance eligibility. (AE 4 at G)
