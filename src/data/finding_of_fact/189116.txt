Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶  1.d,  with  explanations,  but  he  denied  the  remaining
allegations (SOR ¶¶ 1.a–1.c, 1.e–1.g, and 2.a–2.b). His admission is incorporated into
these findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following
additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  He began working
at  his  present  job  in  August  2020.  He  has  worked  for  U.S.  defense  contractors  since
2007,  except  for  two  periods  of  unemployment  (March-July  2018  and  January-March
2016); and when he worked for a  foreign contractor that had a contract with the  UAE,
discussed  below  (May  2014-January  2016).  He  served  in  the  U.S.  Air  Force  for  10
years,  and  he  was  honorably  discharged  in  2007.  He  holds  a  Ph.D.  He  has  been
married over 24 years and has four children, ages 22, 21, 19, and 17. (Tr. 6, 23, 34, 27;
GE 1)
Under  Guideline  F,  the  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  had  a  past-due  mortgage
account  in  the  amount  of  approximately  $29,400  (SOR  ¶  1.a)  and  two  charged-off
accounts  in  the  approximate amounts of $1,300  and $2,398 (SOR  ¶¶ 1.b-1.c); that he
was  delinquent  on  a  loan  to  a  foreign  bank  in  the  approximate  amount  of  $103,000
(SOR  ¶  1.g);  that  he  had  an  IRS  tax  lien  filed  against  him  in  April  2017,  for
approximately  $31,000  (SOR  ¶  1.d);  that  he  owed  delinquent  federal  income  taxes  to
the IRS for tax years 2014 and 2018, in the amount of approximately $54,000; and that
he failed to file federal income tax returns for tax years 2014 through 2018, as required.
Under Guideline B,  the  SOR  cross-alleged SOR  ¶  1.g  (SOR  ¶ 2.a)  and  that  Applicant
had approximately $42,000 frozen by the foreign bank servicing his account because of
his  delinquent  loan.  (SOR  ¶  2.b)  Applicant’s admissions  and documentation  contained
in  his  undated  answers  to  interrogatories  and  credit  reports,  establish  the  SOR
allegations under Guideline F. (GE 3-4)
Financial  Considerations
Applicant  credibly  explained  that  there  were  several  reasons  for  his  financial
difficulties that began in approximately 2013. First, he took on the responsibility for his
father’s nursing-home care after his mother passed away in 2013. His father was 100%
disabled  due  to  a  stroke  he  suffered.  Applicant  became  financially  responsible  for  his
father’s  nursing home costs  and medical  expenses not covered  by insurance.  He  was
not  prepared  for  the  extent  of  those  expenses.  He  ended  up  taking  money  out  of  his
retirement plan, which resulted in penalties and led to his large federal tax debt in 2014.
(Tr. 61-63; SOR answer)
The  second  contributing  reason  for  Applicant’s  financial  difficulties  occurred  in
December  2015,  when  he  lost  his  employment  in  the  UAE  due  to  his  company  losing
the contract with the UAE government. He had accepted a position with a contractor in
May  2014.  The  contractor  had  a  four-year  contract  with  the  UAE  government,  which
was  the  contract  for  which  Applicant  was  hired.  After  about  18  months,  in  December
2015, the UAE rescinded the contract and Applicant was out of a job. His yearly salary
at the time was approximately $250,000. He also had relocated his whole family to the
UAE and was required to leave the country within 30 days because he was no longer on
a  work  visa.  He  moved  back  to  the  United  States,  but  remained  unemployed  for
approximately  four  months,  resulting  in  an  income  loss  over  the  period  of  about
$80,000. This is when his monthly debts started becoming delinquent. (Tr. 24-25; SOR
answer)
The  third  reason  for  his  financial  problems  came  about  because  of  a  second
period of extended unemployment beginning in March 2018, due to an unexpected job
loss. Applicant was let go by his employer over a misunderstanding about being able to
charge for labor under the contract when he was working remotely. He had not sought
approval  beforehand  to  do  so  and  was  relieved  of  his  duties.  His  resulting
unemployment  lasted  six  months.  He  received  unemployment  benefits,  but  his  overall
loss  of  income  during  this  period  was  approximately  $60,000.  He  was  forced  to  use
savings to keep up with his bills, but he kept getting further behind. (Tr. 26; GE 1; SOR
answer)
The status of Applicant’s debts and federal tax return issues is as follows:
Past-Due  Mortgage-$29,466  (SOR ¶  1.a). Applicant explained that his mortgage
became delinquent in late 2019 or early 2020. He missed some payments because he
had  children  starting  college.  In  February  2020,  he  sent  the  bank  two  catch-up
payments, but it refused to accept them. The bank told Applicant that he had to apply
for a  mortgage  modification.  After ignoring  two  requests  by Applicant,  the  bank  began
processing  his  loan  modification  request  in  the  fall  of  2021.  The  process  was  delayed
because of Covid-19. After extended delays by the bank, Applicant decided to sell the
home. The home sold in November 2021, and Applicant documented that the mortgage
was  paid  in  December  2021.  This  debt  is  resolved.  (Tr.  33-39;  AE  A  (Atch  A);  SOR
answer (Encl 2))
Consumer  Debt-$1,307   (SOR  ¶   1.b).  This  account  was  charged  off  and
assigned  for  collection  in  May  2017.  Applicant  set  up  a  payment  plan  and  completed
making payments in September 2019, settling the debt before the issuance of the SOR.
This debt is resolved. (Tr. 40; GE 4; AE A (Atch B))
Consumer  Debt-$2,398   (SOR  ¶   1.c).  This  account  was  charged  off  and
assigned  for  collection  in  February  2017.  Applicant  set  up  a  payment  plan  and
completed making payments in March 2019 settling the debt before the issuance of the
SOR.  He  received  an  IRS  1099-C,  cancellation  of  debt  form  for  the  remainder  of  the
debt. He claimed this amount on his 2019 tax return. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 4; GE 4;
AE A (Atch C))
Bank   Loan-$103,781   (SOR  ¶   1.g).  This  debt  originated  when  Applicant  took  a
job in the UAE in 2014. He took out a $200,000 loan to establish his family’s household
in the UAE and pay for private schooling for his children. The terms of the loan provided
for  a  four-year  payback  period.  When  Applicant’s  company’s  contract  was  cancelled
after approximately 18 months and Applicant was required to leave the UAE within 30
days,  this loan  became  immediately due.  Applicant  received  approximately $42,000  in
severance pay when he was terminated because of the lost contract. The bank applied
this amount against the loan balance. This is what SOR ¶ 2.b erroneously referred to as
an  amount  “frozen”  by  the  bank  due  to  the  delinquent  loan.  Initially  the  bank  was
unwilling to accept a payment plan and demanded payment in full. Thereafter, Applicant
communicated with the bank, and it agreed to accept a payment plan for the loan. He
documented making monthly payments  from  June through September 2021. When he
sold his home in 2021, he used some of the sale proceeds to pay off this bank loan in
the UAE. He provided documentation showing the payoff. Once the loan was paid, he
closed all bank accounts in the UAE. He no longer has any bank accounts in the UAE.
This debt is resolved. (Tr. 32, 55-60, 69; AE A (Atch F); SOR answer (Encls 8-11)
IRS  Tax  Lien-$31,015  (SOR ¶  1.d).  This tax lien is an enforcement mechanism
for  the  taxes  owed  as  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.e  and  is  therefore  a  duplicitous  pleading
alleging the same underlying conduct. I find for Applicant on this allegation.
Federal  Taxes   Owed  for  2014   and  2018-$54,236   (SOR  ¶  1.e).  Applicant
incurred  a  large  tax  debt  in  2014  because  he  withdrew  funds  from  his  retirement
account  to pay  for his father’s  care,  which  resulted  in  an  early  withdrawal  penalty and
capital gains taxes. He was unable to pay the taxes when due because he had recently
lost his job in the UAE. He worked out a payment plan with the IRS and began making
payments  in  May  2021.  The  establishment  of  the  plan  was  delayed  because  of
difficulties  reaching  the  IRS  during  Covid-19.  When  he  sold  his  home  in  December
2021, he used some of the proceeds to pay all his remaining IRS debt. He documented
that  he  owes  no  further  federal  tax  debt,  and  the  tax  lien  was  released.  This  debt  is
resolved. (Tr. 36, 43-46, 61-63; AE A (Atch D), AE B, D; SOR answer)
Unfiled Federal Tax  Returns  for 2014-2019: Applicant documented that for his
2014 tax return, he requested an extension, and that return was timely filed within the
extended time frame. For the remaining tax returns in question, he filed as follows:
TY 2014-filed October 2015
TY 2015-filed February 2021
TY 2016-filed August 2019
TY 2017-filed July 2019
TY 2018-filed October 2020
TY 2019-filed February 2021 (AE A (Atch E))
Applicant  explained  that  his  2015  tax  return  was  very  complicated  because  of  his
overseas  employment  and  subsequent  termination.  He  did  not  receive  timely  tax
information from his former employer, which further delayed being able to file his 2015
return.  He  initially  sent  in  his  2015  tax  return  only  to  have  it  returned  because  of  a
missing  healthcare  form  (1095-A-C).  The  delayed  filing  of  his  2015  return  had  a
snowball effect on the subsequent years’  filings and they were also delayed. Applicant
also accepted responsibility for putting the burden of handling the family’s finances and
doing their taxes on his wife. He realizes this was unfair and he now shares the financial
responsibilities  with  her.  They  timely  filed  their  2021  federal  tax  returns.  He  does  not
foresee working overseas in the future and does not expect to encounter the same tax
filing problems in the future. (Tr. 46-51; AE A (Atch E); SOR answer)
Applicant  uses  a  nationally  known  financial  expert’s  guidelines  to  mange  his
finances.  He  documented  using  a  written  family  budget  to  track  their  monthly  income
and  expenditures.  The  budget  shows  a  monthly  residual  of  approximately  $1,350.  He
has  approximately  $100,000  in  his  retirement  account.  His  most  recent  credit  report
shows that all his debts are being paid on time. (Tr. 51, 53, 77, 80-81; GE 6; AE A (Atch
G), AE C)
Foreign Influence
As explained above, Applicant’s sole connection with the UAE arose because of
his 18-month employment within the country. That employment ended in late 2015 and
Applicant has never returned. When he was employed there, he took out a loan from a
local bank to fund his family’s move to the country, establish a home there, and fund his
children’s schooling. He defaulted on the loan when he lost his job. His severance pay
was  applied  to  the  loan  balance  and  he  paid  the  remaining  amount,  initially  through
monthly  payments,  and  finally  by  using  some  of  the  proceeds  from  his  home  sale  in
December 2021. He closed all bank accounts in the UAE. He has no current financial or
family connection to the UAE. (Tr. 56: AE A (Atch F))
Character  Information
Applicant  presented  statements  from  former  and  current  coworkers  (including
supervisors),  who  attested  to  his  integrity,  work  ethic,  trustworthiness,  honesty,  and
good  judgment.  They  also  recommend  that  he  retain  his  security  clearance.  (SOR
