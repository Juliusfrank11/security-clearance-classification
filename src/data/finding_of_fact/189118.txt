In her Answer, Applicant admitted  all the SOR allegations, but correctly pointed
out that SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.h were duplicate listings of the same debt, and claimed that
the former $99 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.i had been repaid on some unspecified date. Her
admissions are incorporated into these findings of fact. (GE 1; AE B.)
Applicant is 48 years old. She served in the U.S. Navy from October 2005 to May
2015, when she received an honorable discharge. The Navy CAF had denied her initial
security clearance request in 2006 due to unmitigated financial considerations, including
15  delinquent  student  loan  debts  totaling  $49,656.  Her  appeal  of  that  decision  was
unsuccessful. She earned an associate degree in 2011, and a bachelor’s degree in 2016.
She  was  most  recently  granted  a  Secret  security  clearance  in  May  2013.  She  was
voluntarily unemployed from August 2015 to May 2016, while attending school full time
to complete her bachelor’s degree. She worked full time for a state government agency
from June 2016 until June 2017, when she accepted her current DoD-contractor position
as an administrative assistant at a Marine Corps Support Facility. She is married, for the
second time, and has no children. (GE 2, GE 3; GE 8.)
After consolidating the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.h, and using the more
recent information from SOR ¶ 1.a, Applicant admitted $120,211 of currently or recently
delinquent  indebtedness,  including  six  consumer  accounts  totaling  $27,836  and  two
consolidated  student  loan  accounts  totaling  $92,375.  The  status  of  each  of  the  SOR-
alleged debts is described in the following paragraphs.
SOR  ¶¶   1.a   and   1.h:   This  was  a  credit  card  account  that  Applicant  opened  in
October 2017. Her last timely payment was made in June 2018  (SOR ¶ 1.h). In March
2020, the $1,620 delinquent balance due was placed for collection. Applicant made one
$540 payment to the collection agency in November 2020, which reduced the delinquent
balance to $1,080 (SOR ¶ 1.a). Applicant said in her Answer that this debt would be paid
in full on July 8, 2022. In her Response to the FORM, she said that she planned to begin
making  biweekly  $154  payments  toward  this  debt  in  February  2023,  but  the  balance
remained at $1,080 in the absence of any actual payments. This debt originated during
her current employment and remains unresolved. (GE 2; GE 5; GE 7; AE A; AE B.)
SOR ¶¶  1.b  and  1.c: These  paragraphs allege  Applicant’s two  current student loan
accounts,  under which  all  her formerly delinquent student loans were  consolidated  in June
2017 (the same month she began her current employment). The  last reported  activity on
the  consolidated  accounts was  in December 2018.  They  were  placed  for collection  by the
U.S. Department of  Education  in March 2020, with  delinquent outstanding  balances of
$59,550  and $32,825. Applicant admitted owing the outstanding total of $92,375, toward
which she has made  no payments. Her December 2022 Transunion CBR confirmed that
no  payments had  been  received, but changed  the  status of these  debts to, “Current;  Paid
or  Paying   as  Agreed.”  Since   no   explanation   was  provided,  this  could  be   due   to   the
temporary COVID-19  forbearance  policy concerning  collection  of  valid  delinquent student
loans. Applicant offered no evidence of responsible efforts to resolve or repay any of her
voluntarily incurred  student loan  debts, including  the  15  delinquencies of concern when
her clearance was denied in  2006.
SOR ¶¶  1.d  through  1.g:  Applicant admitted that she owes $26,657 toward four
delinquent debts that a credit union has charged off. Two of these involved $12,698 and
$3,868 credit card accounts, which she opened  in December 2011 and January 2012,
and  stopped  paying  in  July  and  December  2015.  The  other  two  were  unsecured  loan
accounts  in  the  amounts  of  $2,116  and  $7,975  that  she  opened  in  November  and
December 2013. She stopped repaying these loans in June and July 2015. She did not
provide  evidence  of  any  effort  to  resolve  these  accounts,  which  she  opened  while  on
active duty and stopped paying shortly after her discharge. (GE 3; GE 5; GE 7; AE B.)
SOR ¶  1.i: Applicant admitted the $99 delinquent debt to a franchise fitness center
that  was  placed  for  collection  in  February 2018.  In  December  2018,  she  told  an  OPM
investigator that she broke her membership contract with the gym in June 2016 when she
moved after completing her bachelor’s degree; and that she would pay it later that month.
In  her  Answer  and  her  Response,  she  said  that  she  had  paid  this debt.  Although  she
provided no documentation to support this claim, the debt does not appear on any of the
record credit reports dated after April 2019. On balance I will accept her assertion that it
is resolved. (GE3; GE 4; AE B.)
The record contains no evidence establishing Applicant’s current income, budget
situation, or participation in  financial counseling. It is also silent with respect to her job
in  a  professional  setting,  observation  of  security
performance,
trustworthiness
procedures, and track record in handling sensitive information. I was unable to evaluate
her  credibility,  demeanor,  or  character  in  person,  since  she  elected  to  have  her  case
decided without a hearing.
