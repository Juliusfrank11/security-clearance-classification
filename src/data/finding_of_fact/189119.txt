Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  allegations  in  the  SOR.  I  have  incorporated  his
admissions into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings,
testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 50 years old. He earned an associate degree and a bachelor’s degree.
He served in the military from 1992 to 1998 and was honorably discharged. He married
in 1998 and divorced in 2001. He remarried in 2002 and divorced in 2020. He and his
second wife adopted a child. He has physical custody of the child and does not receive
child support. He remarried in 2021 and has two stepchildren. He has been employed by
federal contractors since 1998. He has had no periods of unemployment. He has held a
security clearance since he was in the military. (Tr. 19-23; GE 1)
The  SOR alleges four debts  for mortgages  obtained  by  Applicant and  his second
wife  for rental properties. (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  - $31,712;  1.b  $23,190; 1.c   - $6,402;  and 1.d  -
$3,224). Applicant testified  that  he  had  nine  rental  properties at one  time, and  his credit
was perfect prior to  2013. He obtained  the  properties from  2000  to  2013. He testified  that
they  were   great  investments  and   were   inexpensive  to   purchase.  Due   to   management
issues,  the  properties needed  maintenance. He was unable to  pay for repairs. Seven  of
the  properties were not  rented  and  were  not  being  maintained  properly. He was  aware of
the  problems because  the  managers were  family members. He  was paying  approximately
$2,000-$3,000   a   month   for  the   seven   properties  that   were   not   occupied.  He   stopped
paying  the  mortgages on  the  rental properties  in about  2015  and  they foreclosed.  He  said
he received  IRS  1099-C  cancelation  of  debt forms for two  of the  properties.   The  debts
are all charged  off.  (Tr. 24-25, 28-37, 52-54, 70; GE 2; Answer to the SOR)
In Applicant’s SOR answer he stated that the mortgage debts were sold and his
understanding is that the “debt collectors listed will continue this process for the remaining
companies,  as  I  have  received  sporadic  correspondence  at  best.”  He  testified  that  he
believes the properties will be sold and the banks will get their money. He said he tried to
sell the properties but was unsuccessful. He has not contacted any of the creditors and
has not made arrangements to resolve the delinquent loans. (Tr. 25, 52-53, 70; GE 1, 2,
3, 4)
In  2013,  Applicant  and  his  second  wife  adopted  a  child  who  had  medical issues
that  required   surgeries.  He   testified   that  he   had   medical  insurance   but  not  all   the
expenses were  covered. He estimated  that since  then  he  has had  about $2,000  a  year in
his  child’s  medical  expenses  that  was  not  covered   by  his  medical  insurance.  He  said
“everything”  took  a   backseat  to   his  daughter’s  medical  needs.  He  was  focused   on   his
daughter’s medical needs, and  he  was  not focused  on  his finances or tax  issues.  (Tr. 24-
25, 34-36)
In  2011, Applicant went from  being  a  salaried  employee  receiving  a  W-2  income
statement to  an  independent contractor.  He was not  having  any income  withheld and  he
was not making  estimated  tax payments for tax years 2013  to  2018. He said 2013  was
the   first  year  he   had   his  daughter  and   additional  expenses.  He  was  not  focused   on
financial  matters.  He  failed   to   pay  his  federal  income   taxes  for  2013   (SOR  ¶   1.e   -
$64,388), 2014  (SOR ¶  1.f  - $37,363), 2015  (SOR ¶  1.g  - $51,263), 2016  (SOR ¶  1.h  -
$22,359),  2017  (SOR ¶  1.i - $18,198),  and  2019  (SOR ¶  1.j $8,690).  He testified  that he
was aware  he  owed  taxes each year and did  not pay them. (Tr. 37-41, 69-70; GE  5)
Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator  in  May  2020.  He  said
sometime in 2018, an IRS agent contacted him about his delinquent federal income taxes.
He had not paid his taxes for tax years 2013 to 2017. A payment plan was discussed,
and Applicant agreed to make $2,500 monthly payments on the total amount due at that
time of approximately $150,000. The plan included tax years 2013 to 2017. It is unknown
why the plan did not include his 2012 tax debt. Applicant made a payment of $1,393 in
November 2018 and then five monthly payments of $2,500 from December 2019 to May
2019. These payments were all applied to tax year 2012. When he failed to timely pay his
2018 taxes, the agreement became null and void. Applicant testified that he believed his
2018 taxes would be rolled into the agreement. He said he attempted to contact the IRS
and was told to contact the local agent. He said he was unsuccessful. He has attempted
to contact the IRS since 2018 and has been unsuccessful. He testified that in March 2023,
he contacted a commercial tax company to attempt to resolve the tax debt through an
offer-in-compromise. He has not hired anyone but he intends to reach out to them again.
His plan for the future is to negotiate with the IRS to resolve the debt. He has not contacted
the IRS to begin this process. (Tr. 26-27, 41-49, 51, 67-70; GE 2, 5; AE B)
Applicant  provided   a   payment   activity  document  from   the   IRS   showing   the
following  payments: $8,678  - April 2021; $199  - May 2021; $300  - August  2021; $100  in
the   months  of  December  2021,  January,   March,   and   September  2022;  $5,790   -
November 2022; $423  - December 2022;  and  $100  - March 2023.  In  addition, Applicant
provided an  account balance  document from  the  IRS  that shows a  total amount of taxes
owed  as $186,878  for  tax years 2013  through  2018. It  does  not  reflect current information
for tax year 2020.  Applicant testified  that he  believes he  owes approximately $2,500  for
tax year 2020. He intends to pay it.  It shows a zero balance for 2019 and  2021. No  other
information  was provided  by Applicant  about how he  intends to  resolve his tax  debt. (Tr.
24, 47-51; AE A, B)
The debts alleged in the SOR are corroborated by Applicant’s answer to the SOR,
testimony,  tax  transcripts,  and  credit  reports  from  February  2021,  May  2020,  and
September 2020 (GE 1, 3, 4, 5)
Applicant earns approximately $139,000. His wife works part time as a substitute
teacher. He has to pay his second wife $1,200 a month for five years as part of a division
of assets because he received the house in their settlement. He purchased a new car in
2020. His child and stepchildren attend private school costing about $1,100 monthly. He
has  approximately  $1,000  to  $2,000  in  expendable  income  after  he  pays  the  family
expenses. He sporadically invests his expendable income when he can in cryptocurrency.
Two years ago, he invested $8,000 in cryptocurrency. It was worth as much as $30,000
at one point but is now only worth $2,000. When asked if he used any of his expendable
income to pay his delinquent taxes he responded, “As I have the extra money, I throw it
that  way.”  (Tr.  63)  When  asked  why  he  only  paid  about  $100  quarterly  towards  the
delinquent taxes he said, “We still live and do other things with the money that’s left over.”
(Tr. 63) He has had no financial counseling. He thought he was about 90 days delinquent
on a payment for a credit card. (Tr. 54-66)
Three  character  witnesses  testified  on  Applicant’s  behalf.  He  is  described  as  a
good person who would not compromise himself in a security situation. He is a problem-
solver and trusted. He has integrity and is loyal and dependable. (Tr. 72-92)
Any derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will not be considered
for disqualifying purposes. It may be considered in the application of mitigating conditions,
in making a credibility determination, and in a whole-person analysis.
