duty in the U.S. military from 1995 until he was honorably discharged in 2003. He has a
100%  disability  rating  from  the  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  (VA).  He  earned  a

Applicant  was  arrested  in  about  2013  and  charged  with  the  felony  offense  of
criminal injury to a child.  He stated that he thought he was arrested in February 2013.
He stated that the charge was based on an allegation made by his former spouse. The
charge  was  dismissed  in  April  2015  due  to  “prosecutorial  discretion.”  There  is  no
independent evidence (e.g., FBI identification record, police report, court documents) to
determine  exactly  when  he  was  arrested  or  the  validity  of  the  charge.  (Tr.1  at  31-34;
Tr.2 at 12-15; AE B)
Applicant  lost  a  job  in  about  2015  when  he  was  unable  to  obtain  a  security
clearance. There is no evidence that his clearance was formally “denied.”  He received
unemployment compensation. (Tr.1 at 25-31; Applicant’s response to SOR)
Applicant  worked  for  a  company  from  about  2016  to  January  2019.  He  was
driving  a  company  truck  in  2018  when  he  had  a  minor  accident.  He  stated  that  a  tire
blew  out,  which  caused  him  to  hit  a  guardrail.  He  was  counseled  in  writing.  He  had
another accident in about January 2019. He stated that he swerved to miss a deer and
hit a guardrail. He was called in by his supervisor who told him that he was being fired
for the second accident. He was permitted to resign in lieu of being fired. (Tr.1 at 39-40;
Tr.2 at 10-12; GE 1)
Applicant has a history of financial problems, including child support arrearages,
delinquent  debts,  and  unpaid  taxes.  He  filed  a  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  case  in  about
November  2014.  (SOR  ¶  2.a)  The  case  was  dismissed  in  2015.  (Tr.1  at  35,  41-42;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3, 4)
Applicant admitted for the first time during his hearing in December 2022 that he
owed the IRS about $23,000 in unpaid taxes. (SOR ¶ 2.k) He stated that the IRS started
garnishing  his  wages  $1,600  per  month  in  October  2022.  He  stated  that  the  problem
went  back  about  three  to  four  years  and  occurred  because  he  and  his  ex-wife  both
claimed their three children as exemptions. He retained a tax attorney to assist him. The
amount  of  about  $23,000  and  the  $1,600  per  month  garnishment  were  worked  out
between  his  attorney  and  the  IRS.  He  stated  that  he  planned  to  pay  his  back  taxes
within a month. (Tr.1 at 58-68)
Applicant  testified  during  the  second  hearing  that  he  paid  the  back  taxes.  He
stated  that  he  made  a  lump-sum  payment  after  the  first  hearing.  He  did  not  provide
proof  of  the  payment  nor  any  documents  from  the  IRS,  but  he  submitted  an  account
overview  from  his  attorney  that  may  have  been  derived  from  IRS  tax  account
transcripts. The overview does not show that Applicant currently owes the IRS. It does
show  that  federal  income  tax  returns  were  not  filed  in  2009,  2013,  2015,  or  2016.1  It
also showed that the 2017 federal return was not filed until January 2022, and the 2018
federal  return  was  not  filed  until  July  2021.  Applicant  testified  that  he  filed  his  federal
returns on time, and that the document was incorrect. (Tr.2 at 22-24; AE G)
Applicant had child support arrearages. The March 2020  combined credit report
showed past-due accounts  with balances  of $22,554 (SOR  ¶  2.b) reported  by Equifax
and  Experian,  and  $6,949  (SOR  ¶  2.c)  reported  by  Equifax.  The  May  2021  Experian
credit report shows the first account with a balance of $22,289. The second account is
not listed on that report. Applicant stated that he is current on his child support for all his
children.  He  provided  documentation  showing  he  was  current on  the  $22,554  account
as of January 2023. The $6,949 account had been reduced to $151 as of January 2023.
(Tr.1 at 41-44; AE D)
Applicant was the cosigner on a vehicle that was repossessed in 2014 or 2015.
The  credit  reports  show  that  the  creditor  charged  off  $9,117  in  September  2015.  The
balance  is  listed  as  $13,378  (SOR  ¶  2.d).  He  stated  that  he  thought  the  account  was
resolved when the vehicle was auctioned. He has not made any payments toward the
deficiency balance. (Tr.1 at 44-45)
1  The SOR did not allege that Applicant failed to file his federal income tax returns. Any matter that was
not alleged in the SOR cannot be used for disqualification purposes. It may be  considered in assessing
Applicant’s credibility, in the application of mitigating conditions, and in the whole-person analysis.
SOR  ¶  2.h  alleges  a  $196  utilities  debt.  Applicant  wrote  in  his  response  to  the
SOR that the balance was $0. He testified in December 2022 that he resolved the debt,
but  he  was  unsure  when.  He  paid  the  debt  on  January  12,  2023.  (Tr.1  at  49-50;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3, 4; AE A)
SOR  ¶  2.i  alleges  a  $190  utilities  debt.  Applicant  wrote  in  his  response  to  the
SOR that the balance was $0. He paid the debt in August or September 2022. (Tr.1 at
50; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3, 4; AE H)
SOR  ¶¶  1.e,  1.f,  1.g,  and  1.j  allege  delinquent  debts  of  $579,  $572,  $226,  and
$116. Applicant asserted that the debts were paid. The debts are all listed on the March
2020  combined  credit  report.  Only  the  $116  debt  is  listed  on  the  May  2021  Experian
credit report. (Tr.1 at 45, 50-51; GE 3, 4)
Applicant stated that his current financial situation is sound. Between his salary,
his wife’s salary, and his VA disability payments of about $3,500 per month, he is able
to  pay  all  his bills.  He has  two  2022 vehicles  for which  he pays about $815 and $650
per  month.  He  stated  in  the  first  hearing  that  he  had  almost  $30,000  in  the  bank.  His
bank statement showed that he had $2,212 in his checking account and $23,014 in his
savings account. (Tr.1 at 51-58; AE C)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
March 2020. There were several things not reported, such as some of his employment,
his children, his 2013 arrest and charge of criminal injury to a child, his 2014 Chapter 13
bankruptcy  case,  his  2019  counseling  and  resignation  in  lieu  of  termination,  and  his
unpaid  taxes.  Applicant  denied  intentionally  providing  false  information  under  all  the
questions, except the question about unpaid taxes. He admitted that he intentionally did
not  report  his  unpaid  taxes  because  he  thought  he  would  lose  his  job  if  he  reported
them. (Tr.1 at 25-38, 63-64; Tr.2 at 7-8, 16-21; GE 1)
