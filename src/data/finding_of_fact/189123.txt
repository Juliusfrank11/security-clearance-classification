Applicant is a  64-year-old prospective  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He will

Applicant has a history of criminal conduct. He was arrested in 1979 and charged
with  burglary of a building.  He  was found guilty,  but  the  conviction  was  set aside, and

SOR; GE 3)
During his background interview in February 2021, Applicant stated that he was
in a car with three friends, when two of his friends decided to burglarize an electronics
store. He stated that he and one of the friends did not want to be involved and stayed in
the  car  while  his  two  friends  burglarized  the  store.  He  confirmed  the  accuracy  of  the
interview in his undated response to interrogatories. At his hearing, he admitted that he
participated in the burglary. He stated that he  did not go  into the  store, but his friends
handed  the  stolen  items  to  him  through  the  broken  store  window.1  (Tr.  at  40-42;

Applicant was arrested in 1998 and charged with theft of property greater than or
equal to $1,500 and less than $20,000. He received a deferred adjudication. He stated
that a friend asked him to sell some computer hard drives for him. Applicant stated that
he  sold  the  hard  drives  without  realizing  they  were  stolen.  (Tr.  at  39-40;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 2, 3)

and reckless driving. He pleaded no contest to the DWI charge, and the reckless driving
charge was dismissed. (Tr. at 38; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 3)
Applicant was arrested in 2008 and charged with DWI, second offense. He was
found guilty and received probation.  He stated that he was stopped by the police after
he left bars in 2004 and 2008. He felt like he was in control during both occasions, and
that he could operate a vehicle. (Tr. at 38; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-4)
Applicant worked for a computer company for several years until he was laid off
in 2016. He stated that for about three years, he would take  damaged hard drives and
other pieces of computer equipment out of the company’s bin where the equipment was
placed  to  be  recycled.  He  stated  that  he  sold  the  equipment  as  scrap  to  a  recycling
company, and that he only received about $200 over the course of  three years for the
items.  The  theft  was  discovered  after  the  recycling  company  sold  the  parts to  another

party,  who  sold  them  as  new  or  restored  parts.  The  FBI  was  involved  in  the
investigation,  which  led  back  to  Applicant’s  participation  in  the  theft  and  sale  of  the
computer parts. (Tr. at 16-20, 28-32; GE 2)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  April  2017  and  charged  with  theft  of  property  greater
than or equal to $30,000 and less than $150,000. He received a deferred adjudication in
January  2019  in  which  he  would  be  on  community  supervision  (probation)  for  seven
years, and he is required to pay $32,000 in restitution, costs, and fees. He is eligible for
early termination from probation after four years if the restitution is completed.  He was
paying $600 per month, but he had to decrease the payments when he was laid off in
May 2022. He made a $500 payment in January 2023. He paid a total of $21,965 and
still owes $8,265. (Tr. at 17-23, 33-37, 42; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-4; AE I,

Applicant  has  been  unemployed  since  he  was  laid  off  in  May  2022.  He  stated
that he does contract work, and he had periods between contracts when he was unable
to pay his debts. (Tr, at 20-21, 24, 48-49; GE 2, 6-8)
The SOR alleges six delinquent debts. However, the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 3.b
and 3.c are duplicate accounts. The non-duplicate debts are established through credit
reports and Applicant’s admissions.
Applicant asserted that the debts in SOR ¶¶ 3.a ($6,477), 3.b ($4,798), and 3.c
($3,001) are duplicate accounts. As indicated above, SOR ¶¶ 3.b and 3.c are duplicate
accounts, but the evidence does not support that SOR ¶ 3.a is a duplicate account. The
names,  amounts,  and  account  numbers  are  all  different.  The  SOR  ¶  3.a  account  is
listed  on  all  of  the  credit  reports  in  evidence.  Applicant  provided  pages  from  what
appears  to  be  a  credit  report  to  support  his  position,  but  the  documents  show  the
opposite. He wrote that the pages show that he paid $79% of the loan, and the account
was closed in May 2018. The pages show that the loan was charged off and closed in
May 2018. The page shows a balance of $6,477 on a $3,600 loan, and that he “paid off
-79%  of  the  loan.”  Applicant  did  not  account  for  the  negative  sign  in  front  of  “79%.”
There  is  no  evidence  that  he  has  made  any  payments  toward  the  debt.  (Tr.  at  42-45;

Applicant  has  been  paying  $66  per  month  on  the  SOR  ¶¶  3.b/3.c  debt  since
March 2019. Credit reports indicate the balance was reduced from $4,798 to $3,001 to
$1,801 as of January 2023. (Tr. at 21-22; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE  6-8; AE A,
D, E)
Applicant paid in full the $613 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 3.d, with payments of $491
and $122 completed in June 2022. He paid in full the $419 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 3.e,
with  a  payment  of  $273  completed  in  January  2023.  He  paid  in  full  the  $147  medical
debt (SOR ¶ 3.g) in May 2022. (Tr. at 22, 45-48; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 6-8;
AE A, F-H, J, K, O)
Applicant stated that he thought he paid or is  paying all of his delinquent debts.
His layoff in May 2022 affected his ability to pay all of his debts. In about July 2021, he
bought  a  new  vehicle  financed  with  an  auto  loan  of  about  $56,800,  with  monthly
payments of $961 for 75 months. (Tr. at 49-51; GE 6)
