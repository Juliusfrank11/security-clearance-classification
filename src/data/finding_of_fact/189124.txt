Applicant,  34,  has  worked  for  a  federal  contractor  as  a  supply  chain  specialist
since January 2018. He served in the U.S. Army Reserve from April 2009 to April 2017
but  did  not  have  access  to  classified  information.  He  completed  his  first  security
clearance  application  in  March  2021.  He  did  not  disclose  any  derogatory  information.
The investigation discovered derogatory financial information that was ultimately alleged
in  the  SOR.  The  SOR  alleged  that  he  filed  for  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  protection  in
September 2019 (SOR ¶ 1.a); that he owed $23,567 on two charged-off accounts (SOR
¶¶ 1.b – 1.c); that he owed one collection account for $773 (SOR ¶ 1.j); and that he had
six delinquent student loans ($25,308, SOR ¶¶ 1.d. – 1.i). (GE 2-5)
In an August 2021 interview with a background investigator, Applicant discussed
the origin of his financial problems and his decision to file for bankruptcy protection. He
explained  that  he  began  to  experience  financial  problems  after  March  2017  when  he
was  laid  off  from  his  full-time  security  job  at  a  casino.  He  experienced  additional
financial stress, because he was also providing financial support to his father. According
to the March 2021 security clearance application, Applicant had two sources of income
between 2009 and 2017, the first being from his full-time security job at a casino and the
second from his reserve duty. Since separating from the Army Reserve in April 2017, he
has had only one source of income from his full-time employment. (GE 2-3)
Applicant  decided  to  file  for  bankruptcy  protection  in  September  2019  because
his debt load was overwhelming, not because he was delinquent on any of his financial
obligations. On the bankruptcy application, he  reported monthly  income of $4,248 and
monthly expenses of $3,930, leaving him with only $300 in disposable monthly income,
and $89,153 in total liabilities. The court dismissed the bankruptcy in  November 2019,
because he failed to pay the required filing fee. He subsequently retained an attorney to
assist  him  with  the  bankruptcy  filing.  In  2021,  after  Applicant  completed  the  security
clearance  application,  his  attorney  filed  a  motion  to  vacate  the  bankruptcy  dismissal.
(GE 1,3,5)
When  Applicant  was  asked  during  his  August  2021  interview  why  he  did  not
disclose  the  2019  bankruptcy  on  his  March  2021  security  clearance  application,  he
denied  having  any  intent  to  withhold  information  from  the  Government.  He  explained
that he did not disclose it because the bankruptcy was never processed but dismissed.
The relevant question, Section 26: Financial Record asks, “In the last seven (7) years
have you ever filed a petition under any chapter of the bankruptcy code?” (GE 2-3)
The  investigator  also  asked  Applicant  why  he  did  not  disclose  any  delinquent
debts on the security clearance application. He further explained that he was unaware
that  any  of  his  debts  were  delinquent  or  in  collection  status.  Section  26:  Delinquency
Involving  Routine  Accounts  asks,  “In  the  last  seven  (7)  years  have  you  had:  any
voluntary repossessions; defaulted on any type of loan; had bills or debts turned over to
a  collection  agency;  any  account  charged  off;  been  over  120  days  delinquent  on  any
debt on previously reported; or, currently 120 days delinquent on any debt? (GE 2-3)
In the background interview, Applicant admitted to having the vehicle financed by
the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c voluntarily repossessed and owing the alleged deficiency
balance of $10,622. The interview does not state when the voluntary repossession. The
debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b ($12,945) is for a car loan, and the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.j
($773)  is  for  a  credit  card.  Applicant  told  the  investigator  that  he  stopped  paying  both
debts  because  he  could  no  longer  afford  them.  The  June  2021  credit  report  indicates
that all three accounts were charged off. (GE 3,5)
In  Applicant’s  Answer to  the  SOR,  he  included  documentation  showing  that  the
Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition was discharged in October 2021. The consumer accounts
alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, and 1.j were among the discharged debts. He also included
in his bankruptcy petition $28,000 in student loans, alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.d through 1.i.
Student loans are not typically discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy. In the August 2021
interview, he stated that he placed the loans in a status that did not require payment. At
the  time  of  the  interview,  he  reported  making  $200  monthly  payments  towards  the
loans.  The  record  does  not  contain  any  evidence  to  corroborate  that  claim.  The  June
2021 credit report indicates that the loans are in collection status. (GE 1,3,5)
Applicant’s  loans,  which  are  all  held  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  Education,  are
currently  in administrative  forbearance under the student  loan  payment  pause  initiated
by President Biden in March 2020. The payment pause stopped collection activities on
defaulted student loans. For the duration of the pause, which is expected to last through
August 2023, the loans are considered in good standing. Applicant did not articulate a

Applicant attributes his financial problems to insufficient income, not extravagant
spending, or financial irresponsibility. According to the financial information provided in
the subject interview, he earns sufficient income to cover his living expenses, including
his  child  support  obligation.  However,  he  only  has  $200  in  disposable  income  each
month. (GE 3)
