Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  allegations  in  the  SOR.  I  have  incorporated  his
admissions into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings,
testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is 56  years old.  He served in  the military from  1986 to 2011  and  was
honorably retired. He married in 1986 and divorced in 2014. He has three children, ages
33,  28  and  26.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2017.  He  has  not  experienced  any
periods of unemployment and has worked for the same government contractor since his
2011 military retirement. (Tr. 16-21)
The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  is  indebted  to  the  federal  government  for
delinquent federal income taxes, The allegations (Sugg) are supported by tax transcripts
from December 2021. (GE 2) The debts are as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a  – tax year 2015 ($1,197)
SOR ¶ 1.b  – tax year 2016 ($668)
SOR ¶ 1.c – tax year 2017 ($8,198)
SOR ¶ 1.d  – tax year 2018 ($1,728
SOR ¶ 1.e  – tax year 2019 ($5,712)
SOR ¶ 1.f  – tax year 2020 ($6,536)
In October 2020, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA). In it
he disclosed that he owed delinquent federal income taxes for 2015, 2018, and 2020. He
said  they  were  delinquent  because  he  was  paying  his  child’s  student  loans  and  other
obligations.  For  his  2015  tax  debt  he  said  he  would  start  making  $500  payments  by
October 2019. (Presumably he meant 2020.) For tax year 2018 he said he would make
restitution by the end of the year (2020). For tax year 2020, he would be making monthly
payments of $700 because his financial situation had settled down and he would begin in
October 2020. (GE 1)
Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator in April 2021. He told the
investigator that he owed taxes for every tax year since his divorce because he did not
have  enough  money  to  pay  them.  He  said  he  was  not  earning  enough,  and  he  was
financially overextended. He said he paid his tax bill through 2016, but still owed 2017
through 2020. He received notices from the IRS about his taxes debts but did not respond
because  he  knew  he  owed  money.  He  had  an  installment  agreement  with  the  IRS  a
couple of years earlier, but he failed to maintain the monthly payments. He was hoping to
refinance his home to reduce his mortgage and use the extra money to pay his taxes.
(GE 2)
Applicant testified that tax year 2011 was the first year he owed taxes when he
filed his return. He did not have enough money withheld from his income to cover his tax
debt. This continued for tax years 2012 and 2013. It is unknown if he owed federal income
taxes for tax year 2014. Each subsequent tax year he owed taxes and was unable to pay.
He attributed it to having a new house, three children and their expenses, and his 2014
divorce. (Tr. 26-28
Applicant testified that in 2012 he hired an accountant to prepare his tax returns,
which  were  electronically  filed.  He  had  no  explanation  for why  he did  not  pay  them  or
change his withholdings each year to cover the amount he would owe. He said he did not
discuss  it  with  his  accountant.  Each  year,  he  would  drop  off  his  tax  information  to  his
accountant  who  would  prepare  his  returns. Applicant  would  sign  the  returns,  and  they
would be filed electronically. He was aware he owed taxes each year and received notices
from the IRS. He did not pay his taxes, and he did not execute a payment plan with the
IRS. (Tr. 35-41)
Applicant provided tax transcripts from December 2022 for tax years 2015, 2016,
2017, and 2018, which show he has a zero-balance owed for each year. He only provided
the first two pages of the transcripts, so the tax history is unknown. For tax years 2019 he
owes $4,287 and 2020 he owes $7,067. Applicant testified that he also owes taxes for
tax year 2021 of about $6,000. He estimated he would owe about the same amount of
$6,000 for tax year 2022, which was not due at the time of his hearing. (AE B-G)
Applicant testified that he also did not pay his taxes in 2012 and 2013 because he
was going through a divorce, he had a new house, and he had expenses associated with
his  children,  such  as  the  prom.  During  their  marriage,  his  wife  worked  full-time.  He
divorced in 2014 and he was not required to pay spousal support. His ex-wife waived her
right to receive 50% of his military retirement pay. He received the house in the divorce
settlement and was not required to pay her any of the equity in the house. They split the
joint  debts  where  he  paid  70%  and  she  paid  30%.  He  said  after  his  divorce  he  was
depressed, overwhelmed, and shut down mentally. He received notices from the IRS in
the mail about his delinquent taxes and the amount owed. He claimed he made maybe
four or five sporadic payments towards his tax debts. (Tr. 29-34, 54-59, 74; AE D)
In 2017, Applicant completed his bachelor’s degree, which was financed through
student  loans.  He  estimated  he  owed  approximately  $28,000  for  student  loans.  He
testified that when his student loans became due, he did not pay them and defaulted. He
said  he  was  busy  paying  other  bills.  The  creditor  contacted  him  in  2021,  and  he
consolidated the loans in July 2021. He said he then made an agreement to pay $124 a
month. The student loans have been deferred due to the pandemic. He anticipated  he
would start making the payments before the deferment is canceled. (Tr. 42-52)
Applicant stated that he was promoted to a new position sometime in 2021 or 2022
and was earning more money. He testified that he delayed paying his tax debt because
he was paying other bills that he had fallen behind on, such as consumer debts to stores
and car payments, and he was making a payment plan for his student loans. His income
has been stable and has been on an upward trend over the years. (Tr. 42-43, 52-54)
On  February  9,  2022,  the  day  after  providing  an  answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant
made four payments to the IRS. A payment of $1,201 for tax year 2015; $671 for tax year
2016, $8,335 for tax year 2017, and $1,735 for tax year 2018. He testified that he had not
made any payments for taxes owed from 2015 through 2020  before then. He had this
money  in  his  savings  account  as  an  emergency  fund.  He  said  he  did  not  make  this
payment earlier because he is a contractor and could lose his job at any time, so this was
held in reserve. He also entered into an installment agreement with the IRS to begin in
March 2022 to make $1,200 monthly payments toward his total tax debt. He provided a
copy of the agreement and receipts to show he has made consistent payments since April
2022 and the plan is current.  The plan states it includes tax years 2013 through 2020.
Post-hearing  Applicant  provided  a  transcript  from  April  2023  for  tax  year  2013,  which
shows he resolved the tax debt for 2013. (Tr. 24-26, 41, 63-68, 73; Answer to the SOR;
AE A, H, J, M, N)
When  asked  what his plans were  for paying  what he  anticipated  would  be  a  $6,000
tax debt for 2022,  he  said he  would  try  and  pay it,  but if  it  is this amount,  he  will  be  unable
to  pay it  in full. He  said  he  would  add  it  to  the balance he owed  and continue making the
$1,200   monthly  payments   as  part  of   his  installment   agreement   with   the   IRS.  He
anticipated  that penalties and  interest  would be  added  to  his 2022  tax debt.  (Tr. 26,  66-
73
Applicant provided an IRS document that shows the total balance he owes as of
April  2023  is  $14,698.  It  reflects  he  owes  $824  for  tax  year  2019,  $7,239  for  tax  year
2020, and $6,633 for tax year 2021. (AE A)
The SOR alleged a charged-off account for a repossessed vehicle in the amount
of $12,744. Applicant cosigned a car loan for his daughter in 2014. She failed to pay the
loan. He returned the vehicle to the creditor. He did not follow up on the debt until after
he spoke with the government investigator and then he contacted the creditor. Applicant
testified that he was told by the creditor that the car was sold for more than the loan owed,
so he did not have a deficiency balance. He did not believe he has an outstanding debt
with  the  creditor.  He  provided  a  letter  from  the  collection  company  that  held  the  loan
stating his payment obligation had been fulfilled and there was no balance owed.  This
debt is resolved. (Tr. 59-62; GE 3; Answer to the SOR)
Applicant anticipated making his last payment of $625 on a car loan in April 2023
for his 2017 vehicle. In October 2021, he purchased a truck for $43,000 and has monthly
payments of $815. He is paying his daughter’s student loans. He will pay his student loans
when they are no longer deferred. He has about $2,800 in his accounts. He mother moved
in  with  him  in  2019.  She  has  a  pension,  receives  Social  Security  payments  and  is  on
Medicare. She pays her own expenses, except for food, which Applicant pays.  (Tr. 23,
76-94)
Any derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will not be considered
for disqualifying purposes. It may be considered when making a credibility determination,
in the application of mitigating conditions, and in a whole-person analysis.
Applicant’s  ex-wife  testified  on  his  behalf.  She  said  Applicant  had  financial
difficulties  after  their  divorce.  He  was  helping  the  children  and  fell  behind  on  his
obligations  and  this  should  not  reflect  on  his  good  character.  He  may  not  have  been
proactive on his finances, but he is loyal, trustworthy, and responsible. His past military
service should be considered. He is a good father, brother, and son. He is correcting his
problems and moving forward. (Tr. 102-106)
