Applicant is a 50-year-old employee of a government contractor for whom he has
worked  since  June  2009.  He  is  twice  divorced.  He  was  married  from  1996  until  2007
and  from  2010  until  2012.  He  has  been  remarried  since  March  2017.  He  has  two
children from his first marriage, ages 21 and 19. He also has a three-year-old child from
his current marriage. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2004 and a master’s degree in
2013. He served on active duty with the Air Force from 1992 until 2000, when he earned
an  honorable  discharge.  He  has  held  a  security  clearance  since  1992.  Prior  to  the
issuance of the SOR, he claimed that he had not had any issues related to his security
clearance. (Tr. 46-50, 66-67, 93-94; GE 1, 8; AE A, B)
In  the  SOR,  the  Government  alleged  Applicant’s  five  delinquent  debts  totaling
approximately  $75,000  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.e).  These  delinquencies  consist  of
federal student loans (SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.d) and a small credit-card balance (SOR ¶
1.e).  He  admitted  the  SOR  allegations  with  additional  comments.  His  admissions  are
adopted  as  findings  of  fact.  The  SOR  allegations  are  established  through  his
admissions and the Government’s credit reports. (SOR; Answer, GE 2-6)
The delinquent federal student loans totaling about $75,000 listed in SOR ¶¶ 1.a
through 1.d are being resolved. Applicant opened these student loans in about 2011 to
finance  his  master’s  degree  classes.  He  defaulted  on  his  student  loans  because  of  a
2013 increase in his child support obligation from about $250 to about $1,800 per month
for his two children from his first marriage. (Tr. 50-56, 65, 67-68, 72-82, 93-94; Answer;
GE 1-8; AE H-K)
In 2013, when Applicant knew he might have financial difficulties, the Department
of Education (DOE) granted  his request for a three-year deferment of his student loan
payments.  He  became  delinquent  on  these  loans  in  about  May  2016  when  his
deferment  period  ended.  He  acknowledged  that  he  knew  he  was  delinquent  in  May
2016.  Sometime  in  early  2017,  he  contacted  the  DOE  and  entered  a  payment
arrangement to have $500 per month directly debited from his debit card. Later in 2017,
this debit card became invalid, but he did not update his form of payment with the DOE,
so  he  defaulted  on  his  payment  arrangement.  He  did  not  update  his  payment
information because he could not afford the $500 payments at that time. (Tr. 50-56, 65,
67-68, 72-82, 97; Answer; GE 1-8; AE H-K)
Beginning  in  March  2020,  all  federal  student  loans  were  placed  in  deferment
status  because  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  Applicant  defaulted  on  his  student  loans
prior  to  their  placement  in  this  deferment  status.  Applicant  provided  documentary
evidence  that,  in  March  2023,  he  entered  into  a  Fresh  Start  agreement  with  the  DOE
whereby his student loans were removed from a default status, placed back into good
standing, and transferred to a loan service provider. He did not attempt to resolve these
student loans between 2017 and March 2023. He testified that, despite his child support
payment ending in May 2022, he waited until March 2023 to address his student loans
because he was addressing other unspecified credit cards first. He acknowledged that
the risk of losing his security clearance factored into his decision to resolve his student
loans. Credit reports corroborate that the student loan accounts are current. He claimed
he has since made arrangement  with his loan service provider to pay $720 per month
beginning in October 2023. He made his first payment to his loan service provider in the
amount  of  $1,200  ahead  of  schedule  on  April  24,  2023.  He  claimed  he  will  set  up
automatic withdrawals to make these payments each month, but he cannot do so until
his monthly payments are scheduled to begin. (Tr. 50-56, 65, 67-68, 72-82, 93-94, 97;

The delinquent  credit card  in the amount of $162 alleged  in SOR ¶  1.e has not
been resolved. Applicant claimed that he believes his first spouse opened this account
without his consent at the tail end of his marriage to her. He claimed that in March 2023,
he  called  the  creditor  to  try  to  resolve  the  account,  but  they  could  not  find  it  in  their
system. He acknowledged that the risk of losing his security clearance factored into his
decision  to  attempt  to  resolve  this  debt.  He  has  taken  no  other  action  to  resolve  this
account.  The  credit  reports  reflect  that  this  account  was  opened  in  2003  (four  years
before  his  divorce  from  his  first  wife).  This  account  appears  on  the  August  2020,
October  2020,  and  March  2021  credit  reports.  It  does  not  appear  on  the  December
2021  or  March  2023  credit  reports.  The  March  2021  credit  report  reflects  a  May  2014
last activity date for this account, so the account may have aged off the December 2021
and  March  2023  credit  reports.  He  testified  that  he  should  have  been  consistently
checking his credit reports so he would have known about this account. He claimed that
he now regularly checks his credit reports. He claimed that he can afford to pay off the
account and he would have done so if the creditor could locate the account. (Tr. 60-62,
83-86, 98; Answer; GE 2-4, 7, 8)
Applicant testified that when he realized his first marriage was ending and that he
might have financial issues, he downsized his home and traded in his car for one that
was  less  expensive.  He  acknowledged  that  he  made  a  mistake  in  not  communicating
his financial issues with the student loan service provider or the DOE. He also testified
that he realizes that he should have immediately tried to make a payment arrangement
on his student loans instead of ignoring them. His child support obligation ended in May
2022, freeing up about $1,800 in monthly income. He claims that he has enough money
to pay all his bills and he will pay them.  The March 2023 credit report does not reflect
any  delinquent  debts.  He  provided  a  written  monthly  budget  that  reflects  a  monthly
surplus  of  $1,354.  His  budget  does  not  reflect  his  student  loan  payments  or  the
approximately $400 per month he provides to his ageing parents, which will significantly
reduce  his  surplus.  Despite  his  omission  of  these  significant,  regular  expenses,  he
testified that he has over a $1,000 surplus at the end of each month. (Tr. 51-60, 62-63,
68-72, 90-92; Answer; GE 6; AE E-G)
Applicant  and  his  spouse  have  a  savings  account  with  a  balance  of  about
$90,000. However, most of the money in this account is his wife’s, and he and his wife
have  declined  to  use  that  money  to  pay  his  individual  expenses  in  the  past.  He  has
been  contributing  about  $200  per  month  to  this  joint  savings  account  since  about
August 2022. For several months, this $200 monthly amount went directly towards a car
payment that was titled in his wife’s name. He testified that he did not use this money to
pay  toward  the  SOR  debts  because  he  did  not  believe  it  was  enough  for  a  payment
arrangement.   He   provided   statements   showing   that   he   had   three   individual  checking
accounts   with   balances  of  $1,211,  $3,741,   and   $425.  He   also   provided   documents
showing   that  he   earns   about  $3,800   every   two  weeks.  He  earns  about   $133,000   per
year.   While   he   was   in   default  on   his  student   loans,  he   took   several  international
vacations   that  he   claimed   that  his  wife   paid   for  with   her  money.   He  claimed   that  he
never asked his wife  to  help him  pay  his delinquencies because  they were  his debts.  He
has not undergone  any financial counseling  but claims he  is open  to  doing  so.  (Tr. 51-
60, 62-63, 68-72, 87-92, 94-96;  Answer; GE  6;  AE  E-G)
Applicant’s  former  supervisor  testified  that  Applicant  did  well  at  work  while  he
was reporting to her. She provided him a performance award for his work  and claimed
he  is  trustworthy,  a  good  person,  and  an  asset  to  their  employer.  A  colleague  of  his
testified that he shows integrity, accountability, and a strong work ethic. The colleague
also noted that he is an asset to their employer. She claimed that she  is aware that he
had financial issues after his divorce, but that he has recovered from those issues. She
thinks highly of him and his family. Both his former supervisor and his colleague opined
that  he  should  have  a  security  clearance.  He  has  received  positive  performance
reviews, promotions, and performance awards at work. (Tr. 32-45, 48-49; AE C, D)
