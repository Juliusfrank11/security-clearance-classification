Applicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his  current  employer  since  September  2022.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2009.
He is married with a child from the marriage, a child from a previous relationship, and a
stepchild. (Tr. at 21-23; GE 1, 4)
Applicant  had  financial  issues  about  10  to  12  years  ago  after  his  oldest  child’s
mother  moved  out.  He  worked  for  a  number  of  defense  contractors  in  the  same
geographic  area  from  2013  through  2021.  By  2020,  with  the  exception  of  his  student
loans,  his  finances  had  stabilized.  The  COVID-19  pandemic  adversely  affected  his
wife’s  employment.  He  was  working  remotely,  so  he  could  work  from  anywhere.  In
October  2021,  they  moved  to  a  state  with  better  financial  opportunities.  In  about
January 2022, Applicant lost his remote job when his employer required their workers to
return to the facility. He was unemployed until he obtained his current job in September
2022. (Tr. at 19-23, 26-28; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1-5; AE A)
The  SOR  alleges  three  defaulted  federal  student  loans  with  balances  totaling
about  $122,550;  $13,381  owed  for  a  timeshare;  a  credit  card  that  was  $928  past  due
with a $7,418 balance; and three debts to the same credit union that were past due for a
total of $1,474. The debts are listed on one or more credit reports.
Applicant’s federal student loans were in deferment until about 2017. He did not
realize that they were no longer deferred, and he did not pay them. His federal student
loan  payments  were  paused  pursuant  to  COVID-19  relief.  He  is  not  required  to  make
the  loan  payments.  The  pause  was  extended  several  times.  It  is  currently  extended
through June 2023. (Tr. at 25-37, 40-42; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE A, F)
Applicant’s  application  for  loan  relief  under  the  Student  Loan  Debt  Relief  Plan
was  approved.  Because  of  the  college  he  attended,  he  may  be  eligible  for  additional
relief.  A  number  of  lawsuits  were  filed  challenging  the  program.  The  Department  of
Education informed Applicant:
We reviewed your application and determined that you are eligible for loan
relief under the Plan. We have sent this approval on to your loan servicer.
You do not need to take any further action.
Unfortunately,  a  number  of  lawsuits  have  been  filed  challenging  the
program, which have blocked our ability to discharge your debt at present.
We believe strongly that the lawsuits are meritless, and the Department of
Justice  has  appealed  on  our  behalf.  Your  application  is  complete  and
approved,  and  we  will  discharge  your  approved  debt  if  and  when  we
prevail  in  court.  We  will  update  you  when  there  are  new  developments.

Applicant  has  consistently  and  credibly  denied  that  he  purchased  a  timeshare.
He  and  his  wife  traveled  to  Mexico  in  2019  for  the  sales  pitch,  but  he  insists  that  he
never signed a sales contract, and he only became aware of the debt when it appeared
on a credit report.  The debt is reported by TransUnion and Experian on the July 2020
combined credit report. He retained a company to help him dispute inaccurate items on
his credit report. The timeshare debt (SOR ¶ 1.b) is listed on the October 2022 Experian
credit report with the comment, “Consumer dispute following resolution.”  It is not listed
on the March 2023 Equifax credit report.” (Tr. at 21, 34, 37-40; Applicant’s response to
SOR; GE 2-5; AE A, E, F)
SOR ¶  1.e  alleges  a  credit card  debt  that  was $948  past due, with  a  balance  of
$7,418,   as  reflected   on   an   October 2022   credit  report.   This  account  was  listed   on   the
July 2020  combined  credit report  as  current with  a  $0  balance. Applicant used  the  card
for living expenses  while he  was unemployed.  He made  payment arrangements with  the
creditor  to   pay   $276   per  month,   starting   in   December  2022.   He  documented   that   he
made  $276  payments in  December  2022, January 2023, and  February 2023.  (Tr. at 43-
45; Applicant’s response  to  SOR;  GE  2-5; AE A, F)
SOR  ¶¶  1.f,  1.g,  and  1.h  allege  three  debts  to  the  same  credit  union  that  were
past  due  for  a  total  of  $1,474,  with  balances  totaling  about  $59,250,  as  listed  on  an
October 2022 credit report. The debts are for a credit card (SOR ¶ 1.f - $986 past due,
$43,845 balance),  an auto loan  (SOR ¶ 1.g - $439 past due, $12,882 balance), and a
line  of  credit  (SOR  ¶  1.h  - $986  past  due,  $2,522  balance).  None  of  the  three  debts
were reported as past due on the July 2020 credit report. Applicant contacted the credit
union. The auto loan and the line of credit accounts are now current, and the balances
have been reduced to $11,226 and $2,338. He plans to address the credit card account
next. (Tr. at 45-50; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE A, F)
Applicant’s  current  finances  are  better  since  he  returned  to  work.  He  has  not
received  formal  financial  counseling,  but  he  maintains  a  budget.  He  credibly  testified
that he plans to  continue to pay his debts, and he will pay his student loans when the
pause  is  over  and  the  lawsuit  is  resolved.  (Tr.  at  37,  50-58;  Applicant’s  response  to
SOR; GE 5; AE F)
Applicant volunteers in his church. He called a witness, and he submitted letters
attesting to his moral character. He is praised for his dependability, honesty, work ethic,
trustworthiness, and integrity. (Tr. at 58-62; AE B, C)
