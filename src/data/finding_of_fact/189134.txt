On  March  27,  2020,  the  Coronavirus  Aid,  Relief,  and  Economic  Security  Act
(CARES  Act)  became  law,  providing  for  relief  measures  on  Department  of  Education
(DoED)-owned federal student loans through September 30, 2020. See ISCR Case No.
20-02787 at 3 n.1 (App. Bd. Mar. 2022). This student loan debt relief received several
extensions.  In  March  2020,  as  a  result  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  the  President
directed  the  DoED  to  place  federal  student  loans  in  forbearance.  The  federal
government repeatedly extended the student loan payment pause. The pause includes
the  following  relief  measures  for  eligible  loans:  a  suspension  of  loan  payments;  a  0%
interest  rate;  and  stopped  collections  on  defaulted  loans.  See  Federal  Student  Aid
(FSA)  website,  https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19/.  On  February
25, 2023, the FSA website said:
The  student  loan  payment pause  is extended  until the  U.S.  Department of
Education   is  permitted   to   implement  the   debt  relief  program   or  the
litigation  is resolved.  Payments  will  restart 60  days  later. If  the  debt  relief
program   has  not  been   implemented   and   the   litigation   has  not  been
resolved by June  30, 2023  —  payments will resume 60 days after that. We
will notify borrowers before payments restart.
In  August 2022,  President Biden announced forgiveness of  $10,000  or $20,000
of  federal  student  loan  debt,  and  on  November  11,  2022,  the  DoED  said  they  would
continue  to  seek  forgiveness  of  student  loans.  See  “Statement  from  Secretary  of
Education  Miguel  Cardona  on  District  Court  Ruling  on  the  Biden-Harris  Administration
Student  Debt  Relief  Program,”  https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/statement-
