2021.  (AppX  N.)  Applicant’s  cohabitant  owns  a  studio  apartment  on  the  outskirts  of
Moscow worth about $90,000, which she is trying to sell. Her annual salary is between

Administrative  Notice
I  take  Administrative  Notice  of  the  following  facts  about  Russia:  The  Russian
Federation  has  a  highly  centralized  authoritarian  political  system  dominated  by
President Vladimir Putin. Russia violated Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity in
2014 and 2022. Russia  presents one of the most serious foreign threats to the United
States.
I take Administrative Notice of the following facts about Israel: The State of Israel
is  a  multi-parliamentary  democracy.  The  U.S.  Department  of  State  has  issued  travel
advisories  for  Israel.  Jerusalem  and  Tel  Aviv  have  been  assessed  as  HIGH-threat
locations  for  terrorism.  However,  Israel  has  been  the  United  States’  closest  ally  in  the
Middle East since it was founded in 1948.
