Having  thoroughly  considered  the  evidence  in  the  record,  including  Applicant's
admissions to all SOR allegations under Guidelines F and E, (¶¶ 1.a through 1.d, and
2.a.), I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant is 57 years old. After high school, he attended culinary arts school and
barber school. He married in 2002 and has four adult children.  Since December 2020,
he has been employed by a DOD contractor as an armed guard. He makes $17 an hour
and regularly works overtime. This is his first application for a DOD security clearance.
(Tr. 16-18, 49-50; GE 1)
Financial considerations:
The  SOR  alleges  four  delinquent  debts  totaling  $37,190,  and  the  record
establishes the status of Applicant’s accounts as follows:
SOR ¶  1.a  alleges that Applicant owes the Social Security Administration (SSA)
$25,554  for  an  overpayment  of  disability  benefits  referred  for  collection.  During  the
hearing,  Applicant  stated  he  received  disability  benefits  beginning  in  approximately
2008,  after  he  suffered  a  neck  injury  on  the  job  and  was  unable  to  work.  His  benefits
were extended after he had shoulder surgery. He listed on the January 2021 SCA that
he was self-employed as a barber from January 2008 through November 2019, during
the approximate ten-year period he received disability benefits. In about 2018, the SSA
determined Applicant no longer met the requirements to receive disability benefits, and
that he had been overpaid disability benefits for over two-and-one-half years. Applicant
appealed this decision and lost. He testified that he worked as a part-time barber from
2008 to 2019 in an effort to earn a little extra money. Since his neck injury in 2008, he
returned to a full-time job in November 2019 after he was hired by another employer as
a security guard. (Tr. 21-35-36; GE 2, 3; AE E, I)
During the hearing, Applicant agreed he received disability benefits for about ten
years. He received about $800 monthly from the SSA. When questioned about whether
he notified the SSA that he was working as a barber while he was considered disabled
and  unable  to  work,  he  responded,  “I’m  pretty  sure  I  did.”  The  SSA  determined  that
Applicant was required to repay the overpayment of disability benefits in the amount of
$25,554. In 2021, he requested the SSA forgive this debt. Applicant testified that he is
still waiting to hear from the SSA to see if this request will be granted. (Tr. 24-33; AE C)
Applicant first testified that he had been making monthly payments to the SSA for
about a year. Based on the evidence he provided, he actually made his first payment of
$100 to the SSA in September 2022. There is no other documentation to show he made
other payments to the SSA. Applicant was asked if he could provide documentation of
his  history  of  payments  and  the  date  he  notified  the  SSA  that  he  was  working  as  a
barber,  to  which  he  agreed.  No  documents  were  submitted  by  Applicant  while  the
record was held open. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 24-33; AE C)
SOR ¶  1.b alleges that Applicant owes a medical provider $6,851 for an account
referred  for  collection.  He  provided  documentation  with  his  SOR  response  that  in
September 2022, the creditor agreed to a settlement of 50% of the debt  in the amount
of $3,425. Applicant failed to provide a receipt showing that he paid the settlement, and
he  agreed  that  he  would  provide  supporting  documentation  while  the  record  was  held
open. He failed to submit documentation and this debt remains unresolved. (Tr. 36-38;
GE 6; AE B)
SOR ¶  1.c  alleges that Applicant owes a consumer credit card creditor $3,617 for
an  account  charged  off  as  a  bad  debt.  He  provided  documentation  with  his  SOR
response  that showed the creditor agreed to accept  a payment  of $1,900 to settle  the
account. In August 2022, a payment of $500 and two payments of $700 were accepted
by the creditor. This account has been settled. (Tr. 38-39; AE A)
SOR ¶ 1.d  alleges that Applicant owes a consumer credit card creditor $1,168 for
an  account  charged  off  as  a  bad  debt.  He  provided  documentation  with  his  SOR
response  showing  he  settled  this  account  (amount  unknown)  and  he  made  his  last
payment of $269 in December 2021 to resolve this account. (Tr. 39-41; GE 2; AE E)
In  November  2021,  Applicant  provided  a  personal  financial  statement  (PFS).  It
showed that he and his wife’s net monthly income totaled $9,067. After paying monthly
expenses, to include to one of his delinquent credit cards listed in SOR ¶ 1.d, they had
a  monthly  net  remainder  of  about  $1,340.  Immediately  after  the  hearing,  Department
Counsel provided Applicant a new PFS to complete because the 2021 PFS was dated.
Applicant  agreed  he  would  provide  the  updated  PFS  while  the  record  was  held  open.
He did not submit this information. (Tr. 49-54; GE 3)
Applicant  provided  contradictory  information  during  cross-examination  about
whether his federal and state income tax returns were filed for tax year (TY) 2021. He
stated that he and his wife had hired a consumer tax service to file their 2021 and 2022
income tax returns. He later claimed the 2021 federal and state income taxes were filed,
but  they  owed  delinquent  2021  income  taxes,  amount  unknown.  Department  Counsel
made a motion to amend the SOR, and Applicant was given two weeks to respond to
the  motion  and  provide  updated  tax  information  for  TY  2021.  He  did  not  provide  any
information  while  the  record  was  held  open.  I  granted  the  Government’s  motion  to
amend the SOR after the record closed. (SOR ¶ 1.e) (Tr. 54-56, 61-65)
Personal  conduct:
Applicant completed his SCA in January 2021. He did not disclose any adverse
financial  information  under  Section  26  of  the  application,  as  required.  (SOR  ¶  2.a)  He
was  interviewed  in  February  2021  by  an  authorized  DOD  investigator  during  his
background investigation. When asked if Applicant had any delinquent accounts within
the  last  seven  years,  he  said  “No.”  The  investigator  confronted  him  with  an  unpaid
$6,851  medical  account  and  two  charged-off  credit  card  accounts  totaling  $4,785.
Applicant denied any knowledge of the medical bill, but he did recognize the two credit
card  accounts.  He  was  unaware  that  both  credit  card  accounts  were  delinquent  since
his  wife  handled  the  finances  in  the  household.  The  investigator  also  confronted
Applicant  with the  account placed for collection  by the SSA  in  the amount of $25,554.
Applicant  stated  that  this  account  developed  due  to  an  overpayment  of  disability
benefits that were paid to him from approximately 2008 to 2018. He was notified by the
SSA  in  about  2018  of  the  overpayment  and  that  he  was  required  to  reimburse  this
federal  agency.  He  was  unaware  that  his  overpayment  account  was  referred  for
collection. (GE 2)
During  the  hearing  Applicant  testified  that  he  was  truthful  and  upfront  with  the
Government about his debt owed to the SSA. He thought he had listed it on the SCA,
but after reviewing the SCA during the hearing, he admitted that he had not disclosed it.
He also testified that when asked by the investigator if he had any delinquent debts, he
immediately told her about  the SSA overpayment  debt. He acknowledged  that he  was
confronted  by  the  delinquent  medical  and  credit  card  debts  because  he  was  unaware
that  these  accounts  were  delinquent.  Applicant  received  a  copy  of  his  background
interview  with  interrogatories  sent  to  him  by  the  Government,  and  in  May  2022,  he
acknowledged  that the background interview report accurately reflected information he
provided  during  the  February  2021  background  interview.  The  report  in  evidence
showed that Applicant was confronted about the SSA overpayment account and that he
did not voluntarily disclose this information when questioned about delinquent debts by
the investigator. (Tr. 41-49; GE 3)
