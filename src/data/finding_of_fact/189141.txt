Applicant is a 36-year-old employee of a government contractor for whom he has
worked since February 2021. He earned a high school diploma in 2004. He has never
been married  and has no  children. He  served  on active  duty  with the  Army  from  June
2004 until February 2014, when he earned an honorable discharge. He deployed three
times while he was in the Army. (Tr. 32-36, 61-62; GE 1, 2)
Applicant purchased and used marijuana with varying frequency from about 2017
until  November  2020.  Throughout  the  time  he  used  it,  marijuana  use  did  not  violate
state  law  in  State A, where  he resided.  However, marijuana use and possession  was,
and continues to be, illegal under federal law. He started using marijuana  to relax. He
either used it through a  vape pen or a  joint. His marijuana use  varied from one to two
hits on the weekend from 2017 until 2019, to daily use from February 2020 to November
2020.  He  stopped  using  marijuana  in  November  2020  because  he  realized  it  was  not
helping his mental state and because he was moving in with his aunt, who did not want
marijuana  in  her house.  He  noticed an  improvement  in  his mood and his mental state
within  days  of  ceasing  his  marijuana  use.  He  does  not  intend  to  use  marijuana  in  the
future as  he believes  it  is harmful to  his  mental  health.  (Tr. 26,  37-38, 47-49;  Answer;
GE 2)
In  the  SOR,  the  Government  alleged  Applicant’s  six  delinquent  debts  totaling
approximately  $16,000  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.f).  These  delinquencies  consist  of  an
overdrawn  bank  account  (SOR  ¶  1.a),  a  vehicle  loan  (SOR  ¶  1.b),  unpaid  automobile
insurance (SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.f), a utility (SOR ¶ 1.d), and a credit card (SOR ¶ 1.e). He
admitted the SOR allegations with additional comment. His admissions are adopted as
findings of fact. (SOR; Answer)
The overdrawn bank account in the amount of $11,469 alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a has
not  been  resolved.  Applicant  overdrew  this  account  when  he  quit  his  job  in  February
2020 and failed to stop previously scheduled automatic withdrawals. He claimed that he
thought the balance was inaccurate and, when he called the collection agency in June
2022,  it  allegedly  agreed  that  he  only  owed  $1,469.  On  June  10,  2022,  he  made  a
payment  of  $105  on  this  account.  He  provided  documentation  to  corroborate  this
payment.  He  did  not  provide  documentation  to  corroborate  the  lower  balance.  He  has
not taken additional action on this account after making the June 10, 2022 payment, but
he plans to do so in the future. (Tr. 26-28, 49-52, 71-72; Answer; GE 2-6; AE A)
The  delinquent  vehicle  loan  in  the  amount  of  $4,118  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.b  has
not been resolved. Applicant provided documentary evidence that, after the hearing, he
made  a  $100  payment  on  this  account  on  March  21,  2023.  The  account  became
delinquent  in  February  2019  when  he  voluntarily  surrendered  the  secured  collateral
because he could not afford to make the required payments. Prior to his March 21, 2023
payment,  he  last  made  a  payment  on  this  account  in  April  2020.  He  plans  to  make
payment on this account in the future. (Tr. 28-30, 58-61; Answer; GE 1-6; AE A)
The  delinquent  insurance  account  in  the  amount  of  $143  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.c
has  been  resolved.  Applicant  first  became  delinquent  on  this account  in  August  2020.
He paid this account in full in June 2022. He provided documentary corroboration of this
payment. The debt does not appear on the latest Government credit report. (Tr. 30-31,
52-53, 73-74; Answer; GE 2-5; AE A)
The  delinquent utility for internet services in the amount of $367 alleged  in SOR ¶
1.d  has   not   been   resolved.   Applicant   first   became   delinquent   on   this  account   in
December  2020.   He   claimed   that   he   paid  this  account  in   full,   but  he   only   provided
documentary  corroboration   of  a   $90   payment  in  September  2022.   He  claimed   that  he
thought  the   account  is  no   longer  delinquent  because   it  no   longer  appears  on   an
undisclosed   credit  report.   However,   the   debt   still   shows   as   delinquent   on   all   the
Government  credit reports.  (Tr. 30-31, 52-53, 74; Answer; GE 2-6; AE A)
The delinquent credit card in the amount of $682 alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e has been
resolved.  This  credit  card  became  delinquent  in  April  2020.  Despite  Applicant’s
testimony  that  he  does  not  believe  he  has  resolved  this  account,  two  of  the
Government’s  credit  reports  reflect  this  account  is  a  paid  charge-off  that  was  paid  in
June 2021. (Tr. 31, 53-55; Answer; GE 2-6)
The delinquent insurance account in the amount of $97 alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f has
been resolved. This account became delinquent in April 2021. Applicant claimed that he
paid  this  account  in  full  on  an  undisclosed  date.  He  provided  no  documentary
corroboration  of  a  payment.  However,  this  debt  appears  on  the  Government’s  April
2021 credit report, but not on the 2022 and 2023 Government credit reports. (Tr. 30-31,
52-53, 74; Answer; GE 2 and 3)
Applicant  attributed  his  financial  issues  to  several  causes.  He  was  unemployed
from February 2020 until December 2020  because  he quit his job while  suffering  from
depression  and  loneliness.  He  claimed  that his  credit  has  been  bad  his whole  life.  He
acknowledged that he does not pay sufficient attention to his finances partly because he
does not care enough about them. While it is not alleged in the SOR, he has had two
additional vehicles repossessed in the past. Any adverse information not alleged in the
SOR,  such  as  Applicant’s  additional  vehicle  repossessions,  will  not  be  considered  for
disqualification  purposes;  however,  it  may  be  considered  in  assessing  an  applicant’s
credibility;  in  evaluating  an  applicant’s  evidence  of extenuation, mitigation,  or changed
circumstances;  in  considering  whether  the  applicant  has  demonstrated  successful
rehabilitation; and in applying the whole-person concept. (ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3
(App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017)). He claimed that he will pay off the delinquent SOR accounts
in the future, but he also made such claims multiple times beginning as early as March
2021. (Tr. 28-30, 38-46, 55-58, 60-61, 76-77; Answer; GE 1 and 2)
Since  February  2021,  Applicant’s  take-home  pay  has  been  about  $3,600  per
month. He does not follow a budget and did not provide evidence that he has received
financial counseling. He pays his father $500 per month for rent and a phone. He pays
$600  per month  on  a  car  that  he  purchased  via  financing  in  April 2022,  and  $220  per
month for auto insurance. He claimed that he has about $1,000 to $1,500  left over per
month after paying his bills, but he acknowledged that he has no money in his savings
account, lives paycheck to paycheck, and does not save any money. On the day of the
hearing,  he  had  about  $1,700  in  his  checking  account,  as  he  had  just  received  his
paycheck. He has about $2,000 in a retirement account. (Tr. 63-71)
