Applicant is a 52-year-old radiation technician employed by a defense contractor
since October 2019. She seeks a clearance in conjunction with her current employment.
(Item  2)  [Note  –  In  her  response  to  the  FORM,  Applicant  submitted  a  draft  copy  of  a
letter of  resignation  to her employer. She  stated  that  she had  not submitted that  letter
pending a meeting with her contract manager. (Items 6, 21)]
Applicant  graduated  from  high  school  in  June  1988.  She  was  awarded  an
associate  degree  and  a  certificate  in  radiation  technology  in  May  1995.  Applicant  was
married from July 1992 to July 1996. That marriage ended by divorce. She remarried in
August 2011. She has a minor daughter from her second marriage. (Item 2)
Financial Considerations
Applicant’s  16  delinquent  SOR  debts,  totaling  approximately  $14,904,  are
established  by  her  July  7,  2021  SF-86;  her  August  25,  2021  and  September  8,  2021
Office of Personnel Management Personal Subject Interviews (OPM PSIs); her July 9,
2021 and April 4, 2022 credit reports; and her September 19, 2022 SOR Answer. (SOR
¶¶  1.a  through  1.p;  Items  1-5)  Applicant  admitted  each  allegation  except  SOR  ¶  1.f,
which  she  claimed  is  not  hers.  However,  in  her  post-FORM  response,  she  accepted
responsibility  for  this  debt.  Broken  down,  her largest  debt  was  for a  charged-off  credit
union account for $10,720, a department store collection account for $569, a cell phone
collection account for $92, and 13 medical copay collection accounts in various smaller
amounts.
Applicant attributed her financial problems to: (1) providing 13 months of support
to  her  stepfather,  who  appeared  on  her  doorstep  homeless  just  before  the  COVID-19
pandemic; (2) her husband’s unemployment or underemployment as a kitchen installer
during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown; and (3) uncovered medical costs associated
with  her  daughter’s  eye  surgery.  (Items  1,  10,  14,  20)  Applicant  described  herself  as
being  a  “hot  mess”  on  paper.  She  accepted  responsibility  for  her  financial  situation
stating,  “I’m  not  going  to  make  excuses.  I  accepted  full  responsibility.  I  think  I  could
have handled this better by talking with creditors about options, this is all my fault.” (Item
10)
During  Applicant’s  OPM  PSIs,  she  discussed  her
financial  situation  with  the
investigator  and  acknowledged  her  indebtedness.  During  those
interviews,  the
investigator made her aware that her financial situation was a concern as it pertained to
her security clearance eligibility. (Item 3)
In  the  record  here,  Applicant  submitted  evidence  of  several  small  payments  on
some of her debts, including a small number of pre-SOR payments. She also submitted
evidence  that  she  entered  into  a  post-SOR  payment  plan  on  her  largest  debt  on
September 16, 2022, which would have her pay $25 per month until it is resolved. She
began  making  $30  monthly  payments  on  January  20,  2022,  to  the  medical-account
creditor.  (Items  1,  11-16)  She  set  up  a  payment  plan  in  an  amount  not  listed  on
September 30, 2022, for the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f that she initially disputed in her
SOR  Answer.  (Item  17)  She  paid  $284.95  on  September  17,  2022  to  settle  her  $569
department store collection account. (Items 18, 19) She paid $32.26 on September 17,
2022 to settle her $92 cell phone collection account. (Items 9, 19) Applicant claims her
household income has since improved, and that she believes she can resolve the debts
in the future. (Items 1, 3)
As the above summary indicates, Applicant has taken some recent limited action
on  her  debts.  First,  her  payments  have  resolved  a  small  portion  of  the  debt  alleged.
Second,  the  payments  she  has  made  were  mostly  recent  and  many  were  undertaken
after the  SOR  was issued. (Item 1) She  did not  submit  evidence  that  she  remained in
contact  with  her  creditors  during  her  periods  of  delinquency  or  that  she  received
financial counseling.
Personal Conduct
When  Applicant  completed  her  July  1,  2021  SF-86,  she  failed  to  disclose  any
delinquent debts and specifically failed to disclose any of the debts alleged in her SOR.
She  admitted  that  the  information  she  provided  was  inaccurate  adding  that  she  found
the  questions  confusing  and  that  she  “should  have  been  checking  [her]  credit  report
annually.”  She  did,  however,  freely and  candidly  discuss  all  of  her debts  and  financial
situation with the investigator during her August 25, 2021 and September 8, 2021 OPM
PSIs. The investigator noted and discussed other errors and/or incomplete or inaccurate
information that Applicant provided on her SF-86 to include her identifying information,
residence, employment, references, police record, and prior investigations. (Items 2, 3)
Character Evidence
In  her  post-FORM  response,  Applicant  submitted  a  draft  letter  of  resignation
effective  December  31,  2022,  to  her  employer.  In  her  letter,  she  stated  that  she  was
honored  and  humbled  to  have  been  able  to  contribute  to  the  service  and  family
members she served for the past 16 years. She stated that her employment experience
made her a radiation technician, and she was grateful to have had this opportunity. She
closed  stating  that  her  husband  accepted  a  job  offer  out  of  state  and  would  be
relocating. (Item 21)
She stated in a separate email that she “will miss being able to contribute and do
my  best  for  the  U.S.  Navy  and  their  constituents.”  (Item  22)  Applicant  submitted
photographs  of  two  folded  U.S.  American  flags  displayed  in  her  home  and  noted  that
several of her family members served in the U.S. Armed Forces. (Item 23-25)
