Financial Considerations
Applicant’s  SOR lists six allegations: (1) that he failed to file his Federal income
tax returns for tax years 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020; (2) that he failed to file his
state  income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2016,  2017,  2018,  2019,  and  2020;  (3)  that  he
owes the Federal Government approximately $5,821 for tax year 2016; (4) that he owes
the Federal Government approximately $9,178 for tax year 2017; (5) that he owes the
Federal Government approximately $4,252 for tax year 2018; and (6) that he owes the
Federal  Government  approximately  $4,584  for  tax  year  2019.  In  his  SOR  Answer,
Applicant denied all of these allegations. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.f (Item 1))
These allegations are established by Applicant’s  April 28, 2021 SF-86; his June
22, 2022 Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Response to Interrogatories,
including his tax history, IRS delinquency notices, IRS direct payment receipts; and his
July 16, 2021 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) interview. (Items 1, 2)
Applicant  self-reported  that  he  had  not  filed  his  2016,  2017,  2018,  and  2019
Federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  when  he  completed  his  April  28,  2021  SF-86.
During his July 16, 2021 OPM interview, he stated that he did not list his failure to file
his  2020  Federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  on  his  SF-86  because  at  the  time  he
completed his SF-86 he intended to file his 2020 returns, but when the deadline came,
he did not have the funds. (Items 1, 2)
Applicant  described  circumstances  beyond  his  control  that  led  to  his  tax
problems in his April 28, 2021 SF-86, in his June 22, 2022 DOHA interrogatories, in his
July 16, 2021 OPM interview, and in his August 13, 2022 SOR Answer. (Items 1, 2, 3)
Applicant’s  financial  difficulties  began  in  the  summer  of  2014  when  his  mother
collapsed due  to a  brain  aneurism,  which  was  then  followed by  multiple  heart  attacks.
After her last heart attack, she went into a coma. After several surgeries and continuous
treatment,  she  awoke  from  her  coma  and  appeared  to  be  recovering.  Just  when  she
she appeared to be recovering, she developed a lung infection and died in  May 2017.
From the time of her brain aneurism in 2014 until she passed away from a lung infection
in 2017, she was continuously in a hospital or care facility. (Item 1)
In  August 2018, a  few months after Applicant’s  mother passed away,  his father
was diagnosed with prostate cancer. Fifteen months later, his father died in November
2019.  Throughout  this  process  Applicant’s  mother  and  father  accrued  numerous  and
substantial medical bills and funeral expenses. Although Medicare paid their portion  of
the bills, Applicant and his siblings found themselves responsible for the balance. Since
Applicant was not married, his married siblings prevailed upon him to pay the majority of
these bills. (Item 1)
In the summer of 2019, Applicant’s girlfriend was laid off from her job and shortly
thereafter was diagnosed with breast cancer. In addition to her breast cancer diagnosis,
she  developed  a  heart  condition  that  required  medical  treatment.  Since  his  girlfriend
was no longer employed, she did not have health care insurance and Applicant paid for
her medical bills. (Item 1)
To pay for these unplanned medical and funeral expenses, Applicant drew credit
card cash advances and took out a personal bank loan to  offset his credit card  debts.
He made the decision to pay off his credit card balances and personal loan rather than
paying his taxes  because  his credit  cards had  higher  balances  when  compared  to the
taxes  he  owed.  He  has  since  paid  off  all  of  his  credit  card  debt  and  personal  loan  as
well as his automobile loan. (Item 1)
Department Counsel’s FORM noted that Applicant filed his tax returns for the tax
years  at  issue;  however,  he  emphasized  that  his  returns  were  not  timely  filed.
Department Counsel also said that Applicant did not submit any evidence that he is on a
payment  plan  with  the  IRS.  A  review  of  the  FORM  indicates  that  Applicant  e-filed  his
2016 Federal and state tax return on June 19, 2017, that he mailed his 2017 and 2018
Federal  and  state  tax  returns  on  February  1,  2022,  and  that  he  e-filed  his  2019  and
2020 Federal and state tax returns in January 2022. (Item 1)
Applicant stated in his Response to Interrogatories that he is working with an IRS
approved  collection  agency  (CA)  and  that  as  soon  as  they  received  updates  from  the
IRS regarding his 2017 and 2018 income tax returns, they would set up a payment plan
for him. Although Applicant was unable to set up a payment plan with the CA at the time
he  submitted  his  FORM  response,  he  did  provide  evidence  that  he  made  direct
payments to the IRS as follows: (1) a $2,000 payment to the IRS on December 3, 2021
for tax year 2016; (2)  a $2,000 payment to the IRS on June 6, 2022 for tax year 2016;
and (3) a $2,000 payment to the IRS on June 6, 2022 for tax year 2019. (Item 3)
To   accelerate   that   repayment   process,   Applicant   has   taken   on   a   part-time   job
working   45   to   70   hours  per  pay  period   in   addition   to   his  full-time   job   to   earn   extra
income. (Items  1, 4)  In  his FORM  response, Applicant submitted  evidence  of his direct
payments to  the  IRS  as follows: (1) a  $2,000  payment to  the  IRS  on  June  6, 2022  for
tax year 2016; (2)  a  $1,000  payment to  the  IRS on  August  12, 2022  for  tax  year 2016;
(3)  a   $2,000   payment   to   the   IRS  on   August   12,  2022   for  tax  year   2017;  (4)  a   $3,000
payment to  the  IRS  on  October 13, 2022  for tax year 2017; (5) a  $1,000  payment to  the
IRS  on  August 15, 2022  for tax  year 2018;  (6) a  $2,000  payment  to  the  IRS  on  June  6,
2022   for  tax  year  2019;  (7)  a   $1,000   payment  to   the   IRS   on   August  15,  2022   for  tax
year 2019; and  (8) a  final payment of $2,634.81  to  the  IRS  on  September 26, 2022  for
tax  year  2019.   Applicant  has  paid   all   taxes   owed   for  tax  year  2019   and   his  account
reflects  a   zero  balance.  (Items   5   to   14)  Since   November  2022,  he   set  up   a   payment
plan  with  the  CA and  is making  payments of  $1,000  a  month  to  the  CA by direct debit.
He provided  a schedule of past and future payments  with the CA. (Item  12)
Character Evidence
letters
three  reference
Applicant  submitted
from  his  coworkers:  (1)  an
engineer/scientist;  (2)  an  operations  and  maintenance  manager;  and  (3)  a  lead
engineer.  All  three  references  described  the  invaluable  support  Applicant  provides  in
support  of  the  national  security  in  a  remote  location  as  a  member  of  their  electronics
team.  In  Applicant’s  recent  evaluation,  he  was  rated  as  “Far  Exceeded”  in  his  overall
rating, which is their company’s highest rating. The references lauded his integrity and
job performance. The lead engineer concluded, “Without [Applicant], we wouldn’t have
the  institutional  knowledge  to  keep  the  [remote  location]  operational  as  well  as  it  can
be.” (Item 1)
