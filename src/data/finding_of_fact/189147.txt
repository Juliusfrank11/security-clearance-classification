Applicant is 34 years old and married. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2011 and
a master’s degree in 2018. Applicant has worked for a DoD contractor as an analyst since
January 2013 and was granted national security eligibility at that time. He seeks to retain
his  eligibility  and  security  clearance  in  connection  with  his  employment.  (Item  4  at
Sections 2, 12, 13A, 17, 18, 25.)
Guideline E, Personal Conduct
The  SOR sets forth four  allegations under the  Personal Conduct  guideline.  The
Government alleges that Applicant has engaged in questionable conduct starting in 2008,
and  most  recently  in  2021,  that  involved  an  unwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and
regulations  raising  concerns  about  his  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and  ability  to  protect
classified or sensitive information. The four allegations and supporting record  evidence
are summarized below:
1.a.   February  2008  Arrest.  Applicant  was  arrested  in  2008  and  charged  with
Driving Under the Influence (DUI) as a Minor. (Item 3 at 37.)
1.b. July 2013 Arrest. Applicant was arrested again in 2013 and charged with DUI
with a Blood Alcohol Content of 0.15% or more. This arrest occurred within six months of
Applicant starting his job with a DOD contractor and being granted a security clearance.
In July 2014 he plead guilty to the charge and was sentenced to 120 days in jail, which
was suspended. He was also placed on probation for 18 months and fined, and he was
ordered to complete 40 hours of community service, 12 hours of a DUI education course,
and  a  meeting  of  a  local  Victim  Impact  Panel.  He  was  further  ordered  to  abstain  from
drinking alcohol during the term of his probation, to submit to random testing for alcohol,
and to have an ignition-interlock device installed on his vehicle. (Item 4 at 1-5.)
The  terms  of  Applicant’s  sentence  and  probation  were  subsequently  amended
three  times.  On  November  20,  2014,  Applicant  was  ordered  to  complete  Supportive
Outpatient  Substance  Abuse  treatment  and  all  recommended  aftercare.  He  had
previously  tested  positive  for  alcohol.  This  condition  was  added  by  the  court  on  the
recommendation of the probation office supervising Applicant’s probation. On January 8,
2016,  Applicant’s  period  of  probation  was  extended  six  months  to  July  10,  2016,  to
provide  Applicant  with  additional  time  to  complete  the  terms  and  conditions  of  his
probation.  On  April  15,  2016,  Applicant  probation  terms  were  amended  to  add  a
requirement that he complete “a cognitive program” within 90 days. (Item 4 at 6-8.)
1.c.   July  2016  Arrest  Warrant.  Applicant  failed  to  abide  by  the  terms  of  his
probation  and  the  state  moved  the  court  to  revoke  his  probation  and  impose  the
suspended  sentence  of  120  days.  The  prosecutor’s  motion  recites  that  Applicant  only
performed half of his 40 hours of community service, failed to participate in an outpatient
substance  abuse  treatment  program,  and  tested  positive  for  alcohol  on  at  least  two
occasions, once in 2014 and again in 2015. The court  issued  a  warrant for Applicant’s
arrest. (Item 5 at 1-2; Item 7 at 2.)
1.d. January 2021 Revocation of Probation. In July 2020 Applicant learned about
the  arrest  warrant.  He  turned  himself  into  the  county  sheriff  and  was  arrested.  He
appeared  in  court  on  October  2,  2020,  and  he  was  released  on  a  $1,000  bond.  His
probation  was  continued.  He  was  given  a  new  court date  of  January  21,  2021.  At  the
January  hearing,  the  court  revoked  Applicant’s  original  probationary  sentence  and
imposed  a  sentence  of  confinement  for  11  days  in  the  county  jail,  commencing  on
February 4, 2021, and a fine. (Item 6; Item 7 at 2.)
Applicant failed to timely report his 2013 DUI arrest to  the security officer at his
employer. He also failed to report his arrest in July 2020 for violating his probation and
his  October  2020  court  appearance.  He  ultimately  reported  his  criminal  history  to  his
employer on November 16, 2020. He updated his history in a second report in February
2021. (Item 7 at 1-2.)
Applicant noted in his Answer that he has learned from his past mistakes. He wrote
that he had married, and the couple had purchased their first home as evidence of his
maturity.  He  also  commented  that  he  loves  his  work  and  highly  respects  the  service
members he supports at his employment. (Item 2 at 1.)
