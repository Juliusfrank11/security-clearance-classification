Applicant is 39 years old.  He is married and has a four year old son.  He has a
tenth grade high school education.  However, he has attended trade school from 2007
to 2010, and again in 2014, where he has earned several trade certificates.  He holds
the  position  of  Tool  Maker  Machinist  for  a  defense  contractor.  He  seeks  to  obtain  a
security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense industry.
The  SOR  alleges  that Applicant has six  delinquent  debts  totaling  approximately
$52,907, all of which are consumer accounts.  In his Answer, Applicant admits each of
the  allegations  and  provides  explanations.  Credit  reports  of  the  Applicant  dated
February 4, 2022; and December 15, 2022, reflect that each of these debts were at one
point owing.  (Government Exhibits 3 and 4.)
Prior  to  2019,  Applicant  had  a  good  credit  score  and  payment  history.  In  late
2019, he decided to start his own manufacturing and machinist shop.  He used money
from his 401(k) and his credit cards to finance this business venture.  The business did
very  well  the  first  year  earning  about  $161,000.  The  money  he  earned,  he  invested
back  into  the  business  anticipating  even  more  success.  The  following  year,  however,
due to COVID and its quarantine requirements, there was a drastic decline in business
and Applicant could not keep up  with financial responsibilities.  In 2021, Applicant was
forced to close the business.  He then started looking for a job.  At this point, however,
he  had  spent  most  of  his  savings  simply  trying  to  survive.  He  was  forced  to  neglect
some bills and pay others in order to keep his family afloat.  His mortgage and his car
payment  were  his  top  priorities  to  ensure  his  family  would  have  a  place  to  live  and
transportation.  Other bills became delinquent.  Applicant began working for his current
employer in October 2021.  Since then, he has been slowly recovering, trying to pay off
his delinquent debts.  He stated that he started by paying his smaller debts first, which
included  debts  he  owed  to  Lowes,  Best  Buy,  and  Home  Depot.  Applicant’s  wife  is
unemployed.
