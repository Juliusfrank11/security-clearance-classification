Applicant admitted the eight SOR allegations contained in SOR Paragraph 1, with
explanations. (Item 2) His admissions are incorporated into these findings of fact.
Applicant  is  41  years  old.  He  is  married  and  has  three  children.  He  earned  a
master’s degree in 2009. He has worked for federal contractors since approximately 2010
and obtained a security clearance in 2010. He started a position with his current employer,
a federal contractor, in January 2022. (Item 3)
Applicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-
QIP) on January 19, 2022. In response to questions in Section 26 (Financial Records),
Applicant disclosed delinquent credit cards and a personal loan that became delinquent
in  2019.  He  explained  that  he  used  the  credit  cards  and  personal  loan  to  finance  a
business venture that later failed. (Item 3.)
On March 8, 2022, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator for the Office of
Personnel  Management  (OPM).  During  the  interview,  he  discussed  nine  delinquent
accounts. He explained that in 2017 he started a cryptocurrency (digital money) business.
As he did not have enough money to fund the start-up business, he used credit cards and
a personal loan to finance it. Initially, his business was successful; however, about a year
later, in 2018, his cryptocurrency lost most of its value and his business became insolvent.
He was then in debt about $45,000. (Item 7)
