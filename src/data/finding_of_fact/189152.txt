Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations. His admissions are adopted as findings
of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I
make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 36 years old. He has worked for a defense contractor since May 2018.
He has taken some college courses. He is married and has two children, ages five and
one. He has held a security clearance since 2019. (Tr. 5-6, 21, 26; GE1)
Under Guideline H, the SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana from October 2010
to June 2021 (SOR ¶ 1.a); that he used and purchased marijuana from about March 2019
to  about  2021,  while  having  access  to  classified  information  (SOR  ¶  1.b);  and  that  he
purchased marijuana from January 2011 to December 2020 (SOR ¶ 1.c).
Under  Guideline  E,  the  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  deliberately  gave  false
information  on  his  June  2018  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  when  he  failed  to
disclose his illegal drug use and purchases as stated in SOR ¶¶1.a-1.c above. (SOR ¶
2.a)
Applicant  admitted  all  of  his  illegal  drug  use  and  purchases,  and  his  deliberate
false  answer  given  on  his  2018  SCA.  He  began  using  marijuana  in  2010  and  starting
purchasing it in 2011. He used marijuana on a daily basis from 2011 through June 2021.
He purchased marijuana from 2011 through December 2020. He claimed that his use and
purchase of marijuana was because he suffered from anxiety and using marijuana helped
him with it. He admitted that he was never diagnosed by a medical professional before
March 2021 with anxiety. At that time, his primary care doctor prescribed him the drug
Escitalopram,  which  is  an  anxiety  medication,  but  he  did  not  know  if  he  was  formally
diagnosed with anxiety. He originally took the medication once a day, but now takes it on
an as-needed basis. He has never seen a psychologist or a psychiatrist about a possible
anxiety disorder. He claims he has not used marijuana since June 2021. (Tr. 20, 22-23,
27, 29-31; GE 3; AE D; SOR answer)
Applicant filled out an SCA in June 2018. In Section 23 of the SCA, he was asked
if, within the last seven years, he had used any illegal drugs or controlled substances. He
answered “no.” That answer was false because Applicant was using marijuana on a daily
basis before he completed the SCA and at the time he filled out the SCA. He admitted his
answer  was  false.  He  answered  falsely  to  conceal  his  past  use  of  marijuana.  He  was
aware his employer had a drug-free work policy, and he signed an agreement to adhere
to that policy. He was also aware that using marijuana violated federal and state law. He
also understood that he was granted a security clearance in 2019 based upon his false
answer to Section 23 of his 2018 SCA. He continued to use marijuana after being granted
a security clearance in 2019 through June 2021. (Tr. 20, 22-27; GE 2)
Applicant admitted that from May 2021 through June 2021, when he claims to have
stopped using marijuana, he had access to classified information. He claimed he did not
purchase  marijuana  during  this  same  time  frame.  As  of  the  date  of  his  background
interview in July 2021, he had not disclosed his marijuana use to his employer. (Tr. 32-
33; GE 3, p.6)
Applicant  completed  and  submitted  a  second  SCA  in  June  2021.  He  admitted
using marijuana in this SCA beginning in 2010, with his most recent use in June 2021.
He  also  admitted  using  marijuana  while  possessing  a  security  clearance.  He  admitted
purchasing marijuana about once a week from 2011 to December 2020. He also stated
that  he  was  now  taking  medication  to  prevent  further  use  of  marijuana.  During  his
testimony,  he  explained  that  the  reason  he  decided  to  fully  disclose  his  previous
marijuana use and purchases at that time was because he just had his second child, he
now had prescription medication to aid his anxiety, and he felt it was the right thing to do
now that he actually had access to classified information. (Tr. 33-34; GE 1)
Applicant  completed  a  30-day  inpatient  drug  treatment  program  beginning  in
February 2023 and ending in March 2023. He followed that with a “stepped down” 30-day
program from which he was discharged on March 31, 2023. All this treatment post-dated
his hearing in January 2023. The letter from the treatment program does not provide a
diagnosis,  prognosis,  or  a  treatment  plan  for  Applicant.  He  participated  in  family
counseling  where  apparently  his  drug  use  was  discussed.  No  further  information  was
provided and that counseling ceased in May 2021. His wife does not use marijuana, nor
do family members or friends with whom he associates. (Tr. 34-36; AE E)
Applicant  provided  letters  of  support  from  two  work  supervisors  and  a  personal
friend.  Both  of  his  work  supervisors  expressed  the  opinion  that  he  was  a  respected
member of the team and presented no security issues. One of the supervisors stated that
“to my knowledge, he doesn’t abuse alcohol or drugs.” Applicant admitted that he did not
tell either supervisor about his past drug use for fear that knowing that information might
impact their professional opinion of him. His personal friend wrote that he was aware of
Applicant’s prior drug use, but nonetheless believes that he does not pose a security risk.
(Tr. 39; AE A-C)
