Applicant  is  a  37-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor  for  whom  he  has
worked  since  October  2018.  He  earned  a  high  school  diploma  in  2004.  He  has  been
married since 2016 and has two children, ages five and three. He has served in the Air
Force Reserve since December 2010. (Items 4, 6, 7)
In  the  SOR,  the  Government  alleged  Applicant’s  five  delinquent  debts  totaling
approximately $32,000 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.e). These delinquencies consist of credit
cards (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, and 1.d), a vehicle loan (SOR ¶ 1.b), and a medical bill (SOR ¶
1.e).  He  admitted  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.c  with  additional  comment.
His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. He denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.d
and  1.e  with  additional  comment.  Despite  his  denials,  those  SOR  allegations  are
established through the Government’s credit reports. (SOR; Items 3-10)
The  delinquent  credit  cards  in  the  amounts  of  $12,505  and  $8,216,  alleged  in
SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.c, respectively, have not been resolved. Applicant opened the credit
card  in  SOR  ¶  1.a  in  2004  and  last  made  a  payment  on  it  in  November  2017.  He
opened  the  credit  card  in  SOR  ¶  1.c  in  April  2015  and  last  made  a  payment  on  it  in
November 2019. (Items 3-10)
The delinquent vehicle loan in the amount of $10,545 alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b has
not  been  resolved.  Applicant  opened  this  account  in  April  2014  when  he  financed  the
purchase of a vehicle. The last payment he made on this account was in January 2019.
(Items 3-10)
Applicant  disputed  owing   the   credit   card   in the   amount   of   $879   listed   in  SOR  ¶
1.d.   He  agreed   that  he   opened   the   credit   card  but  denied   making   charges   on   it.  He
claimed   the   credit  card   should  not  have   a   balance   and   believes  that   someone   made
charges  to   this  credit  card  without  his  authorization.   He   disputed   the   balance   with   the
credit reporting  agencies, but he acknowledged  that the  dispute  has not been  resolved.
The  Government’s  2021, 2022,  and  2023  credit reports reflect  that  he has disputed  this
account,  but  all  three  credit reports list it  as an  account in collection.  Applicant provided
no   documentation   to   substantiate   the   basis  of  his   dispute,   nor  has   he   provided
documentation to show any resolution of his  dispute. (Items  3-10)
Applicant denied owing the medical debt for $170 listed in  SOR ¶ 1.e. because
he  claimed  that  he  does  not  recognize  it  and  therefore  does  not  know  if  he  is
responsible for it. The debt was established in January 2022. He provided no evidence
of any attempted resolution of this debt. He provided no documentation to substantiate
the basis of any dispute. The debt appears on the Government’s 2022 credit report but
not on the Government’s 2023 credit report. (Items 3, 9)
Applicant has two additional delinquent debts that are not listed on the SOR. One
debt is a rental delinquency for $2,026 that is in collection. Another is a credit card that
is 150 days late that has a past due balance of $674 with a total balance of $3,693. Any
the  SOR,  such  as  Applicant’s  additional
adverse
information  not  alleged
in
delinquencies,  will  not be  considered for disqualification purposes; however,  it may be
considered in assessing an applicant’s credibility; in evaluating an applicant’s evidence
of  extenuation,  mitigation,  or  changed  circumstances;  in  considering  whether  the
applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; and in applying the whole-person
concept. (ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017)). (Item 10)
Applicant  claimed  that  the  reason  he  became  delinquent  on  the  debts  listed  in
SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.c  is  because  his  wife  had  a  difficult  pregnancy  and  health
problems that kept her from working. Her inability to work resulted in decreased income
that did not allow them to cover their expenses. In June 2022, he claimed that he would
arrange to pay these SOR debts in the future when his wife’s health problems subside,
and she is able to earn money again. He did not provide a timeline for when he thought
he might start paying these debts. He provided no evidence how he plans to resolve the
debts  listed  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.d  and  1.e.  In  June  2022,  he  provided  a  personal  financial
statement showing that he has about a $500 monthly surplus. Therefore, he had at least
some available finances to address his SOR debts if he chose to do so. He provided a
paystub  from  his  employer  for  the  May  14,  2022  through  May  27,  2022  pay  period
showing that he earned a net income of about $2,312. (Items 3-7)
