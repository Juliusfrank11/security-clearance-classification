In  his  Answer,  Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.b-1.f  and  denied  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and
1.g-1.j with explanations. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After
a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  evidence  submitted,  I  make  the
following additional findings of fact:
Applicant  is  63  years  old.  He  is  married  and  has  three  adult  children.  He
graduated high school in 1978 and took some college courses through 1982 but did not
receive  a  degree.  He  obtained  his  first  security  clearance  in  1987  and  has  held  a
security  clearance for most of his career. He has been  with his current  employer  as a
network engineer since 2018. (GX 2, 3)
The  SOR  allegations  concern  a  charged-off  home  equity  loan  of  $89,482;  five
delinquent  student  loans  totaling  about  $77,000;  several  years  of  unfiled  federal  and
state income tax returns; about $25,000 in delinquent federal income taxes; and about
$4,000 in delinquent  state income taxes.  The  home equity  and student loan  debts are
established  by  Applicant’s  credit  reports  from  December  2019,  April  2020,  and  May
2022,  as  well  as  his  admissions.  The  tax  allegations  are  established  by  Applicant’s
January 2020 SCA, April 2020 background interview summary, and his November 2022
Interrogatory Response. (GX 1-7)
Applicant’s  financial  issues  began  in  2016  when  he  started  a  new  job.  Within  a
few  months,  his  company  changed  the  status  of  his  position  from  W-2  employee  to
1099 contractor. As a result, the company stopped taking income tax deductions out of
his paycheck, but he did not timely pay the taxes when due.  Soon afterwards, his pay
from the company became erratic. The company also failed to submit required tax forms
for 2016 and 2017. In early 2018, the company abruptly stopped issuing any paychecks.
Applicant  resigned  in  April  2018.  In  2019,  he  sued  the  company  for  lost  wages  and
received a settlement of $45,000, minus attorney fees. (GX 3; AX 3-4)
Also  in  2016,  Applicant’s  parents  became  ill  and  moved  in  with  him.  He  began
managing  their  finances  and  medical  appointments.  Later  that  year,  his  father  passed
away,  and  his  mother  passed  away  in  2017.  Applicant  stated  that  the  inconsistent
income and time spent caring for his parents led to financial strain. (GX 1-3)
SOR ¶ 1.a ($89,482) is a charged-off home equity loan that became delinquent
in 2018. Applicant claimed he made multiple attempts to contact the creditor and set up
a payment plan. Eventually, he was informed the debt had been sold. He did not specify
when this occurred. However, in about October 2021, a collection agency sued him for
the  debt.  Later  that  month,  he  settled  with  the  agency  and  agreed  to  make  $800
monthly  payments  toward  the  balance  of  $94,282.  Records  show  that  he  made  timely
payments  from  November  2021  through  October  2022,  and  he  intends  to  continue  to
make payments. (GX 1-3, 5-7; AX 1-2)
SOR  ¶¶  1.b  ($21,128),  1.c  ($19,637),  1.d  ($17,399),  1.e  ($15,907)  and  1.f
($2,884)  are  delinquent  federal  student  loans  in  collection.  From  about  2010  through
2015, Applicant cosigned on student loans for both of his daughters. His first daughter
made  payments  on  her  loans.  His  second  daughter  did  not.  Applicant  knew  that  his
second  daughter’s  student  loans  were  in  collection.  However,  he  claimed  he  was  not
responsible for the loans because his second daughter had agreed to pay them. (GX 3,
5-7)
In his Answer, Applicant claimed his second daughter was working on a payment
plan  under  which  he  would  be  removed  from  the  loans  after  one  year  of  timely
payments. He was not aware of the status of his  second daughter’s payment  plan but
claimed the loans had been removed from his credit report. The student loans still show
as collection accounts attributable to Applicant in all the credit reports in the record. (GX
1, 5-7)
Sua sponte I take administrative notice that, as of this writing, the repayment of
several  federal  student  loans  has  been  in  forbearance  status  due  to  the  COVID-19
pandemic  under  multiple  Presidential  Executive  Orders  since  March  2020.  Federal

SOR  ¶  1.g  alleges  that  Applicant  failed  to  timely  file  his  federal  income  tax
returns for tax years 2016, 2017 and  2018. He denied  the allegation but admitted that
he did not timely file his tax returns for those years, as alleged. Applicant attributed the
filing  delay  to  his  company’s  failure  to  issue  tax  forms  in  2016  and  2017  and  his  own
lack of funds to deal with the unexpected tax liability. (GX 1)
During his April 2020 background interview, Applicant also attributed the delayed
filings to  his own “procrastination.” He  stated his first daughter was an accountant and
had assisted  him  with his taxes.  He claimed he had  filed his 2018 tax  return  in  spring
2020, but did not provide any evidence of the filing. He intended on filing his 2016 and
2017 tax returns by May 2020. (GX 3)
In  his  November  2022  Interrogatory  Response,  Applicant  asserted  that  he  filed
his  2016,  2017,  and  2018  income  tax  returns  in  January  and  February  2022  and
included an  unsigned copy of  his 2017 tax  return. He also  disclosed  that his 2015  tax
return was filed in July 2018 and his 2019, 2020, and 2021 income tax returns were filed
in November 2022. These additional years of late tax filings are not alleged in the SOR.
(GX 3)
In a November 2022 letter, Applicant’s first daughter, the accountant, stated she
had  been  assisting  him  with  his  taxes  since  2014.  She  first  worked  with  a  large
accounting firm and opened her own firm in 2021. She detailed that  Applicant brought
his 2016, 2017, and 2018 tax documents to her in May 2020. She claimed that the tax
returns  for those three years  were  submitted  to the IRS  in  January 2022. She  blamed
difficulties within her own office for the additional filing delays. (GX 3)
Applicant’s  daughter  also  stated  that  she  helped  him  file  his  2019,  2020  and
2021  federal  income  tax  returns  in  September  2022.  She  provided  a  summary  of  the
filings on her company’s letterhead but did not include any documentation from the IRS
confirming these later filings. (GX 3)
IRS  account  transcripts  confirm  that  Applicant’s  2016  tax  return  was  filed  in
January 2022. As of February 2022, account transcripts reflect that his 2017 and 2018
tax returns had not been filed. However, in a November 2022 correspondence, the IRS
notified  Applicant  that  his  2017  tax  return  had  been  received,  but  could  not  be
processed without the submission of additional information. The record does not contain
confirmation from the IRS that his 2017 and 2018 tax returns were filed.
SOR  ¶  1.i  ($25,534)  alleges  Applicant  owes  delinquent  federal  taxes  for  2017,
2019, and 2020. He denied the allegation but admitted that he initially had a balance of
about  $28,500  in  delinquent  taxes,  of  which  he  had  paid  $3,500.  He  asserted  that  he
had  filed  an  Installment  Agreement  with  his 2021  tax  return  and  was  paying  $500  per
month toward his delinquent taxes.
An  undated  and  unsigned  Federal  Installment  Agreement  Request  shows  that
Applicant proposed a payment plan of $395 per month.  IRS account transcripts and a
payment activity summary show that, in November and December 2022, Applicant paid
about  $20,000  toward  his  delinquent  taxes.  Most  of  these  payments  were  directed
toward his 2016 tax debt that now shows as paid. (GX 3-4; AX 6-7)
In  the  FORM  Response,  Applicant’s  daughter  the  accountant  stated  that
Applicant  had  submitted  his  2021  tax  return  and  that  he  was  current  with  his  tax
obligations.  She  estimated  Applicant  had  paid  about  $22,500  toward  his  delinquent
taxes and intended on maintaining his monthly payments. No additional IRS documents
were included in the Response. (FORM Response)
SOR ¶ 1.h alleges that Applicant failed to timely file his state income tax returns
for 2016, 2017 and  2018.  He  denied  the  allegation  but admitted  that  he did  not timely
file his tax returns for those years, as alleged. Applicant asserted that his state income
tax  returns  had  been  filed  and  the  timing  of  those  filings  mirrored  his  federal  filings.
State tax documents from August through November 2022 support Applicant’s assertion
that the state tax returns were received and processed. These include a Notice of State
Tax Computation, Notices of Intercepted Refunds, and the issuance of a refund. (GX 1,
3; AX 5, 8-9)
SOR  ¶  1.j  ($3,797)  alleges  Applicant  owes  delinquent  state  taxes  for  2016  and
2017. He admitted that he previously owed the state delinquent taxes, but claims he has
since paid the taxes in full. Applicant claimed that refunds for tax years 2019, 2020 and
2021 were partially intercepted to satisfy his state tax debt. State tax documents confirm
that  the  tax  debt  for  2016  and  2017  was  paid  through  intercepted  refunds.  The
remaining funds were released to him. (GX 1, 3; AX 5, 8-9)
Applicant  asserted  that  he  was  “asset  heavy”  with  about  $5,000,000  in  assets.
His  daughter  the  accountant  stated  that  he  continues  to  pay  over  the  agreed  monthly
installment  toward  his  tax  debt  and  he  will  continue  to  be  current  on  his  future  tax
liabilities. She also provided character evidence in which she described  him as having
great  judgment  and  self-discipline  and  was  of  high  character,  integrity  and  credibility.
