In  her  Answer,  Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.z  with  explanations.  Her
admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant  is  36  years  old.  She  served  on  active  duty  in  the  Army  from  2005
through 2008 and received an honorable discharge. During her time in service, she held
a security clearance and deployed overseas at least once. She married a fellow soldier
just  prior  to  her  discharge.  They  have  two  teenage  children  and  she  has  one  adult
stepson.  She  attended  college  from  2009  through  2011  and  obtained  an  associate
degree.  She  also  took  classes  toward  a  bachelor’s  degree.  She  has  been  with  her
current employer as a materials handler since April 2021. (GX 2, 3)
The  SOR  allegations  concern  the  balances  on  two  vehicle  loans  totaling  about
$35,000  following  repossessions;  fourteen  delinquent  federal  student  loans  totaling
about  $78,000;  four  delinquent  credit  card  accounts  totaling  about  $3,800;  three
delinquent  utility  and  cable  bills  totaling  about  $3,800;  and  three  delinquent  payday
loans  totaling  about  $1,800.  In  addition  to  Applicant’s  admissions,  the  debts  are
established by Applicant’s May 2022 credit report. (GX 2, 4)
Applicant stated that her financial issues began in 2008 after she returned from a
deployment  and  made  a  “bad  decision”  by  purchasing  a  new  vehicle.  Within  the  year,
she was discharged from the Army, married and had a child. Her focus shifted to being
a mother and starting her college coursework. She realized that she could not afford the
vehicle  and  struggled  to  make  payments.  The  vehicle  was  later  repossessed  (¶  1.z).
(GX 2-4)
In 2011, Applicant began working full time as a supply technician and earned an
annual  salary  of  about  $38,000.  Applicant  claimed  that,  during  this  time,  her  financial
situation improved. However, in 2013, Applicant resigned from this position because of
what she described as an “unprofessional relationship” with a coworker. After about six
months, Applicant was able to  secure new employment, but  with a significant pay cut,
earning  about  $24,000  annually.  From  2013  through  2020,  she  maintained  full-time
employment, but at continually low salaries. (GX 2-3; FORM Response)
In 2016, Applicant’s husband, who remained in the military at the time, deployed
for  a  year.  Applicant  described  experiencing  marital  difficulties  during  this  period  and
facing  a  “huge  financial  burden.”  Paying  her  expenses  was  not  a  priority  and  she
allowed another vehicle to be repossessed (¶ 1.a) because she was not using it at the
time. (GX 2-4)
Applicant’s  husband  began  experiencing  health  issues  a  few  months  after  his
return  from  the  deployment.  In  2019,  he  underwent  heart  surgery  and  received  a
medical  discharge  from  the  military.  In  May  2020,  Applicant  and  her  husband  moved
from State A to State B to be close to his son (her stepson). At the time of their move,
Applicant  secured  a  new offer of employment.  However,  the  offer was  later withdrawn
because  of  work  shutdowns  related  to  COVID-19.  Applicant  was  able  to  secure  new
employment, beginning in June 2020. Still, she described experiencing further financial
strain during this period following the move. (GX 2-3; AX B; FORM Response)
Since starting with her current employer in April 2021, Applicant has received two
significant pay raises. She now earns an annual salary of approximately $80,500. She
and  her  husband  also  receive  military  disability  payments.  Applicant  stated  that  their
combined earnings are just under $200,000 per year. (GX 2-3; AX D; FORM Response)
In December 2022, following her receipt of the SOR, Applicant contracted with a
debt resolution company  to settle her debts. She submitted a total debt of $41,640 for
inclusion in the company’s program. This included the accounts referenced in  SOR ¶¶
1.a, 1.m, 1.r, 1.t – 1.v, and 1.x – 1.z. She also included one $666 debt not alleged in the
SOR. She was to make  biweekly payments of $318 into the program  over 48 months.
The  company  would  then  use  those  funds  to  negotiate  the  settlement  of  Applicant’s
debts. The record is absent any evidence of payments in accordance with this program.
(GX 2; AX A)
As part of the agreement with the debt resolution company, Applicant submitted
a  form  titled  “Personal  Cash  Flow  Assessment,”  reflecting  that  she  had  an  available
monthly  household  income  of  $8,000.  After  the  issuance  of  her  biweekly  payments  to
the  debt  resolution  company  and  other  expenditures,  she  estimated  a  monthly
remainder  of  $3,790.  This  did  not  include  any  payments  towards  her  student  loans  or
any delinquent debts outside of the debt resolution agreement. (AX A)
SOR ¶¶ 1.a ($28,770) and 1.z ($6,373) are the balances on the two charged-off
vehicle  loans  that  remained  following  the  vehicle  repossessions  referenced  above.
Applicant disclosed both accounts in her SCA but did not detail any actions she took to
resolve  the  accounts  prior  to  the  SOR.  Subsequent  to  the  SOR,  she  included  both
accounts in her debt resolution agreement. (GX 2-4; AX A)
SOR  ¶¶  1.b  ($11,426),  1.c  ($10,078),  1.d  ($8,724),  1.e  ($8,641),  1.f  ($6,643),  1.g
($5,851), 1.h ($5,363), 1.i ($5,343), 1.j ($4,616), 1.k ($4,311), 1.l ($3,250), 1.o ($1,399),
1.p  ($1,368)  and  1.s  ($980)  are  delinquent  federal  student  loans  in  collection.  These
loans  relate  to  Applicant’s  associate  degree  and  her  studies  toward  a  bachelor’s
degree. In her Answer and FORM Response, Applicant claimed that, at an unspecified
time,  she  started  an  application  for  an  income-driven  payment  plan  through  the
Department of Education (DOE) but did not complete the application. She also asserted
that  she  recently  attempted  to  contact  DOE  in  order  to  start  a  payment  plan  but  was
unable  to  get  a  “straightforward”  answer  because  of  the  COVID-19  impact  on  student
loan  payments.  Applicant’s  delinquent  student  loans  are  not  included  in  her  debt
resolution agreement. (GX 2-4; AX A)
Sua sponte I take administrative notice that, as of this writing, the repayment of
several  federal  student  loans  has  been  in  forbearance  status  due  to  the  COVID-19
pandemic  under  multiple  Presidential  Executive  Orders  since  March  2020.  Federal
least  June  30,  2023.  See

loan  payments
SOR  ¶¶  1.m  ($2,315),  1.u  ($517),  1.v.  ($488)  and  1.x  ($423)  are  delinquent
credit-card  accounts  that  have  been  charged  off  or  placed  in  collection.  Applicant
explained that she used accounts ¶¶ 1.m and 1.u to purchase furniture and Christmas
gifts  one  year.  Applicant  opened  accounts  ¶¶  1.v  and  1.x  in  2020  to  cover  expenses
related  to  her  move  to  State  B.  She  included  all  four  accounts  in  her  debt  resolution
agreement. (GX 2, 4; AX A)
SOR ¶¶ 1.n ($2,054) and 1.q ($1,029) are internet and phone accounts that are
in collection. Applicant explained that in both instances, when the services became too
expensive,  she  switched  carriers  and  considered  the  accounts  as  a  loss.  Neither
account is included in Applicant’s debt resolution agreement and there is no evidence in
the record of payments. (GX 2, 4)
SOR  ¶¶  1.r ($1,024), 1.w  ($454) and  1.y  ($300)  are  payday  loans in  collection.
Applicant  described  taking  these  loans  in  2019  and  2020  in  order  to  cover  expenses
following  her husband’s  medical  issues  and separation  from the military.  She  included
accounts ¶¶ 1.r and 1.y in her debt resolution agreement. In about February 2023, she
entered into a payment agreement with the creditor for ¶ 1.w. Applicant did not provide
evidence that she issued any payments under the agreement. (GX 2, 4; AX C)
SOR ¶ 1.t ($764) is a collection account for an unpaid utility bill. During her time
in  State  A,  Applicant  noticed  that  her  water  bill  had  become  “outrageous.”  The  water
company determined that there was a leak outside of Applicant’s property and the repair
would  be  her  responsibility.  Applicant  did  not  believe  she  should  have  to  pay  for  the
repair, so she did not notify the utility company when she moved to State B. Applicant
included this account in her debt resolution agreement. (GX 2, 4; AX A)
Applicant acknowledged  that  she  made  some  “mistakes” with  her finances. She
also  admitted  that  she  should  not  have  waited  until  she  was  in  the  “spotlight”  of  an
investigation  to  take  action  to  address  her  delinquent  debts.  However,  she  asserted
that, with her current work and the disability payments, she is now able to maintain her
finances.  Applicant  detailed  that  she  previously  held  a  security  clearance  and  never
experienced a security incident. She stated she takes her career very seriously and has
pride in her work. (GX 2; FORM Response)
