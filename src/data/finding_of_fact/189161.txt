In  Applicant’s Answer, he admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.d. His admissions are
incorporated into my findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings
and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 31 years old. He married in February 2013 and divorced in July 2014.
(Item 3 at 7 and 22.) He pays monthly child support for a child from a previous relationship.
(Item 4 at 3.)
Applicant served honorably in the U.S. Navy from 2011 to 2015.  He attended a
state university from August 2014 to May 2016 and earned an associate degree. From
June 2017 to present, he has been a full-time student. While in school, he worked part
time jobs. In his November 2021 security clearance interview he cited his child support
obligation; a one-year period that he did not work while a student; and working low paying
jobs after leaving the military for his financial difficulties. (Item 4.) He has been employed
full  time  since  October  2022  by  a  non-government  employer.  He  received  an  interim
clearance in November 2021.
Applicant’s four delinquent debts total over $56,165. The debts are established by
two credit reports, and November 2021 security clearance interview. (Items 3-6.) He did
not disclose any of his debts on his SCA. (Item 3.) The specific debts in the SOR are as
follows:
SOR ¶  1.a: past-due auto loan  placed for collection in the  amount  of  $47,650.
This debt was charged off in 2016. (Item 5 at 2 and Item 6 at 2.)  Applicant notes in his
Answer  that  he  is  in  the  progress  of  resolving  this debt.  The  most  recent  credit  report
dated July 15, 2022, shows the loan amount as $65,969, with a balance of $47,650. (Item
5 at 2.) The November 18, 2021 credit report shows a balance of $43,788. (Item 6 at 2.)
In his Answer, Applicant states he was not able to continue to pay the loan because of
his responsibilities at the time to his schoolwork, and that he did not have the financial
resources to support himself and pay the loan. He declares, without corroboration, that
he is currently working with the creditor to settle the debt and that it will be paid off in a
timely manner (Answer at 1.)  In his November 2021 security clearance interview, he told
the investigator he did not have any knowledge of the debt and would have to investigate
to see if he was responsible for the debt. (Item 4 at 7.)
SOR  ¶   1.b:  past-due  credit  card  account   charged  off  in  the   approximate
amount   of   $7,700.   This  debt  was  charged  off  in  2016.  (Item  5  at  2  and  Item  6  at  3.)
Applicant in his Answer states he has been making payments on the account for the past
year. In his Response, he included AE-B and AE-C, both dated January 20, 2023, which
show he is following a payment arrangement for the debt. The payment arrangement was
established in April 2022 and requires him to make monthly payments of $150. He has
paid  $1,500  towards  the  debt  and  has  a  remaining  balance  of  $6,500.  In  his  security
clearance interview, he cited periods of unemployment and low paying jobs for why he
could not pay this debt. (Item 4 at 7.)
SOR  ¶   1.c:  past-due   utility   account   placed  for  collection   in  the   amount   of
$462. (Item 5 at 2-3.) Applicant states in his Answer the debt has been paid in full. He
included  an  undated  letter  with  no  letterhead,  which  appears to  be  from  the  collection
agent  representing  the  creditor,  which  states:  “Due  to  extenuating  circumstances,  a
request  is  being  sent  to  delete  the  report(s)  issued  by  our  office  to  Credit  Reporting
Agencies (CRAs). Although at this time we are requesting a deletion, please understand
out client(s) owns the account(s).” The letter lists the current balance of the debt as zero.
(AE-A.)  The  fact  the  letter  is  undated  and  is  not  on  official  letterhead  identifying  who
issued it raises questions about its timing and validity.
SOR ¶  1.d: past-due account  placed for collection  in the  amount  of  $353.  The
July 2022 credit report shows the debt as delinquent and assigned to collection in March
2022. (Item 5 at 2-3.) Applicant asserts this account is paid and that proof of payments is
included with his Answer. The Government noted his assertion and stated he  failed to
submit  documentary  evidence  to  support  that  the  account  had  been  settled.  After  the
Government  asserted  he  had  not  submitted  the  documentary  evidence  he  did  not
challenge  the  Government’s  statement  or  submit  the  documentary  evidence  in  his
Response. The documentary evidence he provided in his Response addressed a different
debt alleged on the SOR.
Applicant provides no further explanation and provides no further substantiating
documentation showing any action he had taken to resolve or address his accounts.
