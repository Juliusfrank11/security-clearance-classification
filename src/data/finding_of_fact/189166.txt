In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  she  admitted  all  the  allegations,  with
explanations. Her admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 48-year-old program analyst employed by defense contractors since
December 2005. She received a security clearance in November 2008.
Applicant  was  a  teacher  from  June  2002  until  she  was  hired  by  a  defense
contractor. She received an associate degree in teaching education in December 1995,
an associate degree in psychology in August 1996, a bachelor’s degree in education in
May 1998, and a master’s degree in education in August 2002.
Applicant married her high-school sweetheart in July 1999. Shortly after Applicant
married, she discovered that her then husband was an abusive alcoholic and an addicted
gambler.
In  May  2009,  as  Applicant  was  driving to  work at  a  Navy  facility,  she  was  rear-
ended  by  a  19-year-old  man  who  was  texting  while  driving.  She  suffered  severe  back
injuries that required extensive surgical repair. (Answer to SOR, TAB C at ¶ 6) As a result
of her injuries,  she  is unable  to  stand  for long periods of time, and  her ability  to move
around is limited. (Tr. 65)
Applicant’s  daughter, age 18, is autistic and has a sensory processing disorder,
combined  attention  deficit  disorder  and  attention  deficit  hyperactivity  disorder,
oppositional compulsive disorder, anxiety, and depression. She functions at the level of
age 12 or 13. (Tr. 15)
Applicant’s  special-needs daughter was mauled by a dog in October 2009, with
serious damage to her face. When Applicant’s then husband arrived at the hospital, he
was  drunk, and he  told  Applicant that  she  should be taking  care of  him  instead  of her
daughter. This event solidified Applicant’s decision to end the marriage. (Answer to SOR,
TAB C at ¶¶ 5, 7-9) They divorced in December 2011. (GX 1 at 28-29; Answer to SOR,
TAB C at ¶ 5; Tr. 34)
In 2012, Applicant met and began cohabitating with a retired Navy pilot. In 2013,
she sold her townhouse  so that she and her cohabitant  could build a new house. She
assumed that the new house would be titled in both names, but she later learned that it
was  titled  only  in  the  cohabitant’s  name.  Without  Applicant’s  knowledge,  he  used  a
keystroke  tracker  to  take  over  their  finances,  open  credit-card  accounts  in  her  name
without her knowledge, and gain access to her savings and retirement accounts. As their
relationship continued, her cohabitant became physically abusive. She left her cohabitant
in early 2015, and he stalked her repeatedly until she obtained a protective order against
him. (GX 2 at 3-5; Answer to SOR, TAB C at ¶ 16 and 17)
Between 2013 and 2017, Applicant and her ex-husband were involved in extensive
litigation regarding custody of their daughter and responsibility for her medical care. She
estimated that she spent about $15,000 for legal fees. (Answer to SOR, TAB C at ¶ 13-
14)
In 2016, Applicant’s pay was reduced by $30,000 per year when her employer lost
a contract. She was laid off and unemployed for about six weeks in June 2017. After she
worked at a lower-paying job for about a year, she found another position at about the
same pay as her 2016 job. (Answer to SOR, TAB C at ¶ 18)
In August 2019, the water main into Applicant’s home broke and flooded the entire
first floor. Her insurance had a $2,000 deductible, and she needed to take leave without
pay  for  three  weeks  to  deal  with  insurance  companies,  the  mortgage  holder,  and
contractors. (Answer to SOR, TAB C at ¶ 19) The  flood  destroyed  much  of  Applicant’s
documentation of her efforts to resolve her debts. (Tr. 73)
The SOR alleges seven delinquent debts. The evidence concerning these debts
is summarized below:
SOR  ¶  1.a:  Home  mortgage  loan  past  due  for  $3,850  with  a  balance  of
$240,958. A credit report dated June 13, 2022, reflects that this account is current. (GX
4 at 7) At the hearing, Applicant testified that she was in the process of refinancing this
loan to lower her payments. (Tr. 43) The refinancing has been completed, but the record
does not reflect how much her monthly payments were reduced. (AX H)
SOR  ¶  1.b:  Credit-card  account  placed  for  collection  of  $1,278.  Applicant
testified  that  this  debt  was  incurred  for  veterinary  services  for  her  pets.  She  and  her
daughter have volunteered for an animal rescue program for pets that have disabilities
that keep them from being adopted. They currently have eight cats. Caring for the cats is
therapy for her daughter. (Tr. 78) Now that Applicant’s income has returned to its previous
level, she has been able to resolve this debt. The creditor has agreed to settle this debt
for $703, to be paid in monthly installments of $234, beginning in July 2023. (AX J at 8;
Tr. 44-45)
SOR ¶ 1.c: Credit-card account placed for collection of $3,673. The June 2022
credit report reflects that this account was charged off. (GX 4 at 9) Applicant testified that
she does not recognize this debt, but it probably is a credit card that her ex-cohabitant
opened in her name. (Tr. 45) She was afraid to dispute this debt because it would involve
contacting her ex-cohabitant. The creditor has agreed to settle the debt for $1,600, to be
paid in three monthly payments. Applicant made the first payment  of $600 on April 24,
2023. (AX J at 1-2)
SOR  ¶  1.d  and  1.e:  Credit-card  accounts  placed  for  collection  of  $27,114.
Applicant testified that these credit-card accounts were opened by her ex-cohabitant in
her name. Both accounts have been paid. (AX G at 3)
SOR  ¶ 1.e: Credit union  debt placed  for collection of $28,142.  This is a  car
loan that Applicant refinanced at a lower rate with another lender. The account is current.
(AX G at 8)
SOR  ¶  1.f:  Credit-card  account  placed  for  collection  of  $14,366.  Applicant
testified that this was another credit card opened in her name by her ex-cohabitant. (Tr.
46) She accepted a settlement offer and made the first payment of $200 on May 2, 2023.
(AX J at 2-5)
SOR  ¶  1.g:  Credit-card  account  placed  for  collection  of  $3,636.  Applicant
testified  that  this  credit  card  was  solely  in  her  name.  (Tr.  47)  She  testified  that  she
received a settlement offer about two weeks before the hearing. (Tr. 75) In a post-hearing
narrative, she stated that a customer-service representative for the creditor informed her
that the creditor had filed an IRS Form 1099 for the entire balance, but that it was willing
to  reduce  the  balance  to  $1,454,  to  be  paid  in  11 monthly  installments.  Applicant  was
unable  to obtain documentary confirmation of  this conversation by  the date  the  record
closed. (AX J at 6)
A program manager for a defense contractor has known Applicant since May 2017
and is familiar with her family situation and her daughter’s medical issues. He has found
her to be meticulous in safeguarding classified information and trustworthy in completing
jobs competently and on time. He states that Applicant’s “big heart, trustworthiness, and
helpful nature is evident both at home and in the office.” (Answer to SOR, TAB D at 1-4)
A licensed  daycare  provider who  has cared  for Applicant’s daughter since  2011
submitted a declaration attesting to Applicant’s devotion to her daughter, her tenacity in
facing  financial  difficulties,  her  good  judgment,  and  her  ability  to  protect  sensitive
information. (AX D at 5-7)
An emergency medical service chief has been Applicant’s friend since 1989. He is
familiar with Applicant’s responses to her financial difficulties. He considers her one of the
most honest people he knows. He has observed that her level of focus and drive is “higher
than most people [he] knows.” (AX D at 9-10)
In January 2018, Applicant completed financial counseling from a state-approved
credit  counseling  agency.  (AX  E  at  13)  She  has  been  selected  by  her  employer  for  a
leadership  development  program.  (AX  J  at  8)  She  completed  additional  financial
counseling on May 10, 2023. (AX J at 9) She received a pay raise in December 2022.
Her current annual salary is $113,311. (AX E at 16) The pay raise has enabled her to set
aside about $1,200 per month to resolve her debts. (Tr. 76)
