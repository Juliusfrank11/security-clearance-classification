Applicant is 38 years old and has been employed by a DoD contractor since 2022.
She has never married and has no children. Applicant earned a bachelor’s degree in 2007
and  a  professional  certification  in  2009.  She  has  owned  her  home  since  July  2017.
Applicant was granted national security eligibility in about 2009. She seeks to reestablish
her eligibility and be granted a security clearance in connection with her recently obtained
employment. (Item 2 at 5, 7, 9-10, 18-19, 32-33.)
Guideline F, Financial Considerations
The Government alleged in this paragraph of the SOR that Applicant is ineligible
for  a  clearance  because  she  is  financially  overextended  and  therefore  potentially
unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.
The  SOR  lists  18  debts  that  are  charged-off  or  in  collection.  The  total  amount  of  the
delinquent debts is approximately $43,000. The existence and amount of these debts are
supported by Applicant’s admissions in her Answer to all of the SOR allegations and by
credit reports in the record, dated January 18, 2023; July 28, 2022; and December 28,
2021. (Items 3, 4, and 5.)
Applicant disclosed in her e-QIP that her financial delinquencies were caused by
difficult personal issues and other hardships over the past three years (2019-2021), which
were  exacerbated  by  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  She  wrote  that  she  hoped  to  begin
repaying her debts once she was able to do so. According to her employment history in
her  e-QIP,  she  experienced  five  months  of  unemployment  in  2021  and  13  months  of
unemployment in 2019-2020. The record is silent as to when she began working for the
DoD  contractor  in  2022  and  whether  she  had  additional  unemployment  after  she
submitted her e-QIP in December 2021. (Answer at 1-3; Item 2 at 10, 13.)
