Guideline F - Financial Considerations
1.a.  and  1.b.  The  first  two  admitted  past-due  debts  are  to  the  Small  Business
Administration  (SBA)  in  the  amounts  of  about  $319,766  and  $53,385,  respectively.
Applicant  was  in  a  start-up  business  with  two  partners,  a  married  couple.  He  left  the
start-up  in  2016.  His  partners  subsequently  filed  for  a  business  bankruptcy  and  later
divorced. Applicant was contacted by the U.S.  Treasury Department after the fact. His
wages are being garnished to satisfy his share of the $319,766 SBA loan. (TR at page
