In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, she admitted all allegations. Her admissions are
incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  34  years  old.  She  attended  high  school  through  2008,  but  did  not
graduate.  From  2009  through  2010,  Applicant  attended  a  career-focused  technical
school, ultimately earning  a medical assistance  diploma or degree in  December 2010.
Applicant married in 2012, but separated from her spouse in 2015. The couple have been
in the process of divorce since 2016. They have two children, ages 14 and 9 years old.
Applicant has resided with a cohabitant since 2018. (GE 2 and GE 3)
Applicant  was  first  sponsored  for  a  security  clearance  after  being  hired  as  an
engineering  technician  for  a  defense  contractor  in  January  2017.  She  completed  and
certified her security clearance application (SCA) on October 25, 2017. In early 2018, her
employer lost the federal contract, but she was rehired by the new contractor for a short
time. She was laid off in April 2018 and unemployed through at least November 2018, at
the time of her investigative interview. She received child support payments of $406 every
two weeks. (GE 2 and GE 3)
In March 2018, Applicant was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol
(DUI).  She  pled  guilty  to  DUI  and  as  part  of her  punishment,  she  paid  fines,  attended
court-ordered alcohol counseling, and was required to have her car fitted with an interlock
device until November 2018. (GE 3)
Applicant has been employed by a federal contractor since at least August 2020.
(GE 4 at 2, and GE 5 at 1) In email correspondence dated August 23, 2022, Applicant
states she  “[has] a  good  paying  job  that is allowing  [her] to  get [her] financial situation
under control.” (AE A)
The SOR alleges 11 delinquent debts totaling about $32,000. The debts consist of
four delinquent consumer accounts of about $15,100 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.j, and 1.k) and
seven defaulted student loans of about $16,900 (SOR ¶¶ 1.c through 1.i). The debts are
established  through  Applicant’s admissions and  four credit bureau reports. (GE 1, and
GE 3 through GE 6). She reported no financial issues in her October 2017 SCA. She also
denied being delinquent on any federal debt; and, in the last seven years, defaulting on
any type of loan; having bills or debts turned over to collections; having any account or
credit card suspended; and being delinquent over 120 days on any debt. (GE 2)
Several delinquent  debts  included  in  GE  4  through  GE  7  are  not  alleged  in  the
SOR.  For  example,  there  are  six  non-SOR  medical  debts;  four  of  these  debts  were
assigned to collections in 2013 and 2014; the remaining two were assigned to collections
in  2017.  Any  non-SOR  derogatory  information  will  not  be  considered  for  disqualifying
purposes  but  may  be  considered  in  the  application  of  extenuating  and  mitigating
conditions, and in the whole-person analysis. See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App.
Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (GE 4 through GE 7)
In  August  2022,  well  after  issuance  of  the  SOR  in  February  2022,  Applicant
entered  into  a  48-month  debt  resolution  contract  (contract)  with  a  debt-settlement
company  (company).  Under  the  contract,  the  company  agreed  to  resolve  seven
delinquent debts totaling $15,708. (AE A) Four debts in the contract are alleged in SOR
¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.j, and 1.k. Three non-SOR debts in the contract are a medical account and
two credit card accounts that were opened in August 2021. The evidence shows Applicant
exceeded the creditors’ credit card limits in both accounts. (GE 5, pp. 4 and 8).
Applicant attributed her financial problems to her “[inability] to afford her debts at
hand  due  to  financial  hardship;”  and  being  laid  off  in  April  2018  followed  by  her
unemployment for a period of time afterwards. Applicant also points to her status as a
single  mother  of  two  children,  with  an  economy  “going  up”  as  factors  that  negatively
impacted her ability to repay delinquent debts. (GE 1 and AE A).
In her Response to the SOR, Applicant distinguished her delinquent debts between
non-student loans, and student loans. For non-student loan debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a,
1.b, 1.j, and 1.k, she commented: “[These] are debts that I need to contact the collectors
to see what payment plan I can afford or see what I can work out to resolve the issue.”
For student loan debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.c through 1.i, she commented:
For the longest time I was on a hardship form (sic) due to being a single
mother with two children and the economy going up. I did not remit that form
in time. Before I could start another form COVID-19 hit and my payments
were  not  need[ed]  at  the  time  because  the  President  put  all  education
payments on relief momentarily. I am aware that I still need to pay that once
it’s lifted. I will then apply for a hardship application. (GE 1)
The  available  credit  bureau  reports  do  not  show  payments  on  the  delinquent
student loans alleged in the SOR. (GE 4 through GE 7) Though Applicant signed the debt
resolution  contract  in  August  2022,  she  has  not  provided  proof  of  actual  payments  in
accordance with the contract. (AE A). The evidence also shows her debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b
and 1.k were either charged off or in a collection status in 2017. (GE 4)
