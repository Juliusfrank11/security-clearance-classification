In  his  answer, Applicant admitted  SOR ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b  and  denied  SOR ¶¶  1.c -
1.n. He asserted  that the  debts alleged  in 1.c and  1.d  had  been  resolved, and  that the
debts  alleged  in 1.e-1.n  were  no  longer delinquent.  His  admissions are incorporated  into
my   findings  of  fact.   Based   on   my  review  of  the   pleadings,  evidence   submitted,  and
testimony, I make the following  additional findings of fact:
Applicant is 38 years old. He was married in 2008. He has two minor children and
two  adult  children.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2006,  and  a  master’s  degree  in
2010. He owns an information technology company as a sole proprietor and does contract
work for a government contractor. He started this business in 2010. He received his first
security clearance in 2007. (Tr. 22-26; GE 1)
The SOR alleges failure to file seven years of federal and state income tax returns,
two  delinquent  credit  card  debts,  and  ten  past-due  student  loans.  The  status  of  the
allegations is as follows:
SOR ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b  are failure to file federal and state income tax returns for tax
years 2013-2019. Applicant admitted these allegations. He stated that  starting in 2013,
he  was  irresponsible and  failed  to  maintain a  record  of  his  business  expenditures.  He
asserted that he requires this information to file his tax returns, because it will reduce his
tax liability. During this time, he was a subcontractor, and no taxes or deductions were
taken out of payments made to him by the prime contractor. Applicant has not paid any
federal or state income taxes for tax years 2013-2019. He was told that he was required
to make quarterly tax payments by his CPA but failed to do so. He claims that he will file
income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2013-2019  sometime  in  2023,  after  he  collects  the
necessary  business  expense  information  for  his  accountant.  These  tax  issues  are
unresolved. (Tr. 27-35, 77-102; GE 1; AE C, H)
Applicant claimed that he filed his tax year 2020 and 2021 income tax returns. He
provided  two  unsigned  and  undated  federal  income  tax  returns  showing  that  he  owed
$36,606 and $30,728 for these years, respectively. He did not submit any documentary
evidence regarding his state income tax returns for these years. During the hearing we
discussed  the  insufficiency  of  the  evidence  provided,  but  he  did  not  provide  sufficient
documentation  after the  hearing  showing  that  these  returns  had  been  filed or that any
payments have been made to the IRS or the state. (Tr. 27-35, 77-102; AE D)
SOR ¶  1.c is a credit card account placed for collection for $7,750. This debt was
subsequently  charged  off.  Applicant  claimed  that  he  had  the  bill  for  this  account  paid
monthly on  autopay. He  stated that he did not open the statements  when he received
them. He claimed that at some point autopay stopped working and the creditor closed the
account for non-payment without his knowledge. He claimed that this debt has been paid,
but he did not provide sufficient documentation supporting that assertion. He did provide
a one-page document showing that he made monthly payments from November 2017 to
March 2020, but it does not show the amounts paid or that there is a zero balance. This
debt is unresolved. (Tr. 35-38, 105-108; GE 2; AE K)
SOR ¶  1.d is a credit card account that has been charged off for $222. Applicant
claimed that he stopped using this credit card, but he was still charged an annual fee.
Since he did not look at the statements, the fee was unpaid and the account was charged
off.  He  claimed  that  this  debt  has  been  paid,  but  he  did  not  provide  sufficient
documentation showing that it is resolved. (Tr. 38-40,102-105; GE 2, 3, 4; AE E)
SOR  ¶¶   1.e-1.n  are  past-due  student  loan  accounts  totaling  $98,128.  Applicant
stated  that  these  accounts  are  from  his  undergraduate  and  graduate  education.  He
claimed  that  he  was  behind  on  payments  from  about  July  2017  to  about  May  2019
because  his pay  was delayed  about three months  after he  started  a  new contract.  He
claimed  that  after  about  three  months,  he  resumed  his  regular  monthly  payment,  and
caught up on his payments in about May 2019. He did not contact the lender to resolve
the issue. He claimed that the loans were put into the COVID-19 forbearance program
after March 2020. (Tr. 40-42, 97-102, 114; GE 2, 3)
Post hearing, Applicant submitted a document showing his record of student-loan
payments. It shows that he started repayment in April 2013 and made monthly payments
until January 2017.  In 2017, he  missed  payments  for four non-consecutive  months.  In
2018,  he  missed  payments  for  five  non-consecutive  months.  In  2019,  he  missed
payments  for  three  non-consecutive  months  and  the  loans  were  listed  as  120  days  or
greater past due on his credit report from that year. His last payment was in March 2020.
His  February  2022  credit  report  shows  the  loans  as  current  because  they  are  in  the
forbearance program. (GE 3; AE J)
Applicant  did  not  provide  documentation  of  his  current  finances,  to  include  his
monthly income or expenses, or his savings.  When questioned about these matters at
the hearing, he was evasive in answering some questions, and failed to provide requested
documentation  to  substantiate  his  claims.  He  reported  his  gross  income  is  about
$250,000 yearly, and that his wife earns about $12,000 yearly. He was asked to provide
an  estimate  of  his  monthly  expenses,  and  he  estimated  between  $8,000-$10,000
monthly. He was unable to explain what he did with the remaining $130,000+ of  yearly
income. He and his wife each drive a Tesla, and their monthly payments total about $2000
for both cars. Two of his children have cars from 2015 that he purchased for them. Every
month, he puts money into his investments, in varying amounts. He reported taking three
significant vacations in the last four years, including Europe in 2018, Mexico in 2020, and
the Caribbean in 2021. He and his wife own a home that they bought in 2014, which he
asserts is  now  valued at  almost  $900,000. He  is also  an  investor in  a  home  which he
claims is valued at over $400,000. He has not had credit counseling. (Tr. 52-77; 116-118;
GE 1; AE F)
Applicant submitted a professional character letter which stated that he is a skilled,
reliable, and professional worker. He submitted a personal character letter in which the
writer stated that he was unaware that Applicant had any financial concerns or difficulties.
