In his answer, Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.j-1.o. He denied
SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.g-1.i, and 1.p. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact.
After review of the pleadings, testimony, and evidence submitted, I make the following
additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  31   years  old.   He  has  never  married,  and   has  one   minor  child.  He
earned a bachelor’s degree in 2015. He was granted a security clearance in about 2018,
and he  works as  a  junior systems administrator for a  government contractor.  (Tr.  23-27;
GE 1)
After graduating college, Applicant worked in retail and was laid off when the store
closed  in  about  September  2016.  This  caused  a  financial  burden  until  he  found
employment  with  a  government  contractor  after  about  two  months.  He  worked  for  this
employer for about two years before he was laid off in August 2018, when the contract
ended. He found new work two months later, with a different government contractor, in
November 2018. He asserted that the 2018 period of unemployment is one of the main
reasons for his financial problems. He stated that he did not have enough money to meet
his  expenses,  and  utilized  his  credit  cards,  worked  at  a  grocery  store,  and  borrowed
money from family during this time period. The record shows that in 2018, he only made
about half of his current salary. (Tr. 20-38; GE 1, 8; AE J)
Applicant stated that in 2019, his roommate broke their lease early and absconded
without paying some apartment fees and utility bills. Applicant’s car was also repossessed
that year, which left him with greater transportation and commuting expenses. He stated
that he prioritized paying back family members who loaned him money after he was laid
off. He asserted that he did not have enough funds to repay the credit cards he used while
unemployed. (Tr. 20-38; GE 1, 8)
After  the  COVID-19  pandemic  started  in  2020,  Applicant’s  pregnant  girlfriend
became unemployed. He assisted her with her monthly expenses for about ten months.
After their son was born in October 2020, he paid for their living expenses and some of
the  costs  of  the  baby.  In  about  April  2021,  his  son  started  attending  daycare,  and
Applicant has been paying approximately $700 monthly for it since then. Applicant also
had a $1500 state tax debt that he paid off with $133 monthly payments from April 2021
to March 2022. The tax debt is now resolved and was not alleged in the SOR. (Tr. 20-60,
86-91; AE A, D, I)
In  late 2021,  Applicant  realized that he did not  earn enough money  to meet his
monthly expenses and repay his delinquent debt. He met with a debt consolidation expert
and a credit repair expert to  assist him with resolving his financial delinquencies. Both
experts advised him to consult with a bankruptcy attorney. While Applicant’s  consumer
and medical debt only totaled about $8,300, his attorney advised him to file a Chapter 7
Bankruptcy to get a fresh start on his finances. Applicant also received credit counseling
during this time and developed a monthly budget. He filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in June
2022, and his debts were discharged in September 2022. (Tr. 20-38, 73-91; GE 5, 6, 7;
AE G, H)
The SOR alleges about $30,000 of delinquent debt, including: $21,876 of student
loan  debt,  $1,830  of  medical  debt,  and  $6,553  of  consumer  debt.  The  status  of  the
allegations is as follows:
SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c, 1.e, and 1.f are federal student loans in collection totaling $21,876.
Applicant attended college between 2010-2015. He stated that after graduation, he had
a  forbearance  on  the  loans  for  about  a  year.  In  2017,  he  made  some  $115  monthly
payments,  but  these  stopped  in early  2018 because  he  could  not afford them  with his
salary and monthly expenses at the time. In December 2022, he contacted the lender to
enroll in a fresh start program. As part of his post hearing submission, Applicant provided
a letter from the lender stating that his student loan payments were paused as part of the
President’s student debt relief program, and that he would not have to make payments
while the litigation is ongoing. His most recent credit report shows these loans as current,
and it’s likely these federal student loans were also placed in the Covid-19 forbearance
program. (Tr 38-60, 73-86; GE 2, 3, 4, 8; AE B)
SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.m, and 1.n are credit cards charged off for $3,067, $90, and $1,050,
respectively. Applicant stated that he used these credit cards for his living expenses while
he was laid off in 2018, and that these debts were discharged in his 2022 bankruptcy.
The bankruptcy records show that the first two debts were discharged, but not the last
one. (Tr. 20-38, 60-64; GE  2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8)
SOR ¶¶ 1.g, 1.j, and 1.k are medical debts placed for collection for $961, $509,
and $360, respectively. Applicant stated that two of the medical debts (1.g and 1.k) were
discharged in his 2022 bankruptcy, and the bankruptcy record reflects this. He was not
sure  why  the  third  debt  (1.j)  was  not  included  in  the  bankruptcy.  He  stated  that  since
January 2023 he has been making $50 monthly payments to this creditor and provided
documentation showing his last payment from February 2023. (Tr. 20-38, 64-66; GE  3,
4, 6, 7, 8; AE C)
SOR  ¶  1.h  is  a  debt  in  collection  to  a  cellular  phone  service  provider  for  $581.
Applicant  claimed  that  he  disputed  this  debt  because  it  was  a  work  phone  that  he
returned, but the billing continued. He stated that this debt was discharged in his 2022
bankruptcy, but it is not listed on the bankruptcy petition. (Tr. 20-38, 67-71; GE 3, 4, 6, 7,
8)
SOR  ¶  1.i  is  a  debt  in  collection  to  a  cellular  phone  service  provider  for  $561.
Applicant  claimed  that he  disputed  this debt because  he  traded  in his phone  when he
switched carriers and the new carrier was responsible to pay off the debt. He stated that
this  debt  was   discharged   in   his 2022   bankruptcy, but  it   is not  listed   on   the   bankruptcy
petition.  (Tr. 20-38, 67-71; GE 3, 4, 6, 7, 8)
SOR  ¶  1.l  is  a  debt  in  collection  for  a  cable  tv  and  internet  provider  for  $360.
Applicant  claimed  that  this  is  one  of  the  bills  that  his  roommate  left  him  with  after
absconding  early  from  their  apartment.  He  stated  that  this  debt  was  discharged  in  his
2022 bankruptcy, but it is not listed on the bankruptcy petition. (Tr. 20-38, 67-71; GE 3,
4, 6, 7, 8)
SOR  ¶  1.o  is a  debt in  collection  for apartment  rental fees  for $607. Applicant
claimed that he was left with these fees when his roommate absconded early from their
apartment lease. He stated that this debt was discharged in his 2022 bankruptcy, but it is
not listed on the bankruptcy petition. (Tr. 20-38, 67-71; GE 3, 4, 6, 7, 8)
SOR  ¶  1.p  is  a  debt  in  collection  to  a  cellular  phone  service  provider  for  $284.
Applicant claimed that he disputed this debt because  he traded in this phone when he
switched carriers and the new carrier was responsible to pay off the debt. He stated that
this debt  was  discharged  in his 2022  bankruptcy, but  it is not  listed  on  the bankruptcy
petition. (Tr. 20-38, 67-71; GE 3, 4, 6, 7, 8)
Applicant’s budget shows that his net monthly income is about $4,100, and that he
has about $560 leftover after he pays his monthly expenses. (Tr. 38-60; GE 8; AE G, H)
Applicant submitted five character reference letters, which state that he is a valued
employee, a respected member of the community, reliable, and trustworthy. (AE I)
