In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions
are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 22-year-old craftsman employed by a defense contractor since July
2018. He graduated from high school in June 2018. He resided with a cohabitant  from
December 2018 until they married in July 2020. He has no children. He has never held a
security clearance. (GX 1 at 7, 12, 17-18; Tr. 22)
The SOR alleges eight delinquent medical debts totaling about $25,792 that have
been placed for collection. The debts are reflected in credit reports from February 2021
and August 2022. (GX 4; GX 5)
Applicant testified he suffers from an autoimmune disease and his body does not
produce enough white blood cells. Until March 2020, he went to a hospital once a month
for treatment. He lived with his parents until he was 18 years old, and he was covered by
his  father’s  medical  insurance.  (Tr.  15-17)  He  now  has  medical  insurance  through  his
employer, but his white blood cell count is not low enough to be covered by his insurance.
He stopped obtaining treatment in March 2020. (Tr. 21-22)
When Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in February 2021, he
told the investigator that he was unaware of the medical debts. However, he also told the
investigator  that  he  had  a  payment  plan  providing  for  monthly  $50  payments  to  the
hospital  where  he  received  the  treatments.  (GX  2)  At  the  hearing,  he  testified  that  he
made one $50 payment to the collection agency in December 2020, but he had not made
any  further  payments.  When  asked  why  he  had  not  made  any  further  payments,  he
responded: “There’s really no rhyme or reason. I just – because I looked at my credit one
time and saw that I had been going up, even though those bills were in collections, I didn’t
do anything about it and didn’t think twice about it.” He does not believe that the lack of a
clearance will have any financial impact on his career. (Tr. 25-27)
Applicant’s foreman considers him a proficient mechanic who has an exceptional
work ethic and sometimes goes beyond his assignments. He states that Applicant needs
a security clearance to be able to work as a pipefitter in restricted areas of submarines.
