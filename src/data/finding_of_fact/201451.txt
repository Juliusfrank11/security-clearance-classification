Applicant is a 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his  current  employer  or  a  successor  company  since  October  2017.  He  earned  a
bachelor’s  degree  in  2011.  He  is  married  with  two  children,  ages  22  and  17,  and  an
adult stepchild. (Tr. at 17, 21, 24-25, 41; GE 1)
Applicant  developed  financial  problems  between  about  2014  and  2017.  He
attributed  the  problems  to  “[u]nexpected  medical  bills  along  with  increased  mortgage
and  utilities.”  He  and his  wife  bought  a  new  home  in  2013.  The  costs  associated  with
home  ownership,  such  as  maintenance,  repairs,  and  utilities,  were  more  than  he
expected. In about 2016, they decided that they could not pay their mortgage and their
credit cards, and they stopped paying their credit cards. He also did not pay his student
loans. (Tr. at 16-18, 23-24; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2)
The  SOR  alleges  eight  delinquent  consumer  debts  totaling  about  $14,445  and
nine defaulted student loans totaling about $35,650. The debts are established through
credit reports and Applicant’s admissions.
Applicant’s student loans were transferred  to a new servicer to collect the loans
in about 2019. He started making $450 payments in December 2019, which was broken
down  into  individual  loans.  From  December  2019  through  June  2020,  he  made  nine
$450 payments ($4,050). The loans were then considered rehabilitated and current, and
they  were  transferred  back  to  the  original  servicer.  His  federal  student  loan  payments
were then paused pursuant to COVID-19 relief. The pause was extended several times.
It  is  currently  extended  through  at  least  June  2023.  (Tr.  at  25,  32,  41-42;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 3-6; AE A-C, E, 1, 2)
Applicant  settled  and  paid  four  of  the  alleged  consumer  debts.  He  settled  an
$855 debt (SOR ¶ 1.h) for $770 in January 2023; a $1,022 debt (SOR ¶ 1.f) for $766 in
February 2023; a $2,090 debt (SOR ¶ 1.d) for $1,671 in March 2023; and a $940 debt
(SOR ¶ 1.g) for $658 in March 2023. (Tr. at 30-32; GE 3-6; AE D, J, K, 1, 5(a)-7(b))
Applicant’s finances have improved since he obtained his current job in 2017. He
and  his  wife  continued  to  pay  their  secured  loans  (mortgage,  auto).  They  built  up  an
emergency fund. As he  progressed and  received  raises, he started  paying his student
loans  and  other  debts.  He  paid  a  $4,734  credit  card  debt  that  was  not  alleged  in  the
SOR and at least one debt that was in his wife’s name. He studied the advice of noted
financial expert Dave Ramsey and is using his “snowball” method of paying the smallest
debt  first,  and  then  moving  on  to  the  next  smallest  debt.  His  current  salary  is  about
$105,000  a  year, and his wife  earns about $60,000 as  a  teacher. He  credibly  testified
that he intends to pay the remaining delinquent debts and his student loans when they
come out of the pause. He is committed to obtaining and maintaining financial stability.
