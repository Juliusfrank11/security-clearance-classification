Applicant  admitted  the  SOR  allegations,  with  explanations.  His  admissions  are
adopted  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  review  of  the  pleadings  and  evidence,  I  make  the
additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  46  years  old.  He  has  worked  for  his  current  employer,  a  defense
contractor, since November 2006, as an x-ray technician. He has an associate degree.
He is divorced and he has eight children. (Tr. 6, 19-20; GE 1)
these  allegations
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  failed  to  file  his  2000-2002  and  his  2005-2019
federal income tax returns as required (SOR ¶ 1.a). It further alleged that he failed to file
his  2000-2002  and  his  2005-2019  state  income  tax  returns  as  required  (SOR  ¶  1.b).
Applicant  admitted
in  his  security  clearance  application,  his
background investigation, his response to interrogatories, his SOR answer, and during
his hearing testimony. Applicant admitted that he has not filed any of these past federal
and  state  tax  returns.  He  admitted  he  just  did  not  put  forth  the  effort  to  file  his  tax
returns. He explained that when he paid for a tax preparation service to file his returns
in  the  late  1990s  and  he  did  not  receive  a  refund,  he  could  not  see  the  point  in
continuing to file his returns if he was not going to receive a refund---so he did not file.
He  only  filed  his  2003  and  2004  tax  returns  because  he  needed  to  do  so  in  order  to
enroll  in  college.  He  also  admitted  he  did  not  file  his  federal  tax  returns  out  of  spite
toward the IRS. He claims to have recently contacted another tax preparation service to
help  him  file  his  past  tax  returns,  but  he  provided  no  further  information  about  this
arrangement. His tax-filing issues remain unresolved. (Tr. 23-27, 40-42; GE 1-3)
The  SOR  also  alleged  Applicant  owed  two  delinquent  accounts  totaling
approximately  $4,000.  (¶¶  1.c-1.d)  Applicant  admitted  owing  these  debts  in  his  SOR
answer.  In  his  hearing  testimony,  he  indicated  that  he  had  either  settled  or  paid  both
debts. His most recent credit report in February 2023, supports his assertions because
neither debt is listed therein. These debts are resolved. (Tr. 33-35; GE 5, SOR answer)
Applicant’s  annual  salary  is  approximately  $81,000.  He  has  approximately
$7,000 in his checking accounts. (Tr. 38, 42)
