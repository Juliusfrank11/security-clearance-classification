Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.h. She denied SOR ¶¶ 1.a, and 1.i –  1.m. Her
admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  49  years  old.  She  and  her  husband  have  been  married  since
November 2018. She has an adult son and an adult daughter. She earned an associate
degree in 2007. She has worked for various federal contractors in various government
departments since at least 2007, and for her current employer since 2017. She has held
a security clearance since about 2005 or 2006, granted most recently in 2014. Her current
annual salary is about $100,000. (GE 1; Tr. 11, 37-38, 51-56) Her husband is a plumber.
She was unable to estimate his income and said they handle their finances separately.
(Tr. 53-54)
Applicant disclosed $25,000 in federal income tax debt on her September 2019
SCA. (GE 1 at 47) In her October 2019 background interview, she said her 2010 federal
taxes were audited in 2013 due to an error by a tax preparer. She then set up a payment
plan of $389 a month. That amount was “reset” in 2015, and she said she had been trying
to restart a workable repayment plan. She also discussed other debts in her interview.
(GE 5)
Applicant explained that she had a small hair-braiding business in 2010 trying to
make  extra  money.  She  had  a  new  job  at  that  time  and  was  also  a  new  parent.  She
maintained the business from 2010 to 2013. She made less than $10,000 a year in that
job. In 2013, she was audited over her TY 2010 taxes and had tax issues as a result of
certain expenses that she could not document, like mileage expenses. (Tr. 35-36, 40-41,
56-58)
Applicant  further  explained  during  her  testimony  that  she  retained  a  new  tax
specialist  and  was  on  a  tax  repayment  plan  from  about  2013  to  2015.  She  then  had
additional tax problems in 2015 and 2016. In 2018, she was married and said she had
tax issues with her name change. She wanted to get on a payment plan for as many years
as possible. (Tr. 34)
Applicant  acknowledged  that  her  later  tax  issues  were  likely  due  to  insufficient
withholdings. (Tr. 42-44, 59) She last revised her W-4 to address her withholdings in 2017
(before she was married) She said she does not owe federal taxes for years after 2017.
(SOR  ¶  1.h  alleges  $5,777  in  past-due  taxes  for  TY  2018,  but  she  asserted  that  was
incorrect since she was on disability leave for six weeks after surgery). (Tr. 42-44) The
last time Applicant prepared her own tax returns was 2016. That is now done by a family
member. (Tr. 45)
Applicant  denied that her tax  issues  resulted  from  living  above  her means.  She
was  caring  for  her  child  at  the  time.  She  has  had  several  vacations  to  international
destinations but asserted that they were gifts from family members. (Tr. 59-62)
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges that Applicant failed to file her 2019 federal income tax return
as  required.  (GE  2  at  16)  She  admitted  the  allegation  in  her  Answer.  In  her  hearing
testimony she asserted that she filed this return on time. (Tr. 38-39) The IRS tax transcript
indicates she filed the return in late July 2021. A $1,115 credit was transferred to address
her 2010 tax debt. (AE C)
The  rest  of  the  SOR  allegations  concern  past-due  income  taxes.  This  includes
federal income tax debt, from tax years (TY) 2010-2014 and TY 2016-2018 (SOR ¶¶ 1.b
– 1.h), as well as state tax liens (entered between 2015 and 2018) and other state income
tax debts, from TY 2019 and 2020 (SOR ¶¶ 1.i – 1.m).
Federal income taxes
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges $5,719 in past-due federal income taxes from TY 2010. (GE 2
at 1) In July 2021, a $1,115 credit was transferred from her TY 2019 refund to address
this  debt.  (AE  C)  As  of  February  2022,  she  owed  $4,596.  (AE  D)  After  the  hearing,
Applicant indicated that she had been unable to acquire her 2010 federal tax transcript
from  the  IRS,  since  it  was  too  old.  She  was  told  in  an  “online  chat”  with  an  IRS
representative to file a form to request it. (AE Q) She asserted that her federal income tax
debt from TY 2010 was now “dissolved,” but this is undocumented. (AE P; Tr. 50)
Applicant  owes  several  thousand  dollars  in  past-due  federal  income  taxes  from
later tax years. This includes SOR ¶ 1.c -- $8,860 from TY 2011 (GE 2 at 4); SOR ¶ 1.d
-- $10,428 from TY 2012 (GE 2 at 6); SOR ¶ 1.e -- $9,907 from TY 2013 (GE 2 at 8); SOR
¶ 1.f -- $3,900 from TY 2014 (GE 2 at 10); SOR ¶ 1.g -- $8,178 from TY 2016 (GE 2 at
12); and SOR ¶ 1.h -- $5,777 from TY 2018. (GE 2 at 14) No past-due federal taxes are
alleged  for  TY  2015  or  2017.  The  federal  tax  debts  alleged  in  the  SOR  total  about
$52,789, and she admitted these SOR allegations without further comment
In April 2022 (after receiving the SOR), Applicant submitted a proposed installment
agreement to the IRS to address her tax debts of $61,782 from the above tax years. She
proposed  paying  $300 a  month  until 2026,  when  she  would  increase  her payments  to
$650  a  month  (AE  B) An  earlier  proposal  from  the  IRS,  also  from  April  2022,  noted  a
minimum acceptable monthly repayment amount of $700. (AE A) Around this time, she
spoke to an IRS representative who suggested she resubmit her $300 request. (Tr. 49-
50)
Applicant testified that she is not currently on a repayment plan with the IRS for
her  past-due  federal  income  taxes.  She  is  still  waiting  for  the  agency  to  approve  her
repayment proposal. (Tr. 49) She acknowledged that she had not taken any further action
since April 2022 when the IRS requested at least $700 a month, which she was not able
to  pay.  (Tr.  69-73)  She  asserted  that  she  has  been  working  diligently  to  address  her
federal  tax  debt  and  would  like  to  submit  an  offer  in  compromise  (to  lessen  the  tax
burden). She intends to submit a proposal for an installment agreement and pay the debt,
as she is doing for her state tax debt. (Tr. 52-53, 69, 81)
Applicant filed her TY 2020 federal income tax return on or about April 15, 2021
and was issued a refund of $185. (GE 2 at 17; Tr. 65-66) (It likely was redirected towards
her tax debt from other years). She filed her TY 2019 state and federal returns in 2021 as
well. (GE 4 at 49-50; AE C) She asserted during the hearing that she had filed her 2021
state and federal tax returns on time. She has not filed her 2022  state and federal tax
returns, which were due the day before the hearing. (Tr. 33-35, 39-40, 65-68)
After the hearing, Applicant provided copies of her 2021 federal and state income
tax returns. It is not clear from the documents when they were filed, but she said they
were filed on time. For TY 2021, she was due a federal refund of $1,937 but owed $1,430
in state taxes. (AE P, AE R, AE S) She paid the state taxes owed with money orders, on
May 6, 2022. (AE T)
State Tax liens and past due tax debts:
SOR ¶ 1.i alleges that Applicant owes $11,649 in past-due state income taxes as
the result of a September 2015 tax lien. (GE 3 at 1)
SOR ¶¶ 1.j ($2,249) and 1.k ($2,297) allege past-due state income taxes as the
result of two additional tax liens, issued in January and February 2018, respectively. (GE
3 at 2, 3)
SOR ¶¶ 1.l ($1,514) and 1.m (also $1,514) allege past-due state income tax debt
from TY 2019 and TY 2020, respectively. (GE 4 at 43, 49)
Applicant denied these allegations, noting that she had entered a repayment plan
in 2022. (Tr. 46-49, 75-77) She made $349 monthly payments for four months in early
2022 (AE K) As of March 28, 2022, the balance due was just over $27,000. (AE G) By
May 2, 2022, she was in default, having missed two payments. (AE H) She made efforts
to contact the state to address the matter (AE J) but the repayment plan was canceled by
the state by the end of May 2022, with a balance due of $27,283. (AE I)
Applicant  said  she  had  no  unfiled  state  income  tax  returns.  She  said  the  state
would not allow a taxpayer to begin a tax repayment plan if they had unfiled returns. (Tr.
40) She also acknowledged that her 2022  state tax return  remained unfiled, as  noted,
though she said she owed, and paid $1,545, and that she had paid the $1,430 she owed
for her 2021 state taxes. (Tr. 77-78)
After  the  hearing,  Applicant  provided  several  monthly  installment  bills  from  the
state, dated between October 2022 and April 2023. She was to pay $344.86 a month.
The October  2022 balance owed was $25,795 and as of April 2023, it was $24,580. (AE
U-AE Y)
Applicant testified that she loves her job and her federal contracting career, where
she feels important. She said she has a good moral compass, and considers that she is
trustworthy, has excellent character, and good judgment. (Tr. 17) She has no other debts,
as shown by April 2023 credit reports she submitted. (Tr. 52; AE E, AE F)
Applicant submitted four reference letters from professional colleagues. They all
attested  to  her  professional  skills,  knowledge,  dedication,  honesty,  integrity,  and
trustworthiness,  including  regarding  protection  of  classified  information.  They  also
attested to her strong family life and community participation. (AE L – AE O)
