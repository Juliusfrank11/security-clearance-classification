Applicant is a 67-year-old employee of a government contractor for whom he has
worked since August 2020. He married in 1980 but divorced in 1999. However, he has
lived  with  his ex-wife  as  a  co-habitant  since  2000.  He  has  an  adult  child  and  an  adult
stepchild.  He  earned  an  associate  degree  in  1988  and  has  also  earned  technical
certifications.  He  served  on  active  duty  with  the  Army  from  1975  until  1978  and  on
active duty with the Navy from 1980 until 1988. He earned an honorable discharge from
both branches. (Tr. 26-31, 34; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  has  a  long  and  consistent  history  of  failing  to  abide  by  established
laws,  rules,  and  regulations.  In  April  1975,  he  was  driving  while  intoxicated.  He  was
arrested  and  convicted  of  driving  under  the  influence  of  alcohol  (DUI).  In  November
1985,  he  was  charged  with  resisting  arrest.  A  court  dismissed  this  charge.  Despite
being required to do so, he did not divulge the 1975 DUI arrest on the Questionnaire for
National Security Positions (SF 86) he submitted in July 2020. He did not volunteer the
1975  DUI  arrest  before  the  DOD  investigator  confronted  him  with  it  during  his  August
2020 security interview. (Tr. 30-40; Answer; GE 1-3)
In  July  1986,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  aggravated  assault.  A
court convicted him of the lesser charge of reckless conduct. The court sentenced him
to  six  months  of  probation.  In  December  1987,  he  was  arrested  and  charged  with
aggravated assault and resisting officer-evading arrest. The court convicted him of both
charges and sentenced him to 12 months of probation. Applicant claimed that the July
1986 and December 1987 arrests listed on his FBI criminal history sheet are inaccurate.
He claimed that he was only arrested in July 1986, and that the charges listed from his
1986  and  1987  arrests  stem  from  the  same  incident.  He  claimed  that,  during  the  July
1986 incident, he merely shut the door to his home not realizing that a police officer was
right  behind  him.  He  claimed  that  someone  called  the  police  because  he  and  his  wife
were having an argument. He denied that he was arrested or that he committed a crime
in December 1987. (Tr. 30-34, 40-43; Answer; GE 1-3)
Contrary to Applicant’s claim of not being arrested in December 1987, during his
cross-examination, he acknowledged that arrest. He claimed that he and his brother-in-
law  fought  one  another,  the  police  arrested  him  for  public  intoxication,  and  then  beat
him when he put his watch back on so he could see what time it was. Also, during his
testimony,  he  claimed  that  he  could  not  remember  these  incidents  because  it  was  so
long  ago.  I  find  his  explanations  about  these  arrests  to  be  inconsistent  at  best  and
dishonest at worst. (Tr. 30-34, 40-43; Answer; GE 1-3)
In July 1996, Applicant was involved in a bar fight. He claimed that a person that
he was playing pool with became angry about the outcome of their game and started a
fight. Applicant claimed that he hit his alleged assailant in self-defense. He hit him while
holding a knife in his hand but claimed that he did not stab him. Applicant was arrested
and  charged  with  assault  with  a  deadly  weapon  other  than  a  firearm  and  exhibiting  a
deadly  weapon  other  than  a  firearm.  A  court  found  him  guilty  of  these  charges  and
sentenced him to 180 days in jail and 3 years of probation. (Tr. 43, 45; Answer; GE 1-3)
In  May  2008  Applicant  was  driving  while  intoxicated.  Police  arrested  him  and
charged him with DUI. He pleaded no contest to the charge. The court convicted him of
DUI  and  sentenced  him  to  14 days in  jail.  Despite being  required  to  do so, he did not
divulge  this  arrest  on  his  SF  86.  He  did  not  volunteer  this  arrest  before  the  DOD
investigator confronted him with it during his August 2020 security interview. (Tr. 35-40,
45-46; Answer; GE 1-3)
In September 2014, Applicant was driving while intoxicated. Police arrested him
and charged him with DUI. He claimed that police gave him a breathalyzer test when he
was  arrested, and that  the  result of the test was  a .08 blood alcohol content  (BAC).  A
court  convicted  him  of  DUI,  sentenced  him  to  one  year  in  jail  (part  of  which  was
suspended and part of which he served on work-release), placed him on probation for
two years, and ordered him to perform 96 hours of community service.  The court also
ordered  him  to  install  an  ignition  interlock  device  on  his  vehicle  and  to  take  an  eight-
week  alcohol  education  class.  He  claimed  that  he  took  the  class,  but  he  could  not
remember the title of the class or where it was located. He also claimed that he took a
year  of  court-mandated  alcohol-related  counseling  and  was  subject  to  urinalysis.  He
claimed  that  he  has  not  consumed  any  alcohol  since  he  was  arrested  for  this  DUI.
Despite  being  required  to  do  so,  he  did  not  divulge  this  arrest  on  his  SF  86.  He
volunteered  this  arrest  to  the  DOD  investigator  during  his  August  2020  security
interview before he was confronted. (Tr. 35-40, 46-47, 51-52; Answer; GE 1-3)
In about September 2015, Applicant’s employment was terminated by Company
A  because  of  his  2014  DUI.  He  did  not  divulge  this  termination  on  his  SF  86,  despite
being  required  to  do  so.  Instead,  on  his  SF  86,  he  claimed  that  he  had  retired  from
Company  A.  Applicant  did  not  volunteer  this  termination  before  the  DOD  investigator
confronted him with it during his August 2020 security interview. He claimed that he did
not list this termination due to oversight. He sued Company A for wrongful termination,
lost  his  claim  in  arbitration,  and  then  lost  again  on  appeal  to  a  court  of  competent
jurisdiction. Given his lawsuit acknowledging that he had been terminated, I find that he
was being intentionally untruthful when he claimed on his SF 86 that he had retired from
Company A. (Tr. 35-36, 49-51; GE 1, 2)
In December 2019 and February 2020,  Applicant’s then-employer (Company B)
disciplined  him  for  violations  of  their  workplace  policy.  One  of  these  violations,  which
involved not securing a tool, was alleged to have caused an accident. He also failed to
properly undergo required training. In March 2020, Company B terminated him for these
workplace violations. During his testimony, he claimed he is not sure why he was fired
because Company B did not give him “the paper.”  Despite being required to do so, he
did  not  divulge  this  employment  termination  on  his  SF  86.  He  did  not  volunteer  this
employment  termination  before  the  DOD  investigator  confronted  him  with  it  during  his
August  2020  security  interview.  Instead,  on  his  SF  86,  he  wrote  that  he  left  this
employment  with  Company  B  because  his  contract  ended.  He  also  told  the  DOD
investigator that he failed to list this termination because of oversight. During his cross-
examination,  he  testified  that  he  did  not  list  this  termination  on  his SF  86  because  he
had  also  been  fired  by  two  additional  employers,  and  he  did  not  divulge  those
terminations,  either.  This  makes  no  sense  and  I  find  that  he  was  being  intentionally
untruthful  when  he  claimed  on  his  SF  86  that  he  left  employment  with  Company  B
because his contract ended. (Tr. 47-48; Answer; GE 1, 2)
As a result of this termination, Applicant was required to surrender his site badge
that  allowed  him  access  to  the  airport  where  he  worked  for  Company  B.  Instead  of
surrendering his badge,  in about March 2020, he improperly used it to attempt to gain
entry  to  a  restricted  area  in  the  same  airport  to  attend  a  job  interview  for  another
employer. Airport security denied him entry and attempted to confiscate his site badge,
but  Applicant  refused  to  surrender  it  because  he  thought  he  had  to  surrender  it  to
another individual. During cross-examination, he claimed that he did not realize that his
badge was no longer valid and that he was not aware of the policy that required him to
turn in his site badge once he had been terminated. (Tr. 48-49; Answer; GE 2)
Applicant claimed that he filled out his SF 86 to the best of his ability and that it
took him a week to complete. He also claimed that he contacted his employer’s security
officer for advice on properly completing it. (Tr. 35-38)
In  the  SOR,  the  Government  alleged  Applicant’s  aforementioned  arrests  and
convictions  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.g)  and  his  termination  from  Company  B  for
workplace violations (SOR ¶ 1.h). It also alleged his failure to surrender his invalid site
badge  when  he  was  terminated  by  Company  B,  and  his  use  of  this  invalid  badge  to
attempt  to  access  a  restricted  area  (SOR  ¶  1.i).  It  alleged  his  failures  to  divulge  his
termination  from  Company  B  and  Company  A  on  his  SF  86  (SOR  ¶¶  1.j  and  1.k).
Finally,  it  alleged  his  failure  to  divulge  his  1975,  2008,  and  2014  DUI  arrests  and
convictions on his SF 86 (SOR ¶ 1.l).
