Applicant’s  Answer  to  the  SOR  was  submitted  by  counsel.  In  a  signed
declaration (AE C), Applicant addressed the Guideline E allegations (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.d),
each  with  narrative  explanations.  (Tr.  70-71)  His  answers  do  not  contain  the  phrases
“admit”  or  “deny.”  I  nonetheless  construe  his  answers  as  admissions  to  most  of  the
factual circumstances alleged, but otherwise take his explanations as denials. I construe
his  answer  to  SOR  ¶  1.c  (concerning  falsification)  as  a  denial.  Through  counsel,
Applicant  admitted  the  cross-allegation  at  SOR  ¶  2.a.  Applicant’s  admissions  are
incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings,  the  exhibits,  and  the  hearing  testimony,  I  make  the  following  additional
findings of fact.
Applicant  is  54  years  old.  He  has  a  bachelor’s  degree,  a  master’s  degree,  and
other certifications. He was married from 1992-2014 and he remarried in January 2021.
He  has  three  grown  children.  From  about  1989  until  May  2017,  he  was  employed  by
another  government  agency  (AGA)  in  various  cleared  positions.  He  was  terminated
from  the  AGA  in  May  2017,  and  his  clearance  was  revoked  soon  thereafter,  following
his arrest and guilty plea for the conduct that is largely the subject of this case. He has
been employed in the defense industry, with the same employer, since May 2017, and
he seeks a security clearance through that employment. He does not hold a clearance
currently. (GE 1; AE C; Tr. 29-38; 71-72, 92-98, 133-136) He also works a side job as a
city housing inspector, on a case-by-case basis, after hours. (Tr. 133-135)
In  about  2011,  Applicant  started  a  nonprofit  organization  (NPO),  a  basketball
program  for  about  20  or  30  underprivileged  youths.  Players  were  required  to  perform
community  service  and  keep  up  good  grades.  He  became  close  friends  with  F,  a
woman whose son was in the program, and whom he had known for many years. They
had social contact, but were not dating. She was a city employee. (Tr. 52-53, 64-67, 72-
81; GE 2 at 4)
Applicant’s  friend  F  had  two  mortgages  on  her  home  from  Bank  S.  By  2009,  F
was  behind  on  her mortgage  payments,  and  in  May  2010,  a  notice  of  foreclosure had
been  filed  with  the  city  Recorder of  Deeds.  In  spring  2013,  Bank  S  began  foreclosure
proceedings. (GE 9 at 4; Tr. 109) Through their friendship, Applicant “offered to give her
some advice” about selling her home, based on his own experience with a short sale in
about 2012-13. (Tr. 52-53, 64-67, 72-81)
In October 2013, Applicant allegedly created and then filed fabricated certificates
of satisfaction with the city Recorder of Deeds for the two liens on F’s home. With the
liens apparently satisfied, F would own  her home  “free and clear”  with no  amount due
on  any  outstanding  mortgage.  F  then  put  her  home  up  for  sale.  When  the  house  was
sold, she received 100% of the proceeds from the sale, of about $337,000 –  proceeds
that  should  have  gone  to  Bank  S  to  satisfy  the  outstanding  mortgages.  After  the  sale
was  completed  in  December  2013,  F  split  the  proceeds  with  Applicant,  who  received
about  $170,000  days  later,  apparently  as  a  loan,  rather  than  as  a  gift.  He  quickly
deposited the money into his bank account. (GE 4, GE 9; Tr. 85-86, 109-110)
In  2015,  Applicant  allegedly  made  a  materially  false  statement  on  a  financial
disclosure  form  that  he  submitted  to  his  government  employer,  when  he  failed  to
disclose the $170,000 gift or loan from F as required. (GE 9)
Federal law enforcement authorities opened an investigation into the transaction.
In  March  2016,  Applicant  was  interviewed  as  part  of  their  investigation.  He  denied
preparing  fraudulent  certificates  of  satisfaction,  denied  knowing  what  the  term
“certificates  of  satisfaction”  meant,  and  denied  other  activities  by  which  Bank  S  was
allegedly  defrauded.  (GE  4)  He  denied,  for  instance,  going  to  the  city  Recorder  of
Deeds to file the fraudulent certificates of satisfaction, and he denied that the certificates
contained his handwriting. (Tr. 84, 92, 141-142)
In August 2016, Applicant was indicted by a federal grand jury and charged with
multiple  felony  counts,  including  Conspiracy,  Bank  Fraud,  Wire  Fraud,  Money
Laundering, False Statements, and Uttering a Forged Instrument. He was arrested days
later. (GE 3, GE 4, GE 7) (SOR ¶ 1.a)
In April 2017, on the advice of his counsel, Applicant pleaded guilty to one count
of Bank Fraud (18 USC 1344) and one count of False Statements (18 USC 2001(a)(2)).
The  remaining  counts  were  dismissed.  In  July  2017,  Applicant  was  sentenced  to  a
prison term of one year and one day, followed by two years of supervised release. (GE
4, GE 5, GE 6) A forfeiture money judgment was also issued against him, and he was
ordered to pay restitution of $337,105. (GE 4) (SOR ¶ 1.b)
Applicant was a cleared GS-15 employee of an AGA at the time. He was placed
on administrative leave after he was indicted (August 2016) and in May 2017, following
his  guilty  plea,  he  was  terminated  from  his  job.  He  testified  that  he  tendered  a
resignation, but  was then  terminated days before his resignation was  effective.  (GE 1,
GE 4; Tr. 81, 93-98) (SOR ¶ 1.d)
Applicant  reported  the  charges,  guilty  pleas,  and  sentence  on  his  August  2019
SCA. He also noted that he was still on supervised release (though he hoped for early
termination). (GE 1 at 32-34) He disclosed that he had been terminated from his job at
the AGA, and that his clearance had been revoked as a result. (GE 1 at 16, 37-38)
In the Employment section of his SCA, Applicant indicated that he had worked for
his current employer since May 2017. (GE 1 at 14; Tr. 98-99) In listing his residences,
he disclosed residing at an “FPC” (Federal Prison Camp) in State 1 from August 2017 to
January 2018. (GE 1 at 10; Tr. 57, 99-104)
Applicant testified that when he was questioned by law enforcement authorities,
he said this was the first he had heard about a “certificate of satisfaction.”  He said the
authorities  built  a  case  against  his  friend  (F).  (Tr.  50,  55)  He  said  a  key  part  of  the
evidence against him was an address listed on the certificates. This was an address he
had access to, but he said he had not been there in seven years. That residence was
owned by a friend of his. He denied at hearing that he knew what that address was. (Tr.
56,  84-85,  88-89)  At  his  hearing,  he  denied  creating  or  receiving  phony  certificates  of
satisfaction of the liens and asserted he would have been exonerated at trial. (Tr. 82-85,
138)
Applicant said he did not want to plead guilty and accept the plea agreement, but
only did so with the strong urging of his defense counsel. (AE C) This was confirmed by
a letter from his defense counsel, Mr. B. (AE D-9) Applicant acknowledged that before
pleading guilty, he was provided a copy of the indictment, the Statement of Offense, and
a letter from the U.S. Attorney’s Office detailing the terms of the plea agreement. (GE 7,
GE 8, GE 9; Tr. 139-140) He acknowledged stipulating to the Statement of Offense and
signing  it  under  penalty  of  perjury.  (Tr.  83,  111-112)  GE  8  contains  the  following
statement, under “Defendant’s Acceptance:” “I am pleading guilty because I am, in fact,
guilty  of  the  offenses  identified  in  this  agreement.”  By  his  signature,  he  also  indicated
that  he  had  read  and  understood  the  entire  plea  agreement  and  was  entering  into  it
“voluntarily and of my own free will, intending to be legally bound.” (GE 8 at 12)
At  his  security  clearance  hearing,  Applicant  said,  “I  understand  that,  you  know,
although I, you know, was talked into it, that Statement of Offense that I signed in 2017
will always be the record, the official record. And so, going forward, I will acknowledge
that  as  such.  .  .  .”  (Tr.  43,  47,  139-140)  However,  he  also  asserted  that  he  always
intended to go to trial and expected to be found not guilty. “And, I, to this day, believe in
my innocence.” (Tr. 44, 110-111, 140) He acknowledged pleading guilty to two of the six
counts. (Tr. 50; AE C)
Applicant  also  said  he  accepted  responsibility  and  acknowledged  signing  the
Statement  of  Offense.  (Tr.  91-92)  He  asserted  that  he  was  advised  by  his  attorneys
that, even if he pleaded guilty, he was likely to be able to keep his job with the AGA and
his  clearance.  (Tr.  45)  (The  plea  agreement  letter  does  not  address  this.)  (GE  8)  He
also  asserted  that  he  was  told  that  one  of  the  charges  (money  laundering)  carried  a
mandatory  sentence.  He  was  also  concerned  for  his  family  and  the  things  in  life  for
which he was responsible. In the end, “it took a lot to convince me. I took the plea deal.”
(Tr. 56-57)
Applicant  acknowledged  that  the  Statement  of  Offense,  which  he  signed,
includes an admission that he filed false certificates of satisfaction with the city recorder
of  deeds.  (GE  9  at  4)  It  also  states  that  he  “caused  the  creation”  of  the  two  “phony”
certificates. (GE 9 at 4) He acknowledged that F therefore received proceeds from the
sale  that  should  have  gone  to  Bank  S.  He  acknowledged  that  the  $50,000  loan  he
received from F was part of those proceeds and was part of the $170,000 he received.
He believes he was not credited with paying that $50,000 back to her, so it should not
be part of the restitution. (Tr. 128-131, 138; AE C)
Applicant also acknowledged that he appeared in federal court, with his  counsel,
before the judge who took and accepted his plea, and was questioned extensively about
whether  he  was  pleading  guilty  knowingly  and  voluntarily,  accepting  responsibility  for
what he did, and with an understanding of the possible punitive consequences. (GE 8 at
12)  He  asserted  at  hearing  that  he  believed  he  would  not  get  any  jail  time.  He  also
acknowledged that he did not, at least formally, pursue an attempt to withdraw his guilty
plea. (Tr. 112-118) He asserted that he pled guilty because he was scared, and never
been in trouble before and trusted his attorneys, and “I did what they advised me to do.”
(Tr.  138-139)  The  plea  agreement  letter  noted  an  “Estimated  Guidelines  Range”  for a
sentence of 24 to 30 months in jail. (GE 8 at 3)
Applicant  testified  at  the  security  clearance  hearing  that  he  recognized  that
denying  responsibility  for  the  conduct  yet  also  pleading  guilty  and  admitting  to  the
conduct  in  the  Statement  of  Offense  is  a  “catch-22,”  and  he  does  not  wish  to  appear
deceptive. (Tr. 61, 91, 110-112, 140)
Applicant  was  allowed  to  “self-surrender”  to  begin  his  prison  sentence.  (Tr.  50)
He  testified  that  he  did  not have  to  leave  his  job  as  a  contractor  when  he  reported  to
federal prison. He said he was on administrative leave while he was in prison. (Tr. 51)
(It is unclear what, if anything, Applicant told his employer where he was going).
Applicant’s sentence of one year and one day was reduced due to good behavior
to about four months in jail. He was released in early January 2018. He then resided in
a  “residential reentry  center”  (likely  akin  to  a  “halfway house”) and returned to  work at
his job. He participated in all the required rehabilitative training. (Tr. 58-59, 99-104) His
period of supervised release also ended early, in January 2020. (GE 10; AE E)
Applicant explained that of the $170,000 in proceeds he received from the sale of
F’s  house,  $120,000  went  to  the  NPO  basketball  team.  He  said  the  money  went
primarily  for  travel  expenses,  such  as  hotels  and  airline  tickets.  He  used  $35,000  for
himself (“for what I wanted.”). He said he later received $50,000 from an uncle’s estate
when  his  uncle  died  in  about  2014.  Applicant  said  authorities  also  seized  his  bank
account and kept the funds (about $48,000). (Tr. 53-54, 73, 128-129)
Applicant  asked  F  for  a  $50,000  loan  in  2013,  around  the  time  her  house  was
sold.  He  said  he  used  the  money  to  help  his  children.  He  said  he  repaid  the  loan  in
2014. (Tr. 127-128; GE 2 at 4) He testified that he did not report the matter on his 2015
financial  disclosure  form  because  he  paid  it  off  the  year  before,  and  that  most  of  the
money went towards the basketball program, and not to him. (Tr. 89-90, 131-133) The
Statement of Offense says he deposited the $170,000 into his own bank account. (GE 9
at 5) He acknowledged that it was “probably not”  a good idea to ask F for a loan if he
knew she had credit or financial problems. (Tr. 137-138)
In  October  2019,  Applicant  had  a  background  interview  in  connection  with  his
SCA.  In  SOR  ¶  1.c,  the  Government  alleges  that  Applicant  made  deliberately  false
statements to the investigator when, in discussing his criminal charges, he asserted that
he  did  not  engage  in  the  underlying  criminal  conduct,  despite  having  pled  guilty  and
having  signed  a  “Statement  of  Offense”  in  which  he  acknowledged  various  specific
criminal acts. (GE 2 at 5; GE 9)
Applicant denies the allegation of falsification. He acknowledges “misstatements”
that “did not correspond or correlate with the Statement of Offense” that he had signed
in 2017 on the advice of counsel. (AE C; AE D-10; Tr. 38, 61, 90-91, 121-123) He said,
however, that these “misstatements”  were not “false statements.”  (Tr. 46, 125-126) He
said he did not intend to mislead the government and apologized. (Tr. 40, 46; AE C)
Applicant  also  testified  that  he  consulted  legal  counsel,  Mr.  D,  before  meeting
with  the  interviewing  agent  “because  I  wanted  to  get  guidance  on  .  .  .  how  I  should
approach  the  questions  as  they  pertain  to  the  incident  that  transpired  in  2013”  and  to
“add to the record” on the matter. (Tr. 41-42. 46; AE C)
The  lawyer  Applicant  consulted,  Mr.  D,  met  Applicant  days  before  his  interview
with the investigator. Mr. D wrote, in part:
With [Applicant’s] understanding that the statement his attorneys had him
sign  in  the  2017  plea  agreement  would  always  be  the  official  record,  I
advised  him  to  tell  the  DCSA  investigator  the  truth  as  he  knew  it  and
though  it  would  differ  from  the  official  record,  it  would  serve  as  a
mechanism  to  get  his account  of  the  events  that  transpired  in  the  Fall  of
2013 in the record. In other words, based on our conversations, I believed
that there were details that needed to be shared with the investigator that
may not have been included in the official record. It has always been my
position in this case and in similar cases that it is always best to give full
disclosure and describe any and all events to the best of your knowledge,
information, and belief. (AE D-10)
Applicant did not believe that either he or the interviewing agent (Agent B) had a
copy  of  the  Statement  of  Offense  or  the  Plea  Agreement  Letter  when  he  had  the
interview. He adopted the interview summary as accurate in an interrogatory response,
and only provided an update as to the status of his supervised release. (GE 2 at 8-9; Tr.
126-127)
GE  4  indicates  that  Applicant  has  been  ordered  to  pay  about  $337,000  in
restitution. He testified that he and F are jointly and severally liable for the full amount,
but  then  said  he  is  responsible  only  for  the  $170,000  he  received.  He  is  still  trying  to
settle  what  he  owes  in  restitution  but  is  also  making  $150  payments  regularly  on  a
monthly basis and is current, as of March 1, 2023. Court documentation reflects that he
is jointly and severally liable for the full amount ($337,105). Almost $105,000 has been
collected since  2017, with  about $232,000 outstanding. Several line items are blacked
out, so they may relate to payments by F (though this is unclear). (Tr. 55, 105-108; AE
F, AE G)
Applicant volunteers in the community as a coach at a local high school working
with at-risk youth. (Tr. 60; AE D-4, AE D-5, AE D-7, AE D-8) He is no longer involved
with  the  NPO’s  basketball  program  and  has  not  been  involved  since  he  was  indicted.
(Tr. 77-78)
Applicant  has  had  no  other  arrests  or  offenses.  He  had  no  security  violations
when he held a clearance. (Tr. 43, 63, 119) He said, “I’ve never been in trouble before, I
don’t  plan  on  being  in  trouble  again.”  (Tr.  43)  He  cannot  be  blackmailed  due  to  his
conduct. (Tr. 48) He is trying to get back on track. He wants to regain his clearance to
support national security. He has experience and expertise in his professional field and
wants to contribute. He considers this work to be his life. (Tr. 68-69)
Applicant  provided  several  letters  from  professional  and  personal  character
references,  all  of  which  I  have  reviewed.  (AE  D-1  –  AE  D-8)  The  professional
references, all of them holding clearances, include the CEO of Applicant’s employer (AE
D-1),  another  director  for  the  company  (AE  D-3),  a  former  supervisor  at  another
government agency (AE D-2), three other employees at the AGA (AE D-4, AE D-5, AE
D-6), and a government employee in another federal government department (AE D-7).
All  of  these  references  have  known  and  worked  with  Applicant  for many  years,
and  attest  to  his  professional  and  technical  skill  and  expertise  in  his  professional
community,  as  well  as  to  his  judgment,  trustworthiness,  reliability,  honesty,  integrity,
decision-making,  and work  ethic, among  other qualities.  Applicant is  also  highly  active
as a volunteer in the community, proving a role as a mentor to under-privileged youths,
as  previously  noted.  (AE  D-5,  AE  D-8)  All  of  the  references  attest  that  Applicant  is  a
suitable candidate for renewed access to classified information.
