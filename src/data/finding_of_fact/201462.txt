In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.g,
2.a-2.c, 3.a, and 3.b. Although he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.g, 3.a, and 3.b,
his explanations for those allegations amount to denials, and I have treated them as such.
He denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.f and 2.d. His admissions are incorporated in
my findings of fact.
Applicant is a high school graduate. He has never married and has no children. He
is a 26-year-old electrician employed by defense contractors since November 2016. He
has worked for his current employer since March 2021. (Tr. 14) He has held a security
clearance since 2014. (Tr. 15) His SCA reflects a period of unemployment, but he testified
that it is incorrect and that he has been continuously employed since November 2016.
(Tr. 24-25)
Applicant  served  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  Army  from  December  2014  to  April
2016. He testified that he purchased and used marijuana  with a girlfriend  two or three
times a week while he was on active duty, and he sometimes used it more than once a
day.  (Tr.  28-29)  In  October  2015,  he  underwent  a  urinalysis  that  tested  positive  for
marijuana.  He  received  nonjudicial  punishment  consisting  of  reduction  in  rank  from
private first class to the lowest enlisted rank and extra duty for 60 days. He was required
to attend a drug and alcohol abuse program. In April 2016, he was discharged before he
completed his enlistment. He received a general discharge under honorable conditions.
He no longer has contact with the woman with whom he used marijuana while on active
duty. (GX 1 at 24; GX 8 at 10)
In September 2017, Applicant was arrested for possession of marijuana. He was
convicted and sentenced to 30 days in jail,  suspended for 30 days. He was  placed on
unsupervised  probation  for  one  year,  fined  $250  plus  court  costs,  and  required  to
complete  an  alcohol  and  substance  abuse  program  (ASAP).  His  driver’s  license  was
suspended for six months. (GX 4)
In  October 2018,  while  Applicant  was  working  for  his  current  employer,  he  was
arrested  for  felony  possession  of  marijuana  with  intent  to  distribute.  The  charge  was
amended to misdemeanor possession of marijuana. He was convicted and sentenced to
30 days in jail, suspended for 30 days. He was placed on unsupervised probation for two
years.  He  was  fined  $250  and  court  costs.  His  driver’s  license  was  suspended  for  six
months. (GX 5; GX 6)
In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted that he used marijuana “on and off”
from 2015 to 2019. He refers to his years of marijuana use as a “dark time.” He testified
that he last used marijuana in 2020. (Tr. 40) He continues to have bi-weekly contact with
a friend with whom he used marijuana after his discharge from the Army. (GX 8 at 10)
When Applicant submitted his SCA in April 2021, he answered “Yes” to a question
asking  if,  in  the  last  seven  years,  he  had  been  arrested  by  any  police  officer,  sheriff,
marshal or any other type of law enforcement official; charged, convicted, or sentenced
for a crime in any court; or if he currently was or had been on probation or parole. He
disclosed his arrest in September 2017 for simple possession of marijuana, but he did not
disclose his arrest  in October 2018  for felony possession of marijuana, and he did not
disclose  that  he  had  been  placed  on  probation  twice  for  his  two  marijuana-related
convictions. (GX 1 at 34-36) When Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator
in  September  2021  and  asked  similar  questions  about  his  arrests,  convictions,  or
probation, he disclosed the September 2017 arrest and several traffic citations, but he did
not disclose his October 2018 arrest, conviction, and probation. (GX 8 at 8-9) He testified
that he did not fully disclose his drug involvement in his SCA because he forgot about it.
He testified that he was in a “bad place” and that he tries not to think about it. (Tr. 33)
Credit  reports  from  July  2021  and  July  2022  reflect  that  Applicant  has  eight
delinquent debts. He enlisted in the Army at age 17, immediately after graduating from
high  school.  He  attributed  his  delinquent  debts  to  his  financial  inexperience  and  not
understanding  money  management.  (Tr.  27)  The  evidence  concerning  these  debts  is
summarized below.
SOR ¶ 1.a: consumer debt charged off for $4,409. The July 2022 credit report
reflects that Applicant previously had two loans from this creditor that were paid, and the
most  recent  payment  on  the  debt  alleged  in  the  SOR  was  in  April  2022.  (GX  3  at  4)
Applicant submitted a statement claiming that he is making monthly $100 payments by
phone. (AX B) He submitted no documentation to support his claim.
SOR ¶ 1.b: personal loan from credit union charged off for $3,824. Applicant

$1,006 in January 2023, after he received the SOR. (AX G)
SOR ¶ 1.e: medical bill placed for collection of $718. Applicant testified that he
was hospitalized and thought that he was covered by his mother’s health insurance. (Tr.

he has been unable to obtain a receipt from the collection agency. (AX B) The debt was
placed for collection in July 2021, but it is not listed in the July 2022 credit report. (GX 2
at 3; GX 3)
SOR  ¶  1.f:  telecommunications  debt  placed  for  collection  of  $350.  After
Applicant was interviewed by an investigator, he made monthly payments until the debt
was paid in May 2022. (Tr. 51; AX D)
SOR ¶ 1.g: car loan charged off for $9,701. Applicant claims that this debt was
for a “lemon” car that he bought when he was on active duty. He does not intend to pay

(AX B at 2) He submitted no documentary evidence of efforts to resolve this debt.
SOR ¶ 1.h: car loan from credit union charged off for $6,959. Applicant failed
to make the payments on his car loan, and the car was repossessed. He made a payment
agreement in March 2022, after his security interview but before he received the SOR. It
provides for monthly $100 payments. He has paid $2,853 and owes a balance of $5,559.
(AX E)
Applicant’s current take-home pay is about $3,000 per month when he works in
the United States and about $5,000 to $7,000 per month when he is overseas, depending
on the country. He has a10% disability rating from his Army service and he receives about
$150 per month in disability pay. (Tr. 18-19) He testified that he has about $1,000 left
after paying all his bill, and he invests it in stocks, bonds, and crypto currency. At the time
of the hearing, he had about $8,000 in stocks and bonds and $500 to $1,000 in crypto
currency.  (Tr.  58-59) He  has  a  financial  advisor  for  his  investments,  but  he  has  never
obtained financial counseling about resolving his delinquent debts. (Tr. 60)
The president of the company for whom Applicant works has held clearances for
19 years and known Applicant for two years. He states that Applicant “has demonstrated
on  multiple  projects  that  he  is  a  reliable,  hardworking,  and  honest  person  with  high
integrity and good character.” (AX A)
