Applicant  is  a  68-year-old  registered  nurse  and  clinic  manager  employed  by  a
federal contractor since September 2019. She served in the Navy from March 1987 to
September 2007, was honorably discharged and retired as an E-7. She honorably served
in the Army Reserve, National Guard, and Navy Reserve prior to commencing active duty
in  the  Navy. She held a  security  clearance while  on  active duty  in the  Navy.  She  was
employed in various nursing positions from December 2007 to September 2017, except

2017, and October 2017 to August 2019. (GE 1, GE 2; AE G, H; Tr. 33-44)
Applicant earned associate and bachelor’s degrees in nursing in 1997 and 2015,

The  SOR  alleges  a  failure  to timely file federal income tax returns for tax  years
2012 through 2019 (SOR ¶ 1.a); a federal tax debt of $4,267 for tax year 2012 (SOR ¶
1.b), and nine delinquent credit accounts totaling $10,262. (SOR ¶¶ 1.c through 1.k). In
Applicant's answer to the SOR (SOR Response), she admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.b to 1.k with
explanation and, admitted in part and denied in part SOR ¶ 1.a with explanation.
Applicant  attributes  her failure  to  timely file federal tax  returns  and  other financial
problems to  unstable employment,  unemployment, depression, medical issues,  custody
issues regarding  her nephews, and  forgetfulness. (GE  2  at  42, GE  3  at 6-7; Tr.  27-28, 41-
42, 47, 54-55)  She  noted  that from  October 2017  to  August 2019  she  was unemployed
because   she   had   to   care  for  her  terminally  ill  husband,  that  he   and   two   other  family
members  died   during   that   timeframe,   and   that   she   experienced   medical  issues  that
prevented   her  from   returning   to   work.  (Tr.  27-28,  41-42)  She   said  that  her  former
husband’s  abuse   prior  to   his  illness  caused   her  emotional   instability,  that  his  death   in
November  2017   resolved   “the   issue   causing   [her]  depression,”   and   that  in  2018   she
decided to get her finances in  order.  (SOR Response; GE 3 at 6-7; Tr. 54-55)
The evidence concerning the specific SOR allegations is summarized below.
SOR ¶ 1.a: failure to timely file federal income tax returns for tax years 2012
through 2019. Applicant admitted that she failed to timely file federal income tax returns
for tax years 2012 through 2017 but said that she had filed returns for tax years 2017 to
2019  and  was  working  with  a  tax-resolution  service  to  file  delinquent  returns.  (SOR
Response) She submitted federal income tax account transcripts reflecting that she had
timely filed a return for tax year 2018, but had not timely filed returns for tax years 2012,
2014 through 2017, and 2019. (GE 3 at 32-40) The IRS prepared substitute returns for
tax years 2012 and 2014, and Applicant’s subsequent claims resulted in adjustments to
her account for both tax years in 2021. (GE 3 at 32-35). She filed returns for tax years
2015 through 2017 in 2021 and filed a return for tax year 2019 on October 26, 2020, 11
days after a six-month extension to file expired. (GE 3 at 36-41) She testified that she
filed a federal income tax return for tax year 2013 but could not locate a copy of the return
and  had  not  received  an  account  transcript  from  the  IRS.  (Tr.  44-45)  Her  tax  account
transcript  reflected  that  she  had  not  filed  a  return  for  tax  year 2020  as  of  October  26,
2021, 11 days after her six-month filing extension expired. (GE 3 at 41)
SOR ¶ 1.b: delinquent federal income tax debt of $4,267 for tax  year 2012.
Applicant admitted the tax debt and entered into a payment agreement with the IRS  in
September 2021. (SOR Response; GE 3 at 11, 13-25, 32-33) She testified that she had
paid off the debt in mid-2022. (Tr. 27) She provided evidence of payments on the tax debt
totaling $1,713 after she entered into the payment agreement. She submitted evidence
that she made payments from October 2021 to June 2021 totaling $1,631. (GE 3 at 33;
AE  D  at  2-3)  She  also  provided  evidence  that  $82  was  applied  to  the  debt  from  an
overpayment for tax year 2016 in June 2022. (AE D at 1)
SOR  ¶   1.c:  auto  loan  past  due  for  $2,104   with  balance   of   $24,648   for
repossessed vehicle.  Applicant  admitted  the  allegation, noting  that  the  vehicle  was sold
after being  repossessed  and  noted  that the  delinquency  was not reflected  in  a  December
2021  credit  report. (SOR Response)  September 2019  and  April 2020  credit reports  show
the  auto  loan  account was opened  in June  2017   with  the  last  account activity in 2018,
and  as  an   involuntary repossession   with   a   past-due amount   of  $2,104   and   balance  of
$24,648.  (GE 5  at  3, GE  6  at 1) Applicant  testified  that she  contacted  the  creditor in 2017
because she  could not  afford to  pay the loan  due  to  her husband’s funeral  costs. (Tr. 27-
28,  58-59)   She   said   that  she   settled   the   debt  for  approximately  $2,104   after  the
repossessed   vehicle   was   sold  and   would   look  for  documentation.  (Tr.  60)  She
subsequently reported  that  she  had  not  received  documentary  evidence  of payment from
the  creditor. (AE A, AE F)
SOR  ¶  1.d:  credit  collection  account  for  $1,178.  Applicant  admitted  the
allegation, stated that she was making payments to a collection agency and that the debt
would  be  resolved  in January  2022.  (SOR  Response  at  2)  An  April  2020  credit  report
shows the loan account was opened or placed for collection in September 2019 with a
balance of $1,178. (GE 6 at 2) She submitted evidence that she made a $294 payment
in December 2021. (SOR Response at Enclosure 2, page 29; Enclosure 3) She testified
that  she  made  four  payments,  paid  the  account  in  full,  and  would  check  her  bank
statements.  (Tr.  60-62)  She  subsequently  reported  that  the  creditor  had  not  provided
documentary evidence of payment. (AE A, AE F)
SOR  ¶   1.e:  collection  account   for  $1,011.   Applicant  admitted   the   allegation,
noting  that the  account had  been  resolved  and   was not reflected  in  a  December 2021
credit report. (SOR Response) An  April 2020  credit report shows the  collection  account
was opened  or  placed for collection  in  February 2020  with a balance  of  $1,011.  (GE  6  at
2)   Applicant  reported   that  she   contacted   and   identified  a   creditor’s  representative   who
confirmed   the   account   had   no   outstanding   balance   on   March  3,  2023,  and   said  the
representative  declined  to  forward a  letter in  confirmation. (AE  A) I  resolve this debt in
Applicant’s favor because  her  report  that  an  identified  creditor’s representative  confirmed
the   debt  had   been   resolved   is  corroborated,   in  part,   by  recent  credit  reports.  (SOR
Response at Enclosure 2; GE  7-8) This debt is resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.f: credit account charged off for $684. Applicant admitted the allegation
and submitted evidence the debt was resolved. (SOR Response at Enclosure 2, page 24;
AE B) This debt is resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.g: collection account for $618. Applicant admitted the allegation and
submitted evidence the debt was resolved in May 2020. (SOR Response at 2; AE C) This
debt is resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.h:  credit  account  charged  off  for  $361.  Applicant  admitted  the
allegation  and  submitted  evidence  the  account  was  charged  off  in  August  2019  and
settled in March 2020. (SOR Response at Enclosure 2, page 22; GE 8 at 10) This debt is
resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.i: credit collection account for $714. Applicant admitted the allegation
and  submitted  evidence  the  account  was  charged  off  in  April  2018,  and  paid  in  full  in

December 2021 credit report. (SOR Response at 2, Enclosure 2)
SOR ¶ 1.k: collection account for $483. Applicant admitted the allegation, noting
that  the  account  had  been  resolved  and  was  not  reflected  in  a  December  2021  credit
report. (SOR Response at 2, Enclosure 2) She subsequently reported that the creditor
had not provided documentary evidence of payment. (AE A, AE F)
Applicant held a security clearance while in the Navy and has handled sensitive
personal  information  for  more  than  46  years  without  reported  incident.  (Tr.  28)  She
received multiple personal awards and other commendations during her military service
and favorable civilian employee evaluations and been rated “excellent.” (AE G-I) She was

3 at 44, 46)
Any  derogatory  information  not  alleged  in  the  SOR  will  not  be  considered  for
disqualifying  purposes;  however,  it  may  be  considered  in  the  application  of  mitigating
conditions and in a whole-person analysis.
