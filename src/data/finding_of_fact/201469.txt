Applicant is a 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his  current  employer  since  December  2019.  He  served  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.
military from 1999 until he was honorably discharged in 2006. He earned an associate
degree  in  2016.  He  also  had  technical  certifications.  He  married  in  2018.  He  has  two
young children and a stepchild. (Tr. at 25, 28-29, 45-46; Applicant’s response to SOR;
GE 1)
Applicant’s  car  broke  down  several  times  in  2014.  He  paid  about  $9,000  in
repairs.  In about  2015,  he started  working  part-time  in  real estate, and  he  got  into the
business  of  “flipping”  houses.  The  business  was  ultimately  unsuccessful,  and  he  had
debts  that  he  could  not  pay.  He  reported  on  his  Questionnaire  for  National  Security
Positions in February 2020 that he traveled to a foreign country for tourism in 2018 for
somewhere between 11 and 20 days. (Tr. at 20, 27-28, 39-43; GE 1)
The  SOR  alleges  11  delinquent  debts  totaling  about  $32,245.  The  debts  are
listed  on  a  November  2019  credit  report,  an  April  2022  credit  report,  or  both  credit
reports. Most of the debts were opened from 2015 through 2018, with the last payments
received in 2017 through 2019. (GE 3, 4)
SOR  ¶  1.b  alleges  a  $180  debt  to  a  credit  union.  The  account  was  opened  in
April 2017, and it became delinquent in December 2017. Applicant paid it in full in May
2022. (Tr. at 21-22, 30; GE 3, 4; AE A)
SOR  ¶ 1.c alleges a $3,126  charged-off auto  loan.  The account was  opened  in
August  2015,  and  it  became  delinquent  in  May  2017.  The  creditor  agreed  to  accept
$2,345  through  three  payments  of  $391  between  July  2022  and  November  2022  in
settlement of the debt. Applicant paid the full settlement amount early, and the creditor
released the lien on the vehicle. (Tr. at 22-23, 30; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3,
4; AE B, C)
Applicant  denied  owing  the  $90  debt  to  a  bank,  as  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.d.  The
debt is reported on the 2019 and 2022 credit reports. He stated that he called the bank,
but the customer service representative told him that they did not have the debt in their
collections department. He stated that he would have paid the debt if he knew who held
the debt. (Tr. at 30-32; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3, 4)
Applicant  denied  owing  the  $287  debt  to  a  collection  company  on  behalf  of  a
cable services provider (SOR ¶ 1.j). The debt was reported by all three credit reporting
agencies  on  the  November  2019  combined  credit  report,  with  an  activity  date  of
September 2017. It is not listed on the April 2022 Equifax credit report. He stated in his
response  to  the  SOR  that  the  debt  was  returned  to  the  original  company,  and  he
planned to pay it on June 21, 2022. He testified that he called the collection company on
June  14,  2022,  but  the  company  could  not  locate  the  debt.  (Tr.  at  36-37;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 3, 4; AE B, C)
The November 2019 credit report listed a $364 charged-off debt to a credit union
(SOR ¶ 1.k). Applicant provided documentation from the credit union indicating that the
account was closed as of July 2019 in good standing with no remaining balances. (Tr. at
37; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3, 4; AE H, I)
Applicant  admitted  owing  the  remaining  SOR  debts  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.e-1.i).
Those  six debts  total about  $28,000  and  are  all  reported  on  both  the  November  2019
and  April  2022  credit  reports.  He  testified  that  he  contacted  several  of  the  creditors
about resolving the debts, and he planned to pay the debts. (Tr. at 24, 29-30, 32-36, 45;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3, 4)
In  a  post-hearing  email  on  March  13,  2023,  Applicant  indicated  that  he  “was
looking over [his] debts lately and noticed that [he  had] only two left so far to pay off.”
Based on his later email of May 8, 2023, it appears that the two debts he was referring
to  were  the  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  ($3,315)  and  1.h  ($11,119).  He  provided  no
evidence  that  he  paid  the  other  four  debts.  He  provided  a  copy  of  a  recent  combined
credit report that does not list any of the SOR debts, but the report is incomplete. The
report apparently had 69 pages, but he only provided pages 32 to 66. (AE G, H)
Applicant submitted letters attesting to his excellent job performance and strong
moral  character.  He  is praised  for  his  work ethic,  positive  attitude,  and  integrity.  He  is
described as an “exemplary employee.” (AE D, E)
