The SOR identified twenty allegations consisting of delinquent debts totaling over
$60,000, which includes credit card debt owed to a number of institutions for consumer
debt.  Applicant admits each of the allegations with explanations.  Credit reports of the
Applicant dated May 2, 2020; February 24, 2022; and December 14, 2022, confirm that
he  is  indebted  to  each  of  the  creditors  listed  in  the  SOR.  (Government  Exhibits  4,  5,
and 6.)
Applicant  was  married  from  2015  to  2020.  At  some  point,  he  and  his  wife
separated,  and  then  divorced.  Divorced  proceedings  which  went  on  for  an  extended
period,  followed  by  a  child  custody  battle.  This  was  costly.  His  attorney  fees  and
related  costs  totaled  about  $8,000.  Applicant  used  credit  cards  to  pay  for  living
expenses and household items, such as furniture, and appliances.  Applicant ultimately
obtained custody of his three children.  (Tr. p. 20.)
Applicant  had  stable  full-time  employment  from  2012  to  2018.  (Tr.  p.  20.)  He
was  unemployed  from  September  2018  to  early  January  2019,  and  July  2019  to
September 2019, for a total of about  six or seven months.  (Tr. pp. 19-20.)  He stated
that  he  had  to  borrow  money  from  his  mother  to  help  with  his  living  expenses.  He
explained that was barely able to keep the expense of the house, the children, and their
childcare going.  He could not afford to pay his debts, and he stopped making payments
on  his credit  card debt  in  2018  or early  2019.  He had no expendable  money.  (Tr. p.
29.)  Since 2018 or early 2019, no payments have been made towards the credit card
debt listed in the SOR.
Applicant began working for his current employer in June 2020.  He understood
at the time that his job may require a security clearance.  He was hired as a Machinist,
and was recently promoted to be an Inspector.  Applicant earns about $94,000 annually.
He  has  about  $2,500  in  his  checking  account,  and  nothing  in  his  savings.  He  has  a
401(k) with about $7,000 and a pension that is not effective until he retires.  (Tr. pp. 33
and 34.)
Applicant  initially  testified  that  he  was  in  the  process  of  filing  Bankruptcy  to
discharge  the  debts  listed  in  the  SOR.  However,  he  was  advised  by  his  Bankruptcy
attorney  to  wait  until  after  the  hearing  to  determine  if  it  is  necessary,  since  all  of  his
delinquent debts will fall off of his credit report in 2025, because  they are  so old.  (Tr.
pp. 22 and 34.)  This will allow the Applicant  to  quickly rebuild his credit standing and
possibly be able to purchase a house.  Since September 2020, when he gained full-time
employment,  Applicant  has  not  made  any  payments  towards  resolving  his  delinquent
debts, nor has he contacted his creditors to set up payment arrangements.

Applicant testified that he also learned that if he contacts the creditor to set up a
payment  plan,  the  creditor  can  then  legally  come  after  him  for  payment  through  the
court  system.  Since  he  has  had  no  contact  with  the  creditors  for  four  years,  at  this
point, the Statute of Limitation has run, and the debts are over four years old, Applicant
understands that the creditor has no recourse against him for payment.  (Tr. p. 25-26.)
Applicant further testified that in 2021, during his security clearance background
investigation, the DoD investigator told him that he should file for Bankruptcy because it
would  look  better  to  the  Government  to  have  the  debt  gone  than  to  have  it  sitting
delinquent  on  his  credit  report.  Applicant  stated  that  he  chose  not  to  follow  his
suggestion because it would extend his period of bad credit and take longer for him to
rebuild it.  (Tr. pp. 39 â€“ 40.)
