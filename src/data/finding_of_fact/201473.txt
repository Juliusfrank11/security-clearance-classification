Applicant is 62 years old and he resides with his partner.  He has a Master’s in
Business Administration.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Senior Facilities
Planner.  He  is  seeking  to  obtain  a  security  clearance  in  connection  with  his
employment.
The SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted to five creditors involving credit card
debt  totaling  approximately  $28,434.
In  his  Answer,  Applicant  admits  each  of  the
allegations and provides explanations.  A credit report of the Applicant dated December
20,  2022,  reflects  that  each  of  these  debts  were  at  one-time  owing.
(Government
Exhibit 3.)
Applicant  began  working  for  his  current  employer  in  September  2021.  Prior  to
2014, Applicant was committed to his financial obligations, never overextended himself
financially, and he paid his bills on time.
Beginning  in  2014,  and  continuing  off  and  on  until  at  least  2021,  Applicant
encountered  extraordinary  life  events  that  hindered  his  ability  to  meet  his  financial
obligations.  To  sum  up  his  situation,  he  experienced  a  number  of  serious  medical
issues  that  prevented  him  from  working  and  caused  additional  financial  indebtedness.
As a result, he was unable to pay his debts.
In August 2014, Applicant suffered from his third hernia injury, a bilateral hernia
causing  him  to  be  out  of  work  for  nearly  six  months  due  to  the  healing  process.
In
February  2015,  he  suffered  complications  from  his  surgery  forcing  him  to  be
hospitalized for five days, which was diagnosed as an intestinal obstruction.  This time
he  was  off  work,  and  without  medical  insurance,  which  led  him  to  apply  for  state
assistance.  He was released from the hospital but was not given an explanation for his
condition.  He still needed medical treatment.  (Applicant’s Exhibits 3A, 3B, 3C, and 4.)
In  May  2015,  Applicant  experienced  another  intestinal  obstruction  complication
and  was  in  the  hospital  emergency  room  for  12  hours  and  still  the  doctors  were
uncertain  as  to  why  he  was  experiencing  the  condition.  From  May  to  June  2015,
Applicant saw three surgeons who tried to determine the cause and prevention of these
intestinal obstructions.  Applicant underwent a number of tests and scans and two of the
three surgeons were unable to find a cause for his condition.  Applicant was still unable
to work.  He felt ill all of the time, he could not eat properly, and he lost 55 pounds.  He
depleted his savings  account to pay  for some  of his  financial  obligations.  (Applicant’s
Exhibits 5, 6, 7A, 7B, 8 and 9.)
In July 2015, a third surgeon indicated that emergency surgery was imminent to
repair what he believed was a new hernia.  During the surgery he discovered that the
original hernia was done incorrectly, the mesh had come loose and was strangling the
small  intestine.  For about  six  months  following  surgery,  Applicant underwent  physical
therapy, received multiple injections for pain, and managed his PTSD from the traumatic
event.  (Applicant’s Exhibits 10, 11, and 12.)
From 2016 to 2018, Applicant went back to work but still faced residual pain and
suffered  from  PTSD.  He  was  unable  to  recover  financially,  but  managed  to  live
paycheck to paycheck and paid all of his monthly expenses with minimum payments.
In November 2017, Applicant was laid-off of his job due to company downsizing
and he moved back in with his family who lived out of state.  His partner was also laid
off from her job.  By moving back in with his family, Applicant was able to help take care
of his mother who had breast cancer and went through surgery.  She also fell and broke
her  hip.  About  this  same  time,  Applicant’s  partner’s  mother  was  going  in  for  double
knee surgery.  (Tr. p. 55.)  At this point, Applicant was soley living on his credit cards.
Money  was scarce and  Applicant used  it  to buy  food, gas, car insurance, utilities, and
other necessary living expenses.  The debts listed in the SOR were last paid in 2017 or
early  2018.  (Tr.  p.  53.)  Applicant  could  not  afford  to  make  payments  towards  these
debts.  (Applicant’s Exhibits 16 and 17.)
In  2019,  Applicant  moved  back  to  California  after  securing  employment.  He
stated that he had planned to start addressing his debts when COVID hit.  As a result,
he lost his job, and his partner lost her job.  From September 2020 to September 2021,
Applicant was unemployed.  (Applicant’s Exhibits 18A, 18B, and 19.)
In  September  2021,  post-COVID,  Applicant  was  able  to  secure  a  job  with  his
current employer.  He stated that he is now finally getting re-established and has every
