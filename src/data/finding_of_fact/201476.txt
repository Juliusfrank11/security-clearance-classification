In  Applicant's  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  to  all  of  the  allegations.  His
admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 33-year-old engineer for a defense contractor. He has worked for
the defense contractor since May 2016. He is not married and has no children. He earned
his bachelor's degree in 2013. He was granted a secret clearance in July 2017.
March 2014 and July 2015 violations of company’s substance abuse policy.
(Guideline E - SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b). Applicant admitted in his Answer to testing positive
on company drug tests for marijuana in March 2014 and July 2015. After the positive 2014
test he completed a drug treatment program. During a random 2015 urinalysis he tested
positive again for marijuana and was terminated. He cited succumbing to peer pressure
for why he used marijuana again in 2015. (Item 5 at 6, 9.)
From  June  2006  until  May  2022,  used  marijuana  with  varying  frequency
(Guideline  H  - SOR  ¶  2.a).  Applicant  listed  in  response  to  interrogatories  that  he  first
used marijuana in June 2006, and he estimated he stopped using it either in April or May
of  2022.  Between  June  2006  and  February 2014,  he  used  it  on  a  weekly basis.  From
February 2014 until his termination in July 2015 he used marijuana  “very sporadically.”
From  July  2015  until  January  2016,  he  used  it  “weekly  to  a  few  times  a  week.”  From
January 2016 until April 2022, he used marijuana  “a few times sporadically.” (Item 5 at
6.)
From  July  2017  until  May  2022,  used  marijuana  with  vary  frequency  while
granted  access  to  classified  information  (Guideline  H  - SOR  ¶  2.b).  Applicant
admitted  he  had  a  “lapse  in  judgment’  when  he  “returned  to  behavior”  that  was  “not
acceptable while having a security clearance.” He stated he let “stressors get to [him].”
(Item  5  at  6.)  On  his  2021  SCA  he  disclosed  he  used  marijuana  occasionally  from
December 2018 until January 2019. (Item 3 at 36.) In response to interrogatories, he said
he used marijuana “a few times sporadically” from January 2016 until April 2022, (Item 5
at 6.)
January 2019 arrest for possession of marijuana. (Guideline J - SOR ¶ 3.a).
Applicant admitted to being arrested for possession of marijuana. He was pulled over for
failing to stop at a posted stop sign. The officer smelled marijuana and questioned him.
He admitted to marijuana possession and showed the officer where it was in his car. He
was  arrested  and  charged  with  “Possession  of  Marijuana  less  than  2  oz.”  He  has  not
heard anything further regarding the charge. (Item 5 at 14.)
Applicant  did  not  respond  to  the  FORM,  so  he  did  not  provide  any  updated
evidence to be considered in mitigation. He stated in his SCA that he does not intend to
continue using marijuana because he wants to retain his security clearance. (Item 3 at
36.) He added in his interrogatory response he had “no intentions of future use.” (Item 5
at  6.)  He  provided  no  character  evidence  for  consideration  under  the  whole-person
concept.
