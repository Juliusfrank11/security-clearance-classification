Applicant  is  a  31-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor  for  whom  he  has
worked  since  April  2022.  He  earned  a  high  school  diploma  in  2010.  He  took  some
college courses between 2010 and 2012 but did not earn an undergraduate degree. He
has never been married. He has a five-year-old child. (Item 3)
Applicant had four delinquent debts totaling approximately $32,000. In the SOR,
the  Government  alleged  these  delinquent  debts.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.d)  These
delinquencies consist of a vehicle loan (SOR ¶ 1.a), credit cards (SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c),
and  a  medical  bill  (SOR  ¶  1.d).  He  admitted  these  allegations.  His  admissions  are
adopted  as  findings  of  fact.  Those  SOR  allegations  are  established  through  his
admissions and the Government’s credit reports. (Items 2-6)
Despite being required to do so,  Applicant failed to divulge the delinquent debts
identified  as  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.d  on  his  May  2022  Electronic  Questionnaires  for
Investigations Processing  (e-QIP). He  did disclose  the  delinquent credit  cards  listed  in
SOR  ¶¶  1.b  and  1.c.  During  his  June  2022  security  interview,  he  told  the  DOD
investigator that  he  intentionally  did  not  list  these debts  on his e-QIP  because he  was
“embarrassed.”  There  is  no  evidence  that  he  volunteered  these  delinquencies  before
the DOD investigator confronted him with them. The Government alleged his deliberate
failure  to  list  these  delinquent  debts  in  SOR  ¶  2.a.  In  his  response  to  the  SOR,  he
admitted this allegation. His admission is adopted as a finding of fact. (Items 1-6)
The  delinquent  vehicle  loan  in  the  amount  of  $14,356  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.a  is
being resolved. Applicant co-signed on this loan in July 2018, to help a work colleague
purchase  a  vehicle.  The  work  colleague  failed  to  make  the  required  payments  on  the
car and defaulted on the account in October 2020. Applicant tried to make payments on
the account, but he could not regularly afford to do so. Prior to the Government issuing
the SOR, the last payment on this account was in November 2019. On March 28, 2023,
he made a $300 payment that he corroborated with a receipt he submitted. He claimed
that he has a monthly payment arrangement with the creditor to satisfy this debt. (Items
1, 2, 4-6; FORM Response)
The delinquent credit cards in the amounts of $9,480 and $8,702, alleged in SOR
¶¶ 1.b and 1.c, respectively, are being resolved. Applicant opened the account listed in
SOR ¶ 1.b in March 2013. The date of last activity on this account prior to the SOR was
January  2019.  On  March  24,  2023,  he  made  a  payment  of  $50  on  this  account.  On
March 26, 2023, he made a payment arrangement with the creditor to pay 72  monthly
payments of $130.97 beginning in April 2023. He opened the credit card in SOR ¶ 1.c in
September  2014.  The  date  of  last  activity  on  this  account  prior  to  the  SOR  was
December  2018.  On  March  24,  2023,  he  made  a  payment  of  about  $217  on  this
account. On March 26, 2023, he made a payment arrangement with the creditor to pay
40 monthly payments of about $217. The March 2023 payment represented the first of
his 40  payments.  He provided  documentary  evidence  to  corroborate  his payments and
payment  arrangement on both these accounts.  (Items  1-6; FORM Response)
The  medical  account  in  the  amount  of  $172  listed  in  SOR  ¶  1.d  has  been
resolved.  Applicant  became  delinquent  on  this  account  in  April  2018.  He  provided
documentary corroboration that he paid this account on March 24, 2023. (Items 1, 2, 4-
6; FORM Response)
Applicant  claimed  that  he  began  having  financial  difficulties  in  about  2016
because he assisted his mother financially with her health issues. He also claimed that
the issues he had  because he  co-signed on the car loan  listed in SOR ¶ 1.a kept him
from  getting  back  on  track  with  his  finances.  He  claimed  that  he  has  learned  from  his
mistake  of  co-signing  for  a  colleague  and  will  never  do  so  again.  He  presented  no
evidence  to  show he has participated in financial  counseling or  has  a working budget.
He did not present evidence of his current financial situation, such as his gross monthly
income, deductions, monthly expenses, and monthly net remainder. (Items 2-4)
