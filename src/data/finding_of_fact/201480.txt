In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions
are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  57-year-old  consultant  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  since
June  2017.  He  served  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  Air  Force  from  March  1986  to  April
2011,  when  he  retired  as  a  master  sergeant  (pay  grade  E-7).  He  held  a  security
clearance while he  was  in the Air Force.  He was unemployed from April 2011 until he
was  hired  by  his  current  employer.  He  received  a  bachelor’s  degree  from  an  online
university in May 2017.
Applicant  married  in  June  1986  and  divorced  in  September  2006.  He  has  two
adult  children  from  his  marriage,  and  a  20-year-old  daughter  from  a  subsequent
relationship.  He  has  provided  financial  support  totaling  about  $30,000  to  his  youngest
daughter.
The SOR alleges that Applicant failed to file federal and state income tax returns
for  tax  years  2018,  2019,  2020,  and  2021.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b)  In  his  SCA,  he
disclosed  his  failure  to  file  federal  and  state  returns  and  stated  that  he  was  unsure
whether he owed any taxes. He stated that he had  “no  legitimate  reason” for not  filing
the returns. (FORM Item 2 at 35) When he was interviewed by a security investigator in
April  2021,  he  attributed  his  failure  to  file  the  returns  to  “forgetting  and  a  lack  of
motivation.”  (FORM Item 3 at 9) In his answer to the SOR, he stated that he had filed
the  federal  and  state  returns  for  2019,  2020,  and  2021,  and  that  he  had  contacted  a
professional tax preparer to obtain the necessary documentation to file his federal and
state returns for 2018. He did not submit any documentation to support his answer.
The  SOR also alleges  a  delinquent auto  loan  charged  off for $5,151.  (SOR ¶  1.c)
In   Applicant’s  interview  with   a   security  investigator  in  April  2021,  he   attributed   this
delinquency  to  unemployment  after retiring  from  the  Air  Force  and  his retired  pay being
insufficient  to   pay  his  debts.   (FORM   Item   3   at   9-10)  In   his   answer  to   the   SOR,   he
claimed   that   this  debt   was  paid  in   full.  He   submitted   no   documentation   to   support  his
claim.  Credit  reports   from   March   2021   and   July  2022   reflect   that   the   debt  was
unresolved. (FORM  Item  4  at 3; FORM  Item 5  at 2) However, the  debt is not reflected  in
a credit report from January 2023. (FORM item 6)
The  March 2021  credit  report also  reflects  two  credit-card accounts  charged off
for  $4,475  and  $77,  and  two  consumer  accounts  placed  for  collection  of  $4,320  and
$655. These debts are not alleged in the SOR.
