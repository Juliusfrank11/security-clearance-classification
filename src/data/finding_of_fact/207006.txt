Applicant  admitted  all  the  SOR  allegations,  with  some  explanations.  (SOR  ¶¶
1.a-1.t).  Her  admissions  are  incorporated  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  review  of  the
pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 47-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She has worked for
this  employer  since  September  2020.  She  is  an  accounting  technician.  She  has  been
continuously employed since 2006. She is a high school graduate. She married in 1995
and was divorced in 2009. She has no children. (Items 2-3)
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant  owed  20  delinquent  debts  totaling  approximately
$26,500. The debts were comprised of consumer debts, mostly delinquent credit cards.
The allegations are supported by credit reports from March 2022 and March 2023, her
answers to questions from a  background  investigator in  April  2022,  and  admissions  in
her SOR answer. (Items 2-6)
Applicant  explained  that  she  got  into  financial  difficulties  in  2004,  when  she
separated  from  her  then  husband  and  met  a  person  who  would  become  her  girlfriend
until  approximately  2019  when  the  relationship  ended.  Applicant  described  her  former
girlfriend as mentally abusive. In order to keep the girlfriend happy, Applicant applied for
and received 20 credit cards, in her name, to pay for a lifestyle the girlfriend demanded,
but which Applicant could not afford. She also financed the girlfriend’s expensive hobby
of  restoring  cars.  Applicant  was  the  primary  wage  earner  and  paid  all  the  bills  in  the
relationship.  Her  girlfriend  worked  as  a  parttime  dog  groomer.  Applicant  claims  not  to
have applied for or used any credit cards since 2017. (Item 6)
Applicant  admitted  all  the  debts  in  her  SOR  answer.  She  also  provided  the
following  explanations  about  her  SOR  debts:  “This  has  been  taken  care  of  and  no
longer on credit report,” or “Working on this now.” She provided documentation that she
paid one payment of approximately $57 toward SOR ¶ 1.t in March 2023. She claimed
that  she  has  two  payments  left  to  make  on  this  account.  She  failed  to  provide
documentation  showing  that  the  remaining  SOR  debts  were  paid  directly  or  through  a
payment plan. All the SOR debts were listed on her March 2022 credit report, but some
of these debts were not listed on her March 2023 credit report. They may have aged off
by this time, but there is no evidence that Applicant paid them. (Items 2, 4-5; AE A1-3)
Applicant  documented  that  she  is  current  and  making  regular  payments  on  a
credit card that does not appear to be an SOR debt. On this account she made two $10
payments in January 2023, on a balance of $428. She also made two $20 payments in
February 2023, on a balance of $419. She claims that she is currently financially stable
and meeting all her monthly expenses. She did not provide any documentation to show
her  current  financial  position,  such  as  a  budget,  earned  wages,  or  bank  account
information. There is no evidence of financial counseling. (Item 2, 6; AE A1, A6-A21)
