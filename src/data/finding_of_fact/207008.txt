The  SOR  contains  two  delinquent  commercial  credit-card  accounts,  two
delinquent student loans, and two delinquent medical accounts. Applicant admitted the
debts  with  explanations.  The  total  amount  of  indebtedness  is  $25,118.  The  debts
became delinquent between July 2017 and February 2022.
Applicant is 53 years old. She has been married to her second husband since
2003, and has a 32-year-old son and a 26-year-old stepson. She received a high school
diploma  in  June  1987.  She  took  college  credits  in  1987  and  2015,  but  received  no
degree.  Her  employment  since  June  2018  is  explained  on  the  first  page  of  her
Response to the SOR dated March 9, 2023. See also Paragraph III of FORM at page 3.
She has not been employed  as a management assistant by the contractor  since June
2018 as indicated in the FORM. In clarification, she worked for this contractor for a few
months in 2018 before transferring to a technologies company until October 2020. She
was  hired  by a  subcontractor  of  her current employer  (March  9, 2023  response  to  the
FORM),  then  became  a  full-time  employee  of  the  company  in  March  2022.  She  has
been  a  technical  editor  in  all  positions  since  June  2018.  In  the  14  years  of  her
professional career, she has been employed in technical editor positions. She revealed
in  her  June  2018 e-QIP  that  she  was  delinquent to  the  SOR ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b  creditors.
(GE 3 at 23-27; March 9, 2023 response to the FORM)
Before Applicant’s employment as a management assistant for a few months in
2018,  she  was  a  bartender  for  six  months  in  December  2017  to  June  2018.  She  was
unemployed from May 2016 to December 2017. Before her unemployment, she was a
technical  editor  and  analyst  from  July  2012  to  April  2016.  She  was  also  a  technical
editor for another employer from March 2012 to July 2012. (Item 3 at 14-17)
SOR ¶  1.a  –   This is  a  delinquent  credit-card  account  totaling $18,801.00.  The
last   payment   activity   on   the   account  was  in  in   July  2017,   during   Applicant’s
unemployment
to   December  2017,   and   her  husband’s
underemployment,   that  was  not  as  stable  as  his  former  employment  in  the   federal
sector.  When  the  creditor no  longer accepted  smaller payments,  she  saved  her money
until  she   successfully  settled   the   account  in   March  2023   for  $9,400.  (Item   3   at   14-23;
March 2023 letter  at 2; Attachment A, presented check #3923) This account is resolved.
from   May  2016
SOR 1.b – In the Government’s February 2023 credit bureau report (CBR), this
credit-card  account  is  classified  as  charged-off  with  a  past-due  amount  of  $579.  This
account is posted as closed in the Government’s February 2022 CBR, with a delinquent
balance  of  $4,268,  the  same  amount  appearing  in  the  SOR.  Applicant’s  documented
payment  record  shows  she  has  been  making  regular  payments  to  the  creditor  since
June  2016.  Her  payments  since  August  2020,  which  have  not  been  more  than  $100
monthly,  though  probably  not  the  amount  required  under  the  terms  of  the  credit-card
contract, demonstrate her willingness to pay a small amount each month  to eventually
return  the  account  to  a  current  status.  (Item  4  at  7;  Item  5  at  2;  Attachment  E)  The
account is being resolved.
SOR  ¶¶   1.c  and   1.d   –   These   are   two   student   loans   that   Applicant  received.
Applicant was working  as a  technical writer for a  company from  2012  to  2016.  (Item  3  at
16)  Management  informed  her that  to  enhance  her chances for promotion,  she  should
enroll in additional education classes to qualify for a degree. The company paid for her
tuition.  However,  the  company  was  purchased  by  another  company.  After  receiving
good  news  that  her  husband  was  going  to  be  rehired  at  his  former  stable  federal
position in another state, Applicant learned the bad news that she would have to repay
the company for the tuition, though she had not completed the courses for the degree.
Generating  insufficient  funds  to  pay  the  loans  through  her  cosmetics  business,  she
allowed  the  loans  to  lapse.  When  she  did  not  make  the  loan  payments,  they  became
delinquent.  See  ¶¶  SOR  1.c  and  1.d.  In  October  2022,  Applicant  filed  a  student  loan
debt  relief  application.  The  application  is  pending.  Meanwhile  for  COVID-related
reasons,  the  U.S.  Department  of  Education  suspended  Applicant’s  student  loan
repayments until June 30, 2023. (March 9, 2023 response to FORM, at 2; Attachment C
at 9-16)
SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f – These are two medical accounts that became delinquent
in February 2022. On February 15, 2023, Applicant submitted documentation indicating
that she paid both accounts on February 15, 2023. (March 9, 2023 response to FORM,
Attachment D, at 18-19)
Character Evidence
In  February  2013,  Applicant  revitalized  her  religious  commitment  and
effectiveness  as  a  technical  editor.  She  believes  that  she  has  her  life  pointed  in  a
healthy and positive direction. She is dedicated to keeping her finances current. (March
9, 2023 response to the SOR, at 2) With financial counseling and utilization of a budget,
I strongly believe that Applicant’s past financial problems will not recur.
