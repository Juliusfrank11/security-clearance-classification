and  his  use  of  cocaine  on  approximately  two  occasions  between  July  2020  and  June
2021 (SOR ¶ 1.c).
Applicant used marijuana recreationally with varying frequency while in high school
and college, from about June 2016 to March 2022. Applicant believes he used marijuana
on  no  more  than  40  occasions  over  that  six-year  period.  While  in  college,  he  used

Applicant admitted his use of drugs in his SCA, in his adopted subject interview of
July 5, 2022, in his answer to the SOR, and in his response to the FORM. (Items 2-4 and
Applicant’s Response to the FORM). His statements have remained consistent. He stated
he has not used hallucinogenic mushrooms for over 18 months, cocaine for almost two
years,  and  marijuana  for  over  a  year. He  further  stated  he  no  longer  associates  with
friends who continue to use drugs. In his subject interview, he provided the names those
with whom he used drugs and contact information for the friends he still associated with
but whom, he said, also no longer use illegal drugs. He stated he regrets his former drug
use, it was foolish and immature, and he pledges to abstain from any future use. (Items
