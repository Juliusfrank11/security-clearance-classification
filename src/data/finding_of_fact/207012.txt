Applicant  is  a  48-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor  for  whom  she  has
worked since April 2015. She has also worked as a contractor with another government
agency  (AGA)  since  about  June  2022.  She  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  1996.  She
has been married since 2019 and has an eight-year-old child. (Items 2-4)
In  the  SOR,  the  Government  alleged  Applicant’s  10  delinquent  debts  totaling
approximately $80,000 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.j). These delinquencies consist of credit
cards (SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.h) and mortgages (SOR ¶¶ 1.i and 1.j.). She admitted the
allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.i  with  additional  comment.  Her  admissions  are
adopted  as  findings  of  fact.  She  denied  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.j  with  additional
comments. The credit reports do not reflect a current balance on the account referenced
in  SOR  ¶¶  1.j.  Moreover,  in  her  response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  provided  a  2022
statement from the creditor showing that this account had been satisfied. Therefore, the
allegations in SOR ¶ 1.j have not been established. (Items 1-10)
The delinquent credit card in the amount of $15,272 alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a has not
been  resolved.  Applicant  opened  this  credit  card  between  2008  and  2010  to  use  to
purchase groceries and other household items. She defaulted on the credit card in late
2019.  Beginning  sometime  in  2022,  she  contacted  the  creditor  to  make  a  payment
arrangement,  but  she  could  not  afford  the  payments  the  creditor  required.  In  her
response to the  SOR, she claimed that  she would try again, but she has not provided
evidence  of  any  subsequent  resolution  attempts.  The  credit  reports  reflect  a  last
payment date of February 2020. (Items 1, 2, 4, 7-10)
The delinquent credit card in the amount of $6,205 alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b has not
been resolved. Applicant opened this credit card about 20 years ago to use to purchase
groceries, clothes, and other household  items. She defaulted on the  credit card in late
2019.  Sometime  in  2021,  she  contacted  the  creditor  to  request  a  forbearance  on  this
account for a few months, which the creditor granted. Sometime in 2022, she contacted
the collection agency to which the creditor had referred the account to make a payment
arrangement, but she could not afford the payments the  collection agency required. In
her  response  to  the  SOR,  she  claimed  that  she  would  try  again,  but  she  has  not
provided  evidence  of  any  subsequent  resolution  attempts  with  the  creditor.  The  credit
reports reflect a last payment date of November 2020. (Items 1, 2, 4, 7-10)
The  delinquent  credit  card  in  the  amount  of  $4,826  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.c  is
resolved.  Applicant  opened  this  credit  card  in  2007  or  2008  to  use  to  purchase
groceries,  gas,  and  other  household  items.  She  defaulted  on  the  credit  card  in  late
2019.  Sometime  in  2020,  she  contacted  the  creditor  to  request  a  forbearance  on  this
account  for  a  few  months,  but  the  creditor  did  not  agree  to  her  request.  In  2022,  she
contacted  the  creditor  to  make  a  payment  arrangement,  but  she  could  not  afford  the
payments  the  creditor  required.  In  January  2023,  the  creditor  agreed  to  settle  her
account for a one-time payment of $966. She provided documentary corroboration that
she settled the account for this amount in January 2023. (Items 1, 2, 4, 7-10)
The delinquent credit card in the amount of $4,336 alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d is being
resolved.  Applicant  opened  this  credit  card  about  20  years  ago  to  use  to  purchase
clothes  and  other  household  items.  She  defaulted  on  the  credit  card  in  late  2019.
Sometime in 2020, she contacted the creditor to request a forbearance on this account
for  a  few  months,  which  the  creditor  granted.  In  2022,  she  contacted  the  creditor  to
make  a  payment  arrangement,  but  she  could  not  afford  the  payments  the  creditor
required. In January 2023, the creditor agreed to settle her account for three payments
in  January,  February,  and  March  2023.  She  provided  documentary
of  $650
corroboration  that  she  has  paid  the  January  2023  payment  and  claimed  that  she  will
timely pay the other two. (Items 1, 2, 4, 7-10)
The delinquent credit card in the amount of $3,735 alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e is being
resolved.  Applicant  opened  this  credit  card  about  20  years  ago  to  use  to  purchase
clothes  and  other  household  items.  She  defaulted  on  the  credit  card  in  late  2019.
Sometime in 2020, she contacted the creditor to request a forbearance on this account
for a few months, which the creditor granted. After her period of forbearance ended, she
contacted  the  creditor  to  make  a  payment  arrangement,  but  she  could  not  afford  the
payments  the  creditor  required.  In  January  2023,  the  collection  agency  to  which  the
creditor had referred the account agreed to accept $50 monthly payments until the  full
balance is paid. She claimed that she made one $50 monthly payment, but she has yet
to receive a receipt. She has not provided evidence of any additional payments on this
account. The February 2023 credit report reflects a last payment of January 2023. She
claimed  that  she  will  continue  to  make  her  monthly  payments  until  she  resolves  the
balance. (Items 1, 2, 4, 7-10)
The delinquent credit card in the amount of $3,523 alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f has not

arrangement, but she could not afford the payments the collection agency  required. In

she  contacted  the  creditor  to request a forbearance  on  this account  for a few months,
but the creditor would not agree to a forbearance. Sometime in 2022 and in 2023, she

SOR, she claimed that she would try again, but she has not provided evidence of  any

Applicant  had   two   delinquent  mortgage   accounts   as   alleged   in   SOR  ¶¶   1.i  and
1.j. She  claimed  that both  accounts are  held by the  same  creditor.  Both mortgages  were
secured  by a condominium  that  she  owned.  The  mortgage  alleged  in  SOR ¶  1.j was a
2014   refinance   of  an   earlier  mortgage   (the   First  Mortgage).  The   mortgage   alleged   in
SOR  ¶   1.i  was  a   second   mortgage   that  she   opened   in   about  2006   for   a   loan   amount
between   $40,000   and   $50,000   (the   Second   Mortgage).   In   about   2020,   she   fell   behind
on   her  required   payments  on   both   the   First  Mortgage   and   the   Second   Mortgage
because  her employer  did not provide  her with  enough  hours to  pay her bills.  From  the
time   she   became   delinquent   until January 2023,   she   stayed   in  consistent  contact  with
the  creditor.  She  attempted  to  resolve  these  accounts through  a  sale  and  a  deed  in  lieu
of foreclosure,  but her  efforts  were  unsuccessful. In  about 2021,  the  creditor began  the
foreclosure  process  on  the  condominium  and  subsequently  sold  the  property. The  sale
proceeds satisfied  the First Mortgage, but  not  the  Second  Mortgage.  The  First Mortgage
is resolved, but the  Second  Mortgage  is not  resolved. She  claimed  that she  contacted
the   creditor   of  the   Second   Mortgage   in  January   2023,  but  the   creditor   wanted   more
money than  she  was  able to  afford.  In  her response  to  the  SOR, she  claimed  that she
followed   up   with   an   e-mail   to   the   creditor   that  same   month   and   was   awaiting   a
response. She  provided  no evidence  of any subsequent attempts  to  resolve the  Second
Mortgage.  (Items 1, 2, 4-10)
The  primary  reason  Applicant  cited  for  her  financial  delinquencies  was  a
reduction in her income in 2019 because her employer did not offer her enough hours.
She  also  attributed  her  financial  delinquencies  to  her  husband’s  unemployment  in
February  2020,  the  pandemic,  and  various  other  foreseen  and  unforeseen  expenses.
She  claimed  that  she  moved  to  a  location  with  a  lower  cost  of  living  and  took  an
unspecified credit-counseling course in January 2023. She claimed that she is trying to
find  additional  work  to  earn  more  money,  and  that  it  has  always  been  her  intention  to
repay her SOR debts once she has the funds to do so. Despite her claim that she had
insufficient funds to address her SOR debts, in July 2021, she paid $19,000 in cash for
a  jet  ski.  She  justified  this  purchase  because  she  had  always  wanted  a  jet  ski  and
because  she  never  bought  anything  for  herself.  She  claimed  that  she  will  consult  a
bankruptcy  attorney  to  determine  if  filing  bankruptcy  is  a  viable  means  to  resolve  her
debts.  She  did  not  provide  evidence  of  her  income  or  expenses,  so  I  am  unable  to
determine whether she is able to afford her financial responsibilities. (Items 1, 4)
