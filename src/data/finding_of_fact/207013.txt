Applicant is a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since May 2022. He is applying for a security clearance for the first
time. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2017, and he attended post-graduate classes in
2017. He married in 2019. He and his wife have a child together; he adopted one of his
wife’s children; and he has a stepchild. (Tr. at 15-16; GE 1)
The  SOR  alleges  18  delinquent  debts,  however  the  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.h  is not  a
valid  debt.  The  17  remaining  SOR  debts,  as  amended,  consist  of  16  debts  with
balances totaling about $62,000 and a mortgage loan that was $34,853 past due with a
balance  of  $285,374.  Applicant  admitted  owing  all  of  the  debts.  (Tr.  at  26;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 2-3)
Applicant attributed his financial difficulties to his 2018 marriage, where he went
from  providing  only  for himself  to  instantly  having  a  family  of  four, which  increased  by
another when his child was born. He and his family moved to another city in 2020 for a
better job opportunity. The costs associated with the move placed a financial burden on
him.  He  also  admitted  that  he  made  poor  financial  decisions  and  lived  beyond  his
means. (Tr. at 12-13; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1)
Applicant and  his wife  bought a  new home  in about February 2020  in the  location
where they  moved. The  mortgage  payments were  $2,288  per  month  for 360  months  (30
years).  He   quickly  realized   that   he   could   not  maintain   the   mortgage   payments.  They
moved  out and  rented a  condominium  for $1,500  per month. The  July 2022  credit report
lists  the mortgage  account  as $34,853  past due  with  a  balance  of $285,374. Applicant
was unable to sell or otherwise resolve the  loan  before the property was foreclosed. The
March 2023 credit  report lists the account as in foreclosure with a $0 balance. (Tr. at 21-
22; Applicant’s response to  SOR; GE 1-3)
Applicant has not paid any of the debts alleged in the SOR. His wife is employed.
He  stated  that  his  family’s  expenses  are  about  $1,000  greater  each  month  than  their
income,  and  they  are  living  paycheck  to  paycheck.  He  has  not  received  financial
counseling. He and his wife own two vehicles, including one that was financed in March
2020 with a loan of about $54,800. He is looking for a second job to make up some of
the difference. He stated that he expects his financial situation and income to improve,
which will enable him to start paying his debts. He has about $38,000 in federal student
loans  that  are  currently  paused  by  COVID-19  relief  and  in  good  standing,  but  he  will
have  to  resume  paying  them  at  some  point.  He  also  accrued  a  few  additional  minor
delinquent  debts  that  were  not  alleged  in  the  SOR  and  will  not  be  used  for
disqualification  purposes  but  may  be  considered  in  the  application  of  mitigating
conditions. (Tr. at 14-15, 17-25, 29; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1-3)
