Applicant is 47 years old. He has been employed as a manufacturing planner for
a  defense  contractor  since  May  2022.  He  worked  in  various  positions  for  six  other
employers from  January 2017 until May 2022.  He  was unemployed  from May  2018 to
December 2018, March 2019 to October 2019, and January 2020 to February 2020. He

an associate degree in 2010. He married in November 2001 and divorced in May 2005.

The SOR alleges 28 delinquent debts, totaling approximately $88,500, including
16  delinquent  student  loans  totaling  $81,488  and  a  Chapter  7  Bankruptcy.  Applicant
admitted all SOR allegations, with explanation. (Item 1 at 1-5)
Applicant  attributed  his  financial  difficulties  to  his  2005  divorce,  being  a  single
parent of two children, unemployment, and costs associated with his mother’s care after
she became ill in 2019, including medical and funeral costs. (Item 3 at 2)
The evidence concerning debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below.
SOR  ¶   1.a:  Chapter  7   Bankruptcy   filed  and  discharged  in  2015.   Applicant
admitted the allegation. (Item 1) He filed for bankruptcy in February 2015 and was granted
discharge in May 2015. (Item 4 at 1, 3, 27; Item 5 at 2) Bankruptcy records show $68,270
in  total  non-priority  unsecured  debt  and  that  his  student  loan  obligations  were  not
discharged. (Item 4 at 12-13, 18-19, 28)
SOR  ¶   1.b-1.q:  student   loans   placed  for  collection  totaling  approximately
$81,488.  Applicant  admitted  each  allegation  noting  that  the  debts  “ha[ve]  not  been
resolved.” (Item  1  at 1-3) He told a government investigator  that he incurred the loans
while he attended college from 2008 to 2010. He acknowledged that he had not made
any payments on the loans and that he had no real reason for failing to do so. He also
said  that  he  contacted  the  creditor  in  2014  and  set  up  a  repayment  plan  with  monthly
payments of $50 but did not follow through with payments. He noted that the loans had
been  in  forbearance  since  2020  because  of  COVID-19  relief  and  stated  his  intent  to
establish a repayment plan when that relief ends. (Item 3 at 3-4) Credit reports from May
2022 and February 2023 show each student loan account as placed for collection. (Item
5 at 2-6, Item 6 at 6-11)
SOR  ¶   1.r:  telecommunication  collection  account   for  $1,762.  Applicant
admitted the allegation, noting that “[t]he account has been removed from [his account].”
(Item 1 at 3) He reported that this debt was for his phone service account, that the creditor
contacted him in April 2022 about settling the account, that he had not attempted to pay
this debt because he did not have sufficient funds to do so, and that he intended to contact
the creditor to set up a repayment plan. (Item 3 at 2-3) The May 2022 credit report shows
this account as placed for collection. (Item 5 at 6) The February 2023 credit report does
not list this account. (Item 6) This debt is not resolved.
SOR ¶¶  1.s, 1.z: credit accounts  charged off for $1,262  and $160.  Applicant
admitted the allegations, noting that the accounts “ha[ve] not been resolved.” (Item 1 at
3-4) He told a government investigator that the accounts were credit cards that he used
for his daughter’s and his expenses. He said that he had not responded to emails from
the first creditor and has had no contact with the second creditor. He stated his intent to
contact both creditors to set up repayment plans. (Item 3 at 2-3) Credit reports from May
2022 and February 2023 show each account as charged off. (Item 5 at 7-8, Item 6 at 1,5)
These debts are not resolved.
SOR ¶  1.t: credit collection account for $824. Applicant admitted the allegation
and said that he was “currently making payments.” (Item 1 at 3) He submitted evidence
that he had entered a payment agreement with the creditor, that the account balance had
been  reduced  to  $776  after his January 2023  payment, and that  he  was  scheduled  to
make monthly payments of about $28 until November 2024. (Item 1 at 9-13) The February
2023 credit report showed a past due balance of $804 for this collection account. (Item 6
at 5)
SOR ¶  1.u: collection account  for $697.  Applicant admitted the allegation, noting
that the account “has not been resolved.” (Item 1 at 3) He reported that he used this credit
card account for his daughter’s college expenses and stated his intent to resolve this debt.
(Item 3 at 4) The May 2022 credit report shows the account as placed for collection in the
amount alleged. (Item 5 at 7) This debt is not resolved.
SOR ¶¶  1.v-1.w: collection account  for $617  and  credit card  charged off for
$615.   Applicant  admitted  the  allegations,  declared  the  debts  had  been  paid,  and
submitted evidence that the accounts were resolved in June 2022 and November 2022,
respectively. (Item 3 at 3, 8; Item 6 at 6) These debts are resolved.
SOR ¶¶  1.x-1.y:  telecommunication collection accounts  for $585  and $490.
Applicant admitted  the  allegations, noting  that the  accounts “ha[ve] not been  resolved.”
(Item 1 at 3-4) He  told a government investigator that  that  he  intended  to contact the first
creditor to  dispute  the  erroneous service  charge  and  that  he  would  contact  the  second
creditor to  establish  a  payment  plan.  (Item  3  at 3-4) The  May  2022  credit report  shows
the  accounts  as placed  for collection  in the  amounts  alleged. (Item  5  at 8) These  debts
are not resolved.
SOR  ¶¶   1.aa-1.bb:  charged  off  credit  accounts   with   $0   balances.   Applicant
admitted the allegations. (Item 1 at 4) I find for Applicant on both allegations because the
May  2022  credit  report  reflects  that  both  debts  were  transferred  or  sold  and  had  no
balance due. (Item 5 at 9-10)
