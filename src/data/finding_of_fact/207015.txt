In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all but one of the SOR debts alleged
under  Guideline  F  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.l),  all  with  the  same  explanation.  He  denied  the
remaining  debt  (SOR  ¶  1.m)  and  denied  the  falsification  allegation  under  Guideline  E
(SOR ¶ 2.a). His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough
and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant is 56 years old. He is employed as a security officer. According to his
SCA, he has worked for the employer sponsoring him for a clearance since June 2022.
He also reported working as a security officer for another employer since June 2018. He
previously worked for another employer in a similar job from February 2019 to June 2022.
Before that, he was unemployed from 2011 to 2018 and then worked part-time from May
2017 to February 2019. He served in the Marine Corps from 1986 to 1990 on active duty
and then from 1990 to 1999 he served in the Marine Corps Reserve. He was discharged
honorably. He married in 1996, and he and his wife separated in July 2018. They remain
separated. He and his wife have two adult children in their 20s. (Item 2)
The record includes credit bureau reports (CBRs), from July 2022 and March 2023
(Items 4, 5), which establish the delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR.
The SOR debts total $60,334 in past-due debts, either charged off or reported for
collection. All but one of them appear to be consumer credit accounts. Applicant asserts
in his SOR Answer that all of the charges were made by his spouse during a time when
he was not working. He said she was paying on the debts until they separated. He said
he  was  not  aware  of  them  until  he  spoke  to  the  investigator  (during  his  background
interview). Applicant provided no indication that any debts have been, or are being, paid,
or that he has taken any steps to resolve or dispute them.
All  of the  debts  are  listed  on  Applicant’s July 2022  credit  report (Item  4) and  most
of them  are listed  on  his March 2023  credit report as well. (Item  5)  All  of the  accounts
listed   in  the   SOR  are   listed   as  “Indiv   Acc”  (Individual account)  on   his  July  2022   credit
report. (Item 4)The debts are detailed  as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a ($18,527) is a credit account that has been charged off by a department
store. SOR ¶ 1.b ($10,063) is an account that has been charged off by a bank. SOR ¶ 1.c
($6,255) is an account placed for collection by a bank. SOR ¶ 1.d ($5,822) is an account
that has been charged off by a bank.
SOR ¶¶ 1.e ($5,036), 1.f ($4,352) and 1.g ($2,287) are accounts placed with the
same  collection  agency  by  three  separate  banks.  SOR  ¶  1.h  ($2,286)  is  an  account
placed  for  collection  by  a  bank.  It  has  the  same  account  number  and  the  same  bank
creditor as the debt at SOR ¶ 1.g, so I conclude it is the same debt.
SOR ¶ 1.i ($1,957) is an account placed for collection by a bank. SOR ¶ 1.j ($1,879)
is a credit account placed for collection by a department store. SOR ¶ 1.k ($1,087) is an
account placed for collection by a credit card company. SOR ¶ 1.l ($568) is an account
placed for collection by a bank. SOR ¶ 1.m ($215), which Applicant denies without further
explanation, is a cable account placed for collection.
Applicant did not disclose any delinquent debts on his SCA. (Item 2 at 32-33). In
his  September  2022  background  interview,  he  confirmed  his  negative  answers  to  all
financial related questions on his SCA and did not acknowledge any delinquencies. He
was then confronted with evidence of his debts. He then said they were all credit cards
or store credit card accounts that his wife opened. He said she would pay the accounts
until they separated but then stopped making the payments out of spite. He thinks she
opened more accounts after they separated. He asserted that he gets no information from
creditors, such as bills or notices. He said he did not list them on his SCA because he did
not  have  information  about  them  at  the  time.  He  said  he  planned  to  address  these
accounts  appropriately during  divorce proceedings  with  his divorce attorney.  He  never
used these cards but the balances are probably right. (Item 3)
Applicant did not provide any documents with his answer to the SOR. There is no
indication that he has made any effort to pay or resolve any of his SOR debts.  He has
not indicated that he has participated in credit counseling or follows a budget.
