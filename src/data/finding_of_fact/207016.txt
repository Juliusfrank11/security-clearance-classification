In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions
are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  30-year-old  hardware  test  engineer  employed  by  a  defense
contractor  since  September  2020.  He  attended  a  university  from  August  2011  to  May
2020, when he received a bachelor’s degree. He took more than the usual four years to
earn  his  degree,  because  he  worked  full  time  while  attending  college.  He  has  never
married and has no children. He has never held a security clearance.
The  SOR  alleges  multiple  instances  of  drug  involvement  from  May  2007  to
September 2022. The evidence concerning each of the allegations of drug involvement
alleged in the SOR is summarized below.
SOR ¶  1.a: use  of  marijuana  with varying frequency  from about  May  2007  to
September   2022.
When  Applicant  submitted  his  SCA,  he  disclosed  that  he  used
marijuana  recreationally  a  “few  times  per  year,”  less  than  100  times  in  his  lifetime,
between  May  2007 and  August 2020.  He  stated that people with whom he associates
use marijuana regularly because it is legal where he lives. He  stated that he  does not
seek it out or use it regularly, but he uses it at social settings such as parties.  (FORM
Item 3 at 46)
In   response   to   DOHA   interrogatories  in   August  2021,  Applicant  stated   that  he
had  stopped  using  marijuana  because  of a  “job  requirement.” He stated  that his last  use
was  in  the   spring   or  summer  of   2021,  in  a   jurisdiction   where  marijuana   use   is  legal,
when  a  joint of  marijuana  was passed  around  outside  a  bar.  He stated  that he  did not
intend to  use  illegal drugs or controlled substances in the future. (FORM Item 4  at 3-4)
In response to DOHA interrogatories in September 2022, Applicant admitted that
he  used  marijuana  once  in  July  2022  and  once  in  September  2022.  In  response  to  a
question whether he intended to use illegal substances in the future, he answered “No.”
He explained: “I answered  No, as I do not intend  to use marijuana. My reason  is that I
never  seek  it  out,  it  is  always  a  chance  occasion  that  I  am  offered  it  and  accept.  It  is
very present in [the jurisdiction  where he lives] as  legal recreational use and I reject  it
quite often.” (FORM Item 5 at 15-16)
SOR ¶  1.b: purchase  of  marijuana  from March 2010  to  about  August 2020.
Applicant disclosed his purchases of marijuana in his SCA. (FORM Item 3 at 46) When
Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  security  investigator  in  March  2021,  he  told  the
investigator that he regularly smoked marijuana with a friend but that he does not buy it.
He  told  the  investigator  that,  because  marijuana  is  legal  where  he  lives,  he  would
consider smoking it if it is offered. (FORM Item 5 at 7)
SOR  ¶   1.c:  involvement   in  the   purchase   of   heroin  from   April   to   December
2016. Applicant disclosed in his SCA that he was dating a person who was addicted to
heroin, and he gave her a ride to the site where she purchased it. (FORM Item 3 at 46)
