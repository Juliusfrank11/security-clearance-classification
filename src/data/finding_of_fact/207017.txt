In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  the  two  allegations  in  the  SOR.
His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  55-year-old  electrician  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  since
January  2004.  He  has  held  a  security  clearance  since  2004.  (FORM  Item  6  at  8)  He
married in April 1998. He has two children, ages 22 and 18.
The SOR alleges two delinquent debts:
SOR ¶  1.a: Home-equity line of credit charged off for $23,390, amended to
allege  $16,925.  This  loan  is  reflected  in  credit  reports  from  March  2022  and  January
2023  (FORM  Items  4  and  5).  The  SOR  was  amended  to  allege  the  lower  amount
reflected in the January 2023 credit report. (FORM Item 5 at 3) The January 2023 credit
report reflects that the last payment on this debt was in July 2019. (FORM Item 4 at 3)
The  debt  is  not  resolved.  Applicant  provided  no  evidence  of  the  circumstances  under
which this debt was incurred and became delinquent, and no evidence of payments, a
payment agreement, or other ongoing plans to resolve it.
SOR  ¶   1.b:  Loan  referred  for  collection  of  $608.This  debt  is  reflected  in  a
credit  report  from  March  2022.  (FORM  Item  5  at  3)  It  is  not  reflected  in  the  January
2023 credit report. (FORM Item 4)
When  Applicant  submitted  his  SCA  in  August  2021,  he  did  not  disclose  any
delinquent  debts  or  adverse  financial  information.  The  credit  report  from  March  2022
reflected  the  debts  alleged  in  the  SOR  and  five  unalleged  credit-card  debts  with
balances  of  $5,304;  $16,582;  $439,  $7,916;  and  $5,146.  The  unalleged  credit-card
debts had been charged off and then settled for less than the full amount. (FORM Item
5) When  Applicant was interviewed  by a  security investigator in June  2022, he  could not
provide   any  information   about  the   unalleged   debts.   (FORM   Item   6   at   3-8)   I   have
considered   the   unalleged   debts   for  the   limited   purpose   of  evaluating   Applicant’s
evidence  of  extenuation, mitigation, or changed  circumstances; to  consider whether  he
has  demonstrated   successful rehabilitation;  to   decide   whether a   particular provision   of
the   Adjudicative   Guidelines  is  applicable;  and   as  part  of  my   whole-person   analysis.
ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct.  26, 2006).
When  Applicant  was  questioned  about  his  income  and  expenses,  he  reported
that his monthly take-home pay is $4,184, and his spouse’s net income is $2,126. They
also have income of $1,800 from a rental property. He estimated that their total monthly
expenses were about $5,154. (FORM Item 6 at 15-16) If his numbers are accurate, he
would have a net monthly remainder of about $3,000.
