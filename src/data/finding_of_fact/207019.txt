In her Answer, Applicant denied all the SOR allegations. She claimed that she did
not recognize the accounts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.f, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, and 1.l. She claimed that
the  debt  amounts  are  incorrect  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.c,  1.d,  1.e,  and  1.g.  Her  assertions
regarding  these  debts  are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and
careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional
findings of fact.
Applicant is 55 years old. She was married in 1995 and has three adult children.
She has worked as an advanced distributed learning specialist since 2020. She has been
consistently  employed  since  2008.  She  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  1990,  master’s
degree  in 2007,  and a doctorate in  2020.  She  served on  active  duty  in  the  Army  from
1991-1997 and received an honorable discharge. She has held a security clearance since
about 2017. (Item 2)
Applicant reported that her financial troubles started in 2020 when her husband
lost his job due to the COVID-19 pandemic and claims that he was unable to find work
until mid-2022. She did not provide information about how much monthly income they lost
as a result of his unemployment. She also reported that in 2021 she had to move after
being given 30 days notice, because her landlord sold the home that they rented. This
amount of time is standard  when a month-to-month  rental agreement is terminated. In
early 2022, she purchased land from a family member and paid their back taxes on the
land, so  they had a  place  to  live. She  did  not  provide any documentation  showing  the
amount of the purchase or the taxes paid, or state how she was able to do this while her
husband was out of work. (Answer)
Applicant stated that her poor credit was brought to her attention in 2022, and she
started  working  with  a  credit  repair  agency  after  receiving  the  SOR.  The  agency  was
supposed to assist her with debt verification and removing items from her credit report.
She provided documentation from the credit repair agency that several negative accounts
were  removed  from  her  credit  report.  However,  this  documentation  did  not  state  what
accounts were removed from her credit report or why they  were removed. She did not
provide sufficient documentation  showing  that  any of the accounts alleged in the SOR
were removed from her credit report. (Answer; Response; AE A-C)
The SOR alleges ten delinquent debts totaling about $32,000. The status of the
debts is as follows:

husband lost his job. She stated that the creditor was supposed to sell the car and she
would be responsible for the difference. She claimed that the amount charged off was the
balance  when  she  returned  the  vehicle,  but  has  not  been  given  the  sale  price  or  the
