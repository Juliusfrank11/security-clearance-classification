Under  Guideline  F,  the  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  owed  $59,393  for  ten
delinquent  student  loans  (SOR  1.a  –  1.j).  In  response,  Applicant  admitted  each  SOR
allegation and provided documents in support of his responses. (Answer)
On  February  8,  2023,  Department  Counsel  amended  the  SOR  by  adding
allegations (SOR 1.k – 1.m) that Applicant was 120 days past due a total of $7,210 for
two credit card accounts, and for missed mortgage payments. Appellant admitted all three
additional allegations. (Answer 2) The amendment is included in the record as HX 4. In
addition to the facts established by Applicant’s admissions, I make the following findings
of relevant fact.
Applicant  is  a  34-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor,  for  whom  he  has
worked  since  September  2019.  This  appears  to  be  his  first  application  for  a  security
clearance. He graduated from college in August 2012 with a bachelor’s degree in finance.
He  funded  his tuition  through  the  ten  federally-guaranteed  student  loans  addressed  in
SOR  1.a  –  1.j.  After  graduating,  he  was  first  unemployed,  then  under-employed  until
August 2013, when he was hired by a federal contractor in State A for whom he worked
until May 2015. That position paid about $36,000 annually. He then worked for another
federal contractor in State A at a higher salary until he was hired for his current position
in State B at an annual salary of about $86,000, an increase of about $10,000 annually
from his previous job. (Answer; GX 1; Tr. 8, 36 – 37).
Applicant  and  his  wife  have  been  married  since  October  2021.  She  was
unemployed  at  the  time,  but  was  hired  for  a  teaching  position  in  August  2022  with  an
annual  salary  of  about  $56,000.  She  also  used  student  loans  to  pay  for  her  college
education. (Tr. 36, 60 – 61)
When  Applicant  graduated  in  August  2012,  he  asked  to  have  his student  loans
deferred because he either had no income or held jobs paying less than $10 hourly. After
the deferment ended in January 2014, he was obligated to pay about $700 a month. He
made occasional payments, but the loans became delinquent in January 2015, and he
last made a required payment in August 2019. (GX 3; Tr. 38 – 42)
In  response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  claimed  he  thought  the  loans  had  been
consolidated  and  that  his  mother  was  helping  repay  them.  As  it  turns  out,  Applicant’s
mother had  obtained other student  loans  in her own  name  to help  him pay  his tuition.
Applicant further claimed he was not aware of his delinquencies and the adverse effects
they had on his credit until his wages were garnished in 2019. Further, he attributed his
inability to repay his student loans, in part, to the fact his wages were being garnished. In
March 2020, Applicant stopped making any payments because of the student loan relief
measures provided through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES)
Act enacted by Congress. (Answer; GX 2)
Applicant  did  not  contact  his  student  loan  creditors  after  his  loans  became
delinquent  in  2015  or  after  his  wages  were  garnished  in  2019.  With  his  Answer,  he
provided information that showed he owed a total of $69,593, and that he had enrolled in
a student loan rehabilitation program on April 29, 2021, just before he responded to the
SOR. That program called for Applicant to make monthly payments of $327 between May
2021 and March 2022. As of this hearing, he had made two of those payments in May
2021. Interest accrual on, and repayment of, qualifying federally guaranteed student loans
are currently scheduled to resume in September 2023 and October 2023, respectively.
Applicant insists he will be able to afford those payments and will make them as required.
He described his student loans as being in good standing but at a “standstill” because of
COVID relief measures. (Answer; AX B; Tr. 33 – 34)
Applicant moved from State A to State B in 2019. He and his wife bought a house
in State B in May 2022. Using only Applicant’s income, the purchase was financed with a
$385,000  mortgage.  The  required  monthly  payment  for  principal,  interest,  taxes,  and
insurance is $2,876. As of November 2022, he was three months past due and, as alleged
at SOR 1.m, owed $6,128. On February 2, 2023, around the time he answered the SOR,
he  paid  $4,500  toward  that  debt.  On  March  1,  2023,  he  paid  another  $3,500  to  his
mortgage debt. Applicant explained that to pay this and his other debts, he withdrew about
$11,000 from a 401(k) retirement account to apply to his debts. He understands that he
will  incur  an  income  tax  penalty  because  of  his  early  withdrawals  from  his  retirement
account. Additionally, about  two weeks before  his hearing, he  contacted  the mortgage
lender to discuss a repayment plan for the $1,600 arrearage he says he still owes. He did
not provide  any further information  showing he and the lender had established  such a
plan or that he was making his regular mortgage payments. (Answer 2; GX 5; AX A; AX
E; Tr. 34 – 35, 49 – 50, 52 – 54)
After  Applicant bought  his house  in 2022, he  opened  the  accounts listed  in SOR
1.k and  1.l to  buy home  improvement materials. The  SOR 1.k account is a  regular  retail
credit account  at a  home  improvement store.  By February 2023, he  was at least 120  days
past due  on  that account.  After the  hearing, Applicant paid  off  that debt on  March 1, 2023.
He  opened   the   SOR  1.l  account  at  a   flooring   store   because   it   included   an   offer   of   no
interest  for 12  to  18  months  using  the  store’s  financing. He  thought that meant he  did not
have  to  make  a  payment for that period. I held the  record open  after hearing, in part, to
allow him  to  provide  information  that would support what amounts to a  dispute  about his
obligation   to   pay  this  debt.  After  the   hearing,   he   provided   documentation   of  a   $969
payment  on  March 1, 2023,  towards an  account balance  of $4,014. The  record  does not
reflect any  regular payments on  this  account  and  it is  not clear if  his  payment  was made
to settle his obligation. (GX 5; AX C; AX D; Tr.  47 – 52)
Applicant  asserts that he  and his wife  live  frugally,  have tried  cutting  expenses,
and use a monthly budget. He provided no written information about their finances, and
he has not sought professional financial counseling. Together they earn a gross annual
income in excess of $140,000. However, his wife has her own student loans to repay and
is  trying  to  build  up  her  savings  at  the  same  time.  For all  practical  purposes,  they  are
supported by Applicant’s income only. Although their house is titled in both their names,
only his name  is on the  mortgage, and  only his income  is available  to  support both  of
them and to repay his past-due and delinquent debts. They have about $1,000 remaining
each month after expenses excluding debt payments. (Tr. 58 – 66)
