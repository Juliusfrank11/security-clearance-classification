Applicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since January 2020. He served on active duty in the U.S. military
from 1992 until he was discharged with a general under honorable conditions discharge
in 1994. He attended college for a period, but he did not earn a degree. He is married
with two children, ages 22 and 19. (Items 2, 3)
Applicant  filed  a  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  case  in  December  2015.  Under
Schedule  D,  Creditors  Who  Have  Claims  Secured  by  Property,  the  petition  listed
mortgage  loans  of  $94,416  and  $9,345  (the  house  was  valued  at  $119,700).  Under
Schedule E/F, Creditors Who Have Unsecured Claims, there were no priority unsecured
claims. Nonpriority unsecured claims totaled $31,857. (Items 1-4)
In August 2020, the  Chapter 13 bankruptcy case was converted to a Chapter 7
bankruptcy,  and  his  dischargeable  debts  were  discharged.  The  trustee  reported  that
during  the  Chapter  13  bankruptcy,  Applicant  paid  a  total  of  $17,296.  Of  that  amount,
$4,418  went  to  attorney’s  fees,  court  costs,  and  trustee  expenses  and  compensation;
$12,063 went to secured claims; and $813 went to unsecured claims. (Items 1, 3, 4)
Applicant did not file his federal and state  income tax returns for tax years 2018
and 2019. He submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) on April
30, 2020. He reported that he had not filed his 2018 income tax returns. He wrote that
he was going to file them himself, so he would not have to pay anyone. He wrote that he
planned to file his 2018 returns with his 2019 returns. (Items 1-4)
Applicant  attributed his  financial  problems  to  his wife’s medical condition,  which
caused  her  to  be  frequently  out  of  work.  He  was  interviewed  for  his  background
investigation in June 2020. He discussed his financial issues. He stated that his wife’s
medical condition  was resolved  through  surgery  about a  year before  the  interview.  He
also  indicated  that  his  wife  had  been  unable  to  work  as  many  hours  because  of  the
COVID-19 pandemic and associated shutdowns. He stated that his wife filed her 2018
tax returns, and he was supposed to go with her to the tax preparer to have his returns
prepared  at  the  same  time,  but  he  did  not  go  with  her.  He  decided  to  file  his  returns
without the assistance of a tax preparer in order to save money. His returns were more
difficult than he anticipated, and he decided to wait and file them with his 2019 returns.
He planned to pay to have the 2018 and 2019 returns prepared, and he would  file the
returns for both years in July 2020. (Item 3)
Applicant  timely  filed  his  2020  and  2021  income  tax  returns.  He  responded  to
interrogatories  in  May  2022.  He  reported  that  he  had  still  not  filed  the  2018  and  2019
returns.  He  wrote  that  his  wife  is  disabled  and  unable  to  work,  and  she  was  in  the
process  of  applying  for  disability.  He  stated  that  they  were  struggling  financially,  and
they  could  not  afford  the  $300  to  $400  for each  year  that  the  tax preparers  wanted to
charge him. (Items 3, 4)
Applicant wrote in his response to the SOR, “I was financially drained and could
not afford to pay to have tax returns filed. I will get these filed with 2022 tax returns.” He
did not respond to the FORM, so there is no evidence that the returns have been filed.
