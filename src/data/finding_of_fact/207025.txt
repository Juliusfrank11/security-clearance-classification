Applicant,  29,  has  worked  for  his  current  employer,  a  federal  contracting
company  since  April  2019  as  an  engineer.  He  completed  a  security  clearance
application, his first, in June 2019. He disclosed three delinquent accounts totaling over
$12,000.  He  also disclosed  a  civil court  action  filed against  him  by  a  creditor.  He also
provided  information  about  his  student  loans.  The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  is
indebted  to  five  creditors  for  $63,260,  including  eight  student  loan  accounts  totaling
$41,86 . He admits the allegations. (GE 1, 3, 5)
Applicant  attended  a  private  university  in  State  1  for  his  undergraduate  studies
between  August  2010  and  May  2015.  He  financed  his  education  with  student  loans.
After  graduating,  he  began  a  job  with  a  local  company  as  a  contractor.  When  he
accepted employment, the company  assured him that they had plenty of work for him.
Between  May  and  December  2015,  he  worked  between  35  and  45  hours  per  week,
earning $15 per hour. He was able to support himself, live within his means, and save
money. (GE 1; Tr. 30-31, 51)
In January 2016, the work stopped. Applicant actively tried to find other work but
was  unsuccessful.  He  was  underqualified  for  jobs  in  his  field  and  told  that  he  was
overqualified for other entry level positions outside the engineering field. In April 2016,
he  accepted  a position  as  a  substitute  teacher in  the  local school system.  However,  it
took  several  months  to  complete  the  required  administrative  process;  as  a  result,  he
could  not  accept  assignments  until  following  school  year.  Applicant  exhausted  his
savings. His only income came from his job as a delivery driver for a sandwich shop. He
earned $7.25 per hour and between $20 and $50 in tips each shift. He used the credit
card  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.l  ($7,955)  to  pay  his  expenses.  When  Applicant  began
substitute teaching, he stopped using the  credit  and adjusted his  living  expenses to fit
his income. However, he did not earn enough money to pay his past due accounts. (Tr.
31-32, 52-55)
In  June  2017,  Applicant  secured  a  job  in  the  engineering  field  earning  $15  per
hour. When he left the position in April 2019, he was earning $18 per hour. During the
two  years  of  this  employment,  he  began  to  rehabilitate  his  finances,  and  rebuild  his
savings. After paying his expenses, he had $484 of disposable income each month. (Tr.
55-56)
In April 2019, Applicant resolved one of the debts he disclosed on his June 2019
security  clearance  application,  $3,036  for  unpaid  rent.  He  also  paid  the  amount  past-
due on his car loan, and paid off the car in full in May 2020. The debts alleged in SOR
¶¶ 1.a ($93), 1.b ($97), and 1.c ($226) are for utility bills from State 1. Applicant believes
he incurred the debts when he moved and forgot to close the accounts. He resolved the
three accounts in November 2022. The creditor charged off the account alleged in SOR
¶  1.l  ($7,955)  in  March  2016.  He  attempted  to  negotiate  a  settlement  plan  with  the
creditor to avail. He settled the account for $3,062 in December 2022. (Tr. 29-32, 42-43;
AE E-H,K)
Applicant’s  student  loans  became  delinquent  while  he  was  unemployed.  He
attempted to rehabilitate the loans in July 2018 and thought they had been returned to
good standing. He did not learn the loans were delinquent until he received the SOR in
June  2020.  In  June  2021,  he  contacted  the  loan  servicer  to  rehabilitate  the  loans  and
consolidated  the  eight  loans  into  one.  The  loans  are  currently  in  administrative
forbearance  under  the  Covid-19  payment  pause.  He  elected  to  not  make  payments
during  the  payment  pause  so  that  he  could  continue  to  rebuild  his  savings.  As  of  the
hearing,  he  had  $6,000  in  savings  and  $4,000  in  his  checking  account.  The
consolidated student loan payment is $357 per month, which Applicant can comfortably
afford.  He has arranged  to have the  payments automatically withdrawn from his bank
account. (Tr. 35-37, 44-48; GE 1; AE G, I-J)
Applicant  began  his  current  job  in  April  2019,  with  a  $50,000  annual  salary.  In
January  2021,  he  received  a  raise  to  $72,000.  He  currently  has  $1,500  in  disposable
income each month. (Tr. 21-29, 56-58; AE B)
