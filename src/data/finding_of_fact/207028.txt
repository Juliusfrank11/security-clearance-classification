Applicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security
clearance. Allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are incorporated
and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow.
Background
Applicant married in March 2003 and divorced in March 2007. (GE 1; Tr. 32, 58)
He  has no children from this marriage. He remarried in in October 2011, and has one
stepchild from this marriage. (GE 1; Tr.  33-34) Applicant earned a bachelor’s degree in
June 2006. (GE 1 and AE I) He reported no military service.
Since  May  2016,  Applicant  has  been  employed  by  his  current  employer  as  a
network engineer. (GE 1; Tr.26, 80) Between October 2013 and May 2016, he worked
as  a  network  engineer  for  another  defense  contractor  in  State  2  (his  prior  state  of
residence). (GE 1) In this job, he typically worked at two main sites: one in State 1 (his
current employment state) and the other in State 3 (his current state of residence). (GE
1)
Applicant  reported  brief  unemployment  (between  January  2013  and  April  2013)
and work for another defense contractor (located in State 2) between September 2006
and  January  2013  as  a  senior  network  administrator,  who  was  detailed  primarily
overseas. (GE 1; Tr. 33-35, 59) Applicant has held a security clearance since February
2008. (GE 1; Tr. 26)
Applicant’s finances
Records document that Applicant did not timely file his federal and state income
tax  returns,  as  required,  for  tax  years  2013  through  2017.  (GEs  1-2;  Tr.  30)  He
attributed his tax filing lapses to (a) anxiety attacks when facing stressful situations like
filing tax returns and (b) losing or misplacing material tax information during his multiple
relocations. (Tr. 26-32)
During   first  his  marriage   (2003-2007),  Applicant’s  wife   (a   tax  accountant  by
training) handled  the  preparation  and  filing  of  their  federal and  state  tax  returns. (Tr. 32-
33,  38-41)  Tax  preparers  he  retained  to  file  his  returns  for  the  years  in  issue  failed  to
keep  Applicant  informed  of  their  respective  failures  to  file  his  federal  and  state  tax
returns  for  the  2013-2017  tax  years  in  issue.  (AEs  D-E;  Tr.  59-60)  In  2017,  Applicant
retained  a  tax  accounting  firm  to  help  him  with  filing  his  federal  and  state  income  tax
returns without material documents he had lost. (Tr. 47)
By April 2021, Applicant learned  from his retained tax preparers  that they had  not
filed  his  back  tax  returns as  expected. (Tr. 48) Despite  having  paid  this tax  accounting
firm  their  demanded  fees in  April  2021, the  firm  never followed  up  with  filing  his 2013-
2017   tax  returns.  (Tr.  48)   Moreover,   this  tax   preparer  never  responded   with   progress
updates. (Tr. 49-56) IRS tax transcripts for tax years 2016-2017  report additional taxes
assessed, as  well as penalties  and  interest  imposed  for late  payments and  non-filing  of
tax  returns  for  the   years  in  issue,   but  no   notations   of  any  installment  agreements
between   Applicant  and   the   IRS   for  these   years.  (AE   J)  IRS   transcripts  for  tax  years
2013-2015  reveal no  notations either of installment  agreements between  Applicant and
the IRS for these tax years.
Pressed by the IRS and state taxing authorities with demands for payments on
taxes  owed  for  the  2013-2017  tax  years,  Applicant  made  the  demanded  payments
without  filing  tax  returns  for  these  tax  years  (AEs  K-N)  and  was  credited  with  his
payments.  (AEs  K-N;  Tr.  49-52)  Some  of  Applicant’s  payments  to  these  taxing
authorities  (notably  a  $31,400  payment  to  the  IRS)  were  not  made  until  after  the
issuance of the SOR. (AEs J-N)
In  January  2021,  Applicant  retained  his  current  tax  preparer  to  help  him  in  the
preparation and filing of his tax returns and respond to a letter from the IRS demanding
$32,000.  (AE  K;  Tr.  49)  However,  this  tax  preparer  never  responded  with  progress
updates. (Tr. 49-56) Beginning in 2018, Applicant adjusted his tax payment practice and
tendered $30,000 to the IRS to cover late taxes, interest, and penalties imposed by the
IRS for tax year 2016. (AE J; Tr. 49)
Applicant  documented  his  self-filing  of  his  federal  and  state  income  tax  returns
for  tax  years  2013-2019  between  January  2022  and  October  2022,  well  past  the
issuance of the SOR in August 2021, and without any documented extensions. (AEs F
and J; Tr. 51-52, 60-62) Currently, Applicant uses a bookkeeper and accountant to help
him prepare and file his taxes. (Tr. 52-53) With his updated filing practice, he has been
able to timely file his federal and state tax returns for tax years 2018 through 2021. (Tr.
53-56)
Taxes owed to State 1 (his employment state) for tax years 2016 ($13,031) and
2017 ($9,137) have since been repaid in 2022 and credited to Applicant, along with his
late filing of State 1 income tax returns for these tax years. For only two of the tax years
in issue (2016-2017) did Applicant apparently owe taxes to State 1, and this was due to
his commuting to the state from his current residence in State 3. (AE F and M)
Likewise,  taxes  owed  to  State  2  for  tax  year  2015  ($4,542)  and  tax  year  2016
($885)  have  reportedly  been  paid  (dates  unclear).  (AE  N)  Only  the  small  amounts
reportedly owed to his current state of residence (State 3) for tax years 2013 ($184) and
2016  ($380)  lack  any  payment  documentation.  In  the  non-resident  tax  return  he  filed
with  State  3  covering  tax  year  2016,  he  claimed  source  income  from  State  1  (of
$211,633  in  adjusted  gross  income  and  $199,287  after  adjustments  in  State  1  source
income). (AE F)
For  2017,  Applicant  filed  a  partial  resident  tax  return  with  State  3  and  reported
only $10 in source income from that state, with the balance in source income reported
to  State  1  for  that  tax  year.  (AE  F)  Whether  Applicant  owes  any  more  in  allocated
source income to State 3 (a low tax state) after allowing for payment credits to State 1
(a high tax state) for tax years 2016 and 2017 is unclear. Applicant’s efforts to obtain an
updated  status  report  of  any  taxes  owed  to  State  3  have  been  unsuccessful.  (AE  P)
Payment credits for each of these states post-date the issuance of the SOR in August
2021.  Applicant’s  efforts  to  reach  state  3  tax  enforcement  authorities  to  verify  his  tax
status were unsuccessful despite his repeated efforts to verify his current tax status with
the state.
Because  State  1  had  reciprocity  with  State  3  (Applicant’s  state  of  residence
during the relevant tax years in question, tax years 2015-2018), Applicant reported all of
his earned income from his work in State 1 on his State 1 tax returns for tax years 2016
and 2017, with slight adjustments in  2016  to account for small State 3 source income.
(AEs F and M; Tr. 80) And, because he has continued to commute to State 1 from State
3, (allocating most of his source income to State 1  where his employer is located),  he
has continued to treat State 1 as his principal taxing state jurisdiction. (Tr. 81-84)
Federal  taxes  owed  for  tax  years  2016  ($458)  and  2017  ($8,204) total $45,599
(inclusive  of  assessed  filing  late  penalties  and  accrued  interest)  according  to  IRS  tax
transcripts. (AE J) After credits assigned to payments transferred in from prior tax years
(totaling $35,702) for tax year 2017, the IRS reduced Applicant’s owed taxes to $8,024
on  reported  income  of  $177,415.  (AEs  F  and  J)  Without  more  tax  information  from
Applicant on his credited payments,  his reported  IRS  balance owing  for tax  year 2017
cannot be favorably reconciled.
Except for his still unresolved tax liabilities, Applicant’s finances appear to be in
stable operating condition. His credit report assigned an excellent credit score of 805 on
his reported debts of $469,819. (AE O; Tr. 56) Although he could have likely benefitted
from both mental health and financial counseling, he has opted for neither to help him
with his past tax filing difficulties, electing instead to address his tax returns by himself
with the aid of a bookkeeper and accountant.
Endorsements
Applicant  is  highly  regarded  by  his  company  president,  supervisors  (past  and
present), and his coworkers. (AEs G-H) His chief executive officer (CEO) expressed his
appreciation for Applicant’s “hard work, patience and support” and rewarded him with a
bonus for the 2021 calendar year. (AE G)
Friends  and  coworkers  credited  Applicant  with  intelligence  and  concern  for
others. (AE  H)  A  current  company administrator  credited  Applicant  with  paying his fair
share of taxes. (AE H) Applicant has received numerous certifications of achievement in
the information technology field. (AE I)
