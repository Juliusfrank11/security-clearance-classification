In  his  answer,  Applicant  admitted  all  the  SOR  allegations  (¶¶  1.a-1.o)  with
explanation. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. Based on my review
of  the  pleadings,  evidence  submitted,  and  testimony,  I  make  the  following  additional
findings of fact:
Applicant  is  38  years  old.  He  married  in  2003,  separated  in  about  2011,  and
divorced in 2014. He has three minor children with his first wife. He was married a second
time from 2016-2021, and a third time in 2022. He served on active duty in the Air Force
from 2002-2012, and in the Air Force Reserve from 2012-2016. He received an honorable
discharge. He has attended some college classes, but has not earned a degree. He has
worked for a government contractor in an information technology position since 2017. (Tr.
22-25; GE 1)
When Applicant and his first wife separated in about 2011, he signed a  support
agreement  where  he  agreed  to  pay  $3,000  monthly  in  child  support  and  alimony.  He
stated that he was pressured into signing this agreement, and that this amount was almost
his  whole  monthly  paycheck.  He  was  advised  by  base  legal  counsel  not  to  sign  the
agreement, but he believed it would impact his military career if he did not. He reported
that this support agreement was incorporated into his final divorce decree. He stated that
it was rare that he was able to pay his ex-wife the full amount of support, and he would
pay her partial cash payments when he was able. After their divorce, he and his ex-wife
moved to State A. In 2017, she filed an enforcement action with the state child support
agency. He represented himself in the proceeding. While his monthly support obligations
were  lowered  to  $1,200,  he  was  assessed  with  an  arrearage  of  about  $122,000.  The
current balance of his outstanding child support is about $134,794. (Tr. 27-83; GE 5; AE
K)
Applicant reported having financial problems since the early 2000s. He and his first
wife filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2004, with about $31,000 in liabilities. Over the last
ten years, he has had continual financial delinquencies. He and his first wife had their
home  foreclosed  in  2014.  He  claimed  that  they  could  have  sold  the  home  before
foreclosure, but she would not agree to the sale terms. In 2018, a state tax lien was filed
against him for about $1,800. He stated that he was unaware of the lien, and it has not
been satisfied. These items were not alleged in the SOR. (Tr. 27-83; GE 6, 10)
The SOR alleges 14 delinquent debts totaling $86,204, and failure to file his federal
and state income tax returns for 2021. The status of the allegations are as follows:
SOR ¶  1.a  alleged a debt for child support arrears totaling $57,740.  The record
shows  that  Applicant  actually  owes  $134,794.  While  it  appears  that  his  paycheck  has
been consistently garnished since March 2020, he is not meeting his obligations because
the  balance  has  steadily  grown  about  $10,000  over  three  years.  He  did  not  provide
documentation showing his track record of payments from earlier dates. (Tr. 27-83; GE
2, 3, 5; AE K, P)
SOR ¶  1.b is an auto-loan that has been charged off for $6,545. The vehicle was
repossessed in about 2012, after he became separated from his first wife.  He has not
taken any action on it and this debt is unresolved. (Tr. 51-68; GE 2, 3)
SOR ¶  1.c is a credit card placed for collection for $5,043. The debt originates from
about 2012. He has not taken any action on it and this debt is unresolved. (Tr. 51-68; GE
2, 3)
SOR ¶¶  1.d  and  1.e are student loans placed for collection for $2,203 and $1,639,
respectively.  These  debts  originated  in  about  2019.  Applicant  settled  the  loans  in
February 2022 for $2,300. (Tr. 51-68; GE 3, 4, 12; AE F)
SOR ¶  1.f is a Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) debt placed for
collection for $1,491. This debt originated in 2016. Applicant stated that this debt could
have  been  a  tuition  overpayment.  He  has  not  taken  any  action  on  it  and  this  debt  is
unresolved. (Tr. 51-68; GE 2, 3, 4, 12)
SOR ¶¶  1.g  and  1.l are  medical debts  placed  for collection  for $1,306  and  $592,
respectively. Applicant  is unsure of the  origin  of the  first debt.  He stated  that the  second
medical debt may be  connected to  a  work injury. He does not know  the  first creditor and
has not  taken  any action  with  the  second  creditor. These  debts are unresolved. (Tr. 51-
68; GE  2, 3)
SOR ¶  1.h is a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) debt placed for collection for
$616. Applicant stated that this may have been an overpayment to him from 2015, and
he  may  have  made  a  payment  on  this  debt.  He  did  not  provide  any  documentation
supporting this claim. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 51-68; GE 2, 3)
SOR ¶  1.i is a utility bill placed for collection for $592. Applicant has not taken any
action on it and this debt is unresolved. (Tr. 51-68; GE 3)
SOR ¶  1.j is a personal loan that has been charged off for $7,316. Applicant stated
that he used this loan to pay off some credit card debt and prepay his car payments. He
has not taken any action on it and this debt is unresolved. (Tr. 51-68; GE 2)
SOR ¶ 1.k is a credit card placed for collection for $548. This debt originated from
about 2018. Applicant stated that he could not afford to pay the debt. He has not taken
any action on it and this debt is unresolved. (Tr. 51-68; GE 2, 4)
SOR ¶  1.m is a home service bill placed for collection for $293. This debt originated
over ten  years ago.  Applicant stated that  he and his  first  wife  could  not  agree on  who
should pay the debt when it was incurred. He has not taken any action on it and this debt
is unresolved. (Tr. 51-68; GE 2)
SOR ¶  1.n  is a utility bill placed for collection for $280. Applicant claims that he
does not know the origin of this debt. He has not taken any action on it and this debt is
unresolved. (Tr. 51-68; GE 2)
SOR  ¶   1.n   concerns  Applicant’s  failure  to  timely  file  federal  and  state  income
returns for tax year 2021. He stated that his second wife, who is a bookkeeper, told him
that he could  file his  tax  returns at any  time.  He  submitted  unsigned  federal and  state
income  tax  returns  for  tax  year  2021,  but  did  not  provide  documentation  showing  that
these returns were filed. (Tr. 69-72; AE L, M)
Applicant  failed  to  provide  documentation  concerning  his  current  financial
situation, such as his monthly income and expenses, his assets, or whether he follows a
budget.  He  has  not  had  credit  counseling.  He  submitted  three  employment  records
showing that for the last two years his work performance has exceeded expectations and
met expectations for three years prior. He submitted four character letters stating that he
is a valued employee, reliable, and trustworthy. (Tr. 33; AE A, B, C, D, E)
