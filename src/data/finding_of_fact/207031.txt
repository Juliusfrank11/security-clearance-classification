In Applicant's Answer to the SOR, he admitted all SOR allegations except for SOR
¶ 1.i with explanation.
Applicant  is  a  48-year-old   electronics  technician   employed   by   two   defense
contractors  under the  same  contract since  July  2018.  He  served  in  the  Navy from  May
1993  to  February 2017, was honorably discharged  and  retired  as an  E-7.  He  worked  as
an  electronic warfare analyst for a  third  defense  contractor from  March 2017  to  April 2018
and  was unemployed  from  April 2018  to  July 2018.  He has held  a  security clearance  since
1993. (GE 1; AE  D; Tr.  10, 19-20, 48-50, 95-96)
Applicant reported no education or degree in the 10 years prior to completing  a
security  clearance application  (SCA) in  November 2019.  He married  in  February 1996
and has three adult children, ages 31, 30, and 26. His oldest child is disabled and resides
with Applicant and his wife. (GE 1; Tr. 47-48, 88, 92-95)
After retiring from the Navy,  Applicant  worked  for a defense  contractor  near his
final  duty  station  in  State  1.  His  annual  salary  was  $87,500.  He  agreed  to  his  wife’s
request to relocate to State 2 because she had endured multiple moves during his naval
career. His family moved to State 2 and purchased a home in December 2017. (GE 3 at
5; Tr. 49-52, 94)
Applicant  continued  to work and  reside  in  State  1  while  seeking  employment  in
State 2.  He applied  for a  promising  job opportunity and  communicated  with  a defense
contractor in State 2 from January to March 2018. (Tr. 51) In February 2018, he financed
a new truck for about $48,000. (GE 1 at 61-62, GE 3 at 3) In April 2018, he quit his job in
State 1 and moved to State 2 in anticipation of being hired into the position he had been
pursuing.  (GE  1  at  16;  Tr.  51-53)  He  was  unemployed  from  April  2018  to  July  2018
because of unexpected delay by the prospective employer. (Id.) In July 2018, he accepted
a position with the defense contractor in State 2 with an annual salary of $62,000, about
$23,000 less than he had anticipated. (Tr. 51-53)
In  his  November  2019  SCA  Applicant  disclosed  approximately  $92,000  of
delinquent debt including the past-due truck loan ($47,000), and an additional $23,000 of
his wife’s delinquent debt. (GE 1 at 41-61) The SOR alleges $54,011 in delinquent debt
including a mortgage past due in the amount of $16,810 (SOR ¶ 1.a), the truck loan past-
due  in  the  amount  of  $1,600  (SOR  ¶  1.b)  and  10  delinquent  credit  accounts  totaling
$35,601. (SOR ¶¶ 1.c through 1.l).
Applicant  attributes  his  financial  problems  to  unemployment  from  April  to  July
2018,  underemployment  including  an  unanticipated  $23,000  reduction  in  his  annual
salary, the purchase of a home in State 2 in December 2017, the cost of maintaining two
households from late 2017 to April 2018, and moving expenses. (SOR Response; GE 1
at  42-61;  Tr.  49-53,  76-77)  He  prioritized  debts  and  initially  focused  on  paying  the
mortgage and other essential bills but continued to fall behind. He considered filing for
bankruptcy but decided not to. (GE 1 at 41-61; Tr. 50-56) He used an unsecured credit
account to help pay the mortgage and made payments on his truck loan and two credit
accounts (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 1.g and one debt not alleged in the SOR (non-SOR debt)).
(Tr. 65-66, 79-80)
Applicant  testified   that   in  about   December  2020,   he   entered   a   debt  negotiation
agreement with  a  debt consolidation  company  (DCC) that included  debts alleged  in  SOR
¶¶  1.b  through  1.f, and  1.h  through  1.k,  and  a  non-SOR debt. (Tr. 12, 19-20, 31-41) He
said  that  he   paid  the   DCC  approximately  $1,000   per  month   until   he   terminated   the
agreement  in   December  2022   because   of   exorbitant   fees  and   slow  progress.   (Tr.  62)
After additional research, he entered  into  a  second  debt negotiation  agreement with  the
same   DCC  in   January   2023.   (AE   B;  Tr.   60-64)  That   agreement  addresses   $65,482   of
total debt,  including  the  debts alleged  in  SOR ¶¶  1.c through  1.f,  1.h, 1.j, and  1.k,  and
non-SOR  debt totaling  at least  $33,601,  including  his wife’s personal debt.  (AE  B  at  11-
13)   He   agreed   to  deposit  $924  monthly into   a   dedicated   savings  account beginning   in
February 2023   for an   estimated  53   months  to   resolve  the   remaining   delinquent  debts.
(AE  B  at 3,  11-13, 28-29) He did  not provide  documents to  show payments to  the  DCC,
claiming  that he  had  requested  those  documents but that the  DCC failed  to  provide  them.
(AE  C) Government  Exhibits corroborated  his claims  regarding  his  debts and  efforts  to
resolve them.  (AE  A-B)
The evidence concerning the specific SOR allegations is summarized below.
SOR ¶  1.a: mortgage  past due for $16,810  with  balance  of  $366,154.  Applicant

mortgage  payments  while  unemployed  and  underemployed,  that  he  sold  the  house  in
approximately April 2022, and paid off the mortgage. (Tr. 29-30, 48-52, 65-66, 70-71, 96)
Credit reports show that the mortgage was 120 days past due in December 2019, $16,810

December 2019, that he entered a payment plan in November 2019, and that a $3,354

error and there was no balance due, and that he would have to dispute the debt to clear
it from his credit report. (Tr. 41-42, 75-76) After the hearing Applicant submitted evidence
that he successfully disputed the debt and that his credit records would be updated to
reflect the account as paid. (AE D) This debt is resolved.
Applicant testified that his gross annual salary had increased to $70,000, and that
his  spouse  now  works  full-time.  (Tr.  76,  94)  He  provided  a  current  financial  budget
including  monthly  net  income  ($4,000);  Navy  retired  pay  ($2,000);  rent  ($1,500);
miscellaneous  expenses  ($3,300);  and  remainder  ($1,200).  (AE  B  at  9-10;  Tr.  93)  He
received financial counseling from the DCC. (AE B; Tr. 69-70)

year-old minivan  (gifted  by  a  neighbor). (Tr. 88; GE  6)  He  no  longer uses credit cards  and
has no open credit card accounts. (Tr. 87; GE 6)
I  found  Applicant's  responses  and  demeanor  at  the  hearing  to  be  credible  and
consistent  with  someone  who  was  reliably  telling  the  truth.  After  reviewing  the  entire
record,  I  find  that  his  hearing  testimony  is  corroborated  by  documentary  evidence
submitted by the government and his own exhibits. He credibly responded to all questions
and was keenly aware of the significance of resolving his debts
Applicant held a security clearance while serving in the Navy and routinely handled
classified information without reported incident. (GE 1; Tr. 10, 108) He received at least
nine personal awards during his naval service which detail his significant contributions to
DOD operations including in Iraq. The award citations note his exemplary performance
and  character,  leadership,  unrelenting  perseverance,  diligence,  complete  dedication  to
duty, exceptional professionalism, and judgment. (AE E)
