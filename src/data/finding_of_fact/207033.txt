Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant did not timely file his federal
(SOR 1.a) and state (SOR 1.b) income tax returns for tax years 2015 through 2020; and
that, for the 2012 and 2013 tax years, he incurred a debt for unpaid state taxes totaling
$21,229, of which he still owed $12,847 (SOR 1.c). The SOR also alleged that Applicant
owed  a  total  of  $4,504  for  six  unpaid  medical  bills  (SOR  1.d  –  1.i);  and  that  he  owed
another $7,378 for two past-due or delinquent credit accounts (SOR 1.j and 1.k).
In response, Applicant admitted each allegation except SOR 1.d. Each response
was  accompanied  by  explanatory  remarks,  and  he  included  documents  in  support
thereof. (Answer) In addition to the facts established by Applicant’s admissions, I make
the following findings of relevant fact.
Applicant is a 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor, where he has worked
since  February  2018.  From  August  2009  until  February  2018,  he  worked  for  another
defense contractor. He first received a security clearance in 2009. (GX 1)
Between December 2009 and November 2014, his work for his prior employer was
done  almost  entirely  overseas.  Except  for  two  months  of  paid  vacation  in  the  United
States  each  year,  all his  income  was  earned  abroad.  When  he  returned  to  the  United
States in 2014, his income fell by about half, causing him financial problems that coincided
with  other  unforeseen  financial  demands.  To  make  up  for  lost  income,  he  started
accepting  temporary  duty  (TDY)  assignments  at  various  military  customer  facilities
around the nation. Since starting work with his current employer he has continued working
on  TDY,  during  which  he  receives  additional  money  for  meals  and  incidentals,  and  is
reimbursed for other work-related expenses. To the extent he was able to reduce out-of-
pocket expenditures, he was able to save some of his per diem allowance. (GX 1; GX 3;
Tr. 32 –  36, 50 –  53)
Between  2012  and  2016,  Applicant  was married  and  divorced  twice.  Before  his
first marriage, he had a son, now age 18, for whom he paid child support until 2010, when
he was given sole custody of the child. He still supports his son with housing and ad hoc
expenses;  however,  his  son  recently  found  employment  with  a  large  corporation  that
should make him financially independent of his father. (GX 1; GX 3; Tr. 34 – 37, 70 – 72)
As alleged, Applicant did not file his federal or state income tax returns for the 2015
through 2020 tax years. He also incurred a debt for unpaid state taxes. Applicant does
not excuse his failure to file his returns as required, but he cited factors beyond his control
that  contributed  to  his  initial  failure  to  file  in  2015.  As  noted,  above,  all  of  his  income
between 2009 and 2014 was earned abroad. As a result, he received certain exemptions
from tax on his income. In 2012, he started using a tax preparation firm to prepare his
taxes. In addition to filing complexities associated with income earned abroad, Applicant
was working in a location that made it difficult for him to personally attend to his taxes. He
claims that the tax firm advised him he did not have to file any state returns because he
had  lived  and  worked  abroad  for  three  consecutive  years.  After  he  returned  from
overseas, he learned this was not true and that he had incurred the state tax debt alleged
at SOR 1.c. (Answer; GX 1; GX 3; Tr. 50 – 53, 73)
Applicant’s return from abroad also coincided with his new and unexpected role as
a  single father. His son  had  been  living  since  birth  with  the  boy’s mother; however, for
reasons not clear from this record, Applicant was given sole custody in about 2010. Also,
after Applicant stopped working abroad, his income fell from about $140,000 overseas to
about $50,000 annually. Further compounding his financial problems was his employer’s
decision  to  include  his  per  diem  payments  as  reportable  income.  This  increased  his
annual  adjusted  gross  income  and,  accordingly,  his  federal  and  state  income  tax
obligations. (Answer; Tr. 37 – 38, 40)
Applicant first failed to file his tax returns in 2016 for the 2015 tax year because he
knew he would not have enough money to pay his tax bill. Thereafter, owing to a suddenly
more complicated personal life, a lower level of income, and his own inability to properly
file his returns, Applicant procrastinated in filing his tax returns for subsequent years and
his unfiled tax returns “snowballed” on him. Among other factors contributing to his failure
to  file  his returns  after 2015  were  his frequent  work  away  from  home; back  surgery  in
early 2017 for an injury he suffered in 2016 while helping a neighbor clear a fallen tree
after Hurricane Matthew; and another injury suffered in a car accident during one of his
TDY assignments in 2018. (Answer; GX 1; GX 3; Tr. 38 – 40)
In late 2019, around the same time Applicant submitted his most recent e-QIP, he
engaged a different tax specialist to resolve his late filings. That process was then delayed
several months in 2020 due to the COVID epidemic. Available information shows that all
of  his  federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  were  filed  between  February  2022  and
November 2022. Once his returns were filed, it was determined he still owed $12,847 in
federal income taxes. Part of the filing process included establishment of a repayment
plan  with  the  IRS  through  which  Applicant  has  resolved  his  federal  income  tax  debt.
(Answer; GX 1; GX 3; GX 4; AX E; AX I; Tr. 45 – 51, 53 – 60)
At  the  state  level,  a  levy  against  Applicant’s  wages  was  obtained  to  resolve  a
$21,229 tax debt for the 2012 and 2013 tax years. That debt resulted from the inaccurate
advice he received from the first income tax specialist he used while working overseas.
As of the SOR, that debt had been reduced to $12,847; as of his response thereto, it was
$8,192; and when he appeared at his hearing it had just been paid off. (Answer; GX 1;
GX 3; AX F; Tr. 37)
Applicant also accrued several past-due or delinquent medical bills due to his 2017
surgery  and  his  2018  car  accident.  He  presented  information  that  shows  he  paid  or
otherwise resolved the debts at SOR 1.e – 1.i. There is no information in the record about
the $2,976 medical debt at SOR 1.d other than its absence from the most recent credit
report in the record, dated March 1, 2022. The SOR 1.d creditor is the same as SOR 1.f
and  1.g,  and  Applicant  testified  the  SOR  1.d  debt  likely  was  satisfied  through  his
settlement of his other medical debts.  However, he was unable to definitively establish
that assertion. (Answer; AX A – C; Tr. 60 – 63)
Two other debts alleged at SOR 1.j and 1.k have been resolved. Those commercial
debts became delinquent as a result of the reductions in his income from the state tax
garnishment and his lower wages working in the United States. He settled the SOR 1.j
debt for about one-fourth of the original debt. The creditor for the $4,232 SOR 1.k debt
cancelled that debt and issued Applicant an IRS Form 1099-C, requiring him to declare
$3,641 as  income  on his 2020 federal income tax return.  His  2020  federal income tax
return shows that he declared that amount as required. (Answer; GX 6; Tr. 63 – 66)
Applicant’s current finances are sound. He has incurred no new unpaid debts and
lives within his means. Now that his state tax debt is resolved, he has about $583 more
in each paycheck. As a result, he has a positive net cash flow of at least $1,000 each
month, and will be able to avoid going into debt when unexpected expenses arise. He
intends to continue using his current tax specialist to prepare and file his federal and state
income taxes each year. He also provided letters of recommendation and copies of his
job performance appraisals and awards. Collectively, that information shows that he is a
hardworking, reliable, and professional employee, who is also a good father trying to meet
his family and community obligations to the best of his ability. (Answer; AX G. AX H; Tr.
