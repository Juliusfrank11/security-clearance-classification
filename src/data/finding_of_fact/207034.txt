once or twice a year. He used marijuana approximately 100 times from January 2006 to
December 2017. He also used cocaine, approximately five times, from December 2006

In approximately 2006, Applicant was arrested and charged with possession and
intent to distribute marijuana. This was his only drug-related offense. He was at a social
gathering,  and  he  went  with  a  friend  so  that  the  friend  could  obtain  marijuana  for
consumption at the gathering. The friend drove his car. He did not have marijuana on his
person, but the police officer found approximately an ounce of marijuana in his car. He
pled guilty to simple possession, received probation before judgment, and the charge was
subsequently  expunged.  He  discussed  this  incident  during  his  June  2019  background
interview,  and  he  stated  therein,  reiterated  in  his  Answer,  and  testified  that  he  did  not
disclose this arrest on his 2019 SCA due to oversight. He completed the SCA within two

In July 2006, Applicant completed an FD-316, or “Access of Non-FBI personnel to
FBI Facilities Background Data Information Form.” After he completed the  form, he was
arrested and charged with possession and intent to distribute marijuana, as discussed
above.  He  maintained  that  he  did  not  falsify  the  FD-316  form  because  he  had  not  yet
been arrested when he completed it. In September 2006, the FBI denied Applicant “. . .
access to FBI facilities, due to drug-related arrests that were not indicated”  on his July
2006  FD-316.  He  resubmitted  for  access  with  the  FBI  after  his  drug  charge  was
expunged, and the FBI granted him a clearance in 2008. (Answer; Tr. at 31-38, 44-45,
82-98, 117; GE 1, 3, 5-7)
Applicant indicated during his June 2019 background interview, reiterated in his
Answer, and testified that he did not disclose the FBI’s 2006 denial of his access to FBI
facilities  on  his  2019  SCA  due  to  oversight.  He  reiterated  that  he  completed  the  SCA
within two to three hours and he did not give it the appropriate attention that he should
have. He only remembered that his access to FBI facilities had been granted when he
completed the 2019 SCA and he forgot that it had been previously denied, as discussed
above. (Answer; Tr. at 31-38, 82-98, 117; GE 1, 3, 5-7)
Applicant first consumed alcohol in high school. In approximately 2012, Applicant
was arrested and charged with driving under the influence (DUI). This was his first DUI.
He stated that he consumed a beer at a hockey game and then went to a bar for dinner,
where he consumed another beer and a shot of liquor. He drove home, which was less
than a mile from the bar.  His blood alcohol content (BAC) was .11%.  The  charge  was
nolle  prosequi  and  he  received  six  weeks  of  court-ordered  alcohol  treatment.  He
discussed this DUI during his June 2019 background interview, and he indicated therein
that he did not disclose this DUI on his 2019 SCA because he mistakenly believed he
was not required to since it occurred more than seven years prior. He reiterated that he
completed  the  SCA  within  two  to  three  hours  and  he  did  not  give  it  the  appropriate
attention that he should have. (Tr. at 49-52, 82-85, 106-107, 113-114; GE 3, 4)
In approximately June 2014, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI. This

supervisor after attending his father’s memorial service. He consumed approximately four
double mixed drinks and drove home. His BAC was .16%. In October 2014, he pled guilty
to misdemeanor DUI and was sentenced to three days in jail and one year of probation.
He  was  ordered  to  complete  an  18-week  court-ordered  outpatient  alcohol  treatment
program and abstain from alcohol during his year of probation. He consumed alcohol on
one  occasion and  consequently failed  a  drug  test,  but then abided by the  court’s order
and successfully completed the program and probation. He disclosed this DUI on his 2019
SCA  and  discussed  it  during  his  June  2019  background  interview.  Since  this  DUI,  he
consumes only a couple of beers at home or when he is entertaining clients approximately
once monthly. (Tr. at 52-63, 82-85, 107-108; GE 1, 3, 4)
Applicant  last  used  marijuana  and  cocaine  in  2017.  He  reached  a  turning  point
after he lost his father and girlfriend in 2014 and 2017, respectively. His girlfriend of three
years, who was not a drug user, died of an accidental overdose after she snorted a pain
pill that, unbeknownst to her, contained fentanyl. She died in his home, and he witnessed
it.  He  stated  that  he  does  not  socialize  with  drug  users.  He  stated  that  his  previous
roommate, who he sees on occasion, no longer uses drugs. As of the date of the hearing,
his  seven-year-old  niece  and  his  brother,  who  previously  provided  him  with  and  used
illegal drugs, lived with him. He stated that his brother was two years clean and part of a
Narcotics  Anonymous  (NA)  program.  He  stated  that  he  has  no  future  intention  to  use
marijuana or other illegal drugs, and that if he were to find himself in a situation where
illegal drugs were being used, he would leave. He stated that he learned from the 2019
security  clearance  process  the  effect  that  any  criminal  involvement  would  have  on  his
career, and he was committed to not doing anything that would jeopardize it. (Answer; Tr.
