In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations with explanations.
His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is a  61-year-old  part-time  training coordinator employed by  a  defense
contractor since November 2008. He also works full time as a city firefighter. He has a
high-school education. He married in May 1988 and has one child. He has held a security
clearance since August 2006.
The SOR alleges that Applicant failed to file federal income tax returns as required
for tax year 2008 (SOR ¶ 1.a) and tax years 2009 through 2018 (SOR ¶ 1.b); and that he
failed to file state income tax returns as required for tax years, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015,
and 2017 (SOR ¶ 1.c). It also alleges that he owes about $18,645 in federal taxes for tax
years 2012, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2018, and 2019 (SOR ¶ 1.d).
Applicant testified that he has not had any income as a defense contractor since
COVID. As a city firefighter, he earns about $2,200 per month. (Tr. 16) He also works
intermittently  as  a  logistician  for  another  government  agency.  His  federal  income  tax
return for 2021 reflected total wages of $129,874. (AX E)
Applicant’s wife  is employed  as the  office manager for a dentist. Her pay varies
between $1,200 and $1,600 per month. (Tr. 57)
In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  stated  that  his  wife  handles  the  family
finances,  including  their  taxes.  He  was  unaware  that  his  wife  began  suffering  from
depression and had not filed their tax returns or paid the taxes due. His wife is now taking
medication  and  receiving  therapy.  She  testified  that  she  first  began  dealing  with
depression  when  her  mother  passed  away  in  1993.  She  was  able  to  control  her
depression until her father passed away in 2006. She testified that when she is frightened,
she stops functioning. After trying different medications, she stabilized around 2010 or
2011. (Tr. 60, 64)
Applicant’s  wife  testified  that,  in  2016  or  2017,  she  retained  someone  who
represented himself as a tax professional. About a year and a half ago, she found out that
this person had not taken the necessary steps to rectify their financial problems. (Tr. 63)
Applicant’s answer to  the  SOR  admitted failing to file federal income tax returns
for 2008 and 2009. He stated that he was unable to obtain tax information for tax years
2008 and 2009 because the IRS does not keep tax information for more than 10 years.
In  his  answer  to  DOHA  interrogatories  and  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  provided  the
