to possession of marijuana, a lesser-included misdemeanor offense. (Tr. 34) He claimed

(GE 3 at 27-31) Applicant said a police officer was harassing him, and the police officer
found a bottle with a marijuana stem in it under his vehicle’s seat. (Tr. 38, 40) When he
arrived  at the  police  station, “the  chief  of police” pleaded  with  Applicant not to  make  a
complaint against the [arresting] officer because he was in the process of being dismissed
as  a  result  of  the  police  officer’s  disorderly  conduct.  (Tr.  39)  Applicant  was  charged;
however, the  charges  were  eventually  dismissed.  (Tr.  39;  GE  3  at  31-32)  He  said  the

SOR  ¶  1.e  alleges  Applicant  was  arrested  on  January  29,  2011,  and  he  was
charged with possession of marijuana (less than 1 ounce). SOR ¶ 1.d alleges Applicant
failed to appear for a court date on September 16, 2011, and a warrant was issued for his
arrest. (GE 3 at 5-10) Applicant said he was in a vehicle with five other individuals, and
the police found marijuana in one of their bags. (Tr. 43) He said it was not his marijuana.
(Tr. 43) On November 4, 2019, an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator
interviewed Applicant about the warrant for his arrest, and Applicant said he did not intend
to resolve it until his child custody issues were resolved. (OPM Report of Investigation
(ROI) at 7) As of March 31, 2022, the charge was pending.
At Applicant‘s hearing,  he  said  he  recently paid $1,150 to  resolve the  charge. (Tr.

the hearing showing the charge was resolved; however, he did not provide anything. (Tr.
43)

charged with violation of a civil no contact order. (GE 3 at 33-34) Applicant said the charge
was dismissed because the civil no contact order did not exist. (Tr. 51-52)
SOR ¶¶  1.a  and  2.a  allege  Applicant was  arrested  on  July 22,  2019, following  a
multi-vehicle  collision,  and he  was charged  with  aggravated  DUI resulting  in great bodily
harm.  Applicant  said the  accident was not  his fault.  (Tr. 71) The  accident was at  about
10:46  p.m. (GE  4  at 19)  He said  he  only had  one  drink, and  that was about  4:45  p.m.
when   he   was  at  dinner.  (Tr.  71)  The   accident  occurred   at  about   10   p.m.  (Tr.  71)   One
report said he  had  a  breathalyzer which  registered  .075  (no  time  specified  in the  report);
however, his breathalyzer at 12:14 am  said .054. (Tr. 74, 86-87; GE  4 at 2, 18-19)
Applicant  said  they  tested  urine  samples  in  the  jail,  and  they  found  cocaine
metabolites in his urinalysis sample; however, he disagreed with this finding. (Tr. 76, 101)
He  was  taking  Adderall  for  ADHD,  and  it  was  not  detected  in  the  test.  (Tr.  76-77)  He
believed they switched his urine sample with one of the other prisoners. (Tr. 101) Forty-
eight hours after he was arrested, he had a blood test, which was negative for the cocaine
metabolite. (Tr. 103, 106) I asked Applicant to provide a copy of the blood test results
after his hearing; however, he did not provide them. (Tr. 116)
Applicant was arrested for failure to appear on March 6, 2023, and he was released
on March 13, 2023. (Tr. 79-80, 96) Applicant pleaded guilty to DUI in order to get released
from  jail.  (Tr.  82)  He  was  placed  on  probation  for  18  months.  (Tr.  109)  He  intends  to
appeal his conviction. (Tr. 82) He was unaware of the status of the civil lawsuit the woman
seriously injured in the accident filed against him. (Tr. 83; GE 5)
Applicant told the police officer he drank a double vodka at about 5:00 p.m., and
he said he had not smoked marijuana in the previous three days. (Tr. 86; GE 4 at 19)
The  woman  who  was  seriously  injured  in  the  accident  on  July  22,  2019,  was
pregnant. In her lawsuit, she seeks damages from Applicant in the amount of $50,000.
(GE 4) The lawsuit states Applicant was under the influence of alcohol and/or marijuana
at the time of the accident.
Applicant was arrested or served with papers in the summer of 2022 for not paying
his child support. (Tr. 60, 68) He said, “they put me in jail twice to pay child support in a
total amount of $9,000 one time, and then $6,000 the next time. So, that’s $15,000. So,
how could I possibly owe them anything?” (Tr. 59) The hearing is supposed to clarify the
amount  of  his  child  support  payments,  and  possibly  designate  who  should  take  the
deductions  for  the  children  for  income  tax  purposes.  (Tr.  59-62)  He  had  a  hearing
scheduled the last week of March 2023 concerning child support payments. (Tr. 58-59)
He believes his child support is current. (Tr. 60)
Personal Conduct-Falsification of SCA
SOR ¶¶ 4.b, 4.c, and 4.d allege Applicant failed to disclose on his April 23, 2020
SCA the conduct alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, and 3.b in response to questions
about felony charges, charges involving alcohol and illegal drugs, and involvement with
marijuana in the previous seven years.
In his April 23, 2020 SCA, Applicant disclosed: his 2017 or 2018 domestic violence
charges which was dismissed; his emergency order of protection in 2019 was denied; his
aggravated  DUI  charge  in  2019  was  pending;  and  he  was  accused  of  violation  of
parenting order or plan in 2020 (GE 1 at 32-39) He did not disclose any alcohol offenses
except  the  2019  DUI  or  any  drug  offenses  or  involvement  in  response  to  the  specific
questions about alcohol-related charges and drug involvement. (GE 1)
On November 4, 2019, Applicant confirmed to an OPM investigator that his only
arrest for or charge of DUI was in 2019, and he did not have any drug-related charges.
(OPM ROI at 6) He was confronted with and confirmed marijuana possession charges in
1995, 2003, and 2011. (Id. at 6-9; SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, and 1.i) He confirmed: his 1997 DUI
arrest and conviction in 2000, and his arrest in 1998, for obstruction of justice/destruction
of evidence. (OPM ROI at 8; SOR ¶¶ 1.g and 1.h) He indicated he used marijuana from
August 1986 to August 2019, and his average use was three or four times a month. (OPM
ROI at 9) He said he “has never tested  positive on  a  drug  test.”  (Id. at 10) He told the
OPM investigator that he believed he was only required to disclose marijuana offenses
and DUIs in the previous seven years. (Id. at 6-9) In his response to DOHA interrogatories
he  explained  the  urinalysis  test  result  showing  cocaine  metabolites  found  in  his  urine
sample  were  erroneous,  and  he  predicted  the  charges  would  be  removed  from  his
records. (GE 2 at 2)
At his hearing, Applicant said he  had  no  idea  he  was charged  with  the  felonies in
SOR ¶  1.g. (Tr. 89) He  misread  the  question  concerning  alcohol  and  drug  offenses.  (Tr.
90-91) He thought he  only had  to  disclose  the  offenses in the  last  seven  years. (Tr. 90-
91)
