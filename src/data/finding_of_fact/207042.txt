Applicant is a  48-year-old married  man  with  six children,  ranging  in  age  from  5  to
29. Two  previous  marriages  ended  in  divorce. (Item  1)  Applicant is  a  high  school graduate
and  a  veteran  of  the  U.S. Army, serving  initially from  April 1997  to  July 2000. After 9/11,
Applicant re-enlisted  and  served  from  October 2001  through  February 2004, (Item  3  at
25-28; 30-36) All  of  his  service  is  characterized as honorable.  (Item  3 at 12, 22-23)
In  1994,  Applicant  was  charged  with  “Hot  Check/Personal services,”  found  guilty,
and  sentenced  to  five  months  in prison, as alleged  in  SOR  subparagraph  1.a.  (Item  10  at
3) In  1999, Applicant was investigated  for the  offenses of forgery,  false  swearing,  larceny
of U.S. Mail,  and  larceny of  Government mail, as  alleged  in SOR subparagraph  1.b.  (Item
8  at 4) This investigation  was precipitated  after the  payee  was  issued  a  check,  but  did  not
receive it. She  contacted  the  maker of the  check, the  U.S.  Treasury.  Subsequently, the
U.S. Treasury placed  a  trace  on  the  check, which  revealed  that it  had  been  deposited  in
Applicant’s  account.   (Item   8   at  5)   Although   Applicant  denied   the   allegations  and   was
never  prosecuted,  an  investigation  concluded  that  there was probable  cause  establishing
all the  offenses. (Item  8 at 4)
Between 2002 and 2014, Applicant incurred approximately $9,500 of delinquent
debt,  including  two  judgments,  totaling  approximately  $7,800,  as  alleged  in  SOR
subparagraphs 1c. and 1.d, and a tax warrant, totaling approximately $2,700, as alleged
in  subparagraph  1.e.  In  2014,  Applicant  filed  for  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  protection,  as
alleged  in  SOR  subparagraph  1.f.  (Item  8)  Later  that  year,  the  court  discharged
approximately $48,000  in  delinquent  debt.  (Item  9  at 8)  The  judgment  alleged  in  SOR
subparagraph 1.d was discharged through the bankruptcy, and Applicant satisfied the tax
warrant in 2015. (Item 2 at 1) It is unclear from the record whether the judgment alleged
in SOR subparagraph 1.c was discharged in the 2014 bankruptcy.
Since the bankruptcy discharge, Applicant has incurred approximately $85,000 of
additional delinquent debt alleged in SOR subparagraphs 1.g through 1.m. These debts
include  subparagraph  1.g,  a  $29,632  child  support  delinquency,  subparagraph  1.h,  a
$14,682  medical  account,  delinquent  credit  card  accounts  totaling  $624,  as  alleged  in
subparagraphs  1i.  and  1.j,  and  three  automobile-related  debts,  totaling  approximately
$40,000, alleged in subparagraphs 1.k through 1.m.
The delinquent child support alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.g, is for his youngest
child who was born in 2016 after a brief extramarital relationship. Applicant did not know
that he had this child until the child’s mother informed him in 2020, and the delinquency
represents  unpaid  child  support  retroactive  to  the  child’s  birth.  (Item  15  at  2)  The
automobile-related debts consist of the deficiencies remaining from two repossessions in
2021, as alleged in subparagraphs 1.k and 1.l, and a delinquent car payment, as alleged
in subparagraph 1.m.  Applicant provided no evidence that he was satisfying any of the
SOR debts, or that he had made payment arrangements for any of the SOR debts. In his
answer, he stated that he “admit[s] [he] has not made sound financial decisions [sic] in
[his] life, but [his] commentment [sic] to this country has always stayed strong.” (Item 1 at
4)
