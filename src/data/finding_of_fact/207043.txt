From approximately 2009 to October 2020, Applicant worked as a 1099 employee
for  various  DOD  contractors  primarily  overseas.  He  was  twice  unemployed,  from  April
2015 to October 2015 and from July 2016 to June 2017. As of the date of the hearing and
since  October  2020,  he  has  worked  as  a  lab  manager  for  his  employer,  also  a  DOD
contractor, as a W-2 employee. He was first granted a security clearance in approximately
1992. (Answer; Tr. at 5-6, 15-24, 26-30, 59-60, 63, 69-71, 77-81; GE 1; AE P-T)
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  had  four  delinquent  student  loans  totaling
approximately  $84,221  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.b,  1.g,  1.i)  and  six  delinquent  consumer  debts
totaling  approximately  $129,849  (SOR  ¶¶  1.c-1.f,  1.h,  1.j).  The  SOR  allegations  are
established by Applicant’s admissions in his Answer; his March 2021 security clearance
application (SCA); his June 2021 background interview; and three credit bureau reports
from 2021 and 2022. (Answer; GE 1-5)
Applicant  attributed   his
financial  difficulties   primarily
to   his   periods  of
unemployment. When  he  became  re-employed  in  October 2015  after his first  period  of
unemployment,  his annual income  was  reduced  from  $325,000  to  $160,000. He  also  cited
to    his father’s significant and    costly health    issues in 2016, for which    he    assisted  financially.
He  also  financially  contributed     to     his  daughter’s  expenses,  to     include     her  educational
costs.  He acknowledged  that he  financially contributed  approximately $100,000  between
2009  and  2014  to  his then-girlfriend. He  began  to  tackle  his financial delinquencies, which
included  several debts  that  were  not alleged  in the  SOR,  once  he  secured  employment
in June 2017. He hired an  attorney in April 2019  to assist him. He noted  that the COVID-
19 pandemic delayed his attempts  with  his creditors to  resolve  his debts.  (Answer;  Tr. at
25-31, 35-36, 39-40, 46-47, 56, 58, 70-77, 86-92, 102-103, 115-131; GE  1; AE  H,  S, BB,

Applicant’s four student loans are as follows: SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b are two private
student loans with the same creditor charged off for a total of $16,358; SOR ¶ 1.g is a
$53,875 charged-off student loan; and SOR ¶ 1.i is a $13,983 student loan account in
collection.  Applicant  obtained  the  loans  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b  in  2005  to  pay  for  his
undergraduate education, and he obtained the loans in SOR ¶¶ 1.g and 1.i in 2008 and
2016, respectively, to pay for his graduate education. He stated that he timely paid SOR
¶¶  1.a  and  1.b  until  his  first  period  of  unemployment  in  2015.  In  2016,  he  applied  for
deferment for SOR ¶ 1.g but was unsuccessful because the loan had been returned to
the  lender due to non-payment.  He thought he brought all his student  loans current  in
2017, to include entering a $500 monthly payment plan for SOR ¶ 1.i, but he learned in
2019 that SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b were not included in his student loan repayment plan. He
paid SOR ¶ 1.i, in accordance with his payment plan, in June 2019. He stated that the
creditor for SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b was unwilling to work with him when he contacted it in
2019, and then the COVID-19 pandemic hampered his ability to work with the creditor to
resolve these loans. In August 2022, he wrote a letter to the three major credit bureaus
to verify SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 1.g but stated that he had not received a response. His
attorney was assisting him with resolving SOR ¶ 1.g. He intends to establish a repayment
plan to resolve them. (Answer; Tr. at 26-37, 43-47, 51-58, 90-92, 94-101, 107, 112; GE

Five of Applicant’s six delinquent consumer debts are credit cards:    SOR ¶ 1.c  is a
$23,689   credit  card   in   collection,  and   SOR  ¶¶   1.d,  1.e,  1.f,  and  1.h   are   credit  cards
charged   off   in  the   amounts  of   $21,838,  $26,441,  $28,954,  and   $21,167,  respectively.
Applicant  used   these   credit  cards  for  living   expenses   while  working   overseas   in
approximately 2014  to  2016.  As a  1099  employee, he  would use  his credit cards for four-
to-six-month  periods  while  he  was  not being  paid,  and  he  then  would  pay his credit  card
balances once  he  was paid.  His periods of unemployment affected  his ability to  repay his
credit  cards.  He   also   acknowledged   that   he   used   his   credit   cards   to  provide   his   then-
girlfriend  with  financial  assistance, as previously discussed. (Answer; Tr. at 37-51, 55-56,
89-92, 101-112; GE 1-4; AE C, D, E, F, J, CC)
Applicant maintained that SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.h were duplicate accounts. He stated
that when he contacted the credit card company underlying both debts in approximately
2017,  the  company  told  him  that  the  debt  was  purchased  by  a  third-party  collection
agency. The credit reports list both debts with different account numbers aside from the
last four digits, which are identical. SOR ¶ 1.c is reported on all the credit reports. Although
SOR ¶ 1.h is reported with a zero balance on the latest credit reports from October 2021
and November 2022, it remains listed as a $21,167 charged-off account. He stated that
his attorney was assisting him with resolving this debt, and he sent a letter to the collection
agency in approximately April 2022 directing all communication to his attorney. He intends
to resolve this debt once he has verified it. (Answer; Tr. at 37-41, 43-46, 48-49, 55-56,
89-92, 101-110; GE 1-4; AE C, J, CC)
Applicant  stated  that  he  contacted  the  creditors  for  SOR  ¶¶  1.d,  1.e,  and  1.f  in
approximately  2017  to  2019,  and  the  creditors  were  unwilling  to  work  with  him  on  a
payment plan. He stated that his attorney was assisting him with resolving SOR ¶¶ 1.e
and and 1.f, and he wrote a letter in August 2022  to the three major credit bureaus to
verify  them.  In  November 2022,  he  was  exploring  with his  attorney  options  for settling
SOR  ¶  1.f.  The  November  2022  credit  bureau  reports  reflect  that  SOR  ¶  1.d  is  paid.
(Answer; Tr. at 41-51, 90-92, 110-112; GE 1-4; AE D, E, F, J)
SOR ¶ 1.j is a $7,760 insurance account in collection. Applicant was unaware of
this debt. At his attorney’s advice, he contacted the creditor to validate this debt. He stated
that after doing so, the debt was removed from his credit report.  He believed this debt
was associated with SOR ¶ 1.i because he stated that they were both removed from his
credit report around the same time. (Answer; Tr. at 58-59, 92-94, 126; GE 1, 2; AE Z, AA)
As  of  the  date  of  the  hearing,  Applicant’s  annual  income  was  $150,000.  His
monthly  net  income  was  approximately  $9,415  and  his  monthly  net  remainder,  after
$5,063 in expenses, was approximately $2,500. He had $86,000 in his savings account,
and he expected a federal income tax refund of $15,376 for tax year 2021. He does not
have any other delinquent debts. His November 2022 credit bureau report reflects a fair
credit score. He received online credit counseling in 2022 and he developed a budget.
He  intends  to  resolve  his  delinquent  debts.  He  traveled  for  tourism  in  2014  to  India,
Thailand, and the Philippines; in 2015 to the Philippines; in 2018 to the UAE; and in 2022
to Paris. (Answer; Tr. at 37, 59-68, 78-86, 112-115, 127-131; GE 1; AE J, K, L, M, N, O,

Five individuals attested to Applicant’s trustworthiness, reliability, and judgment. In
January 2022, Applicant’s  supervisor of one year  praised Applicant’s performance and
dedication to the mission. Another individual, a technical lead for the same company who
worked  extensively  with  Applicant  daily  since  2020,  noted  Applicant’s  exemplary
professionalism for which he received an award in 2021. Two individuals, one who was
Applicant’s  colleague  and  supervisor  between  approximately  2009  and  2013  and  the
other  who  was  Applicant’s  immediate  supervisor  from  approximately  2017  to  2020,
highlighted Applicant’s skills, patience, and ability to work under pressure. Applicant also
received a star performer certificate between approximately 2020 and  2022. (Answer; Tr.
