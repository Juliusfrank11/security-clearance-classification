Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.s, 1.t, 2.a through 2.d, and 3.a
through 3.c. He denied SOR ¶¶ 1.c through 1.r, 1.u through 1.z, 2.e and 2.f. He failed to
respond  to  SOR  ¶  3.d and  it  will be  considered  a  denial.  After a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant is 40 years old. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2007. He returned to
college  in  2013  and  completed  a  master’s  degree  in  2020.  He  married  in  2007  and
divorced in 2016. He has two children, ages 16 and 11, from the marriage. He remarried
in 2018 and has no children from the marriage. He has a 22-year child from a previous
relationship  and  an  8-year-old  child  from  another  previous  relationship.  Applicant  was
commissioned in the military in 2008 and served until his honorable discharge in 2015 in
the rank of O-3. He had combat deployments in 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2014. He has a
1 Applicant’s 2018 tax year return was not due until April 2019. I have amended  SOR ¶  3.e  to replace
“2018” with “2017.”
Veterans  Affairs  (VA)  disability  rating  of  100%,  which  includes  post-traumatic  stress
disorder  (PTSD)  among  other  issues.  Applicant  had  no  significant  periods  of
unemployment and has worked for federal contractors since his military discharge.  (Tr.
15, 21-31)
Applicant’s  admissions  in  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  statements  to  a  government
investigator, testimony, credit reports, criminal records, and documents from the military
corroborate the SOR allegations. (GE 1-14)
The  SOR alleges,  in  SOR ¶¶  1.e  through  1.q,  that  Applicant  has  delinquent student
loans.  SOR  ¶   1.r  is  a   garnishment  by   the   Department   of   Treasury  on   behalf   of  the
Department   of  Education   for  his   student   loans.  Applicant  obtained   these   loans   for  his
undergraduate  education. He said they were  deferred  when  he  was deployed. He said  he
made  some  payments  but could  not recall  any specifics.  He testified  that because  he  is
a   100% disabled   veteran,  his delinquent  student  loans  were   discharged   and   resolved,
and  he  was  not  required  to  repay  them.  He provided  a  document confirming  they  were
discharged.  He  testified   he   applied   for  the   loans  to   be   forgiven   in  approximately
September 2021  and received  notification it was approved in January 2022. The  student
loans alleged  in  SOR ¶¶ 1.e  through  1.q  are  resolved  in his favor. (Tr. 16, 31-36, 119-
126; AE  A)
SOR  ¶¶  1.b  ($17,329)  and  1.s  ($11,030)  are  debts  for  delinquent  child  support
payments. Applicant testified that he was paying his child support payments for his two
children with his ex-wife through an automatic withdrawal from his paycheck. Applicant
was unaware that when he changed jobs in 2017, the automatic payment stopped. When
he became aware, he paid his child support through an electronic cash application directly
to his ex-wife, and he did not receive payment credit by the state administering the child
support.  His  ex-wife  testified  and  confirmed  that  she  received  the  cash  payments.
Applicant testified that he contacted the state in 2021 or 2022 and was given credit for
the  arrearages  on  this  account.  When  he  accepted  a  new  job,  he  set  up  automatic
payments from his pay for child support that goes to the state and then it is sent to his ex-
wife. He has resolved SOR ¶ 1.b. (Tr. 36-44, 158-162)
The child support arrearage in SOR ¶ 1.s is for his youngest child and happened
under the same  circumstances. The  same state  manages this  child  support.  Applicant
testified  that  when  he  changed  jobs,  he  made  payments  through  an  electronic  cash
application. He said that the mother is uncooperative in acknowledging she received the
payments, and she refuses to turn in the required papers to the state to confirm Applicant
made  the  cash  payments  to  her.  Applicant  testified  that  he  would  provide  the  cash
receipts  to  show  he  made  the  payments.  He  testified  that  he  would  also  provide  a
document from the state, which would show any balance owed. He did not provide these
documents. His March 2023 credit bureau report reflects a balance of $13,533 owed. This
debt is not resolved. (Tr. 44-46, 130-134; GE 14)
The SOR alleged in ¶ 1.z ($7,179) that the Department of Treasury was garnishing
his  wages  on  behalf  of  the  government  creditor  for  reimbursement  for  lost  equipment
while he was serving in the military. It is unclear if the garnishment was completed. He
testified  there  was  an  investigation  into  the  missing  items,  which  were  found,  and  he
received a letter telling him the debts were resolved.  His October 2018, October 2019,
January 2021, and August 2021 credit reports reflect the debt. It is not reported on his
March 2023 credit report. He failed to provide a copy of the letter. Since his wages were
being garnished, I have given Applicant the benefit of the doubt and SOR ¶ 1.z is resolved
in his favor. (Tr. 46-51, 53-55, 126-130; GE 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 14)
Applicant testified that the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a ($86), 1.u ($215), and 1.v
($790) are all medical accounts that  should have been paid by the  VA because  of  his
disability. I am unable to make that determination based only on Applicant’s testimony.
Applicant did not provide any documents to show he disputed  or resolved these debts.
(Tr. 52-53)
Applicant  testified  that  he  paid  the  cell  phone  account  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.x
($1,330). He did not provide documented proof. SOR ¶ 1.t ($499) is a collection account
for a payday loan and SOR ¶ 1.w is a delinquent credit card account ($576). No proof
was provided to show these debts have been paid. (Tr. 52, 134)
During his hearing, Applicant was asked by the Government if he had filed his past
income  tax  returns.  He  testified  that  he  did  not  file  federal or  state  income  tax  returns
since 2015. He testified that for tax year 2015, he forgot to file his returns and then he
kept telling himself he would file and each subsequent year he did not. He testified that
he received a notice from the IRS about his delinquent taxes, but he could not recall the
year. He said when he returned from deployment, he did not file his 2015 tax return, and
he was dealing with the death of his father in March 2016. Every year he would receive
his W-2 income tax form from his employer, and he knew he had to file his returns but did
not. He admitted he was neglectful and did not file his federal and state income tax returns
for  tax  years  2015  to  the  present.  In  his  post-hearing  submissions,  Applicant  did  not
provide any documents to show he has filed any of the delinquent income tax returns.
(SOR ¶ 1.aa) (Tr. 144-151, 154)
Based on Applicant’s testimony that he was aware he had not filed his federal or
state income tax returns beginning in 2015, I find he deliberately failed to disclose this
information as required on his SCA. He admitted at his hearing that he lied on his SCA
when he failed to disclose that he had not filed his tax returns. (Tr. 146-147; GE 1)
Applicant  was  apprehended  by military police  in  August  2012  and suspected  of
assault consummated by a battery and spouse abuse after a mutual confrontation with
his then-wife. Applicant testified that there was mutual pushing and shoving between him
and his then-wife. He was ordered to participate in counseling with the base chaplain. He
and his then-wife participated together for a time and then she stopped. He then went by
himself. He  estimated the  entire  counseling was  for about  six to  seven months. There
was no disciplinary action. (SOR ¶ 2.a) (Tr. 55-56, 79-84; GE 6, 7)
In January 2013, Applicant was arrested for grand larceny, a felony.  He went to
court multiple times and was represented by an attorney. The charge was later reduced
to a misdemeanor. He pleaded guilty to petit larceny and was sentenced to 12 months
confinement (11 months and 10 days were suspended) and ordered to pay court costs.
Applicant testified he believed his then-wife was cheating on him. He went to the man’s
workplace and called a number he retrieved from his then-wife’s phone that belonged to
the man. When the man answered, it confirmed to Applicant that this was the man. When
the man was not looking, Applicant took his phone. He was later arrested. He received a
letter of reprimand from his command. (SOR ¶ 2.b) (Tr. 57-59, 84-93; GE 9)
In  July 2016, while working  overseas, Applicant was accused  of sexual assault  and
abusive sexual contact  on  a  foreign  national. He denies the  accusations. He was  returned
to  the  United  States.  An  investigation  ensued.  Applicant was not arrested  or charged. The
U.S.  Attorney  declined   to   prosecute.   However,  his  company  learned   through   the
investigation   that alcohol was   involved,   and  it  was during   the   work   week,   so   Applicant
was terminated. (SOR ¶ 2.c) (Tr. 59-61, 93-98; GE 8)
In  July  2017,  Applicant  was  arrested  for  driving  while  intoxicated  (DWI).  He
admitted he was over the legal limit but could not recall the breathalyzer reading. He could
not recall how many drinks he had, but indicated it was a significant amount. Applicant
was  represented  by  an  attorney.  In  October  2017,  he  pleaded  guilty  to  DWI  and  was
sentenced to 30 days confinement (all suspended), 36 months of unsupervised probation,
fined $250 and ordered to pay court costs of $349. His driver’s license was suspended
for a year. (SOR ¶ 2.d) (Tr. 61-64, 98-101; GE 10)
Applicant was arrested in July 2017 for driving with a suspended license. Applicant
testified that the charge was dismissed when he showed the judge that his license was
valid. Court records reflect the charge was nolle prosequi. (SOR ¶ 2.e) (Tr. 61-64; GE 11)
In September 2018, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA).
In response to Section 22, which asked about his police record and specifically if he had
been arrested, charged, convicted, or sentenced for a crime in the last seven years; had
he ever been  charged with  a felony;  and  had  he  EVER been charged with  an offense
involving drugs or alcohol, Applicant answered “No.” He did not disclose his felony arrest,
misdemeanor conviction for petit larceny, or DWI. (SOR ¶ 3.a) (GE 1)
Section  26  of  the  SCA  asked  Applicant  if  he  had  in  the  last  seven  years  been
delinquent  on  his  child  support,  any  federal  debt,  or  a  judgment  entered  against  him.
Applicant answered “No.” He did not disclose two delinquent child support accounts and
his delinquent student loans. (SOR ¶ 3.b) (GE 1)
Section 26 of the SCA asked if Applicant had defaulted on any loan; had any bills
turned over to a collection agency; had any account or credit card charged off, suspended
or canceled for failing to pay as agree; or if he had been over 120 days delinquent on any
debt.  He  answered  “No.”  Applicant  did  not  disclose  any  of  his  delinquent  debts  or
delinquent payday loan. (GE 1)
Section 26 of the SCA asked if in the last seven years Applicant failed to file or pay
federal, state, or other taxes when required by law or ordinance? He answered “No” to
this question, and thereby deliberately failed to disclose that he failed to file his federal
and state income tax returns from 2015 to 2017. (GE 1)
In March 2019, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. He was
asked  why  he  failed  to  disclose  his  delinquent  student  loans,  child  support,  and  other
delinquent debts. Applicant said he did not know how his student loans were broken down
into different accounts. At the time he was interviewed, his loans had not yet been forgiven
and  were  delinquent.  He  told  the  government  investigator  that  after  Hurricane  Katrina
(2005) his student loans were broken into smaller accounts. He was unaware the loans
had  been  reorganized  until  he  received  calls  and  notices  from  the  creditors  about  the
accounts. He did not have the information for each account, so he did not disclose them.
He said he was on a payment plan and was to pay $140 a month for nine months. The
investigator  gave  him  an  opportunity  to  provide  substantiating  documents.  He  did  not.
Post-hearing, he provided emails from 2013 and 2015 to the creditor requesting his loans
be deferred because he was in the military. His email stated that his military obligation
ended  in  April  2020.  He  was  discharged  in  2015.  His  request  was  processed,  and  it
appears the loans were deferred. However, he did not provide additional documents to
reflect if he took any action on the loans after his discharge until the loans were forgiven
in 2022. (Tr. 77-78; GE 13; AE C)
Applicant did not disclose the medical debts alleged in the SOR because he said
they were to be paid by the VA. He said he would contact the VA and resolve the debts.
He said he thought his other debts were paid, and he was unaware that other accounts
were in collection. He also explained that he disagreed with some of the debts, and he
was  in  the  process  of  disputing  and  resolving  them.  He  said  that  he  interpreted  the
question incorrectly. (GE 13)
I  find  Applicant  was  aware  he  had  student  loans  that  were  delinquent  and
deliberately failed to disclose them (SOR ¶¶ 1.e through 1.q). I find that Applicant likely
did not deliberately fail to disclose his medical debts if he believed they should be paid by
the VA (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.u and 1.v). I also find that he did not deliberately fail to disclose
his delinquent child support because he believed he was paying it (SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.s)
but not receiving credit. I also find he did not deliberately fail to disclose the remaining
debts that he thought were paid. My findings are limited to whether he deliberately failed
to disclose these debts and not to whether he is responsible for paying them. (Tr. 78-79;
GE 13)
Applicant told the investigator that he attributed his financial problems to his child
support  obligations  that  were  to  be modified  in  April  2019.  He  was  uncertain  when  he
would be able to pay his delinquent debts. (GE 13)
Applicant was given an opportunity by the investigator to volunteer if he had any
alcohol-related charges against him in the past, and he told the investigator he did not. At
his hearing, Applicant denied this and said he told the government investigator about his
DWI. He explained to the investigator the circumstances surrounding the DWI. Applicant
claimed his failure to disclose the DWI conviction on his SCA was an oversight. At his
hearing, he said he did not know why he failed to disclose his DWI. He said he thought it
was  an  application  that  would  go  back  to  his  employer,  and  he  could  explain  it  to  his
employer.  He  said  that  he  had  reported  it  to  his  facility  security  officer.  I  did  not  find
Applicant credible. His DWI conviction was less than two years before he completed his
SCA. I find he deliberately failed to disclose his DWI conviction on his SCA. (Tr. 72-77,
146-147; GE 1, 13)
Applicant testified that he did not know why he failed to disclose any of his other
criminal charges. He said he thought he could explain himself to his employer. Applicant
was  charged  with  grand  larceny,  a  felony.  He  pleaded  guilty  to  a  misdemeanor  and
received  12  months  in  jail.  Some  of  his  jail  sentence  was  suspended  but  not  all,  and
Applicant  served  time  in  jail.  I  did  not  find  him  credible.  I  find  he  deliberately  failed  to
disclose his criminal conduct. (Tr. 72-79; GE 13)
In March 2021 Applicant was arrested and charged with domestic violence third
degree-harassment,  after  he  had  an  altercation  with  his  wife  and  his  stepdaughter’s
boyfriend. He was unhappy with the boyfriend because when he went inside Applicant’s
house, the boyfriend did not speak. When Applicant addressed him, the boyfriend said
something sassy. Applicant threw a chair across the room, which hit a table that had beer
on it, and it splashed on some people. He admitted he had been drinking but said he was
not intoxicated. The police were called. He was taken to a hotel and separated from the
situation. He said he could not get a hotel room, so he went back to his house. He began
arguing  with  his  then-wife  and  the  police  came  again,  and  he  was  arrested.  Applicant
went to anger management classes and completed them in March 2022. The charge was
dismissed. (SOR ¶ 2.f) (Tr. 64-67, 101-113; GE 12)
Applicant testified that he accepts responsibility for anger issues that are related
to his PTSD. He has taken financial management classes to help him budget. He has a
written  budget  but  did  not  provide  it.  He  has  been  seeing  a  mental  health  practitioner
since 2022, and the last time he spoke with her was December 2022. He takes medication
to help him. He testified that he participated in a substance abuse program through the
VA that lasted 18 months. He stopped drinking alcohol in January 2023. He and his ex-
wife  have  reconciled  to  be  good  parents  for  their  children.  He  attributed  his  criminal
conduct to issues with his ex-wife. He volunteers at the American Legion and Wounded
Warriors. (Tr. 16, 67-69, 113-119, 137-138)
