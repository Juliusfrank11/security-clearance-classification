Applicant admitted, SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b, alleging delinquent student loans totaling
$31,778. She denied SOR ¶ 1.c, a  delinquent telecommunications account, on the basis
that she had resolved the debt.
Applicant is 46 years old. She was married from 1996 to 2001 and has two adult
children  who  are  twins.  She  earned  her  bachelor’s  degree  in  2008  and  her  master’s
degree in 2010. (Tr. at 27.) Between 2014 and 2015 she studied part-time for a certificate
but did not receive it. (Tr. at 29.) She has been employed full-time since 2008. According
to her security clearance application she has worked for her security clearance sponsor
since 2010 and was previously investigated for a security clearance in 2004. (GE 1 at 15,
48 and Tr. at 29-31.)
Applicant elected to go into default in order to qualify for credit repair programs.
She was supporting her two children. (GE 1 at 23.) She wanted to ensure that her children
did not end up in debt. One child graduated from college and the other is fully employed
in a trade. Her children did not qualify as full dependents, because her children lived in
another state. She provided documentation showing her income between 2015 and 2021.
Her annual income in 2015 was $50,126. (AE A.) Her wages from her employer in 2018
were over $67,000. (AE B.) Her total wages in 2021 were $84,721. (AE C.) She is now
making over $100,000. (Tr. 72.)
Applicant resided  in a  home  she  owned  from  2009  until 2014, when  she  moved  to
a  new state. She  moved  again after a  year to  the  state  she  now resides. She  moved  to
her current location  in 2020, in hopes of earning  a  salary that would  enable  her to  cover
her  student loan  payments. (GE 1  at 9-11.) Her  $88,000  salary was insufficient for the
metro  area  she  was living  in.  She  found  herself choosing  between  paying  her  rent, food
expenses,  and  commuting  costs  or paying  $700  in  student  loan debt  each month.  (Tr. at
20.)  To  improve  her financial situation, she  started  a  cleaning  business in 2021. The  start-
up  expenses  to  buy the  franchise  required  her to  put $2,000  down,  and  then  finance  the
remainder. The finance costs are covered in the  monthly income that business brings in.
The  first year was not profitable. (Tr. at  61,  77-81.)  Between her salary and  her cleaning
business  income,   Applicant  makes  approximately  $6,200   a   month.  She   maintains  a
“loose  budget.” (Tr at  62-67, 72.) With  a  recent raise  she  has roughly $2,000  left over
after expenses. (Tr. at 72.)
SOR ¶¶  1.a-b: two  education loans  placed for collection in the  amounts  of
$19,873  and $11,905. The  delinquent student  loans  were  assigned  to  collection  in  August
2014 and August 2015. (GE 3 at 2.) In Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, she admitted the
debts. In her Answer she stated these debts were covered by the “CARES ACT of 2020”
which negated the SOR allegations. She testified her loans went into default right at the
time that the pandemic occurred. (Tr at 21.) She states this is “when the President came
and put student loans on forbearance and froze. So I am not in default at this time.” (Tr.
at 21.) She added her student loans did not need to be repaid until this past year and that
she has made steps to mitigate and to be prepared to pay when the freeze is lifted. (Tr at
21.) She stated she was applying for another program that  would wipe away her debt,
because under her master's degree, she had been told that her degree was going to make
some money for her. (Tr. at 31.) She stated she pursued the additional certificate because
it was her understanding repayment of the loans could be deferred while attending school
even part-time. She acknowledged she did not have any documentation to support this
testimony. (Tr. at 33.)
In   her  post  hearing   narrative,  she   stated   had   made   payments  towards  the   debt
prior to   the   student  loan   repayment   freeze   citing   two   Department   of  Education   (DoEd)
Student  Loan  Interest  Statements  she  had  included  in  her  post hearing  submission. (AE
D and  AE  E.) The  statement for calendar year  2019  shows she  paid  $6,476.07  in interest
and  the  statement for calendar year  2020  show she  paid $1,767.28  in  interest.  (AE  D  and
AE E.)  She  stated  these  exhibits  rebutted  the  narrative  painted  by the  Government  that
she had  neglected  her  responsibilities. (AE J at 1.)
I have  taken   administrative  notice  that in  March  2020,  as a  result  of  the  COVID-
19  pandemic, the  President  directed  the  DoEd  to  provide  the  following  temporary relief
on DoEd  owned  federal student  loans: suspension  of loan  payments,  stopped  collections
on   defaulted   loans,  and   a   0%  interest   rate.   On   March   27,   2020,   the   Coronavirus   Aid,
Relief, and  Economic Security Act  (CARES  Act) provided  for the  above  relief measures
through  September 30, 2020. See  Federal Student Aid (FSA) website, ISCR  Case  No.
20-02787 at 3  n.1 (App. Bd. Mar. 2022). This  student loan debt relief has been  extended
several times. See https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19.
After the SOR was issued she applied for the one-time student loan debt relief plan
announced by the President on August 24, 2022. The DoEd issued an email to her on
November 19, 2022, stating she had been approved for the program. (AE F.) A week prior
to the hearing she “stumbled” upon an article about the Fresh Start Program and applied.
(Tr.  at  81.)  The  DoEd  issued  a  letter  on  May  16,  2023,  the  same  day  as  the  hearing,
reiterating  that  her  delinquent  student  loans  would  soon  be  transferred  to  a  new  loan
servicer and  will no  longer be  in  default.  Once  the payment  pause ends  her  new loan
servicer  would  send  her  a  monthly  bill  and  she  would  be  required  to  make  monthly
payments. (AE G.) According to the letter, because these loans became delinquent more
than seven years ago the new loan servicer will not report the new status of the loans to
credit reporting agencies. (GE 3 at 2 and AE G.)
Since  her student  loans  were  assigned  for  collection,  she  traveled  to  Europe  in
2020, Canada in 2018, a Caribbean island in 2017, Africa in 2015, Mexico in 2015, and
a  Caribbean island  in 2014.  (GE 1 at 32-40 and  Tr. 69-70.) She  used  a loan  from her
401K  to  fund  her 2015  trip. One  of  the  trips was a  cruise  with  her adult children  that she
paid  for out-of-pocket  on  a  monthly payment plan. The  flights for the  other trips  were  gifted
to  her,  and  the  remaining  expenses were split with  her traveling  companion. (Tr. at 74-
75.)
SOR ¶ 1.c: telecommunication account placed for collection in the amount
of $211. Applicant denied the allegation on basis she had “…a zero-dollar balance on the
old account and [her] account is current.” Her Answer included an email from the company
stating, “Thanks for being our customer. Upon clearance of the payment, this account will
be considered paid in full.” She explained the delinquency was caused by equipment she
turned in prior to her move that was not scanned properly by the staff, so it was marked
as not being received and she was not aware of the problem until the security clearance
process. One week after the hearing the company issued an email to her stating they had
received her notification of dispute and reviewed the information she had provided. The
company determined the account had been satisfied. (AE I.)
