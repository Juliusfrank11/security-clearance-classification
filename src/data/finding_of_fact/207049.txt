Applicant is 44 years old and married for the third time. He has two children from
his  first  two  marriages.  He  has  a  bachelor’s  degree  and  is  employed  by  a  defense
contractor as a Manager Network Services. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 13A, 17,
and 18; Applicant Exhibit J; Tr. 7, 37, 39-40.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations)
The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  has  failed  to  meet  his  financial  obligations  and  is  therefore  potentially
unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.
Specifically,  the  Government  alleged  in  the  SOR  that  Applicant  had  not  filed  his  2014
through 2016 Federal (allegation 1.a,) and State A (allegation 1.b.) tax returns as of the
date of the SOR, May 20, 2022. He denied allegation 1.a. and admitted allegation 1.b. He
also submitted additional information to support the granting of national security eligibility.
Applicant’s tax problems began in 2014 when his second wife left the country with
their  young  son  and  returned  to  her  country  of  residence.  The  following  acrimonious
divorce was finally resolved in 2017. He became bitter and depressed over the situation.
He stated, “I just sort of gave up, and I paid my taxes through my deductions, through my
employer, every year. So, I felt that I was doing my duty, as a Citizen, to pay my taxes.
So, I was not avoiding taxes.” He has now filed all of the subject Federal tax returns, and
fully resolved State A tax issues, as described below. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section
17; Exhibit 3 at 1; Tr. 19, 22-23.)
1.a  Turning  to the specific tax years at issue  with the IRS:
Applicant filed his 2014 Federal tax return in February 2022. As prepared, he was
due a refund in the amount of $1,491. He did not sign the return and the IRS returned the
document to him for signature on October 6, 2022. He signed the form and returned it to
the IRS immediately. IRS records dated November 28, 2022, show that Applicant’s 2014
Federal tax return was “secured” on November 22, 2022. (Applicant Answer Attachment
1; Applicant Exhibits A and N; Tr. 25, 27-35.)
Applicant filed his 2015 Federal tax return in February 2022. As prepared, he was
due a refund in the amount of $1,674. The IRS informed him that he had not signed this
return either. He signed the form and returned it to the IRS along with the 2014 return in
October  2022.  IRS  records  dated  November  28,  2022,  show  that  Applicant’s  2015
Federal tax return was “secured” on November 22, 2022. (Applicant Answer Attachment
2; Applicant Exhibit L; Tr. 25, 27-35.)
Applicant filed his 2016 Federal tax return in February 2022. As prepared, he was
due a refund in the amount of $1,215. He testified that he did not sign this return either
and anticipated that it would also be returned by the IRS. He signed the form and returned
it to the IRS along with his 2014 and 2015 tax returns in October 2022. IRS records dated
November  28,  2022,  show  that  Applicant’s  2016  Federal  tax  return  was  “secured”  on
November 22, 2022. (Applicant Answer Attachment 3; Applicant Exhibit M; Tr. 25, 27-35.)
Applicant has filed all of his Federal income tax returns in a timely fashion starting
in tax year 2017. This is supported by IRS account transcripts for tax years 2017 through
2021. (Applicant Exhibit C; Tr. 25-26, 36.)
1.b. Applicant has resolved  his State  A  2014  through  2016  tax liability through  a
garnishment issued by State  A  in approximately 2018. Tax records from  State A’s taxing
authority dated  February 14, 2022, indicate  that Applicant has no balance owed to  State
A  for tax years 2014 through 2020. In fact, he has a credit balance for the 2016 tax year.
He moved  from  State  A  in 2020. (Government Exhibit 2  at 15-16; Exhibit 3  at 2; Tr. 19-
22, 25, 29, 35-36, 45.)
MITIGATION
Applicant submitted his employee evaluations for years 2016 through 2021.  The
evaluations  show  him  to  be  an  excellent  employee  who  exceeds  expectations.  He  is
valued by management and respected by the people he supervises. (Applicant Exhibits
D through J.)
