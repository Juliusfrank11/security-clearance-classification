of the U.S. Navy, serving from 1992 to 2002. Her discharge was honorable. (Item 3 at 25)
Applicant earned some college credits after graduating from high school. (Item 3 at 14)
Over the years, she has earned several vocational education certificates in the field of
telecommunications engineering. (Item 3 at 13-14) She has spent her career working for
various defense contractors as a system administrator. (Item 3 at 17-22) She has held a

Applicant   and   her  then   husband   periodically   struggled   with   their   finances  in  the
early 2000s,  through  bouts of her then-husband’s unemployment.  (Item  13  at 39-42) In
2007, their  periodic struggles intensified  after her then  husband  became  seriously ill, and
subsequently,  addicted  to  painkillers after multiple  surgeries. (Reply at 1) He  lost  his job
in  2007   and   never  worked   again  for  the   remainder  of  their   marriage,   which   ended   in
October 2020  after a  five-year separation.  (Reply at  1) Dependent on  both  incomes  to
make  ends meet,  Applicant began  to  struggle  during  these  years, as the  family income
decreased   by   more  than   50   percent.   (Reply  at   1)   Overwhelmed,  Applicant   incurred
commercial debt totaling  approximately $12,000, as  alleged  in subparagraphs 1.a  through
1.c.   She   also  failed   to   timely  file  her  state   income   tax  returns  from   2012   to   2018,  as
alleged  in  subparagraph  1.d,  as well  as her federal income  tax returns for tax years 2012
to  2017, 2020,  and 2021,  as alleged  in SOR subparagraphs 1.g  and  1.h. (Item  2  at 3)  In
addition,  she   incurred   an   $1,826   state   income   tax  delinquency,   as  alleged   in
subparagraph  1.f  (Item  2  at 3), and  a  $16,936  federal income  tax delinquency, as alleged
in subparagraph  1.i. (Item  2 at 12)
In 2018, Applicant became an independent contractor. Subsequently, her income
began increasing each year. (Reply at 1) Specifically, in 2018, she earned approximately
$89,000 annually, and by 2021, she was earning approximately $200,000 annually. (Item
6 at 8-9; Item 5 at 1)
As Applicant’s income began increasing, she began satisfying her delinquent debt
and catching up on her income tax filings. (Reply at 1; Item 2 at 14) By  March 2021, she
paid the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.c and the $120 delinquent cable television bill
alleged in subparagraph 1.c (Item 2 at 6). By February 2023, she satisfied the state and
federal income tax delinquencies, as alleged in subparagraphs 1.f and 1.g. (Reply at 8 –
10)
With the help of a professional tax preparer, Applicant has completed filing all her
back  tax  returns.  (Reply  at  11)  Currently,  she  is  making  arrangements  to  satisfy  the
balances for federal tax years 2020 and 2021. (Reply at 1)
The remaining outstanding SOR debts are subparagraph 1.a, totaling $737, and
subparagraph  1.b,  totaling  $11,397.  Subparagraph  1.a  is  a  medical  bill  that  Applicant
incurred after she was in a car accident. She contends that she should not be responsible
for this bill because the driver that hit her car was at fault, not her. She provided a letter
from an attorney that she retained to resolve this matter, and as of September 2022, she
was disputing it in litigation. (Item 2 at 15)
Subparagraph 1.b, totaling $11,397, is the remaining amount Applicant owed on a
car loan after her car was totaled in an accident. (Reply at 1) When she purchased the
car in 2013, she could not afford to purchase GAP insurance. (Reply at 1) It is unknown
from the record whether this was the same car accident that she incurred the medical bill,
as alleged in subparagraph 1.b. Applicant has no plans to pay this debt because it has
been charged off her credit report. (Item 10 at 7)
Applicant maintains a budget. She has $7,295 in monthly, discretionary income.
