In  the  Answer,  Applicant  admitted  all  the  SOR  allegations  with  additional
comments. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 31-year-old employee of a government contractor. He has worked
for his current employer since February 2016. He earned a high school diploma in 2010
and  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  December  2015.  He  has  been  married  since  December
2015. He has a two-year-old son, and he and his wife are expecting another child. (Tr.

From  about  September  2011  until  March  2014,  Applicant  purchased  and  used
marijuana  with  varying  frequency  in  social  settings  while  he  attended  college.  In  April
2017, in his Questionnaire for National Security Positions (2017 SF 86), he claimed that
he  had no intention  to use  illegal drugs  in the  future.  He  reaffirmed  his intention to no
longer  use  marijuana  or  other  illegal  drugs  during  his  2018  security  interview.
Notwithstanding  his  prior  marijuana  involvement,  the  DOD  granted  him  access  to
classified  information  in  about  November  2018.  Despite  his  stated  intention  to  avoid
illegal  drug  involvement,  he  used  marijuana  in  January  2019,  May  2019,  and  March
2021, while he was granted access to classified information. He used marijuana these
three times socially with friends He also purchased marijuana on at least one of these
occasions. In his June 2021 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (2021 SF 86),
he stated that he did not intend to use marijuana in the future, but that he might use it
because  he  thought  marijuana  use  should  be  legalized.  He  reiterated  this  sentiment
during  his  June  2021  security  interview,  telling  the  DOD  investigator  that  marijuana
should  be  legal  under  federal  law,  and  implying  that  he  knew  best  about  whether  he
could use it. He also acknowledged that he was violating his employer’s drug use policy
when  he  used  marijuana.  He  last  used  marijuana  in  March  2021.  He  has  not  used  or
purchased any other illegal drugs. (Tr. 20-21, 25-33, 37-39; Answer; GE 1-4, AE A-C)
Applicant  now  claims  that  he  is no  longer open  to  using  marijuana.  He  claimed
that  he  has  matured  since  he  last  used  marijuana  and  last  opined  that  he  would  be
open  to  using  it.  He  claimed  that  he  is  now  ashamed  of  the  statements  he  made
regarding marijuana use in his 2021 SF 86 and during his June 2021 security interview.
He  credits  the  birth  of  his  son  and  his  overall  maturation  process  with  changing  his
perspective. He claimed that having a child, with another on the way, has led him to put
his  family  first,  and  to  look  out  for  their  best  interests,  instead  of  his  own.  He  also
claimed that he now understands that he must abide by the  federal prohibition against
marijuana use regardless  of  whether he agrees  with it. He  volunteered his  illegal drug
use in his 2017 SF 86 and his 2021 SF 86 and discussed it openly with the investigators
during his security interviews in August 2018 and June 2021. (Tr. 20-22, 33-37; Answer;
GE 1-4; AE A-C, H)
Applicant continues to associate with some of the individuals with whom he used
marijuana in the past, but they have not used it in his presence since March 2021. He is
unaware  of  whether  they  continue  to  use  marijuana.  His  wife  does  not  use  marijuana
and  there  is  no  marijuana  in  his  house.  He  provided  a  signed  statement  of  intent  to
abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future
misuse  is  grounds  for  automatic  revocation  of  his  security  clearance  eligibility.  I
observed him while he testified and found him to be sincere and credible. His reporting
of  derogatory  information  regarding  his  illegal  drug  use,  including,  paradoxically,  his
earlier openness to continuing to use marijuana in the future, bolsters his credibility. (Tr.

In July 2022 and in February 2023, Applicant underwent hair-follicle drug tests for
various  controlled  substances,  including  marijuana.  He  tested  negative  on  both  tests.
He provided character-reference letters from his wife and his supervisor. His wife wrote
that he is hard working, loyal, and responsible. She noted a change in his maturity level
for the better after the birth of their son. His supervisor wrote that he is a top performer
with good values. She considers him to be trustworthy and professional. (Tr. 22-23, 35,
39-40; Answer; AE D-G)
