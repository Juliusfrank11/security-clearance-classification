Applicant  is  a  53-year-old  employee  of  a  government  contractor  for  whom  she
has  worked  since  May  2021.  She  has  never  married  but  has  lived  with  two  different
long-term  cohabitants.  She  lived  with  her  first  cohabitant  from  about  1997  until  2000.
She has lived with her current cohabitant since about June 2014. She has a 24-year-old
son whose father is the first cohabitant referenced above. Her son is very intelligent but
has certain behavioral issues  that require her to  financially support him. She earned a
high school diploma in 1988 and took some community college courses but did not earn
a degree. (Tr. 32, 34-37, 39-43, 45-46; Answer; GE 1, 2)
In  the  SOR,  the  Government  alleged  Applicant’s  nine  delinquent  debts  totaling
approximately  $46,600  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.i).  It  also  alleged  her  2001  Chapter  7
bankruptcy  petition  and  2002  Chapter  7  discharge  (SOR  ¶  1.j).  These  delinquencies
consist  of  credit  cards  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.g)  and  federal  and  state  taxes  for  the
2021  tax  year  (SOR  ¶  1.h  and  SOR  ¶  1.i,  respectively).  She  admitted  the  SOR
allegations  with  additional  comments.  Her  admissions  are  adopted  as  findings  of  fact.
The  SOR  allegations  are  established  through  her  admissions  and  the  Government’s
credit reports. (SOR; Answer, GE 3-7)
Applicant’s financial issues began in about 2000 when her cohabitant was injured
and was not able to work. Later, despite being able to work, he was not employed and
was  not  looking  for  a  job.  Having  only  one  income,  Applicant  paid  her  bills  while  she
was able, but in about 2001 she could no longer afford to do so. She filed a petition in
Chapter 7 bankruptcy in November 2001 and received a Chapter 7 discharge in March
2002. She also ended the relationship with her son’s father during this time. (Tr. 45-47;
Answer; GE 6)
After her fresh start in March 2002, she began opening additional accounts. She
largely  stayed  current  on  those  accounts  until  about  2015  when  she  had  some
unforeseen  expenses.  She  opened  the  unsecured  loan  listed  in  SOR  ¶  1.a  to
consolidate some of her credit cards. However, in about 2016, she again began having
trouble paying her bills. Her son and mother, who were living together, each had acute
mental  health  issues.  In  about  2016,  her  cohabitant  cheated  on  her.  From  June  2019
until June 2020, she used a credit repair company. Shortly after she stopped using this
company,  to  protect  her  son’s  mental  health  and  provide  for  a  place  where  she  could
live away from her cohabitant if needed, she rented an apartment where her son lives
and  where  she  can  stay.  She  also  pays  for  a  significant  portion  of  her  son’s  living
expenses. (Tr. 35-37, 47-50; Answer; GE 2-5, 7)
In  2018,  Applicant  developed  a  rare  form  of  glaucoma  that  required  expensive
medications and procedures and contributed to her financial strain.  Given these health
and  family  related  added  expenses,  she  could  not  afford  to  pay  some  of  her  other
financial obligations, including the SOR debts. In May 2021, when she began her new
job, she started earning about twice as much money as the job she worked from about
1998 until then. She claimed that this dramatic income increase would help her resolve
her  delinquencies.  She  also  claimed  that  she  is  no  longer  paying  expenses  related  to
her  glaucoma  so that has  freed  up  some of her income  to  address her delinquencies.
(Tr. 49-51; Answer; GE 2-5, 7)
On  July  14,  2022,  Applicant  engaged  the  services  of  a  debt  consolidation
company to help her resolve her delinquent consumer debts through monthly payments.
She enrolled about $32,000 in delinquent debt in this program and agreed to pay $542
monthly to be disbursed toward the enrolled debts. She enrolled the debts listed in SOR
¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e in this program. Through this debt consolidation company, as of
January  2023,  she  had  paid  about  half  of  the  agreed  upon  settlement  amount  on  the
debt listed in SOR ¶ 1.b. However, she also claimed that she did not recognize this debt
and  does  not  believe  it  is  hers. She  has  not  disputed  it  with  the  creditor.  In  2019,  the
credit repair company disputed it on her behalf with the credit reporting agencies. There
is no  evidence of  the resolution of  the  dispute;  however, the  debt does not  appear on
the  August  2022  or  April  2023  credit  reports.  There  is  no  evidence  that  the  debt
consolidation  company  has  made  any  payments  on  the  remaining  enrolled  debts.
However, the enrolled debts will be paid according to the terms of her agreement with
the debt consolidation company. (Tr. 51-53, 67; Answer; GE 1-4; AE A)
Instead   of  simply  waiting   on   the   debt   consolidation   company,   Applicant  settled
the   debts   listed   in  SOR  ¶¶   1.c,  1.d,  and   1.f   by  contacting   the   creditors  directly  and
paying   less  than   the   full   amount.   She   provided   documentary   evidence   of  these
settlements.   In   October  2022,   she   contacted   the   collection   agency  and   the   creditor   of
settle  that debt,  but she  claimed  that  both  stated  that  they
the  debt  in SOR ¶  1.e  to  try to
were   no   longer  collecting   the   debt   because   the   statute   of  limitations  had   lapsed.   This
debt is scheduled  to  be  paid pursuant to  the  terms of her debt  consolidation  agreement.
She   claimed  that  she  contacted   the   creditor of  the   debt  in   SOR  ¶  1.g,   but  the   creditor
had  no  record of her in their system,  so  she  has not  paid anything  on  that  debt.  (Tr.  53-
57, 77-80;  Answer; GE  2-5, 7; AE B-E, H)
Applicant owed  delinquent federal and  state  income  taxes for the  2021  tax year
in   the   amounts  of  $9,918   and   $2,327,  respectively.  She   became   delinquent   on   these
taxes   because   she   could  no   longer  claim   her  son   as  a   deduction   and   did  not  have
sufficient  income  withheld from  her  wages.  While  not alleged  in  the SOR, she also owed
federal  taxes in  the  amounts  of  $4,112  for tax year 2019, $1,465  for tax  year 2020, and
$4,000  for tax year  2022.  In April  2020, she  made  a  payment arrangement to  pay $200
per month  on  her delinquent  federal taxes.  As of  June  2023, she  has remained  current
on her  IRS  payment plan. On  June  1,  2023, she  made  a  lump  sum  payment of $8,000
to  the  IRS.  There is no  evidence  of the  current amount she  owes the  IRS, but the  latest
documentary evidence Applicant provided  reflected  a balance  of $461 for tax year 2019,
$1,514   for  tax  year  2020,  $10,570   for  tax  year  2021,  and   $4,000   for  tax  year  2022.
These  balances do  not  reflect  Applicant’s  June 1, 2023,  $8,000 payment.  (Tr.  59-60, 69-
76, 81; Answer; GE 2; AE F-J)
Beginning  in  September  2022,  Applicant  began  making  monthly  state  tax
payments  of  $210.  On  May  30,  2023,  she  paid  off  her  delinquent  state  taxes  for  the
2021  tax  year  with  a  payment  of  $1,120.  She  borrowed  money  from  her  retirement
account  to  pay  the $8,000 IRS payment and  the  $1,120 state  tax payment.  While it  is
not alleged in the SOR, she owes delinquent state taxes for tax year 2022 in the amount
of about $1,100. She has not made a payment arrangement on her delinquent taxes for
the 2022 tax year, but she plans to do so. She has not taken any action to avoid owing
federal and state taxes on future income tax returns but claimed that she will do so by
having more  of  her  wages  withheld.  She  also  claimed  that  she  will  use  her  retirement
savings to pay her remaining delinquent federal and state taxes  with a lump sum. (Tr.
59-60, 69-76, 81; Answer; GE 2; AE F-J)
Applicant  brings  home  about  $4,000  per  month  in  wages.  Her  cohabitant,  with
whom she reconciled, brings home about $2,500 per month in wages. They share some
of  their  earnings  and  expenses.  She  pays  about  $1,200  per  month  for  her  son’s  rent
and living expenses. She does not pay any of the mortgage or rent where she resides.
She has about $3,000 in a savings account and about $100,000 in retirement accounts.
She claimed she has about $1,900 in surplus earnings  at the end of each month.  She
spoke  over  the  phone  once  with  an  advisor  for  a  non-profit  credit  counseling  service,
and they went over her income and expenses and budgeting advice. (Tr. 35-37, 60-64;
Answer; GE 2)
Applicant’s  supervisor  testified  that  Applicant  does  well  at  work,  has  a  strong
work  ethic,  and  shows  integrity.  He  believes  that  she  can  be  entrusted  with  handling
classified  information.  Her  son  testified  that  her  financial  issues  were  usually  due  to
circumstances beyond her control. He noted that she is a good person, is altruistic, and
has  always  been  good  to  him.  Several  family  members,  friends,  and  work  colleagues
provided  character  reference  letters  on  her  behalf.  They  all  referenced  her  honesty,
integrity, reliability, and they believe she would protect sensitive information. (Tr. 21-37;
