I  adopt  any  facts  addressed  in  the  above  evidentiary discussion  as  a  finding  of
fact. Additionally, I find that AE F accurately reflects withdrawals from Applicant’s bank
account to the IRS from June 2018 through May 2023 (addressed further below).
Applicant  is  a  63-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor,  where  he  has
worked  since 2021. He  served on active duty  in the U.S.  Air Force  from  1978 until he
was honorably discharged in 1987. He then served in the Air National Guard from 1987
to 2001. He was in the Inactive Reserve until he entered the retired rolls of the Air Force
in 2020. He attended college for a period, but he has not earned a degree. He is twice
divorced.  He  married  his  current  wife  in  2015.  He  has  six  children  and  three
stepchildren. (Transcript (Tr.) at 24, 52-55; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1-3; AE B,
G)
Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial  problems  and  tax  issues,  going  back  to  at
least 2003. He attributed his financial issues primarily to his daughter who was born in
2003  with  significant  medical  problems.  His  insurance  did  not  cover  all  her  expenses,
and  he  had  to  pay  a  large  amount  out  of  pocket.  Her  condition  is  permanent  and  will
require medical care throughout her life. He prioritized his daughter and worked multiple
jobs, but he was unable to pay all his bills and taxes. He filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy
case in 2005, and his dischargeable debts were discharged the same year.  (Tr. at 17,
29-31; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 4, 5, 7)
Applicant  owed  federal  taxes  for  tax  years  2003,  2006,  2007,  2008,  2013,  and
2014.  In  2014,  the  IRS  withheld  $2,305  from  what  would  have  been  a  refund  for  tax
year 2013 and applied it to his 2003 taxes. However, the IRS later assessed additional
taxes, penalties, and interest for 2013 (discussed below). His 2003 taxes were paid in
2015 when $6,180 was withheld from what would have been a refund for tax year 2014
and  was  applied  to  his  2003  taxes.  The  IRS  withheld  $2,132  from  what  would  have
been  that  same  refund  and  applied  it  to  his  2006  taxes.  The  IRS  later  assessed
additional taxes and interest for 2014 (discussed below). (Applicant’s response to SOR;
GE 7; AE D)
In 2016, the IRS withheld $930 from what would have been a refund for tax year
2015 and applied it to his 2006 taxes. In 2018, the IRS withheld $416 from what would
have been a refund for tax year 2017 and applied it to his 2006 taxes. His 2006 taxes
were paid in 2019 when $1,715 was withheld from what would have been a refund for
tax  year  2018  and  applied  it  to  his  2006  taxes.  In  2019,  the  IRS  withheld  $416  from
what would have been the same refund and applied it to his 2008 taxes. In April 2020,
the  IRS  withheld  $2,468  from  what  would  have  been  a  refund  for  tax  year  2019  and
applied it to his 2007 taxes. (Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 7; AE D)
In his Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) that he submitted in
February  2015,  Applicant  reported  his  financial  problems  and  tax  issues.  He  reported
that he owed $47,000 to the IRS at one time. He wrote that he had worked multiple jobs
to pay off his debts. He stated that his debt to the IRS was almost paid off. (GE 2)
Applicant  had  additional  tax  issues  after  he  submitted  the  SF  86.  He  filed  an
extension  for  tax  year  2013,  which  extended  the  due  date  until  October  15,  2014.
However, he did not file his federal income tax return for that year until February 2015.
In  June  2016,  the  IRS  assessed  $9,376  in  additional  tax.  With  penalties  and  interest,
the balance rose to more than $14,000. (Tr. at 35-37; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE
7; AE D)
Applicant  established  an  installment  plan  with  the  IRS  in  February  2018  to  pay
$700  per  month  by  automatic  withdrawal  from  his  bank  account.  He  provided
documentation  of  monthly  $700  payments  since  June  2018.  There  were  payments
every month, except October 2018, August 2019, October 2019, December 2019, and
March  2023.  In  other words,  he  made  56  payments  over  the  course  of  61  months,  or
about  $39,200.  The payment  in  March  2023 was  dishonored  by  Applicant’s bank.  It  is
likely that the other missing payments were also dishonored because Applicant did not
have sufficient funds in his account. (Tr. at 19-21, 37-40; Applicant’s response to SOR;
GE 7; AE D-F)
Because  Applicant  owed  the  IRS  for  previous  tax  years,  regular  payments
through the installment agreement did not begin for tax year 2013 until December 2021.
The  IRS  also  reported  a  $1,400  payment  in  December  2019.  In  April  2022,  the  IRS
withheld what would have been his refund for tax year 2021 and  transferred $5,856 to
his  tax  debt  for  2013.  In  March  2023,  the  last  payment  was  made  through  the
installment agreement and his tax debt  for 2013 was paid in full, leaving only his 2014
taxes to be paid. (Tr. at 37-41; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 7; AE D-G)
Applicant  filed  his  federal  income  tax  return  for  tax  year  2014  on  time.  The
federal income taxes owed were calculated at $12,712, and $21,025 was withheld from
his pay. In March 2015, the IRS withheld what would have been his refund for tax year
2014  and transferred $6,180 to his tax debt for 2003.  However,  in February 2017, the
IRS  assessed  $4,620  in  additional  taxes.  The  IRS  added  $1,455  interest  and  $1,064
penalties,  including  $25  for  the  dishonored  payment  in  April  2023.  As  of  September
2022,  he  owed  $6,827  in  taxes,  interest,  and  penalties.  The  balance  was  reduced  to
$6,139  as  of  May  2023.  Applicant  testified,  as  supported  by  an  IRS  document  that  I
viewed over the computer screen but was not offered into evidence, that the balance for
2014 was down to $5,237. There are no taxes owed for any other tax year.  (Tr. at 16,
41-42; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 7; AE D-G)
Applicant filed  his federal income tax  return  for tax  year  2015  in September  2016.
Since   there  is  no  indication   that  he   requested   an   extension,  the   return  was  filed   late.
What would have  been  a  refund  of $930  was transferred  to  his 2006  taxes.  (Tr. at  45-
46; Applicant’s response to  SOR; GE  7; AE  D)
The IRS received Applicant’s federal income tax return for tax year 2016 on May
1, 2017. Since there is no indication that he requested an extension, the return was filed
about  two  weeks  late.  There  are  no  taxes  owed  for  2016.  (Tr.  at  46-47;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 7; AE D)
Applicant  filed  his  federal  income  tax  return  for  tax  year  2017  on  time.  What
would have been a refund of $416 was transferred to his 2006 taxes. (Tr. at 48; GE 7;
AE D)
Applicant filed an extension for tax year 2018, which extended the due date until
October  15,  2019.  However,  he  did  not  file  his  federal  income  tax  return  for  that  year
until  December  2019,  so  the  return  was  filed  late.  The  IRS  transferred  $1,715  from
would have been a refund  to his 2006 taxes and $1,214 to  his 2008 taxes.  (Tr. at 48;
GE 7; AE D)
Because  of  COVID-19,  the  IRS  extended  the  deadline  to  file  tax  year  2019
to  July  15,  2020.  See  https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/payment-deadline-
returns
extended-to-july-15-2020. Applicant filed his federal income tax return for tax year 2019
in January 2021, which was late. The IRS transferred $2,468 from would have been a
refund to his 2007 taxes. (Tr. at 49-50; GE 7; AE D)
Applicant and a partner started a company in 2020. Their taxes were complicated
by  their  expenses.  A  family  member  who  is  an  accountant  advised  him  to  work  on
getting  all  the  receipts  and  documents  and  file  his  2020  return  with  his  2021  return  in
2022. He filed his federal income tax return for tax year 2020 in May 2022, which was
late. The IRS transferred $2,436 from what would have been a refund from 2020 to his
2013 taxes. (Tr. at 21-22, 50-51; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 7; AE D)
The IRS received Applicant’s federal income tax return for tax year 2021 on June
10,  2022.  Since  there  is  no  indication  that  he  requested  an  extension,  the  return  was
filed late. The IRS transferred $5,836 from would have been a refund to his 2013 taxes.
(Applicant’s response to SOR; AE D)
Applicant has filed his federal income tax return for tax year 2022. He expected
what would be a $212 refund, which would be applied to his 2014 taxes. (AE C, D)
Applicant’s  daughter  is  now  20  years  old  and  living  in  a  skilled  nursing  facility.
She receives Social Security benefits, which pays for some of the costs, and Applicant
and  his  ex-wife  also  contribute.  His  finances  are  currently  stable.  He  credibly  testified
that he intends to continue with the IRS installment agreement until the 2014 taxes are
paid. He now fully understands the importance of filing his returns and paying his taxes
on time. (Tr. at 17-18; 25-34, 44, 47-48, 54-55, 66)
Applicant submitted letters attesting to his excellent job performance and strong
moral  character.  He  is  praised  for  his  honesty,  professionalism,  dependability,
trustworthiness, reliability, work ethic, and integrity. (AE A)
