Applicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security
clearance.  Admitted  facts  are  adopted  and  incorporated  by  reference.  Additional
findings of fact follow.
Background
Applicant married in 2000 and has two adult children from this marriage (ages 17
and 22), both of whom reside with Applicant and his wife. (GE 1; Tr. 27-28) His spouse
is a nurse by training (AE D) and is currently finishing up her course work required for
her master’s degree in nursing. (GE 1) Applicant attended a vocational training institute
between March 2003 and March 2004 and earned a certificate of graduation in March
2004. (GE 1; Tr. 26) He reported no military service.
Since August 2020, Applicant has worked for his employer as a technician. (GE
1; Tr. 29) Between 2011 and 2020, he held steady technician jobs with other employers.
(GE 1; Tr. 29) He has held a security clearance since March 2012. (GE 1; Tr. 27)
Applicant’s finances
Between  2016  and  2020,  Applicant  accumulated  five  delinquent  consumer
accounts  exceeding  $30,000.  (GEs  2-6)  Included  SOR  debts  are  as  follows:  1.a  a
credit-card debt for $11,505); (b) a credit-card debt for $8,310; (c) a credit-card debt for
$6,656; (d) a credit card debt for $2,455; and (e) a credit card debt for $1,556. Together,
these  delinquent  accounts  exceed  $30,000  and  have  not  been  satisfied,  or  otherwise
resolved to date. (GEs 2-6)
Applicant  attributed  his  delinquent  credit  card  accounts  to  his  limited  resources
with  his  one-income  family  while  his  wife  finishes  her  schooling.  (GEs  1-2;  Tr.  26-30)
Having learned important lessons from his financial travails with his high interest credit
cards, he currently only has one credit card at his personal disposal. And this card has a
$350 charging limit. (GEs 1-2) While his wife has been looking for work in her chosen
nursing  field,  she  has been  unsuccessful to date  and  is concentrating  on  finishing  her
class work for her master’s degree. (AE D); Tr. 30)
Asked  about  his  own  efforts  to  address  his  delinquent  accounts,  Applicant
acknowledged  his  failure  to  make  any  inroads  in  addressing  his  delinquent  balances
since at least 2015. (GE 2; Tr. 35-36) Based on the  legal advice he received from the
three  law  firms  he  consulted  with  in  2018,  he  settled  on  a  payment  plan  that  deferred
any  addressing  of  his  delinquent  accounts  until  his  debts  were  reduced  to  judgments
and enforcement measures (inclusive of garnishment). (AEs A-C; Tr. 35-36) Preparing
for that enforcement prospect, Applicant and his wife have been “putting whatever they
can  aside.”  (Tr.  36)  When  interviewed  by  an  investigator  from  the  Office  of  Personnel
Management (OPM) in November 2021, he told the investigator then as well that he had
made no attempts to address and resolve his delinquent balances. (GE 2)
Financial  counselors  he   met  with   offered   him   limited   advice  that   included   his
considering   his  letting   his  debts  run   their   course  to   either  creditor  judgments  or  the
expiration  of governing  statutes of limitation  in  his state  of residence. (AEs A-C; Tr. 37-
38)   Currently,  he   has  no   financial  plan   in   place   to   address  and   resolve  his  debt
delinquencies.  (Tr.  37-38)  With   the   $7,100   in   gross  income   he   earns  monthly,  he   and
his  wife   expend   over   $6,800   a   month   in  expenses  (inclusive   of  his  wife’s  education
expenditures).
Applicant’s  breakdown  of  his  monthly  income  and  expenses  leaves  him  with  a
little  over  $200  a  month  in  discretionary  income  to  address  his  debts.  (Tr.  32)  His
cumulative savings of $6,400 does not afford him any additional resources to make any
serious inroads in addressing his debts. (Tr. 36-37) He and his wife are current in their
lease payments. (AE E)
