Applicant  admitted  the  SOR  allegations  in  ¶¶  1.a-1.r  except  for  1.k,  which  he
denied. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact.  After a thorough and
careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of
fact.
Applicant is 42 years old. He married in 2021 and has no children. He attended
technical college from June 2002 to May 2006 and earned an associate’s degree. He also
attended another college from August 2004 to May 2009 and earned a bachelor’s degree.
He then attended college from August 2010 to May 2011 but did not earn a degree. He
is being sponsored for a security clearance, but apparently, he is not yet employed by his
sponsor, a defense contractor.
Applicant attributed his financial hardship to work being slow and he was unable
to  find  a  job.  He  disclosed  periods  of  unemployment  from  August  2010  to  September
2011, January 2012 to May 2012, August 2012 to February 2013, and April 2020 to May
2021. He also reported he experienced underemployment. He stated in his SOR answer
that when he graduated from college in 2009, he was overwhelmed by the magnitude of
his student loans. He hoped to get a good job and begin paying them within six months.
He was unable to get a job commensurate with his degree and had to accept lower-paying
employment  to  pay  his  expenses.  He  further  stated  that  he  attempted  to  rectify  his
financial difficulties with loans but was unable to pay any “up-front payments required by
the agencies on an exact date given.” (Item 2)
Applicant also stated in his SOR answer that he has a hearing disability that makes
it  challenging  to  rectify  his financial  issues  over  the  phone.  He  said,  “I  have  taken  the
necessary steps with the granting agencies in a good-faith effort to repay if current debt
could be restructured based on current income, resolve some of the debt in full, and/or to
make restitution with set monthly payments.” (Item 2) He did not provide documents to
show what specific agreements or steps he has taken toward a particular debt. He also
hoped to use future income tax refunds to satisfy his debts. (Items 2, 3, 4)
The SOR alleged 14 delinquent debts totaling approximately $114,000 (SOR ¶¶
1.a through 1.n), additional allegations for failure to pay federal income taxes for tax years
2017, 2018, and 2019 (SOR ¶ 1.o - $8,892), and failure to pay state income taxes for tax
years 2015, 2017, 2018, and 2019 (SOR ¶ 1.p - $4,521). The SOR also alleged Applicant
failed  to  timely  file  his  2017  and  2018  federal  income  tax  returns  and  his  2017  state
income tax return (SOR ¶¶ 1.q-1.r).
Applicant’s SOR admissions, SOR answer, statements made to the government
investigator  that  were  affirmed  in  his  interrogatories,  tax  transcripts,  and  credit  reports
from July 2021, February 2022, and July 2022 corroborate the SOR allegations. (Items
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
In Applicant’s answer to the SOR regarding the allegations in ¶¶ 1.c, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h,
1.j, 1.l, 1.m, 1.n, 1.o, and 1.p, he states that he will pay the debts or enter into a settlement
agreement if he is able to attain a security clearance and employment. These debts are
unresolved.
In Applicant’s answer to the SOR regarding the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e,
his  delinquent  student  loans  (approximately  $99,875),  he  provided  a  copy  of
correspondence with the Department of Education from July 2022 indicating his student
loans were in forbearance under the CARES Act and were not currently being collected.
His loans were delinquent prior to the CARES Act. During his August 2021 interview with
a government investigator, which he affirmed its accuracy in his July 2022 interrogatories,
Applicant said that he got behind on paying his loans in August 2017, and he could not
afford payments. He said he experienced financial hardship at that time  and then later
during the pandemic. No evidence was provided regarding any payments he made on the
student loans or attempts to address them prior to the forbearance. He stated in his SOR
Answer  that  he  has  submitted  a  loan  rehabilitation  income  and  expense  form  to  the
creditor so he can get an affordable monthly payment plan. This will not be acted upon
until the CARES Act expires. He is also requesting a $10,000 to $20,000 loan forgiveness
to be credited to the balance he owes. (Item 4)
Applicant admitted that he owed the IRS approximately $8,892 for delinquent taxes
for tax years 2017,  2018,  and  2019.  In  his SOR answer he   stated:  “Payment  has  been
stopped until income is acceptable to satisfy debt owed. If I attain this clearance and job
I will be able to  agree  to  a  settlement to  satisfy debt.” (Item 2) He did not provide evidence
that he made any payments. He provided a document from the IRS that stated he had
visited the IRS Taxpayer Assistance Center in his home state. The letter references tax
year 2019 and states: “[Applicant] has come into the Taxpayer Assistance Center to get
a letter that says he is in Currently Not Collectable status. This letter is to show that he is
indeed  currently not collectable  for 2019.” No other information was provided regarding
payment of his federal tax debt. (Item 2)
In response to government interrogatories, Applicant stated he had filed his 2017
and  2018  federal  income  tax  returns  in  July  2020.  He  disclosed  that  he  owed  federal
income tax for tax years 2017, 2018, and 2019. He provided copies of federal income tax
return forms for 2017 and 2018, but they were not signed and there is no proof they were
mailed and accepted. IRS account transcripts from July 2022 reflect the 2017 and 2018
tax returns had not been filed. (Items 2, 4)
The SOR alleged that Applicant failed to pay his 2015, 2017, 2018, and 2019 state
income taxes. It also alleged that he failed to timely file his 2017 state income tax return.
Applicant indicated in his response to interrogatories that he filed his 2015, 2017, 2018
state tax returns in January 2021. State tax forms he provided are unsigned and there is
no  proof  that  he  mailed  or  filed  his  2017  return  electronically.  A  letter  included  in  his
answer to the SOR from his state department of revenue from July 2016 shows Applicant
was assessed $45 for tax period 2015. There is no proof it was paid. Another letter from
January 2021  to  Applicant in bold  letters and  capitalized  says “REMINDER-WE HAVE
NOT RECEIVED YOUR TAX RETURN.” It also states that he owes $1,050 for tax year
2017.  Letters  for  tax  years  2018  and  2019  show  tax  debts  of  $1,711  and  $1,519,
respectively. Applicant did not provide evidence that he paid these taxes. (Item 2)
Applicant provided no explanation for his failure to timely file his federal and state
income tax returns. Transcripts show his total federal tax balance is $8,892. It is unknown
how the “currently not collectable” status for his 2019 taxes is viewed, as it appears the
amount owed for that year ($3,810) is included in the total balance. Although 2019 taxes
may not currently be collectible, it does not mean it was not owed or will not be collected
in the future. (Items 2, 4)
Applicant denied owing the debt in SOR ¶ 1.k ($719) claiming he never signed a
contract with the creditor, and that he has contacted the creditor and collection company
numerous times. The debt is not listed on his most recent credit report and is resolved in
his favor.
Regarding the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a ($1,187), Applicant admitted owing the debt and
merely  states  it  was  charged  off  and  should  be  removed  from  his  credit  report.  It  is
unresolved. For the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b ($56) and 1.i ($454), he admitted the debts and
noted the collection accounts were charged off and will not be reopened for payment. No
evidence was provided to show he resolved these debts.
