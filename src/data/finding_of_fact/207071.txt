In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  she  admitted  the  four  SOR  debts  (¶¶  1.a
through 1.d) but asserted that ¶ 1.c was a duplicate of ¶ 1.b. Her admissions are included
in the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I
make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 58 years old. She was married from 1984 through 1994, when she and
her  husband  divorced.  She  has  a  son  and  a  daughter.  She  has  been  employed  as  a
financial analyst for a consulting company since 2020. She has held similar jobs in that
field, as a federal contractor from 2007 through 2014 and 2014 through 2020. She has
held a clearance since September 2018. (Item 2)
Applicant reported on her SCA that she had some delinquent debts, stating “I got
behind  on  some  of  my  bills  and  I  am  working  on  catching  up.”  She  disclosed  several
debts, including a $22,000 voluntary repossession of a vehicle in about December 2014.
(Item 2 at 34-38) She also discussed her debts and her overall financial situation during
background interviews in January and February 2022. (Item 3)
The SOR debts are detailed in credit reports from November 2021 and June 2022.
(Items 4, 5) As alleged, the SOR debts total $28,895, though Applicant asserts that one
debt, for $2,662, is a duplicate.
SOR ¶ 1.a  ($22,271) is a charged-off debt relating to an auto repossession. (Item
4 at 3, Item 5 at 2) During her first background interview, she indicated that she had taken
no action to address the debt with the creditor since the repossession and was not willing
to do so. She said she hoped the debt would fall from her credit report. In her Answer to
the SOR, she admitted the debt, and noted that it should “fall off my credit report by March
2023,” seven years after it appeared. (Item 1) She also provided a credit report excerpt
noting the debt. (AE A) (Item 3 at 2)
In her SOR Reply, Applicant said the debt had fallen off of her credit report and
provided  recent  credit  reports  as  proof.  (AE  J,  AE  K,  AE  L)  She  explained  that  her
daughter  became  pregnant  in  2015  and  Applicant  moved  into  a  larger  house  with  her
daughter  and  the  daughter’s  then-boyfriend  with  an  agreement  that  they  would  share
costs. They failed to do so. Applicant had to absorb all the costs herself, leading her to
fall behind on this debt and others. (SOR Reply; Item 3 at 2)
SOR  ¶   1.b   ($3,786)  is   an   account   placed   for  collection   by   a   credit   union.  As  of
November 2021, this account,  #  512362,  had  a  balance  of $4,114.  (Item  3  at 4); as of
June   2022,  this  account  had   a   balance   of  $3,786,  as  alleged.  (Item   5   at  2)  Applicant
provided  documents with  her Answer and  SOR Reply showing  that she  made  payments
of $100, $150, $100, $150, and  $150  between  January and  October 2022.  (AE  B  –  AE
H) This account is being paid.
SOR  ¶   1.c  ($2,662)  is  an  account  charged  off  by  the  same  credit  union  as  the
creditor  for  SOR  ¶  1.b.  This  account,  #  5570XXXXXXXX4535,  is  listed  on  both  credit
reports (Item 4 at 4, Item 5 at 2) Applicant asserted that she has had only one account
with this credit union and said she had disputed the account. (AE A; SOR Reply) She
cited the Equifax credit report, noting account number 4535. This account is listed on that
report, as charged off with a balance of $2,662, as alleged. (AE K at 28) This account
does not appear on the other November 2022 credit reports. (AE J, AE L) Based on the
information in the credit report, SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c appear to be two separate accounts.
SOR ¶ 1.d  ($176) is a retail credit account that has been charged off. (Item 4 at 3
Item 5 at 2) It has been paid. (AE A, AE I)
In her background interview, Applicant said she had not prioritized her debts but
for the ones for which she had set up payment plans, because she could not afford it. She
was caring for her adult daughter and grandson who lived with her. She earned about
$8,917 gross and $5,615 net, per month. Monthly expenses and debt payments leave
about $1,250 in monthly surplus intake. She had not taken on new debt but did not have
a budget or a financial plan. (Item 3 at 5) There is no indication that she has participated
in financial counseling, per se, but she is a professional financial analyst, so she likely
has  had  professional  financial  training.  Applicant  gave  no  details  about  her  current
finances  in  her  SOR  Reply  beyond  her  credit  reports,  which  largely  show  that  she  is
current on her payments.
