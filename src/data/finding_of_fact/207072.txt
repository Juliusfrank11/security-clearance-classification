Applicant is a 60-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since October 2020. He served on active duty in the U.S. military
from 1980 until he was honorably discharged in 1986. He earned an associate degree
in 2012. He is married with three adult children. (Tr. at 22, 47; GE 1)
The   SOR  alleges   11   delinquent   debts   totaling   about   $33,000.   The   debts   are
listed   on   an   August  2021   credit  report,  a   November   2022   credit   report,  or  both   credit
reports.   Most   of   the   debts   were   opened   from   2015   through   2018   and   became
delinquent between  2017  and  2019. (Tr. at 26, 28;  Applicant’s response  to  SOR;  GE  1-
3)
Applicant attributed his financial difficulties primarily to his and his wife’s medical
problems, which were compounded by employment issues. His wife developed cancer
in  about  2009,  their  medical  insurance  did  not  cover  all  the  bills,  and  she  was  out  of
work for about six to eight months. In about 2017, she had surgery, and she was out of
work for at least a month. In about 2021 or 2022, she had an organ transplant, and she
was  out  of  work  for  about  two  months.  She  also  has  a  sporadic  work  history  due  to
working  for  non-profits  that  had  funding  issues.  He  had  surgery  in  about  2022,  which
caused him to be out of work for about three weeks. He lost a job he held for around 35
years in about September 2020, and was unemployed for two to three weeks before he
obtained  his  current  job.  He  believes  the  COVID-19  pandemic  led  to  the  company
letting him go. He earned about $17.50 an hour at his previous job, and about $15 an
hour at his current job. (Tr. at 14-17, 20, 22-27, 43, 46; Applicant’s response to SOR)
Applicant  started  addressing  his  delinquent  debts  in  about  2020.  The  August
2021  credit  report  lists  four  collection  accounts  that  were  paid  or  settled  in  2020  or
2021. He also settled a debt for $292, with the last payment in August 2021. Those five
debts,  which  totaled  about  $1,800,  were  not  alleged  in  the  SOR  because  they  were
resolved before the SOR was issued. (Tr. at 41; GE 1-3; AE A, B)
Applicant settled the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.f before the SOR was issued, with
the  final  payment  of  $372  in  January  2022.  The  August  2021  credit  report  listed  the
balance of the debt as $1,060. The SOR alleged the debt as $688. It is unclear where
that amount came come, possibly another credit report that was not offered in evidence.
The November 2022 credit report lists the balance as $0. (Tr. at 33; GE 2, 3; Applicant’s
response to SOR; AE D)
Applicant  and  the  collection  company  for  the  $428  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.i
agreed  to  resolve  the  debt  through  six  monthly  payments  of  $68,  starting  in  January
2023.  Applicant  documented  that  he  made  the  first  four  payments.  The  last  two
payments were not due as of the date of the hearing. (Tr. at 34; Applicant’s response to
SOR; GE 2, 3; AE C)
SOR ¶¶ 1.g and 1.h allege $663 and $526 debts to the same collection company
for the same bank. He settled and paid the $663 debt in April 2023. He settled and paid
the $526 debt in May 2023. (Tr. at 12-13, 33-34; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 3;
AE E, F)
SOR  ¶  1.d  alleges  a  $3,180  charged-off  credit  card  account.  Applicant  has
accounts with the bank that issued the credit card. He and the bank are in the process
of  setting  up  a  payment  plan  in  which  the  bank  will  automatically  deduct  an  amount
each month from his savings or checking account until the debt is revolved. (Tr. at 32;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1-3)
Applicant  borrowed  about  $14,500  from  his  401(k)  retirement  account  with  his
previous  employer. When  he  was  laid  off,  he  was  unable  to  pay  back  the  loan,  and  it
was treated by the IRS as a distribution from his retirement account, which created tax
consequences in tax year 2021. He paid about $1,100 to resolve the state tax debt. For
about the last year, he has been paying the IRS around $189 per month on a tax debt
that was originally about $4,000. (Tr. at 17-20, 42; Applicant’s response to SOR)
There  are  another  six  SOR  debts  totaling  about  $27,600  that  have  not  been
addressed.  Applicant’s  finances  are  not  perfect,  but  they  have  improved.  His  wife  is
currently  working  full  time,  and  he  is  starting  to  get  overtime  hours.  He  is  a  disabled
veteran  and  receives  about  $1,100  a  month  from  the  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs.
He  worked  to  resolve  his  smaller  debts  first,  in  the  hope  that  he  could  then  secure  a
loan  to  pay  or  settle  all  of  them.  He  credibly  testified  that  he  planned  to  continue  that
course  until  all  the  delinquent  debts  and  taxes  are  paid,  either  collectively  through  a
loan, or individually one at a time. (Tr. at 15, 21-24, 27-44, 46; Applicant’s response to
SOR; GE 1-3)
