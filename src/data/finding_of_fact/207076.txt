In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.h, 1.j, and
1.m; and he denied SOR ¶¶ 1.i, 1.k, and 1.l, the financial allegations under Guideline F.
He  denied  ¶¶  SOR  2.a  and  2.b,  the  falsification  allegations  under  Guideline  E.  He
provided  narrative  statements  in  answering  each  allegation.  His  admissions  are
incorporated into my findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings
and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 33 years old. He is not married, and he has no children. He graduated
from high school in 2008 and attended college from 2008 to 2014, while also working, but
has not earned a degree. From mid-2011 to early 2012, he worked at a large bank until
he was terminated following a cash balance discrepancy in his teller drawer. From early
2012 until early 2013, he was unemployed while attending school. From March 2013 to
September 2014, he worked for a credit union before brief employment with a technology
company. He was then unemployed from December 2015 until beginning his current job.
He has worked for his employer, a defense contractor, since April 2016. (Items 2, 3)
Guideline F
The  SOR  debts  total  about  $52,000.  They  include  about  $30,000  in  past-due
federal student loans, about $20,000 in past-due federal income taxes, and about $2,000
in other past-due debts. The record includes credit bureau reports (CBRs) from June 2022
and November 2021 (Items 5, 6), which, along with Applicant’s admissions, establish the
delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR.
Applicant  did  not  disclose  any  delinquent  debts  on  his  August  2021  SCA.  He
discussed  his  taxes  and  other  debts  during  his  November  2021  background  interview
(see discussion under Guideline E, below), and he provided updated information in a May
2022 interrogatory response. (Items 2, 3, 4)
The debts are detailed as follows:
SOR  ¶¶  1.a  ($4,774), 1.b  ($4,680),  1.c  ($4,429),  1.d  ($3,915),  1.e  ($3,734),  1.f
($3,567),  1.g  ($2,736),  1.h  ($1,617),  and  1.j  ($587)  are  Applicant’s  past-due  federal
student loans, which, as noted, total about $30,000 combined.
In his previous submissions, Applicant explained that he attended college between
ages 19 and 24 and needed financial aid in order to do so. To stay qualified for financial
aid, he had to keep his grades up, both in college and while later attending community
college. He failed to do that, so he attempted to work his way through  school. He then
successfully pursued an information technology (IT) certification, and has been with his
employer,  a  government  contractor,  in  his  field,  ever  since.  However,  he  did  not  earn
enough to pay expenses and to address his student loan re-payments as well, so he fell
behind, and they became delinquent. (Answer, Item 2)
When Applicant contacted the U.S. Department of Education (USDOE) in late July
2022 to ascertain the status of his loans, he was told they were in collection status and
he had to file a “Debt Resolution” form to rehabilitate them, pay them in full, or consolidate
them. Applicant said he applied to rehabilitate his federal student loans by the end of July
2022. Once approved, he would be required to make 9 or 10 timely consecutive monthly
payments to achieve loan rehabilitation. (Answer, Item 2)
Applicant  provided  relevant  documentation  with  his  FORM  Response.  He  was
approved for an income-based repayment plan of $5 per month. As of October 2022, he
had  made  two  $5  payments,  in  August  and  September  2022.  His  loans  remained  in
“default” status as of October 2022, when they were transferred to another loan servicer.
(AE A1 – AE A6)
The  documents  Applicant  submitted  on  remand  show  that  his  student  loan
accounts were in good standing as of August 12, 2022, September 24, 2022, and October
24,  2022.  He  is  to  pay  $5.00  each  month.  (AE  SL,  SL-1,  SL-2,  and  SL-3).  AE  SL-1
provides details of his nine student loan accounts, and shows that as of August 2022, he
owed about $27,625 in unpaid principal. There was no interest rate. (AE SL-1)
In his June 12 e-mail, Applicant addresses his student loans by noting that they
are no longer delinquent since he is participating in the loan rehabilitation program. He
said the loans were in forbearance from 2014 to 2016 and became delinquent in 2017 or
2018. He asserted that the USDOE had an outdated address and phone number for him.
(AE  SL-4)  (If  so,  it  was  his  responsibility  to  keep  them  informed  of  his  proper  contact
details). He asserts that he addressed the matter once he became aware of it. (AE SL-4)
On  October  15,  2022,  Applicant  applied  for forgiveness  of  up  to  $20,000  of  his
federal student loans under the Biden-Harris administration’s student debt relief plan. (AE
A7  –  AE A10). That plan  was subsequently challenged in  federal court, and as of this
writing, a decision by the U.S. Supreme Court is pending.
Additionally,  the  repayment  of  several  federal  student  loans  have  been  in
forbearance status due to the COVID-19 pandemic under multiple Presidential Executive
Orders  since  March  2020.  The  USDOE  recently  announced  that  federal  student  loan
repayments  will  resume  in  October  2023.  https://studentaid.gov/announcements-
events/covid-19.
SOR  ¶  1.i  ($700)  is  an  account  placed  for  collection  by  a  phone  company.
Applicant asserted in his Answer that the account was paid in full and he later provided
corroborating documentation. (Item 1; FORM Response; AE D1) This debt is resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.k ($1,164) is an account placed for collection by a bank. Applicant denies
this debt, and  notes that  the account was  not  listed on a  July 2022  credit  report. That
credit report is not in evidence, but the debt is also not listed on a June 2022 credit report
(Item 5). It is only listed on an earlier credit report, from November 2021. (Item 6) With his
FORM Response, Applicant provided a credit card excerpt showing that his account with
the bank, which has a credit limit of $1,000 and a highest balance of $1,160, is in good
standing. (FORM Response; AE D5)
SOR ¶ 1.l ($367) is an account placed for collection by a jewelry store. (Item 5)
Applicant denies the debt and says he has disputed it with the credit bureaus. (Item 2)
Documentation he later provided verified his dispute, but it also shows the credit bureau’s
conclusion that the  account was valid: “The  information  you disputed has been  verified
as accurate.” (AE D2, AE D3) This account is established and remains unresolved.
SOR ¶ 1.m ($20,000) concerns Applicant’s past-due federal income taxes for tax
year (TY) 2019. Applicant admitted the allegation with an explanation. He did not disclose
any federal income tax debt on his August 2021 SCA, but he reported in his November
2021 background interview that, in November 2021, he received a letter from the U.S.
Internal Revenue Service (IRS) stating that he owed $20,000 in federal income taxes from
TY 2019. He said he did not list it on his SCA because he had just found out about it.
(Item 3 at 5)
Applicant lives in a state on the U.S. east coast. He indicated in his Answer that
his  2019  tax  returns  were  prepared  by  a  tax  preparer,  Ms.  M,  in  a  state  in  the
southwestern U.S., with a nationally known tax preparation service. The reason why he
retained an out-of-state tax preparer is not provided. He asserted that he had never owed
taxes in the past and owing taxes for TY 2019 was out of character. (Answer, Item 2)
With his FORM Response, Applicant provided a series of text messages between
himself  and  Ms.  M,  apparently  from  earlier  in  2022,  in  which  he  repeatedly  sought
information on the status of his taxes, noting that his clearance was in jeopardy. (FORM
Response; AE T-1 to AE T-7) Ms. M provided a letter (undated, though  probably from
2022), noting that she is her own tax preparation service (in the southwestern state). She
explained  that Applicant  retained her in mid-January 2022  “to  settle  any  clerical errors
that involve [Applicant] and his 2019 federal taxes.” She asserted that he first contacted
her in November 2021 after he received a letter from the IRS. She asserted that he does
not owe any taxes and  the  error resulted  from  “the  removal of the  Earned  Income  Tax
Credit” for 2019 due to verification of his employment. She asserted that she expects the
IRS will soon verify that the problem has been corrected and that Applicant will receive a
refund instead of owing past-due taxes. (AE T-8) Ms. M provides no documentation about
Applicant’s  2019
federal  taxes,  to  include  any  tax  return,  correspondence,  or
documentation of her interactions with the IRS to resolve the matter.
Applicant’s November 2022 faxed documents that DOHA did not receive prior to
the  original  decision  in  this  case  concerned  his  student  loans  and  did  not  concern  his
taxes or other debts.
In his June 12, 2023 e-mail, Applicant explained that he had no new documentary
evidence about his federal tax debt to provide. He said his tax preparer, Ms. M, told him
in December 2022 that she was “very ill” and could provide no more assistance. Applicant
contacted the IRS in December 2022 and requested to set up a payment plan. He was
told to file his “2023” (meaning 2022) federal income tax return, to ensure no more taxes
were owed. He received his 2022 W-2 tax form in February 2023 and filed his taxes a
month later. He said his 2022 refund of $358 was applied to his past-due balance. He has
submitted six-months of paystubs to the IRS to verify his income. He will then submit a
payment  plan  for  approval.  He  asserts  he  has  addressed  the  matter  with  a  sense  of
urgency, and  it was his poorly chosen  tax preparer who  acted  in  a “lackluster” fashion.
(AE SL-4) Assuming Applicant’s assertion is correct, he owes over $19,000 of his past-
due $20,000 past-due federal income tax debt, as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.m.
Applicant  provided  a  personal  financial  statement  (PFS)  with  his  May  2022
interrogatory response. He reported net monthly income of just under $3,500 and monthly
expenses and debt payments of a combined $3,525, leaving a small negative remainder.
He  did  not  list  any  payments  for  his  SOR  debts  on  his  PFS.  (Item  4)  He  provided  no
updated information about his income, expenses, or debt payments on remand, except
as noted.
Guideline E
Applicant did not disclose any delinquent debts or past-due federal income taxes
on his August 2021 SCA. (Item 2) SOR ¶¶ 2.a and 2.b allege that Applicant deliberately
failed  to  disclose  that  information,  in  answer  to  certain  questions  about  his  financial
record. Applicant denied the allegations of deliberate falsification. (Item 1)
SOR ¶ 2.a concerns the following two questions on Applicant’s August 2021 SCA
under:
Section  26  –  Financial  Record  –  Delinquency  Involving  Routine
Accounts:  Other  than  previously  listed,  have  any  of  the  following
happened?:
In  the  past seven  (7) years, you  had  bills or debts turned  over to  a  collection
agency” [and]
In the past seven (7) years, you had any account or credit card suspended,
charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as agreed.
All of the debts Applicant allegedly omitted (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.h, 1.j-1.l) are debts that
were turned over to a collection agency. (Items 5, 6) None of them involved suspended,
charged-off, or cancelled accounts. Thus, as to SOR ¶ 2.a, only the first question above
is applicable.
Applicant said he “was aware” that his USDOE student loans “were past due but
[says he] wasn’t aware  that the  accounts  were in collections.” He  recalled  applying  for
repayment and forbearance. He denied intentional falsification, noting his belief that “the
security  department”  had  access  to  that  information  “because  the  loans  belong  to  the
United States Federal Government.” (Item 1, Answer, SOR ¶ 2.a)
SOR ¶ 2.b concerns Applicant’s alleged failure to disclose that he had failed to pay
his $20,000 in federal taxes from TY 2019. (SOR ¶ 1.m) As to SOR ¶ 2.b, Applicant said
he was advised by his tax preparer “to not accept fault until it was 100% determined that
I actually owe.” (Item 1, Answer, SOR ¶ 2.b)
In  his background  interview,  Applicant  voluntarily disclosed  the  November 2021
letter he received from the IRS and noted that he had only then learned about his $20,000
tax  debt  for  TY  2019.  Applicant  then  denied  any  other  delinquencies,  before  being
confronted with his federal student loans in collection, along with his other past-due debts.
(Item 3 at 5)
Applicant  did  not  specifically  address  the  Guideline  E  allegations  further  on
remand, and the related facts above are unchanged from the original decision in this case.
Applicant closed his June 12 email by asserting that he has held a clearance for
the  last  10  years  without  issue  or  incident,  and  with  no  issue  about  his  character  or
trustworthiness  until  now.  He  recognizes  that  it  is  privilege  to  hold  a  clearance  and
understands the values expected of clearance holders. He asserted that every clearance
holder  has  made  mistakes  and  can  turn  it  into  a  lesson  learned.  He  said  he  did  not
intentionally disregard the rules and expectations of clearance holders. (AE SL-4)
