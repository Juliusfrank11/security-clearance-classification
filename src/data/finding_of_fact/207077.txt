In her SOR answer, Applicant admitted all of the allegations, with an explanation.
Her  admissions  are  adopted  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  review  of  the  pleadings  and
evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 36-year-old employee of a federal contractor performing the duties
of a financial analyst. She began working at her present job in June 2018. She previously
worked  for  a  federal  contractor  from  2015  until  taking  her  current  position.  She  was
unemployed from May 2013 to March 2014. She earned hourly wages from $14 to $18
per hour from 2014 to 2018. She holds a bachelor’s degree and is one examination away
from earning her master’s degree. She is single, never married, and has no children. She
provides regular monthly financial support to her elderly parents. (Tr. 6, 19-20, 26; GE 1)
The  SOR  alleged  five  delinquent  student  loans  totaling  approximately  $90,000.
(SOR  ¶¶  1.a  –  1.e) The  debts  are  established  by  credit  reports from  December  2021,
June 2022, August 2022, and January 2023; Applicant’s personal subject interview (PSI)
with an investigator in December 2021; her answers to interrogatories in April 2022; and
her SOR admissions. (GE 2-7; Answer to SOR)
Applicant’s financial difficulties began after her student loan deferments ended in
2014 shortly after she finished attending  classes for her master’s program.  During this
time, she was either working low-paying hourly jobs or she was unemployed. She did not
start making an annual salary until starting with her current employer in 2018. She initially
earned a yearly salary of $90,000 and is now making approximately $110,000. (Tr. 19-21
Applicant took out both private student loans and federally funded student loans to
finance  both  her  bachelor’s  and  master’s  programs.  Her  federal  student  loans  have  a
current balance of approximately $108,000, and are not at issue here. Those loans are
from  COVID-19  relief  executive  orders.  (See:
currently
https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/20/pausing-
student-loan-payments/) She claimed she made $300-$400 per month payments on her
federal  student  loans  before
the  COVID-19  deferments.  She  did  not  provide
documentation supporting her assertion. (Tr. 51-54)
in  a  deferred  status
As stated above, Applicant provides financial support for her mother (age 70) and
her  father  (age  90).  They  live  in  a  different  state  than  does  Applicant.  She  is  the  only
family member in a position to help her parents. She started helping them financially in
approximately 2019, and since February 2020, she has done so on a consistent monthly
basis. She estimates she provides between $400-$800 monthly. Her mother has direct
access to Applicant’s bank account and will transfer or take out money when necessary.
She  always  informs  Applicant  when  she  does  so.  Between  her  own  monthly  living
expenses and what she provides her parents, she claims she did not make enough to
pay  her  private  student  loans.  She  looked  into  the  possibility  of  hiring  two  debt-relief
companies, but she could not afford the monthly payments each calculated for her, and
so  she  declined  to  hire  them.  She  admitted  that  she  put  her  private  student-loan
obligations  on  the  “back  burner,”  in  terms  of  her  financial  priorities.  She  provided  a
monthly  budget  that  shows  a  $1,200  monthly  surplus  after  all  expenses.  She  also
provided a copy of an earnings statement. The budget does not account for any payments
to either her private or her federal student loans. (Tr. 21-22, 31-32, 51, 56; GE 3)
The status of the SOR debts is as follows:
SOR ¶¶  (Student  Loans)  1.a-$22,105;  1.b-$20,160;  1.c-$19,368; 1.d-$17,312;
1.e-$11,493.  Applicant  admitted  these  delinquent  student loans. All  five  were originally
assigned  for collection  between  May 2006  and  August 2008,  and  a  more recent  credit
report shows major delinquencies for all  accounts  between  June  and  December 2019.
Recently,  they   were   bought  by   a   collection   agency,  which   approached   Applicant  with
settlement offers   for all five   loans   in  July 2022.   Applicant   admitted   receiving   the  offers
and   provided   copies  of  them.  The   offers  expired   in  August  2022   without  Applicant
committing  to  them. She  stated  paying  her student  loans was  not a  priority in her life  right
now. She  has not entered  into  an  agreement with  the  collector holding  her private  student
loans  since  then.  These  debts  are  unresolved. (Tr. 22,  29, 35,  57;  GE  2-7;  SOR answer;
AE A1-A5)
Applicant  provided  a  character  letter  written  on  her  behalf  by  a  coworker  who
stated that Applicant is a great asset to their work team. She also opined that Applicant’s
reliability,  trustworthiness,  and  good  judgment  make  her  worthy  of  holding  a  security
clearance. (AE B)
