In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions
are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  47-year-old  machine  operator  employed  by  defense  contractors
since  February  2019.  In  2022,  Applicant’s  gross  annual  earnings  exceeded  $88,000,
inclusive  of  company  incentive  pay  totaling  $14,000.  Applicant  is  a  participant  in  the
company’s 401(k) plan, having contributed over $6,000 pre-tax to the plan in 2022. (Item
2 at 4). Prior to this position, Applicant worked as a construction laborer from March 2018
through February 2019; a self-employed Uber driver from June 2015 through March 2018;
and a process engineer from June 2007 through June 2015. He states he left the position
in  June  2015  because  the  company  moved  its  operations  out-of-state.  (Item  3  pp.  15
through 16) All told, Applicant has been consistently employed without any meaningful
gap in employment since at least mid-2007. (Items 2 through 4)
There is no information in the record  concerning  Applicant’s education. (Items 3
through 4) He married the first time in 1996, but the marriage did not last and the couple
parted ways in 1996. He married a second time in January 2009. The couple have two
children, ages 13  and 10  years.  He  states his  wife  never worked outside  of the  family
home. (Items 3 through 4)
The SOR alleges  nine delinquent debts. However, the debts alleged in SOR  ¶¶
1.d and 1.e are duplicate accounts.  The eight non-duplicate debts total about $30,306
and are reflected in credit bureau reports from July 2021 (Item 5) and April 2022 (Item 6).
These debts are established through these credit bureau reports; Applicant’s admissions
in his Response to the SOR; and his September 2021 investigative interview. (Items 2,
and 4 through 6)
Applicant attributed his financial problems to medical debts incurred after the birth
of his daughter in 2012. (Item 4 at 6) He stated other debts went unpaid due to him having
to pay medical bills to the hospital that provided delivery services to his wife for the birth
of his daughter. He states he did not have enough income to simultaneously support his
family and pay his debts; and that he was the sole income-earner in the family, and his
income remained stagnant as the cost of living and other expenses increased over time.
Finally, he states he used credit cards to pay bills during the period. (Items 2 and 4) He
provided  no  evidence  or  any  details  concerning  his  income  or  his  general  financial
obligations  during  this  period  or  afterwards,  except  his  December  2022  earnings
statement attached to the Response to the SOR. (Items 2 and 4)
Applicant’s  two  largest  delinquent  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b  are
charged-off credit cards from the same creditor, and total $19,353. Both accounts were
assigned  to  collection;  SOR  ¶  1.a.  was  assigned  in  April  2014;  and  SOR  ¶  1.b  was
assigned in April 2015. (Item 5 at 2 and Item 6 at 2) The creditor charged off both accounts
in  about  January  2018.  A  third  delinquent  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.c  for  $4,154  was
assigned for collection in June 2015; it was charged off in about June 2021. (Item 5 at 3
and Item 6 at 2) Five remaining delinquent debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.d, and 1.f through
1.i, were assigned to collection between July 2017 and July 2020. All five debts remain in
a collection status. (Items 5 and 6)
After admitting responsibility for all delinquent debts in the SOR, Applicant loosely
made the following additional comment concerning the debts: “[T]hey are deducting my
wages from my paycheck already.” (Item 2 at 2) He told investigators in September 2021,
that he would take the following actions concerning these debts to resolve them within
the next two years: (i) contact creditors to negotiate a monthly payment plan; or (ii) settle
with creditors to pay off debts; or (iii) contract with a third-party debt repayment company
to consolidate all delinquent debts to pay off debts over time through monthly installments.
(Item  4  pp.  7  through  8)  There  is  no  evidence  in  the  record  he  took  any  of  the
aforementioned actions. In the same interview, he commented that his current income is
better and more stable, enabling him to financially support his family; he lives within his
means; and does not foresee having delinquent debts in the future. (Item 4 at 8)
Applicant’s  December  2022  earnings  statement  reflects  an  unidentified  creditor
garnished his pay in the amount of $564.52 for an unidentified delinquent debt. The year-
to-date  garnishment  totaled  $1,776.31  during  this  period.  His  earnings  statement  also
shows  five  loans  collateralized  against  his  401(k)  funds  of  an  unknown  total  balance.
(Item 2 at 4) No information was provided concerning the purpose of the five loans. Other
than  the  earnings  statement  discussed  above,  he  provided  no  documentary  proof  of
efforts or decisions taken to resolve delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. (Item 2 at 4)
