The SOR alleges under Guideline B that Applicant’s two grandfathers, uncle, two
aunts, and a cousin are citizens and residents of Taiwan. Applicant admits each of these
allegations. (SOR ¶¶ 1a through 1d).  His admissions are incorporated in my findings of
fact.
Applicant  is  27  years old.  He  was born in  Taiwan. He has worked  for a  defense
contractor  since  August  2021.  He  came  to  the  United  States  with  his parents  in 1999.  His
parents live  in the  United  States and  maintain  dual citizenship with  both  countries.  He and
his parents became  U.S. citizens  in 2010. He  holds both   U.S. and  Taiwanese  passports.
His  sister  was   born   in   the   United   States   in  2000   and   resides   in   the   United   States.  He
graduated  high  school in 2015  and  received  his bachelor’s degree  in 2019.  (Item  4  at 14-
15.)
From 2014 through 2018, while he was a student, Applicant traveled each year to
Taiwan during the summer months. (Item 5 at 10.) He used his Taiwan passport to travel
to Cambodia and Japan while visiting Taiwan. (Item 4 at 5.) He has not traveled back to
Taiwan since he graduated from college in 2019. (Item 4 at 14-15 and Item 5 at 10.) He
indicated he would renew his Taiwanese passport because it made traveling to Taiwan
easier.  (Item  5  at  5.)  He  told  the  investigator  he  would  not  renounce  his  Taiwanese
citizenship because he could see himself retiring to Taiwan. (Item 5 at 4.) He went on to
state he does not know a lot about Taiwan and that he considers himself an American first
because “he has lived most of his life in the [United] States.” He added he does not have a
“strong allegiance to the Taiwan government.” (Item 5 at 4.)
During his seven trips to Taiwan, he visited the relatives alleged in the SOR. He
speaks with each relative approximately once or twice a year. He listed “by affection” in
his  interrogatory  response  for  how  he  was  bound  to  each.  (Item  5  at  10-11.)  Both  his
maternal grandfather and uncle  served  in  the  Taiwanese army.  His  grandfather was a
doctor and has since retired. His uncle served the mandatory military service time and is
also now retired. (Item 5 at 6-7.) None of the relatives alleged have any affiliation with the
Taiwan government or defense industry. (Item 5 at 10-11.)
