Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations (¶¶ 1.a-1.n, and 1.p), except for ¶¶
1.o, 1.q, and 1.r. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a careful review
of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  61  years  old.  He  has  worked  for  his  current  employer,  a  defense
contractor, since August 2016, as a supply technician. He holds an associate degree, a
bachelor’s degree and two master’s degrees. He is married for the second time and has
one adult child. (Items 3-4).
Applicant served in the U.S Army from 1994 to 2001. He also served in the Army
National Guard from 2002 to 2010. He was honorably discharged. (Item 3)
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant  incurred  18  delinquent  debts,  comprised  of  student
loans  and  consumer  debts  totaling  approximately  $130,000  (of  which  approximately
$100,000  derive  from  his  student  loans)  (¶¶  1.a-1.f,  1.h-1.j,  and  1.l-1.m).  Two  of  the
student loan accounts appear to be duplicates and I find in favor of  Applicant on those
debts (SOR ¶ 1.l is a duplicate of ¶ 1.i and SOR ¶ 1.m is a duplicate of ¶ 1.j).
Applicant admitted the 11 delinquent student loans of approximately $100,000 in
his SOR answer. He further stated during his background investigative interview, that he
had no reason to dispute these debts. A credit report reveals that his student loans were
assigned for collection between 2010 and 2016. Applicant claimed the loans were put in
deferment  for  a  period.  He  failed  to  provide  any  documentary  evidence  that  he
contacted  the  lenders,  set  up  any  payment  plans  for  his  student  loans,  or  paid  any  of
the accounts. They remain unresolved. (Items 2, 4, and 5)
The  SOR  also  alleged  Applicant  owed  seven  delinquent  consumer  accounts
totaling approximately $17,000. (¶¶ 1.g, 11.k, and 1.f-1.r) He admitted these debts in his
background  interview and  in  his SOR  answer,  except  for ¶¶  1.o  and  1.q-1.r,  which  he
denied.  SOR  ¶¶ 1.q-1.r  no  longer appear  on Applicant’s most  recent  credit  report  and
are  resolved  for  him.  The  remaining  debts  are  reported  as  delinquent  debts  in  credit
reports  from  October  2021  and  June  2022.  He  provided  no  documentary  evidence
showing that he contacted the creditors, established payment plans, or paid any of the
remaining debts. (Items 2-6)
Applicant believes that his limited income led to his financial difficulties. He is in a
better financial situation now because he received a promotion and his wife is working.
There was no evidence of financial counseling presented. (Item 4)
