(Tr. at 7, 17-24, 74-77; GE 1-3)
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  failed  to  file  his  federal  income  tax  returns,  as
required, for tax years (TY) 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2020. (SOR ¶ 1.a) It also alleged

delinquent federal taxes for TY 2015 through 2020, respectively. (SOR ¶ 1.b-1.g) It also

were  entered  against  him  in  April  2014,  July  2015,  April  2016,  and  December  2021,
respectively. (SOR ¶ 1.h-1.k)
The SOR also alleged that Applicant owed $36,149 and $18,068 for two judgments
entered against him by his previous homeowner’s association (HOA) in December 2014
and  December  2018,  respectively.  (SOR  ¶  1.l-1.m)  It  also  alleged  that  he  had  four
delinquent  consumer  debts,  totaling  approximately  $5,985.  (SOR  ¶  1.n-1.q)  The  SOR
allegations  are  established  by  Applicant’s  admissions  in  his  Answer;  his  March  2020
security  clearance  application  (SCA);  his  December  2021  response  to  DOHA
interrogatories; his May 2020 and July 2020 background interviews; federal tax account
transcripts from December 2021 and tax-related correspondence provided by Applicant;
court records; and a February 2022 credit bureau report. (Answer; GE 1-6)
Applicant  believed  his  financial  difficulties  began  in  2011,  when  his  brother
unexpectedly  moved  to  a  foreign  country  and  left  him  solely  responsible  for  a
condominium that they jointly purchased in 2009. Both their names were on the title and
the mortgage, and they had agreed to share in the costs of ownership, which included the
monthly $2,100 mortgage and $804 HOA fees. He notified his mortgage company and
the  HOA  about  his  financial  issues,  but  neither  were  willing  to  accommodate  his
circumstances because his condominium was underwater. He unsuccessfully attempted
to find a roommate. He also tried on multiple occasions, to no avail, to contact his brother
to ask him to continue to honor his financial obligations for their condominium. The HOA
obtained  its  first  judgment  against  him  in  2014.  Beginning  in  2015,  he  limited  his  tax
withholdings from his paycheck so that he would have more money available to pay his
mortgage,  HOA  fees,  and  other  expenses.  He  knew  he  would  not  be  able  to  pay  his
outstanding taxes during tax season. He contacted several tax professionals to assist him
but could not afford their services. He also tried to use tax software to prepare his income
tax returns on his own, but the software did not permit him to go as far back as he needed,
and he did not feel equipped to  do them. He did not file his relevant federal and state
income tax returns or pay his income taxes. He testified:
Well, it started with 2015. I knew that I would probably owe a lot. And I was
young, I was scared as far as owing a lot. And I just -- yeah, I was scared. .
. . Because of how much I owed, and -- yeah.
(Tr. at 22-32, 46-53, 69-92, 106-107, 112-114, 121; GE 1-5; AE N)
At  an   unrecalled   date   between   2011   and   2017,  Applicant’s  mortgage   company
denied  his  two-year  application  to  short  sale  his  condominium.  He  moved  out  of  the
condominium  in  2017.  His  condominium  was  foreclosed,  and  the  HOA  obtained  the
second  judgment  against  him.  When  Applicant  was  unemployed  from  June  2020  to
November 2020, he could no longer afford to stay  afloat, and he obtained credit cards
and loans to make ends meet. (Tr. at 22-32, 46-53, 56-58, 65-66, 69-92, 119-120, 124-
125; GE 1-5; AE T)
When Applicant retained employment with a more substantial income in November
2020,  he  decided  to  start  resolving  his  debts.  He  retained  a  tax  resolution  firm  in
approximately  December  2021,  at  a  cost  of  $2,000,  to  assist  him  with  filing  his  past
income  tax  returns  and  resolving  his  outstanding  federal  and  state  taxes.  The  firm
submitted an installment agreement request on his behalf to the Internal Revenue Service
(IRS). He stated that he planned to set up a payment plan to resolve his outstanding state
taxes. (Tr. at 32-38, 92-94, 96-97, 99-100, 107-108, 112-114, 126; GE 1-4)
Applicant’s  efforts  to  resolve  his  outstanding  financial  obligations  were  further
impacted  when,  in  2022,  his  sister  and  her  husband  began  divorce  proceedings,  and
Applicant took his sister and his five-year-old nephew into his care. With an annual salary
of approximately $23,000 as a special education teacher, his sister’s financial means are
limited so Applicant has given her approximately $500 monthly, and he assisted her with
paying groceries and other expenses. (Tr. at 24-27, 107-108)

checking account of $604 monthly, beginning in July 2022. In July 2022, he untimely filed

federal income tax returns for TY 2021 and 2022. He owed $10,218 in federal taxes for
TY 2021, for which he reached an installment agreement in October 2022 to resolve. The
IRS  intercepted  his  $976  overpayment  for  TY  2022  and  applied  $783  and  $192,
respectively,  to  his  outstanding  federal  taxes  for  TY  2013  and  2014.  His  remaining
balance for TY 2014 was $7,170. (AE A, S)

payments, in accordance with his June 2022 installment agreement with the IRS, in July
2022, August 2022, and September 2022. The IRS was unable to process his payments
in  November  2022,  December  2022,  and  January  2023.  Another  payment,  made  by
Applicant in January 2023, was pending as of the date of the hearing. He made his $604
payment  in  accordance  with  his  payment  arrangement  in  March  2023.  He  intends  to
continue abiding by his payment plan with the IRS. (Tr. at 28-37, 100-104, 108-112, 114-

Applicant testified that he could not recall receiving any documentation related to
his  state  tax  liens.  He  contacted  the  state  tax  authority  directly  and  entered  an  initial
payment  plan  in  March  2022,  consisting  of  $791  monthly  payments  for  56  months
beginning in April 2022, to resolve his outstanding state taxes of $38,833. He made two
payments in April 2022, consisting of $242 and $791. He renegotiated that payment plan
to  better align with his budget  and other expenses,  and he entered  a payment plan  in
November  2022,  consisting  of  $470  monthly  payments  for  99  months  beginning  in
December 2022, to resolve  his outstanding state taxes  of $36,758.  (Tr. at 37-46, 100-

2022 of $836; three payments in February 2023 totaling $1,401; and a payment in March
2023 of $470. He stated that he did not make any payments to the state tax authority from
August  2022  to  December 2022  because  he  was  not  obligated  to do  so  while he  was
renegotiating his payment plan, and he was late on his payments for December 2022 and
January  2023,  in  part  because  he  did  not  receive  the  approval  of  his  renegotiated
payment plan in the mail until after the December 2022 due date. He also had to pay his
attorney’s  fees  for  the  attorney  he  retained  to  represent  him  at  his  security  clearance
hearing. He intends to continue to comply with his payment arrangement with the state
tax  authority  and  resolve  his outstanding  state  taxes.  (Tr. at  37-46,  100-104,  108-112,

Applicant  stated  that  the  two  HOA  judgments  in  SOR  ¶  1.l-1.m  were  entered
against  both  him  and  his  brother  but  that  his  brother  filed  bankruptcy,  which  left  him
responsible for the judgments. He testified that he made payments to the HOA of $430
monthly for over one year before the HOA obtained the judgments against him. He also
testified  that  he  contacted  the  HOA  at  least  nine  times  to  resolve  his  outstanding
judgments. He reached a debt settlement agreement in March 2022, which provides for
him to pay his $68,305 balance at $400 monthly, beginning in April 2022. He testified that
he had since mailed his payments via check to the HOA, and he provided copies of such
checks from April 2022 to January 2023 but stated that the HOA had yet to deposit any
of them. He set those funds aside in his bank account. He unsuccessfully attempted to
contact the attorneys that represented the HOA in obtaining the judgments against him,
to  determine  why  none  of  his  checks  have  yet  been  deposited.  In  March  2023,  he
successfully  contacted  the  HOA,  who  informed  him  that  it  had not  received  any  of  his
checks, and he hand delivered a $3,500 cashier’s check. He also made his $400 payment
for  April  2023.  He  intends  to  continue  making  his  payments  in  accordance  with  his

the time he was in or leaving his condominium. He could not recall whether he made any
