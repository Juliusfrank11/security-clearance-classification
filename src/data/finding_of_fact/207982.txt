Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  allegations  in  SOR.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant is 42 years old. He is a high school graduate and enlisted in the military
in 1998 and was honorably discharged in 2013. He deployed to both Afghanistan and Iraq
and served multiple combat tours. He was unemployed for about nine months after his
discharge and has been steadily employed since March 2014. He married in 2005 and is
separated from his wife. They have one child. He held a security clearance while in the
military and has held once continuously since approximately 2015. (Tr. 15-21, 41-42; GE
1)
Applicant  completed  a  security  clearance  application  in  August  2020.  In  it  he
disclosed he failed to file his 2015 through 2019 federal income tax returns. For tax years
2015 and 2016 he said he could not recall why he failed to file them. For tax years 2017
through 2020 he said he did not file his tax returns because he had not filed the prior year.
For all tax years, he stated he was waiting to receive a hard copy of his W-2 income form
from his ex-employer. (Tr. 39-40; GE 1)
Applicant provided tax transcripts for tax years 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and
2020. The following information is reflected in those documents.
2015-income tax return filed August 2021 and tax debt of $1,817 paid in January
2023. (AE A)
2016-income tax return filed August 2021 and tax debt of $1,470 paid in August
2022. (AE B)
2017-no return filed. (AE C)
2018-income tax return filed August  2021 and tax payment made in September
2021 in the amount of $2,637. It appears from the transcript a refund of $229 was issued
later. (AE D)
2019-income tax return filed August 2021 and a $202 refund issued. (AE E)
2020-income tax return filed August 2021 and refund issued. (AE F)
Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator in September 2020. In the
interview they discussed his failure to file his federal and state income tax returns from
2015 through 2019. He told the investigator he did not realize he failed to file his income
tax returns until he completed his SCA. He misplaced his W-2 forms and was waiting for
his former employer to provide them so he could complete the returns. (GE 2)
Applicant completed government interrogatories in March 2022. He disclosed he
had filed his 2018, 2019, and 2020 federal and state tax returns in August 2021. (GE 2)
Applicant testified that he procrastinated in filing his federal and state income tax
returns. He was always busy and forgot to file, and then he did not realize he had not filed
his  tax  returns  until  he  completed  his  SCA.  He  said  he  had  to  gather  his  investment
documents and then he would have complete lapses in focusing on filing the delinquent
returns. He would then tell himself he would complete them later and then forgot about
them. He admitted he had no excuses for his failure to file his federal and state income
tax returns. He was aware of his responsibility to file his income tax returns on time. He
hired an accountant to help him file his delinquent returns. (Tr. 22-23, 35, 51)
Applicant explained that once  he  began  the process to file  the  delinquent returns,
they  were  delayed  because  those  returns older that  were  three  years old  could not  be
filed  electronically. He  credibly testified  that  he  filed  his 2017  federal income  tax  return
with  the  other returns but it has not yet been  processed  on  the  IRS  website. At the  time
of his hearing, he  testified that he  did  not know if he owed  taxes for 2017. (Tr. 23-26, 36-
40)
Applicant testified that he filed his state returns when he filed his federal income
tax returns for 2015 through 2020. He said he received  two to three refunds that were
deposited into his bank account, but he does not know for what year or if he owed for any
years. (Tr. 26-28)
At his hearing, Applicant was asked if he had filed his 2021 and 2022 federal and
state income tax returns. He testified that he had not yet filed them. He testified that he
received a notice from his accountant prior to the April filing due date reminding him of
his obligation to file his income tax returns. He said he saw the email reminder but never
followed up on it. Applicant said that in March 2023 his laptop and hard drive were stolen.
He had investment information on it that he needed to file his returns. This would not have
impacted his ability  to timely file his 2021 federal and state income  tax  returns. It may
have impacted his ability to file his 2022 returns that were due in April. He did not file an
extension to file his 2022 federal or state income tax returns. Applicant’s filing status is
“head of household.” He testified that when he was in the military, it was drilled into him
to get his tax returns filed. He was aware of his responsibility to timely file and pay his
taxes. (Tr.25, 28-34, 37-39, 43-51)
Applicant provided a payment activity statement from the IRS dated June 28, 2023.
It stated that in January 2023 Applicant made a balance payment of $1,817 for tax year
2015; for tax year 2017, in August 2022, a balance payment was made of $1,470; and in
September 2021 for tax year 2018 a balance payment was made of $2,637. (AE G)
Post-hearing, Applicant provided a document from a tax service showing that he
was due refunds for tax years 2021 and 2022 for both federal and state taxes. It appears
the  tax  returns  were  transmitted  and  accepted  by  the  IRS  on  July 18,  2023.  It  did  not
appear they had been processed yet. (AE H, I)
