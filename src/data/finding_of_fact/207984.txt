Applicant is a 62-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security
clearance.  Admitted  facts  are  adopted  and  incorporated  by  reference.  Additional
findings of fact follow.
Background
Applicant  married  in  August  1982  and  has  two  adult  children  (ages  27  and  24)
from this marriage. (GE  1;  Tr. 38)  He earned  an associate’s’  degree  in  May 1993 and
attended  some  additional  college  classes.  (GE  1;  Tr.  39-40)  He  reported  no  military
service. (GE 1)
Since  February  2007,  Applicant  has  worked  for  his  current  employer  as  a
database  administrator.  (GE  1;  Tr.  38)  He  held  part-time  positions  between  January
2007  and  January  2012.  (GE  1)  Applicant  has  held  a  security  clearance  since  May
2010. (GE 1)
Applicant’s finances
Applicant  financed   his   college   education   with   the   aid  of  a   federally-guaranteed
student loan  in 1993 for approximately $17,000.  (GEs 2-3;  Tr;.  41, 63-64)  By  2009,  he
had   paid  down   his  student  loan   to   around   $9,000.  (Tr.  41)  As  the   result  of  either
refinancing   or  added   interest,   the   account   was  reported   in  May  2022   to   have   a   high
balance   of  $13,657   and   a   delinquent   balance   of   $10,455.   (GE  3)  Applicant  has  not
made   any  additional   payments  on   his  personal  education   loan   since   November  2019,
and  the  account remains in collection  status  with  interest continuing  to  accrue.  (GEs  2-
3; Tr,  63-64)
Credit reports confirm that in August 2017 Applicant took out a 36-month parent
student loan for his son’s college education in the amount $17,760. (GEs 2-3; Tr. 56-56,
63-64) He took out this parent loan in his own name without any co-signature from his
son. Since 2017, he has not made any payments on this parent loan, and credit reports
confirm  that  the  account  is  in  collection  status  with  $20,627  owing  on  the  cumulative
balance as of May 2022. (GEs 2-3; Tr. 42)
Currently, both of Applicant’s student loans are in pause status. (Tr. 58-59) And,
while  the  loans  have  been  in  pause  status,  Applicant  has  been  exempt  from  making
payments  on  either  loan.  (Tr.  58-59),  However,  the  pause  does  not  change  the
delinquent  condition  of  the  loans,  but  only  suspends  any  payment  enforcement  while
the pause remains in effect. And, despite promises to do so, Applicant has not provided
any documentation of a payment plan or budget as to how he will rehabilitate his loans
once the pause is lifted. (Tr. 45)
Besides his student loan debts, Applicant is indebted to five consumer creditors
for  delinquent  accounts  exceeding  $24,000.  (GEs  2-3)  He  accrued  these  debt
delinquencies  between  2013  and  2018.  (GEs  2-3)  Applicant  attributed  his  debt
delinquencies  to  recurrent  medical  bills  associated  with  a  serious  car  accident  he
experienced in 2015. (Tr. 42-43)
Estimated   medical   expenses  associated   with   his   accident   exceeded   $100,000.
(Tr. 44) Most of  the  bills (70  to  80  per  cent) were covered  by  his  medical insurance.  (Tr.
44) Applicant’s incurred  hospital co-pays and  other medical bills  he accrued  to  address
his injuries from he accident exceeded  $22,000. (AE F; Tr. 42-44)
In 2018, Applicant retained a debt consolidation agency for about a year to help
him  resolve  his  debts,  (Tr.  48)  Making  no  discernible  progress  with  this  agency,  he
terminated their services and withdrew his escrowed funds of approximately $5,000. (Tr.
48-49) With the returned funds, he paid off some small medical bills. (Tr. 48-49) Except
for his payoff of his SOR ¶ 1.f debt ($1,960), he has not addressed any of his remaining
delinquent consumer accounts and medical debt with the current resources available to
him.  (GEs 2-3 and AE A, Tr. 45-47)
Applicant  currently  makes  $148,000  a  year  (inclusive  of  annual  bonuses  that
typically  range  between  one  and  three  percent).  Broken  down,  Applicant  nets  around
$8,000 monthly in take home pay. (Tr. 38-39 49-51) His monthly expenses generally run
close to $5,000 (inclusive of medical expenses). (Tr. 51-52) His 401(k) retirement fund
currently  has  about  $100  in  the  account.  (Tr.  40)  Because  his  wife  does  not  work,  he
has only his own financial resources to cover his bills and other expenses. (Tr. 40)
After accounting for his monthly expenses (inclusive of his medical co-pays that
run  between  $200  and  $300  for  himself  and  $200  for  his  wife),  Applicant  retains  a
monthly remainder of close to $3,000. (AE F; Tr. 40, 53-55) Committing to taking care of
his bills, he documented a very limited payment plan and budget to support his ability to
do so. (AE D; Tr. 37-38, 60-61)
Character references
Applicant  is  highly  regarded  by  his  friend  and  his  team  lead.  (AE  D;  Tr.  20-21,

Aware  of  his  financial  issues,  his  team  lead  cited  the  advice  she  gave  him  on
addressing  his  medical  bills  and  how  to  rectify  his  financial  situation.  (AE  D;  Tr.  21)
While unfamiliar with all of Applicant’s debts, she knew most of the details of his medical
bills and how they affected his ability to address his other debts. (AE D; Tr. 22)

2005 (Tr. 33-34), but who has no specific knowledge of Applicant’s financial issues. (AE
D; Tr. 33-35)
