In  Applicant’s  SOR  response,  he  admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations  under
Guidelines H and E. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a -1.f, and 2.a.) His admissions are accepted as findings
of fact. Additional findings follow.
Applicant is 31 years old. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in August 2012 and was
honorably discharged in August 2016. From August 2016 to 2020, he was a member of
the Navy Individual Ready Reserve (IRR). He worked part time at a car dealership while
taking college courses. He earned an associate degree in 2018 and a bachelor’s degree
in May 2020. Since August 2020, he has been employed by a government contractor. His
job  title  is  senior  classified  systems  administrator.  He  is not  married,  and  he  does  not
have any children. (Tr. 20-22, 27, 42; GE 1)
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse and Personal Conduct
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  Applicant  used marijuana with  varying  frequency  from about
2009 to about May 2020. SOR ¶ 1.b alleges that he purchased marijuana during 2009
until about May 2020. SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.e allege that he used and purchased marijuana
from  September  2016  to  May  2020,  while  granted  eligibility  for  access  to  classified
information.  SOR  ¶¶  1.d  and  1.f.  allege  that  he  used  and  purchased  marijuana  from
September 2016 to about May 2020, while employed in a sensitive position with the IRR.
Applicant  detailed  and  categorized  his  marijuana  involvement  into  four  distinct
periods of his life. (1) from 2009 to 2012, he used marijuana recreationally in high school
until his junior year of college; (2) from 2012 to 2016, while serving in the U.S. Navy, he
did  not  use  marijuana  at  all;  (3)  after  his  August  2016  discharge  from  the  Navy,  he
occasionally used marijuana recreationally with friends until May 2020; and (4) from May
2020 to the date of the hearing, he had not used any illegal substance. (Tr. 22-42)
Applicant explained why he resumed his use of marijuana after his 2016 discharge
from the U.S. Navy. He was adjusting to life as a civilian, he was back with his hometown
friends, and marijuana was legal under state law where he lived. He was employed part-
time by a car dealership, he attended college classes, and he was a member of the IRR.
His  involvement  in  the  IRR  was  an  unpaid  position,  he  did  not  report  to  any  military
commander or installation or drill, he did not wear his uniform, and he was unaware during
that time that he had been granted security clearance eligibility in the event he received
orders to mobilize. He has not used marijuana since he graduated from college in May
2020.  He  stated  that  he  has  matured  and  has  no  intention  of  using  marijuana  again.
Applicant provided a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and
substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for
revocation  of  national  security  eligibility.  See  AG  ¶  26(b)(3),  infra.  He  created  strict
boundaries with his girlfriend, friends, and family members, letting them know that he will
not tolerate anyone using illegal drugs in his presence. He has also agreed to allow his
employer to conduct multiple drug tests to confirm his compliance. (Tr. 22-42; AE G)
In  May  2023,  Applicant  participated  in  a  substance  abuse  evaluation  with  a
substance  abuse  and  mental  health  professional.  He  denied  any  previous  substance
abuse treatment, positive drug tests, or drug-related criminal charges. He was diagnosed
with depression in 2018. He takes prescribed medication  daily and denied any current
depression or anxiety. Applicant took several administered tests used in the industry to
assess whether he had a substance abuse disorder. The results showed that Applicant
did not meet the criteria set forth by the American Psychiatric Association for an active
cannabis  abuse  disorder.  His  final  diagnosis  was  cannabis  use  disorder  –  mild  –  in
sustained remission. He was not referred for further treatment or counseling. (AE F; Tr.
44-45)
Personal Conduct
SOR  ¶ 2.a alleges  Applicant  falsified his marijuana use on  the April 2012 SCA,
when he denied that he had used any illegal or controlled substance within the last seven
years. Applicant stated that his recruiter convinced him to omit his marijuana usage when
he  completed  the  SCA  at  the  age  of  20.  The  recruiter  gave  him  the  impression  that
Applicant would not be able to enlist into the U.S. Navy if he disclosed his prior use of
marijuana, so he followed his recruiter’s advice. When Applicant completed his SCA in
September 2020, he was more mature and understood the importance of truthfulness.
He fully disclosed his past use of marijuana on his 2020 SCA and throughout his 2020
security investigation. (GE 1, GE 2; SOR response; Tr. 45-48, 50-53)
Character Evidence
Three coworkers, including Applicant’s manager, chief information officer and an
associate  director,  and  a  longtime  friend,  praised  his  good  character,  integrity,  and
outstanding contributions to the DOD. The general sense of their statements is that he is
exceptionally  intelligent,  candid,  dedicated,  responsible,  and  a  professional  employee.
Applicant has been promoted twice since he started his employment in August 2020, and
he has also received several performance bonuses. (Tr. 55-56; AE A, AE B, AE C, AE D,
AE E)
