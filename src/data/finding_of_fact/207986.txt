Applicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for
her current employer or a predecessor company since 2012. She earned an associate
degree  in 2022. She  is  married with a 22-year-old  child. (Transcript  (Tr.) at 19-20,  23,

Applicant  worked  as  waitress  and  manager  at  a  restaurant  from  about  2002
through  2008.  She  bought  the  restaurant  in  2008  for  about  $1.2  million.  She  paid
$150,000, and the remainder was financed by the previous owner. Her loan payments
were about $10,000 per month. The recession hit, and a new highway bypass diverted
drivers around her small town. It was difficult to maintain the restaurant. She did not pay
the  property  taxes,  and  she  did  not  pay  the  IRS  and  the  state  the  payroll  taxes  she
withheld from her employees’ wages. The loan agreement required Applicant to remain
current  with  the  property  taxes.  In  about  2012,  the  previous  owner  threatened  to
foreclose on the property and sue Applicant. She returned the restaurant to the previous
owner without court action. Applicant estimates that she paid the owner about $540,000
over  the  course  of  the  four  years  she  had  the  restaurant.  None  of  that  was  ever
reclaimed from the previous owner after the owner resold the restaurant. (Tr. at 15, 20,
28-34; Applicant’s response to SOR GE 1, 2)
Applicant accrued a number of debts from her attempt at making the  restaurant
work,  and  the  IRS and  her state  filed  tax  liens  against her, presumably  for the unpaid
payroll taxes. The state filed liens of $14,592 in April 2011; and $55,144 in September
2012. The IRS filed liens of $11,483  in August 2012; $51,967 in December 2012; and
$20,900  in  December  2012.  She  filed  a  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  case  in  2013,  and  her
dischargeable debts were discharged the same year. The bankruptcy did not affect her
unpaid taxes. (Tr. at 15-16; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1-4, 6-12)
Applicant  retained  an  attorney  to  negotiate  with  her  state.  The  attorney
negotiated  an  offer-in-compromise  with  the  state.  She  finished  paying  the  negotiated
amount in 2016, and the state tax liens were released in December 2020. (Tr. at 15-17,
20-21; Applicant’s response to SOR)
Applicant contacted  the IRS several times. She was told in about 2017 or 2018
that she owed so much in comparison to her income that the IRS considered the taxes
uncollectable. The IRS would maintain the liens on her property so that it could collect
any profit from a sale, and it would withhold  any refunds she  would otherwise receive,
but it would not actively collect the taxes unless her income significantly increased. She
was  also  told  that  the  IRS  cannot  collect  taxes  after  ten  years.  (Tr.  at  17;  Applicant’s
response to SOR)
Applicant decided not to attempt to pay the taxes, and she would wait until they
were  more  than  ten  years  old  and  uncollectable.  She  submitted  an  online  IRS  tax
account statement from the IRS obtained in October 2022. The earliest year shown was
2012,  which  reported  a  balance  of  $13,229.  The  only  other  year  with  a  balance  was
2014, with a balance of $194. (Tr. at 21-23; Applicant’s response to SOR)
In March 2023, Applicant submitted three applications to the IRS to withdraw the
three tax liens. The basis for all three was, “This debt was attached to a restaurant that
went  out  of  business  in  2012.  I  have  been  informed  by  Tax  Advocate/IRS  that  it  is
considered in unpayable status and now after more than 10 years is uncollectable.” The
IRS has not acted on the applications. (Tr. at 18, 21-23; AE A-D)
Applicant regrets not paying the payroll taxes. She stated that she has learned a
valuable  lesson  from  the  experience.  Her  finances  are  otherwise  stable.  Her  most
recent credit report lists a mortgage loan and two other accounts. She is current on all
three accounts. (Tr. at 18-19, 24-25, 28, 32-33; GE 5)
