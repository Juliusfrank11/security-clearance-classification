Applicant is a U.S. citizen by birth who grew up in a military family. His wife was
born in Taiwan to Taiwanese parents. She came to the United States in 2005 for school
and  to  study  English.  They  met  on  a  dating  website  for  singles  from  their  religion  in
2006,  and  they  married  the  same  year.  She  became  a  U.S.  citizen  in  2012  while
maintaining  her  Taiwanese  citizenship.  Their  three  children  were  born  in  the  United
States.  They  are  U.S.-Taiwanese  dual  citizens.  His  wife  has  a  business  that  helps  to
coordinate  visits  of  Taiwanese  youths  to  the  United  States  and  stay  with  American
families so they can learn English and experience our culture. She is heavily involved in
her children’s activities, and she volunteers in her church and in her community. (Tr. at

Applicant’s  father-in-law  is  deceased.  His  mother-in-law  and  his  wife’s  brother,
sister, and sister’s husband are citizens and residents of Taiwan. His wife speaks with
her mother about once a week. His mother-in-law does not speak English and Applicant
does  not  speak  Mandarin,  so  their  contact  is  limited.  She  is  retired,  but  she  owns  a
building that has an apartment on the upper floor and a factory on the lower floor. She is
financially  independent,  and  there  is  no  need  for  Applicant’s  wife  to  send  her  any
support. (Tr. at 36-37, 42, 54-56, 67; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE C, D)
Applicant believes that his wife’s brother performed mandatory military service in
Taiwan.  Applicant  has  minimal  contact  with  him  because  of  the  language  barrier.  He
has not seen him since 2016, and he does not know what he does for a living. His wife
remains close to her mother, but she is no longer close to her siblings, and they rarely
talk. (Tr. at 33-35, 42, 44, 56-60, 66; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE C, D)
Applicant has minimal contact with his wife’s sister and her husband because of
the language barrier. Their children attended college in the United States at a university
close  to  where  Applicant  and  his  wife  lived  before  Applicant’s  family  moved  for  his
current  job.  He  met  his  wife’s  sister  in  Taiwan,  and  he  met  her  husband  when  he
traveled  from  Taiwan  with  his  son  to  the  university  in  the  United  States.  Applicant
believes his brother-in-law may work for the Taiwanese equivalent of the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service. (Tr. at 26-32, 42, 44, 49, 60-65, 68; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE

Applicant  expressed  his  undivided  allegiance  to  the  United  States.  He  credibly
