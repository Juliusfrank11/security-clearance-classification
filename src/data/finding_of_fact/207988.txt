The SOR alleges five delinquent debts totaling approximately $50,002, including
delinquent student-loans totaling $42,262 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.b), credit accounts charged off
for $7,287 (SOR ¶¶ 1.c-1.d), and one credit account in collection for $453 (SOR ¶ 1.e) In
Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d,
with explanation. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 41-year-old system administrator employed by a defense contractor
since April 2016. He worked in information technology (IT) for two other companies from
February  2012  to  April  2016,  and  as  a  logistics  technician  from  May  2011  to  January
2012.  Prior to  May 2012,  he  worked as  a  seasonal laborer.  He  was  unemployed  from
January 2012 to February 2012, and from October 2009 to May 2010. He held a security
clearance in 2013. (GE 1; Tr. 11, 29-33)
Applicant attended a technical institute from December 2009 to September 2011
and earned an associate degree. He married in July 2006 and has four children, ages 21,
16, 14, and 12. (GE 1; AE A-B; Tr. 32-34, 39)
Applicant attributes his financial problems to the cost of maintaining a family of six,
his  unemployment  and  underemployment,  his  wife’s  unemployment,  health,  and
underemployment.  (Answer;  GE  1  at  43-55;  Tr.  29-30,  39-43,  48,  51-52,  61-62)  He
prioritized debts and focused on paying his mortgage, car loan, and utilities. (Tr. 39-40)
The evidence concerning the specific SOR allegations is summarized below.
SOR  ¶¶   1.a-1.b:  student   loans   placed   for  collection  of   $42,262.  Applicant
admitted  each  allegation  explaining  that  the  student  loans  were  in  forbearance  under
COVID-19 relief measures. (Answer; Tr. 25) He disclosed the delinquent loans in his June
2020 SCA. (GE 1 at 44-45, 54) He testified that he incurred the loans while attending a
technical school and made required payments until about 2012. After he fell behind on
payments  due  to  underemployment,  his  forbearance  request  was  granted.  He  learned
that his student loans might be forgiven in about 2009 and joined a class action lawsuit
against  the  school  in  2015.  (Tr.  34-38;  AE  B)  He  adopted  a  “wait  and  see”  approach
regarding  payments  on  the  loans  because  of  the  lawsuit,  pending  action  by  the
Department of Education, and because his income was not sufficient to pay his student
loans and household bills. (Tr. 37-41) He paid off one of the smaller student loans and
received a small payment from the class action lawsuit. (Tr. 38, 41)
In August 2022, the Department of Education announced that it would discharge
student loans received to attend the school. (GE 7) Applicant submitted evidence that his
student  loans  were  discharged  in  November  2022,  because  of  misconduct  and
misrepresentations by the school. (AE A; Tr. 34-41, 67-68) These debts are resolved.
SOR ¶  1.c:  home  improvement  loan charged off for $5,050.  Applicant denied
the allegation in his Answer, noting that he had agreed to a payment plan and had made
payments  that  reduced  the  balance  to  $4,147.  He  submitted  evidence  of  payments
totaling about $1,688 from October 2021 to March 2022. (Answer) He testified that he
entered a payment plan in 2020 or 2021, that he made regular payments  that reduced
the balance to about $2,589, and that he would continue making payments until the debt
was paid. (Tr. 41-44, 68-69) He submitted evidence of additional payments totaling $900
from January 2023 to June 2023. (AE C) Credit reports show the loan was charged off
for $7,485, that the balance was $5,050 in January 2022, and that as of June 23, 2023,
the balance was $2,589. (GE 3 at 2, GE 2 at 4) This debt is being resolved.
SOR  ¶   1.d:  loan  charged  off  for  $2,237.   Applicant  denied  the  allegation,
submitted evidence that he had agreed to a payment plan, and noted that his payments
had reduced the balance to $1,637. (Answer) He reported the debt and payment plan in
his  June  2020  SCA.  (GE  1  at  52-53)  He  testified  that  he  had  been  making  monthly
payments  of  $100  since  2019,  that  he  had  reduced  the  balance  to  $437,  and  would
continue making payments until the debt was paid. (Tr. 21, 45-46) He submitted evidence
of payments totaling $1,465 from January to June 2023. (AE C) Credit reports show the
loan was charged off for $3,596, that the balance was $2,237 in January 2022, and that
as of June 23, 2023, the balance  was $437. (GE 3 at 3, GE 2 at 8) This debt is being
resolved.
SOR  ¶   1.e:  credit  card  placed   for  collection  of   $453.  Applicant  admitted  the
allegation  in  his  Answer,  noting  that  he  was  working  with  the  creditor  to  settle  the
remaining  balance.  He  reported  the  debt  in  his  June  2020  SCA.  (GE  1  at  50-51)  He
testified that the debt remained outstanding, that he intended to pay it off, and that the
creditor rejected his February 2023 settlement offer. (Tr. 46-47) Credit reports reflect the
account was in collection for $454 in July 2020 and for $453 in January 2022. (GE 4 at
14, GE 3 at 3) This debt is not resolved.
In his June 2020 SCA, Applicant disclosed approximately $62,000 of delinquent
debt including the debts alleged in the SOR, and delinquent debts not alleged in the SOR
(Non-SOR)  totaling  about  $8,200.  (GE  1  at  43-55)  He  earned  $45,000  to  $55,000
annually from July 2013 to April 2016, and his gross annual salary increased from $55,000
in 2016 to $108,000 in 2023. (Tr. 31-32)
Applicant’s  credit  report dated  June 23, 2023,  reflects  two delinquent  Non-SOR
debts including a past-due mortgage, and a telecommunications account in collection for
$926. (GE 2 at 4-5, 7-8) He submitted evidence that mortgage payments he had timely
submitted in June 2023 totaling $2,994 were not reflected in his June 2023 credit report.
(GE 2 at 5; AE F) He testified that the telecommunications debt resulted from a change
in providers, that his previous provider refused to accept phones in return, and that he
intended to settle the debt. (Tr. 49) He provided a budget but has not received financial
counseling. (AE G; Tr. 71)
I  found  Applicant's  responses  and  demeanor  at  the  hearing  to  be  credible  and
consistent with  his SCA, Answer and  someone who was reliably telling the truth.  After
reviewing  the  entire  record,  I  find  that  his  hearing  testimony  is  corroborated  by
documentary evidence submitted by the  government and his own exhibits. He credibly
responded to all questions and was keenly aware of the significance of resolving his debts
and establishing his financial responsibility.
