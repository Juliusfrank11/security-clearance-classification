Applicant has a  history  of tax problems, including  not filing  his  federal income  tax
returns  when   they   were  due   and   not   paying   his   federal   income   taxes.   His  tax   issues
started   in  about   2013   when   he   was  working   overseas.  His  second   wife   was   a   foreign
national, and  he  supported  her  and  her family throughout the  immigration  process.  He
had   health   issues,  his   mother  passed   away,  and   he   was   laid   off   a   job   in  2013.   He
withdrew  about  $30,000   from   his  401(k)  retirement  account  for  his  mother-in-law’s
surgery and  about  another $80,000  for  living  expenses.  He  did  not  properly account  for
the  tax consequences.  He was  overwhelmed  and  did  not file his tax returns.  (Tr. at  37-
