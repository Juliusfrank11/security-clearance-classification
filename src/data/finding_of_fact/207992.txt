Applicant  is  41  years  old.  He  has  a  tenth-grade  education.  He  married  in  2006
and divorced in 2011. He  married his current wife in 2019.  He has a 19-year-old child
and four stepchildren. (Tr. at 53, 58; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1)
Applicant  and  his  wife  own  a  truck  and  are  drivers  for  a  company  sponsoring
them  for  a  security  clearance  so  that  they  can  transport  materials  for  the  DOD.
Applicant and his wife are independent contractors (1099 employees) for the company.
His first wife managed their finances while they were married, and his current wife does
the same. (Tr. at 29, 53; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  has  a  history  of  tax  problems,  including  unpaid  taxes  and  unfiled  tax
returns.  He  filed  his  2013  federal  income  tax  return  on  time,  and  a  $496  refund  was
withheld and applied to a non-IRS debt. In 2015, the IRS assessed $4,375 in additional
taxes  for  tax  year  2013  and  later  added  penalties  and  interest  for  late  payment.  In
February 2016, the IRS withheld $1,244 from what would have been a refund from tax
year 2015 and transferred it to his 2013 taxes.  He owed about $5,529 for 2013 before
he  made  a  $200  payment  in  January  2023;  two  $300  payments  in  April  2023;  and  a
$1,000 payment in May 2023. As of May 15, 2023, he owed $3,729 in taxes, penalties,
and  interest  for  2013. He  made  $2,500  and  $1,240  payments  in  June  2023  to  pay  all
taxes, penalties, and interest for 2013. (Tr. at 39-44; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE
1-4; AE A, C)
Applicant  has  not  filed  federal  income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2016  through
2021.  He  has  an  extension  for  tax  year  2022.  Applicant  and  his  wife  stated  that  they
gave  their  documents  to  a  tax  preparer  in  about  2017.  The  tax  preparer  held  their
documents  for  about  three  years,  and  they  thought  she  was  filing  their  tax  returns  for
them, but she was not. As truck drivers, they spend most of their time on the road, and
they  did  not  notice  that  his  returns  were  not  filed.  When  they  finally  realized,  the  tax
preparer  stalled  them.  Finally,  in  about  2020  or  2021,  they  went  to  her  home  and
retrieved their documents. (Tr. at 12-14, 28-34; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1-3)
Applicant  reported  his child  support arrearages  and  his failure to file  his  federal
income tax returns from 2017 to 2020 on a Questionnaire for National Security Positions
(SF 86) that he submitted in November 2021. He wrote that his tax preparer did not file
the  returns;  he  just  got  the  paperwork  back  from  her;  and  that  he  was  looking  for
someone to file the returns. (GE 1)
Applicant was interviewed  for his background investigation in January 2022. He
discussed  his  child  support  arrearages  and  unfiled  tax  returns.  He  stated  that  he  was
still  attempting  to  find  an  accountant  to  prepare  and  file  his  income  tax  returns.  He
hoped to have all the returns filed by the end of 2022. (GE 2)
Tax  returns  for truck  drivers  can  be  complicated  and  tedious.  Applicant  and  his
wife  had  a  difficult  time  finding  an  accountant  or  tax  preparer  who  had  the  requisite
expertise  and  was  willing  to  work  on  their  returns.  They  retained  a  tax  professional  in
July  2022,  but  their  tax  returns  are  challenging.  He  submitted  copies  of  spreadsheets
showing expenses for fuel, food, and lodging. It was the tax professional who informed
Applicant that he owed taxes for 2013. Applicant’s wife testified that she believed that at
least some of the back returns had been filed. She was mistaken. The returns have not
yet been filed. (Tr. at 14-21; 29-31, 35-38; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 3; AE A)
The tax professional wrote in July 2023:
Due   to   the   amount  of   time   it  requires   to   accurately  report   and   file   their
taxes it is taking our firm longer than expected to complete them. Currently
our  firm   is   diligently   working   on   getting   previous  years   W2’s   and   1099’s
from   prior  employment  for  both   [Applicant’s   wife]   and   [Applicant].   In   the
meantime,  we  are   aggressively  working   through   the   previous   year’s
receipts and  reconciling  them. Our goal is to  wrap  up  all  the  returns  by the
end   of   this   year.   Tax   year  2019   is   almost   wrapped   up,   however,  the
previous  years  for  [Applicant]  are  still  being  processed/worked. Thank you
for your patience  and understanding at this time.  (AE A)
A  2016  IRS  wage  and  tax  transcript  shows  that  $3,320  was  withheld  from
Applicant’s  wages.  IRS  account  transcripts  for  2017  through  2019  and  2022  do  not
report  any  funds  withheld  from  pay  nor  any  other  payments.  Transcripts  for  2020  and
2021 were not submitted in evidence. His wife admitted that the last time they paid any
federal income taxes was a “long time ago.” (Tr. at 22; GE 5)
In  July  2013,  Applicant  was  ordered  by  the  court  as  part  of  his  divorce  to  pay
$700 monthly in child support. He did not always pay the full amount owed. In August
2022, the court determined that the total amount of child support accrued from August
1, 2013, until August 2022 was $76,300, plus $4,348 in interest. Applicant paid a total of
$46,807  during  that  period,  leaving  an  arrearage  of  $33,841.  (Applicant’s  response  to
SOR; GE 1, 2, 5; AE B)
Child  support records indicate that Applicant made 31  payments of $180  ($5,580)
between   May   20,  2016,  and   January  5,  2017;   five   payments  totaling   $260  between
February  2,  2017,  and   May  3,  2017;  eight   payments  of  $183.46   ($1,467.68),  eight
payments of  $189.23  ($1,513.84),  and   54 payments  of  $192.69   ($10,405.26)   between
May  30,  2017, and  May 21,  2019;  six payments totaling  $880 in  October  and  November
2019;  63  payments  of  $40   ($2,520)   between   July  2020   and   September  2021;   12
payments totaling $3,050 from March 2022 through September 2022; a $200 payment
on  May  4,  2023,  a  $1,000  payment  on  May  5,  2023;  and  a  $500  payment  on  July  5,
2023. The total amount paid from May 2016 through May 2023 was $27,376. His $700
monthly child support obligation for seven years equals $58,800 ($700 x 84). (Tr. at 56-
57; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 5; AE B)
Applicant  and  his  wife  stated  that  the  child  support  payments  were  affected  by
COVID and not having enough work. They stated that the child support agency told him
to pay whatever he could afford, which is why there were $40 payments. His child is 19
years  old  and  not  in  high  school  or  college,  so  the  payment  for  child  support  should
cease,  and  all  of  the  payments  will  go  toward  the  arrearages.  He  asserted  that  he  is
committed  to  filing  the  back  tax  returns,  paying  whatever  taxes  are  owed,  and
continuing to pay his child support. (Tr. at 26-28, 57-58; Applicant’s response to SOR;
