expenses when her health insurance did not start as planned with her new employer. (Tr.

to make the monthly payments that she has now been making. She would make random
payments on debts when funds were available. (Tr. at 28-29 and AE F.) With her 2020
separation and receiving  a veteran’s disability rating in  November 2022, which entitled
her  to  monthly  disability  payments,  she  had  the  additional  income  to  make  monthly
payments on her debts. (Tr. at 27-29.) The regular debt payments she initiated coincide
with her increase in income in November 2022. (Tr. at 29.)
