Applicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security
clearance.  Admitted  facts  are  adopted  and  incorporated  by  reference.  Additional
findings of fact follow.
Background
Applicant married in March 2004 and divorced in in September 2005. (GE 1) He
has  no  children  from  this  marriage.  He  remarried  in  March  2012  and  divorced  in  May
2017.  He  has  two  children  from  this  marriage  (ages  15  and  nine).  (GE  1;  Tr.  22)  He
remarried  for  his  third  marriage  in  July  2017  and  separated  in  April  2020  without  any
children from the marriage. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 49) Currently, Applicant is waiting for his third
spouse  to  file  for  divorce.  (GE  4)  He  does  not  know  of  the  whereabouts  of  his  third
spouse, and he has no known financial obligations to her. (GE 4)
Applicant  earned  a  high  school  diploma  in  June  2001.  He  enlisted  in  the  Air
Force (AF) in 2002 and served 11 years of active duty before receiving an honorable AF
discharge in September 2013. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 21)
Since  October  2018,  Applicant  has  been  employed  by  his  current  employer.
(GEs  2-3;  Tr.  20)  Previously,  he  worked
for  other  employers.  He  reported
unemployment  between  September  2013  and  September  2014,  and  between
September  2017  and  December  2018.  (GEs  2-3)  Applicant  held  a  security  clearance
while in the Air Force. (GE 2)
Applicant’s  finances
Between  2017  and  2021,  Applicant  accumulated  a  number  of  delinquent
consumer  debts.  (GEs  5-6)  He  attributed  his  debt  delinquencies  to  losing  his  job  in
September  2017  and  becoming  depressed  with  suicidal  symptoms  that  required  30
days of inpatient hospitalization to stabilize him. (GE 2)
Between  April  2007  and  February  2016,  Applicant  resided  with  his  then-fiance
who  in  2012  became  his  second  spouse.  (GE  2)  For  the  first  four  years  of  their
relationship,  Applicant  shared  half  of  his  fiance’s  mortgage  expenses.  (GE  2)
Separating  from  his  spouse  in  February  2016,  Applicant  briefly  resided  in  a  State  A
apartment  (February  2016  to  July  2016)  before  moving  on  to  State  B  without  any
evidence of voluntary spousal and child support to his second spouse of four years and
two small children. (GE 2)
What  steps  Applicant’s  second  spouse  pursued  to  induce  Applicant  to  provide
voluntary  spousal  and  child  support  prior  to  their  May  2017  divorce  is  not  fully
developed in the record. Some evidence of his possible post-divorce voluntary efforts to
provide  monetary  support  to  his  wife  and  children  is  reflected  in  his  2021  personal
subject  interview  (PSI)  acknowledgements  that  he  became  delinquent  on  his  child
support “payment of $10,000”  to his former spouse and children  “after he lost his job.”
(GE  3)  any  pre-divorce  child  and  spousal  discussions  he  may  have  had  with  send
spouse is not evidenced in the record.
Credit  reports  confirm  Applicant’s  accumulation  of  five  delinquent  consumer
accounts between 2018 and 2021 as follows: SOR ¶ 1.a (for $3,932); 1.b (for $556); 1.d
(for $1,634); 1.e (for $1,021); and 1.f  (for $6,558). (GEs 5-6) While  Applicant  disputed
one of these listed SOR debts (SOR ¶ 1.a), he provided no documentary support for his
dispute  of  the  debt.  None  of  the  remaining  consumer  debts  listed  in  the  SOR  are
supported  by  any  documentation  or  other  corroborating  evidence  of  payment  or
payment arrangements.
Income   withholding   orders  (IWOs)  were   issued   by  State   B’s  child   support
services agency  to  Applicant’s employer in  October and  December 2018,  respectively,
in  accordance   with   an   issued   2016   court   order  in   State   A   to   withhold   from   Applicant’s
monthly  pay  portions   of  his  income   to   cover  current   and   arrears  child   and   spousal
support.  (AEs  A-B) The  2018  IWOs  issued  by  the  State  B  child  support services  agency
directed  Applicant’s  employer to  deduct  monthly amounts  as follows: $1,413.90  a month
for  current  child   support;   $468.70   a   month   for  past-due   child   support-(arrears  greater
than   12   weeks);  $23.55   a   month   for   current  cash   medical  support;   $7.98   a   month   for
past-due   medical  support;  and   $1,516.16   a   month   for  past-due   spousal  support,   for  a
total amount  withholding  of $3,928 a  month.  (GEs 1-6  and AEs A-B; Tr. 18)
By  all  accounts,  portions  of  Applicant’s  monthly  income  have  been  regularly
withheld  by  his  employer  between  October  2018  and  February  2023  in  partial
compliance with the 2018 IWOs. (GEs 1-2) Asked at hearing whether spousal and child
support  have  been  withheld  from  his  monthly  pay,  Applicant  responded  in  the
affirmative.  (Tr.  27-28,  42-3)  Applicant’s  acknowledgements  were  credible  and  were
accepted  by  the  Government  in  closing.  (Tr.  48)  Because  Applicant’s  monthly
withholding  has  been  consistently  less  than  what  was  prescribed  in  the  IWOs,  his
withheld payments have never come close to the withholding amounts prescribed in the
2018  IWOs.  (Tr.  26)  As  a  result,  reductions  in  the  principal  spousal  and  child  support
balance have not been achieved. (GEs 5-6; Tr. 41) Credit reports confirm that between
2021 and 2022, the principal balance on Applicant’s spousal and child support arrears
increased from a $130,000 range to a $146,000 range. (GEs 5-6) Without any credited
reduction  in  the  reported  balance  owing,  the  principal  balance  of  the  arrears  can  be
expected to increase over time.
Applicant’s  efforts  between  2019  and  2022  to  meet  with  child  support  services
personnel “to have the amount owed reduced and my child support order modified,” to
include reductions in his monthly child support withholding and overall principal balance,
were  never  successful.  (GE  1;  Tr.  28)  And,  meeting  requests  by  the  State  B  child
support  services  agency  to  discuss  Applicant’s  pay  status  could  never  be  agreed  on
with Applicant. (Tr. 27)
A   revised   IWO   was   issued   to   Applicant’s   employer in  February 2023.   (GE   7) In
this IWO,  Applicant’   s employer was  directed  to  withhold  portions of Applicant’s pay in
accordance   with   a  revised   withholding   schedule,   Applicant’s  employer  was   directed   to
withhold   monthly  amounts   from   Applicant’s  pay   as   follows:  $1,413.90   a   month   for
current child  support; $180.68  a  month  for past-due  child  support  (arrears greater than
12   weeks); $23.55   a   month   for   current   cash   medical  support;  $4.65   a   month   for  past-
due   cash  medical  support,  and   $314.67   a   month   for   past-due   spousal  support,  for  a
total amount withheld of $1,937.45 a month. (GE 7)
Currently,  Applicant’s  employer  withholds  between  $150  to  $200  bi-weekly  (still
50 % of his take-home pay) to cover the withholding criteria se by State B’s withholding
orders.  (Tr.  40)  Based  on  the  evidence  presented,  Applicant  and  his  employer  have
complied  with  been  in  compliance  with  the  issued  February  2023  IW0.  Applicant
currently makes $20 an hour, which represents a increase over his hourly pay in 2018
(only $15 an hour). (Tr. 21) In addition to his hourly wages, he receives a 70 % disability
from the Veterans Administration  (VA) that amounts to  $2,000 a month. While he was
unemployed  for  a  year  after  being  “written  off  of  his  contract”  in  September  2017,  he
made no child support payments; even though he received notices of the IWOs from the
child support agencies in both State A and State B. (GE 2; Tr. 24)
Applicant’s  efforts  to  enforce  his  child  visiting  rights  with  his  ex-spouse  and
mother of his two children have not been successful. She has consistently denied him
visiting privileges with his children. (Tr. 46) Further, he has had no communications with
his  ex-spouse  about  enlisting  her  support  and  assistance  in  his  efforts  to  obtain  child
support reductions. (Tr. 45)
Applicant currently rents his home ($1,000 a month) and expends $840 a month
on an expensive  vehicle he purchased in 2019, which he characterized as his “dream
car.” (GEs 5-6; Tr.30-31, 38) He is in compliance with his payment obligations with his
current credit card accounts. (Tr. 39)
By virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court
in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), “no one has a ‘right’ to a
