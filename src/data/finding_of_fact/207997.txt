Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  allegations  with  explanations.  His  admissions  are
adopted as findings of fact. After a careful review of the pleadings and evidence, I make
the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  54  years old.  He  has  worked  for  a  defense  contractor  since  March
2021, as a technical specialist. From March 2020 to March 2021, he was unemployed.
From  2016  to  2020,  he  worked  in  commercial  information  systems.  He  holds  two
master’s  degrees.  He  gave  conflicting  information  regarding  his  marital  status.  In  his
security clearance application (SCA), from April 2021, he stated he first married in 1994
and  divorced  in  1999.  During  his  hearing  testimony,  he  stated  the  date  of  this  first
marriage were from 2000 to 2014. On his SCA, he stated his second marriage began in
June  2016,  but  he  testified  that  he  was  married  for  the  second  time  in  May  2022.  He
has two sons from his first marriage, ages 19 and12. (Tr. 5, 23-24, 34; GE 1)
Financial Considerations (Guideline F)
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged Applicant: (1) failed to file his 2014 to 2020
federal and  state  income  tax  returns,  as  required  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.b);  and  (2)  owed  the
federal government approximately $28,733 in delinquent taxes for tax year 2012 (SOR
¶ 1.c).
Applicant’s tax difficulties started in approximately 2012. He was running a family
business that had about five employees. He attempted to claim a significant amount of
business  deductions  on  his  personal  federal  tax  return  for  2012,  which  the  IRS
ultimately  disallowed. This  resulted  in  the  large  tax  debt  stated  in  SOR  ¶  1.c.  He  also
claimed that several personal circumstances contributed to him not being able to file his
federal and state tax returns for years 2014 to 2020. Those circumstances included the
failure  of  his  business,  the  death  of  his  father,  and  his  divorce.  He  admitted  that  a
contributing factor to his non-filing of the returns was his not knowing how to deal with
the 2012 tax debt and its implications on the succeeding years’ tax returns. He did not
think  he  could  file  subsequent  federal  tax  returns  if  he  had  not  filed  an  earlier  year’s
return.  He  consulted  with  a  tax  professional  about  this  and  was  told  to  file  all  his
delinquent returns even if he had not filed an earlier return. Applicant failed to follow this
advice  because  he  could  not  afford  a  tax  professional  to  prepare  and  file  the  unfiled
returns. (Tr. 27-29, 35-36; SOR answer)
The status of the SOR tax issues is as follows:
the
IRS
in  September  2022.  He  supplied
SOR  ¶¶   1.a-1.c   (non-filed  2014-2019   federal  and  state  income   tax   return;
and federal  tax  debt  of  $24,733). Federal returns:  Applicant testified  that  he  hired  a
tax  professional  who   prepared   his  2014-2021   federal  tax  returns   (his  delinquent  2021
return  was not   alleged   and   will   not   be   considered  for   disqualification   purposes),  which
the   supporting
were   received   by
documentation  showing  the  filed  returns.  State  returns:  Applicant testified  that he  filed
all  his state  tax returns for years 2014-2020  in August or September 2022. He  did not
provide  copies  of  those  filed  state  returns,  but he  provided  a  document from  his state’s
Department   of  Revenue,  which   shows   that   he   filed   his  2022   state   return   and   it  was
received   in  April  2023.  It   also  shows  an   overall   zero  balance   on   Applicant’s  state   tax
account.   The   evidence   supports   a   finding   that   Applicant   filed   his   2014-2020   state   tax
returns in  August  or September  2022. Federal tax  debt  of  $24,733  for tax  year 2012.
Applicant testified  that he  was  working  with  the  IRS  to pay his federal tax debt, which he
thought  now  approached   $30,000.  He  provided   documentation   showing   he   completed
an  IRS  Form  433-F  in  April 2023,  in furtherance  of his  request for a  payment plan. He
also provided  a  document showing  the  IRS  confirmed  receiving  one  payment of $1,366
on  May 16, 2023. He did not provide  an  overall  payment plan.  (Tr. 29-30,  32,  42; AE  B-
E)
Drug Use (Guideline  H)
Under  Guideline  H,  the  SOR  alleged  Applicant  used  marijuana  with  varying
frequency from about 2010 to 2022 (SOR ¶ 2.a).
Applicant  admitted  using  marijuana  at  various  times  from  about  2010  to  2022,
including after he completed his security clearance application (SCA) in April 2021. He
explained that he used marijuana because of a degenerative back condition that caused
him extreme pain. He began experiencing this condition in approximately 1997 or 1998.
He has been receiving medical care for the condition since that time. In 2010, he moved
to  a  state  where  use  of  medical  marijuana  is  legal  under  state  law.  He  began  using
marijuana for his back pain and found that it helped.  He stopped using it from 2019 to
2020  because  the  marijuana  caused  him  to  become  sleepy  frequently  and  he  did  not
like that effect on him. In October 2021, after he began working for his current employer
and completed his SCA, his back pain worsened and he began using marijuana again.
He continued to use marijuana in February and June 2022 when he experienced back-
pain  flareups.  Applicant  testified  he  was  unaware  of  his  employer’s  drug  policy  which
prohibited use of marijuana by employees even if such use was authorized under state
law.  He  admitted  that  he  did  not  inform  his  employer  about  his  use  of  marijuana.  He
provided a copy of a drug test result from April 2023 showing a negative result for the
presence  of  marijuana  in  his  system.  He  also  provided  a  copy  of  a  prescription  he
received in April 2023 for medication to relieve his back pain. (Tr. 25-27, 33; GE 1-2 (pp.
18-24); AE F)
Applicant  produced  a  character  letter  from  a  work  supervisor.  The  supervisor
believes  Applicant  is  a  loyal  and  dedicated  employee  who  is  dedicated  to  protect
national  security.  The  letter  does  not  state  whether  the  author  is  aware  of  the
circumstances of Applicant’s case. (AE G).
