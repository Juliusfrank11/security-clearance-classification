Applicant  is  a  55-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor  for  whom  he  has
worked  since  January  2013.  He  was  married  from  1986  until  he  divorced  in  2008.  He
remarried in 2010. He has four adult children and five adult stepchildren. (Item 2)
In the SOR, the Government alleged that Applicant failed to timely file his federal
income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2016,  2017,  2018,  2019,  and  2021,  despite  being
required to do so. It also alleged that he failed to timely file his state income tax returns
for the same tax years, as well as for the 2020 tax year. Finally, it alleged that he was
indebted  to  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  for  delinquent  federal  taxes  in  the
amount  of  $5,797  for  tax  year  2020.  In  the  Answer,  Applicant  admitted  all  the  SOR
allegations with additional comments. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of
fact.  The  SOR  allegations  are  established  by  his  admissions  and  the  Governmentâ€™s
exhibits included with the FORM. (Items 1-4)
Applicant  filed  his  late  2016,  2017,  2018,  and  2019  federal  income  tax  returns
with the IRS in July 2021. He also filed his late 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 state
income tax returns in July 2021. He filed these income tax returns after he submitted his
May  2021  Questionnaire
Investigations  Processing  (SF  86).  He  provided
documentary corroboration of these filings in the form of signed and unsigned copies of
his  relevant  income  tax  returns.  Most  of  the  income  tax  returns  were  prepared  by  a
professional tax preparer. He claimed that he filed his late federal and state income tax
returns for tax year 2021, without providing corroborating evidence. (Items 1-4)

Applicant claimed that he resolved his delinquent federal taxes for tax year 2020.
A November 2022 letter from the IRS shows that a portion of his 2018 tax year refund
was  applied  to  his  2020  tax  delinquency,  reducing  his  2018  refund  to  $9.52.  The  IRS
would not have provided this refund if he still owed delinquent taxes for tax year 2020.
Therefore,  I  find  that  he  resolved  his  2020  tax  year  delinquency  in  November  2022.
(Items 1-4)
Applicant  claimed  that  he  did  not  timely  file  the  aforementioned  income  tax
returns because he was depressed after separating from his wife, because of laziness,
and because of the COVID-19 pandemic. His granddaughter passed away in 2021, and
he  claimed  that  her  death  caused  him  to  miss  the  deadline  for  filing  his  2020  state
income tax returns. He claimed that he will comply with his income tax return filings in
the  future.  In  April  2022,  he  submitted  a  personal  financial  statement  showing  that  he
has  a  surplus  of  about  $375  after  his  expenses  are  paid  at  the  end  of  each  month.
