After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I
make the following findings of fact:
Applicant is 47 years old and a high school graduate with some college credits. He
was married from June 1995 to June 2005. He has 19 year-old twins from that marriage;
they do not live with him. He remarried in June 2005 and has two children ages 12 and
15 from that marriage; they reside with him. He has two adult stepchildren. (Items 2 and
3.) Except for a brief period of unemployment from January 2014 to March 2014, he has
worked full-time since July 2011. From February 2020 to the present, he has worked for
a defense contractor. (Item 2.)
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant (1) is indebted to the Internal
Revenue  Service  for  $3,352  for  tax  year  2014;  and  (2)  failed  to  file  state  income  tax
returns for tax years 2014 and 2015. (Item 1S.) He admitted those allegations. (Item 1A.)
During Applicant’s October and November 2021 personal subject interviews (PSI),
he discussed his financial matters. He identified seven accounts with nominal balances
ranging from $61 to $864 totaling $2,404. (Item 3.) Those accounts are not reported on
his January 3, 2023 credit report and are not alleged in the SOR. (Items 1S and 6.)
Applicant also discussed three significant debts. The first was a child support debt
for $32,000. In May 2015 he began a court-approved payment plan and paid off that debt
in February 2021. (Item 3.) That debt was not alleged in the SOR and was not reported
on the Government’s credit reports. (Items 1S, 5 and 6.)
The  second  was  a  debt  Applicant  owed  to  the  state  department  of  revenue  for
$14,146 of taxes for tax years 2014 and 2015. In 2015, he started a payment plan. He
was on that plan as of his PSI. That debt was not alleged in the SOR and was not reported
on the Government’s credit reports. (Items 1S, 5 and 6.)
The  Government’s  interrogatories  asked  Applicant  to  provide  state  tax  account
transcripts (or the equivalent) for years 2014 and 2015. He  responded: “I was told  that
[the state] does not issue Tax Account Transcripts at all. Only the IRS does. I requested
[IRS] copies for the years in question (2014 & 2015) online.” He attached IRS transcripts
for tax years 2014 and 2015. They shed no light on his state tax filings. (Item 4.)
The third was a $14,434 debt for an auto loan Applicant took out in May 2015. In
2017, he changed jobs and did not have enough money to make his payments. The auto
was repossessed in July 2017 and sold, which left a balance due of $7,000. He began a
payment plan on November 19, 2021, of $300 a week to pay the balance. (Item 3.)  This
account was reported in collection on the Government’s October 2021 credit report. (Item
5.) It was not reported on the Government’s January 3, 2023  credit report and was not
alleged in the SOR. (Items 1S and 6.)
Applicant’s most recent credit report shows 10 accounts PAYS AS AGREED with
zero past-due amounts and no tax delinquencies or tax liens. (Item 6.) His earlier credit
report does not show any tax delinquencies or tax liens. (Item 5.) Other than Applicant’s
admissions to  the  two  SOR allegations, there is no  other record support for the  SOR’s
two allegations. (Item 1A.)
Law and Policies
It  is  well  established  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.  As  the
that  security
Supreme  Court  held,  “the  clearly  consistent  standard
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.” Department of the Navy
v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).
indicates
The adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the
complexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction
with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s overarching
adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG ¶ 2(a),
the  entire  process  is  a  conscientious  scrutiny  of  a  number  of  variables  known  as  the
“whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all  available,  reliable
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a
decision.  A2(b)  requires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for
access  to  classified  information  will  be  resolved  in  favor  of  the  national  security.”  In
reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical,
and based  on  the  evidence  contained  in the  record. Likewise,  I have  avoided  drawing
inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture.
Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.14,  the  Government  must  present  evidence  to  establish
controverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  an  “applicant  is
responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or
mitigate  facts  admitted  by  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel,  and  has  the
ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.”
A  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary
relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship
transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government
reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to
classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk
that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.
Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential,
rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.
