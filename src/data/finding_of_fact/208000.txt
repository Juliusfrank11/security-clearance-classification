Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.k  with  explanations.  His  admissions  are
incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  34  years  old  and  married.  In  2013,  he  enrolled  in  ITT  Tech  and
earned  his  associate’s  degree  in  2015.  Unable  to  find  employment  in  his  field  of
expertise,  he  worked  a  variety  of  jobs,  including  as  a  baggage  handler,  a  car  service
agent and a security guard. By 2019, he was not making enough money to pay all of his
bills. That same year, he experienced a brief period of unemployment when he cared for
his  sick  father.  In  2020,  Applicant  started  working  with  his  current  employer  in  a
technical field related to his degree. (Items 3, 6)
Applicant did not list any delinquent debts in his October 2020 SCA. However, he
voluntarily  disclosed  several  delinquent  debts  in  detail  during  his  January  2021
background interview. (Items 3, 6)
SOR  ¶¶  1.a   ($9,238), 1.b  ($5,741),   1.c   ($4,989),   1.d   ($3,997), 1.e   ($3,950), 1.f
($3,487),   1.h   ($951)  and  1.i   ($877)  were  all  past-due  federal  student  loans  with  DoE
that Applicant opened in 2013 and 2014 for his studies at ITT Tech. The debts totaled
about  $33,000.  During  his  interview,  Applicant  stated  he  had  not  made  any  payments
on  the  loans  since  graduating  in  2015  and  he  had  not  taken  any  subsequent  steps  to
repay  the  debt.  However,  he  intended  on  setting  up  a  payment  plan  as  soon  as
possible. (Items 4-6)
In  his  March  2022  Response  to  DOHA’s  Interrogatories,  Applicant  included  a
DoE Loan Rehabilitation application, dated that same month, and stated he was in the
process  of making payment  arrangements  on  the  student  loans.  There  is  no  evidence
that  he  submitted  any  payments  under  this  plan.  The  most  recent  credit  report  in  the
record, from April 2022, reflects that the loans were in collection status with DoE as the
creditor. (Items 4, 5)
In his Answer, Applicant admitted all of the  delinquent student loans and stated
that  a  payment  plan  with  DoE  was  pending.  He  did  not  include  any  evidence  of
payments. (Item 2)
However, in August 2022, DoE issued a press release stating it was discharging
all  student  loans  relating  to  ITT  Tech  that  originated  from  2005  through  2016.  In  the
press  release,  DoE  recited  the  troubled  history  of  ITT  Tech,  specifically  noting  that
ITT Tech  had misled  students  about  the  quality  of  their programs  for years in  order to
profit from the federal student loan programs.  This announcement followed a  series of
lawsuits,  settlements  and  other  remedial  actions  taken  by  DoE  against  ITT  Tech.  In
January  2023,  Applicant  received  notice  from  DoE  that  his  student  loans  were
discharged as part of these efforts. (AN I; AX A)
SOR  ¶   1.g  ($1,453)   is  a  charged-off  credit  card  account.  During  his  interview,
Applicant disclosed that this account became delinquent in 2019 and that he intended to
satisfy  it.  In  his  March  2022  Response  to  DOHA’s  Interrogatories,  he  stated  that  the
account  had  been  paid  and  that  a  payment  confirmation  was  attached.  In  support,  he
produced  two  documents  confirming  the  settlement  of  another  credit  card  account  in
collection  that  was  not  alleged  in  the  SOR.  In  his  Answer  and  in  his  subsequent
submission, he included a copy of one of these documents and again claimed the debt
had  been  paid.  However,  neither  the  account  name,  number  or  other  identifiable
information  from  the  document  can  be  associated  with  this  SOR  debt.  The  debt  is
reflected as charged off in Applicant’s April 2022 credit report. (Items 2, 4-6; AX B)
SOR  ¶   1.j   ($86)  is  a  medical  debt  that  was  placed  for  collection.  Applicant
admitted  the  debt  and  stated  he  would  resolve  it  as  soon  as  possible.  Following  the
reopening  of  the  record,  he  provided  a  document  showing  that,  in  March  2023,  the
account was paid in full. (Items 2, 4-6; AX B)
SOR ¶  1.k  ($44,756)  is a joint mortgage account that was past due  with a total
loan balance of $378,803. Applicant’s April 2022 credit report reflects that the mortgage
was  opened  in  May  2017  with  a  date  of  last  activity  of  May  2020.  In  his  Answer,
Applicant  admitted  the  debt  and  stated  he  was  a  co-signer  to  a  mortgage.  He  did  not
elaborate  on  when  or  why  the  loan  became  past  due  or  detail  any  plan  to  bring  the
mortgage current. (Items 2, 4-6)
Following  the  reopening  of  the  record,  Applicant  detailed that he had  co-signed
for the mortgage, but did not own the home. He stated he was not aware that the loan
was delinquent until he received the SOR. He then claimed that the owner had, without
his knowledge, modified the mortgage and borrowed additional funds. Applicant stated
he was pursing court proceedings to force a sale of the property in order to be removed
from the loan. (AX B)
However,  Applicant  later  produced  correspondence  from  an  attorney  clarifying
that  the  mortgage  had  not  been  modified.  Instead,  the  attorney  speculated  that  the
owner  had  likely  added  arrears  to  the  loan  balance  and  that  there  remained
approximately $150,000 in equity should the house be sold. (AX C)
Applicant  did  not  provide  any  additional  information  regarding  his  efforts  to  be
removed  from  the  loan.  Instead,  he  produced  a  transaction  history  from  the  mortgage
servicer,  dated  March  2023,  that  reflected  the  mortgage  had  been  in  various  levels  of
delinquency from early 2020 through the middle of 2022. However, a payment of about
$45,000  was  posted  to  the  account  in  October  2022.  This,  and  subsequent  smaller
payments, brought the mortgage current. (AX D)
Applicant  submitted  a  paystub  and  budget  that  showed  he  was  maintaining  full
time  employment  with  a  net  monthly  remainder  of  about  $700.  Applicant’s  employer
described him as maintaining a strong work ethic and receiving exemplary praise from
the various clients he served. (GX 5; AX E)
