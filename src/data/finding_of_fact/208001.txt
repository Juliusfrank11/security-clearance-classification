Applicant admitted allegations SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.d and 1.f-1.g and denied SOR ¶¶ 1.a
and 1.e. His admissions and statements in his Answer and Response are incorporated
into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits
submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 44 years old. After serving honorably in the U.S. Navy from 1997 until
September 2017, he was hired by his sponsor immediately upon retirement. He received
an associate degree in 2005. He was married to his first spouse from 1999 until 2013. His
second  marriage  was  from  2014  until  2021.  He  married  again  in  2022.  He  has  two
elementary school age children. (Item 3 at 10, 11, 17-18, 20-21; Item 4 at 22.)
The  SOR  alleges  six  delinquent debts  totaling  $14,441,  reflected  in  three  credit
reports  from  the  government  from  October  2022  (Item  5),  March  2022  (Item  6),  and
November 2020 (Item 7). Two government credit reports show a charged-off automobile
loan for over $13,000, which was not alleged. (Item 5 at 7; Item 6 at 4.) In his subject
interview, he acknowledges the charged-off automobile loan and stated because of the
divorce he stopped making payments after his former spouse hid the keys. (Item 4 at 8.)
The SOR did not allege this debt. The evidence concerning these debts is summarized
below. The May 2023 credit report he provided with his Response shows just one SOR
debt, SOR ¶ 1.a. (AE C.)
Any derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will not be considered
for disqualifying purposes. However, it may be considered in the application of mitigating
conditions and in a whole-person analysis.
Guideline F
SOR  ¶   1.a:  retail   account   placed   for  collection  in   the   amount   of   $2,652.
Applicant denies the debt. He reported the account to the Federal Trade Commission as
a  fraud.  He  stated  the  account  had  been  opened  by  his  former  spouse  after  their
separation in late 2019. (Answer at 1, 3  and Item 4 at 8.) The account fraud began in
November 2019, and he did not discover it until June 2022. (Answer at 3.) The May 2023
credit report reflects in the comment section that he disputes the account. (AE C at 87.)
The  account  went  into  delinquency  in  January  2020.  During  his  June  2022  subject
interview,  he  discussed  his  marital  accounts.  He  stated  that  he  did  not  dispute  these
accounts and because he was still legally married at the time the accounts were opened,
he is ultimately responsible. (Item 4 at 8.)
SOR ¶  1.b: account  placed for collection in amount  of  $7,853. Applicant admits
the debt, but he has refused to pay on the basis that his landlord never repaired the leak
which caused the damage. (Answer at 2.) During his June 2022 subject interview, he said
that  he  would  contact  the  creditor  to  set  up  a  payment  plan,  so  the  debt  would  not
negatively impact his ability to obtain a security clearance. (Item 4 at 9.) In his Response,
he still disputes the debt but has initiated a payment plan with the collection agency. He
offered an April 2023 customer receipt showing a payment of $100. (AE A.)
SOR  ¶   1.c:   telecommunication  account   placed  for  collection  in  amount   of
$904. Applicant admits the debt but disputes who holds the debt. The account went into
collection in July 2021 (Item 6 at 4.) He provided a statement with his Answer showing
the account paid as of December 6, 2022, and closed with the creditor. (Answer at 6.)
SOR ¶  1.d: telecommunications account  placed for collection  in amount  of
$528. Applicant admits the debt and states it has been paid in full. He provided a payment
receipt with his Answer showing a zero balance as of December 10, 2022.  (Answer at 3-
6.)
SOR  ¶   1.e:  telecommunications  account   placed  for  collection  in  amount   -
of  $2,000. Applicant denies the debt on the basis he has a current account with multiple
lines with the company, which is not delinquent. He argues how could the account be past
due when he has a current account with the company. (Answer at 2.) The account was
opened  in  December 2019  and  was  delinquent  in  November  2020.  (Item  7  at  6.)  The
account does not appear on the May 2023 credit report. (AE C.)
SOR ¶ 1.f: utility  account  charged off in the  amount  of  $504. Applicant admits
the debt. He states he has contacted the utility company, but the company could not give
him any details. The account was opened in March 2020 and was delinquent in October
2020. (Item 7 at 6.)
SOR  ¶   1.g:   Applicant  filed   Chapter  7   bankruptcy  in   2016.   The  bankruptcy
discharged $73,156 in debt. (Item 8 at 8.) He admits the action. He cites in his Answer
the unexpected passing of his mother that triggered his financial issues. (Answer at 2.)
He told the investigator the bankruptcy was caused by travel costs to visit his mother and
her funeral costs, as well as his then-wife’s  medical discharge  from  the  military, which
reduced their income. (Item 4 at 25.)
Applicant  detailed  his  expenses  in  his  subject  interview,  which  left  him
approximately $3,200 per month in disposable income. (Item 4 at 10.) The credit report
he submitted shows three accounts with negative information, SOR ¶ 1.a, the previously
referenced vehicle loan, and an April 2022 charge off for a credit card. (AE C at 11-12,
53, and 85.) He addressed the charged-off credit card during his subject interview and
provided the settlement information. (Item 4 at 12-14; Item 7 at 4.) In his Response he
blamed his financial situation on his last divorce and notes he held a clearance while in
the  Navy  without  incident.  He  includes  four  character  letters  attesting  to  his
trustworthiness, dependability, and good character. (AE B.)
