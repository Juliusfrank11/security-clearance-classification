In  Applicant’s SOR response, he  admitted  the  SOR allegations in ¶¶  1.a  through
1.h.  (HE   3)  He  also  provided   clarifying   and   mitigating   information.   His   admissions  are
accepted  as findings of fact.  Additional findings follow.
Applicant  is  a  44-year-old  program  manager.  (Tr.  24-25)  His  resume  provides
details  about  his  professional  experiences  and  accomplishments.  (AE  K)  His  first
marriage was from 2012 to 2013, and his current marriage was in 2014. (Tr. 24) His two
children are ages five and two. (Tr. 24) He was promoted from deputy program manager
to program manager in April 2022. (Tr. 25) He has held a security clearance since 2004,
and  there  is  no  evidence  of  security  violations,  alcohol  abuse,  use  of  illegal  drugs,  or
criminal conduct. (Tr. 25, 53; GE 1)
Financial Considerations
Applicant said his debts became delinquent because of divorce, unemployment,
and underemployment. (Tr. 57) In December 2013, he borrowed funds to pay a $67,000
divorce settlement in a Middle Eastern country. (Tr. 26-28, 57-60) He was not permitted
to leave the Middle Eastern country until the settlement was paid. (Tr. 58)
From July 2009 to July 2014, Applicant was employed in a foreign country, and his
annual salary was $115,000 to $120,000. (Tr. 27-28) From July 2014 to September 2014,
he was unemployed for about six weeks. In September 2014, his annual pay was reduced
to $75,000,  when he  changed employment  to  a different  company in the same  Middle
Eastern country. (Tr. 27-28) His new employment did not include housing, car allowance,
and some other benefits he received during his previous employment. (Tr. 61) He was
able to make payments for several months on multiple accounts, and then in April 2015,
he started defaulting on multiple debts. (Tr. 60) He had more delinquent debts than those
listed on the SOR, and he paid some of the other delinquent debts before he addressed
the debts listed in the SOR. (Tr. 51) He contacted some debt consolidation companies
about assistance with his debts; however, he did not agree to enroll in their programs.
(Tr. 31) In his October 18, 2021 SCA, he listed all of the SOR debts except for the State
A tax liens plus three other debts on which he was making payments. (GE 1) On July 8,
2022, he paid $934 to resolve one non-SOR delinquent bank debt. (GE 2 at 35, 37) On
June 15, 2022, he paid another delinquent debt listed on his SOR. (GE 2 at 36)
The SOR alleges 10 delinquent debts totaling $144,299 as follows:
SOR ¶¶  1.a, 1.c,  1.d, and  1.e  allege Applicant has four charged-off debts totaling
$108,853, which he owed to the same credit union for $24,766; $42,103; $22,261; and
$19,723. He had a signature loan, a credit-card debt, and two vehicle loans, respectively.
(Tr. 29) The two vehicles with liens from the creditor were returned to the creditor at one
of  their  branch  locations  in  a  Middle  Eastern  country  in  2015.  (Tr.  32,  61-64)  He  was
unaware of what the credit union employees did with the two vehicles. The vehicle debts
were SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e, and he believed the creditor did not give him a credit for the
return of the vehicles. (Tr. 32-34, 62-63)
When  he  was unable  to  make  payments to  the  credit union  because  of his reduced
salary, he  contacted  the  creditor, and  he  received  a  one-month  forbearance. (Tr.  29; AE
A) He defaulted  on  the  loans  in  April 2015. (Tr. 26-27, 60; AE  A) He repeatedly contacted
the  creditor over the  years, and  the  creditor’s best offer is for him  to  pay 45  percent of the
debt  over  a   two-year  period.  (Tr.  29;  AE   A)  He  asked   the   creditor  to   credit  him   with
returning  the  two  vehicles; however, the  creditor refused  to  do  so.  (Tr. 34) The  monthly
payments  would be  $2,400  for a  total of about $55,000.  (Tr. 29) He  provided  a  copy of
his correspondence  with  the  creditor. (Tr. 30;  AE  A) He was  unable  to  afford  the  $2,400
monthly payments. (Tr. 30)
Applicant  most  recently  communicated  with  the  creditor  six  weeks  before  his
hearing, and the creditor’s offer continued to be to settle the debt for 45 percent of the
face  amount  by  making  payments  over  24  months.  (Tr.  54)  The  four  debts  are  not
accruing interest. (Tr. 55, 67) He has currently saved $4,000 to pay the creditor. (Tr. 55)
Once he has a larger amount available, he plans to offer the creditor an initial lump-sum
payment and then to make payments under a more realistic payment plan. (Tr. 66) In his
SCA and response to interrogatories, he noted the four debts were collection-barred by
the statute of limitations and had aged off or been dropped from his credit report. (GE 1;
GE  2  at  20,  49)  He  is not  relying  on  the  statute  of  limitations  to  avoid  paying  the  four
debts. He intends to pay or settle the four debts.
SOR ¶  1.b alleges Applicant has a bank credit-card debt placed for collection for
$7,501.  He  defaulted  on  the  credit-card  debt  in  April  2015.  (Tr.  34)  The  account  was
transferred to several different collection agents. (Tr. 35) Applicant settled the debt and
received a December 21, 2022 letter indicating the debt was resolved. (Tr. 35, 52; AE B)
SOR ¶  1.f  alleges Applicant has a charged-off bank debt for $1,180. Applicant said
the debt was paid in full, and he provided a bank account statement showing the debt
was paid in December 2022. (Tr. 35-36, 50; AE C)
SOR ¶¶  1.g, 1.h, 1.i, and  1.j allege Applicant has four state tax liens from State A
for tax years (TY) 2013 to 2016 for $1,088; $9,169; $7,695; and $8,813. (GE 2 at 14-17)
The total debt owed to State A was $26,767. (GE 2 at 40) Applicant moved from State A
in July 2009 to a Middle Eastern country. (Tr. 36, 43) He planned to reside in a state with
no income taxes when he returned to the United States. (Tr. 36) His only connection to
State A was his State A driver’s license, which expired in 2012. (Tr. 36, 43) He believed
he was not required to file a State A income tax return or pay taxes to State A because
he did not consider himself to be a resident of State A. (Tr. 36-37) He did not do anything
to establish residence in a tax-free state until he left the Middle Eastern country, and he
returned to the United States in 2018. (Tr. 77) After 2018, he lived in a state with no state
income taxes. (Tr. 37, 46) His spouse is a resident of the tax-free state where he currently
resides.  (Tr.  78)  He  filed  his  federal  income  tax  returns  in  2019  within  the  time  limits
authorized  by  the  IRS  for  a  U.S.  citizen  living  outside  the  United  States,  and  State  A
wanted him to pay income taxes for TYs 2013 to 2016. (Tr. 36-37, 47)
Applicant first learned of State A’s tax liens when DOHA contacted him in October
of 2022. (Tr. 37, 43, 65) He advised DOHA that he did not believe he was a resident of
State A, and he disagreed with having to pay taxes to State A. (Tr. 48-49; GE 2 at 24, 56)
On November 10, 2022, State A asked Applicant to agree to an automatic payment plan
involving an $1,811 monthly deduction from his account starting on December 8, 2022.
(Tr. 38; GE 2 at 38) Instead of utilizing the payment plan, he borrowed the funds from his
parents, and he paid the state tax liens. (Tr. 38-39, 52) A December 16, 2022 letter from
State A indicates the four liens owed to State A are paid. (Tr. 39; AE E) He has the option
of repaying the debt owed to his parents, or his parents will reduce his inheritance by the
amount of the payment. (Tr. 39)
Applicant provided a personal financial statement. (Tr. 31; AE F) His current annual
salary is $170,000. (Tr. 71) His spouse’s annual salary is about $43,000. (Tr. 71) He put
aside $4,200 in the last three months to start building up a fund to pay the credit union for
the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e. (Tr. 31-32, 68, 77) He is confident that
he can repay the four remaining unresolved delinquent debts. (Tr. 40) He has not accrued
any new delinquent debts since 2014. (Tr. 69)
Applicant’s October 20, 2022  credit report lists 11  accounts.  (GE 4) None  of the
accounts have ever been past due. (Id. at 2) For 10 accounts, the status is “Pays account
as agreed.” (Id. at 3-7) One account with a zero balance has a status of “Charge-off,” and
the charged-off amount is zero. (Id. at 5)
Character Evidence
Applicant’s  supervisor  for  18  months  described  him  as  the  top  person  he
supervised  out  of  114  employees.  (Tr.  17;  AE  J)  Applicant  has  outstanding  integrity,
honesty, reliability, and trustworthiness. (Tr. 18-19) He was the program manager for the
company’s $70 million contract. (Tr. 17-18) If his supervisor was starting a new company,
Applicant  is  the  first  person  he  would  hire.  (Tr.  20)  He  received  performance  awards,
completed  courses,  received  certificates  of  achievement,  and  accomplished  several
certifications. (AE I) His letters of recommendation laud his diligence and professionalism.
(AE J) He has excellent performance evaluations. (AE H) He volunteers in his community.
(Tr. 42; AE L) He is dedicated to his company, community, and family. (Tr. 40-42)
