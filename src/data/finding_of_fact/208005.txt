In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions
are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 54-year-old computer technician employed by a defense contractor
since January 2020. He served in the active-duty and reserve U.S. Navy, from May 1997
until his honorable discharge in June 2008. He earned an Associate’s degree in July 2014,
and is currently enrolled in an online university program. He married in July 2000, and he
and his wife are parents to four children ages 20, 18, 15 and 13 years old. He disclosed
that his wife is employed by the local hospital. (Items 2 and 3)
After  leaving  the  Navy,  Applicant  was  employed  by  defense  contractors  in
Afghanistan, from January 2010 through April 2011, and February 2012 through March
2014; and in the United States, from April 2011 through February 2012, and June 2014
through January 2015. He was briefly unemployed after returning home from Afghanistan,
from April to June 2014. (Items 2 and 3)
In January 2015, Applicant accepted a job with a U.S. multinational corporation,
doing work as a cyber security analyst. He disclosed that he experienced job
performance issues that ultimately led to his termination in May 2017. He stated that
after his termination, he remained unemployed for about 12-months, through June
2018. During this period, he was a “stay-at-home dad” financially supported by his wife
and unemployment benefits. (Item 3 at 1) He returned to the job market in July 2018,
working as a part-time driver for about 12 months. He left the position and was
unemployed for six months, from July through December 2019. (Items 2 and 3) In his
response to the SOR, he disclosed he used this period of unemployment and part-time
employment to start his own business. Applicant did not provide many details about his
business, but disclosed for the first time he used credit card accounts to finance it. (Item
1 at 3)
The SOR alleges four delinquent debts totaling about $61,000. Applicant admitted
all debts. He attributed his financial problems  to a lack of available financial resources
after he was fired in June 2017. (Items 1 through 3) He disclosed that he stopped making
payments on credit card debts to pay other debts. (Item 3 at 2) He provided additional
comments concerning the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR.
These   [debts]  came   about  after  being   let   go   from   [the   employer]  in   2017
and  unable  to  find  a  job  for over 2  years.  These  credit cards  were  used  a
little for paying  bills, but  mostly for trying  to  get my own business  going. That
failed   miserably   and   now  I  am   paying   for  it.  Maybe   it  wasn’t  the   best
decision,  but  it was  a  decision  I made  at  the  time  to  what I hoped  to  be  my
financial contribution  while  I wasn’t working  a  full-time job. (Item 1 at 3)
He went on to state he had been working with his current employer for three years, while
his wife works with the local hospital; and that they have been able to pay off one debt
not listed in the SOR.
We  do  plan  on  paying  all  the  debts off  that are listed  on  the  SOR, but we
are doing  it at a  pace  that we can  keep  up  with.  . . . We  are in a  good  place
[financially] right now and  would not want to  do  anything  to  jeopardize  this.
(Item  1 at 3)
Applicant did not disclose additional details about the business; nor did he provide
documents or details about his finances. The record is void of information or documents
concerning his income and expenses, or other financial resources at his disposal, such
as bank savings and checking accounts, retirement accounts, and other assets of value.
(Items 1 through 3)
The evidence concerning debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below.
SOR  ¶   1.a:  account   in  collection  for  $20,429.  Applicant  admits  this  debt.  He
disclosed the account first became delinquent in about May 2018, after he lost his job in
May 2017. He stated he stopped making payments on this credit card debt to prioritize
paying other bills. (Items 2 and 3) He disclosed to investigators in March 2020 he had not
resolved this debt, but stated he planned to contact creditors within the next six months
after catching up on his mortgage. (Item 3 pp. 3-4) He provided no additional details or
documents  to  show  the  current  status  of  the  debt.  The  debt  is  listed  as  an  individual
account assigned for collection in October 2019. (Item 5 at 2). The credit bureau report
indicates he disputed the debt following resolution, specifically reading “consumer dispute
following resolution”. (Item 5 at 2) No explanation, information, or documented proof has
been  offered  to  support  the  reason  or  basis  for  a  dispute.  (Item  5  at  2)  This  debt  is
unresolved.
SOR  ¶   1.b:  account   charged  off  for  $14,594.  Applicant  admits  this  debt.  He
stated the account first became delinquent in November 2017 after he lost his job. He
disclosed he stopped making credit card payments in order to “make ends meet”. (Items
2 and 3) During his interview, he disclosed he had not resolved this debt but stated he
planned to contact creditors within the next six months after catching up on his mortgage.
(Item 3 at 2) He offered no additional details or documents supporting the current status
of the debt. In both credit bureau reports, this debt is listed as an individual account that
was charged off and closed by the creditor in January 2019. (Item 4 at 14; and Item 5 at
2). This debt is unresolved.
SOR  ¶   1.c:  account   in  collection  for  $13,580.  Applicant  admits  this  debt.  He
stated  the  account  first  became  delinquent  in  January  2018,  after  he  lost  his  job.  He
prioritized other debts over credit card payments. (Item 3 at 3). He also disclosed his plan
to use a tax refund to help repay the debt. This debt appears in both credit bureau reports.
It is listed as an individual account that was assigned to collection in June 2019. (Item 4
pp.  14-15;  Item  5  at  2).  In  the  most  recent  credit  bureau  report,  the  account  balance
changed  from  $13,645  to  $13,580,  a  reduction  of  $65.  However,  the  date  of  the  last
activity was still June 2018, without change. The report also showed he disputed this debt
following resolution, specifically reading “consumer dispute following resolution”. (Item 5
at 2)  No explanation, information, or documented proof has been offered to support the
reason or basis for a dispute. (Item 5 at 2) This debt is unresolved.
SOR  ¶   1.d:  account   charged  off  for  $12,590.  Applicant  admits  this  debt.  He
stated the account first became delinquent in January 2018, after he lost his job and had
to prioritize other debts over credit card payments. (Items 2 and 3). The debt is listed as
an  individual  account  that  was  charged  off  for  an  actual  amount  of  $17,991,  vice  the
amount alleged; and closed by the creditor in December 2019. (Item 4 at 14) This debt is
unresolved.
