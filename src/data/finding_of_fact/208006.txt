Under  Guideline  F,  the  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  owed  $80,535  for  two
delinquent federally guaranteed student loan accounts  (SOR 1.a and 1.b); and that he
owed  $7,330  for  two  delinquent  commercial  credit  accounts  (SOR  1.c  and  1.d).  In
response,  Applicant  admitted  each  allegation,  with  explanations,  and  he  provided
documents in support of his responses. (Answer)
Under  Guideline  E,  SOR  2.a  alleged  that  Applicant  intentionally  made  a  false
official statement in his March 2022 e-QIP. Specifically, it was alleged that he deliberately
omitted from his e-QIP the debts alleged at SOR 1.a – 1.d by answering “No” to questions
under  Section  26  (Financial  Record)  that  required  him  to  disclose  whether,  in  the
preceding seven years, he had debts more than 120 days past due.
Applicant admitted SOR 2.a, with explanation. However, in reviewing the pleadings
at hearing, Applicant denied that he intentionally made a false statement through his e-
QIP answers. Accordingly, I entered his response as a denial, thus making the question
of  his  intent  to  falsify  a  controverted  question  of  fact.  (Tr.  13  –  15;  see  also  Directive,
Section E3.1.14) In  addition  to  the  facts established  by Applicant’s admissions, I make
the following findings of relevant fact.
Applicant  is  a  39-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor,  for  whom  he  has
worked since March 2021. He previously held a security clearance while working for a
federal contractor between  September 2008  and  September 2016.  He  applied  for that
clearance through an e-QIP he submitted on June 3, 2010. (GX 1; GX 2)
Applicant graduated from college in August 2008. He funded his tuition through the
student loans addressed in SOR 1.a and 1.b. Thereafter, he moved to State A, where, as
noted  above,  he  worked  as  a  federal  contractor.  His  annual  salary  ranged  between
$35,000 and $55,000. In his 2010 e-QIP, Applicant disclosed that he was or had been
delinquent on three commercial credit accounts (not alleged in the SOR), and that he was
delinquent  or  past  due  on  his  student  loans,  which  then  totaled  about  $51,000.  The
commercial  accounts  appear  to  have  been  paid  off.  As  to  his  student  loans,  after
Applicant’s income tax refund was diverted toward those accounts in 2009, he set up a
repayment  plan  and  made  monthly  payments  of  $387.  He  managed  to  make  those
payments for about a year, and he has not made a regular payment on his student loans
since 2010. (GX 2; GX 6; Tr. 49 – 52, 55 – 56, 61 – 64)
Applicant next acted on his student loans in January 2023, when he contacted a
credit repair and debt negotiation company. With his Answer, he provided information that
shows the credit repair firm has contacted his creditors. That information does not show
that he is making any payments on his student loans or other debts. Applicant testified
that he pays that firm $100 monthly for their services. On June 5, 2023, Applicant enrolled
in a debt repayment plan that requires him to make bi-weekly payments of $135 to satisfy
the debts at SOR 1.c and 1.d, as well as three other debts not alleged in the SOR, totaling
$17,081. The plan would resolve those debts in four years. (Answer; AX A; AX B; Tr. 56
– 59)
On  June  9,  2023,  Applicant  enrolled  in  a  student  loan  rehabilitation  program
(“Fresh Start Transfer”) to resolve five student loan accounts totaling $82,242. Available
information  reflects  that  he  has  asked  for  his  payments  to  be  based  on  his  income;
however, the record does not reflect a monthly payment or schedule of payments. (AX C)
Applicant  attributes  his  current  financial  problems  to  an  extended  period  of
unemployment. In 2016, he left his federal contractor employment in State A and moved
to State B to assist his sister and her children. His sister was seriously ill and could not
afford in-home care. After Applicant used up his savings to support himself, he opened
the credit card accounts alleged at SOR 1.c and 1.d. Additionally, his sister and parents
helped him financially from time to time. Applicant returned to the workforce in October
2019, when he took an information technology (IT) position at a local hospital. He earned
about $17 hourly before taking a job with the contractor sponsoring his current request
for clearance  in  March 2021.  In  February 2023,  Applicant  was  suspended  without  pay
from his current employment pending the outcome of this adjudication. (Answer; GX 1;
GX 2; Tr. 38 – 47, 61 – 64)
Applicant did not disclose any of his delinquent debts when he submitted his e-
QIP in March 2022. He discussed his financial problems, including his student loans, with
a government investigator in an April 2022 personal subject interview (PSI). He initially
denied that he had any delinquent debts until the investigator confronted him with credit
report information about those debts. In his hearing testimony, he acknowledged that he
was familiar with the information required in response to e-QIP questions by virtue of the
fact that he had submitted a similar questionnaire in 2010. He further admitted that he
intentionally  answered  “No”  to  the  e-QIP  because  he  did  not  have  current  information
about his student loans and other debts. (GX 1; GX 2; GX 3; Tr. 48 – 49, 61 – 64, 68 –
69)
Applicant and his wife have been married since June 2022. They have no children
together; however, Applicant has a young child from a previous relationship for whom he
pays about $425 monthly in child support. His wife earns about $70,000 annually, and his
brother has been covering the aforementioned child support payments since November
2022. Additionally, Applicant’s parents have been paying his half of their rent. Applicant
and his wife do not manage their monthly finances according to a structured budget, and
because Applicant’s income tax refunds are diverted to his student loan accounts, they
file  their  taxes  separately.  Applicant  is  current  on  all  of  his  income  tax  reporting  and
payment obligations. (Tr. 37, 66 – 68, 74 – 76)
