In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a - 1.d; 1.f
-1.h, and denies the allegations in 1.e; and 1.i – 1.k.
Applicant is a 54-year-old employee of a Department of Defense (DoD) contractor
seeking a security clearance. She has worked for the same employer since 2009. She
received a bachelor’s degree in 2017.  She has never held a security clearance. She is
divorced and has three adult children. (Item 3)
SOR  ¶¶  1.a  –  1.d  and  1.f  –  1.h  are  student  loans  placed  for  collection  totaling
approximately  $21,742.  The  delinquent  loans  were  placed  for  collection  between  July
2015 and July 2016.  (Item 5 at 2-4) In her security clearance application, dated April 22,
2022,  Applicant  stated  the  reason  for  the  delinquency  was  the  financial  challenges  of
being a single mother of three teenagers. She just kept getting further behind paying her
bills.  She mentioned she sent in paperwork to rehabilitate the student loans to get them
back in good standing. (Item 3 at 40) In her Answer to the SOR, she indicates that she
sent in paperwork for her student loans to be on a new schedule of payments. (Item  2)
She did not provide any documents regarding her attempts to resolve or rehabilitate her
delinquent student loan accounts.
The SOR also alleges the following debts:
SOR ¶  1.e: A  $2,750  owed  to  a  former landlord for alleged  repairs  needed  after
she  moved  out. (Item  5  at 3) In  her answer to  the  SOR, Applicant claims she  disputed  this
debt  with  the  credit bureau.  She  claims  a  new  property  manager  took  over  her  lease  mid-
way through  the  year. They charged  her for items that were  in disrepair  when  she  moved
into  the  property. She  did not receive her $2,750  security deposit when  she  moved  out.
(Item  2  at 1-2)  A  May 2022  credit report, lists this debt,  but it does  not indicate  that the
debt is being formally disputed. (Item 5  at 3)
SOR ¶  1.i: $955 satellite television account placed for collection. (Item 5 at 3) This
account  was  resolved  on  June  24,  2022.  Applicant  provided  proof  of  resolution  in
response  to  the  SOR.  (Item  2  at  4)  In  the  unsworn  summary  of  the  personal  subject
interview, the investigator indicated the debt was paid and that a receipt was provided.
The debt is resolved. (Item 4 at 5, 8)
SOR  ¶   1.j:   $643  cable  television  account  placed  for  collection.  (Item  5  at  4)
Applicant claims this debt was paid on June 27, 2022. Applicant provided proof the debt
was resolved. (Item 2 at 5) In the unsworn summary of the personal subject interview, the
investigator  indicated  the  debt  was  paid  and  that  a  receipt  was  provided.  The  debt  is

In March 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the President directed the
Department of Education (DoEd) to provide the following temporary relief on DoEd-owned
federal  student  loans:  suspension  of  loan  payments,  stopped  collections  on  defaulted
loans,  and  a  0%  interest  rate.  On  March  27,  2020,  the  Coronavirus  Aid,  Relief,  and
Economic  Security  Act  (CARES  Act)  provided  for  the  above  relief  measures  through
September 30, 2020. See Federal Student Aid (FSA) website, ISCR Case No. 20-02787
at 3 n.1 (App. Bd. Mar. 2022) This student loan debt relief has been extended several
times.  See  https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19.  Congress  recently
barred any further extensions and student loan repayments will resume in October 2023.
