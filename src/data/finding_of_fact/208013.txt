In Applicant's answer to the SOR, he admitted all allegations. His admissions are
incorporated in my findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings
and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 43-year-old customer service representative. He has worked for his
sponsor since August 2021. He is a high school graduate and holds a technical certificate.
He received an honorable discharge from the U.S. Army for his service from 2009-2015,
which included a deployment to a combat zone. He previously held a clearance in 2009.
He was married from 2011-2017 and remarried in 2021. He has one child of his own and
two stepchildren. (Item 3 at 7, 12-13, 17, 21, 23-25, and 35; Item 4 at 5.)
SOR  ¶¶   1.a,   3.a   and  3.b:  Failed   to   disclose   the   information  set  forth  in
subparagraph 3.a  that he  had used marijuana  with  varying  frequency  from about
June 2016  to  about  November 2021  and purchased marijuana  during this  period.
Applicant answered “No” to Question 23 of his August 2021 SCA, which asked whether
he  had  illegally  used  any  drugs  or  controlled  substances.  (Item  3  at  33.)  He  was
interviewed multiple times during the investigative process. During the first interview in
September  2021,  he  discussed  alcohol  abuse  and  financial  matters,  along  with  other
areas. (Item 4 at 13-15.) He was provided additional time to provide documentation to
support his answers concerning financial matters and was asked to provide paperwork to
the  investigator  for  release  of  his  medical  records.  (Item  4  at  17.)  He  subsequently
provided consent paperwork for the release of his mental health and alcohol counseling
records. After receiving these records, the investigator asked if he had any involvement
with illegal drugs. He answered yes and told the investigator that he had used marijuana
on a daily basis by himself in his house. (Item 4 at 21.) He explained that the marijuana
helped  with  his  anxiety  and  back  pain  and  that  he  had  to  buy  the  marijuana  illegally
through a friend. He stated the reason he did not truthfully answer the SCA question about
his drug use was because he did not think the investigation would include obtaining his
medical records. (Item 4 at 21.) After going through “drug and alcohol rehab” in June 2021
he  stated  that  he  tried  marijuana  again  but  did  not  like  the  feeling.  (Item  4  at  6.)  His
treatment  included  receiving  shots  to  get  him  off  marijuana  and  patches.  His  monthly
shots started in August 2021, but he admitted that he continued to use marijuana and had
used marijuana as recently as November 23, 2021. He listed as references three friends
who also use marijuana. (Item 4 at 21 and Item 3 at 22-23.)
SOR ¶¶  1.b,  4.a and 4.b:  Failed to
disclose debts  set  forth in subparagraphs
4.a.   and   4.b,  accounts  charged  off  in  the   approximate   amounts   of   $21,054   and
$19,269.   Applicant  listed  one  debt  on  his  SCA.  When  asked  if  he  had  any  additional
qualifying debts by the investigator, he responded no. (Item 4 at 15.) When confronted by
the  investigator  with  two  charged-off  debts,  he  acknowledged  them  as  private  student
loans. (Item 4 at 15.) He took these loans out in approximately 1999 and they went into
collection in around 2006. He stated he did not disclose the delinquent student loans on
his SCA because he did not want to look bad.  He had utilized deferments while in the
military and later when he took classes between October 2015 and May 2018. He told the
investigator since May 2018 he has tried to forget about his student loans. (Item 4 at 15-
16 and Item 5 at 3, 8.)
SOR ¶¶  2.a  and 2.b:  Consumed alcohol, at times  in excess  and  to  the  point
of   intoxication,  from   about   June  2020   to   present   and  received  inpatient   alcohol
treatment from about June 2021 to about August 2021, with  a  diagnosis of alcohol
dependent.  Applicant  disclosed  that  he  had  received  inpatient  treatment  for  alcohol
dependency and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from June 2021 through August
2021. (Item 3 and Item 4 at 14.) He acknowledged consuming a bottle of tequila a day
from June 2020 until entering treatment in June 2021. In his September 2021 interview
with an investigator, he said that his alcohol use was “zero.” (Item 4 at 14.) He stated his
inpatient rehabilitation program had given him “the tools needed to abstain from alcohol.”
(Item 4 at 14.) In his November 2022 response to interrogatories, he acknowledged that
he continued to drink, but said that he had moderated his consumption and only drinks
one to two beers socially. He cited a recent Halloween party as an example. (Item 4 at
8.) He indicated he would be involved in an outpatient program. (Item 4 at 14.)
Applicant  did  not  submit  any  documentary evidence  and  did  not  respond  to  the
FORM.
