Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations in his Answer. He is 29 years old. He
married  in  2016  and  divorced  in  2018.  He  does  not  have  any  children.  He  graduated
from high school in 2012 and he attended welding school from 2018 to 2019, but he did
not earn a degree. He worked part time as a dishwasher from June 2010 to June 2013.
He then enlisted in the U.S. military and served until June 2018, when he was honorably
discharged. He has worked for his current employer, a DOD contractor, since July 2018.
He has never held a security clearance. (Items 1-3)
The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  has  three  charged-off  consumer  debts  totaling
$31,920.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.c)  In  addition  to  his  admissions  in  his  Answer,  Applicant
disclosed his delinquent debts in his August 2021 security clearance application (SCA),
during  his  August  2021  background  interview,  and  in  his  October  2022  response  to
DOHA  interrogatories.  His  delinquent  debts  are  also  reported  on  three  credit  bureau
reports from August 2021, September 2022, and March 2023. (Items 1-7)
SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b,  and  1.c  are  three  charged-off  credit  cards  with  the  same
creditor,  in  the  amounts  of  $20,955,  $6,925,  and  $4,040,  respectively.  Applicant
obtained the credit cards in approximately 2013 and 2016, and he used them to pay for
his  daily  living  expenses.  He  began  to  fall  behind  on  his  payments  after  his  military
discharge in 2018, when he earned only a  minimal income  and  the high  interest  rates
on his credit cards affected his ability to pay them. He stated in his SCA and during his
background  interview  that  he  was  paying  off  other  non-delinquent  debts  so  that  he
would  have  more  money  to  resolve  his  delinquent  debts,  which  he  expected  to  do
beginning  in  approximately  2022.  In  his  response  to  interrogatories,  he  stated  that  he
intended to also save money so that he could make lump-sum payments on his credit
cards. He also stated that he was experiencing medical issues that further affected his
ability to resolve his debts. (Items 1-4)
Applicant stated in his Answer that payment plans had commenced for all three
credit cards, and he was scheduled to pay SOR ¶ 1.a monthly and SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c
bi-weekly.  He  provided  documentation  reflecting  that  he  made  a  payment  of  $436  for
SOR ¶ 1.a in March 2023, and he made three payments of $66 and $51 for SOR ¶¶ 1.b
and  1.c,  respectively,  in  February  and  March  2023.  He  stated  that  he  adjusted  his
payment  plans  to  have  all  but  the  largest  of  his  three  delinquent  debts  paid  by  May
2025, and the largest paid by February 2027. (Items 1-4; AE A, B)
Applicant  described  his  financial  situation  as  stable  during  his  background
interview.  In  his  response  to  interrogatories,  he  stated  that  his  annual  salary  was
approximately $72,000. He further stated that he purchased a home in March 2022 and
his  monthly  mortgage  was  $1,500.  He  obtained  a  roommate  and  refinanced  his  auto
loan to lower his monthly expenses, so that he could address his delinquent debts. His
March 2023 credit report reflects that he has a delinquent debt not alleged in the SOR,
for  an  apartment  rental  in  collection  for  $1,084.  He  indicated  in  his  FORM  Response
that he intends to set up a payment plan  to address this debt. In addition, he set up a
payment  plan  of  $15  monthly  for  another  account,  also  not  alleged  in  the  SOR,  in
collection  for  approximately  $513.  He  made  payments  in  accordance  with  that  plan  in
February and  March  2023.  He  indicated  during  his background  interview that  he does
not intend to obtain credit cards in the future. He has not received any credit counseling.
