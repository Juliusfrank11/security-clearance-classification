Applicant admitted to the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.e. He denied SOR
allegation  ¶  1.f.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and
testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  29-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  (GX  1  at  pages  7
and 11.) He has been employed with the defense contractor since 2012. (TR at page 13
line  22  to  page  15  line  21,  and  GX  1  at  pages  11~12.)  He  is  unmarried  and  has  no
children.  (GX  1  at  page  16.)  Applicant  attributes  his  financial  difficulties  to  gambling.
(TR  at  page  15  line  22  to  page  18  line  24.)  He  ceased  on-line  gambling  in  2019,  and
last  gambled  in  Las  Vegas  in  March  of  2022,  a  little  more  than  a  year  prior  to  his
hearing. (Id.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
1.a.,  and  1.c~1.e. Applicant admits to past-due debts to Creditor A totaling about
$26,000.  He  has  yet  to  address  these  admitted  debts.  These  allegations  are  found
against Applicant.
1.b.  Applicant  admits  a  past-due  debt  to  Creditor  B  in  the  amount  of  about
$7,378. He is making monthly payments  of $400~$500, which is 25% of his paycheck

Applicant.

He avers that it has been settled and paid (TR at page 23 line 16 to page 24 line 13.)
This  averment  is  supported  by  documentary  evidence.  (AppXs  E  and  F,  and  GX  6  at
page 10.) This allegation is found for Applicant.
