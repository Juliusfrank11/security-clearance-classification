Applicant  admitted  all  six  debts  in  the  SOR  (¶¶  1.a-1.f)  with  a  brief  general
explanation. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact.  After a thorough
and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant  is  37  years  old.  He  was  married  from  June  2013  to  December  2017,
when  he  and  his  wife  divorced.  They  have  a  seven-year-old  daughter,  born  in  March
2016.  (GE  1;  Tr.  26-28)  Applicant  has  some  college  credits  and  an  Information
Technology (IT) certification. He served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from 2006 to
2016. He deployed to Iraq twice during 2009-2011. He was discharged honorably as a
staff sergeant (E-5). (GE 1; Tr. 30) Applicant is considered to be “totally and permanently
disabled” by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and his disability is 100% service-
connected. He receives $3,757 a month in compensation. (AE F; Tr. 52-53)
After  leaving   the   Air   Force,   Applicant  worked   briefly  for  an   auto   dealer  and   a
grocery chain  (2016-2017) before  joining  the  defense  industry in June  2017. He worked
for a  large defense  contractor from  2018-2020, and  was earning $50,000  annually when
he  left, after earning  his IT certification.  When  he  changed  careers and  jobs, his starting
annual  salary  at  his  next  job   was  $45,000.  He  remained   with   that  company  and   its
successor until March  2023  (leaving  with  a  salary of  $60,000), when  he  began  working
for his  current employer and  clearance  sponsor. His salary is  now  $68,500.  (GE 1;  Tr. 22-
26, 52-54)
Applicant disclosed on his SCA that after their daughter was born, his wife left him,
and  he  had  to  pay  all their  credit  cards  and support  them  while  working  part  time.  He
noted that he retained a credit counseling firm, has been taking their financial advice, and
has been cutting expenses. (GE 1 at 39; Answer)
The  SOR  debts  were  incurred  jointly  during  the  marriage  rather  than  after  the
divorce. (Tr. 31-34) Applicant said his former wife declined to assume responsibility for
any of them, so he did so when they divorced. (Tr. 51) Applicant testified that he was not
making a sufficient income to address his debts and his child support obligations until he
joined the IT field. He started at the bottom, has excelled, and is working his way up to
leadership. With promotions, he began to attain financial stability and is now better able
to address his debts. (Tr, 20-22)
The  six  SOR  debts  total  about  $19,562.  They  are  established  by  Applicant’s
admissions and by credit reports in the record, from March 2018 and March 2019. (GE 3,
GE 4) He also discussed them in his April 2018 background interview. (GE 2) None of the
SOR debts are reflected on a May 2022 credit report. (GE 5)
SOR ¶ 1.a ($5,728) is a charged-off credit-card account. (GE 3, GE 4) After the
hearing, Applicant provided documentation from the creditor reflecting their agreement to
settle the account for $4,297 by May 2024. He said he is to pay $367 per month. (AE D;
Tr. 37-38, 40-43) This account is being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.b ($5,506) is a bank credit-card account that has been charged off. (GE
3, GE 4) After the hearing, Applicant provided documentation from the creditor reflecting
that the creditor has agreed to settle the account for $4,130. Applicant is to make a $344
payment every month until the account is resolved in April 2024. (AE B; Tr. 35-37, 43-45)
This account is being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.c ($2,267) is a bank credit-card account that has been charged off. (GE
3, GE 4) After the hearing, Applicant provided documentation from the creditor reflecting
that  the  creditor  has  agreed  to  settle  the  account  for  $1,701.  Applicant  is  to  make  a
$141.75 payment every month until the account is resolved in April 2024. (AE A; Tr. 35-
37, 45-46) This account is being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.d ($1,393) is a military credit account that has been charged off. (GE 3,
GE 4) Applicant said he had not arranged to pay this debt but would do so. (Tr. 39, 46)
This debt is not resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.e  ($2,437)  is  the  balance  due  on  an  auto  loan  account  after  a
repossession.  (GE  4)  Applicant  explained  that  he  prioritized  paying  child  support  over
resolving this debt, which led to the repossession in 2016. (GE 2 at 5-6) Applicant believed
that the creditor had told him that they had no record that he owed any money and that
they  no  longer  held  the  debt.  (Tr.  38-39,  48-50)  After  the  hearing,  he  provided
documentation from the creditor reflecting that the payoff amount for the loan is $9,383,
effective through June 17, 2023. (AE C) He also indicated in a post-hearing e-mail that
he is able to pay $250 a month to resolve this debt. This account is not resolved.
SOR ¶  1.f  ($2,231) is a  cell  phone account placed  for collection. (GE 3) Applicant
asserted  that the  debt has been  paid  and  was  his former wife’s responsibility.  (Tr. 35, 50-
51)
Applicant has lived in State 1 since his wife left  in Summer 2016. She lives with
their daughter in another state. (Tr. 34) He has paid child support obligations since then
and is current. His child support obligations are $900 a month, and he expects a reduction
to $600 in October 2023. He said he also provides additional funds of about $300 or $400
a month for his daughter. (Tr. 28-29, 56)
Applicant has also cut credit-card expenses and moved in with his mother to cut
living expenses further. He pays about $1,000 in rent. (Answer; Tr. 55, 57) He estimated
that he has $3,000 to $3,500 in monthly expenses, with an income of about $7,800 (salary
and disability), leaving about $4,400 in surplus. (Tr. 57-58) He provided a budget after the
hearing. (AE F) He has no past-due taxes or late-filed tax returns, and no other delinquent
debts. (Tr. 61-63; GE 3, GE 4, GE 5)
Applicant  said  he  understands  the  magnitude  and  importance  of  his  debts  and
intends  to  pay  them.  He  said  he  had  excellent  credit  before  his  divorce  and  wants  to
improve his credit and move on with his life and career. (Tr. 39-40) He said he learned
that it was important not to let others affect his credit and that “financial literacy with your
significant other is another big factor.” (Tr. 60-61)
