Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a government contractor for whom he has
worked  since  2015.  He  has  been  married  since  2014.  He  has  an  adult  child,  an  adult
stepchild,  and  a  15-year-old  stepchild.  He  earned  a  high  school  diploma  in  1994.  (Tr.
42-43; GE 1, 2)
In  the  SOR,  the  Government  alleged  Applicant’s  failure  to  timely file  his federal
income tax returns for tax years 2011 through 2018, as required  (SOR ¶¶ 1.a through
1.h). It also alleged his 13 delinquent debts totaling approximately $47,000 (SOR ¶¶ 1.i
through  1.u).  These  delinquencies  consist  of  car  loans  (SOR  ¶¶  1.i  through  1.k),
personal loans (SOR ¶¶ 1.l and 1.o), loans to purchase furniture (SOR ¶¶ 1.m and 1.n),
credit  cards  (SOR  ¶¶  1.p  through  1.r),  and  utilities  (SOR  ¶¶  1.s  through  1.u).  He
admitted the SOR allegations with additional comments. His admissions are adopted as
findings  of  fact.  The  SOR  allegations  are  established  through  his  admissions  and  the
Government’s exhibits. (Tr. 47-54; SOR; Answer, GE 1-7)
Applicant  late  filed  his  2011  through  2017  federal  income  tax  returns  by  June
2021. He late filed his 2018 federal income tax returns in June 2023. He has settled or
brought  current  the  accounts  listed  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.i  and  1.m.  through  1.u.  He  has  not
resolved the accounts listed in SOR ¶¶ 1.j through 1.l. After he submitted his December
2017  Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations  Processing (SF 86), he contacted the
creditors of the debts listed in SOR ¶¶ 1.j through 1.l but could not afford the payments
they required  because he was paying off other, smaller SOR debts.  (Tr. 23-27, 28-38,
43-55; Answer; GE 2, 3; AE A)
Applicant failed to timely file his federal income taxes because he procrastinated
and  because  he  thought  he  would  owe more in  taxes  than he  could  afford  to  pay.  He
attributed  his  inability  to  pay  his  financial  delinquencies  to  his  stepdaughter’s  special
needs and the costs associated with her care. His financial situation worsened when his
wife stopped working in 2016 to take care of his stepdaughter full time. His wife also has
chronic  medical  conditions  that  keep  her  from  working.  His  stepdaughter’s  medical
condition will require full-time assistance for the rest of her life. (Tr. 45-47, 57-58; GE 2)
Applicant  has  federal  income  tax  deficiencies  and  consumer  delinquencies  that
are not listed in the SOR. While he late filed them in June 2023, he did not timely file his
federal  income  tax  returns  for  the  2019  through  the  2021  tax  years,  as  required.  He
owes about $45,000 in delinquent federal taxes for the 2013 through 2017 tax years. He
also believes that he owes delinquent  federal taxes for the 2019 tax year, but he does
not  know  the  amount.  He  does  not  have  a  payment  plan  in  place  to  resolve  these
delinquent federal taxes. He is no more than three payments past due on his mortgage,
and he has an additional collection account in the amount of $10,180 for an unsecured
loan that he opened in November 2021. Any adverse information not alleged in the SOR
will  not  be  used  for  disqualification  purposes.  I  will  consider  it  when  assessing  the
application of mitigating conditions and for the whole-person analysis. (Tr. 44-47; GE 6,
7; AE A)
Applicant  earns  $86,000,  annually.  His  stepdaughter  receives  about  $900  in
monthly  social  security  benefits.  On  the  day  of  the  hearing,  he  had  about  $700  in  a
savings  account  and  $1,100  in  a  checking  account.  He  has  about  $15,000  in  a
retirement  account.  In  a  September  2019  personal  financial  statement,  he  claimed  he
had about $91 in surplus earnings at the end of each month. He does not know what his
current monthly expenses are because his wife handles the budget. (Tr. 58-63; GE 3)
