In Applicant’s answer to the SOR he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-b. He
owes $28,950 in delinquent student loan debt. He specifically listed SOR ¶ 1.b in his SCA.
(Item 3 at 32 and Item 4 at 4-6.) His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 29-year-old tool crib assistant. He has worked for his sponsor since
September 2022. He received an associate degree in 2015.  He has never held a security
clearance. He is engaged but has never been married and has no children. (Item 3 at 5,
9, 10, 18-19, 30.)
SOR  ¶¶   1.a-b   are   student   loans   placed  for   collection   totaling  $17,645   and
$11,304. In Applicant’s SCA, he cited the reason for the delinquency as the “cost of living
keeps rising and the pay rate stays the same.” He adds that “no action has been taken
due to searching for stable paying job to provide for the high cost of living.” (Item 3 at 32,
33.) The student loan debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a was assigned for collection in November
2018 and the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b was assigned for collection in September 2016.
(Item 5 at 2.)
Applicant worked in the food service industry while in school from 2013 until 2015.
In 2016 he obtained his first job in his field. He left the company to complete a test and
join another company, with a slight break in employment. In November 2020 he was let
go and remained unemployed until September 2022. (Item 3 at 10-16 and Item 4 at 2.)
During this period of unemployment, he took a trip in 2021 to a South American country
for more than 20 days of tourism, and in 2022 he took a trip of more than 10 days to a
Caribbean nation to visit family and friends. (Item 3 at 24-25.) He referenced working with
a  debt  relief  company  in  his  ESI  and  that  he  had  stopped  making  his  student  loan
payments in order to pay his rent. (Item 6 at 7.)
Applicant’s  student loans  appear to be current on the  March 2023 credit  report.
(Item  4.)  However,  the  balances  remain  the  same  as  the  delinquencies  shown  on  the
October  2022  credit  report.  (Item  5.)  There  is  no  evidence  of  any  payments  made  on
these student loans since March 2020. (Item 4 at 3-4.)
I have taken administrative notice that in March 2020, as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic,  the  President  directed  the  Department  of  Education  (DoEd)  to  provide  the
following  temporary  relief  on  DoEd-owned  federal  student  loans:  suspension  of  loan
payments, stopped collections on defaulted loans, and a 0% interest rate. On March 27,
2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) provided for
the above relief measures through September 30, 2020. See Federal Student Aid (FSA)
website, ISCR Case No. 20-02787 at 3 n.1 (App. Bd. Mar. 2022) This student loan debt
relief  was  extended  several
times  by  subsequent  Executive  Orders.  See
https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19.  Congress  recently  barred  any
further extensions and DoEd has announced that student loan repayments will resume in
October 2023. See https://studentaid.gov/debt-relief-announcement.
