Applicant,  age   47,   has  been   married   three   times.  She   was   married   to   her  first
husband  from  1994  until they divorced  in 2001, and  to  her second  husband  from  2005
until they divorced  in 2011. In  2021, she  married  her third  husband  and  assumed  his last
name. She  has three  children, one  of  whom  is currently living. Her eldest  daughter, who
passed  away  the day she  was  born, would be  30  years old.  Her son,  who  was killed  in  a
single vehicle  accident  in February 2020, would be  28  years old. Her youngest daughter
is 29  years old.  Applicant  earned  her high  school diploma in  1994. At various times not
specified   in   the   record,  she  attended   college   courses  to   obtain  certificates  in her field.
She  was steadily employed  as a  defense  contractor by several employers from  2005  until
August 2019, when  she  became  unemployed. She  remained  unemployed  until October
2019,  when   she   began   working   as  a   database   administrator  for  her  current  employer.
She  has  maintained  a DOD security clearance  since  2006. (GE  1, 2;  Tr. at 4,  15-19,  70-
71)
The SOR alleged five delinquent debts totaling $46,093. In her Answer, Applicant
admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.c. She denied SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e. Each of the debts
alleged in the SOR is established by Applicant’s August 2019 credit report. (GE 3, 4)
SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b
Applicant took out two parent federal student loans ($12,000 in 2011, and $12,000
in 2013) to afford her daughter the opportunity to attend college. As of August 2019, the
two student loans were in default status in an amount totaling $45,043, as alleged in SOR
¶¶ 1.a and 1.b. Her daughter was the first in the family to attend college. Her daughter
graduated a year early from high school and went straight to college in 2011. Her daughter
earned  her  bachelor’s  degree  in  2014,  an  associate  degree  in  2019,  and  a  master’s
degree in 2020. As of the hearing, her daughter was pursuing a second master’s degree.
(Tr. at 40-41, 62-67, 78-79)
Applicant maintained that the student loans were not  in delinquent status due to
any intentional action on her part to avoid paying them. As she understood it, while her
daughter was enrolled in a degree program at least half time, she would not have to make
any loan payments until her daughter graduated. She never made any payments because
she believed that her daughter had remained enrolled in a degree program from 2011
through  March  2020.  In  March  2020,  the  loans  became  eligible  for  COVID-pandemic
related relief through September 2023. (Tr. at 22, 40-48, 59-60)
In  November  2022,  Applicant  applied  to  rehabilitate  the  student  loans  to  take
advantage  of  the  U.S.  Department  of  Education  (DOE)’s  “Fresh  Start”  program.  On
November  8,  2022,  she  paid  $100  to  start  the  loan  rehabilitation  process.  The  “Fresh
Start” program helps eligible borrowers get their loans out of default status and transferred
to  a  new  loan  servicer  with  an  income-driven  repayment  plan.  In  December  2022,
Applicant  was  accepted  into  the  program  and  the  student  loans  were  removed  from
default status and transferred to a new loan servicer. She had not yet received information
about the terms of the repayment plan. She planned to pay the student loans from her
monthly net remainder, which was $866 as of November 2022. She anticipated that she
will  “find  a  way”  to  pay  the  student  loans  should  the  monthly  repayment  plan  amount
exceed $866. (Tr. at 48-54, 61; AE A, O, J)
Applicant  did  not  learn  of  the  delinquent  status  of  the  student  loans  until  she
received the SOR. Upon investigation, she learned that they became delinquent due to a
change  in  her  daughter’s  enrollment  status,  of  which  she  had  not  been  aware.  In
November 2021, she obtained a record indicating that her daughter was not enrolled in
school between October 2017 and September 2018, and again between November 2019
and December 2019. The record indicated that her daughter was otherwise enrolled, at
least half time, from June 2017 through March 2020. Two 2019 credit reports indicated
that the student loans may have been in default as of July 2015. Applicant believed that
her daughter was enrolled in school as of July 2015, but acknowledged that she “did not
know for certain.” (Tr. at 42-43, 68; AE I at 2; GE 3, 4)
SOR ¶ 1.c
SOR ¶ 1.c involves a $599 medical bill incurred by Applicant on her behalf. Based
on conversations she had with her medical provider, she believed that the bill had been
paid via her health savings plan (HSP), the same method she used to pay all bills she
incurred  with  this  provider.  She  continued  to  receive  services  from  this  provider  after
incurring  the  bill.  She  did  not  become  aware  that  the  bill  had  not  been  paid  until  she
received the SOR. Two 2019 credit reports indicate that the debt was incurred in about
2015 and placed for collection in about 2019. After investigating the matter, she learned
that, because the funds in her health savings plan were not sufficient to pay the entire bill,
the HSP denied the entire claim. By that time, the appeal deadline had passed so she
decided to pay the debt out of pocket. On November 9, 2021, she paid $674 to a collection
company to resolve the debt in full. (Tr. at 29-34; AE B; AE I at 7; GE 3, 4)
SOR ¶ 1.d
SOR ¶ 1.d involves a utility account Applicant asserted was reported in error. Two
2019 credit reports indicate that the alleged account was placed for collection in about
2014 in the amount of $486. Applicant denied owing the debt on the basis that she had
continuous  service  with  the  same  utility  company  since  1994  and  had  no  known
delinquencies on her account. After learning of this debt when she received the SOR, she
contacted  the  utility  company.  She  proffered  a  letter  from  the  utility  company,  dated
November 9, 2021, indicating that this account had been closed with a $0 balance upon
receipt of a $486 payment in March 2016. (Tr. at 34-37; AE C; AE I at 8; GE 3, 4)
SOR ¶ 1.e.
SOR ¶ 1.e involves a $65 medical debt reported in collection status on two 2019
credit reports. Applicant denied any knowledge of the alleged debt or any other known
delinquent medical debt. She received no letters, phone calls, or emails concerning a $65
debt. She was unaware of this debt until she received the SOR. Both she and her attorney
attempted  to  investigate  the  debt.  However,  neither  were  successful  in  obtaining  any
information to validate the debt. She was directed to a collection company that had gone
out of business, and to information suggesting that the debt may be for services owed to
a known medical provider. However, she denied that she had any delinquencies on her
account with that known medical provider. Applicant is willing to pay the debt should she
obtain information in the future that both validates the debt and confirms the payee. This
debt did not appear on her November 2022 credit report. (Tr. at 37-39; AE H; GE 3, 4)
2011 Divorce
Applicant attributed her 2011 divorce to her second husband having “gone through
a lot” after his younger brother was killed. She stated, “[h]e got very sick and we had to
get divorced.” She was left with “just a ton of debt that was in both of our names,” including
taxes,  two  mortgages,  “extensive”  credit-card  debts,  traveling  expenses,  and  personal
loans. Her second husband was not able to work at the time they divorced so, between
about 2011 and 2014, she was “making all the payments on everything and just trying to
let  him  regroup  and  get  some  help  that  he  needed  to  get.”  In  2014,  when  their  niece
tragically  passed  away,  her  second  husband  “showed  up  at  the  funeral  and  made
amends,”  and  “started  helping  me  pay  things  back.”  By  then,  he  had  started  a  new
business in  real estate and  started  financially helping  “the  kids, even  my daughter with
her tuition.” (Tr. at 19-20)
At the hearing, Applicant maintained that  all her 2011 divorce-related debts had
been paid except for the  taxes. However, she could not recall when the non-tax debts
had been finally resolved or how much she paid to resolve them. After the hearing, she
reported  that  she  made  monthly  payments,  totaling  $1,201,  for  an  unspecified  period,
towards the debts she had been assigned to pay in her 2011 divorce decree. Those debts
included six credit-card debts (which then totaled $32,377) and one private student loan
that she took out on behalf of her son (which then totaled $37,500).  (Tr. at 19-20, AE Q)
Taxes
On her 2016 SCA, Applicant reported that she failed to pay 2012 federal and state
income taxes in the approximate amount of $3,000. She explained that she had “issues
with  getting  paperwork from  previous  marriage” and  that there was a  “discrepancy  of  who
would be  claiming  the  children  and  who  owed  the  other money  for  claiming  the  children
on  the  previous year.”  She  stated,  “I am  on  a  payment plan  to  repay the  amount  owed
and  being reimbursed  by my ex-husband.” (GE 1)
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  disclosed  that  she  had  been  paying  $152  monthly
towards  federal  income  tax  debt,  and  $211  monthly  towards  state  income  tax  debt,
pursuant to installment agreements she negotiated in about 2016. She asserted that she
never missed an installment agreement payment, and was up to date with her federal and
state tax income return filings. (Tr. at 54-55, 57, 68-69)
After  the  hearing,  she  proffered  documents  corroborating  that  she  made  timely
payments  from  June  2017  through  December  2022,  totaling  $13,810,  pursuant  to  an
approved payment plan towards her delinquent state tax debt; and timely payments from
January 2018 through December 2022, totaling $8,250, pursuant to an approved payment
plan  towards  her  delinquent  federal  tax  debt.  As  of  January  2019,  the  balance  of
Applicant’s  federal  tax  debt  for  tax  years  2011,  2013,  and  2014  through  2016,  totaled
$38,542, including a failure-to-pay penalty and interest (the breakdown was as follows:
$16,147 for 2011, $8,307 for 2013, $6,814 for 2014, $4,47 for 2015, and $2,827 for 2016).
As of September 2022, the balance remaining on her state tax debt was $378. The record
did not indicate for which tax years her state tax debt related. As of January 2023, the
balance remaining on her federal tax debt was $26,504 (the breakdown was not indicated
in the record). Her 2022 federal tax refund of $4,000 was applied to her federal tax debt.
The record did not indicate whether her state or federal debt had ever been considered
in delinquent status, neither were they alleged in the SOR. (Tr. at 69, 81-82; AE K, L, N)
Income and Expense History
Applicant did not earn any income during her unemployment between August and
October 2019.  Prior to being  laid  off  in  October 2019,  she  earned  an  annual salary of
$87,000. As of the hearing, her annual income increased over time to $97,000, and her
third  husband  was  earning  a  monthly  income  of  $4,963.  She  has  about  $2,000  in  her
savings account (which had been reduced by the amount she used to replace a damaged
windshield  on  her  car and  the  increased  price  of  her  home’s  oil  heat).  She  has  about
$14,000 in her 401K account. (Tr. at 52, 54-55, 57, 70-72, 84-85)
Applicant  attributed   her  financial  strain  to   circumstances  beyond   her  control
including  her divorce, financially supporting  her children, the  tragic passing  of her son  and
close   colleagues,  and   the   COVID-19   pandemic.  She   acknowledged   that  these
circumstances contributed  to  her lack of attention  to  the  student loans. (Tr. at 19-28, 44-
48, 66-67, 69, 74-75, 77)
Applicant  financially  supported  her  daughter  while  she  was  away  at  college
between 2011 and about 2015, during which time she estimated that she paid $30,000
for her daughter’s out-of-pocket college expenses. She  stated, “I helped  her with  food,
rent, a car, car insurance, cell phone, etc.” Applicant’s son and his girlfriend began living
with her in 2014, when his girlfriend was pregnant with their first child, who was born in
2015. She  continued  to  support her son  and  his family, including  financially  and  otherwise,
after her second  grandchild  was born  in October 2018, and  until they moved  out and  into
their   own   home   in   February  2019.   She   was   their   primary  financial  provider   during   the
period  they resided  with  her. In  addition  to  not charging  them  rent, she  provided  them  with
food,  utilities,  diapers,  and   whatever  else   they  needed.  Her  son   was  employed   and
financially  “helped   out   when   he   could,”  but   his  girlfriend   did  not  earn  any   income.  Her
financial  support included  subsidizing  prescriptions which  her son’s insurance  did  not fully
cover.  The   out-of-pocket  cost   for   those   prescriptions,   which   her   son   needed   to   treat   a
chronic illness  with  which  he  had  been  diagnosed  in  January 2017,  was “at  least  a  couple
hundred  a  month.”  After his son’s girlfriend  misappropriated  the  funds raised  to  pay  for
the  funeral, Applicant paid about $14,000  for  her son’s funeral. She  spent “a little over a
year and  a  half”  administering  her son’s estate  for which she  spent an  unspecified  amount
of money  on  fees  and  expenses. Her  ex-husband  also contributed  an  unspecified  amount
towards those fees and expenses. (Tr. at 19-28, 45-48, 63, 69, 74-75, 77; AE P)
Between 2017 and 2018, Applicant went on short-term disability three times, which
reduced her income. She could not recall “the total time” she took off on each occasion.
Initially, she took leave for about six weeks to attend to her ill son. Then, she twice took
leave for “a couple of weeks” each time to attend to her mental health which had suffered
following the tragic passing of four of her colleagues. She and her co-workers, whom she
also considered friends, were “all very close,” and were negatively affected by the events
surrounding those deaths. On each occasion that she was on short-term disability, she
received either 35 or 65 percent of her pay. (Tr. at 24-28, 75-76)
Applicant’s November 2022 credit report revealed four active credit cards (opened
between 2014 and 2019), with balances of $1,073, $2,825, $1,354, and $6,324; and four
loan  accounts  (opened  between  2020  and  2022)  with  balances  of  $10,891,  $20,269,
$17,383,  and  $11,388.  All  the  accounts  were  reported  in  good  standing.  No  new
delinquent debts were reported. Applicant used the credit cards to pay for gas, emergency
expenses, and unspecified other expenses. She used the $11,388 loan to help finance
her  son’s  funeral  and  pay  unspecified  expenses;  and  the  $17,383  loan  to  finance  a
recreational vehicle (RV) she used to visit her daughter in lieu of staying in hotels that did
not allow dogs. As of the hearing, since she no longer needed it, the RV was for sale for
an amount sufficient to cover the balance of the loan. The purpose of the other two loans
were not indicated in the record. (AE H; Tr. at 86-89)
Applicant  attended  one  financial  counseling  session  in  connection  with  the
administration of her son’s estate. She currently maintains her finances by using a budget,
which she implemented in about 2017. She learned how to set up a budget via a program
that her son purchased. She pays all her bills via bi-weekly automatic payments. (Tr. at
83-84)
Whole-Person Concept
Applicant submitted eight character reference letters, a resume, and a 2021 review
lauding  her  work  performance  and  character.  By  all  accounts,  she  is  trustworthy  and
responsible. She has an exemplary work ethic. She ensures that she stays up to date on
her training and certifications. (AE D-G)
At the hearing, Applicant explained,
This has  just  been  a  series of  horribly, tragic,  unfortunate  events  that have
left me  financially strapped.  But I do  intend  to fix this  and  make this right.  It
just  isn't, unfortunately,  something  that  can  happen  overnight.  I  have  to  take
time  and make it right.  (Tr. at 58)
