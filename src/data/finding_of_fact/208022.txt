Applicant is 46 years old and has been employed by a U.S. Government contractor
as an engineer since May 2017. He is married and has a minor child. Applicant earned a
bachelor’s degree  in  2005 and a master’s degree  in 2011. He has applied for national
security  eligibility  in  connection  with  his  employment.  He  was  denied  eligibility  for  a
security clearance in 2013 when he worked for a previous employer. In his August 2019
background interview, he claimed that he was never advised why his prior application for
a clearance was denied. (Item 4 at 7, 13-14, 21-23, 25-26, 32; Item 5 at 1-2.)
Guideline F, Financial Considerations
The Government alleged in this paragraph of the SOR that Applicant is ineligible
for  a  clearance  because  he  is  financially  overextended  and  therefore  potentially
unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.
The SOR lists 12 debts that are delinquent, charged-off, or in collection. The total amount
of  the  delinquent  debts  is  approximately  $62,000.  The  existence  and  amount  of  these
debts are supported by Applicant’s admissions in his Answer and by credit reports in the
record, dated November 29, 2022; January 15, 2020; and July 3, 2019. (Items 6 through
8.)
The limited details available in the record about the 12 SOR delinquent debts are
as follows:
1.a.  Mortgage  loan  delinquency  - $18,798. Applicant defaulted on this account in
or about 2019. The loan was sold. At one point, Applicant was delinquent in the amount
of  $18,798,  and  the  new  owner  of  the  loan  commenced  foreclosure  proceedings.  As
noted, Applicant admitted this allegation in his Answer. The most recent credit report in
the record, dated November 29, 2022, which was submitted by the Government (the 2022
Credit Report), reflects that the loan had been modified and had a zero balance, indicating
that  his  large  past-due  balance  was  resolved  at  one  point.  Applicant  has  provided  no
more recent information to establish that he is current on his mortgage loan. The record
contains  no  further  information  regarding  the  payment  status  of  this  loan.  This  debt  is
resolved. (Item 5 at 3; Item 6 at 10; Item 7 at 1; Item 8 at 6, 11.)
1.b.  Credit-card  debt  - $9,878. Applicant defaulted on this account in 2018. The
2022 Credit Report reflects that this debt has been settled, and the account has a zero
balance. This debt is resolved. (Item 6 at 11; Item 7 at 2; Item 8 at 9.)
1.c.  Credit-card  debt  $9,514. Applicant defaulted on this account in 2018. The 2022
Credit Report reflects that this charged-off debt is outstanding. This debt is not resolved.
(Item 6 at 10; Item 7 at 2; Item 8 at 8.)
1.d.  Credit-card  debt  - $9,311. Applicant defaulted on this account in 2018. The
record  contains  a  document  evidencing  that  the  creditor  obtained  a  judgment  against
Applicant in February 2020 in the amount of $13,447. The 2022 Credit Report reflects
that this debt has been settled, and the account has a zero balance. This debt is resolved.
(Item 6 at 8; Item 7 at 2; Item 8 at 10; Item 9.)
1.e.   Credit-card  debt   -  $3,909.  Applicant  defaulted  on  this  account  in  2018.  No
further information was provided. This debt is not resolved. (Item 6 at 8; Item 7 at 2; Item
8 at 5.)
1.f.   Credit-card  debt  Collection   Account   -  $2,529.  Applicant  defaulted  on  this
account in 2018. The 2022 Credit Report reflects that this debt has been settled, and the
account has a zero balance. This debt is resolved. (Item 7 at 2; Item 8 at 8.)
1.g.   Credit-card  debt  Collection   Account  -  $1,364.  Applicant  defaulted  on  this
account in 2018. No further information was provided. This debt is not resolved. (Item 6
at 9; Item 7 at 2; Item 8 at 7.)
1.h   Credit-Card   Debt  -  $1,272.  Applicant  defaulted  on  this  account  in  2018.  No
further information was provided. This debt is not resolved. (Item 6 at 11; Item 7 at 2; Item
8 at 4.)
1.i.   Credit-card  debt   -  $1,256.  Applicant  defaulted  on  this  account  in  2018.  The
debt does not appear on the 2022 Credit Report. There is no affirmative evidence in the
record that Applicant has satisfied this debt. This debt is not resolved. (Item 6 at 9; Item
7 at 2.)
1.j.  Collection  Account  - $370. Applicant defaulted on this telecom account, and
the account was placed for collection. Applicant disputed this account. It does not appear
on the 2022 Credit Report. There is no affirmative evidence in the record that the dispute
was resolved in Applicant’s favor or that he otherwise satisfied this debt. This debt is not
resolved. (Item 6 at 10; Item 7 at 3.)
1.k.  Credit-card debt  - $3,072. Applicant defaulted on this account in 2018 or early
2019. The  Government’s July 3, 2019  credit report in the  record reflects that Applicant
disputed this account and that the creditor resolved the dispute in Applicant‘s favor. The
debt  does  not  appear  in  either  of  the  Government’s  more  recent  credit  reports  in  the
record. This debt is resolved. (Item 6 at 9.)
1.l.  Collection Account  - $684. Applicant defaulted on this insurance account, and
the account was placed for collection. Applicant disputed the account. It does not appear
in  either  of  the  Government’s  more  recent  credit  reports  in  the  record.  There  is  no
affirmative  evidence  in  the  record that the  dispute  was resolved  in  Applicant’s favor or
that he otherwise satisfied this debt. This debt is not resolved. (Item 6 at 8.)
Applicant  wrote  in  his Answer  that  he  invested  money  borrowed  from  his  credit
cards  to  start  a  real  estate  investment  business  in  2017.  He  could  not  maintain  the
payments on the debt and defaulted on the accounts. He asserted that he enrolled in a
debt-consolidation plan  (the Plan) to address  his delinquent debts and expected  to  be
concluded with the payment of his debts by the end of 2022. He provided no additional
or updated information in his Answer or subsequently. He has also not explained why the
Plan did not pay all of his debts by the end of 2022 or provide an update on the status of
the Plan or whether he is still making payments into the Plan. (Answer at 4.)
In his background interview in August 2019, Applicant reported that he entered into
the Plan in July 2018 and under the Plan he consolidated about $35,000 of debt. He pays
the  debt-consolidation  company  $540  per  month,  and  the  Plan  will  continue  for  36
months, or until July 2021. (GE 5 at 2.)
Applicant  submitted  no  documentation  or  additional  information  concerning  his
debts  or  current  income.  The  Government’s  2022  Credit  Report  is  the  most  recent
information available in the record. The record evidence reflects that SOR debts 1.c, 1.e,
1.g, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, and 1.l remain unpaid. Except as noted, Applicant provided no information
detailing his plans for resolving his outstanding delinquent debts or demonstrating other
indicia of trustworthiness and good judgment. In addition, I am unable to make a credibility
assessment as Applicant elected not to have a hearing.
