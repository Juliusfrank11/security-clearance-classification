Applicant married in October 1993 and has three children (ages 13, 17, and 27)
from this marriage. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 17-18, 32). Applicant has a high school diploma, and
he  attended  trade  school  classes  between  June  and  August  2017.  (GEs  1-2;  Tr.  16)
Applicant reported no military service. (GEs 1-2)
Since  April  2017,  Applicant  has  worked  for  his  current  employer  as  a  radio
frequency  technician.  (GE  1;  Tr.  17)  In  his  work,  he  conducts  testing  on  shielded
government  facilities  and  has  not  received  any  “negative  remarks”  from  his  employer.
(Tr. 15)
Between  March  2013  and  April  2017  he  was  employed  as  a  landscape
maintenance supervisor. He worked in Mexico between April 2008 and March 2013 as
the  owner  of  a  small  landscaping  business.  (GEs  1-2)  Applicant  has  never  held  a
security clearance. (GE 1)
Applicant’s finances
Between 2013 and 2014, Applicant accumulated five delinquent accounts. (GEs
3-6)  He  attributed  his  debt  delinquencies  to  income  shortfalls  during  his  years  of  self-
employment. (GE 2; Tr. 18) Despite his past promises made to an investigator from he
Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  in  December  2019  to  contact  his  identified
creditors  holding  his  five  delinquent  accounts,  he  failed  to  do  so.  (GE  2;  Tr.  20-26)
Altogether, Applicant’s delinquent accounts exceed $24,000 and remain unresolved and
outstanding.
Applicant  acknowledged  his  financial  mistakes  and  hopes  to  begin  addressing
his  debt  delinquencies  with  his  improved  employment  situation.  (Tr.  20)  He  did  not
provide  any  developed,  well-organized  payment  plan  or  written  budget  for  addressing
his debts.
Applicant  currently  nets  $3,400  a  month  from  his  work.  (Tr.  29-30)  He  has  no
consistent  monthly  remainder  in  which  to  access  discretionary  funds  to  address  his
debts.  (Tr.  29-30)  He  has  a  401(k)  retirement  account  with  an  approximate  $2,600
balance in the account. (Tr. 30)
