Applicant  admitted  all  the  SOR  allegations  in  her  answer  to  the  SOR.  Her
admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a careful review of the pleadings and
evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 40  years old.  She  has worked  for her current  government-contractor-
employer  since  2020. She  has a  full  employment history dating  back to  2007. She  holds
a bachelor’s degree.  She has never married  and  has no children.  (Item  2)
Under Guideline  F, the  SOR alleged  Applicant failed  to  file her 2015-2019  federal
income   tax  returns,  and   accrued   18   delinquent   debts   totaling   approximately   $76,000.
The  debts  are comprised  of collections  and  charged-off  accounts (student loans,  credit
card,   and   consumer  debt).   Some   of  the   delinquency   dates  relate   back  to   2009.  The
unfiled   tax  returns  are  established   by  her  security  clearance   application   (SCA)
admissions  and  her SOR  admissions.  The   debts   are established  by   her   admissions  in
her answer, security clearance  application  (SCA),  and  during  her  background  interview,
and  credit reports  from  October  2020  and  August  2022.  (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.s)  (Items 2-3, 5-
6)
Under  Guideline  J,  the  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  was  arrested  in  February
2016 for driving with a suspended license. It also alleged that she was arrested in July
2010  and  charged  with  one  count  of  theft  and  one  count  of  failure  to  appear.  It  also
alleged that she was arrested in June 2003 and charged with one count of theft and was
placed  on  probation  for  24  months.  Her  admissions  in  her  SOR  response,  with  no
further explanations, support the allegations. (SOR ¶¶ 2.a-2.c) (Item 1-Answer to SOR)
Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant deliberately falsified material
facts in her September 2020 SCA when she failed to disclose her February 2016 arrest,
as  described  in  SOR  ¶  2.a,  in  Section  22  of  the  SCA.  It  also  alleged  that  Applicant
falsified material facts in her September 2020 SCA when she failed to list her July 2010
arrest, as described in SOR ¶ 2.b, in Section 22 of the SCA. However, that arrest was
over seven years old, and did not need to be listed on her SCA. As to this part of the
allegation, I find in favor of Applicant. (SOR ¶ 3.a)
Financial Considerations
Applicant  admitted  in  her  SCA  that  she  failed  to  file  her  2015-2019  federal
income tax returns. In her October 2020 background interview with an investigator, she
affirmed  not  filing  her  federal  income  tax  returns  for  those  years.  Her  reason  for  not
filing was that she started having financial problems because of her spotty employment.
In  order  to  continue  paying  her  immediate  bills,  such  as  rent,  she  stopped  filing  her
federal income tax returns. She also stated that now that she had her current job, she
would contact an accountant by the end of the year (2020) and file her returns.  In her
SOR  answer,  after  admitting  not  filing  those  tax  returns,  she  stated  that  she  was
“working  on having 2015, 2016, 2017,  2018, and 2019  filed by September 2022.”  She
failed to produce any evidence that those filings were made. (Items 1-3)
Appellant listed some of the delinquent debts in her 2020 SCA, but not all. During
her  background  interview,  she  admitted  all  her  SOR  debts  when  the  investigator
confronted  her  with  them,  including  her  14  delinquent  student  loans.  Regarding  her
consumer  and  credit-card  debts,  she  asserted  that  now  that  she  had  a  good  job,  she
would  look  at  her  credit  reports,  contact  the  creditors,  and  pay  the  bills.  There  is  no
evidence  that  she  took  any  of  those  actions.  She  claimed  she  was  unaware  that  her
student loans were delinquent. She  asserted she would contact her financial aid office
and  take  care  of  these  loans.  There  is  no  evidence  that  she  took  that  action.  She
claimed that her financial situation is a  work in progress, but she was in a better state
than she had been in a long time. She did not produce any evidence of debt payment,
payment plans reached, contact with any of the creditors, or any other actions she took
to resolve these debts. (Items 1-3, 5-6)
Criminal Conduct
In  her  SOR  answer,  Applicant  admitted  to  the  alleged  three  criminal  arrests  in
2016, 2010, and 2003. She did not provide any explanation for the arrests in her SCA,
her  background  interview,  or  her  SOR  answer.  The  source  of  the  arrest  information
comes from an FBI identification record, which lists the arrests. There is no evidence of
any criminal arrests after 2016. (Items 1, 4)
Personal Conduct
In  her  SOR answer, Applicant admitted  deliberately  omitting her  2016  arrest on
her  2020  SCA  as  she  was  required  to  list  in  response  to  Section  22.  She  failed  to
provide any explanation  for this omission during her background interview or her SOR
answer. (Items 1-2)
