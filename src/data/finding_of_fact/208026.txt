massive headaches, and  it is difficult for her to  work on  her finances and  records. (Tr. 62)

On March 13, 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the President placed
Federal  student  loans  in  deferment,  which  means  the  interest  rate  is  zero  during  the
deferment term. See DoEd website, “COVID-19 Loan Payment Pause and 0% Interest,”

zero-interest#in-school-zero-interest.  (HE  4)  In  2022,  the  President  approved  one-time
debt  relief  on  DoEd  loans  of  $10,000.  See  DoEd  website,  “One-time  Federal  Student
Loan  Debt  Relief,”  available  at  https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-
cancellation/debt-relief-info. (HE 5) The Federal courts have issued a stay on this $10,000
debt  relief.  The  President  has  repeatedly  extended  the  deferment.  The  DoEd  has
announced:
The  student loan  payment pause  is extended  until the  U.S.  Department of
Education is permitted  to implement the  debt relief program or the litigation
is resolved. Payments  will  restart 60  days later. If  the  debt relief program
has not been  implemented  and  the  litigation  has not  been  resolved  by June
30,   2023   —   payments  will   resume   60   days  after  that.  We   will   notify
borrowers before payments restart. DoEd  Website,  “COVID-19  Emergency
Relief   and   Federal  Student  Aid,”  available  at  https://studentaid.gov/

The SOR alleges the following financial security concerns:
SOR ¶  1.a  alleges  Applicant failed  to  file her Federal  income  tax  return for tax  year
(TY) 2013. Applicant said she  was unable  to  obtain information  about her income. (Tr.
29) Her  February 18,  2021  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  account  transcript for TY  2013
states  no  tax  return was filed.  (GE 2  at 6) On  December 22,  2014,  the  IRS  sent a  notice
to  Applicant.  (Id.)  After she  received  the  SOR, she  telephoned  her employer  about her
W-2  or 1099  income  statement twice and  requested  income  information  for her TY 2013
tax return. (Tr. 30)  She  did not receive any information  from  her former employer. (Tr. 32)
Her former spouse  took the  box containing  her documents. (Tr. 30)  In  her SOR response,
she  said her tax  counselor advised her that  she did not need to  file her TY 2013  Federal
income   tax  return  because   more  than   six   years  had   elapsed.  She   did  not  provide
correspondence  sent to  or received  from  the IRS indicating  she did not need  to  file  a  tax
return for TY 2013.
SOR ¶ 1.b  alleges  Applicant failed to  timely file her Federal income tax  returns for
TYs 2014  through  TY  2018.  Her  February 18, 2021  IRS  tax  transcripts indicated  her TY
2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, and  2018  Federal income  tax returns were  not filed. (GE  2  at 8-
18)  On   May  28,  2020,  Applicant  told  an   Office   of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)
investigator that she  had  not filed  her Federal income  tax returns in  the  previous seven
years because she was unsure whether she would owe additional taxes. (GE 2 at 20)
She said her Federal income tax returns for TYs 2014 through 2018 were filed around
October 22, 2020, and she provided copies of those five tax returns. (Tr. 33; GE 3) If she
had not been applying for a security clearance, she might not have filed those tax returns.

SOR ¶ 1.c alleges Applicant owes delinquent Federal income taxes totaling $6,136
for  TYs  2013,  2014,  2015,  2016,  2017,  and  2019.  In  December  2021,  Applicant
established a payment plan to address an IRS debt for $5,862. (AE C) She was required
to pay $76 monthly under the IRS agreement beginning on February 15, 2022. (Id.) In
2022,  she  began  making  $76  monthly  payments  to  the  IRS  in  accordance  with  her
payment plan. (Tr. 35-36) She believes the balance owed is about $4,000 because the
IRS has transferred her tax refund for the last two years to address this tax debt. (Tr. 37)
SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, and 1.h, allege medical debts placed for collection for $1,469,
$856, $1,469, and $882. At times, Applicant did not have medical insurance before her
current  employment.  (Tr.  43)  She  currently  has  medical  insurance,  and  she  is  paying
about $100 monthly to address a $3,000 medical debt. (Tr. 41-43, 58-59) She recently
paid  a  $500  medical  debt.  (Tr.  45)  She  was unsure  about  the  origin  or provenance  of
these four medical debts, and she did not provide proof that she was making payments
on them. (Tr. 41-51) She said the two debts for $1,469 could be a duplication. (Tr. 49-50)
After she pays the $3,000 medical debt, she plans to address her other medical debts.
(Tr. 68)
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges an insurance account placed for collection for $236. SOR ¶ 1.i
alleges a delinquent debt for $169. SOR ¶ 1.j alleges a telecommunications debt placed
for collection for $227. Applicant said these three debts were paid in the last two years.
(Tr. 51-52, 70) She provided evidence that the three debts are paid. (AE A)
On May 14, 2023, Applicant provided an email, which said:
I am  writing  this letter to  say that I am  61  years old,  going  to  be  62  in  July. I
would like  to  retire with  peace  and  finish  my  last years happy with  my current
position  . . . .  I love  my job  and  working  with  a  great team. I do  not work with
Classified documents, my job is working with  unclassified documents.
. . . .  I am  appalled  at a  lot  of people who  hold high  levels in the  government
and  have  not answered  to  their  behaviors, or who  have  betrayed  our Nation.
This whole hearing  is about my finances, which I am  trying  to  work things
out   and   get   better.  I  have   satisfied   3   nonmedical  collection   bills.  I  have
satisfied  in  taking  care  of my  IRS  taxes and  am  making  payments  to  pay  off
monthly.  I filed my  taxes in  2020  and after since.  My refund  goes to  paying
off  my  debt  to  IRS.  I  have  showed  that  I  am  making  an  effort  to  take  care of
the   things  in  question.  I  would  never  in  my  lifetime   put  my  country  in
jeopardy for finances ever. That’s not who  I   am. My ancestors were here
before   anyone   came   here  to   America.   I   love   my  country!  My   past  work
shows how dedicated I am and hold confidentiality at its highest!
I am  a  hard working  woman, who  has had  to  learn everything  on  my  own to
get to  where   I am   on   my own.  I didn’t have  the  benefits   that others have
had.  Yes,  I  made  bad  decisions, especially in my marriages. This last one
ruined  my credit, which was so  much  better before  him. It’s no  one’s fault
but  mine  for trusting  him. That  is why  I  am  not married  today,  because  of
what I experienced.
During  my time  with  my  daughter since  September of last  year, I have  been
supporting  her and  my  grandson  from  December till  I moved  at the  end  of
April 2023.
I hope  you  can  see  that I am  a  law  abiding  citizen  and  am  trying  to  get  my
finances in order. I have  done  everything  I  needed  to  do  for my taxes and
paying   monthly  to   satisfy  the   debt.  Almost  paid   off.  No   one   is  perfect,
everyone  makes mistakes. The  important thing  is that we learn from  them
and  get back up, try again and do better.
That is what I am  trying  to  do  and  hope  that you  will  find  favor in me  to  be
the  best  at  my  job  for the  last remaining  years that  I have  before  retiring.
