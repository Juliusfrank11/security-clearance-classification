In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  denied  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  –  1.d,  mostly  with
explanations. He admitted SOR ¶¶ 2.a, 2.b, 3.a, 3.b, and 4.a-4.c, without comment. He
did not answer the cross-allegations at SOR ¶¶ 3.c and 4.d. I construe those answers
as  denials.  His  admissions  are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough
and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant  is  29  years  old.  He  has  never  married  and  he  has  no  children.  He
earned  a  high  school  diploma  in  2012  and  has  taken  some  college  courses.  He  has
been employed by a federal contractor as an information technology (IT) specialist since
August  2014.  He  testified  that  he  has  held  a  secret  or  interim  secret  clearance  since
2014, though he asserted  that he did not have  actual access to  classified  information.
He has held his current position as an IT team lead since May 2019. He has an annual
salary of about $96,000. He works on a military base. (GE 1; Tr. 12, 27-32, 61-65, 105)
In  March  2013,  Dr.  S  diagnosed  Applicant  with  major  depressive  disorder  and
atypical  depressive  disorder.  Dr.  S’s  notes  indicate  that  Applicant  “has  clinical
depression;  has  not  been  on  meds  for  several  months,  having  anxiety  attacks,  sleep
deprivation.”  He  was  brought  for  medical  attention  by  his  mother.  (GE  9)  He  did  not
seek medical approval before ceasing his medication at the time. (Tr. 68-70)
GE 8 is comprised of treatment records for Applicant from Dr. M and Dr. J from
September  2013  to  January  2019.  Applicant  was  diagnosed  with  generalized  anxiety
disorder and atypical depressive disorder. He acknowledged experiencing symptoms of
depression and anxiety since age 12. (Tr. 65-67, 71-78, 80-81)
On or about September 27, 2017, Applicant then age 23, went to the emergency
room  (ER)  of  Hospital  C  complaining  of  depression  and  anxiety.  He  reported  drinking
alcohol and using cocaine as coping mechanisms, and that he had consumed a fifth of
alcohol and used cocaine the night before. He reported intermittent thoughts of suicide
(though  not  at  that  time)  but  has  never  had  a  plan.  (GE  5  at  1-2;  Tr.  83-85)  He  was
admitted to the hospital due to “suicidal ideation” (i.e., thoughts of suicide). (GE 2 at 13)
(SOR ¶ 1.a)
At  Hospital  C,  Applicant  was  diagnosed  with  major  depressive  disorder,
recurrent,  moderate.  (GE  2  at  15)  He  was  discharged  from  Hospital  C  on  October  2,
2017 and referred to Treatment Center P for inpatient substance abuse treatment. (GE
2 at 15; Tr. 83-85) (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 3.a) He was diagnosed at Treatment Center P with
alcohol  use  disorder,  severe;  cocaine  use  disorder,  severe;  cannabis  use  disorder,
severe, tobacco use disorder, mild; and major depressive disorder. (GE 6 at 2)
Treatment  Center  P  records  reflect  that  Applicant  reported  first using  alcohol  at
17. He was found to be severely dependent on alcohol, with daily reported use over the
previous three years. He reported drinking a fifth of alcohol 20 of the previous 30 days,
and  using  cocaine  five  of  the  previous  30  days,  before  his  ER  admission.  He  began
using marijuana at age 16 and used it for four years regularly. (GE 6 at 2; Tr. 79, 86-87)
(SOR  ¶¶  2.a,  2.b)  During  his  testimony,  Applicant  asserted  that  the  frequency  of  his
cocaine  use,  as  reflected  in  GE  6,  is  inaccurate  as  he  only  recalled  or  acknowledged
using  cocaine  twice.  (Tr.  86-87)  He  denied  marijuana  use  within  30  days  of  entering
treatment. (Tr. 88; GE 6 at 2)
Applicant  did  not  complete  inpatient  treatment  at  Treatment  Center  P.  He  left
abruptly on October 14, 2017, reportedly because he did not want to be there anymore.
His  prognosis  was  poor  due  to  his  inability  to  successfully  complete  treatment.  It  was
noted that he  would benefit from readmission to residential treatment and involvement
in  a  12-step  program.  (GE  6  at  3;  Tr.  89)  (SOR  ¶  1.b)  It  was  recommended  that
Applicant  continue  to  abstain  from  alcohol  and  drugs;  that  he  consider  outpatient
psychiatric  treatment  and  behavioral  counseling;  attend  Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA),
Narcotics  Anonymous  (NA)  or  other  meetings  daily;  and  submit  to  random  urinalysis
and  breath  analysis  as  directed.  (GE  6  at  1)  Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  has  not
done any of these things. (Tr. 90)
In December 2017, Applicant went to the ER at Hospital C due to insomnia and
acute anxiety after running out of his medication, Wellbutrin. He was not admitted. (GE
2 at 3. GE 7; Tr. 95-97) (SOR ¶ 3.b) Afterwards, his mother wrote a letter to his primary
care physician, Dr. J, about Applicant’s anxiety. (GE 8 at 8-9; Tr. 97)
Applicant  reported  on  his  SCA  that  he  had  been  treated  for  depression  at
Hospital C in about September 2017 and needed to get on the right medication. (GE 1
at 24-25; Tr. 83) He reported being treated for alcohol use at Treatment Center P from
September to October 2017. (GE 1 at 27-28) He  did not report any  illegal drug use  in
the previous seven years; he reported no illegal drug involvement while in possession of
a clearance; and he reported no drug treatment. (GE 1 at 26-27) (SOR ¶¶ 4.a, 4.b) He
reported  on  his  SCA  that  he  had  been  previously  granted  a  clearance  by  DOD  but
provided no details. (GE 1 at 28-29)
Applicant  had  background  interviews  relating  to  his  SCA  in  September  2018,
May 2019, and July 2019. In his first interview, he verified his reported hospitalization at
Hospital C and said it was for depression. He also discussed his history of alcohol use.
He said he had not been diagnosed as abusing alcohol or being alcohol dependent. He
did not disclose any other issues of substance abuse. (GE 2 at 5; Tr. 90)
In Applicant’s May 2019 interview, he said he was hospitalized at Hospital C for
one week for medication maintenance after his primary care physician, Dr. J, changed
his anti-depression medication. He said he was not hospitalized for any other condition.
He  discussed his substance abuse  counseling at Treatment Center  P, and his alcohol
involvement  and  history  at  the  time.  He  was  asked  if  he  had  used  illegal  drugs  in  the
past  seven  years,  to  include marijuana, and he  said  no.  (GE  2 at 8-10;  Tr.  83,  91-92)
(SOR ¶ 4.c) He acknowledged at his hearing that his time at Treatment Center P would
be considered drug counseling. (Tr. 92)
Applicant was interviewed a third time, in July 2019. He was confronted about his
prior marijuana and cocaine use. He said he had used cocaine once in 2017, then said
he used it once or twice between June 2011 and the present. (SOR ¶¶ 2.a, 2.b) (Tr. 60)
He denied being a habitual user of cocaine and said his cocaine use was experimental.
He  said  he  used  marijuana  between  2008  and  late  2011  about  10  times  a  year,  with
varying frequency. He used it to help him sleep and to cope with depression. He said he
had  not used  marijuana  since  2011  and  had  not  used  cocaine  since  2017.  He  denied
intentionally omitting his illegal drug use from his SCA. Earlier in the interview, he said
he did not list his drug use because he believed it was not on record anywhere and was
not a problem. (GE 2 at 10-11; Tr. 92-93) (SOR ¶ 4.c)
Applicant also disclosed that the real reason for his hospitalization at Hospital C
in  2017  was  for  both  medication  maintenance  and  alcohol  treatment.  (GE  2  at  11-12)
He  authenticated  the  three  interview  summaries  as  accurate  in  a  signed  but  undated
interrogatory response. (GE 2)
In  November 2020,  Applicant participated  in a  psychological  evaluation  ordered
by  the  DOD  CAF  related  to  his  security  clearance  investigation.  The  evaluation  was
conducted  by  Dr.  B,  a  Ph.D.  licensed  clinical  psychologist.  She  reviewed  medical
records  provided  by  the  DOD  CAF,  as  well  as  his  SCA  and  background  interview
summaries.  She  also  conducted  a  clinical  interview,  testing  observations,  and  a
personality assessment inventory (PAI). (GE 3 at 1-2, GE 4) (SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 3.c)
Applicant  told  Dr.  B  that  he  had  always  been  a  “casual”  drinker  and  had  never
engaged  in  binge  drinking.  He  drank  more  prior  to  his  2017  hospitalization  and  was
mixing  alcohol  with  his  prescribed  medications.  He  said  he  had  reduced  his  drinking
significantly since 2018, consuming a bottle of wine or a six-pack of beer a week. (GE 3
at 4) (SOR ¶ 1.d) He said he took Zoloft as needed and that he meets with his primary
care doctor every three months for refills. (GE  3 at 3, 4)
With respect to drug use, Applicant told Dr. B that he stopped smoking marijuana
at age 22. He acknowledged trying cocaine on “a couple of occasions in my past,” and
said he had only used cocaine twice in 2018. (SOR ¶¶ 2.a, 2.b) He said his three-day
hospitalization in 2017 was due to switching medications and was “just to be safe.” He
did not disclose his 2017 substance abuse treatment at Center P or his subsequent ER
visit in 2017. It was noted that records from 2019 indicated that he has a history of not
being  fully  candid  about  his  cocaine  and  marijuana  use  during  interviews  and  in  his
case paperwork. (GE 3 at 4)
Dr.  B  found  that  Applicant  acknowledged  his  history  of  depression  and  anxiety
but tended to minimize  his symptoms. He “severely downplayed his history of alcohol,
cocaine,  and  marijuana  use  and  he  was  not  fully  candid  about  his  struggles  with
substances. His lack of candor “appears to be a pattern.” (GE 3 at 6)
Dr. B found Applicant’s lack of honesty regarding his history of substance abuse
“particularly concerning” since he failed to complete his residential treatment program in
2017;  he  was  given  a  poor  prognosis  by  counselors;  he  failed  to  follow  through  on
discharge  instructions;  had  not  received  mental  health  or  substance  abuse  treatment
since  2017  and  continued  to  consume  alcohol  at  a  fairly  high  level.  Dr.  B  found  that
Applicant’s  demonstrated  lack  of  honesty  impacted  the  credibility  of  his  self-reporting
about his prior drug use. His prognosis was “guarded, at best.” (GE 3 at 6)
Dr.  B.  diagnosed  Applicant  with  (1)  major  depressive  disorder  (moderate,
recurrent) (DSM 296.32); (2) alcohol use disorder, severe (DSM 303.90); (3) cannabis
disorder (severe) (DSM 304.30); and (4) stimulant use disorder (severe) (DSM 304.40).
(GE 3 at 6) (SOR ¶ 1.c)
Dr.  B.  found  that  major  depressive  disorder  tends  to  be  a  chronic  and  highly
recurrent condition. Applicant has experienced symptoms since childhood. His tendency
to self-medicate, coupled with ongoing alcohol use, inadequate treatment and, “perhaps
most importantly, limited insight and transparency, point to a guarded prognosis. At this
time,  [Applicant’s]  diagnoses  could  pose  a  risk  to  his  judgment,  reliability,  and
trustworthiness concerning classified information.” (GE 3 at 6) (SOR ¶ 1.c)
Applicant  denied  SOR  ¶  1.a,  because  he  said  he  never  had  or  expressed
thoughts  of  suicide.  (Tr.  33-34)  He  denied  SOR  ¶  1.b  because  he  said  he  abstained
from alcohol for a year, and sought therapy, but the doctor he consulted in late 2017 did
not  carry  his  insurance.  (Tr.  110)  He  did  not  pursue  mental  health  treatment  or
counseling after that or during the COVID-19 pandemic and has not done so since then.
(Tr. 110-111) He has consulted his primary care physician whom he has seen for many
years.  (Tr.  110-112)  He  is  currently  prescribed  propranolol  (anti-anxiety)  and  Zoloft
(anti-depressant).  (Answer;  Tr.  34-39)  He  said  he  continues  to  experience  “sundown
syndrome” (the worsening of his anxiety or depression at night). (Tr, 97-98; GE 8 at 8)
He denied mental health issues at work necessitating treatment. (Tr. 99)
Applicant  acknowledged  that  before  his  2017  treatment,  his  drinking  had
increased to four times a week, which he acknowledged was “binge drinking” and self-
medication, where “one day would lead to the next day.” (Tr. 42) He was consuming a
bottle of wine or a fifth of liquor per occasion. (Tr. 45-47, 78) He said it “took a while” to
realize what he was doing. He knows now that he cannot do that. This led him to self-
refer, with some family assistance, to Hospital C in 2017 for treatment and “so I can get
on the right medication.” (Tr. 43)
Applicant  said  he  left  Treatment  Center  P  because  of  anxiety  and  unfamiliarity
with  being  around  a  lot  of  people.  He  said  his  departure  did  not  relate  to  alcohol.  He
now  sees  that  he  should  have  completed  the  program.  He  recognizes  that  he  was  at
“rock-bottom” at the time and does not want to feel that way again. (Tr. 44-45)
Applicant said he resumed drinking socially after about a year of sobriety in about
2018  or  2019  but  consumed  less  alcohol.  (Tr.  39-41)  He  said  “I  knew  myself  enough
that, in a social capacity, I could be able to continue consuming alcohol.”  (Tr. 42) He did
so unilaterally, “coming [to] a personal moment, trying to, you know, see how I do.”  (Tr.
100)  He  acknowledged  that  this  was  “probably  not”   recommended.  He  found  it  a  “big
step”   that he could have one drink and then stop. (Tr. 101) Later, however, during the
COVID-19  pandemic,  when  he  was  at  home  teleworking  full  time,  he  on  occasion
consumed  a  whole  bottle  of  wine  or  a  12-pack  of  beer  at  home  at  one  sitting.  “Every
now and then throughout 2020 I did that,” he said. (Tr. 102)
Applicant  denied  SOR  ¶  1.c,  which  asserts  that  he  engages  in  ongoing  severe
substance  abuse.  (Answer;  Tr.  47-48)  He  testified  that  he  has  made  an  “agreement”
with himself to know his limits. He said he can go months without drinking. He continues
to have one or two drinks on dates or social occasions. He last had a drink three weeks
before the hearing, one or two drinks on a golf course, and then two months before that.
He said he had not been intoxicated in a year or more, when he had “a couple glasses
of mixed drinks” at his brother’s birthday party. (Tr. 49-51, 100)
Applicant  has  never  received  a  medical  opinion  that  he  could  drink  again.  (Tr.
102)  Since  2018,  he  has  sought  no  mental  health  counseling,  except  from  Dr.  J,  his
primary  care  physician.  He  sees  her  every  three  to  four  months  for  medication  refills
and for primary care treatment. He said he has “for the most part”  kept to his medication
regimen since his 2017 treatment, though he has continued drinking on days he took his
medication. He has not sought treatment in the ER since then. (Tr. 102-105)
Applicant  has  not  participated  in  any  drug  or  alcohol  counseling  or  treatment
since  he  left  Treatment  Center  P.  He  has  not  participated  in  AA  meetings.  (Tr.  51-52,
112-113) He said he drinks alcohol less than once a week, and no longer consumes a
bottle of wine or a six-pack of beer at one sitting, as he did in 2020, at the time of  his
DOD evaluation by Dr. B. (Tr. 99-100)
Applicant said he had not used marijuana since 2011 and had not used cocaine
since  2017.  He  had  a  clearance  in  2017  when  he  used  cocaine.  He  used  it  twice,  in
social situations like at a bar. He acknowledged that cocaine and marijuana are illegal
under federal law and inconsistent with holding a clearance. He believes he is subject to
random drug testing at work. (Tr. 53-54, 88, 93-94, 105-107)
Applicant acknowledged that Dr. B’s report shows he used cocaine twice in 2018,
not  2017,  but  he  thinks  he  may  have  meant  2017.  (Tr.  107-108;  GE  3  at  4)  He  also
asserted that statements in Treatment Center P’s records that he used cocaine starting
at age 23 and used cocaine regularly for one year, including five of the past 3 days prior
to  September  26,  2017,  were  “not  accurate.”  Similarly,  he  denied  that  he  had  used
marijuana for four years regularly, asserting that he had not used marijuana since high
school.  (Tr.  108-109;  GE  6  at  2)  He  was  unable  to  explain  why  his  testimony
contradicted Dr. B’s records. (Tr. 109-110)
As to Guideline E, Applicant testified that he first applied for a clearance at age
20, and he was young and did not get good advice from his company on how to fill out
the SCA. He asserted that he did not disclose his 2011 marijuana use on his first SCA
(in 2014) due to naivety and because it occurred in high school, before he turned 18. He
graduated from high school in 2012. (Tr. 27-28, 55-59)
Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  did  not  disclose  his  2017  cocaine  use  or  his
2011 marijuana use on his 2018 SCA. (Tr. 54) He said he held a clearance at the time,
granted  sometime  after  2014.  (Tr.  57-58)  He  testified  that  he  did  not  input  any  new
information on his 2018 SCA. He was just told to “review this and just hit Okay.”  (Tr. 27-
28, 31) He did disclose  his treatments at Hospital C and Treatment  Center P  in 2017,
both  of  which  were  after  his  first  SCA.  (Tr.  32)  He  did  not  intend  to  mislead  the
government.  (Tr.  32)  He  said  he  came  clean  because  he  was  confronted  by  the
interviewer, who had evidence of his cocaine use in his medical records. (Tr. 56-57, 59-
60)
Applicant asserted that his future intention as to illegal drug use is “never to use.”
He  believes  he  is  “well  past  the  dependency  for  it  and  the  self-medication.”  He  will
continue drinking socially but will continue working on cutting back on his drinking. (Tr.
113-115) he said he always uses a ride-share service when he is out drinking and has
never had a DUI or been pulled over by the police. (Tr. 113-115)
Applicant has worked at his DOD job for his whole career. He cannot change the
past but can continue  to  work on  improving himself. He has had  no  criminal issues or
workplace issues. His personal issues have never affected his work life. (Tr. 28-30) He
closed his testimony by stating  that he has presented himself as best he can and has
come a long way in the last eight years. He feels blessed to be where he is today. He
loves his job and wants to continue his career. (Tr. 116-118)
After  the  hearing,  Applicant  retained  counsel,  and  he  submitted  additional
exhibits.  In  a  post-hearing  Declaration,  he  said  he  wished  he  had  completed  the
program  at  Treatment  Center  P  in  2017,  but  still  learned  from  the  experience.  He
reaffirmed that he had not used cocaine or marijuana since leaving the facility. He said
that since his hearing, he has attended AA meetings. He did not see himself as “having
a problem” in the past but now acknowledges that “any use is [too] much.” He has dealt
with  clinical  depression  and  anxiety  for  most  of  his  adult  life  and  has  taken  them
seriously. He has begun vetting therapists so he can pursue regular care and continue
progressing. (AE C) Applicant submitted a signed statement of intent not to use illegal
drugs  in  the  future  and  acknowledged  that  any  violation  was  grounds  for  automatic
revocation of his clearance. (AE E)
Applicant  submitted  character  letters  from  two  longtime  friends  and  from  an
executive  with his employer.  They attest that  Applicant cares about  his job, his family,
his  friends,  and  his  career.  He  has  worked  hard  to  improve  himself.  He  is  very
trustworthy  personally  and  professionally.  He  is  more  mature  and  responsible  than  he
was earlier in his career. He is reliable, trustworthy, and emotionally stable. He should
retain his clearance. (AE D)
It  is  well  established  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.  As  the
Supreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent standard
