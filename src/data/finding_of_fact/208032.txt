Applicant admitted to the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c.~1.i. and 1.k. She denied
SOR  allegations  ¶¶  1.b.,  1.j.  and  1.l.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  38-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  She  has  been
employed  with  the  defense  contractor  since  March  2019.  Applicant  is  separated  from
her spouse, and has one child, age 13. (GX 1 at pages 7, 12 and 21~23.) She attributes
much  of  her  financial  difficulties  to  a  bad  home  environment  that  cause  her  to  leave
home, and resulted in periods of unemployment. (TR at page 39 line 20 to page 40 line
10.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
1.a.,   1.d.~1.f.,   1.h   and   1.k.  Applicant  admits  to  outstanding  student  loans  to
college #1 totaling about $18,668. On October 11, 2022, she submitted documentation
seeking  “loan  rehabilitation.”  (AppX  A,  and  TR  at  page  42  lines  2~7.)  Applying  DOE’s
November  2022  guidance,  noted  above,  I  find  these  student  loans  discharged,  and
deleted as unfavorable entries on Applicant’s credit report. These allegations are found
for Applicant.
1.b. Applicant denies that she has a past-due debt to Creditor B in the amount of
about $4,350. (TR at page 16 line 11 to page 21 line 15.) As this debt appears as past-
due on the Government’s May 2022 credit report; and Applicant has submitted nothing
in  this  regard,  such  as  a  formal  dispute  of  this  entry,  this  allegation  is  found  against
Applicant.
1.c.  and  1.g.  Applicant admits to outstanding student loans to college #2 totaling
about  $5,940.  (TR  at  page  41  line  20  to  page  42  line  1.)  Applying  DOE’s  November
2022  guidance,  noted  above,  I  find  these  student  loans  discharged,  and  deleted  as
unfavorable on Applicant’s credit report. These allegations are found for Applicant.
1.j.  and   1.l.  Applicant  denies  that  she  has  past-due  debts  to  Creditor  J  in  the
amount  of  about  $970.  As  these  alleged  past-due  debts  do  not  appear  on  the
Government’s May 2022 credit report, these allegations are found for Applicant.
