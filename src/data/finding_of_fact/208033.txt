Applicant, 42, has worked for his employer, a federal contracting company, as an
information  technology  professional  since  May  2016.  He  has  worked  for  federal
contracting  companies  since  2002,  when  he  was  initially  granted  access  to  classified
information. The record contains a May 2016 security clearance application. He did not
have  any  derogatory  financial  information  to  report.  The  investigation  uncovered  one
delinquent account, a $35 medical bill. (GE 3 – 4)
In  September  2019,  Applicant’s  wife  was  laid  off  from  her  job  at  which  she
earned over $100,000. Although he did not disclose their total household income before
the  layoff,  he  described  the  loss  of  income  as  “life-altering.”  In  response,  the  couple
decided  to  make  changes  to  their  finances  and  enrolled  in  a  debt  settlement  program
(DSP)  to  address  their  debt  load.  The  couple  enrolled  in  DSP  1  in  October  2019.
Applicant  reported  this  information  to  his  facility  security  officer  (FSO).  He  also
submitted  an  SF-86  certification  in  October  2019,  to  update  the  financial  information
reported  in  the May  2016 application,  stating:  “[w]orking with a  consolidation  company
to get handle on my debts. The process will take  some time and during that  as things
are worked out with the creditors my (and wife’s) credit will be in a state of flux. This will
change as things progress and will keep form updated as needed.” (GE 2)
At  the  time  they  enrolled  in  DSP  1,  Applicant  and  his  wife  did  not  have  any
delinquent debts. They enrolled 15 debts totaling over $128,000 into the program. The
debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.g, 1.i, and 1.j are easily identifiable from the DSP 1
documents. The program told Applicant to stop paying on his accounts, so that DSP 1
could negotiate settlements on the accounts, which the program believed it could do for
approximately $70,000.  Applicant agreed to pay $1,946 each month to the program  to
fund the debt settlements. (GE 2)
A year later, Applicant and his wife transferred to DSP 2, which they believed had
more  favorable  terms.  They  enrolled  10  debts  in  the  program  totaling  $117,000.
Applicant  and  his  wife  agreed  to  pay  $1,631  each  month  for  34  months.  The  debts
alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.g,  1.h,  and  1.j  are  easily  identifiable  from  the  DSP  2
documentation.  DSP  2  indicated  that  they  could  settle  the  debts  for  $33,121.  As  of
January  2021,  Applicant  had  paid  over  $26,000  into  the  program,  which  has  resolved
the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.h as well as one non-SOR debt. (GE 2)
The  credit  reports  in  the  record,  dated  December  2020  and  November  2021,
respectively,  show  that  Applicant  had  a  favorable  credit  history  until  November  2019.
The  delinquent  debts  alleged  in  the  SOR  were  reported  as  becoming  delinquent
between  November  2019  and  October  2021.  Neither  Applicant  nor  his  wife  have  any
open  credit  accounts.  They  are  current  on  all  their  recurring  financial  obligations.
Applicant explained that through this process, he and his wife have learned a lot about
personal finance and their relationship to debt. He states that they will continue to work
diligently to keep their debt at a manageable level. (GE 5-6)
