Applicant admitted to all the allegations in SOR except for allegation ¶ 1.e. After
a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  testimony,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  35-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed with the defense contractor since February of 2022. He is divorced, and has
one child. (GX 1 at pages 5, 12, 24~25 and 29.) Applicant blames his current financial
situation a period of unemployment, COVID-19, making “some bad financial decisions,”
and “living without . . . [his] means.” (TR at page 15 line 1 to page 17 line 1.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
1.a. Applicant filed for the protection of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in June of 2018;
and as a result, his debts at that time were discharged in September of 2018. (Id, and
GX  5.)  Since
that  discharge,  Applicant  has  accumulated  additional  past-due
indebtedness, listed below.
1.b.~1.d.  and   1.f.  Applicant  admits  past-due  debts  to  four  different  creditors
totaling  about  $19,835.  (TR  at  page  17  line  15  to  page  21  line  3.)  Applicant’s  plan  of
action  was  to  take  no  affirmative  action,  but  to  wait  for  his  creditors  to  “reach  out”  to
Applicant.  (TR at page  14  lines  9  to  24.)  He  was informed  that this lack  of  action was
not a good-faith effort to address his past-due indebtedness (TR at page 18 lines 1~13.)
Applicant has submitted nothing further in this regard. These past-due debts are found
against Applicant.
1.e. Applicant denies a past-due debt to Creditor E in the amount of $87. (TR at
page 13 line 1 to page 14 line 8.) As this debt still appears as “outstanding” on one of
the Government’s March  2022 credit reports (GX 3 at page 5), this allegation is found
against Applicant.
