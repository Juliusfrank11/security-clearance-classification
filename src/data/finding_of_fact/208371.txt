Applicant admitted both SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated into the
findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits
submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  41  years  old.  He  graduated  from  high  school  in  2001.  He  has
completed some college classes but not a degree. He served on active duty in the military
from 2004 to 2014 and was honorably discharged. He served in the National Guard from
2014 to 2018 and was honorably discharged. He never married and has no children. He
has worked for a federal contractor since November 2018. (Item 4)
In May 2021 Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA). In it he
disclosed that he failed to file his 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 federal income tax returns.
He stated in the SCA for each tax year that he initially failed to file because “due to finding
time to go to a tax preparer and missed the filing deadline. I had planned to file late, and
I intended to ‘get around to it’ but I never did, and it snowballed.” He further stated:
I am  going  to  sit down with  a  tax  preparer to  attempt to  correct  this situation
and  pay  any  applicable  fees  and  back taxes  required  (or at least  set up  and
start a  payment plan) by the  time  I am  interviewed. The  delay is all  of my
own doing  and I accept that responsibility. (Item  4)
In  June  2021  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator.  He  was
questioned about his failure to timely file his income tax returns. He told the investigator
he did not have a good reason and he was going to speak to a tax preparer to file the
delinquent returns and would provide an update. He said it would never happen again
and in the past seven years he had not failed to file any other federal, state, or other tax
returns as required by law. (Item 5)
Applicant completed government interrogatories in March 2022. He attached email
correspondence between him and a tax preparer from March 2022 acknowledging they
had been employed by Applicant and his request for documented verification to show his
tax returns were being prepared. In the email correspondence, the tax preparer notes he
will  be  preparing  Applicant’s  2016  through  2021  federal  and  state  income  tax  returns.
Applicant acknowledged he would need the preparer to complete his 2016 and 2017 state
income tax returns. He lived in a state during the other years that does not have income
taxes. Applicant’s email stated he had not filed his tax returns since 2015. On April 28,
2022,  Applicant  signed  a  power  or  attorney  allowing  the  tax  preparer  to  complete  his
income tax returns. (Item 6)
Applicant stated in his interrogatories that he did not have a good reason for his
failure  to  timely  file  his  income  tax  returns,  beyond  his  own  anxiety.  He  noted  he  had
engaged a tax preparer to remedy the issue. He said he had panicked when he was late
paying taxes at one point, and it then snowballed and each year he worried more and
more.  At  that  time,  his  income  tax  returns  were  not  yet  filed  but  the  tax  preparer  was
working on them. (Item 6)
Applicant provided an updated response to government interrogatories in October
2022. He explained that his tax service requested his IRS W-2 forms to complete his 2017
and 2018 state tax return. Applicant was advised that the Defense Finance & Accounting
Service (DFAS) did not keep these documents beyond five years. He then requested the
information through his state department of revenue. (Item 6)
In Applicant’s SOR answer, he stated that in December 2022 he mailed his 2016
through  2019  federal income  tax  returns  to  the  IRS.  Due to their age  he  could not file
electronically. His 2020 and 2021 federal income tax returns were filed electronically and
accepted by the IRS on February 7, 2023. As of the same date, he also filed his state
income tax returns for 2017 and 2018. He was still attempting to locate the income data
necessary to file his 2016 state income tax return and had made several attempts through
various agencies to retrieve the data. Once he retrieved the data, his tax preparer would
complete the 2016 state income tax return. Applicant provided appropriate documents to
corroborate his actions. (Item 2)
In Applicant’s response to the FORM, he provided federal income tax transcripts.
His 2016, 2017, and 2018 tax year transcripts reflect they were received in December
2022. His 2019 tax year transcript reflects it was filed by April 15, 2020, which would be
timely. The 2019 tax transcript does not have any financial data in it. It lists Applicant’s
adjusted gross income as $1.00. It notes a representative was appointed on April 6, 2022,
and the IRS received the tax balance owed of $199 on March 27, 2023. This is consistent
with Applicant’s other documents and statements that he did not file timely for 2019. His
other  documents  show  that  for  tax  years  2020  and  2021,  he  filed  electronically  on
February 7, 2023. He electronically filed his 2022 federal tax return on April 25, 2023. He
owed $466 for tax years 2020 and $631 for tax year 2021. He paid the balances on March
27, 2023. (AE A-K)
Applicant confirmed in his FORM response that his 2017 and 2018 state income
tax  returns  were  mailed  in  February  2023.  He  said  he  was  still  unable  to  retrieve
information he needed to file his state tax return for 2016. It is unclear why this information
is not available from his 2016 federal income tax return. He has continued to send letters
and email requests to various state agencies to obtain the information. He intends to file
his 2016 state income tax return when he retrieves the necessary documents. (AE I)
Applicant  stated  in  his FORM response that he  has  addressed  all of  the  issues
raised in the SOR. He does not intend to fall into the trap of anxiety and complacency
again. He was dealing with the death of his father in August 2022 and the uncertainty of
whether the contract for his job would be renewed. He does not use these facts as an
excuse. He got behind on his tax filings and let his worry about how much he might owe
in taxes override his good judgment. He stated it would not happen again. He understands
he made a mistake and can see the consequences for any further failings. (AE I)
Any derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will not be considered
for disqualifying purposes. However, it may be considered in the application of mitigating
conditions, in making a credibility determination, and in a whole-person analysis.
