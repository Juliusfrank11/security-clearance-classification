Applicant, age 35, is unmarried and has no children. (Item 2 at pages 5 and 16.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
1.a.~1.f.   Applicant  admits  to  past-due educational  loans  totaling about  $32,042.
His last payments towards these six loans was in January of 2015, more than eight years
ago.  (Item  5  at  pages  3~5.)  Only  after  the  issuance  of  the  SOR,  did  Applicant  initiate
action to address these very substantial debts. (See Answer and Response.) I find this to
be too little too late. These allegations are found against Applicant.
1.g.  Applicant  admits  a  past-due  debt  of  about  $2,996  to  Creditor  G  related  to
another educational loan. He as submitted nothing in this regard. This allegation is found
against Applicant.
1.h.  and  1.i. Applicant settled his past-due debts to Creditor H, as affirmed by the
Government in its FORM. (FORM at page 3.) These allegations are found for Applicant.
