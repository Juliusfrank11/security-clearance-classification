In  his  SOR  Response,  Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.f  without  further
comment,  but  for  SOR  ¶  1.e,  which  he  admitted  in  part  and  denied  in  part.  His  SOR
admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 60 years old.  He has a high school education. He served  on active
duty in the U.S. Air Force from 1984 to 2005 and was honorably discharged as a tech
sergeant  (E-6).  He  has  worked  for  a  defense  contractor  in  industrial  security  since
February 2018. He was unemployed for most of 2017. He has held a clearance since he
joined the Air Force but for 2012-2015 when he was unemployed. (GE 1; Tr. 41, 60)
Applicant and his first wife married in 1989. They separated in 2012 and divorced
in 2016. He has an adult son from that marriage. He remarried in September 2020. He
and  his  wife  moved  from  state  1  to  state  2  in  February  2022.  He  remains  with  his
employer, and he works from home full time. They moved in anticipation of retirement in
about two or three years. (Tr. 43-47, 56, 58; GE 1)
On  his  2019  SCA,  Applicant  listed  his  three  most  recent  alcohol-related  driving
offenses, in 2015, 2017, and 2019. (GE 1 at 32-40) He had a background  interview in
January 2020. He authenticated and adopted it as accurate in a June 2021 interrogatory
response without making changes. In the interview, he discussed each offense as well
as his counseling, probation requirements, and alcohol involvement. (GE 2; Tr. 62)
Applicant was cited for drinking in public in 1999. (SOR ¶ 1.a) (GE 2, GE 3) He
was in a public park with friends after a softball game. He acknowledged that there was
alcohol  in  his  cooler  and  he  acknowledged  receiving  a  citation,  but  he  denied  that  he
had  been  drinking.  His  most  recent  background  interview  summary  references  an
acknowledgment during a prior investigation that he had been drinking at the time. He
said that at his hearing that he would drink beers after softball but did not do so on that
occasion.  Like  others  who  were  there,  he  paid  the  $50  fine  rather  than  contest  the
matter in court. (Tr. 62-66; GE 2)
All three of Applicant’s DWIs occurred during his separation, after his divorce and
before his 2020 remarriage. (Tr. 114) He was also depressed due to the end of his first
marriage. He had attempted to reconcile with his first wife but was not able to do so. (Tr.
115-116)
In  April  2015,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  misdemeanor  Driving
While Intoxicated (DWI), first offense. He had been at a late lunch with a friend. He was
there for several hours. He said he had two beers and a shot to celebrate the friend’s
birthday. He was pulled over on his way home after making an illegal U-turn. The officer
smelled alcohol on Applicant’s breath, and Applicant blew a 0.14 blood alcohol content
(BAC)  on  a  breathalyzer.  In  July  2015,  he  pled  guilty  to  a  reduced  charge  of
misdemeanor reckless driving. (SOR ¶ 1.b) He received a 30-day suspended jail term, a
$500 fine, and an undetermined term of probation. He attended a 10-hour alcohol safety
awareness program (ASAP) from October to December 2015. (Tr. 66-69; GE 1; GE 4)
Applicant said  he  curtailed  his drinking  after that offense. At the  time, he  said  he
consumed   about  two   to   three   beers  four  or  five   times  a   week.  He  acknowledged
drinking  due  to  depression  about the  end  of his  marriage. He said his divorce  was not
due  to  drinking  but more due  to  unemployment issues  and  lack of conversation.  (Tr. 56-
57, 70-71)
In June 2016, Applicant attended a concert and was there for several hours. He
had  been  drinking beer.  He  was  stopped  at a  checkpoint on  his way  home.  He had  a
BAC  of  0.14.  He  was  arrested  and  charged  with  DWI.  He  pled  guilty  to  a  reduced
charge  of  reckless  driving  in  November  2016.  He  received  a  90-day  suspended  jail
sentence  and  six  months  of  supervised  probation,  until  May  2017.  He  was  also  fined.
He had a restricted license with an ignition interlock device for six months. He attended
an eight-hour ASAP program in early 2017. (Tr. 73-76; GE 5) (SOR ¶ 1.c)
Applicant  was  referred  to  group  counseling  from  November  2016  to  April  2017.
He was also subject to random alcohol testing  about once a week. He abstained from
alcohol  for  six  months,  though  he  failed  one  test.  He  was  also  required  to  attend
Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA)  meetings.  It  was  reinforced  that  he  should  avoid  drinking
and  driving  and  making  the  same  mistakes.  He  learned  how  quickly  his  BAC  will
increase when he drinks, but he did not believe he had a drinking problem. (Tr. 76-81,
105-107)
Applicant  resumed  social  drinking  at  some  point  after  the  counseling  sessions
ended.  (Tr.  82-83)  One  evening  in  February  2019,  he  attended  a  birthday  party  at  a
brewery. He left about 8:30 PM. He had consumed between two and four beers. He was
pulled over for crossing the center line. His BAC was 0.19. Applicant was arrested and
charged with DWI. He pled no contest, He was sentenced to 90 days in jail, all but six
days suspended. He served three days. He received 12 months of supervised probation
and  was  fined  $1,000.  His  license  was  suspended  for  12  months,  with  an  ignition
interlock  device  for  six  months.  He  was  ordered  to  attend  eight  hours  of  ASAP  and
referred to Counseling Center N. (Tr. 71-72, 84-90; GE 6) (SOR ¶ 1.e)
Applicant   acknowledged   one   interlock  ignition   failure,  in   June   2019,  though   he
denied   that   it  was   caused   by   drinking.  He said  it  was   caused   by medication.  (Tr. 100-
104)  He completed  the  counseling from July to  November 2019.  It  was a  small  group, of
about   five   people.  He   denied   that  he   was  told  during   counseling   that  he   should  stop
drinking, and  said  the  counselor said it  was not wrong  to  have  an  occasional  drink.  The
focus was  on  not  drinking  and  driving  and  on  limiting alcohol consumption.  He  found  the
counseling  informative,  and  said,  “I took a  lot  from  that  to  make  sure  I  never put myself
in  that  situation   again.”   The   counseling   center  notified   state   authorities  that  he
completed  the  program, but he  did not receive  a  certificate  or  other documentation. (Tr.
49-55)
Applicant denied that he had ever been diagnosed with an alcohol use disorder,
including  during  his  2019  counseling.  (Answer  to  SOR  ¶  1.e;  Tr.  24,  90)  Even  if  that
were  established,  he  also  denied  that  he  was  aware  of  it.  He  denied  meeting  with  a
medical professional while in counseling. (Tr. 53-54, 91-94, 98)
The interrogatory response (GE 2) asked the following question:
Available information  indicates that from  August 2019  to  September  2019,
you   received   alcohol   counseling   at  [Counseling   Center  N].  You   were
diagnosed with  Alcohol  Use Disorder –  Moderate.
Applicant checked “YES”  without further comment.  (GE 2 at 2) At his hearing, he said
he did not intend to “admit” the diagnosis when he checked “YES.” (Tr. 91-94, 98)
Further,  the  summary  of  Applicant’s  January  2020  background  interview,  which
he  adopted  as  accurate  and  authenticated  without  making  edits  or  further  comment,
contains the following statements:
Subject   has  never  been   professionally   diagnosed   with   abusing   alcohol.
Subject   has  never  been   professionally  diagnosed   as  being   alcohol
dependent. (GE 2 at 10)
The  Government’s  case  does  not  include  independent  documentary  evidence,
from  Counseling  Center  N  or  elsewhere,  to  support  the  allegation  that  Applicant  had
been  diagnosed  with  an  alcohol  use  disorder.  (Tr.  95-96,  123-126)  There  is  also  no
documentation in the record of a recommendation that Applicant should wholly abstain
from alcohol use, for medical or other reasons, and he testified that he never received
such a recommendation or instruction. (Tr. 117)
Applicant said  he  has been  “clean”  for four years. (Tr. 100)  He does not believe
that he  has  a  drinking  problem. (Tr. 107)  He  did not return  to  AA, as he  felt  his issues
were  drinking  and  driving  and  not  due  to  other issues  with  alcohol, like  others.  (Tr. 108)
He has not  pursued  any counseling  beyond  what  he  received  at  Counseling  Center N or
through  court-ordered  AA. He is not in counseling  or treatment currently.  (Tr. 107-108,
117) He  said his support network is his wife, his family, and  good friends.  He remains
close to his son and  his grandchildren, who  live  elsewhere  (Tr. 118)
Applicant drinks “a beer or two once  in a while.”  (Tr. 107) At times he does not
drink  for  one,  two,  or  three  weeks.  (Tr.  109)  He  last  consumed  alcohol  the  weekend
before the hearing, when he had two beers while at home watching sports on television.
(Tr. 111-113) When he drinks, he drinks to moderation, either at home, or when his wife
is  the  designated  driver.  (Tr.  42-43,  59,  113-114)  He  also  acknowledged  that  he  has
mellowed and is “more settled” since he is “getting older.” (Tr. 118)
As a result of his most recent counseling, Applicant stopped going out often. He
also met his wife, which had a significant positive impact on him. They met in 2018 and
have been  together  since 2019.  (Tr. 56-57) He  said his marriage has been a  positive,
stabilizing change in his life. He and his wife stay home or go to dinner with friends. He
believes  moving  to  State  2  has  helped.  They  live  a  “slower-paced  lifestyle  that  they
enjoy.  (Tr.  116)  Applicant  has  had  no  subsequent  arrests  or  offenses  since  2019  and
has no restrictions on his driver’s license. (AE A, AE B)
Applicant  said  he  has  held  a  clearance  for  most  of  the  last  40  years  and  has
never  had  a  security  violation  or  an  employment  issue.  He  values  his  clearance  and
understands its importance. He believes he has made adjustments in his life and is not
a risk to national security. (Tr. 132-133)
Applicant’s supervisor, Mr. P, provided a letter of reference. Mr. P said Applicant
is  a  reliable,  trusted  employee  and  a  solid  team  player.  He  has  a  positive  attitude,
volunteers  for  duties,  and  works  long  hours  to  accomplish  assigned  tasks.  He
exemplifies  the  company’s  core  values  and  is  highly  regarded  for  his  knowledge,
dedication, and professional demeanor. (AE C)
