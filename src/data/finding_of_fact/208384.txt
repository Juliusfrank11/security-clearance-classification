Applicant is a 35-year-old Advanced Distributed Learning Specialist employed by
a federal contractor since April 2018. He was employed as a school band director from
August 2012 to April 2019, and he owned a small retail business from 2016 to early 2017.
He was unemployed from August 2006 to August 2012 while attending college. He has
never held a security clearance. (GE 1; AE F, I; Tr. 10-11, 32-33, 57-58)
Applicant earned a bachelor’s degree in 2013 and a master’s degree in 2016. He
has  taken  college  courses  as  recently  as  September  2018.  He  married  in  September
2013 and has three children, ages 11, 9, and 8 months. (GE 1; Tr. 55-58, 79)
The SOR  alleges 29  delinquent accounts totaling approximately $85,000. (SOR
¶¶ 1.a through 1.cc). In Applicant's Answer to the SOR, he admitted all SOR allegations
with explanation.
Applicant  attributes  his  financial  problems  to  his  purchase  of  a  retail  business
franchise in 2016 and that business’ failure in early 2017. (Answer; GE 1 at 35, 38; Tr.
31-34, 65-67; AE I) He used unsecured  personal credit to  finance the purchase of  the
business, including credit card balance transfers of about $59,500. (Answer; GE 1 at 35,
38; Tr. 31-34, 65-67; AE F, AE G, AE I at 1-7)
In   his  December  2019   SCA,   Applicant  disclosed   approximately  $20,000   of
delinquent  credit  card debt  used  to  finance  his retail business and  said that  those  issues
were  being  resolved.  (GE 1  at 35,  38) He  testified  that after  the  business failed,  he  entered
a   debt  negotiation   agreement   with   a  debt  consolidation   company   (DCC1)   in  January
2017,  to   address   about  $38,000   of  unsecured   debt,   and   he   made   payments  in
accordance  with  that agreement of  $566  monthly for a  couple  of  years.  (Tr. 34-35, 62; AE
A) He reported  that  after DCC1 stopped  operating  in  his state,  he  resolved  some  debts
himself,   and   worked   with   a   credit   repair   company  to   remove   some   accounts   from   his
credit report. (Answer; Tr. 34-35)  Applicant was informed  of the  importance  of submitting
documentary   evidence   of   debt   payments,  efforts  to   contact   creditors   or   to   resolve   or
otherwise address delinquent debts.  (Tr. 7, 13, 34, 42, 48-54, 63-73, 77-86)
Applicant  enrolled  his  debt  with  another  debt  consolidation  company  (DCC2)  in
about March 2021. (Tr. 34-38, 62, 69, 76-77, 85-86; AE C at 4-7) As of March 6, 2023,
15 accounts (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.f-1h, 1.j-1.n, 1.q, 1.t, 1.v, 1.w) were subject to that
program. (AE C at 4-7) As of March 6, 2023, twelve SOR accounts were  “enrolled  . . .
“0%”, one  account was “enrolled  . . . .100%”, one account offer was being  “reworked,”
and one account was paid in full. (AE C at 4; Tr. 70, 74)
As of March 6, 2023, Applicant’s “Total Deposits” under the program  with DCC2
were about $11,060, and he was scheduled to make deposits of $426.50 on March 10,
March 26, and April 10, 2023. (AE C at 1-2; Tr. 70) He said that he paid $840 monthly
under  the  terms  of  his  60-month  program  with  DCC2.  (Tr.  37-38)  He  submitted  an
agreement  dated  March  11,  2022,  which  authorized  deposits  into  an  account  to  pay
DCC2 and debts enrolled in the program. (AE B; Tr. 27, 85) That agreement reflects a
recurring deposit of $840 but does not specify when payments began or were to begin,
or the periodicity of those payments. (AE B at 4-5; Tr. 79-81)
When  Applicant  was  questioned  about  the  discrepancies  between  his  total
deposits  under  the  program  and  his  claimed  monthly  payments  to  DCC2,  he
acknowledged the importance of providing documentary evidence of his actual payments.
I  find  that  Applicant  has  not  made  payments  of  $840  per  month  since  entering  an
agreement with DCC2 in March 2021. It is unclear from the evidence whether he failed to
make  some  required  payments  or  whether  the  required  monthly  payments  were
something other than $840 prior to March 2022. (Tr. at 77-79; AE B-C)
