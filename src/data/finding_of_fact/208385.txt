Applicant is a 42-year-old employee of a government contractor. He has worked
for  his  current  employer  for  the  past  year  and  a  half.  He  has  worked  for  various
government contractors in the information technology (IT) career field since about 2008.
Applicant  states  he  was  first  granted  a  security  clearance  in  approximately  2008.  He
claims he has never had issues with holding a security clearance with the exception of
the  current  security  clearance  proceeding.  (Tr.  40-41)  He  was  awarded  a  high  school
diploma in 2000 and has earned several IT certifications during his career. He married
in 2017, but he and his wife separated about eight months ago. He has two children, a
son,  age  12,  and  a  daughter,  age  10,  from  previous  relationships.  (Tr.  32-35,  40-41;

for
On  May  4,  2018,  Applicant  submitted  an  Electronic  Questionnaire
Investigations  Processing  (e-QIP  or  “security  clearance  application”).  A  subsequent
background  investigation  raised  security  issues  under  Guideline  F  –  Financial
Considerations, and Guideline E – Personal Conduct.
Guideline F –  Financial  Considerations
The SOR alleged eight delinquent debts. They are summarized below.
SOR  ¶   1.a:  $274  medical  account  placed  for  collection.  Applicant  denies  this
debt.  He  does  not  recognize  it.  I  find  for  Applicant  with  respect  to  this  allegation.  The
pleading is not sufficient enough to give him adequate notice of the medical debt.  The
medical debt does not appear on the May 2023 credit report, which is the most recent
credit report in the record. (Answer to SOR; Tr. 43-44; Gov 3; Gov 5 at 1)
SOR  ¶   1.b:  $1,831   debt  owed   to   a   credit   union   that   was   charged   off.   Applicant
denied   this  debt   in  his  answer  to   the   SOR.   He  did  not  recognize  the   debt.   During   the
hearing,  Applicant  admitted   this  was   a   personal  loan.  He   became   aware   of  this  debt
when  he  received  the  SOR.  On  June  19, 2023, Applicant entered  into  a  payment plan
with  a  law firm. He agreed  to  make  the  first payment  on  June  23, 2023. He is to  make
monthly  payments  due   on   the   28th   of  each   month   after  the   first  payment.   He  will   pay
$300   a   month   towards   this  debt.   He  first  reached   out   to   the   credit  union   about   three
weeks before  the  hearing. In  his  post-hearing  submissions, Applicant provided  receipts
that he  has made  three  payments  of $150  each  towards this payment plan  on  June  23,
2023, July 13, 2023, and  July 20, 2023. (Answer to  SOR; Tr.  44-47;  Gov  5  at  1;  Gov  6
at  2; Gov 7 at 6;  AE C: AE H)
SOR  ¶   1.c:   $261  debt  owed  to  a  credit  union  that  was  charged  off.  In  his
response to the SOR, Applicant denied this debt because he did not recall it. When he
reached out to the credit union, they had no record of this debt. The August 2021 credit
report  indicates  that  this  debt  was  a  paid  charge  off.  I  find  SOR  ¶  1.c  for  Applicant.
(Answer to SOR, Tr. 48- 49; Gov 3 at 1; Gov 4 at 3; Gov 6 at 2; Gov 7 at 6)
SOR  ¶¶1.d,  1.f  and   1.g  alleged  three  delinquent  child  support  debts  in  the
respective amounts of $2,461, $14,985 and $12,667 that were all placed for collection.
In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admits  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶1.d  and  1.f.  He
denies the allegation  in  SOR  ¶1.g.  He claims  he makes two  child support payments –
one  for  his  daughter  and  one  for  his  son.  He  claims  he  only  owes  about  $2,000  in
arrears for his son. He owes a little more for his daughter. Applicant claims the mother
of his daughter overstated his income by $15,000. He currently pays $860 monthly child
support  for his  daughter;  $800  of  which  is  the  monthly  support  and  $60  goes  towards
arrears. His monthly child support for his son is about the same.  (Tr. 53 – 55; Gov 6 at
2)
Applicant  was given the  opportunity to provide  documents  that show his history
of  child  support payments  for  each child  as well as  the  current  child  support balances
for each child. He did not provide any documents showing this. His pay statement from
his current employer shows that $191.23 is deducted each pay period for court-ordered
child  support.  Applicant  testified  during  the  hearing  that  his  paycheck  is  garnished  for
his  son’s  child  support.  He  provided  no  further  proof  of  his  history  of  child  support
payments  for  either  child.  I  cannot  conclude  he  is  timely  paying  his  child  support
obligations  for  each  child  without  more  specific  documentation.  (Tr.  53-60,  105-109;
Gov 6 at 2; AE E)
SOR  ¶   1.e:  $22,945  delinquent  automobile  debt  that  has  been  charged  off  by
Auto Dealer #1.  Applicant purchased this car after he expected his mother to take over
the payments for the loan on the automobile that is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.h. He fell behind
in  payments  and  returned  the  car  to  Auto  Dealer  #1.  He  received  notice  about  the
deficiency  judgment  in  2017  or  2018  after  the  dealer  sold  the  car.  Auto  Dealer  #  1
recently offered to accept a lump sum payment of $11,000 or three payments of $7,000
each.  Applicant  testified  that  he  can’t  afford  the  payments.  The  last  time  he  spoke  to
Auto Dealer # 1 was the  Monday before the hearing. (Tr. 60-64, 112-113; Gov 6 at 2;
Gov 7 at 4) The delinquent automobile loan debt remains unresolved.
SOR  ¶   1.h:  $17,020  automobile  loan  that  was  charged  off  by  a  credit  union.
Applicant’s mother was unable to get an automobile loan. Applicant agreed to give his
mother his car as long as she made the payments on the  loan. Applicant then bought
the car that is mentioned in SOR ¶ 1.e. After a couple months, Applicant’s mother failed
to make the payments. Applicant turned the car in because he could not afford to make
payments on two cars. He thought it was a profit-and-loss write off. He never received a
1099(c)  form  showing  cancellation  of  the  debt  by  the  creditor.  He  initially  claimed  the
credit  union  never  contacted  him  about  the  delinquent  car  loan.  Under  cross-
examination,  he  admitted  that  he  received  a  notice  that  he  owed  a  deficiency  on  the
loan, but never paid it. The debt is unresolved. (Tr. 49-52, 109-112; Gov 7 at 6-7)
Applicant  has  had  several  periods  of  unemployment.  He  was  terminated  from
one  employer  in  July  2021.  Applicant  testified  that  he  was  laid  off  for  a  period  of  four
months  in 2020.  He  was  unemployed  for over a  year after his 2008  arrest.  He  served
three months in jail and lived in a halfway house for nine months. (Tr. 36-39, 100-102)
Applicant   purchased   another  car  in  2020.   The  May  2023   credit  report  lists  the
automobile  loan  for this car as  charged  off.  He testified  that  his  estranged  wife  has  the
car and  he  believed  that she  was making  the  payments  on  the  car. (Tr. 113-114;  Gov  3
at 5) Applicant testified  that he  is not sure about the  status of his federal taxes, but he
does  have  two  state  income  tax liens  in  the  amount  of  $5,000.  Applicant  reached  out  to
the state  to  enter into  a  payment agreement a  few weeks before  the  hearing. After the
hearing, he  provided  a  repayment agreement.  He agreed  to  pay $168  monthly towards
his delinquent  state  tax debt  starting  on  July  19,  2023. His credit  card is charged  each
month.  This  debt  appears  to   be   from   the   2017   tax  year.   The   state   filed   two   tax  liens.
One   lien   has   a   balance   of  $2,920.03.  The   other   lien   has  a   balance   of  $5,024.61.  (Tr.
115-116; Gov 9; Gov 10: AE I)
The 2020 delinquent car loan and the state tax liens are not alleged in the SOR. I
will not consider them under matters of disqualification. I will consider them for purposes
of  extenuation  and  mitigation.  Conduct  not  alleged  in  the  SOR  may  be  considered  to
assess  Applicant’s  credibility;  to  decide  whether  a  particular  adjudicative  guideline  is
applicable; to evaluate evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances;
to consider whether Applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; or as part of
a whole-person analysis. ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)
income
Applicant’s  net  monthly
is  $7,200.  His  monthly  expenses  are
approximately  $5,530.  The  expenses  include  $1,700  for  child  support.  The  only  debts
he  listed  were the debt  repayment plan  with the  law firm  for the  credit  union  debt and
the state tax lien debt. The total for that amount was $500.00. He listed a net monthly
remainder of $2,400. However, after subtracting his monthly expenses from his monthly
income, Applicant actually has $1,170 remaining each month. (AE K)
On  June  12,  2023,  Applicant  completed  four  online  financial  courses,  including
Road Map to Financial Freedom; Identity Theft Protection; Power of Paycheck Planning;
and Understanding Credit Reports. (AE A).
Guideline E  – Personal Conduct
Under Personal Conduct, the SOR alleged 12 allegations.
SOR ¶  2.a:  Cross alleges all  of the  allegations  under Guideline  F, SOR ¶¶  1.a  –
1.h.  I find for Applicant under this allegation.  The issues related  to  SOR ¶¶ 1.a  –  1.h  are
more  appropriately addressed  under the Financial Considerations concern.
SOR  ¶   2.b:   In  September  2002,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  (1)
Possession  with  Intent  to  Distribute  Marijuana  (two  counts),  (2)  Carry  Pistol  without  a
License –  1st  Offense,  and  (3) Unregistered  Ammunition.  Applicant  was found  guilty  of
two   counts  of   Possession   with   Intent  to   Distribute   Marijuana   and   sentenced   to   24
months  incarceration,   three   years  supervised   release   and   three   years  probation.
Applicant  admits  this  offense.  He   testified   that  his  gun  was   registered   in  State   1.  He
drove   to   a   nearby   state   (State   2)   to   visit   his  father.  The   police   stopped   him   and
discovered  the  gun  in  his possession. Applicant  claims  the  jail time  was suspended.  He
was on  probation  for three  years,  which  he  successfully  completed. (Tr. 66-69; Gov 14
at 4)
Under  cross  examination,  Applicant  testified  he  was  not  sure  he  possessed
marijuana during  the arrest  even though he was  initially  charged with  Possession with
Intent  to  Distribute  Marijuana.  He  said  the  first  time  he  used  marijuana  was  in  high
school around 1999. The last time he used marijuana was in 2019. He used marijuana
occasionally at a get togethers or parties. He used marijuana approximately every two
or  three  months.  When  asked  if  there  was  a  time  when  he  did  not  use  marijuana,
Applicant testified he did not use marijuana when he was on probation for the 2002 and
2008 offenses and around 2013-2014. (Tr. 119-121; Gov 2 at 7) Applicant’s marijuana
use was not alleged in the SOR. It will not be considered for disqualification purposes,
but will be considered under matters of extenuation and mitigation.
SOR  ¶   2.c:
In  May  2007,  a  temporary  restraining  order  (TRO)  was  issued
against  Applicant.  He  admits  this  occurred.  Applicant’s  two  sisters  reached  out  to  him
because their father’s new girlfriend was not treating them well. They asked him to talk
to  their  father  about  the  mistreatment.  Applicant  went  to  visit  his  sisters’  father  to  talk
with  him  about  the  issue.  His  sister’s  father filed  the  TRO  against  him,  after  Applicant
confronted  him  about  the  father’s  girlfriend  mistreating  his  sisters.  The  TRO  was  later
dismissed because neither party showed up in court. (Tr. 70-72, 121-124; Gov 12)
SOR  ¶   2.d:
In   November  2008,  Applicant   was  arrested   and   charged   with   (1)
Carry  Pistol  without  a   License;  (2)  Unlawful  Possession   of  Firearm   –  Felony,(3)
Possession   of   Unregistered   Firearm,  and   (4)  Unlawful   Possession   of   Ammunition.
Applicant  plead   guilty  and   was  sentenced   to   18   months   confinement   with   six   months
confinement   suspended;   three   years   supervised   release   and   one   year  of   probation.
Applicant testified  he  served  three  months confinement and  lived  in  a  halfway house  for
nine   months.  He   also   believed   he   served   probation   between   one   to   three   years.
Applicant  testified  that  he  always carried  a  firearm  on  his person  after he  was shot six
times in  1999 during  a  robbery. He felt the need to  carry protection. He no longer carries
a firearm for protection. (Tr. 72-75, 124-127; Gov 13; Gov 14 at  5)
SOR  ¶   2.e:  Applicant  was  arrested   and   charged   with   (1)  Fail   To   Obey
Reasonable/Lawful  Order,  (2)  Hindering/Obstructing,  (3)  Resist/Interfere   with   Arrest.
Applicant  says   he   was  pulled   over  by  the   police.  He   provided   his  driver’s  license,
vehicle  registration,   and   proof  of  insurance.    When  the   police   asked   for  consent   to
search  his  car,  he   refused   to   provide   consent.   He  states  the   charges  were   dropped
because   it  was  “a   bogus  charge.”   He   claims  he   never  retained   a   lawyer  and   did  not
have  to  appear in court. (Tr. 77-79, 127-128; Gov 14 at 7)
SOR  ¶  2.f:  In February 2012, a Temporary Protection Order (TPO) was issued
against  Applicant.  This  involved  the  mother  of  his  son.  They  got  into  an  argument
because  he  was  not  allowed  to  see  his  son.  There  are  differing  recollections  of  what
happened during the argument. Applicant claims his son’s mother swung a key ring at
him and he pushed her in a reflexive response. His son’s mother claimed he hit her in
the right eye causing her to fall and hit her head on the concrete steps. He claims she
fell accidentally. After the incident, he got in his car and drove away. He never violated
the TPO which eventually expired. In 2016 or 2017, the parties entered into a custody
agreement.  Applicant  states  they  no  longer  argue  now  that  they  have  a  legal  custody
agreement.  He  does  not  see  his  son’s  mother  often.  Both  parties  keep  their  distance
from each other. His son is 12 now.  (Tr. 79-83, 128-130; Gov 15)
SOR  ¶   2.g:   In  July 2013,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  Assault  and
Battery.  This incident involved an argument with his daughter’s mother about not being
able  to  see  his  daughter.  Applicant  showed  up  at  his  daughter’s  mother’s  house  and
they got into an argument. His daughter’s mother claimed he spit in her face. Applicant
denies this. She also claimed Applicant took her I-Pad and a purse from her home and
poured  motor  oil  inside  her  car.  Applicant  denies  this  conduct.  They  did  not  have  a
custody  agreement.  His  daughter’s  mother  has  sole  custody.  Applicant  claims  he  has
attempted  to  file  for  custody,  but  is  unable  to  because  he  does  not  know  where  the
mother  of  his  daughter  lives.  Although  he  was  arrested,  the  charges  were  dropped
because  his  daughter’s  mother did  not  appear  on  the  court  date.  (Tr.  85-88,  131-133;
Gov 16)
SOR ¶  2.h: In August 2015, a final protective order was issued against Applicant.
This  involved  an  altercation  with  the  mother  of  his  son.  He  approached  her  at  a
business  and  confronted  her.  He  began  to  threaten  her  and  pulled  her  hair.  He
threatened to mess her up and kill her.  Applicant eventually left the business and drove
away. He denies pulling her hair and threatening her.  (Tr. 89-90, 134-135; Gov 18)
SOR  ¶   2.i:  In  September  2015,  Applicant  received  a  citation  for  Possession  of
Drug Paraphernalia. He states he was pulled over and the police discovered a grinder
and rolling papers. Applicant admits this. He states he could either pay the fine or show
up in court to contest the citation. He showed up in court and the case was dismissed.
He was not sure if he held a security clearance at the time of this incident.  The arrest
report indicates the police discovered a silver grinder, a mini bong pipe and 1.5 grams
of  marijuana.  On  December  7,  2015,  Applicant  appeared  in  court.  The  charges  were
placed on the STET docket. (Tr. 92, 136; Gov 17)
SOR  ¶   2.j:   In  December  2016,  an  interim  protective  order  was  issued  against
Applicant.  This  incident  involved  a  woman  he  had  been  seeing.  In  her  petition,  the
woman  stated  she  was  Applicant’s  ex-girlfriend.  She  claimed  Applicant  verbally  and
physically  assaulted  her  over  a  one-year  period.  She  tried  to  avoid  contact  with
Applicant. On December 27, 2016, she was walking to her car around 10:30 pm when
Applicant  jumped  out  of  the  bushes  and  attacked  her.  She  was  able  to  get  in  her  car
and drive away. Applicant followed her a couple miles down the road. Applicant’s former
girlfriend did not show up in court. He has not seen her since this incident. (Tr. 91-92,
136-137; Gov 19)
Applicant testified that he has not been involved in any physical altercations with
anyone since the December 2016 incident. (Tr. 139)
SOR  ¶   2.k:   Applicant  is  alleged  to  have  falsified  material  facts  on  his  May  4,
2018,  e-QIP  in  response  to  Section  26- Financial  Record  Delinquency  Involving
Routine  Accounts.  More  specifically,  in  response  to  “In  the  last  seven  (7)  years,  you
had bills or debts turned over to a collection agency? …. In the last seven (7) years, you
had any account or credit card, suspended, charged off, or cancelling for failure to pay
as agreed? . . . In the last seven (7) years, you have been over 120 days delinquent on
any debt not previously entered? . . . You are currently over 120 days delinquent on any
debt.”  Applicant answered “No” and is alleged to have deliberately failed to disclose the
debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b,  1.c, 1.e, and 1.h. (Gov 1)  Applicant testified that this was
probably  an  oversight  on  his  part.  He  said  he  was  in  a  rush  to  complete  his  e-QIP
application.  (Tr.  95-98;  Gov  1)  I  do  not  find  Applicant’s  explanation  for  omitting  his
delinquent debts on his May 2018 security clearance application to be credible.
SOR ¶ 2.l:  Applicant is alleged to have falsified material facts on his May 4, 2018
e-QIP  in  response  to  “Section  23- Illegal  Use  of  Drugs  or  Drug  Activity  While
Possessing  a  Security  Clearance.  Have  you  EVER  illegally  used  or  otherwise  been
illegally  involved  with  a  drug  or  controlled  substance  while  possessing  a  security
clearance other than previously listed?” Applicant answered “No” and is alleged to have
deliberately  failed to disclose  his 2015  citation as  set  forth in SOR  ¶  2.i, above, or his
possession of marijuana when he was arrested in November 2008 as alleged in SOR ¶
2.d, above. Applicant testified  that  this was probably an oversight on  his part. He  said
he was in a rush to complete his e-QIP application. He indicates that he did list the more
severe felony charge. (Tr. 93- 98; Gov 1)
I  find  for  Applicant  with  regard  to  SOR  ¶  2.l.  My  basis  for  doing  so  is  there  no
information  in  the  record  that  indicates  Applicant  possessed  an  active  security
clearance at the time of his felony arrest in 2008 or in 2015 when he received a citation
for  possession  of  drug  paraphernalia.  There  is  no  evidence  indicating  Applicant  was
granted access to classified information other than his own assertions. While he worked
as  a  contractor  for  government  agencies,  no  information  has  been  provided  regarding
whether he held an active security clearance in the past. In addition, Applicant listed the
2008  felony  charge  and  conviction  in  response  to  section  22  –  Police  Record  on  the
same May 2018  security  clearance  application,  which  provided adequate notice  to the
government regarding this arrest and conviction. (Gov 1 at 28)
Applicant’s  testimony  during  the  hearing,  that  he  used  marijuana  on  occasion,
every  three  of  four  months  since  he  was  in  high  school  up  to  2019,  raises  additional
falsification  concerns  regarding  his  answer  on  his  May  4,  2018,  security  clearance
application. Specifically, Section 23 – Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity – Illegal Use
of  Controlled  Substances  – “In  the  last  seven  (7)  years  have  you  illegally  used  any
drugs  or  controlled  substances?  Use  of  a  drug  or  controlled  substance  includes
injecting, snorting, inhaling, swallowing, experimenting with or otherwise consuming any
drug or controlled substance” Applicant answered, “No”.  During the hearing, Applicant
admitted  to  occasional  marijuana  use  beginning  in  high  school  to  2019.  There  were
times  he  did  not  use  marijuana.  Within  the  past  7  years,  he  testified  he  did  not  use
marijuana  in  2013-2014.  Apparently,  he  used  marijuana  illegally  on  numerous
occasions  between  May  2011  to  2013  and  from  2015  to  2019.  He  used  marijuana
before  and  after  submitting  his  May  2018  security  clearance  application.  While
Applicant’s failure to disclose his marijuana use in response to the Section 23 question
above, is not alleged in the SOR, it will be considered under matters of extenuation and
mitigation.
Character Reference
Applicant’s  supervisor  provided  a  reference  letter  on  his  behalf.  He  states
Applicant  “consistently  demonstrates  a  remarkable  work  ethic  and  commitment  to  his
responsibilities.”  He  is  always  willing  to  take  on  additional  tasks  whenever  needed.
Applicant  consistently  displays  honesty,  dependability,  and  follows  organizational
policies  and  guidelines.  He  is  meticulous  when  following  security  protocols,  which
significantly  contributed  to  maintaining  the  confidentiality  and  security  of  sensitive
information  within the organization.  His  supervisor  believes  Applicant’s  retention  of his
security clearance would be within the best interest of the organization. (AE D)
