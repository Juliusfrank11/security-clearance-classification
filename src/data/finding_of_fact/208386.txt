Applicant  admitted  the  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  1.a  and  essentially  denied  the
allegations in ¶¶ 1.b through 1.r.  After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings,
testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 35 years old. She married in 2022 and does not have children. She
attended college at different times from 2006 to 2018. She earned an associate degree.
She has been employed by a federal contractor since May 2021. (GE 1)
Applicant  testified  that  her  parents  divorced  in  2008.  Her  father  had  a  drug
addiction and sold drugs to finance his habit. He is in federal prison serving a 23-year
sentence. She said he ruined her credit when he opened credit cards in her name in about
2010. Because of the amount of debt, her credit score was poor and when she went to
purchase a vehicle, she had to pay a high interest rate. (Tr. 42-47; AE H, W)
In  July 2015, Applicant  was the  victim  of a  horrific car accident  when  she  was hit
by a  drunk driver. She  suffered  serious  injuries and  was hospitalized  for six weeks.  She
had  numerous  surgeries and  was on  short-term  disability. At the  time,  she  was  employed
and   was  also   attending   college.  She   returned   to   work  part-time   after  four  months  and
received  short-term  disability,  which  was  60%  of her normal pay. The  driver of  the  vehicle
was uninsured,  and  Applicant did not have  uninsured  motorist insurance. She  testified
that  most  of  her medical bills were  covered  by her  insurance,  but she  was  responsible  for
those  medical bills not  covered.  The  driver was ordered  to  pay  restitution  ($29,521) to
Applicant as part of his probation  but paid only $1,700.  She  did not contact the  medical
creditors to  propose  a  payment  plan  to  resolve  the  unpaid medical debts alleged. (Tr. 26-
42, 63-64, 103-104; AE G, H, I)
In  May  2021,  Applicant  completed  a  security  clearance  application  (SCA).  She
disclosed she was unemployed from April 2018 to June 2018. She testified that she was
underemployed at different times in the past. She disclosed that she failed to file her 2019
federal income tax return. She stated: “I haven’t had a chance to file my 2019 taxes. I do
not owe money for 2019, it will be a refund. I am having an accountant work on it. I just
finished 2020 taxes.” (Tr. 54-55; GE 1)
In  July  2021,  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator.  She
explained she had not filed her 2019 federal income tax return and was in the process of
having her accountant prepare it, and it would be filed within the next month or so. She
anticipated receiving a refund. She said she was otherwise current on all of her federal,
state, and local taxes. She explained that she had financial issues because of her 2015
car accident, hospitalization for several months, the driver being uninsured, and she did
not have uninsured motorist insurance. (GE 2)
In Applicant’s  SOR answer, she provided a document showing her 2019 federal
tax return was filed in April 2022 and she was entitled to a refund. Applicant testified that
because  of  the  nature  of  her  work  she  is  not  at  home  often.  Her  tax  documents  were
being  forwarded  to  a  former  residence.  She  said  she  was  surprised  to  hear  that  her
accountant had not filed her 2021 or 2022 tax returns. She acknowledged that she failed
to follow up on her inquiries to him. She also testified she thought her tax returns for the
past  two  years  were  completed.  In  her  post-hearing  submission,  she  provided
photographs of text message threads to her accountant from April 2022 requesting him
to complete her tax forms for tax year 2021. The threads are incomplete and only provide
the  first  two  lines  of  the  conversation.  The  thread  then  has  a  May  2022  date  where
Applicant is apparently sending her accountant some information. It then jumps to June
28  and  July  13,  but  does  not  indicate  a  year  and  appears  to  be  from  2023.  She  is
requesting the status of her 2021 tax returns so she can provide the judge the information.
The information provided in this document is incomplete and is indecipherable. I am not
in a position to guess what the rest of the text said or what tax year is being discussed.
(Tr. 64-70, 119-122; GE 1; AE C, X)
Post-hearing, Applicant provided an IRS document to show she e-signed her 2022
federal tax return on July 13, 2023, and she owes $17,304, which includes penalties and
interest.  No  evidence  was  provided  to  show  the  tax  debt  was  paid  or  a  payment
arrangement was made. No evidence was provided to show Applicant has filed her 2021
federal tax return. (AE Y)
Applicant also disclosed in her SCA that she had debts turned over to collection
agencies. She specifically listed the medical debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.i ($1,555) and 1.o
($280). She also disclosed in the SCA the three credit card debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.j
($949), 1.l ($693), and 1.m ($566). For each of the debts she said her 2015 car accident
caused her to have financial issues. The driver at fault was to pay her restitution and did
not. She fell behind on her bills while she was recuperating and on short-term disability.
She stated for each collection account that she was “looking into debt consolidation.” She
did not disclose any of  her student loans.  She did not dispute the legitimacy of any of
these debts that she disclosed. (GE 1)
Applicant  acknowledged  to  the  investigator  during  her  interview  that  she  was
responsible for some medical debts related to her accident, specifically the debts alleged
in SOR ¶¶ 1.i and 1.o that she disclosed. She said she intended to pay them as soon as
she  was  able.  In  her  SOR  answer,  Applicant  acknowledged  incurring  these  debts  but
disputes their legitimacy because they resulted from medical treatment she received after
being the victim in a car accident where the driver was uninsured. She testified that she
paid  these  debts  and  would  provide  proof  of  payment.  She  did  not.  These  debts  are
unresolved. (Tr. 86-88, 93-95)
Applicant acknowledged to the investigator that she was responsible for the credit
card debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.j, 1.l, and 1.m and intended to pay these debts when she was
able. In her SOR answer, Applicant acknowledged she incurred the credit card debts in
SOR ¶¶ 1.j and 1.l but said she was unable to pay the debts after she was the victim of a
drunk driving accident with an uninsured motorist.  In her SOR answer, she denied the
debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.m.  She  testified  that  she  only  had  one  credit  card  at  the  time  of  her
accident and has disputed the others through Credit Karma. This is inconsistent with the
debts she disclosed in her SCA. She has not contacted the creditors to obtain information
about the debts. The debts have different account numbers and were opened at different
times. She also denied the debt in SOR ¶ 1.p ($198). She testified that this is a medical
debt for an emergency room visit from 2021. She did not have medical insurance. She
said she paid it and would provide proof. She did not. These debts are unresolved. (Tr.
88-93, 95-96, 104-105; Answer to SOR; GE 2, 4)
Applicant was confronted by the investigator with the debt alleged in SOR  ¶ 1.e
($2,899). She believed it was a car loan and she was going to contact the creditor to make
payment arrangements to settle the debt. In Applicant’s SOR answer, she acknowledged
the debt existed, but disputes its legitimacy. She noted the debt is now charged off and
does not appear on her April 2022 credit report. She testified that prior to her accident
she missed one car payment on this loan. After her accident the debt became delinquent,
and  she  was  unable  to  make  the  payments  and  it  was  repossessed.  She  has  not
contacted the creditor in the past eight years. She testified she intended to pay the debt.
The debt is unresolved. (Tr. 81-85; AE E)
Applicant was confronted with the delinquent student loans alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b
($5,102), 1.c ($3,943), 1.d ($3,795), 1.f ($2,610), 1.g ($2,175), 1.h ($1,831), 1.k ($716)
and  1.n  ($353).  She  told  the  investigator  that  she  was  attempting  to  have  the  loans
consolidated  and  intended  to  pay  them  as  soon  as  she  was  able.  These  loans  were
delinquent  before  the  pandemic.  In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  she  admitted  the
student loans alleged are hers but denied the debts are currently owed because there is
a moratorium on student loan payments due to the pandemic. She testified she has not
yet consolidated the loans but still planned to do so. (Tr. 70-81, 102; AE D)
Applicant  testified  that she  started  college  in 2006,  took  2007 off, and  resumed
classes in 2008. She was taking two classes a semester and took the summers off. She
was also working full time. She said from 2008 to 2015 she was only taking two classes
a year. She had a scholarship for her tuition in 2006, but not for the other periods she
attended, for which she took student loans. After her 2015 car accident she took off one
to two years before returning to school. She said she took classes before she moved in
2020. She said she made one payment towards her student loans and then they were
paused  due  to  the  pandemic.  The  documented  loan  payment  of  $25  was  paid  in  May
2022. She acknowledged that she was aware her student loans were delinquent before
the pandemic and sometime in 2020 she was receiving notices from the creditors that the
loans  were  delinquent.  She  did  not  contact  the  creditors  to  obtain  an  income-based
payment plan or consolidate the loans. (Tr. 70-81, 102; Answer to the SOR; GE 2; AE D,
K, L)
Applicant was confronted by the investigator with the debt in SOR ¶ 1.r ($6,923).
She  acknowledged  that  she  had  a  car  loan  with  the  creditor  and  the  vehicle  was
repossessed because she could no longer make the payments. She was unaware there
was  an  outstanding  balance,  and  she  had  not  received  any  communication  from  the
creditor concerning the account. She intended to contact the creditor and make payment
arrangements to settle the debt. In her SOR answer, she acknowledged incurring the debt
by financing a vehicle she purchased for her boyfriend who was to make the payments,
but he did not and abandoned the vehicle. She indicated that her April 2022 credit report
showed that the debt is charged off. Her June 2023 credit report shows the account was
opened in March 2018 and her last activity was July 2018. She testified that this debt was
for a car she purchased and returned after six weeks because she no longer could afford
the payments when she had to move unexpectedly.  This contradicts her SOR answer.
She  said  she  contacted  the  creditor  several  weeks  before  her  hearing  and  had  a
settlement  offer.  In  her  post-hearing  submission,  she  provided  a  document  from  the
creditor offering her options to settle the debt. She did not provide any other evidence
regarding whether she accepted an option and made a payment. The debt is unresolved.
(Tr. 97-99; Answer to SOR; GE 2, 5; AE E)
Applicant was confronted with the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.q ($161) owed for cable
services.  She  moved  residences  and  left  the  equipment  with  her  roommate  who  was
supposed to cancel the account and return the equipment. Her roommate failed to do so,
and Applicant was billed for the equipment. She intended to pay the debt as soon as she
was able. In her SOR answer, she provided proof that she settled ($105) the debt in May
2022. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 96-97; AE F)
The SOR allegations are corroborated by Applicant’s disclosures in her SCA, her
answer  to  the  SOR,  her  interview  with  a  government  investigator,  and  her  testimony.
Credit reports from June 2021, February 2022 and June 2023 also corroborate the debts
alleged. (GE 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
Applicant testified that her current finances are stable, and she pays her monthly
expenses on time. She and her husband rent a house but spend minimal time there due
to the nature of their jobs. She has not participated in any credit or financial counseling.
(Tr. 56-63, 124-126; AE S, T, U, V)
Witnesses  testified  on  Applicant’s  behalf.  They  described  her  as  having  good
judgment,  and  testified  that  her  financial  issues  are  in  her past  and  do  not  impact  her
character.  She  pays  her  current  bills  on  time  and  is  organized.  Applicant  provided
character letters that describe her as trustworthy, caring, loyal, hardworking, dependable,
enthusiastic, honest, reliable, and responsible. (Tr. 126-148 AE M, N, O, P, R)
Any derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will not be considered
for disqualifying purposes. It may be considered in the application of mitigating conditions,
in making a credibility determination, and in a whole-person analysis.
