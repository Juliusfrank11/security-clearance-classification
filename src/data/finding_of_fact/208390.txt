Applicant is a 38-year-old employee of a government contractor for whom he has
worked  since  November  2019.  He  has  been  employed  by  government  contractors
without a  period  of unemployment  since  about  July 2014.  He has been  married  twice.
His first marriage was from 2008 until 2013. He remarried in November 2014. He has a
13-year-old  child  who  lives  in  Country  A  with  his  ex-wife,  and  three  children,  ages
seven,  four,  and  two,  with  his  current  wife.  He  also  has  an  adult  stepson  who  lives  in
Country  A.  He  and  his  wife  are  expecting  another  child.  He  earned  a  high  school
diploma  in  2002  and  has  taken  some  college  courses  but  has  not  earned  an
undergraduate degree. He served with the Army National Guard from 2002 until 2007,
when he earned an honorable discharge. He also served on active duty with the Army
from 2007 until 2013 and received a general discharge under honorable conditions for
patterns of misconduct. (Tr. 21-41, 43-44, 88-92; GE 1, 2)
In  the  SOR,  the  Government  alleged  Applicant’s  eight  delinquent  debts  totaling
approximately  $60,500  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.h).  These  delinquencies  consist  of  the
following: a credit card (SOR ¶ 1.a); a personal loan (SOR ¶ 1.b); car loans (SOR ¶¶ 1.c
and  1.d);  and  tuition  for  college  courses  (SOR  ¶¶  1.e  through  1.h).  He  admitted  the
SOR allegations with additional comments. The SOR allegations are established by his
admissions and the Government’s credit reports. (Answer; GE 3-5)
The  debts  listed  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.d,  are  owed  to  the  same  creditor.
Applicant opened these accounts in 2014 and 2015 and became delinquent on them in
about December 2015. He called the creditor to try to make a payment arrangement in
2020, early 2021, and May 2021, but he claimed the creditor asked him to work with the
collection  agency  to  which  the  debts  had  been  assigned.  The  collection  agency  for
these  debts  has  not  contacted  him  and  he  has  not  been  able  to  obtain  its  contact
information.  His  last  payment  on  these  accounts  was  in  November  2015  and  the  last
time  he  attempted  to  contact  either  the  creditor  or  the  collection  agency  was  in  May
2021. He has not resolved these debts. (Tr. 45-53, 55-63, 65-66; Answer; GE 1-5)
The  debts  listed  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.e  through  1.h  for  college  tuition  are  owed  to  the
college  he  attended.  He  incurred  these  debts  from  August  2016  until  May  2017.  The
college notified him that he was delinquent on these debts in the winter of 2017. During
the  winter  of  2017,  he  went  to  the  college  to  try  to  resolve  the  issue.  He  told  a
representative of the college that he thought the GI Bill should have covered his tuition.
He left the college that day thinking that the GI Bill would pay his outstanding tuition and
he believed the matter was resolved. (Tr. 66-72; Answer; GE 1-3)
He  did  not  follow  up  again  with  the  college  until  2020  when  he  received  a
collection letter from a collection agency regarding his outstanding tuition. He called the
collection agency  and made  a payment  arrangement  with  them.  He  also  went  back  to
the college and explained again that he thought the GI Bill should cover the tuition. He
left the college once again believing that the matter was resolved, and the GI Bill would
pay the tuition. Based upon this understanding, he did not make any payments pursuant
to  the  payment  arrangement  he  made  with  the  collection  agency.  He  noticed  that  the
tuition  debts  no  longer  appear  on  his  credit  report,  so  he  took  that  fact  as  further
evidence  that  the  debts  had  been  resolved.  He  has  not  followed  up  with  either  the
college  or  the  collection  agency  since  2020  to  determine  whether  the  tuition  bill  has
been satisfied. He provided no documents showing that the GI Bill should or did pay his
tuition,  which  is  especially  important  given  the  nature  of  his  discharge  from  the  Army.
These debts appear on  the  October 2020 credit  report, but they do  not appear on  the
December 2021 or the May 2023 credit reports. (Tr. 66-72; Answer; GE 1-3)
Applicant’s financial issues were caused by inadequate income to cover his living
expenses,  especially  from  2014  until  2018  while  he  lived  in  Country  A  (where  he
claimed  cost  of  living  expenses  were  inordinately  high)  and  worked  for  a  government
contractor  there.  He  claimed  his  tuition  delinquencies  were  also  caused  by  a
misunderstanding  involving  the  availability  of GI  Bill benefits.  (Tr.  19-21, 47-49,  66-72;
Answer; GE 1, 2)
Applicant claimed that after he moved back to the United States in late 2018, his
financial situation has improved dramatically, especially after he began working for his
current employer in November 2019. Beginning in November 2019, he earned between
$103,000  and  $105,000,  annually.  At  the  time  of  the  hearing,  he  earned  $111,000,
annually.  He  receives  about  $1,300  per  month  in  disability  benefits  from  Veterans
Affairs (VA). He plans to apply for more, as he is not  currently being compensated for
injuries  he  suffered  while  in  the  Army  National  Guard.  He  claims  that  he  can  pay  his
financial  obligations  and  that  he  has  a  surplus  of  about  $2,300  at  the  end  of  each
month.  He  has  a  savings  account  with  about  $200  in  it,  but  claimed  it  normally  has  a
balance  between  $500  and  a  couple  of  thousand  dollars.  He  claimed  the  balance  is
lower  right  now  because  he  had  to  pay  unforeseen  veterinary  expenses.  He  has  a
retirement  account  through  his  current  employer  with  a  balance  of  about  $26,000.  He
also has a retirement account with one of his employers in Country A, but he does not
know  the  balance.  He  provided  a  written  budget  that  he  claims  he  follows.  He  also
claimed that he owns a wrecked car located in Country A that needs a new motor that
he can potentially sell to help pay his SOR debts. (Tr. 32, 37-40, 75-76, 84-86, 110-115;
Answer; AE A)
In  2019,  Applicant  attended  two  online  financial  counseling  courses.  For one of
these  courses,  he  watched  a  video  and  read  a  book  on  how  to  become  debt  free.  In
January 2023, he financed the purchase of a new sport utility vehicle (SUV) for $71,000.
He  traded  in  a  vehicle  he  purchased  in  2020  and  used  the  value  of  that  vehicle  as  a
down payment for the SUV. He pays approximately $1,150 per month on this vehicle. In
March 2023, he financed the purchase of a used compact car for $17,000. He traded in
another vehicle  that  he  purchased in  2020 and used the  value of that  vehicle  towards
the down payment of the compact car. He pays approximately $330 per month on this
vehicle. (Tr. 77-79; GE 5)
