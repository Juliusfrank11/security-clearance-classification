Applicant admitted all of the allegations in SOR except the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.l.
The admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the
pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  66  years old.  She  has  been  employed as  a machine operator  by  a
defense contractor since 1996. She has held a security clearance since 1996. She has
an associate degree, which she earned in 2013. She is single with one adult child. (Item
2)
The SOR alleges four defaulted student loans totaling $25,716 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b,
1.e, and 1.g); eight miscellaneous delinquent debts currently in collection totaling $9,927
(SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, 1.f, 1.h-1.l); and one judgment for $1,728 taken in July 2017 (SOR ¶
1.m). Applicant admitted owing  the student loans, but  states she thought the total was
less.  She  admitted  all  but  one  of  the  remaining  debts  and  stated  she  was  making
payments on four of them. She did not provide documentary support. The alleged debts
are listed on a July 2017 credit report, a December 2020 credit report, an October 2022
credit  report,  and  a  record  of  judgment.  (Items  1,  and  5-9)  Applicant  provided  no
documentary or testimonial support.
In her SCA, Applicant did  not report her defaulted student  loans, her debts that
were  in  collection,  or  the  judgment  taken  against  her.  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a
government investigator on March 11, 2021. She initially denied she had either defaulted
on any type of loan or was more than 120 days delinquent on any debt in the past seven
years.  When  confronted  with  her debts  by  the  investigator  she  admitted  most  of  them
were  hers.  Applicant  admitted  the  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b,  1.e,  and  1.g,  the
student loans, as well as the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.f, 1.h, 1.j -1.l. She disputed
the debts listed in SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.i. Applicant stated she was surprised how large the
student loans were. She stated she began to fall behind in her debts in 2018 when her
overtime hours were curtailed. Applicant noted she had worked out a payment agreement
with  her  mortgage  lender  as  she  had  fallen  behind  and  would  contact  the  creditors
discussed in the interview to attempt to work out a payment plan. (Item 4)
An October 2022 credit report shows Applicant had not made any payments on
her student loans, SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.e and 1.g. All were listed as having been placed for
collection,  though  are  likely  in  a  suspended  status  due  to  the  COVID  relief  from  the
Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) of March 27, 2020, and
subsequent Executive Orders. That status will end in October 2023. The debts listed in
SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, 1.f, 1.h - 1.l were also unchanged.
After I  re-opened  the  record, Department Counsel submitted  a  more  recent credit
bureau  report on  May 24, 2023.  The  May 2023  credit report reflects  only a  single  student
loan  in  the  amount  of  $16,316.  The  report states it  is “at  least  120  days or more  than  four
payments   past due”   and  notes  the  most  recent payment  was   made   in  July 2019.  This
student  loan  was  not  alleged  in  the  SOR.  The  student loans  alleged  in SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b,
1.e and  1.g  do  not  appear in the  May 2023  credit report. While  it is  likely in a  suspended
status due to the CARES Act, Applicant has presented  no evidence to demonstrate their
status.  The   debts   listed   in   SOR  ¶¶   1.f,   1.j   and   1.k   are  reported.   The   remaining   debts
alleged  in  SOR ¶¶  1.c,  1.d, 1.h, 1.i, and  1.l do  not appear in the  May 2023  credit report.
Though   I  did   not  consider  it  in   making   my  determination,   the   May  2023   credit  report
indicates  Applicant had an additional  debt that was charged  off.
Applicant stated in her answer to the SOR that she was making monthly payments
on  four  of  the  debts  in  the  SOR:  (a)  A  credit  card  account  for  an  account  placed  for
collection  in  the  approximate  amount  of  $2,339  (SOR  ¶  1.c);  (b)  A  credit  card  debt
charged off in the approximate amount of $1,224 (SOR ¶ 1.f); (c) A credit card debt for
an account placed for collection in the approximate amount of $677 (SOR ¶ 1.h); and (d)
A consumer loan debt for an account placed for collection in the approximate amount of
$226 (SOR ¶ 1.i). (Item 1)
Though Applicant did not provide any additional support, none of the four accounts
she stated she is making monthly payments on appear in either the October 2022 credit
report  or  the  May  2023  credit  report.  It  appears,  therefore,  that  Applicant  has  paid  or
settled these debts. (Items 6, 7, and 10)
The judgment in SOR ¶ 1.m taken by a creditor, was agreed to on February 18,
2018, and is supported by the record of judgment. (Items 8 and 9)
Applicant denied the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.l. regarding a $2,353 credit card on an
account that has been charged off. Applicant denied this in her answer to the SOR stating
she  has “a credit card with  [the same credit card company] now.” This argument is not
persuasive. (Item 1)
I have taken administrative notice that in March 2020, as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic,  the  President  directed  the  Department  of  Education  (DoEd)  to  provide  the
following  temporary  relief  on  DoEd-owned  federal  student  loans:  suspension  of  loan
payments, stopped collections on defaulted loans, and a 0% interest rate. On March 27,
2020,  the  CARES  Act  provided  for  the  above  relief  measures  through  September  30,
2020. See Federal Student Aid (FSA) website, ISCR Case No. 20-02787 at 3 n.1 (App.
Bd. Mar. 2022) This student loan debt relief was extended several times by subsequent
Executive  Orders.

Congress recently barred any further extensions and DoEd has announced that student
loan  repayments  will  resume  in  October  2023.  See  https://studentaid.gov/debt-relief-
announcement.
