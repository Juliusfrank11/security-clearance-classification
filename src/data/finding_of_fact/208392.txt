In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  she  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.k,  with
explanations  and  provided  supporting  documents.  She  also  admitted  SOR  ¶  1.l.  Her
admissions are included in the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the
pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 44 years old. She and her husband married in 1998. They have two
grown  children  in  their 20s  and  she  has  a  16-year-old  stepson.  They  all  live  at  home.
Applicant has some college credits. (GE 1)
Applicant served on active duty in the U.S. Army from 1997 until 2017. She held a
clearance in the Army. She retired as a sergeant first class (E-7). She was awarded the
Meritorious  Service  Medal,  five  Army  Commendation  Medals,  six  Army  Achievement
Medals, six Good Conduct Medals, and appropriate service medals. She served in Iraq
in 2004-2005. (PH 4)
Applicant was posted to State 1 from 2009 until she retired from the Army in 2017. Until
2015,  her  husband  was  also  there.  After  retiring,  she  began  working  for  defense
contractor P, on a military facility. She worked there as an analyst with an annual salary
of $79,000. That contract ended in August 2021. She then worked for defense contractor
Y, with a $55,000 annual salary, as an  executive administrative assistant. She worked
there until late 2021, when the withdrawal of her  interim clearance meant she was not
able to work. Applicant remains sponsored for a clearance but has not been employed
since October 2021. She is taking online courses to complete her college degree. The
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). is financing her education. ((GE 1; AE I; PH 1; Tr.
10-11, 14, 28-36, 63-67, 74-78)
On her SCA, Applicant declared that she had filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in
2016  and was then making monthly payments.  (GE 1)  Her debts occurred  because  in
2015, her husband was transferred to a new duty station in State 2, and it was difficult to
maintain the expenses of two households. She also was making less money in her new
job. (Answer; GE 2; Tr. 36-37, 55-56) She consulted a bankruptcy attorney and she said
she was advised to stop making payments on her bills so they would become 90 to 120
days  late  so  they  could  be  included  in  the  bankruptcy.  (GE  2)  She  was  paying  about
$3,800  a month  into  the  bankruptcy  plan.  This  included  her  full  retirement  check,  plus
other funds.  (Tr. 57) She  stopped  making  payments  into  the  2016 bankruptcy  in  2020
because she could not keep up with them. (Tr. 58)
Applicant’s husband moved home in 2021 after he retired from the Army with 24
years of service, also as an E-7. They remain legally married and they live in the same
house,  but  they  have  maintained  separate  lives  for  about  the  last  year.  They  divide
monthly expenses, though the mortgage is in her name. He receives $2,400 a month in
retirement pay. He works as a stocker for a large retailer and is also a personal trainer.
Applicant said the family’s finances have improved because they no longer need to pay
for  two  households,  though  the  loss  of  their  regular  Army  income  has  also  been  an
adjustment. (GE 2; Tr. 30-38, 60-61)
Applicant receives $1,750 in retirement pay. She is also a 100% disabled veteran,
and receives $3,950 in disability compensation from the VA. (Tr. 28-30, 33; PH 2, PH 3,
PH 4)
Applicant’s bankruptcies (SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b,  1.l) and  delinquent debts (SOR ¶  1.c-
1.k)  are  alleged   in  the   SOR.  She   admits  them   all.  They  are  also  listed   on   bankruptcy
documentation   (GE  6   –   GE   9)  and   credit  reports  from   May  2023,   October  2021,  and
October 2020. (GE 3  –  GE 5)
Applicant and her husband  first filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in November 2007.
They became financially overextended when they were just starting out in the Army and
starting a family. The bankruptcy petition was discharged in June 2012. (GE 6; Answer)
(SOR ¶ 1.b)
As  discussed  above,  Applicant  and  her  husband  jointly  filed  for  Chapter  13
bankruptcy in October 2016. (GE 3, GE 4, GE 7; AE A; Tr. 35) (SOR ¶ 1.a) The 2016
Chapter  13  bankruptcy  listed  about  $46,812  in  nonpriority  unsecured  claims.  Secured
claims included Applicant’s home and vehicles. They listed $9,955 in monthly income and
$5,669 in expenses. (GE 7 at 7-8)
Applicant explained in her Answer that her Army retirement pay went towards the
bankruptcy  balance,  but  she  was  unable  to  make  up  the  difference.  (Answer)  She
documented,  however,  that  between  October  2016  and  May  2021,  she  had  paid  over
$105,000 into the payment plan. (AE A) She said she paid about $3,000 a month into the
bankruptcy but stopped making payments because maintaining two households made it
too expensive. (Tr. 54-58) The petition was dismissed in April 2021. (GE 3)
Applicant  filed  for  individual  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  protection  again  in  October
2022. That bankruptcy proceeding is ongoing and will run for five years. (GE 3, GE 8, GE
9; AE G. Tr. 41) (SOR ¶ 1.l) She declared just under $20,000 in unsecured claims (not
including  secured  claims  such  as  home  and  vehicle).  She  declared  $5,333  in  monthly
income and about $3,900 in expenses. (GE 8 at 8)
Applicant said she is paying  regular monthly payments towards her bankruptcy,
through an automatic withdrawal. (Tr. 38-44, 65) She documented that from October 2022
to June 2023, she had paid $12,620 into the bankruptcy plan, and was paying $1,915 a
month. (PH 6)
The SOR debts total about $16,920, and are detailed as follows:
SOR ¶  1.c  ($7,719) is a debt that has been charged off. (GE 4) Applicant made
$350 monthly payments between August 2021 and August 2022. (AE B, AE C; PH 9) The
amount owed is now $5,495. It is listed in the current bankruptcy petition. (GE 8 at 26; AE
I; PH 9; Tr. 52-53, 68) It is being resolved.
SOR ¶  1.d  ($5,006) is an account that has been charged off. (GE 4) Applicant had
paid all but $554 on this debt, through the 2016 bankruptcy. (AE D, AE I) It is also listed
in the 2022 bankruptcy as a $5,006 debt owed to another creditor, C. (GE 8 at 25; Tr. 48-
51, 68-69) It is being resolved.
SOR ¶  1.e  ($1,007) is a charged-off account (#5131) with bank F. The balance is
actually $1,077. (GE 4) SOR ¶ 1.f ($681) is a charged-off account (#5121) with bank F.
(GE 4) Applicant had begun making payments on these debts. One debt to bank F, for
$535, is listed in the current bankruptcy proceeding. (GE 8 at 26; AE I; Tr. 69-70) These
debts are either resolved or being resolved.
SOR  ¶   1.g   ($534)  is  a  loan  account  that  has  been  charged  off.  The  loan  was
originally  for  $5,000.  Applicant  was  making  payments  in  2016  before  the  debt  was
charged off. (PH 11) The account is listed in the current bankruptcy. (GE 8 at 24; Tr. 47-
48, 70) It is being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.h ($436) is a credit account that has been charged off by a large retailer.
(GE 4) This account has been paid. (GE 3; AE E; PH 10; Tr. 70)
SOR ¶  1.i ($297)  is an account that has been charged off.  (GE 4) This account
was paid in October 2021. (AE I; PH 8, PH 12; Tr. 70-71)
SOR ¶  1.j ($644) is a credit account that has been charged off by a retailer. (GE
4). The debt is being resolved through the current bankruptcy. (GE 8 at 27; AE I; PH 5;
Tr. 71)
SOR ¶  1.k ($596) is a credit-card account that has been charged off. (GE 4, GE 5)
Applicant  asserted  in  a  post-hearing  statement  that  this  is  an  old  debt  that  is  her
husband’s responsibility. It is not listed in the current bankruptcy but is also not listed on
recent credit reports. (GE 3; AE I; Tr. 71)
The 2022 bankruptcy lists other delinquent accounts to be resolved through that
process. (GE 8; AE I) Among them is $769 in past-due federal income taxes for tax year
2021. (GE 8 at 25-27; Tr. 45-47, 52-53, 72-73) Applicant’s  2022 taxes have been filed
and she received small refunds. (Tr. 64)
Applicant has participated in credit counseling through the bankruptcies. She has
also learned financial counseling through her business management classes. (Tr. 58-59,
72-73;  PH  7)  She  has  a  monthly  budget  and  has  enough  money  to  keep  ahead  of
expenses.  (Tr.  61-68;  PH  1)  She  projected  a  monthly  income  of  $8,164  which  is
comprised of her retirement and disability of $5,701; a $938 education stipend from the
VA;  plus  her  husband’s  income  of  $1,524.  (PH  1)  She  projected  monthly  expenses  of
$7,537, including her $1,915 bankruptcy payment,  leaving a monthly balance of about
$630 (PH 1) All debts on  a  May 2023  CBR are listed  as “pays as agreed, “Included  in
Chapter 13,” or show a zero balance. (GE 3)
Applicant testified that she is fully dedicated to resolving her debts, which is why
she filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy. (Tr. 43) When asked to explain how she will be able
to control her finances in the future, given her three bankruptcy filings, Applicant said she
accepts responsibility for her debts, which is why her current filing is individual. She wants
to make a fresh start and keep things on track and she is “fully committed” to completing
her bankruptcy. (Tr. 77, 84-85)
A close friend who has known Applicant for many years provided a reference letter.
She attested that Applicant was a dedicated soldier, and she has been a good and trusted
friend and an excellent mentor. (AE H)
