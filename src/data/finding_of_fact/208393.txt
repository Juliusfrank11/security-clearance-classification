Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.c, and 1.e. He denied SOR ¶ 1.d.  His
admissions  are adopted  as  findings  of  fact.  After a thorough  and careful review of  the
pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 38 years old. He married in 2012 and divorced in 2021. He has a child
from the marriage and shares joint custody with his ex-wife. He served in the military from
2011 to 2016 and was honorably discharged. He has taken college courses but does not
have a degree. He has worked for a federal contractor since May 2020. (Tr. 21-26, 28,
80; GE 1)
In  December  2011,  Applicant  received  a  letter  of  intent  to  deny  eligibility  for  a
security clearance from the Department of the Navy Central Adjudication Facility (DON
CAF). An SOR was included that reported numerous delinquent debts supported by credit
reports. The SOR noted that Applicant was aware of most of the delinquent accounts and
was unable to pay them. The DON CAF issued a Final Denial of Eligibility  for Security
Clearance letter in June 2012. (GE 6)
Applicant  testified  that  he  resolved  his  outstanding  debts  while  serving  in  the
military. He said he has held a secret security clearance since approximately 2012. He
completed a security clearance application (SCA) in May 2021. In it, he disclosed he was
discharged from the military in August 2016 and started a part-time job the same month
and worked until June 2017. He then left this employment to accept a full-time position.
He disclosed he worked full time until February 2018 and left this position because his
mother was sick. He worked full time from February 2018 to April 2019 and disclosed he
left this position because he was “about to move after mother died.” He worked part time
from  April  2019  to  May  2020  before  being  hired  by  his  present  employer.  He  did  not
disclose any periods of unemployment on his SCA. (Tr. 11, 25, 29, 46; GE 1)
Applicant also disclosed in his SCA that as part of a background check to obtain a
security clearance in 2012 while serving in the Navy, he was investigated by the DOD.
He stated “I was in sub school. I was told I could be on hold to pay bills down or go to the
fleet.  I didn’t finish sub  school cause  I went to  the  fleet and  had  another rate  in  the  [N]avy.”
(GE 1).
Applicant testified that his father was sick and passed away in January 2017. He
testified he died on the day Applicant started his job. He stayed in the job for about four
months until April 2017.  His mother was hospitalized in 2017. In May 2017, he moved
back home to take care of her. She passed away in March 2018. Applicant testified that
when he moved home, he did not have a job. He said he chose to be unemployed for
nine  months  from  May  2017  to  March  2018.  These  dates  are  inconsistent  with  the
information he provided on his SCA. (Tr. 30-36; GE 1)
Applicant  attributed  his  financial  problems  to  his  period  of  unemployment  while
caring  for  his  mother.  At  the  time,  he  was  receiving  $400  to  $500  a  month  from  the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for disability. He said when his father died, his mother
received  survivor’s  benefits  and  Social  Security  payments.  His  father  did  not  have  life
insurance  and  they  had  no  savings.  He  also  attributed  his  financial  problems  to  his
divorce, but acknowledged he was responsible for the debts alleged. (Tr. 36-40)
Applicant testified that after his mother passed away, he started working in April
2018 as an apprentice aircraft mechanic at a military base. He left federal employment
when  he  was  hired  in  March  2020  by  his  present  employer  where  he  earns  more.
Applicant’s testimony of his employment dates is inconsistent with his SCA. (Tr. 40-44;
GE 1)
As  part  of  his  background  investigation,  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a
government  investigator  in  October  2021.  He  told  the  investigator  that  his  financial
struggles began when his father passed away in January 2017, and he felt responsible
to care for his mother and help her continue the lifestyle she had been accustomed to.
His  financial  struggles  worsened  when  his  mother  passed  away  in  early  2018.  He
inherited his parents’ house, where he was living, and assumed the financial responsibility
for the mortgage payments. In his answer to the SOR, he said since his parents passed
away “I’ve just been trying to maintain what’s back home. I gave my whole life up to come
back  home  to  try  [and]  buy  [the]  house  and  keep  the  land  looking  good  just  like  they
wanted.” He testified that after his parents passed away, his goal was to buy their house.
He continued to make the mortgage payments. He testified that his goal is to purchase
his parents’ house and maintain his credit and to do that he must take care of his debt.
(Tr. 51-54, 79; GE 2; Answer to SOR)
Applicant disclosed to the investigator that he had a credit-card account that he
used for daily necessities. He recalled to the investigator that the balance at some point
was over $10,000. He said he would contact the creditor to make payment arrangements.
When asked if he had more than one account with the creditor, he could not recall. He
was confronted with a second credit-card account, and he confirmed it belonged to him.
He said he used both credit cards to pay daily expenses, bills, and necessities. Applicant
said  when  his  father  passed  away,  the  mortgage  on  his  parents’  house  became
delinquent,  and  he  paid  the  $1,200 monthly mortgage.  There  were other maintenance
expenses  associated  with  the  house  that  he  paid.  The  two  credit  card-accounts  are
alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a ($18,660) and 1.b ($17,899).
Applicant testified  that he  began  accumulating  credit card debts  in about  2017.  He
said his wife  was using  the  cards,  but he  also  was  using  them. The  credit cards are in his
name  only. Applicant testified that he  made payment arrangements  for the debts alleged
in SOR ¶¶  1.a  and 1.b  with the creditor. He provided  a letter from the creditor dated May
31, 2023, stating  it confirmed  a  payment arrangement to  begin in June  2023  to  pay $25
a month  and it referenced the account in SOR ¶ 1.b. He provided  undated documents to
show he  made  payments presumably on  the  account in SOR ¶  1.b  (based  on  the  balance
owed) in the amounts as follows: $165, $150, $15, $120, $30, $90, and  $75. He testified
that he  had  a  previous  payment agreement from  May 2022  and  made  payments,  but he
did not keep  track of them. He  did not provide  a  copy of this agreement.  He  said he  was
making  payments “on  and  off.” He testified  that he  had  been  making  consistent payments
once  he  received  the  SOR. He said his agreement was to  make  two  monthly payments
on  each  account for a  total of four $25  payments a  month. He provided  a  document dated
June  10, 2023, from  the  creditor referencing  the  account in SOR ¶  1.a  and  its receipt  of
$25  with  a  remaining  balance  of  $18,430.  It  did not  reference  a  payment agreement  for
this  debt,  only  a   payment.  Post-hearing,  he   provided   a   document  to   show  the   current
balance  on  the  debt in SOR ¶  1.b  had  decreased  and  was now $17,614. (Tr. 46-52, 8185-
87, 89-95;  AE B, C, S, T, V, W)
Applicant was confronted with the collection account in SOR ¶ 1.c ($2,457). He
explained  to  the  investigator  that  this  charge  was  used  to  purchase  furniture  and  the
original balance was about $4,000. The account became delinquent in 2017 when he was
traveling to visit his father in the hospital and sometimes, he was only working three days
a week. He told the investigator he intended to satisfy the balance. (GE 2)
Applicant testified  that four years ago  he  contacted  the  creditor for the  debt in  SOR
¶  1.c and  contacted  them  again  a  year before  receiving  the  SOR  and  made  them  an  offer
to  settle the  debt.  After receiving  the  SOR,  he  contacted  the  collection  creditor but was
advised  that the  statute  of limitations had  run  on  the  collection  of the  debt.  He   said he
contacted  the  collection  company and  offered  to  make  payment arrangements or settle
the  debt.  He provided  a  copy of a  letter he  sent to  the  creditor. He  provided  copies of
three  checks each  for $15  paid to  the  creditor in June  and  July 2022.1  (Tr.  60-67; AE  G,
J)
Applicant was confronted by the investigator with the collection account alleged in
SOR ¶ 1.d ($233). He told the investigator this was a utility bill for his residence that he
overlooked paying when he moved home to be with his mother in 2018. He intended to
1  In Applicant’s exhibit list he labeled AE G as payments  to the  creditor in SOR ¶  1.a.  AE  G  includes  three
checks drafted from his credit union  that is also the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.a. The checks are made out to  the
collection  creditor in SOR ¶  1.c  not the  creditor in ¶  1.a. I have considered these  payments  in my  whole
person analysis.
pay it. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant provided proof that the collection account was
paid in January 2022. (Tr. 67-68; GE 2; Answer to the SOR; AE H)
Applicant was confronted by the investigator with the charged-off account in SOR
¶ 1.e ($2,249). He told the investigator that he had purchased a wedding ring for his wife.
He  said  the  original  balance  for  the  account  was  $5,000.  He  had  been  paying  on  the
account  but  when  his  parents  passed  his  priorities  shifted.  He  intended  to  satisfy  the
account. (GE 2)
Applicant testified  that he  has a  payment agreement  with  the  creditor for the  debt
in SOR ¶  1.e  to  pay $50  a  month  on  the  collection  account.  The  letter he  provided  states:
“This letter is to  confirm  your offer to  make  a  voluntary payment arrangement and  your
authorization  on  05/06/2022  of  recurring  transfers  from  your bank  account.” (emphasis
added)  He  provided   documents   that  show  on   May  10,   2022,   and   May  23,  2022,  his
automatic transfers were  $23.43  and  on  June  22, 2022, his transfer was for $23.19. It
appears  these   transfers  were   automatic.  He   did   not   provide   documents   to   show   he
continued  these  automatic transfers. He testified  he  stopped  the  payments because  he
was  paying   other  bills.  He  then   provided   documents  from   the   creditor  beginning   in
January  2023   that  do   not  reference   an   automatic  transfer  but  reference   a   voluntary
payment   of  $25   that   was  to   be   electronically  debited.  He   provided   proof   he   made   two
payments  of $25  in  January 2023,  and  then  one  monthly payment of $25  through  April
2023, and  two  payments of  $25  in  May and  two $25  payments  in June  2023. (Tr. 69-76,
97; AE  D,  E, F, Q, R)
Applicant told the investigator that he was able to make payments on his accounts
and  satisfy  his  debts.  He  intended  to  contact  the  creditors  and  make  payment
arrangements. At that time, he was not on a payment plan with any of his creditors. He
told  the  investigator  that  his  financial  stability  improved  when  his  VA  disability  was
approved for 100% in March 2021, and he was working full time for his present employer.
(GE 2)
Applicant  testified  that  he  earns  approximately  $46,000  annually  from  his
employment. His said his VA disability rating was increased in April 2022 to 100% and he
now receives $3,971 a month ($47,652 annually). He also testified his VA disability began
in January 2022. His testimony as to the date his VA disability increased differs from what
he told the investigator, that is March 2021. He provided a document from the VA, but it
does not show the date he began receiving the increased payment. (Tr. 44-46, 87-89; AE
P)
Applicant testified he does not have a budget. Post-hearing, Applicant provided a
personal  financial  statement  from  July  2023.  He  reports  he  has  $1,300  in  expendable
income after he pays his bills. He lists two credit cards that are current with a total balance
of approximately $18,000 that he makes monthly payments of $250 on each. He also lists
his mortgage of $1,220 a month. He does not list as part of his budget any payments for
the debts alleged in the SOR. (Tr. 108; AE Y)
Applicant testified that he took a loan of $1,200 from his Thrift Savings Plan to pay
for football camp for his son. He repays $80 a month. His 2002 car is paid for. He also
has a 2015 vehicle that his monthly payments are $200. In 2018 or 2019, he purchased
a used truck that cost about $9,000. In 2022, he gave the truck to his teenage son. He
estimated his monthly expenses for the truck are $180 for the loan, $400 for insurance,
and $280 for gas. He explained “I got him the truck because I couldn’t get him a new truck
like his friends got. So I was able to give him something, though, and things like that just
so  he  can  be  happy.”  He  pays $540 for child  support but  anticipates  this amount may
increase due to the new amount for his disability payments. He also expects his child to
go to college. He believes his military benefits will cover many of the expenses, but there
will likely be additional ones not covered. (Tr. 54-60, 82-85, 100-103)
Applicant was asked if he had filed his federal income tax returns on time and paid
if he owed taxes. He stated he had not filed on time in the past five years but did file late,
and he was sure he owed taxes. He stated his tax balance had increased. He made two
payments of $25 to the IRS, and he did not have a payment plan. He said he plans to pay
his tax debt and now that he has 100% VA disability he will be able to pay. Post-hearing,
Applicant provided a document presumably from the IRS website that shows Applicant’s
2022  tax  year  balance  is  $582;  2021  tax  year  balance  is  $1,820;  and  2020  tax  year
balance is $806. (Tr.109-115)
Applicant  provided  a  document  to  show  he  took  an  online  quiz  from  a  credit
organization that tested his current understanding of credit reports. It stated that when he
completed the end of the course, he should take the post-quiz and receive his Document
of Achievement. It is unclear whether the scores presented in the document are pre-quiz
or post-quiz. There were ten questions and Applicant answered eight correctly and the
time  taken  to  complete  it  was  two  minutes  and  eight  seconds.  A  Document  of
Achievement was not provided. (AE I)
Applicant provided character letters that describe  him as  responsible,  assertive,
independent, hard-working, kind, loyal, mature, reliable, valuable, professional, honest,
intelligent, disciplined, productive, and a team player. (AE K)
Any derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will not be considered
for  disqualifying  purposes  but  may  be  considered  in  the  application  of  mitigating
conditions, in a credibility determination, and in a whole-person analysis.
