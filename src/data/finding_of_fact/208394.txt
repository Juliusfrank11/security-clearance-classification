In Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, he admitted the three allegations, SOR ¶ 1.a,
that he used marijuana with varying frequency from about 2011 to about October 2021;
SOR ¶ 1.b, that he purchased marijuana from about June 2019 to about October 2021;
and SOR ¶ 1.c, that he intended to use marijuana in the future.
Applicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since 2017. He seeks to obtain a security clearance. He attended
community  college  for three  years but did not  earn  a degree. He  is  single and  has no
children. (GE 1 at 12, 14, and 21.)
Applicant has a history of marijuana use. In his  2021 Questionnaire for National
Security Positions (SF 86), he reported using marijuana about two to three times a year
socially between 2011 and 2019. (GE 1 at 65 and Tr. at 17-18 27, 28.) After joining his
employer he was assigned work that required international travel and he started to use
marijuana to help him sleep. (Tr. at 14, 17.) He stated on the SF 86 that he intended to
use marijuana in the future because it helped him sleep. (GE 1 at 65 and Tr. at 12-14.)
He testified he would switch to other legal means to help him sleep. (Tr. at 28-29.) He
testified if it “stops [him] from getting [his] security clearance, [he] would not continue to
smoke  marijuana.”  (Tr.  at  21.)  In  response  to  whether  he  would  sign  a  statement
concerning future use of marijuana, he offered he would sign a statement declining future
use. (Tr. at 31.)
Applicant  lived  in  a  state  where  marijuana  became  legal  under  state  law  about
midway  during  the  period  alleged.  (Tr.  at  27.)  He  stated  he  never  illegally  purchased
marijuana but understood it was an illegal controlled substance under Federal law. (Tr. at
16, 21.) He admitted using marijuana in a social setting one or two times after receiving
the SOR. His last use was about month before the hearing. He felt the security clearance
application process was “extremely slow” and the project he would have used a security
clearance for had been completed so he used marijuana. He acknowledged this was not
an excuse.  (Tr. at 18, 21, 23, 27.) He listed on his SF 86 as references, persons with
whom he used marijuana socially. (Tr. at 29.)
Applicant testified he had been told by work colleagues, who also used marijuana
and held DoD security clearances, that if he was truthful, he would not have a problem.
(Tr. at 30-31.) When asked to divulge the people smoking marijuana while holding a DoD
security clearance, he declined to answer the question. (Tr. at 32.) He added that since
he did not have a security clearance, he would not report them. (Tr. at 36.) Any derogatory
information  that  was  not  alleged  in  the  SOR  will  not  be  considered  for  disqualifying
purposes. However, it may be considered in the application of mitigating conditions, in
making a credibility determination, and in a whole-person analysis.
