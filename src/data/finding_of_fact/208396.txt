Applicant is 45 years old. He graduated from high school in June 1996. He enlisted
in the U.S. Navy in 1996 and was honorably discharged in 2015. He married in 2019 and
has  no  children.  After  separating  from  the  Navy,  Applicant  worked  for  a  government
contractor from September 2017 to December 2020. Since January 2021, he has been
employed by a different government contractor as a senior data link analyst. He has held
a DOD security clearance since 2011.
The  SOR  alleges  four  delinquent  accounts  totaling  $20,719.  In  his  Answer,
Applicant admitted all four of the delinquent accounts. He provided no further information
about  the  circumstances  that  triggered  these  delinquencies  nor  his  efforts  to  resolve
them. (Item 1)
During his November 19, 2021 background interview, Applicant discussed the four
delinquent  accounts  listed  in  the  SOR.  He  did  not  list  them  on  his  September  2021
security  clearance  application,  as  required,  due  to  oversight.  He  explained  that  these
accounts became delinquent for several reasons:  he had forgotten about paying them;
he had not received any statements; he was immature; he was unmotivated to pay; he
had used credit cards to pay for his wedding and honeymoon; financially he “was in over
his head”; he had other bills that took priority; and he had insufficient income to pay off
these  accounts.  He  told  the  investigator  that  he  recently  received  a  raise  at  work  and
planned to use the additional income to pay these four delinquent accounts. (Item 3)
The  DOD  CAF  sent  an  interrogatory  to  Applicant  in  June  2022.  He  was  asked
about the four delinquent accounts, which he claimed he was repaying, but he did not
attach  supporting  documentation.  He  also  provided  a  July  2022  personal  financial
statement  that  showed  his  monthly  net  income  as  $3,700.  After  paying  his  monthly
expenses, to include payments on the four delinquent accounts, he had a monthly  net
remainder of $1,000. He also provided a copy of his bi-weekly paystub. According to this
information, it appears his monthly net income should reflect $6,894. In this scenario, after
paying  his  monthly  expenses,  to  include  listed  payments  on  the  four  SOR  delinquent
debts, his monthly net remainder was over $4,500. (Item 4)
SOR  ¶   1.a   alleges  that  Applicant  is  indebted  to  a  federal  credit  union  in  the
approximate amounts of $14,337, for a charged-off account that became delinquent in
2019. In his July 2022 PFS, he listed that he was making monthly payments of $200 on
this  account,  however,  the  July  2023  credit  report  shows  that  this  account  had  not
received  payments  and  remains  unpaid  in  the  amount  of  $14,337.  Applicant  has  not
provided  sufficient  documentation  to  show  the  current  status  of  this  account  or  what
efforts, if any, he is making to pay this account. This debt remains unresolved. (Item 1,
Item 4, Item 5, Item 6, Item 7)
SOR  ¶   1.b   alleges  that  Applicant  is  indebted  to  a  federal  credit  union  in  the
approximate amount of $5,627, for a charged-off account that became delinquent in 2019.
In his July 2022 PFS, he listed that he was making monthly payments of $100 on this
account, however, the  December 2022  repayment  agreement  showed  that he had  not
made any payments on the account until December 2022. Since that time, Applicant has
made monthly payments in accordance with the repayment agreement through July 2023.
This debt is being resolved. (Item 1, Item 4, Item 5, Item 6, Item 7; AE A, AE C)
SOR  ¶   1.c   alleges  that  Applicant  is  indebted  to  a  federal  credit  union  in  the
approximate amount of $500, for a charged-off account that became delinquent in 2019.
In  his  July  2022  PFS,  he  listed  that  he  was  making  monthly  payments  of  $50  on  this
account, however, the December 2022  repayment  agreement  showed  that he had  not
made any payments on the account until December 2022. Since that time, Applicant has
made monthly payments in accordance with the repayment agreement through July 2023.
This debt is being resolved. (Item 1, Item 4, Item 5, Item 6, Item 7; AE B, AE D)
SOR  ¶   1.d  alleges  that  Applicant  is  indebted  to  a  collection  agency  in  the
approximate amount of $255 for an account referred for collection in 2018 by a bank. He
has not provided sufficient documentation to show the current status of this account or
what efforts, if any, he is making to pay this account. This debt remains unresolved. (Item
1, Item 4, Item 5, Item 6)
