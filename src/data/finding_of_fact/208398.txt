Applicant is a 40-year-old employee of a government contractor for whom he has
worked  since  July  2018.  He  has  been  continuously  employed  by  government
contractors since June 2011. He has been married since August 2017. He and his wife
have an 18-month-old child.  He earned a high school diploma. He has held a security
clearance since about 2006, without any security incidents. (Tr. 22-24, 30, 62; Answer;
GE 1, 6; AE A)
In  the  SOR,  the  Government  alleged  Applicant’s  failure  to  timely  file  his  2018
federal  income  tax  return  (SOR  ¶  1.a),  and  his  seven  delinquent  debts  totaling
approximately $117,000 (SOR ¶¶ 1.b through 1.h). The financial delinquencies consist
of the following: federal income taxes (SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c); credit cards (SOR ¶¶ 1.d,
1.e, 1.g, and 1.h); and a personal loan (SOR ¶ 1.f). He admitted the SOR allegations in
SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.d,  and  1.f  through  1.h,  with  additional  comments.  His  admissions  are
adopted as findings of fact. He denied the remainder of the SOR allegations because he
claimed  to  have  resolved  those  debts  prior  to  the  issuance  of  the  SOR.  However,  the
SOR  allegations  are  established  through  his  admissions,  the  Government’s  credit
reports, and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax records. (Answer; GE 1-6)
While  Applicant  failed  to  timely  file  his  federal  income  tax  return  for  tax  year
2018, he provided  sufficient evidence that this failure was largely the fault of his CPA,
with  whom  he  has  worked  since  2009.  His  CPA  attempted  to  timely  file  the  relevant
income tax return, but it was not accepted by the IRS. With the help of his CPA, he has
late  filed  this  income  tax  return.  The  evidence  shows  that  this  failure  to  timely  file  his
income tax return was a one-off and not a recurring problem with him or his CPA. While
a  failure  to pay  his  federal income  taxes  for tax  year 2018  is not alleged,  he provided
evidence that he paid those taxes. (Tr. 27-28, 32-33, 40-42; Answer; GE 1, 5, 6; AE D-
G)
In October 2017, Applicant entered a payment arrangement with the IRS to pay
his delinquent taxes for tax year 2016. He satisfied these taxes on October 17, 2022. In
December 2021, he entered a payment arrangement with the IRS to pay his delinquent
taxes for tax year 2020. The IRS acknowledged that he paid his delinquent taxes for tax
year 2020 on October 25, 2022. He refinanced the mortgage on his home and used the
equity to finish paying those taxes. He no longer owes any federal taxes and received a
refund for tax year 2022. He also used the equity from his refinance to pay off $50,000
in non-delinquent credit-card debt that was not listed in the SOR. (Tr. 42-45, 58, 74-76,
84; Answer; AE D, E, H, I)
In  about  March  2018,  Applicant  entered  into  an  agreement  with  a  debt
consolidation company  (DCC) to get a grip on his finances and to settle his consumer
debts.  He  enrolled  the  debts  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.d  through  1.h,  as  well  as  several  other
consumer  debts  not  listed  in  the  SOR.  He  was  current  on  all  these  accounts  prior  to
hiring  DCC  but  defaulted  on  them  pursuant  to  his  DCC  agreement.  Pursuant  to  their
agreement,  the  DCC  negotiates  settlement  agreements  with  enrolled  creditors.
Applicant  pays  a  monthly  fee  into  a  DCC  account  that  it  uses  to  make  payments  to
creditors  with  whom  it  has  made  a  settlement  agreement.  The  DCC  program  was
initially  scheduled  to  last  three  years,  but  because  the  COVID-19  pandemic  slowed
negotiations  with  creditors,  it  has  lasted  longer.  (Tr.  35-36,  39,  45-56,  76-80;  Answer;
GE 1-6; AE B, J, K)
Through   the   DCC  program,  Applicant  has  settled   the   debt   in  SOR  ¶   1.e   and   is
currently paying  the  debt in  SOR ¶  1.h.  DCC is still  negotiating  a  settlement  agreement
with  the  creditors of the  debts  in  SOR ¶¶  1.d, 1.f,  and  1.g, and  no  payments  have  been
made  on  these   accounts.   He   has   settled  four   accounts   that  are   not  listed   in the   SOR.
Overall, he  has paid  $87,000  towards  his total enrolled  debt  of $154,000.  He currently
pays about $1,460  per  month  into  the  DCC account, but that amount varies depending
upon   what  debts   are   being   paid   at  any  given   time.   Applicant’s   plan   is  to   continue   his
agreement with  DCC until all  the  enrolled  debts are paid. He  also  placed  his home  on
the  market  about  three   months prior to  the  hearing   with   the   hope   of  using   equity  from
the  sale to  pay about $30,000  to  DCC, at which point  they will be  required  to  settle his
remaining   enrolled   debts  with   no   further payment  from   him.   He   considers   his hiring   of
DCC to  represent financial counseling.  (Tr. 35-36, 39, 45-56, 68, 76-84; Answer; GE  1-
6; AE B,  J, K)
Applicant’s  financial  issues  began  in  about  2010  when  he  took  a  hiatus  from
working  in  Afghanistan,  came  back  to  the  United  States,  and  was  voluntarily
unemployed. During this time, he withdrew about $70,000 from a retirement account to
maintain the lifestyle he was living while he was employed. He did not withhold enough
money  for  the  taxes  he  incurred  from  these  withdrawals.  He  also  was  not  withholding
enough  money  from  his  wages  for  income  taxes,  resulting  in  owing  income  tax  at  the
end of several tax years. Judging from his receipt of an income tax refund in 2022, he
has fixed that issue. (Tr. 25-33, 58, 61-62; Answer; GE 1, 5, 6; AE A, E, J)
Applicant failed to realize that a creditor stopped his automatic payments on one
of  his  credit  cards  not  alleged  in  the  SOR  for  three  months  as  emergency  relief  for
Hurricane  Harvey  in  2017.  When  he  realized  he  had  not  made  payments  for  several
months, he could not afford to pay the balance and enrolled with DCC. He notified his
facility  security  officer  that  he  had  enrolled  with  DCC  and  listed  his  tax  and  other
delinquencies  in  his  December  2020  Electronic  Questionnaire  for  Investigations
Processing  (SF  86).  I  observed  Applicant  while  he  testified  and  found  him  to  be
credible. His willingness to report potentially derogatory information bolsters this finding.
(Tr. 25-34, 62; Answer; GE 1, 5, 6; AE E, J)
Applicant  earns  $138,000,  annually  in  wages.  His  current  monthly  earnings  are
nearly  subsumed  by  his  monthly  expenses.  His  current  mortgage  alone  is  $3,800  per
month.  He  has  about  $5,000  in  a  checking  account.  He  has  depleted  almost  all  his
retirement  savings  with  the  exception  of  about  $600.  He  is  hopeful  that  he  will  get  a
promotion at work that will increase his salary to $145,000,  annually. When he left his
job in Afghanistan in 2010, he was making over $200,000, annually. He plans to sell his
home for at least the $550,000 appraisal amount and use the equity to pay more of his
debts and increase his budget surplus. Once he sells his home, he can live rent free in
a home that his in-laws own. He plans to save the money he would spend on rent or a
mortgage while he lives in his in-law’s home. He has a contingent contract with a builder
to  purchase  a  home  and  land  for  $825,000.  The  contingencies  are  that  he  sells  his
current  home,  and  that  he  makes  at  least  $145,000  in  salary  in  about  a  year.  He  can
also unilaterally pull out of the contract. He and his wife have discussed the possibility of
canceling  the  contingency  contract  and  purchasing  a  less  expensive  home.  He  is
looking into hiring a certified  financial planner to help with his finances. He had one in
the  past  for  an  unspecified  time,  but  that  person  retired.  He  has  no  financial
delinquencies  other  than  those  referenced  herein,  however,  he  has  an  additional
$30,000  in  non-delinquent  credit-card  debt  that  is  not  listed  in  the  SOR  and  is  not
enrolled with DCC. (Tr. 38-40, 58-73, 82; GE 2, 6, 10)
