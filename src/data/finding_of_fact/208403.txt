In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all allegations in the SOR, with the
exception of allegations in SOR  ¶¶ 1.j and 1.k.  His admissions are incorporated in my
findings of fact.
Applicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from
high school in May 2001. He worked about three years prior to joining the U.S. Air Force
in March 2004. He married in June 2007. (Item 4)
Applicant held security clearances  while he was in the U.S. Air Force.  His most
recent SCA was completed in July 2014 while he was still serving in the active-duty U.S.
Air  Force.  As  a  result,  the  record  is  unclear  concerning  more  recent  background
information, including his current status and the character of his service upon discharge
from the active-duty U.S. Air Force. Two independent financial reports retrieved pursuant
to  the  DOD’s  continuous  evaluation  program  revealed  unreported  financial  issues  that
formed the basis of this SOR. (Items 4, 5, and 6)
The SOR alleges 12 delinquent debts totaling about $117,900. Applicant admitted
10  of  the  12  alleged  debts  totaling  about  $98,700.  He  did  not  provide  documentary
evidence to support his case, nor did he explain the circumstances that led to his financial
problems. (Items 2 and 3)
The evidence concerning debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below.
SOR  ¶¶  1.a   through  1.f:   Applicant admits the delinquent debts  in SOR ¶¶ 1.a.
through SOR 1.f. All six debts are listed as individual accounts that have been charged
off. (Item 6; see also Items 5 and 7) In this series of delinquent debts, the oldest debt,
located  at  SOR  ¶  1.a,  was  opened  in  December  2016  with  the  last  payment  made  in
August 2020. The newest delinquent debt, SOR ¶ 1.e, was opened in September 2021
with the last payment made in about 2022. (Item 6 at 3) All six debts are unresolved.
SOR ¶¶  1.g through  1.h: Applicant admits delinquent debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.g through
1.h, with comments. In SOR ¶ 1.g, he stated the amount of the debt “shouldn’t be  that
much,” but did not provide additional details or documents to show the current status of
the debt. (Item 3 at 2) The debt is listed in the credit bureau report as an individual account
that was charged off and closed by the creditor. (Item 7 at 14) His last payment on the
debt occurred in October 2020. (Item 7 at 14) This debt is unresolved.
In SOR ¶ 1.h, Applicant stated the amount charged “is not that much,” but did not
offer additional details or documents to show the current status of the debt. (Item 3 at 2)
Though this debt, an individual account,  appears in all three credit bureau reports, the
amount of the debt has decreased over time. (Items 5, 6 and 7) It decreased from $8,430
in 2021 (Item 5 at 5); to $6,917 in 2022 (Item 6 at 4); and finally, to $2,388 in 2023. (Item
7 at 11) Though the debt remains in a collection status,  it is clear Applicant has taken
progressive steps to pay off this debt over time though the actual terms of his agreement
with the creditor were not disclosed. (Item 7 at 11) This debt is being resolved.
SOR ¶  1.i:  Applicant admits this debt. He stated the amount charged “is not that
much,” but did not offer additional details or documents to show the current status of the
debt. (Item 3 at 2) This debt appears in two of the credit bureau reports with the amount
decreasing over time. (Items 6 and 7) It decreased from $1,730 in 2022 (Item 6 at 4), and
to its current collection amount of $971 in 2023. (Item 7 at 4) His regular child support
payment is $659 per month. His actual payment has been $689 per month since at least
January 2023 with the additional $30 amount going towards arrears. (Item 7 at 4) Though
the debt remains in a collection status, it is clear Applicant is paying off the arrearage over
time. This debt is being resolved.
SOR ¶¶  1.j through  1.k: Applicant denies the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.j through 1.k,
stating  he  does  not  recognize  the  listed  creditors.  SOR  ¶  1.j,  an  individual  account,
appears in two credit bureau reports and increases over time. (Items 6 and 7) He opened
this  account  with  the  creditor  in  June  2021,  and  by  June  2022,  the  account  was  in  a
collection  status.  (Item  6  at  7)  In  2023,  the  creditor  assigned  the  account  to  a  debt
collector to continue collection efforts. The collection balance increased from $10,884 to
$11,066,  and  the  account  remains  in  a  collection  status.  (Item  7  at  8)  This  debt  is
unresolved.
SOR ¶ 1.k is also an individual account that appears in two credit bureau reports.
(Items 5 and 6) Applicant opened the account in August 2018. (Item 5 at 3) This debt was
charged off by the original creditor in about April 2021, and acquired in May 2021 by a
substitute creditor. The substitute creditor returned the account to a collection status and
kept the account balance the same. (Item 6 at 7) This debt is unresolved.
SOR ¶  1.j: Applicant admits this debt, an individual account that appears in two
credit  bureau  reports.  (Items 6  and  7)  He  opened  this account  in March  2021,  and  by
June  2022,  the  account  was  in  a  collection  status.  (Items  6  at  7)  The  first  major
delinquency  was  reported  in  June  2021.  The  creditor  assigned  the  account  to  a  debt
collector to continue collection efforts. The collection balance remained the same. (Item
7 at 8) This debt is unresolved.
