In  Applicant’s  answer to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  the allegation  in  SOR  ¶  1.a and
denied the allegation in SOR 1.b. His admission is incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He married in August
1996 and has four children, ages 15, 16, 23, and 24. He served on active duty in the U.S.
Army  from  September  1990  until  he  retired  on  a  date  not  reflected  in  the  record.  He
received a security clearance around 1994. (FORM Item 1 at 34) He submitted a security
clearance application in April 2013, and his clearance was revalidated in July 2014. His
clearance was apparently carried over when he began working for a defense contractor
on a date not reflected in the record.
In   April  2021,  the   DOD  Continuous  Vetting   Program   discovered   the   two   debts
alleged in the  SOR  and reflected in a credit report from  April 2021. (Form Item  6)   SOR ¶
1.a  alleges a home mortgage  loan  that is past  due  for $82,044, with a  total loan balance
of $261,516. The  last  payment on  the  debt was in November 2020. (FORM  Items  4 and
6)   Applicant   purchased   the   home   in   April  2005.   When   he   was   reassigned   to   another
location, he  was unable  to  sell  the  house  because  of market  conditions, and  he  decided
to  rent it. In August 2017, a broken  water pipe  on  the  second  floor of the house  severely
damaged  the house and made  it  unhabitable. As  a  result, his tenants moved  out  and  his
rental income  stopped,  making  it impossible  for him  to  make  the  payments on  the  rental
property as well  as his current residence. Using  $25,000  from  his insurance  company, he
hired  a  contractor to  repair  the  home, but the contractor did not finish  the  job. Applicant
obtained  a  second  mortgage  loan  to  hire  a  new  contractor,  who  completed  the  repairs.
He remained  in contact with  the   primary mortgage  lender, who  advised  him  to  sell  the
property. He  attached  a  sales contract  to  his answer to  the  SOR, signed  by the  parties on
April 27,  2022,  reflecting  an  agreement to  buy the  home  for $279,900, which  is more  than
sufficient   to   pay  the   debt.  (FORM   Item   2   at   3)  However,  the   record  does   not  contain
evidence of a  final sale and resolution  of the  debt.
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges a cellphone account charged off for $529. Applicant contracted
for  cellphone  service  while  he  was  stationed  overseas.  In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  he
denied  the  debt  on  the  ground  that  the  sales  agent  told  him  he  could  terminate  the
contract  if  he  was  reassigned  back  to  the  United  States.  He  did  not  provide  any
documentation  of  a  contract  with  a  provision  for termination  due  to  military orders. He
claimed  that  he  disputed  this  debt,  but  he  provided  no  documentation  of  the  dispute.
However, he provided documentation that he paid the debt in full on May 4, 2022. (FORM
Item 2 at 2)
The  credit  report  from  March  2022  reflects  27  accounts.  All  the  accounts  are
current except for the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a.
