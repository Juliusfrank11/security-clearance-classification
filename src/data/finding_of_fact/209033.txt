Applicant is a 60-year-old employee of a defense contractor, employed since 2002.
She earned a bachelor’s degree in 2012 and a master’s degree in 2013. She is divorced
and has four adult children. This is her first time applying for a security clearance.
The   SOR  alleges  under  Guideline   F,   that  Applicant   failed   to   file   her  federal  tax
returns and  is indebted  to  the  Federal Government for delinquent taxes for tax years 2014
-  2017   (SOR  ¶¶   1.a-1.h:  Item   1   at   34-36;   Item   6);  and   that  she   failed   to   file   her  state
income  tax returns for tax years 2014  –  2017  (Item  1  at 34-36). The  SOR also alleges five
additional delinquent debts totaling  approximately $15,764.00  (SOR  ¶¶  1.j-1.n).  Applicant
admits  the  federal and  state  tax allegations,  she  admits SOR ¶¶  1.l  and  1.n,  and  denies
SOR ¶¶  1.j, 1.k, and  1.m.  The  record  evidence  is sufficient to  support the  SOR allegations.
In  her  response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  indicates  she  filed  all  of  her  federal  tax
returns and that she is working with a tax firm/association to help her settle the tax debt
that  is  owed  to  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS).  They  hope  to  arrange  a  monthly
payment plan on her behalf that she can afford. They are also working on her state tax
issues. She disputes the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.j, 1.k and 1.m because she does not
recognize the debts. The $72 medical debt alleged in ¶ 1.n is for a flu shot. Applicant was
under the impression she could receive the flu shot for free. She paid the bill and she now
gets her flu shots from a local pharmacy which provides flu shots at no charge. (Answer
to the SOR)
The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.l is a mortgage account that is past due in the amount
of $7,083, with a total balance of $158,617. Applicant admits that is for her home.  Her
home has serious issues that need to be repaired related to a leaking roof. She needs to
refinance her mortgage to pay for the repairs. She claims the previous owner made some
quick fixes in order to pass the home inspection. (Answer to SOR)
In February 2022, Applicant encountered severe health issues. She was off work
for  six  months.  She  appreciates  the  opportunity  to  explain  her  situation.  She  also  is
seeking budget counseling from a nonprofit organization in order to help her with a debt
management plan. She would have sought counseling earlier, but her health issues put
a hold on everything.  Applicant states she is a good worker and has never sold out her
country. She would like to get her budget and tax issues in order. (Answer to SOR)

(Item 8 at 2; Item 9 at 2; Answer to SOR)
SOR ¶  1.k: $92 medical debt placed for collection: Applicant denies this debt. I find
for  Applicant  regarding  this  debt  because  the  pleading  is  too  vague  for  Applicant  to
determine the identity of the creditor. The amount of the debt is de minimis. (Item 8 at 2;
Answer to SOR)

because  she  does  not  recognize  it.  At  the  close  of  the  record,  the  debt  remained
unresolved. (Item 9 at 2; Item 10 at 11; Answer to SOR)
SOR ¶ 1.n: $72 medical account: In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant states that
this was for a flu shot received at her doctor’s office. She mistakenly thought it was free.
She claims she paid this debt. She did not provide a receipt showing that she paid it. The
debt does not appear on her most  recent credit  report. I find SOR ¶ 1.n for Applicant.
