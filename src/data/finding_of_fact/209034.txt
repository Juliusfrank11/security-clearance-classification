In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted all SOR allegations. He also provided
mitigating information. (Id.) His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.
Applicant is a 39-year-old investigator who has worked for his current employer
since September 2018. (Tr. 6, 11-12) In 2002, he graduated from high school (Tr. 7) He
served in the Air Force from August 7, 2007, to January 18, 2013. (Tr. 7) He was a senior
airman (E-4) when he received an honorable discharge from the Air Force. (Tr. 7-8) His
Air  Force  specialty  was  special  duty  assigned  to  the  honor  guard.  (Tr.  8)  He  was
discharged because he was injured and unable to run. (Tr. 9) His Department of Veterans
Affairs (VA) disability rating was increased from 40 percent to 60 percent in August or
September 2022. (Tr. 60)  He receives $1,600 monthly from the VA. (Tr. 55) His gross
income is about $69,000, which is near the national average. (Tr. 56)
In  2006, Applicant married. (Tr. 10) He  believes he  was divorced  in  2023; however,
he  is unsure whether his divorce  is final because  his spouse  filed  for divorce  online. (Tr.
10) His 16-year-old daughter and his 19-year-old stepdaughter  live  with  him. (Tr. 11, 38)
Financial Considerations
Applicant said his delinquent debts resulted from his spouse’s temporary disability,
which resulted in a reduction in her pay by 50 percent, which was followed by the loss of
her employment  in  late  2017  or early  2018. (Tr.  32;  SOR  response)  Applicant  and  his
spouse fell behind on some debts while she was on partial disability. (Tr. 32-33) She was
unemployed for a few months, and then she found employment at about 25 percent less
than her previous pay. (Id.) She sued her former employer and in September 2018, she
received  an  $18,000  settlement,  which  she  used  to  resolve  some  of  her  debts  and  to
purchase a vehicle. (Tr. 34) In 2018, Applicant was being paid $18 an hour. (Tr. 37)
Applicant received financial counseling as part of the bankruptcy process. He also
took some financial classes. (Tr. 55)
The SOR alleges the following financial concerns:
SOR ¶  1.a  alleges a bank filed a judgment in September 2021 against Applicant
for about $14,819. The debt resulted from a car loan which Applicant’s spouse obtained
to purchase a new vehicle in 2017. (Tr. 32; SOR response) The monthly payment was
$400. (Tr. 32) The judgment amount after costs and fees totals about $18,000. (AE A)
SOR ¶  1.b  alleges Applicant has a charged-off debt for about $10,518. The debt
resulted from a car loan which Applicant obtained in 2017 to purchase a new sports car.
(Tr.  30-31,  53-54;  SOR  response)  The  monthly  payment  was  $780.  (Tr.  31)  He
characterized the purchase of the sports car as a “stupid” decision; however, he learned
from it and purchased an inexpensive used vehicle as a replacement after the sports car
was repossessed. (Tr. 53)
SOR ¶  1.c  alleges Applicant has a charged-off debt for about $10,413. He obtained
a  $10,000  personal  loan.  (Tr.  39)  He  paid  about  $4,000  in  interest;  however,  in  the
summer of 2018, he stopped making payments. (Tr. 40)
SOR ¶  1.d  alleges a judgment originating from a bank was filed against Applicant
in February 2020 for about $1,186. He used the funds from the bank loan for daily living
expenses. (Tr. 41) Applicant said after the creditor obtained the judgment, he was pretty
sure  he  made  some  payments.  (Tr.  41-44)  However,  he  did  not  provide  documentary
evidence showing any payments.
SOR ¶¶  1.e  and  1.f  allege Applicant has two charged-off debts owed to the same
bank for about $899 and $650. He did not make any payments to address these debts.
(Tr. 45)
SOR  ¶   1.g  alleges  Applicant  has  a  charged-off  store  debt  for  $475.  He  did  not
make any payments to address this debt. (Tr. 45)
SOR ¶  1.h  alleges Applicant filed  for Chapter 7  bankruptcy  in March 2016, and  his
nonpriority  unsecured   debts  were   discharged   in  about  June   2016.   Applicant  was
unemployed  from  July 2015  to  January 2016,  and his spouse  was  not employed outside
their  home. (Tr. 23-24)  They moved  to  a  different state, which  enabled  his spouse  to  find
employment   in  December  2015.  (Tr.  23-24)   His  spouse’s  annual  pay  at  her  new
employment  in  January 2016  was about  $30,000.  (Tr. 25) When  he  went to  a  bankruptcy
attorney, his attorney told him to stop  paying  his creditors. (Tr. 29) The debts discharged
through  this  bankruptcy totaled  about $93,000, and  it consisted  mostly of car loans for
repossessed  vehicles (unrelated  to  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b) and  credit  card debts. (Tr. 25-
26)
SOR ¶  1.i alleges Applicant’s wages were garnished  by a  state  tax authority for
about  $5,585.  Applicant’s  spouse  prepared  their  tax  returns.  (Tr.  28)  When  Applicant
moved to a new state, he was surprised when he received a bill for a car tax. (Tr. 27) He
believed his spouse may have paid a car tax bill instead of a state income tax bill. (Tr. 27)
He said the state tax debt will be paid. (Tr. 57) In his Office of Personnel Management
(OPM) interview, he said his state income tax debt was for TYs 2016, 2017, and 2018.
(GE 2 at 2) The original balance was $8,000 to $10,000. (Id.) He owes a state tax authority
about $200 for TY 2022. (Tr. 56) On July 27, 2023, he made a $50 payment to the state
tax authority. (AE B) After his hearing, he said he paid his state tax debt. (AE B; AE C)
After  Applicant  separated  from  his  spouse,  he  saved  about  $2,000,  and  he
intended to pay some of his SOR creditors; however, his spouse lost her employment,
and he decided to help her financially instead of paying his creditors. (Tr. 45) Once she
obtained employment, he believed she would pay him back. (Tr. 46)
Applicant’s  current  pay  is  $25  an  hour.  (Tr.  46)  He  said  a  creditor  has  been
garnishing $500 monthly from his pay since November 2022; however, Applicant said he
does not know which creditor is garnishing his pay. (Tr. 46-47)
After his spouse received her settlement of about $18,000 in tax year (TY) 2018,
they owed additional federal income taxes. (Tr. 47) He contacted the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS) and established a payment plan in which he paid $500 monthly for about
one year. (Tr. 50) When he filed his federal income tax return for TY 2022, he owed the
IRS about $2,000 for that tax year. (Tr. 47) He currently owes the IRS a total of about
$12,000  to  $15,000.  (Tr.  48)  The  IRS  has  transferred  any  refunds  to  address  his
delinquent tax debt. (Tr. 51)
In  Applicant’s  January  29,  2020  SCA,  he  said  he  owed  an  estimated  $3,700  in
state income taxes; the status was “current”; and the debt “will be paid off by the end of
the  year.”  (GE  1  at  49)  He  said,  “I  have  payment  arrangement  for  my  federal  taxes
because I could not afford to pay in full. I thought the arrangement included state taxes
but it did not. . . . [He] agreed to a $200 garnishment [from] every paycheck.” (Id.)
I requested Applicant provide copies of his federal income tax transcripts for the
previous five years and proof that his state income tax returns were paid. (Tr. 57-58) I
also asked for proof of any payments to any other SOR creditors. (Tr. 59) The only proof
of payment provided after his hearing was documentation showing a $50 payment to the
state tax authority, and no tax returns or tax transcripts were provided. (AE B)
In his closing written statement Applicant said:
. .  . I feel that most  people in  my position  would  probably file  for bankruptcy,
but I do  not want to  take  that route  again.  I know it takes longer to  come
back from, but I would  rather save  and  pay back my debts than  take  the
easy route.  Currently  the garnishment that  is being  taken from my check is
paying  off  [the  debt in SOR ¶  1.a]  at  a  rate  of  $1000  a  month  to  a  balance
of $13517.28  based  off  an  email  that  was sent  to  my work  email  11/22. I  am
unable to  send  any email  with  an  attachment to  an  outside  email  account.
$8000  has  been  paid toward  the  debt  and  will be  paid  off  in  the  next  about
five  and  a  half months.  Once  this account  is paid  off, I  will  continue  to  use
the  $1000  that has been  taken  out to  continue  to  pay off  all  my debt.  My
[state]  taxes have  been  paid,  attached  is the  final amount that was sent to
collections   and  paid.   [AE   B]  This   is the  first opportunity   that I  have   really
had  to  pay off  my  debts since  divorcing  my wife. Even  though  many  of  the
accounts were  joint,  I have  been  the one  affected, my wife  has never been
garnished  or paid  towards any of our joint  debt.  As I  have  mentioned  my
clearance  affects  my  job  and  my  potential future. I  plan  on  going  back to
school  to   finish  my  degree   in  cyber  security  and   having   a   clearance   is
paramount to my  degree. I am  trying  to  better my situation and make more
money so  that I can  pay off  my debts.  I have  no  other negative  infraction
against me  other than  my  debts.  I have  had  some  bad  luck as far  as my
wife  losing  her job  and  relying  on  one  income, I will  admit  that I  overreached
in my [vehicle]  purchase  [related  to  SOR ¶  1.b]. I have  learned  from  that
mistake  as  I  mentioned  and  now have  a  much  more  affordable  car payment
that will  be  paid off  within the  next year. I pay my bills on  time  and  live  within
my  means.   It   was   my   mistake   to   let  my  ex-wife   control our  finances  as   I
have  much  better  control over  it. If  I am  given  the  opportunity to  hold my
clearance   by  the   time   my  next   investigation   is  due[,]   I  will   be   completely
debt  free. I have  learned  from  the  past  and  will  continue  to  strive to  better
[my own]  and  my kid’s situation. . . . [AE  C]
