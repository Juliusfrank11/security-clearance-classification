Applicant admitted all allegations. His admissions are incorporated in my findings
of fact.
Applicant is 32 years old. He served honorably in the U.S. Marine Corps from April
2011 to June 2015. He has been married twice. He divorced his first spouse in July 2020
after seven years of marriage and married his current spouse in February 2021, but they
are currently separated. (Item 2 at 21-22, 32.) He has no children from his first marriage
and from his current marriage he has two minor-aged stepchildren and a child born of the
marriage in August 2021. (Tr. at 33.)
Applicant has been employed by his sponsor since October 2019 and received a
promotion in April 2021. His initial annual salary was $66,000 and after his promotion it
was $77,000. Prior to joining his employer his annual salary was $44,000. (Tr. at 28-29.)
His first spouse had limited part-time jobs, so he was providing for them on his $44,000
salary.  (Tr.  at  30.)  He  initially  received  a  low  disability  rating  from  the  Department  of
Veterans Affairs (VA), but in late 2020 he was reevaluated, which resulted in higher rating
that increased his monthly disability payments by over $1,600. The increase occurred at
about the time he married his second spouse. (Tr. at 32.)
The  SOR  alleges  six  delinquent  debts  totaling  $38,962,  reflected  in  two  credit
reports from July 2021 (GE 3) and February 2022 (GE 4). Applicant offered a May 2023
credit report that no longer showed the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c, and 1.f. (AE B.)
He testified he had taken the initiative to call his primary creditor and had gone over his
credit report to look at the debts he and his wife had. He stated he called the financial
institution that held four of the debts, SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c, and 1.f, to see what his repayment
options were for the accounts. He explained he would pay what he could and noted he
had paid some debts in full. He offered he would make a budget to address the debts he
could not afford to pay. (Tr. at 40; AE C.) He took out a hardship loan from his 401(k)
retirement account in 2023. At the time of the loan, his 401(k) account held  approximately
$21,000. He withdrew $13,000 to pay medical debts and credit debts. The medical debts
arose from the 2022 birth of his child. (Tr. at 41-43.)
Guideline F
SOR  ¶¶   1.a-1.c,  1.f:   four   accounts   charged  off  in  the   amounts   of   $18,552;
10,739;   $6,493;   and  $1,005,  respectively.  Applicant  admits  the  respective  debts  with
the credit institution. He has not established payment plans for these accounts. The last
payments were in the 2016-2017 period. He and his former spouse were “living beyond
[their] means” and he could not make the payments because of his salary at the time. He
was  aware  of  the  debts  but  had  been  trying  to  resolve  his  smaller  debts  first.  He
acknowledged SOR ¶ 1.f was simply missed. He notes they have all fallen off his credit
report. (Tr. 22-23, 25; AE B.)
SOR ¶¶  1.d-1.e:  student  loans  placed for  collection  in the  amounts  of  $1,137
and  $1,036.   Applicant  admits  the  debts.  He  stated  the  loans  had  been  frozen  by  the
Department of Education (DoEd) during COVID and they were not requesting payment.
He enrolled in the Fresh Start Transfer Program seven days prior to the hearing and was
notified the day before the hearing that a determination was forthcoming. He stated if the
loans  were  not  approved  for  the  Fresh  Start  Transfer  Program  the  two  loans  will  be
renewed with a new lender. He stated he will abide by whatever the repayment plan is
established to pay off the loans. (Tr. at 24; AE-A.)
I have  taken  administrative  notice  that in March  2020, as a  result of the  COVID-19
pandemic, the  President directed  the  DoEd  to  provide  the  following  temporary relief on
DoEd-owned  federal student loans: suspension  of loan  payments,  stopped  collections on
defaulted loans, and a  0% interest rate. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief,
and  Economic Security Act (CARES  Act) provided  for the  above  relief measures through
September 30, 2020. See Federal Student Aid (FSA) website, ISCR Case No. 20-02787
at 3  n.1  (App. Bd. Mar. 2022) This student loan  debt relief was extended  several times by
subsequent Executive  Orders. See  https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-
19.  Congress  recently   barred   any  further  extensions  and   DoEd   has  announced   that
student loan  repayments will  resume  in October 2023. See  https://studentaid.gov/debt-
relief-announcement.
Guideline  D
SOR ¶  2.a: This allegation alleges that Applicant was arrested on October 5, 2022,
and  charged  with  Aggravated  Sexual  Battery;  and  that  the  felony  charge  remained
pending. In answering SOR ¶ 2.a in the Amendment to the SOR, he admitted the SOR
allegation and noted that the case remained pending and cited a court date of May 22,
2023,  (Answer  to  SOR  ¶  2.a.)  His  middle  school  aged  stepdaughter  accused  him  of
“inappropriate touching  of her  behind…  and  that  [he]  requested  to  touch  her  privates.”
(Tr.  at  64.)  His  stepdaughter  disclosed  to  police  that  when  she  was  approximately  10
years old, he had sat next to her on a couch in their living room, where she reported, he
had started touching her "here" while motioning to her vaginal area for the detective. She
told the detective he asked her if he could, over her clothing, feel it, to which she said no.
(GE 6; GE 7 at 15-16.)
Applicant acknowledged in his police interview he had touched his stepdaughter's
vagina but stated that he had explained to the detective he had “unintentionally touched
her  vagina.”  (Tr.  at  66;  GE  6;  GE  7  at  16.)  He  declined  to  say  if  his  stepdaughter’s
allegations were false because he has no recollection of the incidents. He did not “believe
she would lie about something that happened.” (Tr. at 67.) He explained that he is not
denying the allegations by his stepdaughter and cites his sleep disorders for his lack of
memory  for  why  he  cannot  recall  any  incidents.  (Tr.  at  69,  77-78,  81,  83.)  During  his
DOHA  hearing,  he  testified  that  he  only remembers  “it  from  a  nightmare  because  [he]
kept reliving the allegation over and over. But what [he] remember[s] is, we were sitting
on the couch watching cartoons. I had my arm back around her and my hand on her leg.
Like on the side. And I adjusted, because I was uncomfortable, and I accident[ly] touched
her vagina.” (Tr. at 68.) He stated essentially the same in his police interview. (GE 7 at
15-16.)
Applicant  has  been  under  the  care  of  a  licensed  professional  counselor  since
January of 2023. He sought treatment voluntarily. He began reaching out to the counselor
in August of 2022 after a referral from the VA. On his own initiative he walked into the
office  after  being  unsuccessful  making  phone  contact.  His  counselor  indicated  he  had
been “very proactive in seeking out treatment.” (AE F.) He is described as compliant and
working hard in the therapy process and has to date done nothing to violate the terms of
his bond. He remains in the community because he is compliant and does not present
himself as a risk to the community. His counselor notes, without drawing any conclusions,
that Applicant is working hard in therapy to understand and work through his own history
of childhood sexual abuse which he encountered at a very young age. (AE F.)
As  of  June  8,  2023,  when  the  record  closed,  Applicant’s  criminal  trial  remained
pending. (GE 7)
Applicant  offered  the  testimony  of  a  work  colleague  and  former  Marine.  The
witness was very credible. He detailed his familiarity of some of the things Applicant had
overcome and events in the Applicant’s life that had set him back. The witness understood
the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct  and circumstances surrounding the
conduct of Applicant. He allowed Applicant to stay with him and his family after Applicant
had been removed from his home. He identified the presence of rehabilitative potential in
Applicant based on how accountable Applicant had been with all that had happened. (Tr.
98, 102-103.)
