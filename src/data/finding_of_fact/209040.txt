Applicant  accepts  responsibility  for  his  financial  issues.  He  borrowed  from  his

were not alleged in the SOR, but he has not paid any of the debts alleged in the SOR.
He testified that he would pay his debts if the creditors would work with him. He has not
received financial counseling. He asserted that he loves his job, and his finances would
not  cause  him  to  do  anything  to  harm  this  country.  (Tr.  at  15-17,  20-23;  GE  2-5)  He

I received in the mail today a garnishment notice from my employer for the
[SOR  ¶  1.a  - $5,454]  loan  which  will  start  being  garnished  from  my  pay
check starting this upcoming payday 8/16/2023. This will help resolve that
portion  of  collection  on  my  credit  report  and  put  me  in  a  better  position
credit wise. (AE A)
