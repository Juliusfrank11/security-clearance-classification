Applicant admitted to the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.c.~1.e., and SOR ¶¶ 2.a.~2.e.
He denied SOR allegations ¶¶ 1.a. and 1.b. After a thorough and careful review of the
pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 63-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has a Bachelor
of  Science  degree.  Applicant  has  been  employed  with  the  defense  contractor  since
January of 2016. He is divorced, and has no children.  (TR at page 7 lines 10~24, and
at page 15 line 1 to page 16 line 9, and GX 1 at pages 7, 13~14, 15, 25~26 and 27~28.)
Guideline E - Personal Conduct
1.a.   Applicant  denies  that  he   falsified   his  June   2020   SCA  when   he  answered
“No”  to  “Section  23  –  Illegal Use  of Drugs or Drug  Activity  .  . . in  the  last  seven  (7)  years
[June   of  2013   to   June   of  2000].”   In   his  Answer,  Applicant  avers  it  “was  an   accidental
omission.”  (Answer at page  7.)  This explanation  is not  credible. During  the  period  June
2013   until  his   last   usage   in  June   of  2019,  Applicant  used   marijuana,   hundreds  if   not
thousands  of times.  (TR  at page  18  line  16  to  page  19  line  15, at page  21  lines 6~10, at
page  64  line  10  to  page  66  line  2,  and  GX  1  at pages 41~42.)   I find  this  to  be  a  willful
falsification.
1.b.  Applicant  denies  that  he   falsified   his  June   2020   SCA  when   he  answered
“No”   to   “Section   13A   –   Employment  Activities,  1.  .  .   .   For  this  employment,  in  the   last
seven   (7)  years   have   you   received   a   written   warning   .   .  .”     Again,   in   his  Answer,
Applicant avers it “was  an  accidental omission.”  (Answer at page  7.)  This explanation  is
not credible.  In  about 2016, Applicant  received  a  written  warning  from  his employer for
charging  more than  $4,000  on  his company  credit card  for personal purchases.  (TR at
page  21 line  11 to  page 23 line 25, at page 54 line 16 to page 55 line 11,  at page 56 line
15 to page  57 line 18, and  GX 1 at pages 15~16.) I find this to  be  a  willful  falsification.
1.c.  and  1.d.  These  allegations relate  to  the  same  incident.  Applicant admits  that
in about February of 1981  he  was  charged  with  Suspicion  of Burglary. (TR  at page  24
line   1   to   page  25   line  15.)   I  find   that  this event  that  occurred   more  than   40   years ago
does not have  present  security significance  under Personal Conduct.
1.e. Applicant admits  that in about February of 1995  he  was charged  with  illegal
Possession   of   a   Firearm.  (TR  at  page   25   line   16   to   page   26   line   17.)   I  find   that  this
event  that  occurred  more than  28  years  ago  does  not have  present  security  significance
under Personal Conduct.
Guideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
2.a.  and   2.b.  Applicant  admits  that  he  used  marijuana,  sometimes  on  a  daily
basis,  from  about  1978  until  about  June  of  2019,  a  period  of  more  than  40  years.  He
estimates his usage  to  be between 1,000~10,000  times.  Applicant also  purchased  the
marijuana  he  used,  knowing  that  for  the  vast  majority  of  the  40  years  his  use  and
purchases were illegal. (TR at page 20 lines 10~22, at page 47 line 25 to page 49 line
15, and at page 53 lines 16~19.)
2.c. Applicant admits that in September of 2017 he was cited for Possession of a
Controlled Substance, i.e., Psilocybin Mushrooms.  (TR at page 49 line 16 to page 50
line 3, and at page 66 lines 18~24.)
2.d.  Applicant  admits  that  in  about  November  of  1980,  in  California,  he  was
charged with Possession of Concentrated Cannabis. (TR at page 50 lines 4~6.)
2.e Applicant admits that in about January of 1987, in California, he was charged
with Plant Marijuana. (TR at page 50 lines 10~13.)
