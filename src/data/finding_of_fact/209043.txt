his  current  employer  since  December  2020.  He  served  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.
military  from  1978  until  he  retired  with  an  honorable  discharge  in  2000.  He  attended

Applicant has a history of tax problems, including not filing his federal income tax
returns for 2014 through 2020 when they were due. He stated, without documentation,
that he thought the 2014 tax return had been filed. He has spent much of his time since
2010  working  overseas  for  defense  contractors.  His  tax  issues  started  in  about  2013
when he was evacuated to the United States for medical issues. He returned overseas
about eight months later, but after a few months, he had to be evacuated again to the
United States. He felt that he would catch up on  the returns at a later date. (Tr. at 16,

Applicant’s  wife  retained  a  tax  company  (Tax  Company  1)  in  2018  to  file  their
back returns. The owners of the company were convicted of  defrauding the IRS out of
$3.3 million in 2021, by knowingly and fraudulently preparing and filing fraudulent client
tax  returns.  Applicant  stated  that  he  was  unaware  that  the  company  never  filed  his
returns. (Tr. at 16, 30, 38-39; Applicant’s response to SOR; AE 1, 4)
Applicant retained another tax company (Tax Company 2) in September 2020 to
file  his  back  returns  and  negotiate  any  taxes  owed.  He  reported  tax  issues  on  a
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) that he submitted on October 22,
2020. He wrote that he had hired a tax agency (Tax Company 2) to file the returns and
assist him in settling any taxes owed. He estimated that he owed $26,400 for tax years
2024 to 2019.1  He wrote: “federal tax documents have been returned/completed by tax
preparer and awaiting submission.  Enrolled in  tax forgiveness program.”  (Tr. at  16-17;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1; AE 1, 4)
The  back  returns  were  not  filed,  and  Applicant  was  not  enrolled  in  a  tax
forgiveness program. He retained a third tax company (Tax Company 3) on December
1, 2020, to file his back returns and negotiate any taxes owed. He was interviewed for
his  background  investigation  on  December  2,  2020.  He  stated  that  he  had  previously
hired a tax agency (Tax Company 2) to assist him with his taxes, but he was unhappy
with their services and decided to move on to the company he had just hired. He stated
that he was in a tax forgiveness program. He hoped to have all his tax issues resolved
by the end of 2021. (Tr. at 30-31; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 3; AE 1, 4)

It  asked  for  “Tax  Organizers  for  2015-2017”  and  “tax  Forms  for  those  years  [and]
(1099s/W2s).” (Applicant’s response to SOR; AE 6)
Applicant  responded  to  interrogatories  in  March  2022.  His  back  tax  returns  had
still  not  been  filed.  He  stated  that  he  forwarded  his  documents  to  Tax  Company  3  for
them to prepare his returns. (GE 3)
On  May  25,  2022,  Tax  Company  3  emailed  Applicant  requesting  information
about his rental property, including purchase price, date placed in service, income from
the property from 2015  to 2017, and expenses associated with the property. Applicant
responded to Tax Company 3 on May 27, 2022, stating that he purchased the property
in  1994  for  $70,000  and  placed  it  in  service  on  September  1,  2014.  (Applicant’s
response  to  SOR)  He  also  provided  the  following  to  Tax  Company  3  about  his  rental

documentation  and  tax  organizers  that  are  necessary  to  complete  the  tax  years  in
question have been submitted to [Tax Company 3] for resolution.”
Applicant retained a fourth tax company (Tax Company 4) on June 16, 2023, to
file  his back  and  current  returns  and  negotiate  any  taxes  owed.  He  agreed  to  pay  the
company  $3,500,  payable  in  seven  monthly  payments  of  $500,  starting  in  June  2023.
Company  4  prepared  and  filed  his  2022  federal  income  tax  return.  He  owes  about
$7,000 for tax year 2022. He stated that he planned to pay the 2022 taxes in September
2023. (Tr. at; 29-35; AE 7, 8, 10)
Applicant accepted responsibility for his tax problems, and he stated that he was
not attempting to circumvent the tax laws, but there is no evidence that the tax returns
for  2014  through  2021  have  been  filed.  He  estimates  that  he  owes  the  IRS  about
$25,000.  He  asserted  that  he  fully  intends  to  file  the  back  returns  and  pay  whatever
taxes are owed. (Tr. at 16-18, 28-42)
