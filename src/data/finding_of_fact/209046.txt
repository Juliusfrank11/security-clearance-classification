In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all of the Guideline H allegations,
he also listed what mitigating circumstances he believed applied to his case. I adopt his
admissions as findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and
exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 31  years old.  He has never married and has no children. He works
as  a  software  engineer  for  a  defense  contractor,  who  he  has  worked  for  since  2014.
This contractor is subject to the drug-free workplace provisions of 41 U.S.C. 701 et seq.
Applicant  holds  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  computer  science.  He  has  held  a  security
clearance since 2016. (Tr. 22-24, 34, 37, 47; GE 1)
The SOR alleged Applicant used marijuana from about 2008 to about 2013, and
from  about  September  2020  to  at  least  December  2021;  and  that  he  used  marijuana
from about September 2020 to least December 2021, while granted access to classified
information.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.b)  The  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.b  are  established  by
Applicant’s  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  admissions,  his  admissions  in  his
answers to interrogatories and his background interview, and his admissions in his SOR
answer. (GE 1-3; SOR answer)
Applicant  started  using  marijuana  in 2008  when he  was  17  or  18 years old.  He
used  marijuana  approximately  400  times  between  2008  and  2013.  Use  of  marijuana
was  illegal  under  state  law  where  Applicant  resided  until  2012.  He  claimed  to  have
stopped using marijuana in 2013 because it no longer fit his lifestyle. He began working
for  his  current  employer  in  2014  and  shortly  thereafter  completed  his  first  SCA.  He
admitted  his  earlier  use  of  marijuana  in  his  2014  SCA.  He  was  granted  a  security
clearance in 2016. He worked on a classified project from 2016 through approximately
2020,  when  he  no  longer  worked  on  that  project.  He  claimed  that  he  did  not  use
marijuana  during  this  time  period.  He  was  advised  by  his  work  supervisor  not  to  start
using marijuana now that he was no longer working on a classified project.  (Tr. 24-25,
31-32, 35-36, 41, 57; GE 2)
Applicant  resumed  using  marijuana  in  approximately  September  2020.  He
continued  his  use  through  approximately  December  2021.  He  testified  that  he  used
marijuana  one  to  three  times  a  week.  He  used  marijuana  with  his  then-girlfriend,  with
whom  he  no  longer  associates.  He  stated  his  reason  for  using  marijuana  during  this
time  span  was  to  relieve  stress  that  he  was  experiencing  due  to  the  isolation  from
friends and coworkers caused by the pandemic. He held a security clearance during this
entire  period,  but  he  clarified  that  he  only  had  access  to  classified  information  from
November  2021  to  December  2021.  He  admitted  knowing  his  employer’s  drug  policy,
which  prohibited  using  marijuana.  He  was  told  by  his  employer  in  2021  that  it  wanted
him on another classified project. He was required to fill out another SCA in May 2021
and  undergo  a  background  interview  in  June  and  July  2021.  He  admitted  using
marijuana after undergoing these security clearance activities. (Tr. 25-26, 33, 38-39, 42,
44, 47, 49; GE 2)
In  his  SOR  answer,  Applicant  asserted  that  he  would  not  use  marijuana  in  the
future. He denied that he was dependent on marijuana. He offered evidence that on four
occasions  between  October 2022  and  February  2023,  he  provided  urine  samples  that
tested negative for Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active ingredient in marijuana. He
began seeing a therapist in June 2022. He sees her weekly. She testified that they have
worked on how Applicant can better cope  with anxiety and stress. She uses Cognitive
Behavior Therapy as a  tool to address these  topics  and to decrease  his desire  to use
marijuana.  She  has  seen  improvements  in  him.  Applicant  also  presented  a  self-
administrated form for alcohol or drug abuse. While the assessment put Applicant at the
risk  level  of  “None  to  Low,”  I  gave  little  weight  to  this  assessment  because  all  the
information is provided by Applicant in response to “yes and no” questions. (Tr. 27, 30,
42-43, 50, 61-66; AE A-B)
Applicant’s  former supervisor,  who  worked  with  him on a  classified project from
2016 to 2020, testified for him and offered a written statement of support. He stated that
Applicant is an excellent engineer and is a trustworthy person. He is the supervisor who
warned  Applicant  not  to  use  marijuana  after  concluding  his  work  on  the  classified
project in 2020. He is also aware of  Applicant’s  marijuana use after 2020 but believes
he  has  learned  from  the  experience  and  recommends  him  for  a  clearance.  Applicant
presented  several  years’  worth  of  performance  appraisals  where  he  was  rated  as
“exceeded or significantly exceeded” expectations.” (Tr. 52-57; AE C-D)
