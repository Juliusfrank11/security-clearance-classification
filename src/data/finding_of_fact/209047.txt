Applicant is a 55-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since October 2018. He served on active duty in the U.S. military
from  1988  until  he  was  honorably  discharged  in  1996.  He  is  a  disabled  veteran  who
suffered  traumatic brain  injury  (TBI)  and other injuries  during his service.  He earned a
bachelor’s  degree  in  2002.  He  has  married and  divorced  four times.  His  last marriage
ended  in  2015.  He  has  a  12-year-old  child  from  his third  marriage.  (Transcript  (Tr.)  at

Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial  problems  including  unpaid  taxes  and
delinquent  debts.  The  SOR  alleges  four  delinquent  consumer  debts  totaling  about
$36,134  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.d)  and  $54,609  in  unpaid  taxes  for  tax  years  2016  and  2017
(SOR ¶ 1.e). Applicant admitted all the allegations.
Applicant  worked  for a  company  in  several  countries  from  about  2004  to  2011.
He  met  his  third  wife,  a  citizen  of  Country  A,  while  he  was  working  overseas.  They
married  and  had  their  child  in  2010.  She  also  had  another  child  from  a  previous
relationship. They moved to the United States in 2011. He had no furniture in the United
States, and the costs of furnishing their home plus the costs associated with the family’s
immigration  to  the  United  States  adversely  affected  his  finances.  They  separated  in
2012  and  divorced  in  2013,  which  further  strained  his  finances.  His  fourth  marriage
lasted from 2014 to 2015. (Tr. at 16-18, 31-34, 39; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1,

Applicant developed kidney problems in about 2011. He  was placed on dialysis
in 2013 and was told he would need a kidney transplant. He received his medical care
primarily from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). He was on a transplant list
through  the  VA.  He  was  informed  that  if  he  was  unemployed,  he  would  qualify  to  be
placed  on  a  transplant  list  from  Medicaid  and  increase  his  chances  for  a  kidney.  In
December 2017, he left the company he had worked for since at least 2005 in order to
qualify for Medicaid. He was told by the company that it would hire him back, but it did
not,  and  he  was  unemployed  until  he  started  his  current  job  in  a  different  state  at  a
lower salary in October 2018. He received his transplant through the VA in about 2019.

About $120,000 from Applicant’s 401(k) retirement account was disbursed to him
after he left the company in December 2017. There were significant tax implications. He
thought it would be taxable in 2018, but it was 2017 income. He used some of the funds
to  pay  bills.  He  decided  to  “day  trade”  about  $50,000  in  the  stock  market.  He  was
unsuccessful, and he lost about $50,000. (Tr. at 41-44, 70-71; GE 3)
The four SOR debts became delinquent in about 2016. He also incurred a debt of
about  $30,000  that  he  did  not  pay.  This  debt  was  not  alleged  in  the  SOR,  apparently
because  it  is  not  listed  on  any  of  the  credit  reports  in  evidence.1 None   of   those   five
debts  have  been  paid.  The  debts  are  no  longer listed  on  his credit report.  (Tr. at  18, 49-
54; Applicant’s response to  SOR; GE 3-5; AE 2-4)
Applicant did not have enough taxes withheld from his paycheck for years so that
he would have extra income, and then he was unable to pay the taxes when they were
due the next year. Before adding penalties and interest, Applicant owed the IRS about
$7,000 for 2014; $7,500 for 2015; $8,600 for 2016; and $28,500 for 2017. Penalties and
interest added to those figures. (Tr. at 17; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3)
Applicant decided that he would address his taxes before his consumer debts. In
April 2019, the IRS withheld $3,202 from what would have been a refund from tax year
2018 and transferred it to what was owed for his 2014 taxes. He paid $300 toward his
2014 taxes in January 2020. He entered into an installment agreement with the IRS in
February  2020.  He  regularly  made  the  $600  payments,  and  in  April  2020,  the  IRS
withheld  $1,477  from  what  would  have  been  a  refund  from  tax  year  2019  and
transferred it to his 2014 taxes. The 2014 taxes were paid in full with a $600 payment in
December 2020. (Tr. at 44, 49; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3, 8)
In April 2019, the IRS withheld $2,921 from what would have been a refund from
tax year 2018 and transferred it to his 2015 taxes. In April 2020, the IRS withheld $980
from what would have been his 2019 refund and transferred it to his 2015 taxes. After
his  2014  taxes  were  paid,  his  $600  monthly  installment  payments  went  to  his  2015
taxes.  The  2015  taxes  were  paid  in  full  with  a  $600  payment  in  November  2021.
(Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3, 8)
Applicant  continued  to  make  $600  monthly  installment  payments  through
February  2023.  There  was  no  payment  in  March  2023.  His  installment  plan  was
reduced  to  $552  per  month.  He  made  the  April,  May,  and  June  2023  payments.  In
October 2022, he owed $9,657 for 2016 and $45,067 for 2017. That amount is reduced
by  the  payments  he  has  made  since  October  2022  (at  least  $4,056).  (Tr.  at  46-47;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3, 8; AE 5)
Applicant  corrected  the  under-withholding  of  his  taxes  in  2018.  Since  2018,  he
would  have received a  refund every  year if the IRS  had not transferred  the  refunds  to
his back taxes. The IRS transferred $6,123 from what would have been his 2018 refund;
$2,588  from  his  2019  refund;  $3,707  from  his  2020  refund;  and  $667  from  his  2021
refund. (Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3)
Applicant asserted that he would continue with the installment plan until his back
taxes are paid. He has about $15,400 in stock options that will vest in December 2023.
He may sell his motorcycle. He plans to use the money from his stock options and the

conditions, and in the whole-person analysis.
sale  of  his  motorcycle  to  pay  his  taxes.  He  stated  that  he  plans  to  pay  his  consumer
debts after his taxes are paid. (Tr.at 49, 53, 72, 78; Applicant’s response to SOR; AE 6)
Applicant submitted letters attesting to his excellent job performance and strong
moral character. He is praised for his  truthfulness, honesty, trustworthiness, allegiance
to  the  United  States,  work  ethic,  reliability,  dependability,  dedication,  responsibility,
competence, intelligence, maturity, compassion, positive attitude, and integrity. (AE 1)
