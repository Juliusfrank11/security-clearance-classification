There  are  17  allegations  in  the SOR.  The  first  two are  federal tax allegations.
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges a failure to file a federal tax return for tax 2019. SOR ¶ 1.b alleges a
failure to pay taxes for tax year 2012. SOR ¶ 1.b through 1.q identify sixteen delinquent
accounts  consisting  of  one  tax  account,  12  commercial  accounts,  and  three  medical
accounts,  amounting  to  $18,765.  Applicant  successfully  disputed  two  accounts
identified at SOR ¶¶ 1.p (medical) and SOR ¶ 1.q (commercial), and they were removed
from his credit report. The number of creditors is reduced to 14, and the total amount of
delinquent  debt  is  reduced  to  $17,444,  consisting  of  11  commercial  accounts,  two
medical accounts, and one tax account. Applicant admitted all allegations  in the SOR,
but  claimed  that  he  disputed  a  few  debts  and  others  no  longer  appeared  in  his  credit
report.
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  that  Applicant  failed  to  file  a  Federal  income  tax  return  for
2019.  This  allegation  is  based  on  Applicant’s  disclosure  in  his  October  2021  security
clearance application  that he did not  file his 2019  Federal tax  return.  In  his December
2021 PSI, he stated that he planned to file his 2019 return when he filed his 2021 return
in  2022.  (Item  9  at  6)  In  his  December  2022  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  claimed  that  he
called the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in December 2022, and was informed that he
did  not  file returns for tax  years 2018 and  2020, and  not 2019. In his  December 2022
answer  to  the  SOR,  he  submitted  processed  federal  returns  for  tax  years  2018  and
2020. He owed $536 for tax year 2018 and $700 for tax year 2020. However, he did not
produce documented evidence to confirm that he filed his 2019 Federal tax return. This
allegation has not been resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges that Applicant owes delinquent taxes to the IRS for tax year
2012.  In  his  October  2021  security  clearance  application,  he  stated  that  he  owed  the
United States (US) Treasury $1,100 for year 2012. (Item 3 at 50) Pursuant to E3.1.17.
of DOD Directive 5220.6, I am amending this allegation by inserting the dollar amount of
taxes  that  Applicant  owes  ($1,100)  for  tax  year  2012.  He  admitted  in  his  May  2022
interrogatory  responses  that  his  2012  Federal  taxes  were  not  paid.  (Item  5  at  8)  He
explained  in  his  December  2022  answer  to  the  SOR  that  he  contacted  the  IRS  in
December  2022.  The  agency  informed  him  to  address  the  SOR  ¶  1.a  missing  returns
first, then file Form 9465 for federal tax year 2012. Even though he provided evidence of
filing the 2018 and 2020 Federal tax returns, he provided no documentation that he filed
federal tax Form 9465, or that he paid the $1,100 in federal taxes for tax year 2012. The
account has not been satisfied.
SOR ¶ 1.c is a credit account that became delinquent in July 2021. (Item 6 at 5;
Item 7 at 2) In his December 2022 answer to the SOR, he claimed that he spoke with an
agent of the collection agency and negotiated a repayment plan to begin on December
28, 2022, with payments of $240 a month. With no documented proof of payments, i.e.,
cancelled checks, a bank statement or ledger, receipts, or other documented verification
of payment, the debt is unresolved.
SOR ¶ 1.d is a delinquent account held by a collection agency for the original
payday  loan  creditor.  The  account  became  delinquent  in  January  2022.  Applicant
indicated  in  his  December  2022  answer  that  the  original  creditor  advised  him  that  the
account  had  been  transferred  to  a  collection  agency.  When  he  is  contacted  by  the
collection agency, he will pay the account. This account has not been paid.
SOR  ¶  1.e  is  a  phone  account  that  became  delinquent  in  November  2020.
(Item  7  at  2)  Applicant  averred  in  his  December  2022  answer  that  he  entered  a
repayment agreement calling for payments of $191 a month for four months. Applicant
did not indicate when the payment  plan was to begin. Due to the fact that no proof has
been  provided  about  when  the  payment  agreement  began  or  to  verify  payments,  this
account is unresolved.
SOR  ¶  1.f  represents  a  delinquent  payday  loan  that  was  transferred  to  a
collection agency in February 2019.  (Item 6 at 5; Item 7 at 2) Applicant claims that he
called  the  agent  and  agreed  to  pay  $124  a  month  for  five  months.  The  claims  are
unsupported. The account is unresolved.
SOR  ¶  1.g  represents  a  student  loan  account  that  became  delinquent  in
December  2019.  (Item  6  at  6)  Applicant  informed  the  OPM  investigator  in  December
2021  that  he  withdrew  from  some  courses  because  he  was  sent  overseas  by  his
employer.  He  planned  to  dispute  the  debt  because  he  did  not  believe  that  he  should
have to reimburse the school the entire cost of the course when he was enrolled for only
a short time. He acknowledged he would pay the debt if his reimbursement request was
denied.  (Item  9  at  10)  In  his  December  2022  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  the
allegation  and  claimed  that  he  had  set  up  a  payment  plan  to  pay  $100  a  month
beginning  in  January  2023.  The  lack  of  documented  support  for  his  claim  results  in  a
finding against him under the allegation.
SOR  ¶  1.h  is  a  shopping  credit  card  allowing  the  purchaser  to  pay  for  items
over  longer  periods  of  time  than  normally  allowed  by  other  credit-card  providers.  The
account became delinquent in December 2021. (Item 7 at 3) Applicant contended in his
December  2022  answer  to  the  SOR  that  his  payment  plan  required  $130  a  month
payments for 6 months. The claim lacks documentary support.
SOR ¶ 1.i is a credit-card instrument allowing the debtor more time than other
credit-card  providers  to  pay  on  credit  obligations.  The  account  became  delinquent  in
December 2021. (Item 7 at 3) Without documentation in support, Applicant claimed that
he resumed payments on the credit account on December 14, 2022. The account is still
unresolved.
SOR  ¶  1.j  became  delinquent  in  June  2021.  (Item  6  at  7;  Item  7  at  3)  In  his
December  2022  answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  promised  to  pay  the  entire  balance  in
January 2023. The debt is not paid.
SOR  ¶  1k  is  a  commercial  account  that  became  delinquent  in  March  2022.
(Item 7 at 3) Applicant asserted that he paid this account and it should be removed from
his credit report. (December 2022 answer to the SOR) The account remains unpaid.
SOR  ¶  1.l  is  an  unidentified  unsecured  loan  that  converted  to  a  delinquent
account  in  July  2022.  (Item  7  at  4)  Applicant  intended  to  pay  the  account  in  January
2023.  Without  documentation  in  support  of  Applicant’s  stated  intention,  the  account
remains unresolved.
SOR  ¶  1.m  is  a  medical  account  that  became  delinquent  in  November  2021.
(Item 6 at 3) In his December 2022 answer, he claims that he disputed the account. The
information  included  in  the  CBR  entry  above  does  not  include  a  notation  showing  the
account  was  being  disputed.  The  fact  that  the  account  may  no  longer  appear  in
Applicant’s  credit report  does not  negate the fact that  he  still owes the  account.  In  his
October  2021  security  clearance  application,  he  recognized  the  account  because  he
stated he had no insurance at the time, and he nevertheless sought to have the account
removed from his credit report. (Item 3 at 55) The debt is unresolved.
SOR  ¶ 1.n  is a commercial  account in which  Applicant  leased some tires and
rims. He apparently signed a 24-month lease for the products. After a week of use, he
tried to return the tires and rims, but the dealer would not rescind the contract. Applicant
did not believe he should have to pay for rest of the lease for only one week’s use. In
his  December  2022  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  stated  he  would  start  a  payment  plan  in
January 2023 paying $165 a month. No evidence of a payment plan nor payments was
produced.
SOR ¶  1.o  is a medical account that became delinquent in  July 2021. (Item  6  at
5) In  his December  2022  answer,  he maintained  that  he  disputed  the  debt  and  the  debt
is no  longer on  his credit  report. Applicant did  not furnish  a  credit report  establishing  his
claim.
SOR  ¶  1.p  is  a  medical  account  that  became  delinquent  in  November  2021.
(Item 6 at 6) In his response to interrogatories dated May 13, 2022, Applicant indicated
no  action  had  been  taken  on  this  debt,  thereby  acknowledging  the  debt  was  his
responsibility.  In  his  December  2022  answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  claimed  that  he
disputed  the  debt  and  it  was  no  longer  on  his  credit  report.  The  2021  credit  report
reflects  that  he  did  dispute  the  debt  (Item  6  at  6)  and  it  does  not  appear  in  the
Government’s 2022 credit report. (Item 7) The account is resolved in Applicant’s favor.
SOR   ¶   1.q   is  a   credit  account  currently  in   collection.  The   account  became
delinquent   in  October   2021.  (Item  6   at   6)  The   2022   credit  report  indicates  that   the
balance  on  the  account was zero following  Applicant’s dispute  of the  account.  (Item  7  at
4)  The  account is resolved in  Applicant’s favor.
In  his  March  2019  PSI,  Applicant  recalled  enrolling  in  a  debt  consolidation
program in the same month. He recollected that he included four debts in the program.
(Item  8  at  11)  Subsequently,  he  noted  his  participation  in  another  debt  consolidation
program for an undisclosed period of time. He has never had financial counseling. His
May  2022  personal  financial  statement  (PFS)  indicates  that  his  monthly  expenses
exceed his monthly income by $22. (Item 3 at 49; Item 5 at 11; Item 9 at 11)
Applicant’s  opined  that  his  financial  difficulties  were  caused after his  wife  was
unable continue working about seven years ago. He remembered making poor financial
decisions  in  the  past,  but  his  decisions  regarding  how  he  spends  his  money  have
improved. He recalled that in the past he was earning a larger salary and was able to
pay  his  bills  in  a  timely  manner.  He  considers  that  he  has  the  professionalism  and
integrity to faithfully execute all aspects of his job. His employer will readily support his
consistently superlative work record. (Item 5 at 10)
