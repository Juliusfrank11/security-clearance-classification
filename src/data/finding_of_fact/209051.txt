Applicant  admitted  SOR  allegations  1.a-1.f;  2.a-2.b;  3.a-3.e,  3.g,  and  3.i.  He
denied  SOR  ¶¶  3.f  and  3.h.  His  admissions  are  adopted  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a
thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following
additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 52 years old. He has worked for his current contractor-employer since
January 2020. He served in the U.S. Army from 1991 until 2001, when he was honorably
discharged. He has worked for various government contractors since his Army discharge.
He has taken some college courses. He is divorced and has one adult child. He has held
a security clearance or a public trust position in the past. (Tr. 5, 18-19, 22; GE1-2)
Under  Guideline  E,  the  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  deliberately  gave  false
information  on  his  March  2022  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  when  he  failed  to
disclose that he was fired from a job within the past seven years because of a positive
urinalysis test (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.b) and his illegal drug use (SOR ¶ 1.c). It also alleged that
he was terminated from his job in April 2019 because he tested positive for marijuana
(SOR ¶ 1.d). It alleged that he admitted to a background investigator that he intentionally
omitted  information  from  his  SCA  (SOR  ¶  1.e).  It  also  alleged  he  used  marijuana  and
tested positive for its presence in 1995 or 1996, while possessing a security clearance
(SOR ¶ 1.f). Applicant admitted all the allegations during his background interview, in his
SOR answer, and during his testimony. (Tr. 19-22; GE 2; SOR answer)
Under Guideline H, the SOR alleged in April 2019 Applicant failed a urinalysis test
for marijuana (SOR ¶ 2.a); and that he was arrested in August 2003 for unlawful use and
possession of a controlled substance marijuana (SOR ¶ 2.b). Applicant admitted all the
allegations during his background interview, in his SOR answer, and during his testimony.
(Tr. 19-24; GE 2; SOR answer)
Under Guideline J, the SOR cross-alleged the drug allegations stated in SOR ¶ 2
above (SOR ¶ 3.a and 3.j). It also alleged a series of criminal arrests as follows: a March
1992 arrest in a foreign country for misuse of privileges (SOR ¶ 3.i); a July 1992 arrest
for theft of government property (SOR ¶ 3.h); an August 1993 arrest for adultery (SOR ¶
3.g); a  December 1993  arrest  for adultery (SOR  ¶  3.f); a  June  2000  arrest  for  assault
(SOR ¶ 3.e); a July 2000 arrest for driving while license under restraint (SOR ¶ 3.d); an
April 2001  arrest  for his failure  to  appear (SOR  ¶  3.c);  and  his August  2001  arrest  for
damaging  property,  criminal  mischief,  and  making  a  false  police  report  (SOR  ¶  3.b).
Applicant  admitted  all  the  allegations,  except  for  SOR  ¶¶  3.f  and  3.h,  during  his
background interview, in his SOR answer, and during his testimony. (Tr. 19-24, 26-31,
34-37, 40-42, 45-46; GE 2; SOR answer)
In 2019, Applicant was working for his employer on a government project. He held
a  position of trust at  the time.  He knowingly ingested some edible marijuana lozenges
while employed by this company. He consumed two over two days. Three weeks later,
he was assigned to drive a company vehicle  and was involved in an accident. He was
required to take a urinalysis test because of the accident. It came back with a positive
result for the presence of marijuana. His employer immediately terminated him from his
position based upon  his use of marijuana. He  was aware of the  company’s drug  policy
and knew he was not allowed to use any illegal drugs during his employment with this
contractor. (Tr. 21-22, 45; GE 2)
In  March 2022,  Applicant  completed  an  SCA  for  his current  employer.  He  gave
false information on his SCA when he deliberately failed to disclose in Section 13A and
13C that he was fired for cause in 2019 because of his use of marijuana as established
by a positive urinalysis test. He also deliberately failed to disclose his 2019 marijuana use
in Section 23 of his 2022 SCA. During his background investigation and at his hearing,
Applicant admitted knowingly making these false statements because he was afraid that
revealing  the  truth  would  jeopardize  his chances  of  receiving  a  security  clearance.  He
admitted his arrest for using and possessing marijuana in 2003 on a military installation.
He  denied  the  marijuana  was  his,  or that  he used  it  on  that  occasion,  and  there  is no
record  evidence  contradicting  his  statement.  He  admitted  using  marijuana  and  testing
positive for it in approximately 1995 or 1996 when he was in the Army. (Tr. 19, 46; GE 2)
In August 2001, he was angry with his ex-wife who was storing some furniture at
his residence. In his anger, he destroyed several pieces of furniture. He later called the
police and reported that someone broke into his house and destroyed the furniture. He
was confronted by the officers about submitting false information and admitted that he did
so.  He  was  charged  with  destruction  of  property  and  filing  a  false  police  report.  He
admitted committing these offenses. (Tr. 30-31; GE 2, 4)
Applicant admitted his arrest for failing to appear for a court appearance in 2001.
He admitted his arrest for driving while his license was under restraint in July 2000. He
admitted his arrest for assault in June 2000. He admitted his arrest for adultery in August
1993. He admitted his arrest in March 1992 for misuse of privileges. There is no additional
evidence available about these offenses. (SOR answer)
Applicant  denied  an  arrest  for  adultery and sodomy  in  December 1993,  and  an
arrest for larceny of government property in July 1992. There is no evidence in the record
to contradict his denials. (Tr. 27, 35; GE 1-4; SOR answer)
Applicant testified that he has not used marijuana since 2019. He has not been
arrested since 2003. He provided a written statement promising to abstain from using any
illegal substances in the future. (Tr. 25, 29, 33; AE A)
