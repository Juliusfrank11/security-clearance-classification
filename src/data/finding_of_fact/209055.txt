Applicant  served  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  military  from  2001  until  he  was
honorably discharged for medical reasons in 2017. He deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan
while on active duty. He received separation pay of about $121,000. The Department of
Veterans  Affairs  (VA)  gave  him  a  disability  rating  of  50%,  which  equated  to  tax-free
payments  of  about  $1,250  a month.  The  VA  increased  the  disability  rating  to  100%  in
about  December  2022,  which  raised  the  monthly  payments  to  about  $4,000  a  month.

Applicant  has  a  history  of  buying  and  selling  vehicles,  and  sometimes  turning
them  back  as  a  voluntary repossession.  In  about  2012,  he  voluntarily  surrendered  the
car that was driven by his wife after she lost her job. A credit report from August 2019
listed  the  account  as  opened  in  November  2012  with  a  high  credit  of  $45,463.  The
creditor  charged  off  $20,616  in  about  May 2013  (SOR  ¶  1.c).  Applicant  has  not made
any  payments  on  the  deficiency  balance  owed  on  the  loan.  (Tr.  at  14,  29-30,  35-39;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1-5)
Applicant purchased and financed vehicles in about September 2016 and March
2017.  When  he  learned  he  was  being  discharged  from  the  military,  he  decided  to
voluntarily  surrender  both  vehicles,  buy  a  new  home,  and  use  the  money  that  would
have  gone  to  the  vehicle  loans  to  pay  the  mortgage  for  the  new  home.  The  February
2023 credit report lists the two accounts as charged off, with balances of $40,658 (SOR
¶ 1.a) and $21,986 (SOR ¶ 1.b). (Tr. at 17-18, 31-34, 37; Applicant’s response to SOR;

Applicant attended college after his discharge. In addition to his separation pay,
he lived off his VA disability pay, the GI Bill, and his wife’s limited income. He worked for
about ten months in 2020, but his employment has been sporadic. A security clearance
will  greatly  increase  his  economic  opportunities.  (Tr.  at  15,  20-25,  42-44;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 1, 2)
Applicant has not paid any of the vehicle accounts, and he does not intend to. He
sees  no  financial  value  in  paying  for  vehicles  he  does  not  possess.  The  mortgage
account on the house he bought in 2017 is listed on the August 2019 credit report with a
high credit of $212,798 and a balance of $204,843. He refinanced the mortgage with the
same financial institution in March 2022. The February 2023 credit report shows a final
payment on the original mortgage loan of $192,525. That report lists the new mortgage
loan with a high credit of $288,000, with monthly payments of $1,384, and a balance of
$283,315. (Tr. at 30-31, 34, 38-41, 45; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3, 4)
Applicant  bought  a  vehicle  financed  through  a  loan  of  about  $56,321  in  July
2021.  He  owed  about  $53,935  when  he  paid  the  loan  off  in  March  2022  from  the
proceeds  of  his  refinanced  mortgage  loan.  He  purchased  another  vehicle  in  about
August  2022  financed  through  a  loan  of  about  $36,697.  He  traded  that  vehicle  in  and
purchased  another  vehicle  in  about  April  2023.  (Tr.  at  38-40;  Applicant’s  response  to
SOR; GE 4, 5)
