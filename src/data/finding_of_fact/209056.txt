Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations in her Answer, with explanations. She
is 34 years old. As of her May 2022 security clearance application (SCA), she was not
married, she did not have any children, and she has lived with her parents since 2019.
She graduated from high school in 2008. She attended college in 2008 or 2009 and in
2013,  but  she  did  not  earn  a  degree.  She  has  worked  as  a  mechanical  technician  for
her  employer,  a  DOD  contractor,  since  approximately  November  2010.  She  was  first
granted a security clearance in approximately April 2019. (Items 1-6)
Applicant used marijuana, with varying frequency, from approximately July 2008
to  November  2017.  (SOR  ¶  2.b)  She  used  it  socially  and  less  than  ten  times.  She
disclosed this marijuana use on her July 2018 SCA. She indicated therein that she did
not intend to use marijuana  in the future because, “I don’t like the smell or taste of it.”
(Items 2-4)
In  approximately  July  2021,  while  holding  a  security  clearance,  Applicant
purchased  and  used  a  vape  pen  containing  marijuana.  She  indicated  in  her  August
2022 background interview that  she smoked marijuana on this occasion recreationally,
in her home, with a friend because she was bored. It made her feel relaxed. She further
indicated that she realized she was not allowed to consume marijuana while possessing
a security clearance, but she made a bad judgment call. She stated in her January 2023
response  to  interrogatories  that  this  was  a  “one  time  purchase  with  cash  legally  in
California. I think it was $30.” She stated that she decided thereafter to stop using illegal
substances  because  “I  just  didn’t  like  it  and  I  honestly  felt  bad  about  it.”  She  further
stated  that  she  did  not  have  any  intentions  for  future  marijuana  use,  and  she  did  not
associate  with  individuals  who  use  illegal  substances  or  frequent  places  where  illegal
substances are used. (SOR ¶ 2.a; Items 2, 5)
Applicant  did  not  disclose   her  relevant  drug   involvement   in  response   to   section
23   of  her  2022   SCA,   which   inquired   about   illegal  use   of  drugs  or  drug   activity.  She
marked  “No,”  and  did not  disclose  her marijuana  use  from  2015  to  2017,  and  in  2021,  in
response   to   a   question   that   inquired   whether  she   had   illegally   used   any   drug   or
controlled   substances   in  the   last   seven   years.  She   also   marked   “No,”   and   did  not
disclose her  use  of  marijuana  in  2021, while holding  a  security clearance,  in  response  to
a  question  that inquired  whether  she  had  ever illegally used  or otherwise been  illegally
involved  with  a  drug  or  controlled  substance  while possessing  a  security  clearance.  She
also disclosed  that she  had  a  security clearance  that was granted  to  her in 2019. (GE  2-
