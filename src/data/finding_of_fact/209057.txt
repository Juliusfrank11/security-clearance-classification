In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, she admitted SOR ¶ 1.a and denied SOR ¶ 1.d.
Her admissions  are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After a thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of
fact.
Applicant is 68-year-old Federal contractor. She  holds a  bachelor’s degree. She
married in 1990 and has an adult  son.  She has been granted a security clearance twice,
in October 2012 and January 2022.
“E3.l  .6. Should review of the  applicant's  answer to the SOR indicate  that allegations  are unfounded, or
evidence is  insufficient for  further processing,  Department Counsel  shall  take such action  as  appropriate
under  the  circumstances, including  but not limited  to withdrawal  of the  SOR and  transmittal  to the  Director
for notification of the DISCO for appropriate  action.”
2 If SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.c and 1.e-1.f had remained I would have adopted the Government’s analysis and mitigated
these allegations.
Applicant's  financial  difficulties  began  in  2014  due  to  income  loss  and  her
husband's  accumulating  medical  bills.  Due  to  her  husband’s  medical  issues,  she  was
unemployed at various times between 2012 and 2019. (Item 13 at 2.)  She enrolled the
debts delineated in SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1c and 1.e-1.f totaling about $43,435, in a payment plan
with  a  debt  relief  company  in  2019.  (Item  13  at  3.)  The  Government  withdrew  these
allegations on the basis that she had resolved or sufficiently mitigated them.
The evidence concerning the two remaining delinquent debts totaling $63,005 is
summarized below.
SOR ¶  1.a: past-due account  charged off in  the  amount  of  $56,612. Applicant’s
debt arose from a second mortgage on a previous residence. Her husband got sick right
after they  bought  a  new  home.  She  paid  the  doctors  first to  get  the  help  her husband
needed. (Item 13 at 4.) The home was sold in a short sale arranged by her husband in
2016, which she believed was supposed to have covered the delinquency. (Item 14 at 7.)
In July 2022, a Writ of Garnishment was issued against  Applicant's wages to satisfy the
debt. She stated she was never served with the court papers, which resulted in the default
judgment. She contacted a law firm to seek assistance in reaching a settlement with the
creditor. The law firm stated that efforts to negotiate a settlement had been unsuccessful
to date. (Item 3.)
SOR ¶  1.d:  past-due account  charged off in the  amount  of  $6,393. Applicant
denied SOR ¶ 1.d on the basis she was unaware of the debt and would have enrolled it
in the debt relief payment plan. (Item 13 at 5; Item 14 at 7; Answer.) The debt is held by
the same creditor as SOR ¶ 1.a, and she believes may be linked to the mortgage and
short sale. She states she has not heard from the creditor. (Item 13 at 5.)  In both ESIs
she stated she was unaware of the debt and why it was coming up. (Item 13 at 5 and Item
14 at 7.)
Applicant states she has worked to avoid having to file for bankruptcy. She  has
been using a debt relief company since 2019, prior to the start of the security clearance
process,  to  resolve her debts.  The debt  relief  company  has  worked  with  her creditors.
(Item 13 at 4.) Prior to receiving the FORM, she had resolved over $43,000 of debt. Her
actions resulted in the withdrawal of SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1c and 1.e-1.f.
