Applicant  is  a  61-year-old  employee  of  a  government  contractor  for  whom  she
has  worked  since  May  2023.  She  worked  for  the  same  contractor  from  October  2009
until July 2022, when she quit because she suffered serious health issues. She married
in 1988 and divorced in 1998. She has an adult daughter. She took some online college
courses  from  1996  until  1997  but  did  not  earn  a  degree.  She  earned  a  vocational
certificate  in  2005.  She  served  on  active  duty  in  the  Air  Force  from  1987  until  1994,
when she earned an honorable discharge. (Tr. 18-26, 30; GE 1, 2; AE B, C)
In the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant’s seven delinquent debts totaling
approximately $30,000 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.g), and delinquent state  sales taxes for
the business she owns (SOR ¶ 1.h). These delinquencies consist of the following: credit
cards (SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.e); a utility (SOR ¶ 1.f); a telecommunications debt (SOR ¶
1.g);  and  state  sales  taxes  (SOR  ¶  1.h).  She  admitted  the  SOR  allegations  with
additional  comments.  Her  admissions  are  adopted  as  findings  of  fact.  The  SOR
allegations  are  established  through  her  admissions  and  the  Government’s  credit
reports. (Tr. 64; Answer; GE 1-5)
Applicant  has  not  resolved   the   debts  alleged   in  SOR  ¶¶   1.a   through   1.g.   As
evidenced  by the  Government credit reports,  the  debts in SOR ¶¶  1.a  and  1.c through
1.e  were  delinquent by  early 2017, and  the debt  in SOR ¶  1.b  was delinquent by March
2019. As evidenced  by her  listing  them  in her  March 2020  Electronic Questionnaire  for
Investigations  Processing  (SF 86),  the  debts in SOR ¶¶  1.f  and  1.g  were  delinquent by
March 2020.  She  disputed  the  amount of the  debt in  SOR ¶  1.g, but she  did not provide
documentation   to   substantiate   why  she   owes  less.   She   relies  on   the   fact   that   she
disputed  the  debt,  and  the  debt  no  longer appears  on  a  credit report as proof that  she
resolved  it.  She  claimed  that  she  reached  out to  the  creditors for  the  debts  in  SOR ¶¶
1.a, 1.f, and  1.g  “during  COVID”  to  attempt  to  resolve  those  debts,  but she  did not hear
back  from   those   creditors.  She   has   not  made   any  resolution   attempts  on   those   debts
since  then. She  has made  no  resolution  attempts  on  the  remaining debts  (SOR ¶¶  1.b
through   1.e),   because   she   claimed   she   did   not   have   the   available   funds  to   make
payments.  She   claimed   that   she  has   made  payment   arrangements  with   several   of   her
creditors  after  the   hearing   and   is  scheduled   to   make   payments  beginning   in  August
2023.   She   provided   no   documentation   to   corroborate   these   arrangements   and   did   not
specify the creditors or the  payment amounts.  (Tr. 35-36, 40-44; Answer; GE  1-5)
In  2017, Applicant became  delinquent on  state  sales tax  to  State  A  for the  food-
truck  business   (Food  Truck)   she   owned,   because   she   was  not  collecting   those   taxes
during   her  sales  transactions.   She   was  not  collecting   the   taxes  because   she   was
disorganized,  did  not  understand   the   process,   and   had   other  expenses  she   covered
instead.  In  about 2018, she  made  a  payment  arrangement  with  State  A  to  pay  $150  per
month   to   satisfy  the   Food   Truck’s  delinquent  sales   taxes,   but   she   defaulted   on   those
payments   in  about  2020   because   the   Food   Truck  was  not  making   enough   money.  In
about   November  2022,  State   A   audited   the   Food   Truck  and   determined   that  the
business  owed  about $12,000  in  delinquent sales taxes. In  about May 2023, she  made
a   payment   arrangement   with   State   A   to   pay  about  $450   per  month   towards  those
delinquent   sales taxes.  She   has   been   current  on   this payment  arrangement  since   she
made  it.  She  now appropriately collects the  state  sales tax for the  Food  Truck  and  does
not  believe  that she  will  fall  further behind  on  these  taxes  in  the  future.   (Tr. 48-55,  58-
61, 68-71; GE 1, 2;  AE  A)
In  addition  to  the  aforementioned  causes  of  her  delinquent  state  sales  taxes,
Applicant’s  delinquencies  were  caused  by  her  starting  a  business  in  2016  that  was
losing  money  until  2022,  when  it  started  to  break  even.  The  COVID-19  pandemic
contributed to the Food Truck’s problems by not allowing her to fully operate it. She also
had  a  10-month  period  of  unemployment  from  July  2022  until  May  2023,  that  was
caused  by  a  serious  chronic  health  issue  that  caused  her  to  fear  for  her  life.  After  a
diagnosis  and  treatment,  this  chronic  health  issue  has  stabilized.  She  had  additional
health problems when she fell in September 2022, causing a concussion and a broken
bone. She also broke her wrist in March 2023. (Tr. 18-20, 26-40, 65; Answer; AE B-E)
Applicant earned about $4,600 per month in take-home pay before she became
unemployed  in  July  2022.  She  has  earned  about  $4,800  per month  in  take-home  pay
since she was rehired in May 2023. She has received about $165 per month from the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in disability benefits. She is not delinquent on any
accounts other than those listed in the SOR, but she has been a month behind on her
car payment, her car insurance, and her cable bill in the last few months. She does not
have much money left over after her expenses are paid and has about $160 combined
in  her  checking  and  savings  accounts.  She  has  no  retirement  savings  as  she  cashed
those  out  to  help  her stay  afloat  while  she  was  unemployed.  She  owes  $3,000  to  her
siblings that she borrowed while she was unemployed.  She also survived on Medicaid
and food stamps while she was unemployed. She believes that she will be able to start
saving  enough  money  to  pay  her  delinquencies,  including  the  money  she  owes  her
siblings, in September or October 2023. Despite the financial problems the Food Truck
has caused her, she plans to continue with it. (Tr. 20-26, 65-67)
