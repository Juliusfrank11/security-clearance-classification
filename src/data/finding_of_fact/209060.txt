The SOR alleges 14 delinquent debts totaling $39,847, including 10 student loans
totaling $37,095 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.j), and four credit accounts in collection for $2,752 (SOR
¶ 1.k-1.n). In Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.l, with
explanation, and denied all other allegations.
Applicant  is  a  44-year-old  senior  systems  administrator  employed  by  a  defense
contractor since January 2019. He has been employed in various information technology
(IT) positions since 2006, and worked for several federal contractors from April 2014 to
November 2018. He was unemployed for one month in 2008, and from November 2018
to January 2019. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from June 2001 to August
2003, and was honorably discharged because of medical issues. He has a secret security
clearance. (GE 1; AE O; Tr. 37-47, 69-70, 96)
Applicant attended a university from 1997 to 1998 and a college from 2004 to 2006;
he did not receive a degree but earned several IT certifications. He married in 2001 and
has one child, age 20. (GE 1; AE A-B; Tr. 32-35, 39-46, 69)
Applicant  attributed  his
to  his  underemployment,
unemployment, lack of focus on resolving his student loan debt, costs associated with his
wife’s education and health, and maintaining two households. (Answer; GE 1; Tr. 29-30,
39-43, 48-56, 61-62, 93-94)
financial  problems
The evidence concerning the specific SOR allegations is summarized below.
SOR  ¶¶   1.a-1.j:  student   loans   placed  for  collection  of   $37,095.  Applicant
denied  each  allegation  explaining  that  his  student  loans  had  been  consolidated,  were
current and within his ability to pay. (Answer; Tr. 30-32, 68-69, 73-79) In his May 2019
SCA, he disclosed $45,000 in delinquent student loans that he had “put off paying . . . too
long and then waited too long to call and make arrangements.”  (GE 1 at 44; Tr. 28-29)
He received the student loans from 1997 to 1998 and 2004 to 2006. (GE 3-6) In 2018, he
focused  on  cleaning  up  his  credit  in  order  to  qualify  for  a  mortgage  and  decided  to
rehabilitate his student loan accounts. (Answer; GE 1 at 45; AE A; Tr. 28, 55-57) Credit
reports from May 2019 and March 2020 showed his student loans as in collection. (GE
3-4) He submitted evidence of student loan payments totaling $4,200 from October 2018
to  November  2019,  and  $3,237  from  August  2020  to  December  2020.  (AE  H-J)  He
successfully rehabilitated his student loan accounts by November 2020. (AE H, L; Tr. 29,
75-80) In June 2021, he consolidated the 10 student loans alleged in the SOR into two
loans totaling $33,124. (Answer; GE 5 at 5, GE 6 at 7; AE B-D; Tr. 73-77) In April 2023,
the  account  balance  was  $33,114,  with  no  monthly  payment  required,  no  past  due
balance and the last reported payment in February 2023. (GE 6 at 7; AE D; Tr. 80-84)
Applicant said that he communicated  periodically with his student loan creditors
and that his loans were deferred or in forbearance for a number of years. As his income
increased,  he  focused  on  supporting  his  family,  including  his  wife’s  education.  He
acknowledged that he had not given sufficient attention to resolving his delinquent student
loans. He said that he had negotiated a consolidated student loan payment of “about $284
a month, but, then the federal government put student loan payments on hiatus because
of  the  coronavirus  pandemic.”  (Tr.  57,  82-86;  AE  A)  He  submitted  evidence  that  a
standard repayment plan for his student loan debt required monthly payments of $227 for
a period of up to 30 years. (AE K) He stated that he had recently contacted his student
loan servicer, that they anticipated payments may restart as soon as September 2023,
and that he was ready and able to pay required monthly payments. (Answer; Tr. 57, 68)
He also submitted evidence that he filed for student loan forgiveness under the Borrower
Protection  Act  in  June  2022  because  the  school  he  attended  from  2004  to  2006  was
deceptive about the transferability of credits earned, misrepresented job placement rates,
and did not provide job placement support. (AE A, C; Tr. 29-30) These debts are being
resolved.  (AE A; Tr. 40-60, 67-68, 73-88, 92)
SOR ¶  1.k:  credit card in collection for $219. Applicant denied the allegation in
his Answer, noting that he had paid this debt and that it was no longer listed in his credit
report. He submitted evidence the account was resolved on or before April 24, 2023. (AE
E-F; Tr. 66-67) Credit reports dated May 2019 and March 2020 show the loan as past
due and in collection for $219. (GE 3-4) Credit reports dated November 2021 and April
2023 do not list this debt. (GE 5-6) This debt is resolved.
SOR  ¶   1.l:  telecommunications   account   in  collection  for   $2,389.   Applicant
admitted that he “may be in debt” for this account, stating that he believed it was over a
decade  old,  no  longer  valid,  and  that  he  disputed  the  account  balance.  (Answer).  He
attributed the debt to his change of cell phone carriers, said that he repeatedly requested
an itemized bill from the first carrier  to submit to  the second carrier for payment  under
terms of his contract with that carrier, but that the first carrier failed to provide an itemized
bill and rejected his offers to resolve the account for a lesser amount. He said the creditor
would only discuss the debt over the phone and would not send emails or an itemized
bill. He stated that he had communicated with the listed creditor on multiple occasions
since 2018 but that they recently informed him that they no longer owned the debt. He
testified that he contacted the original creditor prior to the hearing and was told that their
database did not reflect an account in his name, “but if [they] found anything, [they] would
send [him] a letter.” (Tr. 65) Applicant stated his willingness to pay the debt, said that he
would continue to try to resolve the debt, and stated his belief that any actual debt was
more than $1,000 less than alleged. A credit report from May 2019 shows the account as
past  due  and  in  collection  for  $2,389.  (GE  3  at  14)  Credit  reports  from  March  2020,
November 2021 and April 2023 do not list this debt. (GE 4-6; Tr. 64-66)
SOR ¶¶  1.m-1.n: telecommunications  accounts  in collection for $94  and $50.
Applicant denied these allegations, stating that he had recently paid off one of the debts;
that the creditor alleged in the SOR for the other debt was unable to find his account; and
that both debts were no longer listed on his credit report. (Answer; AE F; Tr. 63-64) A May
2019  credit  report  shows  both accounts  in  collection.  (GE  3  at  15) Credit  reports  from
March 2020, November 2021, and April 2023 do not list these debts. (GE 4-6) The debts
alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.m-1.n were for different accounts with different companies owned by
the same parent company. Applicant said that he contacted the original creditor for the
debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.m and was told that there was no record of that debt, but that he
was past-due $50 on a different account.  He submitted evidence that he paid the debt
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.n in April 2023. (Answer; AE F-G; Tr. 63-64)
Applicant testified that he filed for bankruptcy in about 2004 after he left the Army.
He stated that he received credit counselling during those bankruptcy proceedings, and
before purchasing a home in September 2021. (Tr. 88-90) His gross annual income has
steadily increased and is now $126,600. (AE P; Tr. 36-38). His wife works full time and
earns about $90,000 a year.  (AE Q; Tr 36) His monthly mortgage payment was about
$2,612 in late 2021 and has increased to $3,370. (GE 5 at 4; GE 6 at 4; AE R; Tr. 36) His
family’s  written  financial  budget  shows  a  remainder  of  $1,865  a  month  after  monthly
expenses.  (AE  R)  He  has  about  $900  in  his  checking  account  and  did  not  know  the
balance of joint accounts managed by his wife. His wife has two investment accounts with
balances totaling about $194,000. (AE M-N)
Applicant  submitted  letters  of  recommendation  and  emails  that  favorably
commented on his integrity, compliance with rules, performance, character, leadership,
diligence, dedication to duty, professionalism, and judgment. (AE S-T)
I  found  Applicant's  responses  and  demeanor  at  the  hearing  to  be  credible  and
consistent with his SCA, Answer, and someone who was reliably telling the truth. After
reviewing  the  entire  record,  I  find  that  his  hearing  testimony  is  corroborated  by
documentary evidence submitted by the  government and his own exhibits. He credibly
responded to all questions and was keenly aware of the significance of resolving his debts
and establishing his financial responsibility.
