Applicant  is  a  56-year-old  senior  system  administrator  employed  by  a  defense
contractor  since  February  2019.  She  has  worked  in  information  technology  (IT)  since
2000.  She  owned  and  operated,  part-time,  a  computer  consulting and  repair  business
from 2009 through 2017. She has held an interim secret security clearance since about
2019. (GE 1-2; AE F-K; Tr.48-49, 111-113)
Applicant  received   bachelor’s  and   master’s  degrees   in  1989   and   2011,
respectively. She was married from  August 1989  to  August 1991  and  from  May 1996  to
August 2008,  both  marriages ended  in divorce. She  has a  son, age  24.  (GE 1-2;  Tr. 90-
91, 105-106)
The SOR alleges that from April 2009 to June 2018, Applicant was fired from five
jobs  for various  reasons.  She admitted  all SOR  allegations  with  explanation.  (Answer)
She reported four involuntary terminations in her September 2019 SCA, and voluntarily
disclosed and discussed all five firings during interviews with a government investigator
in October and November 2019. (GE 1-2)
In   April  2009,   Applicant  was   fired   from   her   position   as  IT   manager  for  a   firm
following  an  emotional  episode  that  led  to  a  three-day  psychiatric hospitalization. (SOR  ¶
1.e) She  admitted  that she  was  terminated  after spending  three  days  in the  hospital,  but
denied  that she  had a mental episode.  (Answer  at 3-4; GE 1  at 23-24, GE 2  at 3; Tr. 85)
She   said  that  she   voluntarily  admitted   herself  into   the   hospital  so   that  her  medication
could be  adjusted. She  had  been  under a  doctor’s care for anxiety,  depression, and  stress
because  of long-standing  mental, emotional, and  verbal abuse  by  her former spouse  that
continued  after  their  August  2008  divorce.  During  her son’s  first extended  visitation  with
her ex-husband,  who  was then  living  with  her mother, she  overheard  her mother tell  her
son  to  say that  he  didn’t “want to  talk to  [Applicant]  again and  then  hang  that phone  up.”
(Answer at 4)  In  her Answer she  explained,
Because  of my  anxiety  and  lack of  sleep, I stupidly made  a  comment to  a
friend of mine that I should kill [my ex-husband]  and then  myself. I was just
blowing   off   steam   to   a   friend   [co-worker],  but  she   took  me   seriously  and
contacted  my supervisor  [he] called  me  into  his office and  asked  me  to  let
him  take  me  to  the  hospital [because  he]  wanted  me  to  see  my doctor about
adjusting  my medication.
Her supervisor was aware of her personal circumstances and was concerned that
she was suicidal. (Tr. 27) She was fired several days later. She worked for the firm for
almost  nine  years  and  had  received  positive  reviews  through  2008.  She  testified
consistently  with  earlier  statements  and  provided  detail  about  her  tumultuous  family
relationships. (Answer; GE 1 at 23-24, GE 2 at 8, 10; Tr. 24-28, 85-88)
In October 2010, Applicant was fired  from  her position  as a  computer technician
for  threatening   an   employee.  (SOR  ¶   1.d)   She   admitted   that   she   was  terminated,   but
denied  that she  had  threatened  anyone. (Answer at 3; GE  1  at 22-23, GE  2  at 7-8; Tr. 31-
32, 82-83) She said that three  male  co-workers, all about 20 years younger than her,  did
not  like   her,  belittled   her  education,  and   generally  harassed   her.  She   reported   their
harassment  to  their  mutual supervisor, but no  action  was  taken. She  said that a  co-worker
then  falsely  reported  that she  had  refused to give him a  file that he needed.  She  told her
co-worker that if he  did not leave  her alone  she  was going  to  file harassment charges
against  him   and   her   other  two   co-workers.  A   week  later,  she   was  terminated   for
threatening an employee. (Answer; GE 1-2; Tr. 28-32, 82-85)
In February 2015, she was fired from her position as an IT specialist and project
manager  for  insubordination.  (SOR  ¶  1.c)  She  admitted  that  she  was  terminated,  but
denied that she had been insubordinate. (Answer at 2; GE 1 at 19-20, GE 2 at 6-7; Tr.
35-36,  79-80)  She  supported  widely  dispersed  offices  and  directly  reported  to  two
supervisors, the general manager at her site and a company executive in another country.
A company executive at a third site was displeased because Applicant had not personally
set up their new computers and had not agreed to personally provide on-site support. She
said that her supervisor had directed her to contract for local computer support for that
site  because  it  would  be  more  cost-effective.  A  recruiter  and  former  general  manager
noted that her unclear supervisory chain caused problems because she often  received
conflicting directives from different managers. He also said that the real reason she was
fired was because of a downturn in business. He said that Applicant was professional,
efficient, knowledgeable, and that his interactions with her were always positive. (Answer
at 2; GE 1 at 19-20, GE 2 at 6-7; AE A; Tr. 32-36, 79-82)
In  June  2015,  Applicant  was  fired  from  her  position  as  change  manager  for
falsifying her resume. (SOR ¶ 1.b) She admitted that she was fired after working for the
company for less than a month because she had embellished her resume by adding the
key words “change management” to her two previous job experiences. She said that she
had done so at the request of a recruiter for the position. She admitted that it was wrong
to do so, and said that she has not, and would not do it again. (Answer at 2; GE 2 at 6;
Tr. 36-37, 72-75, 119-120) She did not list this employment in her September 2019 SCA.
In  October  2019,  she  voluntarily  disclosed  details  of  this  position,  including  her
termination to a government investigator, and said that she had not reported the job in
her SCA because she thought the period of employment was too short. (GE 1, GE 2 at 6;
Tr. 75-79, 110-111)
In June 2018, Applicant was fired from her position as an IT support technician for
lack of improvement after being placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP), and
for  improperly  emailing   a   software   license   key  and   not  informing   her  supervisor  of   a
possible  software activation  issue. (SOR  ¶  1.a)  She  admitted  that she  was placed  on  a
PIP  and  later terminated,  but  denied  that  she  emailed  a  software  license  key,  stating  that
she  had  provided  an  activation  key to  a  company executive  while he  was being  assisted
by another computer technician.  (Answer at 1-2; GE  1  at 16-17, GE  2  at 5;  Tr. 37-41, 67-
72, 106-108)
Applicant worked for the company from January 2017 to June 2018 and said that
before being placed on a PIP she had received favorable feedback and had applied for a
promotion. (GE 1-3; Tr. 37-38, 88-89) On February 5, 2023, she applied for the IT Director
position and said that she believed that the PIP was issued because of that application.
(AE  B-C;  Tr.  39,  42)  On  February  23,  2018,  she  received  a  disciplinary  notice  citing
deficiencies in her performance as IT Operations Manager over the preceding 18 months
and received a written PIP. (GE 3; AE D; Tr. 39-41) Applicant said that after issuing the
PIP,  the  “Acting  Director of  IT  constantly f[ound]  fault  in everything  that  [she]  did”, that
she “went to work every day on pins and needles just waiting to see what they were going
to  say I did wrong”, and that she was constantly belittled. (GE 1 at 17; Tr. 38, 70) She
was so affected by that treatment that she took two weeks of leave on the advice of her
counselor. (Tr. 39-40) On  March 7, 2018, she received another disciplinary notice that
described performance issues including inappropriate comments regarding the PIP, poor
judgment, lack of improvement in her performance, and informed her that she was being
demoted  to  IT  technical  support  technician.  (GE  3  at  4;  AE  D)  Her  response  noted
concerns about communications and training and said that she felt as if she was working
in a hostile environment after her supervisor told her that she “was poison.” (GE 3 at 5)
She received a third disciplinary notice dated June 11, 2018, terminating her employment
for the reasons alleged in the SOR. (GE 1-3; AE B-D; Tr. 37-42, 59-72, 88-89)
After being fired in June 2018, Applicant drank alcohol occasionally to deal with
her termination and anger issues. She said that she was not an alcoholic but used alcohol
to cope with stressors in her life including anger towards her mother and ex-husband for
abuse  that  continued until his  death  in  2015.  In  September 2018, she  entered  a  faith-
based  alcohol  and  drug  recovery  program  and  completed  the  residential  program  in
November 2018. She received extensive counseling, therapy, and mentoring. She also
completed courses in anger management, parenting and coping skills.  She started her
current job while residing in a graduate dormitory, where she lived until May 2019. She
said that she did not consume alcoholic beverages from July 2018 to September 2022,
and has occasionally consumed 1-2 beers at social events since. She occasionally takes
medication for anxiety and depression in accordance with a prescription. (GE 1 at 48-49,
GE 2 at 11; AE M-P: Tr. 43-59, 89, 92-103)
Program  counselors  wrote  very  positive  letters  noting  that  Applicant  was  an
“excellent  client,  sincere  about  the  program,  and  her  recovery,”  “determined  to  heal,
overcome, and  learn from  her emotional scars,”  ”excelled  as a  graduate, “continued  to
attend  all  her  classes  and  meetings,”  “worked  diligently  with  her  counselor  on
understanding the underlying root causes of her struggles,” “focused on learning how to
set boundaries,” “eager to learn and gain understanding”, that she remains in contact with
program staff, and that they are “extremely impressed by all that she has accomplished”
and “will be an asset wherever she goes.” (AE M, O)
Applicant said that she no longer has the same stressors in her life and that since
starting  her current  job  in February 2019, she  has focused  on  her work, established  an
excellent  reputation  and sound  record of  performance.  (Tr. 45-51, 120;  AE  E-L)  She  is
recognized  for her  willingness and  ability to  help others, dedication,  ability to  successfully
balance  priorities, and  contributions to  an  outstanding  cyber-readiness inspection. (AE  E-
G) She  submitted  letters of recommendation  from  her division  manager, site  supervisor,
command  operations  officer and  a  supporting  contractor that comment favorably  on  her
judgment,   reliability,  trustworthiness,  performance,  expertise,   mentorship,   security
awareness, and what a pleasure it is to work with her. (AE H-K) She received  awards for
excellence and performance in March  and  August 2022. (AE L)
