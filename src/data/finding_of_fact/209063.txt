In  September  2021,  Department  Counsel  provided  Applicant  a  copy  of  the
documents it intended to submit at a future security clearance hearing in support of the
listed allegations of the SOR. On July 14, 2022, Department Counsel sent Applicant a
second  copy of  the documents  in  anticipation  of the  hearing  that was  originally set for
August 1, 2022. Department Counsel resent a hard copy of the documents on May 25,
2023  for  the  June  2023  hearing.  In  the  three  documentary  submissions,  Department
Counsel advised Applicant to bring the SOR and the documents for reference during to
the scheduled hearings. She did not respond to two Case Management Orders (CMOs),
which  were  issued  on  July  13,  2022,  and  May  10,  2023.  (Tr.  29-30)  Applicant  did  not
have a hard copy of the exhibits in-hand at the June 2023 hearing.
At the  beginning  of  the  June  2023  hearing  to  determine  whether  Applicant was
qualified   to   represent   herself,  she   explained   that  the   proposed   Government  exhibits
were stored  in  her cell phone, but she  did  not have a  hard  copy of the  proposed exhibits
for  the   hearing.   I  asked   her  several  questions  concerning   her  educational  and
professional background.  I  concluded  that she  was qualified  to  represent  herself. (Tr. 6-
13)  Because  Applicant  did not have  a  hard copy of the  proposed  Government exhibits
in-hand, I  described  the  essential  portions of  each  exhibit to  her. Initially, she  could  not
recall  her  July 2020  security clearance  application  (GE  1)  or her August 2020  PSIs  (GE
2), but after I read  the  contents of parts of the  exhibits  to  her, she  remembered  and did
not  object  to   the   exhibits   being   admitted   into   evidence.  She   objected   to   the   credit
bureau  reports (CBRs)  at  GE  3  and  GE  4  because  they  were  dated. She  believed  that
an  updated  CBR  should  be  entered  into  evidence. I informed  her of  her responsibility  in
proving  her case  to  submit  an  updated  credit  report. I then  stated  to  her that though  GE
3 and  4  were  dated, the  age  of  the  reports did  not preclude  their  admissibility.  The  four
exhibits were admitted  into evidence. (Tr. 17-24)
There are 14 delinquent accounts alleged in the June 2021 SOR. The accounts
include  an  installment  loan  for  a  repossessed  car,  student  loan  accounts,  medical
accounts,  and  utility  accounts  The  total  amount  of  debt  is  about  $37,524.  The  debts
became delinquent between July 2014 and July 2020. Applicant admitted that she owed
all  the  debts  except  for  the  accounts  identified  at  SOR  ¶¶  1.b,  1.d,  1.k,  1.m,  and  1.n.
The Government credit bureau reports confirm the existence of the delinquent accounts.
(GE 3, 4; Answer to SOR)
Applicant is 29  years old  and single. Her son  was born in December 2020. (Tr.
46) She  earned  some  community college  credits between  August 2015  and  April 2017,
but  received   no   degree.  (GE   1   at   12-13)   Since   February   2019,   Applicant  has   been
employed  as  a  protective security officer.  From  December  2018  to  February 2019,  she
was  unemployed.  From   August   2018   to   December  2018,  she   worked   as   a   security
officer. She  was unemployed  for  a  month  in July 2018. From  June  2018  to  July 2018,
Applicant was a  pharmacy technician, but resigned  before she  completed  training. She
worked   as   a   security officer  during  the   month   of  May 2018.  (GE  1   at   12-18)   Applicant
has never been investigated  for a security  clearance. (GE 1 at 30)
In  Applicant’s  August  2020  PSIs,  the  OPM  investigator  asked  her  about  her
delinquent debts listed in the SOR. After conveying her knowledge about the  status of
most  of  the  debts,  her  uniform  explanation  for  why  the  listed  accounts  became
delinquent was that she was young, she did not earn a sufficient amount of money, she
did not understand debts, and did not comprehend how bad credit would affect her later
in life. (GE 2 at 4-5)
SOR ¶  1.a  – This is an installment loan account for a car that was charged off
in July 2016 (AE 3 at 6), and repossessed in October 2017. She made no payments on
the car after it was repossessed. (Tr. 31-33) Applicant was waiting until after the sale of
the auto to determine how much she may owe. (GE 2 at 5)  The account has not been
resolved.
SOR ¶  1.b  – This is student loan account that Applicant’s stepfather opened at
a federal credit union. Applicant explained in her August 2020 PSIs that her stepfather
cosigned  for  the  loan  and  was  supposed  to  pay  the  account  for  her.  However,  when
Applicant’s mother divorced the stepfather, he decided not to repay the loan. As maker
of  the  account,  Applicant  is  still  primarily  responsible  for  the  loan,  with  the  cosigner
becoming  liable  when  the  maker  defaulted.  (GE  3  at  5)  Applicant  claimed  the  posted
amount was incorrect. At the conclusion of the hearing, she promised to investigate the
status of the account and make a payment. No additional documentation was provided.
SOR  ¶¶   1.c,   1.e,   1.f,   1.g   –  These  four  student  loan  accounts  were  opened
between September 2014 and January 2017. The accounts became delinquent in July
2017.  (GE  4  at  4-5)  Applicant  claimed  the  accounts  had  been  consolidated  into  one
account  and  were  being  paid  through  garnishment.  The  Government  was  garnishing
15% of her wages. Applicant could not remember when the garnishment started, but the
accounts have been in forbearance due to the imposition of the Government pause on
repayment  of  student  loans  that  commenced  in  March  2020.  (Tr.  35-38)  Because
Applicant’s  student  loan  accounts  were  delinquent  for  about  three  years  before  the
Government pause in March 2020, her delinquent student loan accounts (SOR ¶¶ 1.c,
1.e,  1.f,  and  1.g)  cannot  be  considered  in  a  current  status  based  on  the  Government
temporary suspension of loan repayments. The student loan account is not resolved.
SOR 1.d  –  This account was transferred to a collection agency by the original
creditor,  a  phone  company.  The  account  became  delinquent  in  July  2019.  Applicant
claims that someone opened this account by fraudulently using her name. She claimed
that  she  contacted  the  original  creditor  in  August  2018,  and  does  not  understand  why
the debt still appears in her credit report. The account is unpaid.
Applicant also claimed that she had enrolled in a debt consolidation firm about
a year ago and was making $100 a month in payments to the firm. Applicant offered to
provide  documentation  of  her  agreement.  (GE  2  at  6;  Tr.  40)  With  no  documentation
showing enrollment or monthly payments to the company, her claims are not credible.
SOR ¶  1.h  – Applicant could not identify this account, but claimed that her debt
consolidation firm was working to pay off this account. The account became delinquent
in July 2019. (GE 2 at 7; Tr. 42) With no evidence from Applicant’s firm supporting her
claim, the account is still unpaid.
SOR  ¶   1.i  –   This  is  a  medical  account  that  Applicant’s  hospital  billed  her
instead  of  her  insurance  company.  Appellant  intended  to  investigate  the  account  and
pay once she determined whom to pay. She testified that she had not paid the account.
(GE 2 at 7; Tr. 42) The account has not been satisfied.
SOR  1.j   –   This  is  a  medical  account  that  has  not  been  paid.  The  account
became delinquent in July 2020. (GE 3 at 8; Tr. 43)
SOR  ¶   1.k  –   This  is  a  gas  utility  account  belonging  to  Applicant  during  her
enrollment  in  college.  The  account  became  delinquent  in  June  2017.  (GE  3  at  8)  In
August  2020,  she  did  not  know  the  account  was  delinquent.  (GE  2  at  7)  She  testified
without documentary support that she paid the account. (Tr. 43-44) The account has not
been resolved.
SOR  ¶   1.l  –  This  is  a  medical  account  that  became  delinquent  in  November
2019.  (GE  3  at  9)  Though  she  admitted  the account  in  her  July  2021  response  to  the
SOR, she was unable to identify the debt at the June 2023 hearing. (Tr. 48-49) The debt
has not been paid.
SOR ¶  1.m – This electric utility account became delinquent in April 2019. (GE
3  at  8)  Applicant  was  sure  that  she  paid  this  account.  (Tr.  43-44)  As  with  the  other
delinquent accounts  listed in the SOR, Applicant produced no evidence to confirm this
account has been paid.
SOR  ¶   1.n  –   This medical  account  became delinquent  in  February  2016.  The
Government  documentation  establishes  that  this  account  was  satisfied  in  February
2021. (Item 4 at 2) The account is resolved.
After  discussing  her  delinquent  debts  during  her  August  2020  PSIs,  Applicant
considered  herself  in  a  better  financial  position.  She  promised  to  pay  all  her  debts  as
soon as possible. She indicated that she was disputing two of the delinquent accounts,
but she could not remember which ones. The investigator asked her to supply additional
documentation concerning her delinquent debts, but she never did. (GE 2 at 10-11)
During  the  hearing,  Department  Counsel  asked  Applicant  when  she  believed
her  financial  problems  began.  She  replied  that  the  troubles  emerged  while  she  was
attending school in another state. Her August 2020 PSIs indicate that she was enrolled
at  out-of-state  schools  from  August  2015  to  April  2017.  (Tr.  57;  GE  2  at  4)  Applicant
also noted she was off work for a year after the birth of her son. She paid $960 a month
for  her  son’s  day  care  until  January  or  February  2023,  when  she  and  her  former
boyfriend (her son’s father) began evenly dividing the cost of her son’s monthly daycare
expenses.  (Tr.  52-54)  She  mentioned  helping  her  mother  in  unidentified  ways  and
assisting her siblings. (Tr. 57)
During the hearing, Applicant was reminded several times to submit documents
to bolster her claims  of addressing the listed debts or enrolling in a debt consolidation
plan,  but  no  documents  were  furnished.  She  did  not  bring  a  copy  of  the  Government
exhibits  to  the  hearing  because  she  had  never  faced  a  security  clearance  hearing
before. (Tr. 63) She agreed to submit a budget describing her income an expenses, but
no budgetary information was submitted. (Tr. 50, 55)
