and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  testimony,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.

Personal Conduct
1.a., 2.a. and 3.a. In about October of 2017, more than five years ago  while on
active duty with the Marine Corps, Applicant attempted to record and take photos of a
female sailor, while she was changing her clothes in a changing room. This attempt was
done  without  her  knowledge  or  consent.  (TR  at  page  18  line  2  to  page  29  line  17,  at
page 35 lines 19~23, and at page 37 lines 14~22.) As a result, Applicant was convicted
at  a  Summary  Court-Martial  (SCM)  for  Attempt  to  record  and  take  pictures  of  a  Naval
member of the Armed Forces without consent.  As a result of this conviction, Applicant
was  reduced  in  rank  from  a  Lance  Corporal  (E-3)  to  a  Private  First  Class  (E-2),  and
discharged in about  December of 2019 with an Other Than Honorable Discharge. (TR
at  page  45  line  8  to  page  49  line  3,  and  GXs  5  and  6.)  Applicant’s  wife,  who  was  his
girlfriend in 2017, is aware of Applicant’s criminal conduct.
