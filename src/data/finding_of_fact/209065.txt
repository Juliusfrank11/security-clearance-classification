After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  the  Government’s
exhibits, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 48 years old and has been married since August 2003. He has four
adult  children  and  one  adult  stepchild.  His  three  oldest  children  are  from  previous
relationships.  None  of  those  three  children  live  with  him.  He  was awarded  his GED in
1992 or 1993 and has some college credits. He reported recent periods of unemployment
from  May  to  July  2018  and  from  March  to  July  2020.  Since  July  2020,  he  has  been
employed by a defense contractor. (Items 2 and 3.)
Under  Guideline  F,  the  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  has:  (1)  two  child  support
accounts in collection totaling $30,910 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and e); (2) four federal student loans
in  collection totaling $19,273  (SOR ¶¶ 1.c, d, f, and  g); (3)  three delinquent consumer
accounts  totaling  $4,322  (SOR  ¶¶  1.b,h,  and  n),  and  (4)  eight  medical  accounts  in
collection totaling $3,857 (SOR ¶¶ 1.i –  m, o - q). The SOR debts total $58,362. (Item
1S.)
Applicant denied the two child support allegations ($30,910). He admitted the four
student loan allegations ($19,273). He denied one consumer account allegation ($684)
and admitted the other two allegations ($3,638). He denied the first six medical account
allegations ($3,683) and admitted the last two ($175). (Item 1A.)
During  his  November  2,  2020  personal  subject  interview  (PSI),  Applicant
discussed the child support allegations he denied. They were based on two court orders
for back child support. The three children he fathered outside of his marriage applied for
welfare and gave the child support agency his name as their father. The agency imposed
a garnishment of his wages. He could not recall when garnishment was imposed, but his
wages are still being garnished. He plans to find out the status of those accounts but has
no  reason  to  disagree  with  the  information  reported.  He  did  not  provide  documents
showing the current garnishment. (Item 3.)
On  the  August  8,  2020  credit  report,  the  $18,420  child  support  account  was
assigned  to  collection in  September 2018  and  is marked  CLOSED. The  $12,490  child
support  account  is  not  reported.  (Item  5.)  On  the  November  9,  2021  credit  report,  the
$12,490 account was opened in August 1995; the last payment ($856) and the first major
delinquency were in October 2021. The $18,420 account is not reported. The children are
now 28, 29, and 31 years old. (Items 2 and 4.)
During  his  PSI,  Applicant  also  discussed  the  medical  account  delinquencies  he
denied.  He  was  aware  that  some  of  his  medical  bills  went  into  collections.  He  has  a
medical condition that requires frequent medical care. Due to periods of unemployment
and  other  bills  to  pay,  he  got  behind  on  paying  medical  bills.  In  addition,  his  medical
insurance did not always pay its portion of the bills timely. Also, he was not always being
notified of all his bills. (Item 3.) His explanation about unemployment playing a role in his
medical  bill  delinquencies  is  consistent  with  the  record.  Seven  of  his  eight  medical
account  delinquencies  were  assigned  to  collection  just  before,  during,  or  just  after  his
2018 and 2020 periods of unemployment. (Items 4 and 5.)
During his PSI, Applicant discussed his federal student loans. He did not list them,
because the school he attended, ITT Technical Institute (ITT), was found to have been
operating  unethically  causing  students  to  accumulate  excessive  debt.  The  school  was
eventually  shut down, and he never received a degree.  On August 16, 2022,  the U.S.
Department of Education announced a $3.9 billion group discharge for 208,000 borrowers
who  attended  ITT  between  January  1,  2005,  and  its  closure  in  September  2016.  The
Department  found  that  ITT:  “[I]ntentionally  misled  students  about  the  quality  of  their
programs  in  order  to  profit  off  federal  student  loan  programs  with  no  regard  for  the
hardship this would cause . . . These borrowers will have the federal student loans they
received to attend ITT discharged without any additional action on their part.”

group-discharge-208000-borrowers-who-attended-itt-technical-institute
The  credit  reports  show  that  Applicant’s  federal  student  loans  were  opened
between November 2010 and April 2013. (Items 4 and 5,) They are, therefore, covered
by the Government’s discharge of ITT student loans.
The  Government’s credit reports support the  three  consumer debts ($4,322) (SOR
¶¶ 1.b, h, and  n). (Items 4 and  5.)
Law and Policies
It  is  well  established  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.  As  the
Supreme  Court  has  noted,  “the  clearly  consistent  standard  indicates  that  security
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.”  Department of the Navy
v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).
When   evaluating   an   applicant’s   suitability  for   a   security  clearance,   the
administrative judge  must consider the  adjudicative  guidelines. These  guidelines, which
are flexible  rules of law, apply together with  common  sense  and  the  general factors of the
whole-person  concept.  The  administrative  judge  must consider all  available and  reliable
information  about  the  person,  past and  present,  favorable and  unfavorable, in making  a
decision.  The   protection   of   the   national  security  is  the   paramount   consideration.   AG  ¶
2(b)  requires  that   “[a]ny  doubt  concerning   personnel  being   considered   for  national
security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.”
Under Directive ¶  E3.1.14, the  Government must present evidence  to  establish
controverted   facts   alleged   in   the   SOR.   Under  Directive   ¶   E3.1.15,   the   applicant   is
responsible  for presenting  “witnesses and  other evidence  to  rebut,  explain, extenuate, or
mitigate  facts admitted  by applicant or proven  by Department Counsel. . . .” The  applicant
has the  ultimate  burden of persuasion in seeking a  favorable security decision.
