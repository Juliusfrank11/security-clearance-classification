Applicant is a 46-year-old program  integrator employed by a defense  contractor
since April 2020. She was employed by several contractors that supported the same DOD
client from January 2011 to April 2020, and she worked for other federal contractors from
November  2005  to  February  2010.  She  worked  as  an  insurance  agent  from  February
2010 to January 2011, and was unemployed from May 2005 to July 2005. She has held
a security clearance since 2009. (GE 1; Tr. 31-32, 58)
Applicant earned a bachelor’s degree in 2013. She was married from July 1995 to
August 2002, January 2004 to June 2005, and May 2006 to May 2017,  each marriage
ended in divorce. She has three children, ages 26, 24, and 20. (GE 1; Tr. 29-31, 52, 58)
The  SOR alleges  eight  delinquent  accounts totaling  $22,251.  (SOR ¶¶  1.a  through
1.h) In  her Answer to the SOR,  Applicant  denied  all SOR allegations with explanation.
In her June 2020 SCA, Applicant disclosed that she had been delinquent on her
mortgage from June 2017 to June 2018. (GE 1 at 45-46) She said that she first learned
about some of the SOR debts during her security clearance background investigation and
that  she  then  tried  to  resolve  those  debts.  (Answer;  Tr.  at  60-61)  She  attributed  her
financial  problems  to  her former  husband’s  gambling problems, his unemployment, his
depletion of their bank accounts, and their 2017 divorce. (GE 1 at 46; Tr. 29-30, 55-57)
The evidence concerning the specific SOR allegations is summarized below.
SOR  ¶   1.a:  credit  card  collection  account   for  $9,413.   Applicant  denied   the
allegation.  (Answer)   She  stated   that  she   had   entered   a   payment  agreement  with   the
creditor  that  required   monthly  payments  of   $229.59   until  July  2024,  that   the   account
balance  had  been  reduced  to  $6,887, and  she  submitted  a  receipt  for  a  $229.59  payment
in  December  2021.  (Answer   at  1,  3,  attachment   A)   She   testified   that   her   debt  was
originally  over  $11,000,  that  she   had  made   every  monthly  payment  required   by  the
payment  plan  and  would  fully resolve the  account after several more payments. She  said
that she would submit documentary evidence of her payments but did not do so.  (Tr. 28-
29,   32-33,   70-71)   Credit  reports  from   July  2020,   April  2021,   and   July  2022   show  the
account as in collection  with  declining  past due  balances of $11,020,  $9,413, and  $5,740,
respectively. (GE 3 at 5, GE 4 at 2, GE 5 at 14) A June 2023 credit report does not list
this account. This debt is resolved or is being resolved.
SOR  ¶   1.b:   credit  account   charged  off  for  $1,530.  Applicant  denied  the
allegation  and  stated  that  she  had  made  payments  in  accordance  with  a  payment
agreement.  (Answer  at  2-3)  She  submitted  evidence  that  she  had  entered  a  payment
agreement in August 2020, that the account balance was $669.48 as of December 27,
2021, and that she had authorized the company to debit her bank account for the January
2022  payment.  (Answer  at attachment B) She testified  that she  had made  all required
monthly payments under the payment plan and had almost paid off the debt. (Tr. 33-35,
71-72) Credit reports from July 2020, April 2021, and July 2022 show the account had
been  charged  off  for  $2,295  with  declining  past  due  balances  of  $2,295,  $1,530,  and
$191, respectively. (GE 3 at 5, GE 4 at 2, GE 5 at 14) A June 2023 credit report shows
the charge off was paid in full. This debt is resolved.
SOR  ¶¶   1.c,  1.d,  and   1.g:  medical   collection  accounts   for   $306,  $146,  and
$1,300.  Applicant denied the allegations and said that she had paid each account in full.
(Answer  at  2-3)  She  testified  that  she  had  paid  the  medical  debts  and  would  submit
documentary evidence but did not do so. (Tr. 35, 40-41, 72, 75-77) An April 2021 credit
report shows the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d accounts as in collection. (GE 4 at
2-3) An April 2020 credit report shows the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g as in collection. (GE
5 at 14) A credit report from July 2022 shows the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d in collection
and two other delinquent medical accounts in collection for $150 and $135. (GE 3 at 2) A
credit report from June 2023 does not reflect any delinquent medical accounts. (GE 2) I
find Applicant’s testimony credible and that the credit reports corroborate it. These debts
are resolved.
SOR  ¶   1.e:  credit  account   charged  off  for  $1,141.   Applicant  denied  the
allegation and said that she disputed the account because the company refused to honor
a warranty for furniture that broke shortly after purchase. (Answer; Tr. 35-37, 73-74) She
said that she would pay the debt if necessary to protect her job, but that she had not and
did not want to pay the debt. (Tr. 36-37, 73) Credit reports from July 2020 and April 2021
show the account was charged off with a past due balance of $1,141, and the 2021 report
reflects Applicant disputed the account. (GE 4 at 12, GE 5 at 14) Credit reports from July
2022 and June 2023 show an account dispute was resolved and $0 balance due. (GE 2
at 14, GE 3 at 14) This debt is resolved.
SOR  ¶   1.f:  mortgage   account   past-due  for  $7,975.  Applicant  denied   the
allegation.  (Answer)  She  said that  she  paid  the  mortgage  in  full  when  she  sold  her house
in August 2021  and  submitted  a  settlement statement dated  August 6, 2021. (Answer at
1, attachment  F) She  testified  that she  had missed  several mortgage  payments  after her
divorce  and  while trying  to  straighten  out her finances. She  said that  she  sold her home
to  pay off  the  mortgage  and  some  other debts, and  that it took some  time  because  she
was financially responsible  for her children  at  that  time. (Tr. 25-26, 37-40, 54, 66-67, 74-
75) An  April 2021  credit report  shows the  account as past due  in the  amount of $7,975
with  a  total mortgage  balance  of $146,791,  and  that foreclosure proceedings  had  been
initiated. (GE 4 at 3) Credit reports from July 2022 and June 2023 show that the mortgage
was paid in full in July 2021, and that the debt was resolved. (GE 2 at 15, GE 3 at 11)
SOR ¶  1.h: collection account  for $440.  Applicant denied the allegation and said
that the debt had been paid. (Answer; Tr. 28-29, 76-78) She submitted evidence this debt
was resolved in August 2020. (Answer at attachment H) This debt is resolved.
Applicant’s income  has increased,  and  her financial situation  has  improved.  Her
gross annual salary was about $68,000  in 2016, ranged  from  $77,000  to  $93,000  over
the  next several years,  was $125,000  in  April  2020,  and  is currently  $132,000. She  said
that  she  has  a  remainder of  about $2,500  a  month  after expenses. She  has  about  $6,300
in the  bank, $5,000  in stocks, $45,000  in a  retirement account, and  about $1,000  in  stock
options.  She   has  rented   a   house   since   selling   her  own  home.   She   purchased   a   2013
model-year vehicle  for her daughter,  and  a  2018  model-year vehicle  for herself. (Tr. 25-
26, 42-52, 58-59, 66-69, 75; GE 2-5)
Applicant has not received financial counseling.  She said that she has a written
budget  but  did  not  submit  a  copy.  During  the  hearing  I  informed  Applicant  of  the
importance of documentary evidence of debt payments, contact with creditors, and efforts
to resolve or otherwise address delinquent debts. (Tr. 22-26, 62-85)
I  found  Applicant’s  responses  and  demeanor  at  the  hearing  to  be  credible  and
consistent with someone who was reliably telling the truth. I also found her explanation
that  a  debt  not  alleged  in  the  SOR  but  reported  as  charged  off  and  then  paid  off  was
attributable to an online  company’s  delayed  retrieval of  a  trade-in vehicle credible. (Tr.
26-28; GE 2 at 13, GE 3 at 6) After reviewing the entire record, I find that her hearing
testimony is largely corroborated by documentary evidence submitted by the government
and evidence that she submitted with her Answer. She credibly responded to all questions
and was keenly aware of the significance of resolving her debts.
