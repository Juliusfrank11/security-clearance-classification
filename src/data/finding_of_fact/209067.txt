Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations in her Answer. She is 53 years old. She
married in 2001 and has been widowed since September 2017. She has a 28-year-old
stepchild.  She  previously  owned  a  home  that  she  purchased  in  July  2006  and  sold  in
October 2018, as further discussed below. Since then, she has rented her residence. (Tr.
at 22, 24, 32-36, 79; GE 1; AE A)
Applicant graduated from high school in 1988. She attended college but did not
earn a degree. She has worked for various DOD contractors since approximately 1995.
She was unemployed during the following periods: (1) from January to October 2010, due
to a layoff; (2) from March 2011 to September 2011, after her contract expired; (3) from
November 2013 to February 2014, at the conclusion of a temporary contract; and (4) from
August  2014  to  November  2014,  at  the  conclusion  of  a  temporary  contract.  She  has
worked as an auditor since July 2021. She has received numerous certifications. She was
first granted a security clearance in approximately 1995. (Tr. at 6-9, 18-20, 23-24, 64-66,
68-72, 103-106, 114-115; GE 1; AE M, N, O)
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  had  five  delinquent  consumer  debts,  totaling
approximately $102,023 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d, 1.f); a $105 delinquent medical debt (SOR  ¶
1.e); and delinquent state taxes of $4,449 for tax year (TY) 2010 (SOR ¶ 1.g). The SOR
allegations are established by Applicant’s admissions in her Answer; her October 2019
security  clearance  application  (SCA);  her  April  2020  background  interview;  and  credit
bureau reports from February 2020, April 2021, January 2022, and June 2022. (GE 1-6;
AE A, C)
Applicant  attributed   her   financial  difficulties   to   her   spouse’s  six-month   period   of
unemployment   while  he   was   in   between   contracts,   followed   by   his  sudden   death   in
September 2017. Prior  to  his unemployment,  he  earned  approximately $15,000  monthly
as  an   independent   contractor   for   DOD,  and   he  was   responsible   for   the   larger  of   their
household   expenses   while   she   handled   the   smaller   ones.  During   his   period   of
unemployment,  they exhausted  their  savings  and  obtained  the  credit card in SOR ¶  1.a
and  the  loans  in SOR ¶¶  1.b and  1.d  to meet  their financial obligations, with the intention
of repaying  them  once he  was re-employed.  (Tr. at 20-42, 48, 50-53, 72-77, 92-96, 106-
108, 113-114; GE 1-3;  AE H-J, HH)
After her spouse’s death, Applicant became solely responsible for their debt. She
mistakenly believed he was on her life insurance policy with her employer. She continued
to financially assist her stepchild. She timely paid her monthly mortgage of $4,148 for two
to three months. She voluntarily surrendered her car that she could no longer afford, as
further discussed  below. She retained the services of a debt resolution company in June
2018  and  entered  a  debt consolidation  plan,  for which  she  made  eight payments of $700
between  June  2018  and  September 2019,  so  that the  company could  negotiate  with  her
creditors and  settle  her  outstanding  debts.  She  sold her home  in October 2018, when  she
could no  longer afford to  pay her mortgage  and  was seven  to  eight  months delinquent.
She rented  a home for two years at $2,200  monthly.  She  elected to resolve her debts on
her own because  the  debt resolution  company took  too  long  to  settle  or pay  any of her
debts, and  she  withdrew from  the  company’s debt  reduction  program  in  September  2019.
She  lost  her father in February 2020, and  she  has since  helped  her siblings care for their
widowed   mother.   She   subsequently  rented   a   smaller  home   that   provided   a   shorter
commute  to  work and  her family.  (Tr. at  20-42, 48, 50-53,  72-79, 92-96, 106-108,  113-
114; GE  1-3; AE  H-J, HH)
SOR ¶ 1.a is a $25,231 charged-off credit card. Applicant used this card to pay
for  basic  living  expenses  when  her  spouse  was  unemployed  and  after  his  death.  She
made timely monthly payments of $300 toward this card until 2018, when she could no
longer afford to do so. She included this debt in her debt consolidation plan. After she
withdrew from the plan, she contacted the creditor and entered a payment arrangement
of $200 monthly to resolve this debt. She made a payment of $200 in April 2020. As of
the date of the hearing, she had been in settlement discussions with the creditor, and she
last made a payment of $200 in in August 2022. She stopped making payments because
she was tackling her smaller debts before her larger ones. She intends to settle and pay
this debt as she has the financial means to do so. (Tr. at 43, 47-53, 86-87, 108-113, 120;
GE 1-6; AE C, AA, HH)
SOR ¶ 1.b is a $12,438 charged-off personal loan. Applicant obtained this loan to
pay  her  expenses  when  her  spouse  was  unemployed.  She  made  timely  monthly
payments of $280 until 2018, when she could no longer afford to do so. She included this
debt in her debt consolidation plan, and the debt resolution company settled this debt for
$7,244. Upon contacting the creditor in April 2020, she learned that the debt  had been
transferred to a collection company. She entered a $100 monthly payment arrangement
with the collection company, and she paid $100 in April 2020, and two payments of $100
in  August  2022  and  September  2022.  As  of  the  date  of  the  hearing,  she  had  been  in
settlement discussions with the creditor. She stopped making payments because she was
addressing her smaller debts before her larger ones. She intends to settle and pay this
debt as she has the financial means to do so. (Tr. at 53-55, 87, 116-117, 120; GE 2-5;
AE C, Z, HH)
SOR ¶ 1.c is a $2,099 charged-off credit card. Applicant used this credit card for
miscellaneous items, such as gas,  to try to rebuild her credit. She settled this debt for
$1,410 in April 2020, payable through a payment arrangement of $1 due February 2019,
and then 18 payments of $74 monthly between March 2019 to September 2020. She has
not made any payments to date but she intends to pay this debt as she has the financial
means to do so. (Tr. at 43, 55-57, 87-88, 113-114; GE 2-6; AE C, BB, HH)
SOR ¶ 1.d concerns  a $1,317 personal loan in collection. Applicant obtained this
loan in March 2018 to help pay her expenses when her spouse was unemployed. She
made a $234 payment in May 2018,  and then she could no longer afford to repay it. She
negotiated a settlement with the creditor in February 2020 to make a one-time payment
of $4,700, and then monthly payments of $183, until she paid the outstanding balance.
She paid $970 in February 2019, seven payments of $182 to $183 between March 2019
and October 2019, and two payments of $2,179 and $2,400 in February 2020. She paid
this debt in July 2022. (Tr. at 57-58, 88-89, 117-119; GE 2-6; AE C, D, U)
SOR ¶ 1.e is a $105 collection account in related to medical treatment Applicant
received in the past. She was unaware of this debt until she received the SOR because
she believed it was covered by her health insurance. She paid $107 in April 2020 and
resolved this debt. (Tr. at 58-59, 89; GE 1, 2, 6; AE E)
SOR ¶ 1.f is a $60,938 balance due on Applicant’s repossessed car.  At the time
of  her  spouse’s  passing,  Applicant  drove  a  used  luxury  sedan  that  she  purchased  in
approximately  2015  or  2016,  for  which  she  paid  $738  monthly.  In  approximately
December 2017, she traded in her sedan and leased a used $90,000 luxury sports car.
She timely paid her monthly payments of $2,000 before voluntarily surrendering the car
to the dealership in December 2018, so that she could obtain a sedan. The dealership
would not let her out of her lease. She mistakenly believed that the lessor would forgive
the outstanding balance on her lease once the car was sold. She contacted the lessor in
April 2020 and entered a monthly payment arrangement of $200 for six months, at which
time the lessor would re-evaluate to determine future arrangements on the remaining due
balance.  Although  this  debt  was  reported  as  delinquent  on  the  February  2020  credit
bureau  report,  the  January  2022  and  June  2022  credit  reports  reflect  that  Applicant’s
outstanding  balance  remained  $60,938  and  that  Applicant  was  paying  this account  as
agreed. She was tackling her smaller debts before her larger ones. She intends to settle
and pay this debt as she has the financial means to do so. (Tr. at 37-41, 59-61, 79-86,
119-120; GE 2-6; AE C, F, W, II)
SOR ¶ 1.g is a delinquent state tax debt in the amount of $4,449 that Applicant
owes for TY 2010. This tax debt stemmed from an individual income tax lien for $22,485
in business taxes filed against Applicant’s spouse. The lien holder garnished her wages
upon his death due to their joint tax filing status at the time of his death. Although the lien
was released in October 2018 during the sale of her home, documentation from the state
tax authority reflected that the outstanding balance as of December 2020 was $4,449.
Applicant’s 2019 state income tax refund of $38 was applied to her outstanding taxes for
TY 2010. She did not owe any state income taxes for TY 2011 through 2019. She entered
a payment arrangement of $125 monthly for 21 months. As of January 2023, she had
already made four out of 21 monthly payments, and her outstanding balance was $2,316.
She made another payment of $125 in March 2023. (Tr. at 61-62, 89-91, 101; GE 1, 3;
AE G, V, EE, FF)
Applicant expected to earn $151,000 annually as of April 2023, an increase from
her $147,000 starting annual salary in July 2021. Her salary was approximately $107,000
annually between 2018 and 2021. As of April 2023, her net monthly income was $8,162,
and her monthly expenses totaled $6,142, which included her rent of $2,448, a $989 car
payment, and payments toward SOR ¶¶ 1.a to 1.c, 1.f, and 1.g. She refinanced her car
loan  for a  lower interest rate  in  August  2022.  She  estimated  her  monthly net  remainder to
be  $400. She  has a  tax  preparer who  timely files her federal and  state  income  tax  returns
annually, and  she  has  been   paying  the  IRS  $200  monthly for an  unrecalled  amount in
outstanding  taxes  for tax year 2022. She  had  $5,000  in her savings account as of the
date  of the  hearing, and  she  tries to  set aside  $500  monthly in savings. She  intends to
get back on  track financially. She  received  financial counseling  in January 2022  through
her bank’s  financial  advisors.  On   their   advice,  she  obtained   a  credit  card,   with  a   $250
maximum  spending  limit, to  reestablish  her credit. (Tr. at 37-41, 44-47, 59-72, 79-86, 91-
92, 96-102, 107-108, 119-120; GE 2-4;  AE C, F, K, L, N, W, X, CC, DD, GG, II, JJ)
Applicant’s sister, and her former supervisor from approximately 2010 to 2011 and
a friend of 17 years, both attested to Applicant’s trustworthiness, reliability, and judgment.
Applicant’s  previous  supervisor  from  2018  to  2020  lauded  Applicant’s  work  ethic,
professionalism, dedication, and integrity. Her direct supervisor since May 2021 praised
Applicant’s  excellent  performance.  Applicant’s  landlord  of  two years in  2022  described
her as a reliable tenant. Applicant has received favorable performance evaluations. She
comes from a military family, and she served as an advocate for the Veterans of Foreign
Wars organization. (Tr. at 20-21, 66-67, 121-133; AE N, P, Q, R, S)
