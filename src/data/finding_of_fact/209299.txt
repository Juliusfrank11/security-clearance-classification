In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 3.d, 3.e, 3.f, and
the cross-allegation at SOR ¶ 2.a, all with explanations. He denied SOR ¶¶ 2.b, 3.a, 3.b,
and 3.c, all with explanations. Applicant’s admissions are incorporated into the findings
of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I
make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 34 years old. He married in 2013. He and his wife separated in 2019
and divorced in 2020. They have three children, a son, age 13, a daughter, age 8, and a
son, age 7. They share custody of their children and live in the same neighborhood. (GE
1; Tr. 59-62, 68)
Applicant  earned   an   associate   degree   in   2010.   He  served   on   active   duty   in   the
U.S.  Navy  as  a   corpsman   and   psychiatric  technician   from   2010   to   2015.  He  was
discharged  honorably  as an  E-3. From  October 2015  to  October 2017, he  worked  as a
mental  health   technician   at   a   civilian   hospital   in  state   1.  Since   October  2017,  he   has
been   employed   by  a   defense   contractor  as   a   mental  health   technician  in  an   inpatient
psychiatric  unit at a  naval hospital in state  2. He held a  clearance  in the Navy. (GE 1; Tr.
9-10, 35-36, 46-50, 58, 112-114)
In 2014, Applicant took the cellphone of another sailor without her permission. He
“flipped” through pictures on her phone. Applicant said he did it as a “joke.” (GE 1 at 20)
He  was  charged  with  wrongful  misappropriation  of  the  cellphone  under  the  Uniform
Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). He pled guilty, received non-judicial punishment (NJP)
of 45 days of extra duty. (SOR ¶ 1.b) (The SOR allegation references forfeiture of $858
a  month  for  two  months  but  this  is  not  established).  Applicant  was  also  transferred  to
another job location so he would no longer have contact with the female sailor. (GE 1 at
20; GE 2 at 2-3; Tr.  51) In his hearing, Applicant  testified  it was a “juvenile prank that
was very stupid.” He said he gave the phone right back and did not steal it. (Tr. 33-34,
75-79)
In  2015,  Applicant  was  investigated  by  the Naval  Criminal  Investigative  Service
(NCIS)  following  an  interaction  between  himself  and  a  female  former  patient.  About  a
year  after  the  female  sailor  was  a  patient  of  his,  he  saw  her  at  a  public  library  and
engaged  her  in  conversation.  She  later  alleged  that  he  had  been  “hitting  on”  her.  His
background  interview  references  a  charge  of  sexual  assault  under  UCMJ  Article  120
(GE 2 at 3) but there are no charging documents in the record. Applicant asserted that
he did not do anything inappropriate in interacting with his former patient. (Tr. 52) The
case  was  evidently  dismissed  shortly  before Applicant  was  discharged  from  the  Navy.
(GE 2 at 3; Tr. 51-55). This incident was not alleged in the SOR.
While working at the behavioral hospital in state 1 in 2016, Applicant was verbally
reprimanded after giving his personal phone number to a female patient. He said he did
this  unprompted  so  the  patient  would  have  a  way  to  reach  out  if  she  needed  help,
because  he  felt  that  she  “did  not  have  adequate  support.”  He  denied  any  romantic
interest. (GE 2 at 4; Tr. 55-56) He had not done this before. He had been trained in how
to  interact  with  patients  and  said  what  he  did  was  “not  encouraged.”  (Tr.  56)  This
incident was not alleged in the SOR.
In early July 2020, police responded to a complaint filed by a neighbor (Ms. N) of
Applicant’s, after she found inappropriate messages and photos on the cell phone of C,
her  12-year-old  daughter.  C  had  been  communicating  with  Applicant  online,  via
Facebook  Messenger,  in  June  and  July  2020.  The  N  family  and  their  children  were
friends of Applicant’s children. In August 2020, following an investigation, Applicant was
arrested and charged with (taking) indecent liberties with a child, a felony. (GE 3) (SOR
¶¶ 1.a, 2.a)
Applicant  was  interviewed  about  his  arrest  in  a  security  clearance  background
interview on September 1, 2020. (GE 2 at 7-10) (An earlier background interview, in late
July 2020, predated Applicant’s arrest). (GE 2 at 2-6; Tr. 72-73, 100)
When  prompted  at the  start of his  September 2020  interview.  Applicant reported
that  he  had  been  accused  of taking  indecent  liberties with  a  child.  He said  his wife  had
had  a  “falling  out”  with  her friend  Ms. N  (the  neighbor)  and had accused  both  Applicant
and  his wife   of  indecent  liberties   with  her   children.   The families   and   their   children   had
been  friends  and  the  families’  daughters would socialize together. Applicant  tried  to  look
after N’s daughters because  they  did  not have  a father figure.  (GE 2  at 7; Tr.,  49-50, 63-
66)
Applicant said he talked to C, the 12-year-old daughter, on a daily basis through
Facebook during June and July 2020. They discussed general topics such as daily life.
He  acknowledged  using  “inappropriate  language”  with  C.  He  said  C  had  sent  him
“pictures of herself, to show him her outfit, and [Applicant] referred to [C] as ‘sexy.’” He
said he should have used words like “beautiful” instead, and was “just trying to look out
for her by boosting her self-esteem.” He acknowledged his words were “inappropriate.”
(GE 2 at 7-8; Tr. 66-67, 69-70)
Applicant then said C volunteered to send him another picture. C then sent him a
“naked photo” of herself. He said he deleted the photo and told C to never do anything
like  that  again.  He  did  not  believe  he  had  pressured  C.  Applicant  did  not  tell  his  wife
about  the  photo  “because  he  did  not  want  to  violate  [C’s]  trust  by  getting  her  into
trouble.  [Applicant]  continued  to  have  daily  contact  with  [C]  after  she  sent  him  the
photo.” He said there was nothing further sexual and no sexual gratification on his part.
(GE 2 at 8; Tr, 69-70)
C’s family member discovered the photo on C’s phone and contacted Applicant
through  C’s  Facebook  account.  He  told  Applicant  that  “he  did  not  like  [Applicant’s]
relationship with [C] and began to get aggressive and threatening towards [Applicant].”
Applicant then said he would cut  off all contact with C, and did so. He was arrested a
few  weeks  later.  (GE  2  at  8;  Tr.  70-71)  Applicant  said  that,  as  a  father,  he  would  be
“concerned” if his child were interacting with a 30-year-old man on a cell phone. (Tr. 70)
Applicant said in the interview that he believed Ms. M was coaching C to make
these accusations. He has only been with C in person in the presence of Ms. M or his
wife,  except  once,  when  he  and  C  were  seated  on  the  couch  together  for  about  20
minutes. He said he believed Ms. M might claim that Applicant tried to kiss C, which he
denied. He said other children were present and playing in the house at the time. (GE 2
at 8-9) He got no sexual gratification from any  interaction  with  C. Applicant  said in his
interview that the criminal case was pending, he had retained counsel, and said he was
innocent. (GE 2 at 9)
In  March  2021,  Applicant  pled  guilty  to  a  lesser  charge  of  contributing  to  the
delinquency of a juvenile.  He was  fined and sentenced to two  years of probation. The
fine has been paid. (GE 2 at 17, GE 3; Tr. 62, 73-74)
In  his  hearing  testimony,  Applicant  denied  instigating  “any  kind  of  sexually
inappropriate conduct” with C. He said it was she who sent sexual materials to him. He
acknowledged that he should not have been talking to her in the first place. (Tr. 39) He
did not recall how he came to have C’s cell phone number. “I assume she just gave it to
me.” He said they interacted on Facebook, not by cell-phone texting. He asserted that C
found  him  on  Facebook  and  added  him  as  a  contact.  (Tr.  41)  Applicant  said  C  would
send her pictures and ask her his opinion and said that one time she sent him a sexual
picture,  which  he  deleted  at  once  and  told  her  that  was  inappropriate.  (Tr.  41)  He
confirmed that he was charged after C’s parents discovered the messages and pressed
charges. (Tr. 41-42)
While on probation, Applicant was required  to  “have  no inappropriate contact with
[C]   or   any   other   minors.”     He  does  not   believe   there   was   a   “stay   away”   order   put  in
place,  but  he  was  “strongly advised”  by the  judge  not  to  contact  C again,  and  he has not
done   so.  (Tr.  42-43,   94)   His  probation   was   unsupervised,   and   he   was  not  required   to
register  as  a   sex  offender.  He  said  he   did  not  have   to   attend   counseling.  He  said  he
completed   the   two   years  of   probation   in   March  2023,   (Tr.  43-44)  I  requested   that
Applicant  provide  post-hearing  documentation that he had completed  probation  fully and
successfully.   (Tr.  44)   He  did   not  do   so.  He   said  he   has  not  engaged   in   that  conduct
again  and he never will. (Tr. 39)
In April 2021, Applicant was investigated by the local police following a complaint
filed by his ex-wife, A. She had reported that their daughter, D, had told her that D had
been  sitting  next  to  Applicant  on  the  couch,  where  D  observed  Applicant  “touching
himself” while watching a “video of naked girls” on his phone. (GE 4 at 3) (SOR ¶ 2.b)
Local police interviewed all three of their children.  Only one  “made  a  disclosure
about her father showing her pornographic material”  one time. In the police report, the
circumstances  were  explained  as  “child  walked  in  on  dad  late  at  night.”  (GE  3  at  5-6)
The  district  attorney  expressed  concern  but  declined  to  prosecute.  The  investigating
officer  spoke  at  length  with  a  representative  from  the  county  department  of  social
services (DSS) and “determined [that the] biological mother [A] was feeding information
to [the] children.” The police investigation was then closed without further action. (GE 3
at 6)
Applicant  denied  the  incident  in  its  entirety  and  said  it  “never  happened.”  He
in  D’s  presence  and  denied  watching
denied
pornography on his phone in her presence. (Tr. 37-38) He said in his Answer that it was
a false claim brought by his ex-wife with no basis in fact. (Answer to SOR ¶ 2.b; Tr. 98)
touching  himself
inappropriately
Applicant  provided  a  January  2022  letter  from  county  DSS  regarding  their
investigation  of  April  2021  allegations  of  “sexual  abuse  and  neglect,  improper  care
improper supervision, and injurious involvement.”  In June 2021, Applicant’s family was
found to be in need of parenting skills, child characteristics, and communications skills.
Applicant  and  his  former  wife  completed  a  “Crossroads  of  Parenting  and  Divorce”
program  and other classes, and the DSS case was closed. (AE C; Answer; Tr. 87-88,
104-105)  DSS’s  letter  concluded  with  recommendations  that  Applicant  “continue  to
ensure to not expose your children to any pornography, sexually explicit conversations,
or  any  sexual  acts.  The  Department  believes  your  children  are  in  a  safe  environment
residing with you.” (AE C) Applicant said he has complied with these recommendations.
(Tr. 88-89) He has not participated in other family or parent counseling. (Tr. 109)
Applicant  confirmed  at  his  DOHA  hearing  that  he  was  not  charged  or  arrested
because  of  this  incident,  and  the  authorities  took  no  action  to  alter  the  child  custody
arrangement in place with his ex-wife as a result. There was no negative impact on his
probation status and he was not told to report the matter to probation. (Tr. 44-46)
Applicant  acknowledged  another  previous  incident,  in  which  another  of  his
daughters  walked  in  on  him  late  one  night  when  he  was  watching  pornography  in  the
living  room.  Anything  she  saw  was  inadvertent  and  he  thought  he  was  alone.  He  was
not aware that he had been seen until his ex-wife told him that their daughter had seen
him.  He acknowledged  that  he  should not  have  been  watching pornography  where  he
could have been discovered, and now does so in private. (Tr. 81-85, 87, 99)
Applicant has not had any allegations of misconduct made against him regarding
his children since 2021. He still has a Facebook account but uses it rarely. He does not
interact  with  children  on  Facebook.  (Tr.  86)  He  has  not  engaged  in  inappropriate
behavior  since  2021,  either  with  children  or  his  patients.  He  has  not  had  personal
relationships with patients since the incident in 2016. (Tr. 94)
Under Guideline F, the SOR concerns six delinquent debts, totaling $9,809. The
debts are established by credit reports in the record, from June 2020, November 2021,
and May 2022. (GE 5, 6, 7) (SOR ¶ 3)
Applicant disclosed  on his  SCA  that  he  had  some  delinquent debts, and  that  he
was resolving  them  with  the  assistance  of a  debt  consolidation  company. (GE  1  at  37-
39)  Starting  in July  2019, he  had  paid them $250  a  month  for about two  years to  resolve
his debts,  all  but two  of which  were resolved  by the  time  of the  hearing. (Tr. 25-26,  29)
He  is no  longer contracted  to  the  debt  resolution  company since  the  remaining creditors
would  not   settle   with   them,   and   he   stopped   paying   the   company   a   few   months   before
the   hearing.  (Tr.  28,  105)   He  acknowledged   that  he   incurred   debts  because   he   spent
more   than   he   could   afford  to   pay,   but   he   took  out   loans   for  necessary   expenses  (rent
and  a car loan), rather than  frivolous  ones.  (Tr. 59-60)
SOR  ¶  3.a  ($3,201)  is a  charged-off  auto  loan  account.  (GE 5  at 5;  GE  6  at  4)
This account was settled and now shows a zero balance. (GE 7 at 4; AE B, AE D, AE E;
Tr.  26-27)  Applicant  said  the  account  became  delinquent  because  that  was  a
requirement of entering into debt resolution. (Tr. 31)
SOR  ¶   3.b   ($2,034)   is  an   account  placed   for  collection   by  a   landlord   or  rental
property  manager. (GE 6  at  4;  GE  7 at  3)  This account  remains  pending. (AE F  at  19-
21)   Applicant  said  he   was  not  aware   of   it  until  he   received   the   SOR.  He  is  in
negotiations to address this debt. (Tr. 24, 26-27)
SOR ¶ 3.c ($1,902) is a charged-off credit card account. (GE 5 at 5) This account
was settled and now shows a zero balance. (GE 7 at 4; AE B, AE D, AE E; Tr. 27)
SOR  ¶  3.d  ($1,108)  is  a  rental  account  placed  for  collection  by  a  management
company. (GE 5 at 5; GE 6 at 1; GE 7 at 1) This account remains pending. (AE D, AE
E, AE F at 49) Applicant said the creditor would not accept a settlement so he must pay
the full balance, which he intends to do. (Tr. 26, 27, 31)
SOR ¶ 3.e ($857) is an account that has been charged off by a bank. (GE 5 at 5)
Applicant said this debt has been paid. (Tr. 28) SOR ¶ 3.f ($707) is an account placed
for collection by a debt buyer. (GE 6 at 3) This account is being settled by Applicant’s
debt  consolidator.  (AE  B;  Tr.  28)  Applicant  said  that  these  accounts  are  actually  one
debt (one to the creditor and one to the collection agency). It was a loan related to auto
repair financing. He accrued this debt because he was struggling financially. (Tr. 31-33)
Applicant works full time and currently earns about $35,000 to $40,000 annually.
He said he earns about $3,000 a month, after taxes. He estimated that he has $600 to
$1,000 left over after monthly expenses. (Tr. 90-92, 109) He pays $700 a month in child
support  and  $600  a  month  in  rent.  (Tr.  104)  He  does  not  keep  a  monthly  budget  and
has  not  been  through  credit  counseling  since  he  was  in  the  Navy.  (Tr.  93)  He  has  no
other delinquent debts and he intends to resolve what he owes. He has no unfiled tax
returns and no unpaid tax debt. (Tr. 105-109)
Applicant  accepted  responsibility  for  his  actions.  He  said  he  accepted  his
punishment and paid his debt to the state. He has never had any issue with patients he
has treated in his current job and has never had any work issues. (Tr. 46) He completed
his  probation  and  has  not  had  any  further  issues  in  the  last  three  years.  He  does  not
believe he is a liability to the government. He has worked in his field for 14 years and
does not want to lose his career. (Tr. 50, 97-98, 110-112, 126-129; GE 2 at 11, 15)
Applicant provided  a  reference  letter from  his division  officer, a  Navy Lieutenant,
G.   G  has  known   Applicant  since   May  2021.  He  regards  Applicant  as  dependable   and
proficient,   and   says   he   exercises  good   professional  judgment.  He  is  a   reliable  and
essential member  of  the  team.  (AE  A) Applicant  testified,  however, that  G is  not aware
of any of the SOR allegations.  (Tr. 75, 103-104)
