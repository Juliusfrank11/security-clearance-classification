Applicant is 60 years old, married since August 1989, and has two sons, ages 30
and 32, and a daughter age 27. She has a bachelor’s degree (1991) and a doctor’s degree
(2002).  Her  last  employment  was  for  another  federal  government  agency.  Her  project
there  ended  in  March  2023,  and  she  is  currently  unemployed..  Her  spouse  is  also
unemployed (since June 2022). She has a top secret security clearance and is sponsored
by a defense contractor. (GE 1 and 2; Tr. 32-33, 40, 83, 87.)
Under  Guideline  F,  the  May  15,  2022  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant:  (1)  has  an
account placed for collection for $494; (2) failed to file her federal income tax return for
tax year 2013; (3) is indebted to the federal government for delinquent taxes of $35,336,
and; (4) is indebted to the state for $37,778 in taxes for tax years 2009 to the present.
(SOR).  She admitted SOR  ¶ 1.a but  claimed  that the account has been satisfied. She
denied SOR ¶ 1.b and claimed that all federal tax returns and amended tax returns have
been filed. She admitted SOR ¶ 1.c but is waiting for a payment plan with the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) to be approved. She denied SOR ¶ 1.d and claimed that the state
released that tax delinquency. (Answer.)
SOR ¶  1.a.
Applicant testified about SOR ¶ 1.a, an account in collection for $494.
With her Answer, she included a receipt for $148. She testified that the receipt was her
evidence of paying this account. She could not recall what type of account it was or what
type  of  purchase  it  was.  She  did  not  receive  any  notices  from  the  creditor  that  it  was
delinquent. The receipt is dated October 2020, and she met with the Office of Personnel
Management  (OPM)  investigator  in  October  2020,  who  brought  this  account  to  her
attention. She thought her husband had handled this account. She settled this account
after the meeting with the investigator. (Tr. 49-55.) SOR ¶ 1.a has been resolved.
SOR ¶  1.b.  Applicant testified about SOR ¶ 1.b, which alleged that she failed to
file her federal income tax return for tax year 2013, as required. Her Answer denied that
allegation. Applicant testified that she was sure they had filed returns for 2009 to 2020 or
2021. She was not sure exactly when. (Tr. 66-70.) She produced her 2013 federal income
tax  return  for  tax  year  2013  showing  that  it  was  filed  on  July  16,  2015.  (AE  C.)  She
admitted that she had been irresponsible in failing to file her tax returns on time and had
“not been paying very close attention to [her] tax situation.” (Tr. 65-66; GE 2 at 19.) SOR
¶ 1.b has been resolved.
SOR ¶  1.c. Applicant testified about SOR ¶ 1.c, which alleged that she is indebted
to the Government for delinquent taxes of $35,336 for tax years from 2009 to the present.
She admitted that allegation  and claimed that she is awaiting a payment plan from the
IRS.
Applicant  was  directed  to  Applicant’s  Exhibit  A,  an  IRS  Form  656,  Offer  in
Compromise. (Tr. 82.) That exhibit was signed by Applicant and her spouse on June 29,
2023.  (Tr.  24-25.)  The  exhibit  states  that  her plan  is to  pay  $105,000  over  24  months
($4,375 per month), but the SOR states the amount owed is about $35,000. Applicant
explained  that  the  $105,000  was  an  offer,  but  the  amount  owed  is  approximately
$200,000,  which  includes  interest,  late  fees,  and  penalties.  She  submitted  this  offer
through her revenue officer at  the IRS. She has not heard back  from the IRS  with the
official  paperwork.  The  revenue  officer does  not  have  authority  to  approve  an  Offer  in
Compromise. That officer is Applicant’s  liaison to the IRS. The Offer in Compromise is
still pending. (Tr. 83-86, 94-96.)
Applicant was asked how she would be able to pay the $4,375 per month she put
in her Offer in Compromise. She explained that she was waiting for several offers that
paid  “well  over  $100  an  hour.”  There  were  several  opportunities  if  her  “clearance  was
granted.” She also had offers from local governments and federal contractors that do not
require a clearance. Some of those opportunities are “not an offer letter, but . . . if they
like my resume’ then I can get a job.” (Tr. 118-121.)
Applicant testified that she cannot have a payment plan with IRS until there is an
approved Offer in Compromise. She could, however, make “good faith” payments to the
IRS,  so  she  gave  her  spouse  money  to  make  such  payments.  They  were  “sporadic”
payments made before and after her October 2020 meeting with the OPM investigator.
She made those payments from 2020 until she stopped working. Her spouse made “small
payments”  to  the  IRS  from  2009  to  2015.  (Tr.  86-89.)  She  produced  documentation
showing two “good faith” payments. One was $503 for tax year 2018 received by IRS on
November  18,  2021.  The  second  was  $1,500  for  tax  year  2020  received  by  IRS  on
December 13, 2021. (AE F and AE G.) SOR ¶ 1.c has not been resolved.
SOR ¶  1.d. Applicant testified about SOR ¶ 1.d, which alleged that she is indebted
to the state for $37,778 in taxes for tax years 2009 to the present. She was directed to a
spreadsheet in Government Exhibit 2, page 21. She prepared this spreadsheet using her
state tax returns that were actually filed for tax years 2009 through 2021. It tracked her
taxes owed and tax refunds due for that time period. Between 2009 and 2021, she had a
$3,022  total  net  credit.  (Tr.  102-105.)  This  spreadsheet  assisted  her  in  convincing  the
state to issue the April 23, 2021 tax release (for $43,301) that is part of her Answer.  She
has satisfied her state tax obligation. (Tr. 104-105.) SOR ¶ 1.d has been resolved.
Applicant’s Finances
Applicant  has  been  unemployed  since  March  2023,  and  her  spouse  has  been
unemployed since June 2022. Her three children live with her and her husband, and they
support the children. She testified about her sources of income. Her spouse worked for
the Government for seven years and has a Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), but she does not.
She has never been a government employee and was always a contractor. She has no
retirement fund. The TSP is one of their sources of income. She does not know the current
balance, but it started at $85,000. Her spouse only makes withdrawals as needed. When
his job was eliminated, he received $8,000 per month ($40,000 total) in severance. (Tr.
108-112, 123.)
Applicant has two cars. Her business car is a 2015 model she bought in 2021. Its
engine is dead. The repair would cost $33,000; she paid $43,000 for it. She has filed a
Lemon Law claim. Her monthly payment is $798. (Tr. 113.)
Applicant’s  family car is a 2012 model.  She owes about $3,000 to $4,000 on it.
She is a couple of months behind on both car payments. (Tr. 113-114.)
Applicant has no health care coverage. She has one unpaid medical bill for $300.
(Tr. 117-118.)
Food is about $2,000 per month. Utilities are about $800 to $1,000 per month. (Tr.
112, 115.)
Applicant’s mortgage is $4,000 per month. This is the second month she has not
paid the mortgage. (Tr. 111.)
The  family  entertainment  is cable,  cellphones,  and  the  Internet,  about  $800  per
month. They do not dine out. Applicant’s hobby is watching documentaries. (Tr. 115-116.)
Applicant  visited  her  daughter  at  medical  school  five  times  between  2017  and
2019. Each trip cost about $1,000. Applicant used credit cards to pay for those trips. Other
than those trips, Applicant has not taken any vacations or tours. (Tr. 129-132.)
Applicant’s sons are in college, and they graduate in 2024. Her daughter returns
to  medical  school  for  September  2023  through  December  2023,  which  is  her  last
semester. (Tr. 132.)
Only Applicant’s oldest son contributes to the household income, about $400 per
month. (Tr. 111.)
Applicant  keeps  expenses  as  low  as  possible,  just  food,  utilities,  and  cars;  she
does not send out dry cleaning. She and her family are living on credit cards. Her credit
card balance is about $16,000. (Tr. 112, 116-117,126-127.)
Applicant’s checking account balance is usually negative $1,000. (Tr. 123-124.)
Applicant received financial counseling from a credit-repair service from 2013 to
2016. (GE 2.) She also retained a credit-repair service in about 2018 or 2019. She is not
currently receiving financial counseling. (Tr. 127-128.)
Applicant’s two credit reports show the following financial picture (other than back
federal taxes). The October 2020 report shows 30 accounts. All accounts are PAYS AS
AGREED. (GE 4.) The January 2022 report shows three collection accounts, one for $561
that is marked PAID, one for $5,534 that is marked DISPUTED and CHARGED OFF, and
one for $233 that is open. (GE 3.) Applicant’s financial status has apparently not yet been
reflected on the two credit reports in the record. The record does not show a history of
not paying or an unwillingness to pay her household or consumer debts.
Law and Policies
It  is  well  established  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.  As  the
Supreme  Court  held,  “the  clearly  consistent  standard
that  security
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.” Department of the Navy
v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).
indicates
When  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability
for  a  security  clearance,  an
administrative  judge  must  consider  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  These  guidelines  are
flexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the
whole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a
decision.  The  protection  of  the  national  security  is  the  paramount  consideration.  AG  ¶
¶2(b)  requires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  national
security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.”
Under  Directive  ¶   E3.1.14,   the   Government   must  present  evidence   to   establish
controverted  facts alleged  in  the  SOR. Under Directive ¶  E3.1.15,  then  the  applicant  is
responsible  for presenting  “witnesses and  other evidence  to  rebut,  explain, extenuate, or
mitigate  facts admitted  by applicant or proven  by Department Counsel . . . .” The  applicant
has the  ultimate  burden of persuasion in seeking a  favorable security decision.
