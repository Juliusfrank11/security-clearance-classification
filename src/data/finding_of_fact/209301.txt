In  his  SOR  answer,  Applicant  admitted  all
the  allegations,  with  some
explanations.  His  admissions  are  adopted  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  review  of  the
pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  He began working
at his present job in 2014. He has been married for 23 years. He has two minor children
and one adult child, all whom live with him. (Tr. 6, 17-19; GE 1)
The SOR alleged Applicant owed approximately $8,742 from his 2017 federal tax
return  and  approximately  $1,082  from  his  2018  federal  tax  return.  He  admitted  these
debts in his SOR answer and during his hearing testimony. (Tr. 20-21; SOR answer)
Applicant testified that he owed delinquent taxes for 2017 and 2018 because his
tax  preparer  filed  an  erroneous  2017  tax  return,  which  resulted  in  a  higher  tax  bill  for
that year and 2018. Applicant documented reaching an agreement with the IRS on the
tax  amount  owed  and  began  making  monthly  payments  of  approximately  $153.  He
made these payments from December 2021 until June 2022, when he stopped because
he was made aware of the erroneous 2017 return. He hired a tax preparation company
in  November  2022  to  investigate  the  possible  error  and  file  an  amended  return  if
warranted. In the meantime, he was advised to restart making his monthly payments of
$154 to the IRS, which was to begin in July 2023. He documented his agreement with
the tax preparation company  and the company  corroborated his settlement agreement
with the IRS. (Tr. 20-22; AE A)
(debt
The   SOR  also   alleged   Applicant   owed   10   delinquent   accounts
consolidation   loan,  credit  cards,   and   consumer   debts)   totaling   approximately   $39,000.
The   debts  are  established   by   credit  reports   from   August  2021,  March   2022,  October
2022, and  May  2023;  Appellant’s SOR admissions;  and  his  hearing  testimony.  (SOR ¶¶
1.c  –  1.l).  (Tr. 27; GE 3-6; SOR answer)
Applicant admitted  all  the  SOR debts  during  his testimony.  He also admitted  that
he  has not made  any payments  toward  any  of the  debts as of the  date  of the  hearing.
He admitted  living  beyond  his means.  He substantiated  that  one  debt was paid (SOR ¶
1.e)  through  the  enforcement of a  court-ordered  garnishment in 2022  for a  debt where
the   creditor  had   obtained   a   judgment.   Applicant  did   not   voluntarily   contribute   to   the
payment  of  this  debt.  All  the  remaining  debts remain  unresolved.  (Tr. 27, 29-30, 32-38,
47, 51; GE 5-6)
Applicant  testified  that  he  was  in  the  process  of  consulting  with  a  debt  relief
company (DRC) about his debts. Post-hearing, a representative from the DRC provided
a letter stating that it was going to work with Applicant to help resolve his credit issues
by removing negative entries from his credit report. There is no information in the letter
detailing a plan to pay Applicant’s delinquent debts. (Tr. 25-26, 44; AE C)
Applicant  did  not  provide  a  formalized  budget,  but  he  testified  that  his  monthly
“take-home pay” is about $3,700 and his wife’s is about $2,000. He stated that he barely
covers  his  monthly  expenses.  His  testimony  revealed  that  he  is  currently  two  months
behind on making his two vehicle payments. (Since this information was not alleged in
the SOR, I will use it only as it pertains to applicability of any mitigating conditions and in
applying the whole-person factors) He also stated that he has approximately $36,000 in
his retirement account. (Tr. 40-41, 44-46)
Applicant’s SOR answer related that his financial problems started when his wife
“got COVID-19 and lost her job.” He did not provide a date when this occurred. He later
testified that his wife started working again in June 2022 and continues to do so. He did
not pay or set up payment plans for any of the SOR debts after his wife began working
again. (Tr. 30-31; SOR answer)
