Applicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his  current  employer  since  2020.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2001.  He  is  twice
divorced, with his second marriage ending in 2019. He married his current wife in 2021.
He has three children and a stepchild. (Transcript (Tr.) at 23-24; Applicant’s response to
SOR; GE 1, 3)
Applicant  did  not  file  his  federal  income   tax   returns  for  tax  years  2019   through
2021  when  they  were due,  and  he  did  not file  his state  income  tax returns for tax years
2020   and   2021   when  they  were   due.  He   was   not  required   to   file  a state   tax  return  for
2019  because  he  lived  in a  state  that  did  not have  state  income  taxes.  (Tr.  at  24-26,  39-

Applicant  partially  attributed   his   tax-filing   lapses   to   his   divorce.  During   his
separation   and   divorce,  some   of  his   tax   documents  were   delivered   to   his  ex-wife.  He
believes she  threw away some  of the  documents.  His company sent him temporarily  to
another  state   in  2019.  He  remained   in  the   state   and   accepted   his  current  position   in
2020.   His  employer  was  late   in  sending   his  W-2   forms.  He  had   back  surgery,  the
COVID-19  pandemic hit, and  a  hurricane  damaged  his  home  in 2021. He also admitted
that   he   should   have   been   more   diligent  about  his  taxes,   but   his   personal   life   was  in
turmoil,  and  he  just kept putting  off  filing  the  returns. (Tr. at 20,  24, 26-29,  32-40; GE  1-

Applicant  reported  his  failure  to  file  his  federal  and  state  tax  returns  on  a
Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  that  he  submitted  in  January
2022.  He  indicated  that  he  had  obtained  his  missing  documents,  and  he  was  working
with  a  certified  public  accountant  (CPA)  to  file  the  returns.  He  provided  similar
information during an interview for his background  investigation in February 2022. (GE
1, 3)
Applicant  filed   his  2019   through   2021   federal  income   tax  returns  and   2020   and
2021  state  income  tax returns in June  2022. He owed  the  IRS  for back taxes, penalties,
and interest. In  September 2022, he  paid the  IRS  $4,435  for tax year 2019; $2,736  for
2020; and  $355  for 2021  to  pay all  the  taxes,  penalties, and  interest  owed  for those  tax
years.   His  state   does   not   have   an   equivalent  to   IRS   tax   account  transcripts,  but  he
credibly testified  that the  state  tax returns have  been  filed  and  all  taxes paid.  (Tr. at 17-
20, 33-34, 41; AE A-D)
Applicant  now  fully  understands  the  importance  of  filing  his  returns  and  paying
his  taxes  on  time.  He  assures  that  all  future  returns  and  taxes  will  be  filed  and  paid
when they are due. (Tr. at 21-22, 41)
