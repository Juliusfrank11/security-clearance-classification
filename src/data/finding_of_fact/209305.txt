SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.m  allege  14  delinquent  debts  totaling  about  $45,000.  SOR  ¶  1.o
alleges that Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in September 2022. The debts
alleged in the SOR include two loans to a credit union, multiple credit-card and consumer
accounts, and several medical debts. In Applicant’s  answer to the SOR, he denied the
allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.n and admitted the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.o. His admission is
incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 44-year-old engineer technician employed by a defense contractor
since November 2017. He has held a second job as a delivery driver for a food service
provider since August 2021. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from March 2004
to March 2012 and received an honorable discharge. He was unemployed from April 2012
to  May  2013.  He  was  employed  in  various  non-government  jobs  from  May  2013  to
November  2017.  He  held  a  security  clearance  while  in  the  Navy,  and  he  received  a
security clearance for his current job in May 2018.
Applicant married  in August  2016  and  has  four stepchildren, ages  20, 18,  16, and
14.  Although   the   father of  these  four children   provides  occasional  financial  support for
them, Applicant and  his wife are responsible for their daily living expenses.
Applicant and his wife purchased a home in February 2016, while he was working
in a job that paid less than his current job. He and his wife began falling behind on their
debts and they began having a monthly deficit of about $1,000 per month. (Tr. 33, 37)
After some point after Applicant and his wife purchased the home, they decided to
have a child. Applicant’s wife became pregnant, but she miscarried at six months. They
tried again, and their daughter was born in March 2018. (Tr. 18) His wife, who was earning
about $50,000 per year, stopped working after their daughter was born in March 2018,
because  the  cost  of  childcare  was  about  the  same  as  what  she  was  earning.  (Tr.  30)
Applicant  testified  that  the  minimum  monthly payments  on  their  debts  kept  increasing,
and they knew it was only a matter of time before they would become delinquent. (Tr. 59)
Applicant and  his  wife  contacted  a  bankruptcy lawyer  in  early 2018,  who  advised
them  to  stop  paying  their  delinquent debts.  (Tr. 58-59) They did  not  contact their  creditors
or  make   any   effort   to   resolve   their   delinquent   debts.   (Tr.  37)   They  terminated   some
unnecessary  expenses  such   as  cable   television.  (Tr.  51)   They   could   not  file  their
bankruptcy petition  in 2018, because  they could not afford to  pay the  legal fees. (Tr. 33-
34) The petition reflects that the lawyer’s fee  was $2,600. (GX 4 at 60)
Applicant and his wife filed a petition for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in September 2022,
more than five years after consulting with the bankruptcy lawyer. Applicant testified that
it took them a long time to  save enough money to pay the bankruptcy lawyer because
“that  money  would  always  kind  of  go  to  something  else  that  would  come  up  in  the
moments that we would need to pay off during all that time, and it was a long time.” The
petition included the debts alleged in the SOR. They claimed their home, two vehicles,
and various personal effects as exempt property. The petition listed Applicant’s wife as
the sole owner of the home and two vehicles. (GX 4 at 20-22) They received a discharge
in December 2022. (AX A) Applicant admitted that protecting his security clearance was
a major factor in his decision to file the bankruptcy petition. (Tr. 47)
Applicant’s current net remainder after paying all living expenses is about $1,000
per month. (Tr. 52) He and his wife drive two old cars that are paid for: an 18-year-old
vehicle with 150,00 miles on it and a 16-year-old vehicle with 195,000 miles on it. (GX 3
at  11)  They  have  only  one  credit  card,  and  they  pay  more  than  the  monthly  minimum
amount. The payments on their home mortgage loan are current. (Tr. 49) Their monthly
net remainder after paying all their expenses is about $1,000 (Tr. 52)
