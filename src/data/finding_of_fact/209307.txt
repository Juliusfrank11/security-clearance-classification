Applicant  admitted  to  all  the  allegations  in  SOR  with  explanations.  After  a
thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  testimony,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  60-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed  with  the  defense  contractor  since  April  of  2007.  Applicant  has  a  bachelor’s
degree. He is married, and has no children. (TR at page 5  line 13 to page 6 line 6, at
page 15 lines 1~20, and GX 1 at pages 7, 10, 11, 15 and 17.)  Applicant attributes his
current financial difficulties to the death of his mother in 2017, about six years ago. He
incurred  expenses  dealing  with  her  “health”  issues,  and  in  arranging  for  her  “funeral.”
(TR at page 16 line 23 to page 17 line 17, and at page 20 lines 13~25.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
1.a.  and   1.c.  Applicant  admits  two  past-due  debts  to  Creditor  A  in  amounts  of
$6,253  and  $3,747.  He  has  submitted  nothing  further  regarding  the  $6,200  debt,  but
claims to have recently paid the $3,700 debt. (TR at page 16 line 7 to page 20 line 25,
and at page 22 line 20 to page 23 line 21.) As both debts still appear as past-due on the
Government’s  most  recent  March  2023  credit  report,  I  find  these  two  debts  totaling
$10,000 are still past due. (GX 5 at pages 5 and 6.)
1.b.  Applicant  admits  a  past-due  debt  to  Creditor  B  in  the  amount  of  about
$3,774, but claims to have recently paid this debt. (TR at page 21 line 2 to page 22 line
19.)  The  only  document  Applicant  submits  in  this  regard  shows  an  outstanding
judgment of $4,472. (AppX A.) I find this increased debt is still past due.
1.d.  Applicant  admits  a  past-due  debt  to  Creditor  D  in  the  amount  of  about
$3,355, but has submitted nothing further in this regard. I find this debt is still past-due.
1.e.  Applicant  admits  a  past-due  debt  to  Creditor  E  in  the  amount  of  about
$3,287, and submits documentation showing that he has recently set up a payment plan
to address this admitted debt. (TR at page 23 line 22 to page 25 line 5, AppX B.)  As
Applicant  has  submitted  nothing  further  in  this  regard,  such  as  documents  showing
payments pursuant to his payment plan, I find this debt is still past due.
1.f. Applicant admits a past-due debt to Creditor F in the amount of about $2,483,
but claims to have recently paid this debt. (TR at page 25 lines 6~21.) As this debt still
appears as past-due on the Government’s most recent March 2023 credit report, I find
this debt still past due. (GX 5 at page 5.)
1.g. Applicant admits a past-due debt to Creditor G in the amount of about $871,
but claims to have recently paid this debt. (TR at page 25 line 22 to page 26 line 2.) He
has submitted  documentation  showing  such  a payment.  (AppX  C.)  I find  that  this debt is
not past  due.
1.h. Applicant admits a past-due debt to Creditor H in the amount of about $427,
but avers he is “still working on” it. (TR at page 26 lines 3~8.) He has submitted nothing
further in this regard. I find that this debt is still past due.
1.i. Applicant admits a past-due debt to Creditor  I in the amount of about $363,
but claims to have recently paid this debt. (TR at page 29 lines 9~16.) As Applicant has
submitted  nothing  further  in  this  regard,  and  as  this  debt  appears  as  past-due  on  the
Government’s August 2022 credit report, I find this debt still past due. (GX 3 at page 4.)
