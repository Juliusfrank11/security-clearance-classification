The  SOR alleged  three  delinquent  debts  to  include:  a $78,085  collection  account
that  was placed  for collection  (SOR ¶  1.a:  Items 5  at 5; 6  at 2;  7  at  1, 8  at 2); a  past due
bank loan, balance  unknown (SOR  ¶  1.b:  Response  to  SOR );  a  past due  line  of  credit
with   a   bank,  balance   unknown  (SOR  ¶   1.c:  Response   to   SOR).  The   SOR  alleges
Applicant failed  to  timely file his 2019  federal income  tax return (SOR ¶  1.d: Item  4  at 6-
12, 16); and  that Applicant failed  to  file  his 2019  state  income  tax return. (SOR ¶  1.4  at
17). In his SOR answer, Applicant  admits to  all of the  SOR allegations. (Items 2)
In 2014, Applicant and his business partner purchased a business from another
neighbor who was retiring.  Applicant continued to work his full-time job while his business
partner quit his job and worked full-time at the business. The business did well for several
years. In 2016, the business had a large commercial job that was poorly managed. To
keep  things  going,  they  took  out  loans  so  they  could  buy  material  and  manufacture
products.  At one point, Applicant took out a line of credit in order to make payroll and for
other business expenses.  They completed the job, but the business took a downturn. His
business  partner  decided  it  was  too  much  work  and  walked  away  from  the  business.
Applicant  tried  to  continue  running  the  business,  but  it  eventually  closed.  Applicant
incurred several debts in an attempt to keep the business running. He intends to pay the
delinquent debts incurred by the business. (Item 2, Response to SOR)
Applicant says he learned a very difficult life lesson. He admits his situation is not
ideal but he is trying to the satisfy all debts. He tries to give back to his community. For
the past 15 years, he  has helped build over 30 homes for qualified individuals with Habitat
for Humanity. For more than 10 years, he has volunteered on the supervisory committee
of his local credit union. (Item 2)
In response to the FORM, Applicant’s attorney wrote a brief on Applicant’s behalf.
He notes Applicant has worked for the same DOD contractor for over 22 years and has
no issues with his security clearance or handling proprietary information. He indicates that
Applicant’s  business  bid  on  large  contract.  The  business  underbid  the  job  and  went
bankrupt  performing  the  work  but  completed  the  job.  The  company  through  Applicant
retained  counsel  to  defend  against  and  negotiate  debts  related  to  the  business.
Applicant’s attorney says all debts alleged in the SOR are related to the failed business
venture. Applicant has a history of being financially responsible for his personal debts.
(Response to FORM)
Applicant’s attorney states Applicant filed both federal and state income tax returns
for  tax  year  2019.  The  IRS  confirmed  receipt  of  the  2019  federal  tax  return.  Applicant
worked  for  years  to  resolve  the  debts  of  his  failed  business  venture.  He  entered  an
agreement to settle the $78,085 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a for $10,000. The amount of
the debt to be resolved is approximately $7,132. (Response to FORM)
The current status of the SOR allegations are:
SOR ¶ 1.a:  $78,085 debt placed for collection: Applicant states this is a business
loan.  He  was  a  co-signer  on  the  loan.  He  mentions  he  has  learned  that  the  lender  is
known as a predatory lender. He and his lawyer worked for years to settle this debt. On
April 18, 2023, the case was settled for $10,000.  Applicant paid two $2,500 payments to
the creditor, for a total of $5,000. Applicant agreed to pay $500 a month starting on July
1, 2023 for a total of ten months. The final payment is due on April 1, 2024. The debt is
being resolved. (AE A)
SOR ¶  1.b:  Delinquent bank loan, amount is unknown: Applicant states this is a
loan for the business. He signed as co-signer. His lawyer is in discussions with the bank
to arrange an achievable payment plan.  I note this debt does not show up on Applicant’s
credit reports.  Applicant disclosed this debt during his background investigation.
SOR ¶  1.c:   Delinquent line of credit from a bank, amount is unknown:  Applicant
states this is a line of credit  for  the business.  He  signed as  co-signer. His  lawyer is in
discussions with the bank to arrange payment plan. I note this debt does not show up on
Applicant’s  credit  reports.  Applicant  disclosed  this  debt  during  his  background
investigation.
SOR ¶  1.d:  Failure to timely file his 2019 Federal income tax return for tax year
2019.  Applicant  admits  he  did  not  timely  file  his  2019  federal  income  tax  return.  He
typically files an extension because his business returns are not completed on time by his
accountant. The business returns came back later than normal, and he did not promptly
complete  his personal return.  Applicant  and his attorney,  provided proof  that  the  2019
federal income tax return was filed. (Item 2; Item 4 at 6 – 12; Response to FORM, AE B)
Applicant first responded to DOHA Interrogatories on June 22, 2022.  The Internal
Revenue Service (IRS) tax transcript, dated June 17, 2022, indicated Applicant was to
receive a $4,197 refund for tax year 2019. Although the tax transcript indicated Applicant
had not filed a tax return, the IRS sent Applicant a letter, dated June 14, 2022, indicating
they received Applicant’s tax return for 2019. They requested he take the extra step of
verifying his identity before they “process [his] federal income tax return, issue a refund
or  credit  overpayment  to  [his]  account.”  (Item  4  at  6  –  12)  This  is  sufficient  to  prove
Applicant filed his 2019 federal income tax return.
SOR ¶  1.e: Failure to timely file his 2019 state income tax return: Applicant and his
attorney  claim  he  completed  his  2019  state  income  tax  return.  In  his  Response  to
Interrogatories, Applicant states he attempted to get his state income tax transcripts for
2019 online. He contacted the state department of revenue. They informed he could not
get the transcript online. He needed to submit a formal request for the tax transcript by
mail or fax. Applicant faxed the request. He contacted the state department of revenue
again before submitting his Response to Interrogatories. He claims they confirmed the
2019 state income tax return was filed and paid. No documentation was provided from
the state department of revenue verifying this. (Item 2, Response to FORM; Item 4 at 17,
20)
Applicant provided a Personal Financial Statement on June 20, 2022. His total net
monthly income is $5,450. His monthly expenses and monthly payments total $4,850. He
has  approximately  $600  left  over  each  month  in  discretionary  income.  He  has
approximately $730,000 in total assets, of that amount, $700,000 is in stocks and bonds.
