The  SOR  alleges  19  delinquent  consumer  debts  totaling  about  $20,000.  In
Applicantâ€™s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  all  the  allegations.  His  admissions  are
incorporated  in  my  findings  of  fact.  The  debts  are  reflected  in  credit  reports  from
December 2021, October 2022, and June 2023, and court records reflecting judgments
against him entered in July 2019 and September 2020. (FORM Items 4-9)
Applicant is a 50-year-old material handler senior specialist employed by a defense
contractor since August 2013. (FORM Item 11 at 4) He married in June 2010. He has four
children,  ages  24,  23,  11,  and  8,  and  a  29-year-old  stepdaughter.  He  told  a  security
investigator that he pays child support to an ex-girlfriend. He did not identify which children
were  born  during  the  previous  relationship,  but  his  SCA  reflects  that  three  of  his  four
children were born before he married. (FORM Item 11 at 5) His SCA reflects that he has
never held a security clearance. (FORM Item 3 at 32)
Applicant attributed the debts alleged in the SOR to his wife being unable to work
after being injured in a car accident. He did not submit any evidence of efforts to resolve
the debts alleged in the SOR. He told a security investigator that he intends to work with
a debt-consolidation company, but that he has not yet found a company that fits his needs.
(FORM Item  11  at 5, 11) He  previously received  a  Chapter 7  bankruptcy  discharge  in
December 1999. (FORM Item 10) The bankruptcy discharge is not alleged in the SOR,
and  I  have  considered  it  only  for  the  limited  purposes  of  deciding  which  adjudicative
guidelines are applicable and in my whole person analysis See ISCR Case No. 03-20327
at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006).
