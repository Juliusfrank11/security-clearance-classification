In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations in the SOR with
explanations. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  52-year-old  engineer  employed  by  defense  contractors  since
October 2016. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from July 1989 to July 2009 and
retired as a senior chief petty officer (pay grade E-8). He was employed by the Navy after
retiring until January 2011. He was employed by federal contractors until April 2020, when
he  was  fired  after  he  was  arrested  for  driving  under  the  influence.  He  was  hired  by  a
defense contractor in February 2021 and hired by his current employer in August 2021.
He  contracted  COVID-19  in  September,  was  hospitalized  until  October  2021,  and
returned to work in November 2021. He received 80% of his regular pay while he was
recovering. (GX 3 at 2) He held a security clearance in the Navy and continued to hold it
as a civilian employee and as an employee of a federal contractor.
Applicant  married  in  December  1992,  divorced  in  April  2014,  and  remarried  in
November 2014. He adopted his current wife’s three children, twins born in October 2002
and a daughter born in September 2000, to remove them from an abusive relationship,
and he incurred substantial legal expenses to do so. (Answer; Tr. 20; GX 1 at 26-29) He
received a bachelor’s degree in May 2020 and is working toward a master’s degree.
The  SOR  alleges  ten  delinquent  debts,  reflected  in  credit  reports  from  October
2022 (GX 4), December 2021 (GX 5), and January 2021 (GX 6). Applicant told a security
investigator that his ex-wife had opened many credit accounts in his name and without
his  knowledge  and  accumulated  more  debt  than  they  could  manage.  (GX  2  at  8)  The
evidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below.
SOR  ¶   1.a:   Credit-card   debt   charged  off  for  $30,071.   This  debt  was  a  joint
account with Applicant’s ex-wife. When they divorced, they agreed to divide the marital
assets outside the court action, but they could not come to an agreement about some of
the debts. Applicant testified that this creditor agreed to consolidate the mortgage loan on
his home, this credit-card account, and the loan alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b. He testified that he
believed  that  after  the  mortgage  loan  was  foreclosed  and  the  home  was  sold,  the
proceeds of the sale would be used to pay the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b. (Tr.
30-31, 67) He testified that he received a letter from the mortgage lender informing him
that everything was paid. (Tr. 34) He submitted no documentation to support his testimony
about the debt-consolidation plan.
The debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b are reflected a credit report dated October
11, 2022, as charged off. (GX 4 at 5) Applicant submitted a credit report dated August 4,
2023, which lists three old accounts with this creditor that were closed in 2015, but it does
not reflect the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b. (AX B). He testified that the  debts
were removed from his credit report “because of the paperwork.” (Tr. 29)
SOR ¶  1.b:  Loan charged off for $72,694. Applicant testified that this debt was
for the purchase of a boat. (Tr. 34) He testified that he sold the boat in 2015 for $25,000
and received a certificate of title showing that the loan was paid. (Tr. 35-36) He provided
no documentation to support his testimony.
SOR  ¶   1.c:   Credit-card  account   placed   for  collection  of   $519.   Applicant
testified that he paid this debt with a loan obtained through his employer. (Tr. 41-42) He
provided  no  documentation  to  support  his  testimony.  The  credit  reports  submitted  by
Applicant reflect that the account was referred for collection and is unresolved. (AX B at
107; AX C at 13)
SOR ¶  1.d:  Credit-card account  charged off for $1,406.  Applicant testified that
he paid this debt, but the credit report he submitted reflects that the account was closed
and $1,406 was written off. (AX C) The debt is not resolved.
SOR ¶  1.e:  Credit-card account  charged off for $1,090.  Applicant testified that
he had paid this debt, and the credit report he submitted reflects a paid charge-off. (Tr.
45; AX B at 19). It is resolved.
SOR ¶  1.f:  Credit-card account  charged off for $945. Applicant testified that he
had paid this debt and he submitted a credit report reflecting a paid charge-off. (Tr. 46;
AX B at 16) The debt is resolved.
SOR  ¶   1.g:   Cellphone   account   placed  for  collection  of   $2,035.   Applicant
disputes this debt. He testified that, when he switched service providers, a representative
of the new provider promised that they would transfer the account and pay the amount
due on the old account. (Tr. 47) He submitted a credit report reflecting that the account is
disputed. (AX B at 106) He provided no evidence that the dispute has been resolved.
SOR ¶  1.h:  Credit-card account  charged off for $390. Applicant testified that he
paid this debt, but the credit report he submitted reflects that the account was charged
off. (Tr. 51; GX 4; AX B at 21) It is not resolved.
SOR ¶  1.i:  Credit-card account  charged off for $439.  A credit report submitted
by  Applicant  reflects  that  the  debt  was  charged  off.  (AX  B  at  38; AX  C at  29) It  is not
resolved.
SOR ¶  1.j: Federal tax  debt  of  $32,948  for tax  year 2016. This debt was incurred
when Applicant withdrew funds from his 401(k) account, but did not report the withdrawal
on his return for 2016. In September 2019, the IRS assessed additional tax of $4,573, a
penalty  of $3,995,  and interest of  $2,909. Applicant made  a $100 payment in  January
2020,  which  was  dishonored.  He  made  a  $125  payment  in  March  2020.  He  made  no
payments after he was fired in April 2020. He established an  installment agreement in
August 2020, but it was terminated in May 2021. He made another installment agreement
in March 2022, but he made no payments because he disputed the amount due. (GX 3a
at 3, 4; Tr. 55) He provided no explanation or evidence of the basis for the dispute.
Applicant recently hired a debt-relief company to help him. On June 21, 2023, the
IRS informed him that it was contacted on June 23, 2023, by him or his authorized third
party  (probably  the  debt-relief  company).  The  IRS  informed  him  that  it  would  respond
within  90  days.  (AX  A)  As  of  the  date  the  record  closed,  the  debt  was  not  resolved.
Applicant provided no evidence of a response from the IRS and did not request additional
time to obtain it.
Applicant submitted evidence of a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau consent
order applicable to the creditor alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b. The Bureau found that the
creditor  violated  the  Consumer  Financial  Protection  Act  of  2010  by  making  deceptive
representations to consumers in connection with its debt collection practices and unfairly
restricting consumers’ electronic account access. (AX G) Applicant has not asserted that
he  was  the  victim  of  any  of  the  deceptive  representations  or  unfair  restrictions  on  his
account access. Instead, he testified that he asked the creditor to consolidate his home
mortgage  loan  and  two  credit  card  accounts  into  a  single  loan.  He  testified  that  he
erroneously thought that the consolidation had occurred, that the mortgage on the home
had been foreclosed, and that the proceeds of the foreclosure sale had been used to pay
the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b. (Tr. 30-31)
Applicant’s  total  monthly  income  is  about  $6,500.  (Tr.  61)  He  testified  that  his
monthly net remainder after paying all household expenses is between $200 and $500
per month, depending on how much he earns in the summer as a baseball umpire. (Tr.
64)
A colleague of Applicant who has worked with him for about 19 months regards
him as a superb leader who assumed the role of a chief engineer and turned around what
had been a very dysfunctional operation. He considers Applicant a person of integrity,
holding himself accountable for the work of his team and treating everyone with dignity
and respect. (AX D)
Another  colleague  also  observed  how  Applicant  reformed  a  dysfunctional
operation and instilled “inspired work habits and quality work deliverables.” He considers
Applicant “a man of integrity, a man of strength, a family man, a man of honor, that can
be counted on when times are good and when times are not so good.” (AX E)
A third colleague describes Applicant as “a high-minded individual of exceptional
character  and  integrity.”  He  states  that  there  have  been  countless  occasions  when
Applicant  has  proven  to  be  “a  class  apart,  in  terms  of  possessing  an  impeccable
character.” (AX F)
