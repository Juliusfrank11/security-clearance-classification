Applicant admitted both delinquent student loan accounts (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b)
without further comment. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits
submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 45 years old. He has never married and has no children. He earned
an associate degree in  2001.  He has been taking college  courses towards earning an
information  technology  (IT)  certification  since  December  2022.  He  has  worked  in
engineering for a defense contractor, with a security clearance, since March 2016. (Tr.
10, 16, 21, 35)
The SOR alleges two federal student loans owed to the Department of Education
(¶ 1.a, for $18,001 and ¶ 1.b, for $11,864), totaling $29,865. Applicant admitted both debts
in his Answer, and they are also established by his March 2022 credit report (GE 2).
Applicant  used  these  two  student  loans  to  finance  his  associate  degree.  The
original amount of the loans totaled about $25,000-26,000. The loans were reported in
collection status in early 2019. (GE 2; Tr. 23) He did not disclose any delinquent debts on
his February 2021 SCA. (GE 1)
Applicant attributed his delay in repaying the loans to periods of underemployment
and unemployment in the years after he earned his degree. He was not able to find stable
employment until 2010. He worked for a medical company from 2010 to 2014. In 2014,
he relocated to his current home state. He worked in the real estate sector from 2014 until
2016, when he joined the defense industry and secured his current employment. (GE 1;
Tr. 24-27)
Applicant secured deferments of his loan payments twice. He said he has never
been on a repayment plan for his student loans. He acknowledged that there were several
years where he took no action towards his loans. He admitted that he should have taken
care of them many years ago and is “embarrassed about it” now. (Tr. 28-29, 37)
Applicant acknowledged that when he started with his employer in 2016, he was
contacted  and  asked  to  begin  repayments  on  his  student  loans.  He  requested  a
forbearance,  because  “every time  was kind  of not  the  best time”  to  begin repayments.  (Tr.
39-40)  He maintained  that  he  did not  have  sufficient  funds  to  address his  student loans
until  he   was  hired   by   his  current  employer.   His  starting   annual  salary  with   his  current
employer  was about   $13,000   or   14,000. Since   then, his salary has  steadily  increased,
and  he  now earns  an annual salary of $63,800. (Tr. 23-27)
Applicant  knew  that  delinquent  debts  were  an  issue  for  getting  a  clearance
because  of  the  potential  for  “compromise.”  His  expenses  have  increased  since  he
resumed taking classes  in December 2022. He is financing his current courses  “out of
pocket” and through a tuition reimbursement employee benefit. He anticipates that he will
pay about $14,000 to $16,000 “out of pocket.” The record did not indicate the amount he
has paid to date. (Tr. 29-30, 47-48)
Applicant has not been contacted by the U.S. Department of Education (USDOE)
about resuming his student loan payments after the post-COVID-19 forbearance program
ends this fall. (Tr. 29, 37-41) He knows that his past-due student loans are a “roadblock”
to furthering his education, but he has been concerned about beginning a payment plan
and then falling behind. (Tr. 32-34, 45-47, 49-50) There is no indication in the record that
he ever contacted the USDOE to attempt even an income-based repayment plan.
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  detailed  his  plan  to  resolve  the  student  loan  debt.  He
intends to pay off his student loans in full by using the equity from his home. A few weeks
before the hearing, he applied to refinance his mortgage. He believes he currently owes
just  under  $30,000  in  student  loans.  He  plans  to  take  the  equity  from  the  mortgage
refinancing and make one lump-sum payment to resolve the loan in full. He expects that
his monthly mortgage payment will increase from $900 to $1,300, which he said he has
sufficient savings to address. However, the true impact on his monthly finances is unclear,
since it is too soon to tell without more information. (Tr. 29-34, 46-50)
Applicant does not maintain a written budget, but he is current with all of his bills,
and is able  to  detail his monthly expenses.  He  has no other delinquent  debts.  He has
never  had  a  security  violation.  He  would  never  do  anything  to  compromise  himself
because he “wouldn’t say anything about what I do or how I do it.”  He has no past-due
taxes or tax returns. (Tr. 35-36, 42-44, 48-52)
After the hearing, Applicant provided an update regarding his progress in resolving
his student loan debt. An August 4, 2023  Department of Education statement reflected
his total loan balance of $29,866 ($29,042 in principal and $823 in interest). (AE B) His
mortgage refinance was conditionally approved at some point after the hearing, but final
closing was pending. (AE C) He indicated that he had reduced his 401(k) contributions.
He said he has been “scared straight.” (AE A)
