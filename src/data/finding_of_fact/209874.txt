Applicant  is  a  58-year-old  analyst  who  has  been  intermittently  employed  by  a
defense contractor since July 2016. He was unemployed from December 2019 until he
was  interviewed  by  an  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  investigator  in  July
2021.  The  FORM  does  not  contain  any  information  regarding  his  current  employment
status.  (Items  3,  7)  He  seeks  a  clearance  in  conjunction  with  his  current  employment.
He  has  previous  clearance history as a  result  of  his military service,  discussed  below.
(Item 7)
Applicant  was  awarded  an  associate  degree  in  June  1994  and  was  awarded  a
bachelor’s degree in August 1996. (Items 3, 7) Applicant was married from April 1996 to
July 2008. That marriage ended by divorce. He has two adult children, ages 34 and 25.
Applicant indicated that he has been residing with a cohabitant since November 2015.
(Items 3, 7)
Applicant  served  in  the  U.S.  Army  and  Army  National  Guard  (ANG)  as  both  an
enlisted soldier and officer from 1983 until his retirement in 2015. Because of his service
on active duty, Applicant became eligible for an early ANG retirement in June 2019 and
receives approximately $4,093 per month. (Items 7, 10)
Financial Considerations
Applicant’s  eight  delinquent  SOR  debts,  totaling  approximately  $68,644,  are
established  by his  June  4,  2021 SF-86; his  February  4, 2020  and  July 13,  2021  OPM
interviews; his October 5, 2021 DOHA Interrogatory responses; his July 2, 2021, March
9, 2022, and September 19, 2022 credit reports; his child support/divorce records; and
his  undated  SOR  Answer.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.h;  Items  1-10)  In  his  SOR  Answer,
Applicant admitted each allegation.
Although   not  his  largest  debt,   Applicant’s  $10,000   child   support   arrearage   in
SOR ¶  1.h  presents as  the  most troubling. In  February 2013, Applicant’s former spouse
obtained  a  $7,651  child  support judgment of delinquency against  him. (Item  8) By  June
4, 2021, the  size of the  arrearage  had  increased  to  at least $10,000. (Item  3) In  his SF-
86, Applicant described  this  debt as alimony,  and  he  later explained  in his February  4,
2020   OPM   interview  that  this  debt  was  actually  for  child   support.   (Item   10)   He  added
during   that   interview  that  he   owed   about  $17,000   in  back   child   support  and
acknowledged  that  he  had  not  made  any  payments since  the  2015  to  2016  timeframe.
(Item  10)
In  his October  5,  2021  DOHA  interrogatory responses,  Applicant  stated  that  he
had about $94,000 in debt and attributed periods of unemployment after leaving active
duty  in  late  2014  for  his  financial  situation.  (Item  7)  He  also  admitted  that  he  had  not
paid  any  of  the  nine  debts  listed  in  the  Interrogatory,  nor  had  he  made  payment
arrangements  or  made  any  payments.  (Item  7)  Eight  of  those  debts  are  listed  on  his
SOR. (Items 1, 7)
As the above summary indicates, Applicant has incurred a substantial amount of
unresolved debt. Furthermore, he did not submit evidence that he resolved any of these
debts, that he remained in contact with his creditors during his periods of delinquency,
or that he received financial counseling.
