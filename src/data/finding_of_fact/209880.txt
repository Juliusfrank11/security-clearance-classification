Applicant is 44 years old, married and has two adult children. From October 2002
through June 2004, he attended college and earned an associate degree. He has lived
at his current residence since 2005. He started with his current employer in April 2008
and is a technician. (GX 3, 10-11)
The SOR alleges 15 delinquent  federal student loans totaling $44,672  (SOR ¶¶
1.a-1.o)  and  one  delinquent  medical  account  totaling  $469  (SOR  ¶  1.p).  Applicant
admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.o  and  denied  SOR  ¶  1.p  with  explanations.  In  addition  to
Applicant’s admissions, the debts are established by Applicant’s April 2017, March 2021
and June 2022 credit reports. (GX 1-2, 6-8)
Applicant explained that he took out student loans to fund his college education
from  2002  through  2004.  The  loans  came  out  of  deferment  in  late  2004,  but  he  could
not afford to make the minimum payment of $900 each month. He stated that from late
2004 through early 2017, he made no payment on his student loans. (GX 2-4, 10-11)
Applicant stated that, during this time, he made multiple attempts to complete a
repayment  plan  through  the  Department  of  Education  (DOE)  website.  On  each
occasion, the website calculated a monthly repayment that was 2.5 times greater than
his  mortgage.  He  stated  he  then  called  DOE  on  three  separate  occasions  and
requested that a repayment application be mailed to him. However, he claimed he never
received  the  paperwork.  He  did  not  provide  further detail  as  to  the  proposed  payment
plans, what dates he contacted DOE or what additional efforts he undertook to resolve
these delinquent accounts prior to 2017. (GX 2-4, 10-11)
In May 2017, DOE issued a wage garnishment order to Applicant’s employer and
listed  the  amount  due  as  $71,861.  Applicant’s  April  2017  credit  report  reflected  a
delinquent  student  loan  balance  of  about  $57,319.  The  record  is  unclear  as  to  the
reasons  for  the  balance  difference.  At  the  time,  Applicant’s  annual  salary  was  about
$53,000, paid bi-weekly. The involuntary wage garnishment was calculated at $211 per
pay period, beginning in June 2017. (GX 4, 9)
Once  the  garnishment  was  initiated,  Applicant  took  no  action  to  establish  a
payment plan  with DOE  or otherwise  bring his loans into good standing.  He stated he
chose to allow the garnishment to continue as a way to repay the debt and not cause
financial burden to his family since it was a payment he could afford. (GX 2-4, 11)
Applicant  stated  that,  from  June  2017  through  early  2020,  wage  garnishments
continued pursuant to the order. A comparison of Applicant’s credit reports reflects that
his  delinquent  student  loan  balance  decreased  from  $57,319  to  $44,672  during  this
time. (GX 2, 8-9, 11)
In  about  March  2020,  the  wage  garnishment  was  suspended  as  part  of
COVID-19  relief  efforts.  Applicant’s  April  2022  earnings  statement  does  not  show
payments  toward  the  garnishment.  In  his  May  2022  Response  to  Interrogatories,
Applicant stated that the garnishment remained suspended and he had not issued any
other payment  on  his student  loans.  He  anticipated  that  the garnishment  would  renew
once the COVID-19 relief efforts terminated. (GX 2, 4)
In  his  October  2022  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  did  not  specify  whether any
additional  payments  had  occurred  on  the  student  loans  since  the  garnishment  was
suspended  and  he  did  not  provide  any  detailed  history  of  payments.  However,  he
restated  that  he  will  allow  the  garnishment  to  proceed  in  order  to  repay  the  debt  in  a
way that does not cause a financial burden. (GX 2)
With  regard  to  the  delinquent  medical  debt  (SOR  ¶  1.p),  Applicant  did  not
disclose  the  debt  in  his  February  2021  SCA  or  recognize  it  during  his  March  2021
security  clearance  background  interview.  However,  with  his  Answer,  he  provided  a
statement from the collection agency showing that the debt had been paid in full shortly
after his interview. (GX 2)
Outside  of  the  accounts  alleged  in  the  SOR,  Applicant  has  no  additional
delinquent debts. An April 2022 earnings statement shows that he had an annual salary
of  about  $75,000.  In  May  2022,  he  submitted  a  budget  that  confirmed  his  salary  and
reflected  that,  after  paying  his  monthly  obligations,  he  maintained  a  net  remainder  of
about  $1,800  per month.  That budget  did  not  include  any  payment toward  his student
loans. (GX 4, 8)
Applicant  stated  that  his  intent  was  to  take  care  of  all  of  his  financial  issues
responsibility. He further stated that he was able to live within his means and described
his financial situation as “great.” (GX 2, 11)
