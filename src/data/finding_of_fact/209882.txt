In  his  Answer,  Applicant  admitted  to  all  the  allegations  in  the  SORwith
explanations.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and
testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  69-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed  with  the  defense  contractor  since  July  of  2020.  Applicant  is  separated  from
his spouse and has no children. He is retired from the U.S. Army. (TR at page 15 line 16
to  page  20  line  12,  and  GX  1  at  pages  7,  11  14  and  16.)  Applicant  attributes  his
admitted financial difficulties to a failed business.
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
2.a.   Applicant  admits  a  past-due  debt  to  Creditor  A  in  the  amount  of  about
$24,603.  He  attributes  this  debt  to  his  failed  business;  but  at  his  hearing,  he  was
informed by the undersigned, in no uncertain terms, that this was also a personal debt
that appears on his February 2023 credit report. (TR at page 27 line 5 to page 35 line
13, at page 50 line 12 to page 55 line 25, and GX 9 at page 5.) Despite having nearly
two  months  to  do  so,  Applicant  has  submitted  nothing  further,  other  than  argument,
regarding this past-due debt.
2.b.   Applicant  admits  a  past-due  debt  to  Creditor  B  in  the  amount  of  about
$11,881. He again attributes this debt to his failed business; but at his hearing, he was
informed, in no uncertain terms, that this was also a personal debt that appears on his
May 2022 credit report. (TR at page 43 lines 3~20, at page 50 line 12 to page 55 line
25,  and  GX  8  at  page  2.)  Despite  having  nearly  two  months  to  do  so,  Applicant  has
submitted nothing further, other than argument, regarding this past-due debt.
2.c.   Applicant  admits  a  past-due  debt  to  Creditor  C  in  the  amount  of  about
$8,478.  He  attributes  this  debt  to  his  failed  business;  but  at  his  hearing,  he  was
informed, in no uncertain terms, that this was also a personal debt that appears on his
February 2023 credit report. (TR at page 43 line 21 to page 45 line 1, at page 50 line 12
to  page 55  line  25,  and  GX  9  at page 4.)  Despite having  nearly  two  months to do  so,
Applicant  has  submitted  nothing  further,  other  than  argument,  regarding  this  past-due
debt.
Guideline E  - Personal Conduct
1.a.   On  his  September  2020  e-QIP,  Applicant  answered  “No”  to  “Section  26  –
Delinquency Involving Routine Accounts . . . In the last seven (7) years, have you had
(GX  1  at  pages  36~37.)
any  accounts  or  credit  card  suspended,  charged  off  .  .  .”
Applicant testified credibly that he thought the three past-due debts, noted above, were
business  debts  and  not  his  personal  debts.  As  such,  Applicant  answered  “No”  to  the
posited question. (TR at page 50 lines 6~9.)
