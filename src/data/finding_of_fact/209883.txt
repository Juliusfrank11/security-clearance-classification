Applicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security
clearance.  Admitted  facts  are  adopted  and  incorporated  by  reference.  Additional
findings of fact follow.
Background
Applicant  married  in  April  2018,  separated  the  same  year,  and  divorced  in
October 2020.  (GEs  1 and  5  and  AEs  A  and  D;  Tr.  27) He  has  two  children  from  this
marriage (ages one and two). GE 1; Tr. 53) He earned a bachelor’s degree in May 2014
and a master’s degree in May 2016. (GEs 1; Tr. 39, 41) He reported no military service.
Since  August  2019,  Applicant  has  worked  for  his  current  employer  as  a
manufacturing  engineer.  (GE  1;  Tr.  49)  Between  May  2014  and  September  2020,  he
worked  in  various  jobs  for  non-DoD  employers.  (GE  1)  He  has  never  held  a  security
clearance. (GE 1)
Applicant’s finances
Between   2015   and  2017,  Applicant  took  out   federal  and   state   student  loans  to
finance  his  undergraduate  and  graduate  education.  (GEs 1-5  and  AEs A-B  and  D-E; Tr.
29)  Burdened   by   child   support   and   other   financial  obligations   from   his   marriage,
Applicant  never   made   any   payments  on   his   student  loans.   (GEs   1-5;  Tr.   29-30)   After
receiving  billing  notices from  the  DoE  in  2017  and  2018, he  asked  for extensions before
putting   his  student  loans  aside   without  addressing   them.   (GE   5;  Tr.  31)  In   2022,
Applicant  received   a   letter notice  from   the  DoE   approving   him   for rehabilitation   status.
(AE   D;  Tr.  32)  Because   of  the   COVID-19   pause   in  place   at  the   time,   the   DoE   did  not
require upfront  loan payments from Applicant.  (AE D; Tr. 32)
Applicant  assured  that  he  would  be  able  to  make  his  payments  when  they
become  due  after  the  pause  is  lifted  in  September  2023.  (AEs  D  and  G;  Tr.  33)
Applicant’s  assurances  are  both  plausible  and  credible,  considering  all  of  the
extenuating  circumstances  associated  with  his  divorce,  pre-divorce  family  care,  and
child-rearing responsibilities he has assumed as a single parent, and are accepted.
Other  delinquent  debts  accumulated  by  Applicant  between  2016  and  2018  are
comprised of four consumer debts as follows: SOR ¶¶ 1.f (for $639); 1.g (for $463); 1.h
(for  $1,052);  and  1.i  (for  $921).  (GEs  2-5;  Tr.  33-48)  These  debts  exceed  $2,900
Applicant continues to dispute two of the debts, claiming identification theft with respect
to SOR  ¶  1.f  and a lack of familiarity with the debt covered by SOR ¶ 1.g. (GEs 3-5;
Tr.  35-36)  He  documented  a  payment  plan  with  SOR  ¶  1.h  that  calls  for  monthly
payments of $50 a month beginning in June 2023 (AE H; Tr. 37-38), and unsuccessful
efforts to make contact with SOR creditor ¶ 1.i (Tr. 37-38 and 41-42)
Applicant’s divorce and resulting single-parent responsibilities have been difficult
and  costly  for  him.  While  drug  tests  administered  to  his  ex-wife  produced  negative
results for marijuana and other illegal drugs (AE E), his ex-wife has been unable to meet
all  of  her  child  support  payment  obligations  due  to  periods  of  unemployment.  (Tr.  42)
When able, she contributes $900 a month for child support and splits the monthly costs
of medication for their children. (Tr. 42-43)
Applicant nets $3,300 a month and expends in excess of $2,500 a month on rent,
utilities, transportation, child-care, and food expenses. (AE I; Tr. 43-45) He estimated a
modest  monthly  remainder  to  cover  discretionary  expenditures.  (Tr.  45)  He  maintains
small  savings  and  checking  accounts  and  has  a  401(k)-retirement  account  with  an
estimated  $42,000  balance.  (Tr.  45)  With  his  solid  performance  ratings,  he  looks  to
receive promotions and raises in the future with his current employer. (AE J)
