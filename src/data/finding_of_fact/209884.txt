Applicant  admitted  to  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a.~1.c.  and  1.e.  He  denied
SOR allegations ¶ 1.d.  and 1.f., averring that these two past-due debts were charged
off. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  35-year-old  potential  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  is
currently  unemployed. (TR at  page 19  lines 3~17,  and  at  page 26 lines  14~17.)  He  is
unmarried, and has one child. (TR at page 5 line 9 to page 6 line 11, at page 12 line 9 to
page  13  line  20,  and  at  page  20  lines  7~18.)  Applicant  has  about  $100,000  worth  of
stock. (TR at page 22 line 13 to page 24 line 7.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
1.a.  Applicant  admits  a  past-due  debt  to  Creditor  A  in  the  amount  of  about
$11,915. (TR at page 19 line 19 to page 21 line 10.) As he has done nothing to address
this past-due debt, this allegation is found against Applicant.
1.b. Applicant admits a past-due debt to Creditor B in the amount of about $562.
(TR at page 21 line 11 to page 22 line 1.) As he has done nothing to address this past-
due debt, this allegation is found against Applicant.
1.c.  Applicant  admits  a  past-due  judgment  debt  to  Creditor  C  in  the  amount  of
about $5,420. (TR at page 24 lines 8~23.) As he has done nothing to address this past-
due debt, this allegation is found against Applicant.
1.d.  Applicant  denies  a  past-due  debt  to  Creditor  D  in  the  amount  of  about
$3,524. (TR at page 24 line 24 to page 25 line 4.) He avers that debt was charged off,
which is reflected in the SOR and on the Government’s most recent March 2023 credit
report  (CR).  (GX  1  at  page  6.)  Applicant’s  lack  of  action  is  not  a  good-faith  effort  to
address this past-due debt; and as such, this allegation is found against Applicant.
1.e.  Applicant  admits  a  past-due  mortgage  debt  to  Creditor  E  in  the  amount  of
about $4,578. (TR at page 24 line 25 to page 25 line 22.) He avers that he is “currently
on forbearance” as to this mortgage debt. As this mortgage debt appears as “Past Due”
in the amount of $6,105 on the Government’s most recent March 2023 credit report (GX
1 at page 4), this allegation is found against Applicant.
1.f.  Applicant  denies  a  past-due  debt  to  Creditor  F  in  the  amount  of  about
$13,846. (TR at page 24 line 24 to page 25 line 4.) He avers that debt was charged off,
which is reflected in the SOR and on the Government’s most recent March 2023 credit
report. (GX 1 at page 8.) Applicant’s lack of action is not a good-faith effort to address
this past-due debt; and as such, this allegation is found against Applicant.
