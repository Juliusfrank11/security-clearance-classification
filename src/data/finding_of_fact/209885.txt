Applicant  admitted  to  all  the  allegations  in  SOR.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  63-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed  with  the  defense  contractor  since  May  of  2013.  He  is  unmarried,  but  had  a
“significant  other  .  .  .  [of]  almost  20  years”  who  passed  away  in  January  of  2017.
Applicant  also  had  minor  heart  attacks  in  2016  and  2017,  which  caused  him  to  have
short  periods  of  unemployment.  His  current  financial  difficulties  were  caused  by  an
extended  period  of  depression,  due  to  the  loss  of  his  significant  other  more  than  six
years  ago.  (TR  at  page  13  line  13  to  page  23  line  13,  and  GX  1  at  pages  5,  11  and
17~18.)  Only  after  his  hearing  did  Applicant  begin
to  address  his  past-due
indebtedness.
