Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a government contractor for whom he has
worked since February 2022. He earned a bachelor’s degree in July 2014. He married
in 1997 and divorced in May 2016. He has two children, ages 25 and 18. He served with
the Army from 1995 until 2005, earning an honorable discharge. (Items 3, 4)
In  the  SOR,  the  Government  alleged  Applicant’s  two  delinquent  debts  totaling
approximately  $29,000.  These  delinquencies  consist  of  a  car  loan  (SOR  ¶  1.a)  and  a
credit  card  (SOR  ¶  1.b).  The  car  loan  comprises  about  $26,000  of  the  $29,000  total
SOR  indebtedness.  He  admitted  the  SOR  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  1.a  with  additional
comments  but  denied  the  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  1.b,  because  he  claimed  to  have  a
payment  arrangement  with  the  creditor.  His  admission  is  adopted  as  a  finding  of  fact.
Despite his denial, both SOR allegations are established through his admission and the
Government’s credit reports. (Items 2-8)
The  delinquent  car  loan  for  approximately  $26,212  listed  in  SOR  ¶  1.a  has  not
been resolved. Applicant purchased a vehicle in about February 2017, and he opened
this account to finance the purchase. The last payment date on the account was in April
2018. In his response to the SOR, he provided a letter from the creditor acknowledging
that it had received a dispute from a company purporting to act on his behalf. The letter
from the creditor stated that the dispute letter did not contain substantive evidence, did
not claim a specific dispute, and contained language  commonly used by  “purveyors of
fraudulent  credit  repair  schemes.”  Applicant  has  not  provided  any  other  evidence  of  a
dispute  or the basis for a dispute. He  failed to  provide  any documentary corroboration
that he set up a payment plan, or made a payment on this account. (Items 2-8)
The delinquent credit card for approximately $3,150 listed in SOR ¶ 1.b is being
resolved.  Applicant  became  delinquent  on  this  account  between  2016  and  2018.  In
about September 2022, he made a payment arrangement with the creditor. He made an
initial  payment  of  about  $600  and  then  has  made  monthly  payments  of  $150  through
March  2023.  He  provided  documentary  corroboration  of  these  payments.  Applicant
began  making  these  payments  after  he  submitted  his  February  2022  Electronic
Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (SF 86), after he was interviewed by a DOD
investigator, and after he responded to DOD interrogatories related to his repayment of
this and other debts. (Items 2, 4, 5, 7, 8)
Applicant  became  delinquent  on  the  SOR  debts  because  of  his  divorce  and
resulting  child  support  payments,  unemployment,  underemployment,  and  financially
assisting his chronically ill mother after his father passed away in 2016. In a September
2022  Personal  Financial  Statement,  he  claimed  that  he  has  about  $3,600  in  surplus
income each month, and that he will have an additional $600-per-month once his child
support  ended  in  May  2023.  This  surplus  includes  his  monthly  take-home  income  of
about  $4,000  that  he  started  earning  by  August  2022,  at  the  latest.  He  provided  no
evidence  that  he  has  undergone  financial  counseling  but  has  hired  at  least  two
companies to help him improve his credit score. Applicant did not respond to the FORM,
so more recent information about his finances is not available.  (Items 2, 4, 5)
