Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations in his Answer. He is 51 years old. He
married  in  2001,  divorced  in  2012,  and  remarried  in  2015.  He  has  two  children,  one
adult  and  one  minor.  He  earned  his  high  school  diploma  in  1990  and  an  associate
degree in 1992. He previously owned a home from October 2001 to September 2012.
As of his August 2020 security clearance application (SCA), he has owned his current
home since October 2018. (Items 1-5)
From  January  2002  to  September  2019,  Applicant  worked  as  an  engineering
technician  for  a  recruitment  company.  He  left  because  the  company  was  not  going  to
renew  his  contract  when  it  expired.  He  worked  for  a  previous  DOD  contractor  from
September  2019  to  May  2020.  As  of  his  SCA,  he  has  worked  as  an  engineering
technician for his current employer, another DOD contractor, since May 2020. He was
first granted a security clearance in approximately 2020. (Items 1-5)
The SOR alleges that Applicant filed chapter 7 bankruptcy in May 2013 and his
bankruptcy was discharged in September 2013. (SOR ¶ 1.a) It also alleges that he was
indebted in the amount of $1,257 for a state tax lien entered against him in about July
2022. (SOR ¶ 1.b) It also alleges that he had four delinquent consumer  debts, totaling
$23,395. (SOR ¶ 1.c-1.d, 1.f-1.g)  It also alleges that he owed $6,119 in delinquent child
support.  (SOR  ¶  1.e) The  allegations  are  established  by  Applicant’s  admissions  in  his
Answer,  his  SCA,  his  September  2020  background  interview,  a  Defense  Information
System  for  Security  (DISS)  March  2021  incident  report,  his  May  2021  response  to
interrogatories, bankruptcy records, a court record, and credit bureau reports from June
2021, May 2022, and May 2023. (Items 1-11)
Applicant  attributes  his  delinquent  debts  and  bankruptcy  to  his  divorce,  his
previous  minimal  income,  and  his  child  support  obligation.  Bankruptcy  records  reflect
that  he  claimed  approximately  $182,000  total  in  liabilities.  He  indicated,  during  his
background interview, that approximately $20,000 of the credit card debt discharged in
his bankruptcy was from his divorce. He also indicated that he was unable to pay seven
to  eight  months  of  his  monthly  child  support  obligation  beginning  in  approximately
August  2017,  due  to  minimal  income.  In  2019,  when  he  switched  jobs,  he  was  also
unable to pay several months of his child support. (Items 3-7)
Applicant  stated  in  his  2020  SCA,  during  his  background  interview,  and  in  his
response to interrogatories, that he began working with a debt consolidation company in
approximately  December  2019,  to  resolve  his  debts.  He  stated,  without  corroborating
documentation,  that  he  made  monthly  payments  of  $438  to  the  company,  who  was
negotiating with his creditors on his behalf. The May 2023 credit bureau report reflects
that he paid the debt in SOR ¶ 1.g, but it continues to report as delinquent the debts in
SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, and 1.f. (Items 3-7, 11)
Applicant  also  stated,  in  his  2020  SCA  and  during  his  2020  background
interview, that he was resolving his delinquent child support through the garnishment of
his wages, the interception of his tax refunds, and making extra payments per paycheck
toward his arrears. His April 2021 earnings statement reflects a garnishment of $357 for
child  support.  While  his  delinquent  child  support  was  reported  on  his  previous  credit
bureau  reports from  June  2021  and  May  2022,  it  was  no  longer  reported  on  the  most
recent credit bureau report from May 2023. (Items 3-6, 9-11)
Despite  his  financial  hardship,  Applicant  maintains  that  he  is  an  exceptional
employee.  He  looks  forward  to  a  long  and  successful  career  with  his  employer.  His
personal financial statement from May 2021 reflects a household monthly net income of
$4,900. He noted that $409 was being garnished from his wages for child support, and
he  was  allotting  $960  monthly  to  the  debt  consolidation  company.  After  his  monthly
household expenses, to include  payments toward his debts, he noted that his monthly
net  remainder  was  $1,044.  There  is  no  information  in  the  record  about  whether
Applicant has received credit counseling. (Item 6)
