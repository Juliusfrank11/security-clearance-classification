Applicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer or a predecessor company since 2018. He served on active duty in
the  U.S.  military  from  1994  until  he  retired  with  an  honorable  discharge  in  2014.  He
seeks to retain a security clearance, which he has held since he served in the military.
He  earned  an  associate  degree  in  2010,  and  he  has  additional  college  credits.  He  is
married with one child. (Transcript (Tr.) at 21-27; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1)
Applicant  is  a  native-born  U.S.  citizen.  He  met  his  wife  in  about  2006  while  he
was stationed in Turkey. They married in Turkey in 2007. His wife is a citizen of Turkey,
and his child is a U.S. citizen. His child has not been registered as a citizen of Turkey,
but  he  has  an  identification  card  from  Turkey.  (Tr.  at  29-30;  Applicant’s  response  to

Applicant’s  wife  and  child  moved  to  the  United  States  in  about  2014  when
Applicant  worked  in  the  United  States.  She  was  granted  permanent  resident  status
(green  card).  She  moved  to  Turkey  with  their  child  in  2015  when  Applicant  took  a
position overseas. She and their child have lived in Turkey since about 2015. Her green
card  will  expire  in  about  November  2023.  Because  she  has  not  resided  in  the  United
States since 2015, an immigration attorney advised him to let the green card expire and
apply for another one when he returns to live in the United States. (Tr. at 22-23, 28-34;

Applicant was stationed in Germany from 2011 to 2013. On numerous occasions,
he entered the women’s locker room at a gym on a NATO base, went into the gym bags
or  lockers  of  about  27  women,  and  stole  their  underwear.  He  was  caught  when  a

Applicant was punished  under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice
(UCMJ) in May 2013 for larceny of four pairs of underwear from a German female, one
pair of underwear from another German female, two pairs of underwear  from a British
female, and two pairs of underwear from a Dutch female. He was reduced a pay grade
to E-6, ordered to forfeit $1,000 per month for two months, and reprimanded. (Tr. at 23,
55; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3, 4)
Applicant stated that he did not know why he took the underwear, but it was not
for his sexual gratification. He has never received counseling to delve into the roots of
why he did so. He is ashamed of the conduct, and he has never informed his wife, his
family, or his friends about it. He stated that he has not stolen underwear since he was
caught. (Tr. at 55-57)
Applicant  worked  for  a  company  from  2014  to  2018.  He  resigned  in  lieu  of
termination after he was caught cheating on a certification examination when he brought
notes into the test center. He stated that he forgot the expiration date of the certification,
and he did not have time to prepare for the test. He admitted that it was a poor decision,
but  it  was  the  only  occasion  he  had  ever  cheated.  (Tr.  at  27,  50-53,  66;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 1, 2)
From about 2014 through January 2020, while Applicant was traveling on leave
from his job, he engaged in extramarital sexual relations with multiple foreign women in
Bulgaria, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Thailand. The women were not prostitutes,
and there was no money exchanged. It was consensual activities with adult women that
he met “[a]t a bar or on the street or restaurant or museum, wherever.” He did not have
any ongoing contact with the women after the sex. He informed his wife about the  sex
with  the  foreign  women  about  one  to  two  years  ago.  She  was  not  happy,  but  she
forgave him. (Tr. at 42-50, 66; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  admitted  that  he  made  poor  decisions,  but  he  stated  that  he  learned
from  his  mistakes,  and  none  of  the  conduct  will  be  repeated.  He  asserted  that  his
behavior has never affected his ability to protect classified information, and that he will
never  allow  his  conduct  to  be  used  to  extort  or  coerce  him  into  divulging  classified
information. (Tr. at 16, 66-67; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2)
