In  Applicant’s answer,  he  admitted  all of the allegations  in  the SOR,  except for  ¶¶
2.b   and   2.d,  which   he   denied.   I   adopt  his   admissions   as  findings   of  fact.   After  a
thorough   and   careful   review  of  the   pleadings  and   exhibits  submitted,   I  make   the
following  additional findings of fact.  (Item  2)
Applicant  is  38  years  old.  He  has  worked  for  his  current  employer,  a  federal
contractor,  since  March  2020.  That  contractor  is  subject  to  the  drug-free  workplace
provisions of 41 U.S.C. 701 et seq. He served in the U.S. Army from 2008 to 2012 and
was honorably discharged. He is married for the second time and has one child from his
second  marriage.  Applicant  is  a  high  school  graduate  and  has  taken  some  college
courses. (Item 3)
The SOR alleged, under Guideline J, that Applicant was charged with marijuana
possession  in  March  2004;  that  he  was  charged  with  marijuana  possession  in
November  2012;  and  that  he  was  charged  with  marijuana  and  Xanax  possession  in
October  2013.  (¶¶  1.a-1.c)  In  April  2017,  he  was  charged  with  felony  possession  of
dangerous  drugs,  including  marijuana.  He  was  convicted  of  possession  of  dangerous
drugs and received a sentence that included two years of probation, which was due to
expire in July 2023. (¶ 1.d)
The   SOR  alleged,  under Guideline   E,  that  Applicant  used  marijuana   on   various
occasions  between  2003  and  2017, and  that  he  sold  illegal drugs in  2017. (¶¶  2.a  and
2.c)   The   SOR  alleged   that   he   deliberately   provided   false  information   on   his  July  2008
and   his   February  2021   security   clearance   applications   (SCA)  when   asked   about   his
illegal drug  use  within the  last  seven  years of each  SCA listed  above.  (¶¶  2.b  and 2.d)
The   SOR  also  cross-alleged   all   the   allegations  listed   under  ¶¶   1.a-1.d   supra,   and   ¶¶
3.a-3.b, infra.
The SOR alleged, under Guideline F, that Applicant failed to timely file his 2013-
2019 federal income tax returns as required (SOR ¶ 3.a). It further alleged that he failed
to file his 2013-2019 state income tax returns as required  (SOR ¶ 3.b). The SOR also
alleged Applicant was indebted on six delinquent accounts. (¶¶ 3.c-3.h)
Criminal Conduct.
Applicant admitted all the allegations under Guideline J. In March 2004, he was
arrested  when  he  was  in  his  college  dorm  room  for  suspicion  of  marijuana  use.  The
arresting  officer  smelled  marijuana,  searched  his  room,  but  did  not  discover  any
marijuana.  He  was  jailed  until his hearing  where  the  charge  was dismissed for lack  of
evidence. (Items 2, 6, p. 6)
In  November  2012,  Applicant’s  car  was  stopped  by  a  police  officer.  The  officer
believed  he  smelled  marijuana  coming  from  Applicant  and  asked  to  search  his  car.
Applicant  consented  to  the  search,  but  no  marijuana  was  discovered.  Applicant  was
given a ticket for possession of marijuana and chose to pay a fine of $150  rather than
contest the case in court. (Item 6, p. 6)
In  October  2013,  Applicant’s  car  was  stopped  by  a  police  officer.  The  officer
believed he smelled marijuana coming from Applicant and asked to search his car. No
illegal drugs were found from the search. The officer wrote Applicant a ticket for illegal
possession  of  marijuana,  based  upon  the  officer’s  observations,  and  for  illegal
possession  of  Xanax,  based  again  on  the  officer’s  observations.  Applicant  contested
these charges and they were dismissed by a judge. (Item 6, p. 7)
In April 2017, local police arrived at Applicant’s residence with a search warrant.
They  discovered  a  prescription  for  OxyContin,  in  his  girlfriend’s  name,  and  seven
ounces  of  marijuana.  He  told  the  police  he  took  the  OxyContin  for back  pain.  He  was
arrested at the time, then released.  He was charged with various felony drug charges,
including  sale  of  marijuana,  and  possession  and  use  of  marijuana  and  OxyContin.  In
April  2021,  he  pleaded  guilty  to  lesser  charges  and  was  sentenced  to  60  days  in  jail
(deferred),  two  years  of  probation,  and  fines  and  court  fees.  Probation  was  to  end  in
July 2023. There is no evidence as to the current status of his probation. (Items 6 (p. 5,
6, 13), 7-8)
Personal Conduct.
Applicant  admitted  his  use  of  marijuana  from  2003  to  2017,  and  his  sale  of
marijuana  in  2017.  He used  marijuana  recreationally  during  his high  school years  and
through the years until March 2017. He asserts that he stopped using and possessing
drugs after his felony arrest in 2017. He further asserts he has no future intent to use or
possess illegal drugs. (Items 2, 6, p. 6, 11-12)
In Applicant’s July 2008 SCA, he marked “No” to the question of whether he had
illegally  used  any  controlled  substances  within  the  last  seven  years.  In  an  earlier
question  in  the  SCA  asking  about  his  police  record,  he  identified  a  2004  arrest  for
possession  of  marijuana.  In  his SOR  answer,  he  denied  this  allegation  stating  that  he
either misread or misunderstood the question. (Item 2, 4 (pp. 25-26 of 29))
In  Applicant’s  February  2021  SCA,  he  marked  “No”  to  questions  of  whether  he
had  illegally  used,  possessed,  or  sold  any  controlled  substances  within  the  last  seven
years. In an earlier question in the SCA asking about his police record, he identified a
2004  arrest  for  possession  of  marijuana,  his  2012  arrest  for  possession  of  marijuana,
and  his  2017  felony  arrest  for  various  marijuana  possession  and  sale  charges.  In  his
SOR answer, he denied this allegation stating that he either misread or misunderstood
the question. (Item 2, 3 (pp. 47-50 of 61))
The  arrests  discussed  supra  under  criminal  conduct  were  also  crossed  alleged
under Guideline E. (See ¶ 2.e)
Financial Considerations.
Applicant admitted failing to timely file his 2013 to 2019 federal and state income
tax returns. He stated that in 2013 he became homeless and did not have an address
where  his  IRS  W-2  tax  form  could  be  sent.  He  was  unemployed  from  August  2012  to
January  2014.  He  claims  he  did  not  have  the  means  to  pay  his  taxes  during  this
timeframe. In his February 2021 SCA, he stated that he finally had the means to file his
delinquent tax returns. He stated, “I had planned to handle it and [sic] the beginning of
the  tax  year  with  a  tax  lawyer.”  He  failed  to  provide  any  evidence  that  his  2013-2019
federal  and  state  tax  returns  have  been  filed.  IRS  tax  transcripts,  generated  in  July
2022,  for  tax  years  2018  and  2019,  show  that  no  returns  were  filed  for  those  years.
Applicant’s tax filings for 2013-2019 have not been resolved. (Items  2, 3  (pp. 52-55 of
61), 5-6)
Applicant admitted owing on six delinquent debts totaling approximately $11,976.
All the debts appear on his credit reports. He stated in his background interview that his
intention was to pay the debts now that he had a well-paying job. He failed to present
any evidence reflecting the current status of these debts or if he had made any efforts to
resolve them. These debts are unresolved. (Items 2, 6, 9-11)
Applicant  has  not  received  financial  counseling  and  he  presented  no  budgetary
information. (Item 6)
