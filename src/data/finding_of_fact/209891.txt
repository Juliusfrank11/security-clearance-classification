Applicant  admitted  to  all  the  allegations  in  the  SOR,  with  explanations.  After  a
thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  testimony,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  48-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed  with  the  defense  contractor  since  January  of  2022.  He  is  married,  and  has
adult  children.  (TR  at  page  13  line  21  to  page  18  line  23,  and  GX  1  at  pages  5,  10,
18~19  and  23~25.)  He  attributes  his  financial  difficulties  to  extensive  periods  of
unemployment that are not reflected on his e-QIP. (GX 1 at pages 10~14)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
1.a. Applicant admits that he has a past-due debt to Creditor A in the amount of
about  $10,699.  Despite  having  an  extra  three  months  to  do  so,  he  has  submitted
nothing further regarding the debt. (TR at page 19 line 24 to page 22 line 20.)
1.b.  Applicant admits that he has a past-due debt to Creditor B in the amount of
about $9,404. Despite having an extra three months to do so, he has submitted nothing
further regarding the debt. (TR at page 23 line 17 to page 24 line 12.)

by documentation. (TR at page 24 lines 13~19, at page 27 line 24 to page 28 line 22,
and AppX B.)

four payments of $376. He has made two payments with two payments remaining to be
made. (TR at page 24 lines 20~22, and PHXs E and F.)

by Applicant, with an address and phone number. (AppX A at page 4.)
