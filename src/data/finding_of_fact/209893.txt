In Applicant’s answer, he admitted one of the allegations in the SOR (¶ 1.a), and
denied the other allegation (¶ 1.b). He also provided some explanation for his conduct. I
adopt  his  admission  as  a  finding  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. (Items
1, 3)
Applicant is 25  years  old.  He  is single,  never has married,  and  has no  children.
He  has  worked   as   a   network  technician   for his  current  employer,   a   federal   contractor,
since  March  2022.  That contractor is subject  to  the  drug-free  workplace  provisions  of  41
U.S.C.  701   et  seq.   Applicant   completed   his  academic   requirements  for  his   bachelor’s
degree, but as of  May 2022, it had not been  awarded.  (Items  4,  5)
The  SOR  alleged,  under  Guideline  H,  that  Applicant  used  and  purchased
marijuana  from  May  2015  to  at  least  May  2022  (SOR  ¶  1.a).  It  also  alleged  that
Applicant  used  marijuana  after  completing  a  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  on
April 7, 2022 (SOR¶ 1.b)
Applicant  admitted  his  marijuana  use  in  his  April  2022  SCA,  his  May  2022
personal  subject  interview  (PSI)  with  an  investigator,  and  in  his  March  2023  SOR
answer. In his SOR answer, he denied using and purchasing marijuana after completing
his SCA in April 2022. He previously admitted using marijuana through May 2022 during
his PSI. (Items 3-5)
During Applicant’s PSI, he stated that his marijuana use started in approximately
2014-2015 after he fell off a truck and injured his back.  He admitted not getting proper
medical  treatment  for  his  injury  and  instead  started  using  marijuana  for  pain
management. In approximately June 2015, he began getting marijuana from his friends
and smoking it to alleviate his back pain. He used marijuana irregularly from June 2015
to August 2016. He abstained from August 2016 to  March 2017. After March 2017, he
started using marijuana on weekends sporadically. This frequency of use continued until
December  2018  when  he  stopped  again.  From  March  2020  until  the  time  of  his  PSI
(May 2022), he used marijuana on weekdays. (Item 5)
In  June  2018,  he  was  ticketed  for  possession  of  marijuana  because  his
passenger had lit up a marijuana joint just as the police officer arrived. The charge was
dismissed when his friend admitted ownership of the marijuana. (Item 5)
Applicant  provided  medical  information,  attached  to  his  SOR  answer,  that
described  his  back  pain  issues.  The  doctor  performing  the  more  recent  examination
(sometime in 2021) came up with a plan that he should seek a surgery consult, or if no
surgery was recommended, he should start physical therapy. No further information was
provided. (Item 3)
To  help  with  his back pain,  Applicant  claims  he  now  follows his  doctor’s  advice
regarding pain management, performs yoga, wears a back brace, uses a massage gun,
meditates daily, uses CBD cream, and stretches. (Item 3)
