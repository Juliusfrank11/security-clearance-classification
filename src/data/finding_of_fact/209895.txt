Applicant  is  a  36-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  A  previous
employer  sponsored her for a security  clearance. A  security  clearance  is unnecessary
for her current job, but her employer is sponsoring her for a public trust position. She is
a  high  school  graduate.  She  married  in  2008  and  divorced  in  2018.  She  has  two
children. Applicant has legal custody of her older child and joint custody of her younger
child, but the children primarily live with her ex-husband. She has lived with her fiancé
for more than six years. (Tr. at 6-9, 17-21, 35-36; GE 1)
The SOR alleges 15 delinquent debts totaling about $44,000. Applicant admitted
owing  all the debts.  The  debts  are  also  listed  on  one  or more  credit  reports from  May
2020, July 2022, or January 2023. (GE 3-5)
Applicant  is  required  to  pay  $224  per  month  in  child  support  for  her  younger
child. Credit reports show balances of $4,427 in May 2020; $11,026 in July 2022; and
$12,331  in  January  2023  (SOR  ¶  1.j).  Her  pay  is  garnished  by  the  court  for  the  child
support.  The  January  2023  credit  report  shows  a  payment  of  $313,  which  means  a
portion is going to the arrearages. (Tr. at 19-22; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3-5)
SOR  ¶  1.b  alleges  a $3,057  delinquent  debt.  Applicant  stated  the debt  was  the
financing  for  a  new  sofa  that  she  bought  or  rented.  Not  too  long  after  the  sofa  was
delivered, she discovered bedbugs in the sofa. The furniture store refused to accept the
sofa  as  a  return.  She  did  not  feel  like  she  should  have  to  pay  for  a  sofa  that  had
bedbugs. (Tr. at 25-26; GE 3-5)
Applicant admitted that she was financially irresponsible when she was younger,
and she “made some dumb decisions.”  Other than her child support, she has not  paid
any of the SOR debts. She is hoping to devise a plan to pay her debts. Her only current
plan  is  to  wait  for  them  to  fall  off  her  credit  report.  She  has  not  received  credit
counseling. (Tr. at 16, 24-25, 27-36; GE 3-5)
