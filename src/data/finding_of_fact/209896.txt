Applicant is a 29-year-old engineer currently sponsored by a defense contractor.
He  graduated  from  high  school  in  May  2012,  and  subsequently  enrolled  in  a  full-time
university program of study in June 2012. He completed the program in May 2017, and
was awarded a bachelor’s degree. Applicant has never been married and does not have
children.
From  about  January  2015  through  about  May  2017,  Applicant  participated  in  a
special university work experience program for engineering majors. In this program, he
was paid as an employee of the university, but physically worked part-time with a defense
contractor. (Item 4 at 12; and Item 10 at 1) In February 2017, he completed his first SCA,
sponsored by the same defense contractor. After graduation in May 2017, he was hired
as a full-time employee of the same defense contractor. (Item 4 at 12, and Item 10 at 1)
He began working as a mechanical engineering associate at that time. (Item AE-A at 1)
In  his  February  2017  SCA,  Applicant  disclosed  he  used  marijuana  from  August
2012  through  December  2016,  describing  his  marijuana  use  as  “sporadic”  throughout
college  and  occurring  mostly  during  summer  and  winter  breaks.  (Item  4  at  26)  He
responded “no” to the question of whether he intended to continue using marijuana in the
future, explaining:
It's [not] worth risking my future career to get high. None of my successful
family  members  smoke  marijuana;  many  of  my  not  so  successful  family
members do; makes the decision easy.
Applicant provided additional details regarding his marijuana use during his May
2018 interview with a DOD investigator. (Item 10 at 2) He disclosed he used marijuana
for the first time in the spring of 2012. He smoked it socially with a friend who provided it
in the form of a “bong.” He continued to smoke marijuana through December 2016 with
the same friend. They smoked it about once a month at his friend’s house. He disclosed
that  using  marijuana  made  him  laugh  and  feel  happy.  He  stated  he  stopped  using
marijuana because he desired to find a good job and to have a good career. He shared
that he witnessed relatives unable to have good careers because of marijuana use. He
stated he would not use marijuana in the future. (Item 10 at 2)
Applicant  became  eligible  for  access  to  classified  information  in  July  2018,
following  the  DOD  CAS’s  favorable  adjudication  of  his  SCA.  He  was  granted  a  DOD
security  clearance  on  July  14,  2018,  and  signed  a  DOD non-disclosure  agreement  on
July 27, 2018. (Item 5) He disclosed he was submitted for a top-secret security clearance
in February 2022. (Item AE-A at 1)
Applicant  completed  a  second  SCA  in  February  2022,  sponsored  by  the  same
defense contractor. (AE-A at 1; and Item 9 at 5) He disclosed he used marijuana starting
in August 2012 and continuing through July 2021. (Item 3 at 25 through 26). When asked
whether he used marijuana while possessing a security clearance, he responded “yes.”
When asked whether he intended to use marijuana in the future, he responded “yes,” and
explained:
Possibly  in  social  settings,  but  not  worth  the  ordeal  to  purchase  and
consume at my home. If legalized it is much more likely.
In  his  March  2022  interview  with  a  DOD  investigator,  Applicant  disclosed  he
smoked marijuana in cigar form, from about August 2012 through about July 2021. While
in college from August 2012 through May 2017, he stated he smoked marijuana with a
friend socially about twice a month. After college from May 2017 through July 2021, he
stated he smoked marijuana about twice a year. He also admitted he smoked marijuana
while possessing a security clearance. He stated he smoked marijuana with a friend who
supplied it, asserting he never purchased it.
Applicant has maintained close in-person contact with the same friend. He stated
he stopped smoking marijuana because he could not smoke it legally, but he intends to
use marijuana in the future because he enjoyed it. He stated he experienced no negative
consequences as a result of using marijuana, and denied being dependent on it. He never
tested positive for marijuana use; nor has he been ordered to attend drug-related classes.
(Item 9 at 5-6)
In his January 2023 response to the SOR, Applicant, for the first time, asserted he
used the Delta-8 THC products “beginning during the pandemic lockdown and periodically
afterwards in social settings . . . .” (Item 2. See also Items 2, and AE-A compared to Items
3,  4,  9,  and  10)  Delta-8  THC  products  are  not  considered  federally  illegal  under  the
Controlled Substances Act if it is determined to contain less than 0.3% delta-9 THC, the
psychoactive ingredient in marijuana. (Items 6 through 8) He previously stated in his 2018
and 2022 DOD interviews, that his friend or friends provided the marijuana he used, and
that he never purchased it. (Items 9 and 10).
In  April  2023,  Applicant  submitted  a  document  in  evidence  in  response  to  this
FORM, Item AE-A. He stated he no longer intended to use marijuana in the future, and
referenced comments he made in his response to the SOR. (Item AE-A at 2) He stated
he is in a serious romantic relationship that he hopes will lead to marriage, and because
of this, he wished to amend his claim that he would use marijuana in the future if it were
legalized.  He  stated  he  “does  not  plan  to  use  marijuana  illegally  again  since  ceasing
usage (in) prior to graduating college in 2017.” (Item AE-A at 2) He commented as follows:
[He] has not used Delta-8 THC products since July 2021 when he learned
that this was a substance prohibited under DoD Guidelines. This fact was
stated  in  [his]  reply  to  the  SOR  but  was  seemingly  misconstrued  by  the
investigator.  [He]  only  used  Delta-8  THC  a  few  times  –  maybe  twice  per
month at most – from the summer of 2020 through July 2021.
For SOR ¶ 1.a, Applicant admitted to using marijuana, from August 2012 to July
2021, but qualified his admission, stating “… usage after roughly 2014 (beginning around
the  middle  of  2020)  would  be  limited  to  the  federally  legal  Delta-8  THC  [marijuana]
products.”  (Item  2) As stated  above,  this is the  first time  Applicant has  claimed  to  use
Delta-8 THC products. (See Items 2, 3, 4,9, 10, and AE-A)
For  SOR  ¶¶  1.b  and  1.c,  Applicant  denied  the  allegations,  reiterating  he  used
federally  legal  “Delta-8  THC  products”  beginning  during  the  pandemic,  and  socially
afterwards.
For SOR ¶ 1.d, Applicant denied his intention to use marijuana in the future. He
sought to clarify previous statements he made, emphasizing that he would use marijuana
in the future “if legal,” stating he had no current plans to use marijuana in the immediate
future. (Item 2) Applicant previously disclosed his intention to use marijuana in the future
in his February 2022 SCA, and his March 2022 interview with a DOD investigator. (Items
4 and 9)
