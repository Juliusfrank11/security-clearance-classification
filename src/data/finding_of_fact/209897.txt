Applicantâ€™s finances
Records  document  that  Applicant  did  not  timely  file  his  federal   and   state   tax
returns,  as  required, for tax  years 2012  through   2014.  ((Items  2-7)  Applicant  attributed
his tax-filing  lapses to  financial  issues  related  to  his  child  support obligations.  (Items  3-
7) He confirmed  his  receipt  of a  notice  from  the   IRS  about starting  a  payment  plan  on
his  estimated   owed   back  taxes  in  excess  of  $40,000.   (Item   3)  In   his  response   to   the
SOR, he  confirmed  only that  he  returned  the  file to  the  IRS  for unstated  reasons.  (Item
2) Whether he  ever filed  federal and  state  tax returns and  paid any taxes owed  for the
specified years  in question is  unknown.
With  a  lengthy  history  of  problems  with  his  debts  (inclusive  of  judgments  and
accounts  in  collection),  Applicant  petitioned  for  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  relief  in  June
1999.  (Items  5-6,  8,  and  13-14)  He  received  a  bankruptcy  discharge  in  September
1999. (Items 13-14) Still faced with lingering financial problems associated with his child
support obligations,  Applicant petitioned again  for Chapter 13 bankruptcy  relief in  May
2013 and was granted a discharge in August 2013. (Items 3 and 15)
To  date,  Applicant  has  failed  to  provide  documentary  proof  of  filing  his  federal
and  state  income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2012-2014.  Nor  has  he  provided  any
documentary proof of paying federal and state taxing authorities for any taxes owed for
the 2012-2014 tax years.  Explanations of the  circumstances of his failure to file timely
federal  and  state  tax  returns  for  the  years  in  question  are  limited  to  his  expressed
difficulties in dealing with his child support obligations.
