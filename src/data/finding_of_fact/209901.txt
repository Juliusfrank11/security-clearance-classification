Applicant  is  25  years  old.  He  has  never  been  married  and  does  not  have  any
children.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2019.  Based  on  his  most  recent  security
clearance application (SCA) he completed in April 2022, he was currently enrolled in a
master’s  program.  Since  August  2020,  he  has  worked  for  a  federal  contractor  as  an
associate  reliability  engineer.  On  November  2,  2020,  he  was  given  an  indoctrination
briefing  after  he  was  granted  a  secret-level  DOD  security  clearance  in  October  2020.

Drug  Involvement and Substance  Misuse  and Personal Conduct
The SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant has used marijuana from about
October 2017 to June 2021. (SOR ¶ 2.a) He has used methylenedioxy-methamphetamine
(MDMA, or Ecstasy) from June 2018 to November 2019. (SOR ¶ 2.b) He used cocaine in
October 2019. (SOR ¶ 2.c) He used lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in May 2020. (SOR
¶  2.d)  Applicant  used  marijuana  in  June  2021  while  he  had  access  to  classified
information after his secret-level security clearance was granted in October 2020. (SOR
¶ 2.e) He admitted all of the allegations in his February 2023 Answer. He also stated that
most  drug  uses  were  experimental  in  nature  and  occurred  infrequently  while  he  was
immature and attending college. He believed his voluntary disclosure of his dishonesty to
his federal contractor employer in 2021 should be viewed in his favor. (Item 2)
On July 4, 2020, Applicant completed a SCA, as part of his employment process
with a federal contractor. Under Section 23 – illegal drug use or drug activity, he failed to
disclose his illegal drug use, as required. (SOR ¶ 1.a.) A background interview was not
conducted  as  part  of  Applicant’s  security  clearance  investigation.  As  stated  above,
Applicant  started  employment  with  the  federal  contractor  in  August  2020,  and  he  was
granted a DOD security clearance in October 2020. (Item 4, Item 6)
In  about  November 2021,  Applicant applied  for and  was  offered employment  at
another facility with his employer. Applicant accepted the job offer, and then he contacted
the facility security officer (FSO) at his new employment location and disclosed that he
had  used  illegal  drugs  that  he  had  not  previously  disclosed  on  his  July  2020  SCA.
Applicant told the FSO that he did not disclose his illegal drug use because he did not
want the adverse information to prevent him from obtaining employment with the federal
contractor. His last use of marijuana occurred in June 2021 after he had been hired and
granted a Secret security clearance. On November 22, 2021, the FSO created an Incident
Report  in  the  Defense  Information  System  for  Security  (DISS),  reporting  the  adverse
information provided by Applicant. The FSO also rescinded Applicant’s job offer. (Item 6,
Item 7)
Applicant  was  asked  to  complete  another  SCA,  which  he  did  in  April  2022.  He
disclosed  on  this  SCA  that  he  had  used  marijuana  approximately  10  times  between
October 2017 and June 2021. He used MDMA, commonly referred to as Ecstasy, four or
five times between June 2018 and November 2019. He used cocaine on one occasion in
November 2019, and LSD on one occasion in May 2020. He stated that he had no intent
to use illegal drugs in the future. (Item 3)
In September 2022, Applicant participated in a background interview with a DOD
authorized  investigator.  Applicant  disclosed  that  he  was  working  for  his  employer  in  a
current position that did not require a DOD security clearance. His last use of marijuana
was in edible form in June 2021, while he was employed and possessing a Secret security
clearance. He understood that marijuana use, in any form, is prohibited by Federal law.
He told the investigator that he did not disclose his illegal drug use on his July 2020 SCA
because he really wanted the job and did not think his illegal drug use was “a big deal.”
He reiterated that he does not intend to use illegal drugs again. (Item 5)
Applicant  submitted  two  character  reference  letters  that  were  provided  by  two
managers with his current employer. One manager stated that Applicant reported to her
from  August  2020  until  June  2022.  He  displayed  sound  technical  judgment  and
successfully completed his responsibilities correctly and on schedule. She became aware
of the DISS adverse incident report around Thanksgiving 2021. Applicant never exhibited
any  behavior  that  would  cause  her  to  question  his  credibility,  or  his  ability  to  protect
classified information. She does not  expect he will use illegal substances in the future,
and  she  believed  that  when  he  initially  completed  his  SCA  in  July  2020,  he  was  still
immature. She listed that research has shown the pre-frontal cortex of the brain does not
complete its growth until the early to mid-20’s. This portion of the brain is responsible for
reasoning,  judgment,  planning,  and  impulse  control.  The  second  manager  stated  that
Applicant has been part of the quality engineering team since mid-2022. Applicant has
displayed consistent discipline and a high commitment to the team’s mission. (AE A, AE
