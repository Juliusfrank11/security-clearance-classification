In  Applicant’s  SOR  response,  he  admitted  all  SOR  allegations.  (HE  3)  His
admissions are accepted as findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  53-year-old   nuclear  engineer  who   has  worked   for  his  current
employer since  1999. (Tr. 6, 10; GE  1  at 11) In  1988, he graduated from high school (Tr.
7) In  2000, he  was awarded  a  bachelor’s degree  in engineering  technology, and  in 2013,
he received  a master’s degree in  divinity. (Tr. 7)
Applicant  served   in   the   Navy   from   1988   to   1994,  and   his  specialty  was   nuclear
electrician’s mate. (Tr. 9) He received  an  honorable discharge  from  the  Navy as  a  petty
officer second  class (E-5). (Tr. 9) In  1993, he  married, and  his two  children  are ages  16
and  19. (Tr. 8)
Financial Considerations
Applicant  said   his  annual  pay  is  about  $56,000.   (Tr.  48)  Since   the   start  of  the
COVID  19   pandemic,  his  salary  has  increased   $25,000.  (Tr.  49)  His  spouse’s  annual
salary is about $60,000. (Tr. 49) He has about $200,000  in  his 401k retirement  account.
(Tr. 54) He  recently borrowed  $50,000  from  his  401k  account to  finance  his  daughter’s
education.  (Tr.  55)  He   attributed   his  financial  problems  to   “lack  of  financial  discipline”;
however,  he   has  learned   from   his  mistakes,  and   he   believes  that  he   is  now  more
financially responsible. (Tr. 58) The SOR alleges the following financial concerns:
SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b  allege  Applicant  failed  to  file  as  required  federal  and  state
income tax returns for tax years (TY) 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018. He stopped filing his
tax returns in 2016 because he expected to receive a refund and did not believe it was a
“big issue.” (Tr. 21-22) He said he may have timely filed a tax return for TY 2017, and he
acknowledged that he failed to timely file tax returns for TYs 2015, 2016, 2018, and 2019.
(Tr. 23)
In  Applicant’s  November  22,  2019  SCA,  he  disclosed  that  he  filed  his  federal
income tax returns for TYs 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 in October 2019 (GE 1 at 30-31)
For TY 2015, he made a partial payment of $300 to address his federal income tax debt;
for TY 2016, he owed $1,375; for TY 2017, he owed $2,700; and for TY 2018, $65,000
(estimated). (Id.)
In  Applicant’s  March17, 2020  Office of Personnel Management (OPM)  personal
subject interview, he explained the $65,000 listed in his SCA that he said he owed for TY
2018 was an error, and the correct amount was $4,000. (GE 2 at 4) He said he filed his
tax returns for TYs 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 by 2020. (Id.) He had not filed his state
income tax returns for TYs 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018; however, he planned to file those
state income tax returns when he files his TY 2019 federal income tax return. (Id.) He
owed the IRS a total of $6,600, and he has a payment plan with the IRS. (Id.)
In  Applicant’s  September  2,  2020  response  to  DOHA  interrogatories,  Applicant
said he filed his federal income tax returns on the following dates: TY 2015 (January 24,
2020); TY 2016 (October 20, 2019); TY 2017 (no date); and TY 2018 (October 21, 2019).
(GE  2  at  8)  He  owed  the  IRS  $6,173.  (Id.)  His  state  income  tax  returns  were  filed  on
August 31, 2020, and he does not owe any state income taxes. (GE 2 at 10) His August
13, 2020 IRS tax transcript for TY 2015 indicates no tax return was filed, and the IRS sent
a  notice  to  Applicant  on  November  11,  2019.  (Id.  at  11)  He  subsequently  provided
documentation from the IRS which indicated his tax debt for TY 2015; however, it did not
show when he filed his TY 2015 tax return.
Applicant  and  his  spouse’s  August  13,  2020  IRS  tax  transcripts  for  TYs  2016,
2017, and 2018 show the following information (amounts rounded to nearest $1,000) (AE

Applicant said he was not cheating the government, and at most he was cheating
himself  out  of  potential  refunds.  (Tr.  22)  When  he  was  completing  a  student-loan
application  for  his  eldest  child,  he  was  supposed  to  provide  tax  information  to  the
Department of Education, and this requirement triggered a desire to get his tax returns
filed.  (Tr.  22)  All  federal  and  state  tax  returns  are  filed.  (Tr.  23-24,  44-45)  He  owed
delinquent taxes for the last four years, and his current total, which includes a tax debt for
2020, is about $5,000. (Tr. 22, 24-25, 27) He has a $100 monthly payment plan with the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and his payments are current. (Tr. 24-25; GE 2 at 20-21)
He does not owe the state for income taxes. (Tr. 24) Applicant filed his tax returns for TY
2022 in July 2023. (Tr. 28) He owed several thousand dollars for TY 2022, and he paid
the IRS when he filed his TY 2022 tax return. (Tr. 28-29)
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges Applicant has a charged-off debt for $18,287. He borrowed the
funds to replace the roof or siding on his residence 10 years ago. (Tr. 31, 35) He believed
payments of about $200 monthly were being made directly from his or his spouse’s bank
accounts  for  “well  beyond  seven  years.”  (Tr.  31,  33,  35-36)  He  believed  the  loan  was
paid.  (Tr.  836)  His  spouse  contacted  the  creditor,  and  the  creditor  wanted  a  single
payment  of  75  percent  of  the  balance  or  to  make  monthly  payments  and  pay  the  full
balance. (Tr. 32-33) He said the current balance is about $12,000 or $13,000. (Tr. 34) His
September 2, 2022 credit report shows the balance is $13,787. (Tr. 45; GE 3 at 6) He is
credited with mitigating this debt because he reduced the balance by almost $5,000.
SOR  ¶¶  1.d  through  1.j  allege  Applicant  has  seven  Department  of  Education
(DoED)  debts  placed  for  collection  totaling  $72,996  for  $16,768,  $15,472,  $14,524,
$8,516, $7,990, $7,963, and $1,763. About $16,000 of his student-loan debt resulted from
his  undergraduate  education,  and  the  remainder  of  the  debt  was  from  Applicant’s
master’s degree program, and the loans were borrowed from around 2009 to 2012. (Tr.
37, 46) He stopped making payments in 2014 because the creditor’s proposed payment
plan of about $740 monthly was unaffordable. (Tr. 37, 41, 47) In 2016 or 2017, Applicant
was working with the creditor to arrange a payment plan based on his income. (Tr. 40)
Under the proposed payment plan, the monthly payment was unaffordable. (Tr. 40-41)
There was a four-year gap from 2014 to 2018 in which he did not make any payments.
(Tr. 48) In late 2018 or early 2019, DoED garnished $940 monthly from Applicant’s pay.
(Tr. 38-39; GE 1; GE 2) He investigated a post-COVID 19 rehabilitation plan. (Tr. 38, 42)
He is waiting for the documentation from the government to start a rehabilitation plan. (Tr.
38, 41) He has set aside $4,500 for the student-loan payment plan. (Tr. 38, 43)
On March 13, 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the President placed
federal student loans in deferment, and the interest rate was zero during the deferment
term. See DoEd website, “COVID-19 Loan Payment Pause and 0% Interest,” available at
https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19/payment-pause-zero-interest#in-
school-zero-interest. (HE 5) In 2022, the President approved one-time debt relief on DoEd
loans  of  $10,000.  See  DoEd  website,  “One-time  Federal  Student  Loan  Debt  Relief,”
available  at  https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/debt-relief-
info. (HE 6)The federal courts issued a stay on this $10,000 debt relief. The President
repeatedly extended the deferment.
The federal government’s Income-Based Repayment (IBR) is a program that caps
a creditor’s monthly student-loan payment based on income, and then forgives whatever
is still owed after 20 or 25 years. The monthly payments are revised on an annual basis
under the category of Revised Pay As You Earn (REPAYE). Under the REPAYE and IBR
plans,  borrowers provide  information  about  their income,  and  the student-loan  creditor
determines the amount they can pay under a formula provided by the DoEd. For married
borrowers, the income and student-loan debt of both spouses is considered together to
determine  the  monthly  payment  (with  limited  exceptions).  The  Federal  Student  Aid
website, “Do  you  have  questions about  the  different  types of  income-driven repayment
plans?,”
https://studentaid.gov/manage-
loans/repayment/plans/income-driven/questions, states as follows:
webpage,
available
at
•   For   the  IBR  Plan,   your   monthly   payment  amount   is  10   percent  of   your
discretionary   income  if   you’re  a  new   borrower  on  or   after   July   1,   2014.   If
you’re not a  new  borrower,  your  monthly  payment  amount  under the IBR Plan
is 15 percent of your discretionary income.
Example
•   You   are  single   and   your   family   size   is  one.   You   live  in   one  of   the   48
contiguous states or the District of Columbia. Your AGI is $40,000.
•   You have $45,000 in eligible federal student loan debt.
•   150  percent of  the 2022  HHS  Poverty  Guideline amount  for  a family  of  one
in   the  48   contiguous  states  and   the  District   of   Columbia  is  $20,385.   The
difference  between your  AGI  and  150  percent of  the Poverty  Guideline  amount
is $19,615. This is your  discretionary income.
•   If you’re repaying under the REPAYE  Plan,  the PAYE  Plan,  or  (if you’re a new
borrower)   the  IBR  Plan,   the  calculation  works  like  this:  10   percent  of   your
discretionary   income  is  $1,961.50.   Dividing   this  amount   by   12   results  in   a
monthly payment of $163.45.
•   If you  are repaying under the IBR Plan and  you’re not a new  borrower,  the
calculation  works  like   this:  15   percent  of   your   discretionary   income  is
$2,942.25,   and   dividing   this  amount   by   12   results  in   a  monthly   payment  of
$245.19.  (HE 7)
On August 24, 2022, the White House announced a new plan to assist student-
loan borrowers:
Make  the  student-loan  system  more  manageable  for  current  and  future
borrowers by:
Cutting  monthly payments in half for undergraduate  loans. The  Department
of Education  is proposing  a  new income-driven  repayment plan  that protects
more low-income  borrowers from  making  any payments and  caps monthly
payments  for  undergraduate   loans  at  5%  of  a   borrower’s  discretionary
income—half  of  the  rate  that borrowers must  pay now under most existing
plans.  This  means  that  the   average   annual  student-loan   payment  will   be
lowered by more than  $1,000  for both current and future borrowers.

On June  30, 2023, in Biden v. Nebraska, 22-506, the Supreme Court struck down
the   President’s  loan   forgiveness  plan.  However,  the   DoEd   announced   the   federal
government is  working  on  new  plans to  assist borrowers in  resolving  their  student-loan
debts.
The  Public  Service  Loan  Forgiveness  (PSLF)  program  allows  forgiveness  of  a
federal student loan after 10 years of income-based payments; however, a debtor must
have applied for the program before October 31, 2022. See The White House website,
