Applicant admitted all the allegations in SOR. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  61  years old.  He  is twice  divorced  and  married  for the  third  time  in
2003. He has two grown children from his previous marriages and a grown stepchild. He
served in the military from 1986 to 2010 and retired honorably in the paygrade E-7. He
receives  monthly  retirement  income  after  taxes  of  $2,223  and  U.S.  Department  of
Veterans Affairs (VA) monthly disability payments of $1,932. He has worked for federal
contractors from April 2012 to October 2017. He was unemployed for one month before
starting  work  for  his  present  employer  in  December  2017.  His  annual  salary  is
approximately $47,000. (Tr. 13-19; GE 1)
The SOR alleges 16 delinquent debts totaling approximately $24,444. Applicant
testified that approximately six to seven years ago, his daughter had financial difficulties
and was unable to pay her mortgage. Applicant paid her mortgage and stopped paying
his accounts, which then became delinquent. He said he tried to make some payments
on the accounts and thought he could catch up, but he got deeper in debt. His daughter
eventually  sold  her house.  Applicant  does  not  know  if  she  made a  profit.  She  has  not
reimbursed him. He said he was unaware his accounts were in a delinquent status until
he received the SOR. He admitted he should have been proactive in resolving them and
did not begin to address them until after he received the SOR. He testified that he was
not paying attention to his debts like he should have been. (Tr. 21-23, 51-54, 61)
In  August  2020,  Applicant  completed  a  security  clearance  application  (SCA).  In
response to questions about his finances, he disclosed he had one delinquent debt (SOR
¶ 1.g- $1,147). He said it would be paid by December 2020. He did not disclose any other
delinquent debts. He testified that he was unaware he had other delinquent debts until he
received the SOR. (Tr. 54-55; GE 1)
The  SOR  debts  are  corroborated  by  Applicant’s  admissions  in  his  answer  and
testimony, and credit reports from October 2020, May 2021, and August 2023. (GE 1, 2,
3, 4)
Applicant  testified  that  prior  to  receiving  the  SOR,  he  began  making  online
payments of $100 and $60 towards the accounts alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a ($3,790) and 1.b
($3,546) owed to MD, the same collection creditor. These were credit card accounts. He
testified that he would provide proof of the payments he made and when they began. He
did not. (Tr. 21-24, 39-42, 56-57; GE 2, 3, 4)
Applicant testified  that after receiving  the  SOR, he  contracted  with a  debt  solution
company   (DSC)   in  June   2022   to   help   him   settle  and   pay  his  delinquent  accounts.   He
testified  that all  the  debts in the  SOR except  the  three  owed  in ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b  and  1.k,  for
$431  to  the  same  collection  creditor,  were  the  only debts not included  in the  agreement.
Applicant  began   making   monthly  payments  of  $235   to   DSC.  After  he   made   six
consecutive  payments in January 2023,  DSC offered  to  arrange  a  loan  of approximately
$10,000   through  “OL”  (apparently a  loan  company associated  with  DSC)   and  then  use
that $10,000  to  settle his outstanding  debts.  Applicant would then  be  required  to  make
monthly payments of $325  to  repay OL. He said there is no  interest  rate  on  the  loan  but
rather he  pays  a  fee  based  on  the  amount of  each  debt that is resolved. (Tr. 19-20, 25-
31, 34-51; GE 4)
Applicant stated that he tried to include the MD debts in the plan, but MD would
not  accept  an  agreement  to  settle  their  accounts  through  DSC.  MD  wanted  to  view
Applicant’s  pay  stubs  for  the  past  two  years.  MD  refused  to  negotiate  a  settlement
agreement with OL. Applicant stated that because the amount of the loan through OL was
based on all his delinquent debts, DSC repaid OL about $6,000 that it had anticipated
using to settle the accounts with MD. Applicant’s loan from OL is listed on his most recent
credit report. It reflects a balance of $10,882 and consistent monthly payments of $325.
It  is unclear if  DSC made the reimbursement  to OL, as  the balance  does  not  reflect a
lesser  amount.  Applicant  has  not  made  any  payments  on  the  MD  accounts  since  he
began working with DSC. He further stated that since July 2023, DSC services have been
terminated because his debts were paid. (Tr. 24-51; GE 4)
Applicant testified that all the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR, except those to
MD, are paid. He said he has a meeting scheduled for November 2023 with MD to discuss
settlement of the three MD debts. The date of the meeting was scheduled by MD. He is
not currently making any payments to MD. When asked if he had money available to offer
a settlement to MD on the delinquent debts, he said he did not. (Tr. 24-27, 56-58)
Applicant stated that the debts alleged in SOR  ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f., 1.g, 1.i, 1.l,
1.m, 1.n and 1.p were all paid through DSC. The debt in SOR ¶ 1.h ($756) is a medical
bill that Applicant said was paid for by the VA after some confusion. He said he had the
supporting documentation and was going to provide it to show that it was resolved.  He
did not. Applicant testified that the debt alleged in SOR  ¶ 1.i ($702) is a cable  bill. He
obtained  cable  services  for  someone, and  that  person  paid  the debt.  Applicant  was  to
provide proof of the payment but did not. Applicant’s  2023 credit report shows that the
debts  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.c  ($2,049)  and  1.o  ($893)  were  resolved  in  January  2023  and
November 2018, respectively. (Tr. 59-71; GE 4)
Applicant was asked about a delinquent debt for $19,872 on his most recent credit
report. This debt is not alleged in the SOR. He explained that he obtained a loan to pay
a  student  loan  in  his  mother’s  name  that  was  obtained  for  him  sometime  in  the  early
1980s. He obtained the loan in March 2022 and was to pay $525 a month. He arranged
for the amount to be automatically withdrawn from his account. He testified he contacted
the creditor to change the date that the money would be withdrawn, and the transaction
did not happen as planned. He made payments and his last was January 2023. He said
he contacted the creditor in June or July 2023 and tried to fix the problem. When asked if
he had saved the payments that were due so he could bring the account current, he said
he did not save the money and does not have it to pay the delinquent amount. He intends
to fix the issue but has not yet done so. (Tr. 71- 79; GE 4)
Applicant  was  asked about  his current  finances.  He  stated  he did not  have any
money in his checking or savings account. He has about $30,000 in a retirement account.
He  has  about  $1,200  to  $1,600  of  expendable  income  at  the  end  of  the  month.
Occasionally, he will help his daughters out financially if they request it. He spends some
of his money on his grandchildren. Applicant takes full responsibility for not using good
judgment in addressing his delinquent debts. He stated that he will make it right. He has
not participated in financial counseling. (Tr. 81-83)
The record was held open for Applicant to provide documents to substantiate that
he has resolved the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR and through DSC. He did not
provide any documents to show he resolved most of the debts. Many of the debts alleged
do  not  appear  in  Applicant’s  August  2023  credit  report.  It  is  unknown  if  they  are  not
reported  because  they  fell  off  due  to  the  statute  of  limitations  or  have  been  resolved.
Applicant does not have a plan in place for resolving the debts owed to MD. (GE 4)
Applicant was asked if he had timely filed his tax returns for the past three years.
He stated he did not know because that is something his wife handles. He and his wife
live in different locations. He said they usually owe taxes. He was told to provide proof
that the taxes were timely filed. He did not. (Tr. 84-86)
Any derogatory issues that were not alleged in the SOR will not be considered for
disqualifying purposes but may be considered when making a credibility determination,
in the application of mitigating conditions, and in a whole-person analysis.
