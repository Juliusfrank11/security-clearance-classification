Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful
review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant is 48 years old.  She has never married and  has a  24-year-old daughter.
She   earned   a   bachelor’s degree  in  1997  and  two   master’s degrees in   2017   and   2023.
She  has been employed by the same federal contractor since  2000. (Tr. 16-17, 22, 24)
Applicant testified that she was never educated about how to manage finances,
and she has not always been a good steward of her money. She said she should have
been more conscientious about managing her money. In 2013, she purchased a house.
In  2014,  she  decided  to  accept  a  different  position  within  her  company  that  paid  her
approximately $10,000 less than she was earning. She believed the new job had potential
for growth and was more career enhancing. When she accepted the job, she was unable
to pay all of her bills because of the decrease in her income and chose not to do so. She
testified that from approximately 2015 to 2021, she did not make payments on the debts
alleged in the SOR. (Tr. 28-34)
Applicant testified  that she  missed  some  mortgage  payments due  to  the  reduction
in her salary but  was able to  bring  them  current (SOR ¶ 1.f-past due  $1,241). (Tr. 27, 50-
51; AE A, B, AE  SOR F)
In  2017,  Applicant’s  daughter  graduated  from  high  school  and  began  college.
Applicant testified that her daughter received financial aid and funded most of her own
tuition. Applicant helped with tuition for the last two semesters when her daughter was
attending part-time and was not eligible for financial aid. In February 2021, her daughter
gave  birth  to  a  baby.  They  both  live  with  Applicant.  Applicant’s  daughter  graduated  in
December 2022. Applicant presently provides some support for both her daughter and
granddaughter. Her daughter helps with some of the joint expenses. (Tr. 22-24, 49)
Applicant’s  brother  was  diagnosed  with  cancer  and  moved  in  with  her  in
approximately January 2017. He had medical insurance, and his expenses were paid but
she  helped  cover  some  of  the  incidentals  associated  with  living  with  her.  Her  brother
passed away in May 2020. She testified that she received about a $10,000 inheritance.
In January 2021, her heating and air conditioning unit broke, and she was able to use the
inheritance to pay the $7,729 bill for a new unit. (Tr. 38, 42, 51-53, 83-84; AE P)
In March 2021 after receiving the SOR, Applicant paid the debts in  SOR ¶¶ 1.g
($1,338),  1.h  ($688),  1.i  ($545),  and  1.j  ($194).  These  were  for  various  consumer
purchases. She used a portion of the inheritance money to pay these debts. (Tr. 32-36,
52-53; AE C, AE SOR G, H, I, J)
Applicant testified that she did not have the money to pay her remaining delinquent
debts.  After  receiving  the  SOR,  she  wanted  to  clear  her  credit  and  contacted  some
creditors. From the creditors in SOR ¶¶ 1.b ($4,764), 1.c ($4,057) and 1.e ($1,114), she
received  IRS  Cancellation  of  Debt  forms  1099C  that  she  filed  with  her  2022  federal
income  tax  return.  The  income  reported  increased  her  federal  income  taxes  by
approximately $3,800. She was unable to pay the taxes when they were due and has a
payment arrangement with the IRS. She is making $400 monthly payments until the taxes
are paid. These debts were for delinquent credit cards. (Tr. 37-40, 44-47; AE SOR B, C,
E)
In  2013,  Applicant  hired  a  local  contractor  to  build  a  porch  on  her  house.  She
secured  a  loan  of  approximately  $7,000  to  $8,000.  In  approximately  2015,  due  to  her
reduced  salary,  she  stopped  paying  the  loan.  (SOR  ¶  1.a-past  due  $3,980  with  total
balance of $5,142). She did not contact the creditor to discuss the debt or arrange a plan
for  repayment  after  2015.  She  received  notifications  from  the  creditor  requesting
payment. In July 2021, after receiving the SOR, Applicant used some of her inheritance
from her brother and other funds to pay $5,434 and resolve the debt. (Tr. 27-32, 42-44;
AE SOR A)
In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, regarding SOR ¶¶ 1.d ($1,503), 1.k ($1,097, 1.l
($500), and 1.n ($139), she admitted all of them and stated that she would be contacting
the creditors to set up payment plans to satisfy the debts and would provide proof of t/heir
resolution at her hearing. She testified that she thought she paid the debt in SOR ¶ 1.d
and  requested  the  creditor  provide  her  documents.  Post-hearing,  she  provided  a
statement saying she had verified the debt and was going to resolve it. (Tr. 49-50, 53-57;
AE SOR D)
Applicant  testified  that she  did  not have  a  payment plan  with  the  creditor in  SOR ¶
1.k.   Post-hearing,  she   stated   in  the   past  she   had   tried   to   locate   the   creditor  without
success. She  has now  found  a  contact number and  will  seek to  resolve it. She  testified
that  she  believed  she  paid  the  debt in  SOR ¶ 1.l  and  would  provide  proof.  Post-hearing,
she  stated  in  the  past  she  had  tried  to  locate  the  creditor and  was  unable.  She  has now
found a  contact number and will seek to resolve it.  Applicant provided proof she  paid the
debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.o  in  July 2021,  after  she  received  the  SOR.  (Tr. 49-50, 53-57; AE  SOR
K, L,  O)
In  Applicant’s answer  to  the  SOR,  she  admitted  the  debt  in  SOR ¶  1.m ($252) and
said she  paid  it years ago. She  said she  was contacting  the  creditor and  would  locate  the
documents  to  show  she  paid  it.  She  said  she  would  satisfy  the  debt  if  it  was  still
outstanding. At her hearing, she said she paid the debt and would provide proof.  Post-
hearing, she provided a statement saying she had contacted the creditor with whom she
had no communication since July 2016. She reiterated that she believed the debt was
resolved, but they advised her there was a balance on the debt of $254 as of November
2016 and had been sent to collection. She said the creditor believed that the collection
company might have gone out of business. She was unsure how to resolve the debt. It is
reflected on her July 2020 credit report. (Tr. 54-55; GE 3; AE SOR M)
In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, she said she would contact the creditor in SOR
¶  1.n  ($139),  a  medical  account,  and  resolve  it.  She  said  she  would  provide  proof  of
payment at her hearing. At her hearing, she stated she thought she paid the debt in 2020
or 2021. Post-hearing, she stated that she was unable to determine the creditor holding
the  medical  debt  after  diligently  contacting  her  providers.  She  did not  provide  proof  of
payment. (Tr. 57-58; AE S)
Applicant testified that her finances are much better, and she has been working
hard  to get  her debts in  order with  a  few  exceptions.  She  stated  she  did  not  take  into
account the impact her finances might have on her security clearance. She said she did
not realize that not paying her bills would affect her livelihood. She now pays most of her
bills
the
consequences associated with not being conscientious about paying bills on time.  (Tr.
58-59)

is
In Applicant’s June 2020 security clearance application (SCA) she disclosed that
she  purchased  a  computer  in  2013  for  approximately  $3,160.  She  failed  to  make  the
required  payments.  She  acknowledged  the  creditor  began  collection  efforts.  Applicant
testified that she had reached a payment agreement with the creditor, but a judgment was
entered in March 2016. She made the payments in accordance with the judgment, and it
was paid in 2019. (Tr. 61-68; GE 1; AE Q)
Applicant  also disclosed  in her 2020 SCA a garnishment order for a  credit  card
with an approximate balance owed of $4,744. Her pay was garnished until the balance
was paid in approximately 2018. (Tr. 64-68; GE 1)
Applicant testified that when she completed her SCA, she retrieved a recent credit
report  and  was  aware  of  her  negative  accounts.  She  stated  in  her  SCA  that  she  was
working with her creditors to repay her debts. She disclosed in her SCA the debts alleged
in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i,  and 1.j. She testified that after retrieving her
credit report she did not take action to resolve her debts with the creditors. She said she
was  “purposefully  blind  to  the  situation  that  I  was  in.”  She  did  not  seek  financial
counseling. (Tr. 69-70)
Applicant attributed some of her delinquent debts to the financial hardship created
when her brother moved in with her in late 2017. (Tr. 37-38) She further stated:
I guess I thought at some  point I would get better, do better, and be able to
pay them  off.  But truthfully, I think it was easier for me  not to  do  it so  I  didn't.
And  I didn't see  or think of the  bigger picture of how it would hurt me  in my
career  or  hurt  me   with   my  security  clearance.  So   it   was  an   error  in
judgement on  my part. I didn't see this happening, to  be  honest.  (Tr. 39)
Applicant also stated her financial hardship occurred because she chose to take a
job that paid less to accept a new position. She initially indicated her pay cut was $6,000.
At  her  hearing,  she  said  it  was  $10,000.  Applicant  was  asked  what  actions  she  took
regarding her financial situation after she completed her SCA, and she said she did not
do anything. (Tr. 38-40; GE 1)
Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator  in  June  2020.  She
acknowledged to the investigator most of the debts alleged in the SOR and that she had
not  made  payments  on  the  debts  after  her  reduction  in  pay  in  2014  because  of  the
additional financial strain from her brother living with her. She acknowledged receiving
phone calls from creditors and telling them she was going through a rough time. She said
she intended to pay all of her delinquent debts. (GE 2)
Applicant  funded   her  education   with   student   loans.   She   testified   that  she   owes
approximately $100,000  for  the  degree  she  earned  in 1997. She  said she  made  some
payments,  but the  loans were  deferred  over the  years and  are  now under the  pandemic
deferment.  She  received  a  scholarship for her first master’s degree  and  owes $20,000  in
student loans for the  second. She  said she has been  in  contact  the student loan  creditor
and  negotiated  a  monthly payment plan  of $250  that is to  begin in  November 2023. She
anticipates increasing  that  payment after she satisfies her tax debt with  the  IRS. (Tr. 17-
22, 88-89)
Applicant is embarrassed about her financial situation and has not sought financial
counseling. She testified that after her interview with the government investigator in 2020
she did not hear anything about her security clearance or financial issues so she thought
it  was  resolved.  She  stated:  “Even  though  I  had  requested  the  hearing  I  hadn't  heard
anything. So, I thought, well, everything's okay. I paid off the debts. They probably just
reviewed it and we're good to go.” (Tr. 78-79) She testified that she did not confirm her
assumptions  with  her  facility  security  officer  (FSO).  Post-hearing,  Applicant  said  she
spoke with her FSO about participating in financial counseling. (Tr. 69, 70, 78-80; AE S)
Applicant’s annual salary is $97,000. She has about $1,300 in her bank account.
She previously had about $700 remaining after paying her bills, but it is now about $300
because  she  is  making  payments  to  the  IRS.  She  stated  that  her  payment  should  be
completed in approximately March 2024. She has about $80,000 in a pension plan.  In
2021 her vehicle that she drove for 18 years was beyond repair, and  she purchased a
new car for $44,730 and pays $880 a month.  She said she  found a  car she  liked and
purchased it. She purchased a used car for her daughter ($12,572). Applicant had been
making  the  payments  but  now  that  her  daughter  has  graduated  from  college  and  is
employed, she is responsible for the payments. (Tr. 24, 83-85, 87-88, 91; GE 3, 4; AE A,
S)
In  early  2023,  Applicant  began  planning  a  trip  to  Hawaii  with  her  daughter  and
granddaughter that occurred the end of August and early September 2023. She saved
and paid for the airline tickets (approximately $5,000) and hotel ($1,700) before the trip.
She estimated the costs of incidentals while on the trip such as rental car, food, drinks,
and entertainment were $2,500. She used a credit card to pay for these expenditures.
She stated the balance on the card is about $4,000. The remaining amount was used for
other purchases not associated with the trip. She explained she had not taken a vacation
in a very long time and felt like she never gets to do anything. She did not think it was an
issue because she paid for most of it up front and over time everything  would be okay.
(Tr. 71-80; AE S)
In June 2023, Applicant purchased a timeshare. The company provided her with a
credit card to make the $2,000 down payment that is interest free for nine months. She
estimated the balance on the card is $2,500. The total cost of the timeshare was $13,000
and she has five years to pay it. Annual fees on the timeshare are $800. She thought it
would be a good idea because she would have a place to go. (Tr. 76-81 93-94; AE S)
Applicant  testified  that  her  plan  for  maintaining  her  finances  in  the  future  is  to
reduce frivolous spending, such as eating out. She is considering getting a part-time job
and she expects her daughter to share more of the household expenses. Post-hearing,
she said she obtained a part-time job. Applicant maintains a budget on a worksheet. Post-
hearing, she provided a copy of it. She said she is taking strides to put herself in a better
financial position. (Tr. 70-71, 89-91; AE R, S)
