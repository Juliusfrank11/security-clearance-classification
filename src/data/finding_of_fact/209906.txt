Applicant   admitted   all   the   SOR  allegations.   He  is   60   years  old.   He   was  born   in
China,  where  he   graduated   from   high   school  in  1980,  earned   an  associate   degree   in
1983, and  married  in 1987.  In  September 1995,  at age  32,  he  immigrated  to  the  United
States   and   earned   a   bachelor’s  degree   in  1999.  He   divorced   and   remarried   in  2006,
became  a  naturalized  U.S. citizen  in 2008, divorced  in 2011,  and  remarried  in 2012.  He
has an  adult  child  from  his first marriage, who  was born in China, became  a  naturalized
U.S. citizen,  and  resides in the  United  States. He also has a  minor child  from his current
marriage, who  was born in the  United  States  and  resides with  Applicant and  his spouse
in  the  United  States. He  has owned  his home  in  the  United  States since  October 2020.

When Applicant was solely a Chinese citizen, he held two Chinese passports that
were  issued  to  him  in  China  in  1995  and  1999,  and  which  expired  in  1997  and  2009,
respectively. When he became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2008, he was issued a U.S.
passport  that  expired  in  2018.  He  was  subsequently  issued  another  U.S.  passport  in
2018, and it is not scheduled to expire until 2028. In 2017, he obtained a Chinese visa
that  is  not  scheduled  to  expire  until  2027,  and  he  uses  this  visa,  along  with  his  U.S.
passport,  when  he  travels  to  China,  as  further  discussed  below.  (Tr.  at  31-34,  93-95,
100-103, 112-113; GE 1-2)
Applicant  worked  in  the  private  sector  from  2007  to  2015.  He  also  owned  a
health, beauty, and home care products business from 2010 to 2019. He was fired by a
previous employer in October 2015, as further discussed below. He was subsequently
unemployed until May 2016, when he first began working for a defense contractor. As of
the  date  of  the  hearing,  he  worked  as  a  technical  support  engineer  for  his  current
employer, another defense contractor, since approximately 2017. He earned certificates
in  security  training  in  2018,  2020,  and  2021.  He  was  granted  an  interim  security
clearance in approximately 2016. (Tr. at 7-8, 23-25, 73; GE 1-3; AE H, T)
Applicant’s  51-year-old  spouse  was  born  in  China.  He  met  her  in  2011.  She
worked  as  a medical doctor in  China  before immigrating  to  the  United  States  in 2012.
As  of  Applicant’s  June 2018  security  clearance  application  (SCA),  she  was  a  Chinese
citizen  and  held  a  permanent  resident  card.  She  became  a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen  in
January 2020. Applicant believed her previously issued Chinese passport expired. As of
the date of the hearing, she was a licensed acupuncturist  in the United States. She is
aware that Applicant is seeking a DOD security clearance. (Tr. at 34-37, 105, 127-132;
GE 1-2)
Applicant’s  father  has  been  deceased  since  2011,  and  Applicant’s  87-year-old
mother is a Chinese citizen residing in China. (SOR ¶ 4.a) She is a retired merchandise
store  worker.  She  owns  her  home,  which  is  Applicant’s  childhood  home,  the  value  of
which Applicant estimated was $58,000 USD. Applicant expects that his two sisters will
inherit  their  mother’s  home.  Occasionally,  Applicant’s  older  sister  and  her  adult  son
reside  with  her  in  her  home.  Applicant  maintains  in-person,  telephonic,  and  electronic
contact with his mother. She visited him in the United States in approximately 2001, and
he travels to China to see her approximately once every two years. He last saw her in
China in 2019, when he visited and stayed with her. He talks to her by telephone or chat
room once every two to three weeks. Applicant’s mother is aware that he underwent a
background investigation. (Tr. at 37-45, 89-90, 103-105, 107-108; GE 1-2; AE A, E, I, J)
Applicant’s  father-in-law  has  been  deceased  since  2021,  and  Applicant’s  78-
year-old mother-in-law is a Chinese citizen residing in China. (SOR ¶ 4.d) His mother-in-
law was a professor at a university before she retired in 2000. She receives a pension
from  the  Chinese  government  of  approximately  $750  USD  monthly.  She  owns  the
condominium  in  which she  lives, the value  of  which  Applicant  was unaware.  Applicant
expects that his mother-in-law’s home will be inherited by his spouse and his spouse’s
sibling  upon  his  mother-in-law’s  passing.  Applicant’s  spouse  talks  to  her  mother  daily,
and  Applicant  talks  to  his  mother-in-law  two  to  three  times  monthly.  She  visited
Applicant  and  his  spouse  in  the  United  States  twice.  He  and  his  spouse  last  saw  his
mother-in-law in 2017, when they traveled to China with their child to visit. His spouse
travels  to  China  on  her  own  to  visit  her  mother,  and  she  last  did  so  in  approximately
2018. Applicant’s mother-in-law is aware that he underwent a background investigation.
(Tr. at 59-68, 91-93, 103, 105-107; GE 1-2; AE A, E, I, N, O)
Applicant’s  brother,  age  51,  and  two  sisters,  ages  59  and  54,  are  Chinese
citizens;  his  brother  lives  in  Japan  and  his  sisters  live  in  China.  (SOR  ¶¶  4.b-4.c)
Applicant’s  brother  has  lived  in  Japan  since  2010,  and  his  spouse  lives  with  him.
Applicant’s  brother  is  a  cook  in  a  restaurant,  and  his  spouse  works  in  a  hotel.
Applicant’s  sisters  work  for  a  ceramics  company.  They  are  divorced.  Applicant’s  older
sister  and  her  adult  son,  who  was  recently  laid  off  from  an  automaker  factory,  live  on
occasion  with  their  mother  in  her  home,  and  Applicant’s  older  sister  is  the  primary
caregiver for their mother. When their mother had health issues in 2022, Applicant sent
his older sister approximately $2,300 USD to pay for their mother’s medical expenses;
he  also  sent  this  sister  approximately  $500  USD  to  help  her  as  she  cared  for  their
mother. In 2023, Applicant sent this sister approximately $1,025 USD so that she could
hire a part-time caretaker for their mother. He intends to continue to financially assist his
sister  as  necessary  in  the  future.  Applicant  maintains  in-person,  telephonic,  and
electronic contact with his brother and sisters. He sees his brother approximately once
every four to five years, when they visit their mother in China. He last saw his siblings in
China in 2019, when he traveled there to visit their mother. He talks by chat room to his
older sister once every two to three months, and to his brother and younger sister once
or  twice  a  year.  Applicant’s  siblings  are  aware  that  he  underwent  a  background
investigation. (Tr. at 44-59, 61, 69-70, 90-91, 104-107; GE 1-2; AE A, E, I, K, L, M)
During  his November 2018  background  interview, Applicant indicated  that he  has
contact with  a  high  school friend  in China.  Applicant  reaches out  to  this  friend  when  he
is  in   China   visiting   family.  Applicant   stated   in  his  October   2021   response   to
interrogatories that  when  he  saw this  friend  in  2014, the  friend  told  him  he  was a  “self-
employee and teach  a middle and high  school  Math one  to  one by  private.”  (GE  2)
Applicant traveled to China to visit his family in approximately 2009, 2011, 2012,
2014, 2017, and 2019. He also went to China in 2011 because his father passed away.
He  traveled  to  China  on  his  own  in  2011,  2012,  2014,  and  2019,  and  he  traveled  to
China with his spouse and child in 2017. He intends to continue to travel to China in the
future to visit his family there. He does not own property or have any bank accounts in
China. He estimated that the value of his home in the United States was $850,000, and
his  remaining  assets  in  the  United  States  were  $290,000.  Applicant  stated  in  his SCA
and indicated during his background interview that none of his family, or his high-school
friend,  are  affiliated  with  the  Chinese  government  or  military,  and  that  none  of  his
foreign contacts are aware that he is under consideration for a national security position.
Since approximately 2017, he donates to a nonprofit organization dedicated to exposing
the  evils  of  the  authoritarian  Chinese  Communist  Party  government  and  supporting
those seeking  freedom and human rights for China.  He stated,  “[The  United States] is
my  home.  This  is  where  I  belong.  I  will  never  ever  favor  China  over  the  country  that
[has] given me the chance to survive in freedom.” (Tr. at 64-65, 70-73, 88-90, 101-104,
107-108; AE AA-BB; GE 1-2)
In  October  2015,  Applicant’s  then-employer,  for  whom  he  had  been  working
since  2009,  terminated  him  from  employment  for  a  serious  violation  of  a  company
resource  directive,  after  he  inserted  a  personal  USB  hard  disk  containing  extensive
adult pornography into his work-issued computer in approximately August 2015. (SOR ¶
1.a, 1.b, 2.a, 3.a) As a result of Applicant’s action, his then-employer received an alarm
that  child  pornography  had  been  accessed.  (SOR  ¶  1.b,  1.b,  2.a,  3.a)  After  his  then-
employer  turned  the  matter  over  to  the  authorities,  the  county  sheriff’s  office
investigated   Applicant,  executed   a   search   warrant  at   his  residence   for   the   offense   of
child  pornography,  and  seized  numerous items of electronic and  digital media. He  was
not  arrested.  A  December   2016   letter  from   the   state’s  attorney   states,   “Forensic
analysis  of  the   items  seized   from   his  home   revealed   images   of   evidentiary  value.”   It
further  reflects  that  the   state   informed   Applicant  that  it   was  “willing   to   forego   a
prosecution   if   Applicant  forfeited   any  claim,  rights,   and   possessory  interest   in  the
offending  items.”  Applicant  was never charged  with  a  crime.  (Tr. at  73-88,  95-100,  108-
111, 113-114; GE  1-3;  AE A-D, F)
Applicant  denied   ever   viewing   child   pornography.  He   also   denied   accessing
illegal content on  his company computer. He  admitted  to  viewing  adult  pornography on
his  personal  computer  beginning   in  1995,  when   he   was  living   in  the   United   States
without  his then-spouse, and  he  saved  a  personal collection  of  it  onto  his personal USB
hard   disc.  He   stopped   viewing   and   downloading   adult  pornography  in  2000,  after  his
then-spouse  moved  to  the  United   States, and  he  had  not  accessed  his  USB  hard disc
containing   such   content  since   that   time.   In   2015,  when   he   used   his  USB   hard   disc   to
back  up   files  from   his  company  computer,   due   to   issues  with   company  laptops  dying,
software   crashing,  and   the   company’s   failure  to   provide   employees   with   storage
devices,   he   forgot  that  he   had   adult  pornography  on   his  USB   hard  disc.  He
acknowledged   that  he   should  have   used   an   empty  USB,  and   he   was  aware   of  the
company  policy  against   viewing   pornography  on   his work computer.  (Tr.  at  73-88,  95-
100, 108-111,  113-114; GE  1-3;  AE A-D, F)
Applicant had no previous  unfavorable incidents  with this employer, and he has
not  had  any  unfavorable  incidents  since,  to  include  with  his  current  employer.  He
expressed  remorse  for  his  actions  and  stated  that  he  learned  his  lesson  not  to  use  a
personal  device  on  his  company  computer  and  to  follow  company  policies.  He  also
stated  that  he  timely  completes  annual  training  with  his  employer,  and  he  follows  his
employer’s  policies  and  procedures.  (Tr.  at 73-88, 95-100,  108-111,  113-114;  GE  1-3;
AE A-D, F)
Applicant’s  manager,  and  coworker  since  2018,  described  Applicant  in  her
January 2022 letter, as a dedicated employee and  asset. A coworker of approximately
seven  years  also  described  him  as  a  hard-working  and  dedicated  employee.  Three
former  coworkers,  who  are  also  close  friends  of  Applicant,  attested  to  his  reliability,
trustworthiness,  and  work  ethic.  Applicant’s  spouse,  and  his  adult  child,  attested  to
Applicant’s  character,  describing  him  as  honest,  trustworthy,  personable,  and  a  good
family man. He received favorable performance evaluations from his employer in 2020
and 2021. (Tr. at 115-132; AE G, R-S, U-Y, CC, DD)
China
China  is  an  authoritarian  state  in  which  the  Chinese  Communist  Party  is  the
paramount  authority.  Communist  Party  members  hold  almost  all  top  government  and
security apparatus positions.
China has rapidly become more assertive, and it is the only competitor potentially
capable  of  combining  its  economic,  diplomatic,  military,  and  technological  power  to
mount  a  sustained  challenge  to  a  stable  and  open  international  system.  It  will  remain
the  top  threat  to  U.S.  technological  competitiveness  as  its  government  targets  key
sectors and proprietary commercial and military technology from the United States and
allied  companies  and  institutions.  It  uses  a  variety  of  tools,  from  public  investment  to
espionage, to advance its technological capabilities.
China’s National Intelligence Law of 2017 forms the baseline of the modern data
collection  regime,  and  compels  all  Chinese  firms  and  entities  to  support,  assist,  and
cooperate  with  Chinese  intelligence  services,  creating  a  legal  obligation  for  those
entities to turn over data collected abroad and domestically. It has expansive efforts in
place  to  acquire  U.S.  technology,  to  include  sensitive  trade  secrets  and  proprietary
information.
China’s  intelligence  services,  as  well  as  private  companies  and  other  entities,
frequently seek to exploit Chinese citizens or persons with family ties to China who can
use their insider access to corporate networks to steal secrets using removable media
devices or email. Most Chinese cyber operations against U.S. private industry that have
been  detected  are  focused  on  cleared  defense  contractors  or  information  technology
and  communications  firms  whose  products  and  services  support  government  and
private sector networks worldwide.
Multiple  U.S.  criminal  indictments  since  2015  involve  Chinese  nationals,
naturalized  U.S.  citizens  or  permanent  resident  aliens  from  China,  and  U.S.  citizens,
procuring  and  exporting  controlled  items  to China.  China’s  efforts to  acquire  sensitive,
dual-use,  or  military-grade  equipment  included  radiation  hardened  integrated  circuits,
monolithic microwave integrated circuits, accelerometers, gyroscopes, naval and marine
technologies,  syntactic
trade  secrets,  space  communications,  military
jamming  equipment,  dynamic  random-access  memory,  aviation
communication
technologies,  and  anti-submarine  warfare  technologies.  About  80%  of  all  economic
espionage prosecutions brought by the U.S. Department of Justice allege conduct that
would  benefit  the  Chinese  state,  and  there  is  at  least  some  nexus  to  China  in  around
60% of all trade secret theft cases.

The  U.S.  Department  of  State  reported  that  in  2021,  significant  human  rights
issues  in  China  included:  arbitrary  or  unlawful  killings,  forced  disappearances,  torture,
and  arbitrary  detention  by  the  Chinese  government;  harsh  and  life-threatening  prison
and  detention  conditions;  political  prisoners;  politically  motivated  reprisal  against
individuals  outside  the  country;  the  lack  of  an  independent  judiciary  and  Communist
Party  control  over  the  judicial  and  legal  system;  arbitrary  interference  with  privacy,
including  pervasive  and  intrusive  technical  surveillance  and  monitoring;  punishment  of
family  members  for  offenses  allegedly  committed  by  an  individual;  serious  restrictions
on free expression, the press, and the internet; serious restrictions on internet freedom;
substantial  interference  with  the  freedom  of  peaceful  assembly  and  freedom  of
association;  severe  restrictions  and  suppression  of  religious  freedom;  substantial
restrictions  on  freedom  of  movement;  refoulement  of  asylum  seekers  to  North  Korea;
the  inability  of  citizens  to  choose  their  government  peacefully  through  free  and  fair
elections;  serious  restrictions  on  political  participation;  serious  acts  of  government
corruption;  forced  sterilization  and  coerced  abortions;  trafficking  in  persons;  severe
restrictions on labor rights; and child labor. Since the imposition of the National Security
Law  on  June  30,  2020,  China  unilaterally  and  arbitrarily  exercises  police  and  security
power in Hong Kong.
In  2019,  China’s  response  to  terrorism  remained  difficult  to  distinguish  from  the
government’s  suppression  of  peaceful  activities  that  authorities  deemed  separatist  or
subversive in nature. Details about alleged terrorism-related incidents inside China were
difficulty  to  verify  due  to  a  lack  of  transparency  and  information  from  Chinese
authorities.  As  in  2018,  Chinese  officials  continued  to  claim  that  no  violent  terrorist
incidents  have  occurred  in  the  country  since  2016,  owing  to  the  government’s  “new
counter-extremism policies,” to justify Beijing’s repressive campaign in Xinjiang.
The  U.S. Department of  State  in  April 2022  rated  China  as Level 3: Reconsider
Travel to  China  and  Hong  Kong, due  to  arbitrary enforcement of local laws and  COVID-
19  related  restrictions, and  it ordered  the  departure  of non-emergency U.S. Government
employees   and   all   family  members  from   the   Consulate   General  Shanghai  consular
district,  due   to   a   surge   in  COVID-19   cases   and   the   impact  of   restrictions  related   to
China’s response.
