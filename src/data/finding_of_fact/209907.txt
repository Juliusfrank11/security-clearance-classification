Applicant admitted all the allegations in SOR. His admissions are incorporated into
the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and
exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 39 years old. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2009. He served in the
military from 2015 to 2018 and received an honorable discharge due to medical conditions
in the paygrade of E-4. He has a 90% disability rating from the Department of Veterans
Affairs  (VA)  and  receives  about  $2,500  a  month  in  disability  payments.  He  married  in
2006 and divorced in 2017. He has two children from the marriage, ages 16 and 13. He
pays  about  $700  a  month  for  child  support.  He  stated  he  had  a  short  period  of
unemployment after he was discharged from the military but  otherwise, he has had no
other recent periods of unemployment. He earns an hourly wage and estimates his annual
income to be approximately $75,000. (Tr. 19-24)
The SOR alleges Applicant failed to timely file his 2018 and 2019 federal and state
income  tax  returns  (¶¶  1.a  and  1.b).  His  returns  were  filed  late.  Tax  transcripts  were
included  in  his  response  to  government  interrogatories  and  reflect  his  2018  federal
income tax return was filed in November 2020 and his 2019 federal income tax return
was  filed  in  October  2020.  The  transcripts  do  not  reflect  an  extension  was  filed.  He
testified that his delinquent income tax returns are all filed. He did not provide proof that
his state income tax returns for these years were filed, but I believe he resolved them at
the  same  time  he  did  his  federal  tax  returns.  He  testified  he  has  no  outstanding  tax
balance. No explanation was provided for why he filed his income tax returns late. (Tr.
34-36; GE 2)
The SOR alleges Applicant has 14 delinquent student loans that are in collection
or charged off and total approximately $92,044 (¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, 1.f - 1.k, 1.n, 1.o, 1.r, 1.u, 1.z,
and  1.aa). He  has  ten  delinquent  consumer debts  that  are  charged  off  or  in  collection
totaling approximately $30,845 (¶¶ 1.e, 1.l, 1.m, 1.p, 1.q, 1.s, 1.t, 1.v, 1.y, 1.bb). These
debts include a credit card that he used to fund a vacation in 2016 for his family that cost
about  $10,000  (SOR  ¶  1.e  balance  - $15,232).  He  testified  he  was  trying  to  save  his
marriage and was hoping a family vacation would help. Another delinquent debt is for a
dog he purchased for a significant other who had medical issues. The balance owed is
$1,179 (SOR ¶ 1.t) Another delinquent account is owed to a jewelry store for items he
purchased for family members (¶ 1.p - $1,480) He also has two medical debts that are in
collection  totaling  $302  (¶¶  1.w  and  1.x).  Applicant  has  made  no  effort  to  contact  the
creditors or attempt to resolve the debts. All of the debts are corroborated by Applicant’s
admissions in the SOR, statements made to the government investigator that Applicant
authenticated, testimony during his hearing, and credit reports from June 2020, February
2021, and August 2023. (Tr. 46-55; GE 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
Applicant did not disclose any delinquent debts, charged off accounts, or accounts
in collection on his security clearance application (SCA) completed in March 2020. He
testified it was an oversight and was a mistake.  Applicant’s testimony was not credible,
evasive, and lacked candor. (Tr. 40-43)
Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator in August 2020. He was
confronted with all of his unpaid student loans and other delinquent debts. He told the
investigator he  has  never  been  financially  stable  and  since  getting  a  steady  job  in
September 2018 he thought about repairing his credit but had not taken action until June
2020 when he began to research the best way to get out of debt. He told the investigator
that it was time to do the right thing, stand up, and take care of his debts now that he was
financially stable. He was unaware at the time of the total amount of his delinquent debts
but was aware they needed to be addressed. He was not stressed about the debts. He
said he  started  to  do  online  research  about  debt  consolidation  and  was  weighing  the
options of working with a debt consolidator or handling the debts on his own. He told the
investigator he was gathering information and that once he had a handle on it, he could
make a better, more informed decision. He said that in the next year he would gain more
knowledge to make that decision. He said that he had the ability to pay and intended to
pay his delinquent debts. (GE 2)
Applicant testified  that  after  he  completed  college  in  2009,  his  parents  made
payments on his student loans for a period, and he also made payments for a period. He
said he was underemployed and not earning sufficient income to pay the student loans.
In 2017, he was going through a divorce, and he was in the military not earning enough
income  to  repay  his  student  loans.  He  also  stated  there  were  periods  of  time  when
the  loans  were  in  forbearance  or  deferred.1  He  believes  he  stopped  making
payments sometime  in  2012  or  2013.  He  testified  he  does  not  have  sufficient  money
to  repay  his  student  loans  at  this  time.  When  he  last  contacted  the  creditor,  he  was
offered a payment plan but could not afford it.  He could not recall when he made this
contact.  He  planned  on  paying  the  smaller  debts  first  and  contacting  creditors  to
dispute  some  debts.  He planned to pay all of his debts. (Tr. 24-32, 36-47)
At Applicant’s hearing, he testified he does not have any extra money to pay his
delinquent debts. He is working to gain experience and knowledge so he can get a better
job  with an  increased  salary.  He  has  no  savings  or  pension  plan.  He  has  minimal
expendable income at the end of the month after paying bills. He has made no payments
on any of the debts alleged in the SOR. He testified he is researching how best to address
the debts. He continues to study his options. Since his August 2020 interview with the
1  US Dept of Education placed student loans in forbearance from March 2020 to October 2023 due to the
COVID-19  pandemic  under  repeated  Presidential  Executive  Orders.  Applicant’s  student  loans  were
charged-off or in collection status in 2018. See, e.g., https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-
19
government investigator, he has not taken any action on any of the debts alleged in the
SOR. He acknowledged he received inquiries from the creditors of his student loans by
mail. He said he filed them and did not respond to them. He testified he has not spoken
to them in the past three years. (Tr. 24-32, 36-47, 55-58)
Applicant testified that he has randomly searched different websites on the Internet
for options of how to resolve his delinquent debts but has not spoken to anyone personally
or taken any specific action or contracted with any financial agency for assistance. He
has not had formal financial counseling. Applicant stated that his plan is to research and
study his options for resolving his debts (Tr. 44-47, 55-58)
Any derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will not be considered
for  disqualifying  purposes  but  may  be  considered  in  the  application  of  the  mitigating
conditions, in making a credibility determination, and in a whole-person analysis.
