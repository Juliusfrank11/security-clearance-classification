Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  49  years old.  He  served  in  the military and retired  honorably in  the
paygrade E-7. He served combat tours in 2003-2004 and 2004-2005 (12 months and 13
months). He earned an associate degree in 2019. He married for the fourth time in 2006.
He has four children. He has a child from a previous relationship; adopted two stepsons,
and he and his wife have a child together. His youngest son is in high school. The others
are adults. Applicant started his own business in March 2021, which contracts with the
federal  government.  Before  then  he  was  employed  by  federal  contractors  since  his
military retirement. (Tr. 18-24; GE 1)
Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) on February 8, 2021.
Section 26 asked if he had failed to file or pay any federal, state, or local tax returns. He
responded “no.” It also asked if he had any debts that were in collection or past 120 days
delinquent. He answered  “no.” He did not disclose  any financial difficulties.  He testified
the omission was an oversight. (Tr. 48-51; GE 1)
Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator on February 24, 2021. He
told the investigator that he had received a letter from the IRS two weeks prior that said
he underpaid his taxes and owed $5,500. He said he did not disclose this information on
his SCA because he was unaware of the issue when he completed it. He said his mother-
in-law did the paperwork for their tax returns, and he had hired the same accountant that
works on his self-employment to look into this issue. (GE 2)
Applicant responded to government interrogatories, and he adopted the summary
of  his  interview  by  a  government  investigator  affirming  it  was  accurate.  In  the
interrogatories, he disclosed he had not timely filed his 2018 and 2019 federal income tax
returns. He requested an extension to file his 2020 federal income tax return and it was
filed timely. He testified that he filed the delinquent 2018 and 2019 federal returns in April
2021 and May 2021, respectively. He testified he had no excuse for his failure to timely
file the tax returns. He was aware that he owed federal taxes for 2018, 2019, and 2020
and he did not pay them when they were due or when he filed those tax returns. He further
testified that his 2018 federal tax return was later audited, and he owed $6,973 for taxes.
He disclosed in his interrogatories that he also owed $1,100 for 2019 and about $1,000
for  state  income  tax.  He  said  he  had  difficulties  filing  his  2019  federal  tax  return
electronically because there was an incorrect social security number. In January 2022,
he received a notification by letter from the IRS advising him to pay the balance he owed
of  $6,965  and  to  file  his  missing  returns.  It  said  the  years  required  to  be  filed  were
indicated on the next page. That page was not provided by Applicant, and it is unknown
what tax years the IRS was referring to. Applicant did not provide federal tax transcripts
as  requested  in  the  government  interrogatories  and  discussed  during  his  hearing.  In
January 2022, he paid the IRS the amount he owed. It is unknown if he filed the missing
returns mentioned by the IRS and what years were missing. (Tr. 36-38, 59-66, 77; GE 2;
AE A, B)
Applicant  testified  that  he  received  a  letter  from  his  state’s  taxation  department
based on the audit of his 2018 federal tax return and he owed $1,000. He did not provide
a copy of the letter. He testified that he paid his state taxes, and he does not owe any
taxes to his state. He did not provide documentary proof. (Tr. 67-69; GE 2; AE A, B)
The  SOR  alleged  three  delinquent  credit  card  debts  (¶¶  1.a  - $16,740;  1.b  -
$14,430; and 1.c - $3,517). Applicant attributed the delinquent credit cards to a period
after he retired from the military in 2015 when he was underemployed, and his wife was
unable  to  work due  to surgery in  2015  and 2016.  He  also testified that  he  used  these
credit cards to maintain a lifestyle he was accustomed to both before and after he retired.
In  his  SOR  answer,  he  said  these  debts  were  attributable  to  his  wife  having  multiple
surgeries  from  2018  to  2020,  and  her  inability  to  work  full  time.  He  said  they  were
struggling  financially.  He  does  not  know  when  the  cards  became  delinquent,  but  he
received collection notices about the debts. He also attributed his financial problems to
spending money on legal fees for his son who got into trouble.  His August 2023 credit
report reflects the last payment on the credit cards in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b were in April
2018 and January 2018, respectively. He testified that he decided at the time to pay other
bills and not pay the credit cards. His wife did not work from 2006 to 2019. She attended
school for about nine years, earning a bachelor’s degree in 2015 and a master’s degree
in 2019. (Tr. 29-33, 39-44, 47, GE 2, 3, 4)
Applicant stated  in his SOR answer regarding  the two debts  alleged  in ¶¶  1.a  and
1.b  (owed  to  the  same creditor)  that he  was  working  on  a  payment plan  to  resolve  them.
He testified  that in  about 2019  or  2020  the  creditor agreed  to  settle  the  debt for a  lump
sum  payment,  but he  was unable  to  pay the  amount.  He took no  further action  until he
contacted  the  creditor about two  weeks before  his hearing,  and  it would not negotiate  a
payment  plan.  He  explained  he had  saved  some  money but  then  needed  to help  his  son
with  his legal issues. At his hearing, he  explained  he  will  resolve the  debts  in SOR ¶¶  1.a
and  1.b  after he  completes the  refinancing  of his house. He  said it took him  seven  months
to  find  a  mortgage  company that  would  refinance  his house  due  to  his credit history. He
anticipated  the  refinancing  to  be  completed  sometime  in September  2023. Post-hearing,
he  stated  that he  was  refinancing  his house  and  then  would pay  the  debts. (Tr. 32-33, 39-
44, 47-48, 57-59; AE C)
Regarding  the  debt in SOR ¶  1.c,  Applicant said in  his SOR answer that  he  had a
payment  plan  to  pay it  off.  He  testified  that  he  thought  he  had  paid  this  credit card but
learned  that  he  had  two  accounts  with  the  creditor,  and  he  paid  the  other one. When  he
was interviewed  by a  government  investigator in February  2021,  he  explained  that  this
credit card was used  to  pay for a  cruise  he  and  his family took in 2016  as a  Christmas
present.  He   and   his  wife   also   took  a   separate   cruise   in  2016   to   celebrate   their   10th
anniversary.  His family took  a  cruise  in 2019  that was  paid  for by other relatives. He  and
his wife  took a  vacation  in 2020  to  celebrate  her birthday.  In  his post-hearing  response,
he   said  the   debt   in   SOR  ¶   1.e   is  no   longer   on   his   credit   report.  He  testified   when   he
checked  his credit  report this debt  was  not listed.  He  said  he  contacted  the  creditor and
was told “no  debt.” The  debt is reported  on  his February 2021  and  August 2023  credit
report. (Tr. 33-36  72-75; GE 2, 3, 4; AE C)
Applicant  testified  that  his  annual  income  is  approximately  $80,000.  He  has
received approximately $1,700 a month from VA disability ($20,400 annually) since 2015.
He also receives military retirement pay of $21,600 annually. His wife’s current annual
income is $55,000, which she has earned for the past year. Her monthly VA disability is
$1,000 (approximately $12,000 annual since 2007). In 2019, she earned about $26,000.
He estimated he has about $5,000 to $6,000 in his bank accounts and a small amount in
a pension account. (Tr. 26-29, 53-54, 76)
Applicant  has  not  had  financial  counseling.  He  said  he  is  current  on  all  of  his
financial obligations. He does not have a budget. (Tr. 71-72)
Any derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will not be considered
for disqualifying purposes. It may be considered when applying the mitigating conditions,
in making a credibility determination, and in a whole-person analysis.
