Applicant,  age  43,  married  his  wife  in  2008.  They  have  two  minor  children.  He
attended a U.S. military college from June 1999 through March 2004, without obtaining a
degree. He received his bachelor’s degree from another college in September 2004. He
was  employed  by  the  same  defense  contractor  from  June  2006  until  November  2018,
when he began working for his current employer. He has maintained a security clearance
since 2004. (GE 1; AE I; Tr. at 28, 29, 57, 68)
Background
Applicant  was  separated  from  the  U.S.  military  college  for misconduct  involving
alcohol. He received a general discharge under honorable conditions in April 2005. The
sole  debt  alleged  in  the  SOR  involves  the  recoupment  of  his  U.S.  military  college
expenses. In December 2020, the debt was reported in collection status, with a balance
of $203,260, as alleged  in SOR ¶ 1.a. Applicant admitted he was obliged to repay the
debt.  However, he  disputed  the  alleged balance  on  the  basis that it  did  not  reflect  the
payments he has made toward the debt. (GE 1, 2; AE A)
Debts  owed   to   the   DOD  are  collected   by  the   Defense   Finance   and   Accounting
Service  (DFAS). The Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 authorizes the accrual of
interest, administrative fees, and  penalties on  unpaid debts over 30  days old, and  referral
to   the   Internal  Revenue   Service   (IRS)  for  federal  income   tax   refund   offset.  After  initial
collection   efforts  are  exhausted   by  DFAS,  the   delinquent  account  is  transferred   to   the
U.S.  Department  of  the   Treasury  (Treasury)   for  more   aggressive   collection   efforts,
including   an   administrative   wage   garnishment  (AWG).   Upon   transfer,   the   Treasury  is
authorized to collect a  processing  fee, which is 30% of the  unpaid balance, in addition  to
the  accrued interest. (AE S  at 298-299)
In May 2005, the U.S. military college notified Applicant of his obligation to repay
the  debt,  with  a  balance  of  $193,986.  In  August  2006,  DFAS  notified  Applicant  of  his
repayment options and informed him that the debt would continue to accrue interest if it
was  not  paid  within  30  days.  Sometime  thereafter,  Applicant  negotiated  a  hardship
repayment plan with DFAS to repay the debt, which was renewed on either an annual or
semi-annual basis. In July 2015, DFAS found him in default of the repayment plan and
transferred  the  debt,  with  a  balance  of  $203,261,  to  the  Treasury.  Upon  transfer,  the
balance of the debt increased to $264,239 after the Treasury assessed its 30% fee. (AE
A at 4; AE S at 292, 300; Tr. at 30-31, 53-54, 57-59)
DFAS History
Applicant  maintained  that  he  never  defaulted  on  the  repayment  plan  and
consistently  made  timely  monthly  payments  via  written  checks  to  DFAS,  totaling
approximately  $18,000.  The  payment  amounts,  which  ranged  from  $25  to  $325  per
month,  were  determined  by  DFAS  based  upon  financial  information  he  provided  in
hardship packets that he mailed to DFAS “every six months or every year.” He never lied
or misled DFAS about his income or expenses. (AE C; Tr. at 30-31, 54-55, 57-63, 76-77)
Given  the  scant  records  available  to  Applicant  (due,  in  part,  to  his  own  record
keeping, and, in part, to the sparse responses he received to requests for records) and
the passage of time, he was unable to proffer the specific details of his DFAS repayment
plan  and  payment  history.  He  recalled,  generally,  that  DFAS  initially  set  the  monthly
payment  amount  at  $25,  then  increased  it  to  $50,  and  to  $100,  until  settling  at  $325.
Following its approval of each hardship packet, DFAS notified him of the new payment
amounts in statements sent by mail. (AE O, W, X; Tr. at 30-31, 47, 59-63)
Applicant recalled that he started making payments to DFAS in about 2005; and
that, after he stopped receiving statements sometime in 2014, he continued to send $325
checks  to  DFAS  for  a  “couple  of  years.”  The  record  indicates  that  his  payments  likely
began sometime after he received the August 2006 notice from DFAS and continued until
about July 2015, when the debt fell into default status. (Tr. at 30-31, 77)
Applicant  denied  having  knowledge  of  the  default  status  of  the  debt  until  he
received the July 2015 notice. He later learned that DFAS revoked his hardship status in
about August 2013, which resulted in the debt falling into default status. At the time, he
thought “everything was fine,” because DFAS continued to cash the $325 checks he sent,
even  after he  stopped receiving  statements from  DFAS.  In  hindsight,  he  attributes  the
revocation of his hardship status to not being aware that the process  for submitting his
hardship packets had changed to an online platform in about 2012 or 2013. (GE 1 at 38;
AE C at 20; Tr. at 30-31, 46-47)
Applicant  proffered  documents  corroborating  that  he  paid  a  total  of  $16,984  to
DFAS  before  the  debt  was  transferred  to  the  Treasury.  Those  documents  also
corroborated some other details of his DFAS payment history, including: 1) a hardship
plan approving monthly payments of $100 effective April 2008 through October 2008, 2)
a  hardship plan approving  monthly payments  of $325  effective as of  January 2013; 3)
$325 payments he made in January 2013, November 2014, and December 2015; 4) two
$325  payments  he  made  in  October  2015;  5)  a  $500  payment  he  made  in  December
2015; and 6) federal income tax refund offsets in May 2015 ($1,399), April 2017 ($439),
and May 2019 ($833). (AE A at 8; AE O at 256; AE Q at 272, 273; AE R at 281, 290, 291;
AE S at 300)
Treasury History
Applicant contacted the Treasury immediately upon receiving notice of the transfer
from DFAS in July 2015. The Treasury advised him of the following four options: 1) pay
the debt in full; 2) pay the debt via a three-year repayment plan with monthly payments
of  about  $7,000  (which  was  the  maximum  period  offered);  3)  proceed  with  collections
actions to include an AWG, or 4) get the debt recalled to DFAS. In November 2015, a
private collection agency notified Applicant that it was collecting the debt, with a balance
of $263,491, on behalf of the Treasury. In January 2016, the private collection agency
notified Applicant that it planned to issue an AWG to collect the debt, with a balance of
$262,666, which decreased due to an unexplained reduction in interest and fees. (AE S
at 293-294; Tr. at 31-33, 47-48, 63-65, 94)
On  the  basis  that  Applicant  could  not  afford to  either  pay  the  debt in  full  or  the
monthly payment required by the three-year repayment plan, he continued his efforts to
contest the default status of the debt and the AWG, and get the debt recalled to DFAS.
He  argued  that  he  was  not  notified  of  the  default  or the  transfer, and  that  the  transfer
created hardship, largely due to the Treasury’s 30% fee. He wrote letters to DFAS and
his U.S. senator, negotiated with the Treasury’s private collection agency, and requested
an administrative determination to contest the AWG before a DFAS hearing officer. He
hired a law firm to assist him with these efforts. (AE C at 22-24; AE S at 295-296; AE U;
Tr. at 31-33, 47-48, 63-65, 102)
None  of  Applicant’s  efforts  were  successful.  He  was  unable  to  negotiate  a
reasonable  repayment  plan  with  the  Treasury’s  private  collection  agency,  which
suggested that he “max out” his credit cards to pay the debt in full. Although it accepted
a good-faith $500 payment, the private collection agency only credited his account with
$250. He presumed that they took the other half for their fee. After a thorough review of
the matter, in January 2016, his senator concluded that DFAS had worked diligently with
Applicant regarding the matter. In April 2016, the DFAS hearing officer validated the debt
and its default status. The DFAS hearing officer concluded that the balance of $262,666
(including the Treasury’s 30% fee) was correct, and that the AWG should proceed in an
amount  not  to  exceed  15%  of  Applicant’s  disposable  pay.  Since  then,  the  debt  has
remained in collection status with the Treasury, which requires that he repay the debt via
the AWG. The Treasury has not offered an alternative voluntary repayment arrangement.
(AE C at 28; AE S at 300; AE X at 355; Tr. at 31-33, 47-48, 64-65, 94, 102)
The  DFAS  hearing  officer’s decision  included  the  following  relevant findings of fact:
1)  Applicant   made   $16,984   in   direct  payments  to   DFAS   before   the   default;   2)  he   had
ample  opportunity  to  repay the  debt at  a  more  reasonable  rate,  but failed  to  adhere to  the
terms   and   conditions   of  the   repayment   plan;  3)  the   repayment   plan   was  cancelled
because   he   became   delinquent  with   his payments;   4)  he   was  provided   more   than   the
allowable time to make arrangements to repay the debt; 5) he  provided  no evidence that
warranted  a  new  repayment  plan;  and  6)  the  appropriate  collection  actions  and  fee
accruals were taken in accordance with applicable law. (AE S at 297-301)
The  DFAS  hearing  officer  advised  Applicant  of  various  other  options  for  relief,
including filing a request for reconsideration of financial hardship through the Treasury
Department;  petitioning  the  Board  of  Correction  of  Military  Records  (BCMR)  if  he
disagreed with the information reported on his military record; or petitioning for a waiver
of  indebtedness  if  he  felt  that  an  injustice  had  occurred.  The  record  did  not  indicate
whether Applicant availed himself of any of these options. (AE S at 301)
In May 2016, the Treasury issued the AWG to collect a balance of $262,666. The
AWG amount is calculated by the employer based on a formula provided by the Treasury.
Applicant’s former employer calculated the monthly AWG amount as $1,495, with which
it complied from May 2016 through November 2018. The AWG was not in place between
December 2018 and December 2022, due to Applicant’s change in employment and not
to any inaction on his part. He timely notified the Treasury of his employment change,
and his current employer of the AWG.  The Treasury advised him  that the AWG would
automatically transfer to his current employer, and that the transfer process could take up
to one year. The Treasury did not require him to make direct payments during the period
when the AWG was not in place. (AE D at 29-33; AE E, N, O; AE Q at 268-269, 271-273;
Tr. at 33, 35-36, 66, 68-70, 97-98, 100-101, 125-126)
In  October 2019,  the Treasury  effected  the  AWG  transfer  to  Applicant’s  current
employer. However, it immediately suspended the AWG because Applicant disputed the
balance of $218,319, arguing that payment records showed he was entitled to a credit of
$2,821.  In  December  2021,  upon  advice  of  counsel  in  connection  with  this  security
clearance  proceeding,  Applicant  made  a  one-time  direct  payment  of  $1,495  to  the
Treasury,  to  demonstrate  his  good-faith  intention  to  repay  the  debt.  In  January  2022,
when  the  Treasury  issued  its  response  to  Applicant’s  dispute,  the  AWG  immediately
resumed  through  his  current  employer.  His  current  employer  calculated  the  bi-weekly
AWG amounts as: $811 from January 2022 through February 2022; $806 from February
2022  through  mid-May  2022;  and  $842  beginning  in  mid-May  2022.  He  proffered
documents  corroborating  his  current  employer’s  compliance  with  the  AWG  through
November 2022. (AE H, M; AE Q at 275-278; Tr. at 48, 70-71, 93-95, 97, 99-100)
The  record  did  not  indicate  the  reason  for  the  Treasury’s  delayed  response  to
Applicant’s dispute between October 2019 and January 2022. However, it can reasonably
be  attributed  to  either  the  COVID-19  pandemic  or  some  other  circumstance  beyond
Applicant’s  control.  During  that  period,  he  called  the  Treasury  “six  or  seven  times”  to
check on the status. In its response, the Treasury informed Applicant that his dispute was
construed as a request for a new AWG hearing to which he was not entitled. The Treasury
did not otherwise address the credit, which Applicant does not expect to receive. (AE Q
at 275-278; Tr. at 103-105)
Applicant explained why he has not made, nor intends to make, additional direct
payments to the Treasury (besides the one made in December 2021) to help reduce the
balance of the debt. First, direct payments will not change the collection status of the debt.
Second, until recently, he had not been able to pay more. Third, he has no obligation to
pay more than the income-driven amount of the AWG. Finally, he has not been offered
any option to resolve the debt besides by paying it in full. To that end, he is working to
save enough money to pay the debt in full “in the next few years.” In the meantime, he
intends to continue reducing the balance of the debt through the AWG. He estimated that,
at the current bi-weekly AWG amount, the debt will be fully resolved through the AWG in
about seven years. (Tr. at 32, 37, 38-39, 52, 66-67, 70, 75, 78, 79-81, 88-89, 107-108)
Income and Expense History
Applicant has only experienced delinquent debt one other time. Sometime in 2012,
he fell behind in his payments on the first and second mortgage loans on a rental property
he  owned.  He  lost  a  renter  and  exhausted  his  savings  trying  to  stay  current  on  his
mortgage  payments.  After  unsuccessfully  attempting  to  refinance  the  loan  or  sell  the
property,  he  fully  resolved  both  loans  in  2013  via  a  short  sale  to  which  both  lenders
agreed. He has owned his current home since October 2010. (AE X at 354; Tr. at 71-73)
In  a  July  2012  financial  statement  submitted  to  DFAS,  Applicant  reported  a
$10,389 monthly income, including $8,889 wages and $1,500 rental income, and monthly
expenses totaling $10,078. In a February 2016 financial statement submitted to DFAS,
he reported a $13,218 monthly income, consisting solely of his wages, monthly expenses
totaling $12,820, two savings account balances totaling $25, and non-delinquent credit-
card debt totaling $33,069. (AE R at 282-289; AE S at 302-305)
In May 2016, Applicant took out a $41,000 hardship loan from his 401(k) retirement
account to pay non-delinquent debt and other expenses so that he had sufficient funds
for the AWG amounts taken from his paycheck. At the time, he had about $40,000 of non-
delinquent  credit-card  accounts  and  car  loans.  During  a  July  2017  security  clearance
interview, he reported a $7,488 monthly net income, after payment of the $1,484 Treasury
AWG, and a $598 net remainder. In November 2018, he began repaying his 401(k) loan
via  monthly  payments  of  $753.  As  of  the  hearing,  the  401(k)  loan  was  fully  paid.  He
estimated that he paid about $47,000 or $48,000 in total to repay the 401(k) loan. (AE V;
AE X at 356; Tr. at 39, 66-67, 74-75, 85-86)
Applicant’s annual salary has steadily increased from about $50,000, when he first
applied  for  the  hardship  repayment  plan  with  DFAS  (date  unclear from  the  record),  to
$180,000, as of February 2021. He attributed his improved financial situation over the last
several years to the variable commission he received in addition to his salary. He used
his commissions of about $22,000 in 2019, about $40,000 in 2020, and $100,000 in 2021
to decrease his reliance on credit; eliminate non-delinquent credit-card debt and two car
loans; and to increase contributions to his retirement and savings accounts. He took these
measures to ensure that he is able to fully resolve the debt and maintain an overall “good
financial  status.”  In  his  April  2022  monthly budget,  Applicant  reported  a  no  credit-card
debt,  a  gross  salary  of  $7,837,  a  net  remainder  of  $2,135,  a  $1,684  payment  for  the
Treasury AWG, a $470 retirement account contribution, and a savings account balance
of  $50,000.  No  delinquent  debts  appeared  on  his  September  20,  2022  credit  bureau
report. (AE F, G; AE J at 95; Tr. at 41-45, 73, 79, 84-85, 89-91)
Whole-Person Concept
Applicant has not  had  any performance  issues at work. Numerous individuals who
wrote  letters on  his behalf,  and  the  two  witnesses who  testified,  lauded his character and
work performance.  By all  accounts,  he  is highly respected  for his “impeccable” work ethic
and  trustworthiness.  Applicant  is “incredibly  involved” with  the  community, including  youth
football.  He  previously  served   on   the   board  of  directors   of   a   youth   football   league   for
whom   he   continues  to   coach,  despite   not   having   any   children   playing   football   for  the
league. He  also volunteers his  time  to  help  with  his  local  high  school’s football  program
and his  local fair. His employer recognized  his  exceptional work performance  in 2019  and
2020. He  received  a  $2,000  cash  award  from  his employer in  January 2021. (AE  C at 26-
27; AE  J  at 96-102; AE  K, L; Tr. at 8-21, 48-51)
