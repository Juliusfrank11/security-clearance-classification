In his Answer, Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a  - 1.j with no further explanations.
His  admissions  are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings
of fact.
Applicant is 70 years old, married and has two adult children. He grew up in India
and  served  in  the  United  Kingdom  Merchant  Navy  from  about  1973  through  1982.  He
earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  the United  States  in  1983  and became a  United States
citizen in 1991. He started with his current employer as a port engineer in January 2021
and has since been promoted to a managerial position. (GX 1-2; Tr. 23)
In his March 2021 SCA, Applicant disclosed about $415,000 in delinquent federal
income tax debt for tax years (TY) 2015, 2016, 2018 and 2019. He also disclosed being
delinquent  for  the  deficiency  balance  on  a  mortgage  after  he  sold  the  property  in
November 2020 for less than the mortgage value of about $1,460,000. (GX 1)
In  his  April  2021  interview  with  a  security  clearance  background  investigator,
Applicant estimated that his federal income tax debt had increased to $500,000 for TYs
2015,  2016,  2018  and  2019.  He  also  disclosed  $73,500  in  State  income  tax  debt  for
TYs  2016  through  2019  as  well  as  about  $25,000  in  delinquent  property  taxes.  He
further  clarified  that  he  owed  about  $185,000  for  the  deficiency  balance  on  the
mortgage. (GX 2)
Applicant explained that from about 1990 through 2009, he worked in the United
States for a large shipbuilder that was based overseas. In about 2004-2005, he became
the CEO of a newly formed subsidiary of that company in the United States. His salary
as CEO was $346,000 plus annual bonuses of up to $120,000. He described this work
as lucrative, but very stressful. During this time, he also purchased a minority share in
two local hotels and earned an annual dividend of up to $200,000. (GX 1-2; Tr. 19-24,
35-37).
In  2008,  Applicant  borrowed  substantial  funds  to  build  a  nearly  $2,000,000
“dream  home”  (Home  B).  He  then  converted  his  previous  residence  (Home  A)  into  a
rental  property.  Later  that  year,  the  housing  market  collapsed,  and  Home  B  became
worth substantially less than the purchase price. (GX 1-2; Tr. 25-30)
Despite  the  uncertain  economic  times,  Applicant  resigned  from  his job  in  2009,
believing  he  could  earn  a  comparable  salary  as  a  consultant.  However,  the  economic
slowdown  scaled  back  work  in  his  field  and  he  struggled  to  maintain  a  consistent
income.  He  also  stopped  receiving  dividends  from  his  hotel  investment.  (GX 1-2;
Tr. 25-27)
From  2010  through  early  2014,  Applicant’s  intermittent  consulting  work  earned
him  about  $100,000  annually.  However,  it  was  not  enough  to  maintain  his  financial
commitments. During this period, he depleted his savings and sold his wife’s jewelry. He
also  tried  to  sell  Home  B,  but  the  property  was  worth  less  than  what  he  owed  on  the
mortgage  and  he  was  unable  to  get  the  lender  to  agree  to  a  short  sale.  (GX  1-2;
Tr. 27-30)
Applicant  made  several  early  withdrawals  from  his  401k  retirement  account  in
order to pay his mortgage and bills. He filed his tax returns on time with the assistance
of  an  accountant,  but  failed  to  pay  all  taxes  or  the  penalties  due  for  his  401K
withdrawals.  Applicant  began  accruing  delinquent  tax  debt  in  2011  and  was  assessed
underpayment penalties from 2011 through 2014 that he was unable to address at the
time. (GX 1-2; Tr. 21-27)
From  late  2014  through  early  2019,  Applicant  worked  as  a  consultant  for  his
former  employer,
the  shipbuilder.  He  primarily  worked  overseas  and  earned
approximately  $200,000  annually.  With  this  income,  Applicant  paid  much  of  his
delinquent tax debt for TYs 2011 through 2014. (GX 1-2; Tr. 21-22, 30)
However,  while  resolving  one  tax  problem,  Applicant  created  another.  Because
he  was  a  consultant,  and  not  a  company  employee,  his  former  employer  did  not
withhold income taxes from his pay. Although Applicant continued to timely file his tax
returns  from  2015  through  2019,  he  repeatedly  failed  to  fully  pay  taxes  when  due.
(GX 1-2; Tr. 22, 30-32)
In early 2019, Applicant’s consultancy work for his former employer  ended and
he once again struggled to secure new work. He stopped making any payments on his
delinquent taxes at that time. In 2020, his financial difficulties were further exacerbated
when  business  slowed  because  of  closures  related  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic.
(GX 1-2; Tr. 22-25, 35-38)
In  November  2020,  Applicant  sold  Home  B  at  a  loss  and  moved  back  into  his
previously rented Home A. Since starting with his current employer in January 2021, he
has  maintained  a  steady  income  and  currently  earns  $139,000  annually.  Additionally,
since he is now a W-2 employee, a substantial portion of his annual tax obligations are
withheld by his employer. (GX 1-2; AX A; Tr. 23-25, 35-39)
The SOR allegations and relevant evidence are summarized below.
SOR  ¶¶   1.a-1.d:   delinquent   federal  income   taxes   for  TY   2015   ($153,379),
TY  2016   ($169,415),   TY   2018   ($73,449)   and  TY  2019   ($53,695).  Applicant  admitted
each  allegation  and  the  delinquent  taxes  are  reflected  in  an  April  2021  IRS  account
summary.  The  evidence  provided  does  not  show  comprehensive  detail  of  Applicant’s
tax account activities for TYs 2015 through 2019. However, it does reflect a number of
payments  that  he  made  to  the  IRS.  In  2016,  he  paid  about  $40,000  that  was  applied
toward  tax  debts  for  TYs  2012  and  2013.  In  2017,  he  paid  about  $78,000  that  was
applied toward tax debts for TYs 2012 and 2016, as well as an estimated payment for
TY  2017.  In  2018,  he  paid  about  $202,000  that  was  applied  toward  tax  debts  for  TYs
2012, 2014 and 2017, as well as an estimated payment for  TY 2018. In 2019, he paid
about  $36,000  that  was  applied  toward  tax  debts  for  TYs  2012  and  2013.  (GX  1-3;
AX C)
From  January  through  March  2020,  Applicant  made  monthly  payments  of  $580
toward  his  federal  tax  debt,  payments  that  were  applied  toward  TY  2015.  He  stopped
making  payments  in  March  2020  because  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  economic
slowdown affected his ability to pay. He made no payments until July 2021. From then
through  January  2022,  he  made  monthly  payments  of  $520  that  were  also  applied
toward  TY  2015.  In  February  2022,  he  made  a  $20,176  payment  for  TY  2020.  In
December  2022,  he  made  a  $22,000  payment  for  TY  2021.  However,  from  January
2023  through  the  hearing  in  June  2023,  he  did  not  issue  any  payments  to  the  IRS
beyond his employer’s W-2 withholdings. (GX 2-3; AX C; Tr. 32-34)
At hearing, Applicant explained that he still owed about $10,000 for TY 2021 that
related  to  income  from  his  hotel  investment.  In  total,  Applicant  estimated  he  currently
owes about $450,000 in delinquent federal taxes. He hired a tax attorney in September
2022 to assist in communicating with the IRS and setting up a payment plan for all of his
delinquent  tax  years.  However,  as  of  the  hearing,  no  payment  plan  had  been
established.  Instead,  he  was  considering  communicating  with  the  IRS  directly.  In  his
post-hearing  statement,  he  explained  that  he  now  had  monthly  disposable  income  of
about  $2,000  and  reiterated  his  intent  to  approach  the  IRS  in  the  near  future  and
establish a payment plan. (AX A; Tr. 23, 34-35, 65-70)
SOR  ¶¶   1.e-1.h:  delinquent   State  taxes   for  TY   2016   ($20,385),  TY  2017
($21,685),  TY  2018   ($22,045),   and  TY   2019   ($9,352).  Applicant  admitted  each
allegation and State tax account records reflect that he entered into a payment plan in
May 2019, but defaulted on that plan in October 2019. Thereafter, the debt transferred
to a collection agency. In June 2021, he initiated monthly payments of $200 through the
collection agency. (GX 2, 4; Tr. 40-41)
An April 2022 statement from the collection agency showed that Applicant owed
the State about $88,160 for TYs 2016 through 2019. Applicant also owed $3,079 for TY
2020  that  was  incorporated  into  the payment  plan. In  May 2022,  his  monthly  payment
increased to $250 and he has made required monthly payments since. (GX 2, 4; AX D;
Tr. 40-41)
SOR  ¶   1.i:  delinquent   property  taxes   of   $25,683.   Records  reflect  that  this
amount was due  for  TYs  2017 through  2021  for Home A. At hearing, Applicant  stated
he  had  recently  paid  this  debt.  A  June  2023  account  statement  from  the  locality
confirmed that he had paid these delinquent taxes, though the date he did so is unclear.
However,  he  owes  $2,807  for  TY  2023,  which  includes  penalties  and  interest.  (GX 5;
AX A, E; Tr. 42, 70-72)
SOR  ¶   1.j:  mortgage   deficiency   balance   of   $185,014   following   November
2020  sale  of  Home  B.  In January 2021, Applicant entered into an agreement with the
lender  and  began  making  monthly  payments  of  $550.  A  May  2023  payment  history
shows that, in May 2022, payments increased to $625 per month. Applicant continues
to make monthly payments pursuant to that agreement and the balance has reduced to
about $155,000. (GX 1-2, 6-8; AX F; Tr. 43)
Outside  of  the  accounts  alleged  in  the  SOR,  Applicant  has  no  additional
delinquent debts. He submitted a budget reflecting that, after paying his obligations, he
maintains  a  net  remainder  of  about  $2,300  per  month.  Although  he  listed  State  and
property taxes in this budget, he did not include a payment for his delinquent federal tax
obligations. (GX 7-8; AX B)
Applicant described himself as an upstanding, loyal and proud citizen. He stated
he maintained a strong work ethic and would continue to  strive toward overcoming the
financial hardships he experienced and resolving his tax issues. (AX A; Tr. 75-76)
