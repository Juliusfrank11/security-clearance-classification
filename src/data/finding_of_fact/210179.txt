(Answer; Tr. at 5, 12-13, 14-15, 29, 33, 41-44, 53; GE 1-2)
Applicant lived in state A for 25 years until July 2019, when she moved to state B,
where  she  currently  resides.  She  has  been  taking  medication  prescribed  by  her
neurologist  for  epilepsy  since  2013.  In  2015,  she  realized  she  was  experiencing
depression symptoms and she sought the care of a psychiatrist, who diagnosed her with
depression. Under her psychiatrist’s care, she took the maximum dose of a prescribed
medication to manage her depression symptoms. Although she  felt “somewhat better,”
her symptoms persisted. She consulted with her psychiatrist, who then wanted to switch
her to a different medication. After researching online its possible detrimental side effects
on her health and the potential that it would make her depression worse, she elected not
to  switch  her  medication.  She  stated,  “that  was  the  only  treatment  option  that  my
psychiatrist offered me,” and she did not discuss with her psychiatrist the possibility of a
different treatment option or seek a second opinion. (Tr. at 13-14, 17-29, 30-32, 34, 46,
49, 52-53; GE 1-3; AE B, C)
Applicant  researched  the  therapeutic  benefits  about  the  use  of  psilocybin
mushrooms, a Schedule I substance under the Controlled Substances Act, to treat her
persistent depression, and she decided to try it. She did not consult with her doctors about
whether it would have an adverse effect on her prescribed medications. She purchased
psilocybin  mushrooms  from  an  individual  who  grew  it,  whom  she  met  through  an
acquaintance. She orally consumed four grams on five occasions between August 2018
and April 2019, at her home, to self-treat her depression. (SOR ¶ 1.a) This was the first
time she used illegal drugs, and she has not used any illegal drugs since then. She did
not  inform  her  psychiatrist  that  she  was  self-medicating.  She  found  that  her  use  of
psilocybin  mushrooms  significantly  alleviated  her  symptoms,  and  she  stopped  taking
them because she felt better.  During this period,  she  continued  to take her prescribed
medications. When she moved to state B, her new psychiatrist reduced the amount of her
prescribed medication, and she has found this dosage effective. Her spouse is aware of
her use of psilocybin mushrooms. (Tr. at 13-14, 17-29, 30-32, 34-36, 39, 46-51, 53-54,
56; GE 1-3; AE B, C)
Applicant  disclosed  information  about  her  use  of  psilocybin  mushrooms  on  her
November  2020  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  and  during  her  March  2021
background  interview.  She  stated  on  her  SCA  and  indicated  during  her  background
interview that she intended to continue to use psilocybin mushrooms in the future if her
symptoms returned. (SOR ¶ 1.b) At the hearing, she clarified that she meant she would
consider using it under the care of her psychiatrist if it was legalized under federal and
state law. (Tr. at 13-14, 17-32, 36-40, 55-57; GE 1-3; AE B, C)
Applicant is committed to seeking professional help with treating her depression in
the future. Unlike her psychiatrist in state A, her psychiatrist in state B discussed with her
other treatment options that they could explore should her symptoms return or worsen.
She sees her psychiatrist and neurologist once every six months. She also has hobbies,
to include yoga, gardening, and hiking, to help her cope with her depression. She stated
that she does not socialize with anyone involved with drugs. If she were to find herself in
a situation where illegal drugs are being used, she would leave. She intends to abide by
her employer’s policy against using illegal drugs. In April 2023, she signed a statement of
intent to refrain from using any illegal substances, or abusing any legal substance, and
that any violation would result in her losing her security clearance. (Tr. at 27-31, 39-41,
44-46, 54-55; AE A)
