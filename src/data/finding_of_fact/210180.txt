Under  Guideline  F,  the  SOR  alleged  that  in  January  2019,  Applicant  was
discharged of his debts through a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition he filed in September
2018  (SOR  1.a).  It  further  alleged  that  he  owed  $7,735  for  six  past-due  or  delinquent
debts (SOR 1.b – 1.g). In response, he admitted each allegation (with comments), thus
establishing  them  as  facts.  Based  on  my  review  of  the  information  presented  in  the
FORM, I make the following additional findings of fact. (FORM, Item 1)
Applicant  is  a  40-year-old  employee  of  a  federal  contractor,  for  whom  he  has
worked since July 2022. He earned an associate degree in 2019, and he has taken other
courses at a vocational and technical school. He and his wife have been married since
2004 and have three children under age 18. (FORM, Item 2)
Applicant served on active duty and in the reserves between July 2004 and March
2012. He held a security clearance while in the military. In 2010, a reinvestigation of his
eligibility  for  clearance  showed  that  he  was  delinquent  or  past  due  on  at  least  eight
personal credit accounts. Based on his representations that he was receiving financial
counseling and that he was paying or otherwise resolving his debts, adjudicators decided
to renew his clearance on a conditional basis. (FORM, Items 2, 3, 7, and 8)
In his July 2022 e-QIP, Applicant disclosed that, as alleged in SOR 1.a, he was
discharged of his debts through a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. As co-debtors, he and
his wife declared assets of $38,950 against liabilities totaling $117,840. Unsecured claims
against  them  totaled  $96,954.  During  the  background  investigation  initiated  when  he
submitted  his  e-QIP,  investigators  obtained  a  credit  report  that  reflects  the  delinquent
debts  alleged  in  SOR  1.b  –  1.g.  Applicant  discussed  those  debts  with  an  investigator
during a personal subject interview (PSI) on November 29, 2022. During the PSI and in
response  to  the  SOR,  he  stated  that  his  recent  financial  problems  arose  from  a
combination of lost income during the COVID pandemic, brief periods of unemployment,
and a few ill-advised financial decisions. He also acknowledged having financial problems
while he was in the military, which he resolved by taking out a loan to pay his past-due
debts.  As  of  his  PSI,  he  reported  after  expenses  having  little  remaining  money  each
month, and he expressed a general intent to resolve his financial problems. In his April
2023  response  to  the  SOR,  he  stated  that  he  either  is  on  or  is  working  to  establish
repayment plans for his debts. He further claims to have reduced the $511 debt alleged
at SOR 1.d to $297. He did not submit any corroborating documents in response to the
Government’s information. He has not received financial counseling since 2010. (FORM,
Items 1, 2, 3, and 6)
After leaving active duty in 2011, Applicant worked in a series of jobs before being
hired by his current employer. Between 2013 and 2021, he was unemployed three times
for a  total of 15 months,  most  recently  between  May  2020 and February 2021,  due  in
large part to the COVID pandemic. During that time, he received benefit payments from
the  government,  which  he  used  to  pay  rent  and  buy  food.  He  has  been  continuously
employed since February 2021.
