Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f. He denied that his federal student loans
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d) were delinquent, as alleged. His admissions are incorporated into the
findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits
submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 36 years old. He has been married since 2018. He and his wife have
a five-year-old son and an 18-month-old daughter. He also has an eight-year-old son from
a prior relationship. (GE 1; Tr. 22, 29) After graduating from high school in 2005, he served
in the National Guard from 2006 to 2020. His service included a deployment to Iraq in
2009 to 2010. He was discharged honorably. Applicant attended community college  in
2010 to 2011 and had some technical school training in 2019. (GE 1; AE H, Tr. 40-41)
Applicant was a DOD employee from 2014 to 2017 as a mechanic. He held various
other jobs, mostly in the defense industry, in the years since then. He has worked for his
current  employer  and  clearance  sponsor  since  February  2022.  He  now  works  in
information technology. He earns a $110,000 annual salary. He has a clearance (GE 1;
AE F; Tr. 8, 27, 48-49, 53)
Since September 2022, Applicant has also worked a second job, earning $50 an
hour.  He  took  the  second  job  to  pay  down  his  credit  card  debt  and  said  he  has  been
making “great strides” in doing so. (Tr. 29-30, 36-39) He assessed that he earns about
$8,500 a month from his two jobs combined. (Tr. 49-50)
The debts in the SOR are established by credit reports from September 2020 and
May  2021.  (GE  3,  GE  4)  Applicant  disclosed  some  debts  on  his  SCA  and  said  they
occurred because his wife lost her job. (GE 1)
SOR  debts  ¶¶  1.a  ($10,262),  1.b  ($10,193),  1.c  ($4,744),  and  1.d  ($4,415)  are
past-due federal student loans owed to the Department of Education for a total of $29,614.
(GE 3,  GE  4)  Credit reports reflect that the  accounts  were  last  active  in  either February
2017 (GE  4) or September 2020. (GE 3)
Applicant took three or four semesters of community college classes, from 2010 to
2011, after returning from his overseas deployment. He took out about $18,000 in federal
student loans. They came due in 2012 when he entered the workforce. He did not make
any student loan payments from 2012 to 2017. In part, this was because he did not have
a solid job or good income until joining DOD in 2014. (Tr. 19-23, 42-43) His wife also lost
her job as a logistics manager twice, once in 2018 and again in 2020; the second job loss
was due to the impact of COVID-19. She remains unemployed. (Tr. 28-29)
Applicant said he signed an agreement with the student loan collector in 2018 to
bring his accounts into good standing. He had to make nine payments of $100 a month
to do so. He believes his loans have been in good standing since then. He was told that
a new debt collector will assume his student loans but was not told whom to pay. He said
he calls every month to try to learn if the loans have been reacquired. (Tr. 19-26, 30-39)
Applicant  was  not  required  to  make  payments  after  the  loans  were  placed  in
forbearance  status  by the  Department  of  Education  at  the  beginning  of  the  COVID-19
pandemic in early 2020. He used the opportunity to address other debts such as credit
cards. He knows that the program is ending in October 2023. He made a $150 payment
in July 2023. (AE E) During the forbearance program, he addressed other debts, such as
credit cards. (Tr. 19, 26, 30-39)
Applicant documented payoff information for his student loans as of July 21, 2023.
He is in good standing, and a current credit report confirms this. (AE A, AE B, AE I) He
intends  to  begin  an  aggressive  repayment  plan  once  the  student  loans  come  out  of
forbearance without exhausting his credit. (Tr. 26-27, 47-48, 58)
SOR  ¶  1.e  ($274) is an  account  that  was  charged  off  by  a  bank.  (GE  3,  GE  4)
Applicant testified that this debt has been resolved. SOR ¶ 1.f ($688) is an account placed
for collection by a phone company. (GE 3) He paid this debt in late June 2023 (Tr. 44-46)
He  documented  two  other  debt  payments  from  June  2023,  an  energy  bill  and  an
entertainment account. (AE C, AE D)
Applicant  has  a  401(k)  plan  and  savings  in  a  bank  account.  Those  documents
reflect that has several thousand dollars in savings. (AE F, AE G) He pays $1,000 in child
support  for  his  oldest  son.  A  current  credit  report  shows  a  balance  of  about  $41,000,
though  the  account  is  now  current.  (AE  I).  Applicant  has  no  other  delinquencies  or
extravagances. His monthly expenses are in good standing. He has no tax debt or unfiled
tax returns. He has not had formal credit counseling, but the family uses a budget. (Tr.
30-31, 46-47; AE I)
Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  has  made  some  poor  financial  decisions.  He
wants to continue to build good credit. He loves his job and loved serving his country in
uniform. (Tr. 51, 58)
