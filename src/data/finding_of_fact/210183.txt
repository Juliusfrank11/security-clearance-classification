In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted,  without  comment,  the  single
allegation of drug involvement (SOR ¶ 1.a). His admission is incorporated in my findings
of fact.
Applicant  is  a  49-year-old  systems  engineering  manager  sponsored  by  a
successive  defense  contractor  since  January  2021.  He  graduated  from  high  school  in
June 1992, and subsequently enrolled in a full-time university program of study in August
1992. He completed the program in May 1996 and was awarded a bachelor’s degree. He
continued his education in August 1998 and was awarded a master’s degree in May 2004.
Applicant married in November 2003, and divorced in about April 2007. He does not have
children. (Items 2 and 3)
Applicant disclosed he first used marijuana in high school in May 1991, and that
he  continued  to  use  it  casually  through  about  1995.  (Item  4  at  3)  In  August  1995,  he
disclosed  he  was  criminally  charged  with  possession  of  drug  paraphernalia.  After
admitting responsibility and satisfying program requirements, he successfully completed
probation before judgment, a pretrial diversion program. He stated the charge was later
expunged from his record. (Item 2 at 45, and Item 4 at 3) Applicant’s drug involvement in
1995 is not alleged in the SOR.
In  about  April  2011,  Applicant  completed  his  first  application  for  a  public  trust
position. He was granted eligibility for access to sensitive information about a month later.
He  subsequently  submitted  an  SCA  in  April  2018,  seeking  eligibility  for  access  to
classified information. Applicant stated in his 2021 SCA, that he was granted eligibility for
access to top-secret information during the same month. (Item 2 at 50)
In  his  September  2021  SCA,  Applicant  disclosed  he  purchased  and  used
marijuana from about July 2021 through August 2021. (SOR ¶ 1.a) He explained that he
sustained  a “debilitating  back injury” and  decided to use marijuana to help alleviate his
sciatic nerve pain. He purchased the marijuana he used in the  form of edibles, from a
local  dispensary.  He  stated  he  ingested  it  about  three  to  five  times  during  this  period.
(Item 2 at 47-48; and Item 3 at 5)
Applicant stated he also sought medical treatment through a chiropractor, and that
after a few weeks of rehabilitation and after purchasing a new mattress, he stopped using
marijuana in about August 2021. He has not received drug counseling or treatment, and
he stated he does not socialize or associate with any person who uses drugs illegally.
(Item 2 at 47-48; and Item 3 at 5)
In his September 2021 SCA, Applicant responded “yes” to the question of whether
he used marijuana while possessing a security clearance. (Item 2 at 48) (SOR ¶ 1.a, in
part) Notwithstanding this disclosure, there is no independent evidence in the record to
establish he was “granted access to classified information” when he used marijuana from
July 2021 through August 2021, as alleged. Applicant also acknowledged understating at
the  time  he  purchased  and  used  marijuana,  that  marijuana  remains  a  federally  illegal
controlled substance.
Applicant stated his intention to refrain from using marijuana or any illegal drugs in
the  future  in  his  September  2021  SCA,  and  later  signed  a  similar  sworn  statement  in
February 2023. (Item 2 at 48, and Item 4 at 4)
