Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
The SOR alleges  under Guideline H that Applicant  used marijuana with varying
frequency  from  April  1992  to  about  January  2022.  (SOR  ¶  1.a.)  His  use  of  marijuana
continued for 30 years until shortly before he completed his SCA. (Items 1, 3 and 4)
Applicant  disclosed  on  the  February  2022  SCA  that  he  had  used  marijuana
between April 1992 and January 2022, “use as needed for [back] pain.” When responding
to the SCA’s inquiry as to his intentions for future use of an illegal drug, he listed that he
intended to use marijuana, as needed for his back pain, and while “not working.” (Item 4)
Applicant  was  interviewed  on  April  5,  2022  by  an  authorized  DOD  investigator.
Applicant admitted that he had used psilocybin mushrooms and LSD on two occasions
between  September  1990  and  September  2015,  which  is  not  alleged  in  the  SOR.
Applicant also admitted he used marijuana at home. He obtained the marijuana from his
friend. He last used marijuana in January 2022, and his motivation for using marijuana
was to relieve his back pain. He acknowledged he did not have a medical prescription to
use marijuana. He has  never had any involvement with  law enforcement for his illegal
drug use, and he has never received treatment, or been diagnosed with a substance use
disorder. He told the investigator that he is “unlikely” to use marijuana again since he is
no longer motivated or interested in using it. (Item 5)
