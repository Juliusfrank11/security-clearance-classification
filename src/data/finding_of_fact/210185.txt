Applicant is a 67-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since August 2019. He served in the U.S. military for a short period
in 1976 before he was medically disqualified with an honorable discharge. He is a high
school  graduate  with  certifications  in  his  field.  He  has  been  married  for  more  than  20
years  after  his  first  two  marriages  ended  in  divorce,  but  he  and  his  wife  have  been
separated since about 2015. He has five adult children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 19-22, 25-28;

Applicant has a history of tax problems, including not filing his federal income tax
returns when they were due for tax years 2016 through 2020 and not paying his federal
income  taxes  when  they  were  due  for  tax  years  2014,  2015,  2017,  2018,  2019,  and
2020.1  He  retained  a  tax  company  in  August  2022  to  file  his  back  returns  and  to
represent him before the IRS for the taxes owed. All of his federal tax returns have been
filed,  with  the  exception  of  tax  year  2016.  He  still  owes  taxes  for  2014,  2015,  2017,
2018, 2019, and 2020. (Tr. at 19, 23, 31-33, 43-44; GE 2, 3; AE 1, 2)
Applicant  did  not  report  tax  issues  on  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security
Positions  (SF  86)  that  he  submitted  in  November  2020,  but  he  wrote:  “To  my
knowledge,  my  wife  has  filed  taxes  and  I  have  not  been  notified  of  any  tax  problems.
With exception of 2014 where I was notified of tax due but have heard nothing since.”
(GE 1)
Applicant  was  interviewed  for  his  background  investigation  in  September  2021.
He  stated  that  his  wife  handled  their  taxes,  and  he  believed  the  matter  was  fully
resolved,  but  he  was  uncertain  because  he  did  not  communicate  with  his  wife.  He
stated that his W-2 and other financial documents were sent to her automatically. Since
he  had  not  heard  from  his  wife  or  the  IRS,  he  assumed  the  tax  issues  had  been
resolved. Applicant’s testimony was similar. He just assumed that his wife was handling
their  taxes,  if  the  IRS  had  any  issues  they  would  contact  him,  and  he  did  not  receive
anything  from  the  IRS.  (Tr.  at  19,  29-30,  40-41,  48-50;  GE  3)  Individual  years  are
discussed below:

wrote: “The IRS requires the past 6 years to be filed in order to be in compliance with
IRS tax filing requirements and to be in good standing with  the IRS; therefore, we are
not filing [Applicant’s] 2016 federal tax return.” (GE 2, 3; AE 1, 2)

10/17/2022.  They were again mailed  to  the  IRS  on  2/14/23. The  IRS has
had   these   returns  since   2/21/23,  but   they  have   not  processed   them.  We
are  currently  in  the   process  of  working   with   the   local  IRS   Taxpayer
Advocate  Service   (TAS) office for them   to   assist  in  processing   the   2017-
2018 Federal tax returns.  (AE  10)

The SOR alleges a $20,271 charged-off credit card debt (SOR ¶ 1.c) and a $53
medical debt in collection (SOR ¶ 1.d). Applicant denied owing both debts. The $20,751
debt is listed on each of the  six credit reports in evidence, including the October 2023
credit report submitted by Applicant. The debt is listed as an individual account that was
opened in 2008 with the last payment in December 2018. He stated that he  has never
had  that  credit  card,  and  he  believes  his  wife  or  someone  else  may  have  opened  the
account in his name. A civil suit by the credit card company against Applicant in a state
where  he  does  not  live  was  dismissed  without  prejudice  in  October  2022.  He  did  not
defend  against  the  suit;  he  received  the  dismissal  order  in  the  mail.  (Tr.  at  23,  55-60;

replacements in 2021;  and  his mother passed  away in 2021. With  the  exception  of his
tax issues  and  the  delinquent credit card debt,  his finances are  in good  shape.  He has
solid  income, and  he  has about  $600,000  in  retirement and  other accounts.  (Tr. at 20-
24, 28, 47;  61-63; GE  3-8; AE  1,  7, 9)
