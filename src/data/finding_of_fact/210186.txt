In Applicant’s SOR response, he denied the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.a and admitted
the allegation in SOR ¶ 2.a. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional
findings follow.
Applicant is a 42-year-old employee of a defense contractor seeking to maintain a
security clearance. He has held a security clearance since 2006.  He started at his current
employer  in  July  2023.  He  worked  for  several  other  contractors  prior  to  his  current
position. He is a high school graduate and has some college credits. He married in 2014,
but separated from his spouse in 2016. He has no children. (Tr. 22-24; Gov 1)
Financial Considerations
The SOR alleges Applicant failed to timely file, as required, his state and Federal
income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2016  to  2020.  (SOR  ¶  1.a:  Gov  1  at  73-74;  Gov  2)
Applicant is also alleged to owe the Federal government, Internal Revenue Service (IRS),
approximately $3,637.02  (initially $8,121)  for unpaid taxes for tax year 2017. (SOR ¶  1.b:
Gov 2  at  13-14)  Applicant disclosed  on  his SCA,  dated  October  28, 2020, that  he  had  not
filed  federal and  state  income  tax  returns  for tax years 2016, 2017,  2018,  and  2019.  (Gov
1, Section  26, at 73-74) On  December 29,  2021, he  provided  additional information  about
the  status of his federal and  state  tax returns in  response  to  DOHA Interrogatories. In  his
response  he  indicated  he  had  not  filed  his state  income  tax returns for tax years 2016  –
2020, because  he  was waiting  for his federal tax returns to  be  completed. He did  not want
to  create  a  financial hardship by owing  both  at  the  same  time. He also  provided  copies of
federal tax transcripts for tax years 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020.  (Gov 2)
In his response to the SOR, Applicant claims that he filed his taxes through tax
year 2021.  He said the IRS has a severe back log. The last update he received from the
IRS was that tax years 2016 - 2018 were processed. They are working on the 2019 taxes
and cannot process later years until it is complete. Applicant states the tax debt incurred
in 2017 should be resolved once the refunds from unprocessed tax returns are applied to
the debt. If he still owes taxes after the income tax returns are processed, he will be able
to pay the balance. (Answer to SOR)
During   the   hearing,   Applicant   admitted   to   being   aware   that  federal  income   tax
returns were  required  to  be  filed  by April 15th  of each  year. He  states  he  stopped  filing  his
federal   and   state   income   tax   returns   in 2016   because  he   was  going   through  a  difficult
period  during  his separation  from  his spouse. He did  not handle  things responsibly.  His
failure to  timely file his federal and  state  income  tax returns created  a  bigger problem. He
had  difficulty finding his W-2s. (Tr. 25-26)
Applicant started  to  file his  late  income  tax returns on  his own in 2020, after he
submitted  his  SCA.  Some  of  the  returns  were  accepted. Some  were  not.  The  IRS  found
issues with  the  2019  federal income  tax return  so  he  had  to  amend  his return. In  February
2023, he  hired  a  tax  professional to  help  with  amending  his 2017  and  2019  federal  and
state  income  tax returns. He believes once  his amended  2017  federal income  tax return
is  processed,  the   balance   of  taxes  owed   for  2017   will   be   completely  resolved   or
significantly   reduced.  Applicant  owed   $8,121.02   in   unpaid   taxes   for   tax   year  2017.
Refunds from  tax  years 2018,  2020,  and  2021   were  applied  to  the  2017  tax  debt.  The
current balance owed for the  2017 tax debt is $3,637.02  (Tr. 20-21,  36-38; AE H; AE I)
On June 23, 2023, Applicant entered into a repayment agreement with the IRS for
the 2017  federal tax debt. He  agreed  to  a monthly payment of $161  via direct  deposit
until the debt is resolved. He made his first payment on August 1, 2023. He will pay it off
sooner when the refund from his 2019 tax return is applied to the 2017 federal tax debt.
(Tr. 26-31, AE J) Once his amended 2017 federal income tax return is processed and
accepted, he believes he will receive a refund of $4,011.
The current status of the federal and state income tax returns and any balances
owed are as follows:
2016   Federal  and   State   Income   Tax  Returns:   Applicant  filed  his  2016  federal
income tax return on June 14, 2021. He does not owe a balance for tax year 2016. (AE

state  income  tax returns are complete  with  the  exception  of tax year 2017. He did not
provide  documents  showing  the  2016  state  income  tax return was  filed  and  resolved.  (Tr.

return. (AE  C)  At the  time  of the  hearing, the  balance  was reduced  to  $3,637.02  due  to
refunds from  other tax  years being  applied  to  the  2017  tax debt.  On  August 23, 2023,
Applicant filed  a  second  amended  federal income  tax  return for 2017  with  the  help of a
tax professional. The  amended  return indicates Applicant is  owed  a  refund  of $4,011  for
tax  year 2017.  (AE   L  at  5-6) Applicant  completed   his 2017   state   income   tax  return  on

his 2019 federal income tax return on August 2, 2023. The IRS contacted him indicating
they are unable to process the 2019 tax transcript at the present time. (AE H) A summary
of Applicant’s account balance with the IRS for tax years 2018 to 2022, indicates he owes
nothing for 2019. (AE I) After the hearing, Applicant provided a duplicate copy of his 2019
federal  income  tax  return,  which  he  signed  on  January  17,  2023.  Applicant  is  owed  a
refund of approximately $1,440. (AE L at 7-16). He also provided a copy of his 2019 state
income tax return which he signed on January 17, 2023. He is owed a state income tax
refund of $140 for tax year 2019. Even though the 2019 state and federal tax returns were
signed, it is not clear that they were filed. (Tr. 32-33; AE L at 17-20)
2020  Federal and  State  Income  Tax Returns:   Applicant’s 2020 federal income tax
return was sent to the IRS on  January 23, 2023. The 2020 IRS transcript indicates he

$1,967, which was transferred to tax year 2017. (Tr. 34; Gov 4 at 27; AE E) The state

income tax refund of $125 for tax year 2020. (Gov 4 at 25)

These are not alleged in the SOR. This information will not be considered for disqualifying
purposes.  They  will  only  be  considered  under  matters  of  extenuation  and  mitigation,
assessment of credibility, and under the whole-person factors.
2021   Federal  and   State   Income   Tax  Returns:   Applicant  filed  his  2021  federal
income  tax  return  on  February  20,  2023.  He  received  a  refund  of  $1,032,  which  was
applied to his 2017 federal tax debt. (Tr. 34; AE F) The 2021 federal income tax return
was sent to the IRS on January 23, 2023. (Gov 5 at 28) The 2021 state income tax return
was sent to the state on January 27, 2023. Applicant owes a $65 balance for his 2021
state income taxes. (Gov 5 at 8 - 22)  Applicant made a payment of $77.76 to the state
comptroller for tax year 2021 on August 9, 2023. (AE A)
2022   Federal  and   State   Income   Tax  Returns:   Applicant  filed  his  2022  federal

is unknown.  He made a payment of $57.49 to the state comptroller on August 15, 2023,
for tax year 2022. It is not clear whether the balance owed is paid off. (Tr. 35; AE K)

monthly income was approximately $6,307. His monthly expenses were approximately
$3,800. His monthly net remainder was about $2,507. (Gov 2 at 9) These numbers have
likely changed because Applicant’s current annual salary is $150,800. (Tr. 24)
Applicant provided documentary proof that he filed his state income tax returns for
tax  years  2017,  2019,  and  2020.  He  did  not  provide  documentary  proof  that  his  state
income tax returns were filed for tax years 2016 and 2018. The record was held open to
allow  him  to  contact  the  state  comptroller’s  office  to  acquire  documentation  about  the
status of his state income tax returns for the years in question.  Applicant claims the state
would only provide the information about his state income tax returns verbally over the
phone. He claims they said the only year that was outstanding was tax year 2017. He
recently filed this return and is expected to receive a refund. (AE M at 1)
