Applicant  admitted  all  the  SOR  allegations  under  Guideline  F.  He  stated  in
response to SOR ¶ 2.a that he did not intentionally falsify his May 2019 security clearance
application  (SCA),  so I  have  construed his response  as a  denial  of  that allegation.  He
neither admitted nor denied SOR ¶ 3.a, so I have construed his silence as a denial of that
allegation. He is 31 years old. As of the date of the hearing, he was not married, and he
did  not  have  any  children.  He  graduated  from  high  school  in  2011  and  subsequently
attended college until 2014 but did not earn a degree. He has rented his current residence
since approximately December 2022. (Answer; Tr. at 7-8, 22-23, 52-53; GE 1)
Applicant worked for a private company from approximately January 2015 to May
2019.  He  was  subsequently  unemployed  until  approximately  September  2020,  in
preparation for joining the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC). He briefly served in the USMC,
from  September  2020  to  January  2021,  when  he  was  administratively  discharged  for
misconduct and received an other than honorable (OTH) discharge, as further discussed
below. In approximately 2021, he accepted a position with a DOD contractor contingent
on obtaining a security clearance, and that company was sponsoring him for a clearance
as of the date of the hearing. He was unemployed for about a month and a half while
awaiting the outcome of his clearance, and then he obtained contract work through an
employment agency. When he was in between contracts, he had one to two brief periods
of  unemployment.  In  2022,  he  began  working  full  time  for  his  employer,  a  private
company, as a security system engineer. He has never held a security clearance. (Tr. at
5, 8-10, 23-36, 52-56, 63-70, 76-77, 80; GE 1, 5; AE D)
The SOR alleged, under Guideline F, that Applicant had two delinquent  student
loans,  totaling  $17,034.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.b)  It  also  alleged  that  he  had  two  delinquent
consumer  debts,  totaling  $22,395  (SOR  ¶¶  1.c,  1.e),  and  a  delinquent  $68  medical
account  (SOR  ¶  1.d). The  Guideline  F  SOR  allegations  are established  by Applicant’s
admissions in his Answer; his May 2019 security clearance application (SCA); three credit
bureau reports from May 2019, September 2021, and September 2022; and his August
2019 interview with an authorized DOD background investigator. (Answer; GE 1-5)
Applicant attributed his delinquent debts primarily to his periods of unemployment
and  underemployment  since  2014,  when  he  left  college  to  begin  working.  His  parents
assisted him financially during this period. He was unaware that he had any delinquent
debts until the investigator asked him about them during his 2019 background interview.
Once he became aware of them, he started to try to resolve them. (Tr. at 23-26, 45, 48,
54-56, 58, 63-68, 75-76; GE 1, 5; AE E)
SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b  are  two  federal  student  loans,  in  collection  for  $8,676  and
$8,358,  respectively.  Applicant  attended  college  on  an  athletic  scholarship  but  lost  his
scholarship after he was injured during his freshman year. His parents bore the cost of
his college tuition at a time when they were experiencing financial difficulties. He believed
his parents paid for his college education and that his father, with whom he has the same
name, obtained these loans to pay for his last years of college. He did not recall signing
any loan paperwork, so he was unaware that he had any student loans, or that the student
loans were delinquent, until he was informed about them during his background interview.
(Tr. at 22-23, 36-42, 58-63; GE 2, 3, 4, 5; AE A, E).
Applicant  indicated  during  his  background  interview  that  he  had  not  been
contacted to repay any outstanding student loans, but he was willing to repay them. At
the hearing, he stated that he understood the loans were his obligation since they were
reported on his credit reports. He believed his parents had been paying these loans in
accordance with a payment arrangement, and he contributed by providing them with $50
monthly,  until  payments  on  his  student  loans  were  deferred  during  the  COVID-19
payment  pause.  The  U.S.  Department  of  Education  deferred  student  loan  payments
beginning in March 2020, to provide relief to borrowers during the COVID-19 pandemic.

interest. He did not provide documentation to corroborate his claims of payment before
the COVID-19 payment pause. He understood that he was obligated to pay these loans
once the payment pause was lifted, and he intended to do so. These student loans are
not reported on the most recent credit bureau report from May 2023. (Tr. at 22-23, 36-42,
58-63; GE 2, 3, 4, 5; AE A, C, E)
SOR ¶ 1.c is an apartment rental account in collection for $3,924. Applicant lived
in this apartment from approximately July 2015 to March 2019, when he broke his lease
to move to a different state in pursuit of better job opportunities. He contacted the creditor
and settled the debt for $2,700, which he stated he paid with savings. As of December
2021, this debt was paid. (Tr. at 42-47, 65-66; GE 2, 3, 4, 5; AE B)
SOR ¶ 1.d is a medical account in collection for $68. Applicant indicated during
his background interview that this debt was for treatment he received in approximately
September 2015. At the hearing, he stated that he paid this debt but he could not recall
when he did so. This debt was not reported on the most recent credit bureau reports from
September 2022 and May 2023. (Tr. at 47, 66; GE 2, 3, 5; AE C)
SOR ¶ 1.e is an auto loan in collection for $18,471. In 2017, Applicant traded his
SUV for a used car. He was subsequently unable to make his monthly payments because
he signed a high interest auto loan, and he was transitioning between jobs. His car was
repossessed in March 2018. He believed that his car was auctioned and sold to cover his
outstanding  balance.  He  stated  that  he  had  never  been  contacted  regarding  any
deficiency balance and he did not believe he had one. Although this debt was reported
with a zero balance on the most recent credit bureau reports from September 2022 and
May 2023, the latter credit bureau report continues to note that this account was charged
off for $18,471. He did not provide documentation of his efforts to address this debt. (Tr.
at 47-50, 66, 75-76; GE 2, 3, 4)
The  SOR also alleged,  under Guideline  E, that Applicant  intentionally falsified  his
response   to   section   26   of  his  May  2019   SCA,   which   inquired   about  his  financial
delinquencies, when   he   marked   “No” and   failed   to   disclose   his delinquent debts in SOR
¶¶  1.a-1.e. (SOR ¶  2.a) As previously stated,  Applicant  indicated  during  his  background
interview  that  he   did   not   list  his  debts   because   he   was   unaware   of   them.  He
acknowledged   at  the  hearing   that   although  he   was   aware   the   car   securing   the  debt  in
SOR ¶  1.e  was repossessed,  he  did not  list it  because  he  was confused  by the question,
since   the   repossession   occurred   before  he   completed   the   SCA.   He  did  not   recall
completing  the  SCA, and  it was the  first time  he  had  ever completed  one. (Tr. at 40, 50-
52, 76-80; GE 5)
Applicant’s  annual  income  as  of  the  date  of  the  hearing  and  since  2022  was
approximately $80,000. His monthly net pay was approximately $5,500. He anticipated
that  his  monthly  net  remainder  after  expenses,  to  include  his  monthly  rent  of  $1,200,
would be approximately $3,200. He uses a budget to manage his finances. He had $5,500
in savings. He has been working to rebuild his credit. Although he stated that he does not
have any other delinquent debts, his most recent credit bureau report from  May 2023,
which reflects a fair credit score, reports a new account in collection for $970. He has not
received credit counseling. (Tr. at 52-58, 76; AE A. C)
As discussed above, Applicant briefly served in the USMC from September 2020
to January 2021, when he was administratively discharged for misconduct and received
an OTH discharge. Records pertaining to his discharge reflect that he was the subject of
non-judicial punishment (NJP) in October 2020, for violating Article 90 (willfully disobeying
a  superior  commissioned  officer)  and  Article  91  (insubordinate  conduct),  when,  in
September  2020  and  November  2020,  he  refused  orders  to  train,  and  he  refused  to
execute such orders. He waived an administrative separation board and understood that
he received a punitive mark on his record and an OTH discharge. He stated:
I  initially  entered   the   Marine   Corps   with   a   0321   contract,  which  is
[reconnaissance]   in  infantry,   which   is  what  I  initially  signed   up   for  and
trained  for. And  then  during  the  pipeline  in my training  process, I  was then
reclassified  to  the  needs of the  Marine  Corps to  aviation  tech, an  aviation
mechanic, essentially, which  was an  undesirable position  for me  to  have.
So  I respectfully went  to  my commanding  officer to  see  if anything  could be
done    to    make    those    changes  and    if  there’s  any  way  that  I  can    either
continue   my   service   in   a   desirable field or leave   the   service   altogether. It’s
just   not   something   that   I’m   -- at   the   time, I was   29   years old, so   I didn’t want
to   be   in a   path   where I   didn’t have  any business being  in or wanted  or any
interest  in. So  my  commanding  officer put me  on  a  quote-unquote  fast track,
which  is an  NJP board, so  I would be  administratively discharged.  (SOR ¶
