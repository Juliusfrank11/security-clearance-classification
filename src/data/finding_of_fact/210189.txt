In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  all  the  allegations,  with
explanations. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  has  worked  in  the  information  technology  field  for  various  federal
contractors since December 2013. He served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from
November  2008  to  October  2013.  He  has  worked  for  his  current  employer  since  May
2018. He received a security clearance while on active duty in the Air Force.
Applicant received an associate degree in January 2011. He married in June 2007
and separated in July 2020. He and his wife have no children. He testified that they have
never divorced, and they remain friends. (Tr. 32-34) However, his SCA reflects that their
marriage was “divorced/dissolved” in July 2020. (GX 1 at 29)
The  SOR  alleges  18  delinquent  debts  totaling  about  $43,179.  The  debts  are
reflected in credit reports from August 2022 (GX 4), January 2022 (GX 5), and August
2023  (GX  6).  Applicant  was  interviewed  about  his  debts  by  a  security  investigator  on
February 4 and February 11, 2022 (GX 2). The evidence concerning the debts alleged in
the SOR is summarized below.
SOR ¶¶  1.a-1.e, 1.h, and 1.k: student  loans  totaling $34,526. During Applicant’s
security  interviews  in  February  2022,  he  told  the  investigator  that  the  loans  were  in
forbearance while he was on active duty and that he made some payments when they
were due and then tried for another forbearance. He told the investigator that he had not
thought about the loans for a while. (GX 2 at 5) In his answer to the SOR, he provided
documentation  that  he  had  applied  for  consolidation  of  his  loans  into  an  income-
contingent repayment plan on November 28, 2022. He stated that the consolidation would
be effective on December 5, 2022, but he provided no documentation showing that his
application was approved. As of the date the record closed, he had made no payments
under the plan because of the COVID-19 forbearance. (Tr. 57)
SOR ¶  1.f:  student  loan for $3,695. Applicant and his wife initiated this loan in
August 2007.  At the  time, Applicant’s wife  handled  the  family finances, and  he  did not
keep  track  of  its  status.  He  provided  no  evidence  of  the  status  of  this  loan.  It  is  not
resolved. (Tr. 59-61)
SOR ¶¶  1.i  and 1.r:  credit-card accounts, referred for collection of  $2,580  and
$715. Applicant told the  investigator that he  “maxed  out” the  account alleged  in SOR ¶  1.i
by purchasing  Christmas gifts, and he  could not  make  payments  after being  laid  off  for a
short time  and  falling  behind  on  the  payments  on  his truck and his home. (GX 2  at 4; Tr.
82-86)  He  told  the  security investigator that  he  would make  an  immediate  $15  payment
on this debt and follow with larger payments. (GX 2 at 4) At the hearing, he was not sure
of  the   status   of   this   debt.   (Tr.  82)  After  the   hearing,  he   submitted   evidence   of   a   two
payment plans with  the  same  collection  agency for the  debts alleged  in SOR ¶¶  1.i and
1.r. One  plan  provides  for monthly payments  of $50,  with  46  payments remaining,  and
the  other plan  provides  for monthly payments of $121, with  four payments remaining. His
documentation  does not reflect which  credit-card account will  receive the  $50  payment
and  which  will  receive the  $121  payment.  Both  payment plans were  scheduled  to  begin
on September  30, 2023, the  date  the  record closed.  (AX  D and  E)  There is  no  evidence
that he  made  any  payments.
SOR ¶  1.l: credit-card  account  charged off for $2,466. In Applicant’s answer to
the SOR, he stated that he would  set up an automatic payment of $50 per month. He
provided  no  evidence  of  payments.  At  the  hearing,  he  testified  that  he  contacted  the
creditor several months before the hearing about setting up automatic payments, but he
did not take any further action. (Tr. 85-87)
SOR  ¶   1.m:   home-security   system.   In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he
provided  documentation  that  he  had  agreed  to  make  $100  payments  each  month
beginning in November 2022. At the hearing, he testified that he thought this debt had
been paid in full. (Tr. 67-68) He provided no documentation of any payments.
SOR  ¶¶   1.j   and   1.p:   medical  debts.  These  debts  were  incurred  in  2015  when
Applicant  had  major  leg  surgery.  He  had  health  insurance,  but  it  did  not  cover  all  his
expenses. He was making payments but fell behind when he lost his job for a short time,
and he did not receive his full medical benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs.
(GX 2 at 7; Tr. 91-92) He testified that he believes the debts are legitimate, but that he
has not had time to contact the creditors and arrange for payments. (Tr. 93-94)
SOR ¶  1.n: overdrawn checking account. Applicant told the security investigator
that the debt was an overdrawn joint bank account with his spouse and mother-in-law.
(GX 6 at 4). He told the investigator that he thought this debt was resolved when he and
his spouse separated. He also told the investigator that he had disputed this debt, but he
did not know its current status. (GX 2 at 8, 13) The debt is not resolved.
SOR  ¶   1.o:  payments   for  a   gaming  system,   placed  for  collection  of   $285.
Applicant told the security investigator that he purchased this system in December 2018,
made  a  few  payments,  and  then  stopped.  (GX  2  at  5)  In  February  2022,  a  collection
agency notified Applicant that it had a judgment against him but that it would not proceed
further if he agreed to monthly payments of $283 per month. (GX 3 at 7) In his answer to
the SOR, he attached documentation that the debt was paid in full on November 25, 2022.
SOR ¶  1.q: credit-card account. Applicant testified that he thought this debt was
paid.  He  testified  that  he  contacted  the  creditor,  but  resolution  of  the  debt  “fell  by  the
wayside”  because  he  was  busy  with  work.  (Tr.  90)  After  the  hearing,  he  submitted
evidence of a payment plan for this debt, providing for monthly $34 payments beginning
in September 2023, and reflecting that the first payment had been made. (AX F)
During  Applicant’s  first  security  interview  in February  2023,  he  reported that  his
monthly  income  was  $4,277;  his  monthly  household  expenses  were  $3,250;  and  his
monthly debt payments were $692, leaving a net remainder of $335. (GX 2 at 10)
