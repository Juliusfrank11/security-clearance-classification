In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  she  admitted  the  12  SOR debts (¶¶  1.a  through
1.l)  and  provided  a  narrative  statement.  Her admissions are included  in   the  findings  of
fact.   After  a   thorough   and   careful  review  of  the   pleadings  and   exhibits,   I  make   the
following  additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 35 years old. She and her husband married in 2017. She has a young
daughter  with  her  husband  and  a  teenage  stepson.  She  has  worked  for  a  marketing
company since 2019. She has not held a prior clearance. (Item 3)
Applicant did not disclose any delinquent debts on her SCA but discussed them in
her  March  2022  background  interview.  She  was  given  an  opportunity  after  her
background interview to provide proof that some of her debts were resolved but she did
not do so. (Items 3, 4)
The SOR debts, mostly consumer credit accounts,  are detailed in credit reports
from March 2022 and October 2022. (Items 5, 6) As alleged, the SOR debts total about
$34,000. Applicant admitted all the SOR debts in her Answer. (Items 1, 2)
Applicant explains that she incurred her debts for a variety of reasons, including
job and salary changes, family changes, and health issues beginning in about 2015. She
does  not  elaborate.  She  asserts  that  she  has  enrolled  all  her  debts  in  a  debt-relief
program. Some of them, she states, were current when they were enrolled in the program
but were added to allow her family to better live within their means and reduce monthly
payments. She  asserts that her “finances have  been more in  control” as the  debt-relief
program  has  allowed  her  to  “focus  on  more  correct  spending  habits.”  (Item  2)  She
provides no details and no documents, particularly to show that any of the SOR debts
have been or are being paid or resolved.
SOR ¶  1.a  ($1,232  total balance,  $267  past-due) is a  past-due  consumer credit
account with  a bank. (Item  5)
SOR ¶ 1.b ($642) is an account placed for collection by a bank. (Items 5, 6)
SOR ¶ 1.c ($11,940) is an account that has been charged off by a bank. (Items 5,
6).
SOR ¶ 1.d ($175) is a past-due account. (Item 5)
SOR ¶ 1.e ($655 total  balance, $127 past due) is a past-due account with a bank.
(Item 5)
SOR ¶  1.f  ($4,070) is an account that has been charged off by a bank. Applicant
now owes $3,928. (Items 5, 6)

(Item 5)
SOR  ¶¶   1.j  ($280)  and   1.k   ($193)  are  past-due  medical  accounts  reported  for
collection. (Item 6)
SOR ¶  1.l ($15,871) is a timeshare account with a hotel, an account that has been
charged off. (Item 4 at 5, Item 6)
As noted, Applicant provided no documentation with her SOR response about her
efforts to pay or resolve any of these accounts, nor did she address such efforts in her
answer. She noted that she is in a debt relief program, but provided no information about
its  terms,  requirements,  or  expected  results.  She  provided  no  information  about  her
current assets, income stream, or expenses. She did not respond to the FORM, so she
provided no updated information about her financial stability.
