Applicant admitted all of the allegations in SOR. I have incorporated his admissions
into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony,
and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 38 years old. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2014. He married in
2014 and has two children, ages seven and four. He has worked for his present employer,
a federal contractor, since 2018. (Tr. 17-19, 32)
Applicant  was  self-employed  from  2007  to  2014  while  attending  college.  He
worked at various jobs that dealt with the sale of real estate,  such as a notary support
specialist, a processor, and a mortgage counselor. In July 2014, he decided to become a
real estate investor and would purchase property and resell it at a profit. He learned this
was a very competitive career, and he was unable to maintain a stable income. He began
falling  behind on his financial obligations  and  used  credit  to  help pay his bills.  In  June
2016,  he  decided  to  become  a  real  estate  agent  to  obtain  financial  stability.  He  was
licensed in three jurisdictions. He continued to fall behind in his financial obligations. He
worked part-time jobs to pay his bills. He was unable to live off the income he was earning.
Applicant  testified  that  while  experiencing  financial  hardship,  he  reached  out  to  his
creditors to resolve his debts, but he was unable to make the payments they proposed.
(Tr. 22-31; GE 2; Answer to SOR)
In 2017, Applicant decided to change careers and go into information technology
(IT). He worked part-time at a small media company, Apple, and Instacart. He was able
to  continue  to  work  part-time  after  becoming  a  full-time  employee  with  his  present
employer in 2018 but in 2019 he was no longer able to maintain his part-time jobs due to
the demands of his full-time work schedule. (Tr. 18-30)
Applicant testified that his wife worked temporary jobs for a period but did not work
for  periods  when  she  was  pregnant  and  after  their  children  were  born.  She  presently
works for a company as a temporary employee and anticipates being hired in a permanent
position, which would increase her income. (Tr. 18-21, 28-29)
During  Applicant’s  background  investigation  with  a  government  investigator  in
January 2022, he stated that in May 2019 he hired a credit repair company and some of
his debts were removed, and Applicant did not have any further obligation toward them.
He also said some were charged-off and he had no further obligation to the creditor. He
testified that he also received some financial counseling from the credit repair company.
(Tr. 55-57; GE 2)
Applicant explained that he and his wife reduced their spending and moved so they
would pay less for rent but are still living paycheck to paycheck. His goal is to complete
certifications in his field that will allow him to advance in his career and potentially increase
his  income.  He  hopes  that  once  his  income  increases,  he  will  be  able  to  address  his
delinquent  debts.  He  acknowledges  that  he  is  responsible  for  the  debts  and  wants  to
repay them. He said he would need to double his current income to resolve his delinquent
debts. (Tr. 27-31, 41-49
Applicant testified that he continues to struggle financially and often at the end of
the month he does not have sufficient income to pay all of his bills. He and his wife share
a vehicle. His mother-in-law provides day care for the children. They have no savings.
(Tr. 30-31)
The  SOR  alleges  six  delinquent  debts.  During  Applicant’s  interview  with  a
government investigator in January 2022, he explained the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a ($17,723)
and 1.d ($5,590) are lines of credit with the same creditor. He was unable to negotiate a
settlement  with  the  creditor.  The  debts  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.b  ($9,870),  1.c  ($5,603)  and  1.e
($9,371)  are  credit-card  accounts.  Applicant  testified  that  the  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.f  is  a
charged-off student loan ($25,000). He told the investigator he believed that he was no
longer responsible for it as it had been removed from his credit report and charged-off. At
his  hearing,  he  acknowledged  it  was  likely  held  by  a  third-party  collector.  Applicant
testified that none of these SOR delinquent debts are resolved or paid. He said he intends
to repay them when he is able. (Tr. 41, 45, 51; GE 2)
Applicant’s  current  annual  income  was  approximately  $60,000  in  2018  and  has
incrementally increased to approximately $72,000 for this year. He earns about $3,000 to
$5,000 from part-time jobs. His wife began working full-time three months ago and earns
about  $30,000  annually.  They  have  no  investments,  except  his  pension  to  which  he
contributes.  They  live  within  their  means  and  have  no  new  debts.  Applicant  owes
approximately $87,000 for student loans that are deferred. His wife owes approximately
$30,000  for  student  loans  that  are  deferred.  They  have  applied  for  income-based
repayment plans. (Tr. 18-21, 34-40, 49-55)
