The SOR alleges foreign influence security concerns based on Applicant’s family
members and friends in Iraq. In her Answer, Applicant admitted all of the allegations. After
a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings
of fact:
Applicant  is  42  years old.  She  was  born  in Baghdad,  Iraq.  In  March  2003,  U.S.
forces  invaded  Iraq  vowing  to  destroy  Iraqi weapons  of  mass  destruction  and  end  the
dictatorial rule of Saddam Hussein. Applicant and her husband were Iraqi citizens, and
they had a young son and two daughters. In early 2006, Applicant’s husband worked for
the  United  States  forces  in  Iraq  as  a  local  hire  Arabic  linguist.  After  working  for  a  few
months,  he  was  killed  by  an  improvised  explosive  device  while  he  was  performing his
duties  as  a  translator.  At  that  time,  Applicant  was  23  years-old  and  had  three  young
children.  In  2008,  she  applied  for  refugee  status  in  the  United  States.  In  2010,  she
received approximately $442,000 of life insurance money from the U.S. Army following
the death of her husband. She placed the insurance proceeds into an Iraqi bank account.
She  arrived  in  the  U.S.  in  September  2012  with  her  children,  and  she  became  a
naturalized U.S. citizen in December 2017. Her son and two daughters, now ages 22, 18
and 17 respectively, reside with Applicant in her home. They are U.S. citizens. (GE 1-3;
Tr. 17-18, 24, 27-30, 41-45, 51)
In 2021, Applicant applied to work for a government contractor as a linguist. She
was  offered  a  job,  but  her  employment  is  contingent  on  her  obtaining  a  DOD  security
clearance. She decided to apply for this position because her children are older and can
take care of themselves. She does not consider herself to be a dual citizen and claims
allegiance to the United States only.  She currently works for a company in Iraq that is
similar to Amazon. Her friend owns the company, and she is paid $3,400 per month as
an employee. Applicant ships items from the U.S. to  the  company’s customers in Iraq.
The owner, originally from Iraq, is a U.S. citizen living in the U.S. (GE 1 and 2; Tr. 59-61)
From September 2012 to September 2020, (actually late 2019), Applicant received
approximately $3,000 to $4,000 monthly from her father in Baghdad, Iraq. (SOR ¶ 1.g)
The money was sent to her via Western Union. The monthly payments were from the life
insurance  payout  of  $442,000  she  received  in  2010  and  deposited  into  an  Iraqi  bank
account. In 2018 Applicant's sister provided her with $20,000; and in 2019, Applicant’s
friend sent her $23,000, and another friend sent her $4,000. Applicant had just purchased
a home in 2018 and opened a small convenience store in 2019. (SOR ¶¶ 1.h - 1.j) All of
the money sent to Applicant was money provided to her as an insurance settlement for
her husband’s death. Applicant’s father was retired and restricted in the amount of money
he  could  send  to  Applicant  without  causing  problems.  Her  son  testified  that  others
stepped  in,  like  her  sister  and  Applicant’s  friends,  to  help  with  the  wire  transfers  so
Applicant could purchase the home and the business, which later failed. The remainder
of the insurance proceeds were used up in late 2019. (Tr. 27-33, 44-48, 59)
Applicant’s father is a citizen and resident of Iraq. (SOR ¶ 1.a) She communicates
with him on a weekly basis. He is a retired supervisor of a chemical plant. She disclosed
her father on her August 2021 SCA. During her September 2021 background interview,
Applicant was asked by an investigator if other than her father, did she have any other
family  members or  foreign  contacts  to  report.  Applicant initially  stated  she  did  not,  but
then  she  mentioned  her sister,  who  is also  a  citizen  and  resident  of  Iraq.  (SOR  ¶  1.c)
Applicant has contact with her sister on a weekly basis. Her sister is unemployed, and
Applicant  was  unsure  of  her  sister’s  spouse’s  occupation.  Applicant  reported  another
sister living in Sweden, but she had not had contact with this sister in the last 15 years.
Applicant  also  has  a  brother  living  in  Sweden,  unemployed,  and  in  the  process  of
obtaining his Swedish citizenship. (SOR ¶ 1.b) She communicates with him about every
three months. (GE 1-3; Tr. 23-24, 48)
Applicant  also  disclosed  to  the  investigator  that  she  has  a  stepsister  who  is  a
citizen and resident of Iraq. The stepsister lives with her father and attends high school.
Her stepmother is a citizen and resident of Iraq, also living with her father. (SOR ¶ 1.d)
She works in elder care, and Applicant does not have much contact with her unless she
is staying at her father’s home during her trips to Iraq. Applicant has two brothers who are
citizens and residents of Iraq. (SOR ¶ 1.c) She has a brother who is employed by the Iraqi
Army, but she does not know if he is an officer or if he works in a civilian position. (SOR
¶ 1.e) She does not communicate often with this brother. Another brother is a police officer
in Iraq, and they communicate with each other on a sporadic basis, monthly to quarterly.
(SOR ¶ 1.f) Both brothers have served their mandatory conscript miliary service in Iraq.
(GE 1-3; Tr. 24-25, 50-52)
On Applicant’s deceased husband’s side  of the family, his mother, two brothers
and two sisters are citizens and residents of Iraq. The two brothers are appliance repair
electricians, one sister is a nurse, and the other  sister is an accountant. Applicant has
approximately 16 nieces and nephews. Applicant has limited contact with her nieces and
nephews. (Tr. 19-23, 52)
Applicant traveled to Iraq to visit family in July 2018, December 2018, April 2019,
January 2020, November 2020, May 2021, December 2021, June 2022, and August of
2022. She testified that since August 2022, she has travelled to Iraq on  approximately
four  other  occasions.  Since  the  insurance  money  was  depleted  in  about  late  2019,
Applicant’s  son  and  her  current  employer  have  paid  for  her  trips  to  Iraq.  Post-hearing
submission  of  her  U.S.  passport  and  a  review  of  the  travel  stamps  therein  support
Applicant’s  testimony that she has travelled to Iraq  on multiple occasions since August
2022. (Tr. 26, 50-52, 59; AE A)
Administrative Notice
I have taken administrative notice of the following facts concerning Iraq:
The  Federal Republic of Iraq  (Iraq) is a  constitutional parliamentary republic. The
U.S. Department of State  warns  U.S. citizens not to  travel to  Iraq  due  to  terrorism  and
armed  conflict. U.S. citizens in  Iraq  are at high  risk for violence  and  kidnapping.  Numerous
terrorist and  insurgent  groups are active  in Iraq  and  regularly attack both  Iraqi security
forces  and   civilians.   The   Islamic  State   in   Iraq   and   Syria   (ISIS),  a   designated   terrorist
organization,   remains  a   threat   to  public   safety  in Iraq.   Additionally, criminal gangs and
local militia pose  a  potential threat to  U.S. citizens. In  February 2022, the  U.S. Director of
National Intelligence  (DNI) concluded  that,  given  the  ongoing  presence  of  ISIS  and  Iraqi
Shia  militias, Iraq will likely face a lengthy period of political turmoil and conflict. (AN I)
Iraq’s  most  significant  human  rights  abuses  are  largely  fueled  by  the  terrorist
activities of ISIS; however, some Iraqi security forces were alleged to have engaged in
unlawful  killings,  disappearances  and  extortion,  torture,  life-threatening  conditions  in
detention and prison facilities, and arbitrary arrest and detention. (AN I)
The United States’ commitment to Iraq is balanced against the inherent dangers
of the ongoing conflict in Iraq to its citizens and residents from terrorists and significant
human rights issues. (AN 1)
