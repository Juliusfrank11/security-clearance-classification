Applicant denied all of the allegations with explanations. After a careful review of
the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 40 years old. He has worked for a federal contractor since December
2019,  as  an  engineer.  From  February  2019  to  July  2019,  he  was  unemployed.  From
2016  to  February  2019,  he  worked  for  a  different  federal  contractor.  He  holds  two
bachelor’s degrees in engineering. As of the hearing date, he was single, never married,
with no children. (Tr. 5, 23-24, 34; GE 1)
The SOR alleged Applicant failed to timely file his 2015 to 2021 federal and his
2015-2016 and 2018-2021 state income tax returns, as required. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.b)
Applicant’s understanding of his federal and state income tax requirements were
that  if  he  had  a  “credit”  (meaning  he  was  due  a  refund  from  his  previous  year’s  tax
withholdings overpayment), he was not required to file a tax return. He also claimed he
filed extensions with the IRS to file his returns six months after the normal filing deadline
(typically  April 15,  with  the  exception  of  the  COVID  years  of  2020  and  2021).  He  also
claims  he  was  unable  to  file  his  2016  federal  return  because,  “my  2016  federal  taxes
were actually flagged for potential  identity theft.”  He did not support this assertion with
documentation. He also claimed that assistance from the IRS during 2020 was difficult
because  of  the  pandemic.  He  further  stated  that  he  always  planned  to  file  his  tax
returns, but his life just got busy and he did not get around to doing it in a more timely
fashion. He documented that he does not owe the IRS or his state for any tax debt. (Tr.
35-39, 41-43, 49-50; SOR Answer; GE 2 (p. 6-bottom center pagination); AE B, E)
Applicant was aware as early as 2019, when he completed his security clearance
application (SCA), that there was a problem with his 2016 taxes. During his background
interview in January 2020, he committed to filing his 2016 federal return “within the next
month.”  He did not file that return until December  2021. He attributed this delay  to the
IRS  being  unresponsive  during  the  pandemic.  He  admitted  that  he  has  not  sought
professional  tax  assistance  since  approximately  2015.  He  did  not  consult  with  a  tax
attorney or CPA about his tax return filings. (Tr. 43, 57; GE 1 (p. 45); GE 2 (p. 10).
Applicant’s  federal  and  state  tax  transcripts  for  tax  years  2015-2021,  show  the

Applicant also admitted that he had not filed his 2021 federal return in his June 20, 2023
email to me (AE A). He filed his 2021 state return after his hearing.  (AE 2 (pp. 15-35);
AE A-B, D)
Applicant produced two character letters from a former coworker and a friend of
26 years. The coworker opined that Applicant is a professional and trustworthy person.
He  believes  Applicant  is  “respectful  of  privacy,  classified  information,  rules  and
restrictions.”  His  friend,  who  is  an  employee  of  defense  contractor,  also  vouches  for
Applicant’s trustworthiness. Neither indicated that they were aware of his tax return filing
issues. (AE C)
