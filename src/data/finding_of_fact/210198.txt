Applicant is  26  years old and  is married. She  earned a  high  school diploma  in
May 2015. She served in the Army National Guard (ANG) in State 1 from October 2014
to  October  2020  and  was  honorably  discharged  as  a  Uniform  Signal  Support  System
Specialist  (E-3).  In  November  2014  she  submitted  an  e-QIP  (2014  e-QIP)  (GE  2)  in
connection with her enlistment  in the ANG and was granted a security clearance. She
has worked for a DoD contractor since September 2019.  She subsequently submitted a
second security clearance application, the October 2021 e-QIP. She is seeking to retain
national security eligibility in connection with her employment. (Tr. at 13, 15, 17; GE 1 at
7, 11, 12-14, 19-20, 32-33.)
Paragraph 1: Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance  Misuse
The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  she  has  tested  positive  for  THC  in  July  2020.  (SOR  ¶  1.a).  In  her  Answer
Applicant denied this allegation and provided an explanation of the circumstances of the
drug test.
I make the following findings of fact with respect SOR allegation ¶ 1.a:
Applicant was drug tested on July 27, 2020, in connection with her ANG service.
The  test  results  were  reported  by  the  lab  on  August  5,  2020,  as  positive  for  THC,  or
marijuana. On August 18, 2020, a flag was initiated by the Deputy Chief of Staff G-1 of
State  1’s  ANG.  The  reason  provided  in  the  Report  to  Suspend  Favorable  Personnel
Actions (Flag), DA Form 286 (August 2020 DA 286 or GE 5) was “Drug Abuse Adverse
Action.” GE 5 reflects that Applicant was on the distribution list. A memorandum from the
Headquarters  of  the  State  1  ANG,  dated  October  29,  2020,  (the  October  2020
Memorandum  or GE  7)  states  that Applicant enrolled  in  the  State  1  ANG’s  Substance
Abuse Program (SAP) on August 27, 2020, after testing positive for “an illegal substance”
on July 27, 2020. The memorandum further reflects that she “successfully attended and
participated  in  the  required  inpatient  program.”  A  May  8,  2023  memorandum  from  the
State 1 ANG Joint Force Headquarters recites the details of Applicant’s positive drug test,
including  her  being.  “Flagged  for  drug  abuse.”  and  her  successful  completion  of  the
substance abuse inpatient program, as set forth in GE 7. Applicant’s positive test result
for THC is substantial evidence of her use of marijuana prior to the test. (GE 4 through
GE 8.)
On August 18, 2022, Applicant was interviewed by a U.S. Government investigator
in  connection  with  her  2021  security  clearance  application  (GE  1).  The  investigator
prepared  a  summary  of  Applicant’s  statements  during  the  interview  in  a  report  (ROI).
the  accuracy  of  the  report  in  her  responses  to  DOHA’s
Applicant  confirmed
interrogatories. The ROI recites that Applicant denied in her interview that she had used
marijuana prior to testing positive for THC in July 2020. She claimed that she was first
advised about three months by her commander after the drug test that she tested positive
and had to retest the next day. Applicant declined to retest because she said she had a
family emergency and was unavailable the next day. She further asserted in the interview
that this conversation about three weeks prior to her separation from the ANG, which was
in October 2020. (GE 3 at 4.)
Applicant’s
interview  statements  are
the  Government’s
documentary evidence described above that she was advised in August 2020 that she
was  flagged  for  drug  abuse  and  that  she  was  required  to  participate  in  an  inpatient
substance  abuse  treatment  program  beginning  on  August  27,  2020,  which  she
subsequently completed.
inconsistent  with
At the  hearing, Applicant testified  that she  first  learned  about the  positive  drug  test
when   her sergeant  advised   her  of  the  test  results   just   prior to   her   separation   from   the
ANG. She  denied that she had  used marijuana  prior to  her drug  test  or at any  other time
since  2010. She  testified  that her  sergeant told her to  speak with  their  unit commander
on  October 18,  2020,  for further instructions. She  advised  the  commander that the  test
results were  inaccurate  due  to  a  label mix up. She  explained  to  the  commander that new
labels  had   to   be   printed   during   the   testing   process  and   that   a   mix  up   produced   an
erroneous  positive test  result for Applicant.  She  also  claimed  at the  hearing  that neither
she nor anyone  else taking a drug test at that time  were  asked  to re-sign the new labels.
Applicant made the additional assertions  that the October 2020  Memorandum contained
inaccurate  information  in that she  never participated  in  the  ANG’s SAP. (Tr. at 13-14, 24-
26, 29-30.)
Applicant  further  testified  that  her  commander  told  her  that  she  could  file  a
complaint with the Inspector General (IG) and that she would receive paper copies of all
of the relevant documentation. She said she filed a complaint electronically with the IG in
2020 about both the mistake in the drug test results and the inaccurate information in the
October Memorandum. She did not produce a copy of her IG complaint at the hearing.
She claimed that she followed up on her complaint several times, but she  never heard
further and did not receive paper copies of anything related to the drug test.  Applicant
also testified that prior to receiving the Government’s evidence from Department Counsel
in March 2023, she had never seen GE 6, the August 2020 DA 286. (Tr. at 14-15, 22, 25-
27.)
Paragraph 2: Guideline E, Personal Conduct
The SOR sets forth three allegations under the Personal Conduct guideline. The
Government alleged that Applicant has engaged in dishonest and unreliable conduct by
falsifying responses to questions in her 2021 e-QIP and her 2014 e-QIP regarding her
past use of illegal drugs. (SOR ¶¶ 2.a and 2.b.) The SOR also cross-alleged the allegation
set forth in ¶ 1.a under Guideline H. (SOR ¶ 2.c.)
I make the following findings of fact with respect SOR allegation  ¶¶ 2.a through
2.c:
Department Counsel submitted the 2021 e-QIP (GE 1) and an excerpt for the 2014
e-QIP (GE 2). In the 2021 e-QIP, Applicant responded in the negative to the question in
Section 23 of that application about her drug use in the past seven years. The excerpt
from  Applicant’s  2014  e-QIP  are  the  pages  of  that  application  in  which  Section  23
appears. The SOR points to Applicant’s failed drug test in July 2020 as evidence that she
had used marijuana prior to the drug test and that her response to the seven-year drug
question  in  Section  23  of  the  2021  e-QIP  was  a  deliberate  falsification.  In  view  of  my
finding  above  that  her  positive  drug  test  was  substantial  evidence  of  Applicant  having
used marijuana prior to the test, I conclude that the Government has met its burden to
establish its allegation that Applicant deliberately falsified her answers in Section 23 of
the 2019 e-QIP. (GE 1 at 31-32.)
As stated, Department Counsel also submitted an excerpt of Applicant’s 2014 e-
QIP  with  her  responses  to  Section  23  regarding  drug  use  in  the  past  seven  years.
Applicant  answered  these  questions  in  the  negative.  During  her  2022  background
interview,  she  disclosed  that  she  had  use  marijuana  once  in  2010  when  she  was  a
freshman in high school. She also wrote in the Answer that she had smoked marijuana in
August 2010, which was the same high school incident. She blamed the non-disclosure
of that drug use in the 2014 e-QIP on her recruiter, who she claimed filled out the form
for her. She asserted in her Answer and at the hearing that she had advised the recruiter
about her one-time prior use of marijuana, and he failed to note her response in the 2014
e-QIP. (Answer; Tr. at 18; GE 2 at 20-21; GE 3 at 5.)
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  explained  the  non-disclosure  of  her drug use  in  2010.
She testified that she advised her recruiter of her drug use in high school, and he told her
not to mention it or she would not be allowed to enlist. She reported that the recruiter told
her everything would be “fine” if she passed the drug test when she enlisted. She claimed
that the recruiter prepared her 2014 e-QIP. She did admit that she signed the 2014 e-QIP
under penalty of perjury for any deliberately false statements. (Tr. at 18-20.)
