In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted SOR ¶ 1.a and denied the remaining
allegations, SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.h, with explanations. His admissions are incorporated in my
findings of fact.
Applicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He served honorably
in  the  U.S.  Army  for  13  years.  After  leaving  active  duty  he  continued  to  work  as  a
communications  contractor  with  U.S.  military  forces  overseas  in  various  locations.  He
took  evident  pride  in  supporting  the  “war  fighter”  in  austere  locations.  (Tr.  at  28.)  He
owned  his  U.S.  residence  from  2011  until  2018,  when  he  lost  the  property  due  to
foreclosure. (GE 2 at 13.) He worked as a contractor in two areas of operation (AO) (AO
-A  and  AO-B)  where  he  was  entitled  to  “hazardous  and  dangerous  pay.”  In  AO-A  he
resided in country from 2009 to 2014. He resided in AO-B 2014 to 2016. (GE 1 at 9-12.)
He stated he had a 70% decrease in his pay because of the differences in “hazardous
and dangerous pay” when he moved from AO-A to AO-B. (Tr. at 33.) From 2016 to 2018
he  resided  in  AO-C.  When  he  was  interviewed  in  November  2019  for  his  security
clearance, he had been working and residing in a European country since January 2017.
He was required to file tax returns for the European country. (GE 1; GE 2 at 13; GE 7.)
He had been updating the IRS regarding his presence in a combat zone since 2015. The
IRS responses to his emails provided details on when he would be required to file his tax
returns. (GE 6.) His January 10, 2019 email informed the IRS he was “still deployed in a
combat zone.” (GE 6 at 5.) The IRS response to his email indicated the IRS was “unable
to update [his] account to show the Combat Zone Extension.” (GE 6 at 6.)
Applicant offered Exhibit U in his post-hearing submissions indicating his intention
enroll  in  a  debt  management  program  (DMP)  in  May  2016.  He  listed  over  $56,000  of
unsecured consumer debt in the DMP. The agreement estimated it would take 60 months
to  liquidate  the  debt  and  there  would  be  an  additional  interest  of  over  $14,000.  He
provided no documentation of any transaction history of payments into the DMP, and he
indicated he dealt with the debts himself. (Tr. at 75-76.)
Applicant recently returned to the United States. He purchased a 2020 luxury car
and has a $900 monthly car payment. He currently resides with his mother and pays her
$1,500 in monthly rent. His current monthly pay is $7,400 and it is supplemented by a
$2,500 monthly disability payment. (Tr. at 79.)
SOR ¶  1.a: Applicant  failed to  file,  as  required, Federal income  tax  returns  for
tax  years  2014  through  at least 2019  and has  an outstanding Federal tax  liability  of
approximately   $102,000.  Applicant  admits  this  concern.  In  August  of  2019,  the  IRS
contacted him because of his failure to file tax returns. He acknowledged his failure to file
his tax returns in his security clearance interview and told the investigator he thought he
was tax exempt because he was overseas. He told the investigator in the November 2019
security clearance interview he was in process of filing his Federal tax returns and that
he would “file his taxes in the future.” (GE 2 at 15.) He testified “I was in the impression
that I had six months to become compliant once I reached back to the United States for
everything.” He acknowledged in his testimony he had arrived in the European country in
2018. He continued to claim the combat zone status as of January 2019. (Tr. at 69; GE 6
at 6.) He testified he hired an attorney in October or November of 2022, who was qualified
to handle the complex tax issues he was facing due to taxes being withheld by a European
country. (Tr. at 43; AE J.) He stated he was working with an accountant and an attorney
to resolve his tax issues. (GE 2 at 10; Tr. at 42; AE J.) He indicated he had signed some
forms but was not sure if he had filed tax returns for the relevant years. (Tr. at 64.)
A May 2023 letter to DOHA from Applicant’s tax preparer stated: “[a]s of the date
of this letter the un-filed returns for [Applicant] have been prepared to bring the account
into  tax  filing  compliance.  The  request  has  been  sent  to  IRS  for  a  resolution  of  the
outstanding  balances,  we  are  awaiting  the  determination  of  the  assigned  Revenue
Officer.” (AE J.) In his post-hearing submission, Applicant offered AE V, consisting of the
second page of an IRS Form 1040 that listed the tax year in parentheses for tax years
2016 (refund $14,432), 2017 (owed $28,836), and 2019 (owed $1,661). The 2018 IRS
1040  Form  appeared  to  be  a  single  page.  It  shows  that  he  owed  $15,734.  All  of  the
documents were signed on May 15, 2023. He also offered the IRS Form 8879 (e-file) for
tax  years  2020  and  2021  along  with  the  second  page  of  the  IRS  Form  1040.  These
documents were also dated May 15, 2023.
Applicant testified he had made almost $65,000 in payments last year to the IRS.
(Tr. at 42.) He documented four processed payments in January 2022 for: $4,989 (Tax
Year 2005), $10,000 (Tax Year 2014), $10,000 (Tax Year 2016), and $5,000 (Tax Year
2017) as well as a pending payment made in February 2022 of $9,611 (Tax Year 2002).
(AE F and AE J.) He stated tax years 2020, 2021, and 2022 had not been filed but were
in progress because of the concern about taxes being withheld by a foreign country. (Tr.
at 65-66.) In explaining his delayed action, he also cited the complexity of his situation
caused by also being fully taxed by the European country where he had been living and
working. (Tr. at 63, 64, 65-66; AE O; AE P.)
SOR ¶  1.c: Applicant  is  indebted to  his  employer in the  approximate amount
of   $3,750.48,  for  an  overseas   income   tax   debt,  which  the   employer  paid  for
Applicant. The  employer has  requested Applicant’s  wages  be  garnished  to  satisfy
the  debt. Applicant denies the allegation. In his Answer he states the debt was unrelated
to  overseas  income  tax.  It  was  instead  a  debt  related  to  a  homeowners’  association
(HOA). He was unaware of the issue with his HOA until the garnishment action, and after
he investigated the matter he said, “okay, go ahead and give it to them.” (Tr. at 45; GE 5;
AE D.) He believes the problem arose because the automatic payments to the HOA from
his  credit  card  had  stopped.  The  debt  was  “garnished  from  his  paycheck  with  the
agreement  of  [Applicant].”  The  debt  was  resolved  with  one  direct payment  (Tr.  at  45.)
Applicant provided the email traffic with his employer to support his Answer. (AE D; Tr. at
45-46.)
SOR ¶  1.d:  Applicant  is  indebted to  a  bank  for loan that  has  been charged off
in  the   approximate  amount   of   $41,330.   As  of   the   date   of   the   SOR   the   account
remains  delinquent. Applicant denied the debt and states in his Answer it was a disputed
debt that had been removed from his credit report. (AE C.) He had obtained a personal
loan to put an extension on the back of his house. (Tr. at 47.) When he switched countries,
he testified he took a pay cut, which triggered financial hardships for him (Tr. 48, 49.) He
stated “once you get into a hole, it's hard to get out of a hole. It's a balancing act. And I
was trying to balance everything, and I was in over my head.” (Tr. at 48.) He contacted
the  bank  recently  and  determined  the  account  was  inactive  and  closed.  Because  the
account was closed, he explained the bank did not “have a mechanism for [him] to repay
it.” (Tr. at 49.) He acknowledged that his reason for denying the debt was because it was
so old that it should not be on his credit report. (Tr. at 70-71; GE 3 at 6; GE 4 at 2; AE E.)
SOR ¶  1.e: Applicant  is  indebted to  a  bank  for a  credit card account  that has
been charged off in the  approximate amount  of  $11,488. As  of  the  date of  the  SOR

was paid off in 2021 or 2022 and that it was removed from his credit report. (Tr. at 71; GE
3 at 5; AE B.) He testified that he had documentation stating that the debt had been paid
and that he verified that fact the day before the hearing by phone. He stated the bank
would  send  him  correspondence  to  that  fact  because  they  could  not  provide  it  to  him
electronically. (Tr. at 49.) He blamed the delinquency on a reduction in hazardous and
dangerous pay when he moved countries. (Tr. at 50-51.) Applicant provided a February
transaction document dated February 28, 2022, showing a $7,000 payment to an attorney
and a letter dated June 15, 2023, and faxed to him the same day stating: “Now that you've
completed your payments, we'll report the account to the consumer reporting agencies
as settled for less than the full balance. As a reminder, your card is closed and can't be
used for new charges.” (AE S.)
SOR  ¶   1.f:   Applicant   is   indebted   for  a   credit  card  account   that  has   been
charged off in  the   approximate  amount  of   $4,203.  As  of   the   date  of   the   SOR  the

it on the basis the debt had been removed from his credit report. (GE 3 at 6; GE 4 at 2;
AE  E.)  He  opened  the  account  in  2011  and  the  account  was  charged  off  in  2015.  He
affirmed that it was a legitimate debt and that he denied the debt because it was so old
that it should not be  on his credit report. (Tr. at 72.) He testified he had contacted the
creditor and had tried to work something out. (Tr. at 72.)
SOR  ¶   1.g:  Applicant  is   indebted   for   a   credit  card   account   that  has   been
placed for collection in the  approximate amount  of  $535. As of  the  date of  the  SOR
the  account  remains  delinquent. Applicant in his Answer denied the debt on the basis
he had paid it in full. He affirmed that he denied the debt because he had contacted the
creditor and had tried to work something out and that the dispute was because the debt
was so old it should not be on his credit report. (Tr. at 72; GE 3 at 5; GE 4 at 2.) When
asked, “Why didn't you just pay it off a long time ago?” Applicant responded, “I was just
trying to balance everything. It was a juggling act, and I just got in over my head. And I
ended up, they took a, it was mentally challenging, as well.” (Tr. at 52, 53.) He opened
the account in 2016 and the account was assigned to collection in 2018. (GE 3 at 5.) He
could  not  recall  if  he  had  resolved  the  debt  before  or  after  the  SOR  was  issued.  He
answered “certainly” to  the  question  if he  could obtain  documentation  that  he had paid
the  debt  in  full.  (Tr.  at  73.)  He  provided  AE T,  which  stated:  “This letter  confirms  your
arrangement made on 1/12/2022 to make the following payment(s) to pay this account in
full.” An accompanying transaction page from his bank shows a $535.01 payment. (AE
T)
SOR ¶  1.h: Applicant  is  indebted for a  store  account  that has  been charged
off  in  the   approximate   amount   of   $2,558.  As  of   the   date  of   the   SOR  the   account

basis the debt had been removed from his credit report. (GE 3 at 5; GE 4 at 3.) He stated
he had contacted the company a couple of years ago about making payments and was
told “it was a cancellation of debt, and they can't take any more payments.” (Tr. at 53.)
He acknowledged that dispute was not the fact that the debt was illegitimate or did not
belong to him but that it should not be on his credit report because it was so old. (Tr. at
74.) He opened the account in 2013 and used it to purchase household furnishings for
his family while he was overseas. The account was charged off in 2014. (Tr. at 73.) He
blamed the delinquency on a reduction in hazardous and dangerous pay when he moved
AOs. He stated he had contacted the creditor prior to the hearing to see if any payments
could be made. He offered that if the store or a third-party creditor requested payment,
he was prepared to make payment. (Tr. at 53.)
