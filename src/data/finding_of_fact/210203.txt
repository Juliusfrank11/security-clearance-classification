Applicant is a 32-year-old engineering technician employed by a DOD contractor
since January 2021. He earned an associate degree in January 2019. He has not been
married and has no children. (GE 1; AE A, G at 60; Tr. 29-30, 41, 59-62, 106, 110)
Applicant  served   in   the   United   States   Air   Force  from   March   2010   to   November
2020   and   was  discharged   under  other  than   honorable  conditions.   He   was   a   highly
qualified  airman  and  attained  the  rank of staff sergeant  (E-5). He  deployed  many  times
and  had  extensive  combat experience. He  was awarded  numerous medals,  awards  and
decorations including  the  Distinguished  Flying  Cross and  multiple  Air  Medals. He received
favorable   performance   evaluations,  and   successfully  completed   extensive  military
training and education. He  served honorably during his initial term  of service  from March
2010  to  July 2017. He  has held  a  security clearance  since  2010. (Answer; AE A, G at 35-
38, 63-80; Tr. 29-34, 40)
In October 2019, Applicant was charged with one sexual act and one attempted
sexual act upon a female airman, unlawful entry, and indecent exposure in violation of
Articles 80, 120, 120c, and 129 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). Those
charges were referred for trial by General Court-Martial in November 2019. On May 6,
2020,  he  entered  pleas  of  not  guilty  to  all  charges.  In  October  2020,  he  requested  a
“Discharge in Lieu of Trial by Court-Martial” pursuant to Air Force regulations. His request
was  approved in  November 2020,  and he was  discharged  under other than honorable
conditions. (Answer; AE G at 3-7, 10-17, 32-112; GE 1-3)
Sexual Behavior, Criminal Conduct, and Personal Conduct
The SOR alleges and cross-alleges sexual misconduct by Applicant (SOR ¶¶ 1.a,
1.b,  2.a,  and  3.a)  and  that  he  was  discharged  from  the  Air  Force  under  other  than
honorable conditions in lieu of trial by court-martial (SOR ¶¶ 2.b and 3.a). In his answer
to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  the  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  2.b  and  denied  all  other
allegations with explanation. His admission is incorporated herein as a finding of fact.
In April 2019, a complaining witness (CW1) told investigators that Applicant had
grabbed  her  waist  and  attempted  to  kiss  her  without  her  consent  in  about  June  2018.
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 2.a, 3.a) She stated the following. While socializing at a bar with members
of her new unit she met Applicant. When she went outside to smoke, Applicant followed
her.  He  asked  to  kiss  her,  and  she  replied,  “no,  we  work  together”  and  “no.”  He  then
“grabbed [her] around her waist and attempted to kiss her.” (AE H; GE 2 at 2) She put her
hands on his chest, pushed him away and he went back into the bar. She saw Applicant
around the squadron afterward but “[he] avoided her at all costs.” (AE H) She disclosed
this  incident  and  incidents  with  two  other  males  in  her  unit  to  her  supervisor  while
discussing reasons she wanted a transfer. (GE 2 at 2; AE H) After the hearing, Applicant
submitted a more detailed summary of CW1’s statement to  investigators reflecting  that
she  had  not  intended  to  report  the  incidents  with  Applicant  and  the  two  other  male
squadron  members,  and  only  wanted  to  better  inform  her  supervisor  why  she  thought
changing platforms was the right decision for her. (AE H)
Applicant  denied  that  he  groped  CW1,  grabbed  her  around  the  waist,  asked  or
attempted to kiss her, and did not recall any inappropriate physical contact or that CW1
pushed him. (Answer: AE G at 10-12; Tr. 35, 55-56) He said it was “possible” that they
hugged at the end of the evening in a show of friendship but did not  specifically recall
doing so. (Tr. 56) He confirmed that he first met CW1 on the evening in question. (Tr. 35,
48-49, 51, 111) He said that they were out with a group of friends but were “pretty much
just conversing amongst ourselves, talking, chatting, as well as like, the group was with
us but we were more chatting amongst ourselves.” (Tr. 35, 53) He did not recall how many
drinks he consumed that evening but said he had been socially drinking over a period of
several hours and probably drank several beers, and one or two cocktails. (Tr. 51-53) He
testified  that  when  CW1  went  outside  to  smoke  he  followed  her  because  “[he]  figured
we’d continue our conversation and also so she wouldn’t have to be standing out there
by herself.” (Tr. 54) He testified that they went back inside the bar together, rejoined their
colleagues, and went their separate ways at the end of the evening. (Tr. 35, 56-57) He
said that he and CW2 were in the same squadron for 10 months after the alleged incident
without tension between them, and that they  “had  different duties  in the  plane, but I’m
sure we flew together, deployed together and so on.” (Tr. 57) He did not recall any social
interaction with her after the June 2018 evening in the bar. (Tr. 62-63)
Applicant  challenged  the  veracity  of  CW1’s  allegations,  noting  that  she  waited
more than nine months to report the alleged incident and did so in support of her request
to  be  reassigned.  (AE  G  at  10-12;  Tr.  34-35,  55-56)  He  said  that  she  also  made
uncorroborated allegations that an airman texted her an unsolicited picture of his genitalia
and  that  another airman  inappropriately  touched  her  buttocks.  (AE  G  at  11,  101-103;  Tr.
128-129) He submitted  a  November 2021  letter from  Technical Sergeant  (TSgt) H, who
had  served  with  Applicant from  2015  to  2020  and  had  been  his roommate  from  late  2016
to  early 2020. TSgt H wrote  that  “I am  aware  of  the  allegations made  against  [Applicant]
and  I believe  them  to  be  false in nature. I believe  [Applicant]  fell  victim  to  someone  who
accused  multiple  other people  of similar allegations and  that [Applicant]  told the  whole
truth  during his testimonies.” (Answer at Ex. 9; AE  G at 91-92; Tr. 35) Applicant said that
he was not questioned by investigators about CW1’s allegations against him. (Tr. 58-63)
CW1’s  allegations   were  investigated   but  were  not   included   in   the   charges   preferred
against Applicant in October 2019  and  later referred  to  general court-martial. (AE  G  at
101-103; GE  2 at 1; Tr. 128-129)
In May 2019, investigators interviewed CW2, and she said that Applicant groped
and sexually assaulted her on March 1, 2019. (SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 2.a, 3.a) She provided the
following account to investigators. Applicant asked if he could stay at her residence after
a night out and she agreed. While in a taxi enroute to her residence she vomited. She fell
while exiting the vehicle at her residence, scraped her arm and dirtied her clothes. She
went to take a shower, and while removing her clothes, Applicant entered the bathroom
naked, grabbed her, and tried to pull her close. CW2 told him to stop, he then grabbed
her buttocks, pushed her close to a counter and tried to kiss her, while fondling and kissing
her breasts. She repeatedly told him to “stop” and “no” to which he replied, “[y]ou know
you want [to engage in sexual activity with me].” CW2’s roommate [Roommate] came out
of her room, encountered CW2 and Applicant, told him to leave and then escorted him
out of the residence. Applicant then repeatedly knocked on the door, rang the doorbell
and asked to come in to apologize. (GE 2 at 2)
Roommate’s statement to investigators is summarized as follows. In about March
2019 she saw an intoxicated CW2 leaning on a male later identified as Applicant at the
residence she shared with CW2. She then helped CW2 to the shower. CW2 told her that
“I don’t want [Applicant] here, we need to make him leave.” Roommate thanked Applicant
and asked him to leave, but he swiftly walked into the bathroom occupied by CW2 and
locked  the  door.  Roommate  heard  CW2  say,  “Hey  I’m  naked,  you  need  to  get  out.”
Seconds later the bathroom door opened, and Roommate saw CW2 attempting to cover
her naked body with a towel. Applicant ran out of the bathroom nude, covering his penis
with his hands, and then hid behind a Christmas tree. CW2 appeared sick and ran into
the  bathroom  to  vomit.  Applicant  swiftly  followed  her  and  locked  the  door.  Roommate
heard CW2 say, “I’m throwing up, don’t touch me. Go home.” Roommate then escorted
Applicant from the bathroom and outside the residence. CW2 later told Roommate that
“she never felt so close  [to] being raped,” and that Applicant had picked her up, placed
her on the counter, and attempted to perform oral sex on her. (GE 2 at 2)
Applicant  denied  any nonconsensual sexual behavior  with  CW2. He  specifically
denied groping CW2, grabbing her buttocks, fondling or kissing her breasts, attempting
to  perform  oral  sex  on  her,  telling  her  that  “[y]ou  know  you  want  [to  engage  in  sexual
activity with me].  He also testified that CW2’s statement to investigators was untruthful.
(Answer; Tr. 76-78, 83-84)
Applicant recounted the evening as follows. He and CW2 attended a colleague’s
promotion party and after several hours of drinking she asked him to stay the night at her
residence. (Answer; AE G at 105; Tr. 36, 66-68) He explained that he and CW2 had been
close friends since their deployment, that their relationship had been platonic prior to that
evening, and that he sometimes slept on her couch. (Tr. 36, 68-69) While in a taxi on the
way to CW2’s residence, the driver was concerned that CW2 might vomit, so the driver
stopped the vehicle and CW2 got out to vomit. Applicant did not recall seeing CW2 vomit
but because of concern for her safety, he exited the vehicle, helped her move away from
traffic, and watched for approaching vehicles. (Tr. 70-72, 117)
Applicant said that “[CW2] kind of stumbled [while exiting the taxi at her residence]
and I caught her . . . to prevent her from hitting her head or whatever . . .  I believe she
hit her knee or elbow or something like that, but nothing too severe.” (Tr. 72) He recounted
events at CW2’s residence as follows. She went to the bathroom alone after they entered
her residence. (Answer; AE G at 106; Tr. 73, 80) He met and spoke with Roommate for
several minutes and decided to go home. (Tr. 78-80, 117) When he went to say goodbye
to CW2, she opened the door naked and “invited [him] inside the bathroom [and] to join
her in  a  shower”. (Answer; AE G at 106; Tr. 37, 78-81, 83) They then mutually kissed,
and she helped him undress. (Answer; AE G at 106; Tr. 75-77, 80-81, 83) CW2 suggested
that  they  go  to  her bedroom  because  she  did  not  want  Roommate  to  hear  them  or to
judge her for engaging in sexual activity after her recent breakup. (Answer; AE G at 106;
Tr. 78-79) While naked and on their way to CW2’s bedroom they encountered Roommate,
who scolded them both about their behavior, so he and CW2 returned to the bathroom to
get their clothes. (Answer; AE G at 106; Tr. 36-40, 82-83) Roommate told him it was a
good idea to leave, and he agreed because CW2 “was sick and obviously drunk”. (Tr. 81-
82, 85, 120-121) He denied that Roommate told him to leave or forced him to leave. (Tr.
81-82)
After Applicant left  CW2’s residence, he  and CW2 exchanged the following text
messages.
Applicant:  Hey, your roommate said you wanted me out. I just wanted to
speak to you before tomorrow – I get that we were drunk and [stuff] but hope
you [contact me] tomorrow.
CW2: I was in the shower! Did you [taxi] home ok?
Applicant:  Yea – Sorry for being so forward – I was in the wrong and should
of recognized it – Hope if there’s any hard feelings we can chat tomorrow
or just brush it off as a drunk night
CW2: Dude we were both ducked (sic). Up lol. Make it home ok?
(AE G at 111)
Applicant explained that he sent the apologetic text because he didn’t want their
kissing and disrobing to negatively affect their friendship or  relationship at work. “And I
apologized in regards to kissing her as we were both colleagues and friends and I didn’t
want her to ruin things and be enemies. And since of her being a colleague I didn’t want
her to feel awkward in the future at work.” (Tr. 38) He also said that “[w]e were both drunk
and both decided to make a bad choice or maybe a choice that we might have regretted
as in affecting our friendship and such.” (Tr. 123) He thought that she had accepted his
explanation  based  upon  her  communications  that  night  and  later  that  weekend,  and
subsequent social interaction. (Tr. 38-39, 86-87, 122) Evidence of their social interaction
after the alleged misconduct included a photograph from about April 2019 that showed
19 people standing together in a social setting, eight of whom were positioned between
Applicant and CW2. (Answer; AE G at 113; Tr. 90-91, 114-116)
Applicant said that he did not know why CW2 or Roommate would lie about what
happened that night. (Tr. 77, 104) He claimed that CW2 and her boyfriend had broken up
less  than  a  week  earlier  and  believed  they  got  back  together  after  she  made  the
allegations against him. (Answer; AE G at 105; Tr. 91, 123-125) He said that there were
inconsistencies  between  CW2’s  and  Roommate’s  statements  reflected  in  other
documents  associated  with  the  court-martial  charges  but  did  not  specify  what  the
discrepancies were or submit corroborating documentary evidence. (Tr. 83-84) Applicant
did  not  provide  a  statement  to  investigators  or  any  testimony  regarding  CW2  or  her
allegations during the court-martial proceedings. (Tr. 84-85, 92-93)
Applicant estimated that he drank four to eight beers that evening. (Tr. 118-119)
He said that he felt the effects of the alcohol but “had full memory of the night [and] felt in
control of his faculties”. (Tr. 119-120) He saw CW2 drinking beer and shots but said she
“seemed coherent enough”, “was able to talk socially and interact”, “order [a taxi] on her
phone without any issues”, “was slightly drunk [but he] didn’t see anything abnormal or
different about it,” and that she was more drunk than him. (Tr. 69, 121)
Applicant admitted that he was discharged from the Air Force under Other Than
Honorable  Conditions  in  November  2020,  in  lieu  of  trial  by  court-martial  for  charges
preferred as a result of misconduct alleged in SOR ¶ 1.  (SOR ¶ 2.b, cross-alleged under
SOR  ¶  3.a)  In October 2019,  he  was  charged  with  one  sexual act  and  one  attempted
sexual  act  upon  CW2,  unlawful  entry  into  CW2’s  bathroom,  and  indecently  exposing
himself to CW2 and her Roommate in violation of Articles 80, 120, 120c, and 129, UCMJ.
Those  charges  were  referred  for trial  by  General  Court-Martial  in November 2019.  On
October  1,  2020,  Applicant  requested  a  Discharge  in  Lieu  of  Trial  by  Court-Martial
pursuant  to  Air  Force  Instruction  36-3208,  Chapter  4.  (AE  G  at  112)  His  request  was
submitted  after  consultation  with  his  military  and  civilian  attorneys  and  included
acknowledgments that he: (1) understood the elements of the offenses with which he was
charged; (2) had received a copy of the investigation; (3) was aware that his voluntary
request could result in an “other than honorable discharge,” and (4) that he was advised
of the “possible effects of discharge under these circumstances.” (Answer at Exhibit 29;
AE  G  at  112;  Tr.  94-95,  125-127)  His  request  did  not  include  an admission  of  guilt  or
statements of fact regarding the allegations or statements of CW2, Roommate or CW1.
(Answer at Exhibit 29; AE G at 112; Tr. 94-95) His request was approved by an Air Force
lieutenant general in November 2020 after consideration of supporting documents, and
the  recommendations  of  a  staff  judge  advocate  and  subordinate  commanders.  He
directed Applicant’s discharge be “Under Other than Honorable Conditions.” (Answer at
13-14; AE G at 37, 112; GE 3; Tr. 32)
Applicant  acknowledged  that  a  court-martial  conviction  could  have  resulted  in
imprisonment  and  a  punitive  discharge,  and  a  requirement  that  he  register  as  a  sex
offender.  He  testified  that  an  administrative  discharge  enabled  him  to  maintain  some
veteran’s benefits based upon his previous period of honorable service. He said that he
felt  confident  that  he  would  have  been  acquitted  had  the  case  proceeded  to  trial,  but
decided “the risk was not worth the reward[.]” (Answer; AE G at 36-37, 101-104, 112; Tr.
32, 39-40, 93-94, 101-103)
Alcohol Use
Applicant  acknowledged  that  “[b]oth  incidents  of  alleged  misconduct  revolved
around  alcohol,”  and  said  that  he  has  made  a  point  to  separate  himself  from  similar
situations and has surrounded himself with people that have his best interests in mind to
avoid future issues. (Tr. 129-131, 142-144) He said that prior to the allegations he would
drink about 10 beers, once or twice a week in part because of a culture of “socialization
through intoxication” viewed as critical to bonding with others in his unit, particularly those
with  shared  combat  experience.  (Tr.  43,  129-133)  He  has  significantly  modified  his
behavior  since  the  allegations  were  made.  He  abstained  from  drinking  alcoholic
beverages for approximately six months and has more recently consumed alcohol about
twice a month – usually five to six beers over a period of several hours. (Tr. 134-136) He
has not been referred for and has not sought or received counseling or treatment for his
alcohol use. (Tr. 129-131)
Character Evidence  and Credibility
Applicant  submitted  numerous
letters  of  recommendation  and  character
references from commissioned officers, non-commissioned officers and others including
his current supervisor, colleagues, friends, and neighbors that favorably commented on
his  honesty,  integrity,  trustworthiness,  judgment,  patriotism,  dependability,  work  ethic,
professionalism,  leadership,  handling  of  classified  information,  adherence  to  rules  and
regulations,  commitment  to  U.S.  national  security  and  his  mission,  and  superior
performance  in  combat  that  saved  lives  of  friendly  forces.  Many  of  the  letters  directly
recommend  or  support  approval  of  his  continued  access  to  classified  information.
