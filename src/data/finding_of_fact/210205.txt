Applicant  admitted  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.c,  and  essentially
denied  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.d  through  1.k,  2.a  and  2.b,  with  explanations.  His
admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  49  years  old.  He  served  in  the  military  from  1994  until  he  retired
honorably in 2014 in the paygrade of E-7. He married in 1999. He has three children with
his wife. He has three other children from relationships. A son was born in 2000. In 2001,
he fathered a daughter with another woman and later learned that he fathered a second
daughter  with  her,  born  in  2003.  He  was  not  made  aware  until  2005  of  the  second
daughter. He paid child support for the two children and when he learned of the third child,
he was required to pay back child support owed from 2003 to 2005. He testified that all
of his child support has been satisfied, and he no longer has any child support obligations
since the children are now adults. (Tr. 27-28, 30-36, 157-160, GE 1, 2, 3)
Applicant earned a bachelor’s degree in 2019 and a master’s degree in 2020. He
has been employed by federal contractors since January 2015. He reported a period of
unemployment  after  his  retirement  from  the  military  from  November  2014  to  January
2015. (Tr. 72, 156; GE 2, 3)
Applicant testified he deployed to a foreign country in 2007.  While there, he had
sexual intercourse with a foreign national four times, twice at an apartment and twice at
a  friend’s  residence.  He  testified  that  she  was  not  a  prostitute,  and  he  never  paid  her
money. He was married at the time. He did not report her as a foreign contact. He testified
that he did not know his contact with her was considered a “foreign contact” and should
have  been  reported.  He  testified  prior  to  his  deployment  he  had  not  been  briefed  on
contacts with foreign nationals. (Tr. 32, 117-120, 123-124, 187)
In 2012, Applicant deployed again to the same country. He had a military member
as a roommate at the hotel. They were staying at the same hotel he had stayed at during
his  2007  deployment.  One  of  the  hotel  staff  recognized  him  and  was  aware  he  had  a
“relationship” with a woman when he was there in 2007 and inferred that he had fathered
a  child  during  his  previous  deployment.  Applicant  testified  that  he  asked  the  hotel
employee to provide him the woman’s telephone number, which he did. He contacted the
woman and they met at the hotel. He asked her to return and bring the child. He testified
that he purchased a hotel room because his roommate was smoking in their room. She
met him in his hotel room with her child. He determined he was not the father of the child.
He  ordered  food  through  room  service.  They  did  not  engage  in  sexual  conduct  during
their 2012 meetings. The information about Applicant’s rendezvous came to light when
the  Naval  Criminal  Investigative  Service  was  investigating  potential  prostitution  at  the
hotel. He testified that the investigation determined she was not a prostitute. (Tr. 37-44,
120-126)
In February 2013, Applicant went to a Uniform Code of Military Justice Article 15
nonjudicial  proceeding  (NJP)  for  violation  of  Article  92,  failure  to  obey  an  order  for
wrongfully and knowingly having contact with a suspected prostitute in a foreign country
and having a non-military guest in his hotel room. His punishment was forfeitures of pay
for two months and 45 days of restriction. He was an E-7 at the time. (Tr. 37, 41-44)
In June 2015, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA). Section
15 requested he provide information about his military history. It specifically asked for the
dates  of  service.  Applicant  responded  to  this  inquiry  with  his  active  duty  dates  from
“09/1994”  to  “10/2014.”  The  SCA  also  asked  him  if  he  was  discharged,  which  he
responded  “yes.”  It  then  asked  for  the  details  of  his  discharge,  and  he  responded
“honorable.”  Another   question   asked:  “Provide   other  discharge   type.”  Applicant
responded: “Retired  with  20  years 1  month  from  active  service.” This was information  that
was not  repopulated. He  reported  he  did  not have  any additional military service  to  report.
The   bold   header  labeled   “Discipline”  asked:  In  the   last  7   years,  have   you   been
subjected   to   court  martial  or  other  disciplinary  procedure  under  the   Uniform   Code   of
Military Justice  (UCMJ), such  as Article 15, Captain’s mast, Article 135  Court of Inquiry,
etc.” Applicant responded “no.” (Tr. 47, 126-132; GE 1)
Applicant explained he did not disclose his NJP because the SCA repopulated his
response of “no” from his previous SCA. He said he was in a “robotic” mode and missed
answering  this  question  correctly.  He  provided  other  new  information  as  noted  above,
such  as  duty  stations  and  his  active-duty  dates  and  characterization  of  his  discharge.
Applicant admitted that he did not disclose his NJP and said it was not intentional. I did
not find Applicant credible. I find he deliberately failed to disclose his February 2013 NJP
on his 2015 SCA. (Tr. 47; 126-132; GE 1)
Applicant testified that when he was interviewed by a government investigator in
September  2015,  he  provided  information  about  his  2013  NJP  when  the  investigator
specifically asked him about the details. He said he told the investigator that he did not
disclose  the  NJP  on  his  SCA  due  to  an  oversight.  Applicant  testified  that  he  told  the
investigator that he was unaware that his roommate had three females in their hotel room
for two parties. Applicant said he did not attend the parties. He was at work. He told the
investigator that there was an investigation about the females in the hotel room he shared
with a roommate, but they were not prostitutes. Having any guests while they were in a
foreign country was prohibited. He said he was unaware of the party. He admitted at his
hearing that he did not tell the investigator that he had met privately with a female foreign
national whom he believed could potentially be the mother of his child. He rented a hotel
room to meet with her, which was in violation of military orders. He met with her twice on
two different days.  Applicant’s testimony  lacked  candor and  was  not credible.  I find he
deliberately falsified and concealed material facts when he failed to provide accurate and
honest  information  to  the  government  investigator  and  did  not  disclose  that  he  met
privately  with  a  female  foreign  national  in  a  separate  hotel  room  as  he  testified  at  his
hearing. (Tr. 132-140; GE 1)
In  2003,  Applicant  was  granted  a  conditional  security  clearance  because  of
financial concerns. He was cautioned that future receipt of derogatory information or his
failure to comply fully with the conditions of his clearance would be cause for immediate
reconsideration.  He  was  required  to  continue  to  pay  his  child  support  and  arrearage,
resolve any additional delinquent debts and remain current on his financial obligations.
(GE 6)
In 2011, Applicant was again granted a conditional security clearance because of
financial concerns. His 2011 conditional security determination stated:
It   is  imperative   that  you   continue   working   with   your  creditors  to   establish
payment plans on  all  of your delinquent accounts.  You  must also  continue
to  make  full  and  timely payments  to  all  creditors with  the  intent on  becoming
current on  all  accounts. Thereafter, maintain a  stable  and  solvent financial
status, ensuring  all  payments to  creditors are accomplished  in a  regular and
timely manner. (GE 7)
Applicant  attributed  his  financial  issues  to  never  being  properly  educated  about
financial management or how credit worked. He also attributed it to his son coming to live
with him in 2015. (Tr. 30; GE 6, 7)
Applicant  filed  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  in  April  2014.  In  July  2014,  he  had
approximately $82,000 of debt discharged. He explained he was getting ready to retire
from the military and his wife had been working only sporadically. They wanted to save
their house and get a reset on their finances. (Tr. 48; GE 10)
Applicant  testified  that  after  retiring  from  the  military  in  October  2014,  he  was
unable to get a job for about six to seven months. From 2015 to 2019, his wife worked
sporadically, and they again struggled financially. He has a child who is a diabetic. He
said his military medical coverage for retirees, Tricare, was expensive for her needs. He
also had child support payments. He and his wife were also helping her mother who was
struggling  financially  after  her  spouse  passed  away.  In  2015,  without  prior  notice,  the
mother of his son dropped him off with Applicant to care for him permanently. He testified
that they got behind on their car payments. He also disclosed in his July 2020 and April
2021 SCAs that he went on a “family vacation [c]ruise in 2015 or 2016. Cozumel Mexico
Carnival cruise line.” (Tr. 48-51, 164; GE 2, 3)
Applicant testified that it was disruptive in 2015 when his son moved in with him
and  his  family.  His  son  was  diagnosed  with  oppositional  defiant  disorder.  He  was
frequently in trouble at school and was suspended and expelled three times from three
different schools. He was breaking into cars and using marijuana. He would run away for
three to four days at a time. Applicant was concerned about his conduct and the people
he spent time with. His son was concerned there was a bounty on him. Applicant’s son
was shot in February 2020. He was shot a second time in June 2020 while waiting in line
to apply for a job. He did not survive. The crime has not been solved. This tragic event
impacted the whole family. (Tr. 59-63; AE R)
In July 2020, Applicant completed another SCA. He did not disclose any debts in
collection, charged off, or if he had property voluntarily or involuntarily repossessed. He
also did not disclose that in the past seven years if he had been delinquent more than
120 days on any debt and was currently more than 120 days delinquent on any debt, as
required under Section 26. He testified that his failure to disclose this information was an
oversight. The SCA also asked if in the past seven years he filed a petition for bankruptcy.
He disclosed he had filed bankruptcy in 2012. (Tr. 140; GE 2)
As noted above Applicant’s bankruptcy proceedings were in 2014. Under Section
26, a box for optional comments is provided. Applicant wrote:
All  bills are currently on  auto  payment.  Co-pays from  wife  losing  job due  to
covid-19   and   me   being   out  of  work March  through   July 2019   because   of
kidney surgery. 3[]0% of my right kidney was  removed  because  of a  mass
(non[] cancerous).  (GE 2)
In  Applicant’s April 2021  SCA, he  did  not  disclose  any  debts  in  collection,  charged
off,  or if  he  had  property voluntarily or involuntarily repossessed.  He  also did  not  disclose
that  in the  past seven  years if he  had  been  delinquent  more than  120  days on  any  debt
and  was currently more  than  120  days delinquent on  any debt,  as required  under Section
26.  He  wrote   the   identical  comments  under  the   optional  comment  section,  except  he
corrected   the   percentage   of  his  kidney  that   was  removed.  He  also   disclosed   he   filed
bankruptcy in 2012, which was incorrect.  (Tr. 141-143;  GE  3)
Applicant  defaulted  on  his  mortgage  that  went  into  foreclosure.  (SOR  ¶  1.d).
Applicant  testified  that  the  foreclosure  was  satisfied  through  his  2014  bankruptcy.  He
provided a document to show his mortgage payment on a house he purchased in January
2023 ($459,000) is current. (Tr. 149-152; GE 12, 15; AE D)
SOR ¶ 1.k ($17,888) (duplicate alleged in ¶ 1.i ($21,386)) alleged a charged-off
car loan. Applicant testified he purchased a vehicle in October 2016 after his son began
living  with  him  because  they  needed  a  bigger  car.  He  said  his  wife  was  making  the
payments,  so  he  was  unaware  when  it  became  delinquent.  He  said  he  was  confused
about this debt because at the time he and his wife owned two vehicles of the same make,
but  different  models.  He  admitted  at  one  time  he  was  behind  on  payments  for  both
vehicles. He denied this debt (twice) in his answer to the SOR stating that he did not know
the nature or origin of the debt alleged. The car was repossessed. He admitted he was
aware of the repossession. He tried to reclaim the vehicle but was unsuccessful. He said
he was unaware of the balance owed. He said he could not locate the debt. He explained
his failure to disclose this repossession and charged-off debt on his SCA was due to an
oversight.  He  said  he  answered  the  SOR  the  way  he  did  because  he  was  confused
because it was alleged twice and he wanted to verify it. I did not find Applicant credible.
In August 2023, Applicant made a payment arrangement with the creditor to resolve the
debt by making monthly payments of $825 from August 2023 through July 2025. He has
made the first two monthly payments.  (Tr. 50, 56, 75-81, 89-99, 153-155; GE 2; AE J, T)
The  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.e  ($6,193)  (duplicate  alleged  ¶  1.j  ($17,445))  is  for  a  car
purchased  by  Applicant  in  September  2017  and  repossessed  in  2019  for  missed
payments.  Applicant  testified  that  he  spoke  with  customer  service  and  made  the
delinquent payments to bring the debt current. It was brought current in 2019 and he was
able  to  keep  the  vehicle.  The  credit  reports  reflect  the  debt  as  charged  off.  Applicant
provided a  receipt  from  the  creditor from  May  2022  showing  the debt  was paid.  In his
SOR answer, he denied this debt (twice) stating that he did not know the nature or origin
of the debt alleged. He explained he thought that the debt was another account and he
was paying the account for the repossessed vehicle. He said he answered the SOR the
way  he did because he  was  confused because  it was  alleged  twice  and he  wanted to
verify it. I did not find him credible. He did not disclose on his 2020 or 2021 SCA that this
vehicle  was  repossessed  or that  he  was behind  on  his payments. (Tr. 51-52,  81-87, 89-
98, 152-153; GE  14;  AE G)
The  debts  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.f  ($569), 1.g  ($426), and  1.h  ($221) are  medical  debts.
Applicant testified that these were medical bills for a daughter who lives with her mother.
The mother was supposed to pay  the balance on the bills after Tricare paid the claim.
She did not. He testified that he obtained the cumulative balance and paid it in July 2022.
He provided documentary evidence that the debts are paid. (Tr. 51-55, 153; AE H, I)
Applicant  purchased  a 2019  car in 2022 for approximately $48,000.  He  said he
was in a place in his life that he decided to get a car that he always wanted. His monthly
car payment is $1,000. He is anticipating selling this vehicle to reduce his car payments
and expedite paying his other car debt. (Tr. 56-58, 154-155)
Post-hearing,  Applicant  provided  a  copy  of  a  budget  that  reflects  his  monthly
income is $6,984; VA disability is $3,971; and military retirement is $2,295, which totals
a  $13,251  monthly  income.  He  has  approximately  $3,851  remaining  at  the  end  of  the
month after he pays his expenses. He provided proof that he no longer has child support
obligations.  His  wife  has  not  been  employed  since  2019  and  has  medical  issues.  He
participated in consumer credit counseling through the Internet in August 2022  and the
mandatory counseling for filing bankruptcy. He provided a copy of his July 2023 electric
bill showing it was paid timely. He provided copies of his water bill from February 2023 to
July  2023  showing  he  made  timely  payments  and  his  monthly  mortgage  payment  in
August 2023 ($4,282) was paid timely. (Tr. 144-149; AE A, B, C, E, F, S)
In  January  2020,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  domestic  battery
involving  the  touching  or  striking  of  his  spouse.  His  case  was  disposed  of  through  a
special Pretrial Diversion (PTD) program for veterans in May 2021 after he completed the
program mandates. (Tr. 59; AE M)
Applicant testified that he got into an argument with his wife, he put his hands on
her shoulders and  she slapped  them  away. His  daughter called  a family member who
called the police. There were no injuries, and Applicant denied he struck his wife.  The
PTD  program  required  counseling  with  a  doctor  from  the  VA  where  they  discussed
communication, conflict resolution, and mindfulness. Applicant found it beneficial to his
mental health and took responsibility for his conduct. He testified it helped him with his
grief after the death of his son. The charge was dismissed. He testified that his marriage
is good and two of his children are in college. They continue to work together as a family
and communicate effectively. (Tr. 59, 64-69, 101-116, 154; AE K, L, M)
Applicant provided a certificate noting he has completed the requirements by the
National Rifle Association and is designated a certified instructor to teach a basic course

Any  derogatory  information  that  was  not  alleged  will  not  be  considered  for
disqualifying purposes but may be considered in the application of mitigating conditions,
in making a credibility determination, and in a whole-person analysis.
