Applicant denied all the SOR allegations. He is 41 years old. As of the date of the
hearing, he was engaged to be married, and he has three children, ages 23, 7, and 3. He
graduated  from high school in 2000 and earned an associate degree in 2006. He also
has  received  several  certifications  in  information  technology.  He  and  his  fiancée  have
resided together in a rental property since January 2023. (Tr. at 4-5, 7, 9, 12, 28, 45-47,
55-56, 74; GE 1-3, 7; AE B, F)
Applicant served in the U.S. military from August 2000 to January 2005, and he
deployed to Iraq in 2003. He  received a general discharge under honorable conditions
after he was administratively discharged for misconduct. Since approximately 2006, he
has worked, at times, for various DOD contractors, to include periods in which he worked
overseas from April 2010 to April 2012 and March 2013 to October 2016. In April 2012,
the DOD contractor for whom he had  worked overseas since April 2010, issued him a
written reprimand for submitting erroneous time sheets, and terminated him for violating
the  company’s  information  technology  policy  by  having  unauthorized  music  on  his
computer. In October 2016, another DOD contractor for whom he had worked overseas
since August 2015, terminated him due to his inability to obtain a security clearance. He
subsequently continued to live overseas until December 2018, when he returned to the
United States. (Tr. at 10-11, 29-47; GE 1-3, 7; AE A, B, F)
Applicant  was  unemployed  from  October  2007  to  February  2008,  April  2012  to
March 2013, October 2016 to February 2019, and January 2023 to April 2023. He worked
only part time, as a delivery driver, from February 2019 to August 2019. Since then, he
has worked full time for various employers, and he was hired by his current employer in
April 2023. He and his sister also started their own business in April 2023, but they had
not yet generated income as of the date of the hearing. He was first granted a security
clearance in 2000, when he served in the U.S. military, and that clearance was revoked
in September 2016 when a DOHA administrative judge found that he had failed to mitigate
personal conduct security concerns. (Tr. at 5, 10-11, 29-47; GE 1-3, 5-7, 57-59, 74-76;
AE A, B, F)
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  had  four  delinquent  consumer  debts  totaling
$28,601. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d) It also alleged that he failed to timely file his federal income
tax returns, as required, for tax years (TY) 2012 through 2018, and that his federal income
tax returns for TY 2015 through 2018 remained unfiled. (SOR ¶¶ 1.e-1.f) It also alleged
that he failed to timely file his state income tax returns, as required, for tax years 2015
through 2020. (SOR ¶ 1.g) The SOR allegations are established by Applicant’s October
2017 and May 2020 SCAs; his undated response to DOHA interrogatories, in which he
provided IRS tax account transcripts from January 2022; and credit bureau reports from
August 2021 and July 2022. (Answer; GE 1-5)
Applicant attributed his failure to file his federal and state income tax returns and
his delinquent debts primarily to his uncertainty about how to file his income tax returns
when he worked overseas. He had difficulty finding a tax professional who knew how to
file income tax returns on income that he earned overseas. His period of unemployment
and underemployment, after his security clearance was revoked in 2016, as well as, in
part, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, were also contributing factors.  He also has paid
approximately $3,000 in legal expenses since 2020 in a custody battle with the mother of
his three-year-old child. He obtained the loans and credit card in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.d,
as further discussed below, for living expenses, to include financially supporting his three
children.  As  of  the  date  of  the  hearing,  he  was  also  preparing  financially  to  become a
grandfather, as his 23-year-old was expecting a child. (Tr. at 7-9, 28, 29-86; GE 1-3, 7;
AE B, D, E, G)
Applicant hired and worked with a credit education service from approximately May
2011 to 2015 to help improve his credit. In approximately 2022, he disputed the debts in
SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.d to determine their validity. He began working with another credit
education service, in approximately February 2023, to repair and improve his credit. He
also completed a financial seminar offered by his church in approximately February 2023,
and he enrolled in another financial class to continue learning about how to manage his
finances. (Tr. at 7-9, 48-54, 62-70, 79-86; GE 1-3; AE B, D, E, G)
From  approximately  2014  to  2016,  Applicant  retained  and  worked  with  a  tax
professional “for expats,”  to file: his “2010  Form  1040  Income  <$100,000” for TY  2010
through 2013; his outstanding federal income tax returns for TY 2014 and 2015; and his
state income tax returns for TY 2010 through 2014. In 2021, he attempted to work with
his mother’s accountant to file his income tax returns, but that individual was unfamiliar
with  filing  income  tax  returns  for  income  earned  overseas.  In  May  2023,  he  retained
another tax professional “for expats”  to file his federal income tax returns for TY 2017,
2020,  2021,  and  2022.  He  did  not  believe  he  was  required  to  file  his  federal  or  state
income tax returns when he was unemployed from 2016 to 2018, and he did not believe
he  was  required  to  file  his  state  income  tax  return  for  TY  2015,  when  he  resided  and
worked overseas. He did not provide any documentation concerning the status of his state
income tax returns for TY 2019 and 2020, when he lived and worked in the United States.
(Tr. at 7-9, 48-54, 62-70, 79-86; GE 1-3; AE B, D, E, G)
January  2022  IRS  tax  account  transcripts  reflect  that  Applicant  did  not  file  his
federal income tax returns for tax year (TY) 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2019 until April 2015,
October 2015, December 2015, and May 2020, respectively. The transcripts also reflect
that he owes $18,780 and $1,285 in federal taxes for TY 2012 and 2013, respectively. He
established an  installment  agreement  with the  IRS  in  March 2016,  but that  agreement
was no longer in effect as of September 2016, and the balances due on his account were
not collectible as of October 2021 “not due to hardship.” The transcripts also reflect that
he had not yet filed his federal income tax returns for TY 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2020,
and 2021, and the IRS issued him refunds, in part due to tax relief credits, for TY 2020
and 2021 totaling approximately $2,300 and $6,200, respectively. (GE 2)
SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.d are for charged-off loans with the same creditor in the amounts
of $16,566 and $557, respectively. SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c are charged-off loans with another
creditor  in  the  amounts  of  $10,014  and  $1,464,  respectively.  As  previously  stated,
Applicant stated that he disputed these debts in approximately 2022 to determine their
validity. As of the date of the hearing, he planned to contact these creditors, with the help
of the credit education service, to negotiate payment plans and resolve these debts. (Tr.
at 52-54, 59, 61-67, 76-81; GE 2, 4, 5)
Applicant’s  annual  income  as  of  the  date  of  the  hearing  was  approximately
$90,000. Coupled with his other revenue sources, he anticipated a total annual income
of $110,000, an increase from his annual income of approximately $60,000 to $90,000
since  August  2019.  He  had  just  obtained  a  10  percent  disability  rating  from  the  U.S.
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), which he expected to increase based on additional
paperwork he had recently submitted to the VA. He intends to hire a tax professional to
assist  him  with  filing  required  tax  returns  for  his  business.  He  learned  about  the
importance of making a budget. He and his fiancée split their monthly rent of $1,000. After
paying  his  monthly  living  expenses  of  approximately  $1,700,  he  anticipated  that  his
monthly net remainder would be approximately $2,000 to $3,000. He intends to resolve
his financial issues so that he can purchase a home. (Tr. at 29-63, 74-76, 87-88)
Numerous character references, to include a former supervisor, former coworkers,
close  friends,  and  fellow  church  members,  attested  to  Applicant’s  trustworthiness,
reliability, and judgment. (AE C)
