Applicant is a 43-year-old employee of a government contractor for whom he has
worked,  on  and  off,  since  December  2018.  He  was  married  from  July  2007  until
September 2016.  He currently  has  a  girlfriend  with  whom  he  cohabitates.  He  has  one
15-year-old  child  with  whom  he  shares  custody  with  his  ex-wife.  His  girlfriend’s  two
children  also  reside  with  him.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2015.  He  served  on
active  duty  with  the  Navy  from  1999  until  2007,  when  he  earned  an  honorable
discharge. (Tr. 22-23, 28-37, 43-44, 63-64; GE 1, 4)
In  the  SOR,  the  Government  alleged  Applicant’s  18  delinquent  federal  student
loans  and  one  delinquent  tuition  account  totaling  approximately  $71,000  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a
through  1.s).  He  denied  all  the  SOR  allegations.  Despite  his  denials,  the  SOR
allegations  are  established  by  the  Government’s  2021  and  2022  credit  reports.  (SOR;
Answer, GE 2, 3, AE D)
None of the SOR debts were being resolved prior to the hearing. Applicant and
his ex-wife opened these federal student loan and tuition accounts with the Department
of  Education  (DOE)  and  the  online  college  beginning  in  about  2011,  to  finance  their
higher  education  expenses.  Applicant  claimed  that  his  ex-wife  took  care  of  the  family
finances,  while  he  worked.  He  recalls  signing  a  packet  of  documents  that  was  an
application for student loans, but he did not look at the packet closely and cannot recall
the specifics, such as loan amounts. He claimed that his ex-wife led him to believe that
she  was  only  borrowing  money  to  pay  for  Christmas  presents  and  to  upgrade  his
gaming  personal  computer.  However,  he  acknowledged  that  when  he  signed  the  loan
packet,  he  knew he  was  applying  for  a  student  loan  and may  have  authorized  the  full
student loan and tuition balance alleged in the SOR. (Tr. 22-27, 38- 44, 58-59; GE 1-4;
AE A, C, D)
Appellant suspects that his ex-wife opened additional federal student loans in his
name  without  his  knowledge  and  consent.  However,  he  provided  no  corroborating
evidence to this effect. He provided printouts of a selection of text messages between
him  and  his  wife  over  several  years,  but  those  text  messages  are  inconclusive  as  to
whether she did so. In those text messages, he blames her for taking out the loans and
tuition and she disagrees and claims they both applied for them. He also acknowledged
that  the  loan  package  he  signed  may  have  been  for  the  full  loan  and  tuition  amount
because he did not read the documents. He claimed that he and his wife both had G.I.
Bill benefits and therefore did not need to apply for student loans. However, he did not
explain why he agreed to apply for federal student loans that he allegedly did not need.
(Tr. 22-27, 38-44, 58-59; GE 1-4; AE A, C, D)
Applicant claimed that he first became aware of the full extent of his student loan
and tuition indebtedness in about July 2015, when he happened to look at his account
information  online.  Based  upon  his  ex-wife’s  representation  to  him,  he  believed  for
some  time  that  she  could  get  all  the  indebtedness  forgiven  if  she  received  a  higher
disability  rating  from  Veterans  Affairs  (VA).  He  claimed  that  from  the  time  repayment
was  required  until  about  2016,  his  ex-wife  deferred  the  federal  student  loans  with  the
service  provider.  She  stopped  these  deferral  requests  in  about  2016  when  they
divorced. Applicant claimed they divorced because he caught her cheating on him. (Tr.
22-25, 42-49; GE 1, 4; AE A, C, D)
After  Applicant  and  his  ex-wife  divorced  in  2016,  the  deferments  on  the  federal
student  loans  ended,  and  all  the  SOR  debts  became  delinquent.  He  began  receiving
notices  that  he  was  late  with  his  payments  on  his  federal  student  loans.  Other  than
arguing with his ex-wife as to who was responsible for repayment, he took no action to
address the SOR debts until about February 2020. He did not attempt to negotiate her
responsibility  for  the  debts  as  part  of  the  divorce  proceeding.  He  did  not  dispute  the
debts  with  the  DOE  or  its  loan  service  provider.  He  did  not  dispute  the  debt  with  the
credit reporting agencies. He did not bring criminal charges against his ex-wife, and he
did not bring a civil suit against her. (Tr. 22-25, 44-58; GE 1, 4; AE C, D)
In  about  February  2020,  he  contacted  the  loan  service  provider  for  the  federal
student loans and arranged to automatically pay $5 per month. He made no more than
two  monthly  payments  pursuant  to  this  agreement  before,  at  the  end  of  March  2020,
President Biden ordered that all federal student loans were placed in a deferment status
during the COVID-19 pandemic, and those payments stopped. He provided no evidence
to  show  that  any  of  the  SOR  debts  were  not  delinquent  prior  to  being  placed  in  a
deferment status. The Government’s 2021 and 2022  credit reports show that the SOR
debts  were  in  collections.  Therefore,  I  find  that  Applicant’s  federal  student  loans  were
delinquent before the COVID-19 deferment began. (Tr. 24-25, 50-58; GE 1, 4; AE B, D)
The  COVID-19  deferment  on  federal  student  loans  has  ended.  As  Applicant’s
federal student  loans  were  deferred  because  of  COVID-19, he  stopped  making  his  $5
monthly payment after March 2020. He did not make any payments from then until after
the hearing. He does not know how much his monthly payment on his loans will be. As
of the hearing, he had not contacted the DOE or the loan service provider to determine
this  information.  He  is  unsure  whether  he  will  have  the  available  funds  to  pay  his
minimum  monthly  payment  when  it  becomes  due  as  he  does  not  follow  a  written
budget.  After  the  hearing,  he  made  a  $110  payment  towards  some  portion  of  the
student  loans  listed  in  the  SOR.  He  provided  no  evidence  that  he  has  attempted  to
resolve  the  online  college  tuition  account.  He  claimed  that  he  has  about  $1,600  in  a
checking account and $6,400 invested in cryptocurrency. (Tr. 24-25, 50-68, 70-71; AE
B, D)
While the federal  student  loans are listed as “pays as agreed”  in one portion of
the Government’s 2023 credit report, there is no evidence that this status is a result of
Applicant’s  resolution  efforts.  He  testified  that  he  does  not  know  why  the  credit  report
reflects that change. Moreover, the student loans are also listed as “at least 120 days or
more  than  four  payments  past  due”  elsewhere  in  that  credit  report.  There  is  also  no
evidence of a  favorable  resolution  of the  tuition account.  While  they  are not  alleged in
the SOR, the Government’s 2023 credit report reflects that he is also no more than two
payments behind on a mortgage and an auto loan. The same credit report reflects that
he took out a loan for $6,000 in 2022 to go on vacation. (Tr. 56-57, 62-63; GE 5; AE B)
There  were  several  reasons  that  Applicant  was  unable  to  pay  the  SOR  debts.
Initially,  the  cause  was  that he failed to  keep  track  of  his own  finances  and  let  his ex-
wife take care of his financial obligations. While she may have made it difficult for him to
determine how much money he had borrowed, he was still responsible for reading the
loan  documents  he  signed  and  for  monitoring  his  financial  accounts.  He  ultimately
learned of the total amount of his federal student loans and tuition by simply logging on
to his online account. There is no evidence in the record to indicate that he was unable
to make that determination any time between 2011 and 2015. (Tr. 22-25, 28-35, 37-49;
GE 1, 4; AE A)
Once  Applicant  did  his  due  diligence  and  became  aware  of  the  SOR  debts  in
2015, his failure to address these accounts was caused partly by his own  inaction and
partly  by  a  divorce,  unemployment,  and  underemployment.  He  was  unemployed  from
sometime in 2017 until December 2018, then worked part time for his current employer
until December 2019. Beginning in December 2019, he worked full time with his current
employer and then another employer until the spring of 2023. Since the spring of 2023
he has been back with the same employer for whom he worked beginning in December
2018  but  is  only  working  part  time.  He  has  also  worked  part  time  as  an  insurance
salesman and a photographer. (Tr. 22-25, 28-35, 42-49, 65-70; GE 1, 4; AE D)
Applicant  submitted  numerous  character  letters  from  family,  friends,  and  co-
workers, some of whom were members of law enforcement or the military. All reference
his  integrity,  honesty,  reliability,  and  strong  work  ethic.  They  also  write  that  he  is  an
excellent father to his son  and a positive role  model in  the community.  Some  note his
difficult relationship with his ex-wife and blame her for his financial issues. (AE A)
