Applicant  admitted  all  the  Guideline  F  allegations  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.p)  without
further  comment.  He  denied  the  sole  Guideline  B  allegation  (SOR  ¶  2.a)  with  a  brief
explanation. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After  a thorough
and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant is 44 years old. His marriage, from 2005 to 2019, ended in divorce and
produced  no  children.  He  has  two  children  from  earlier  relationships,  a  daughter  (24)
and a son in college (19). A daughter from a current relationship was born in November
2022,  as  discussed  below.  (Tr.  31-32,  50-52;  AE  B)  Applicant  earned  an  associate
degree in 2013. His most recent period of unemployment was in 2011 or 2012. He has
held a variety of jobs since then, mostly in his field of electronics. He began working for
his  current  employer,  a  defense  contractor,  in  September  2020.  He  earns  about
$128,000 annually. (GE 1; Tr. 55, 58, 61, 67-71, 122)
Guideline B
On  his  September  2020  SCA,  Applicant  disclosed  a  relationship  with  a  woman
from  Ukraine.  He  noted  that  he  had  proposed  marriage  and  that  the  woman  was
employed  by  the  Ukrainian  army,  working  in  food  service  on  a  military  base.  (GE  1)
(Guideline B, SOR ¶ 2.a)
In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  reported  that  their  relationship  ended  in
March 2021. He also said he began a relationship with a woman in the U.S. in late July
2021 and they began cohabitating by the end of 2021. They now have a daughter, born
in  November  2022,  and  he  is  happy  with  his  new  life.  (AE  B;  Tr.  31-32,  50-52)  His
cohabitant also has two teenagers. (Tr. 71) She works as a registered nurse. (Tr. 104)
Applicant said he met the Ukrainian woman on a dating website in July 2019. He
visited  her  in  October  2019,  and  they  began  dating  long-distance.  They  had  daily
contact through a social media application. He visited her again in July 2020, and again
twice between November 2020 and January 2021. She worked on a Ukrainian military
base and lived nearby. He stayed at her home when she went to work. During the July
2020 visit, they vacationed together, with her children, at a beach on the Black Sea. He
also  proposed  marriage.  He  last  saw  her  in  January  2021,  and  he  ended  the
relationship two months later, in March 2021. He testified that they have had no further
contact,  and  he  is not  aware  of  her  whereabouts.  Applicant  reported  his  contacts  with
his  Ukrainian  girlfriend  to  his  company  security  officials  and  filled  out  appropriate
security paperwork. (Answer; Tr. 50-51, 71-79) He asserted that if she were coerced to
try to get information from him, any such efforts would be met by “a wall.” (Tr. 125)
Ukraine
I  have  read  and  considered  the  administratively  noticed  facts  set  forth  in  AN  I
concerning Ukraine, and they are adopted in full and incorporated by reference into the
Findings of Fact. The only allegation concerning Applicant’s connections to Ukraine that
makes those facts relevant here is SOR ¶ 2.a, a former girlfriend of Applicant’s, a citizen
and resident of Ukraine and an employee of the Ukrainian military. Applicant ended the
relationship  in  March  2021  and  said  they  have  had  no  further  contact.  Applicant  has
also had a child with a woman in the United States, born in November 2022, and they
are now cohabitating. Given the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia, there is an
obvious foreign influence security concern involving Ukraine. However, Applicant has no
current or recent  connections to Ukraine, or with  his ex-girlfriend, to  suggest a  current
ongoing security concern due to that connection. I therefore see little reason to discuss
the facts in AN I about Ukraine any further.
Guideline F
Applicant disclosed tax issues and other debts on his September 2020 SCA. He
cited  his  divorce  as  a  cause  for  the  debts.  (GE  1  at  36-41,  44)  He  discussed  his
finances in background interviews conducted a month later. (GE 2 at 8-11)
Applicant  testified  that  most  of  his  debts  were  accrued  during  his marriage.  His
wife  was  responsible  for  filing  their  tax  returns,  and  he  learned  after  their  divorce  that
she had not done so. They would typically file joint returns. (Tr. 36-39, 55-57)
The  SOR  concerns  allegations  of  late-filed  federal  income  tax  returns  (SOR  ¶
1.a), past-due federal income taxes (SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.e), state income taxes (SOR ¶¶ 1.f,
1.g), federal student loans (SOR ¶¶ 1.l-1.o), and consumer debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.h-1.k, 1.p).
SOR ¶ 1.a concerns late-filed federal income tax returns for tax years (TY) 2017,
2018, and 2019. Applicant reported on an interrogatory response to DOHA that he filed
the returns in July 2021 but was not on a payment plan. (GE 2 at 5-7; Tr. 57, 79-80)
Applicant also owes past-due federal income taxes for these years. This includes
$3,249 for TY 2016 (SOR ¶ 1.b); $4,919 for TY 2017 (SOR ¶ 1.c), $5,951 for TY 2018
(SOR ¶ 1.d); and $7,329 for TY 2019 (SOR ¶ 1.e).
Applicant’s  IRS  account  transcript  for  TY  2017,  provided  with  his  interrogatory
response in 2021, shows no return filed. (GE 2 at 26) He indicated that he filed a paper
copy of his TY 2017 federal return in July 2021, on the same date as his TY 2018 and
TY 2019 returns, but a copy of that return was not included with GE 2. He said he was
waiting for confirmation that the IRS had accepted it. (GE 2 at 6-7) He indicated that he
owed $4,919. (GE 2 at 5) (SOR ¶ 1.c) Post-hearing documentation for TY 2017 from the
IRS  says  Applicant’s  “information  is  not  available  at  this  time.”  (AE  C)  This  suggests
they have no return on file from Applicant for TY 2017.
Applicant filed his TY 2018 federal tax return in July 2021. He owed $5,951 (GE
2  at  23)  (SOR  ¶  1.d)  Post-hearing  documentation  for  TY  2018  from  the  IRS  shows  a
balance of about $3,514, and he said after the hearing that the amount is $3,556. (AE
C, AE D)
Applicant  filed  his  TY  2019  federal  income  tax  return  in  July  2021.  He  owed
$7,329. (GE 2 at 20) (SOR ¶ 1.e) Post-hearing documentation for TY 2019 from the IRS
shows a balance of about $7,600. (AE D)
Applicant filed his TY 2020 federal income tax return in July 2021. He was issued
a  refund  of  $1,732.  (GE  2  at  17;  AE  D)  He  said  he  filed  his  TY  2021  and  TY  2022
federal and state returns and was due refunds. He said that the IRS has kept his refund
money to address his earlier tax debt. He said he asked about a payment plan with the
IRS, but they would not discuss one until all of his past-due returns have been filed and
accepted. (Tr. 37-41, 57, 81, 82) He has had an accountant to help prepare his taxes for
several years. (Tr. 85-86)
Applicant testified that he received a letter from the IRS indicating that he owed
$3,556 in total past-due taxes as of April 2023, but he clarified after the hearing that this
figure is for TY 2018. (AE C) He plans to pay off his taxes by the end of May 2024. (Tr.
36-37, 40-41) The letter from the IRS is not in the record.
Applicant also owed $282 in past-due state income taxes for TY 2016 and 2017
(SOR  ¶  1.f,  as  amended).  (GE  2  at  6,  GE  2  at  29-30;  Tr.  82-83).  Post-hearing
documentation shows no state tax balance owed. (Tr. 39; AE E) He said he has filed all
of  his  state  tax  returns  from  TY  2017  through  TY  2022.  He  typically  receives  state
income tax refunds of less than $200. (Tr. 83-84)
SOR ¶¶ 1.l-1.o concern past-due federal student loans with the U.S. Department
of Education (USDOE), totaling about $13,546. (GE 3, GE 4, GE 5) Applicant does not
dispute the status of his student loans. He incurred them in 2013. He could not afford to
address  his  student  loans  after  his  divorce,  when  he  assumed  responsibility  for  all
household bills. The credit reports show the most recent payment was in July 2017. (GE
6;  Tr.  94-95)  He  is  aware  that  they  have  been  in  deferred  status  due  to  the  COVID
pandemic  since  March  2020,  but  that  repayment  is  soon  to  resume.  The  loans  were
past due when the pandemic began. (Tr. 46-49) Applicant has not contacted the creditor
to  establish  a  payment  plan  or  to  update  his  address.  He  is  unaware  of  the  monthly
amount he will be expected to pay. (Tr. 94-97)
SOR ¶ 1.h ($1,594) is a consumer account that has been charged off. (GE 3, GE
4,  GE  5)  The  debt  is  for  a  small  off-road  vehicle  that  Applicant  uses  for  hunting.  The
vehicle  was  repossessed,  and  then  he  reacquired  it  and  assumed  the  debt.  The  debt
was  settled  and  resolved  in  2021,  and  now  shows  a  zero  balance.  (Tr.  42-43,  86-91)
The  account  shows a charge-off  amount  of $403.  (GE 5 at 2) The same account now
lists a zero balance on a more recent credit report. (GE 6 at 3) This account is resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.i ($2,674) is a consumer account reported for collection by a bank. (GE
3,  GE  4,  GE  5)  Applicant  is  not  aware  of  an  account  with  this  bank  at  this  collection
agency. He will investigate the matter and if he can pay it, he will do so. (Tr. 43-44, 91)
SOR  ¶  1.j  ($1,726)  is a  past-due  consumer  account  that  has  been  reported  for
collection.  (GE  3,  GE  4,  GE  5)  Applicant  has  been  resolving  this  debt  with  regular
payments. (GE 6) At the time the record closed, he had about $1,000 left to pay, and he
expected  to  resolve  this  debt  by  September  2023.  (Tr.  29-30,  44-45,  93;  AE  A)  This
debt is being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.k ($6,187) is a consumer credit account that has been charged off by a
bank. (GE 5) A recent credit report now lists the account as $8,224 past due with a total
balance  of  $9,722.  (GE  6;  Tr.  93-94)  Applicant  has  contacted  the  creditor  and  was
informed that they want full payment, without a payment plan. He plans to take a loan
out  from  his  401k  pension  plan  to  address  the  debt,  however,  he  wants  to  address
smaller debts first. (Tr. 45-46)
SOR ¶ 1.p ($895 past due, $1,283 total balance) is a consumer account. (GE 4)
Applicant testified that the account has been paid. A recent credit report shows a zero
balance. (GE 6; Tr. 49-50, 97-98) This account is resolved.
Applicant  has  no  other  delinquent  debts  or  extravagant  expenses.  He  drives  a
truck with several hundred thousand miles on it. He took a trip to a European country in
fall  2021.  (Tr.  58-61,  71,  98-107,  121,  123-124)  He  does  not  keep  a  budget  but
recognizes  that  he  probably  should.  (Tr.  104)  He  said  he  intends  to  pay  his  past-due
taxes by May 2024 and will attempt to work out repayment of any remaining debts. (Tr.
108, 110)
Applicant asserted that he is not a security risk. He loves his job and the culture
of  the  company. He  is discreet about  what  he  does  at  work.  He tries  not  to incur new
debt. He has no alcohol-related driving offenses or traffic tickets and does not do drugs.
(Tr. 36, 58-64)
