Applicant  is  a  35-year-old  information  systems  security  officer  with  a  defense
contractor (Company A). He has worked for Company A since August 2019. He is single
with a partner and has a bachelor of science degree. He has held a security clearance
with various defense contractors almost continually since 2011. (Government Exhibit 1 at
Sections 12, 13A, 17, and 25; Tr. 20-21.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline H – Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because he has used illegal drugs. He admitted the single allegation under this paragraph
with explanations.
1.a. Applicant smoked marijuana during two distinct periods of time. He smoked
marijuana twice in approximately 2008 when he was in college. He derived no pleasure
from it and did not use it again for almost 13 years. He admitted this use during a 2015
investigation. (Government Exhibit 3 at Section 23; Government Exhibit 4; Tr. 19, 29.)
In 2021 Applicant began a relationship with his partner (Ms. One). Ms. One is a
cancer survivor who uses marijuana to relieve pain from her treatment. In approximately
June 2021, during the Covid pandemic, Applicant used marijuana about four times with
Ms. One. He supplied no good reason for using marijuana at this time, particularly given
the  fact  he  has  held  a  security  clearance  for  many  years.  He  admitted  this  use  in  an
August 2021 e-QIP and  a subsequent interview.  (Government Exhibit  1 at Section 23;
Government Exhibit 2; Tr. 22-23, 29, 32, 34-35, 37.)
Applicant has not used marijuana for two years. He states that he understands the
proscription against marijuana use while holding a security clearance, and has evinced a
credible intent not to use any illegal drugs in the future. He submitted a signed statement
of intent acknowledging that any future use of illegal drugs is grounds for revocation of
his security clearance. (Applicant Exhibit E; Tr. 26-28, 38.)
Mitigation
Applicant  is  a  successful  performer.  Positive  statements  were  submitted  by  his
manager, his Facility Security Officer, and his Industrial Security Representative. He is
described  by the  writers as “honest and  trustworthy,” “hard-working,” and  “a dedicated
and productive member of the [Company A] Cybersecurity team.” The writers stated they
are aware of Applicant’s marijuana use and believe this conduct to be an aberration that
is in the past. (Applicant Exhibits A, B, and D; Tr. 36-37.)
