Applicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since June 2022. He attended college for a period, but he has not
earned a degree. He is twice divorced. His first marriage ended in 2010 and his second
in 2020. He has two children, ages 24 and 18. (Tr. at 28-30, 34-35, 49-50; GE 1)
Applicant  worked for a defense  contractor from 2014  until  he  was terminated  in
November  2019.  His  company  provided  him  with  a  smart  phone  and  a  computer.  He
was permitted to use both for personal reasons, but he was not permitted to use them
for inappropriate  purposes,  including  viewing  and  downloading pornography.  Applicant
viewed pornography at his home  on the work laptop from about October to November
2019.  He  was  terminated  when  it  was  discovered.  (Tr.  at  28-30,  52-55;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 1, 2)
Applicant is remorseful for the conduct. He stated that it was his way of dealing
with a stressful divorce. He asserted that he has learned a valuable and costly lesson,
and  the  conduct  will  not  be  repeated.  His  current  employer  is  unaware  that  he  was
terminated  from  a  previous  job  for  viewing  pornography  on  his  work  computer.  (Tr.  at
53-57, 61-62; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2)
The   SOR  alleges   three   delinquent  debts  totaling   about  $48,670   (SOR  ¶¶   1.a-
1.c),  a   delinquent  $212   utility   bill  (SOR  ¶   1.d),  and   a   child   support  account  that   was
$2,781  past due  with  a  $3,022  balance  (SOR ¶  1.e).  Applicant admitted  owing  the  three
large  debts.  He  denied  owing  the  utility  debt. He admitted  owing  back  child  support, but
he  stated   that  he   was   making   payments.   (Tr.  at  39-44;  Applicant’s  response   to   SOR;
GE  2-6)
Applicant attributed  his  financial problems to  his  divorce  and unemployment  after
his  termination.  The   COVID-19   pandemic  hindered   his  efforts  to   find   another  job.  He
remained  unemployed  from   about November  2019  to  May  2021.  (Tr. at 28-32, 34,  36-
37; GE 1)
Applicant  did  not  discover  he  was  the  father  of  his  younger  child  until  she  was
about 11 years old. When the court awarded child support, it awarded about $46,000 in
arrearages.  Applicant paid about  $26,000  toward  the arrearages  from his  share  of the
equity in the family home, which was sold as part of the division of assets in his divorce.
His pay is being garnished for the child support and arrearages (SOR ¶ 1.e). Now that
his daughter  is  18, the  garnishment  will go completely to  the  arrearages. The balance
has been reduced from $3,053 on the January 2022 credit report, to $3,022 on the June
2022 credit report, to $1,492 on the July 2023 credit report. (Tr. at 30-31, 44-48; GE 1-6
Applicant denied owing the $212 utility debt (SOR ¶ 1.d). He stated that he never
had an account with that utility company. It is listed on all the credit reports in evidence.
(Tr. at 44; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-6)
Applicant has not made  any payments toward  the  three  large  debts. He planned
to   use   the   money  from   the   sale   of  the   marital   home   to   pay   his   debts,  but  that   money
went to  his child  support arrearages. He contacted  the  creditors in 2022  about  settling
the  debts, but his efforts were  unsuccessful. His finances  appear to  be  otherwise stable.
With  his  child  support  ending  in  the  near future, he  can  use  those  funds  toward paying
his delinquent debts.  He has not received  formal financial counseling. (Tr. at 31, 40, 49-
52, 57-58; GE 2-6)
Applicant  called  two  witnesses  who  attested  to  his  excellent  job  performance.
The  witnesses  praised  his  work  ethic,  judgment,  reliability,  responsibility,  leadership,
and trustworthiness. (Tr. at 12-27)
