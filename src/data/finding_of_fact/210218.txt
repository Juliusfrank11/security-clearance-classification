Applicant  used  marijuana  when  he  was  in  high  school.1  He  used  cocaine  and
ecstasy (3, 4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine or MDMA) on one occasion each. He
signed  the  contract  to  enlist  in  the military  in  about  August  2008, but  he  did  not  go  to
boot camp until April 2009. He submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions
(SF 86)  in  August 2008  as  part of  his enlistment  paperwork.  He  informed his recruiter
about his illegal drug use, but the recruiter told him not to report  it, and he did not. He
did not use any illegal drugs from the time he signed the contract until his discharge in
2014. (Tr. at 24-25, 55, 62-64)
Applicant used marijuana on about ten occasions from May 2016 through March
2020.  He  smoked  it,  vaped  it,  or  ate  it,  always  with  his  wife.  He  used  cocaine  on  two
occasions  in  May  2019.  He  and  his  wife  used  it  with  his  neighbor  who  provided  the
cocaine.  They  were  drinking  on  both  occasions.  Applicant  held  a  security  clearance
during  the  entire  period  of  his drug use  from 2016  through 2020.  From  about  October
2017  to  January  2019,  he  had  access  to  classified  information.  After  that,  he  held  a
security  clearance  but  did  not  have  access  to  classified  information.  (Tr.  at  20,  26-41,

Applicant self-reported his marijuana use to his security officer after he was hired
by  his  current  employer  in  June  2019.  He  wrote  that  he  last  used  marijuana  in
September 2018, with the following comment: “It was after that instance that 10 years of
guilt  and  secrets  were  bearing  down  on  me.  I  put  it  down  and  I  have  not  touched
marijuana or have any inclination to touch marijuana again.” (Tr. at 16, 44-49, 56; GE 3)
He added:
I was hired to work at [Employer] in June 2019. I knew that I would have to
declare that I have never, nor will I ever, use drugs prior to being allowed
into classified spaces. After 10 years of withholding the truth and keeping
this  secret,  I  could  not  bear  to  hold  it  any  longer. I  decided  to  self-report
and  disclose  my  past

indoctrination  briefing  that  would  allow  me  to  have  access  to  classified

material. I could not, in good consci[ence], betray the trust of [Employer] or
continue  living  with  this  secret.  I  believe  myself  to  be  an  honest  and
trustworthy man, but I could never live up to that if I continued to withhold
my previous drug use. (GE 3)
Applicant did not  report his cocaine use that occurred just  the month before his
statement.  He  wrote  in  the  statement  that  high  school  “was  the  last  time  [he]  used
cocaine.” He used marijuana about two to three times after he submitted the statement
to his security officer. He fully reported his illegal drug use on the SF 86 he submitted in
July 2021 and during his background interview in October 2021. He initially testified that
he had never used cocaine before the two recent times. He then admitted that he used
cocaine in high school. (Tr. at 37-38, 49-52; GE 1-3)
Applicant  has  not  used   any  illegal  drugs  since   he   last   smoked   marijuana   in
March 2020.  His wife  also  no  longer uses illegal drugs. The  friend  he  smoked  marijuana
with   stopped   using   marijuana,  and   the   neighbor  he   used   cocaine   with   moved   away.
Applicant  used  to  drink regularly.  In  about  November 2022,  he  and  his wife  decided  to
significantly  cut  down   on   their   drinking   and   concentrate   on   their  children   and   other
activities.  He  estimates that  he  has  had  a  total of  fewer  than  ten  drinks since  then.  He is
committed   to   remaining   drug   free.   He   realizes  that  he   made   poor  decisions  when   he
used  illegal drugs. He is willing  to  accept the  consequences of his conduct.  (Tr. at 16-
