Applicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security
clearance. Allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are incorporated
and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow.
Background
Applicant married  in December 2007, separated  in May 2013, and  later divorced.
(GE  1;  Tr.  34)  He  has  three   children   from   the   marriage.  Since   2020,   he   has   paid
monthly child  support to  his former spouse  of  between  $400  and  $500. (GE  1; Tr. 35-
36)     Applicant  remarried   in  October  2021.  He   earned   a   high   school  diploma   in   June
2009   and   attended   some   college   classes   between   May  2007   and   November   2013
without earning  a degree  or diploma. (GE 1) Applicant did not  report any military service
and  has never held a security clearance. (GEs 1-2)
Since  November  2014,  Applicant  has  worked  for his  current  defense  contractor
as a technical writer. (GE 1) Between May 2007 and November 2013, he worked as a
production artist for another employer. He reported unemployment between November
2013 and November 2014.
Applicant’s finances
Records document that Applicant did not timely file his federal and state income
tax returns, as required, for tax years 2015 and 2016. (GEs 1-2) Applicant could offer no
justifiable excuse for his failure to file his tax returns. (Tr. 39-40) His tax transcripts for
tax years 2015-2016 report no tax return filings. The payment plan he completed for tax
year 2014 covers only tax year 2014. (GE 2; Tr. 50-51)
Denying any past-due federal income taxes for tax years 2014, 2017, and 2019
in  his  response,  Applicant  claimed  unsuccessful  efforts  to  obtain  clarification  from  the
IRS  or  state  taxing  authority  about  any  reported  delinquent  balances  to  either  taxing
agency.  (Applicant’s  response;  (Tr.40-41)  Without  any  documentation  of  his  efforts  to
resolve his tax issues, no potentially favorable inferences can be drawn with respect to
federal taxes owing for tax years 2017 and 2019. Allegations of federal taxes owed for
tax year 2014 were withdrawn.
tax-filing
Besides   his
tax   delinquencies,  Applicant
lapses  and   accrued
accumulated  delinquent consumer and  medical debts exceeding  $1,500. (GEs 3-5) All
of these  alleged  debt  delinquencies  are listed  in the  documented  credit reports (GEs 3-
5)  and  are  neither  refuted   nor   credibly  challenged   by  Applicant   with   any  documented
submissions of his own. Most of the  creditors  that Applicant contacted  told him  only that
the  debts he  inquired  about were  previously charged  off. (Tr. 53-54) Only SOR creditor
1.d   expressed   any  willingness  to   work  with   Applicant  on   settling   its  debt   (for  $1,360).
(Tr. 53) However, this creditor never followed up with any   offer  to Applicant. (Tr. 53-54)
Applicant  has  not  documented  any  follow-up  contacts  he  had  with  any  of  the
consumer and medical creditors who may still be holding delinquent accounts belonging
to  him.  Absent  credible  evidence  from  Applicant  dispelling  the  information  covered  in
the  Government’s  credit  report  submissions,  presumptions  of  accuracy  that  typically
attach  to  credit  reports  compiled  by  reputable  credit  reporting  agencies  are  entitled  to
acceptance.
