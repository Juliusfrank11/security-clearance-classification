Applicant  admitted  the  three  SOR  allegations,  all  with  explanations.  His
admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review
of  the  pleadings  and  the  record  evidence,  I  make  the  following  additional  findings  of
fact.
Applicant  is  46  years  old.  He  has  several  years  of  college,  but  no  degree.  He
joined  the  Army  at  age  17,  and  served  from  1994  to  2016,  retiring  as  a  sergeant  first
class. He has held a clearance since joining the Army. (GE 1)
Applicant’s Army service  included several deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq,
among  other  overseas  assignments.  He  was  awarded  numerous  decorations  and
medals,  including  a  Bronze  Star,  four  Army  Commendation  Medals,  four  Army
Achievement Medals, multiple unit awards  including a Presidential Unit Citation, seven
Good Conduct medals, an Afghanistan Campaign Medal (two campaign stars), an Iraq
Campaign  Medal  (five  campaign  stars),  along  with  numerous  service  awards  and
badges. (AE D; Tr. 58-59)
After retiring from the Army, Applicant worked as a forklift driver for six months in
early 2017. He was then briefly unemployed before spending about two  years with his
next employer, from 2017 to 2019. He then worked for a federal contractor from March
2019  to  March  2020,  and  he  has  worked  for  his  current  employer  and  clearance
sponsor since  March 2020. He lives in State  1, but works in a  neighboring  state, State
2. (GE 1; AE K;  Tr.  8, 19-22, 27-30, 58)
Applicant was previously married from 2005 to 2016. The marriage produced two
daughters, ages  21  and  13.  He  has  a  12-year-old  daughter  from  another  relationship.
He  remarried  in  2016.  He  is  stepfather  to  his  wife’s  three  grown  children.  Two  of  his
children live with him. His wife owns a beauty salon and works for a major airline. (GE 1;
Tr. 18-19, 69-70)
The  SOR  alleges  Applicant’s  failure  to  file  federal  income  tax  returns  for  tax
years  (TY)  2012  and  2016  to  2019.  (SOR  ¶  1.a)  It  also  alleges  his  failure  to  file  state
income tax returns for TY 2016 to 2019. (SOR ¶ 1.b) It also alleges that he owes past-
due federal taxes of about $8,370 for TY 2020. (SOR ¶ 1.c).
On his security clearance application (SCA), Applicant disclosed several years of
unfiled  federal  income  tax  returns.  He  asserted  that  he  “didn’t  have  the  necessary
paperwork.”  He  noted  that  he  had  retained  a  financial  manager.  He  disclosed  other
debts,  most  notably  $29,000  in  past-due  child  support,  and  addressed  how  they  were
being  resolved.  (GE  1  at  46-50)  He  discussed  his  tax  issues  further  in  an  April  2021
background interview. (GE 2 at 10-11)
In a September 2021 interrogatory response about his taxes and debts, Applicant
provided federal income tax transcripts from the IRS, details about his state income tax
returns, along with general information about his financial status. This information, and
his prior disclosures on the SCA, largely establish the SOR allegations. (GE 1, GE 2 at
16, 18, 20, 24-27)
Applicant was deployed to a combat zone in Afghanistan from November 2012 to
the  fall  of  2013.  His  typical  practice  when  deployed  was  to  file  his  income  tax  returns
when he returned from deployment, but he failed to do so for TY 2012. (SOR ¶ 1.a, in
part) His return from this deployment was particularly difficult, as several of the soldiers
in his unit had been killed in combat and others committed suicide after returning home.
Applicant  said he  was focused on his own well-being  and that of his soldiers.  He  said
filing  his  income  tax  return  “just  slipped  my  mind.”  (Answer;  Tr.  24-26,  38-39,  42)  He
realized  that  his  TY  2012  income  tax  return  was  unfiled  while  responding  to  the
interrogatories. He filed the federal income tax return for TY 2012 in December 2021. It
reflects that he owed $562 (not including penalties and interest), which he subsequently
paid. (AE F, AE H, Tr. 26, 45-47, 65-66)
Applicant  also  failed  to  file  his  federal  and  state  income  tax  returns,  where
applicable, for TY 2016 to 2019. (SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c) In 2017, when his TY 2016 federal
income tax return was due, he was adjusting to civilian life after retiring from the Army.
He  was  also  pursing  suitable  civilian  employment,  and  he  had  many  out-of-state  VA
doctor visits that  year. This was  complicated by  the  fact that  his  disability  assessment
by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) was not completed until 2018. (Answer;
Tr. 28-29, 43-45, 66, 81) In 2017, he was also making a limited income of about $700
every  two  weeks,  which  was  several  thousand  dollars  less  than  he  had  earned  in  the
Army. He could not afford to pay the taxes he owed, and he chose to prioritize providing
for his family. (Tr. 30-32, 80) In 2018, his income improved as he worked as an aviation
inspector,  earning  about  $57,500.  In  2019,  he  began  working  for  a  government
contractor  and  earned  almost  $78,000.  (Tr.  32-33)  He  asserted,  however,  that  he  still
prioritized  providing  for his family  and  catching  up  on  unpaid bills  rather than focusing
on his tax issues. (Tr. 43-44)
Beginning in May 2020, Applicant consulted a financial counselor at his place of
employment,  for  assistance  in  rebuilding  his  credit,  repaying  his  creditors,  and  sorting
out his unfiled tax returns. He was advised to pay delinquent household debts and get
them  in order before addressing his tax  situation.  He  said  he  was  also  advised during
his background interview to resolve his delinquent debts as soon as possible, which he
did. (Answer; GE 3, GE 4, AE L; Tr. 33-35, 40-42, 67-69, 72-74, 78-80)
Applicant also retained a tax preparer to help address his late-filed returns. The
tax preparer filed his federal income tax returns for TY 2016 to 2019 in November 2021.
He filed his various state income tax returns in July 2021, with one earlier exception. All
returns  for  subsequent  tax  years  have  been  prepared  by  the  tax  preparation  firm.  (Tr.
36, 45; AE G, AE H, AE O)
For  TY  2016,  Applicant  owed  $1,437  in  federal  taxes,  which  he  subsequently
paid. (AE G, part i, AE H) From TY 2012 through TY 2016, Applicant was on active duty
and  his  “home  of  record”  was  in  State  3,  where  he  did  not  have  to  pay  state  income
taxes  or  file  a  state  income  tax  return,  even  though  he  was  stationed  elsewhere.  He
reported this in his interrogatory response, where he  wrote  “N/A” in reporting  the  state
income tax return filing status for those tax years. He also confirmed that information in
his  testimony.  (GE  2  at  18;  Tr.  54,  60-61)  This  evidence  is  sufficient  to  rebut  the
allegation of an unfiled state income tax return for TY 2016. (SOR ¶ 1.b, in part).
For TY 2017, Applicant owed $440 in federal taxes, which he subsequently paid.
(AE G, part ii, AE U) His TY 2017 State 1 income tax return reflects that he owed $826
(not including penalties and interest), which he subsequently paid. (AE G, part ii, AE O,
part i, AE V)
For  TY  2018,  Applicant  owed  $4,666  in  federal  taxes,  which  he  subsequently
paid. (AE G, part iii, AE  P, AE  T) His  TY 2018  State 1 income tax return,  filed  in  May
2022, reflects that he owed $2,639 (not including penalties and interest). (AE G, part iii,
AE O, part ii) He documented a payment of $1,065. (AE H, AE P; Tr. 46-50, 55-56)
For TY 2019, he owed $189 in federal taxes, which he subsequently paid. (AE G,
part iv, AE H, AE S) He said he did not pay penalties and interest for any of these past-
due income taxes and was  not aware  if  he had  to do so.  He paid what he thought he
owed. (Tr. 46-50)
Since early 2019, Applicant has been employed with contractors headquartered
in  State  2.  When  he  began  working  there,  he  would  work  in  State  2  during  the  week,
and  go  home  to  State  1  on  weekends.  The  COVID  pandemic  began  shortly  after  he
started  working  for  with  his  current  employer,  in  March  2020,  so  since  then  he  often
works from home (in State 1) or travels for work to remote sites. (Tr. 62-65) As a result
of his work in State 2, he has also been required to file a state income tax return there.
For TY 2019, Applicant’s State 1 and State 2 income tax returns were prepared
and  filed  by  his  tax  preparer  in  July  2023.  He  received  a  $170  refund  (not  including
penalties  and  interest)  from  State  2,  and  he  owed  $945  to  State  1,  which  he
subsequently paid. (AE H, AE O, part iii; AE W; Tr. 56-57)
Tax  filings  for  later tax years are  not  alleged in  the  SOR.  Applicant  filed  his TY
2020  federal  income  tax  return  on  or  about  August  16,  2021.  (GE  2  at  30)  He  owed
$8,370 in federal taxes for TY 2020. (SOR ¶ 1,c),but he paid the debt in full. (GE 2 at
17,  30,  38;  SOR  Ex.  2;  AE  M,  AE  N)  He  made  some  payments  before  the  SOR  was
issued. (SOR Ex. 2; Tr. 37-38, 50-51) After over $8,000 in payments in October 2021,
and  calculation  of  about  $100  in  penalties  and  interest,  he  received  a  $31  refund  in
August 2022. (AE X)
Applicant provided a TY 2020  income tax return for State 1. It is dated July 21,
2023, but it is unsigned and incomplete. No federal income, from which state income is
calculated, is reflected. (Tr. 37, 57-58; AE O, part iv) No State 2 income tax return for
TY 2020 was provided.
Applicant said he filed his TY 2021 federal income tax return in September 2022
by  mail.  He  estimated  that  he  owed  about  $3,400,  to  be  withdrawn  from  his  bank
account. He said the return was not accepted due to a dispute with his ex-wife over who
can  claim  their  eldest  daughter  as  a  dependent.  This  dispute  is  ongoing.  He  said  he
may have to pay an additional $1,200 or so and is able and willing to do so. (Tr. 51-54,
70, 77) Applicant’s TY 2021 State 2 income tax return was prepared by the tax service
in May 2022. It reflects a $1,966 refund. (AE O, part v; Tr. 37, 57-58)
Applicant  has  filed  his  TY  2022  federal  income  tax  return.  He  said  he  owed
$1,300 at  the  time  of the  hearing.  After the hearing,  he  documented  a  tax  payment of
$1,700 in July 2023. (Tr. 51-54, 77-78; AE Q)
As to his current budget, Applicant pays $658 in monthly child support for his 13-
year-old  daughter.  It  is  taken  out  of  his  retirement  pay.  His  child  support  requirement
decreased  by  half  when  his  older  daughter  graduated.  He  receives  about  $2,100  a
month  in  retirement  pay,  and about  $4,177 in  monthly VA  disability  compensation.  He
earns  an  estimated  $118,000  annual  salary.  He  keeps  an  informal  family  budget,  and
he has a monthly surplus of about $3,500 to $4,000. He has a 401k pension plan and
contributes  to  it.  (Tr.  71-75,  81;  GE  2  at  15;  AE  R)  His  current  credit  reports  show
financial stability and no significant delinquencies. (AE A, AE B, AE C)
Applicant  has  earned  exceptional  ratings  at  work  and  has  participated  in
appropriate professional training. (AE E, AE J) His character references provided strong
endorsements of his professionalism, judgment, trustworthiness, reliability, and eligibility
for a clearance. (AE I)
