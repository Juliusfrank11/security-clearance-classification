Applicant denied all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 59 years old. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 1993. He served in the
Army National Guard from 1984 until he was honorably discharged in 1999. He married
in 2001 and has children ages 21, 18, 14, and 11.
Applicant worked for a federal  contractor from April 2004 to December 2014. In
January 2015, he accepted a transfer due to his employer having funding issues. He took
a significant reduction in pay to maintain employment. His family did not move with him.
He  held  the  position  until  July  2015.  From  January  to  2015  to  August  2015,  he  was
supporting  two  households.  He  was  paying  the  mortgage  on  his  primary  home,  the
mortgage on rental property they owned, and rent where he was living. During this period,
his  tenants  left,  and  Applicant  was  no  longer  receiving  rental  income.  He  and  his  wife
began using credit cards and the balances became unmanageable. (Items 3, 4, 5)
From  2017 to 2019, Applicant began accumulating debt, and in 2018 he  began
missing payments. In 2019, he was proactive about resolving his debts. He established
payment plans, a budget, and participated in financial counseling. (Items 7, 8, 9)
Applicant  also  attributed  his  financial  problems  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  He
was hospitalized with the virus. His in-laws lived with their family from 2010 until 2022.
His father-in-law also contracted the virus and was hospitalized in 2020. He passed away
in the hospital in 2021. His daughter was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and her medical
treatment was several hours away. It took numerous medical and hospital visits before
she  was  properly  diagnosed  in  2020.  In  addition,  his  wife  was  laid  off  from  her  job.
Applicant was also diagnosed with blood cancer upon his return from his military service
in Iraq. His medical condition is debilitating and impacts his daily life. (Item 3, AE 1, 3, 4)
The  SOR  alleges  seven  delinquent  credit  card  or  consumer  accounts  totaling
approximately  $87,832.  It  also  alleges  a  foreclosed  mortgage  on  a  timeshare  with  a
remaining balance of $56,375. Finally, it alleges he is indebted to the federal government
for delinquent taxes in the amount of approximately $5,000 for tax year 2018.
SOR  ¶  1.a  is  the  alleged  tax  debt.  In  January  2022,  Applicant  responded  to
government interrogatories, and he disclosed that that he owed income taxes for tax year
2018. In his answer to the SOR, he disputed that he owed a tax debt. He provided a copy
of  his 2018 tax transcripts,  which shows a zero-balance owed. A refund  from tax year
2018 was applied to a 2017 tax debt, and he received the balance of the refund. He also
provided copies of his 2019 and 2020 tax transcripts that shows he owes 15 cents and
$1.82, respectively. It is noted that according to the transcripts, he failed to timely file his
tax returns for both years. He filed his 2019 and his 2020 income tax returns in August
2022,  after  receiving the  SOR.  His  failure to timely file  his income tax  returns  was not
alleged in the SOR. (Item 3-Exhibit 12; AE 4)
Any derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will not be considered
for  disqualifying  purposes,  but  may  be  considered  when  applying  the  mitigating
conditions, in making a credibility determination, and in a whole-person analysis.
In July 2019, Applicant enrolled in a debt solution program (GH), which provided
financial  counseling  and  worked  with  him  to  establish  a  budget.  He  began  making
payments  to  GH  in  August  2019.  In  December  2019,  he  enrolled  in  another  credit
assistance  program  (CAN),  which  provided  him  additional  financial  counseling  and
assistance in paying off his debts. (Item 4-enclosures 7, 8, 9
SOR ¶ 1.b ($19,021) is a judgment filed in 2020 for a credit-card debt. Applicant
made payment arrangements with the creditor in early 2019 and was making payments
through GH. He made the payments until the debt was paid in full in December 2020, and
the debt is resolved. (Item 4-enclosure 13)
SOR  ¶  1.c  ($4,931)  is   a   charged-off   credit  card.  Applicant  settled   and   paid  the
agreed   upon   amount   of  $1,900   in  November  2020.  The   debt  is  resolved.  (Item   4-
enclosure 14)
SOR ¶ 1.d ($33,598) is a charged-off debt. A consent judgment was filed by both
parties and a payoff settlement with the creditor for $16,800 was accepted in March 2022.
Applicant made monthly payments of $467 and paid the remaining settlement balance in
May 2023. The debt is resolved. (Item 4-enclosure 15; AE 5)
SOR ¶ 1.e ($1,215) is a charged-off credit card. Through DAN, Applicant reached
a  settlement  agreement  with  the  creditor  in  August  2022  and  paid  the  agreed  upon
amount ($642). The debt is resolved. (Item 4-enclosure 16)
SOR ¶ 1.f  ($25,130) is  a  charged-off  account. Applicant reached  a  joint settlement
agreement  with   the   creditor  in  March   2021   agreeing   to   a   payoff   balance   of   $15,000.
Applicant  made   consistent   monthly  payments  until  August   2022   and   made   a   final
payment  in  March  2022   of  $12,250   to   satisfy  the   debt.   The   debt  is  resolved.  (Item   4-
enclosure 17, 18; AE 8)
SOR ¶ 1.g ($2,333) is a charged-off account. Applicant settled and paid the debt
in June 2022 for $1,155. The debt is resolved. (Item 4-enclosure 19)
SOR  ¶  1.h  ($1,604)  is  a  charged-off  account.  GH  negotiated  a  settlement
agreement. Applicant completed the terms of the payment agreement in August 2022 and
resolved the debt. (Item 4-enclosures 8 and 20; AE 9)
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.i ($56,375) is alleged as a foreclosure on a timeshare. In his
answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  disputed  the  property  was  foreclosed.  He  purchased  a
timeshare  from  HIC  in  2008  and  made  payments  until  sometime  in  2018  when  his
financial issues became overwhelming. He admits he did not understand the timeshare
process when he purchased it or how his costs continued to increase. There is a process
where  a  timeshare  may  be  “traded-in”  for  another.  In  2010,  Applicant  “traded  in”  his
timeshare for another and in 2011 he again “traded-in” the timeshare. He did this again
in 2015 and 2017. Apparently, the “trade-in” process is used to leverage use of other HIC
vacation properties across the country and is also another way to increase owner costs.
Each time one wants to use a property in another location, they would have to trade in
through the exchange process which increased the costs, which was never mentioned by
HIC. (Response to FORM)
HIC refused to engage in any dialogue with Applicant regarding his property. HIC
cancelled and charged off the timeshare in September 2018 and foreclosed in February
2020. Applicant was never notified the property was foreclosed until May 2023, which is
why he denied the property was foreclosed in his SOR answer. It took more than a year
of  multiple  phone  calls  and  emails  to  HIC  before  it  acknowledged  the  foreclosure.
Applicant’s attorney engaged HIC and it could not produce evidence that Applicant had
been notified of the foreclosure. Applicant had attempted to surrender the property over
several years and HIC never mentioned to him the account was closed and the property
foreclosed. HIC is the subject of multiple complaints through the Better Business Bureau
related to predatory practices. (Item 4; AE 10, 11)
Applicant recently participated  in  another financial counseling  course. He  provided
numerous  letters  reflecting   his  outstanding   character  and   ability  to   protect  classified
information,   and   asserting   he   is  not   a   threat   to   national  security.   He  is  described   as
diligent,   honest,   reliable,  and   loyal.  He  is  a   person   who   exercises   good   judgment  and
integrity.  He is devoted  to  his church and  volunteers his time  and  talents to  the  community.
He is a trusted  employee with the highest personal and professional standards.   (Item 2-
enclosure  3, 4,5, 6, 10;  AE 2)
