when he worked for a private company as a principal engineer until approximately 2021.
He  also  received  an  offer  of  employment  from  a  DOD  contractor  in  July  2019,
contingent  on  obtaining  a  security  clearance.  As  of  the  date  of  the  hearing  and  since
approximately 2021, he has worked for another private company. He has never held a

Before  becoming  a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen  in  2016,  Applicant  was  issued
Pakistani  passports  in  2003  and  2009,  which  expired  in  2008  and  2014,  respectively.
He  was  also  issued  a  temporary  Pakistani  passport  in  approximately  2008,  which
expired in 2009. He used his 2003 Pakistani passport to  travel to Pakistan in 2005, to
attend his siblings’ weddings. While in Pakistan, he and his first spouse divorced. He did
not use his 2008 or 2009 Pakistani passports to travel. He was issued a U.S. passport

In  1991,  Applicant  joined  the  Pakistani  military  to  pursue  a  college  education.
The Pakistani military covered the cost of his undergraduate tuition, provided him with a
living  stipend,  and  paid  him  a  salary.  In  return,  he  was  required  to  fulfill  a  six-year
commitment  upon  graduation.  After  obtaining  his  bachelor’s  degree  in  1994,  he
completed  military  training  and  was  commissioned  as  a  captain  in  1995.  He  also
unsuccessfully  attempted,  beginning  in  1994  and  then  every  two  to  three  years,  to
resign  from  the  Pakistani  military.  In  2003,  the  Pakistani  government  awarded  him  a
scholarship to pursue his master’s and doctorate degrees in the United States. In return,
he was required to work in Pakistan for two years. When he moved to the United States
to pursue higher education, the Pakistani military placed him on “five-year study leave”
and continued to pay him a salary. (SOR ¶ 1.f; Tr. at 27-29, 31-32, 37-57, 119-125, 134;
GE 1-2; AE A, C, D, E)
In  2008,  the  Pakistani  military  informed  Applicant  that  he  needed  to  return  to
Pakistan.  He  chose  to  remain  in  the  United  States  to  complete  his  doctorate  degree,
and the Pakistani military consequently marked him as overstaying his leave. It ceased
communication  with  him  and  terminated  his military pay. He  sent  resignation  letters  to
the  Pakistani military  in  2008, 2010,  and 2012,  but  received no  response.  In 2021, he
returned  to  Pakistan  and  paid  the  Pakistani  government  $12,000  USD  for  the  military
salary  he  received  while  studying  in  the  United  States  between  2003  and  2008.  The
Pakistani  military  consequently  accepted  his  resignation.  He  also  renounced  his
Pakistani  citizenship  and  received  a  certificate  of  renunciation  from  the  Pakistani
government in 2022. (Tr. at 27-29, 31-32, 37-57, 119-125, 134; GE 1-2; AE A, C, D, E)

former  spouse  was  awarded  sole  custody  of  this  child  “per  Pakistan,  Islamic  rulings.”
Since then, Applicant has paid $100 USD monthly in child support to his former spouse,
through his father. Applicant expects to continue paying child support for this child until
this child gets married. During his September 2019 background interview, he indicated
that this child was a student in Pakistan, but he could not provide any further information
because he did not have any contact with this child. He testified that despite his efforts
to stay in touch with this child, his former spouse and relatives made it difficult, and so
he  eventually  ceased  contact  in  approximately  2014.  (Tr.  at  31,  58-62,  109-118,  126;

nephew)  who lives  in  the  United States, as further discussed  below.  Applicant  talks to
his  younger  sister  once  yearly  and  on  special  occasions.  He  saw  one  of  his  sisters
when  he  traveled  to  Pakistan  in  2021.  He  last  spoke  to  his  older  brother  in
approximately  2020  or  2021,  and  he  speaks  to  his  younger  brother  on  special
occasions.   He   does   not  have   contact  with   the   husband   of  his  older  sister.  He  met   his

seeking   a   security  clearance.   He  stated   that   he   told   his  father  in  2019   simply  that   he
was undergoing  a  background  investigation. His family is aware  that he  is an  engineer.

Pakistan  were contacted  by anyone  seeking  information  about him.  (Tr. at  84-86, 131-

embassy. (SOR ¶ 1.h) His initial contact with the representative occurred at a Pakistani-
American  community  and  youth  convention  in  the  United  States.  He  had  subsequent
contact  with  the  representative  for  the  purpose  of  finding  academic  coordination

wife,  and  this  is  where  I  will  be  buried.  If  I  must  continue  fighting  to  prove  that  I  have
only one home, the USA, I will continue fighting.” (Tr. at 30, 32-33, 48, 94-100, 127-131;
