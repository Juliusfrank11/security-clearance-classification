Applicant is 40 years old. He and his wife of 18 years have two children, ages 14
and 15. He received his high school diploma in 2001. He took some college courses in
2019, without earning a degree. He served honorably in the U.S. Marine Corps from June
2001,  until  his  early  retirement  in  December  2018.  He  remained  unemployed  until
September 2019, when he began working as a contractor for another government agency
through March 2020. He has been employed by his current sponsor since March 2020,
initially  through  a  staffing  agency,  and  then  as  a  direct  full-time  employee  since
September 2020. Throughout his military and civilian career, he has worked in finance-
related  positions.  However,  he  does  not  consider  himself  a  “financial  expert”  because
none of those positions involved managing personal finances. (AE A; GE 2; GE 8 at 2, 8;
Tr. at 9-10, 36, 38-39, 64, 83, 90, 104-105)
Military Career
Applicant enlisted  in the  Marine  Corps,  at age  17,  and  went  to  boot  camp,  at age
18. He deployed  to  Iraq  in 2004,  at age  20, and  to  Afghanistan  in  2005,  at age  21. He
was commissioned  as a Chief Warrant Officer  (CWO) in  2011,  at  age 28. He retired as  a
CWO2,   at   age   35.  He   attributed   combat-related  post-traumatic  stress  disorder (PTSD)
with  ending  his Marine  Corps career “sooner than  [he] wanted  to.”  In  2015, he  underwent
“extensive   therapy”  to   address   his  PTSD.   He  described   the   nine-month   period   of
unemployment following  his Marine  Corps retirement  as “a  pretty rough  chapter” in his
life,  due   to   his  continued   struggles   with   PTSD.  Although   PTSD   still   affects  him   “every
day,” he  has  learned  tools to  manage  it and  is in a  “better place”  today. He is currently
under medical care for PTSD-related  prescription  management. He is  open  with  his family
and   employers  about   his  PTSD  struggles  and   has  availed   himself  of  the   resources
available  through   his  current  employer,  who   has  supported   him   in  navigating   those
resources. (AE 8  at 9; Tr. at 9,  63,  91-94, 97,  106)
Security Clearance
Applicant has maintained a security clearance since 2005. While on active duty in
the  Marine  Corps,  he  submitted  the  2018  EQIP  for  the  periodic  reinvestigation  of  his
clearance  eligibility.  During  the  ensuing  background  investigation,  he  was  interviewed
about the same 14 delinquent credit-card and loan debts that were later alleged in the
SOR, which he had disclosed in the 2018 EQIP. During the interview, he proffered a plan
to  resolve  his  delinquent  debts  by  filing  bankruptcy.  In  April  2019,  the  CAF  favorably
adjudicated  his  clearance  eligibility  continuing  his  access  to  classified  information.  He
submitted the 2021 EQIP to upgrade his security clearance. (GE 8 at 3; Tr. at 10, 41-42,
127)
SOR Allegations
The  SOR  alleged  13  delinquent  debts,  including  credit-card  and  loan  accounts
totaling $71,099, and a mortgage loan foreclosure. Applicant had disclosed the alleged
debts and the foreclosure in the 2021 EQIP. In his Answer, he admitted all 14 allegations,
which were also confirmed by his 2018 and 2019 credit bureau reports (CBRs). His 2021,
2022, and 2023 CBRs confirmed all but one debt, SOR ¶ 1.n. (GE 3-7)
Applicant’s  delinquent  debts  arose  between  about  2016  and  2018,  when  his
finances became overextended due to a combination of factors, including extraordinary
expenses, unemployment, and his PTSD struggles. His finances were initially strained by
a $1,500 legal fee he paid to successfully defend a reckless driving charge. Concurrently,
a  rental property he  owned  fell into  disrepair  due  to  “a  couple  of sets  of  bad  tenants.”
These factors had a ripple effect because of his history of overspending with credit cards
between  about  2005  and  2015.  He  struggled  to  keep  up  with  his  monthly  payment
obligations, resulting in what he described as a juggling act where he missed credit-card
payments to pay the legal fee, and then missed mortgage payments to make his credit-
card payments. Eventually, he defaulted on the debts and mortgage loan alleged in the
SOR and four other credit cards, which were not alleged in the SOR because they were
solely  in  his  wife’s  name.  He  accepted  responsibility  for  paying  the  unalleged  debts
because he incurred them with his wife. (GE 1, 2, 8; Tr. at 27, 46-48, 51-58, 91-94, 107)
Between 2016 and 2018, Applicant consulted with two attorneys for advice about
his financial situation. They advised him to file bankruptcy and to stop making his monthly
credit-card  payments.  The  payments  he  missed  while  contemplating  whether  to  file
further exacerbated his financial problems. Ultimately, he chose not to file because he
considered  bankruptcy  as an  “easy way” out  and  did not want to  “just walk away from
everything.”  Instead,  he  intended  to  find  a  way  to  repay  his  debts  within  his  available
means. In early 2019, he cashed out his Marine Corps retirement account, from which he
netted about $20,000 after taxes. He applied those funds toward resolving the unalleged
debts, maintaining his household expenses while he was unemployed, and “put[ing] out
a few . . . fires”. (GE 1 at 37; GE 2 at 43; GE 8 at 3, 10-12; Tr. 49-50, 89-90, 108-109,
122)
The  foreclosure  involved  the  first  home  Applicant  and  his  wife  purchased  as  a
married couple in 2006. The home became a rental property when they moved to another
state in 2011. He had missed about six to ten months of mortgage payments when the
lender  initiated  foreclosure  proceedings.  He  was  unable  to  sell  the  home  because  the
mortgage loan balance exceeded its fair market value, which never recovered from a 40
percent loss suffered during the 2008 financial crisis. Despite his attempts to rehabilitate
the mortgage loan by making monthly payments of about $1,000 (which was $300 over
the  original  payment  amount)  for  an  unspecified  period,  the  lender  foreclosed  on  the
home in about October or November 2018. He did not owe a deficiency balance on the
mortgage loan after the foreclosure. (GE 8 at 4, 12; Tr. at 51-57, 125-126)
Several  other  specific  factors  contributed  to  Applicant’s  missed  mortgage
payments  besides  his  generally  overextended  finances.  He  was  unaware  that  his
mortgage  loan  had  been  transferred  to  a  new  service  provider,  which  resulted  in  his
monthly payment no longer being automatically debited from his account. By the time he
learned of the problem, he was unable to pay in full the past-due balance of about $2,000,
and the new service provider refused to accept an alternative payment plan. At the same
time,  the  rental  property  required  costly  repairs.  He  paid  unspecified  costs  to  replace
carpets, a water heater, and “a bunch of [other] stuff.” Through the process of applying
for a personal loan to help pay for additional repairs, which he could not afford, Applicant
and  his  wife  were  surprised  to  learn  that  they  were  unable  to  qualify  due  to  an
unacceptable debt-to-income ratio. (GE 8 at 4, 12; Tr. at 51-57)
Until  that  point,  Applicant  and  his  wife  neither  realized  how  overextended  their
credit had become nor understood the consequences of overusing credit cards. He and
his wife “both had bad spending habits,” not due to buying “luxury items,” but to failing to
“budget  properly,”  and  using  credit  cards  “improperly.”  Because  he  witnessed  his  wife
opening and using credit cards for the perks, he followed suit. He and his wife also opened
new credit accounts to transfer balances. He was never educated on credit-card use. He
grew up in a very poor rural area. His father had a low paying job and his mother did not
work outside the home. He observed his father use credit cards to make ends meet. He
stated, “This seemed normal to me, and I had no concept of a budget, or the pitfalls of
over-extended credit card use.” He added, “I was just really financially illiterate, looking
back on it.”  (GE 8 at 12; Tr. at 47-48, 50-57)
Financial Counseling
Applicant  has  not  had  any  formal  financial  counseling.  He  did  not  consider  the
information he received from the bankruptcy lawyers as such. However, he and his wife
have  “done  a  lot  of  stuff  together”  to  try  to  educate  themselves  about  better managing
their finances. They opened an account with a credit bureau agency to help them “closely
monitor” their credit. They read articles from that agency as well as other sources on how
to improve their credit, which is what led them to opening credit cards for credit-rebuilding
purposes. They “are both on the same page” and “are communicating better” about their
finances, which was not the case in the past. (Tr. at 69-72, 80-81)
By  improving  their  financial  literacy,  Applicant  and  his  wife  have  been  able  to
reduce  their  spending,  limit  their  credit-card  use,  increase  their  savings,  rebuild  their
credit, and repay their delinquent debts. During Applicant’s May 2021 security clearance
interview (2021 Interview), he described the changes he and his wife made in managing
their  finances  and  using  credit.  They  were  saving  about  $300  per  month  and  relying
primarily on cash to pay expenses. He categorized their financial situation as good and
finances healthy, which would afford him the ability to continue repaying his debts. At the
hearing, he reaffirmed that he and his wife managed their finances by using cash and
“absolutely stopped” overusing  credit cards.  They developed a budget with the goal of
keeping their fixed expenses to under 50 percent of their income and then using the other
50 percent “to live on,” accumulate savings, and pay debts. They had been successfully
operating within their budget by paying all current bills on the first of the month, except
for the phone bill on the 17th of each month, and then setting aside $400 each month for
savings. (GE 8 at 8-12; Tr. at 69-72, 81-82)
Financial Information
Applicant is the primary wage earner for his family. He estimated that his annual
salary and benefits totaled between about $70,000 and $90,000 when he retired from the
Marine Corps in December 2018. His annual salary was $90,000 from September 2019
through March 2020, and was $110,000 from March 2020 until September 2020, when it
decreased  to  $105,000.  Due  to  cost-of-living  raises  “and  such,”  his  annual  salary  had
increased to $117,000 as of the hearing. Since February 2019, he has received additional
annual income of about $50,400 for his U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs 100 percent
disability pay, and about $30,600 for his Marine Corps retirement pay. (Tr. at 38-41, 63)
Applicant’s  wife  has  been  employed  throughout  their  marriage,  primarily  as  a
dental technician, but also in retail. However, she “had to job-hop at lot” due to Applicant’s
changing duty stations. Her annual salary historically averaged between about $30,000
and $35,000. About a year and half prior to the hearing, she decided to switch careers to
pursue her passion of becoming a nurse and to increase her income. While waiting to
begin nursing school in the fall of 2023, she has been working as a substitute teacher,
which reduced her annual salary to about $20,000. (Tr. at 36-37, 103-104)
Applicant  attributed  his  “newly  blossoming”  financial  condition  to  his  increased
income, as demonstrated by the growth in his financial assets. In July 2021, his assets
included his $10,088 retirement account, $1,050 employee stock purchase plan (ESPP),
a $2,922 investment holding, and his wife’s $17,776 retirement account. At the hearing,
his retirement account, ESPP, and investment holding increased to $30,000, $3,000, and
$3,500,  respectively.  His  savings  and  checking  accounts  had  a  combined  balance  of
$4,000. (AE E; Tr. at 32-33, 66-67)
Applicant did not proffer a budget of his monthly expenses, but he testified about
some of them, and explained generally, “we don’t have much  free money” after paying
for  “living  expenses”  and  “the  essentials  of  everyday  life.”  He  was  doing  his  best  to
manage the “not cheap” expenses associated with his children’s school sports and travel
soccer. Sometime during the COVID-19 pandemic, he financed a trip to Disney World, at
a  total cost of about  $2,000  or $3,000,  without using  a  credit card. He was only able  to
afford   the   trip   because   he   found   “crazy  cheap” flights  and   used  his military benefits to
save on hotel accommodations. (Tr. at 67-68, 85-86, 111-112).
As of January 2022, he was current with the $2,400 monthly rental payment on his
primary residence, which he later purchased from the owner in April 2022, financed with
a  $515,800  mortgage  loan.  He  attributed  his  ability  to  purchase  the  home  to
improvements in his credit score. In October 2022, he took out a $30,000 personal loan
to consolidate two smaller personal loans opened in 2021 to timely pay tax year 2020 and
2021 federal income taxes totaling about $12,000. The total original balance of the two
2021 loans was about $24,000. He used funds from the October 2022 loan to make a
$19,000 lump-sum payment to satisfy the two 2021 loans. The record did indicate how
he used the other $12,000 from the two 2021 loans, or the other $11,000 from the October
2022 loan. In February 2023, he opened a retail credit-card account to make a $377 home
improvement purchase, and to avail himself of the “zero [percent interest] for six [months]”
promotional offer. While acknowledging that being “enticed” by these types of offers got
him into “trouble” in the past, he maintained that he is better able to manage repayment
of the credit cards to avoid future default. He stated,
I'm  not  going  to  say [sic] not using  credit cards because  we  are,  but [sic] not
using   credit  cards  as actual credit  cards   because   [sic] don't  extend   them
past,  you  know, basically we  use  them  as charge  cards I guess you  would
say  . . . [and] to  rebuild  credit specifically. (GE 7  at 8, 11-12, 14; GE  8  at 12;
Tr. at  45-46, 56, 64-66, 70-71,74-76, 79-81).
The 2020 and 2021 tax bills were “unexpected” expenses because they were the
first and only tax years that Applicant has owed taxes. He later learned that he incurred
the  taxes  because  he  failed  to  properly  adjust  his  withholdings.  He  received  a  $4,500
federal income tax  refund in  May 2023, after  properly adjusting his  withholdings in  tax
year 2022. He used $1,000 of his 2022 tax refund to pay his current credit-card accounts,
$2,000 toward the remaining balance of a $2,700 new couch he previously purchased,
and  then  saved  about  $1,500.  He  intended  to  apply  the  $1,500  toward  repaying  his
delinquent debts. He considered replacing a “very, very old” couch to be a necessity and
not an extravagant expense. He “didn’t buy a fancy couch” to keep the cost down. (Tr. at
74-79, 112-113, 114)
All  accounts  were  reported  in  good  standing  on  Applicant’s  May  2023  CBR.
Although he continued to rely on credit cards to meet expenses, he was current with his
monthly payments and had not incurred any delinquent debts beyond those alleged in the
SOR.  Besides  the  retail  card  referenced  above,  he  actively  uses  only  two  other  credit
cards (opened in July and October 2022 to rebuild credit) on which he pays the balances
in full each month. He carries balances on seven other credit cards, including the retail
card  mentioned  above  and  six  credit-card  accounts  that  he  opened  between  October
2019 and March 2021. The balances of those seven cards ranged from $3 to $1,882 and
totaled $3,782. He made monthly payments well above the minimum due on the higher-
balance  cards.  He  has  three  vehicle  loans  with  balances  of  $7,689,  $11,736,  and
$25,883, on which he pays monthly $444, $450, and $640, respectively. He pays $793
and $2,680 per month on the personal and mortgage loans, respectively, with reported
balances of $28,583 and $507,650, respectively. (GE 7; Tr. at 70-74)
Debt Repayment Plan
Applicant’s  debt  repayment  plan  has  continued  to  evolve  since  he  became
gainfully employed in 2018 and throughout the security clearance process. He believes
that his decision not to file bankruptcy demonstrates his commitment to resolving all his
delinquent debts  within his available means. During the 2021 Interview, he anticipated
that he could fully resolve all debts by 2026 by first paying the smaller debts (which he
defined as anything under $3,200) within two to three years, and then the larger debts
within  five  years.  In  his  Answer,  he  promised  to  continue  making  payments  toward
resolving the debts “for as long as it takes to make [his creditors] whole.” (AE H at 1; GE
2 at 43; GE 8 at 12; Tr. at 25-26, 44-45, 58-60, 84-85, 87-88, 95-98, 108, 121-123)
At the  hearing, Applicant explained  that he  chose  to  prioritize  resolving  three  of the
unalleged   debts  first  because   they   were   the   subject   of  civil  lawsuits  brought  by   the
creditors against  his wife. He next planned  to  pay the  credit-card debt alleged  in SOR ¶
1.a. ($2,245), which  he  considered  “most pressing” since  it was in “actual collection  and
not a  charge-off.” Then, he  planned  to  negotiate  a  monthly repayment plan  to  resolve the
two   debts  with   the   same   creditor   (the   bank  he  used   his  “entire  adult  life”),  SOR  ¶  1.b
($16,504) and  the  fourth  unalleged  debt  ($6,500). Next,  he  planned  to  begin  working  with
his  other   creditors   to   resolve  the   remaining   SOR   debts,   in   no   specific  order.   He   also
indicated  an  interest  in  undergoing  formal financial counseling.  (AE  H at  1;  GE  2  at  43;
GE 8  at 12; Tr. at 25-26, 44-45, 58-60, 84-85, 87-88, 95-98, 108, 121-123)
Applicant explained that the pace of his debt resolution has been “slow” due to his
limited available means. As of the hearing, he could not afford to pay more than the $150
he had been paying towards the second unalleged debt. However, he anticipated that, as
he continues to pay down his debts, and his and his wife’s income increases, he would
be able to incrementally increase the amount he pays monthly toward his debts. He was
close to paying off a credit card on which he has been paying $200 monthly. Once that
$200 is freed up, he planned to use it to make monthly payments  toward another debt.
He believed that if he continued this approach, it would “snowball” over time and afford
him  the  ability  to  pay  more  and  more  hundreds  of  dollars  each  month  toward  fully
resolving all his delinquent debts. (Tr. at 25-26, 61-62, 67-68, 89-90, 110-111)
In  Applicant’s  July  2023  post-hearing  submission,  he  expressed  an  intent  to
“accelerate” his efforts  to  resolve the  SOR debts.  He anticipated  that  he could resolve
SOR  ¶  1.a  “within  the  next  two  months.”  Then,  he  would  begin  paying  $300  a  month
toward resolving the remaining debts “one at a time in order of amount to systematically
satisfy them.” (AE H at 1)
To date, Applicant has made payments totaling $23,865  to his creditors. In July
2018, he made a $3,912 lump-sum payment to resolve one unalleged debt. In May 2019,
he negotiated a monthly repayment plan to resolve a second unalleged debt, on which
he remained current through June 2023, when it was paid in full. Pursuant to that plan,
his one-time  $155  payment  in  May  2019,  and  subsequent  monthly payments  of  $150,
totaled $7,505. In about April 2020, he made a $10,303 lump-sum payment to resolve a
third  unalleged  debt.  He  originally  budgeted  to  pay  the  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.a  on
October  1,  2023;  however,  he  was  able  to  make  a  $2,145  lump-sum  payment  on
September 28, 2023 because he received his paycheck earlier than expected. (AE D, H,
I; GE 2 at 43; GE 7 at 10, 12; Tr. 25-27, 31, 44-45, 60-62, 84-85)
Whole-Person Concept
Applicant’s  “entire  life  has  been  in  service  to  the  country.”  The  Marine  Corps
recognized his exemplary performance in August and September 2005, March and June
2007, and March 2009. His Defense Department (DD) Form 214 referenced numerous
commendations  and  awards.  Since  February  2023,  he  and  his  wife  have  financially
sponsored seven children in poverty through a charity organization, at a total cost of about
$266 per month. He believes that “it is important to give some of [his “great income”] back
to people that don’t have it, especially considering . . . I’ve kind of misused some of it in
the past.” He stated, “the driving factor is just trying to give some of our bounty to others
instead of . . . spend[ing] . . . it improperly ourselves.” He and his wife also regularly tithe
to their church in an unspecified amount he stated was “not the full 10 percent.” (AE A, B,
C; Tr. at 85-86, 115)
Applicant acknowledged that, at times, he prioritized spending for his children over
the repayment of his debts to ensure their happiness and well-being and to prevent them
from suffering or sacrificing for his financial and mental health struggles.  He has never
tried to “shirk” his responsibility to repay his delinquent debts. He believed that his debt
repayment strategy has honored both his obligation to repay his debts and his obligation
to  avoid  causing  his  family  undue  hardship.  In  hindsight,  he  recognized  that,  from  a
security clearance perspective, he may have been better served by repaying his debts
“more aggressively.” He further stated,
I'm   not  saying   I  have   done   that  100   percent  or   perfectly.  But  it   is  not
something  that  ever went  away  nor is  it something  that  I  won't address in
the  future.  As a matter of fact, I  am  thinking  of ways right now I  could  have
done  this better and  ways I  can  do  it better  already, you  know, regardless
of whatever happens here.  (Tr. at 95-99, 111-112,  121-123)
