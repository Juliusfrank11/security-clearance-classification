Applicant admitted all the allegations in  SOR.  During the  course of  the hearing,
the Government withdrew allegation 1.f. (TR at page 20 line 10 to 21 line 14, at page 28
lines 13~16, at page 29 line 10 to page 30 line 15, and at page 40 lines 12~18.) After a
thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  testimony,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  64-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed  with  the  defense  contractor  since  June  of  2005.  He  has  held  a  security
clearance since 2008. Applicant has a Ph.D. from an American university. He is married
to a U.S. citizen, and has two adult U.S.-born, children.  (TR at page 16 lines 4~14, at
page 17 line 18 to page 20 line 9, at page 35 line 11 to page 37 line 16, and GX 1 at
pages 5, 12, 16~17, 21~22 and 35~36.)

Taiwanese  Army  from  about  1984  to  about  June  1986,  more  than  27  years  ago.  His
military service was mandatory. (TR at page 16 line 15 to page 17 line 17, and GX 1 at
page 14.)

farmers. His father is 94 years old, and his mother is 84 years old. Applicant has nearly
daily contact with his parents by “video phone.” They are unaware of, and uninterested
in, any details about Applicant’s employment. (TR at page 27 line 11 to page 28 line 12,

Notice
I  take administrative  notice  of  the  following  facts  regarding  Taiwan:  Taiwan  is a
democracy led by a president and parliament selected in multiparty elections. The U.S.
approach to Taiwan has remained  consistent across decades and administrations. We
do not support Taiwan independence, but expect cross-Strait differences to be resolved
by  peaceful  means.  In  recent  years  there  have  been  multiple  cases  involving  illegal
export  of  U.S.  restricted  dual-use  or  military  technology  to  Taiwan  or  by  Taiwanese
nationals and companies.
