about  1996 until his  last  usage  in  about  July of  2015.  In  2015,  about  eight  years ago,
Applicant  found  out  that  he  had  a  “heart  disease;”  and  as  a  result,  stopped  using
marijuana. (TR at page 16 line 4 to page 17 line 22.)

Account” by two payments: $1,000 in April of 2022, and $4,074 in August of 2023. This
is  evidenced  by  a  document  from  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS).  (PHX  A.)  On

to  be  in  Contempt  of  Court  during  a  child  custody  battle  with  his  second  wife.  When
asked if he was using drugs, which his former spouse alleged, Applicant averred “no,”
since Applicant had previously ceased any marijuana usage due to his heart condition.
However, he tested  “positive”  as a result of his past marijuana usage. (TR at page 18
line  18  to  page  20  line  6.)  As  a  result,  Applicant  was  sentenced  to  seven  days  of

arrested  and  charged  with  being  an  “unlicensed  driver”  in  State  B,  which  had
suspended  his  State  B  driver’s  license  as  a  result  of  his  2018  DUI  arrest.  (AppX  A.)
Although he had moved to State B, he was still using his previous valid State A driver’s
