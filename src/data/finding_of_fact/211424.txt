The  SOR  alleges  nine  delinquent  consumer  and  medical  accounts  totaling
$11,663  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.i)  and  one  delinquent  account  totaling  $20,217  relating  to  the
voluntary repossession of a vehicle (SOR ¶¶ 1.j). In his Answer, Applicant admitted all
the  allegations,  with  explanations.  In  addition  to  his  admissions,  the  debts  are
established by his June 2022 and May 2023 credit reports. (GX 1-2, 4-5)
Applicant  did  not  list  any  delinquent accounts  in  his  May  2022  SCA.  During  his
July 2022 interview with a security clearance background investigator, he initially denied
any  delinquent  accounts  and  stated  that  “for  the  most  part,”  he  paid  his  bills  on  time.
When  asked  about  specific  accounts,  he  recognized  the  accounts  associated  with  the
voluntarily vehicle repossession (¶ 1.j), a cellphone (¶ 1.c) and home furnishings (¶ 1.d).
He believed those accounts had been resolved and closed. He further explained that his
wife managed their finances and may have opened some of the other accounts without
his knowledge. He stated he would speak with his wife and formulate a plan to address
his delinquent debts. (GX 3, 6)
In  his  SOR  answer,  Applicant  claimed  to  have  a  plan  to  resolve  his  delinquent
accounts.  He  stated  that,  starting  in  March  2023,  he  would  dedicate  a  portion  of  his
monthly  income  toward  settling  the  accounts.  He  did  not  provide  a  budget,  proposed
payments or other details of that plan. (GX 2)
SOR ¶ 1.a ($4,893) is a consumer rental account that was opened in about April
2017 with a last payment issued in May 2017. The account was placed for collection in
about  August  2020.  Applicant’s  May  2023  credit  report  reflected  that  the  account  has
since been “closed or paid” with a $0 balance. (GX 4-5)
SOR ¶¶ 1.b ($2,531), 1.f ($663), 1.h ($277) and 1.i ($149) are medical accounts
that were placed for collection from 2020 through 2022.  These accounts were listed in
Applicant’s  June  2022  credit  report,  but  do  not  appear  in  his  May  2023  credit  report.
There is no record that the accounts were paid or otherwise resolved. (GX 4-5)
SOR  ¶¶  1.c  ($1,262)  and  1.d  ($750)  are  the  cellphone  and  home  furnishings
accounts  discussed above, which  were  placed  for collection  in about September 2020
and  October  2021,  reversely.  These  accounts  were  listed  in  Applicant’s  June  2022
credit report, but do not appear in his May 2023 credit report. There is no record that the
accounts were paid or otherwise resolved. (GX 4-6)
SOR ¶ 1.e ($679) is a consumer account that was placed for collection in about
July 2020. This account  was listed in Applicant’s June  2022  credit  report  but does not
appear in his May 2023  credit report. There is  no record  that the account was paid or
otherwise resolved. (GX 4-5)
SOR ¶ 1.g ($459) is a credit card account that was opened in August 2021. The
account  became  delinquent  and  was  charged  off  in  about  May  2022.  The  account
continues to show as charged off in Applicant’s May 2023 credit report. (GX 4-5)
SOR ¶ 1.j ($20,217) is a vehicle account that was opened in May 2017 with a last
payment  occurring  in  November  2018.  During  his  background  interview,  Applicant
stated  he  believed  the  account  was  only  in  his  wife’s  name,  but  also  recalled  signing
paperwork  when  they  purchased  the  vehicle.  They  allowed  the  vehicle  to  be
repossessed  at  an  unspecified  date  and  the  account  is  reflected  as  charged  off  in  his
July 2020 and May 2023 credit reports. (GX 4-6)
Applicant’s credit reports reflect that he resolved two other delinquent credit card
accounts that were not alleged in the SOR. He also opened a new vehicle loan in about
May 2022 with a balance of $24,266 and a monthly payment of $686. As of May 2023,
that account was current. (GX 4-5)
Applicant  did  not  respond  to  the  Government’s  FORM  or  otherwise  offer  any
mitigating evidence beyond what he stated in his SOR answer. He also did not submit a
budget and did not detail or document his total monthly income and expenditures.
