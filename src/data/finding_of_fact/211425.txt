Applicant is a 30-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for
her current employer since July 2022.  In September 2022, she was removed from her
position because her interim clearance was suspended pending her security clearance
adjudication.  The  company  has  saved  a  position  for  her  if  she  receives  her  security
clearance.  She  served  on  active  duty  in  the  United  States  Navy  from  2011  to  2015,
separating with an honorable discharge at the rank of Petty Officer Second Class. She
deployed overseas on two occasions. She has some college credits. She is married, but
separated from her spouse in 2017. She has no children.  (Tr. at 16, 23-24, 43-45, 85;

Guideline F,  Financial Considerations
On   May  10,  2021,   Applicant  submitted   an   Electronic  Questionnaires   for
Investigations   Processing   (e-QIP).   In   response   to   Section   26   –  Financial  Record   -
Delinquency  Involving   Routine   Accounts,  she   listed   a   debt  related   to   an   apartment
eviction, but  indicated  it was  paid in  full, and  a  truck  that was  repossessed  with  a loan
balance  of  approximately  $9,000.  (GE  1  at  48-51)
Applicant’s  subsequent  background  investigation  revealed  additional  delinquent
debts.  The  SOR  alleges  27  delinquent  debts  including  a  $25,030  debt  incurred  by  a
voluntary automobile repossession (SOR ¶ 1.a); a $9,747 debt related to an apartment
eviction (SOR ¶ 1.q); an approximate total of $7,088 of delinquent consumer accounts
(SOR ¶¶ 1.b – 1.g, 1.m, 1.t, 1.z and 1.aa); and 15 delinquent medical accounts, totaling
approximately $4.435. (SOR ¶¶ 1.h – 1.l, 1.n – 1.p, 1.r, 1.s, and 1.u – 1.y)
Applicant struggled financially after she separated from active duty. It was difficult
to find employment that paid as well as the military. At one point, she lived in her car.
Before the SOR was issued, she resolved 12 delinquent accounts that were not alleged
in the SOR. (Tr. 10 -12, 29)  The status of the remaining debts are as follows:

repossession:  Applicant  purchased  a  new  car  around  the  time  she  separated  from

dealer.  This is her highest  debt. She  intends  to  pay  it  back  when she  is able  to  make
payments. She is concentrating on paying off the smaller debts first. This debt remains
unresolved. (Tr. 13, 29-30, 70; GE 3 at 5; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 2)

Guideline  E, Personal Conduct
Under  Personal  Conduct,  concerns  are  raised  about  Applicant’s  employment
history from March 2016 to February 2021, including:
SOR  ¶   2.a:   In   February  2021,  she   was   fired   by  Employer  A   due   to   attendance
issues.  Applicant  admits  that  she   was  fired,  but  also  states   she   quit  because   her  co-
workers refused  to  wear masks. Applicant  was concerned  about catching  the  COVID-19
virus  because  of her medical issues. (Tr. 35-36; 65-66)
SOR ¶  2.b:  In October 2020, she was fired by Employer B due to performance
issues. Applicant admits to being fired from Employer B, but states she was not being
treated  fairly.  She  filed  a  complaint  under EEOC,  but  withdrew the  complaint  because
she  could  not  afford  lawyers.  During  her  employ,  the  pandemic  started  and  the
company went remote. Employer B claimed she was absent from work. She denies this
because she was teleworking on the days in question. (Tr. 36, 63; GE 6; AE E)
SOR  ¶   2.c:  In  May  2019,  she  was  fired  by  Employer  C  due  to  attendance  and
performance  issues.  Applicant  admits  she  was  terminated.  She  states  she  never
received counseling about her performance issues. (Tr. 38, 62; GE 7; AE B)
SOR  ¶   2.d:  In  March  2019,  she  was  fired  by  Employer  D  due  to  attendance
issues.  Applicant  denies  this  allegation.  She  was  hired  during  a  furlough  and  did  not
have a paid position. She left because of financial issues. (Tr. 39; 59-61; GE 8; AE C)
SOR  ¶   2.e:
In   December  2018,  she   left   employment   with   Employer  E   without
notice  and  without paying  back  her  relocation  bonus. (Gov 9) Applicant admits  she  left
without  proper notice. She  was at  the  company for four months.  She  left because  there
was  no   opportunity   for  growth.     She   was  paid  a   $500   relocation   bonus.  If  she   had
stayed  at the  company  for one  year, she  would not have  to  repay  the  relocation  bonus.
It  is  not clear  that she  paid the  $500  relocation  bonus back to  Employer  E. (Tr. 40, 57-
58; GE  9, AE D)
SOR ¶  2.f:  In July 2016, she was fired by Employer F due to attendance issues.
Applicant admits this allegation.  She suffered heat exhaustion while delivering items in
a vehicle that had no air conditioning in over 100 degree heat. She went home sick. The
next  day  she  came  into  work,  she  was  fired  because  she  did  not  have  any  leave
balance. (Tr. 56; GE 2 at 12)
SOR  ¶   2.g:
In  March  2016,  she  was  allegedly  recommended  for  a  general
discharge  from  the  Navy  due  to  multiple  unexcused  absences.  Applicant  denies  this
allegation.  She provided a copy of her DD Form 214, which shows she was separated
on  July  31,  2015,  with  an  honorable  discharge.  While  the  investigator  conducting  her
background investigation confronted her about the general discharge in March 2016, no
DD Form 214 or other evidence verifying this is in the record. I find SOR ¶ 2.g for the
Applicant. (GE 2 at 26; AE I)
