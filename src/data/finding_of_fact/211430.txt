Applicant  admitted  both  SOR  allegations. She  is  66  years old. She  married  in 1980
and  has  been  widowed  since  2006.  She  has  three  adult  children. She  earned  a bachelor’s
degree  in  1982. She  has owned  her home  since  1987. (Tr. at  6-7,  25-27,  31; GE  1; AE
A)
As  of  the  date  of  the  hearing,  Applicant  worked  as  a  program  area  administrator
for  a   DOD  contractor   since   2012.  She   worked   only   part   time   from   2014   to   September
2022, and  then  she  worked  full  time  until her retirement in  August  2023.  She  also  worked
as  a self-employed  beauty consultant since  2011. She   previously worked  for the  same
DOD  contractor  beginning   in  2002,   except  for  a   period   of   unemployment   from
approximately May 2009  to  December 2009.  She  worked  full  time  for a  temporary agency
from  2010  to  2012. She  was first granted  a  security clearance  in approximately 2006. (Tr.
at 5, 7, 26-32, 42, 51-52, 59-61, 64; GE  1-3; AE A)
The  SOR alleged  that Applicant  failed  to  timely file her  federal income  tax returns,
as required, for tax  years (TY) 2011  through  2018, and  that they  remained  unfiled  as  of
the  date  of  the  SOR.  (SOR ¶  1.a) It  also  alleged  that  she  failed  to  timely file  her  state
income  tax  returns, as required,  for tax years 2011  and  2013  through  2018,  and  that they
remained   unfiled   as   of  the   date   of  the   SOR.  (SOR  ¶   1.b)  The   SOR  allegations  are
established   by  her  admissions  in   her  Answer;  her  2020   security  clearance   application
(SCA);   her  interviews   with   an   authorized   DOD  investigator   in  2020;   and   her  2021
response to interrogatories. (Answer;  GE  1-3)
Applicant  attributed   her   failure   to   file  her  income   tax  returns   to   the   financial
challenges that began  with  the  death  of her spouse  in 2006  and  that  continued  when  she
became  a  caregiver  for  her parents and  best friend. In  2008,  she  assisted  her mother with
caring  for her  ill father  until his death  in 2011.  To  relieve  some  of her  financial obligations
after his death, she  began  her  home-based  cosmetics business  that  year. The  exhaustion
of  caregiving,   the   responsibility   of   managing   her  husband’s    estate,   and   her  grief  and
depression  following  his death  hampered her ability to  organize her supporting  business
receipts and  other  necessary tax-related  documentation.  Her disorganization  continued
with  subsequent tax years, and  she  mistakenly believed  that she  needed  to  first file her
older income  tax returns before she  could  file her more recent ones.  She  also suffers from
attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, which  further affected  her ability  to  focus on  details
and important matters.  (Answer; Tr. at 37-39, 42-43, 45-48, 51-52, 59-60; GE  1-3; AE C,
G, I)
In 2014, Applicant assisted her mother with downsizing her marital home and her
mother  moved  in  with  her.  In  2017,  Applicant  helped  care  for  her  friend,  who  was
diagnosed with cancer, until her friend’s death in 2018. In 2020, Applicant’s mother had
a stroke and Applicant cared for her mother until her death in 2022, shortly after she was
also  diagnosed  with  cancer.  After  making  the  funeral  arrangements  and  settling  her
mother’s estate, she suffered from depression. As she slowly regained focus for her job
and to begin to resolve her outstanding income tax returns, she briefly listed her home for
sale, from around April 2022 to October 2022, to downsize. She ultimately took her home
off the market due to the lack of interest and the change in market conditions. Her efforts
were further delayed when she caught COVID in October 2022. (Answer; Tr. at 37-39,
42-43, 45-48, 55-57, 59-60; GE 1-3; AE C, G, I)
Applicant assumed  she  was due  tax refunds for the  tax years in which  she  did not
file  an   income   tax   return  because   she   never  received   any   communication   from   the
Internal Revenue  Service  (IRS) regarding  any  tax liability. When  she  received  notice  from
the  state tax  authority  that  she  owed  state  income  taxes  for  TY 2012, she  made  monthly
payments of $150  for 22  months, beginning  in  2019, and  she  paid her outstanding  state
taxes of approximately  $5,926  for that tax  year in 2022. (Answer; Tr. at  37-39,  42-43,  45-
48, 55-57, 59-60; GE  1-3; AE C, G, I)
In approximately 2019, Applicant began working with a tax professional. With his
assistance, she filed her federal and state income tax return for TY 2019 in October 2020,
with an approved IRS tax extension. She was due a federal and state tax refund of $22
and $651, respectively, for that tax year. In October 2022, the tax professional prepared
her federal income tax returns for TY 2011 through 2018, however, he did so without the
benefit of her business expenses or a W-2 form to prepare her state income tax returns.
She had to compile such information before the income tax returns for those tax years
could be filed. (Answer; Tr. at 36-37, 44, 47-48, 53-59, 61-62, 67-69; GE 1, 3; AE C, G, I)
Upon  the advice of  the  tax professional, Applicant  prioritized  and filed  her most
recent federal and state income tax returns, for TY 2020, 2021, and 2022, in April 2023,
so that she could obtain the refunds to which she was due. She expected a federal income
tax refund totaling $118 and a state income tax refund totaling $2,873 for those tax years.
With the help of the tax professional, she compiled her business expenses and filed her
2011 through 2018 federal income tax returns in June 2023. She owed federal income
taxes totaling $10,681 for those tax years. Since this tax debt was not alleged in the SOR,
I will not consider this evidence for disqualification purposes, but I may use it as it relates
to  credibility, mitigation,  and  in applying  the whole-person  factors. She did not provide
documentation reflecting that she filed her state income tax returns for TY 2011 and 2013
through 2018. She testified that the state tax authority had not contacted her concerning
her unfiled state income tax returns. (Tr. at 32-36, 39-42, 44, 47-48, 53-59, 61-62, 67-69;
GE 1, 3; AE C, G, I)
Applicant’s  annual  income  as  of  the  date  of  the  hearing  was  approximately
$70,000.  When  she  worked  only  part  time  from  2014  to  September  2022,  her  annual
income was approximately $60,000.  She also earned approximately $10,000 annually,
from 2020  through  the date  of the  hearing,  from  her home-based cosmetics  business.
She had approximately $144,000 in a savings account as of April 2023. After paying her
monthly expenses,  to include her monthly mortgage of $1,540,  her net  remainder was
$700. She intends to utilize this money to resolve any outstanding taxes. Since 2020, she
has worked to reduce her overall debt and improve her credit ratings. Her credit reports
from 2023  reflect a  “very good” credit rating. She does not have any delinquent debts.
The tax professional provided her with financial counseling, in addition to helping her with
her taxes. She stated that she lived modestly and within her financial means.  She has
developed a system to stay on top of her business expenses and she intends to timely
file her future income tax returns. (Tr. at 27-30, 42-43, 48-53, 57-59, 62-63; GE 3-5; AE
C, D, E, F, H, I)
In  May  2022,  an  individual  who  served  as  Applicant’s  assistant  supervisor  for
several  years  and  supervisor  for  six  months,  described  Applicant  as  a  “very  detail-
oriented person with high standards to get the work done in a professional manner.” This
individual attested to Applicant’s trustworthiness, reliability, and judgment. In June 2023,
a  work colleague of over 15 years also attested to Applicant’s trustworthiness and strong
work ethic. (AE B, I)
