Applicant  is a  53-year-old employee  of a  defense  contractor.  He  has  worked  for
his  current  employer since  2002. He served  on  active duty  in  the  U.S. military from  1989
until 1991. He has a  20% disability rating  from  the  Department  of Veterans Affairs, and
he receives  $327 per month in  disability pay. He is a high school graduate with technical
training   and   licenses.  He  married   in  1996,  separated   in  about  2020,   and   is  pending   a
divorce. He has two  adult children  and  a  minor child  from  the  marriage. (Tr.  at  19, 22-
24, 33-34, 53; GE  1, 4-6)
The  SOR  alleges  a  charged-off  $23,829  debt  to  a  bank  (SOR  ¶  1.a)  and  a
mortgage  loan  that  was  $11,086  past  due,  with  a  balance  of  $288,546  (SOR  ¶  1.b).
Applicant  attributed  his  financial  problems  to  his  separation,  pending  divorce,  and  his
wife’s overspending. (Tr. at 17-18; GE 6)
Applicant and his wife refinanced their joint mortgage loan in 2017 and again in
April  2020.  A  May  2022  credit  report  lists  the  account  as  $11,086  past  due,  with  a
balance  of  $288,546  (SOR  ¶  1.b).  Applicant  withdrew  from  his  401(k)  retirement
account to bring the loan current. (Tr. at 17-18, 21, 43-47; GE 2, 3, 6; AE A)
Applicant’s  wife  was  in  a  car  accident  in  about  2016.  Her  car  was  a  total  loss,
and  she  had  a  neck  injury  that  required  an  operation.  There  was  a  delay  in  receiving
funds  from  the  insurance  company.  Rather  than  wait  for  the  insurance  company,
Applicant  and  his  wife  took  out  a  loan  of  between  about  $23,000  and  $30,000  in
October  2016,  which  was  used  to  buy  a  car  and  pay  her  medical  bills.  When  a
settlement was received, his wife took the money and did not give him anything to pay
the loan. He made his last payment on the account in February 2019, and the creditor
charged off the account with a balance of $23,829 (SOR ¶ 1.a). He made no attempt to
resolve the account after it was charged off, until the SOR spurred him into taking some
action. (Tr. at 25-32, 42; GE 2, 3, 6)
Applicant  and  his  wife  entered  into  a  mediated  settlement  agreement  in  May
2023.  The  agreement  provided  that  their  house  would  be  sold  at  a  mutually  agreed
upon price. The SOR ¶ 1.a debt would be “negotiated down as low as possible and paid
in full” from the proceeds of the sale. They also agreed to pay the IRS $7,500 for their
2022 taxes from the proceeds. Applicant and the SOR ¶ 1.a creditor agreed to settle the
debt for a lump-sum payment of $7,148, to be paid no later than June 11, 2023. (Tr. at
35, 39-40, 48; AE B, C)
Applicant  testified  that  there  was  interest  in  the  house,  “the  housing  market  is
very high over here right now,” and he expected the house to be sold. He stated that if
the  house  is  not  sold,  he  would  start  paying  $297  per  month  to  the  creditor  until  the
house is sold. The creditor told him that the settlement deal would still be available if he
made those payments. He stated that his finances will be stable after the house is sold.
In  June  2023,  he  stated  that  he  made  a  $200  payment  to  the  creditor  to  keep  the
settlement deal, but he did not submit any supporting documentation. The house never
sold,  Applicant  has  never  settled  the  debt,  and  he  has  not  provided  documentation  of
any  payments.   He   stated   that   “[t]he   current   housing   market  here   has  stalled   and   I  am
unable to secure a  buyer at this time.”  (Tr. at 36-38, 49-54; AE D)
