Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted for seven delinquent
accounts  totaling  $55,357.  He  admits  SOR  ¶  1.a  through  1.d  and  denies  1.e  and  1.f,
stating that the debts are no longer on his credit bureau report (CBR). He also denies
SOR ¶ 1.g, stating that he does not recognize the debt. His admissions are incorporated
in my findings of fact.
Applicant,  40,  has  been  sponsored  by  a  defense  contractor  for  a  position  as  a
logistics  specialist  since  November  2021,  pending  the  adjudication  of  his  security
clearance.  He previously worked for the  same contractor from  July 2021 to November
2021,  when  he  was  terminated  for erroneous  child  support arrears.  He  has  been  self-
employed as an online personal trainer since 2015. In August 2021, he and his wife began
creating  and  posting  videos  on  a  social  media  platform  for  which  they  receive
compensation.  He  served  honorably  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  Marine  Corps  from
February 2003 until May 2015. He received his personal trainer certificate in 2016 and
his bachelor’s degree in 2020. He married in 2003 and divorced in 2018. He married again
in  2018.  He  has  two  adult  children,  a  16-year-old,  and  a  7-year-old  stepchild.  He  was
granted his first security clearance while on active duty. (GX 3.)
Applicant was unemployed for approximately two weeks in November 2021. His
personal  trainer  income  was  significantly  reduced  in  2020  due  to  the  COVID-19
pandemic. (GX 7.)
SOR  ¶   1.a   -  $40,308   –   charged   off.  During  his  January  2022  personal  subject
interview (PSI) conducted as part of his background investigation, Applicant stated that
he had his vehicle repossessed due to his loss of income in spring 2020. He has not paid
this debt nor has he made any payment arrangements. He stated on his August 2021 e-
QIP,  “I  have  not  taken  any  actions.  When  I  called  they  said  that  they  could  no  longer
access  my  account  and  had  no  information  on  it.”  This  debt  is  listed  on  Applicant’s
January 2023 CBR (GX 6) and it remains unresolved. (GX 7; GX 6; GX 3.)
Applicant also had a vehicle  repossessed in 2018, but  he  stated during his PSI
that he thinks the creditor resold the vehicle for more than he owed on it and he therefore
has no financial obligation  to  the creditor. His October 2021  CBR states, “Merchandise
taken  back  by  Grantor/possible  balance  due  .  .  .  Involuntary  repossession/obligation
satisfied.” (GX 7; GX 5.)
SOR ¶  1.b  - $4,203  –  collection. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that
he  was  never  late  on  his  rent  and  that  when  he  moved  out,  he  was  overcharged  for
cleaning and repairs. He also stated, “Due to my low income, I was unable to pay for my
new place and make a payment for $4,000.” This debt is listed as disputed on Applicant’s
April 2022 CBR. This debt is not listed on the January 2023 CBR. (GX 6.)
SOR ¶  1.c - $3,908. During his PSI, Applicant stated that he had braces put on his
teeth  that  were  causing  him  issues.  He  contacted  the  dental  clinic  which  refused  to
address the issues. He then asked for the dental clinic to remove the braces, but the clinic
would not do so until Applicant paid his balance in full. He removed the braces himself
and did not pay the balance. He believes that he disputed this account. This debt is not
listed on the January 2023 CBR. (GX 7.)
SOR ¶  1.d  - $3,764. Applicant explained during his PSI that the creditor of this debt
is  the  apartment  complex  where  Applicant  currently  resides.  His  former  spouse  was
supposed to move out of their previously shared apartment in the complex on a specific
date but did not do so. The apartment complex charged Applicant instead of his former
spouse for the additional rent.  This debt is listed  as disputed  on  Applicant’s April 2022
CBR. This debt is not listed on the January 2023 CBR. (GX 7.)
SOR ¶  1.e  - $2,343.  During his PSI, Applicant stated that the creditor of this debt
is a housing complex where Applicant was stationed. When he moved out, he was current
on the rent and was cleared by the housing office. He does not understand why he was
charged an additional fee. This debt is listed as disputed on Applicant’s April 2022 CBR.
This debt is not listed on the January 2023 CBR. (GX 7; GX 5.)
SOR ¶  1.f - $686.  This debt is owed to a cellular telephone carrier. Applicant stated
during his PSI that he changed carriers and received a bill for approximately $300 for one
month of service. He contacted the company and asked what plan he was on that cost
$600 for two months. The carrier was not able to provide information on any plan that
cost that amount. Applicant terminated the service and to the best of his recollection has
disputed this account. He currently has a cellular telephone account with the creditor of
this debt. This debt is not listed on the January 2023 CBR. (GX 7.)
SOR ¶  1.g  - $145.  During his PSI, Applicant stated that this medical account should
have been covered by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Applicant believed
that the debt had been satisfied but stated that he would contact the creditor to confirm
that it had been paid. This debt is not listed on the January 2023 CBR. (GX 7.)
Applicant did not provide any documentation regarding the status of the debts he
disputed. In his January 2022 PSI, Applicant stated that he was currently financially stable
and  did  not  anticipate  any  financial  difficulties  in  the  future.  He  stated  that  he  had  “no
problem with paying his creditors as agreed.” (GX 7.)
