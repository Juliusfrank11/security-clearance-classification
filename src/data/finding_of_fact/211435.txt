incorporated into the findings of fact.
Applicant is a 53-year-old Navy veteran. He was honorably discharged in 1988.
He  is  married  with  two  adult  children.  He  has  worked  for  a  federal  department  as  a

Guideline F
SOR ¶  1.a: past-due account  charged off in the  amount  of  $5,195.  Applicant
admitted responsibility for this debt in his Answer. At the hearing he testified it was “paid
off.” (Tr. at 48.) Under further examination on whether he had paid the debt off he stated
“I  don't  know.  I'm  not  sure.  Because  I  had  not  received  any  notice  from  [financial
institution].” (Tr. at 49.) He cited losing his job for why stopped making payments on the
debt. (Tr. at 51.) This debt is not resolved.
SOR  ¶   1.b:  past-due   account   referred   for  collection   for  $3,851.   Applicant
admitted responsibility for this debt and testified he paid it off in full and that there was no
outstanding balance. (Tr at 51.) He supported his testimony with AE F showing the debt

was told the company did not have a record of any account under either his or his wife's
name. He does not have a record of his contact with the company. He stated he never
paid off the account because when he called them and offered to pay the company, they
said they did not have a record of the account. (Tr. at 54.) When asked if he or his wife
had  an  account  with  the  company  he  answered  “No,  I  don't,  but  I  do  now,  but  I  don't
before, no but I do now.” (Tr. at 55.) This debt is not resolved.
SOR  ¶   1.d:  past-due   account   charged  off   in  the   amount   of   $565.   Applicant

question  but  denied  getting  a  credit  card  from  the  store.  (Tr.  at  56.)  In  his  Answer  he
stated he “called the company and they were not able to locate the account.”  (Tr. at 56.)
SOR ¶  1.e: past-due account charged off in the  amount  of  $5,140. Applicant
admitted responsibility for this account in his Answer. He testified he called the company

had been settled on June 9, 2023, for $1,42.23. (AE E.)
SOR ¶  1.f: past-due account  placed  for collection for  a  judgment obtained in
2016  in the  approximate amount  of  $5,058.
Applicant admitted responsibility for this
debt and testified he paid it off in October or November of 2022 with a $5,000 check to
the county district court. He obtained a personal loan to be able to satisfy the judgment in
the  amount  of  $17,000.  (Tr.  at  58,  59;  GE  7  at  6.)  He  explained  the  six-year  delay  in
paying the judgment stating, “I had to find out exactly where it is, and it took some time
for [the Court] to call me back and tell me what I needed to know and send them a check.
Plus, I didn't have the money to pay them at the time.” (Tr. at 58.)
SOR ¶  1.g:  past-due account  charged  off in the  amount  of  $3,851.  This debt

SOR  ¶   1.j:  2016   judgment   for   $142,089   owed  to   a   financial  institution.
Applicant questioned whether he took out the mortgages but acknowledges making the
payments. He thought the mortgages were in his parents’ name and could not explain
why they appeared  on  his credit reports as his debts.  (Tr. at 63-64; GE  5; GE  6.)  He stated
they  were  current  on  the  first mortgage  and  let the  second  one  lapse  in  2014. (Tr.  at  63)
He intended to  use the additional money from the second mortgage  to get “a clean start”
because  they had  been  living  beyond  their  means.  (Tr. at 65; 77.) He cited  not working
for a  year but  his  SCA  showed  him  employed  from  July 2011  until June  2015  with  the
same company. (GE 1  at 20; Tr. at 65.)
SOR ¶  1.k: 2017  foreclosure  and auction of  mortgage  accounts.  During the
examination  under  Guideline  E  allegations  Applicant  was  evasive  in  stating  he  was
unaware whether  the foreclosure happened. (Tr. 33-35.) He testified his parents bought
the house in 1992 and that his parents  let his family live there. He paid the mortgages on
the house.  Both mortgages appear on his credit reports. (Tr. at 63-65; GE 5 at 2; GE 7
at 9.) He explained “We paid the mortgage, and then I took out a second mortgage on
that house when we got in a financial situation. We were current with the first one. The
second one, I let it lapse.” (Tr. at 63.) He could not recall when he let the mortgage lapse,
which according to the credit reports was in March 2014. (Tr. at 64; GE  5; GE 7 at 9.)
SOR  ¶   1.l:  filed  for   Chapter  13   Bankruptcy   in  about   2004,   which  was

discharged in 2007.
his wife had been living beyond their means. (Tr. at 46; GE 4.)
After receiving the SOR Applicant hired a law firm in September 2022 to represent
him  concerning  the  negative  credit  items.  (Answer  Exhibit.)  At  the  hearing  he
acknowledged the law firm had not resolved any SOR accounts. (Tr. at 48.)
Applicant  discussed   taking   out   a   personal  loan   to   settle   SOR  ¶   1.f.   The   total
amount  of  the  loan  was $17,000.  He used  a  portion  of  the  remainder of  the  loan  to  pay
off   a   $5,000   debt  with   his  sister  that  he   incurred   getting   his  teeth   fixed   in  2015.  The
remaining  $7,000   went  to   settling  other personal debt.   The   interest  rate on   the   loan   is
26.5 percent.  (Tr. at 83.)
Applicant admitted:
…   all   my   life   since   I   got  married,  we  were   constantly  in,  like   I  said,   we
overspend.  We  got  a  lot  of credit cards. We  overspend.  We  lived  beyond
our  [two]  means, and  we had  gotten  in credit  card trouble,  all  this  stuff. And
then  I  took out  the  second  one  so  we can  get  ahead  of ourselves. I  did not
realize  that I  was going  to  lose  my job. Otherwise,  I would have  kept paying
the  second  mortgage  and  the  first one, all  this stuff,  but I  lost my job. (Tr. at
65.)
Applicant  cited  his  wife’s  reduced  income  in  2019,  that  it  occurred  “under  the
COVID  issue”  for  the  2017  foreclosure.  (Tr.  at  34.)  Applicant  was  evasive  in  trying  to
explain this point and cited a change in his contract position. (Tr. at 34, 35-36.)
Applicant  told  investigator  during  his  security  clearance  interview  his  financial
situation  was  paycheck  to  paycheck.  (GE  2  at  18.)  Government  Exhibit  7  shows  no
delinquent accounts on his current credit report.
Guideline E
SOR ¶¶  2.a  and 2.b.  The Guideline E allegations stem from his failure to disclose
that information as set forth in SOR ¶¶ 1.f, 1.h, and 1.j regarding whether a judgment had
been entered against him and his failure to disclose that information as set forth in SOR
¶¶ 1.a through 1.k, whether he had any property repossessed or foreclosed, defaulted on
any loan, or had an account or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing
to pay as agreed. In his Answer Applicant stated “When I fill[ed]  out the [SCA] I did make
a mistake in filling it out but after I submitted [it,] I realized I had made a mistake and when
I spoke with the investigator I did admit to the mistake and went over my credit history.”
(Answer.)
During his security clearance interview he told the investigator that he was doing
fine financially. He told the investigator he was meeting all his financial obligations. He
responded, no to the investigator as whether he was more than 120 days delinquent on
any debt and whether he was involved in any credit counseling. He also responded, no
as to whether he had any judgments or foreclosures against him. After these responses,
the investigator confronted him with the numerous debts and judgments set forth in SOR
¶  1. (GE 2 at 9-10, 17-19.)
Applicant  testified  he  had  “heavy  thoughts”  about  how  he  answered  his  SCA
questions. He stated “I was thinking that if I said yes or answered those questions and
then my clearance -- I would lose my clearance.” (Tr. at 32.) He testified he was going to
go back in and resubmit it, but by the time he decided to do that, the investigator called
and said he wanted to talk to him about his security clearance. (Tr. at 32.)
Applicant  was  evasive  stating  he  was  unaware  that  the  2017  foreclosure
happened.  After  being  asked  again  if  he  knew  his  house  had  been  foreclosed  on,  he
stated he assumed it was a short sale. (Tr. at 32-37.) Applicant initially denied receiving
$97,000 back after both mortgages were paid off from the foreclosure until confronted by
Department Counsel. He said the $97,000 went to paying off all the other creditors he
and his wife owed. (Tr. at 37.)
Applicant’s wife testified that she let her husband “decide all those things” when it
came to the foreclosure and the past debts. He was the one taking care of the financial
matters (Tr. at 24.) Applicant admitted he knew he had credit card debts but did not realize
at the time the situation was that bad. (Tr. at 37.)
