Applicant  denied  the  allegations  at  SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.e  and  2.a-2.b.  He  admitted
SOR ¶ 3.a, with a narrative explanation. His admission is incorporated into the findings
of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I
make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  55   years  old.   His  first   two   marriages  ended   in   divorce.  He  has   two
grown children. He remarried  in July  2022  to  a  citizen and  resident of Colombia.  (SOR ¶
3.a)  After  graduating   from   college   in   1991,   he   was  commissioned   as  a  U.S.  Marine
officer  and   served   until  2001,  as  an   aviator.   with   the   rank  of  captain  (O-3).   He  held  a
clearance   in   the   Marine   Corps.  He  earned   a   master’s  degree   in  global finance   in  May
2009.  (GE  1; Tr. 36-38; AE  A; AE B, AE C)

Subsequent employments include as a professional race car driver (2001-2003),
the
an  employee  of  his
franchising  business
pharmaceutical  and  health-care  industries  (2006-2013),  and  investment  banking  and
finance  (2013-2015).  He  worked  for  capital  investment  firm  A  from  2015  to  2022.  In
2016  and  2017,  Applicant  founded  two  companies  involved  in  construction  and  real
estate  ventures  (company  E)  and  related  financing  (company  S),  a  government
contractor. (AE B)
(2003-2006),
jobs
in
From  June  2021  to  February  2022,  Applicant  worked  part-time  at  a  large
hardware  store  chain.  From  December  2021  to  February  2022,  he  worked  as  a  state
government employee for State 1. (AE B) Applicant has been employed full time since
March  2022  as  a  commercial  airline  pilot  for  a  major  U.S.  airline.  He  worked  for  a
regional  carrier  until  September  2022,  when  he  was  hired  by  a  major  U.S.  airline.  He
seeks  a  security  clearance  for  his  position  as  the  managing  partner  and  founder  of
company S, a government contractor involved in a joint venture with company E. (GE 1,
Tr. 28-29, 38-45, 72-73, 94; 2Tr. 17-18 AE B)
For his work with capital investment firm A, Applicant worked on commission and
not  on  salary.  He  earned  little  income  in  his  time  there  (2015-2022)  beyond  the
$180,000 he earned in annual income in 2017. He said he had several hundred million
dollars  in  construction  projects  lined  up  in  his  construction  investment  business,  but
opportunities  evaporated  between  March  and  November  2020  at  the  start  of  the
COVID-19  pandemic.  By  March  2021,  his  businesses  were  “out  of  cash”  as  was
Applicant himself, and he soon faced “financial ruin.” He had no income from company
S  or  the  investment  firms.  He  took  a  part-time  job  at  a  large  hardware  store  to  make
ends meet. He earned $13.75 an hour for 25 hours a week. He then was hired by State
1 through a veterans’ employment program for $36,000 annually. He used those funds
to  make  his  flying  licenses  current,  which  was  necessary  for  his  subsequent
employment as a pilot. (Tr. 45-49, 72, 94-99, 127-128)
Applicant’s company S remains in a joint venture with the construction company
that  is  sponsoring  his  clearance  application.  He  is  considered  “key  management
personnel” for company S, and he needs a clearance in that role. (2Tr. 18-21)
Guideline F
SOR ¶¶ 1.a ($50,481) and 1.b ($38,269) are federal student loan accounts that
Applicant  used  to  finance  his  master’s  degree.  The  loans  were  opened  in  2013,
according to GE 5, but this may have been when they were sold to a new lender, since
he  completed  his  master’s  degree  in  2009.  He  said  his  student  loans  were  current  in
2017 because he was earning a regular salary and making regular payments. In March
2017, he requested that his federal student loans be placed in forbearance status due to
lack of funds. (AE R; 2Tr. 5)
Applicant  acknowledged  missing  student  loan  payments  beginning  in  2019.  He
chose to prioritize basic expenses (food, utilities, gas) and business expenses. He could
not afford to make student loan payments. He estimated that he missed 10 student loan
payments  before  seeking  a  deferment.  (Tr.  49-53,  103-112)  His  finances  were  also
impacted by the pandemic. (2Tr. 43) Applicant was unable to provide a payment history
for  his  student  loans  because  his  original  student  loan  provider  went  out  of  business.
(2Tr. 15-17)
Applicant  said the  last  time he made  a  payment  on  them  was in 2019.  He paid
about $400 a month from 2009 until 2017 when he fell behind and sought to place his
debts in forbearance. He would make payments when he received commission checks
and then request forbearance when “money was starting to dry up.” (2Tr. 32-34; AE R)
He  acknowledged  that  the  forbearance  he  received  in  2017  was  for  about  four or  five
months, and eventually his loans went to collections. (2Tr. 42-43)
Beginning  in  March  2020,  all  federal  student  loans  were  placed  in  deferred  or
forbearance status by presidential executive orders due to the COVID-19 pandemic. (Tr.
50, 84-85) An April 2023 CBR lists both federal student loan accounts as being in “pays
as agreed” status. No payments are listed but no amount is past due. (GE 5)
Applicant  said he owes  about $88,000  in federal student  loans.  He  said $5,000
may  remain  from  his  undergraduate  degree,  but  $75,000  plus  interest  was  for  the
master’s  degree.  (2Tr.  32)  He  currently  owes  no  amount  due  on  an  income-based
repayment plan for a family of four. (Tr. 81; AE D, AE E) The payment schedule options
he provided  show monthly payments of $533 over 20 years. $1,033 over 9 years, and
$1,533 over 6 years. (AE F; 2Tr. 30-31) His current plan to address his debts shows no
payments  for  12  months  (income-based  repayment),  until  July  2024,  then  $448
payments  for  months  13  to  129  (year  2  to  11).  (AE  E)  He  intends  to  make  payments
during  the  first  year  even  though  no  payments  would  be  owed.  He  has  not  begun  to
make payments, but he planned to do so at the end of July 2023. (Tr. 80-86; 2Tr. 27-28,
31; AE D, AE E; AE F)
Applicant now earns an  annual salary  of  almost $91,000  as a  commercial  airline
pilot.  His  salary  is  determined   by  length   of  service,  job   title,  and   the  type   of   plane   he
flies.   He   expected   a  significant  increase   as  of   August  2023,  to   $108,000   annual,  and
then  an  additional increase  as of November  2023, to  $166,000  annual.  (Tr. 73-75, 78-
80, 93-94;   AE   J,   AE   K)   He  has   calculated   future  student  loan   payments  based   on   the
significant  increased  income  he  expects as pilot. He  has a  mandatory retirement  age  of
65 as  a  pilot  so he wants to  pay off  his student loans  in 10 years. (Tr. 80-81)
The  three  other  SOR  debts  are  past-due  credit  card  accounts.  SOR  ¶  1.c
($1,354) is a debt that has been charged off by a bank. (GE 3 at 3; GE 4 at 5) Applicant
contacted the creditor numerous times and was told they have no record of the account
and referred him to a third-party collector. He does not recall or recognize this account
but intends to pay it off. (Tr. 69-71, 112-115, 121-122; 2Tr. 22-23)
SOR  ¶¶  1.d  ($442  past  due,  total  balance  of  $1,523)  and  1.e  ($204  past  due,
total  balance  of  $906)  are  delinquent  credit  card  accounts  to  the  same  creditor  bank.
Applicant took the cards out in about 2014 for business travel expenses (rental cars and
hotel  stays).  He  otherwise  used  credit  cards  only  for  emergencies.  The  accounts
became delinquent in about 2019 or mid-2020 because his monthly expenses outpaced
his business income (what he called his “burn rate”). He said he contacted the creditor
about his payment troubles and he was allowed  to make minimum payments. He also
said  that  in  2020,  the  creditor  offered  deferred  payments  until  December  2021,
apparently due to the pandemic. However, he was not able to provide documentation of
this. (Tr. 53-58; 66-69, 115-121; 2Tr. 14-15, 24; AE S)
Applicant paid $400 towards these debts ($200 a month) in June and July 2023
and  has  about  $1,800 outstanding,  to  be  paid  off  by  November 2023.  Payments  were
automatic until he changed banks. (Tr. 61-62; 2Tr. 25-27; AE G, AE H) These accounts
are being resolved.
In 2021, Applicant’s partnership rented an apartment for his use in State 1. Rent
was not paid on the unit for April, May, and June 2021, totaling about $4,000 to $6,000
in back rent. He said the rent was forgiven when he moved out at the end of June 2021.
It has not been paid. The creditor has not sought payment of the debt, but he plans to
repay it. He disclosed the debt during his background interview. (GE 2 at 2; Tr. 122-126;
2Tr  9-12,  40-41)  In  retrospect,  Applicant  recognizes  that  the  rent  was  delinquent  and
should  have  been  disclosed  on  his  July  2021  SCA.  (Tr.  133-134)  This  debt  was  not
alleged  in  the  SOR.  He  is  current  on  his  personal  income  tax  filings  but  business  tax
filings for his companies for tax years 2021 and 2022 remain unfiled. (2Tr. 36-38)
Applicant  sought  out  a  financial  advisor  in  November  2022  about  resolving  his
debts through a repayment plan and rebuilding his credit. He was advised to have a six-
month  financial  “safety  net.”  He  acknowledged  that  he  needs  to  “start  diffusing  those
debts” to show good faith. He prepared a family budget and payment plan in May 2023.
(Tr. 60-61, 63, 2Tr.  35;  AE  I,  AE J) The budget accounts  for $345 a  month  in  student
loan payments (total amount owed -- $92,505) and payments for the credit card debts at
SOR  ¶¶  1.c,  1.d,  and  1.e.  He  listed  a  net  remainder  of  $582  (based  on  his  $93,860
salary at the time). (AE J)
Guideline E
The  delinquent  debts  on  Applicant’s  August  2021  credit  bureau  report  (CBR)
include his two federal student loans (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b) and the bank debt at SOR ¶ 1.c,
each in collections. Of the other two bank debts in the SOR, one is listed as 120 days
past  due  and  one  is  current  on  that  CBR.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.d,  1.e)  (GE  3)  All  of  the  SOR
accounts were past due as of April 2022. (GE 4)
The   Financial   section   of   Applicant’s   July   2021   SCA   includes   questions   asking
whether  “You   are  currently  delinquent   on   any  federal  debt”   and   questions   seeking
disclosure of delinquencies involving  routine  accounts,  including  charged-off  debts  and
debts  in  collection  in  the  previous  seven  years. Applicant  did not disclose  his past-due
federal student loans or any other delinquencies  in answer to  these  questions. (GE  1  at
41)  In  answering  SOR ¶¶  3.a  and  3.b, he  denied any intent  to  deliberately  falsify these
answers and  said  he  answered  the  questions  to  the  best of his knowledge  at the  time
and in good  faith. (Answer # 1)
At his hearing, Applicant  said  he  did not disclose  the  credit  card  accounts  on  his
July  2021   SCA   because   he  did   not   believe   they   were   delinquent.  He  believed   the
creditor  had  agreed  to  place  them  in  deferment. He has experience  in financial services
with  accessing  credit reports  of others.  There  was nothing  he  did not  disclose. (Tr. 58-
59,  64-65;  2Tr.  24-25)   He  also  believed   his  federal   student  loans  were   not  delinquent
since  they had  been  placed  in  forbearance  due  to  the  COVID-19 pandemic.  (Tr. 28-29)
During   his  background   interview,  Applicant   gave   similar  explanations   for  his  lack   of
disclosure  of   these   debts  on   his  SCA  when   he   was  confronted   about  them   by  the
interviewing  agent. (GE  2  at  5-7)  He said he  was advised  by his facility security officer
(FSO)   to   answer  all   questions  on   his  SCA  accurately  and   completely   because
dishonesty is disqualifying. (Tr. 35-36)
Guideline B
Applicant’s wife is a citizen and resident of Colombia. (SOR ¶ 3.a) She provided
a  sworn  statement.  (AE  L)  They  were  introduced  by  a  fellow  airline  pilot.  They  first
spoke  on  the  phone  in  August  2021  and  met  in  person  in  early  October  2021  in
Colombia.  They  married  in  July  2022.  He  reported  his  marriage  to  his  contractor
company’s FSO soon afterward. (Answer # 2; AE L; Tr. 15, 31-35, 136-138)
Applicant’s  wife  has  two  teenage  sons  from  a  prior  relationship.  They  live  with
Applicant  in  Colombia when  he  is there  subject  to  his flight  schedule.  He  covers  most
household expenses for their home in Colombia. She wants to immigrate (“immigrate to”
and “emigrate from”) to  the U.S. with her sons. He submitted a spouse immigrant visa
for his wife in October 2022. (Answer # 2; AE L, AE M, AE N) She works in marketing in
Colombia.  She  has  never  worked  for  the  Colombian  government.  She  speaks  to  her
parents  daily.  One  of  her  sisters  is  married  to  a  customs  agent  employed  by  the
Colombian government. They live many hours away by car. She interacts with her sister
by phone once a month and they visit over the holidays. (Answer # 2; AE L; Tr. 82, 88,
89-90, 99-100, 135; 2Tr 8-9))
Applicant  travels  to  Colombia  regularly  to  stay  with  his  wife.  He  intends  to
continue to do so, but only until she can move to the U.S. His schedule is mapped out in
advance,  based  on  his  flight  schedule.  (Answer  #  2;  AE  L,  AE  O;  Tr.  87-89,  138-142;
2Tr. 38-39) He was in Colombia when he appeared for both of his DOHA hearings. (Tr.
143-144)
Applicant has no financial interests in Colombia beyond the apartment where he
lives with his wife. (Tr. 142-143) Applicant’s wife  said she understands the importance
of  his  clearance  and  will  support  him  to  ensure  full  transparency  and  compliance  with
laws and regulations. (AE L)
Applicant concluded his testimony by highlighting his long service to the country
and his desire to continue to serve the country and the government as a contractor. He
understands the immense responsibility of holding a clearance. He had no intention to
deceive  or  mislead  about  his  finances.  He  has  a  secure  income  as  a  pilot  and  is
rebuilding his savings. (2Tr. 45-47)
Mr. W, the CEO of the construction company in Applicant’s joint venture provided
a  character  letter.  Mr.  W  has  known  Applicant  since  2017  and  attests  to  Applicant’s
honesty  and  forthrightness,  especially  as  to  his  finances  and  family  life.  Applicant  is
reliable  and  sincere. Mr. W  has  faith  in Applicant’s  abilities  and commitment to ethical
conduct.  He  can  be  trusted  in  personal  and  professional  matters  and  in  matters  of
national security. (Tr. 90-91; AE P)
Colombia
With its Administrative Notice filing (AN I), the Government included information
from  the  U.S.  Department  of  State  as  of  June  2023  about  Colombia  and  its  relations
with the United States. Applicant provided AE Q, information from the State Department
about U.S. Relations with Colombia as of July 2021 (current as of July 2023).
I take administrative notice of these facts, consistent with my obligation to make
assessments  based  on  timely  information  in  cases  involving  foreign  influence.  ISCR
Case  No.  05-11292  at  4  (App.  Bd.  Apr.  12,  2007)  (“Decisions  in  Guideline  B  cases
should  be  made  to  the  greatest  extent  possible  in  the  context  of  current  political
conditions in the country at issue.”) The information is detailed as follows:
With   the   support  of  the   United   States,  Colombia   has  transformed   itself
over the  past 20  years from  a  fragile  state  to  a  vibrant democracy  with  a
growing, market-oriented economy.
Colombia   is  a   constitutional,  multiparty  republic.  The  country  held
presidential  and   legislative   elections   in  2022   that  observers  considered
free, fair, and peaceful.
In   2016,   the   Government  of   Colombia   signed   a   peace   accord   with   the
Revolutionary  Armed   Forces  of  Colombia   (FARC),  ending   decades  of
conflict.
Armed  groups, as well as narcotics traffickers, were  reported  as significant
perpetrators of human  rights abuses and  violent crimes,  including  acts of
extrajudicial  and   unlawful  killings,  extortion,   and   other  abuses  or  crimes,
such   as  kidnapping,  torture,  human   trafficking,  bombings,  restrictions  on
freedom   of  movement,  sexual  violence,  unlawful  recruitment  and   use   of
child   soldiers, and   threats  of   violence  against  journalists,   women,  human
rights defenders, and religious leaders.
The   United   States   is  committed   to   cooperating   with   Colombia  to
undermine   the   transnational  criminal  organizations  whose   activities,
especially narcotrafficking, are devastating  to  the  citizens of Colombia  and
of the United States.
In   addition,  the   State   Department  advises  that  U.S.  citizens  considering
travel to  Colombia  should exercise  increased  caution,  given  the  risk of civil
unrest, violent crime, organized  crime,  terrorism, and  kidnapping.
