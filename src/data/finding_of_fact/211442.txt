Applicant is a 41-year-old employee of a government contractor for whom he has
worked  since  July  2021.  He  has  been  married  and  divorced  twice.  His  first  marriage
was from 2005 until 2009.  His second marriage was from 2014 until 2021. He  resides
with a cohabitant. He does not have any children. He obtained a graduate equivalency
degree  (GED),  and  he  has  taken  many  college  courses  but  has  not  earned  an
undergraduate degree. He earned a certificate as a master educator in 2019. He served
on  active duty with  the  Army from  1999  until  2021,  when he retired  with an honorable
discharge.  He  was  assigned  to  multiple  overseas  deployments  while  he  served.  The
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has rated him as a 100 percent disabled veteran.

In  the  SOR,  the  Government  alleged  Applicant’s  five  delinquent  debts  totaling
approximately $49,000 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.e). He admitted all the Guideline F SOR
allegations with additional commentary. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact.
The  Guideline  F  SOR  allegations  are  established  by  his  admissions  and  the
Government’s 2021, 2022, and 2023 credit reports. (Tr. 42-78, 165-174; Answer; GE 1,
3-6, 10, 11; AE A)
The  Guideline  F  SOR  debts  are  being  resolved.  These  debts  consist  of  credit
cards,  a  personal  loan,  and  a  line  of  credit.  He  became  delinquent  on  these accounts
because  his  first wife took advantage  of his granting  her a power of  attorney  while he
was  deployed,  his  divorces,  the  theft  of  one  of  his  motorcycles,  and  the  high  cost  of
living where he was stationed in the military. (Tr. 42-78, 102, 165-174; Answer; GE 3-6,
10, 11; AE A)
In 2019, Applicant entered into an agreement with a debt consolidation company
(DCC) to  get  a  grip  on  his finances  and  to settle  his  consumer debts.  He enrolled  the
SOR  debts,  as  well  as  other  consumer  debts  not  listed  in  the  SOR.  Pursuant  to  their
agreement,  the  DCC  negotiates  settlement  agreements  with  enrolled  creditors.
Applicant  pays  a  monthly  fee  into  a  DCC  account  that  it  uses  to  make  payments  to
creditors with whom it has made a settlement agreement. (Tr. 42-78, 167; Answer; GE
3, 10, 11; AE A)
After about six months of his paying monthly fees to the DCC with no resolution
of  his  debts,  Applicant  pulled  out  of  the  agreement  and  attempted  to  negotiate  with
creditors on his own. While attempting to resolve his delinquencies on his own, he was
able to pay one debt that is not listed in the SOR, but because of his limited income at
the time, he was unable to resolve any other delinquent debts. (Tr. 42-46, 167; Answer;
GE 3, 10, 11; AE A)
In August 2021, when Applicant began his current employment and earned more
income,  he  again  enrolled  with  the  DCC  to  resolve  his delinquencies.  Since  that  time,
he  has  paid  at  least  $832  per month  to  the  DCC  toward  the  resolution  of  all  his  SOR
debts and two other delinquent accounts not included in the SOR. Since he re-enrolled
with the DCC in 2021, he has paid over $15,000 towards the settlement of the enrolled
accounts. He has since paid three of the five SOR debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.d, and 1.e) and
two  credit-card  accounts  not  listed  in  the  SOR.  His  intention  is  to  continue  to  pay  the
DCC  to  negotiate  and  settle  the  remaining  SOR  debts  (SOR  ¶¶  1.b  and  1.c)  on  his
behalf. He is not delinquent on any other accounts. (Tr. 42-78, 165-174; Answer; GE 1,
3-6, 10, 11; AE A)
In  August  2008,  while  he  was  serving  in  the  Army  and  deployed  abroad,
Applicant’s  command  found  that  he  had  created  a  toxic  work  environment  for  his
subordinates. His command disciplined him with an Article 15 under the Uniform Code
of Military Justice (UCMJ). He forfeited part of his pay, and he had to serve extra duty.
His command also disqualified him for the Good Conduct Medal for that deployment. He
claimed that this discipline resulted from a personality clash with one of his leaders who
Applicant believes created the toxic work environment. He also claimed that an Article
15  is  not  a  serious  punishment  because  it  is  non-judicial,  is  often  used  for  “minor
conduct issues,” and that the Army requires the destruction of Article 15 documentation
no  more  than  two  years  after  the  punishment  is  imposed.  He  also  provided  positive
character reference  letters from soldiers who served  with him on this deployment.  (Tr.
78-81, 174-181; Answer; GE 3; AE B)
In April 2012, Applicant inappropriately certified an Army Physical Fitness Score
Card (APFSC). Despite knowing he was required to witness a soldier’s physical fitness
test  to  sign  an  APFSC,  he  signed  one  of  his  subordinate  soldier’s  APFSC  without
witnessing  the  fitness  test.  When  his  command  learned  that  the  soldier  had,  in  fact,
failed  his physical  fitness  test, Applicant  was  disciplined under Article  15  of the  UCMJ
for  a  violation  of  Article  107.  He  claimed  that  he  signed  the  APFSC  as  a  favor  to  the
soldier,  who  he  trusted,  based  upon  that  soldier’s  misrepresentations  to  him  and  the
soldier’s past physical fitness test results. When he signed the APFSC,  he claimed he
did not know that the contents on the card were inaccurate. However, he acknowledged
that  he  should  not  have  signed  it  without  witnessing  the  soldier’s  physical  fitness  test.
He  was  reducted  in  rank,  forfeited  part  of  his  pay  for  two  months,  and  ordered  to
perform extra duty. He claimed that, as a result of this incident, he learned to trust but
verify and that he has not falsified a document since then. (Tr. 81-95, 181-184; Answer;
GE 3, 9)
In  about  May  2019,  after  an  AR  15-6  investigation,  Applicant’s  commanding
officer  (COL  A)  found  that  Applicant  engaged  in  sexual  harassment  while  he  was
instructing  Reserve  Officers’  Training  Corps  (ROTC)  cadets  as  a  supervisor  on  a
college campus. He vehemently denies that he engaged in any behavior that could be
considered  sexual  harassment,  but  he  acknowledged  engaging  in  unprofessional
conduct. He claimed that the decision to conduct the AR 15-6 investigation  was made
after an  Army Captain  made a complaint  to Applicant’s  superior officer  (COL  B) about
Applicant’s conduct towards a female cadet during a large ROTC training exercise. He
claimed that the Army Captain made this complaint despite the cadet in question saying
that  she  had  no  issues  or  complaints  about  Applicant’s  behavior.  (Tr.  95-97,  106-107,
113-118, 184-202, 206-211; Answer; GE 3, 7-9)
Based   upon   the   Army  Captain’s  complaint,  COL   B   tasked   Master  Sergeant
(MSG)   C  with   gathering   information   to   determine   whether  COL   B   should   pass  the
information   up   his   chain  of   command   for  a   formal  AR  15-6  investigation.   Applicant
claimed  that  he  did not get along  with  either COL  B  or MSG C and  both  may have  had
ulterior  motives   with   respect   to   their   role.   For  example,  Applicant  had   been   sent  to
replace  MSG C, but MSG C stayed, creating an  uncomfortable work  environment where
MSG C saw  Applicant  as a  rival.  Applicant claimed  that  MSG  C  coached  and  pressured
witnesses,   thus  unfairly  biasing   the   resulting   investigation   and   findings.   However,  he
does not claim  that COL  A  had  any  ulterior motives  or was biased  towards him.  (Tr.  97-
102, 106-110, 184-202, 226-228; Answer; GE 3, 7-9)
The AR  15-6 investigation  revealed that,  while many cadets had no  issues  with
Applicant’s  behavior  towards  them,  several  female  ROTC  cadets  at  the  college  were
made  to  feel  uncomfortable  by  comments  he  made  about  their  appearance  and  the
manner in which he said  them.  At  least  one of  these  cadets said his comments made
her  sick  to  her  stomach.  Several  claimed  that  they  avoided  him  based  upon  how
uncomfortable he made them feel. The investigating officer found that Applicant had not
engaged in actions that could be considered sexual harassment, but that Applicant did
engage  in  inappropriate  and  unprofessional  conduct.  However,  COL  A  disagreed  and
found  that  Applicant  had  engaged  in  sexual  harassment  towards  female  cadets.  (Tr.
113-118, 184-202, 206-211; Answer; GE 3, 8)
In April 2019, Applicant signed a developmental counseling form acknowledging
that  he  was  being  counseled  for  inappropriate  behavior  towards  cadets.  He  further
acknowledged  that  he  was  being  removed  as  a  cadet  instructor  and  that  he  was  not
permitted to be alone with female cadets until further notice. I find this action constitutes
him  being  “disciplined  for  misconduct.”  He  certified  a  statement  from  the  summary  of
one of his security interviews that he also received a Letter of Reprimand (LOR), but he
later testified that he did not receive an official LOR. After COL A made his findings after
the  conclusion  of  the  AR  15-6  investigation,  Applicant  had  an  opportunity  to  appeal
those findings. He did not appeal because the result of not appealing was that the Army
would reassign him to another role, which is what he desired. After waiving his appeal,
he was removed from his role at the college because he could no longer hold a special
trust authority role. However, he also testified that he was not formally disciplined, and
that he  was permitted to be around cadets unsupervised  after the AR 15 investigation
concluded if it was incidental to tasks he was assigned. However, the action removing
him  as  a  cadet  supervisor  and  the  order  prohibiting  his  interaction  with  female  cadets
unsupervised  was  never  formally  lifted.  Despite  these  actions  and  the  sexual
harassment  finding,  COL  B  sent  Applicant  to  supervise  ROTC  cadets  at  a  six-week
training  course  during  the  summer  of  2019,  because  MSG  C  did  not  want  to  attend.
Applicant claims that this fact tends to show that COL B and MSG C knew that the AR
15-6  investigation  findings  were  unfounded. (Tr.  111-113,  120-132,  153-154,  189-202,
206-212, 224, 229-230; Answer, GE 3, 7, 8)
In August 2019, in relation to his security  clearance eligibility, Applicant wrote a
memorandum  entitled,  Matters  for  Consideration  for  Secret  Security  Clearance
Adjudication  Decision  (2019  Memo)  and  sent  it  to  the  Department  of  Defense
Consolidated  Adjudications  Facility  (DOD  CAF),  now  the  Department  of  Defense
Counterintelligence  and  Security  Agency  Consolidated  Adjudication  Services  (DCSA
CAS).  In  the  2019  Memo,  among  other  things,  he  wrote  that  the  May  2019  sexual
harassment  finding  was  the  “only  allegation  of  misconduct  during  my  entire  military
career.”  Immediately after this sentence, he more specifically stated that he had never
been  the  recipient  of  an  Army  Sexual  Harassment/Assault  Response  and  Prevention
(SHARP) complaint. Therefore, in the 2019 Memo, he claimed that he had not had any
other  allegations  of  misconduct  and  he  had  never  had  a  SHARP  complaint.  This
statement that he had no other allegations of  misconduct was inaccurate, as the Army
disciplined him for misconduct in 2008 and 2012, as referenced herein. He claimed that
he mistakenly wrote this sentence and meant to write that he had not been disciplined
before or after in the context of a SHARP allegation. However, he specifically made that
statement in the next sentence, which would have made the first sentence superfluous if
he  truly  was  limiting  the  scope  to  the  SHARP  context.  He  claimed  that  he  is  a  poor
writer and the words he wrote are not what he meant. He also asserted that he did not
intend  to  mislead  or  deceive  by  making  this  statement  and  that  he  assumed  that  his
Army  records  were  readily  available  to  the  DOD  CAF.  (Tr.  141-147,  179,  202-204;
Answer; GE 3, 9)
With respect to his role as an ROTC cadet supervisor, Applicant certified that he
had not received a written warning and had not been  disciplined for misconduct in the
workplace  in  the  last  seven  years  on  his  certified  Electronic  Questionnaire  for
Investigations Processing dated December 14, 2021 (2021 SF 86). He was required to
divulge  this  information  as  a  result  of  the  2019  sexual  harassment  finding  and  the
discipline  for  misconduct  he  received  of  not  being  permitted  to  interact  with  female
cadets,  and his  subsequent  removal from his  post.  He claimed that  he did not divulge
this information because he had not been formally disciplined or suspended as a result
of the AR 15-6 investigation. He also claimed that he misread the plain meaning of the
questions in the 2021 SF 86 and thought that he was only required to divulge security
violations.  Finally,  he  assumed  that  his  Army  records  were  readily  available  to  those
making  decisions  about  his  security  clearance  eligibility.  He  claimed  that  he  never
meant  to  hide  information,  or  to  mislead  or  deceive  when  he  failed  to  divulge  this
information.  He  did  not  volunteer  this  discipline  or  suspension  before  the  DOD
investigator confronted him with it during his January 2022 security interview. During a
follow-up  interview  with  another  DOD  investigator  in  April  2022,  Applicant  was
forthcoming  with  information  regarding  the  2019  AR  15-6  investigation.  (Tr.  135-141,
204-217; Answer; GE 1, 3, 7, 8)
Authorized  DOD  investigators  interviewed  Applicant  on  January  14,  2022,
January  18,  2022,  and  April  6,  2022.  These  investigators  drafted  summaries  of  the
interviews they conducted with him. The investigator who drafted the summary from the
January 28, 2022 interview wrote that Applicant told him that Applicant did not have any
disciplinary issues before or after he was a supervisor of ROTC cadets. On August 14,
2022,  he  certified,  in  writing,  that  he  made  this  statement  to  the  investigator.  He
appended  to  this  certification  over  250  pages  of  additional  documents.  Therefore,  it  is
hard to believe that he rushed through this certification or did not provide it the attention
it deserved. Despite this certification, he later claimed that, as with his similar statement
in the 2019 Memo, he had only meant that he did not have other disciplinary issues in
the context of SHARP allegations. He claimed that he did not intend to imply that he had
no  other  disciplinary  actions  in  the  Army.  Despite  certifying  other  similar  statements
about  his  lack  of  Army  discipline  in  his  interview  summaries,  he  claimed  that  the
investigators either misquoted him or he misunderstood the scope of their questions. He
also  claimed  that  he  made  mistakes  by  not  clarifying  or  appending  some  of  the
statements  from  his  security  interviews  that  he  certified.  (Tr.  147-162,  179,  213-217;
Answer; GE 3)
Applicant   cited   to   the   fact   that   he   disclosed   the   aforementioned   2012   UCMJ
Article  15   discipline   in   his  March  20,  2017   Electronic  Questionnaire  for  Investigations
Processing   (2017   SF  86)   as   evidence   that  he   was   not  trying   to   hide  his  prior  Army
discipline.   He   also   claimed   that   he   thought  anyone   making  a  decision   regarding   his
security clearance  eligibility would  have  access to  his military records, so  he  assumed
that  anything  he  did  not disclose  would  be  readily available.  He  provided  a  plethora of
positive  whole-person  evidence  in  the  form  of  character-reference  letters,  his  testimony,
the   testimony  of  one  of  his friends  who   is also  a   former Army  colleague   and   superior,
and  his  almost   exclusively  positive   Army   performance   evaluations.   The   individual   who
testified  at hearing  on  Applicant’s  behalf felt so  strongly about  Applicant’s character that
he   paid  for  an   airline   ticket  and   flew  to   the   hearing   from   out  of  state.  Applicant’s
character   evidence,  that   at   least  36   individuals   provided,   reflects   that   he   is   honest,
reliable,   hard-working,   of   good   moral   character,  and   loves  his  country.   Many   of   those
who   provided   character  references   are  current  or  former   servicemembers   and   some
hold  security  clearances.   Some   were  ROTC   cadets  under  Applicant’s  supervision.
Nearly all  these  individuals opined  that they  believe  Applicant should keep  his security
clearance.   Applicant  also  received   numerous  commendations  and   awards   throughout
his  military  career.   He   has   also   earned   many   professional  awards   and   has  been
commended  for his performance  with  his current  employer.  (Tr.  31-32, 35-41,  135, 145-
147, 162-163, 205-206, 220-235; Answer; GE 2, 3; AE B)
Applicant  provided  evidence  that  he  received  mental  health  counseling  from  a
Doctor  of  Psychology  for  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD)  between  2017  and
2021.  This  counselor  opined  that  Applicant  does  not  suffer  from  a  mental  health
condition that would impair his judgment, and that she believed he should be permitted
to  hold  a  security  clearance.  She  noted  that  he  was  receptive  to  her  counseling  and
proactive in implementing it. (Tr.134-135; Answer; GE 3)
