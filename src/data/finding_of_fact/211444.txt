Applicant  is  a  53-year-old  married  man  with  two  adult  children  and  two  adult
stepchildren. He has a high school education. Since April 2021, he has been working for
a defense contractor as an electrical foreman. (Item 2 at 12)
The SOR alleges that Applicant owes approximately $29,753 in delinquent federal
income taxes for tax years 2013, 2014, 2017, and 2018, and that he owes approximately
$885  in  delinquent  state  income  taxes  for  tax  years  2017,  2018,  and  2019.  (Item  1)
Applicant did not incur these debts as a result of an inability to afford his tax debts, or due
to  procrastination.  Rather,  he  was  unaware  that  he  owed  these  debts  until  an  audit
revealed the shortfall in July 2021. (Item 3 at 2) He attributed the debt to tax software that
he used to assist with filing his tax returns that miscalculated what he owed. (Item 3 at 7)
Subsequently, Applicant hired an accountant to help negotiate a payment plan. (Item 4 at
2) Under the plan, Applicant has been making $600 monthly payments since November
2021.  (Item  5)  As  a  result,  he  has  reduced  the  delinquency  by  $12,800.  Although  he
stated  that  he  is  on  a  payment  plan  to  satisfy  his  state  income  tax  delinquency,  he
provided no supporting evidence.
Moving forward, Applicant will continue to utilize an accountant to help him file his
income tax returns. Applicant has no issues with financial hardship, as he earns $67 per
hour, nearly triple what he earned in his previous job. (Item 3 at 3)
