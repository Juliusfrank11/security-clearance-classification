The facts in this case are not always clear as Applicant is a poor historian, either
from poor memory, inattention to detail, prevarication, or a combination of those factors.
Applicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his  current  employer  for  about  six  years.  He  has  worked  overseas  for  defense
contractors  since  2015.  He  has  held  a  security  clearance  since  about  2015.  He
attended college for a period without earning a degree. He has never married, and he
has no children. (Tr.1 at 19-20, 32-33, 62; GE 1, 3, 4; AE F, I-M)
Sometime before 2015, Applicant met a woman (Ms. A) on Facebook who was a
citizen  and  resident  of  Ethiopia.  They  were  friends  who  regularly  communicated  by
electronic  means  but  were  not  in  a  romantic  relationship.  It  is  unclear  when  Applicant
met her because he gave differing times: 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014. He stated
that  he  met  her  when  he  was  working  for  a  specific  employer.  He  reported  on  his
October 2014 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) that he worked for
that  employer  from  March  2002  to  May  2012.  I  believe  he  met  her  online  in  2012  or
earlier. (Tr.1 at 29, 39-40; Tr.2 at 28-32, 40-42; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3; AE
C)
Applicant  reported  in  the  October  2014  SF  86  that  he  started  working  for  a
defense contractor in September 2014. He was sponsored by the defense contractor to
work  overseas,  but  he  had  not  started  working  yet.  He  reported  that  he  had  a  vehicle
repossessed  in  2014.  He  indicated  the  matter  was  resolved  because  he  returned  the
vehicle. He did not report any foreign contacts. (GE 4)
Applicant was interviewed for his background investigation in January 2015.  He
stated that he was supposed to start work for the contractor at the end of January 2015,
and he was scheduled to work overseas. He did not discuss any foreign contacts. (GE
5)
Applicant  started  working  overseas  for  a  defense  contractor  in  2015.  At  some
point his relationship with Ms. A changed, and he felt they were in a boyfriend-girlfriend
relationship.  He  stated  that  occurred  in  late  December  2014.  He  visited  Ms.  A  in
Ethiopia  on  three  to  four  occasions.  The  exact  dates  are  unclear.  A  background
investigator viewed Applicant’s passport in August 2021. It revealed that Applicant had
30-day  visas  to  Ethiopia  in  August  2015,  March  2016,  December  2016,  and  August
2017.  The report of investigation noted that there were five 30-day visas and reported
the same visa from December 2016 twice. It is possible that this was an error, and that
the last visa was from December 2017. The investigator reported that there were other
visas,  and  entry  and  exit  stamps  in  the  passport,  but  they  were  illegible.  Applicant
admitted that he traveled to Ethiopia three to four times, with the last trip in December
2016 or 2017. He traveled to India for tourism in 2017. (Tr1. at 19, 40, 42-43, 66; Tr.2 at
14, 28-30, 37-39; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 3; AE C, D, F)
Applicant  sent  money  to  Ms. A. He  stated  that she  was unemployed,  and  he  sent
her  $100  every  month for about one  and a half years to pay her rent.  He also stated that
he  sent her around  $7,000  to  $8,000  for a  medical issue. He estimated  that he  sent  her
about $12,000  to $13,000  total. He sent the money through Western  Union, and  he  also
sent money to  his mother in the  United  States by Western  Union.  He  and Ms.  A  broke
up   in  about  2017.  He has  had   no  further contact  with  her,  and   he   has  not  returned   to
Ethiopia  since  they  broke  up. (Tr.1  at 29-31,  40-46,  72-73; Tr.2  at 33-36,  43-44, 48, 54-
55; Applicant’s response  to  SOR; GE 3; AE  C)
Applicant  met  another  Ethiopian  citizen  (Ms.  B)  online.  He  gave  conflicting
information  about  when  he  met  her.  In  his  SOR  response,  he  stated  that  he  met  her
online before he went to work overseas in 2015. He later testified that he met her online
after his first trip to Ethiopia. He considered her a pen pal. He visited her and her family
during  one of  his trips to  Ethiopia. She  worked  for an  airline.  They maintain  electronic
communication,  and  he  met  her  in  Dubai  a  few  times  when  they  were  both  traveling
through. She  now lives  in  Spain. They are friends only,  with no  romantic  interests. He
sent  her about  $1,500.  Part of  that  was a  wedding  gift  for her sister,  and part  went  to
pay her back for helping him when he was in Ethiopia. (Tr.1 at 29-31, 41, 54-60; Tr.2 at
45-46; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2; AE A)
Applicant submitted another SF 86 in May 2021. There were many inaccuracies
in  the  questionnaire,  including  his  education,  employment  history,  and  work  location
overseas. He answered “no” to questions in the foreign section that asked:
Section 19 - Foreign Contacts
A foreign national is defined as any person who is not a citizen or national
of the U.S.
Do  you   have,  or  have   you   had,   close   and/or  continuing   contact   with   a
foreign   national  within the   last seven   (7) years   with   whom   you,  or your
spouse,  or  legally  recognized   civil  union/domestic  partner,  or  cohabitant
are  bound   by   affection,  influence,  common   interests,  and/or  obligation?
Include  associates as well as relatives, not  previously listed in Section 18.
Section 20A  –  Foreign  Activities
Foreign Financial Interests - Foreign National Support
Have you EVER provided financial support for any foreign national?
Section 20C  – Foreign  Travel
Have you traveled outside the U.S. in the last seven (7) years?
The answers to the above questions were all false because in the previous seven
years, Applicant had  close  and continuing contact with Ms. A; he financially supported
Ms. A; and he traveled for personal reasons to Ethiopia and India.
Applicant  was  interviewed  for  his  background  investigation  in  July  2021.  He
stated that he traveled to Ethiopia in December 2016 to January 2017 for 20 to 30 days
to visit his foreign girlfriend, Ms. A. He stated that he traveled to India in August 2017 for
6 to 10 days for tourism. He stated that he did not report his foreign travel because he
forgot  about  it,  and  he  thought  all  his  foreign  travel  was  for  government  business.  He
discussed  the  funds  he  sent  to  Ms.  A  after  the  investigator  questioned  him  about  the
transactions.  He  stated  that  his  relationship  with  Ms.  A  ended  in  December  2017
because  things  did  not  work  out,  she  was  lazy,  and  he  was  embarrassed  by  the
relationship. He also discussed his relationship with Ms. B. (Tr.1 at 43; GE 3)
Applicant  denied  intentionally  providing  false  information  on  the  2014  and  2021
SF  86s.  He  stated  in  his  response  to  the  SOR  that  he  did  not  list  Ms.  A  and  Ms.  B
because  he  did  not  consider  them  to  be  foreign  nationals.  His  illogical  argument  was
that if he knew them before he needed a security clearance then “I wouldn’t call those
people foreign national[s] because I knew them in a different setting, and they were my
friend[s].” (Tr.1 at 36-39; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 3)
Applicant stated that he did not list Ms. A on the 2014 SF 86 because they were
just  friends  at  that  time.  (Tr.1  at  29;  AE  I) I am  not  convinced  by substantial  evidence
that Applicant intentionally provided false information on that questionnaire.1
Applicant testified that information from the 2014 SF 86 did not repopulate in the
2021 SF 86, and he had to complete the 2021 questionnaire “from scratch.” He did not
have all the  information  to fill  it out,  but he did  the  best he could.  He  admitted that he
“probably just  pencil-whipped  it  and  guessed  just  to  submit  it.”  He  stated  that  he  filled
out another SF 86 in 2020 or 2022 that had the correct information. He did not submit a
copy  of  a  third  SF  86,  and  Department  Counsel  was  unable  to  locate  one.  There  are
many  identical phrases  in  the  2014  and  2021  SF 86s  (see  e.g.,  sections  11,  13A,  16,
and 18). I find that the 2021 SF 86 repopulated with information from  the 2014 SF 86.
(Tr.1 at 21-25, 37; Tr.2 at 37; AE H)
Applicant stated that he did not list his foreign travel on the 2021 SF 86 because
he was living overseas  at the time and was traveling to  a lot of countries for work. He
also stated that he was living on a U.S. military installation, so he thought of it like it was
part of the United States. He did not think about his trips to Ethiopia and India when he
filled  out  the  SF  86,  but  he  let  his  company  security  manager  know  about  the  trips
before and after he took them  and that he was going to visit his girlfriend.  A coworker
confirmed  that  it  was  required  to  inform  security  about  any  leave  taken  to  foreign
countries.  The  coworker  wrote  that  he  and  other  employees  knew  that  Applicant  was
going to Ethiopia to meet a Facebook friend. (Tr.1 at 34-39, 50, 62-63; Tr.2 at 17-25, 40;
AE D, E, I, J)
Applicant stated  that he  did not list Ms. A  on  the  2021  SF 86  because  he  did not
consider  a   friend   to   be   a   foreign   national.  He  stated   that  he   did   not   list  her  and   the
financial support he  provided  her because  the  SF 86  said  to  only go  back  seven  years.
He  stated  that he  was  done  with  her and  no  longer wanted  to  think about her. He was
adamant  he   discussed   her   during   his  background   interview   in  2015.  He  stated   “[t]hat
man   sent   me   a   copy   of  our  interview  and   in   that   interview  I   told   him   about   [Ms.   A].”
There is  nothing  in the  ROI  of  the  2015  interview about  Ms.  A.  He  testified  that he  broke
up   with   her  because   he   was  embarrassed   by  the   relationship   because   she   was   lazy,
and   she   did  not  grow.   Department  Counsel  then   asked.”   Do  you   think  maybe   that
embarrassment  might be  why  you  didn’t  mention  her on  your electronic questionnaire?”
to  which  Applicant  replied, “Probably so, honestly, being  honest  with  you.”   (Tr.1  at 43-
44, 47-50, 63-64, 72-73; Tr.2  at 26-27, 37, 44, 55-56; Applicant’s response  to  SOR; GE
1-3; AE  G, I, K)
1  Substantial   evidence  is   “such  relevant  evidence  as   a  reasonable  mind   might   accept  as   adequate  to
support a conclusion in light of  all  the  contrary  evidence in the same  record.” See, e.g.,  ISCR  Case  No.
17-04166   at  3  (App.  Bd.  Mar.  21,  2019)   (citing  Directive  ¶   E3.1.32.1).   “This   is   something   less   than  the
weight  of  the   evidence,  and   the  possibility   of  drawing   two  inconsistent  conclusions   from   the   evidence
does  not prevent [a Judge’s]  finding  from   being  supported by  substantial  evidence.”  Consolo v.  Federal
Maritime  Comm’n,  383  U.S. 607,  620 (1966).  “Substantial  evidence” is  “more than  a  scintilla  but  less  than
a preponderance.”  See v. Washington  Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36  F.3d  375,  380  (4th  Cir. 1994);  ISCR
Case No.  04-07187  at  5 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2006).
I  did  not  find  Applicant  credible.  After  considering  all  the  evidence,  including
Applicant’s  age,  education,  experience,  admissions,  inconsistent  responses,  and  the
illogical  rationale  for  the  incorrect  information  on  the  2021  SF  86,  I  find  by  substantial
evidence  that  he  intentionally  provided  false  information  on  the  2021  SF  86,  as
discussed further in the analysis.
