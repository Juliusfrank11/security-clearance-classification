Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. Her admissions have been
incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings,
testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  42  years  old.  She  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2002.  She  is  not
married  and  has  no  children.  She  was  in  a  cohabitational  relationship  from  2004  until
approximately 2019. She has been employed by her present employer since November
2021. When she began this employment, she earned $110,000 per year, and it increased
incrementally, and she now earns $115,000 per year as of July 2023. (Tr. 23-25, 30)
Applicant completed a National Security Questionnaire (SF 86) in June 2021. She
reported a period of unemployment from November 2019 to March 2020. She had been
employed from May 2019 to November 2019 and reported on her SF 86: “Left by mutual
agreement following notice of unsatisfactory performance. I was not happy about traveling
for my position.” She testified that she voluntarily left this job because she did not want to
get a corporate credit card, which was required for travel. She did not have another job
lined up before she left this employment. She secured a job in March 2020, with Company
A and earning about $98,000. (Tr. 23-30; GE 1, 2)
In December 2020, Applicant left the employment of Company A for a job that paid
a  higher  salary.  She  began  employment  with  Company  B.  In  August  2021,  she  was
terminated from her job at Company B for breach of contract due to various infractions.
She testified that she was aware of the termination but disputed some of the reasons.
She  admitted  to  receiving  verbal  reprimands.  She  further  testified  that  she  does  not
dispute that she was terminated from her job at Company B, but she said she was also
told  she  could  apply  for  another  job  within  the  company.  She  testified  that  she  was
unemployed for a few weeks and then started a job with another company and worked
there  from  September  2021  through  October  2021,  prior  to  starting  her  present  job  in
November 2021. (Tr. 23-30, 57, 60-64; GE 1, 2)
Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator in September 2021. She
disclosed to the investigator that she no longer worked at Company B and had left the job
for better opportunities, pay and benefits. She did not disclose she was terminated from
the job. (GE 2)
In January 2022, Applicant was interviewed again by a government investigator.
She was presented with an opportunity to discuss and confirm her employment history.
She confirmed that in the last seven years she had not been fired from a job, quit a job
after being told she would be fired, left a job by mutual agreement following allegations of
misconduct or following notice of unsatisfactory performance, received a written warning,
been reprimanded, suspended, or disciplined for misconduct in the workplace at any of
her  employments.  She  did  not  disclose  her  termination  from  Company  B.  She  was
confronted by the investigator with her August 2021 termination and she explained that
she did not report this information when interviewed in September 2021 because she was
embarrassed.  She  previously  said  she  left  Company  B  on  good  terms.  She  was
confronted by the investigator with the various infractions, and she admitted most of them
at  that  time.  During  her  hearing,  she  clarified,  explained,  or  disputed  some  of  the
infractions.  She  said  she  is  embarrassed  about  her  behavior  during  this  time.  She
admitted she was untruthful. (Tr. 30, 37, 39-40, 64-72; GE 2)
Applicant  testified  that  during  this  time,  she  was  going  through  relationship
problems  that  began  in  2018,  and  she  was  struggling  emotionally.  She  was  working
remotely due to the pandemic, and she was having difficulty adjusting. She admitted she
did  not  handle  herself  very  well,  and  it  impacted  her  work.  She  testified  that  she  was
aware of her duty to disclose that she was terminated from employment with Company B
when  she  was  asked  about  it.  She  deliberately  falsified  material  facts  during  her
interviews with a government investigator. (Tr. 30, 37, 39, 64-72; GE 2)
Applicant testified that her personal issues with her partner impacted her life and
her  work.  At  the  time,  she  was  trying  to  save  her  relationship  and  put  her  life  back
together. She quit one job and was not performing well at another. When she quit her job,
her only income was unemployment benefits, which were insufficient for her to pay her
bills. She testified that her debts became delinquent in approximately November 2019,
when she stopped making payments. She and her partner separated around 2019. She
did not reach out to any of her creditors when she stopped paying her accounts in 2019.
(Tr. 30-31, 37, 42-43)
Applicant  testified  that  she  pays  her  ex-partner’s  monthly  car  payment  of
approximately $416 and many of her living expenses. Her ex-partner worked sporadically
and  occasionally  contributed  to  the  household  expenses  throughout  their  relationship
which  began  about  2004,  but  Applicant  was  primarily  responsible  for  the  household
expenses. Applicant purchased a house in 2005 and was solely responsible for paying
the mortgage. In August 2021, she sold the house so she could give her ex-partner the
profit of approximately $42,000. When questioned why she gave the entire profit to her
ex-partner  when  she  had  delinquent  debts,  she  said  it  was  because  she  had  made  a
verbal agreement with her to give her the money because she had been unfaithful to her.
(Tr. 37, 49-54, 75-85)
During the pandemic, Applicant’s partner drove her car to a distant state. Applicant
went to pick her up and they left the vehicle there. They decided not to retrieve it for about
11 months because at the time there were certain border restrictions due to the pandemic.
Applicant rented a car for her ex-partner from about February 2020 until December 2020
when they retrieved the other vehicle. She estimated the monthly cost of the vehicle was
approximately  $600-$700.  This  impacted  her  ability  to  pay  her  other  debts.  She  was
asked if she started making payments on her delinquent debts when she stopped paying
for the rental car and when her salary increased. She said no because other things were
going on in her personal life. She and her partner were trying to figure out how to separate,
which they are still trying to do. (Tr. 37. 44-49)
Applicant lives in a hotel with her dog. Her ex-partner also lives in the same hotel.
Applicant pays for both hotel rooms, and they have lived there for about two years. She
testified that she pays about $3,200 a month for the two rooms. When asked why she did
not  rent  an  apartment,  she  explained  it  was  unaffordable  with  the  extra  deposits  and
startup costs of getting an apartment. She stated that despite the fact  she and her ex-
partner have been separated for an extended period, she continues to financially support
her. She said her ex-partner has some medical issues. She is not on disability. Her ex-
partner shares the expenses for the dog. (Tr. 37, 49-57)
Applicant testified that she has no savings or money in her accounts. After paying
all her living expenses and some of her ex-partners, she has about $100 left. She does
not  have  investments.  She  said  she  withdrew  the  money  she  had  in  an  individual
retirement account years ago. She has not participated in financial counseling in the past
ten years but had some before then. (Tr. 54-56)
The SOR alleged six delinquent debts totaling approximately $24,207. Applicant
settled the credit card debt in SOR ¶ 1.e ($2,714) in May 2023 for $1,085, after receiving
the SOR. She provided documentary proof of the settlement. (Tr. 31-33; GE 3, 4, 5; AE
A).
In May 2023, Applicant contacted the creditor for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.d ($8,927)
and made a payment arrangement to make monthly payments of $483 to settle the debt
for $5,800. She has made the required payments to date. (Tr. 31, 35-36; GE 3, 4, 5; AE
H)
Applicant has not contacted  the creditors or resolved the  debts alleged in SOR  ¶¶
1.a   ($2,112);   1.b   ($8,978);   1.c  ($1,056);   and   1.f   ($2,714).  She   admitted   that  she   was
irresponsible   when   she   quit  her job   in  2019   without  first having   a  plan   or job   in   place.
These  debts have  been  delinquent since  late  2019. She  stated  that she  still  has two  more
payments on  her partner’s car to  pay and  that will  free  up  money,  and  then  she  will  be
able to begin to  address her remaining delinquent debts. (Tr. 36-37; GE 2, 3, 4, 5)
Applicant testified that she failed to have sufficient tax withholdings taken during
tax year 2021 and ended up owing about $3,200 in taxes to the IRS. After completion of
her tax returns and becoming aware of her debt, she contacted the IRS and entered into
an  installment  agreement  to  pay  $85  a  month  for  three  years.  She  is  current  on  her
payments.  She  owed  taxes  for  2022  ($1,600)  and  paid  them.  These  payments  have
impacted her ability to make payments towards her delinquent debts. (Tr. 33-35, 75; AE
C, D, E)
Applicant  provided  her  performance  evaluations  and  awards  she  has  received.
She explained she is now back to being a focused and dedicated employee and her work
issues are behind her. She is remorseful for being terminated from her job and said her
personal life was impacting her at that time. She is working hard at her job that she loves,
and she is sought after for her expertise. She feels she is climbing out of a difficult period
in her life, and she does not want to repeat it. She is trying to support her partner. She
wants to pay her debts and has chosen as her top priority to pay the IRS before paying
other debts. (Tr. 60-70, 74; AE F, G, I, J)
