Applicant  admitted  the allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a, 1.b, and 1.d  through  1.j.  She
denied  SOR  ¶  1.c.  Her  admissions  are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a
thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 41 years old. She earned an associate degree in 2015. She married
in 2015 and has two children from the marriage, ages two and five. She has two other
children  from  previous  relationships,  ages  14  and  22.  The  elder  child  is  financially
independent. She also has an adopted daughter who was her mother’s foster child. When
her mother passed away the daughter was adopted. She said they have more of a sister
relationship. She is 25 years old and independent. She also has a stepson who lives with
his mother. She does not receive court-ordered child support for her 14-year-old but the
father gives the child money. Her husband does the same for his child. (Tr. 14-18, 47)
Applicant  operated  a  home  daycare  from  2009  until  she  closed  it  in  November
2018.  She  then  had  temporary  jobs  until  she  obtained  full-time  employment  in  March
2019. She worked for a foster care agency for about two years. She helped place foster
children in homes, but when the pandemic hit, the services were reduced and she was
laid off in July 2021. She started her current job with a federal contractor in October 2021.
Applicant’s husband has been employed since 2016. (Tr. 18-20, 35-37)
Applicant attributes her financial problems to unemployment and to family issues.
Her mother-in-law had cancer, and she and her husband helped her with medical bills.
Her  mother-in-law  did  not  have  insurance.  They  overextended  themselves  to  help  her
maintain her obligations because she was unable to work. She passed away in January
2020. They also had two other family members pass away and they felt an obligation to
help. (Tr. 23-24
Applicant testified that she had been making consistent payments on the debt in
SOR ¶ 1.a ($25,956) before she closed her daycare business in 2018. After the debt went
in collection status, she contacted the creditor to make a payment arrangement in about
June  2019  after  she  got  a  temporary  job.  She  made  payments  for  about  six  to  eight
months but then was unable because of family obligations. She contacted the creditor a
week before her hearing and is attempting to find the collection company that owns the
debt. She anticipated contacting them and working on a payment arrangement. She has
received settlement offers from other creditors and hopes to make payment arrangements
but is unable to at this time because she does not have the money. (Tr. 20-30)
Applicant current annual salary is approximately $36,000 to $38,000. At her prior
employment  she  earned  about  $31,000  and  was  an  hourly  employee.  During  the
pandemic for approximately six to eight months, her income was reduced. Her husband
earns  approximately  $20,000.   She   drives  for  Uber  when   she   can,   but  with   two   small
children   it   is  difficult.  Her  husband   works  the   night  shift  so   they   can   reduce   childcare
expenses and  one  of them  can  be  home. They have  no  savings,  but she  does have  a
401k  retirement  account   with   about  $2,000   in   it.  She   enrolled   in  a   debt  consolidation
program  in  about 2022  but decided  the  fees,  in addition  to  the  monthly payments,  were
too  expensive. She  has  contemplated  filing  for bankruptcy but cannot afford the  attorney’s
fees and  intends  to  research if  there is a  way to  do  so  with  reduced  legal fees.  Applicant
has  delayed   addressing   her  delinquent  bills   because   she   does   not  want  to   contact  a
creditor when she  does not have the  money to make a settlement offer or payment plan.
(Tr. 25, 33-47)
In  Applicant’s  September  2021  Electronic  Questionnaire  for  Investigations
Processing, she disclosed she had one debt that became delinquent in 2016 that she was
unable  to  pay  because  she  was  unemployed.  In  her  response  to  government
interrogatories, she provided proof that she paid a delinquent debt in April 2022. This debt
was not alleged in the SOR. She also said that she  was paying the debt in SOR ¶ 1.h
($733) but she did not provide proof that she made payments or resolved the debt. (Tr.
30-32; GE 1, 2)
Any derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will be not considered
for disqualifying purposes. It may be considered in the application of mitigating conditions,
in making a credibility determination and in a whole-person analysis.
The SOR alleged ten delinquent debts totaling approximately $46,746. None have
been  paid  or  resolved.  The  delinquencies  began  about  2015,  but  most  of  the  debts
became delinquent around  2017, 2018 and 2019. In her SOR answer,  she denied the
debt  in  ¶  1.c.  She  testified  that  she  is  responsible  for  this  debt.  She  confused  it  with
another account that was paid. Some creditors have offered settlement agreements, but
she is unable to accept them at this time. (Tr. 48-60)
The  debts  alleged  in  the  SOR  are  corroborated  by  Applicant’s  admissions,
testimony, responses to interrogatories, and credit reports from October 2021, May 2022,
and January 2023. (GE 1-5)
Applicant has approximately $56,000 in student loans that are in a deferred status
due to financial hardship. She has not made payments in five years. She recently received
notification that the pandemic deferral was expiring, but her  loans will  remain deferred
due to her financial status. (Tr. 60-61)
Applicant testified that she intends to pay her delinquent debts and wants to pay
them. Her husband testified on her behalf. He affirmed that their finances were impacted
due to deaths and illnesses in the family. He has been working extra hours to make more
money and is working parttime as a handyman. Recently his car transmission needed to
be replaced and it cost $4,800. It remains at the repair shop while he makes payments.
