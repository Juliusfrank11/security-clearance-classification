In Applicant’s response to the SOR, he admitted all allegations (SOR ¶¶ 1.a - 1.q),
without comment. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked with
his  current  employer  since  February  2016.  Additionally,  since  about  1999,  he  has
continuously  maintained  employment  in  a  part-time  position  on  weekends  with  a  non-
defense  employer.  He  earned  his  associate’s  degree  in  May  2010,  and  his  bachelor’s
degree in May 2012. He married in 1993 and has five children, ages 30, 21, 18, 9 and 7
years old. His wife does not work outside of the family home. (Items 3 and 4)
The  SOR  alleges  17  financial  concerns  including  three  Chapter  7  Bankruptcy
actions filed via voluntary petition in 1994, 2001, and 2015  (SOR ¶¶ 1.a - 1.c), in addition
to  14  delinquent  debts  altogether  totaling  about  $21,053.  Applicant’s  three  bankruptcy
filings  are  reflected  in  court  records  (Items  5,  6,  and  7),  and  his  delinquent  debts  are
reflected in credit bureau reports from May 2022 and March 2023. (Items 8 and 9)
In his May 2022 SCA, Applicant disclosed he filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition
in June 2015 and that his debts, which totaled about $20,000, were discharged in about
September  2015.  He  stated  he  was  overwhelmed  with  expenses  at  the  time  due  to
working while attending school. His wife was not working, he stated, because of childcare
expenses.  (Item  3  at  32,  and  Item  4  at  2)  During  his  July  2022  DOD  investigative
interview, Applicant did  not  disclose or discuss  his two previous Chapter 7 bankruptcy
petitions: one filed in July 1994 and discharged in November 1994; and the other filed in
October 2001 and discharged in February 2002. During the same interview, he disclosed
his  intent  to  possibly  file  another  bankruptcy  petition  in  August  2023  because,  as  he
stated, he would be eligible to file again after waiting about eight years. (Item 4 at 3)
Applicant disclosed that his monthly net income totaled about $3,664 for both his
full and part-time positions, and he estimated his monthly expenses, excluding credit card
debts not being paid, totaled about $4,000. He stated there were no plans for his wife to
start working because she takes care of their children, and her working would require him
to purchase another car. He further disclosed his wife handles the household finances,
and that she pays her own bills, but does not pay bills in his name. When asked about a
future financial plan, he stated that he hoped to reduced expenses when his older children
leave home, and he also hoped to have his student loans forgiven as well. His student
loans of about $40,000, were in a deferred status at the time of the interview. (Item 4 pp.
3-4)
The evidence regarding financial issues alleged in the SOR is summarized below.
SOR ¶¶  1.a  –  1.c  (Chapter 7  bankruptcy  petitions  of  1994, 2001,  and 2015): In
his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted to filing three separate voluntary petitions
under Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and having his debts discharged in each one. Bankruptcy
court records in Items 5, 6, and 7 support allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a. – 1.c., as admitted.
Applicant’s  multiple  bankruptcies  resulted  primarily  from  consumer  debts.  In  his  2001
bankruptcy  action,  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  and  the  Department  of  Justice
(DOJ) were among the listed creditors. (Item 6 at 4) The cause or amount of Applicant’s
indebtedness to these federal agencies is not provided in the record. (Item 6) Additionally,
Court records of his 2015 bankruptcy showed that his student loan debts actually totaled
more than $45,000 at that time. (Item 7 at 1)
SOR ¶¶  1.d  ($4,879),  1.e  ($3,278),  and 1.h  ($1,905) Applicant admitted all three
delinquent  debts.  For  each  debt,  he  exceeded  the  creditor-granted  credit  limit.  All
accounts were eventually charged off by the creditors after Applicant became 150 days
or more delinquent on required payments. (Item 8 pp. 3-4; and Item 9 pp. 4, 6, and 8)
These debts are unresolved.
SOR ¶ 1.i  ($1,419): Applicant admitted this debt. He opened this individual account
in  November  2017.  The  debt  was  charged  off  for  $1,419  in  about  March  2022  after  it
become150 days or more past due. (Item 8 at 4) The March 2023 credit bureau report
reflected  a  balance  of  $1,118,  and  a  payment  of  $150  in  February  2023.  Applicant
appears to have made repayment arrangements with the creditor, and has paid down the
balance of the debt by $301 in March 2023. (Item 9 at 7) This debt is being resolved.
SOR  ¶¶  1.f ($2,628)  and 1.g   ($2,611):   Applicant admitted  both debts.  Both are
individual accounts that have remained in a collection status since 2021 or earlier. The
last activity for both accounts occurred in 2019, with major delinquencies reported in 2021
and  2020  respectively.  (Item  8  pp.  3-4,  and  Item  9  pp.  5  and  7)  These  debts  are
unresolved.
SOR  ¶¶   1.j   ($1,418),   1.k   ($501),  and  1.l   ($467):   Applicant  admitted  all  three
delinquent debts. These three individual accounts have been in a collection status since
at  least  2021,  with  the  first  major  delinquencies  reported  on  all  accounts  between
December  2020  and  mid-2021.  (Item  8  at  5,  and  Item  9  pp.  5  - 7)  These  debts  are
unresolved.

payment on it in October 2021. The May 2022 credit bureau report indicated the debt was
120  days  past  due,  for  the  amount  of  $971.  The  creditor  ultimately  charged  off  this
delinquent debt for $6,531 in about February 2023. (Item 8 at 6, and Item 9 at 9) This
debt is unresolved.

for  $976  in  about  February  2023,  as  reported  in  the  March  2023  credit  bureau  report.
(Item 8 at 6, and Item 9 at 9) This debt is unresolved.
