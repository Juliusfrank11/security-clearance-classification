Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations, with explanations. He is 39 years old.
He married in 2012, divorced in 2018, and remarried in 2021. He has five minor children.
His eldest child is his ex-spouse’s niece that they adopted  from foster care during their
marriage; the next two children are from his first marriage; and the youngest two children
are from his current marriage. He graduated from high school in 2012. He has owned his
home since 2014. (Tr. 2 at 24-25, 28, 35-36, 42, 67-77; GE 1, 10)
As  of  the  date  of  the  hearing,  Applicant  has  worked  for  his  employer,  a  DOD
contractor, since July 2016. He began as a pipefitter and  then he became a nationally
certified radiographer in October 2020. He was first granted a security clearance in 2018.
(Tr. 1 at 5; Tr. 2 at 5-6, 24, 41-42, 87, 106)
The SOR alleged that Applicant had 13 delinquent debts, totaling $23,898 (SOR
¶¶ 1.a-1.m) It also alleged that he had six judgments, totaling $11,073, entered against
him between June 2017 and February 2021 (SOR ¶¶ 1.n-1.s). The SOR allegations are
established  by  his  admissions  in  his  Answer;  his  September  2021  security  clearance
application  (SCA);  credit  bureau  reports  from  June  2016,  December  2021,  and
September 2022; and court records. (Answer; GE 1-12)
Applicant attributed his delinquent debts to his April 2017 separation from his ex-
spouse, his August 2018 divorce, and minimal income. At a date not in the record,  a court
ordered that he and his ex-spouse share joint legal custody of their children but awarded
her physical custody and ordered him to pay her $135 weekly in child support.  At that
time, he earned $18 hourly as a pipefitter, and she earned approximately $20 hourly as
a  pharmacy  technician.  In  addition  to  paying  for  his  living  expenses  and  child  support
obligation, he was responsible for paying the mortgage. The divorce decree stated that
“[b]oth parents will pay their own credit card debts owed.” He prioritized his expenses and
fell  behind  on  his  debts.  He  elected  not  to  file  bankruptcy  because  he  wanted  to  take
responsibility for his debts. (Answer; Tr. 2 at 24-31, 36-37, 39-42, 44-45, 52-54, 56, 66,
86-87, 105-107; AE C, D, E)
In September 2022, the court awarded Applicant full custody of his children from
his  first  marriage  due  to  his  ex-spouse’s  medical  issues,  suspended  his  child-support
obligation, and did not order her to pay him child support. She passed away in June 2023.
Although he earned $36 hourly at that time, he was the sole breadwinner for his family,
as his spouse did not work outside of the home due to childcare costs and her medical
issues. In approximately 2021, he disputed his delinquent debts through Credit Karma to
determine  their  validity  and  contest  those  he  believed  belonged  to  his  ex-spouse.  He
subsequently intended to take steps to try to resolve the debts that were determined to
be his, but he was limited in his ability to do so because of his minimal income. (Answer;
Tr. 2 at 24-31, 36-37, 39-42, 44-45, 52-54, 56, 66, 79, 82-83, 85-86, 88-97; AE C, D, E)
Between April 2018 and May 2021, six wage garnishment orders were issued to
Applicant’s employer concerning his debts, as further discussed below. He consequently
believed that he was resolving his debts through wage garnishment, and he was unaware
he  could  contact  the  creditors  directly  to  resolve  his  debts  in  spite  of  the  wage
garnishment orders. He stated, “I thought once the Court order was in place, that’s what
it was.” He believed his only option was to file a modification of wage execution, which he
did, as further discussed below. (Answer; Tr. 2 at 24-31, 36-37, 39-42, 44-45, 52-54, 56,
66, 79, 82-83, 85-86, 88-97; GE 5-12; AE A)
SOR ¶ 1.a is an auto loan in collection for $8,803. Applicant co-signed this loan
with his ex-spouse during their marriage so that she could purchase a car. He felt that he
did not have to pay this debt since their divorce decree stated that she was responsible
for her debts. He was unaware of the status of this debt and stated that the creditor had
not  contacted  him  seeking  payment.  This  debt  is  reported  on  the  2021  credit  bureau
report. He did not provide documentation to show that he paid or otherwise resolved it.
(Tr. 2 at 30-31, 42-43; GE 3; AE C)
SOR ¶ 1.b is a credit card in collection for $2,637. Applicant obtained this credit
card in approximately 2015, and he used it for daily living expenses. This debt is reported
on  both  the  2021  and  2022  credit  bureau  reports,  and  the  latter  credit  bureau  report
reflects an outstanding balance of $2,425. He stated that this debt underlies the judgment
in SOR ¶ 1.p, as discussed below. (Tr. 2 at 29, 31-34, 43-47; GE 2, 3, 7, 8)
SOR  ¶  1.c  is  an  account  in  collection  for  $2,097.  Although  Applicant  recalled
having multiple accounts with the underlying creditor, he did not recognize this debt. This
debt is reported on the 2021 and 2022 credit bureau reports. He stated that the creditor
had  not  contacted  him  about  this  debt,  and  he  believed  it  may  be  among  the  debts
underlying the judgments in SOR ¶¶ 1.n and 1.o, as discussed below. This debt is with a
different collection agency than that in SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.j, 1.l., 1.n, and 1.o, and Applicant
did not provide documentation to corroborate his claim. (Tr. 2 at 47-48; GE 2, 3, 9, 12)
SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.j, and 1.l are three credit cards in collection for $2,068; $711; and
$481, respectively. These debts are reported on the 2021 credit bureau report. The 2022
credit bureau report also lists two debts in collection for $708 and $196, which appear to
correspond to the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.j, and 1.l, as they are reported with the same
collection  agency  and  underlying  creditor.  Applicant  believed  these  debts  underlie  the
judgments in SOR ¶¶ 1.n and 1.o, as discussed below. (Tr. 2 at 48-49; GE 3, 9, 12)
SOR ¶ 1.e is an account in collection for $1,978. This debt is reported on the 2021
credit bureau report. Applicant believed this debt underlies the judgment in SOR ¶ 1.r, as
discussed below. (Tr. 2 at 49, 63-65; GE 3, 6)
SOR ¶ 1.f is a home improvement store account in collection for $1,435. Applicant
opened this account in 2014. This debt is reported on the 2016 and 2021 credit bureau
reports. Applicant believed this debt underlies the judgment in SOR ¶ 1.s, as discussed
below. (Tr. 2 at 49-51, 65-66; GE 2-5)
SOR ¶ 1.g is an account in collection for $1,124. This debt is reported on the 2021
and 2022 credit bureau  reports. Applicant stated that when he  disputed his delinquent
debts,  as  previously  discussed,  this  debt  was  subsequently  not  reported  on  his  most
recent  credit  bureau  report  from  July  2023.  He  did  not  provide  documentation  of  his
dispute, and he acknowledged that he had not paid this debt. (Tr. 2 at 51-54; GE 2-3; AE
F)
SOR  ¶  1.h  is  a  store  credit  card  in  collection  for  $1,004.  Applicant  stated  that
although this was a joint account, he believed it was his ex-spouse’s responsibility. This
debt is reported on the 2016, 2021, and 2022 credit bureau reports. Applicant stated that
when  he  disputed  his  delinquent  debts,  as  previously  discussed,  this  debt  was
subsequently  not  reported  on  his  2023  credit  bureau  report.  He  did  not  provide
documentation of his dispute, and he acknowledged that he had not paid this debt. (Tr. 2
at 37, 54-57; GE 2-3; AE F)
SOR ¶ 1.i is a credit card charged off for $786. Applicant believed this debt also
belonged  to  his  ex-spouse.  This  debt  is  reported  on  the  2016,  2021  and  2022  credit
bureau reports. Applicant stated that when he disputed his delinquent debts, as previously
discussed, this debt was subsequently not reported on his 2023 credit bureau report. He
did not provide documentation of his dispute, and he acknowledged that he had not paid
this debt. (Tr. 2 at 37-39, 57-58; GE 2-3; AE F)
SOR  ¶  1.k  is  for  a  $523  charged-off  account.  Applicant  believed  this  debt  also
belonged  to  his  ex-spouse.  This  debt  is  reported  on  the  2021  and  2022  credit  bureau
reports.  Applicant  stated  that  when  he  disputed  his  delinquent  debts,  as  previously
discussed, this debt was subsequently not reported on his 2023 credit bureau report. He
did not provide documentation of his dispute, and he acknowledged that he had not paid
this debt. (Tr. 2 at 58-59; GE 2-3; AE F)
SOR ¶ 1.m is an insurance account in collection for $251. Although this debt was
reported on the 2021 credit bureau report, the credit bureau reports from 2022 and 2023
reflect that this debt is paid. (Tr. 2 at 59-60; GE 2-3; AE F)
SOR ¶¶ 1.n and 1.o are judgments entered against Applicant by the same creditor
in June 2017 and March 2018 for $834 and $3,170, respectively. Applicant believed that
the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.j, and 1.l underly these judgments. Court records reflect that
an  agreement  for  modification  of  wage  execution  was  entered  in  March  2020  for  the
judgment in SOR ¶ 1.n, and another such agreement was entered in May 2020 for a retail
consumer debt underlying the judgment in SOR ¶ 1.o, in which Applicant agreed for his
employer  to  garnish  $42  weekly  from  his  wages  to  satisfy  these  judgments.  Applicant
satisfied the judgment in SOR ¶ 1.o in October 2022. Applicant stated that the execution
of the wage garnishment order for the judgment in SOR ¶ 1.n had not yet begun, as only
one garnishment order could be executed at a time. (Tr. 2 at 34-35, 48-49, 60-63; GE 9,
12; AE A)
SOR ¶¶  1.p  and  1.q  are judgments entered  against  Applicant  by  the  same  creditor
in March 2018  for $2,431  and  $1,832, respectively. Applicant believed  that the  debt in
SOR ¶  1.b underlies  the judgment in SOR ¶  1.p. Court records reflect that an agreement
for modification  of  wage  execution  was  entered  in March  2020, in which Applicant  agreed
for his employer to  garnish  $42  weekly from  his  wages  to  satisfy the  judgment in  SOR ¶
1.p.  Applicant  stated  that the  execution  of this  wage  garnishment  order had  just started.
Court  records  also  reflect  that  Applicant  was   ordered   to   pay  $35   weekly,  beginning   in
April 2018, to  satisfy the  judgment in SOR ¶  1.q. Court records and  the  2022  credit bureau
report reflect that Applicant satisfied  the  judgment in  SOR ¶  1.q  in March 2021. (Tr. 2  at
33-34, 43-47, 63-65; GE 2, 7, 8)
SOR  ¶  1.r is a  judgment  entered  against Applicant  in October 2018  for $1,601.
Applicant  believed  that  the  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.e  underlies  this  judgment.  Court  records
reflect that a wage execution order was issued in November 2018, requiring Applicant’s
employer to garnish $35 weekly from Applicant’s wages to satisfy this judgment. Applicant
stated that the wage garnishment had not yet begun for this debt. (Tr. 2 at 33, 49, 63-65;
GE 6)
SOR ¶ 1.s is a judgment entered against Applicant in February 2021 for $1,205.
Applicant believed that the debt in SOR ¶ 1.f underlies this judgment. Court records reflect
that a wage execution order was issued in May 2021, requiring Applicant’s employer to
garnish $35 weekly from Applicant’s wages to satisfy this judgment. Applicant stated that
the wage garnishment had not yet begun for this debt. (Tr. 2 at 33, 49-51, 65-66; GE 5)
While the 2022 credit bureau report  reflects that Applicant’s mortgage  was past
due  in  the  amount  of  $64,741  and  that  the  foreclosure  process  had  started,  Applicant
stated  that  he  utilized  the  loan  modification  process  to  save  his  home  from  being
foreclosed. He acknowledged that he had fallen several months behind on his mortgage.
He stated that when he filed hardship paperwork with the mortgage company, it rejected
his mortgage payment in January 2020. In December 2020, he and his family vacated the
home while he was attempting to renovate it after the kitchen had been damaged by a
fire and other issues that were discovered in the home needed to be addressed. In April
2021,  he  stated  that  the  mortgage  company  sent  a  subcontractor  to  the  home  and
vandalized it, “trying to say that we didn’t live there anymore.” When he reported it to the
police, the police told him to leave the home. He intended to “let [the  home] go,” but he
reached an agreement with the mortgage company through mediation. He stated that in
addition to modifying his home loan, after which time his mortgage payment was $1,533
monthly, HUD also made a payment on the loan of approximately $40,000. He and his
family lived in an apartment rental until November 2022, when they moved back into the
home. (Tr. 2 at 67-77; GE 2)
The  2023  credit  bureau  report reflects  a  delinquent  rental or  leasing  account  in
collection  for  $1,115,  noting  that  Applicant  first  became  delinquent  on  this  account  in
November 2022. Applicant stated that this debt was for early termination, cleanup, and
damage fees at the apartment rental he lived in with his family from approximately 2020
to 2022. He stated that he was working with the creditor to try to resolve this debt. In June
2023, after paying  an outstanding tax debt of $393, he stated that he did not owe any
other  taxes.  I  will  not  consider  these  unalleged  debts  in  evaluating  the  disqualifying
conditions under this guideline; however, I will consider this information in my mitigation
and whole-person analysis. (Tr. 2 at 77-70, 89, 100-101, 105-106; GE 2; AE F)
As of  the  date  of  the  hearing  and  since  around  October 2020, Applicant’s annual
income  was  approximately $60,000. His  budget  reflects  a  total monthly income  of  $5,890,
and  a  monthly net remainder, after expenses, of  $582. If  approved  for the  home  equity
loan  that he  applied  for in June  2023, he  intended  to  use  it  “so I can  just  basically pay
everything   off   and   then   just   have   one   payment  as  a   debt  consolidation.”   With   his  ex-
spouse’s passing, he  expects to  receive survivor benefits  for their  two  children. He intends
to  continue  monitoring  his credit report.  He has not received  credit counseling. He stated
that he  values his job, and  he  would not do  anything  to  jeopardize  it or  his ability to  provide
for his family. (Tr. 2  at 24, 39-42, 66-77, 79-87, 89-108; GE 2; AE B,  F)
