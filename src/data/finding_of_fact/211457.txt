Applicant denied the allegations in the SOR ¶¶ a. through 1.p. She admitted SOR
¶¶ 1.q through 1.s. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and
exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 37 years old. She earned a bachelor’s degree in 2012 and a master’s
degree  in  2020.  She  married  in  March  2023.  She  has  no  children.  She  began  her
employment with a federal contractor in March 2021. She estimated her annual salary is
currently about $43,000 and her husband is paid approximately $20.00 an hour, so it was
difficult to estimate his earnings as the hours fluctuate. (Tr. 19-22)
Applicant  stated that after graduating from college  she  worked for an  insurance
company from November 2013 to approximately December 2017. She obtained student
loans to pay for her undergraduate degree. Her starting annual salary was about $30,000
and  increased  to  approximately  $38,000  to  $40,000.  She  was  promoted  in  2017  and
moved from State A to State B. She started working on her master’s degree in 2013. She
took classes consistently from 2013 to 2015 and then took a break from school from 2016
to 2020, when she did not attend school. She stated that her student loans were deferred
while she was working on her advanced degree. (Tr. 22, 24, 33-35; GE 1)
On  her  April  2021  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  she  disclosed  she  took
many short trips to Mexico in 2015 and traveled internationally from 2015 to March 2018
to  France  (some  expenses  were  coved  by  a  friend),  United  Kingdom,  Iceland,
Guadeloupe, and the Bahamas. (Tr. 22, 24, 33-35; GE 1)
In 2017, Applicant accepted a job to work in China. While waiting for her visa to be
approved, she was unemployed from December 2017 to April 2018. During this time, she
traveled to Guadalupe and paid her own expenses. She testified that before she moved,
she closed and resolved all her financial accounts. She said that she was aware of her
student loans and other debts before she left for China. She said she was going to save
her money while in China and start paying them when she returned to the United States.
She did not give anyone in the United States access to her accounts while she was out
of  the  country.  She  returned  her  car  to  the  creditor  and  allowed  it  to  be  voluntarily
repossessed. (SOR ¶ 1.k) She had to borrow money from her mother and her roommate
when she arrived in China so she could secure a place to live.  She repaid them both.
While living in China, Applicant traveled back to the United States a few times. She also
traveled  for  pleasure  to  Vietnam  (October  2018),  Malaysia  (January  2019),  Indonesia
(February 2019) Sri Lanka (June 2019), Japan (September 2019), and Thailand (October
2019). (Tr. 35-45; GE 1, 2)
Applicant testified that when she returned to the United States in  January 2021,
she had saved about $4,000 so she could restart her life. She continued to work for the
same company until March 2021. While in China, her annual income was about $45,000.
She explained she accepted the job in China because it gave her an opportunity to work
abroad. Her plans had been to move to Spain and work, but she canceled them due to
family issues and the pandemic. (Tr. 45-49)
Applicant disclosed in her April 2021 SCA that she failed to timely pay her 2016
income taxes. She did not specify if she failed to pay both federal and state income taxes.
She reported in her SCA “Incorrect adjustment for personal allowances under [State B]
taxes filing. Need to pay remaining balance this year.” She estimated the amount owed
was $1,985. She further stated, “Will set up payment plan to address remaining balance
owed.” (GE1)
interrogatories
Applicant  completed  government
in  October  2022.  The
interrogatories inquired if she had filed her federal and state income tax returns from 2013
to 2021. For federal income tax returns, she responded “n/a” for tax years 2013, 2014,
and 2015. She testified she put n/a because she was unable to retrieve the transcripts for
these years. For tax years 2016, 2017, 2020 and 2021, she responded “yes.” For tax year
2017 she provided an IRS transcript that reflects her income tax return was not filed. She
had no explanation for why she failed to file. For tax years 2018 and 2019, she responded
“no.” Her explanation for failing to file for tax years 2018 and 2019 was because she was
both a resident and full-time employee in China during those years. Her October 2022 tax
transcripts  reflect  that  her  tax  returns  were  not  filed  for  2017,  2018,  and  2019.  In  her
interrogatories,  she  reported  her  total  federal  tax  liability  was  $1,648,  which  included
penalties and interest. She reported she did not currently have an installment agreement
with the IRS but had been making monthly payments of $50 before she moved to China.
(T. 29-33, 50-57, 60-65; GE 2)
Applicant responded to interrogatory questions about her state income tax returns.
For each tax year from  2013  to  2021, she  responded  “n/a.” She  checked  “yes” on  the
interrogatory question that asked if all her state income tax returns for tax years 2013 to
2021 were filed. She responded n/a to the question which asked her to provide her current
total outstanding tax liability. Prior to 2017, Applicant lived in State A that does not have
a state income tax. State B, where she moved does have a state income tax. She testified
that she did not file a state income tax return for 2017. (Tr. 33-35, 57-59; GE 2)
Applicant testified that she believed she did not have to file federal or state income
tax  returns  while  she  was  a  resident  and  working  in  China.  She  admitted  she  never
consulted a tax professional or anyone when she drew this conclusion.  IRS publication
54 reflects that she is required to file federal income tax returns while living and working
in a foreign country. She stated that when she prepared her returns it was electronically
with a software program. Her 2018 and 2019 federal and state income tax returns remain
unfiled. She stated she filed her 2020 and 2021 federal tax returns. She provided a copy
of her 2020 federal tax transcript which reflects a negative adjusted gross income. She
was asked if she reported income she earned while in China, and she said she thought
the tax form permitted her to report foreign income. When Applicant returned to the United
States in January 2021, she lived in State C and continued to work for the same company
until March 2021. She stated that when she filed her 2021 federal income tax return, she
believed  she  reported  income  she  earned  from  this  company.  She  moved  about  six
months later to State D. Both states have income tax requirements. She indicated in her
interrogatories “n/a” for tax year 2021 regarding her state tax return. She said she filed
her state and federal income tax returns for tax year 2022 and did not owe any taxes. The
record was held open to allow her to provide evidence to show she was not required to
file federal income tax returns in 2018 and 2019. She did not. (Tr. 29-33, 50-59; GE 2; HE
II)
Applicant stopped making payments to the IRS for her 2016 tax liability when she
moved to China. She has not made any independent payments since then. She said she
needed to borrow money to get settled when she moved to China. Any tax refunds she
was  entitled  to  were  captured  and  applied  to  her  current  liability.  In  response  to
questioning as to why she did not resolve the debt when she was put on further notice of
it  when  she  received  the  SOR,  she  said  she  thought  her  refunds  would  cover  her  tax
liability and she was relying on them to resolve her debt. She has not contacted the IRS
to make payment arrangements to resolve her tax liability. She reported the tax debt on
her SCA in April 2021. (Tr. 64-67; GE 1, 2)
Applicant provided with her interrogatories copies of federal tax transcripts. She
timely  filed  her 2021  federal income  tax  return.  Her 2020  tax  year transcript  reflects  a
negative adjusted gross income of $250. It is unknown why she has a negative amount.
Tax transcripts from 2017 and 2018 reflect a return was not filed. She did not provide a
transcript for tax year 2019. Her documents also reflect she still has a balance owed to
the IRS of $1,648. The documents did not reflect the tax year. (GE 2)
SOR ¶¶  1.a  ($21,883);  1.b  ($19,515);  1.c  ($18,339) 1.d  ($12,080); 1.e  ($11,178);
1.f   ($8,349);  1.g   $6,433)  1.h   ($5,836);  1.i  ($5,808);  1.j  $5,688);  1.l  ($4,875);  1.m
($$4,544); 1.n  ($3,106); and  1.o  ($3,106) are  delinquent student loans.  All  these  loans
are listed  with  the  Department of  Education  (DOE) except those  in  SOR ¶¶  1.e,  1.h  and
1.m. Applicant  testified  she  took out student loans for both  of her degrees. She  said after
she  received  her bachelor’s degree  in 2012, she  started  her master’s program  in 2013.
She  took classes consistently from  2013  to  2015  and  then  took a  break from  school from
2016  to 2020, when she did not attend school. She said her student loans were deferred
for a  period and were in default, but she could not recall when that occurred.  She did not
make any payments on the loans when she  was not attending school. (Tr. 80-89)
Applicant testified that after she graduated earning her master’s degree in 2020,
she did not make any payments towards her student loans. She confirmed her student
loan debt with the government investigator when she was interviewed in April 2021. She
stated she had received correspondence from one of the student loan creditors prior to
leaving for China but could not recall the creditor. The letter put her on notice her student
loans were due. She believed her loans were deferred. She stated,  she was unable to
contact  any of  the  creditors while  she  lived  in  China  due  to  her inability  to  access  her
accounts. She was confronted with additional student loan accounts and said she was
unaware of their status. She intended to contact the creditors and determine the  loans
status. She testified that she was aware of her obligation to pay her student loans but
made no attempt to do so because she was not financially stable at the time. (Tr. 81-82;
GE 2)
Applicant stated that in November 2022 she applied for a student loan forgiveness
program and attempted to consolidate her loans. She provided a copy of a letter from the
DOE  stating  she  qualified  for  the  one-time  Student  Loan  Relief  plan  but  there  were
pending  lawsuits  challenging  the  program  and  she  would  be  notified  if  and  when  they
prevailed in court. She stated she received a letter from the creditor who held the debts
in SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.h and 1.m. offering her the opportunity to participate in a “Fresh Start”
program. She applied for the program in June 2023 and is waiting for a response. She
testified that she made a payment arrangement for three of her loans and is to start paying
$148 a month beginning in December 2023. She was unable to identify which loans on
the SOR are part of the agreement. When asked if she has determined the status of all
her  student  loans,  she  said  she  had  not.  She  was  to  provide  documentation  to
substantiate her actions and specify which loans she has an agreement to pay. She did
not provide any documents. (Tr. 22, 82-94; Answer to SOR)
Applicant  was  asked  if  she  provided  the  student  loan  creditors  her  forwarding
address or any contact information when she moved to China. She said she did not. She
said her father received some correspondence from the creditors while she was in China.
She received letters upon her return from China. Her credit report from April 2021 reflects
all her student loans are in collection. In her July 2022, October 2022, and January 2023,
credit reports the loans with DOE have a notation that states “customer unable to locate
consumer” and the accounts were in collection. (Tr. 89-94; GE 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.k ($5,188) is the car loan and voluntary repossession
from when Applicant returned the vehicle before she left for China. She understood she
owed a balance. She stated she thought the car was sold. The debt was brought to her
attention  by  the  government  investigator  during  her  April  2021  interview.  She  told  the
investigator that she was not sure of the balance owed, if any, and she did not receive
correspondence  from  the  creditor  because  she  was  in  China.  She  said  she  had  no
immediate  plans  at  that  time  to  contact  the  creditor  to  correct  any  issues  but  would
eventually  resolve  the  matter.  She  testified  that  she  has  not  contacted  the  creditor  to
determine the debt’s status, dispute it, or make payment arrangements. It remains on her
credit reports. It is unresolved. (Tr. 98-100; GE 2, 3, 5, 6)
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.p ($1,073) is a debt for an apartment where Applicant lived
in 2016. She stated she vacated the apartment when she moved to a different state and
believed  she  had  paid  all  remaining  bills.  She  was  confronted  with  the  debt  by  the
government  investigator  in  April  2021  and  said  when  she  did  a  walkthrough  with  the
landlord there was no damage to the apartment indicated. She told the investigator she
would  contact  the  creditor  and  determine  why  there  is  a  balance  due,  and  she  would
eventually resolve the issue. She testified that she disputed the debt with the landlord,
but it was unresolved. Her April 2021 credit report indicated she disputed the debt, but it
did  not  report  it  was  resolved  in  her  favor.  The  debt  is  reported  on  her  July 2022  and
January 2023 credit report. It is unresolved. (Tr. 100-102; GE 2, 3, 6)
The debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.q ($535) is a charged-off credit card debt. Applicant
settled the debt in December 2022. The debt in SOR ¶ 1.r ($101) was paid in December
2022. Both were resolved after receipt of the SOR. When asked why it took so long to
pay these debts, she did not have an explanation. She provided documentary verification
the debts are paid. (Tr. 22, 102-104; GE 2, 3, 4, 5, 6; Answer to SOR)
Applicant was asked about a delinquent debt that is on her April 2021 credit report
and is not alleged in the SOR. It is a collection account for a credit card from 2018 with a
balance  owed  of  $2,447.  During  Applicant’s  April  2021  interview  with  a  government
investigator,  she  acknowledged  the  account  and  said  she  closed  it  before  she  left  for
China. She did not recall if there was a balance due or the date of her last payment. She
told  the  investigator  she  would  contact  the  creditor  and  attempt  to  resolve  the  issue.
Applicant testified that she did not think she contacted the creditor. (Tr. 104; GE 2, 3)
Applicant  and  her  husband  have  been  living  together  since  June  2021.  She
estimated that that since September 2021 their monthly net income is $6,600 and  after
they pay their monthly expenses, they have about $1,000 remaining, which often varies.
They paid $8,000 for their wedding in March 2023. They spent $3,000 on a honeymoon
in Portugal. She traveled to the Bahamas in 2021. She has about $30 in her checking
account and about $2,700 in savings. She contributes to a 401k pension plan but does
not know the balance of the account. She occasionally will send her sister $100 to $200.
She does not have a written budget. She said her husband has a lot of credit cards, but
they are all being paid timely. (Tr. 72-80)
I have not considered any derogatory information in the application of disqualifying
conditions. I may consider this information in the application of mitigating conditions, in
making a credibility determination, and in my whole-person analysis.
