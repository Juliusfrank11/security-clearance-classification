Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations in his Answer, with explanations. He is
24  years  old.  As  of  his  May  2022  security  clearance  application  (SCA),  he  was  not
married,  he  did  not  have  any  children,  and  he  had  lived  with  his  parents  and  two
younger siblings since December 2021. He graduated from high school in 2017. While
in college, he interned for his employer, a DOD contractor, from May 2019 to July 2019,
May  2020  to  August  2020,  and  May  2021  to  August  2021.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s
degree  in  December  2021.  He  was  subsequently  briefly  unemployed  before  working
part-time in data entry for a recruiting agency from February 2022 to April 2022. He has
worked  as  a  cyber  systems  engineer  associate  for  his  current  employer  since  May
2022. He was first granted a security clearance  in approximately May 2020, as part of
his internships. (Items 1-3)
Applicant  used  marijuana,  with  varying  frequency,  from  approximately  2017
through  May  2021.  He  continued  to  use  marijuana  through  May  2021,  after  he  was
granted  a  security  clearance  in  May  2020.  (SOR  ¶  1.a)  He  began  using  marijuana  in
college in 2017. He smoked it weekly with his college roommates and friends to relax.
He contributed money towards the purchase of it. He did not use marijuana during his
summer breaks from college when he lived at home, before he began his internship with
his employer and passed a pre-employment drug screening, or during the summers of
his  internship.  He  stopped  using  marijuana  because  he  realized  he  had  grown  out  of
such  college  behavior,  and  he  did  not  want  to  use  it  anymore.  He  disclosed  this
information  during  his  July  2022  background  interview.  (Answer;  Items  1-2;  FORM
Response)
Applicant did not disclose his drug involvement in response to section 23 of both
his October 2019 SCA and his 2022 SCA, which inquired about illegal use of drugs or
drug activity. He marked “No,” and did not disclose his marijuana use in response to a
question  on  both  SCAs  that  inquired  whether  he  had  illegally  used  any  drug  or
controlled substances in the last seven years. He also marked “No” on his 2022 SCA, in
response  to  a  question  that  inquired  whether  he  had  ever  illegally  used  or  otherwise
been illegally involved with a drug or controlled  substance while possessing a  security
clearance,  and  he  did  not  disclose  his  use  of  marijuana  while  holding  a  security
clearance.  He  disclosed  on  his  2022  SCA  that  he  had  a  security  clearance  that  was
granted to him in May 2020. (Answer; Item 3)
Applicant  indicated  during  his  background  interview  that  he  did  not  disclose  his
marijuana use on his 2019 SCA because he thought it would affect his ability to obtain a
security clearance. He also indicated that he intended to disclose his marijuana use on
his 2022 SCA by correcting his negative responses from his 2019 SCA, but he forgot to
do so. (Item 2)
In March 2023, Applicant signed a statement of intent stating, “I have no intention
of smoking marijuana, or consuming any other controlled substances, presently or in the
future.” He expressed his regret and remorse over his actions. He stated that he is more
mature  and  regrets  that  his  actions  have  jeopardized  his  work.  He  stated  that  he  no
longer  socializes  with  the  friends  from  college  with  whom  he  used  marijuana.  He
reiterated that he did not disclose his marijuana use on his 2019 SCA because he was
afraid that it would affect his chances of obtaining his internship. He admitted that he did
not disclose his marijuana use on his 2022 SCA because he was afraid it would affect
his job. He stated:
