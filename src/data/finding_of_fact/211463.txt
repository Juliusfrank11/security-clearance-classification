In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted all four allegations in SOR (¶¶ 1.a-1.d).
The  four  defaulted  student  loans  totaled  $22,693.  His  admissions  are  accepted  as
findings of fact.
Applicant is a  52-year-old employee  of a  defense  contractor assigned  to  a  U.S. Air
Force  (AF)  base  as a  training  - roles manager  and  hybrid  site  integrator. He  has worked
for a  DOD contractor  since  March  2019,  and  in January  2022,  he  moved  to  another  state
and a  new AF base  to  do  essentially the  same  type  of work.  He served  honorably in the
U.S. Air  Force  from  1994  to  2018. He  retired  at  the  rank  of  master sergeant (E-7). His
military  specialty  was   surgical  technician.   He   earned   an   associate   degree,  and   during
2016  to  2018  he  attended  another university, but he  did not graduate  with  a  bachelor’s
degree. He  has  been  married  to  his wife  since  1993, and  they have  two  adult children
and  a  14-year-old  daughter. His wife  is  employed  as a  cosmetic  sales representative. (Tr.

Financial Considerations
Applicant began to experience financial issues after retiring from the Air Force in
2018. He admitted that he was not good with the transition and the deductions from his
pay,  which  ultimately  caused  adverse  tax  consequences.  He  has  resolved  all  of  his
delinquent federal tax issues, and he has setup a payment plan with the state tax board
for his delinquent 2021 taxes. He has made approximately eight monthly payments to the
state.  All  of  their  state  and  federal  tax  returns  are  filed.  They  have  an  extension  until
October 2023 to file their 2022 tax returns. (Tr. 20-23)
While Applicant attended a university from 2016 to 2018, he told the finance office
that he wanted his GI Bill to pay for his tuition, and that he did not want to accrue any type
of debt. In October 2021, while speaking with an authorized DOD investigator during his
background  investigation,  he  learned  of  his student  loan  debt  covering  the  2016-2018
period.  He  contacted  the  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  and  the  university  to  inquire
about  this  debt,  and  Applicant  discovered  he  had  signed  paperwork  to  have  any
outstanding tuition that was not paid by the GI Bill to be covered by grants and/or student
loans. (Tr. 23-32; SOR response; GE 2)
After  Applicant  graduated  from  high  school  in  1988,  he  attended  other  colleges
until 1992. He was fully aware that he had accumulated some student loan debt for those
specific years. Although he admitted that he did not owe much tuition for these earlier
years of college before enlisting in the military, he had not made any effort to satisfy these
delinquent  student  loans.  He  never  initiated  contact  with  the  student  loan  creditor  to
request loan forbearance, loan deferment, consolidation, or loan rehabilitation, but he did
tell the loan servicer that he was in the military. He stated that years ago he had received
phone calls and letters requesting payment for these student loan debts. (Tr. 23-32; SOR
response; GE 2)
During Applicant’s October 2021 background interview, he told the investigator that
he was currently living paycheck to paycheck. Once he got his income under control he
intended to pay back all of his creditors, but his unpaid taxes were his first priority. He did
not disclose the delinquent student loans he accumulated right after high school under
the financial section of the 2021 SCA. The four student loans alleged in the SOR are the
debts he developed during 2016-2019 while he was still enlisted in the military. He and
his wife have completed the Dave Ramsey financial course on two separate occasions
since 2015. (Tr. 23-32; SOR response; GE 1, GE 2)
In  September 2022,  Applicant  was  contacted  by  a  representative of  DOHA  and
learned that his security clearance was still in-process. Applicant was asked to provide
updated information to DOHA concerning the status of his defaulted student loans. The
first time the Applicant ever contacted the student loan servicer regarding his delinquent
student loans occurred in about October 2022. He made a phone call to determine how
he could get these loans out of default. He said he was able to get the loans rehabilitated
without making payments, and his loans were placed with Nelnet. He was able to set up
a  payment  plan  to  begin  in  October  2023.  He  also  submitted  paperwork  to  have  his
student loans considered for debt forgiveness, but he has not yet received a response.
He  admitted  that  over  all  these  years  he  has  never  made  a  single  payment  on  his
delinquent  student  loans.  The  record  does  not  show  that  his  student  loans  had  been
rehabilitated. (Tr. 33-34; SOR response, AE A, AE B)

On  March  27,  2020,  the  Coronavirus  Aid,  Relief,  and  Economic  Security  Act
(CARES Act) became law, providing relief measures on Department of Education (DoED)
owned federal student loans through September 30, 2020. This student loan debt relief
received several extensions. In March 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the
President directed the DoED to place federal student loans in forbearance. The federal
government repeatedly extended the student loan payment pause. The pause includes
the  following  relief  measures  for  eligible  loans:  a  suspension  of  loan  payments;  a  0%
interest rate; and stopped collections on defaulted loans. See Federal Student Aid (FSA)
website, https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19. (HE 2) On February 25,
2023, the FSA website said:
The  student loan  payment pause  is extended  until the  U.S.  Department of
Education is permitted  to implement the  debt relief program or the litigation
is resolved. Payments  will  restart 60  days later. If  the  debt relief program
has not  been  implemented  and  the  litigation  has not been  resolved  by June
30,   2023   —   payments  will   resume   60   days  after  that.  We   will   notify
borrowers before payments restart.
In  August 2022, President Biden  announced  forgiveness  of  $10,000  or $20,000  of
federal student loan  debt,  and  on  November 11, 2022, the  DoED said  they would  continue
to  seek forgiveness of student loans. See  “Statement from  Secretary of Education  Miguel
Cardona on  District Court Ruling  on  the  Biden-Harris Administration Student Debt Relief
Program,”https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/statement-secretary-education-
