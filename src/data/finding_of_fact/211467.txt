In Applicant’s SOR response, she admitted all SOR allegations. (HE 3) She also
provided mitigating information. Her admissions are accepted as findings of fact.

employer for about two  years. (Tr. 6, 8, 41) In  2012, she  graduated  from  high  school. (Tr.
6) She  attended  college, and  she  has  less than  25  college  credits.  (Tr. 7) She  served  in

Applicant was married from 2015 to 2017, and she has an eight-year-old daughter.
(Tr. 8-9) After Applicant’s daughter was born, she had postpartum depression, and she
received inpatient mental-health treatment for a week. (Tr. 35) She received medication
for depression for about three months after her discharge from the hospital. (Tr. 36) She
also suffered from undiagnosed Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). (Tr. 21)
While she was in the Air Force, her residence was filthy, and she was accused of child

divorce, she did not receive any child support payments.  She said her former husband
was diagnosed as bipolar and a sociopath. (Tr. 38) The father of her daughter passed

Financial Considerations
Applicant said her gross annual pay is about $65,000. (Tr. 30) She was unsure
about her net pay. (Tr. 30) Her mother lives with her and helps her manage her bills and
taxes. (Tr. 29, 32-33) The SOR alleges the following financial concerns:
SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b  allege  Applicant  failed  to  file  as  required  federal  and  state
income tax returns for tax years (TY) 2017, 2018, and 2019. In Applicant’s August 3, 2020
SCA, she disclosed that she failed to file her federal income tax returns for TYs 2017 and
2018 due to forgetfulness, and she intended to get these tax returns filed. (GE 1)
In Applicant’s September 2, 2020 OPM personal subject interview, she indicated
she failed to file her tax returns for TYs 2017, 2018, and 2019. (GE 3) She said she was
forgetful, and she needed to obtain her divorce decree to enable her to take a dependent
deduction for her daughter. (Id.) She promised to take care of her tax returns within one
week of her OPM interview. (Id.) She subsequently learned that her former husband was
authorized under her divorce decree to take the dependent deduction for her daughter.
(Tr. 37)
In response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant provided a tax return transcript for
TY 2019, which indicated she filed her tax return for TY 2019 on February 15, 2022. (Tr.
26; GE 2) In her SOR response, Applicant said:
My  failing   to   file   is  not  due   to   financial   instability,  but   a   mixture   of  poor
memory and  execution  paralysis which  are symptoms of my ADHD. I  have
since   acquired   assistance   [to]  ensure  that  I  have   timely  filed   ever  since.
Admittedly,  during  this investigation  I have  struggled  to  file  these  years and
acquire   transcripts  in   a   timely  manner.  I  have   managed   to   file  2   of  the   3
years thus far and  [I  provided] transcripts for one. (HE 2)
Applicant said during  her hearing  that she  filed  her federal income  tax returns for
TYs 2018, 2019, and  2020;  however, she  has  not filed  her tax returns for 2017  because
she  has not received  a  W2  from  the  Defense  Finance  and  Accounting  Service  (DFAS).
(Tr. 19) She  was unsure  about when  she  filed  her TY 2018  federal income  tax return. (Tr.
27) She  believed  she  received  refunds for TYs 2018  and  2019. (Tr. 27) She  had  memory
issues, and  it was difficult for her to  focus on  completion  of her tax returns.  (Tr. 22)  She
believed  she filed  her TY 2020 federal income tax return on  time. (Tr. 28)
In April 2023, Applicant asked the IRS to provide her W2s for TY 2017. (Tr. 24)
She believes the IRS will prepare and file her 2017 federal income tax return around April
of 2024. (Tr. 24, 34) Applicant admitted that she failed to file her state tax returns for TYs
2017, 2018, and  2019 in her SOR  response,  and  she gave  the same explanation and
mitigating information that she provided for her federal income tax returns, which were
not timely filed.
On August 20, 2023, Applicant asked the IRS to provide her tax transcripts for TYs
2018 through 2022. (AE A at 1) The tax transcripts show the IRS received her TY 2019
tax return on February 15, 2022, her TY 2020 tax return on April 15, 2021, her TY 2022
tax return on April 15, 2022, and her tax return for TY 2022 on April 15, 2023. (AE A at 6,
