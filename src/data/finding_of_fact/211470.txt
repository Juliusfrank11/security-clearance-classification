In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  she  did  not  expressly  admit  or  deny  the
allegations, but she claimed that she had filed all her federal and state income tax returns
for tax years 2015 through 2020. Her response amounts to a denial.
Applicant is a 62-year-old marine painter employed by a defense contractor since
January  2018.  She  received  her  high  school  diploma  in  January  1993.  She  has  been
employed  by  her  current  employer  since  2003  (Tr.  27)  Her  SCA  reflects  that  she  was
unemployed from June 2009 to January 2010, March to May 2011, March and April 2015,
November  2015  to  May  2016,  and  September  and  October  2017.  These  periods  of
unemployment  occurred  between  the  days  that  a  contract  ended  and  a  new  contract
began.  (Tr.  18)  She  received  unemployment  compensation  during  the  gaps  between
contracts. (Tr. 23) She has never married. She has two adult children. She has never held
a security clearance.
When Applicant submitted her SCA in August 2018, she disclosed that she had
not filed her federal and state income tax returns for 2015 and 2016 because she “didn’t
or wouldn’t have the money” if she owed taxes. She stated that she was seeking credit
counseling. (GX 1 at 39-40) When she filed her federal tax return for 2015 in March 2018,
it reflected a refund of $1,478. (AX A) When she was interviewed by a security investigator
in June 2019, she stated that she did not file her federal and state income tax returns for
2016 and 2017, because she did not believe that she owed any taxes. (GX 2 at 14) When
she filed her federal tax return for 2016 in October 2021, it reflected a refund of $44 for
2016. (AX B)
On  January 21,  2020,  Applicant  responded  to  DOHA  interrogatories  and  stated
that she filed her federal and state income tax returns for 2015 through 2020 on January
11, 2020. She estimated that her federal tax liability was $1,268 for tax years 2016 and
2017, and her state tax liability was $626 for tax year 2017. (GX 2 at 5-7)
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  submitted  documentary  evidence  that  she  filed  her
federal  and  state  returns  for  2015  in  March  2018,  and  she  filed  her  federal  and  state
returns for 2016 through 2019 at various dates in 2021. (AX A through D; AX I) She paid
the balance due for federal taxes on a date not reflected in the record. (AX F) She paid
the balance due for state taxes in June 2023. (AX G)
Applicant did not file her tax returns for 2021 until February or March 2023. She
testified that her parents passed away, and because of the stress of losing her parents,
she did not file her 2021 returns until she filed her 2022 tax returns. (Tr. 40) Her untimely
filing of her 2021 returns was not alleged in the SOR, and I have considered it for the
limited purpose of evaluating her evidence of mitigation and in my whole-person analysis.
See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006).
Applicant’s current supervisor, who has known her for more than 20 years, strongly
recommends that her application for a security clearance be granted. He states that she
has always demonstrated a high degree of integrity, responsibility, and dedication. (AX J)
