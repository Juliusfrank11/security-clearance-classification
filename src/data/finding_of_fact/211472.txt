SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b  allege  Applicant  has  two  student-loan  accounts  placed  for
collection for $29,748 and $28,579. He attended a university from 2001 to 2004 and April
to  October  2017.  (Tr.  22)  His  student  loans  were  borrowed  to  fund  his  2001  to  2004
university  attendance.  (Tr.  29)  He  made  some  payments  on  his  student  loans  starting
shortly after graduation until about 2013. (Tr. 30-31) He stopped making payments around
2013 when he was getting divorced and became unemployed. (Tr. 32, 42) Around 2013
or  2015,  the  creditor advised  him  that  he  could  rehabilitate  his  student-loan  debt  if  he
made consistent payments for six months. (Tr. 33) In 2017, he made an effort to find out
the creditor holding his student loans; however, he was unsuccessful. (Tr. 34) In 2019,
he learned DoED held his student loans. (Tr. 35)
Applicant  said  he  applied  for  the  federal  loan  forgiveness  program.  (HE  3)  In
February  2020,  his  loans  were  placed  into  forbearance  and  interest  on  his  loans  was
stopped.  (Id.)  In  August  2022,  he  applied  for  the  loan  rehabilitation  and  consolidation
program.  (Tr.  37-38;  HE  3)  He  believes  he  has  been  approved  for  the  DoED  income
driven repayment plan. (Tr. 36, 38) He is waiting to learn what his payments will be. (Tr.
36; HE 3)
Applicant’s  October  28,  2022  credit  bureau  report  shows  DoED  student-loan
accounts with balances of $29,748 and $28,579 and two payments from 2018 to 2022 on
the first account, and one payment from 2018 to 2022 on the second account was made
on  time.  (HE  3  at  pages  10-11  of  16)  He  admitted  he  had  not  made  payments  on  his
student loans for three or five years. (Tr. 66-67) He was unsure whether any payments
were made after 2012. (Tr. 66) On May 8, 2023, DoED wrote  Applicant and explained
that three of his student loans of unspecified amounts were taken out of default status
and designated to be in good standing. (AE B) DoED would contact Applicant in the future
to establish a payment plan. (Id.) On August 23, 2023, DoED said they were providing a
repayment schedule for his student loans. (AE B) Applicant’s submission  did not show
the amounts owed on the loans or the amount of his monthly payments. (Id.) After his
hearing, Applicant said, “After years of inaction, I have taken steps to enroll in a structured
payment  plan  for  my  delinquent  student  loans.  This  decision  reflects  my  genuine
commitment to rectifying outstanding debts in a responsible and timely manner.” (AE C)
He did not submit any evidence of payments in 2023.
SOR  ¶¶  1.c  and  1.e  allege  Applicant  has  two  child-support  debts  placed  for
collection for $21,665 and $34,033. He had child-support debts from two different states.
(Tr. 44) He said he currently has only one child-support debt because the larger debt was
paid. (Tr. 44-45) The balance on the lesser debt at the time he responded to the SOR
was $19,691. (Tr. 42, 46; HE 3) His pay was garnished to pay his child-support debt. (Tr.
45-46) His monthly payments of $302 are being automatically made from his monthly pay.
(HE 3) His October 28, 2022 Equifax credit bureau report shows a closed child-support
account with a balance of $20,132, and a paid as agreed child-support account with a
zero balance. (HE 3 at pages 7-8 of 16) On September 21, 2023, he owed $17,786 to
one child-support creditor. (AE A) He said “[I] acknowledge the child-support obligations
that are currently being addressed through wage garnishment. While I understand that
this  involuntary  method  carries  less  weight  than  voluntary  payments  made  by  debtors
themselves, I accept the responsibilities it entails.” (AE C)
SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.f allege Applicant has two dental debts placed for collection for
$336  and $115.  (Tr. 71) His  October 28, 2022  Equifax  credit  bureau  report shows the
$336 account is paid, and the $115 debt is not listed on the credit report. (HE 3 at pages
5,  12  of  16)  He  said  he  referred  the  debts  to  his  dental  insurance  company,  and  he
believes the two debts are resolved. (Tr. 71-72) Applicant is credited with mitigating these
two debts.
SOR  ¶  1.g  alleges  Applicant  has  a  debt  placed  for  collection  for  $7,172.  He
cosigned on a loan to purchase a vehicle. (Tr. 47) He returned the vehicle and contended
he should not have to pay the loan because he did not have possession of the vehicle.
(Tr. 47) He disputed the debt on his credit report, and it was removed. (Tr. 47-48) The
last time he checked on the status of the debt before his hearing was in 2019. (Tr. 49) He
provided  the  contact  information  to  the  creditor  of  the  person  who  was  primarily
responsible  for  the  debt.  (Tr.  9)  He  was  unable  to  obtain  the  original  documents
concerning  the  debt.  (Tr.  49).  After  his  hearing  he  did  not  provide  any  documentation
concerning this account. He said:
Additionally, there is an  ongoing  issue  with  [this account], which  has been
sold  to   another  debt  collector.   Despite   my  diligent  efforts,  I  have   been
unable to  secure  any documents  conclusively establishing  my  responsibility
for  this  debt.   I  am   actively  working   to   resolve   this  discrepancy,  but  my
progress  has  been  hindered  by  the  absence  of supporting  documentation
from the  debt collector.  (AE C)
SOR ¶ 1.h alleges Applicant has a telecommunications debt placed for collection
for $4,317. He said the debt was his debt. (Tr. 50-51) He disputed the debt’s presence on
his credit report. (Tr. 52) The debt does not appear on his current credit report. (Tr. 57)
After his hearing, he said, “I would also like to clarify that the [account in SOR ¶ 1.h is]
not in my name, and I have no legal or financial responsibility for [it].” (AE C) He did not
provide  supporting  documentation  showing  he  was  not  financially  responsible  for  this
debt.
Applicant has a  delinquent  federal tax debt  of  about $5,000  from  around  tax years
(TY) 2013  to  2015. (Tr. 53) He and  his former spouse  both  took the  deductions for their
children,  and  the  Internal Revenue  Service  (IRS) credited  the  deductions  to  his  former
spouse.  (Tr.  53-54)  The   IRS   contacted   him   around   2018   or  2019   about  the   additional
taxes he  owed. (Tr. 54) The  IRS  applied  his refund  for TY 2020  to  his tax debt.  (Tr. 55-
56) He said he  would provide  a  letter from  the  IRS  indicating  the  IRS  agreed  to  resolve
the  debt through  future  tax refunds; however,  he  did not provide  the  letter or agreement
from  the  IRS. (Tr. 56) He said he  would provide  his IRS  tax  transcripts after his hearing;
however, he  did not provide them. (Tr. 68)
In  his  February  19,  2019  SCA,  Applicant  said  the  financial  issue  began  for  the
debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.g and 1.h in 2013, and the debts were disputed. (GE 1 at 44-46) On
August 22, 2023, I emailed Applicant a blank personal financial statement to enable him
to provide additional details about his budget; however, he did not complete and return it
to me. (Tr. 69; HE 11)
On March 13, 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the President placed
federal student loans in deferment, and the interest rate was zero during the deferment
term. See DoED website, “COVID-19 Loan Payment Pause and 0% Interest,” available
at
https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19/payment-pause-zero-
interest#in-school-zero-interest. (HE 5)
On August 24, 2022, the White House announced a new plan to assist student-
loan borrowers:
Make  the  student-loan  system  more  manageable  for  current  and  future
borrowers by:
Cutting  monthly payments in half for undergraduate  loans. The  Department
of Education  is proposing  a  new income-driven  repayment plan  that protects
more low-income  borrowers from  making  any payments and  caps monthly
payments  for  undergraduate   loans  at  5%  of  a   borrower’s  discretionary
income—half  of  the  rate  that borrowers must  pay now under most existing
plans.  This  means  that  the   average   annual  student-loan   payment  will   be
lowered by more than  $1,000  for both current and future borrowers.

Most,”

The  Public  Service  Loan  Forgiveness  (PSLF)  program  allows  forgiveness  of  a
federal student loan after 10 years of income-based payments; however, a debtor must
have applied for the program before October 31, 2022. See The White House website,
https://www.whitehouse.gov/publicserviceloanforgiveness/.  (HE  7)  However,  the  DoED
announced  the  federal  government  is  working  on  new  plans  to  assist  borrowers  in
resolving their student-loan debts.
