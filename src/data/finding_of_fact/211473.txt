Applicant,  32,  has  worked  for  his  current  employer  as  a  security  officer  since
October  2021.  He  completed  a  security  application,  his  first,  in  December  2021,
disclosing  two  delinquent  debts,  totaling  $10,300.  The  investigation  revealed  eight
additional  delinquent  accounts.  The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  owed  $20,430  on  10
delinquent accounts. (GE 1,3)
Applicant started having financial problems after experiencing what he described
as  ‘job  insecurity,’  after  being  laid  off  in  July  2020.  Between  July  2020  and  October
2021,  he  worked  at  four  different  security  companies,  with  the  jobs  lasting  between  2
and 8 months. During the summer of 2020, his finances were strained by the death of
his  father.  Also,  his  girlfriend,  with  whom  he  had  been  living  and  sharing  household
expenses  since  May  2020,  experienced  a  medical  emergency  that  left  her  unable  to
work for an unspecified period. The record does not contain specific information about
Applicant’s income or expenses during that time. (GE 7)
Applicant  discussed  his  finances  with  a  background  investigator  during  a
February  2022  interview.  He  discussed  the  two  debts  he  disclosed  in  his  security
clearance application, both for the deficiency balance on car loans. After being laid off in
July  2020,  Applicant  could  not  afford  his  car  payment,  which  resulted  in  the  vehicle
being  repossessed  and  a  deficiency  balance  on  the  loan.  (SOR  ¶  1.f,  $3,459)
Unbeknownst  to  Applicant  until  after the  death  of  his father,  his father’s  car,  for  which
Applicant had cosigned, had also been repossessed and had a deficiency balance due.
(SOR  ¶  1.e,  $7332)  At  the  time  of  the  interview,  he  had  not  made  any  payments  on
either of these debts. (GE 7)
The  investigator  confronted  Applicant  with  evidence  of  eight  additional  debts
reported in a January 2022 credit report. (GE 4) He admitted owing debts on two old cell
phone  accounts  totaling  $1,267  (SOR  ¶¶  1.b  and  1.g).  He  also  attributed  a  $69  debt
(SOR  ¶   1.j)  to   medical  treatment   he   received.   He  told   the   investigator   he   had   no
knowledge  of  the  other  five accounts totaling  $8,303.  (SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.h, 1.i)
In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  denied  SOR  ¶  1.a  ($488),  one  of  the  cell
phone  debts  he  admitted  owing  in  the  February  2022  subject  interview.  He  admitted
SOR ¶¶ 1.b through 1.j. All the debts appear on GE 4, a January 20, 2022 credit report.
For unknown reasons, only the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.e through 1.g appear on GE
5, an August 30, 2023 credit report.  The most recent credit report, GE 6, dated April 4,
2023, only reports the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f.
Applicant did not provide any evidence of debt repayment.  None of the alleged
debts  are  over  seven  years  old.  The  alleged  debts  became  delinquent  between  2020
and 2022. There is no evidence that Applicant has challenged the information reported
on his credit reports as being inaccurate or erroneous.
