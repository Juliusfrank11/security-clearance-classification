Applicant is 66 years old, was married in May 1975 and divorced in October 1989.
She has two adult sons. She was married briefly in February 1996, but that was annulled
in May 1997. From September 1991 to April 1998, she attended college but did not earn
a degree. From October 1997 to March 2006, she worked for a defense contractor. Since
March 2006, she has worked for another defense contractor. She reported no periods of
unemployment. She has owned her home since June 1997. (Item 3.)
Under  Guideline  F,  the  SOR  alleged  seven  delinquent  debts  totaling  $39,944.
(SOR.)  Each  SOR  debt  is  supported  by  the  credit  reports  of  record,  showing  those
accounts being charged off or in collections. (Items 4 through 6.) They are also supported
by the March 7, 2022 personal subject interview (PSI). (Item 7.)
The Answer
Before  addressing  each  SOR  debt,  Applicant  stated:  “I  do  not  recall  all  of  the
accounts noted below but do acknowledge I fell behind  on some credit card payments
due to the loss of relationship in which we shared expenses and found I could not maintain
all of my payments.” She gave no basic details about when that loss occurred. (Answer.)
Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶  1.a  ($6,709),  claiming  she  has  requested  proof  of
indebtedness  and  “will  proceed  accordingly  when  the  documentation  is  received.”  Her
response  cited  a  March  6,  2023  letter  from  creditor’s  counsel  requesting  a  resolution
agreement. (Answer.) She did not provide documents evidencing her request for proof of
indebtedness or a copy of the March 6, 2023 letter she referenced.
Applicant admitted SOR ¶ 1.c ($9,551), claiming this debt is now paid due to wage
garnishment  from  August  2022  through  March  10,  2023.  (Answer.)  The  most  current
credit report in the record is April 26, 2023, which may have been too recent to capture a
satisfaction  through  garnishment.  That  credit  report  does  not  show  this  debt.  (Item  4.)
She provided no documents evidencing a garnishment or a satisfaction of this debt.
Applicant denied the remaining five SOR debts. Those denials have the following
common themes. She does not know the type of debts involved; she has requested or
will  request  detailed  information;  and  when  she  receives  that  information,  she  “will
proceed accordingly.” (Answer.) She provided no documents evidencing her attempts to
obtain information from her creditors or collection agencies about her overdue accounts,
or their responses
The  PSI
During  Applicant’s March 7, 2022  PSI, she  discussed  her SOR debts.  (Item  7  at 2-
5.) SOR ¶  1.a  is a  credit card account she  opened  in  September 2015. She  did  not  charge
anything   on   that  card  until  October  2016,  when   she   used   it  for  a   vacation.   She   made
regular monthly  payments.  It became  delinquent  in about  June  2020,  when  she  became
unable to  make  minimum  monthly payments.  She  does not dispute  the  information  in the
credit report.  She  plans to  contact  the  creditor and  try to  negotiate  a  monthly payment
plan  when she is able to  do so  .(Item 7  at 2.)
Applicant  discussed  the  circumstances  that  caused  her  financial  problems.  Her
financial situation began to change, after a storm inflicted significant damage to her home
in 2016. Only a part of the damage was covered by her homeowner’s insurance. She had
to pay about $12,000 to  replace a leaking  roof; $3,000  for  replacing  interior carpeting;
replacing and painting a deck; and updating appliances. She had to use credit cards to
pay her bills. Initially, she managed to juggle her finances to stay afloat, but over time,
her financial situation became worse. (Item 7 at 2.)
Applicant discussed her plans to resolve her financial problems. She is already in
the process of putting her home on the market, and she expected it to be listed by April
2022. After the home is sold, she plans to move in with her daughter. (Note: There is no
reference  in  the  record  to  her having  a daughter.) She  currently  owes  $43,000  on  her
mortgage. An online estimate of the value of her home was $140,000. The balance on
her auto loan is $1,000, which will be paid off in six months. She will use the profit from
the sale of her home to pay off her delinquent debts. (Item 7 at 2.)
Applicant  discussed  the  other  six  SOR  debts,  SOR  ¶¶  1.b  through  1.g.  These
accounts are all credit cards. Her discussions of those accounts shared certain features.
First, she does not dispute any of the information in the credit reports, even though she
could not recall details of many of the accounts. Second, the delinquencies occurred in
about  the  2016  to  2020  timeframe.  Third,  the  accounts  became  delinquent  when  she
could no longer make the minimum monthly payments. Fourth, she plans to contact the
creditors to attempt to negotiate monthly payment plans. Some of those plans may have
to wait until she has sold her home. She did not provide any documents about the seven
delinquent accounts. (Item 7 at 2-5.)
In a follow-up PSI, Applicant discussed her current financial situation. Her gross
monthly income is $6,651, with total payroll deductions of $2,049, leaving a monthly net
salary  of  $4,602.  Her basic  monthly  expenses  are  $2,430  (food,  clothing,  utilities,  car,
etc.). Her monthly debt payments (including mortgage of $580) total $1,435. Her monthly
net remainder is $737. (Item 7 at 6.)
Applicant’s assets are the following: $135,000 (her home); $500 in savings, and;
$4,200 (car). Her total assets are $139,700.
Law and Policies
It  is  well  established  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.  As  the
Supreme  Court  held,  “the  clearly  consistent  standard
that  security
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.” Department of the Navy
v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).
indicates
When  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability
for  a  security  clearance,  an
administrative  judge  must  consider  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  These  guidelines  are
flexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the
whole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a
decision.  The  protection  of  the  national  security  is  the  paramount  consideration.  AG  ¶
¶2(b)  requires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  national
security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.”
Under  Directive  ¶   E3.1.14,   the   Government   must  present  evidence   to   establish
controverted  facts alleged  in  the  SOR. Under Directive ¶  E3.1.15,  then  the  applicant  is
responsible  for presenting  “witnesses and  other evidence  to  rebut,  explain, extenuate, or
mitigate  facts admitted  by  applicant or proven  by Department Counsel . . . .” The  applicant
has the  ultimate  burden of persuasion in seeking a  favorable security decision.
