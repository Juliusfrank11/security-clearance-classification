Applicant admitted the sole allegation SOR ¶ 1.a. His admissions are incorporated
into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits
submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 27-year-old employee of a defense contractor, where he has worked
since 2021. He received a master's degree in 2020, has been married since 2019, and
has one child. (Item 2 at 12-13, 14, 22.)
Guideline H
Applicant  admits  to  a  five-year  history  of  marijuana  use.  In  response  to  DOHA
interrogatories issued to him after his January 2023 security clearance interview, he listed
December 2022 as the  last time he used marijuana.  (Item 3 at 8.)  The window of use
extends several months after he submitted his September 2022 e-QIP. (Response; Item
3  at  4.).  In  his  Response  he  modified  his  prior  answers.  He  admitted  he  first  tried
marijuana  in  2017  but  because  he  was  a  football  player  and  did  not  want  to  lose  his
scholarship, he did not use marijuana from April 2017 until May  2020. (Response.) He
began using marijuana again in May 2020 to help mitigate the pains associated with a
2019 shoulder surgery and subsequent rehabilitation and exercises. He specified in his
Response:
…   I  only  used   it  for  extremely  painful  times  (i.e.,  once   every  couple  of
months).   From   May   of   2020   -  December   of   2020,  l   used   marijuana   once
(every)   3-4   months.  The   once   every  3-4   months  frequency  of   using
marijuana  is the  same  for January 2021  - December 2021. Lastly, January
2022  - December 2022  would follow the  same  frequency as years prior. As
mentioned  in my e-QlP, my last  intake  of marijuana  was December of  2022.
Prior to that date, I had not participated in  marijuana since July of  2022.
Applicant admits to "vaping" marijuana with friends with whom he still associates.
He volunteered he would mitigate his use of marijuana by changing his sleeping habits
and  seeking  other  medical  relief  for  his  pain  and  discomfort  as  well  as  stretching  and
modifying his workouts. (Item 3 at 4; Response.) There is no evidence of a prescription
in the record.
Applicant in his Response stated he believed he could be deemed trustworthy to
conduct his duties because his use of marijuana over the years between 2017 and 2022,
was infrequent. He affirms that that any participation in illegal drug use would “derail” him
from being able to complete his job. He states since his last use in December of 2022, he
has “disassociated” himself from the drug. (Response; Item 3 at 4, 8.)
