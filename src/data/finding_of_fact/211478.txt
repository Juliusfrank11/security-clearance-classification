Applicant, 35, has worked for his employer, a federal contracting company, since
October 2021. He completed a security clearance application, his first, in July 2022. He
did  not  disclose  any  derogatory  information.  The  investigation  revealed  several
delinquent  debts.  The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  owed  $48,271  on  seven  delinquent
accounts  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.g).  He  admits  to  owing  SOR  ¶¶  1.b  through  1.g  and
denies owing SOR ¶ 1.a because it is a duplicate of SOR ¶ 1.b. (GE 4)
Applicant cites two events as the genesis of his financial problems. In 2018,  he
and  his  long-time  partner,  who  is  the  mother  of  two  of  his  three  children,  ended  their
relationship. He moved out of the home they shared. She kept the couple’s joint assets,
including  their  cash  savings.  He  also  began  paying  child  support.  In  2021,  he
experienced  a  decreased  income  related  to  the  Covid-19  pandemic.  Between
November  2010  and  October  2021,  Applicant  worked  full  time  for  a  nationally-known
retailer. Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, he earned his base salary and overtime, which
he  had  come  to  rely  on  to  meet  his  financial  obligations.  At  some  point  during  the
pandemic, the employer suspended operations but continued play their employees their
base  salaries.  The alleged  debts became  delinquent  between January 2019 and  June
2021. Applicant began his current job in October 2021. He continues to work part time
with  his  previous  employer.  In  his  response  to  the  FORM,  he  indicated  that  his  base
salary  is  higher  in  his  new  position  but  did  not  disclose  his  annual  salary  in  either
position. (GE 4,8)
Also, in his June 2023 response to the FORM, Applicant argues that SOR ¶ 1.a
($13,294) is a duplicate of SOR ¶ 1.b ($11,690). This assertion is not supported by the
record.  The  credit  reports  in  the  record,  GE  5  and  6,  identify  these  debts  as  different
accounts.  Furthermore,  in  his  August  2022  subject  interview,  Applicant  told  the
investigator that the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a ($13,294) was for the deficiency balance
on  a  loan  for  a  repossessed  vehicle.  He  has  made  no  plans  to  resolve  this  debt.  He
reported that the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b was for a signature loan. (GE 8, AE A, D)
Applicant  provided  documentation  showing  that  he  settled  the  debts  alleged  in
SOR ¶¶ 1.c ($5,774); 1.e ($1,236); and 1.f ($1,124) for less than the amounts owed. He
has  agreed  to  resolve  the  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.b  ($11,690)  with  $25  monthly
payments until the debt is resolved. He has also entered into a payment agreement for
the debt alleged in ¶ 1.d ($3,915), agreeing to pay the creditor $30 per month from June
2023  to  May  2024,  when  the  payments  will  increase  to  $160  per  month  until  the
balance, including interest, is paid in full.  Applicant did not offer any information about
his plans to resolve SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.g ($11,238).
Applicant  did  not  provide  any  financial information  regarding  his current  income
or  assets.  Nor  did  he  provide  a  personal  financial  statement  or  budget,  detailing  his
currently  monthly  income  and  expenses.  He  believes  that  his  financial  position  is
improving.  In  his  April  2023  Answer  to  the  SOR,  he  explained  that  because  he  was
repaying  a  loan  against  his  retirement  account,  he  could  not  afford  to  pay  the  debts
alleged in the SOR. After he completed paying the loan in May 2023, he planned to take
out  another  loan  so  that  he  could  file  for  bankruptcy  protection.  There  is no  indication
that he has executed that plan. (Answer)
