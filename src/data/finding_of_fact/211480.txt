Under  Guideline  F,  the  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  owed  $156,000  for  35
delinquent credit card accounts (SOR 1.a –  1.ii). In response, Applicant admitted each
allegation,  and  provided  documents  in  support  of  some  of  her  responses.  (Answer)  In
addition to the facts established by Applicant’s admissions, I make the following findings
of relevant fact.
Applicant  is  an  investigator  working  mainly  on  personnel  security  clearance
background investigations. She works as an independent 1099-contractor simultaneously
for  multiple  private  companies,  who  have  contracts  with  the  Department  of  Defense
(DOD) and other federal agencies. She first received a security clearance from DOD in
2009 and is being sponsored for renewal of her clearance by a DOD contractor. (GX 1;
AX A; Tr. 37 – 39)
From  1969  until  she  retired  in  1989,  Applicant  worked  as  a  police  officer  and
detective for a police department in a major U.S. city. She and her husband were married
in 1986. After retiring from law enforcement, she has worked almost entirely as a self-
employed investigator. In 1989, she and her husband bought a house in State A, where
they  lived  and  worked.  In  1993,  they  started  their  own  private  investigation  agency;
however,  her  husband  worked  almost  exclusively  as  a  self-employed  commercial
fisherman  until  he  was  seriously  injured  in  2019.  Due  to  his  injuries  and  subsequent
complications therefrom, he has not worked since 2019, resulting in a loss of about $3,000
in  monthly  income.  Their  private  investigation  agency  has  been  largely  dormant,
producing little or no income, since about 2005. (AX A; Tr. 42 – 44, 63 – 67)
Between  March  1997 and  April  2015,  Applicant  earned  about  $90,000  annually
from  her  work  for  a  single  private  sector  company  in  State  B.  Concurrently,  she  also
worked  on  a  part-time  basis  as  an  investigator  for  other  companies.  When  her
employment in State B ended, she obtained full-time investigative work with at least three
companies  to  make  up  for  the  loss  of  income.  Some  of  that  work  required  she  travel
between State A and State B, and to distant parts of State A, incurring travel and lodging
expenses that offset some of her income. Additionally, she used credit cards to help her
husband pay business-related expenses, including major boat repairs. She estimates that
about half of the debt reflected in the SOR is attributable to her husband’s business. The
other half reflects her use of personal credit to meet expenses when her income fell in
2015 and when her husband became disabled in 2019. Credit reports produced by the
Government show that most of the accounts in the SOR were past due, charged off, or
became delinquent in 2019. Up to that point, Applicant and her husband remained in good
standing  by  making  minimum  monthly  payments  on  their  credit  cards.  There  is  no
indication in this record that her husband’s business was incorporated or that any of the
credit cards at issue were opened in the name of that business.  (Answer; GX 1; GX 2;
GX 3; GX 4; AX A; Tr. 40 – 44, 67 – 70)
In 2005, Applicant and her husband bought a small farm on which they  boarded
and  cared  for  rescued  horses.  The  home  they  had  purchased  in  1989  remained  their
primary residence until 2018, when they decided to rent out that property and move to the
farm. They then sold the first house in 2020, realizing about $20,000 profit that went to
farm repairs and some debt payments not specified in this record. (GX 1; GX 7; Tr. 52 –
55)
In May 2020, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator as part of
her most recent background review. She and the investigator discussed multiple debts
that were past due or delinquent according to a credit report obtained in April 2020. As to
each of the then unresolved debts they discussed, Applicant told the investigator she had
“made arrangements to resolve [the debt] by starting negotiations for [a] payment plan.”
In  her  January  2022  responses  to  each  of  the  SOR  allegations,  she  stated  “Agreed  –
Payment Plan.” At the hearing, Applicant testified that when she answered the SOR, she
had not established any payment plans for any of her debts. In 2019 and 2020, when she
tried  to  negotiate  payment  plans  with  her  creditors,  they  wanted  more  than  she  could
afford to pay and would not accept partial payments. (Answer; GX 7; Tr. 43 – 45, 72)
At the hearing, Applicant provided information showing she has resolved the debts
alleged at SOR 1.a and 1.x. Both debts, owed to the same creditor, were settled in August
2023 in response to civil lawsuits brought against her by that creditor. She also provided
information showing that she has agreed with that creditor to monthly payment plans to
settle the debts alleged at SOR 1.ee and 1.gg. Those agreements were made about a
week before her hearing, with first payments due about two weeks after the hearing. The
record does not contain any further information showing how or if Applicant has acted to
pay or otherwise resolve any other SOR debts. (Answer; GX5; GX 6; AX B; Tr. 37 – 38,
46 – 48)
Applicant  has  not  sought  assistance  from  a  professional  financial  counselor  to
resolve her financial problems. She and her husband currently earn about $8,100 each
month  from  her  investigative  work,  as  well  as  from  her  law  enforcement  pension,  and
Social Security benefits for both. She estimates their monthly expenses are about $5,100
and that, after other expenses, they have about $2,000 remaining each month. (Tr. 49 –
50, 55 – 59)
Applicant has a good reputation among friends and associates for diligence, hard
work, reliability, and integrity. She dedicates much of her personal time and resources to
the care of old and infirm horses. She has not incurred any new unpaid debts, and she
has always filed and paid her taxes as required. (AX A; Tr. 67 – 68)
