Applicant is a 67-year-old employee of a government contractor. He has worked
for this contractor or a predecessor thereof since  January 2012. He  was  married  from
1984 until a divorce in 2018. He has three adult children, one of whom resides with him.
He  earned a  high school diploma  in  1974 and  took  a  semester of college courses  but
did not earn an undergraduate degree. He was on active duty with the Army from 1974
until  1994,  when  he  retired  with  an  honorable  discharge.  He  has  held  a  security
clearance since 1974. (Tr. 15-22, 29-32; GE 1, 3)
In  the  SOR,  the  Government  alleged  Applicant’s  failure  to  timely file  his federal
income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2013  through  2019,  as  required  (SOR  ¶  1.a).  It  also
alleged that he is indebted to the federal government for at least $20,000 for delinquent
income  taxes  for  tax  years  2013  through  2019  (SOR  ¶  1.b).  He  admitted  the  SOR
allegations.  His  admissions  are  adopted  as  findings  of  fact.  The  SOR  allegations  are
established through his admissions and the Government’s exhibits. (SOR; Answer, GE
1-3)
Applicant  could  not  confirm  whether  his  2013  through  2019  federal  income  tax
returns have been filed. He provided no documentary evidence to show that he had filed
them.  In  March  2021,  he  hired  a  professional  tax  company  (TC)  to  file  his  delinquent
income  tax  returns.  He  paid  them  $10,000.  He  claimed  that  he  signed  a  power  of
attorney to allow the TC to sign income tax returns on his behalf, but he did not provide
documentary  evidence  to  substantiate  that  claim.  Part  of  his  contract  agreement  with
the  TC  referenced  his  need  to  “execute”  his  tax  returns  after  verifying  the  information
therein  is  correct.  He  testified  that  the  TC  told  him  that  they  will  be  filing  all  his  late
income  tax  returns  simultaneously.  He  assumed  that  the  TC  has  filed  his  delinquent
income  tax  returns  because  he  no  longer  receives  any  letters  or  phone  calls  from  the
IRS. The TC told him to check his online account drop box for  his filed federal income
tax returns, but he has not had any documents in  this drop box. He last contacted the
TC in August 2023. He claimed he does not know whether he should be worried about
the TC’s possible lack of progress because he has never been in this situation before.
The only reason he has not “panicked” is that the letters and phone calls from the IRS
have stopped. (Tr. 25-29, 35-39; Answer; GE 1-3)
In his January 2021 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (SF
86), Applicant reported that he owed approximately $20,000 in delinquent federal taxes
for the 2013 through 2019 tax years. He could not confirm that he has paid any money
towards these delinquent taxes. He provided no documentary evidence to show that he
had.  He  testified  that  he  believes  that  he  actually  owes  approximately  $60,000  in
delinquent  income  taxes.  He  does  not  believe  that  the  $10,000  he  paid  to  the  TC  is
meant  to  be  used  to  pay  his  delinquent  taxes.  Instead,  he  believes  that  this money  is
meant to be used to file his income tax returns.  He claimed that he will use savings in
his retirement account to pay his delinquent federal taxes. Any adverse information not
alleged in the SOR will not be used for disqualification purposes. I will consider it when
assessing the application of mitigating conditions and for the whole-person analysis. (Tr.
24-29, 34-36; Answer; GE 1-3)
For  the  2013  through  2017  tax  years,  Applicant  failed  to  timely  file  his  federal
income tax returns because he believed that his ex-wife was filing them as she “always
did.” For the 2018 and 2019 tax years, he claimed that he failed to timely file his federal
income  tax  returns  because  of  the  marital  problems  that  ultimately  led  to  his  divorce.
While he knew at the time that he had not timely filed his tax returns for tax years 2018
and 2019, he did not know about the 2013 through 2017 tax years until 2018, when the
IRS  contacted  him.  He  recognized  that  he  made  a  mistake  and  accepts  responsibility
for it. He plans to follow up with the TC to determine its progress on his tax returns. In
March  2021,  during  his  security  interview,  he  told  the  DoD  investigator  that  he  would
follow-up  with  the  TC  to  ensure  that  his  delinquent  income  tax  returns  were  filed  and
that  he  would  acquire  the  documentary  evidence  to  confirm  these  filings.  He  has
provided the TC with the information it needs to file his income tax returns for the 2020
and 2021 tax years. However, he has not provided the TC with this information for the
2022 tax year. He could not confirm whether his federal income tax returns have been
filed for the 2020 through 2022 tax years. (Tr. 19-23, 36-37; GE 2)
Applicant takes home between $1,700 and $2,000 per two-week pay period. He
also receives about $1,900 per month from his military retirement. He owns his home,
having  paid  the  mortgage  on  it  in  about  2008.  His  expenses  consist  of  his  spousal
support  of  about  $480  per  month,  a  car  payment  of  about  $550  per  month,  and  his
property insurance and property taxes. A personal financial statement that he submitted
in  November  2021  did  not  provide  information  regarding  a  monthly  surplus  or  deficit,
and  he  did  not  provide  evidence  of  this  information  at  hearing.  In  his  November  2021
personal financial statement, he claimed to have $4,000 in a savings account, $30,000
in a retirement account, and $140,000 in real estate equity. (Tr. 16-18, 31; GE 3)
