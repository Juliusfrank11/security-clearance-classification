Applicant  denied  SOR  ¶  1.a;  he  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.b,  1.c,  and  1.d;  and  he
denied  the  cross-allegation  at  SOR  ¶  2.a,  all  with  explanations.  His  admissions  are
incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 33 years old. He has never married and has no children. He earned
an associate degree in 2014 and a bachelor’s degree in 2018. He is pursuing a master’s
degree  through  his  employer.  He  has  worked  as  a  research  engineer  for  a  university
research institute since September 2019, with a clearance. He has an annual salary of
$105,000, plus a bonus. (GE 1; Tr. 9, 53-55, 112-113)
The  SOR  concerns  four  criminal  offenses,  three  of  which  occurred  when
Applicant was between the ages of 18 and 21. In November 2008, Applicant, then age
18, was  living  with  his parents.  Police  came  to  the  home  while  investigating  a  serious
crime  in  the  neighborhood  and  asked  to  search  the  home  for  suspects.  When  his
parents  allowed  police  to  search  Applicant’s  room,  they  found  an  ounce  of  marijuana.
Applicant  went to the  police  station for questioning,  and  he  was arrested and  charged
with possession of marijuana along with a friend. In March 2009, he pleaded guilty to a
charge of public nuisance and was fined $390. (SOR ¶ 1.d) (GE 1 at 49; GE 2 at 5, 12)
Applicant  engaged  in marijuana use between  2008 and 2011, but he has not done  so
since then. He has no other drug-related citations or charges. (Answer; GE 2 at 6, GE 3;
Tr. 86-88)
In  April  2011,  when  he  was 21, Applicant was attending  a  friend’s  birthday party
at  an   apartment   complex.  A   police   report  indicates   that   he   and   another  person   were
driving   recklessly   (“laying   drag”)   in   the   parking   lot.  A   neighborhood   “courtesy   officer,”
Mr.  K.   (an   off-duty   police   officer   who   lived   there)   gave   the   men   a   “criminal  trespass
warning”   and   warned   them   not to   return   to   the  property,  including  to   collect  their   cars,
since  the  men  had  been  drinking.  Applicant left and  walked  to  a  friend’s house  nearby.
When  he  returned  to  the  property hours later  to  retrieve  his  car and  drive home,  he  was
held at gunpoint by Mr. K  and  charged  with  criminal trespass  when  police  arrived. The
police   report  reflects  that  the   arresting   officer   smelled   alcohol  on   both   men.  The   case
was   nolle   prossed   in   July  2011   and   he   was   told   not  to   return  to   the   property.   (SOR  ¶
1.c) (Answer; GE 1  at 50-51; GE  2 at 6, 11,  GE 6,  GE  8)
Applicant was at the party and said it was “a bit loud,”  which made Mr. K upset
because he lived in the unit below. Applicant denied drag racing in the parking lot, but
said  he  pulled  out  “more  quickly  than  [Mr.  K]  had  liked.”  (Tr.  80-81)  He  denied
consuming  alcohol  that  evening,  but  said  it  was  possible  that  was  why  he  was  not
allowed to drive away or come back later for his car. Applicant went around the corner
to a friend’s house. When he returned later to get his car to go to work. Mr. K was in the
parking lot. He called police and held Applicant at gunpoint until police arrived. Applicant
denied threatening Mr. K. (Answer; Tr. 80-86, 89-93)
Months  later,  in  September  2011,  Applicant  drove  to  the  same  apartment
complex  and  dropped a  friend off.  He  was  pulled  over by  police  when he  was  leaving
the  property.  He  had  forgotten  that  he  was  barred  from  the  property  when  his  friend
asked  to  be  dropped  off  there.  He  called  it  a  “dumb,  absent-minded  thing.”  (Tr.  71)
When  Applicant  attempted  to  converse  with  the  arresting  officers  while  he  was  being
handcuffed,  he  was  subdued  with  a  taser.  He  was  arrested  and  charged  with  criminal
trespass and two counts of willful obstruction of law enforcement officers. In December
2011,  Applicant  pleaded  guilty  to  one  count  of  criminal  trespass  and  the  other  two
counts were dismissed. He was sentenced to two days in jail (time served), 12 months
of probation and 24 hours of community service, which he completed. He was ordered
not   to   return   to   the   property.   Applicant   had   friends  who   lived   there   at  the   time,   but  he
has  never  again  visited   the   apartment  complex  in   question,   and   no   longer  associates
with  anyone  there.  (Answer; GE  1  at 51-52; GE  2  at  6-7,  12; GE  5,  GE  7;  Tr.  70-80, 93-
98, 116-117)
In March 2021, Applicant was arrested and charged with two domestic violence
(DV) offenses: felony aggravated assault-strangulation and simple battery. (SOR ¶ 1.a)
He disclosed the charges on his April 2021 SCA and discussed them in his June 2021
background interview and noted that they were still pending. (GE 1 at 47-48 GE 2 at 5)
He said he kept his employer’s security office informed as to the status of the case. (Tr.
114-115)
Applicant explained that he had known C for about 15 years. They met and dated
in high school. They had dated occasionally but had spent years out of touch, until they
reconnected in April 2020  when she moved back home  from out of state. They began
dating again but Applicant did not want to renew a serious relationship. In part, he said,
this  was  because  he  had  learned  that  C  was  involved  with  recreational  drugs,  like
marijuana. (GE 2 at 5; AE 10; Tr. 56-57, 98-101)
On the night in question, in March 2021, Applicant and C went out for an evening
of bowling. He said when he picked her up at her house, she had a “big gulp” of wine or
liquor, 9-12 inches tall. He believed she was intoxicated. (Tr 45-46, 64) They each had
one long island iced tea at the first bowling alley. (GE 2 at 5; Tr. 101)
Applicant  and  C  went to  another  bowling  alley  and  got  there  30 minutes  before
closing. He spoke to a woman behind the counter about keeping a lane open for them
to  use  until  closing  time.  He  said  C  was  upset  because  Applicant  was  talking  to  this
woman, and she left the bowling alley. Applicant and C then drove to his house, where
he  hoped  to  “smooth  things  over”  and  relax.  His  house  was  closer than  hers,  so  they
went there. (Tr. 59-61, 101-103)
Applicant  said   C   was  upset   and   irate   on   the   drive   home.  This  continued   when
they arrived at his house. (Tr., 62) He said  he  went to  his  room and  told  her  to  leave. He
gave  her money (for the  ride  share)  and  she  left.  He heard her outside  crying.  (Tr. 45-
48,  62-63,  104)  He  denied  grabbing  her with  both  hands,  choking  her, lifting  her up  and
slamming  her  down. He said  he  never touched  her.  He  said  she  was intoxicated.  They
each  had  a  long  island  iced  tea  at the  bowling  alley, and  she  continued  drinking  rum  at
his house  when  they  got there. (Tr. 63-64, 66)  He  did not see C again after she  left that
evening.  He   went  to   sleep.  He  denied   hearing   the   police   when   they  knocked   on   his
door. He said his first interaction  with  police  was the  next day, when  he  was arrested.
(Tr. 47, 66-67,104-105)
The police report indicates that they were called to Applicant’s apartment around
midnight. When they arrived, they found C outside crying uncontrollably. C said she and
Applicant  had  gone  to  the  bowling  alley  and  gotten  into  an  argument.  C  believed
Applicant had treated a female employee there poorly and C became upset, so they left.
(GE 4 at 4-5)
According to the police report, the argument continued at Applicant’s apartment.
They separated and C decided to leave and go home by calling a ride service. Applicant
then  re-engaged,  she  called  him  a  liar,  and  he  became  enraged  and  choked  her,
placing both of his hands on her, slamming her down on her back on the kitchen floor.
She told the officer she could not breathe, and she described her pain level as “10” on a
scale of 1-10. (GE 4 at 5)
The   investigating   officer  noted   that   he   looked   at   C’s  neck  and   “didn’t   see   any
physical  injury”   either   there  or  on   the   back  of  her  head.  C  declined   medical  treatment
and   declined   an   ambulance.  The   officer  noted   an   odor  of  alcohol  on   C’s  breath   but
noted   that  she   did not   appear intoxicated.  She   said  she   was not  sure  if  Applicant  had
been  drinking, but she  said that they  both  had  used  marijuana  that  evening. (GE  4  at 5-
6)  Applicant denied  using  marijuana  that  evening.  (Tr. 65-66)
The  report indicated  that  C  said that  Applicant  “was  a good  person  and  he  has
never physically hurt her in the past. She stated he has a good job and “didn’t  want to
ruin his life” by going to jail because of this incident. Police officers’ attempts to engage
with  Applicant  that  evening  were  unsuccessful,  as  he  did  not  come  to  the  door.  C  left
the  premises  via  a  ride  service.  (GE  4  at  6;  Tr,  104)  Applicant  was  later  charged  as
alleged. (SOR ¶ 1.a)
Applicant  began  his  testimony  by  repeatedly  asserting  that  “the  allegations
against  me  never  happened.  They  were  fabricated,”  and  “simply  did  not  happen.”  (Tr.
41,  106; Answer) He denied  hitting  or  choking  C,  and  said,  “none of  those allegations
are true.” (Tr. 44, 118) He believes C fabricated the police report in an effort to retaliate
against him for rebuffing her romantic interest. (Tr. 56-57) He denied putting his hands
on her in any way. (Tr. 106) He and C have not spoken since that evening. (Tr. 106)
In  January  2022,  prosecutors  agreed,  with  the  victim’s  consent,  to  allow
Applicant  to  enter  into  a  diversion  program.  It  included  supervised  probation  and  40
hours  of  community  service.  He  was  also  required  to  abstain  from  alcohol  and  drugs.
He  completed  the  program,  in  June  2022.  Once  that  occurred,  the  case  was  nolle
prossed. (AE 9, 11, 18a, 18b; Tr. 68-70, 106-107)
Applicant  also  began  anger  management  counseling  in  September  2021,
following an assessment. Applicant’s explanation to the assessor about what happened
with C is fairly similar to his other explanations. He “adamantly denies not [sic] putting
his  hands  on  the  young  lady.”  (AE  19a  at  3)  He  reported  that  he  stopped  smoking
marijuana  at  age  21.  The  licensed  professional  counselor  noted  that  the  precipitating
incident appears to be “isolated and a one-time incident” though she noted that he had
an  “alleged  physical  altercation  without  diffusing  it.”  A  four-week  anger  management
course was recommended. (AE 19a at 9)
Applicant  found  the  anger  management  counseling  helpful  and  has  continued
participating  in  hour-long  counseling  sessions  long  after  his  requirement  ended.  He
documented  six  sessions  (some  double  sessions)  between  September  2021  and
November 2021, 15 sessions between February and December 2022, and six sessions
between  March  and  September  2023.  (AE  19a,  19b,  22)  He  gained  insight  from  the
classes,  and  said  they  helped  with  his  communication  skills  and  interaction  with  his
community  and  family,  and  with  awareness  of  his  emotions  and  thought  process.
Applicant denied any subsequent history of violence or issues at work. He has had no
other subsequent criminal charges. (Tr. 43, 49-50, 87-88, 106-112, 122-123; Answer)
Applicant  acknowledged  mistakes.  It  had  been  years  since  he  had  been  in
trouble  with  police.  He  had  made  many  decisions  to  step  away  from  people  and
environments of trouble and focus on his career. He allowed himself to get “sucked in”
to  a  bad  situation  that  jeopardized  his  career  and  his  family.  Applicant’s  life  is
“exponentially” better than it was when he was in his early 20s. He loves his job and is
dedicated to his profession. He does not wany to jeopardize the progress he has made
in his career. (AE 10, 21a at 5, 21b, 21c; Tr. 41-45, 117-118)
Multiple  personal  and  professional  references  provided  recommendation  letters
attesting to Applicant’s character. The letters stated that he is a leader and good human
being.  He  had  a difficult  upbringing.  He  worked  to put himself  through  school.  He  is a
success  story.  (AE  12)  His  girlfriend  has  never  witnessed  any  violent  behavior.  He  is
respectful  and  gentle.  He  takes  pride  in  his  career  and  is  very  focused.  He  would  not
jeopardize what he has worked hard for. (AE 13) He has a strong work ethic, is devoted
to his career and family. He is capable of protecting secrets and is very trustworthy, (AE
14-17)  His  supervisor  at  work,  Mr.  B.,  attested  that  he  performs  his  work,  including
classified  work,  with  responsibility  and  seriousness.  He  is  a  tremendous  asset  to  the
team and adds significant value. Mr. B strongly endorses Applicants’ continued eligibility
for access to classified information. (AE 20)
