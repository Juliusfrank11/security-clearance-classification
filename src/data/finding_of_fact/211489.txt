Applicant, 42, has worked for his employer, a federal contractor, as a project lead
since  April  2018.  He  was  initially  granted  access  to  classified  information  in  2012  and
maintained  access  until  2015.  Between  2015  and  2018,  he  worked  in  private  industry
and  did  not  require  access  to  classified  information.  He  completed  his  most  recent
security  clearance application  in  November 2019, disclosing his  failure  to file  his 2016
federal  income  tax  return  as  well  as  four  delinquent  accounts.  The  investigation
confirmed  and  the  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  owed  $44,260  on  seven  defaulted
student  loans  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  –  1.e,  1.g  –  1.h);  $3,501  for  the  deficiency  balance  on  an
apartment lease (SOR ¶ 1.f); $576 for an outstanding  cell phone account (SOR ¶ 1.i);
and $75 for an outstanding medical account. (GE 1 -2; Tr. 22, 42)
Applicant has two children from different relationships. Between 2008 and 2014,
he  worked  for  another  federal  contracting  company,  earning  between  $40,000  and
$45,000 annually. He earned enough money to manage his financial obligations, which
included  informal  agreements  with  his  children’s  mothers  to  pay  each  $500  for  child
support  each  month.  In  addition  to  the  agreed  upon  amount,  he  often  contributed
between $500 and $700  of additional support to the children’s mothers as needed. To
have more money available for his children, he moved from the apartment referenced in
SOR  ¶  1.f  ($3,501)  to  a  cheaper unit.  In  2014,  his  employer  was acquired  by  another
company.  He  resigned  from  his  position  in  October  2015  after  being  informed  that  he
was  being  laid  off.  He  was  then  unemployed  for  seven  months.  In  February  2016,  he
started  a  commission-only  position  as  an  insurance  salesman.  He  also  sold  products
through a well-known national multi-level marketing company.  He did not earn enough
money to meet his financial obligations. (Tr. 22, 25-28, 32-38)
When  Applicant  became  unemployed,  he  began  to  take  steps  to  further  reduce
his expenses. Unable to maintain his apartment, he moved in with his father in October
2016.  Because  he  was  not  earning  sufficient  income  to  pay  all  his  obligations,  his
student loans became delinquent in November 2015. He returned to full employment in
April 2017. He worked in a technician position until starting his current job in April 2018,
which  paid  $64,000  annually.  Since  then,  his  financial  situation  has  changed.  He
continues to live with his father, splitting household expenses, and providing his father
support  after  he  was  diagnosed  with  a  neurocognitive  disorder  in  early  2022.  He  no
longer pays child support for his two children. His older child, now an adult, is living on
his own with his wife and child. Applicant was awarded full custody of his younger child
after  the  child’s  mother  died.  The  child  receives  approximately  $600  social  security
death benefits each month. (Tr, 23, 25, 29-31, 38-40, 46, 48-52)
In August 2021, Applicant paid off the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.f ($3,501); 1.i
($576); and 1.j ($75). Between November 2015 and March 2020, he did not make any
payments on his student loans. He testified that he tried to rehabilitate his student loans
in the past but could not recall the details of his efforts. He consolidated his loans (SOR
¶¶ 1.a – 1.e, 1.g – 1.h) into two accounts in September 2021.The loans are currently in
administrative  forbearance  under  the  Covid-19  student  loan  payment  pause  issued  by
President  Biden  in  March  2020,  which  also  covered  delinquent  and  defaulted  loans.
(See,  https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19/default)  Under  the  terms
of  the  pause,  he  is  not  required  to  take  any  corrective  actions  towards  the  loans  or
make  any  payments.  He  entered  a  rehabilitation  program  in  late  2021  and  provided
evidence  that  he  made  one  payment  of  $253.23  in  December  2021.  He  could  not
provide  information  about  the  terms  of  the  rehabilitation  program  or  the  repayment
terms of the loan once the administrative forbearance is lifted. (Tr. 23-24, 39, 41-43, 53;
AE A-E; Answer)
Applicant  considers  his  finances  to  be  stable.  He  earns  approximately  $70,000
annually. He lives within his means and has approximately $500 in disposable income
each  month.  He  has  accumulated  $2,200  in  cash  savings  and  over  $10,000  in
retirement savings. (Tr. 39, 43-44, 54-56)
