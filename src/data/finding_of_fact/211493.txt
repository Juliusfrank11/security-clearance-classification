In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.e,
1.g, 2.a, 2.b, 3.a-3.c, and 4.a. He denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c, 1.f, 1.h, 1.i,
and 4.b. He did not respond to the amendments to the SOR, and I have treated his lack
of  response  as  denials  of  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.j  and  1.k.  His  admissions  are
incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  45-year-old  senior  principal  software  development  analyst,
employed by a defense contractor since April 2020. He was employed by several private-
sector companies from May 2009 until April 2020. He was unemployed from June 2017
to January 2018, May to August 2019, and October 2019 to April 2020. His unemployment
from  June  2017  to  January  2018  occurred  after  he  was  laid  off  for  unsatisfactory
performance.
Applicant has never married and has no children. He has lived with a cohabitant
since  September  2019.  He  received  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  computer  science  in  June
2004.
The  SOR,  as  amended,  alleges  eleven  delinquent  debts,  which  are  reflected  in
credit reports from May 2023 (FORM Item 5), October 2022 (FORM Item 6), and January
2021 (FORM Item 7). The evidence concerning these debts is summarized below.
SOR ¶  1.a: credit-card account placed for collection of $15,703. The account
was  charged  off,  but  the  credit  report  from  May  2023  reflects  that  Applicant  made  a
payment in April 2023 and the balance has been reduced to $12,639. (FORM Item 5 at
6)
SOR  ¶   1.b:  credit-card  account  placed  for  collection  of  $10,129.  Applicant
settled  this  account  for  less  than  the  full  balance.  The  credit  report  reflecting  this
information does not reflect when the account was settled, or the amount paid to settle it.
(FORM Item 5 at 8)
SOR  ¶   1.c:  account  placed  for  collection  of  $9,909.  Applicant  is  making
payments on this account under a partial payment agreement. The credit report reflecting
this payment agreement does not reflect when the agreement was made, the amount of
the payments, or the balance remaining on the debt. (FORM Item 6 at 2)
SOR ¶  1.d: unsecured personal loan placed for collection of $7,458. This loan
was charged off for $12,458. The May 2023 credit report reflects that Applicant made a
payment of $780 in March 2023. (FORM Item 5 at 6)
SOR ¶  1.e: credit-card account placed for collection of $3,089. This account
was charged off for $3,089 and closed by the lender. The last payment was in February
2022. (FORM Item 5 at 5)
SOR ¶  1.f:  credit-card account placed for collection of $2,368. This account
was settled for less than the full amount. The credit report reflecting the settlement does
not reflect when it was settled, or the amount paid to settle it. (FORM Item 5 at 7)
SOR ¶ 1.g: same debt as SOR ¶ 1.e.
SOR ¶  1.h: collection account for $1,919. Applicant denied this debt, claiming it
was paid in full. The May 2023 credit report reflects an unpaid balance of $1,382. (FORM
Item 5 at 3).
SOR ¶  1.i: collection account for $1,615. Applicant denied this debt, claiming it
was paid in full. The October 2022 credit report reflects it as unpaid. (FORM Item 6 at 3.)
SOR  ¶   1.j:  credit-card  account  charged  off  for  $2,277.  The  May  2023  credit
report reflects that this account was charged off and closed. It is not resolved.  (FORM
Item 5 at 5)
SOR ¶  1.k: credit-card account referred for collection of $814. The May 2023
credit report reflects that this account is past due. The last payment was in April 2023. It
is not resolved. (FORM Item 5 at 3.)
Applicant attributed his delinquent debts to his three periods of unemployment in
2017-2020.  During  his unemployment  in  2017,  he  cashed  in  $14,000  in  bitcoin  to  pay
bills. In December 2020, his vehicle was repossessed, but he redeemed it and is current
on the payments. As of February 2021, he was earning about $140,000 per year. (FORM
Item 4, subject interview at 2-3)
Applicant’s  excessive  alcohol  consumption  is  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  2.a.  He  was
arrested for driving under the influence (DUI) in July 2010. He pleaded guilty, his license
was suspended, and he completed a nine-month diversion program, followed by three
months of probation. (FORM Item 4, subject interview at 5-6). The DUI is also alleged as
criminal conduct in SOR ¶ 4.a.
Applicant consumed alcohol heavily from 2014 to 2018. He drank six beers every
weekday and 24 beers on weekends. In 2018, Applicant decided to reduce his drinking.
He did not seek or receive treatment.  In February 2021, he told a security investigator
that he was avoiding bars and limiting himself to one drink on one night per year. (FORM
Item 4, subject interview at 5)
Applicant  had  an  alcohol-related  altercation  with  a  then  cohabitant  in  2014  that
occurred when they were both drinking heavily. The only evidence of this altercation is
Applicant’s  explanation  during  the  subject  interview  in  February  2021.  According  to
Applicant, his cohabitant  initiated the  physical contact  by biting, hitting, and scratching
him  and  smashing  a  computer  monitor  on  his  head.  During  the  altercation,  they  each
threw the other’s cellphone into the street. He was charged with felony domestic violence
and damaging a communications device, but the charges were dismissed. (FORM Item
4, subject interview at 6)
Applicant’s drug involvement is alleged in SOR ¶¶ 3.a, 3.b, and 3.c. In his SCA, he
stated that he no longer enjoys marijuana, that he stopped using cocaine because “it is
not worth the personal risk and attracts an unsavory crowd,” and he stopped using nitrous
oxide because “it negatively affects awareness while in use.” He disclosed that he used
nitrous oxide inhaled from whipped cream dispensers while unemployed from September
2017 to January 2018, and in December 2020, after being hired by his current employer.
(FORM Item 3 at 43, 44)
During  an  interview  with  a  security  investigator  in  February  2021,  Applicant
disclosed  that  he  smoked  marijuana  “a  few  times”  each  year  from  1994  to  November
2017. He disclosed that he used cocaine with friends five to seven times between July
2017 to 2018. He told the investigator that he used cocaine because a “romantic interest”
used it, but the “romantic interest” did not develop, and he stopped using it. (FORM Item
4, subject interview at 3-5)
In response to DOHA interrogatories in February 2023, Applicant stated that his
last drug involvement was a single cocaine purchase in July 2020. (Item 4 at 7) He stated
that he no longer associates with past friends who engage in drug use and heavy alcohol
use. He has not sought or received treatment or counseling for alcohol or drug use and
has  not  participated  in  any  alcohol  or  drug  rehabilitation  programs  such  as  Alcoholics
Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous. (FORM Item 4 at 8-9)
