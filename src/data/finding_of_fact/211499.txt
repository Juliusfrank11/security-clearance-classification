adopted herein as findings of fact. Additional findings of fact follow.
Background Information
Applicant  is  a  45-year-old  subject  matter  expert  level  4  employed  by  a  defense
contractor since February 2018. He seeks to retain his secret security clearance, which
is a requirement of his continued employment. (GE 1; Tr. 11-13)
Applicant  graduated  from  high  school  in  May  1994.  He  was  awarded  an
associate  of  arts  degree  in  general  studies  in  February  2009.  (GE  1;  Tr.  13-15)
Applicant was married from 2005 to 2018, and that marriage ended by divorce. He does
not have any children. (GE 1; Tr. 15-16)
Applicant served in the U.S. Marine Corps from January 1996 to January 2000,
and was honorably discharged as a sergeant (pay grade E-5). He reentered the Marine
Corps  in  May  2001  and  served  continuously  until  he  retired  as  a  staff  sergeant  (pay
grade  E-6)  in  August  2017.  His  military  occupational  specialty  at  the  time  of  his
retirement was 0848 (field artillery operations chief). (GE 1; AE E; Tr. 16-17) Applicant
has been awarded a Veterans Affairs (VA) 100% total and permanent disability rating in
part for combat-related injuries. (Tr. 17-18; AE J)
Financial Considerations
Applicant’s responsibility for the 10 delinquent SOR debts, totaling approximately
$73,828, is established by his SOR Answer; his May 2018, September 2019, and July
2021  credit  reports;  his  February 21,  2019  Office  of  Personnel  Management  Personal
Subject Interview (OPM PSI); and his hearing testimony. (SOR Answer; Tr. 19-43; GE 2
– 5)
Applicant’s  financial  problems  originated  when  he  was  married  to  his  former
spouse.  He  described  his  marriage  as  contentious,  especially  around  the  time  he  and
his wife separated in 2016. (Tr. 20, 38) Applicant’s last assignment in the Marine Corps
required him to move from the East Coast to the West Coast, however, his wife initially
chose  not  to  accompany  him.  She  was  not  employed  and  they  fell  into  debt  trying  to
maintain two  households.  (Tr. 19-21, 23) Applicant  contacted  a bankruptcy attorney in
2016 before he retired from the Marine Corps, but could not afford the filing fee. (Tr. 22)
After Applicant retired from the Marine Corps, he contacted another bankruptcy attorney
and  was  advised  that  he  was  ineligible  to  file  for  bankruptcy  because  he  earned  too
much income. That same attorney gave him two options, pay off his charged off debts,
which would not improve his credit or wait seven years until his debts fell off his credit
report. (Tr. 22-24)
I advised Applicant that ignoring his legally incurred debts by letting them fall off
his  credit  report  was  not  an  acceptable  means  of  debt  resolution  in  the  security
clearance  venue.  (Tr.  24-25)  Post-hearing,  Applicant  provided  documentation  that  he
had paid or resolved five of his ten SOR debts, and that he enrolled the remaining five
debts in a debt consolidation program (DCP), on October 6, 2021, discussed below. (AE

As  the  above  summary  reflects,  Applicant  has  paid  or  resolved  five  of  his  ten
SOR  debts, and enrolled the other five  debts  in a  DCP.  As part of  his DCP, Applicant
participated in financial counseling. The DCP that Applicant submitted is measured and
thorough. Beginning on October 15, 2021, Applicant began paying $866 each month to
the  DCP  by  direct  debit.  Applicant  will  continue  to  pay  that  amount  until  the  enrolled
debts are satisfied or otherwise resolved. The DCP also prepared a monthly budget for
Applicant  that  reflects  that  his  total  monthly  income  is  $8,300,  which  includes  $5,200
take home pay and $3,100  in VA disability  benefits. After all deductions, he has  a net
monthly remainder of $240. (AE C)
Applicant  rents  a  single  family  home  on  a  military  base  for  $2,539  per  month.
That  fee  includes  all  utilities  except  for  cable.  His  budget  further  reflects  that  he
maintains  a  modest  lifestyle  and  lives  within  his  means.  Applicant is  current  on  all his
other debts. (Tr. 39-40; AE C)
Character Evidence
Applicant  submitted  several  documents  to  include  his  DD  214s,  summaries  of
action and citations for his personal awards from his Marine Corps service, evaluations
documenting  his  performance  as  a  Marine  from  2008  to  2016,  civilian  performance
reviews documenting his performance as a Government contractor from 2018 to 2020,
and  six  reference  letters  from  former  commanders  and  supervisors.  The  collective
message  these  documents  convey  is  that  Applicant  has  honorably  served  his  country
for 20 years and five months as an active duty Marine, and continued his service as a
Government  contractor  for  the  past  four  years.  All  of  the  individuals  who  submitted
reference letters recommend and support continuation of Applicant’s clearance. (Tr. 23;
AE E – AE H)

Marine Expeditionary Unit deployments, one to the Gulf of Aden and the Persian Gulf,
and  the  other  to  Bosnia.  (Tr.  18)  As  noted,  Applicant  has  been  awarded  a  100%  VA
total and permanent disability rating in part for combat-related injuries. (AE J)
