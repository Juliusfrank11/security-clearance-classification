In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the debts alleged in the SOR
(¶¶  1.a  through  1.l),  without  further  explanation  or  information.  His  admissions  are
incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings
and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 31 years old. He has never married but he has an eight-year-old child.
He earned a certification as a pharmacy technician in 2014. He took classes at a trade
school from August 2014 to May 2015. He was employed in various jobs in the private
sector from 2013 to October 2020. He was then unemployed until September 2021, when
he began his current job as an engineer with his clearance sponsor. His SCA reflects no
prior security clearance. (Item 2)
On his SCA, Applicant disclosed a repossessed vehicle on a car loan he cosigned
with his mother, for which he owed about $12,000. (Item 2 at 28-29) He discussed that
debt, and others, in his April 2022 background interview. (Item 3) In September 2022, he
was given the opportunity to provide documentation to the DCSA CAS about what he was
doing about his various debts, but he did not provide any documents in his interrogatory
response. (Item 4)
The SOR details 13 delinquent debts, totaling about $36,400. With one exception
(SOR ¶ 1.d), the debts are established by Applicant’s admissions and by the credit bureau
reports (CBRs) in the record, from March 2022, December 2022, and April 2023. (Items
5, 6, 7). The SOR debts are detailed as follows:
SOR ¶  1.a  ($14,256) is the charged-off account relating to the repossessed car
Applicant listed on his SCA. He cosigned the loan for his mother in April 2016 and she
fell behind on payments. He has made no efforts to address this debt, leaving it to his
mother to do so. (Items 3, 5, 6) The debt is unresolved.
SOR ¶ 1.b ($6,678) is a charged-off auto account. Applicant cosigned a loan for a
woman he was dating. He said in his interview that he recognized the mistake he made
in  cosigning  on  the  loan  and  would  take  care  of  the  debt  but  provided  no  record  of
payments. (Item 3, 5, 7) The debt is unresolved.
SOR  ¶¶   1.c  ($2,197),   1.e   ($1,244),   and   1.k  ($250)  are  federal  student  loans,
alleged as past due. They are listed as past due on credit reports from March 2022 and
December  2023  (Items  5,  6)  Applicant  indicated  in  his  interrogatory  response  that  the
accounts were paid or being paid, though he provided no documentation. The accounts
are  listed  as  being  in  good  standing  in  an  April  2023  credit  report.  However,  the  “last
payment date” is listed as being in February 2020. (Items 4, 7) Thus, it is likely that the
accounts are in deferred payment status due to the COVID pandemic and not due to any
action by Applicant. Applicant has not detailed any efforts to address his federal student
loans.
SOR ¶ 1.d  ($1,891) is a  cell  phone account placed  for collection. Notwithstanding
Applicant’s admission  to  this debt in  his SOR response, this account  is not listed  on  any
credit report in the  record, and  it is not addressed  in the  interrogatory response   to  the
CAS. (Items  4-7)  I  conclude  that  this  debt  was included  in  the  SOR erroneously,  likely
due  to  a clerical error. SOR ¶ 1.d is found for Applicant.
SOR ¶  1.f ($1,212) is a medical account placed for collection. (Item 5, 6) Applicant
said that the bill relates to an ER visit in 2019. He said he was on his mother’s insurance
at the time and never received a bill. This debt is unresolved.
SOR ¶¶  1.g  ($673), 1.h  ($513) and  1.i ($307) are retail store credit card accounts
placed  for  collection  by  the  issuing  banks.  (Items  3,  5,  6,  7)  These  accounts  are
unresolved.
SOR ¶  1.j ($253) is an account placed for collection by a cable or internet provider.
(Item 6) The debt is unresolved.
SOR ¶  1.l ($6,343) is an account placed for collection by the trade school where
Applicant took classes from August 2014 to May 2015. (Items 3, 5) He said he dropped
out when his girlfriend became pregnant. (Item 3) This debt is unresolved.
Applicant reported in his interrogatory response that some of the debts have been
or  are  being  paid,  but  he  provided  no  documentation.  He  provided  a  partial  personal
financial statement that suggested a net monthly income of about $4,400 and  monthly
expenses of just over $2,000, leaving a significant remainder. However, he did not list
any  debts  that  he  was  addressing.  (Item  4)  The  record  does  not  indicate  that  he
participated in any credit counseling.
