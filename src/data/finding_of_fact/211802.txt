Applicant is 54 years old and married for the second time. He is employed as a
fuel  truck  driver  by  a  defense  contractor  and  requires  a  finding  of  trustworthiness  in
connection with his employment. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 13A, 17, and 18; Tr.
9-13, 28-30.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations)
The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  has  failed  to  meet  his  financial  obligations  and  is  therefore  potentially
unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.
He admitted all the allegations in the SOR with explanations. He also submitted additional
information to support the granting of national security eligibility.
Applicant’s  financial  issues  can  be  divided  into  four  distinct  areas:  state  and
Federal income tax issues (1.a through 1.e); 1999 bankruptcy and related debts (1.i, 1.j,
1.k,  and  1.n);  2009  bankruptcy  and  related  debts  (1.h,  1.l,  and  1.m);  and  current
delinquent debts (1.f, 1.g, 1.o, 1.p, 1.q, 1.r, 1.s, 1.t, 1.u, 1.v, 1.w, and 1.x). The allegations
will be discussed in the above order.
INCOME TAX ISSUES
With regard to his tax issues as described below, Applicant retained an income tax
advocate firm (ITA) in 2018 to assist him in resolving all of his tax issues. He remained a
client of ITA up to the date of the hearing. He stated, “I hired them to take care of all my
tax issues from way back when to present.” He provided them with a power of attorney to
resolve his tax issues with the IRS. He admitted that the ITA’s communications with him
have  been  sporadic  and  not  very  revealing.  (Government  Exhibit  3  at  6,  Government
Exhibit 5; Applicant Exhibits A and F; Tr. 33-36, 41-42.)
1.a. Applicant admitted that he had failed to file his 2010 Federal income tax return
in  a  timely  fashion.  Documentation  from  the  IRS  shows  that  he  filed  this  return  on
December 19, 2011. While the return was delinquent, it was successfully filed over ten
years ago. This allegation is found for Applicant. (Government Exhibit 4 at 11; Tr. 31-35,
67.)
1.b. Applicant admitted that he had failed to file his state 2010 tax return in a timely
fashion. As stated, he had hired ITA to resolve his state tax issues as well. He further
testified that he believed the ITA had filed this tax return. He stated that he had provided
a copy of this tax return to the Government. No corroborating evidence was contained in
the evidence provided to me by either party. (Tr. 42-46.)
1.c. Applicant admitted that he had a Federal tax lien entered against him in 2012
in  the  amount  of  $15,012.  He  testified  that  his  total  tax  liability  to  the  IRS  was
approximately  $28,000.  The  ITA  was  working  with  the  IRS  and  filed  an  Offer  In
Compromise in February 2021. No information was given as to whether the Offer was
accepted. (Government Exhibits 4 and 8; Tr, 35-42, 46-47.)
1.d. Applicant admitted  that  he  had a  state  tax  lien  entered  against  him  in 2013  in
the  amount of $1,353. This lien  was released  in 2016. He testified  that to  the  best of his
knowledge  he  did  not owe any money for his  state  taxes. (Government Exhibit 9; Tr. 42-
48.)
1.e.  Applicant  admitted  that  he  had  a  state  tax  lien  entered  against  him  in
September 2008 in the amount of $1,598. This lien was released in December 2008. As
stated, he testified that to the best of his knowledge he did not owe any  money for his
state taxes. (Government Exhibit 10; Tr. 42-48.)
It is noted that Applicant was very vague about his tax situation in general. He had
a hard time remembering dates and events. (See, for example, Tr. at 31-33.)
1999 BANKRUPTCY AND RELATED DEBTS
1.i. Applicant admitted  filing  a  Chapter 7  bankruptcy petition  on  March  8, 1999. He
received   a  discharge   in   bankruptcy of  all   of his dischargeable   debts  in  June  1999.  He
stated  that this bankruptcy was brought about because  of his divorce  from  his first wife  in
1998. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section 17; Government Exhibit 6; Attachment 1; Tr. 49-
52.)
1.j.  Applicant  admitted  having  a  judgment  entered  against  him  for  a  delinquent
medical debt in the amount of $810. This judgment is not enforceable under the terms of
Applicant’s discharge in bankruptcy. He has not made any payments on this debt and has
no plans to make payments on this debt. (Government Exhibit 13; Tr. 50.)
1.k.  Applicant  admitted  having  a  judgment  entered  against  him  for  a  delinquent
veterinary debt in the amount of $144. This judgment is not enforceable under the terms

has no plans to make payments on this debt. (Government Exhibit 14; Tr. 50-51.)
1.n.  Applicant  admitted  having a  judgment entered  against  him  for a  delinquent
debt  in  the  amount  of  $1,268.  This  judgment  is  not  enforceable  under  the  terms  of

no plans to make payments on this debt. (Government Exhibit 17; Tr. 51.)
2009 BANKRUPTCY AND RELATED DEBTS

medical debts. Applicant submitted his 2009 bankruptcy petition and related schedules.
(Applicant Exhibit F.) Schedule F of the petition sets forth Creditors Holding Unsecured
Nonpriority  Claims  in  the  amount  of  $31,508.  Many  of  them  are  medical  debts.
(Government Exhibit 7; Applicant Exhibit F; Tr. 52-55.)

loan  debt  in the amount  of $550.  This judgment  is not enforceable  under the  terms  of

no plans to make payments on this debt. (Government Exhibit 15; Tr. 60.)
1.m. Applicant admitted having a judgment entered against him for a delinquent
debt  in  the  amount  of  $700.  This  judgment  is  not  enforceable  under  the  terms  of

no plans to make payments on this debt. (Government Exhibit 16; Tr. 60.)
CURRENT DELINQUENT DEBTS
1.f. Applicant admitted having a judgment entered against him in January 2018 for
a delinquent vehicle debt in the amount of $6,800. He stated that he had been making
payments on the judgment but had to stop due to medical issues. He further stated that
he had reduced the debt to $1,500. He stated he intends to restart payments soon. No
further information was provided. This debt is not resolved. (Government Exhibit 11; Tr.
56-58.)
1.g. Applicant admitted having a judgment entered against him in February 2012
for  a  delinquent  debt  owed  to  a  credit  union  in  the  amount  of  $806.  He  has  recently
contacted the credit union, which stated that Applicant’s debt is now $2,800 and must be
paid in full. Applicant stated he intends to restart payments soon. No further information
was provided. This debt is not resolved.  (Government Exhibit 12; Applicant Exhibits A
and D; Tr. 59-60.)
1.o.  Applicant  admitted  owing  a  creditor  for  a  delinquent  debt  in  the  amount  of
$737.  He  has  not  made  any  recent  payments  on  this  debt  and  has  no  plans  to  make
payments on this debt. It is not resolved. (Government Exhibit 19 at 4; Tr. 61-62, 64.)
1.p.  Applicant  admitted  owing  a  creditor  for  a  delinquent  debt  in  the  amount  of
$664.  He  has  not  made  any  recent  payments  on  this  debt  and  has  no  plans  to  make
payments on this debt. It is not resolved. (Government Exhibit 19 at 4; Tr. 62-64.)
1.q.  Applicant  admitted  owing  a  creditor  for  a  delinquent  debt  in  the  amount  of
$615.  He  has  not  made  any  recent  payments  on  this  debt  and  has  no  plans  to  make
payments on this debt. It is not resolved. (Government Exhibit 19 at 4; Tr. 62-64.)
1.r. Applicant admitted owing a jewelry store for a delinquent debt in the amount
of  $1,462.  Subsequent  to  the  hearing he  made a  payment  of  $50 on  this account.  He
intends  to  continue  making  payments  on  this  account.  (Government  Exhibit  19  at  5;
Applicant Exhibit B; Tr. 66.)
1.s.  Applicant  admitted  owing  a  creditor  for  a  delinquent  debt  in  the  amount  of
$300, but stated in his Answer he had repaid some of it. The credit report from June 2019
indicates this account was “purchased by another lender,” and, “transferred or sold.” That
credit  report  stated  there  was  no  balance  and  that  the  account  was  closed.  The  most
recent credit report in the record, from March 2023, states there is no past due or charge
off amount on this account. Based on the current state of the record, I find this debt has
not  been  proved.  The  allegation  is  found  for  Applicant.  (Government  Exhibit  18  at  5,
Government Exhibit 19 at 6; Tr. 67-68.)
1.t. Applicant admitted owing a creditor $1,499 for a delinquent mobile telephone
bill. He testified that this bill is in error, and the creditor admits it is an error, but they refuse
to resolve it. He has taken no steps to dispute this debt with the credit reporting agencies.
This debt appears on the June 2019 credit report, but does not appear in the March 2023
credit  report.  Based  on  the  available  record  I  find  this  debt  has  not  been  resolved.
(Government Exhibit 18 at 5; Tr. 68-71.)
1.u. Applicant admitted owing a water district for a delinquent debt in the amount
of $346. He has not made any recent payments on this debt and has no plans to make
payments on this debt. It is not resolved. (Government Exhibit 18 at 5; Tr. 71.)
1.v and  1.w. Applicant admitted owing two past-due medical accounts to a hospital
in  the  amounts  of  $4,785  and  $1,016.  Subsequent  to  the  hearing  he  made  a  single
payment  to  the  hospital  in  the  amount  of  $20.  (Government  Exhibit  18  at  6;  Applicant
Exhibit C; Tr. 72-73.)
1.x.  Applicant  admitted  owing  a  creditor  for  a  delinquent  debt  in  the  amount  of
$629.  He  stated  that  he  believed  he  had  paid  this  debt  off,  but  he  had  no  supporting
documentation. It is not resolved. (Government Exhibit 18 at 7; Tr. 73.)
Applicant  stated  that  many  of  his  financial  issues  were  related  to  a  number  of
surgeries that he has had over the years. He was often on disability and his income was
reduced. However, his knowledge of his financial situation and the impact of his being on
disability status on his finances was often vague and contradictory. (Tr. 32, 76-80.)
MITIGATION
Applicant submitted a letter from his manager. The writer states, “[Applicant] is a
valuable asset to the company.” (Applicant Exhibit G.)
