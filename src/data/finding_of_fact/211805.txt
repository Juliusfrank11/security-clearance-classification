In Applicant’s April 2023 SOR response, he admitted the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶
1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, and 1.h, and he denied SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.f. The SOR alleges eight
delinquent  accounts  totaling  approximately  $17,116.  His  admissions  are  accepted  as
findings of fact.
Applicant is 47 years old. He served in the Air National Guard from 1995 through
2000. He took some online college courses in 2019 and 2020, but he has not yet earned
a degree. He married in 1999 and divorced in 2000. He married a second time in 2003
and divorced in 2011. He married a third time in 2013, and as of the date of the hearing,
Applicant and his wife were involved in a pending divorce. He has two biological sons,
ages 9 and 16, and he has three stepchildren, a set of twins who are 19 years old and a
21-year-old.  Since  April  2022,  he  has  been  employed  by  a  federal  contractor  as  a
manager of physical security and security control. His annual salary is $106,000. He does
not currently possess a DOD security clearance. (Tr. 22-24, 48; GE 1)
Financial Considerations
Applicant  testified  there  were  several  factors  that  contributed  to  his  financial
problems. Beginning in 2014, he and his spouse were the victims of identity theft. They
were  informed  by  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  that  they  owed  taxes  of
approximately  $43,000,  and  a  tax  lien  was  filed  against  them.  Applicant  was  the  sole
wage earner for the family, and he began to experience financial problems as a result of
repaying the tax lien and attempting to continue to pay his monthly expenses. He also
was found to be at fault in a car accident in 2014 and did not have car insurance. He had
to repay the other driver for the damages out-of-pocket, and he was eventually able to
satisfy  a  civil  judgment  that  was  filed  against  him  for  the  remaining  amount  of
approximately $8,000. In about early 2020, the IRS was able to determine that  identity
theft and fraud had taken place and returned approximately $18,000 that Applicant had
previously paid. He was unemployed from April 2020 to June 2020, and he used some of
the returned tax money to  pay for his family’s cost of living  and to pay other debts. He
was also unemployed from May 2018 to September 2018 and from December 2018 to
February 2019. These periods of unemployment were contributing factors to his mounting
debt. He testified that his current wife spent large amounts of money unnecessarily, and
this was an underlying reason for their pending divorce. He was either unable or unwilling
to take control of the family finances to prevent her reckless spending.  He admitted he
provided a specific timeline in his SOR response of when he planned to pay off several
delinquent debts, but due to the expense of hiring an attorney and filing for divorce, he
was unable to keep his financial commitments. (Tr. 24-29, 39-40; GE 1; AE A)
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges Applicant is indebted to a credit union for the deficiency balance

set-up a payment plan with the creditor to pay $400 a month. As of the date of the hearing,
he  had  not  made  any  payments,  and  this  debt  is  unresolved.  (Tr.  29-31;  GE  1;  SOR

have  settled  this account for approximately $855  by August 2023. As of the  date  of the

he settled this account for about $368 in June 2023, but he did not provide supporting
documentation  as  promised  while  the  record  was  held  open.  This  debt  remains
unresolved. (Tr. 34-36; GE 1, GE 4; SOR Answer)
SOR ¶ 1.e alleges Applicant is indebted to a collection agency in the amount  of
$452 for an account referred by a medical provider due to nonpayment. He contacted the
creditor in April 2023, and he was able to get a settlement offer of $226. He intended to
settle  the  account  by  June  2023.  As  of  the date  of  the  hearing,  he  had  not  made  any

SOR  ¶¶  1.g  and  1.h  allege  Applicant  is  indebted  to  a  collection  agency  in  the
amount for $170 and $105, respectively, for two accounts referred by a medical provider
due to nonpayment. Applicant intended to have these accounts resolved by May 2023.
As of the date of the hearing, he admitted he had not made any payments. These debts

Applicant  provided  a  Personal  Financial  Statement  (PFS)  post-hearing.  He
recently  moved  into  an  apartment  and  has  shared  custody  of  his  youngest  son.  His
monthly net income is approximately $3,500, and after paying his monthly expenses, he
has a net monthly remainder of $74. His PFS did not reflect any active monthly payments
toward his delinquent debts. He admitted during the hearing that he essentially lives from
paycheck to paycheck. (AE D; Tr. 45-46)
