Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b,  and  he  denied  ¶  1.c.  After  a  thorough
and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant is 41 years old. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy in November 2000, and he
received  a  medical  discharge  in  March  2002.  He  earned  a  professional  certification  in
2013. He was previously married in 2007 and divorced in 2013. He married his current
wife  in  2019.  He  has  one  adult  son.  Since  March  2021,  he  has  been  employed  by  a
federal  contractor  as  a  manufacturing  technician.  He  had  previously  worked  for  this
employer on a temporary basis in 2020. Applicant currently possesses a DOD security
clearance that was issued in December 2020. (Tr. 16, 20; GE 1, GE 2; AE C)
In   Applicant’s   April   2022   SCA,  he   did   not   disclose   any  illegal  drug   use.   SOR   ¶
1.a  alleges  that Applicant used  marijuana with  varying  frequency from  September 1996
to  March 2023.  In  his Answer, Applicant stated  that he  used  marijuana  in high  school,
but he  did not use any marijuana  while he  served  in the  U.S. Navy.  In  2012, he  ruptured
his Achilles  tendon  which required  surgery.  He was prescribed  Lortab  and  Oxycodone
for pain  management.  He did  not  feel comfortable  taking  the prescribed  narcotics,  so  he
chose  marijuana  instead  to  treat his pain  from  2012-2015. In  2016  he  ruptured   his left
Achilles  tendon,  and  although  he  was  not required  to  have  surgery, he  again  chose  to
use  marijuana  to  manage  his pain. After the  pain went away, he  used  marijuana  to  treat
symptoms   of  depression.   In   2018,   his   state   of   residence   legalized   marijuana,   and   he
obtained   a   medical   marijuana   card   to   continue   to   treat  his  depression   and   his   post-
traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD).  (GE 1; Answer)
Applicant  testified that he applied  for a  permanent  position  with  his employer in
January  2021.  He  had  previously  worked  for this  employer  as  a  temporary  employee,
and  he  was  aware  that  he  would  be  required  to  take  a  drug  test  to  be  offered  a
permanent position. SOR ¶ 1.b alleges that in February 2021, Applicant tested positive
for marijuana during a drug test given by his employer. An incident report disclosing a
positive  drug  test  was  filed  on  Applicant  in  March  2021.  In  the  SOR  Answer,  he
admitted he had used marijuana during the holidays due to depression and not working.
He had informed the federal contractor that he would test positive during the drug test
due to his medical marijuana use. He was required to show his medical marijuana card,
and he was offered a permanent position in March 2021. (Tr. 18-19; GE 2; Answer)
Applicant  provided  inconsistent  testimony  that  conflicted  with  his  Answer  when
he stated that he was prescribed a medical marijuana card in 2012 after his first Achilles
tendon  surgery.  He  stated  he  used  medical  marijuana  every  other  day  from  2012  to
January  2021.  His  medical  marijuana  card  expired  in  May  2021.  He  continued  to
purchase marijuana to treat his symptoms from another state he had moved to in  2020
that  had  also  legalized  marijuana  use  for  recreational  purposes.  According  to  his
Answer, he could not have obtained a medical marijuana card in 2012 since his state of
residence did not legalize medicinal use of marijuana until 2018. (Tr. 19-27; Answer)
Applicant  also  provided   conflicting   information   when   he   testified   that  he   was
completely   unaware   that   marijuana   use   was   illegal   under   federal   law,   and   therefore
incompatible   with   a   federal   government  contractor  employee   possessing   a   DOD
security  clearance.   He   did not   learn   that  this was  an   issue   until March  2023,  when   he
received  an  interrogatory  from  DOHA.  In  his  interrogatory  response  he  listed  that  he  last
used  marijuana  in March 2023, and  he  intended  to  use  marijuana  in  the  future. (SOR  ¶
1.c)   The   SOR   was  also  issued   in   March  2023,   and   in   his   Answer,  he   denied   that   he
intended  to  use  marijuana  in the  future.  He  had  no  intentions  of using  marijuana  as  long
as it could have  an  adverse effect on  his employment with  a  federal contractor.  (Tr. 27-
28; GE 3; Answer)
In  August  2022,  Applicant  participated  in  a  background  interview  with  an
authorized  DOD  investigator.  Applicant  was  asked  if  he  had  used  any  illegal  drugs  or
misused prescription drugs within the last seven years, which Applicant denied. He was
then confronted with the March 2021 incident report of his positive drug test. He told the
investigator that he was prescribed medical marijuana in 2012 after surgery to manage
his pain. He ended his medicinal use of marijuana in 2015, but he continued to maintain
his medical marijuana card in case he would need marijuana for pain in an emergency.
He told the investigator that he moved his family to another state in 2020, and he used
marijuana “a few times” due to lifting and carrying heavy items. He last used marijuana
in March 2020, and he had reported this to the federal contractor when he was required
to  undergo  a  drug  test  in  February  2021.  He  was  aware  of  a  co-worker  under
investigation  for  illegal  drug  use,  and  he  had  no  intent  to  use  marijuana  unless  it
became  legal  under  federal  law.  Applicant  read  the  investigative  report,  and  in  his
March  2023  interrogatory,  he  certified  that  the  information  was  accurate.  The
information  he  provided  during  his  August  2022  background  interview  is  inconsistent
with information he provided in his Answer and during his testimony. (GE 3)
Applicant provided two character reference letters from a co-worker and his wife.
They  described  Applicant  as  dedicated  and  responsible.  Although  neither  mentioned
Applicant’s  recent  use  of  marijuana,  they  held  no  reservations  about  Applicant’s
character or loyalty. (AE A and AE B)
