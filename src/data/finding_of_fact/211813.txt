purchases  in  his  October  2022  SCA,  his  November  2022  personal  subject  interview
(PSI) with an investigator, and in his July 2023 SOR answer. (Items 2-4)
Applicant stated that he began using marijuana while in college in approximately
2010.  He  lived  in  a  state  where  marijuana  is  legal  under  state  law.  He  had  a  medical
marijuana license from the state to treat insomnia. He also used marijuana because he
enjoyed  it.  He  estimated  that  he  used  marijuana  approximately  1000  times.  He  used
marijuana  by  smoking  it,  vaping  it,  and  ingesting  THC-laced  gummies.  His  most

and he no longer associates with people who use or sell marijuana. He claims his last

Alprazolam  without  a  legal  prescription  on  under  20  occasions  between  September
2014 and December 2021. He claims he primarily used it due to his insomnia and stress
during his final year of college in 2015. He claims he no longer uses this drug because
he has found other ways to deal with his stress and insomnia. He claims he no longer

Use  of  Xanax  without  a  prescription. Applicant admitted using Xanax between
August  2015  and  September  2015,  without  a  legal  prescription.  He  pointed  out  that
Xanax is the brand name for the drug Alprazolam. This conduct is the same conduct as
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c, is duplicitous, and will be found in favor of Applicant. (Items 2-4)
Use   of   Oxycodone   without   a   prescription.  Applicant  admitted  using
Oxycodone between August 2015 and September 2015, without a legal prescription. He

(Items 2-4)
Guideline E.
Applicant  admitted  the  Guideline  E  allegations.  He  admitted  that  he  stole  the
prescription  drugs  of  Xanax,  Oxycodone,  and  Hydrocodone,  while  employed  at  a
pharmacy  in  approximately  September  2015.  He  obtained  the  drugs  for  his  personal
use  without  an  authorized  prescription.  After  his  actions  came  to  light,  he  left  his
employment  by  mutual  agreement  because  of  his  theft  of  the  drugs.  He  listed  these
circumstances on his SCA. (Items 2-4)
In about September 2015, Applicant was charged by local authorities with petty
theft of the drugs described above. His case was disposed of through  a deferred entry
of judgment. He complied with all the conditions imposed by the court and the charges
were then dismissed. The underlying conduct for both SOR ¶¶ 2.a and 2.b is the same
and the pleadings are therefore duplicitous. I find in favor of Applicant regarding SOR ¶
2.b. (Items 2-4)
