Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  - 1.h  and  added  further  comments  in  his
Supplemental SOR response. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact.
After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the
following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  29  years  old.  He  has  never  married,  and  he  has  no  children.  He
graduated from high school in 2012, and he attended college from 2012-2013 and again
from 2015-2019,  when he earned  his bachelor’s  degree.  After college, he founded his
own  company  building  and  maintaining  scientific  equipment.  He  has  never  held  a
clearance. (Item 2)
Applicant disclosed marijuana use and a wide variety of other illegal drug use on
his SCA and discussed it further in his background interview, months later. His drug use
is alleged as a security concern under Guideline H.
Applicant  began   using   marijuana,  or   THC,   in  high   school,  beginning   in   about
June 2010. He began using marijuana daily in college. He  disclosed  on  his August 2022
SCA  that  his   most  recent  marijuana   use   was  in  June   2022,  two   months   before  he
submitted  his SCA.  He used  it recreationally  and  to  relax, either  alone  or at parties. He
also purchased  it  either  from  a  local dealer,  or,  after  college, by driving  to  a  neighboring
state where  it  was legal to  do  so, and  then  returning  to  his home  state  to  use  it.  (SOR ¶
1.a)  (Items 2, 3)  Applicant stated  in  his Supplemental SOR  response  that his  last  use  of
marijuana  was in  June  2020,  not June 2022.  (Item  1) He  said  on  his SCA that  he  quit
using cannabis to pursue a security clearance. (Item 2) He gave no explanation, and no
further information, for the disparity in dates.
Applicant  also  experimented  with  other  drugs  during  college.  This  included
hallucinogens  such  as  LSD,  PCP,  and  psychedelic  mushrooms,  about  once  a  month
between  August  2013  and  April  2019.  (SOR  ¶  1.b)  He  used  cocaine  at  parties,  bars,
and concerts, every few  months between  August 2016 and August 2018. (SOR  ¶ 1.c)
He snorted ketamine on one occasion, between August and October 2016. (SOR ¶ 1.d)
He used and purchased Adderall, a prescription medication that was not prescribed to
him, to assist him in concentrating and studying better, between 2012 and 2019. (SOR
¶¶ 1.e, 1.h) (Items 2, 3)
In  addition  to  his  out-of-state  cannabis  purchases  for his own  use (SOR  ¶  1.a),
Applicant  also  cultivated  psychedelic  mushrooms  between  August  2013  and  October
2016  (SOR  ¶  1.f),  and  he  both  purchased  and  sold  LSD  between  about  August  2016
and August 2018 to support his own drug use. (SOR ¶ 1.g) (Items 2, 3)
In  his  Supplemental  SOR  response,  Applicant  stated  that  he  understood  that
marijuana  is  “federally  illegal,  regardless  of  state  laws.”  He  said  he  understood  that
“drug use is incompatible with holding a security clearance.” He said, “I do not intend to
use illegal drugs in the future.” (Item 1) Applicant did not respond to  the  Government’s
FORM  or  otherwise  offer  any  mitigating  evidence  beyond  what  he  had  previously
stated.
