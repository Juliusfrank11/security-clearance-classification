Applicant  admitted  to  all  the  allegations  in  SOR.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  30-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed  with  the  defense  contractor  since  September  2016.  He  was  granted  a
security clearance soon thereafter. He is unmarried and has no children. (TR at page 14
line 11 to page 18 line 6, and GX 1 at pages 5, 10 and 28.)
Guideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
1.a. Applicant admits that he smoked marijuana once in September of 2021. He
was at a Rave party. There, one of his friends overdosed on drugs and died. Applicant
smoked marijuana to help him cope with the death and sleep that night. (TR at page 18
lines 7~13, and at page 19 line 15 to page 23 line 9.) He held a security clearance at
that time. He also used marijuana and ecstasy in the distant past. (GX 3 at page 5.)
Guideline E  - Personal Conduct
2.a.  Applicant answered, “No,”  to Section 23 on his February 2017 SF-86, as to
“Illegal Use of  Drugs or Drug  Activity  . .  . In the  last seven  (7) years,”  as he  “honestly
wasn’t sure if it (past use of marijuana and ecstasy) was before the seven years or not.”
(TR at page 18 line 13 to page 19 line 14, and GX 2 at pages 25~26.)
2.b. Applicant answered, “No,”  to Section 23 on his February 2022 SF-86, as to
“Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity . . . In the last seven (7) years.” This was a willful
falsification since he had used it in September 2021.  (TR at page 23 line 10 to page 24
line 5, and GX 1 at page 26.)
