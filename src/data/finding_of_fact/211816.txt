Applicant is a 34-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since October 2021. He is a high school graduate. He is married
with a stepchild. (GE 2)
Applicant has a  history of financial problems  and  delinquent  debts.  He attributed
his  financial  problems   to   being   young   and   naïve   about  financial  matters.  He  “thought
that   [he]   could  just   charge   it  to   a   credit  card   and   pay   it  back  later.”   He  stated   that  his
financial  problems  started   in  2012   when   he   left  a   job   because   a   supervisor  was
discriminating   against   him.  He   consolidated   his  debts  into   one   payment,   and   then
realized  that he  had  credit  on  the  other accounts  and  created  more  debts.  He felt that
because   he   was  “young   and   naïve   the   financial  institutions  took  advantage   of  the
situation  and  led  with  predatory lending  practices.”  (Applicant’s response  to  SOR; GE  2-
4; AE A)
Applicant and his father filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case in March 2019. Under
Schedule  D,  Creditors  Who  Have  Claims  Secured  by  Property,  the petition  listed  auto
loans  of  $23,308  and  $19,462,  and  $5,415  owed  to  a  retirement  savings  plan.  Under
Schedule E/F, Creditors Who Have Unsecured Claims, there were no priority unsecured
claims.  Nonpriority  unsecured  claims  totaled  $169,257.  All the  debts  were  reported  as
community debts that were incurred by both debtors. In August 2019, Applicant and his
father  filed  a  motion  with  the  court  to  dismiss  the  bankruptcy  case.  The  case  was
dismissed in November 2019. It is unclear why Applicant filed the bankruptcy case with
his father, and it is unclear why they moved to dismiss the case. (GE 2-4)
The  SOR  alleges  the  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  and  15  delinquent  debts  totaling
about  $80,000.  Applicant  admitted  owing  all  the  debts  but  stated  that  several  of  the
debts were charged off or forgiven by an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 1099-C
(Cancellation  of  Debt).  The  debts  are  established  through  Applicant’s  admissions,  a
credit  report  from  February  2022,  and  the  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  petition.  (Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 2-4; AE A)
The  creditors  for  the  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.f  ($2,645)  and  1.l  ($3,489)
charged off and  cancelled the debts through an IRS Form 1099-C. In July and August
2023, Applicant paid or settled the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.g ($1,572), 1.h ($1,452),
1.i   ($868),   and   1.o   ($961).  He  did  not  state   how  much   he   paid   to   resolve  the   debts.
(Applicant’s response to  SOR; GE  4: AE A, D-G)
The  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.b  ($28,902),  1.e  ($3,221),  1.k  ($5,345)  and  1.n
($2,511) are all owed to the same credit union. Applicant stated that he has established
a  $25  per  month  payment  plan  for  all  the  debts.  He  made  the  first  $25  payment  in
September 2023. He paid $25 toward the $844 medical debt (SOR ¶ 1.j) in September
2023. (Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 4: AE A-C)
The debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.c ($15,414) and 1.d ($2,511) are owed to a credit
union  (not  the  same  credit  union  as discussed  in above  paragraph). He  contacted  the
credit  union  and  offered  to  pay  $25  per  month  towards  the  debts.  The  credit  union
informed  him  that  the  payments  would  have  to  be  at  least  $75  per  month  to  be
considered  a  payment  plan.  He  has  not  made  any  payments  toward  this  debt.
(Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 4: AE A)
Applicant owes a third credit union $6,947 (SOR ¶ 1.p). He contacted the credit
union about a payment plan. He was told that the account was referred to a third-party
debt  collector.  He  stated  that  once  he  has  more  information,  he  will  contact  the  debt
collector about setting up a payment plan. (Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 4: AE A)
To  sum  up, two  debts totaling  $6,134  were  cancelled  through  an  IRS  Form  1099-
C;  four  debts totaling $4,853  were  paid  or settled  in August  or September  2023  for an
undisclosed   amount;   and  two  payments   of   $25   were made   in   September 2023  toward
the  other debts.  He  concluded his response to the FORM with:
As  previously  stated  I  understand  that  these  debts  are  mine  and  I  am
trying  to  have  them  taken  care  of  but  by  revoking  my  security  clearance
[eligibility  for access  to  sensitive information]  it puts me in the position  of
possibly  losing  my  position  or  being  demoted  to  a  lesser  paying  position
with my employer which in turn would result in the debts not being able to
be paid. (AE A)
