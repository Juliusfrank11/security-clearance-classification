(Item 2)
On his security clearance application dated December 16, 2021, Applicant listed
that he failed to file his 2019 federal income tax returns. The reason for not filing was due
to procrastination. He mentioned that he was working with a new tax agent to resolve and
bring current all necessary taxes. (Item 4 at 34)  In Response to Interrogatories, dated
August 25, 2022, Applicant discovered he did not file federal and state income tax returns
for tax years 2019 and 2020. He mentioned he was unable to file his income tax returns
because he had COVID-19. A tax professional was currently working on his tax issues.
He also provided documentation indicating he owed the IRS, $5,945 in delinquent taxes.
In February 2023, he applied for an installment agreement with the IRS. He paid the IRS
$3,000 up front in conjunction with this installment agreement application. (Item 5)
Applicant  indicated  that  he  understands  the  importance  of  filing  his  taxes  and
admits he failed to file his tax returns for 2019 and 2020. In the future, he intends to file
his tax returns in a timely manner unless a natural disaster or illness prevents him from
filing his tax returns. He understands the importance of timely filing his income tax returns
and  is aware that failure  to do  so may  affect his eligibility  for a  security  clearance.  He
mentioned that he filed his taxes for 2021 and hired  a tax professional to help with his
2019 and 2020 income tax returns. (Item 5 at 8)
The state tax board where Applicant works and resides provided a statement dated
February 15, 2023, indicating Applicant filed state tax returns for 2018, 2021, and 2022
and that he has no liability or pending assessments for those years. He did not file state
income tax returns for tax year 2019 and 2020. (Item 5 at 33)
In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant provided  IRS transcripts which indicate his
2019 and 2020 tax returns were received on February 3, 2023. The 2019 federal income
tax return was filed on April 24, 2023. He did not owe federal income taxes for tax year
2019. The 2020 federal income tax return was filed on March 27, 2023. He did not owe
federal income taxes for tax year 2020. Both federal income tax returns were received by
the IRS before the date of the SOR. (Item 3)
In his Response to the FORM, Applicant states he was unable to file his federal
and state income tax returns because he was ill with COVID 19. He had a severe case of
COVID and struggled to survive. He was working with tax professionals to file his returns.
His  first  tax  professional  passed  away.  In  February  2022,  he  hired  another  tax
professional who did nothing for him. Applicant then hired another tax professional who
was reliable and filed his federal income tax returns and then his state income tax returns.
Applicant  provided  a  statement  from  his  state  tax  board,  dated  June  19,  2023,  which
indicated he filed state income tax returns for tax years 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 and
he does not have pending assessments for those tax years. (Response to FORM; Item 5
at 7)
Regarding his installment agreement for delinquent taxes, Applicant mentions that
he paid $3,000 on February 3, 2023, at the beginning of the installment agreement. (Item
5  at  26)  After  this  occurred,  he  received  an  unexpected  monetary  bonus  from  his
employer. He applied the bonus towards his remaining Federal tax debt. Applicant paid
the IRS $4,338 on May 31, 2023. He provided a receipt showing proof of payment. The
receipt revealed that the installment agreement related to tax year 2017. In the future,
Applicant  intends  to  file  all  federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  in  a  timely  manner.
