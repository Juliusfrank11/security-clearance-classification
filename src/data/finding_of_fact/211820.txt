Applicant  is  51  years  old.  She  earned  an  associate  degree  in  2006  and  a
bachelor’s degree in 2010. She has been married since March 2000 and has two children,
ages 22 and 18. (Item 2)
Applicant has been employed by a federal contractor as a financial analyst since
July  2022.  From  September  2017  to  December  2021,  she  was  employed  by  the
Department of the Navy as a hardware acquisition lead. She was suspended without pay
from that position from December 2021 to March 2022 and resigned in March 2022. She
was  unemployed  until  July  2022.  She  was  previously  employed  by  government
contractors  from  May  2005  to  September  2017,  with  a  period  of  unemployment  from
March to August 2014. (Items 2-3)
Financial Considerations,  Criminal Conduct, and Personal Conduct
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges Applicant fraudulently withdrew $9,724 from
the bank account of a youth activities club between 2017 to 2019 (SOR ¶ 1.a), and that,
in  2017,  she  began  to  gamble  to  obtain  funds  to  pay  back  the  money  she  had  taken.
(SOR ¶ 1.b) Under Guideline J, the SOR cross-alleges the conduct in SOR ¶ 1.a (SOR ¶
2.a), and that in about 2021 she was charged with two counts of Felony Theft and ordered
by the court to pay $20,000 in restitution (SOR ¶ 2.b). Under Guideline E, the SOR cross-
alleges the conduct in SOR ¶¶ 1 and 2 (SOR ¶ 3.a). Applicant admitted all the allegations
in the SOR, with some explanations. (Item 1)
Applicant  volunteered  as  concession  coordinator  and  treasurer  for  a  youth
activities club from 2012 to March 2020. From 2017 to 2019, she wrongfully issued club
checks  totaling  about  $10,000  that  were  made  payable  to  herself  or  to  others  for  her
personal expenses, including a home mortgage, auto loan, and utilities. During this same
timeframe she began to play the lottery with the hope of winning enough money to pay
back  the  money  she  had  stolen  from  the  club  before  anyone  noticed.  She  started  by
occasionally  spending  $20  to  $50  on  lottery  tickets  or  playing  lottery  numbers  and
progressed to playing lottery games every other day and spending $100 to $200 per week
on lottery tickets. (Items 1-5)
In 2019, the new club president  discovered some club funds were unaccounted
for.  He informed board members and Applicant that about $10,000  in club  funds were
unaccounted for, and that it would be investigated. In March 2020, he fired Applicant from
her club positions and reported her suspected fraud to local police. In about May 2020,
she was informed by the police that she would be charged for stealing about $10,000 and
then hired an attorney (Items 3-5)
On August 23, 2021, Applicant was charged with “Theft Scheme: $1,500 to <25K”
and  “Theft:  $1,500  to  under  $25,000”  in  violation  of  the  state  criminal  code,  and
summoned  to  appear  in  court  in  October  2021.  (Item  4  at  2-3)  Each  offense  was
punishable by up  to  five  years  imprisonment  and a $10,000  fine. Each charge  alleged
that from about January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019, Applicant stole $9,754 from the
youth club. The first charge included the additional language that her theft was “pursuant
to a scheme and continuing course of conduct.” A local news outlet reported her name
and case details the next day. (Items 4-5)
On September 8, 2021, Applicant sent an email to a Navy security official admitting
she  had  made  fraudulent  withdrawals  from  the  youth  league  bank  account  totaling
$9,724. She also stated that:
My family was struggling  at  this time  and  I didn’t want to  lose  our house  or
our means  of transportation  to  get to  and  from  our employment.  At the  time
I was struggling  with  a  gambling  addiction. Once  my husband  found  out,  I
almost  lost  my family and  everything  else.  He  has  stood  beside  me, and  I
haven’t gambled  in over a  year and  a  half. As distorted as it is, my thought
process at the  time  was, I would win  enough  gambling  to  back anything   I
took from the [club]  account  plus more.  I know this doesn’t sound  right,  but
my  mind   was   messed   up   at  the   time.   I   do   believe   these   charges   will   be
dropped or dismissed, as full restitution will be made to the league.  Per my
attorney,  there  is  a   possibility  that  the   [district  attorney]   may  say  that  we
need  to  pay  more to  league, and  we  are prepared  to  do  that if that is what
it  takes  to   make   this  go   away.  I  have   never  been   so   ashamed   and
disappointed   in  myself.  I   have   never been   in   any   trouble   before   and   fully
intend to never be in any trouble again, ever. (Item  4  at 1)
Applicant  disclosed  she  had  been  charged  with  stealing  money  from  a  youth
organization in her August 2022 security clearance application (SCA). During a November
2022,  subject  interview  (SI)  with  a  government  investigator,  she  made  the  following
statements.  She  started  stealing  club  funds  because  she  could  not  pay  the  family’s
monthly expenses after her husband’s commission-based income dropped from $5,000
to $2,000 a month. She did not tell her husband that she could not pay the family’s bills
because she did not want to hear from him about why they did not have enough money
when their shortfall was attributable to his income reduction. She acknowledged that her
gambling during this timeframe  did not help their financial  situation but  wanted  to play
because of the chance to win big and to repay the stolen money. She denied stealing the
funds to support her gambling or being addicted to gambling and said she did not go to
gamblers anonymous. She was never late on her bills from 2017 to 2019. She stopped
stealing club funds and quit playing the lottery in 2019 after her pay increased and her
husband found a better paying job. Although she was then able to pay the family’s monthly
bills, she did not have sufficient funds to start repaying the stolen club funds. She did not
tell anyone about her misconduct, including her husband, until after she was fired as club
treasurer in March 2020. (Item 2 at 33-34, Item 3 at 7-10)
Applicant said that she never went to court because the matter was settled out of
court and that the settlement required her to pay $20,000 even though she stole about
$10,000. She estimated that she paid the settlement in about July 2021 but provided no
documentary evidence of a settlement agreement or restitution payment. Based upon her
statement to Navy security personnel, I find that no restitution payment was made before
September 8, 2021. She said she paid restitution with funds obtained through loans. She
reported in her SCA and told the government investigator that the charges were dropped
and had been expunged from her record. In November 2022, she told the investigator the
charges had been expunged in December 2021 and  that she would provide evidence.
The  government  investigator  reported  receiving  documents  subsequently  provided  by
Applicant including “expungement paperwork, copies of her bank statement to show proof
of  payment  to  [her  friend],  and  [her]  loan  paperwork”  and  the  investigator  reported
attaching those documents to the SI, but those documents were not included in the FORM
or submitted by Applicant. (Item 2 at 33-34, Item 3 at 6-10, 12)
In response to the SOR, Applicant explained that it had been more than three years
since she stole from  the  youth  club  and  that  she  “was not ordered  by the  court to  pay
restitution, this was an  agreement between  myself and  the  organization.” (Item  1  at 4)
Her response to the FORM included the following: She reiterated that “payment of the
funds was by agreement and not court ordered as the case never went to trial [and that
she]  was  willing  to  make  any  restitution  required  to  make  things  right.  As  far  as  the
gambling, I was not a gambler before the incident, and I have not gambled in almost 3
years.”  She  noted  that  she  had  always  intended  to  repay  the  money;  that  she  can  be
trusted to report negative conduct because she had reported this incident in the past and
had previously reported an old bankruptcy to a prospective employer. She acknowledged
exercising poor judgement and said her actions negatively affected her entire life. She
said  that  nothing  like  this  would  ever  happen  again  and  that  her  trustworthiness,
judgement,  and  reliability  had  not  otherwise  been  called  into  question  during  her
approximately 30  years  of  working  for the  government  or as  a  government  contractor.
She stated her desire to continue supporting the government. Her responses to the SOR
and FORM did not include any supporting documentary evidence. (AE A)
