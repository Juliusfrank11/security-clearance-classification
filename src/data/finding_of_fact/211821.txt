Applicant, age 29, is an employee of a DOD contractor who is seeking to maintain
his  security  clearance.  He  has  worked  for  the  same  employer  in  an  overseas  location
since July 2022. He served on active duty in United States Army from May 2014 to August
2017. He separated with an honorable discharge. He has a high school diploma and some

The  SOR  alleged  eight  delinquent  debts,  with  a  combined  approximate  total  of
$32,392, to include: a $14, 661 charged-off automobile loan (SOR ¶ 1.a: Item 4 at 2; Item
5 at 2; Item 6 at 4); a $12,354 charged-off account  owed to a credit union for another
automobile loan (SOR ¶ 1.b: Item 4 at 3; Item 5 at 2; Item 6 at 4); a $1,826 charged-off
account (SOR ¶ 1.c: Item 3 at 4; Item 5 at 2); a $1,722 charged-off account (SOR ¶ 1.d:
Item 4 at 3; Item 5 at 2); a $1,228 cellphone account that was placed for collection (SOR
¶ 1.e: Item 5 at 3; Item 6 at 4); a $295 charged-off credit card account (SOR ¶ 1.f: Item 4
at 5; Item 5 at 3; Item 6 at 5); a delinquent cellphone account in the amount of $170 placed
for collection (SOR ¶ 1.g: Item 5 at 3);  and a $136 account placed for collection  (SOR ¶
1.h: Item 4 at 4)
In  his response  to  the  SOR, Applicant admitted  the  allegations in SOR ¶¶  1.a, 1.b,
and  1.e. He  denied  the  allegations  in SOR ¶¶  1.c,  1.d, 1.f  –  1.h.  With  regard to  SOR ¶¶
1.c and  1.d, he  claimed  the  company  has permanently closed.  He claimed  he  cancelled
the  credit card  alleged  in SOR ¶  1.f  and  no  longer uses it. He denied  the  $1,228  cellphone
debt   alleged   in  SOR  ¶   1.g   because   he   transferred   to   another   provider.  He   is  not   sure
where the  debt  came  from. Finally, he  denied  the debt alleged  in SOR ¶  1.h  because  he
did  not recognize the debt.
Applicant did not provide evidence indicating that he is attempting to pay or resolve
any of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. In his response to the SOR, he indicated
he really needs a security clearance so he can keep his job. He briefly stopped paying
his debts because he arranged to put his wife and children into a house before he went
overseas for his job and focused on his essential expenses. He claimed the debts owed
to the creditor in SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d were paid. He did not provide proof that the debts
were resolved.  He is currently looking into debt consolidation. He hopes to pay everything
off all at once. (Response to SOR).
Applicant  had  several  periods  of  unemployment  within  the  past  five  years.  His
recent period of unemployment was from October 2021 and July 2022. After separating
from active duty, he was unemployed from August 2017 to October 2018.
