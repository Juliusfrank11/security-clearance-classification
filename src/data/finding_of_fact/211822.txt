In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted all the allegations, with explanations. His
admissions  are  adopted  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  review  of  the  pleadings  and
evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  He began working
at his present job in approximately June 2023. He works in the information technology
(IT) career field. He has an associate degree. He is married for the second time and has
three children from this marriage. (Tr. 6, 12-13, 27, 30; GE 1)
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant  owed  nine  delinquent  accounts  (personal  loans,
credit  cards,  delinquencies  from  vehicle  repossessions,  and  consumer  debts)  totaling
approximately  $85,000.  The  debts  are  established  by  credit  reports  from  August  2022
and April 2023; Appellant’s SOR admissions; and his hearing testimony. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a–
1.i). (Tr. 19, 32, 39-44; GE 3-4; SOR answer)
Applicant admitted all the SOR debts during his testimony. He also admitted that
he has not made any payments toward any of the  debts as of the date of the hearing.
He stated that the reason for his financial difficulties was because his wife was involved
in a near-fatal car accident in November 2016. Before the accident, she had a full-time
job, but afterward she was unable to work. She collected short-term disability payments
from her employer for some time, but  eventually  had to  utilize  the Family  and Medical
Leave Act (FMLA). This put her in a non-pay status for an extended period of time. She
has never gone back to work, preferring instead to be a stay-at-home mother with their
children. (Tr. 13, 15, 31-32, 35-36, 39-44)
Because of the accident, Applicant’s wife incurred approximately $100,000 worth
of medical bills not covered by insurance. In order to support his household without his
wife’s income, Applicant began using credit cards and obtaining personal loans. He was
unable to make regular payments on them so he consulted with a bankruptcy attorney.
He  was  advised  by  the  attorney  to  stop  paying  his  creditors  and  file  for  bankruptcy,
preferably  under  Chapter  13.  He  stopped  paying  his  debts  in  early  2018.  Applicant
testified because of the pandemic and delays by his attorney, a bankruptcy petition was
never  filed.  Upon  further  contact  with  his  bankruptcy  attorney,  it  was  suggested  that
since  many  of  the  debts  had  “fallen  off”  his credit  report  because  of  being  over  aged,
that  Applicant  could  continue  with  this  course  of  action.  A  bankruptcy  filing  would
resurrect the delinquent debts and Applicant chose not to have that happen. (Tr. 16-17;
GE 4)
In August 2017, Applicant sold his home and received proceeds of approximately
$35,000.  He  used  these  proceeds  to  pay  non-SOR  loans  from  family  and  friends  that
totaled  approximately  $40,000.  None  of  these  proceeds  were  used  to  pay  any  SOR
debt. At some point, Applicant’s wife inherited approximately $35,000 from her father’s
estate. None of these funds were used to pay any SOR debt. In May 2019, Applicant’s
wife settled the lawsuit that resulted from her car accident. She received approximately
$100,000  from  the  settlement.  Applicant  testified  that  the  entire  amount  went  to  pay
their attorney and to the unpaid medical bills. No supporting documentation was offered.
None of this amount went to pay any SOR debt. (Tr. 14-15, 33, 35-36, 46-49)
Applicant  testified  that  the  credit  cards  and  lines  of  credit  taken  out  were
supposed to be in his wife’s name only. His credit reports show that he is named either
as  a  joint  debtor  or  the  individual  debtor  on  all  the  SOR  debts.  He  failed  to  present
documentary evidence to the contrary. (Tr. 53; GE 3-4)
Applicant’s current financial picture shows that he has approximately $600 as a
monthly  residual  after paying  his current  expenses.  He  does  not  use  a  formal  budget.
He has approximately $9,000 in savings and $30,000 in a retirement account. He and
his  family  live  in  his  deceased  mother’s  house,  which  is  owned  by  a  family  trust.  He
does not have a monthly home or rent payment. He owns two cars that are fully paid.
He  presented  no  evidence  of  financial  counseling,  other  than  his  discussion  with  his
bankruptcy attorney. (Tr. 36-37, 48, 51)
