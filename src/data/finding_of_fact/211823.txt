In  his  answer to  the  SOR, Applicant  admitted  all  nine  financial allegations, SOR ¶¶
1.a  through  1.i, without comment. His  admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  52-year-old  logistics  technician  working  full  time  with  a  defense
contractor  since  February  2022.  He  worked  with  a  different  defense  contractor  from
November 2018 through January 2022. He stated he was unemployed for about a month
when that contract ended.
From March 2015 through about October 2017, Applicant worked as a commercial
driver. He disclosed he was summarily dismissed from the position after he declined to
take  on  new  stops  which,  he  stated,  would  have  increased  his  workload  beyond  his
existing 11–12-hour workday. He stated he was unemployed for about nine months prior
to accepting a position in July 2018, where he worked as a lead housekeeper, until finding
a new position more related to his technical field in November 2018. (Items 3 and 6)
During  his  periods  of  unemployment,  Applicant  stated  he  was  supported  by
unemployment  benefits  and  savings  from  his  401(k)-retirement  plan.  No  additional
information  was  provided  concerning  potential  tax  consequences  created  by  his  early
withdrawal of his 401(k)-retirement funds. (Items 3 and 6)
Applicant was previously married from 1994 to about 2006. He has been married
to his second wife since August 2007. He has three children ages 19, 16, and 14 years
old. (Items 3 and 6)
The SOR alleges nine delinquent debts totaling about $47,900. Applicant admitted
all debts alleged in the SOR. He described his overall financial situation as being able to
pay expenses with no money left over. (Item 6 at 11) He stated he and his wife have jobs
and are trying to better themselves. In July 2022, the DOD investigator provided Applicant
an  opportunity  to  submit  documentary  evidence  concerning  his  financial  situation.
However, Applicant declined stating he discussed the matter with his wife, and that they
determined no extra funds were available to pay delinquent debts because of expected
expenses  for  school,  children’s  birthdays,  and  holidays.  He  was  afforded  several
opportunities to submit documentary evidence to support his case, but he never did. He
did not respond to the FORM; nor did he provide documents or materials in answering
the SOR. (See Item 6 pp. 11-12)
The evidence concerning debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below.
SOR  ¶   1.a   ($32,882):  The  oldest  delinquent  debt  is  a  joint  mortgage  account
opened in August 1999. The last payment on the account was made in May 2018. The
debt was charged off in about 2021. (Item 4 at 3; and Item 5 at 2)
This is a mortgage on a mobile home. Applicant stated he became delinquent on
his  mortgage  when  he  lost  his  job  in  October  2017.  He  stated  he  paid  his  $30,000
mortgage for about 22 years, but that the balance he owed was reduced by only $1,000
during  this entire period.  He  asserted his  belief  that  his mortgage was  not  legal  under
state  law  because  it  exceeded  seven  years.  He  presented  no  proof  to  support  his
assertion, nor did he explain further. Applicant stated he ultimately decided to abandon
his  home  because  he  was  unable  to  pay.  He  did  not  notify  or  communicate  with  the
creditor when he abandoned the home in about 2021; nor has he communicated with the
creditor since that time. (Item 6 pp. 8-9). This debt is unresolved.
SOR ¶¶  1.b  ($8,857) and 1.c  ($3,573): Applicant admitted both delinquent debts,
stating he had credit cards with both creditors. He stated both debts were about $7,000
each, with monthly payments of about $300 per account. He disclosed he stopped making
payments and communicating with creditors because he lacked income after losing his
job.  Both  accounts  are  listed  as  individual  accounts  and  both  appear  in  his  June  and
December 2022 credit bureau reports. (Items 4 and 5) SOR ¶ 1.b was opened in April
2016  and  the  last  payment  credited  towards the  account  occurred in  December 2017.
The account was charged off in about May 2022. (Item 4 at 5; and Item 5 at 2) SOR ¶ 1.c
was assigned for collection in August 2018, and debt amount remained the same in his
December credit bureau report. Both delinquent debts are unresolved.
SOR ¶¶  1.d  through  1.g  (altogether totaling  $2,145): Applicant  admitted  all  four
consumer debts in  SOR ¶¶ 1.d through 1.g, without comment. He  stated he  believed  the
debt  in SOR ¶  1.d  was  a  credit card  account he used  to  purchase  holiday gifts. SOR ¶¶
1.e  and  1.g  were  balances on  mobile  phone  or wireless accounts  for early termination
fees  or similar charges.  Applicant  did not  communicate  with  the  creditors regarding  these
debts, as in other instances, because  of his inability to  pay. Applicant did  not recall  the
reason  for the  debt  in SOR ¶  1.f  because  he did not recognize the  creditor. (Item  6  at  10)
All four delinquent debts are listed  as individual accounts. Two accounts,  SOR ¶  1.d and
1.g, were  opened  in October 2018. SOR ¶ 1.f was opened  in July 2019, and  SOR ¶ 1.e,
the   most  recent  debt,   was  opened   in   October  2021.  All   of   these   debts   remain   in   a
collection status. (See  Items 4  at  4; and Item  5 pp. 3-4)  These  debts are unresolved.
SOR ¶¶  1.h  ($216) and 1.i  ($237): Applicant  admitted  delinquent  debts in  SOR ¶¶
1.h  and  1.i,  without commenting  or providing  clarifying  information.  During  his  July  2022
interview  with  investigators, he  stated  he  believed  at  least one  medical debt  related  to  a
$2,000  bill he owed  for  treatment. He stated  he  paid  about $100  per month  for two  years,
pursuant to  an  arrangement  with  the  creditor,  but  that it  is possible  mail  related  to  this
debt was not forwarded  to  him  after  he  moved. He had  no  further information  concerning
this debt.  (Item 2; and  Item  6 at 10)
A detailed review of the credit reports in the record indicates SOR ¶¶ 1.h and 1.i
are the same underlying debt. Evidence for SOR ¶ 1.h lists the original debt as $162 with
an outstanding balance of $216, with activity and assignment dates listed as March 2021
and  April  2021  respectively.  (Item  5  at  4)  Similarly,  evidence  for  SOR  ¶  1.i  shows  the
same  underlying  information  in  “3rd  party  collection  details.”  (Item  4  at  2)  The  original
debt was listed as $162, with a balance of $216.00. The debt in SOR ¶ 1.i was reassigned
to a new collection agency in September 2022. After reassignment, the collection balance
increased from $216 to $237. (Item 4 pp. 1-2) The debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.h and 1.i
are duplicate accounts. SOR ¶ 1.i is therefore resolved in Applicant’s favor.
