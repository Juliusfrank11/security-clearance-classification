In Applicant’s answer, he admitted all of the SOR allegations under Guideline H,
and partially admitted one allegation under Guideline F and denied the other allegation.
(¶¶ 1.a-1.f, and 2.a-2.b) I adopt his admissions as findings of fact. After a thorough and
careful  review of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the  following  additional
findings of fact. (Item 2)
Applicant  is  34  years old.  He  is  single,  never  married,  and  has  no  children.  He
has worked as a systems manager for his current employer, a federal contractor, since
July 2019. That contractor is subject to the drug-free workplace provisions of 41 U.S.C.
701 et seq. Applicant is a high school graduate who has taken some college courses.
He  completed  a  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  for  his  current  job  in  February
2022. (Tr. 6, 18-20; GE 1)
The SOR alleged, under Guideline H, that Applicant:
-used  and  purchased  marijuana,  at  various  times,  from  June  2006  to
about December 2022 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.b);
-tested  positive  for  illegal  drugs  in  2009,  preventing  him  from  enlisting  in
the U.S. Air Force (SOR ¶ 1.c);
-was  cited by  police  for illegal  possession  of  drug paraphernalia  in  about
2010 (SOR ¶ 1.d);
-was cited by police for illegal possession of marijuana in June 2018 (SOR
¶ 1.e); and
-resigned  from  his  position  as  a  police  dispatcher  in  lieu  of  termination,
because of his June 2018 citation for illegal possession of marijuana (SOR
¶ 1.f).
The SOR alleged, under Guideline F, that Applicant:
-failed  to  timely  file  his  federal  income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2016,
2017, 2018, and 2021 (SOR ¶ 2.a); and
- failed to timely file his state income tax returns for tax year 2021 (SOR ¶
2.b).
Guideline H.
Marijuana use and purchase and possession.
Applicant admitted his marijuana use and purchases from 2006 to approximately
February  2022,  in  his  February  2022  SCA, his  March  2022  personal  subject  interview
(PSI) with an investigator, his December 2022 answers to DOHA interrogatories, and in
his January 2023 SOR answer. He also admitted his positive drug test in 2009, which
prevented his enlistment in the Air Force, and his citations for possession of marijuana
in  2018  and  possession  of  drug  paraphernalia  in  2010.  During  his  PSI,  he  told  an
investigator  that  when  he  was  using  and  purchasing  marijuana,  he  knew  it  was  illegal
under  federal  law  and  against  his  current  employer’s  policy.  He  also  testified  that  he
knew marijuana use was illegal under federal law. (Tr. 27, GE 1-2; SOR Answer)
Applicant  used  and  purchased  marijuana  over  the  years  for  recreational
purposes  and  as  pain  management  for  his  back  and  joints.  He  used  marijuana  by
smoking  it  and  consuming  edibles.  He  testified  that  he  still  uses  marijuana  on  a  less
than regular basis. He resides in a state where marijuana is legal under state law. He
testified that his most recent use of marijuana was in August 2023. He estimated that he
used marijuana “less than a dozen times” from January 2023 to August 2023. (I will not
use his admissions concerning his use of marijuana after April 2022, as alleged in the
SOR,  for  disqualification  purposes,  but  I  may  use  this  information  in  assessing
mitigation and in my whole-person analysis) (Tr. 20, 25, 30) He was asked if he planned
on continuing to use marijuana in the future, and he responded as follows:
It's very possible. I mean, if I go with this, if I get approved for this,  I will
definitely not be smoking until it’s legalized federally. (Tr. 27)
Guideline  F.
Federal and State Tax Return Filings.
In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted that he failed to timely file his 2017-2018
federal  income  tax  returns.  He  claimed  he  was  unaware  of  not  filing  his  2016  federal
return  in  a  timely  manner,  and  he  claimed  he  filed  an  extension  for  his  2021  federal
return. He also claimed he filed an extension for his 2021 state income tax return. (SOR
answer)
Applicant  testified  that  he  failed  to  timely  file  his  2017  and  2018  federal  tax
returns. In the past, his parents always reminded him to do his taxes, but he no longer
lived  with  them  and  no  one  reminded  him  to  do  so  for  these  years.  He  did  not  think
about his taxes again until he began the security clearance process. He claims that his
federal tax  returns  for 2016,  2017,  2018  and  2021  have  all been  filed.  He  also  claims
that  his  2021  state  tax  return  has  been  filed.  (Tr.  20-21,  23-24)  He  provided  some
copies of tax transcripts that show the following:
TY   2016-Federal-No  transcript  provided.  The  record  was  kept  open  for  two
months, but Applicant did not submit any additional information for this tax year;
TY 2017-Federal-No transcript provided. He claims he received a document from
the IRS stating that it was working on this year’s return, but he did not provide a copy of
the document. The record was kept open for two months, but Applicant did not submit
any additional information for this tax year;
TY  2018-Federal-A transcript indicates that this return was filed in April 2022;
TY   2021-Federal-A  transcript  indicates  that  this  return  was  filed  in  September
2022, within the allowed time frame if an extension was requested;
TY  2021-State-No transcript provided. The record was kept open for two months,
but Applicant did not submit any additional information for this tax year. (Tr. 23, 31, 36;
GE 2)
