Applicant  admitted  all  the  SOR  allegations  in  his  Answer.  He  is  35  years  old,
married,  and  he  has  four  minor  children.  He  graduated  from  high  school  in  2007.  He
attended various colleges between 2014 and 2020, but he did not earn a degree. As of
his June 2021 security clearance application (SCA), he previously owned a home from
February  2015  to  September  2016  in  state A,  and  he  has  owned his  home  in  state  B
since February 2018. (Answer; Items 1-3; Form Response)
Applicant  served  in  the  U.S.  military  from  August  2007  to  March  2015.  He
deployed  to  Iraq  from  December  2009  to  November  2010.  He  was  honorably
discharged in March 2015. He has since worked for various DOD contractors. As of his
SCA  and  since  August  2017,  he  has  worked  as  a  field  systems  engineer  for  his
employer, a DOD contractor. He was first granted a security clearance in 2007. (Items
3, 8)
The   SOR   alleges  that   Applicant  had   three   delinquent  consumer  debts:  an   auto
loan  charged  off  for  $19,347  (SOR ¶  1.a);  an  apartment  rental account  in collection  for
$7,242   (SOR  ¶   1.b);  and   a   charged-off   loan   for  $23,146   (SOR  ¶   1.c).   The   allegations
are  established   by   Applicant’s   admissions   in  his  Answer,  his   SCA,   his  June   2022
response   to   interrogatories,  and   credit  bureau   reports  from   August  2021,  November
2022,  and   July 2023. The   August  2021   credit  bureau   report   lists   the   debts   in  SOR  ¶¶
1.a  and  1.c. The  November 2022  and  July 2023   credit bureau  reports  list  the  debts in
SOR ¶¶  1.a  and 1.b. (Items 1-7)
Applicant attributes his delinquent debts to minimal income, relocation costs, the
high  cost  of  living  in  state  A,  and  his  spouse’s  and  father-in-law’s  unforeseen  medical
expenses. He stated in his response to interrogatories that his spouse worked only part
time  and  her  income  fluctuated.  He  acknowledged  that  he  and  his  spouse  were  also
financially  overextended;  they  utilized  credit  cards  to  meet  their  financial  obligations;
and  they  incurred  some  of  their  medical  expenses  when  they  voluntarily  elected  in
approximately 2017 not to have medical coverage. He stated in his SCA:
Took  on   loans  and   credit  card  debt   in  order  to   fund   relocations.   Shortly
after  had   healthcare   expenses  not   covered   by  insurance.   Our  revolving
debt ate  up  all   our disposable  income  and  we  had  to   use   credit cards  to
stay afloat.   (Answer; Items  3, 7; Form Response)
Applicant obtained the car loan in SOR ¶ 1.a to purchase a car necessary for him
to commute from state B, where he resided with his family, to state C, where he worked.
The  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.b  is  for  the  cost  of  breaking  the  lease  on  the  apartment  that
Applicant’s father-in-law resided in when it was no longer feasible for him to live on his
own due to his health issues. Applicant stated in his Answer that after he unsuccessfully
attempted to negotiate a  monthly payment arrangement of $200 with the management
company, he stopped hearing from the company. He did not provide documentation to
corroborate his efforts to resolve this debt. Applicant obtained the loan in SOR ¶ 1.c to
assist  with  relocation  costs,  debt  consolidation,  and  to  pay  for  his  spouse’s  medical
expenses. They could not afford the monthly minimum payment for the loan. He stated
in his SCA that this debt was sent to a debt servicing agency (Company B). This debt is
only  reported  on  the  August  2021  credit  bureau  report.  The  November  2022  and  July
2023  credit  bureau  reports  reflect  that  this  charged-off  debt  has  a  zero  balance.
(Answer; Items 3, 4, 5, 7; Form Response)
Applicant  stated  that  in  his  SCA  he  was  working  with  a  debt  consolidation
company  (Company  A)  to  resolve  his debts.  He  also  stated  that  Company  A  provided
him with financial counseling. In his response to interrogatories, he acknowledged that
he  had  not  paid  the  debts  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.c.  He  stated  that  he  and  his  spouse
intended to pay their smaller debts first before tackling the larger ones.  He noted in his
June  2022  personal  financial  statement  (PFS)  that  he  allotted  a  monthly  payment  of
$623 to Company A. He stated  in his Form Response that  he and his spouse were in
touch  with their creditors.  He  also  stated that  they  listed  their home  for sale,  and  they
intended  to  use  any  profit  to  resolve  their  debts.  He  also  stated  that  they  were
downsizing to reduce their monthly expenses, and they intended to sell the car that he
purchased with the loan in SOR ¶ 1.a and use the profit to resolve the outstanding loan
balance.  He  did  not  provide  documentation  to  corroborate  his  efforts  to  resolve  his
debts through Company A, to include any payments he has made to date to Company
A, and he did not provide documentation to corroborate his efforts to resolve his debts
directly with the creditors. (Items 3, 7; Form Response)
Applicant’s  June  2022  PFS  reflects  a  net  monthly  income  of  $12,662.  After
expenses,  to  include  the  monthly  allotment  of  $623  to  Company  A,  his  monthly  net
remainder was $306. The July 2023 credit bureau report lists three additional charged-
off  credit  cards,  for  $2,013,  $7,275,  and  $12,282,  respectively,  that  are  not  alleged  in
the  SOR.  I  will  not  consider  these  unalleged  debts  in  evaluating  the  disqualifying
conditions under this guideline; however, I will consider this information in my mitigation
and whole-person analysis. (Item 4)
