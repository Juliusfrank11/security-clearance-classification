In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations in the SOR. His
admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 32-year-old data scientist employed by a defense contractor since
September 2022. He was employed in non-government jobs from February 2010 until he
was  hired  by  his  current  employer.  He  attended  a  university  from  September  2009  to
March 2012 but did not receive a degree. He has never married and has no children. He
has never held a security clearance.
The SOR alleges the following three delinquent debts, reflected in a credit bureau
report dated April 4, 2023:
•  SOR ¶ 1.a alleges a credit-card account that was charged off for $2,724. The last
payment on this account was in August 2018. (FORM Item 5 at 3)1
•   SOR ¶ 1.b alleges a credit-card account that was charged off for $5,602. The last
payment on this account was in April 2017. (FORM Item 5 at 7)
•   SOR ¶ 1.c alleges a credit-card account that was charged off for $5,537. The last
payment on this account was in April 2017. (FORM Item 5 at 8)
When  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  security  investigator  in  October  2022,  he
admitted that he had taken no action to resolve  the debts alleged in the SOR. (FORM
1 The page numbering of FORM Item 5 begins with page 3.
Item 6 at 8) In his answer to the SOR, he admitted that he made poor financial decisions
and allowed himself to be trapped in high-limit credit-card accounts. He stated that his
income had tripled in the last eight months preceding his receipt of the SOR, going from
$40,000 per year to $120,000 per year. He also stated that his credit advisor had advised
him to wait until he made a down  payment on a home before beginning to pay  off  his
delinquent debts. He has followed the advisor’s advice.  The record does not reflect the
credentials or qualifications of his credit advisor.
When Applicant submitted his SCA, he disclosed that he had traveled overseas as
a tourist in December 2017, July 2017, December 2018, and April 2019. (FORM Item 3
at 29-39) He did not explain how he financed these trips, which occurred after he stopped
making payments on the delinquent debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c and before he
experienced his significant increase in income.
