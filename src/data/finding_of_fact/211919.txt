Applicant  admitted  to  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b.  and  2.c.  She  denied
SOR allegations ¶¶ 2.a, and 2.b. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings,
exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  29-year-old  employee  of  the  United  Nations  (UN).  She  has  been
employed  with  the  UN  since  March  of  2020.  Applicant  is  not  married,  and  has  no
children. (TR at page 23 line 22 to page 25 line 17, and GX 1 at pages 13 and 21.)
Guideline B - Foreign Influence
1.a. Applicant admits  that,  in  the  past,  she  had  close  and  continuing  contact with
relatives who  are  citizens and  residents of  Iraq.  She  has ceased  her contact with  these
Iraqi  relatives since  receipt  of  the SOR  in June  2023. These  relatives are: her 70-year-
old  grandmother,  who   never  worked   outside   of  her  home;  her  85-year-old  grandfather
who   is  long   retired   but  never  worked   for  the   Iraqi  government;   her  45-year-old  uncle
who  is a pharmacist;  her 56-year-old uncle  who  is  a  security  guard;  her 40-year-old  aunt
who  is a  homemaker;  her 28-year-old  cousin  who  works for the  UN  in Switzerland; her
55-year-old   uncle   who   is  a   driver   for   the   UN  in  Iraq;   and   finally,   her   47-year-old   aunt
who   works  for  the   Red   Cross.   (TR   at   page   40   line   7   to   page   52   line   23.)   All   of  her
immediate  family, comprising  her parents and  siblings,  are citizens  and  residents of the
United States. (TR at page  31 lines 7~10, and GX 1 at pages 22~28.)
1.b.   Applicant  maintains  a  bank  account  in  Iraq,  with  an  approximate  value  of
$2,000.  This  bank  account  is  a  matter  of  necessity,  as  there  is  a  10%  surcharge  to
withdraw funds from a U.S. bank account in Iraq.  (TR at page 25 line 18 to page 28 line
2, at page 34 lines 21~25, at page 53 line 4 to page 54 line 3.) The Applicant’s witness,
a former FBI Agent and her UN supervisor, further explained the necessity to maintain
an Iraqi bank account for those unable to leave Iraq on occasion and bank outside the
country. (TR at page 20 line 13 to page 22 line 18.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
2.a.  Applicant  denies  that  she  is  indebted  to  Creditor  A  in  the  amount  of  about
$1,344.  This  debt  has  been  settled  and  paid  as  evidenced  by  Applicant’s
documentation. (TR at page 32 lines 11~17, at page 32 line 25 to page 33 line 11, and
AppX E.)
2.b.  Applicant  denies  that  she  is  indebted  to  Creditor  B  in  the  amount  of  about
$56. This debt has been paid in full as evidenced by Applicant’s documentation. (TR at
page 32 lines 18~24, at page 33 lines 12~18, and AppX F.)
2.c.  Applicant is making  the monthly payments of $150 towards her charged-off
car loan, which were agreed to by the creditor, as evidenced by documentation. (TR at
page 33 line 19 to page 34 line 5, and AppXs G and U.)
Notice
I take administrative notice of the following facts regarding the Republic of Iraq:
Iraq  is  a  constitutional  parliamentary  republic.  The  U.S.  Department  of  Sate  travel
advisory  for  Iraq  is  Level  4:  Do  not  trave!  During  2021,  the  primary  terrorist  threats
within  Iraq  included  ISIS  remnants  and  various  Iran-aligned  militia  groups.  Significant
human rights issues remain present in Iraq.
