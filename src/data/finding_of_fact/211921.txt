Applicant  is  a  32-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor  for  whom  he  has
worked  since  2018.  He  received  a  high  school  diploma  in  2009  and  has  taken  some
college  courses  without  earning  a  degree.  He  has  never  been  married  and  has  no
children. He served on active duty with the Army from June 2014 until April 2018, when
he earned an honorable discharge. (Items 2-5)
From  about  October  2006  through  September  2022,  Applicant  used  marijuana
with varying frequency. At all times relevant to this investigation, marijuana possession
(and therefore its use) has been illegal. Despite being required to do so, Applicant failed
to  disclose  this  illegal  drug  use  on  his  February  2022  Electronic  Questionnaires  for
Investigations Processing  (2022 e-QIP) or his  April  2020 Electronic  Questionnaires  for
Investigations  Processing  (2020  e-QIP).  He  possessed  a  security  clearance  at  certain
times  while  he  was  using  marijuana  but,  despite  being  required  to  do  so,  he  failed  to
also  disclose  on  his  2022  e-QIP  and  2020  e-QIP  that  his  use  of  marijuana  occurred
while holding a clearance.
After  Applicant  denied  marijuana  use  within seven  years of  submitting  his 2020
e-QIP,  the  DOD  authorized  investigator  who  conducted  his  August  2020  security
interview confronted him with information that he used marijuana with varying frequency
within  that  time  frame.  After  being  confronted,  he  lied  and  said  that  he  only  used
marijuana with varying frequency between 2011 and 2013. When the investigator asked
him about illegal drug use  while holding a security clearance, he also lied and told the
investigator  that he only used  “CBD  oil”  that did  not contain marijuana. He untruthfully
claimed that he did not list his illegal drug use on his 2020 e-QIP because it was longer
ago than seven years. (Items 2-5)
After failing  to  disclose  his illegal drug  use, to  include  his illegal drug  use  while
holding  a  clearance,  on  his  2022  e-QIP,  Applicant  had  another  interview  with  a  DOD
authorized  investigator  in  September  2022.  This  time,  when  the  investigator  asked
about  his  drug  use,  he  admitted  his  2006  through  2022  marijuana  use,  including  use
while he held a security clearance. When the investigator asked why he did not disclose
this information on his 2022 e-QIP, he admitted he intentionally omitted the information
because of a sense of fear. (Items 2-5)
Applicant  also  told  the  investigator  in  2022  the  truth  about  his  marijuana  usage
because  he  had  received  a  letter  in  February  2022,  asking  him  to  address
inconsistencies in his drug use reporting between his 2020 investigation and his 2022 e-
QIP.  He  therefore  did  not  voluntarily  divulge  his  illegal  drug  use  before  being
confronted.  He  also  continued  to  use  marijuana  after  receiving  this  letter.  He  claimed
that  he  told  his  supervisor  about  his  illegal  drug  use  and  intentional  falsifications.  He
also admitted to the investigator during his 2022 background interview that he made up
the story he told during his 2020 background interview, about using CBD oil, to cover for
his actual marijuana use. He clarified that he did not use marijuana while he was in the
military from 2014 to 2018, but he used it before and after those years. He claimed he
has  no  intention  of  using  marijuana  in  the  future.  He  volunteered  to  undergo  drug
testing, but there is no evidence that he has been tested. There is also no evidence that
he  has  undergone  any  drug  treatment.  He  acknowledged  using  marijuana  with  his
girlfriend and other friends and provided no evidence that he no longer associates with
these individuals, or that they no longer use marijuana. (Items 2-5)
In  August  2019,  after  a  night  out  drinking  alcohol,  Applicant  was  arrested  on
suspicion  of  misdemeanor  DUI.  He  failed  a field  sobriety  test  and,  after being  given  a
breathalyzer  test,  his  blood  alcohol  percentage  was  between  .14  and  .16  percent.  He
pleaded guilty to this DUI charge and the court suspended his driver’s license for up to
one year, required him to undergo impaired driver care management, install an ignition
interlock  device  in  his  car,  and  pay  fines  and  court  costs.  He  complied  with  his
sentencing requirements. He divulged this arrest and conviction on his 2020 e-QIP and
during the 2020 interview with a DOD authorized investigator. During that interview, he
claimed he would never drink and drive again. (Items 2-6)
In his Answer, Applicant admitted the allegations in the SOR, which were related
to  his  marijuana  use,  his  failure  to  divulge  his  marijuana  use  in  his  2020  and  2022  e-
QIPs, his lying to the DOD authorized investigator in 2020 about his marijuana use, and
his  2019  DUI  arrest  and  conviction.  His  admissions  are  incorporated  in  my  findings  of
fact.  He  provided  no  additional  narrative  or  explanation  with  his  Answer  and  did  not
respond to the FORM.
