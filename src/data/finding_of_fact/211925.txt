Applicant is a 55-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his  current  employer  since  August  2021.  He  has  a  master’s  degree  that  he  earned  in
2012 and additional education. He is married with eight children between the ages of 14
and 24. (Items 3, 9)
Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial  problems,  including  bankruptcy  filings  and
delinquent  debt.  He  filed  a  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  case  in  November  2014.  Under
Schedule  D,  Creditors  Holding  Secured  Claims,  the  petition  listed  an  auto  loan  of
$14,919 and a mortgage loan of $282,772 (the house was valued at $192,084). Under
Schedule  F,  Creditors  Holding  Unsecured  Nonpriority  Claims,  the  petition  listed
accounts  totaling  $148,434,  but  about  $80,631  of  that  amount  were  student  loans,
which  are  usually  not  dischargeable.  There  were  no  priority  unsecured  claims.  His
dischargeable debts were discharged in March 2015. (Items 2-5, 8, 9)
Notwithstanding  the  fresh  start  offered  by  the  2015  bankruptcy  discharge,
Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case in November 2018. He reported $104,000
in income for 2016; $110,000 for 2017; and $92,781 year to date for 2018. He reported
that  he  owned  three  vehicles  and a  motorcycle.  The  model years were  2014  or 2015,
and  their  total  value  was  $59,870.  Under  Schedule  D,  Creditors  Who  Have  Claims
Secured  by  Property,  the  petition  listed  a  mortgage  loan  of  $277,617  (the  house  was
valued  at  $287,000),  a  $914  loan  for  furniture,  and  four  vehicle  loans  totaling  about
$89,000.  Under  Schedule  E/F,  Creditors  Who  Have  Unsecured  Claims,  the  petition
listed $2,649 owed to the IRS for 2013; $1,450 owed in state taxes for 2018; $142,732
in student loans; and $1,990 for three credit card accounts. (Items 2-5, 7, 9)
The case was dismissed upon Applicant’s request in July 2019. Applicant made
payments into his plan totaling $9,720, of which $8,501 was disbursed, leaving a $1,218
balance  on  hand.  The  trustee  was  paid  $589,  and  his  attorney  was  paid  $4,950.  The
remainder  was  paid  to  his  secured  claims.  No  payments  were made  to  his unsecured
claims. (Items 2-5, 7, 9; AE A, A(2))
Applicant  filed  another  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  case  in  November  2019.  He
reported $110,000 in income for 2017; $101,920 for 2018; and $85,698 year to date for
2019.  He  reported  that  three  vehicles  had  been  repossessed.  He  still  owned  the
motorcycle for which he owed $19,493 and another vehicle for which he owed $14,034.
Under Schedule D, Creditors Who Have Claims Secured by Property, the petition listed
a  mortgage  loan  of  $280,146  (the  house  was  valued  at  $292,000),  a  $914  loan  for
furniture,  and  the  two  vehicle  loans  discussed  above.  Under  Schedule  E/F,  Creditors
Who  Have  Unsecured  Claims,  the  petition  listed  $2,662  owed  to  the  IRS  for  2013;
$142,962  in  student  loans;  $71,509  owed  in  deficiency  balances  for  the  three
repossessed  vehicles;  a  $5,485  medical  debt;  and  $4,301  for  five  miscellaneous
accounts. The IRS filed a claim of $2,818. (Items 2-6, 9; AE A(1))
The case was dismissed upon Applicant’s request in August 2021. He moved to
another state and would have had to retain another attorney to refile it in his new state.
He submitted a report from January 2020 that was apparently prepared by the trustee.
The  monthly  payments  into  the  plan  were  $882.  The  report indicated  that  $4,950  was
paid  to  his attorney and  $310  was paid to  the  trustee.  No payments  were  recorded  to
the claimants. Another document shows that he made payments totaling about $16,000
into  the  plan  while  the  case  was  open.  A  final  accounting  was  not  submitted,  so  what
creditors were paid cannot be ascertained. (Items 2, 6; AE A, A(1), A(3))
The  SOR  alleges  the  three  bankruptcy  cases  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.c),  deficiency
balances on two auto loans for repossessed vehicles (SOR ¶¶ 1.d - $13,991 and 1.e -
$34,780), and $1,202 owed on a charged-off credit card account (SOR ¶ 1.f). Applicant
admitted owing the debts. They are also listed on credit reports and named as creditors
in the 2019 bankruptcy petition. (Items 2, 4-6)
Applicant  attributed  his  financial  problems  to  being  the  sole  provider in  a  family
with eight children. He also noted a significant drop in income in 2013, unemployment,
and health issues. He bought three vehicles for his children to use, then was unable to
pay for them, and they were repossessed. (Items 2, 3, 9; AE A)
Applicant resolved some debts from the bankruptcies, but he has not paid any of
the three debts alleged in the SOR. The loan for his motorcycle was “paid in settlement”
for less than the full balance in February 2022. He settled a $636 debt for $500 In May
2023,  which  he  completed  through  two  $250  payments.  In  addition  to  the  financial
counseling  courses  required  for  his  bankruptcies,  he  has  taken  classes  from  a  noted
financial  expert.  His  plan  is  to  use  that  expert’s  strategy  of  paying  the  smallest  debts
first, and then moving on to the next one. He stated  that he was working on a plan  to
pay the $1,202 charged-off credit card debt (SOR ¶ 1.f). (Items 4, 5; AE A, A(4)-A(7))
Applicant  reported   his   financial  issues  on   a  Questionnaire   for  National   Security
Positions (SF  86)  that  he  submitted  in August 2022, and  he  discussed  them  during  his
background  interview in  October 2022. He  reported  on  the  SF 8  6 that he went on  a  one-
to-five-day   Caribbean   cruise   in  January  2020.  His  most  recent  credit  report  indicates
that he  owes more than  $250,000  in student loans, and  it is unclear whether he  paid the
back taxes that  were  reported in  his bankruptcy  petitions.  (Items  2, 4, 5,  9)
