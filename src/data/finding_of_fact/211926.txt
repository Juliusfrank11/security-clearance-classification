Applicant admitted some of the SOR allegations (¶¶ 1.b-1.c, 1.e-1.g, and 1.j) and
denied others (¶¶ 1.a, 1.d, and 1.h-1.i). His admissions are adopted as findings of fact.
After  a  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  evidence,  I  make  the  following  additional
findings of fact.
Applicant  is  61  years  old.  He  has  worked  for  his  current  employer,  a  defense
contractor,  since  August  2021,  as  a  senior  solution  specialist.  He  has  worked
continuously  since  2009,  except  for  two  periods  of  unemployment  in  November  2013
and from January 2015 to February 2015. He holds a bachelor’s degree. He married for
third time in 2014. He has two adult children. (Item 3).
The SOR alleged Applicant failed to timely file his 2021 federal income tax return.
It also alleged that he owed delinquent federal taxes for tax years 2014-2016 and 2019
totaling $82,868 and he owed delinquent state taxes for tax year 2014, in the amount of
$90,000.  (¶¶  1.a-1.c).  The  SOR  also  alleged  Applicant  incurred  seven  delinquent
consumer debts totaling approximately $1,290. (¶¶ 1.d-1.j)
Tax Issues.
Applicant’s  explanation  for  his  tax  difficulties  was  that  in  2014  his  son  was
diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, which caused him to be unable to pay his federal and
state  taxes.  He  also  stated  periods  of  unemployment  contributed  to  his  financial
distress. (Item 2)
The  record  contains  conflicting  information  concerning  the  filing  of  Applicant’s
2021  federal  income  tax  return.  In  his  SOR  answer,  Applicant  denied  that  his  2021
federal return was not filed. He requested from the IRS a tax account transcript for tax
year 2021 on October 21, 2022. That tax account transcript indicated that as of August
23,  2021,  no  tax  return  had  been  filed  by  Applicant.  (Item  4)  In  his  response  to  the
FORM, Applicant submitted an IRS tax return transcript for tax year 2021. His request
for this transcript was made on August 30, 2023. This transcript indicated that Applicant
filed his 2021 tax return on August 1, 2022. (AE B) The filing deadline for 2021 was April
18,  2021.  If  an  extension  request  was  filed  with  the  IRS,  the  filing  deadline  was
extended  to  October  17,  2022.  There  is  no  evidence  Applicant  filed  an  extension.
Neither transcript shows that Applicant owed taxes for 2021. (Item 4; AE B)
Applicant  admitted  owing  taxes  to  the  federal  government  in  the  amount  of
approximately $82,868 for tax years 2014-2016 and 2019. An IRS account transcript for
tax year 2014 indicated that Applicant owed approximately $50,690. (Item 4) During his
April 2022 background interview, he told an investigator that he set up a payment plan
with  the  IRS  to  pay  $1,500  monthly  toward  his  delinquent  federal  taxes.  He  also  said
that he was two months behind on those payments. In his security clearance application
(SCA), he stated that he resumed making his monthly payments to the IRS in October
2021,  without providing  corroborating documentation.  He did not provide a copy of his
payment  plan  with  the  IRS.  He  provided  a  copy  of  an  IRS  payment  due  notice  dated
September 6, 2023, showing that his $1,500 monthly payment was due on September
18,  2023.  The  notice  also  showed
total  amount  owed  was
approximately  $198,800  (any  amount  owed  that  exceeds  the  amount  alleged  in  the
SOR will not be considered by me for disqualification purposes, but I may consider it for
mitigation  and  during  my  whole-person  analysis).  There  is  no  documentation  showing
that Applicant made this monthly payment. (Items 2-4; AE C)
that  Applicant’s
Applicant admitted in his SCA and his SOR answer that he owed $90,000 to his
state tax authority for his 2014 taxes. Aside, from this admission, he did not provide any
further  information  on  the  status  of  this  tax  debt.  The  Government  presented
documentary evidence showing his state filed a lien against him in 2017 for unpaid state
taxes  in the amount  of  approximately $24,000.  There  is no  evidence  showing  this  lien
was released or that these taxes were paid. (Items 1-2; 5)
Applicant presented documentation showing that the alleged delinquent debts in
¶¶ 1.e-1.j were either paid or the accounts are now in good standing. While, the record
does  not  contain  information  on  whether  ¶  1.d  was  paid,  its  small  alleged  balance  of
$52 makes it insignificant as a security concern. These debts have been resolved. (AE
