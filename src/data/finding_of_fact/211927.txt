Applicant  is  a  38-year-old  process  engineer  with  a  defense  contractor.  He  has
worked for them since November 2019. He is married, but has been separated from his
wife for nine or ten years. He has one child with his wife. He has received a bachelor of
science degree. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his work
with the DoD. This is his first application for a security clearance. (Government Exhibit 1
at Sections 12, 13A, 17, and 18.)
Paragraph 1  (Guideline H –  Drug Involvement  and Substance Misuse)
The  Government  alleges  in  this  paragraph  that  Applicant  is  ineligible  for
clearance  because  he  has  used  illegal  drugs.  Applicant  admitted  all  five  allegations
under this paragraph with explanations.
1.a.   Applicant  started  using  marijuana  in  approximately  January  2003.  From
2003  through  2010  his  use  was  daily.  From  approximately  2010  to  April  2019  his  use
was  weekly.  From  April  to  November  2019  Applicant’s  use  was  daily.  As  stated,
Applicant began working for his present employer in November 2019. From November
2019 through 2021 his use was weekly. His use was sporadic after that.  (Government
Exhibit 2 at 14.)
Applicant has given various dates for his last use of marijuana. In his March 17,
2022 e-QIP, Government Exhibit 1 at Section 23, he stated his last use was in January
2022. During a May 23, 2022 interview with a government investigator Applicant stated
that he  had  last used marijuana  earlier  in  May  2022.  (Government Exhibit  2 at  14.)  In
his responses to DOHA interrogatories he stated his marijuana use had ended in March
2022. (Government Exhibit 2 at 20.) His testimony was very vague about the extent of
his marijuana use. He was very unsure about when it ended, stating it was possibly late
2021 or early 2022. (Tr. 25-28, 36-39.)
Applicant’s  basic  explanation  for  continuing  to  use  marijuana  after  being
employed by a defense contractor was that he did not know that he could not use it. He
also  testified  that  he  did  not  intend  to  use  illegal  drugs  in  the  future.  (Government
Exhibit 2 at 14-15; Tr. 27-28, 36.)
1.b.  The  evidence  shows  that  Applicant  used  hallucinogenic  mushrooms  from
approximately  2005  through  January  2021.  He  has  made  several  contradictory
statements about his mushroom use. In his Answer he stated, “This [end] date [January
2021] was approximated. More likely it had not been during employment.” In his March
17,  2022  e-QIP,  Government  Exhibit  1  at  Section  23,  he  stated  his  last  use  was  in
January 2021 and that he had used it 2 to 3 times a year before that. During a May 23,
2022  interview  with  a  government  investigator  Applicant  stated  that  he  had  last  used
mushrooms in January 2021. (Government Exhibit 2 at 14.) In his responses to DOHA
interrogatories  he  stated  that  his  mushroom  use  was  from  2006  to  January  2021.
(Government  Exhibit  2  at  20.)  His  testimony  was  very  vague  about  the  extent  of  his
mushroom  use.  He  was  very  unsure  about  when  it  ended,  stating  it  was  possibly  late
2019, but could also be 2021. (Tr. 28-31.)
1.c.  Applicant  admitted  using  cocaine  one  time  in  approximately  August  2019.
This  was  before  he  started  his  current  employment.  (Government  Exhibit  1  at  Section
23, Exhibit 2 at 11-12, 20; Tr. 31-33.)
1.d. Applicant admitted using LSD one time in approximately August 2019. This
was  before  he  started  his  current  employment.  (Government  Exhibit  1  at  Section  23,
Exhibit 2 at 11-12, 20; Tr. 31-33.)
1.e. Applicant admitted that he had been charged with Possession of Cannabis in
approximately July 2009. The case  resulted in his paying a fine  and  serving probation
for  a  period  of  time.  He  continued  to  use  marijuana  for  more  than  ten  years  after  this
arrest. (Government Exhibit 2 at 9-10; Tr. 33-35.)
Paragraph 2  (Guideline E  –  Personal Conduct)
The  Government  alleges  in  this  paragraph  that  Applicant  is  ineligible  for
judgment,
that  shows  poor
in  conduct
clearance  because  he  has  engaged
untrustworthiness or unreliability.
2.a. The  Government alleges in  this subparagraph  that the  Applicant’s drug  use
history,  as  set  forth  under  Paragraph  1,  above,  is  also  cognizable  under  Guideline  E.
Applicant did not admit or deny this allegation. His silence is viewed as a denial.
2.b.  Applicant  admitted  this  allegation,  which  concerns  his  wife’s  immigration
status, with an explanation.
Applicant’s  wife  is from  the  Philippines, but has  lived  in the  United States since
approximately  2001-2002.  They  were  married  in  2008,  and  informally  separated  in
2013. She lives in a different state from him. He is unsure of her immigration status, but
does  not  believe  she  is  a  citizen  of  the  United  States.  The  couple  have  no  plans  to
divorce. (Government Exhibit 2 at 22-23.)
The SOR states that Applicant has remained married to his spouse to assist her
in  qualifying  for  U.S.  citizenship  through  the  naturalization  process.  In  his  Answer  he
stated,  “We  remain  married.  No  reason  not  to  be.  Not  for  sole  purpose  of  citizenship.
Also  co-parenting  child  and  family ties.  No rule  says I have to divorce  someone I  was
with 10 years.”
Applicant  testified  that  he  does  not  know  his  wife’s  current  immigration  status.
The  most  he  would  say  is  that  she  might  “technically  be  considered  in  the  country
illegally.”  Once  again,  his  testimony  was  very  vague  as  to  his  wife’s  citizenship  status
and despite questioning by Department Counsel and myself did not clarify it. (Tr. 15-25.)
It is noted that neither side presented any direct evidence as to Applicant’s wife’s
current  immigration  status.  In  addition,  no  evidence  was  presented  by  either  side
indicating  why  Applicant  and  his  wife  remaining  married  during  the  pendency  of  any
naturalization issue would be legally significant.
