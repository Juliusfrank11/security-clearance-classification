Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 3.b-3.c, and 3.e-3.f, and he denied SOR ¶¶ 2.a,

(Answer; Tr. at 7, 10-11, 37; GE 1)
Applicant served in the U.S. military on active duty from 2008 to 2012, and then in
the  Reserve  until  early  2021.  He  received  a  general  discharge  under  honorable
conditions, as further discussed below. As of the date of the hearing, he had worked for
his  current  employer,  a  DOD  contractor,  since  2017.  He  was  first  granted  a  security
clearance in 2008. He has owned his home since 2016. (Answer; Tr. at 5, 7-9, 33-37; GE
1)
In June 2019, Applicant was arrested and charged with the following five felony
offenses: larceny of checks; forgery; uttering; obtain money by false pretense; and identity
theft. He deposited a $5,000 check that he received at his home, but was not made out
to him, into one of his bank accounts. He did not spend the money, and it was recouped.
He  pled  guilty  to  larceny  of  checks  and  identity  theft  in  November  2019,  and  he  was
sentenced  to  five  years  in  jail,  suspended,  and  one  year  of  probation.  The  remaining
charges were nolle prosequi. He was consequently administratively separated from the
Reserve in early 2021, with a general discharge under honorable conditions by reason of
misconduct - commission of a serious offense. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 2.a; Answer; Tr. at 17-18,
30-31, 33-35, 38-49, 61-66; GE 1-2)
This is Applicant’s sole  criminal offense.  He completed  probation  without  issue. As
of the  date  of the  hearing, he  was three  years  into  his five-year deferred  sentence, which
he  expected  to  complete  in February 2025.  He disclosed  this information  on  his March
2021  security clearance  application. (SOR  ¶¶  1.a, 2.a;  Answer;  Tr. at 17-18,  30-31,  33-
35, 38-49, 61-66; GE  1-2)
Applicant stated that he acted rashly, and he could not provide a good explanation
for  his  actions  as  he  was  not  experiencing  financial  troubles  at  the  time.  He  was
remorseful, candid, and took responsibility for his poor judgment. He described it as “the
worst lapse of character that I’ve ever had in my life. If, the only time where I’ve actually
done something like this.” He stated, “I almost ruined my marriage of, at that time, eight
years.” He went to counseling, where he learned to slow down his thought process and
be more deliberate in his actions. He stated, “I’m trying to not let that define me, and also
trying not to let that be the end all. It ruined my [military] career . . . .” He endeavored to
be a positive role model for his children and the children for whom he serves as a sports
coach. (Answer; Tr. at 17, 30-31, 38-49, 61-66)
The SOR also alleged that Applicant had five delinquent consumer debts, totaling
$10,292 (SOR ¶¶ 3.b-3.f), and a $151 delinquent medical debt (SOR ¶ 3.a). Applicant’s
delinquent  debts  are  established  by  his  admissions  in  his  Answer;  his  March  2021
security clearance application (SCA); and credit reports from July 2021, February 2022,
August 2022, and May 2023. All of the SOR debts are reported on the July 2021 credit
bureau report. SOR ¶¶ 3.a-3.e are reported on the February 2022 credit bureau report.
Only  SOR  ¶  3.d  is  reported  on  the  August  2022  and  May  2023  credit  bureau  reports.
(Answer; Tr. at 17-18, 31; GE 1, 3-6)
Applicant  stated  that  SOR  ¶¶  3.b-3.f  were  credit  cards  that  were  fraudulently
opened  in  his  name,  and  he  did  not  learn  about  them  until  he  underwent  the  security
clearance process in 2021 and the background investigator informed him about them. He
stated  that  he  has  a  common  name  and  “my  information  has  been  in  so  many  data
breaches.”  He  initially  disputed  these  debts  directly  with  the  creditors  and  with  Credit
Karma, but then he elected to pay them because he had the financial means to do so,
and  the dispute  process  took  too  long.  He stated  that  he  was  communicating  with  the
creditor for SOR ¶ 3.d and attempting to recoup the money he paid to resolve that debt
because  he  did  not  recognize  it  as his,  as  he  has  only one  credit card  with  this same
creditor. He also stated that he has had ongoing issues with not receiving medical bills
related to one of his child’s frequent visits to various doctors for a medical condition, and
that  the  medical  debt  in  SOR  ¶  3.a  was  one  such  bill.  He  acknowledged  that  he  was
previously not the best at monitoring his credit report. (Tr. at 17-18, 31-33, 49-61)
Applicant  stated  that  he  paid  all  the  SOR  debts  prior  to  receiving  the  SOR.  He
provided documentation reflecting that the debts in SOR ¶¶ 3.a-3.c and 3.e-f are resolved
as of June 2023; he resolved the debt in SOR ¶ 3.f in 2021; and he disputed the debt in
SOR ¶ 3.b in June 2023. (Tr. at 17-18, 31-33, 49-61; AE L)
Applicant stated that his finances are in order, and he does not have any delinquent
debts. He and his wife have a budget that they utilize to “account for everything that we
can as possible.” It reflects a joint monthly income of $9,368 and a monthly net remainder
of  $3,085  after  expenses,  to  include  their  monthly  mortgage  of  $1,590.  They  have
approximately $30,000 in savings. He also has a health savings account from which he
promptly pays his son’s medical bills. He regularly monitors his credit report to keep track
of any fraudulent activity. He has not received credit counseling. (Tr. at 18, 31-33, 53, 55,
60-61, 64, 66-68; AE A-B, E-F, H-J, L)
Two  family  members,  close  friends,  and  a  colleague  of  three  years,  attested  to
Applicant’s  trustworthiness,  reliability,  and  judgment.  The  former  president  of  the
organization  for  whom  Applicant  has  served  as  a  sports  coach  also  vouched  for
Applicant’s honesty and commitment. (AE C-D, G, K, L)
