Applicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his  current  employer  since  about  February  2015.  He  earned  a  high  school  diploma  in
1982 and a bachelor’s degree in 2014. With the exception of about a year-and-a-half in
1987,  Applicant  served  on  active  duty  in  the  Navy  from  1983  until  he  retired  in  2009,
earning an honorable discharge. He was married from 1994 until a divorce in 2015. He
remarried in 2015. Between him and his current wife, he has five adult children and five
grandchildren. (Tr. 20-27, 40-41; Answer; GE 1, 2, 5, 6; AE B)
In  about  May  2004,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  driving  under  the
influence  of  alcohol  (DUI)  in  State  A  after drinking  at  a  friend’s  house  and  deciding  to
drive  home.  He  was  arrested  at  about  3:00  a.m.  after  police  pulled  him  over  for
speeding. He was convicted of DUI. He was sentenced to 30 days in jail, which were all
suspended. His driver’s license was suspended for a year. He claimed that, at that time,
he  associated  with  a  group  of  sailors  who  drank  a  lot  and  enjoyed  going  to  bars  and
clubs.  He  claimed  that  he  no  longer  associates  with  that  group  of  people.  He  was
required  to  attend  State  A’s  alcohol  safety  action  program  (ASAP).  He  reported  this
arrest on his 2021 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (2021 SF 86)
and on his 2015 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (2015 SF 86).
He  also  claimed  that he  immediately  reported  the  DUI  to  his  chain  of  command.  After
being  arrested,  he  claimed  that  he  modified  his  drinking  behavior  for  an  unspecified
period of time. (Tr. 27-29, 41-46; Answer; GE 2, 3)
Applicant   was  arrested   in  July   2009   in  State   A   and   charged   with  DUI,  second
offense, BAC   0.15   and   0.20%,  after police  pulled  him   over for speeding   at about 2:00
a.m.  He had too  much  to drink after going to several bars over the course of an evening,
yet he  decided  to drive  home.  Police  administered  him  a  breathalyzer test  and  the  result
indicated that he  had a  0.17  percent  blood  alcohol  content (BAC).  He  pleaded  guilty to  a
lesser  DUI  offense   and   served   10   days   in  jail.   He  was  placed   on   probation   until 2013
and   his  license   was   suspended   for  a   year.   His  command   gave   him   a   Captain’s   Mast
and  the  Navy out-processed  him  but  allowed  him  to  take  full  retirement based  upon  his
past military record.  (Tr. 29-31, 49-62, 75-76;  Answer;  GE  1-6)
Applicant reported this arrest on his 2021 SF 86 and on his 2015 SF 86. He was
once  again  required  to  complete  State  A’s  ASAP  program.  He  also  attended  and
completed an outpatient substance abuse program from September 2009 until January
2010 and attended Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings intermittently from September
2009  until  September  2012.  While  he  claimed  that  he  was  never  told  to  abstain  from
alcohol,  he  did  abstain  from  it  from  2009  until  2014.  He  also  claimed  that  he  stopped
associating with the same crowd with whom he drank alcohol. (Tr. 29-31, 49-62, 75-76;
Answer; GE 1-6; AE C)
In  about 2014, Applicant began  consuming  alcohol again.  He claimed  he  would
have  a  drink or two  at lunch  or  dinner. He  claimed  he  drank  about  six  to  eight beers per
month.   During   an   August  2015   interview  with   a   DOD  investigator,  Applicant  told  the
investigator that he  had  modified  his drinking  habits  by no  longer drinking  to  the  point of
intoxication,  and  he  no  longer associated  with  the  same  crowd  who  liked  to  go  out and
party.   He   also   told  the   investigator  that   he   did   not   foresee   having   additional  DUIs.
However,  in  June  2021, he  was arrested  in State  B  and  charged  with  DUI,  .16  (percent)
or higher.  Earlier that night,  after working  late,  he  had  about five  drinks over three-and-
a-half hours with  dinner. Afterwards,  he  drove  to  a  karaoke  bar and  drank  more  there.
Despite  drinking  too  much, he  left  the  karaoke  bar at about 3:30  a.m. to  drive  home, but
police  pulled  him  over  for  driving  erratically,  speeding,  and  failing  to  use  his  turn  signal.
He failed  a  field sobriety test  and  was given  a  breathalyzer. His breathalyzer test result
indicated  that he  had  a  0.16  percent  BAC. The  DUI charges  were  ultimately dismissed
for  an   alleged   lack  of   evidence,   but  he   pleaded   guilty  to   a   lesser  charge   of   careless
driving.  He was required  to  pay a $400 fine.  (Tr. 32-35, 61-65;  Answer;  GE  3-6)
Applicant  claimed  that  after  his  June  2021  arrest,  he  had  a  “reset,”  but  he  still
consumes  alcohol  and  has  a  drink  or  two  with  dinner.  He  testified  that  he  still  drives
after consuming alcohol,  but he does not drive  if he has had more than  one drink.  He
claimed that  if he  has had more  than  one drink,  his wife  drives  home from dinner.  He
testified that he has not driven while intoxicated since June 2021 and that was the only
time  he  did  so  in  the  last  10  years.  He  claimed  that  his  social  circle  now  consists  of
mostly  extended  family  who  are  not  big  drinkers  or bargoers.  He  also  claimed  that  he
drinks  less  because  he  has  health  issues  that  are  exacerbated  by  drinking  too  much
alcohol, he wants to keep his job, and he wants to have a healthy retirement. (Tr. 32-36,
38-40, 66-69; Answer; GE 6)
Applicant  claimed  he  has  not  been  diagnosed  as  alcohol  dependent  or  as  an
alcoholic.  Applicant  claimed  that  no  alcohol  counselor  or  medical  professional  has
advised him to stop drinking. On October 24, 2023, Applicant had a consultation with a
counselor  who  holds  a  master’s  degree  in  counseling  education  and  is  a  licensed
professional  counselor.  After  this  consultation,  the  counselor  diagnosed  Applicant  with
Alcohol Use, Mild, in sustained remission. He then underwent at least one other session
with the same counselor. The counselor made no recommendation regarding Applicant
abstaining from alcohol. (Tr. 31, 75-76; AE C)
While  he  was  in  the  Navy,  Applicant  earned  the  Meritorious  Service  Award,
which he claimed is not normally awarded to an enlisted servicemember. He deployed
to a combat zone for about ten months beginning in October 2007. He retired from the
Navy  as  an  E-8,  which  is  the  second  highest  enlisted  pay  grade  available.  He  has
received  praise  from  his  supervisors  and  customers  regarding  his  work  performance.
His  colleagues,  friends,  and  family  have  written  character-reference  letters  advocating
that  he  be  awarded  a  security  clearance  and  attesting  to  his  good  character,
trustworthiness, reliability, and patriotism. His spouse also wrote that she does not think
he has a problem with alcohol and that he is merely a social drinker. In contravention of
Applicant’s  testimony,  she  claimed  that  he  does  not  drive  after  he  has  been  drinking.
