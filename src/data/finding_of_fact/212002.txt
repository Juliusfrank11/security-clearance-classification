In  Applicant’s  SOR  response,  he  admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations.  He  also
provided mitigating information. (Id.) His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.
Applicant  is   a  54-year-old   systems  engineer   who   has  worked   for  his  current
employer  for the  previous year.  (Tr. 18-19; GE  1)  In  2002, he  received  a  bachelor’s degree
in information  systems. (AE  J at 170) In  2013, he first received  a  security clearance. (Tr.
19) His first marriage  was from  2000  to  2004, and  his second  marriage  was  from  2005  to
2012. (Tr. 20, 53) His third  marriage  was in 2014. (Tr. 20) His current spouse  works for
an   international organization.   (Tr.  21)  His  son   was   born  in   1999,   and   his  stepson   was
born  in  2004.  (Tr.  20-21)   His  resume   includes  additional  information   about  his
professional training  and experience. (AE J at 168)
Financial Considerations
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in around June 2002.
This  bankruptcy  was  discharged  in  around  February  2003.  (AE  B)  Applicant  filed  for
bankruptcy after his first wife lost her job. (Tr. 38, 40) His first spouse was unfaithful; she
had health problems; and he divorced her in 2004. (Tr. 26-27, 40) This bankruptcy initially
was a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, and he made about six payments before he converted it to
a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. (Tr. 75; AE B) He estimated that about $25,000 was discharged
in the 2003 bankruptcy. (Tr. 75)
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in around July 2007.
Applicant said he was unable to make the monthly payments, and he elected to convert
the Chapter 13 bankruptcy to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy around January 2009. (Tr. 39) The
bankruptcy  documentation  lists  five  secured  debts  totaling  about  $521,000,  which
includes four vehicle loans and a real estate loan for about $442,000. (AE C at 15-16) He
had 10 unsecured nonpriority debts totaling about $3,800. (AE C at 18-20) The Chapter
7 discharge was denied in around July 2009.
Before  the   2007   bankruptcy  was  filed,  Applicant  was  employed   in   information
technology (IT) and  making  about $60,000  annually. (Tr. 24) The  dot com crash resulted
in  the   loss  of  employment  to   thousands  of  IT  workers,  including   Applicant.   (Tr.  24-25)
Applicant was unemployed  for six months. (Tr. 25) He purchased  a  home  in 2007, and
the  real estate  market collapsed. (Tr. 42)  His second  spouse’s annual income  was about
$40,000. (Tr. 43) His wife  was in a  vehicle  accident, and  she  suffered  a  concussion. (Tr.
44) After the  accident,  she was unable to work outside their home. (Tr. 44) At the time  of
her accident, his annual income  was  about $80,000. (Tr. 45)
Applicant elected to file for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy initially in order to stop the
foreclosure of his residence. (Tr. 27-28, 49) He believed filing for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy
would  assist  in  completion  of  a  rehabilitation  plan  on  their  mortgage.  (Tr.  50)  The
mortgage payment was not included in the Chapter 13 payment, and they were unable to
afford  the  mortgage  and  Chapter  13  payments.  (Tr.  51)  He  could  not  remember  the
amount of his Chapter 13 monthly payments. (Tr. 79) Applicant believes the conversion
to a Chapter 7 discharge may have been unsuccessful in discharging his debts because
it was too soon after the previous Chapter 7 discharge in 2003. Eight years is the current
waiting  period  between  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  discharges.  See  U.S.  Courts  website,
Discharge  in  Bankruptcy  - Bankruptcy  Basics,  https://www.uscourts.gov/services-
forms/bankruptcy/bankruptcy-basics/discharge-bankruptcy-bankruptcy-
basics#:~:text=Can%20a%20debtor%20receive%20a,the%20second%20petition%20is
%20filed. (HE 4)
Applicant’s mortgage lender paid Applicant $10,000 to leave his residence in good
condition  and  the  lender  received  the  property  without  having  to  go  through  the
foreclosure  process.  (Tr.  46,  48)  The  $10,000  payment  may  have  occurred  after  the
bankruptcy  was  dismissed.  (Tr.  80)  He  used  the  $10,000  to  pay  some  debts.  (Tr.  52)
Applicant and his spouse moved in with her parents for six months. (Tr. 49) His spouse
shared the $20,000 settlement from her vehicle accident with her siblings and parents,
and it was not used to address their debts. (Tr. 53, 77) Applicant’s divorce from his second
wife was final in 2012, and at that time, his annual income was about $90,000. (Tr. 54)
In  2014,  Applicant  married  for  the  third  time.  (Tr.  57)  In  March  2017,  they
purchased a home. (Tr. 59) The monthly mortgage payment was about $3,400. (Tr. 60)
In May 2017, his monthly income was reduced 50 percent due to the loss of one of his
employments. (Tr. 60-61) He used his savings to keep his debts current. (Tr. 65)
SOR ¶  1.a  alleges Applicant  filed  a  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  in  about June  2018.
Applicant was fired  from  his  employment in  May 2017,  and  his spouse  was not  employed
outside  their  home. (Tr. 83-84;  GE  6  at 46) He  accumulated  debt  on  his credit  cards  while
he   looked   for  employment.   (Tr.  82-83)   He   did  not   miss   any  payments  to   his  creditors
before  he  filed  for bankruptcy.  (Tr. 62)  His credit score before he  filed  the  bankruptcy was
770. (SOR response) He missed  some  payments during  the  five-year payment plan  when
he  was  changing  employment  contracts  or  due  to  a  lack  of  communication,  and  he
provided a cashier’s check, which did not clear; however, he successfully completed the
plan, and at the time of his hearing, he was waiting for the bankruptcy judge to issue the
discharge. (Tr. 63-64, 87) He worked multiple jobs to ensure he made the payments under
his Chapter 13 plan. (Tr. 64-65)
When Applicant filed for bankruptcy in 2018, he listed 25 unsecured debts totaling
$178,000. (Tr. 81; GE 6 at 27; AE D at 65) The total claims were about $229,000. (AE D
at 32) The accounts were opened between 2010 and 2017. (Tr. 81) The largest debt was
for $97,850, and the funds were borrowed in November 2015 to start a side business. (Tr.
98-99) The Chapter 13 bankruptcy payment plan was confirmed in August 2018. (AE D
at 101) He paid about $129,000 into the bankruptcy plan over the five-year term. (AE D
at 32) On July 29, 2020, Applicant’s mortgage had a balance of about $410,000, and an
estimated market value of about $583,000. (GE 6 at 10, 16; GE 9) The mortgage was not
included in the Chapter 13 bankruptcy. (GE 9)
On  April  16,  2021,  the  bankruptcy  trustee  moved  to  dismiss  the  Chapter  13
bankruptcy because he incurred a $9,000 post-petition federal income tax liability. (Tr.
87; GE 8) He was unsure about the tax year (TY) which caused the liability, or what the
result was for his bankruptcy; however, it was not dismissed. (Tr. 88) Applicant said he
owes about $10,000 in federal income taxes for TY 2022. (Tr. 88-89) His spouse is paid
quarterly  by  an  international  organization,  and  he  believed  that  organization  was
responsible  for paying her federal income  taxes.  (Tr. 89-90) He  said  that  his spouse’s
employer owed her for several years of federal income tax debt. (Tr. 89-90) He promised
to pay any tax debt not paid by her employer. (Tr. 89) He estimated his and his spouse’s
total federal income tax debt is $20,000. (Tr. 90) He did not plan to start an IRS payment
plan until the Chapter 13 bankruptcy is completed. (Tr. 91, 95) He provided his tax returns
for TYs 2018 to 2022, which are summarized in the following table. (AE N-AE R) Applicant
could have made some payments when he filed his tax returns, and the number shown
in the table for taxes owed is not necessarily the amount owed at this time.

On March 8, 2022, the bankruptcy trustee filed a motion to dismiss his Chapter 13
bankruptcy because he was behind in his payments by about $7,000. (Tr. 91; GE 8) He
was unsure of the basis of another 2022 motion the trustee filed to dismiss his bankruptcy.
(Tr. 92-93; GE 8)
When   Applicant  initially  filed   his  2018   bankruptcy,   his   and   his  spouse’s  annual
income was about $103,500, and his monthly disposable income was about $1,700. (AE
D  at   85,  86)  For  2016,  they   earned   about   $197,000;  for  2017,   they  earned   about
$129,000; and  for the  first six months of 2017, they earned  about $47,000. (AE  D at 74)
He  said  he   told   the   bankruptcy  trustee   on   an   annual  basis  about   the   increases  in  his
income. (Tr. 98) His monthly  payments to  the  trustee  started  at  $1,220  and  increased  to
$3,700   over   the   five-year  term   of   the   bankruptcy.   (Tr.  93,  98)  His  personal  financial
statement indicates his monthly salary  from  three  jobs   is currently $28,634. (Tr. 69-74;
AE E) He is available to work or on call for IT problems about 115 hours a week. (Tr. 74,
94) However, he  does  not actually work that  many hours. (Tr. 94) His spouse’s current
monthly income is about $5,600. (Tr. 74)
Applicant’s  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  was  completed  in  June  2023.  (Tr.  96)  He
believed the creditors were paid 70 percent of their claims. (Tr. 97) On August 10, 2023,
the trustee certified completion of the payment plan. (AE M)
Applicant received credit counseling in connection with his bankruptcies in 2007
and 2018. (AE C at 13; AE D at 42)
Character Evidence
A friend of Applicant’s current wife, his supervisor at one of his employments, and
his friend made verbal statements on Applicant’s behalf at his hearing, and he provided
three written statements from coworkers or friends. (Tr. 29-37, 101-115; AE K at 172-174)
The  general  sense  of  their  statements  is  that  Applicant  is  prudent  with  his  spending,
mature, honest, and trustworthy.
