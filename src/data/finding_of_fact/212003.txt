The  SOR  alleges  under  paragraph  1.a  that  Applicant  used  marijuana  at
different  frequencies  from  2002  to  the  present;  that  he  used  marijuana  with  a  security
clearance  since  September  2019;  that  he  tested  positive  for  marijuana  metabolites  in
2005 and 2008; and, that he was arrested in 2010 having marijuana in his possession,
and in 2012 by  violating the terms of his 2010 probation because he had marijuana in
his possession.
The  second  paragraph  of  the  SOR  alleges  personal  conduct  by  incorporating
the  information  alleged  under  SOR  ¶  1.  The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  committed
sexual acts on a minor in 2005, and made a false statement, in violation of four Articles
of  the  Uniform  Code  of  Military  Justice  (UCMJ).  He  also  falsified  information  in  three
locations on his September 2019 e-QIP. The Applicant admitted all allegations listed in
the SOR, without explanations.
Applicant is 39 years old and has been divorced since February 2015. He has a
son from his former wife. His current girlfriend gave birth to a two-year-old daughter in
2021.  He  received  a  security  clearance  in  2019  when  he  began  working  for  his  then
employer.  From  June  2002  to  November  2002,  he  served  in  the  United  States  (U.S.)
Army on active duty. From November 2002 to September 2004, he served in the Army
Reserve,  and  received  an  honorable  discharge.  He  returned  to  active  duty  in  the  U.S
Army from September 2004 to December 2009, when he received a general discharge
under  honorable  conditions  for  drug-related  conduct  and  positive  drug  tests.  He  has
been  living  in  Country  B  since  2014.  Applicant  seeks  security  clearance  eligibility.  In
August  2018,  he  began  working  as  a  senior  logistic  specialist,  and  was  recently
promoted to a senior analyst of stock control. (GE 1 at 9-28; GE 2 at 7; Tr. 7-8, 35, 38-
39, 40)
SOR ¶ 1.a –  Applicant testified that he has been using marijuana from 2002 to
the present. Since 2012 or 2013, he has been using marijuana to relax his urethra when
he urinates. In 2022, he began obtaining the marijuana by prescription because Country
B legalized marijuana use. Before the drug was legalized, he obtained the drug illegally
from  family  and  friends.  In  his  March  2021  PSI,  he  indicated  he  was  paying  between
$250 and $300 a month or every other month for the drug. He noted that the purchase
and  use  of  marijuana  was  legal  in  Country  B.  Applicant’s  last  drug  treatment  or
counseling  was  in  2022,  when  a  doctor,  featuring  alternative  treatment  methods,
provided him with a prescription for marijuana. (GE 2 at 7; Tr. 20, 23, 43, 45, 47)
Applicant’s  girlfriend  uses  marijuana  occasionally.  His  longest  period  of
abstinence  was  in  2007  for  four  and  one-half  months  while  in  the  U.S.  Army.  He  has
never violated the laws of Country B. (Tr. 56-58)
SOR ¶ 1.b –  Applicant used marijuana after he was granted an interim security
clearance on September 26, 2019,  which was  removed  when he  received the SOR  in
April 2022. From 2015 through 2018, Applicant believed he had a public trust position.
(GE 8 at 1; 34-37)
In  his  March  2021  PSI,  Applicant  stated  that  he  intended  to  stop  using
marijuana  before  his  daughter  was  born  in  June  2021.  He  did  not  want  his  marijuana
use to impair his chances of promotion. (GE 2 at 8) He changed his mind because of his
ongoing  urethra  problem  causing  difficulty  urinating.  He  uses  marijuana  weekly  or
whenever he  needs the  drug.  He does not drive  a  car within  three hours of marijuana
use. He testified that he has not driven to work for two or three years since he has been
in  treatment  for  post  traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD)  from  nerve  damage  in  his
scrotum since surgery in 2006. (Tr. 43-47)
SOR  ¶¶  1.c  –  Applicant  tested  positive  for  marijuana  metabolites  on  a  U.S.
Army  urinalysis,  conducted  on  March  16,  2005.  Following  a  field  grade  Article  15,  he
was  found  guilty  by  his  command  of  wrongful  possession  and  use  of  a  controlled
substance in violation of the UCMJ, reduced in rank, assigned to 45 extra days of duty,
and 45 days restriction.
Applicant believed that the 2005 positive drug test, and subsequent Article 15,
were caused by fellow service member rolling hash-laced cigars that Applicant smoked
daily  for  three  or  four  months.  He  was  not  used  to  the  hash  smell,  but  he  determined
that  the  smoke  produced  was  not  ordinary  cigar  smoke.  He  recalled  relaxing  after  he
smoked the hash. (GE 2 at 6-7; Tr.22)
On April 6, 2005, Applicant tested positive for marijuana metabolites. (GE 4 at
2;  Tr.  48)  This  urinalysis  is  not  alleged  in  the  SOR,  and  cannot  be  used  for
disqualification purposes, but will be evaluated in the whole-person review of this case.
(Tr. 22)
SOR  ¶  1.d  –   On  August  27,  2008,  Applicant  tested  positive  for  marijuana
metabolites.  After  field  grade  Article  15,  he  was  found  guilty.  The  conditions  of  his
Article 15 punishment were the same as those identified in SOR ¶ 1.c. He believed the
positive drug test was caused by the hemp tea he was using to relax his urethra, but he
provided  no  evidence  to  support  his  claim.  He  received  a  general  discharge  from  the
U.S. Army in December 2009 for his drug use. He subsequently received an upgraded
honorable discharge. (GE 2 at 7; Tr. 52-54)
SOR 1.e –  Applicant was arrested with possession of marijuana in September
2010.  The  police  came  to  his  residence  and  smelled  marijuana.  He  was  found  guilty,
fined, and placed on a period of at least two years of probation. (GE 2 at 7; Tr. 54)
SOR  ¶  1.f  –  In  March  2012,  Applicant  was  driving  with  his  brother  to  another
location to celebrate the return of a friend from overseas when he was stopped by the
police for a traffic infraction. The police found marijuana in the car. Applicant’s claim that
he  was  not  driving  is  refuted  by  documentation  that  indicates  he  was  driving  on  a
suspended or revoked license. (GE 3 at 8) He was charged with violating his probation
imposed  in the  SOR  ¶ 1.e sentence.  For the probation  violation, he  was  sentenced  to
two  weeks  in  jail,  a fine  of  $1,776, and  an unidentified  number of hours  of  community
service. (GE 2 at 7)
SOR  ¶  2.b  –   in  December  2005,  Applicant  was  driving  three  other  service
members to a pool party. The same four individuals left the party with a 16-year-victim
that Applicant assumed was 18 or older. One of the occupants in the car agreed to take
the victim home if she performed fellatio on all four occupants. (Tr. 27) After the sexual
activity, they dropped her off at a gas station that had cameras in various locations. The
U.S.  Army  Criminal  Investigative  Division  (CID)  reviewed  the  videos,  and  a  month  or
two later, summoned Applicant to the CID station. Applicant was interrogated about the
incident,  and  he  initially  lied  to  protect  the  other  three  service  members  from  military
punishment  under  Article  15.  During  a  second  interrogation,  Applicant  divulged  the
complete account of sexual activity.
Applicant  was  charged  with  Forced  Sodomy,  Indecent  Acts  Upon  a  Child,  a
False  Statement, and Conspiracy,  in  violation  of  Articles  125,  134,  107,  and  81  of  the
UCMJ. Following a summary court-martial, he was found guilty of the offenses, ordered
to forfeit $1,128, and assigned to 45 days extra duty.
SOR  ¶¶  2.c  and  2.d  refer  to  Applicant’s  falsifications  of  material  facts  on  his
September 2019 e-QIP. First, in response to Section 22 (SOR ¶ 2.c), he answered that
he had never been involved in an offense involving alcohol or drugs, deliberately failing
to disclose the information set forth in SOR ¶1.e. Second, in response to Section 23 (¶
2.d),  Applicant  answered  that  he  had  not  illegally  used  drugs  in  the  past  seven  years,
deliberately failing to disclose the information set forth in SOR ¶ 1.a. He told the OPM
investigator  in  March  2021,  that  he  had  no  explanation  for  not  disclosing  the
information. (GE 2 at 7)
