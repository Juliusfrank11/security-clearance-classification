Applicant, 68, has held a security clearance since 1987. He was initially granted
access during his service in the U.S. Army. Since retiring from the military in 2000, he
has lived and worked abroad on federal contracts. He has worked on the same contract
since  May  2016,  switching  employers  as  the  contract  was  awarded  to  different
contracting  companies.  He  has  worked  for  his  current  employer  since  April  2021.  He
completed  his  most  recent  security  clearance  application  in  October  2013,  disclosing
$87,000 in delinquent debt for the deficiency balance on a repossessed vehicle and a
credit card. The ensuing investigation revealed other delinquent debt. The SOR alleged
that Applicant owed $159,459 on nine delinquent accounts. (GE 1 – 5; Tr. 21-22, 44)
Applicant’s financial problems began in 2014. He worked overseas for Company
1 from 2000 to 2013, when he experienced a medical issue that required him to return
to  the  United  States  for  treatment.  He  did  not  get  paid  while  on  medical  leave.  At  the
time  he  was  earning  between  $180,000  and  $190,000  annually.  While  he  was  out  on
medical  leave,  Company  1  lost  the  contract  on  which  he  was  working,  leaving  him
unemployed  after  he  was  given  medical  clearance  to  return  to  work.  As  a  result,
Applicant was unemployed from May 2014 to April 2015. (Tr. 23-27, 38, 71)
Applicant’s  wife  did  not  work  outside  the  home.  He  was  solely  responsible  for
paying  the  couple’s  financial  obligations.  During  his  period  of  unemployment,  he
depleted his $200,000 in retirement savings and used credit cards. Sometime in 2014 or
2015,  he  consulted  a  bankruptcy  attorney.  Ultimately,  he  decided  not  to  pursue
bankruptcy protection out of fear of losing the family home. (Tr. 27-28, 48-49, 70-71)
In May 2015, he began working for Company 2 on a federal contract. He earned
$3,000  per  month,  after  taxes  in  that  position.  In  December  2015,  he  returned  to
Company  1,  earning  between  $72,000  and  $74,000  annually,  less  than  half  of  his
previous  pay.  He  moved  to  Company  3  in  February  2016,  where  he  worked  for  three
months, leaving in May 2016 to work for Company 4. He did not earn sufficient income
to meet his expenses and continued to use credit cards as needed. Applicant’s finances
did  not  begin  to  recover  until  he  began  working  for  Company  4  in  May  2016,  earning
between $200,000 and $210,000. At some point, the contract transitioned to Company
5, Applicant’s current employer, but his salary remained the same. (Tr. 32, 39-41)
After  returning  to  work,  Applicant  prioritized  paying  off  small  accounts,  anything
ranging  from  $200  to  $1,500.  He  paid  off  a  total  of  $20,000  to  $25,000  in  small
accounts. He then focused on paying debts in his wife’s name. He believes that he has
paid between $40,000 to $50,000 of her delinquent debt. He then started to address the
debts accumulated in his name, paying off between $20,000 and $25,000. (Tr. 32, 39-
41)
In 2017 or 2018, the lender holding the student loans alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and
1.d, secured a garnishment against Applicant. He initially obtained the loans to finance
the college education of one of his three children. The garnishment, almost $1,600 per
pay  period,  remained  in  effect  until  April  2020,  when  President  Biden  instituted  the
student  loan  payment  pause  during  the  covid-19  pandemic.  He  believes  he  paid
between $72,000 and $80,000 toward the garnishment. During the payment pause, the
student  loans  were  considered  to  be  in  good  standing.  Although  the  payment  pause
was lifted as of October 2023, garnishments and other collection efforts will not resume
until  sometime  in  2024.  It  is  not  clear  if  garnishees  are  required  to  make  payments

Applicant has set the garnishment amount aside for savings. (AE B; Tr. 33, 59-61, 76)
He  also  initiated  payment  plans  on  the  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.c  ($24,360),
1.e  ($20,736),  and  1.f  ($11,950),  which  are  held  by  the  same  creditor.  However,  the
accounts  are  being  collected  by  three  separate  companies.  In  approximately  2017,  he
began  paying  $50  per  month  toward  each  account.  The  credit  reports  in  the  record,
which  range  in  dates  from  November  2020  to  March  2022,  show  that  the  account
balances have been decreasing in accordance with the plans. He resolved the account
in SOR ¶ 1.c in April 2023. In March 2023, he increased the monthly amount for SOR ¶
1.e from $50 per month to $300 per month. He has established payment dates with the
creditor  for  each  month  through  July  2024.  A  March  2023,  letter  from  the  agency
collecting  SOR  ¶  1.f,  confirms  the  information  in  the  credit  reports  that  the  account
balance is decreasing according to the $50 per month payment plan. (AE C-D, F-K; Tr.
51-57)
In April 2023, Applicant resolved the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.h ($4,904), a credit
card.  He  also  resolved  the  medical  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.i  ($1,027).  Applicant
testified at the hearing that he had not made any payments on the debts alleged in SOR
¶¶  1.a  ($33,281)  and  1.g  ($10,016).  Unbeknownst  to  Applicant,  the  creditor  issued  a
1099-C canceling SOR ¶ 1.a in 2018, three years before the SOR was issued. He was
also unaware the creditor holding SOR ¶ 1.g, cancelled that debt in 2021. He has asked
his accountant to refile his federal and state income tax returns for those years to reflect
the  debt  cancellation.  Applicant  has  also  provided  documentation  that  he  satisfied  a
non-SOR credit card debt for $4,160. (AE E, L-R; Tr. 49, 57-59)
In  addition  to  the  SOR  debts,  Applicant  has  also  been  paying  federal  and  state
income tax liabilities for the 2019 and 2020 tax years.  He did not have sufficient income
tax withheld from his pay during those years. He believes that he owes $15,000 federal
and state income taxes combined. He pays $420 toward the federal income tax liability
and $400 toward the state income tax liability, each month. (AE T-U; Tr. 65-69)
Applicant  provided  a  February  2023  credit  report  showing  that  he  has  a  credit
score  of  765.  His  credit  report  shows  that  he  is  not  currently  overly  reliant  on  credit,
with  only  19%  credit  usage.  Applicant  has  $26,000  in  cash  savings.  He  has  started  to
recoup his retirement savings, which are now $50,000. (AE A; 62-63)
