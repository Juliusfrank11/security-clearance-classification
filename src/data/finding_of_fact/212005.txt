In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶  1.a  and  SOR  ¶¶  4.a-4.g,
and  he  denied  SOR  ¶¶  2.a  and  3.a,  all  with  explanations.  SOR  ¶  3.b  is  a  cross-
allegation that he did not answer, so I consider that he denied it. Applicant’s admissions
are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 45 years old. He graduated from high school in 1997 and has taken
some  college  classes.  He  has  been  married  since  2008,  and  has  a  son,  18,  and  a
daughter,  15.  He  served  in  the  U.S.  Navy  from  October  1997  to  November  2016.  His
DD-214  discharge  form  reflects  that  he  received  the  Navy  and  Marine  Corps
Commendation  Medal, Joint Service Achievement  Medal,  five  Navy and  Marine Corps
Achievement  Medals,  and  six  Good  Conduct  Medals,  along  with  appropriate  service
medals.  (AE  R)  Applicant  received  a  general  discharge  under  honorable  conditions
following “Misconduct (Serious Offense).” He was unemployed for about seven months
after  he  left  the  Navy,  until  beginning  his  current  position  with  a  large  defense
contractor, in June 2017. He held a clearance in the Navy. (GE 1, GE 5, GE 6, GE 7; Tr.
10, 34, 46-47, 66-69; AE R)
In  September  2015,  Applicant  was  a  chief  petty  officer  (E-7)  on  a  U.S.  Navy
aircraft  carrier  at  sea.  Sailors  were  on  a  “holiday  schedule”  and  were  free  to  watch
movies and television. (GE 7 at 2) Applicant and several male sailors were at his work
area watching a football game. At about 2100 hours, Sailor S (E-3) went to Applicant’s
work area to use a  computer. Applicant was her mentor at the time. She was wearing
unauthorized  clothing  to  transit  the  ship,  including  Navy  physical  training  sweatpants
and a t-shirt. (GE 5 at 11; Tr. 39, 48-50, 113)
When  Sailor  S  sat  down,  Applicant  said  to  her,  “What  happened  to  [your]  ass,
you  really  don’t  have  any  back  there.”  Other  sailors  laughed.  Moments  later,  Sailor  S
asked  Applicant  for  some  candy  he  was  eating.  Applicant  asked  her,  “What  are  you
excited about?”, referring to the fact that her breasts were visible beneath her shirt. (GE
5 at 11)
Applicant  then  walked  towards  Sailor  S  with  the  bag  of  candy.  She  later  told
Naval  Criminal  Investigative  Service  (NCIS)  investigators  that  he  grabbed  her  right
breast while handing her the candy. She said, “he laughed when he grabbed my breast
and the other guys did too.” She pushed his hand away and said, “What the f---? Why
would you do that?” Sailor S then left, went to her own work center, and wrote Applicant
an  e-mail  telling  him  she  found  his  behavior  inappropriate,  offensive,  and  humiliating.
(GE 5 at 11)
Sailor  S  reported  the  matter  the  next  day.  NCIS  investigators  interviewed  the
three other sailors present that evening and obtained a sworn statement from Applicant.
Only  one  of  the  sailors  could  speak  to  the  allegations.  Witness  1  said  Applicant  told
Sailor  S  to  “pull  her  pants  up  over  her  flat  ass.”  Witness  1  was  unable  to  observe
whether Applicant grabbed Sailor S’s breast. (GE 5 at 11; GE 6 at 11-12)
In  her  sworn  statement  provided  to  NCIS,  Sailor  S  said  she  felt  humiliated  and
embarrassed  on  the  night  in  question.  She  said  Applicant  began  making  sexually
inappropriate comments towards her in about April 2014. She detailed an incident when
she was in the hospital and Applicant came to visit her. She said he sat on her bed, ran
his  fingers  through  her  hair,  and  called  her  “beautiful”  and  “sexy.”  She  found  his
behavior  offensive  but  did  not  report  it  since  she  thought  of  him  as  a  mentor.  His
grabbing her breast was the catalyst for her report. (GE 5 at 12) She was transferred to
another ship following her report. (GE 6 at 3)
Applicant  acknowledged  in  his  own  sworn  statement  to  NCIS  that  he  asked
Sailor S, “why are your pants sagging around  your flat ass?”  He also admitted that he
asked her if she was excited about something because he noticed that her “headlights
were on”  (meaning her nipples were showing through her shirt). He said he may have
“grazed  her  breast”  while  handing  her  the  bag  of  candy,  but  he  told  NCIS  that  any
contact was unintentional. He received the e-mail from Sailor S but did not respond, as
he planned to discuss it with her in person. (GE 5 at 11-12; GE 6 at 15)
In the NCIS interview, he said,
I handed  the  bag  to  her with  my right  hand  and  she  grab[bed]  with  her left
because   her  right  hand   is  in   a   [cast].  While   reaching   and   returning   my
hand,  she   pushed   my   arm   away  in  a[n]  upward   manner  because   I   had
grazed   her   breast.   I  didn’t   think   much   of   it  at   the   time,  this  was  not
intentional   or  a   purposely  done   act   to   degrade   her.   I   did   not  squeeze,
grab,  pinch, or grope  her  breast in any way. (GE 6  at 15)
Applicant’s  interactions  with  Sailor S  led  to  charges  under  the  Uniform  Code  of
Military Justice (UCMJ) Article 92 (Failure to Obey Order or Regulation), by “wrongfully
making  inappropriate  sexual  comments  to  [Sailor  S]  about  her  body  parts,  creating  a
hostile  work  environment”;  and  Article  120  (Abusive  Sexual  Contact)  by  touching  the
breast of Sailor S without her consent. In December 2015, at a nonjudicial punishment
(NJP)  proceeding  (captain’s  mast)  under Article  15  of  the  UCMJ,  he  pled  not  guilty  to
both  specifications  but  was  found  guilty  by  the  ship’s  commanding  officer  (CO).
Applicant was put on restriction for 45 days and forfeited $2,764 in pay for two months.
(GE 5. Tr. 48-49, 66-69) (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 2.a, 3.b)
The  CO  found  that  the  witnesses’  statements  at  the  NJP  proceeding  were
consistent with their statements to NCIS. Applicant admitted at the captain’s mast that
his  comments  to  Sailor  S  that  evening  were  inappropriate  and  offensive.  He  admitted
that  he  had  allowed  their  relationship  to  become  unprofessional  and  unduly  familiar.
(GE 5 at 12)
The CO found that “it is clear that [Applicant] made inappropriate comments of a
sexual  nature  about  [Sailor  S’s]  buttocks  and  breasts,  engaged  in  an  unduly  familiar
relationship with her, and fostered an environment where she was comfortable ignoring
the uniform restrictions in his work center.” He found that Applicant was not credible in
asserting that he may have accidentally touched Sailor S’s breast, “in light of his sexual
statements  made  immediately  before  the  incident  and  the  evidence  of  fraternization.”
(GE  5  at  12)  He  found  that  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence  supported  the  charges.
(GE 5 at 9)
The CO found that Applicant’s behavior
impacted   good   order  and   discipline,   goes  against   the   U.S.  Navy’s  Core
Values,  and   distracts   from   the   Navy’s  mission.  His  behavior  clearly
violated   the   Navy’s  sexual  harassment   policy,  created   a   hostile   work
environment,   and   violated   all   bounds  of  decency.  He  abused   the   trust
placed  in  him by  this command  as a  Chief Petty Officer. He further abused
his position  as a  mentor to  junior sailors. This behavior has  no  place  in our
Navy.  He must  be held  accountable  for his actions. (GE 5  at 13)
Applicant  retained  legal  counsel  and  appealed  the  NJP  findings  to  the
commander of the carrier strike group, but his appeal was denied. (GE 5) Based on the
CO’s findings, Applicant was recommended for administrative separation (ADSEP) from
the Navy. In March 2016, the ADSEP board convened and found sufficient evidence of
misconduct  due  to  his  commission  of  a  serious  offense.  The  board  recommended  a
general  discharge  under  honorable  conditions.  (GE  6  at  5)  Applicant  was  discharged
from  the  Navy  as  recommended  in  November  2016.  (AE  R)  (SOR  ¶  3.a)  He  was
discharged  after  serving  19  years  and  two  months  in  the  Navy,  with  the  rank  of  chief
petty officer (E-7). (AE R; Tr. 34-35, 66-69, 71-73)
Applicant  adamantly  denied  Sailor  S’s  allegations  in  his  security  clearance
background  interview.  (GE  7  at  4)  In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted
receiving  captain’s  mast  but  denied  the  underlying  conduct,  asserting  that  the  CO  did
not properly consider the evidence presented.
Applicant  began  his  hearing  testimony  by  asserting  that  the  allegations  were
“very  much  fabricated.”  (Tr.  29)  He  acknowledged  using  “a  poor  choice  of  words”  by
telling  Sailor  S  to  “pull  your  pants  up  on  your  ass,  and,  hey,  your  headlights  are
showing.”  He  said  his  “intent  was  to  just  make  her  aware  of  her  unform  appearance.”
(Tr.  30,  45)  He  denied  approaching  Sailor  S  in  any  sexual  manner  or  making
advancements  towards  her.  He  believes  it  was  “unfair”  for  her  to  have  made  those
allegations. (Tr. 30) He feels the Navy did him a disservice, and he believes people do
not want to make statements (in his favor) and jeopardize their own career. (Tr. 30-31)
Applicant  said  Sailor  S  was  in  his  department  on  the  ship,  one  of  about  400
sailors.  He  said  he  was  not  her  supervisor,  but  she  asked  him  and  another  sailor  to
mentor her. Initially he told her she should be mentored by a first class or second class
petty  officer,  but  he  agreed  to  mentor  her  as  a  chief  petty  officer.  He  saw  her  in  his
department  “all  the  time,  two  of  three  times  a  week.”  (Tr.  38-39)  Applicant  said  their
relationship  was  a  strictly  professional,  mentor-mentee  relationship  and  they  were  on
good terms. (Tr. 50-51, 64)
Applicant  testified  that  on  the  evening  in  question,  the  ship  was  on  “holiday
routine”  on  a  Sunday  evening.  Applicant  and  some  junior  male  sailors  were  watching
football and relaxing. When Sailor S sat down, he said she needed to “pull your pants
up on your ass” and that “your headlights are on” because her nipples were protruding
from  her  shirt.  He  said  he  wanted  her  to  be  mindful  of  her  appearance  around  junior
male  sailors.  (Tr.  39;  51-53)  He  did  not  recall  any  of  the  other  sailors  laughing  or
reacting at the time. (Tr. 54)
Applicant said Sailor S asked if he had any candy, and he had some on his desk
and he reached over to where she was sitting and gave her some. One of her arms was
in a cast. He handed her the candy and she took it. (Tr. 53-56) He denied grabbing her
breast.  He  told  the  NCIS  investigator  that  he  doubted  that  he  accidentally  grazed  her
breast  but  that  it  was  a  possibility.  He  said  he  “never  grabbed  her  [and]  never  did
anything to her physically. I simply handed her the candy.” He said he hit or grazed her
arm that was in the cast. (Tr. 57-62; GE 6 at 15-16)
Applicant  said  that,  afterwards,  Sailor  S  sat  at  the  computer  for  another  30-45
minutes.  He  later  learned  that  she  was  upset  and  went  to  her  division  office  and  was
crying, but she was not upset or emotional when she left his office. (Tr. 62-64)
The  next morning  Applicant  was told by NCIS  that Sailor S had alleged  that he
had  grabbed  her  breast.  He  cooperated  with  the  investigation.  He  was  scheduled  to
transfer to another duty station, but the investigation put the transfer on hold. He denied
going to the emergency room in the hospital with Sailor S. rubbing her hair and calling
her “beautiful.” (Tr. 39-43)
Sailor  S  was  transferred  off  the  ship  within  72  hours  after  she  made  the
allegations against Applicant, per Navy policy. Applicant said he did not want to be seen
as  someone  who  “goes  around  grabbing  on  people,  especially  females.”  He  asserted
that  Sailor  S  had  “character  problems,”  had  twice  been  to  captain’s  mast  herself,  and
had  been  released  from  the  Navy  for  performance  issues.  He  did  not  believe  he  was
being treated  equally  and  fairly,  as  he  felt the  allegations  were  based on  hearsay and
without concrete evidence. (Tr. 43-45, 114)
At captain’s mast, Applicant was asked by the CO about the incident with Sailor
S and he said it was fabricated, and he did not know why she would not have done this.
He  suggested  during  his  testimony  that  it  was  because  she  wanted  to  get  out  of  the
deployment, but he does not know that. (Tr. 63-64)
With  respect  to  Sailor  S’s  allegations about  the  incident  in the  hospital  in  2014,
Applicant said he escorted her to the hospital once because she was on restriction from
a  previous  captain’s  mast.  He  remained  in  the  lobby  for  about  two  hours.  The  doctor
came  out  and  asked  him  if  he  knew  of  any  reason  that  she  would  not  be  able  to  get
underway  (with  the  ship).  He  denied  that  he  visited  her  in  the  hospital  and  was  only
there to escort her as an E-7 as required. (Tr. 65-66; GE 7 at 4-5)
Applicant said he “went into a spiral” of depression after he was discharged from
the Navy after 19 years and two months of service. He said he is a top performer at his
job.  He  also  depleted his  savings  during his  period  of  unemployment  after  leaving  the
Navy. He is currently seeing mental health therapists with the Department of Veterans
Affairs (VA). (Tr. 32-33, 74, 99-101, 115-116)
Applicant said that after leaving  the  Navy, he  had no  income  and  was  “obsessed”
with   trying   to   clear  his   name   and   get  his   discharge   status  overturned   (i.e.,  upgraded).
(Tr 32)  He also  said he  was helping  family members financially and  he  took a  large  pay
cut  after   leaving   the   Navy,  from   $76,000   to   $47,000   annually.   He  said  he   had   settled
and  cleared up  about $19,000  of his $31,000  in delinquent debts. (Tr. 33, 36-37, 105-
106)   He  paid  his  lawyer  about  $13,000   to   appeal  the   captain’s  mast   and   to   represent
him during  and after his ADSEP  board proceeding. (Tr. 72-74
Applicant  does not  receive  retirement pay from the  Navy, but he has a  service-
connected disability for which he receives $1,907 a month from the VA, with an annual
cost of living adjustment. His annual salary at his job is $67,815, up from $47,000 when
he was hired. His wife is a nurse, earning about $30,000 annually. They pay household
expenses  jointly.  (Tr.  35-36,  73-77,  108,  117;  AE  K,  AE  P,  AE  Q)  Applicant’s  work
evaluations  reflect  that  he  is  an  outstanding  leader  who  makes  a  significant  positive
impact. (AE M – AE O)
Under Guideline  F, the  SOR  concerns  seven  delinquent debts,  totaling  just  under
$32,000. The  debts are  established  by  credit  bureau  reports (CBRs) in the  record, from
March  2022, June 2021, November  2020, and  August 2023. (GE 2-GE  4, GE  8) (SOR ¶
4)  Applicant disclosed  some debts on  his SCA. (GE  1)
Applicant made payments on most of his SOR debts, but only did so days before
the hearing. He financed these payments with a $19,000 loan, in late August 2023. (Tr.
87-88,  93,  109)  He  plans  to  continue  to  work  to  resolve  his  debts  and  improve
financially.  (Tr. 115)  He  is  to repay  the  loan with  $487 payments  over  60 months.  (Tr.
121; AE L)
SOR  ¶  4.a  ($2,511)  is  an  account  placed  for  collection.  It  relates  to  a  furniture
purchase. Applicant said the furniture began to come apart a month after he bought it,
so  he  stopped  paying  on  the  account.  He  made  a  settlement  agreement  with  the
creditor for $2,260. The account was resolved with a payment in late August 2023. (Tr.
77-80; GE 2 at 4; GE 4 at 3, GE 8 at 4; AE A, AE B)
SOR ¶  4.b  ($2,378)  is an  account that  has been  charged  off. (GE 2  at  4,  GE  3,
GE  8  at  5)  Applicant paid this  account  in late  August 2023. (AE  A, AE G,  AE  H; Tr.  81-
83)
SOR  ¶  4.c  ($1,147  past  due,  total  balance  $3,957)  is  a  financial  account,
probably a loan, money Applicant used for vehicle maintenance and repairs. (GE 2 at 5,
8  at  8)  A  civil  judgment  was  issued  in  April 2022.  Applicant  did  not  appear  in  court  to
defend  himself  since  he  was  overseas.  He  went  to  court  and  paid  the  full  amount  in
August 2023. (Tr. 81-85; AE A, AE F)
SOR  ¶  4.d  ($14,267)  is  a  military  exchange  account  placed  for  collection.  The
account was pending when Applicant separated from the Navy and he was allowed to
defer  payments  until  he  found  employment,  but  he  did  not  follow  up  and  the  account
became past due. He settled the debt for $12,096, in August 2023. (Tr. 85-88; GE 2 at
7, GE 3, GE 4 at 2, GE 8 at 5; AE A, AE C, AE I, AE J)
SOR ¶ 4.e ($5,184) is an account that has been placed for collection. (GE 2 at 7,
GE 3, GE 4 at 2) Applicant believes he took out this loan to provide financial assistance
to a family member with a serious medical issue. He settled the debt for $777 in August
2023. (AE A, AE D, AE E; Tr. 88-90)
SOR ¶ 4.f ($328) is an insurance debt placed for collection. It last appeared on a
CBR in June 2021. (GE 3, GE 5) Applicant admitted the debt in his Answer to the SOR
and  said  he  would  settle  it.  He  said  at  his  hearing  that  he  still  has  insurance  with  the
creditor and is unsure what this debt is about. (Tr. 90-92)
SOR ¶ 4.g ($3,350) is a debt placed for collection by a loan company. (GE 4 at 3)
Applicant  said  in  his  Answer  that  he  intended  to  resolve  it.  In  his  hearing  he  said  he
wants  to  clear  it  up  but  is  not  sure  if  he  owes  the  debt  or  not.  He  last  contacted  the
creditor in May or June 2023. (Tr. 90-92)
In  about  2015,  before  he  left  the  Navy,  Applicant  said  he  got  about  $100,000
from a settlement of what he said was a class- action lawsuit relating to the short sale of
some  real  estate.  He  said  he  used  the  proceeds  to  pay  off  debts,  buy  a  car,  and  for
some other expenses. (Tr. 95-98, 103-107)
Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  has  about  $13,000  in  past-due  federal  income
taxes  that  resulted  from  that  windfall.  He  said  he  has  been  on  a  payment  plan  since
2018 and pays $406 a month. At the time of the hearing (August 31, 2023), he had not
filed his 2022 federal income tax return and had not sought a filing extension. He said
he had been sent on an overseas assignment for his job that was extended for several
months. He missed the filing deadline and neglected to speak with his accountant about
it.  (Tr.  93-97,  102-107)  This  is  not  alleged  in  the  SOR  and  will  not  be  considered  as
disqualifying conduct.
Applicant  has  participated  in  credit  counseling  in  recent  months.  After  the
hearing,  he  provided  monthly  budget  information  detailing  his  VA  benefits  ($1,907),
income  from  his  job  ($2,061  biweekly  =  $4,122)  and  monthly  expenses,  including  his
mortgage  and  the  $487  monthly  payment  on  the  loan  he  used  to  address  his  SOR
debts. (Tr. 108-110; AE L)
Applicant closed his testimony by asserting that if he could go back to September
2015 and do things differently, he would. His work with his counselors has helped him
realize that he has responsibilities. He let his personal pride get in the way. He wants to
upgrade his discharge and also to address his financial shortfalls. He is valued at work
and up to the point of his NJP he was a stellar performer in the Navy. (Tr, 119-120)
