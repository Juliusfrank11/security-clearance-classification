Applicant  admitted  all  the  SOR  allegations. He is 42  years old, married, and  he
has four children, only one  of whom  is a  minor.  He  graduated  from  high  school in  2008
and   attended   some   college   but  did  not  earn  a   degree.   He  has  owned   his home   since
December 2021.  (Answer; Tr.  at  6, 23-24, 49; GE  1)
Applicant has  worked  primarily as a  shipfitter for various  DOD contractors  since
approximately 2008.  He was unemployed  from  January 2016  to  May 2016  and  May to
June  2017, due  to  layoffs because  of  a  lack of  work. He has worked  as a  general foreman
for his  current  employer since  March 2020. He has  never held  a  security clearance. (Tr.
at 5, 7-9, 24-32; GE 1-2)
The   SOR  alleged   that  Applicant   had   3   delinquent  consumer  debts,   totaling
$61,858.  SOR  ¶  1.a  is  a  credit card  in collection  for $15,922, and  SOR ¶¶  1.b-1.c  are
charged-off  credit cards for $29,740 and $16,196, respectively.  The  SOR allegations are
established  by his admissions in his  Answer; his  June  2020  security clearance  application
(SCA);  his July 2021  response  to  financial interrogatories; and  credit bureau  reports from
August 2020 and March 2022.  (Answer;  Tr. at 24-32; GE  1-4)
Applicant  attributes   his   delinquent  debts  to   his  periods  of   unemployment   and
minimal income.  In  around  2007,  he  used  the  credit  cards  in SOR ¶¶  1.a-1.c  to  pay for
$40,000    of  training    to    be    a    real  estate    investor.  The    training    taught  him    “how  to    flip
properties and   buy   and   hold   wholesale . . . .” He made   monthly payments on   the   credit
cards until he became  unemployed. He also  used  the  credit cards  to  pay for his  family’s
daily living  expenses when  he  was  unemployed. During  his periods  of  unemployment,  his
spouse also worked  only part time. (Tr. at 24-32, 35-39, 44-47; GE  1-2)
Applicant  contacted   each   of  the   creditors   when   he   lost   his  job   in  2016.  He
attempted   to   lower  his   monthly  payments  until  he   was  re-employed,  but  the   creditors
denied  his  request.  When  the  creditors later offered  him  lower monthly payments,  he  was
still  unemployed. When  employed, he  earned  approximately $50,000  annually from  2012
to  2017; $70,000  annually from  2017  to  2019; $55,000  annually from  2019  to  2020; and
$87,000  annually since  March 2020. His spouse, who  has worked  full  time  as a  dental
hygienist  since  2018,  earned  $60,000  annually. (Tr. at 24-32,  35-39,  44-46,  52-54;  GE  1-
2)
As of the  date  of  the  hearing,  Applicant  had  not  made  any payments toward the
SOR  debts.   He   had   to   pay  for  two   other  credit  cards,   and   he   also   paid  approximately
$15,000  total  in taxes  to  the  IRS  from  around  2017  to  2020. As of the  date  of  the  hearing,
he did not owe  delinquent taxes to  the  IRS.  He  and  his spouse  also  took out two  loans  in
2021, totaling  $38,000,  to  renovate  their  home. His monthly payments for the  loans were
$756   and   $275,  respectively.  Once   he   paid  these   loans,  he   intended   to   pay  the   SOR
debts.  (Tr. at 39-44, 47-54)
Applicant and his spouse jointly manage their household finances, and they utilize
a budget to do so. He stated that their monthly household net income was approximately
$7,500.  After  paying  their  monthly  household  expenses,  which  included  their  $2,053
mortgage and the $1,031 payment toward their two loans, he estimated that they had a
monthly net remainder of $400. His budget did not include payments to any of the SOR
debts. He has not received credit counseling. A June 2023 credit report reflects that he
does not have any delinquent debts. (Tr. at 49-52; GE 2, 5)
