In  Applicant’s  response  to  the  SOR,  she  admitted  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a.
through 1.l, but denied allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.h, and 1.j. For each admitted allegation,
she  provided  clarifying  comments  to  explain  the  underlying  circumstances.  Her
admissions with clarifying comments are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  54-year-old  interpreter  and  linguist  sponsored  by  a  defense
contractor. She is a fluent speaker of the Pashtun, Urdu, Hindi, and Punjabi languages,
in addition to English. She earned associate and bachelor’s degrees in 1990 prior to her
arrival in the United States. (GE 1 at 16; Tr. 34-35 ) Born in Pakistan, she married a U.S.
citizen in 1991 and moved to the United States in 1992. She became a naturalized U.S.
citizen in April 2007, and she currently holds dual U.S. and Pakistan citizenship. (GE 1;
Tr. 29-31)
After their marriage in 1991, Applicant and her husband became parents to  five
children  ages  32,  31,  28,  and  20-year-old  twins.  In  2007,  they  divorced  and  Applicant
became the custodial parent of their five children. (GE 1; Tr. 29-31)
From  2008  through  about  February  2012,  Applicant  worked  part-time  as  a
community  college  instructor.  She  was  laid  off  following  a  company-wide  reduction  in
force, and remained unemployed for about 10 months. She enrolled in college courses
during this period of unemployment to enhance her marketable skills. (GE 1)
In  December  2012,  Applicant  found  work  as  a  defense  contract  linguist.  After
training, she deployed to Afghanistan  for her duties  until  about  July 2013. She  left  the
position  after  experiencing  a  family  emergency.  She  was  unemployed  for  about  eight
months  before  finding  another  defense  contract  linguist  position  in  March  2014.  She
worked  in  the  same  position  with  two  different  defense  contractors  from  March  2014
through about April 2016, when she was released from the contract. About four months
of unemployment followed her release. (GE 1)
From October 2016 through about June 2017, Applicant found work as a part-time
substitute teacher, but was struggling financially due to not having enough work hours.
She  moved  the  family  to  another  state  and  was  unemployed  from  June  2017  through
October 2018. She worked as a ride-share driver during this period, and she would do
other odd jobs to help “keep a roof over her children’s heads.” She did whatever she could
to  earn money.  (GE 1;  Tr.  48-50) During this  period,  she and her children  lived in  low
income, federally subsidized housing and the family received subsidized monies for food
expenditures. She received about $373 per month in child support payments from her ex-
husband, and he would reduce the amount sent every time a child would reach the age
of 18 years. (Tr. 33-34, and 85-86) During periods of unemployment or underemployment,
she  used  personal  loans  and  credit  cards  to  pay  housing  and  other  essential  living
expenses until she could find work.
Between  2017  and  2021,  several  of  Applicant’s  extended  family  members  died
unexpectedly, including her bother, both parents, and a grandmother; and as the eldest
daughter, she was  expected  to  contribute  to  the  family’s  payment of  funeral expenses
based on religious traditions, a moral obligation. (Tr. 62-69)
In   about  October  2018,  Applicant   began   working   as  a   self-employed   contractor
doing  over-the-phone  interpretation  for two  defense  contractors.  (GE  1  pp. 17-18; Tr. at
36)  She   has  been   employed   since   she   created   this  position,  though   her  work  is  not
steady. Her employment at this  time  is sporadic: she  may or may not get  called  for an
assignment.  She   works on   an  “as  needed” basis. (Tr.  at 38) In  between  calls for work,
she   babysits   her   grandchildren.  Applicant   currently  does  not   have   her  own   home   or
apartment.  She  lives  with  her second-eldest  daughter  as she  awaits  more  stable  work as
a   linguist.  (Tr.   38-43)   Applicant   is  currently   financially  supported   by   her   emergency
savings and  three of  her adult  children.  (Tr.  39-42, and  95-97)
From December 2021 through about April 2023, Applicant deployed to Kuwait and
worked as an interpreter for a defense contractor. She received a salary of $80,000 U.S.
dollars  per  year  including  bonuses.  No  hazardous  duty  pay  was  included  in  the
arrangement. (Tr. 43-45) The defense contractor paid for housing, but she was required
to  pay  living  expenses  including  food,  water,  driving/taxi  service,  taxes,  and  daily
expenses for the interpreter business. Her salary was paid in U.S. dollars, but she was
required  to  conduct  business  in  the  local  Kuwaiti  currency,  the  Kuwaiti  dinar,  a  very
expensive  currency.  (Tr.  46-47)  Applicant  stated  she  sent  about  $1,200  home  to  her
children for their living expenses. Her youngest children, twins, were under 20 years old
when she started the position.
The SOR alleges 12 financial concerns (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.l) totaling about $52,000
in delinquent consumer and medical debts  reflected in credit bureau reports from April
2021,  November 2022,  and  August  2023.  (GE  2, 3, and  4) The evidence  in this case,
including Applicant’s and her witness’s testimony and documents submitted in mitigation
(AE A - AE H), is summarized below.
SOR ¶¶  1.a  ($19,055), 1.e  ($5,264), and 1.f  ($3,154): Applicant admitted these
consumer debts, all from the same creditor, with explanation. She fell behind on payments
during periods of unemployed. She immediately contacted the creditor to work out revised
payment  arrangements.  She  was  given  a  six-month  reprieve  during  the  COVID-19
pandemic,  and  restarted  payments  afterwards.  She  provided  proof  of  their  current
agreement, and demonstrated that she has been paying a combined amount of $100 per
month spread between the three debts over an extended time. Her receipts in AE D, and
reduced account balances reflected in GE 4: SOR ¶¶ 1.a ($16,230), 1.e ($4,814), and 1.f
($2,704); show she is following their agreement. (GE 2, 3, and 4; AE D; and Tr. 52-56)
These debts are being resolved.
SOR ¶¶ 1.b ($7,865)  and 1.c ($7,623): Applicant admitted these consumer debts
from the same creditor with explanation. She fell behind on her debts during periods of
unemployment, and particularly the COVID-19 pandemic. She immediately contacted the
creditor to work out revised payment arrangements. She provided proof, in AE E, that she
has been paying $65 per month on each account for an extended time. Reduced account
balances are reflected in GE 3 and 4. (GE 2, 3, and 4; AE E; and Tr. at 56, 70-71) These
debts are being resolved.
SOR ¶  1.d ($5,523):  Applicant admitted this consumer debt with explanation. She
fell behind on her debts during periods of unemployment, and particularly the COVID-19
pandemic. In her March 2022 response to the SOR, she stated she was on a repayment
plan with the creditor. At some point, the creditor no longer wanted to collect the debt and
stated it was sending her a form 1099, cancellation of debt. She was working in the middle
east at the time, and did not receive the creditor’s 1099. She contacted the creditor upon
her return to the United States. She provided notes of her communications with creditors
while deployed in support of her testimony. (AE H) The creditor was unable to locate her
debt or provide information concerning the whereabouts of the form 1099. The debt does
not appear in GE 3 or 4. She is awaiting the creditor’s final communication regarding the
1099.  (SOR  response  of  March  2022;  GE  2;  AE  H;  and  Tr.  71-73)  This  debt  is  being
resolved.
SOR   ¶¶   1.g   ($2,470)   and  1.i   ($387):   Applicant  admitted  these  consumer  debts
with  explanation.  As  with  the  other  delinquent  debts,  Applicant  fell  behind  on  her
payments  during  periods  of  unemployment,  and  particularly  during  the  COVID-19
pandemic. She testified the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.g was unwilling to work with her initially.
(Tr. at 56). However, her eldest daughter helped her to pay off this delinquent debt over
time.  She  presented  evidence  she  consistently  made  payments  starting  in  about  June
2022. (AE H) Her paid receipts in AE D and H and the reduced balance reflected in GE 4
for SOR ¶ 1.g ($1,482), demonstrates she took action to repay this delinquent debt. The
debt  is now paid  off.  (GE  2,  3  and  4;  AE  D  and  H;  Tr.  at  56,  73) Moreover,  Applicant
negotiated settlement of the delinquent debt in SOR 1.i, and paid it off while deployed.
(AE H; and Tr. at 78) The debt in SOR ¶ 1.i appears in GE 2, but it does not appear in
GE 3 or 4. Both debts are resolved.
SOR  ¶¶   1.h   ($870)   and  1.j   ($136):   Applicant  consistently  and  credibly  denied
these medical debts. Per the 2021 credit report, these medical charges were incurred in
about  2016,  a  time  when  Applicant  was unemployed and  living  in  federally  subsidized
housing.  (GE  2  pp. 4-5) She  testified these debts were  covered by  Medicaid, and  she
initially filed documents incorrectly. She resubmitted the documents and Medicaid paid
balances on both accounts. (SOR response of March 2022; GE 2; Tr. at 16, 77) These
debts are resolved.
SOR ¶¶  1.k  ($86)  and 1.l  ($327): Applicant admitted these debts with explanation.
The medical debt in SOR ¶ 1.k, incurred in 2016, was also paid by Medicaid. (GE 2; Tr.
at  77).  This  debt  does  not  appear  in  GE  3  or  4.  Nor  does  it  appear  in  AE  G.  Finally,
Applicant also submitted proof she paid off the consumer debt in SOR ¶ 1.l in AE D. (GE
2; AE D at 20; Tr. at 81) Both debts are resolved.
Applicant is supported by sporadic employment as an interpreter and by three of
her adult children who have helped her to repay delinquent debts in this SOR. She also
has emergency funds spread across three savings accounts. She currently resides with
her daughter, and she has no additional bills to pay. She lives frugally, and she credibly
testified she is committed to resolving her remaining delinquent debts; and that she is on
track to accomplish her goal in about 12 to 24 months. (Tr. at 97). Her finances are better
without  additional  living  expenses.  She  reported  has  two  pending  full-time  linguist  job
prospects. She has successfully maintained a budget in the past while unemployed and
living in federally subsidized housing; she knows how to keep a budget. (Tr. at 84, 87, 95,
97)
Applicant volunteers for a local church that provides food to the community. She
called a witness, her daughter, who has been instrumental in helping her get back on her
feet  after  tumultuous  periods  of  unemployment  and  underemployment.  She  submitted
letters  attesting  to  her  positive  moral  character.  She  is  praised  for  her  character,
dependability, honesty, work ethic, trustworthiness, and resilience. (Tr. 87-98; AE A)
