Applicant is 29 years old. She has been employed by a defense contractor since
June 2016 and has worked as a software test engineer since January 2022. She has had
a security clearance since October 2016. She attended college from August 2012 to May
2016 and earned a bachelor’s degree. She has not been married and has one child, age
seven. (GE 1; AE G; Tr. 87-88)
The  SOR alleges 28  delinquent  debts totaling  $97,643, including  18  student loans
totaling $89,011. In Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, she  admitted the allegations in  SOR
¶¶  1.b-1.g, 1.i-1.x,  with  explanations,  and denied  the allegations  in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.h,  1.y-
1.bb, with  explanations. Her  admissions are accepted as findings of fact.
Applicant  attributes  her  financial  problems  to  an  abusive  former  fiancé  and  his
failure  to  pay  child  support  and  her  attorney  fees,  his  underemployment  and
unemployment, her child support costs, and her lack of education and experience with
credit. Applicant testified that she separated from her abusive former fiancé in May 2019
and  hired  an  attorney  in  March  2020  to  obtain  child  support,  incurring  legal  fees  of
$14,000. She provided documentary evidence that her former fiancé engaged in domestic
violence against her, that in June 2021 a state court ordered him to pay child support of
$656 per month plus $200 per month towards child support arrearages of $19,392, that
in May 2023 he requested to reduce his monthly child support obligation because he lost
a  job  and  was  earning  about  40%  of  his  previous  wages,  and  that  a  hearing  was
scheduled for August 2023 to consider his request. (Answer; GE 1; AE G; Tr. 46-51)
Applicant admitted that she had limited education and experience with credit. After
being asked detailed financial questions by a government investigator during the security
clearance investigation, she realized that she needed to better understand her financial
situation and started to act on her delinquent accounts. During the hearing, Applicant still
did not appear to fully comprehend the scope of her financial problems. She was informed
of  the  importance  of  submitting  documentary  evidence  of  debt  payments,  efforts  to
contact creditors or to resolve or otherwise address delinquent debts. (Tr. 57-65, 69-70,
91-92, 101-102)
The evidence concerning the specific SOR allegations is summarized below.
SOR ¶  1.a: credit  account  placed  for collection of  $318. Applicant denied the
allegation and said that she had paid the debt in full. (Answer) Credit reports from May
2021,  November  2021  and  June  2023  show  the  account  as  in  collection  for  $318.
Applicant provided evidence that she paid the creditor $318 in July 2021. (GE 2 at 2, GE
3 at 5, GE 6 at 1-2, GE 4 at 9) I find for Applicant on this allegation.
SOR ¶¶  1.b-1.f, 1.j-1.m: student loans  charged off for $7,831;  $7,019;  $8,316;
$8,317;  $10,437;  $6,133;  $6,986;  $5,984;  $5,946  totaling  $66,969. Applicant admitted
each allegation and explained that these student loan accounts had been consolidated
with a monthly payment of about $212. (Answer at 3-4) A May 2021 credit report shows
the SOR accounts were joint account student loans from a private lender opened from
June 2012 to August 2015 and were 90 to 120 days past due. (GE 3 at 8, 9, 12-14) A
November  2021  credit  report  reflects  the  accounts  were  charged  off  in  the  amounts
alleged. (GE 2 at 4-5, 7-8) A June 2023 credit report shows the balance of each charged-
off account increased from November 2021 to June 2023 as follows: $7,831 to $9,025;
$7,019  to  $8,300;  $8,316  to  $9,733;  $8,317  to  $9,735;  $10,437  to  $12,259;  $6,133  to
$7,215; $6,986 to $8,218; $5,984 to $6,970; and $5,946 to $6,906. (GE 6 at 8-12)
Applicant testified that she started making payments on these loans in 2017 and
acknowledged missing some payments. She said that she contacted the lender in 2020
or 2021 and after providing requested information, the lender specified a payment which
is  withdrawn  from  her  bank  account  monthly.  She  said  that  she  was  current  on  the
account and making payments under a payment plan. She submitted an extract from a
June 2023 credit report showing a student loan account  “in  good  standing” and  with  a
balance of $1,103, but with no other account information. After the hearing, she provided
evidence showing payments from February 2017 to June 2023 on an account with the
same lender but not alleged in the SOR. That account was opened in October 2014 in
the amount of $1,000, reported as current in credit reports, and with balance of $1,089 in
June 2023. (Tr. 52-65, 63, 90, 100-101; AE K; GE 3 at 14, GE 2 at 7, GE 6 at 9)
After the hearing, Applicant also submitted bank records showing payments to the
creditor  in  February, June  and  July 2017  (about  $150  each);  September  2017  ($330);
December  2017  through  June  2019  (about  $288  per  month);  August  2019  ($153);
November 2019 ($288); March 2020 ($627), and August 2020 ($1,419). Her bank records
from March 2018 through June 2019 included loan account numbers and show payments
on seven accounts alleged in the SOR. The bank records also show payments on two
accounts with the same lender, but not alleged in the SOR. One of the non-SOR accounts
is the student loan shown as current and discussed above. The other non-SOR student
loan was opened in June 2016, shown as charged-off in a June 2023 credit report, and
with a balance of $1,704. (AE K, N; GE 3 at 14, GE 2 at 6; GE 6 at 7) Applicant provided
no  documentary  evidence  of  a  payment  agreement  for  the  delinquent  student  loans
alleged in the SOR, or of payment on those loans since at least August 2020.
SOR ¶  1.g: credit account  placed for collection of  $729. Applicant admitted the
allegation and said that she was working to pay the debt. Credit reports from May 2021
and November 2021, show the account as in collection for $729. A June 2023 credit report
shows the account as in collection for $267. Applicant testified that she had two payments
remaining under an agreement with the creditor and provided documentary evidence that
she  entered  a  payment  plan  in  February  2023,  made  the  required  payments  from
February to June 2023, and reduced the account balance to $151. (Answer; GE 3 at 5,
GE 2 at 5, GE 6 at 4; AE B, AE M; Tr. 74, 97-98) This debt is being resolved.
SOR ¶  1.h: credit account  placed for collection of  $3,654. Applicant denied the
allegation. (Answer) Credit reports from May and November 2021 show the account was
opened in June 2019, and in collection for $3,654. A June 2023 credit report shows the
account as in collection for $3,599. Applicant testified that she contacted the creditor a
few months before the hearing when she could afford to address this debt. She said that
she had made one payment under the agreement and intended to make future payments.
She provided evidence of a payment plan that required 66 monthly payments of $55, and
that she made the first required payment in June 2023 reducing the account balance to
$3,598. (GE 3 at 2, GE 2 at 6, GE 6 at 4; AE C; Tr. 74-77, 98-99)
SOR ¶  1.i: credit account placed for collection of  $392. Applicant admitted the
allegation and said that she was working to pay it. (Answer) Credit reports from May 2021,
November 2021, and June 2023 show the account as opened or assigned in July 2019,
and as in collection for $392. (GE 3 at 5, GE 2 at 6, GE 6 at 4) She testified that she
contacted the creditor a few months before the hearing when she could afford to address
this debt and the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.h. She mistakenly believed she had negotiated
a  single  payment  plan  for  both  debts.  After  the  hearing  she  submitted  evidence  of  a
payment  agreement  with  the  creditor  requiring  monthly  payments  from  July  2023  until
September 2023 to resolve this debt. (AE J; Tr. 74-77)
SOR ¶¶  1.n-1.u: student  loans  placed  for collection including $3,171; $1,552;
$2,426;   $1,471;   $3,894;   $1,932;   $1,561;   and  $3,851   totaling   $19,858.  Applicant
admitted  each  allegation  and  said  that  she  was  working  with  the  U.S.  Department  of
Education (DoED) to identify a monthly payment. (Answer at 4) Credit reports from May
and November 2021 show the loans were individual accounts, opened from September
2012  to  August  2015,  and  that  each  account  was  assigned  to  the  Government  for
collection  in  the  amounts  alleged.  A  June  2023  Credit  report  shows  the accounts  with
balances  alleged  in  the  SOR  but  no  past  due  balance.  Applicant  submitted  an  extract
from a June 2023 credit report showing nine DoED student loans including eight in the
amounts alleged  in the  SOR as “In  good  standing.”  Applicant testified that these loans
were reflected as in good standing because of COVID federal student loan relief and her
efforts to consolidate them. (GE 2 at 8-11, GE 3 at 2-4, GE 6 at 5-7; AE D; Tr. 99-100)
Applicant reported and testified that she was not aware of the federal student loans
until about May 2018, when her federal income tax refund was withheld. She said some
payments were made on these loans through garnishment of her wages starting in 2019,
and with funds withheld from her federal income tax refunds from 2018 until COVID. She
did not take any action after learning about these loans or try to determine how much she
owed  because  she  thought  that  “was  how  the  payment  process  was  going  to  be” and
because she did not then understand how much financial considerations could affect her.
After  the  hearing,  she  submitted  evidence  of  payments  totaling  about  $13,600  from
November 2018 to April 2020 including treasury offsets totaling $7,652. (GE 1 at 31-32;
AE L; Tr. 67-72)
Applicant testified that some of her federal student loans had been consolidated,
that  she  had  not  yet  made  a  payment  on  those  loans,  and  that  she  was  trying  to
consolidate  the  remaining  loans. She  said  that  she  applied  to  consolidate the loans in
February 2023 and that she was  awaiting terms for an  income-based repayment plan.
She submitted evidence that she had consolidated one loan with a principal balance of
$1,818 but had not yet made a payment, and that, as of May 2023, she had 10 federal
student loans with a total principal balance of $21,682. She also provided a June 2023
DoED  letter  acknowledging  receipt  of  her  request  “to  take  full  advantage  of  the  Fresh
Start  Initiative  and  have  [her]  defaulted  federal  student  loans  transferred  to  a  loan
servicer.” (GE 1 at 36: AE L; Tr. 55-56, 65-73, 89-91, 99-102)
SOR  ¶   1.v:  credit  account   past  due   in   the   amount   of   $2,496   with   a   total
balance  due of  $11,577. Applicant denied the allegation, said the account was current,
and that the remaining balance was $8,963. (Answer) She testified that she purchased a
vehicle in April 2017 but was unable to make all loan payments because her ex-fiancé
had taken her to court over child custody and support. She said and provided evidence
that her auto loan agreement was revised in August 2022, that she had made required
payments,  and  would  complete  all  payments  in  2024.  A  November  2021  credit  report
shows the account was at least 120 days past due, with a past due balance of $2,496
and total balance of $11,577. A June 2023 credit report shows the account as “not more
than two payments past due,” with a past due balance of $1,269, total balance of $3,428,
and payments from at least September 2022 through April 2023.  (GE 3 at 7, GE 2 at 11,
GE 6 at 3; AE A; Tr. 36-46) This debt is being resolved.
SOR  ¶   1.w:   credit  card  account   past  due   in  the   amount   of   $617.  Applicant
admitted the allegation and said the account was closed. (Answer)  Credit reports from
May 2021, November 2021 and June 2023 show the credit card account was opened in
November  2016,  closed  by  the  creditor,  more  than  120  or  180  days  past  due  with  a
balance of $617, and that this was her only credit card with the listed creditor. She testified
that she had paid the creditor $600 and was working to pay the remaining balance. She
provided evidence of a $623 payment in July 2021. (GE 3 at 9, GE 2 at 11, GE 6 at 14,
GE 4 at 1,9; Tr. 21-22, 77-78) I find for Applicant on this allegation.
SOR ¶  1.x: student  loan from her university  placed for collection of  $2,184.
Applicant admitted the allegation, stated that she was working with the creditor, and that
a recent report showed a balance of $1,830. (Answer) A May 2021 credit report shows
the  student  loan  assigned  in  August  2013  in  the  amount  of  $1,500  and  placed  for
collection of $2,184. (GE 3 at 3) Credit reports from November 2021 and June 2023 do
not  list  this  student  loan.  (GE  2,  GE  6)  Applicant  testified  that  she  had  not  made  any
payments  on  this  loan  since  2016,  but  had  been  communicating  with  the  creditor  to
establish  a  payment  plan.  She  said  that  she  could  obtain  and  submit  copies  of  her
communications  with  the  creditor  but  did  not  do  so.  After  the  hearing  she  submitted
documentary evidence that a consolidated, unsubsidized loan with a balance of $1,818
was placed with a federal student loan servicer, in forbearance and that there had been
no payments to the loan servicer. Applicant asserted this was the student loan from her
school in an annotation on the document she submitted. (Tr. 78-80; AE L)
SOR ¶¶  1.y-1.bb: medical  accounts  placed for collection of  $116;  $110; $110;
and $90.  Applicant denied  each  allegation  and  said  that she  had  paid each  debt  in full.
(Answer)  Credit reports from  May and  November 2021  show the  accounts  as assigned
from  June  2017  to  March  2019, and  as in collection  in the  amounts alleged  in  the  SOR.
(GE 3 at 5-6, GE 2 at 2) A June 2023  credit report does not list any of the accounts. (GE
6) She  provided documentary evidence  that she paid medical debts of $116  and  $110 in
July 2021. (GE 4  at 1, 10; Tr. 80)  I find  for applicant on these  allegations.
Applicant’s  gross  annual  income  has  steadily  increased  since  June  2016.  She
initially  earned  about  $51,000  annually  and  by  2021  her  salary  increased  to  about
$66,000.  In  January  2022,  she  was  promoted  to  her  current  position  and  earns  about
$82,000 annually. She receives child support payments of about $760 monthly, but not
consistently.  She  had  not  received  child  support  payments  from  March  2023  until  the
hearing  because  her  child’s  father  lost  his  job  and  was  seeking  to  decrease  his  child
support  payments  because  of  financial  hardship.  She  reported  a  remainder  of  about
$1,100 after monthly expenses. She said that that she maintains a written  budget and
would submit a copy but did not do so. She reported about $4,200 in her bank accounts
and estimated her retirement account balance at more than $50,000. (Answer; Tr. 53-55,
80-87, 94-97, 102-103; AE G)
Applicant submitted an email and letter stating that she was actively seeking the
guidance  and  assistance  of  a  named  and  qualified  financial  advisor  employed  by  her
credit union. She said that she was committed to working with the advisor to implement
effective strategies and achieve financial stability. (Tr. 72-73, 93-94; AE H, I)
Applicant  submitted  letters  of  recommendation  and  emails  from  colleagues  and
friends  that  favorably  commented  on  her  parenting  skills,  loyalty,  work  ethic  and
performance,  professionalism,  demeanor,  compliance  with  rules,  character,  and
suitability for a security clearance. (AE F)
