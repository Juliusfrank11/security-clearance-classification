In his Answer, Applicant admitted with explanation SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 2.b, and he
denied SOR ¶ 2.a. I have construed Applicant’s response to SOR ¶ 2.b as a denial of
that allegation. He is 35 years old. He married in 2009, divorced in 2018, and remarried
in 2019. He has a minor child. He graduated from high school in 2006 and  received a
professional degree from a vocational school in 2008. (Tr. at 7, 21-22; GE 1-2)
Applicant  served  in  the  National  Guard  from  July  2011  to  July  2017,  and  he
received  a  general  discharge  under  honorable  conditions.  He  has  worked  for  various
DOD contractors since 2016. He worked for a DOD contractor on a U.S. military base
overseas from January 2016 to September 2019, when he was terminated for cause, as
further discussed below. He was unemployed from October 2019 to January 2020.  As
of the date of the hearing, he has worked for his current employer since October 2022.
He  was  first  granted  a security  clearance  in approximately 2011.  (Tr.  at  5,  7-8,  22-26,
55; GE 1-2)
Applicant was accused of sexual harassment  for incidents that occurred  in May
2019,  and  he  was  barred  from  access  to  the  job  site  and  certain  military  installations
indefinitely because of the substantiated allegations. (SOR ¶ 1.a) A female soldier that
he  met  in  May  2019  while  working  for the above-mentioned  DOD contractor  overseas
on  a  U.S.  military  base,  whom  he  saw  two  or  three  days  a  week  through  work  and
considered a friend, alleged the following three sexual harassment claims: (1) when he
saw her at the post exchange, he walked up to her, ran his fingers through her hair, and
asked if he could remove her hair bun; (2) he asked her what she had purchased from a
women’s lingerie, clothing, and beauty store; and (3) he walked up behind her while at
work, touched her shoulder, and started to give her a massage. (Tr. at 26-33; GE 2-4)
Applicant  denied  these  allegations.  He acknowledged, in  the  third incident,  only
that he walked up behind the soldier at work and  touched her shoulder. He discussed
the sexual harassment allegations during his July 2020 background interview. He stated
in his Answer:
I  admit  that sexual harassment allegations were made against me and due
to  those  allegations[,]  I  was barred  [from]  access to  [military]  installations. I
was  never  formally  given   any  evidence   regarding   these   allegations.  This
incident  was not intended  to be  construed  as sexual harassment  and  I has
[sic]  also  denied  that  2  of  the  all[e]gations  happened  as  stated.  This  is the
only  time   I  have   ever   been   in   trouble  for  this  as  well  and   [it]   has  not
happened since.  (Tr. at 26-33; GE 2)
On August 21, 2019, Applicant was placed on paid administrative leave. He was
then placed on unpaid administrative leave on September 21, 2019. This was the only
time  he  had  ever  been  placed  on  administrative  leave,  and  he  did  not  view  it  as  a
suspension.  While  on  administrative  leave,  he  stated  that  he  was  brought  into  the
captain’s  office  due  to  an  investigation  into  the  soldier’s  claims,  and  he  provided  a
written  statement  in  response  to  her  allegations.  He  was  unaware  of  what  else  was
done during the investigation. (Tr. at 26-35, 39-45, 48-56; GE 3-4)
On   September  23,  2019,  Applicant   was  terminated   for  cause   due   to   sexual
harassment,   and   he   is  not  eligible   for   rehire.  (SOR  ¶   2.a;  GE   3-4)   He  acknowledged
receipt   of  an   October  2019   letter  from   the   installation   commanding   officer,  indefinitely
barring   him  access  to   the   job   site   and   certain  military   installations  because   of   the
substantiated   sexual  harassment   allegations.   An   April  2020   email   from   his  then-
employer’s  human  resources director  states:
[Applicant]  was accused  of sexual  harassment towards a  soldier.  A  formal
investigation   was  performed   by  the   government,   and   the   findings  were
that   [Applicant’s]   actions  were   in   violation   of   Army   Regulation   600-20,
Army  Command   Policy,  para.  7-5   and   Army   Sexual  Harassment/Assault
Response   and   Prevention   (SHARP)  Policy.   It   was  also   concerning   that
[Applicant]  was in a  building  to  which  he  did  not  have  authorized  access.
The  final recommendation  by the  investigating  officer was  for [Applicant’s]
Camp  . . . base access authorization to be revoked.  (Tr. at 34, 39; GE  3-4)
Applicant stated in his Answer, “I was unaware of being terminated/fired and not
eligible for rehire as I was only told that I was released from contract. So therefore[,] I
deny  knowing  that  I  was  terminated/fired  prior  to  my  video  interview.”  He  reiterated
these  sentiments  during  his  July  2020  background  interview  and  at  the  hearing.  He
stated that no-one informed him that he was suspended, and he was only asked to turn
his DOD Common Access Card into his site lead. He was not required to formally out-
process  and  return  to  the  United  States,  and  he  was  not  barred  from  all  installations
around  other  command  locations.  He  remained  in  country  until  early  2020,  when  he
returned to the United States to seek employment. (Tr. at 33-45, 48-56; GE 2, 4)
When Applicant completed his February 2020 SCA, in response to “Section 13A
- Employment  Activities,”  he  listed  his  January  2016  to  September  2019  employment
with the above-mentioned DOD contractor overseas, and he disclosed that he had been
“[r]eleased  from  contract”  by  this  employer  in  September  2019.  He  marked  “No”  in
response  to  two  questions  in  this  section  and  failed  to  disclose  for  this  listed
employment  that  information  as  set  forth  in  SOR  ¶  1.a.  (SOR  ¶  2.b)  Those  two
questions inquired:
Reason for Leaving Question
For  this   employment   have   any  of   the   following   happened   to   you   in   the
last seven  (7) years?

written  warning,  been  officially reprimanded, suspended, or disciplined  for
misconduct in  the workplace,  such  as a violation of security  policy?  (GE 1)
Applicant  stated  in  his  Answer,  “I  admit  to  choosing  No  on  this question  due  to
not knowing that I was fired from [this employment]. I was only told I was released from
contract.  This  was  an  honest  mistake  and  was  not  intentional.”  He  also  maintained,
during his July 2020 background interview and at the hearing, that he did not view his
placement on administrative leave as a suspension. (Tr. at 33-47, 49-50; GE 2, 4)
Applicant  had  no  previous  unfavorable  incidents,  and  he  has  not  had  any
unfavorable incidents since, to include with his current employer. He was not arrested or
charged  with  any  offense.  He  expressed  remorse  for  his  actions  and  stated  that  he
learned his lesson. His spouse is aware of the allegations. (Tr. at 26, 34, 47-48)
