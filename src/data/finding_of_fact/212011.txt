Applicant is a 57-year-old woman with three adult children. Although she is legally
married, she has been separated from her husband since September 2021, and they are
in the process of filing for a divorce. (Tr. 102)
Applicant  is  a   high   school  graduate   and   she   earned   an   associate   degree   in
business   administration   in  1999.  (Tr.   27)  Currently,  she   works  for  a   contractor  as  a
security specialist. (Tr. 44) She  has been  promoted  twice during  the  past six months. (Tr.
44) She has held a security clearance since 2014.  (Tr.14)
Since   2002,  financial  problems  have   compelled   Applicant  to   file  for  bankruptcy
protection    three    times.    Applicant’s  first  bout  with    financial  difficulties,  beginning    in  the
early 2000s,  occurred  when  her husband,  a  U.S. military member,  received  permanent
change  of station orders to  a  location  where  expenses such as housing  and  DOD  public
schooling  were  not provided, and there  was no  convenient access to  a  commissary. (Tr.
33)  Applicant, then  a  stay-at-home  mother, considered  taking  a  job  to  help  make  ends
meet.  (Tr. 35) However, this proved  untenable  as she  was pregnant with  her third  child
and  was pre-occupied  with  raising  the  two  older children. (Tr. 35) Subsequently, Applicant
and  her  husband  decided  to  file  for Chapter 7  bankruptcy protection. (GE  7)  On  May 7,
2002, the  bankruptcy judge  discharged  their  debt. The  amount of the  discharged  debt is
unknown from the record.
Applicant’s next bout of financial problems occurred approximately five years later
and was triggered  by marital problems when  her husband  “abandoned  [Applicant] and
[their] kids”  and began seeing another woman. (Tr. 36)  When her husband moved, he
stopped helping pay the bills. Furthermore, Applicant discovered that he had not been
using  the  base  housing  allowance  to  pay  the  rent,  and  that  they  were  three  months
behind. (Tr. 36) Although Applicant was working at this time, she again fell behind on the
bills. (Tr. 36)
Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in 2007. (GE 6) She included
$45,000  of  debt  in  the  bankruptcy  petition.  (GE  6  at  27)  Applicant  failed  to  make
bankruptcy payments, prompting the court to dismiss the petition in July 2008. (Tr. 37)
Subsequently, Applicant and her husband reconciled. (Tr. 37) At or about this time,
Applicant’s financial fortunes changed for the better, as she obtained a job as a general
manager of a major restaurant chain, and a part-time job working at a hospital. (Tr. 37)
The income from these jobs, together with the income of her husband, enabled Applicant
to satisfy her delinquent debts.
For  the  next  ten  years  Applicant’s  finances  remained  stable.  (Tr.  37)  Then,  in
approximately 2018, her husband lost his job. (Tr. 38, 76) Depressed, he struggled with
suicidal ideation, and stopped either looking for another job or helping pay the bills. (Tr.
38, 81) Their joint income decreased by $250,000, to $50,000 annually. (Tr. 88)
In September 2019, Applicant and her husband  filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy.
(GE 5) The petition included $97,291 of debt. (GE 5 at 32) Applicant’s financial situation
worsened further when her employer laid her off from the job the same month. (Tr. 99;
GE 1 at 12) Shortly thereafter, the bankruptcy court dismissed the bankruptcy petition.
(Tr. 98) Applicant remained unemployed for four months. (GE 1 at 13)
Applicant was  unemployed  through  February  2020.  (GE  8  at  1) In  2021,  she  and
her husband  again  separated. (Tr. 102)  In  September 2022, they sold their  house  for 1.1
million  dollars.  (Tr. 101) They had  originally purchased  it in 2016  for $800,000. (Tr.  79)
They netted  $140,000  which  they split.   (Tr. 104) Using  her share of the  profit from  the
sale of the  house, Applicant satisfied  all  of the  SOR debts,  alleged  in SOR subparagraphs
1.a  through  1.g,  and  made  an  agreement to satisfy the debt  as set forth below:

Currently, Applicant has $25,000 in savings. (Tr. 128) She keeps a budget and has
approximately $2,000 left over each month (Tr. 147) Also, she has less than $2,500 of
credit card debt, and  she  has no  automobile  car loan  debt.  Applicant remains separated
from  her husband  and  has initiated  divorce  proceedings. At the  conclusion  of the  divorce
proceedings,   she   anticipates   receiving   $1,000   per month   as   her share of her   husband’s
pension. (Tr. 145)
The  SOR alleges  that Applicant did  not disclose  her debts  that had  been  either
turned  over to  collection, suspended,  charged  off,  or  cancelled  in  the  past  seven  years,
as required,  on  a security clearance application  (SCA) completed in February 2020. She
admits   omitting   these   debts   from   her  SCA,  but  contends  that   the   omissions  were
unintentional.  She   explained   that   she   was  aware   that  the   debts   were   delinquent,   but
unaware   that  they  had   been   turned   over  for   collection,  suspended,  charged   off,  or
cancelled. Elsewhere  on  the  security clearance  application,  Applicant disclosed  her 2007
and  2019  bankruptcy  petition  filings, and   she  disclosed  financial  counseling  assistance
she   was   receiving   in  response   to   the   question,  “are    you    currently    utilizing    or  seeking
assistance  form  any  other similar resource to  resolve your financial difficulties.”  (GE 1  at
45)  She  elaborated  further that she   was   “negotiat[ing]   directly with   the   companies . . to
eliminate   all   [her] debts,”  and    that  she    had    “sent  letter[s]  to    the    companies  to    get  a[n]
accurate   balance   of  how  much   [she]  owes  .  .  .,”    and   that  she   had   contacted   credit
reporting agencies to  get copies of credit reports and  credit scores. (GE 1  at 45)
Applicant  has  been  working  at  her  current  job  since  September  2021.  (AE  K)
According to her supervisor, she “has exuded exceptional trustworthiness and dedication
in the performance of her duties.” (AE K)
