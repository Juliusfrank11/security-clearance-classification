Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations. She is 40 years old, married, and she
has one adult child and one minor child. She earned a bachelor’s degree in 2013, and a
master’s degree in 2015. She has lived with her family in a rental property in state A since
2019. (Tr. at 8, 22, 47-49; GE 1, 5)
Applicant  served  honorably  in  the  U.S.  military  from  2002  to  2008.  Due  to  her
attending  school  and  caring  for  her  children,  she  was  subsequently  unemployed  until
December 2014.  She then  worked  as  a  U.S.  Government  civilian  employee  overseas,
where her spouse was stationed as an active-duty military member, until April 2019. Due
to her recovery following a major surgery and her family’s relocation to the United States,
she  was  again  unemployed  until  December  2019.  Since  then,  she  has  remained
employed by various DOD contractors. She has worked for her current employer as an
information technology project manager since December 2022. She was first granted a
security clearance when she served in the U.S. military. (Tr. at 5, 9-10, 22-30, 49-51; GE
1, 5)
As of the  date  the  SOR was issued,  Applicant  had  three  credit-card  accounts  in
collection   status   (SOR   ¶¶     1.a,  1.b,   and   1.c),  in   the   amounts  of   $25,295,   $5,458,   and
$4,463, respectively. All  three  debts were reported  on  her 2021  and  2022  credit bureau
reports. Only  two  debts were  reported  on  her  2023  credit bureau  report, which  reflected
the   following   notations  for   each   debt:   (1)  “Consumer  Disputes   –   Reinvestigation   in
Progress”   for  SOR  ¶   1.a;  and   (2)  “Consumer  Disputes  –   Reinvestigation   in  Progress,
Charged Off Account,  Account Closed by Credit Grantor”  for SOR ¶  1.b.  (Answer;  GE  1-
5)
In her SCA, Applicant reported that all three credit-card accounts were charged off
due  to  nonpayment.  She  stated  that  she  stopped  making  monthly  payments  on  the
accounts after she reported all three credit cards as “lost or stolen” in May 2017. She also
stated  that  the  three  debts  resulted  from  unauthorized  charges  made  on  the  cards,  of
which  she  had  not  been  aware,  after  she  reported  them  lost  or  stolen.  During  her
November  2021  background  interview,  she  told  the  investigator  that  the  three  debts
resulted  from  the  unknown  and  unauthorized  charges  made  on  the  cards  after  she
reported them lost or stolen, and the high interest rates that continued to accrue on the
outstanding balances. She maintained that she did not learn about her delinquent credit
cards  until  approximately  May  2021.  In  her  Answer,  Applicant  asserted  that  the  three
debts resulted from her being a victim of identity theft. (Answer; Tr. at 35, 38-39; GE 1, 5)
At  the   hearing,   Applicant   stated   that   she   did   not   recall   providing   the   foregoing
information   to   the   investigator  during   her  November  2021   background   interview.  She
maintained  that she  lost her wallet, which  contained  the  three  credit cards and  her military
identification   card,   during   a   vacation   cruise   she   took   with   her  family   in  the   summer  of
2017. She  did not report her lost wallet to the  cruise ship  authorities because she  did  not
lose  it aboard the  ship.  She  did not think to  file a  police  report  with  the  local authorities.
She  did  not  immediately contact  her  creditors because  she  did  not  have  any  phone  or
internet  service  aboard  the  ship.  When  she  returned  from  vacation  less than  one  week
later, she  reported  her lost  wallet  and  military identification  card to  the  authorities on  the
U.S. military base  where she  resided. She  also  contacted  her creditors  to  report  her lost
wallet   and   close   the   accounts.   She   did  not  provide   documentation   to   corroborate   her
testimony. (Tr. at  30-43, 45-46, 49-69)
Applicant acknowledged  that all  three  credit  card  accounts  had  balances due  to
charges   she   made   before  she   lost   her   wallet.  She   claimed   that   she   continued   making
payments  toward  the  balances  she  incurred  on  all  three  accounts  after they were closed,
and  until they were  each  paid in  full. She  stopped  monitoring  the  three  accounts  once  she
believed   that  each   was  paid  in  full.  She   denied   any  knowledge   of  the   unauthorized
charges made  on  each  of the  credit cards after she  reported  them  lost,  in the  amounts of
$10,000, $3,500, and  $4,500, for SOR ¶¶  1.a, 1.b, and  1.c,  respectively. She  believed
that the  charges may have  gone  through  because  the  accounts were  not closed  when
she believed them  to  have been  closed.  The credit bureau  reports corroborated  that she
made  payments through  April 2018  and  August 2019  for the  accounts alleged  in  SOR ¶¶
1.a  and 1.b, respectively. (Tr. at  30-43, 45-46, 49-69)
At  the hearing, Applicant  attributed her lack of  knowledge about the  delinquent
accounts  to  having  not  received  any  correspondence  about  them  from  any  of  the
creditors, due, in large part, to her family’s relocation from their residence overseas to the
United States. Although she had been monitoring her credit using Credit Karma  for an
unspecified period, the three credit card accounts were not reported as delinquent until
about 2021 to 2022. She claimed that she had been working with the creditors and major
credit  reporting  agencies  to  settle  or  otherwise  resolve  these  debts  and  have  them
removed from her credit report. She also placed a security freeze on her credit reports.
(Answer; Tr. at 30-43, 45-46, 49-69; GE 1, 5)
Applicant also claimed that, in the summer of 2022, she began working with and
paying  $120  monthly  to  a  credit  counseling  company,  who  was  assisting  her  with
disputing the three debts and cleaning up her credit report. She maintained that, although
she had the financial means to settle and resolve these debts, she had not yet discussed
this  option  with  the  credit  counseling  company  as  of  the  date  of  the  hearing.  She
previously believed, based on her own research, as well as information told to her by the
credit counseling company, that she was not responsible for paying the three debts since
they had been charged off and would eventually fall off her credit report.  However, she
has since learned that she was mistaken in that belief and has accepted full responsibility
for repaying all three debts.
Applicant  provided  undated  documentation  reflecting  that  she  enrolled  all  three
debts into a debt relief program with another company. She agreed to pay $514 monthly,
from which the company would make payments  to settle these debts on her behalf by
June  2027,  with  the  projected  next  settlement  to  occur  between  December  2023  and
February 2024. She did not provide any documentary evidence that she had commenced
her  payments,  or  that  any  of  three  debts  had  yet  been  settled  or  otherwise  resolved
through the program. (Answer; Tr. at 30-43, 45-46, 49-69; GE 1-5; AE A)
As  of  the  date  of  the  hearing,  Applicant  earned  $135,000  annually.  She  also
received  $2,400  monthly  for  her  90%  disability  rating  from  the  U.S.  Department  of
Veterans Affairs. She had approximately $4,000 in her bank accounts and $20,000 in her
retirement  savings  account.  Her  spouse  expected  to  retire  from  the  U.S.  military  in
September 2023, after 23 years of service, and he intended to obtain employment in the
private sector. She estimated that he earned $100,000 annually. They maintain separate
finances,  but  they  share  responsibility  for paying  the  household  expenses.  She  stated
that the credit counseling company provided her with credit counseling. The credit reports
do not list any other delinquent debts. An individual who has known Applicant personally
and professionally for over 15 years, and for whom Applicant worked as a subcontractor
after her discharge from the U.S. military, attested to Applicant’s character, integrity, and
responsibility. (Tr. at 23-29, 44-49; GE 1, 5)
