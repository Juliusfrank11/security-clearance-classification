In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a through
1.d,  and  1.f,  and  he  denied  the  remaining  SOR  allegations.  (HE  3)  He  admitted  the
allegations in the Amended SOR. He also provided mitigating information. His admissions
are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings follow.

employed in addition to his employment by a contractor. (Id.) He has not served in the
military. (Id.) His resume and biography provide additional details about his background
and professional experience. (AE J; AE N)
For  many  years,  Applicant  was  an  elite  athlete  who  competed  in  international
competitions on behalf of the United States. (Tr. 18; AE L) As part of his sports career,
he  met  the  President and  First  Lady  at  the  White  House.  (AE  L; AE  M)  He  ended  his
competition in the sport three years ago. (Tr. 19)
In 2002, Applicant married, and in 2015, he was divorced. (Tr. 19; GE 1) One of
his children was born in 2002, and the other five children were born in 2006 (quintuplets).
(Tr. 20-21; GE 1; AE F; AE O) He has held a security clearance since 2009. (Tr. 71) He
has had access to a military base; however, he never had access to classified information.
(Tr. 26, 44, 71-72)
Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse and Criminal Conduct
Applicant said he  does  not currently use  illegal drugs. (Tr. 34, 42; AE  B; AE  M; AE
Q) He said he  ended  his use  of illegal drugs  when  he  was arrested  for driving  under the
influence of alcohol (DUI) in 2019. (Tr. 35)  He first used  marijuana  around 1994 or 1995.
(Tr. 75) In  March 1997, he  was  arrested  for  possession  of drug  paraphernalia.  (Tr. 73;
GE   2)   His  first  driving   under  the   influence   of  alcohol  arrest  was   in   1998.   (Tr.  75)  His
driver’s license  was suspended  for two  years. (Tr. 76) In  2000, he  received  a  ticket for
driving  with  a  suspended  driver’s license. (Tr. 76) In  2002, he  was arrested  for DUI,  and
he  pleaded  guilty to  negligent driving. (Tr. 77; GE  2) He said he  only used  marijuana  once
before 2005. (Tr. 74) Multiple  complaints and  allegations were  made  against  Applicant
from   2008   to   2016   from   a  neighbor,  church  members,   and   family  members   about  his
treatment of his former wife, children, or both;  however, none  of  the  complaints resulted
in  convictions.  (Tr.  78-85)  He  said   he   could  not  remember  half   of  his  arrests  and   “the
years all  run  together.”  (Tr. 77)  As  to  those  making  complaints  about  him,  he  said  “They’re
cop callers. They call them all the time  for nothing.” (Tr. 85)
Applicant had difficulty remembering dates of events and periods of sobriety. He
said,  “I have  no  recollection  of what year was what.  The  years, they’re  written  down.  I
could look at it and read them and know them. But that’s how I’d have to do it. If I’m just
picking it out of the air, out of the sky and trying to remember, I have no . . . recollection.”
(Tr. 98-99) The years were  “just a blur” to him. (Tr. 104) He said the SCAs are a good
source for dates of events. (Tr. 103)
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  Applicant  used marijuana with  varying  frequency  from about
April 2005 to about May 2020. He occasionally used marijuana during these timeframes.
(Tr. 28) When he was in international sports competitions, he refrained from marijuana
use for extended periods of times, sometimes for five to seven years. (Tr. 29) He said his
actual marijuana usage  was “very minimal.” (SOR response)  A June 1, 2017 Chemical
Dependency Assessment Summary (CDAS) states Applicant “reports smoking marijuana
for the first time at age 18. Recent use is described as a few puffs three times a week.
His last reported use was February 2017.” (GE 13 at 1)
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges Applicant used methamphetamine with varying frequency from
about April 2005 to about May 2020.  After his divorce in 2015, he was involved with a
woman  who  introduced  him  to  methamphetamine.  (Tr.  32-33,  106)  He  said  he  used
methamphetamine about two or three times. (Tr. 33, 107) He said the last time he used
methamphetamine was around the 2019 DUI arrest when methamphetamine were found
in  his  pocket.  (Tr.  107)  He  does  not  associate  with  the  woman  who  gave  him
methamphetamine. (Tr. 107)
SOR  ¶  1.c  alleges  Applicant  used  cocaine  with  varying  frequency  from  about
December 1993 to about December 1996. He admitted the alleged cocaine usage, and
said he  was not using cocaine  “with  any frequency.” (SOR response) He has not used
cocaine after 1996. (Tr. 42) A June 1, 2017 CDAS states Applicant “reports occasional
snorting cocaine in his 30’s.” (GE 13 at 1)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges Applicant was arrested in about September 2020 and charged
with DUI. SOR ¶ 1.e alleges Applicant tested positive on a urinalysis test in about May
2020 for marijuana, methamphetamine, and amphetamine. Department Counsel moved
to withdraw SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e because  more accurate  information was contained in
Amended SOR ¶ 2.b. (Tr. 112) Applicant did not object, and I granted the motion. (Tr.
112)
SOR  ¶  1.f  alleges  Applicant  used  amphetamine,  methamphetamine,  and
marijuana from about January 2018 to about May 2019 while granted access to classified
information.  He  admitted  the  SOR  allegation,  and  he  said,  “I’m  not  an  everyday  every
month  user.  I  was  hanging  around  the  wrong  person  and  made  bad  choices  on  two
occasions. (SOR response)
SOR  ¶  1.g  alleges  Applicant  received  alcohol  and  drug  counseling  from  about
September 2020, and he was diagnosed with alcohol use disorder in early remission and
cannabis  use  disorder  in  early  remission.  (Tr.  38;  GE  11  at  7)  He  received  inpatient
treatment for five or six weeks. (Tr. 30)
Applicant provided urine samples on September 15, 2020, and August 25, 2023,
which  tested  negative  for  the  use  of  illegal  drugs;  however,  he  may  have  received
advance  notice  of  the  tests.  There  was  no  evidence  presented  about  the  detection
windows  for  use  of  marijuana  and  methamphetamine  related  to  these  two  drug  tests.
(SOR response; AE M)
SOR ¶ 2.a alleges Applicant engaged in criminal conduct as alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a
through 1.f. He is not currently attending drug or alcohol counseling or therapy. (Tr. 105)
Amended SOR ¶ 2.b alleges that on or about May 20, 2019, Applicant was arrested
and charged with DUI. “The blood test taken incident to [his] arrest revealed the presence
of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), methamphetamine, and amphetamine[s]. [He] pled guilty
to a lesser offense and was placed on probation for two years.” (Amended SOR ¶ 2.b)
The police report for the May 20, 2019 arrest states that the police officer noticed
the smell of marijuana emanating from Applicant’s vehicle; Applicant was not alone in the
vehicle; he asked Applicant when he last smoke marijuana; and Applicant told the police
officer that he “ha[d] a few hits from a joint” about five hours earlier. (GE 8 at 2) Applicant
said  he  had  marijuana  inside  the  vehicle.  (Id.)  The  police  officer  asked  Applicant  how
often he smoked marijuana, and Applicant initially said he smoked weekly, and then he
clarified,  “he  smoked  nightly  before  bed.”  (Id.)  The  police  report  does  not  indicate
marijuana was found in his vehicle. (GE 8)
A September 2, 2020 progress note from his drug and alcohol treatment, states
that Applicant said he “smokes nightly” and “started out smoking weed on weekends then
smokes before bedtime.” (GE 11 at 2, 4) He also indicated he stopped using marijuana.
(GE 11) The treatment summary states:
[Applicant]  reports  smoking  marijuana  for  the  first  time  at  age  18,  and
became  a  regular  user  at  age  20  when  he  would  use  cannabis  on
weekends. He reports his cannabis use to have decreased in the past  10
years. His last reported use was in May 2019 when he would occasionally
use cannabis at nighttime for relaxing. (GE 11 at 6)
Applicant  agreed
the  May  20,  2019  blood
test  results  reflected  THC,
methamphetamine, and amphetamines. (Tr. 38) He tried some drugs shortly before the
arrest. (Tr. 40) He was unsure of the disposition of the charges or allegations. (Tr. 40)
After the successful completion of probation and an eight-hour defensive driving course,
the DUI charge was reduced to negligent driving. (SOR response; AE C; AE D)
Amended SOR ¶ 2.c alleges on about March 23, 2017, Applicant was “arrested for
and charged with two counts of Domestic Violence Assault, 4th degree. [He] entered into
a Pre-Trial Diversion Agreement.” Applicant’s children called their mother and complained
that Applicant was assaulting them. (Tr. 36-37; 45-51, 86-90) His former spouse and her
boyfriend arrived, and a physical altercation between Applicant and the boyfriend of his
former  spouse  and  Applicant’s  former  spouse  ensued.  (Id.)  Applicant  said  his  former
spouse’s boyfriend was the aggressor. (Id.) He accused his former spouse, her boyfriend,
and his children of lying about his behavior. (Id.) The police arrested Applicant. (Tr. 37)
When  the  police  searched  him,  they  found  methamphetamine  in  his  pocket.  (Tr.  47)
Applicant said his girlfriend put the methamphetamine in his pocket. (Tr. 47) He pleaded
guilty  to the two domestic  violence  charges  in  return for having the methamphetamine
charge  dismissed.  (Tr.  55)  He  entered  a  diversion  program.  (Tr.  55)  He  successfully
completed a one-year anger management program and a 10-week parenting class. (Tr.
55; AE E) He is on good terms with his former spouse and children. (Tr. 56)
Amended SOR ¶ 2.d alleges on about October 6, 2014, Applicant was “arrested
for contacting [his] ex-wife in violation of a no-contact order then in place.” Applicant said
he  was  assisting  his  daughter,  and  he  was  falsely  accused  of  violating  the  restraining
order. (Tr. 59-60) The charge was dismissed. (Tr. 58, 61) There is currently no restraining
order on Applicant. (Tr. 61)
Applicant said he   “will  never misuse   substances in   the   future.   This shall   include
use  or possession  of  any illegal  drug  or the  use  of a  legal  prescription  drug  without  a  valid
prescription   or  in  a   manner  inconsistent  with   their   intended   purpose.”  (AE   A)  He
“acknowledge[d]  that  any  future  involvement  or  misuse   is  grounds  for  revocation   of
national security eligibility.” (Id.)
Personal Conduct
Applicant said he filled out five SCAs from 2018 to 2022. (Tr. 62) However, only
two SCAs were admitted into evidence. (GE 1; GE 2) Applicant said he did not report his
involvement with illegal drugs on his SCAs because he hurried through the SCAs, and he
was complacent.  (Tr. 63) He revealed  his arrests to  security when  they occurred. (Tr. 64)
He believed  he  did  not need  to  disclose  information  that  was  previously disclosed.  (Tr.
64)  He said he  was honestly trying  to  disclose  accurate  information  on  his SCAs. (Tr. 65)
Amended  SOR ¶ 3.a  supersedes and  replaces SOR ¶¶  3.a, 3.b, and  3.c.  (Tr. 113)
Amended  SOR ¶  3.a  alleges Applicant falsified  material facts on  his September 30, 2020
SCA when  he  responded  to  the  following  question  in  Section  23  –  Illegal Use  of  Drugs  or
Drug Activity  as follows:
“In the last seven (7) years, have you illegally used any drugs or controlled
substances?  Use  of  a  drug  or  controlled  substance  includes  injecting,
snorting, inhaling, swallowing, experimenting with or otherwise consuming
any  drug  or  controlled  substance.”  [He]  answered:  “No,”  and  thereby
deliberately failed to disclose that information as set forth in [SOR ¶¶] 1.a
through 1.f. above.
In   his  September  30,   2020   SCA,   Applicant   disclosed   that   in   March  2017,  the   police
arrested   him   for  possession   of   methamphetamine   (one   count),   and   domestic  violence
assault in  the  4th  degree (two counts). (GE 1  at 34) In October 2017, he was found guilty
of  the   two  assaults.  (Id.) The  methamphetamine   charge   was  dismissed.   (Id. at  35) He
completed  two  years of  probation.  (Id.) In  May 2019, he  was arrested  for DUI,  and  he  was
pending   trial,  which  was  scheduled   for   October  2020.   (Id.   at   36)   However,  he   did   not
disclose  any  possession  and  use  of  illegal  drugs which  was  unrelated  to  the  charges in
law enforcement and court records. (Id. at 37-38)
Amended SOR ¶ 3.b alleges Applicant falsified material facts on his April 19, 2018
SCA when he responded to the following question in Section 23 – Illegal Use of Drugs or
Drug Activity as follows:
“In  the  last seven  (7) years, have  you  illegally used any drugs  or controlled
substances?   Use   of   a   drug   or  controlled   substance   includes  injecting,
snorting,  inhaling, swallowing, experimenting  with  or  otherwise consuming
any  drug   or  controlled   substance.”   [He]   answered:  “No,”  and   thereby
deliberately failed  to  disclose  that information  as set forth  in [SOR ¶¶] 1.a
through 1.f. above.
In his April 19, 2018 SCA, Applicant disclosed the March 2017, arrest, charges,
and disposition in October 2017, as indicated on his September 30, 2020 SCA, supra.
(GE 2 at 31-32) He disclosed the following criminal charges: his March 1997 possession
of drug paraphernalia charge and conviction; his April 1998 DUI charge and conviction;
and  his  April  2002  “DUI  Possible  paraphernalia”  charge,  which  resulted  in  a  reckless
driving  conviction.  (Id.  at  33-36) He  disclosed  treatment  for  “THC  (Such  as  marijuana,
weed, pot, hashish, etc.)” in January 2005. (Id. at 37) However, he did not disclose any
possession  and  use  of  illegal  drugs  which  was  unrelated  to  the  charges  in  law
enforcement and court records and the 2005 drug treatment records. (Id. at 36-37)
Amended SOR ¶ 3.c alleges Applicant falsified material facts in his responses to
DOHA  Interrogatories,  signed  by  him  on  August  9,  2022,  in  response  to  the  following
question:
“Have  you  EVER … illegally used  any  drugs or controlled  substances?  Use
includes  injecting,  snorting,  inhaling,   swallowing,  experimenting   with,  or
otherwise  consuming   any  drug   or  controlled   substance?”  [He]   answered
for
“Yes,”  but  deliberately  provided   only  partial  dates  of  use
methamphetamine   and   marijuana,  and   deliberately   omitted   [his]  use   of
amphetamines and cocaine.
Applicant  wrote  in  his  response  to  the  DOHA  interrogatory  about  his  history  of  drug
involvement that he used methamphetamine twice in October 2017, and marijuana four
times in May 2019. (Tr. 92; GE 4 at 4) At his hearing, he said he went through the DOHA
interrogatory quickly because he was trying to get the document completed. (Tr. 92-93)
He believed the government already had the information about his drug involvement. (Tr.
93, 96)
For the  falsification allegations, Applicant said, “[i]t’s not done  on  purpose. It’s not
trying to say that I didn’t do anything. I’ve said that I’ve done all of these things. I own up
to  them. I had  a  lapse  of judgment at these  times. I’ve  done  the  wrong  thing, you  know,
when  I’ve done  stuff that I shouldn’t have done. . . . I’m  not trying  to cover it up.” (Tr. 96-
97)
Character Evidence
Applicant loves his job, and he would like to continue in his current employment.
(Tr.  67,  111)  He  received  a  coin  and  a  letter  of  appreciation  from  his  employer  for
voluntarily working overtime, showing initiative. and resolving problems. (Tr. 67-69, 109;
AE P) He is trustworthy, reliable, and responsible. (Tr. 67) He does not believe he is a
risk to security. (Tr. 67)
Applicant provided 12 character statements from friends, family, and coworkers.
(SOR response; AE F; AE O) The general sense of their statements is that he is friendly,
hardworking, honest, and family oriented.
