Applicant is 48 years old, a high school graduate with some college credit credits.
He  was  married  in  March  2007  and  divorced  in  March  2015.  He  has  no  children.  He
served on active duty in the U.S. Army from 2003 to 2009 and in the inactive reserves
from  2009  to  2011.  He  was  honorably  discharged.  (Tr.  18-20.)  He  was  deployed  to
Afghanistan from March 2012 to October 2014, while employed by a defense contractor.
(Tr.  26.)  Since  August  2018,  he  has  worked  for  his  current  employer,  a  defense
contractor.  (GE  1.)  He  believes  his  security  clearance  expired  in  2014,  and  that  his
employment depends on him having a clearance. (Tr. 18-29.)
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant: (a) owes back federal income
taxes of $368,213 for tax years 2011 through 2015; (b) owes back state taxes of $15,000
(tax years are not alleged); and (c) owes the DOD $930. (SOR.) Applicant admitted those
allegations with explanations. (Answer.)
For SOR ¶ 1.a, his response is summarized as follows:
I admit. I made the initial mistake of not tracking my taxes during the
years  I  was  overseas.  To  address  the  issue,  I  started  working  with  a  tax
help company. That was in 2018. Up to that point, I hadn’t heard anything
from the  IRS. Once the  tax  company started  doing their initial inquiries,  I
was bombarded with letters from the IRS. I had no idea how badly the fees
and  interest  stacked  up.  Unfortunately,  between  how  tax  help  business
work,  the  slow  pace  of  the  IRS  and  the  onset  of  Covid,  this  is  still
unresolved. I have worked with a few different tax help companies, at one
point I retained a tax lawyer and finally I am working with a CPA who I feel
deals with me in an honest fashion. Over the last four years, I have agreed
to two separate payment arrangements with the IRS to where the money
would automatically be debited from my account and both times, no money
was debited and no contact was made in regards to updating the situation.
The [IRS] payment  arrangement in July 2020  was uploaded through the
tax  company  website  so  I  don’t  have  a  copy.  The  one  from  this  year
[January 2022] I will attach to this statement [the Answer].
I will readily admit that this has been the mistake of my lifetime. I will
continue working to fix this and for the last seven years have had my taxes
filed every year. I have increased my withholding on my initial forms for the
last seven years so nothing is added to what I owe . . . .
Attached to Applicant’s Answer is an Installment agreement signed by him dated
January 13, 2022, calling for a monthly payment of $2,250 beginning March 28, 2022. It
was not, however, countersigned or approved by the IRS. Applicant did not submit the
July 2020 payment arrangement with the IRS  mentioned above, because he could not
find it. (Tr. 59.)
Applicant’s testimony about SOR ¶ 1.a was consistent with his Answer about that
allegation. On September 20, 2018, he hired a tax help company (Company A), when he
discovered  how  bad  his  federal  tax  situation  had  gotten  while  he  was  overseas.  He
attributed  part  of  that  to  his  going  through  a  divorce  in  2014  to  2015.  Before  he  hired
Company A, he had not received any notices from the IRS. It was not until late 2018 or
early 2019 that he began receiving notices from the IRS. His agreement with Company A
was for him to pay the company $6,000 ($300 per month) plus a $28 per month fee in
installments for its assistance in resolving his federal tax issues.  Company A does not
handle state tax issues. (Tr. 33-40, 56; AE B.) His bank records show a total of $6,945
and  a  total  of  $588  in  fees  paid  to  Company  A  or  its  affiliates  from  September  2018
through February 2020. (AE A.) He never fired Company A and made all payments under
the agreement. (Tr. 61-62.) This contradicts later testimony that he fired Company A in
March 2022. (Tr.78.)
Applicant testified that Company A began filing his late returns in January 2019 for
tax years 2010 to 2018. (Tr. 39-41.) His tax transcripts show that his returns for tax years
2012 through 2015 were filed on March 25, 2019. His returns for tax years 2017 and 2016
were filed on January 7, 2019 and March 4, 2019, respectively. (GE 3.) On May 10, 2023,
he hired a new accountant (CPA B) who filed his 2021, 2022 taxes, and will file his 2023
taxes. (Tr. 78; AE I.)
Applicant’s exhibits AE D, E, F, G, and H, chronicle Applicant’s efforts from August
2019 to January 2022 to prod Company A, and in turn the IRS, to address his sizeable
tax delinquency.  The following are  salient excerpts from those exhibits  (quotations are
from Company A emails to Applicant):
“I was told [by IRS] that due  to  the  balance  ($338,301.53), it must be  assigned  to
a  Revenue  Officer.  This can  take  1-4  months.  The  good  news is,  collection  action  should
stop  while in this process.  It  also gives us time  to  get your financials  together so  we can
have  a plan when they call.” (AE D  8/24/19.)
“IRS  has had  longer delays in handling these [cases] over the last few months.”
(AE E 1/24/20.)
“The IRS has decided that they will take the next 90 days to assign you a Revenue
Officer.  During  this  time  they  have  placed  your  case  on  hold  and  will  not  pursue  any
further collection activity against you.” (AE F 11/24/20.)
“This  is  a  quick  email  to  let  you  know  that  we  have  not  yet  received  any
communication from the IRS assigning a Revenue Officer to your case. The good news
is that a HOLD has been placed on all potential activity against you while they assign this
person.” (AE G 2/23/21.)
“I contacted the IRS this past week because we have not yet seen any information
regarding the Revenue officer they are assigning to your case. Their response was that
they  have  not  yet  assigned  your  case  to  a  Revenue  officer  and  have  held  off  on  all
collection activity until they appoint an agent to you.” (AE G 4/11/21.)
“I have  attached the following form for your signature: IRS Form 433D –  Direct
Debit Form (Installment Agreement).  Please print, sign and either scan or fax the form
back to me at the fax number below.” (AE H 1/11/22.) This is the Installment Agreement
Applicant  signed  and  dated  on  January  20,  2022,  and  attached  to  his  Answer.  This
Installment Agreement is the last communication of record between him and the IRS via
Company A. The IRS has not yet approved or disapproved the Installment Agreement he
signed,  dated,  and  returned  to  Company  A  in  January  2022.  Nor  has  it  assigned  a
Revenue Officer.
Pending  a  response  from  the  IRS,  Applicant  has  filed  his  federal  income  taxes
through CPA B. He is current on all his federal income taxes through 2022. To be sure
that he is owed a refund each year, he does not take any exemptions or deductions he
could otherwise take. That way, he always has a refund that the IRS takes to apply to
back taxes. (Tr. 71-72.) CPA B has also advised him to do an offer in compromise, and
that is Applicant’s goal now, while awaiting the IRS to act on his January 2022 Installment
Agreement or assign a Revenue Officer. .
For SOR ¶ 1.b, his delinquent state tax of $15,000, Applicant responded: “This is
the  same situation as subparagraph a. In order to make a payment arrangement with the
State . . . , I’ve been advised to work with the IRS first as it takes precedence.” (Answer.)
Applicant testified that he spoke with a tax preparer in that State who calculated
that Applicant owed $15,000 for tax years 2010 to 2015. He filed those returns in 2020.
He was advised by Company A that he should wait until the IRS issue has been resolved
before paying the state taxes. (Tr. 74-75.) His plan is to work on an offer in compromise
with the IRS, and if that gets resolved, do a payment plan with the State. The $15,000 is
something he can afford. He is not opposed to paying the State first, but that is not what
his financial advisors told him. Even the State told him to take care of the IRS first. (Tr.
76-77.)
For SOR ¶ 1.c, a debt to DOD for $930, Applicant responded: “I’m not exactly sure
but I think it’s for a set of body armor that I signed for when I first deployed to Afghanistan
in 2010 as a civilian contractor. When I tried to turn it back in, it was at a different location
and the CIF [Central Issuing Facility] refused to take it as it wasn’t signed out from that
location.  I  still  have  the  armor  packed  and  cleaned  and  ready  to  turn  in.”  (Answer.)
Applicant’s testimony was consistent with his Answer. This happened about 10 years ago.
He has no contacts in the United States to return the gear to. (Tr. 79-84.) The credit report
does not provide a name or a phone number for the collection agency, just an address.
The creditor is DOD. The debt was assigned to collections in February 2012. (GE 4.)
Applicant testified about his personal finances. He reviewed his Personal Financial
Statement (PFS) (GE 3) and thought it was about accurate. (Tr. 86.) His PFS had a net
monthly remainder of $1,535. (GE 3.) His testimony updated that to $1,134. (Tr. 89.) His
job ($6,000 per month) and a Veterans Administration payment ($150 per month) are his
only sources of income. (Tr. 84-85.) He has not taken any vacation since perhaps 2013.
(Tr. 99.) He has no savings account. (Tr. 90-91.) He uses his checking accounts to pay
rent and other expenses. At the end of the month, those accounts are about $300 to $400
for expenses and $150 for rent. (Tr. $90-91.) His employer deposits $1.00 per month into
a 401 (k); he has never chosen one or filled out any paperwork for one. (Tr. 90.)
Given  Applicant’s  monthly net  remainder of  $1,134,  Department  Counsel  asked
whether  even  if  he  had  an  IRS  installment  plan  like  the  January  2022  proposed  plan
(calling  for  $2,250  per  month),  it  was  not  his  intention  to  make  those  payments.  He
responded:
No,  it  was  my  absolute  intention  to  make  those  payments.  I  told
Company A that . . . I can’t keep this up. I mean, I’m going to keep it up for
as  long  as  I  can,  but  at  some  point  the  wheels  are  going  to  fall  off.  .  .
Company A said let go of all my external payments . . . don’t pay your credit
cards . . . don’t pay your storage . . . don’t pay your medical expenses . . .
everything  outside  of  like  rent  and  food  .  .  .  goes  to  the  IRS  .  .  .  [That]
wouldn’t  have  been  sustainable,  because  that  wouldn’t  be  good  for  a
clearance. I mean, it’s the same thing, I’d still be hurting somewhere else.
(Tr. 95-96.)
Applicant clarified Company A’s role. He hired them to file his late federal returns.
They helped him file those returns. He did not hire them to pay his debt to the IRS. He
did not hire them to handle his state taxes. (Tr.104-105.)
Law and Policies
It  is  well  established  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.  As  the
Supreme  Court  held,  “the  clearly  consistent  standard
that  security
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.” Department of the Navy
v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).
indicates
When  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability
for  a  security  clearance,  an
administrative  judge  must  consider  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  These  guidelines  are
flexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the
whole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable
information  about  the  person,  past and  present,  favorable and  unfavorable, in making  a
decision.  The   protection   of   the   national  security  is  the   paramount   consideration.   AG  ¶
¶2(b)  requires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning   personnel  being   considered   for  national
security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.”
Under  Directive  ¶   E3.1.14,   the   Government   must  present  evidence   to   establish
controverted  facts alleged  in  the  SOR. Under Directive ¶  E3.1.15,  then  the  applicant  is
responsible  for presenting  “witnesses and  other evidence  to  rebut,  explain, extenuate, or
mitigate  facts admitted  by applicant or proven  by Department Counsel . . . .” The  applicant
has the  ultimate  burden of persuasion in seeking a  favorable security decision.
