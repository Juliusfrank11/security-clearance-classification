Applicant, age 45, is married with three children, ages 16, 12, and 8. He earned a
bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering in May 2000, and a master’s degree in control
systems in May 2003. He was initially granted a DOD security clearance in July 2000, in
connection his first employer, one of only two employers since he graduated college. He
has been employed as an engineer by his sponsor since July 2005. (GE 1; Tr. at 7, 24,
65)
Indebtedness History
Applicant  accrued  the  SOR  debts  after  discharging  previous  debts  through
bankruptcy. He filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in 2009, to get a handle on his
finances,  which  had  become  strained  by  an  interest  rate  increase  on  his  underwater
mortgage. After completing the Chapter 13 repayment plan, his debts were discharged in
2014. The SOR debts arose between about 2015 and 2020, when his finances became
overextended again due to changes in his wife’s employment status and income, the birth
of his third child, a cross-country move, and the COVID-19 pandemic. (Answer; GE 7 at
2; Tr. at 25-29, 33-34, 46, 70, 73)
While  Applicant  attributed  his  indebtedness  history  primarily  to  circumstances
beyond  his  control,  he  accepted  responsibly  for  the  role  that  overspending  without  a
savings buffer played. He believes that his financial problems originated with his “naïve”
decision to purchase his first home, in an area with a higher cost of living, and a new car,
immediately  upon  becoming  married  and  gainfully  employed  in  July  2005.  He  neither
understood the uncertainties of the housing market nor considered other “what-ifs” that
might occur. He and his wife were lulled into a false sense of security when they were
both gainfully employed, which influenced their debt accumulation and spending habits.
Their  incomes  afforded  a  certain  lifestyle  to  which  they  became  accustomed.  As
circumstances changed, they began living beyond their means attempting to maintain that
lifestyle. He incurred the $7,446 veterinarian bill alleged in  SOR ¶ 1.b by attempting to
prolong the life of their family dog after it was diagnosed with cancer. (Answer; GE 7 at 2;
Tr. at 15, 25-27, 28, 33-34, 38-39, 45, 46, 53, 73, 89)
Applicant purchased his first home in 2005, during the “sub-prime housing boom.”
He obtained a mortgage loan with a “low down payment.” When the mortgage’s interest
rate increased in 2009, the balance on the loan exceeded its fair market value by about
$80,000, due to  the housing  market  “crash.”  To avoid defaulting on  his mortgage loan
and other debts, he consulted a bankruptcy attorney to explore his options and borrowed
“some money” from his retirement account. In June 2009, he decided to file a Chapter 13
bankruptcy, and not a Chapter 7, because he wanted to honor his debt obligations. His
Chapter 13 repayment plan was confirmed in August 2009. His debts were discharged in
August 2014, after he successfully completed the repayment plan with payments totaling
$9,000. (GE 1 at 33; GE 6; GE 7 at 2; GE 8 at 4-5; Tr. at 25, 27-29)
The  bankruptcy  allowed  Applicant  to  maintain  his  mortgage  payments  until
November 2012, when he relocated from State A to State B. He could not afford to make
both  the  rental  payment  for  his  new  State  B  home  and  the  mortgage  payment  for  the
State  A  home.  Because  his  mortgage  remained  underwater  by  about  $75,000,  his
attempts to rent or sell the State A home were unsuccessful. The lender foreclosed on
his  mortgage  loan  in  about  February  2013.  The  record  did  not  reflect  any  deficiency
balance owed after the lender resold the home. (GE 1 at 33; GE 7 at 2; GE 8 at 4-5; Tr.
at 25, 27-28)
Despite  the  higher cost  of  living  in  State B,  Applicant  and  his wife were  able  to
maintain their lifestyle “without too much trouble,” since they both had “stable, well-paying
jobs.”  However,  they began  to  struggle  financially again  on a  date  not  specified  in  the
record, when his wife’s employer underwent new management, who changed the terms
of her employment.  His wife worked in the spa industry.  Under her original terms, she
earned a salary as an independent contractor and paid a rental fee for her workspace.
Under  her  new  terms,  she  earned  a  commission-based  salary,  which  resulted  in  a
“sizeable decrease” in her monthly income. After struggling to make ends meet with her
reduced  salary  for  an  unspecified  period,  he  and  his  wife  decided  that  it  was  in  their
family’s best interest for her to become self-employed. Self-employment allowed her to
reduce her expenses by not having to pay the rental fee, and to have a flexible schedule
to care for their children. Although her self-employment income was lower than what she
earned as an independent contractor, it was higher than her commission-based salary
and sufficient to meet their needs until October 2015, when complications arose with the
birth of their son. (Answer)
Applicant’s son was born with a medical condition, for which he was hospitalized
for “multiple weeks” following his birth, and again for “multiple weeks” shortly after his first
birthday.  Not  only  did  they  incur  medical  expenses  that  were  not  fully  covered  by
insurance, but their son’s medical condition precluded him from attending daycare, which
precluded his wife from working outside the home. Considering these issues together with
the rising cost of living in State B, Applicant and his wife decided to engage the services
of a debt-relief company (DRC) to consolidate their monthly debt payments before any of
them became delinquent. At that time, Applicant believed that a “big company with legal
backing” could better represent his interests in negotiating settlements than he could do
on his own. In hindsight, he learned a “valuable, if not hard lesson” that he may have been
better served by working directly with his creditors. His son’s medical condition eventually
improved  and  he  suffered  no  “long-lasting”  health  effects.  As  of  the  hearing,  his  son’s
health was “good.” (Answer; Tr. at 31-32, 37, 70-72)
Debt Repayment History (through DRC)
The DRC required Applicant to stop making all monthly debt payments and allow
his  debts  to  fall  into  delinquent  status  to  facilitate  its  settlement  negotiations  with  his
creditors.  He  was  also  required  to  make  bi-weekly  payments  to  the  DRC  of  $657
beginning in June 2018, which increased to $1,314 in September 2018, then $1,382 in
December 2018,  and  then  decreased  to  $1,089  as  of  October 2019  (DRC payments).
The DRC allocated a portion of the DRC payments to its fees, and then deposited the
remainder  into  an  account  from  which  it  could  pay  the  settlements  it  negotiated  with
Applicant’s creditors. (Answer; AE B; Tr. at 20, 32-36, 60, 72)
Applicant  struggled  to  pay  the  DRC  payments  at  times,  particularly  after  June
2019, when he relocated from State B back to State A to secure his employment. He and
his wife decided that she would not return to the workforce until the fall of 2019, so that
she  could  be  home  full  time  with  their  children  over  the  summer.  However,  once  they
realized that her anticipated salary would “just cover the cost of childcare,” they decided
that  her  return  to  work  “seemed  foolish.”  His  wife’s  unemployment  during  this  period
further strained their finances. As a result, in about January 2020, Applicant “cut ties” with
the DRC because he could no longer afford to make the DRC payments. (Answer; AE B;
Tr. at 32-36)
Applicant  made  20  DRC  payments  totaling  $17,887  from  June  2018  through
December 2019.  He  recalled  that the  DRC applied  the  DRC  payments  to fully  resolve
three  unalleged  debts  and  make  payments  toward  resolving  other  debts  for  which  the
DRC  had  negotiated  settlements.  The  other  debts  he  managed  through  the  DRC
included:  (1)  “probably  a  handful”  of  the  SOR  debts,  including  SOR  ¶  1.a;  and  (2)  an
unalleged  $7,304  loan  account.  As  reflected  in  the  table  below,  Applicant  provided
documents showing the amounts paid to the creditors of the three unalleged debts and
the associated fees collected by the DRC, which totaled $6,976. (Answer; AE B; Tr. at

The record contains scant details about the other debts Applicant was managing
through the DRC.  He did not provide  a  copy of the agreement he signed or any other
documents or information regarding the other debts sufficient to establish the terms of the
negotiated  settlements,  the  amounts  paid  to  the  creditors  pursuant  thereto,  or  the
associated fees collected by the DRC. Moreover, he did not otherwise account for how
the DRC allocated the remaining  $10,911 portion of the DRC payments toward paying
the other debts. He only generally referenced the status of the other debts as of the date
he terminated the DRC’s services  by stating: (1) the  debt in SOR ¶  1.a  was “close” to
being settled in full; (2) the DRC “didn’t owe” him “any money” because they “were paying
on my behalf” and “paid my debt down” a little bit. (Answer; Tr. at 32-36)
Debt Repayment History (Post-DRC)
Upon  terminating  the  DRC’s  services,  Applicant  lost  all  the  benefits  of  the
settlements the DRC negotiated for the other debts, including the credits applied for the
payments  made  pursuant  thereto.  Because  his  creditors  revoked  the  settlements  and
reinstated the original balances owed, he had to restart settlement negotiations on the
other debts “from  scratch.”  Initially, Applicant found  it “difficult” to  negotiate  settlements
on his own behalf while he remained the sole income earner for his family. (Answer; AE
B, C; Tr. at 54, 79)
The COVID-19 pandemic further delayed his wife’s return to the workforce not only
because she was solely responsible for homeschooling their children, but also because
it  negatively  impacted  the  spa  industry.  She  was  not  able  to  return  to  work  until  the
COVID-19  pandemic  “began  showing  signs  of  letting  up.”  Applicant’s  wife  returned  to
work part time sometime in the late fall or winter of 2021, when she unsuccessfully tried
to work for a friend’s business. However, she did not begin “drawing some form of income”
until March 2022, when she became self-employed again in a related but different industry
than she worked previously. His wife only works part-time “mom’s hours” (about four to
six hours per day) so that she can be home with their children when they are not in school.
(Answer; AE B, C; Tr. at 54, 79)
Before  his  wife’s  return  to  work,  Applicant  was  able  to  resolve  three  additional
unalleged debts, as reflected in the table below.

Since the addition of his wife’s income, Applicant has had the “flexibility” to make
“slow  and  steady”  progress  in  negotiating  settlements  and  making  payments  toward
resolving  the  SOR  debts.  (Answer; Tr.  at 21)  As  of the date  of  the  SOR, 12  of  the  15
alleged  debts,  totaling  $52,399,  remained  unresolved.  In  his  Answer,  Applicant  stated
that  he  had  been  in  contact  with  the  creditors  of  the  remaining  12  debts  to  negotiate

At the  hearing, Applicant reported  that the  only other delinquent debts he  incurred
besides   those   alleged   in  the   SOR  and   otherwise   mentioned   were   delinquent   taxes  he
owed to  State B  at various times. He  attributed those  taxes  to  the extraordinary amounts
he   owed   initially  due   to   changes  in  his  wife’s  employment  status,   and   then   to   his
increasing   income   bracket.   Without  specifying   either   the   tax  years  involved   or  the
amounts  owed, he  stated  that he  resolved  all  but one  $4,500  tax bill via payment plans
he  negotiated  with  State  B. Although  he  could  not recall  the  specific tax year to  which  the
$4,500  tax bill related,  he  believed  it was one  of the  last  tax years (sometime  between
2017  and  2019) before  he  relocated  back to  State  A.  He attributed  his delays  in paying
the  State  B  taxes to  “some  missteps, and  then  things  outside  of  our  control happened.”
He  described  his tax payment   history to   State  B   as   “another contributor”   to   his overall
indebtedness.  He   has   not  had   any   post-bankruptcy  delinquent  federal  tax  debt.  He
received  a  federal tax  refund  of  “about  $1,000” for tax year 2022,  because  he  keeps  his
exemptions from  withholdings  “pretty  low.”  (GE  6  at 2;  AE  B  at  2, 13-14;  AE  C at  2,  11;
Tr. at 30-31, 62-63, 77, 78)
On September 23, 2022, State B accepted his request to repay his final $4,500 tax
bill via 12 monthly payments of $375, beginning in October 2022. He remained current
with  those  payments  through  October  2023.  However,  he  owed  one  more  payment  in
November 2023, because his August 2023 payment was not processed due to an error
by State B. (AE B at 2, 13-14; AE C at 2, 11; Tr. at 30-31, 62-63)
At the hearing, Applicant explained his debt repayment strategy as follows:
I started from the top and worked my way down. Some of them are more
willing to come to agreements that benefit both parties than other ones. And
then I also tried to maybe hit on some of the smaller debts first because I
wanted to get through the progress, take care of those, and then work my
way up. But there really wasn't any one [sic]-- none of these are priority over
the  others,  because  they're  all  the  debt  I  owe  and  hey  all  needed  to  be
addressed. It was really just the order -- I started at the top, and whoever
was  -- whoever was  going  to  work  with me. Ones  that  wanted  $500  and
$600 a month payments, I had to wait until I had settled some of the other
ones financially, just -- $500 payments, it can be a strain. (Tr. at 69-70, 79)
After the hearing, Applicant reiterated his commitment to resolving his remaining
delinquent debts. He anticipated that once he completed repaying his State B taxes and
the debts alleged in SOR  ¶¶ 1.a. and 1.f, he would  have  the  “the  flexibility to  be  more
aggressive” with his repayment plan payments as well as begin to start repaying the debts
alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d. (AE C at 2)
Financial Information
Applicant is the primary wage earner for his family. He attributed the progress he
has made in resolving his delinquent debts to his salary increases and the addition of his
wife’s  consistent income since March 2022. He estimated that his gross annual salary
was about $80,000, upon his hire in 2005. He had been earning about $60,000 with his
former employer, which he considered at the time to be a “bigger” salary increase than it
was in hindsight. (Tr. at 65-67).
In  February  2021,  Applicant  reported  his  gross  annual  salary  as  $135,000,  net
monthly  salary  as  $6,500,  and  net  monthly  remainder  as  $400.  He  also  expected  to
receive  a  $12,000  bonus  at  the  end  of  2021.  However,  at  the  hearing,  he  explained,
“That's pre-tax, obviously. It gets thrown into a check, and it looks like you made a million
dollars a year. That $12,000 goes away real fast.” His “bonuses have actually gone down
for three straight years.”  He recalled that his 2022 gross bonus was about $8,000. He
recollected  that  he  “probably  earmarked”  both  his  2021  and  2022  bonuses  toward
repaying debts and increasing his savings. (GE 7 at 4-5; Tr. at 74-75, 76)
“About two months” prior to the hearing, Applicant received an increase in his gross
annual  salary  to  between  approximately  $160,000  and  $165,000.  He  also  received  a
“bump” in salary of about $400 per paycheck while he worked on a long-term assignment
for his employer in State C for about a year between 2022 and 2023. He estimated that
his  wife  has  earned  a  gross  annual  salary of  about  $20,000  since  about  March  2022,
which he calculated based on her receiving “about $400 a week, roughly.” However, he
acknowledged that, because she only works “about 20 hours or so” per week, “$400 might
be a bit high.” After the hearing, Applicant reported his and his wife’s monthly net income
as $7,790 and $1,500, respectively. He also reported a net remainder of $126, after he
made reported monthly payments totaling $2,164 toward his delinquent debts. There is
no information in the record about their prior income history.  (Tr. at 5, 54-55, 65, 78-81)
At the hearing, Applicant advised that he planned to investigate the status of a new
$7,304 collection account that caught his attention when he reviewed a June 2023 CBR,
which was provided to him a week before the hearing. He was not able to do so prior to
the hearing. After the hearing, he confirmed that the new collection account related to an
old debt, the unalleged $7,304 loan account he previously managed through the DRC, as
discussed above. After negotiating with the creditor for “a couple of months,” he finalized
a settlement agreement on November 15, 2023, reducing the balance owed to $4,650, to
be paid via 31 monthly payments of $150, beginning in December 2023. He learned that
the DRC did not provide the creditor with his correct contact information, which is one
reason why he forgot about the debt. The other reason is that the debt never appeared
on any of the credit reports he reviewed. The June 2023 CBR was prepared by a different
credit bureau  agency than  the  one  whose  reports he  regularly monitors. (AE  C at 2, 12-
13; Tr. at 43, 81-82)
All  accounts  were  reported  in  good  standing  on  Applicant’s  June  2023  CBR.
Although he continued to rely on consumer credit to meet expenses, he was current with
his monthly payments and had not incurred any new delinquent debts. He actively uses
only two personal credit cards to  “rebuild  credit,” on  which  he  pays the  balances in  full
each month. Both cards have credit limits of $300. He opened one in June 2017, and the
other in April 2023. He carries balances on only two other accounts, on which he timely
makes the required monthly payments, including: (1) a personal loan he opened in May
2023 to pay for hospital fees totaling about $8,500, which were not fully covered by his
insurance because he incurred them while he was working in State C; and (2) a vehicle
loan he refinanced in August 2021 to lower his monthly payment. He chose to use the
consumer loan  to  pay his medical debts because  the  loan  terms “made  sense” to  him,
and to avoid delaying payment to the medical facility.  The monthly payments on those
two loans are $298 and $325, respectively. (GE 9; Tr. at 45, 46, 51, 82-86)
Since the time they began working with the DRC, Applicant and his wife have been
operating  as  a  primarily  “cash  family,”  with  the  exceptions  noted  above.  For  an
unspecified  period,  he  has  been  setting  aside  funds  from  his  paychecks,  in  various
amounts, to accumulate savings for “some financial cushion to agree to the settlements
with  multiple  [creditors]  concurrently.”  As  of  the  hearing,  he  was  allocating  $350  per
paycheck to his savings account. He had a savings account balance of “about $1,800,”
and a retirement account balance of “about $40,000.” He has not been able to save “as
much  as  [he]  should  or  would  like  to,”  because  he  has  been  prioritizing  repaying  his
delinquent debts. He borrowed an unspecified amount from his retirement account to help
him refinance his vehicle, as previously discussed, which he is repaying via an automatic
$175 deduction from each paycheck. (Tr. at 20, 45, 52, 57-58, 75-76)
Whole Person
Applicant has ascended to the role of a senior principal engineer in the nearly 18
years that he has been working for his current employer. He currently manages a team
of 19 people. He has never committed a security clearance violation during his 23 years
as a  “cleared  employee,”  including the years when he worked for his former employer.
He understands the importance managing his finances responsibly. He and his wife are
in a “much better head  space and financial place now than five years ago.”  When they
engaged the services of  the DRC, they began implementing lifestyle changes to avoid
future indebtedness, including substantially reducing their credit-card use, as indicated
above. He chose to work in State C, and to live there alone and away from his family for
a year, to avail himself of an opportunity to make extra money to “really attack” his debt
repayment efforts. Neither he nor his family have not taken a vacation “in recent history.”
He learned a lesson from his experience with the veterinarian bill alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b,
and has not incurred any similar debts, including for two subsequent family dogs who also
passed away from cancer. (Answer; GE 7 at 2; Tr. at 15, 25-27, 28, 33-34, 38-39, 45, 46,

Applicant has sought out resources to improve his financial literacy, which is how
he  learned  about  using  credit  cards  to  rebuild  credit.  Because  Applicant  has  not
undergone  any  financial  counseling  in  the  past  10  years  (since  his  Chapter  13
bankruptcy), he expressed an interest in pursuing financial counseling again to continue
learning “best practices” for managing his finances. (Tr. at 53-54, 83-84)
Upon reflection of his financial situation  at the hearing, Applicant acknowledged
and opined,
I  said  it  before,  there's  some  responsibility  there.  I  will  not  run  from  that.
That's  a  fact. You don't  accumulate  this without  a bit  of that.  There  were
some  circumstances  out  of  my  control,  but  again,  my  responsibility  to
probably keep things managed so if things out of my control do happen, I
don't succumb to them. (Tr. at 53)
I'd like to think if COVID didn't happen and my wife resumed working when
we moved back to the east coast, these would have been paid or in progress
before  [they  became  a  security  concern].  COVID  did  happen.  Nothing  I
could change about that. So I can't really change the history. I can just show
the efforts I've made over the  last year that kind of aligned with [my wife]
going back to work, which is sort of, we're thinking, for the family. A single-
income family is tricky to support a family of five. (Tr. at 53)
It's rather embarrassing,  quite  frankly, to have  the education I do and be
able to some of the technical work but then . . . having issues with my own
personal  finances.  I'd  hope  that  I'd  shown  that  with  the  wherewithal
financially in my household to address these debts in an expedient manner
I've done so. I understand that there's still some left, and there's still some
concerns we're trying to address. . . And this was a lapse in judgment for a
protracted period of time or prolonged. I will not dismiss that. Things were
in my control that led me to being in a spot where occurrences out of my
control put me in this spot. (Tr. at 89)
