Applicant is 34 years old and unmarried. She graduated from high school in 2010
and attended college from 2015 to 2017. (Item 1 at 12) She did not graduate from college.
Applicant  has  been  working  as  a  senior  security  analyst  for  the  federal  contractor
sponsoring her clearance since June 2021. (Item 2 at 12)
The  SOR alleges 15  collection  accounts totaling  $37,049. Thirteen  of  the  accounts
are federal student loans. By January 2023, Applicant had  brought six of the  accounts,
as  alleged   in  subparagraphs  1.a,  1.e,  1.g,  1.i,  1.j,  and   1.k,   into   current  status  with
payments   made   after   the   issuance   of  the   SOR.   (Item   2   at  4-9)   The   amount  of  these
payments  are unknown from  the  record.  As for the  remaining  debts, she  contends that
she  is working  with  the  creditors set forth  in subparagraphs 1.b  through  1.d, 1.f,  and  1.h
to  lower the  loan  balances, and  she  is paying  down the  debts alleged  in subparagraphs
1.l through  1.o. (Item  2  at 4-9) She  did  not  support her  contentions with  substantiating
evidence.
Applicant was unemployed from December 2019 to May 2020. (Item 7 at 2) During
this time, she supported herself with savings. (Item 7 at 2) In May of 2021, she submitted
a budget as part of the investigative process, in which she reported approximately $2,780
of monthly discretionary income. (Item 7 at 6) She did not proffer information about her
relevant income or expenses prior to May 2021, nor did she indicate the reason that she
did  not  make  any  payments  toward  her  delinquent  debts  before  December  2019  or
between May 2021 and January 2023. During an investigative interview in October 2021,
she contended that she retained a credit repair agency to help her resolve the delinquent
student loans. (Item 7 at 5) However, she did not support her contention with a copy of
the retainer agreement, or otherwise establish which debts that the credit repair agency
has  been  helping  her to  resolve,  or the  status  of  any  progress  made  toward  resolving
them.  Moreover,  Applicant  did  not  respond  to  the  FORM,  so  she  did  not  provide  any
updated information about her debts or her finances.
