Having   thoroughly  considered   the   evidence   in   the   record,   including   Applicant's
admissions, I make  the  following  findings of fact:  Applicant is a  31-year-old employee  of
a  DOD contractor who  has worked  for his employer since  March  2022. His  job  title  is web
developer.  He   is   unmarried   and   does   not  have   any   children.  His  annual  salary  is
approximately $70,000. This is his  first application  for a DOD security clearance.  (Tr.  19-
21; GE 1)
Financial Considerations
Applicant  explained  that  he  first  began  to  experience  financial  issues  while
attending a community college from 2012 to 2015. He was living with his mother at the
time and had  no  income.  Although  he  obtained  U.S.  Department of  Education  student
loans to help pay his tuition, he had to drop out of college because he could not afford to
continue his education. In 2016, he started working for a company making approximately
$22,000 a year. He enrolled into another college in 2016, and he had to drop out in 2019
due  to  a  serious  medical  issue.  He  went  into  a  diabetic  coma,  and  in  2019  his doctor
diagnosed him with diabetic neuropathy. Applicant had to recover at home, and he was
authorized a nurse aid to help care for him. He was unemployed from 2019 to early 2022,
and  he  did  not  receive  any  disability  income  during  his  unemployment.  His  inability  to
work worsened his already poor financial situation. (GE 1; Tr. 21, 31-39; AE A)
Applicant attended a technical school full time from October 2020 to at least March
2022.  He  received  full  stack  development  certification  in  information  technology  (IT)
coding,  which  allowed  him  to  obtain  his  current  employment  as  a  web  developer.  He
provided  documentation  of  a  long  and  steady  track  record  of  $810  monthly  payments
toward his tuition for this certification. His last monthly payment is scheduled in November
2023. He then plans to use this budgeted monthly amount to pay more towards his U.S.
Department  of  Education  student  loans  and  to  make  payment  arrangements  with  his
remaining two SOR creditors.
SOR  ¶¶  1.a  - 1.b,  and  1.d  - 1.g  allege  that  Applicant  is  indebted  to  the U.S.
Department of Education for six student loans placed for collection in the total amount of
$26,402.  He  admitted  these  student  loans  in  his  SOR  response  and  stated  that  while
attending community college from 2012 to 2015, he sporadically made payments on these
loans for approximately a year. He stopped making payments on these loans before he
enrolled into a private college in 2016.  During the pandemic, he took advantage of the
federal student loan pause and focused on paying other debts. Beginning in March 2023,
Applicant consolidated his six student loans with a consumer student loan company. He
made  an  initial  payment  of  $299  in  March  2023,  and  thereafter  he  has  been  making
monthly  payments  of  $49  that  are  automatically  withdrawn  from  his  bank  account.  He
intends to increase his monthly payment after he makes his final monthly tuition payment
for his IT certification debt in November 2023. These student loans are in the process of
being paid. (AE B, AE C; Tr. 31-40; SOR response; GE 1)
Applicant  stated  that  the  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.b  was  for  his  2016  to  2019
enrollment at a private college. This private student loan debt was placed for collection in
the amount of $5,265. Applicant admitted this student tuition debt, and he intends to start
making  payments,  but  at  the  current  time  he  cannot  make  any  payments  until  he  has
satisfied his IT certification debt in November 2023. (Tr. 29-30, 33, 49-50; AE C-AE E, AE
G-AE L, AE Q, AE R, AE V)
SOR ¶ 1.h alleges that Applicant is indebted to a collection agency for a delinquent
credit  card  account  in  the  amount  of  $1,220.  Applicant  denied  this  debt  in  his  SOR
response.  He  provided  documentation  that  showed  this  account  was  fully  resolved  in
2022. (Tr. 41-45; AE G; SOR response)
SOR ¶ 1.i alleges that Applicant is indebted to a bank for a charged-off credit card
account  in  the  approximate  amount  of  $745.  Applicant  denied  this  debt  in  his  SOR
response. During the hearing he testified that he was uncertain whether he had paid or
settled this account. If it was not paid, then he intended to pay this account soon. He did
not  submit  post-hearing  documentation  verifying  the  resolution  of  this  account.  The
current credit report in the record indicated that this account has not yet been satisfied.
(Tr. 45-47; GE 6)
SOR ¶ 1.j alleges that Applicant is indebted to a collection agency for a delinquent
fitness/gym  account  in  the  amount  of  $159.  Applicant  admitted  this  debt  in  his  SOR
response.  He  provided  documentation  that  showed  this  account  was  fully  resolved  in
October 2023. (Tr. 47; AE H; SOR response)
Applicant provided a personal financial statement (PFS) after the hearing. With his
current annual income of $70,000, he has sufficient funds to pay his monthly expenses
and creditors. He reported that he puts away about $400 every month into his savings
account  in  the  event  of  an  emergency,  leaving  him  with  a  monthly  net  remainder  of
approximately $500. (AE D)
Character Reference
Applicant  submitted  two  character  reference  letters  from  his  current  program
manager  and  a  co-worker.  Both  employment  colleagues  lauded  Applicant’s  reliability,
diligence, and his outstanding work ethic for the mission he supports. Both have worked
closely with Applicant for the past 20 months, and they place a great deal of confidence
in his abilities. They readily endorsed Applicant for DOD security clearance eligibility.
