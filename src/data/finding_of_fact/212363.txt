Applicant is a 52-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security
clearance.  Admitted  facts  are  adopted  and  incorporated  by  reference.  Additional
findings of fact follow.
Background
Applicant   never  married   and   has  no   children.  (GE   1;  Tr.  47)   She   earned   a
bachelor’s degree  in 2007. (GE  1; Tr. 59) Between  2013  and  2014,  she  attended  post-
graduate  classes, but did not earn a  degree  or diploma. (Tr. 52-54)  Applicant enlisted  in
the  Inactive  Reserve of her state’s Army National Guard  in June  1996  and  served  over
16   years of duty   before   receiving   an  honorable   discharge   in   March  2013.  (GE   10   She
reenlisted  in  her  state’s  Army  National  Guard’s  Inactive  Reserve  in  September  2017
and served six months of duty before receiving an honorable discharge in March 2018.
(GE 1; Tr. 47)
Since  September  2018,  Applicant  has  been  employed  as  a  cyber  security
analyst.  (GE  1;  Tr. 44)  She  reported  recurrent  unemployment between  February 2013
and  August  2018.  She  held  a  security  clearance  during  her  first  Army  National  Guard
enlistment.  (GE  1)  However,  her  clearance  was  revoked  by  the  Army  in  2012  due  to
security concerns over her finances attributable to unstable employment issues. (GE 2;
Tr. 48)
Applicant’s finances
Between 2002 and 2014, Applicant took out federal student loans to finance her
undergraduate education.  (GEs  1-8) All of  the  loans  were  individual loans  without  any
co-signors.  (GEs  4-8)  Due  to  recurrent  problems  in  finding  employment,  she
encountered difficulties in paying her delinquent student loans and other debts. (Tr. 49)
Credit reports document that her student accounts remained in collection status before
2023. (GEs 4-6). She filed applications for forbearance over the course of her loans to
lighten the interest accruals on the loans and received some forbearance relief between
2011  and  2013.  (Tr.  60-62)  Since  her  student  loans  became  delinquent  in  2018,  she
has not received any confirmations of additional forbearance relief. (GE 7; Tr.  60)
In  April  2023,  Applicant  applied  for  and  was  accepted  in  the  DoE’s  fresh  start
program.  (AEs  G-H  and  J;  Tr.  60)  Payments  on  her  newly  consolidated  student  loans
(consolidated  as  a  part  of  her  fresh  start  acceptance)  are  scheduled  to  commence  in
March 2024. (AE P; Tr.40-42, 61, 63-64) Payment terms call for monthly payments on
the balance of her loans of $1,744. (AE P). She hopes to be able to fit her student loan
repayment obligations into her budget that also includes monthly financial support to her
family and friends. (Tr. 60-62)
Applicant has been making $200 monthly payments on her student  loans in the
interim before her fresh start loan payment obligations vest in 2024. (Tr. 64-65) Whether
she  will  have  sufficient  resources  to  follow  through  with  her  much  more  substantial
consolidated  loan  payments  scheduled  to  commence  in  March  2024  is  unclear  and
cannot be reliably anticipated at this time without a more positive track record.
Besides her student loans, Applicant accumulated 12 delinquent consumer debts
exceeding $15,000 and four medical debts exceeding $4,500. (GEs 4-8) She has made
only limited contacts with her creditors since her accounts were opened. And, she has
made only a few scattered payments on these accounts. (AEs C-K; Tr. 68-74)
Recently,  Applicant entered  into  payment plans with  SOR  creditors  1.q  (a $1,515
consumer  account)  and   1.z   (a   $252   consumer  account),   but  provided   no   material
payment  progress  on  these  plans.  (AEs F  and  C;  Tr. 68-75) She  is  credited  with  paying
off  two  accounts:  SOR  ¶¶  1.y (for $389)  and  1.bb  (for $479).  (AEs D-E  and  G-H; Tr. 68-
74)
Asked at hearing about the current status of the car loan she opened in 2010 for
$16,210,  she  offered  contradictory  responses  from  the  creditor  and  its  assignees
holding the loan (Tr. 68-74). In her post-hearing submissions, she documented a payoff
(undated) of this loan in 2014. (AEs K-L) Whether Applicant paid off this loan or the loan
was assigned to another creditor is unclear. Her most recent credit report of September
2023  only  verified  the  opening  of  the  loan  account  in  2010  for  $16,210  and  her
refinancing of the loan in 2014. (GE 8) Nothing more is known about the current status
of  this  loan  or  how  the  previously  reported  charge  off  of  the  loan  has  been  resolved.
(GEs 3-4) Without documented payments from Applicant of the reported $8,632 balance
or  other  clarifying  information  from  Applicant,  her  SOR  ¶  1.f  debt  cannot  be  favorably
resolved.
Applicant continues to  dispute  several debts. These  disputed  debts  are reported
as delinquent accounts covered  as follows:  SOR ¶¶  1.v (for $1,022), 1.w  (for $699) and
1.x (for  $392). She  cited  her return  of  the  equipment she  purchased  and  returned  to  the
creditors  as  the   basis of  her  disputes  with   them.  Efforts  to   have   these   debts   removed
from   her   credit   reports  have   not   been   successful.   (AEs-i   Tr.  77-83)   Without  more
information  and  documentation  to  corroborate  her disputes  of  these  debts,  they cannot
be favorably resolved.
Four  remaining  debts  that  are  covered  in  Applicant’s  credit  reports  are  medical
debts identified in SOR ¶¶ 1.ff (for $1,217), 1.ff (for $1,217), 1.gg (for $1,110), and 1.hh
(for  $214).  Asked  about  these  debts,  Applicant  replied  that  she  believed  they  were
covered  by  insurance  and  would  check  up  on  these  debts.  (GEs  4-5;  Tr.  83-86)  Her
post-hearing submissions provide no additional clarification of these medical debts, and
they remain unresolved without any evidentiary basis for favorably resolving them.
Applicant’s cited financial counseling is limited and lacking in details and follow-
up with her financial counselor. (AE B; Tr. 67) What lessons Applicant learned from her
meetings  with  the  counselor  are  unclear.  Her  counseling  sessions  with  the  counselor
are lacking in substance and details of the subjects covered. (Tr. 67)
Applicant  currently  nets  $4,600  a  month  from  her  work  and  has  supplemented
her income this past year with additional part-time work. (AE I; Tr. 44-45) She reported
monthly living expenses exceeding $1,200. (Tr. 90-91) She has a checking account with
a modest average monthly balance of around $2,300 and a small savings account, but
she has few other sources of income. (Tr. 93)  or other sources of income. (Tr. 88-91)
She attributed her income shortages to spreading herself too thin by helping her friends
and family financially. (GE 7; Tr. 88-89)
Endorsements
Applicant  is  well-regarded  by  her  manager  and  co-worker.  (AEs  M  and  O)  Her
former  coworker  and  current  manager  credited  her  with  being  a  top  performer  who
always  gives  her  best  effort  in  completing  the  challenges  assigned  to  her.  (AE  M)
Neither her references expressed any awareness of her current financial situation.
