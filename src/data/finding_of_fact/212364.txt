In Applicant’s SOR response, he denied the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.b and admitted
all  remaining  allegations  in  the  SOR.  His  admissions  are  accepted  as  findings  of  fact.
Additional findings follow.
Applicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor seeking to obtain a
security clearance. He has worked for his current employer since August 2019. He served
on active duty in the United States Navy from 1987 to 2007. He retired at the rank of E-7
with an honorable discharge. He held a security clearance while serving on active duty
for approximately 18 years. When he retired, he worked for a defense contractor until he
was  laid off in 2010. He  was unemployed between  December 2010  and  August 2014.
During this period, he was a full-time student attending college using his GI bill benefits.
He graduated in 2014 with an associate degree. After graduating, he worked for several
employers prior to his current position. He has been married since September 2012. He
has two children from prior marriages and his wife has three children from prior marriages.
The children are 17, 19, 22, 25 and 27.  With the exception of the oldest child, all children
live with them. (Tr. 18-20, 22-26; Gov 1)
Financial Considerations
The  SOR alleges  two tax  debts, five  commercial debts, and  two medical  debts,
totalling approximately $4,396. Specifically, Applicant owes State A $500 for delinquent
taxes for tax year 2008 (SOR ¶ 1.a: GE 2 at 2; GE 3 at 6-7).  Applicant is also alleged to
owe delinquent taxes (amount unknown) for tax year 2008 to State B. (SOR ¶ 1.b: GE 2
at 2).
Additional delinquent accounts alleged  in the  SOR include: a  $1,511 delinquent
cell phone service account placed for collection (SOR ¶ 1.c: GE 3 at 5; GE 4 at 2; GE 5
at 8); a $939 delinquent credit card account placed for collection (SOR ¶ 1.d: GE 3 at 3;
GE 4  at 2; GE 5 at 8); a $539 delinquent account placed for collection (SOR ¶ 1.e: GE 3
at 4; GE 4  at 2; GE 5 at 7); a $577 delinquent account placed for collection (SOR ¶ 1.f:
GE 3 at 4; GE 4  at 2-3; GE 5 at 7); a $203 delinquent cable television account placed for
collection (SOR ¶ 1.g: GE 3 at 5; GE 4 at 3; GE 5 at 7); a $53 delinquent medical account
that  was  placed  for  collection  (SOR  ¶  1.h:  GE  4  at  3);  and  a  $12  delinquent  medical
account that was placed for collection (SOR ¶ 1.i: GE 4 at 3)
Applicant admits he  owes State  A  income  taxes for 2008.  (SOR ¶  1.a)  In  April
2022, he  set up  a  payment plan  with  State  A  to  resolve the  taxes owed. He agreed  to  pay
$50 a  month. The first  payment began on May 2, 2022. As of April 21, 2023, the  balance
owed  was $1,816.28. He has an  allotment set up  to  make  monthly payments.  He believes
he has six months remaining  on  the  payment plan. He regrets not resolving  this situation
sooner. (Tr. 27-30; AE  A)
Applicant disputes that he owes state income taxes to State B for tax year 2008.
(SOR ¶ 1.b) Applicant moved from State A to State B in late 2008. He started a new job
located  in  State  B  in  December  2008.  When  filing  his  2008  income  tax  returns,  he
received tax assistance from a tax counselor at a local Army installation. (Local military
installations  often  provide  free  tax  service  for  uncomplicated  income  tax  returns.)
Applicant was advised by the tax counselor that he did not need to file state income tax
returns for State B because he  worked in State B for less than one month and did not
earn enough income in State B to warrant filing a state income tax return for 2008.  (Tr.
31-32)
Approximately, five or six years later, State B contacted Applicant and told him that
he owes state income taxes for the entire year for 2008, even though he only worked in
State B for one month. State B claims he owes them $7,000. Applicant admits he ignored
the tax issue involving State B because he did not have the money. He plans to dispute
the 2008 tax debt that State B claims he owes. He needs to get documentation from State
A to show to State B that he worked and paid taxes to State A the majority of the year in
2008. (Tr. 32-33) This is complicated by the fact that he did not timely pay the taxes owed
to State A for tax year 2008 and is in the process of resolving the tax debt to State A
before he can present evidence to resolve the tax issue with State B.
Aside from tax year 2008, Applicant timely files his state and federal income tax
returns each year. He has no other tax issues or liens. (Tr. 34)
The status of the remaining delinquent accounts are as follows:
SOR ¶  1.c:   $1,511 delinquent cell phone account placed for collection: Applicant
admits this debt but has made no arrangements to for pay this debt. He is aware he needs
to take care of the debt. The debt remains unresolved. (Tr. 35; AE C at 20)
SOR ¶  1.d:  $939 delinquent credit card account placed for collection: Applicant
admits this debt. He just did not take care of it. The debt remains unresolved. (Tr. 36; AE
C at 24-25)
SOR ¶  1.e:   $598 credit card account placed for collection: Applicant admits this
debt. He made no arrangements to resolve this debt. The debt is unresolved. (Tr. 37-38)
SOR  ¶   1.f:   $577 delinquent credit card account placed for collection: Applicant
admits this debt. The account has been delinquent since October 2017. He did not make
arrangements  to  the  pay  this  debt.  The  August  29,  2023  credit  report  submitted  by
Applicant indicates that he unsuccessfully disputed this debt on his credit report. The debt
is unresolved. (Tr. 38; AE C at 21-22)
SOR ¶  1.g:  $208 delinquent cable television account:  Applicant believes this debt
might  be  resolved.  The  account  is  no  longer  listed  on  his  credit  report.  It  is  not  clear
whether this debt is resolved. (Tr. 38-39)
SOR ¶  1.h:   $53 delinquent medical account:  Applicant claims he paid the account
off,  but  offered no  proof.  The account  is no longer listed on  his credit  report.  I  find  for
Applicant regarding this account. The amount is de minimis. (Tr. 39)
SOR ¶ 1.i:  $12 delinquent medical account: Applicant claims he paid the account
off, but offered no proof.  The account is no longer listed on his credit report. I find for
Applicant because the amount is insignificant and it is no longer on his credit report. (Tr.
39)
Applicant  testified  that  one  of  his  car  loans  is  past  due  $1,000.  He  is  making
monthly payments to resolve the past-due balance and pay the car loan off. There is a
$5,000  balance  on  the  debt.  His  daughter  drives  the  car.  He  has  no  other  delinquent
accounts.  (Tr.  40-41)  Most  of  the  debts  became  delinquent  between  2017  and  2019.
During  this  time  period,  Applicant’s  income  was  not  sufficient  to  meet  expenses.
Applicant’s annual income was approximately $35,000 during this time period. His wife
earned approximately $32 per hour. He and his family were renting a home on a former
military base. The rent and expenses were much cheaper than living off base. The base
closed the family housing and he and his family had to move off base, which increased
his monthly expenses. His rent increased from $1,100 to $1,700. His priority was to put
food on the table and pay his bills. Taking care of family was more important to him. All
of the children lived with them and they also took in a friend of his son who was kicked
out of his house. He lived with them for eight to ten months. (Tr 40-43)
Applicant’s current expenses include rent: $2,600; car insurance: $1,000; car/gas
$1,300;  groceries:  $300;  and  electric/water:  $1,000.  He  has  approximately  $9,000  to
$11,000 in his 401(k) account.  Applicant currently earns $54,000 annually. His wife earns
$60,000 annually. His children help with buying food. He estimates he receives between
$700 and $1,000 a month from the children to help pay bills and food. They currently have
a young woman living with them who is the fiancée of the young man they took in several
years  prior.  She  will  move  out  when  they  marry  in  December.  She  has  lived  with
Applicant’s family for one and half years and helps with utilities and food. (Tr. 44-50)
Applicant  attended  financial  counseling  a  few  years  ago.  He  was  not  good  at
following a budget. He also tried debt consolidation with his credit cards two years ago.
However, the credit card balances increased again. (Tr. 50-51)
Applicant’s awards and decorations during his active duty service include:  SSBN
Strategic  Deterrent  Patrol  Pin  (9);  Navy  Good  Conduct  Medal  (5),  Global  War  on
Terrorism Service Medal, Navy “E” Ribbon, Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal
