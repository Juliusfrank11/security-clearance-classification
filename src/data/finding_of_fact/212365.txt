Applicant is a  44-year-old employee  of  a  government  contractor  for whom  he  has
worked  since  2003.  He  earned  a  high  school diploma  in  1997  and  a  bachelor’s degree
in 2022.  He  has been  married  since  September 2014.  He has two  children, ages  12  and
9.   He   enlisted   in   the   Marines   in   1997   and   was  honorably discharged   in   2002.   He  has
held a  security clearance since  1997.  (Tr.  17-20,  45-46, 93-94;  Answer;  GE 1)
In  the  SOR,  the  Government  alleged  Applicant’s  five  delinquent  financial
accounts  totaling  approximately  $42,000.  These  delinquent  accounts  consisted  of  a
personal loan (SOR ¶ 1.a), credit cards (SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c), an automobile loan (SOR
¶ 1.d), and a telecommunications debt (SOR ¶ 1.e). He denied all the SOR allegations
because he claimed he was in the process of resolving them and they should not result
in  the  loss  of  his  security  clearance.  Notwithstanding  his  denials,  the  SOR  allegations
are established by the Government’s 2021, 2022, and two 2023 credit reports. (Answer;
GE 1-5; AE A-H)
Between   December   2022  and   May 2023,  Applicant   resolved   all   the   accounts   in
the   SOR.  He   fell  behind   on   the   SOR   accounts   in   about   2015   because   his  wife,  with
whom   he   shared   household   expenses,   was  laid  off.   From   2012   until  about   2022,   she
also  had   multiple  serious   health   problems,  including   mental   health   issues,   that
contributed   to   her  inability  to   find   income   comparable   to   what   she   earned   before  she
lost   her  job.   In   December  2022,  Applicant   contacted   a   debt  consolidation   company  to
help him  resolve the  SOR debts. He  then  contacted  the  creditors of  the  SOR  debts.  He
made  payment arrangements  with  the  creditors and   satisfied  these  debts  for less  than
the  full  balance  after he  received  the  SOR.  He  settled  the  debts  in  SOR ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b
after the   creditor filed  legal proceedings   against him.   (Tr.   20-32,   46-60,  76,   79-84,   93-
100; Answer; GE  2-5; AE  A-I)
Applicant  claimed  that  he  thought he  was beginning  to  regain his financial footing
in   about  late   2018,   but  he   concentrated   on   saving   money   and   paying   other,
nondelinquent  debts, until the   end   of  2022.  His  wife’s  mental health   also  informed   the
timing  of when  he  addressed  his SOR debts.  He admitted  that the  possibility of losing
his security clearance  was a motivating factor in resolving his SOR debts.  I observed his
and   his  wife’s   demeanor   while  they   testified   and   found   their   testimony,  including
statements  about  the   resolution   of  his  SOR  debts,  to   be   credible.   Their   willingness  to
openly  testify  about  derogatory  information   bolstered   their   credibility.   Applicant   also
provided  documentary  corroboration  of the  resolution of the  SOR debts.  (Tr.  20-32,  46-
60,  76, 79-84, 93-100; Answer; GE 2-5; AE  A-I)
Over the last ten years, Applicant has earned at least $65,000, annually. He also
has  received  about  $1,900  in  monthly  military  disability  benefits.  His  wife  has  earned
about $65,000 per year since mid-2018, when she regained full-time employment. She
expects to earn more when she finishes human  resource (HR) and leadership  training
with her employer. She also expects that her new position in HR will be more stable and
transferable than her current and past positions that were reliant on the economic health
of the oil and gas industry. She is receiving medical treatment for her health issues and
is  no   longer  suffering   from   them   to   a   degree   that   negatively   impacts  her   ability   to
contribute   to   the   family’s   financial   standing.   Applicant   and   his   wife   sit  down  together
monthly  to   pay   the   bills,   and   they   have   established   a   written   budget.   Their   budget
shows  that   after  paying   their   expenses   they   have   a   monthly   surplus  of  about   $3,700.
They  have   several   non-delinquent   credit   cards   and   non-delinquent   revolving   loan
accounts   on   which   they   maintain   a   balance.   Applicant   has   completed   some   credit
counseling  courses  through  a  non-profit  organization.  He  and  his  wife  both  testified  that
he   is  able  to   pay  his bills on   time  and   that  they   had  about  $10,000   combined   in   three
bank  accounts.  Prior to  resolving  the  SOR  debts,  they  had  about $20,000  in  those  bank
accounts.   Applicant   also  has  a   retirement  account  with   a   balance   of  about  $87,000.
Neither he  nor his wife  currently  have  any  delinquent financial accounts.  (Tr.  33-46, 59-

While   Applicant   was  in  the   Marines,  he   earned   several  commendations   and
medals.   He  has   also   received   several   awards   at  work.  His  colleagues,  friends,  and
family have  written  character-reference  letters  advocating  that  he  be  awarded  a  security
clearance  and  attesting  to  his good  character,  trustworthiness, reliability, and  patriotism.
His wife  also testified  to  his reliability, honesty, and  strength of character.  (Tr.  33-46, 59-
