Applicant is a 58-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since July 2021. He served on active duty in the U.S. military from
1986 until he retired with an honorable discharge in 2006. He attended college, but he
has not earned a degree. He is married with two adult children. (Tr. at 11, 14-18, 37, 39;

The  SOR  alleges  eight  delinquent  debts  totaling  about  $83,000.  The  debts  are
listed  on  one  or  more  credit  reports  from  February  2022,  November  2022,  and  March
2023. (Tr. at 26, 28; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3-5)
Applicant had a good income while working overseas from about 2009 to 2013.
He  did  not  make  as  much  when  he  returned  and  relied  on  credit.  His  balances
increased  to  the  point  where  it  was  difficult  to  keep  up.  He  contracted  with  a  debt-
settlement company in June 2018 to assist him in resolving his debts. (Tr. at 11-16, 20,
40; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE A, B)
Applicant  enrolled  ten  debts,  totaling  about  $100,000,  in  the  company’s  debt-
resolution program, including five of the debts alleged in the SOR. Applicant agreed to
make  monthly  $600  payments,  which  would  be  held  in  an  escrow  account,  minus  the
company’s fees. The debt-settlement company agreed to negotiate settlements with his
creditors and use the accumulated funds in the escrow account to pay the settlements.
(Tr. at 11-13; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2; AE A, B)
Applicant  made  numerous  payments  in  excess  of  the  $600  monthly  payments.
He also occasionally missed a payment. As of August 2023, he had deposited $44,096
into  the  escrow  account,  and  it  had  a  balance  of  $4,084  available  for  settlement
payments. Four debts totaling about $30,500 were not alleged in the SOR because they
were  settled  and  paid  before  the  SOR  was  issued.  (Tr.  at  13,  21-22,  25,  40,  44;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2; AE A, B)
The debt-settlement company reached an agreement with the credit union for the
charged-off $20,000 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c to settle the debt for $9,812. The credit
union charged off $20,817. The credit reports show declining balances and indicate the
account  was  being  paid  “under  a  partial  payment  agreement.”  By  February  2022,  the
balance  had  been  reduced  to  $16,626.  The  balance  was  $13,900  in  November  2022
and $12,810 in March 2023. (Tr. at 22, 25; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE A,

The debt-settlement company reached a settlement agreement with the bank for
the  $3,889  charged-off  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.d.  The  credit  reports  show  declining
balances. By February 2022, the balance had been reduced to $3,305, and the balance
was $1,925 in November 2022. The settlement payments were completed in December
2022, which resolved this debt. (Tr. at 25-26; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE
A, B)
SOR ¶ 1.e alleges a $1,117 delinquent debt to a collection company on behalf of
a bank. The debt-settlement company reached  an agreement to settle the debt,  which
was $1,445, for $723. The balance was $1,254 in February 2022, before the SOR was
issued. By November 2022, the balance had been reduced to $1,117, and it was $1,057
in March 2023. (Tr. at 25-27; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE B)
Applicant stated  that he  paid  the  $54  telecommunications debt alleged  in SOR ¶
1.f.  The   debt  is  listed   on   the   February  2022   credit  report,  but  not  the   two   later  credit
reports.  (Tr. at 27-29; Applicant’s response  to SOR;  GE 3-5)
The  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  ($23,167)  and  1.b  ($22,222)  are  in  the  debt-
resolution program but have not yet been paid. SOR ¶ 1.g alleges a $7,581 charged-off
deficiency  balance  on  an  auto  loan  after  the  vehicle  was  repossessed.  Applicant  took
out the loan for a vehicle for his son, with his son making the payments. His son was out
of work and unable to make the payments, so he voluntarily returned the vehicle. This
debt and the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a ($5,226) are not in the debt-resolution program,
but  Applicant  is  in  the  process  of  enrolling  them  in  the  program.  (Tr.  at  22-25,  29-33;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-5; AE A, B)
Applicant has not received formal financial counseling  aside from any advice he
received from the debt-settlement company. He credibly testified that he would continue
with the debt-resolution program until his debts are paid. The process has taken longer
than he anticipated, but it is working for him, and he is committed to it. His finances are
not perfect, but they are better than they were. He has the means to continue with the
program until completion. (Tr. at 17-20, 34-42, 45-47; GE 2-5)
