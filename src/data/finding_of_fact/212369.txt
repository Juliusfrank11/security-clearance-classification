Applicant  admitted  all  the  SOR  allegations,  with  explanations.  Her  admissions
are  incorporated  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  review  of  the  pleadings  and  evidence,  I
make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 36-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She has worked for
this  employer  for  over  two  years.  She  experienced  periods  of  unemployment  from
December 2020 to June 2021; from February 2018 to April 2018; and from July 2013 to
December 2013. She holds a bachelor’s degree and has taken some courses toward a
master’s. She is single, never married, and has no children. This is her first application
for a position of trust. (Tr. at 6, 37; 40-41; GE 1)
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant  accumulated  11  delinquent  debts
totaling
approximately  $38,000  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.j).  The  delinquent  debts  included  two  student
loans,  two  car-repossession  deficiencies,  three  medical  debts,  and  four  credit  card  or
consumer debts. The debts are established by Applicant’s admissions to a background
investigator  in  August  2021;  credit  reports  from  June  2021,  January  2022,  and
September 2023; and her admissions in her SOR answer. (GE 2-5; SOR answer)
Applicant  testified  that  she  was  financially  illiterate  growing  up.  Even  when  she
entered  college  and  began  taking  out  student  loans,  she  remained  financially
unsophisticated. Consequently, she agreed to cosign a car loan for her mother and took
out  credit  cards  without  realizing  the  impact  these  actions  would  have  on  her  overall
financial  wellbeing.  She  has  dealt  with  family  issues  including  the  death  of  her  father
and her brother’s shooting. She indicated that with the exception of two medical debts
(SOR ¶¶ 1.i-1.j), she has not made any payments on the rest of the SOR debts. (Tr. 19,
44)
Concerning  her  student  loans,  Applicant  gave  conflicting  information  about
whether  they  were  forgiven.  During  her  background  interview  with  an  investigator  in
August  2021,  which  she  authenticated  in  July  2022,  she  admitted  having  multiple
federal student  loans  for  which  she  failed  to make any  payments. She  admitted  these
loans became delinquent, but she could not recall when that was. She claimed that she
applied for a loan forgiveness program, qualified for the program, and the student loans
were  then  forgiven.  She  did  not  provide  any  documentation  to  corroborate  this  action.
(GE  2)  The  SOR  student-loan  debt  appears  on  her  June  2021  credit  report  with  the
following information:
Date   Reported:  06/21;  Date   Assigned:  09/06;  Activity  Date:  06/21;
Balance   Date:   06/21;   Narrative   1:  Acct   120   days   past   due;   Narrative   4:
Charged-off Acct.  (GE  3)
Applicant’s September 2023 credit report shows 16 federal student-loan accounts with a
payment status of “Pays account as agreed.” None of these account numbers match the
account number for the student loan alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a. Applicant also admitted that
she has never made student loan payments. It appears Applicant’s current student-loan
payment status may be  the result of President Biden’s action pausing the collection of
student  loans  due  to  COVID-19,  thus  creating  a  deferment  period  on  student-loan
payments. (Tr. 23, 27, 44; GE 2-5)
Applicant testified that she planned to work with a credit repair agent or company
to deal with her delinquent debts. She has looked into doing so, but as of the hearing,
she had not contacted any person or group yet. She also will look into loan forgiveness
concerning  her  student  loans.  Once  she  completes  making  her  car  payments  of  $450
monthly  (no payoff  date  stated),  she  will use those funds  to pay  her delinquent  debts.
She provided a copy of her monthly budget that shows she has a monthly remainder of
approximately $700 after paying all bills. She documented making payments for the two
medical  debts  listed  at  SOR  ¶¶  1.i-1.j.  Those  two  debts  are  resolved.  She  has  not
received financial counseling or otherwise enhanced her knowledge of financial issues.
