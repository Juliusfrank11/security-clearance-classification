Applicant admitted  SOR ¶¶  1.a–1.f, with  explanations, but she  denied  the  SOR ¶
1.g.   Her   admissions   are   incorporated   into   these   findings   of  fact.   After  a   review  of   the
pleadings and  evidence, I make the following  additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 61-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She began working
at  her  present  job  in  April  2006.  She  has  worked  for  U.S.  defense  contractors  for
approximately  30  years.  She  has  held  a  security  clearance  for  19  years,  without  any
security incidents. She holds an associate degree. She married in 1985 and divorced in
2017. She has two adult children. (Tr. 6, 21-22, 25; GE 1)
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant failed to timely file her federal
income tax returns for tax years 2014 through 2020, as required. Applicant’s admissions
establish the SOR allegations, except for tax year 2020. (GE 1-3; SOR answer)
Applicant  accepted  responsibility  for  failing  to  timely  file  her  federal  income  tax
returns for the years indicated. She also provided explanations for events happening in
her life that impacted her ability to file these tax returns at the time.
When  Applicant  was  married  to  her  ex-husband,  he  took  the  responsibility  for
filing  the  family’s  tax  returns.  He  owned  a  small  business,  which  required  that  a  more
complex  tax  return  was  required.  She  would compile  all of  her tax-related  documents,
put  them  in  an  envelope,  and  give  them  to  her  ex-husband  at  tax  time.  That  was  the
extent of her involvement with the tax-filing process during her marriage. Once she was
divorced in 2017, she had to learn how to file her returns and pay any taxes herself. She
sought  the  help  and  advice  from  a  friend  and  tax  preparer  to  mentor  her  on  the  tax
process. Both she and her ex-husband have used this person to help prepare their tax
returns for the past 30 years. (Tr. 22, 27-28)
In  October 2018, Applicant’s  home  was nearly  destroyed  by Hurricane Michael.
She suffered property damage valued at approximately $200,000. She also had to pay
out-of-pocket for immediate repairs to her home to make it habitable. She would later be
reimbursed by insurance for the damage, but only after she hired an attorney. While she
was  generally  made  whole  by  the  insurance  payment,  the  last  payment  was  finally
received in May or June 2023, some five years after the event. The hurricane impacted
her  tax  situation  because  the  repair  expenses  took  funds  away  from  being  applied
toward any tax debt. She also was unable to contact her tax mentor, who was severely
impacted  by  the  hurricane  until  sometime  in  2019.  Applicant  found  out  later  that  the
hurricane caused her tax mentor to move to another state. Applicant prepared draft tax
returns  on  her  own  for  2017  and  2018.  These  drafts  reflected  that  she  would  owe
money  to  the  IRS  for  both  years.  She  erroneously  believed  she  could  not  file  her  tax
return if she owed money but could not pay it at the time she filed the return. As a result,
she waited until she accumulated enough funds to pay her taxes owed before she filed
the returns for 2017 and 2018. (Tr. 28, 32-33, 35-36, 38-39, 51-52)
Applicant documented her federal income tax return filings below:

She   contacted   the   IRS   but  was  unable   to   receive  a   copy  of  this
return.  This  was  during   the   timeframe   that   her  ex-husband   was  filing   their   joint
tax return.

Applicant credibly testified that she has learned from her mistakes and has since
timely  filed  her  federal  income  tax  returns.  She  has  received  tax  refunds  for  the  past
four  tax  years.  While  a  copy  of  her  2014  tax  transcript  was  unavailable,  she  owes  no
taxes for that year. This is also a tax return her husband would have prepared and filed.
She admitted that the security clearance process lit a fire for her to file the late returns.
All the late returns were filed before the issuance of the SOR. (Tr. 22-23; AE A)
Applicant’s  facility  security  officer  (FSO)  testified  that  he  has  known  her  since
2006  and  highly  respects  her.  She  is  trustworthy,  reliable,  and  exercises  good
judgment. He is personally aware of the damage she suffered because of the hurricane
in 2018, and the difficulty she faced dealing with the insurance company. She is not the
type of person who is a tax protestor. He was also aware of her efforts to work with the
IRS to resolve her tax issues. (Tr. 41-50)
