Applicant admitted all of the allegations in SOR as amended. After a thorough and
careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following
findings of fact.
Applicant is 44 years old. He is a high school graduate and has completed various
certifications. He was married from 2001 to 2005 and 2008 to 2015. He remarried in 2022
and has a four-year-old child with his current spouse. He also has two adult stepchildren.
One  stepdaughter, who  has  two  children,  lives  with  him and  his wife.  He  provides  her
some financial support along with support she receives from the government. His mother
also lives with them after she sold her house. She made a profit on the house. She does
not contribute to the household expenses. (Tr. 18-23, 34-36; GE 1)
Applicant  completed   a   security  clearance   application   (SCA)  in  May  2022.  He
reported  he  was employed  from  2006  to  August 2021  with  the  same  employer, Company
C. He also reported  that he  was self-employed  from  2016  to  the  present, owning  his own
business.  He  was  laid   off   by  Company   C  due   to   the   pandemic  and   lack   of   work.  He
received   a   severance   package   of  $20,000   from   Company  C.  He  testified   that  he   then
devoted  all  his time  to  his private  business  for about three  months. He did  not  actively
look for a  job. When his cash  reserves  began  to  run  low, he  secured  a  job  with a  federal
contractor in November 2021.  (Tr. 13, 23-28; GE 1)
Applicant’s wife was employed steadily until October 2022 when she was laid off.
He and his wife decided to invest in her private photography business after she lost her
job. Beginning in 2020, he used his income from his job to fund her business while they
were both working. Later, they used the $20,000 of severance pay he received and about
$6,000 to $7,000 they had in savings and invested in both of their businesses. She took
classes  and  purchased  equipment  that  were  required  for  the  business.  They  hired  a
mentor to help her so she would be able to pursue the business full time. They leased
equipment until they could complete the payments and now own the equipment. When
she would make a sale, they would use that money to pay the business expenses. He
used  the  income  from  his  paycheck  to  support  his  wife’s  business  until  it  became
profitable  and  then  the  business  could  support  itself.  In  June  2023,  his  wife  rented  a
building  where  she  can  run  her  business.  All  the  business  expenses  are  current.  He
estimated that her monthly expenses for the business, including personal loans she has
taken  are  approximately  $10,900  a  month.  These  expenses  are  being  paid  from  the
profits  of  the  business.  He  is  hopeful  this  business  will  be  successful  so  eventually  a
salary can be generated. (Tr. 23-34, 120-121)
Applicant  was  asked  at  his  hearing  if  he  had  any  other  private  businesses  or
sources of income. He said he continues to build his wife’s business, and he is also a co-
owner of a software company which was initiated  between June and August 2022. He
invested $5,000 in the business. He obtained a loan from his mother for the investment.
There  are  two  other  business  partners  and  a  new  chief  executive  officer  who  will
participate full time but will be paid with equity in the company in lieu of salary. Applicant
stated the business is profitable, but he cannot take a salary from it yet. (Tr. 121-123)
Applicant  testified that it  is the American dream to own your own company. His
wife’s business is now generating  income  to break even, and this is her sole source of
income. He believes she can generate about $200,000 in income annually and then they
can  eliminate  their  debts.  He  said  he  is  no  longer  using  his  income  to  subsidize  her
business. He decided to take the gamble and believes once her business is  profitable,
they can resolve their debts. All her business expenses are being paid. His debts were
put on the “back burner.” (Tr. 126-131)
Applicant attributes his financial issues to a series of unfortunate events. In June
2023, his aunt passed away, and he purchased a plane ticket for his mother to attend the
services. In August 2023, their vehicle was totaled in an accident. They have been using
his mother’s vehicle since then and it is unreliable, so he uses a ride share or occasionally
rents a car. They have not replaced the vehicle. If his transportation is work related, he is
reimbursed. In September 2023, his wife’s stepfather passed away. He contributed $200
to  $300  for his  funeral. A  friend  paid for his wife’s plane  ticket.  About a week later her
stepbrother passed away and shortly thereafter her stepsister passed away. He estimated
that he spent several hundred dollars for food for his wife while she was with her family.
He did not contribute to the funeral costs. (Tr. 37-43)
Applicant testified  that he  was paying  all  his bills on  time  and  was not delinquent
on  any of his debts  in 2020. He decided  to  file Chapter 13  bankruptcy in October 2020
because  he  had  a  lot of bills. He said he  accumulated  many of the  bills during  his second
marriage   and   after  his  divorce.  His  monthly  Chapter  13   bankruptcy  payments  were
approximately  $400.  He  made   the   payments  for  five   months.   His  payments  were
increased  to  approximately $600  to  $700  a  month. He explained  that  his mortgage  was a
secured  loan  and  his attorney wanted  him  to  sell  his house. He did not want to  sell  it,  so
he   withdrew  from   the   bankruptcy.   He  testified   that  his  attorney  advised   him   that  if  he
withdrew from  the  bankruptcy then  his debts  were  no  longer protected,  and  they would
become   due,   and   he   would  be   responsible   for  paying   them.  He  understood   the
consequences and  withdrew from  the  bankruptcy in May  2021.  He said he  reached  out
to  his creditors and  proceeded  to  address those  who  were  willing  to  accept his payment
arrangements.  Once  he  resolved  one  debt,  he  then  would  begin to  resolve another. As
part of his bankruptcy, he  completed the  mandatory  one-hour  online  counseling. (Tr. 49-
52, 56-58, 65-66; GE  3)
Applicant’s current salary is approximately $150,000. Before his wife was laid off
her salary was approximately $80,000 to $90,000. There was no point in time when they
were both unemployed. When Applicant applied for a job three months after he was laid
off, he was able to secure one immediately. When he was laid off, he continued to work
as a subcontractor for the employer but was earning less. He remained a subcontractor
until June 2022. He stated that he was to receive $10,000 to $14,000 for work he had
done, but the employer did not pay him. (Tr. 59-64)
Applicant testified that he hired a credit company in about August 2021 to help him
negotiate reasonable payment plans with his creditors. He paid the company $2,500. It
appears the company attempted to dispute debts on Applicant’s credit report. He admitted
the debts were valid, and he legitimately owed them. He testified that he was to send to
the credit company any notices he received from the creditors, which he said he did. He
believes this company was a scam as they did not do what they promised. He was offered
an opportunity to provide a copy of the contract he had with the credit company. He did
not. (Tr. 74-84; GE 4)
In  Applicant’s  post-hearing  submission,  he  provided  a  contract  executed  on
October 31, 2023, which showed he has hired a debt relief company (DRC) and enrolled
in their credit counseling program to facilitate the repayment of his debts in the SOR. Tr.
147; AE J) He stated:
Subsequent to  signing the  agreement,  I learned  that payments to  creditors
would  commence   only   in  the   seventh   month   after  I   submit  payments  to
them.  Seeking   a   more  immediate   solution,  I  directly  contacted   each
company  to   explore   potential  payment  plans.  Fortunately,  some   have
already sent me offer notes via email or fax. (AE G)
Applicant  further  stated  he  was  seeking  a  second  chance  to  rebuild  his  finances.  He
provided a copy of a spreadsheet with his creditors and status of each debt. (AE G, L)
Applicant’s  admissions  in  the  SOR,  testimony,  post-hearing  statement  and
documents, and credit reports from June 2022 and October 2023 corroborate the SOR
allegations. (GE 1-5)
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.b ($25,549) is a charged-off credit card debt. When Applicant
filed bankruptcy, he stopped making payments. He said he was told by his attorney that
once he withdrew from his bankruptcy his creditors would contact him. He  testified that
he  reached  out  to  this  creditor  after  he  withdrew  from  the  bankruptcy  to  establish  a
payment plan. He said he was told they would contact him, and he would receive a packet
in the mail. He did not and did not reach out to the creditor again until after he received
the  SOR  in  December  2022.  He  was  unable  to  negotiate  a  payment  plan.  In  a  post-
hearing  statement,  Applicant  said  he  had  reached  a  payment  arrangement  with  the
creditor to pay $300 a month, and he was waiting for correspondence from the creditor.
No payments have been made and the debt is unresolved. (Tr. 66-72; GE 2, 5; AE G)
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.c ($13,097) is a charged-off credit card debt. After receiving
the SOR, Applicant contacted the creditor and negotiated a payment plan to pay $1,964
with the first payment of $149 due in January 2023 and then monthly payments of $165
until  December  2023.  Applicant  has  made  consistent  monthly  payments.  The  debt  is
being resolved. (Tr. 48-56; AE A, L; Answer to SOR)
The  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.d  ($12,866)  is  a  charged-off  credit  card  debt.  Applicant
testified that he has been making payments of $150 through an automatic payment since
May  2021.  He  provided  documents  to  show  he  made  payments  in  October  2022  and
December 2022 and his balance owed was $10,466. He was unable to provide additional
documentation, but the balance reduction is consistent with monthly payments. The debt
is being resolved. (Tr. 43-49, 55-56; GE 2, 5; Answer to SOR; AE B, G)
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.e ($8,778) is a charged-off unsecured loan that was opened
in October 2019. Applicant believed he made his last payment in September or October
2020. He has not made another payment. In a post-hearing statement, Applicant said that
he was waiting for an answer from the creditor to settle the debt or make a payment plan.
The debt is unresolved. (Tr. 72-76, 84; GE 1, 5; AE G, L)
Applicant  could  not  recall  what  type  of  debt  is  in  SOR  ¶  1.f  ($6,772).  He  was
contacted by the creditor after he withdrew from his bankruptcy, and they offered him a
payment plan to pay $400 a month. He could not afford to make the payment. He was
contacted again after he received the SOR, but he still could not afford the $400. He told
the creditor that when he has more money available, he will contact them again. He has
not made a payment on this debt since 2020. In a post-hearing statement, Applicant said
that he was waiting for an answer from the creditor to settle the debt or make a payment
plan. The debt is unresolved. (Tr. 84-95; GE 2, 5AE G, L)
The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.g ($6,258) and 1.h ($2,280) are owed to the same creditor
for  charged-off  credit  card  accounts.  Applicant  testified  that  he  contacted  this  creditor
sometime between November 2022 and February 2023, but he could not remember. He
was  offered  a  payment  plan  if  he  could  make  three  monthly  payments  to  resolve  the
debts.  He  testified  that  he  does  not  know  if  the  offer  is  still  good  because  he  said  he
cannot begin to make payments until he completes the payment plan for the debt in SOR
¶  1.c.  He has not made any payments on  these debts since 2020.  In his post-hearing
response,  Applicant  provided  settlement  offers  from  the  creditor.  For  SOR  ¶  1.g  the
creditor agreed to accept a settlement of $4,694 and for ¶ 1.h an amount of $1,710. These
payments must be received by the creditor within 90 days from the date of the agreement,
which  was  November  13,  2023.  Applicant  did  not  provide  evidence  he  has  paid  the
settlements. These debts are unresolved. (Tr. 97-102, 105-106; GE 2, 5; AE G, H, I, L)
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.i ($2,121) is for a delinquent unsecured loan. In his answer
to the SOR, Applicant said he had ongoing conversations with the creditor to negotiate a
settlement of the debt. Applicant testified that he is being sued by the creditor for the debt
in SOR ¶ 1.i and two others that are not alleged in the SOR. One debt is for $4,975 and
he could not remember the amount of the third debt. Applicant testified that he has hired
an attorney to address the lawsuit against him for this debt and two others from the same
creditor. In a post-hearing statement, Applicant said that he was waiting for an answer
from the creditor to  settle  the debt or make a  payment plan. He did  not mention  if  the
lawsuit is pending or if his attorney is still involved. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 88-93,
102, 106-109; GE 5; AE G, L)
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.j ($1,156) is a charged-off credit card debt. Applicant’s last
payment was in October 2020. After receiving  the SOR, he contacted the  creditor. He
said he made an offer, but a payment plan had not been accepted. He testified that he
would follow up to see if he can get an offer in writing. In his post-hearing statement, he
provided a document with a settlement offer for $926 to be paid by December 1, 2023.
No proof of payment was submitted. The debt is unresolved. (Tr. 109-112; GE 2, 5; AE
G, N, L)
The debt in SOR  ¶ 1.k ($700) is a delinquent medical debt. Applicant could not
recall when he incurred it. He admitted he did not pay the balance owed but has offered
to make monthly payments of $50. The creditor wanted an initial payment of $300 and
then  $100  payments.  Applicant  could  not  recall  how  old  the  debt  is.  In  a  post-hearing
statement, Applicant said that he was waiting for an answer from the creditor to settle the
debt  or  make  a  payment  plan.  He  has  not  made  payments  on  the  debt,  and  it  is
unresolved. (Tr. 112-115; GE 2, 5; AE G, L)
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.l ($249) is a credit-card debt in collection. Applicant testified
that this debt has been sold a couple of times to different collection companies.  In his
SOR  answer, he said he had made  attempts  to satisfy the debt and  was  waiting for a
response from the creditor. He testified that he was waiting for something in the mail from
the  creditor,  but  he  had  not  reached  out  to  them  to  satisfy  the  debt.  In  a  post-hearing
statement, Applicant said that he was waiting for an answer from the creditor to settle the
debt or make a payment plan. It remains unresolved. (Tr. 115-118; GE 2, 5; AE G)
Applicant was asked at his hearing the status of his tax returns. He testified that
his 2021 federal income tax return was filed in September 2023. He said that he had not
yet filed his 2022 federal income tax returns. He said he owed federal income taxes for
tax year 2019 ($10,132), 2020 ($11,139) and 2021 ($16,129). He did not know why he
did not pay. He said he met with the IRS in person in October 2021  and was put on a
suspended payment plan because the IRS determined he could not pay his taxes.  (Tr.
131-147)
Applicant testified that the accounting service that was to complete his tax returns
did them incorrectly, reporting he had more income than he earned. The record was held
open for Applicant to provide any amended returns he may have filed to reduce his tax
debt. He was also told he could provide copies of his tax transcripts to show when he filed
and  any  other  matters  he  wanted  to  present,  including  information  from  his  new
accountants and their actions. Applicant testified that he did not pay the taxes he owed
because he did not have the money. He stated that he also did not file his state income
tax returns for 2019 through 2022. He was to provide evidence that his state taxes were
filed and if he owed any amount if he has paid it. (Tr. 131-147)
In  Applicant’s  post-hearing  submission,  he  stated  that  he  engaged  multiple  tax
preparers since 2020. They did not handle his tax returns accurately and he dismissed
them. He then sought a more reputable tax professional who meticulously reviewed his
previous tax filings, identified errors, and filed amended tax returns. He did not provide
copies of his amended returns. To address his tax liabilities he stated, “I am entering into
a  payment  arrangement  with  the  IRS  to  expedite  compliance.”  No  documents  were
provided to show he has an installment agreement with the IRS. (AE G)
Applicant provided copies of IRS tax transcripts for tax years 2018 (balance owed-
zero), 2019 (balance owed-$10,192), 2020 (balance owed-$11,503) and 2021 (balance
owed-$16,441). His 2018 tax return was timely filed; 2019 tax return was filed in January
2021; 2020 tax return was timely filed with an extension; and his 2021 return was filed in
September 2023.  He did  not  provide  a  tax  transcript  for  2022  or  evidence  that  his tax
return was filed for that year. (AE Q, R, S, T)
Regarding his state income tax returns and liabilities, Applicant stated in his post-
hearing  submission  that  he  learned  he  owes  his  state  $2,117  and  has  established  a
payment plan. He provided a document to show he owed state taxes for 2021 and the
payment  balance  was  $2,167  as  of  November  2023.  He  has  agreed  to  make  monthly
payments  of  $48.66  on  the  balance.  He  did  not  provide  evidence  of  when  he  filed  his
2019  through  2022  state  tax  returns.  The  document  he  provided  from  the  state
presumably includes all tax liabilities. (AE K, M, O, P)
Applicant testified that prior to his bankruptcy he paid his bills. He said he made
difficult  choices because  he  knew the  negative  implications.  He  said  he  needed  some
breathing room and that is why he chose to file bankruptcy. He did the best he could. He
wants to and intends to pay his delinquent debts. He is trying to the best of his ability to
resolve his financial issues. He does not have a written budget. (Tr. 148-154)
In  his  post-hearing  submission,  Applicant  stated  that  his  financial  journey  has
profoundly affected him, highlighting his lack of complete control over his situation. He
said he took full responsibility for his actions and apologized. He also provided an email
addressed to me stating he decided he had two options regarding his finances. The first
is to refinance his home and use the equity to satisfy all his debts in full. The second is to
sell his house and use the profit from the sale to pay his debts. Until one of those options
is  completed,  he  will  continue  to  make  monthly  payments  on  his  debts.  He  hopes  to
complete whatever option he decides in 30 to 45 days. (AE F)
Three  witnesses testified  on  Applicant’s behalf. They were  aware  he  went through
some  tough  times after his  divorce  but were unaware  of  him  defaulting  on  his  debts.  They
were  aware  he  filed  bankruptcy  but then  withdrew from  it. They believe  he  is financially
responsible. They did not have  anything  negative  to  say about his  character.   (Tr. 169-
182)
Character  letters  were  admitted  in  evidence.  In  them,  Applicant  is described  as
professional, dedicated, trustworthy, diligent, and responsible. He is a person of integrity
who abides by rules and regulations and has an impeccable work ethic. He respects the
law and is committed to maintaining confidentiality. Applicant is dedicated to improving
his financial situation. He has consistently worked hard to address his financial challenges
and is highly recommended for security clearance. (AE C, D, E)
