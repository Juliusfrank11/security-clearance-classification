Psychological Conditions  and Alcohol Consumption
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges that  in about November 2006, Applicant was diagnosed with
PTSD, Depression, Anxiety, and Alcohol Dependence. He received alcohol detoxification
from a clinic. In 2002, he drank excessively when his first marriage ended. (Tr1. 105, 108;
GE 5 at 11) He was feeling nervous and anxious after his deployment to Egypt, and he
decided to discuss it with a mental-health counselor. (Tr1. 64-65, 103) He was diagnosed
with PTSD. (Tr1. 63) He was prescribed Wellbutrin, an antidepressant, Decampere, anti-
alcohol, and Trazodone to help him sleep. (Tr1. 65-66) He also received psychotherapy
for  three  to  ten  days.  (Tr1.  66)  He  frequently  attended  Alcoholics  Anonymous  (AA)
meetings in  the 2004 to  2006 timeframe. (Tr1.  67, 105,  109) Both of  his parents  were
alcoholics, and he indicated he may have a genetic predisposition towards alcoholism.
(Tr1. 104) After each alcohol treatment, he was “pretty much [told] don’t drink alcohol, go
to [AA] meetings.” (Tr1. 109)
SOR  ¶   1.b   alleges  that  in  about  2012,  Applicant  completed   alcohol-related
treatment,  and  in  2013, he  relapsed. He  attended  some  group  meetings at  a  clinic and
some  AA  meetings. (Tr1.  68) He believed  the  treatment he  was receiving  was ineffective
and  a  waste  of time. (Tr1.  69, 118) His marriage  fell  apart, and  he  lost  his job. (Tr1.  69-
70,  119)  These   factors  contributed   to   his  relapse.  (Tr1.   69)  He  used   alcohol  to   self-
medicate. (Tr1.  70)
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges that in about October 2013, Applicant received alcohol-related
treatment and completed detoxification at a clinic. The alcohol-related treatment was on
an outpatient basis, and he went every couple of weeks. (Tr1. 71, 120) He went to the
treatment primarily for medication management. (Tr1. 71) An April 23, 2014 VA progress
note  states  that  Appellant  said  he  had  a  relapse  in  October  2013.  (GE  5  at  11)  “The
incident  led  his  employer  to  require  him  to  complete  an  alcohol  rehabilitation  program
prior to returning to work. He completed [a program] and is currently active in Alcoholics
Anonymous.”  (Id.)  The  note  does  not  describe  “the  incident.”  The  April  23,  2014  VA
progress  note  states  Applicant  had  consumed  alcohol  before  his  VA  appointment  and
Applicant believed it was unsafe for him to drive home in his vehicle. (Id. at 16) The VA
called a cab, which took him from the VA to his residence. (Id.)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges that from November 20 to 25, 2013, Applicant received alcohol-
related inpatient treatment from a clinic, and he was diagnosed with Alcohol Use Disorder
(moderate,  in  early  remission),  Major  Depressive  Disorder,  and  Cluster  B  personality
traits. Applicant agreed with the summary in SOR ¶ 1.d. (Tr1. 73, 121; SOR response)
The  therapy  at  the  clinic  entailed  attending  classes  and  AA  meetings.  (Tr1.  74)  He
indicated  that  he  was sober for two  years in November 2013.  (Tr1.  121;  AE  M (check
cite)) A VA progress note states that Applicant had a significant relapse in October 2013,
and  “The  incident led  his employer to  require  him  to  complete  an  alcohol rehabilitation
program  prior to  returning  to  work.” (AE  H at 3  (VA  page  22)) The VA record said that
Applicant said:
He was required  to  go  to  alcohol rehabilitation  in October 2013, in  order to
keep  his job, and  he  returned  [to  work]  in January 2014. .  . .  The  veteran
denied  any legal problems or significant behavioral disturbances  other than
his excessive  drinking  that  led  his employer  to  require  that  he  complete  an
alcohol rehabilitation  program in October 2013  in order to  keep  his job. (AE
H at 2-3 (VA pages  21-22))
Applicant  denied  that  his employer required  him  to  attend  alcohol rehabilitation  to  retain
his employment. (Tr1. 147-148) After he was confronted  with  the  progress note, he said,
“Yes, and I  don’t, I  don't know where  that’s coming  from. It says [he] had  to go to alcohol
rehab  in order to  keep  his job. I don’t  recall  that.  I don’t  know where that's from.” (Tr1.
150) He denied  that he  ever lost his job  due  to  drinking.  (Tr1. 122) He said,  “I didn’t lose
my job. I never,  I never lost  my job.” (Tr. 122-123) He said  he  lost  his job  because  the
contract ended and was not rebid. (Tr1. 123)
SOR  ¶  1.e  alleges  that  from  November  25,  2013,  to  about  January  1,  2014,
Applicant received 37 days of residential treatment for Anxiety, PTSD, and Depression at
a clinic. Applicant agreed with the summary in SOR ¶ 1.e. (Tr1. 74; SOR response) He
successfully completed the treatment program. (Tr1. 123)
SOR ¶ 1.f alleges that from about January 10, 2014, to about January 14, 2014,
Applicant  received  Alcohol  Detox  treatment  at  a  VA  medical  center.  He  did  not  recall
whether he had a relapse after leaving the clinic on January 1, 2014. (Tr1. 75) He did not
remember whether there was a triggering event for his relapse. (Tr1. 123) The treatment
in January 2014 may have been for aftercare rather than detox. (Tr1. 75)
SOR ¶ 1.g alleges that from about March 3, 2014, to about May 2014, Applicant
received treatment at a VA hospital for PTSD, Major Depressive Disorder (Recurring with
Moderate  Severity),  Alcohol  Use  Disorder  (Severe),  and  Mild  Neurocognitive  Disorder
related to TBI. Applicant sought treatment at the VA hospital because “everything kind of
started  falling  apart.”  (Tr1.  76)  He  remembered  being  at  the  VA  hospital;  however, he
could not remember too much about what occurred there. (Tr1. 77) VA treatment records
for May 2014 indicate he was drinking 12-18 beers a day. (GE 5 at 15-16; AE P at 7) He
had attended rehabilitation for alcohol on five previous occasions. (AE P at 7) Before his
11 am appointment on May 8, 2014, he had consumed three beers. (GE 5 at 16; AE P at
12)
On  August  23,  2014,  Applicant’s  insurance  company  called  the  police  and
informed  them  that  Applicant  was  at  his  residence;  he  was  suffering  from  alcohol
poisoning; and the caller requested a welfare check. (GE 3 at 31-32) The police entered
his  residence  and  observed  garbage,  beer  cans,  and  fecal  matter  strewn  about  his
residence. (Id.) Applicant was transported to a VA medical center. (Id.) This incident is
not listed in the SOR, and it will not be considered for disqualification purposes.
SOR ¶ 1.h alleges that from about December 16, 2014, to about December 24,
2017, Applicant received treatment from the VA for Alcohol Use Disorder, and he received
alcohol detoxification. He failed to follow treatment advice to refrain from alcohol use.
SOR ¶ 1.i alleges that from about  February 2017 to about May 2017, Applicant
received  inpatient  hospitalization  at  a  VA  hospital  for  PTSD.  Applicant  believed  the
treatment he  received  in  2017  was  the  most  effective.  (Tr1.  77-78)  The  facility focused  on
PTSD and  mindfulness. (Tr1.  78) He  also  received  medication  management.  (Tr1.  78)  He
attended  AA  meetings at night.  (Tr1.  78) He finally accepted  that he  was an  alcoholic and
he  needed  to  take  sobriety one  day at a  time.  (Tr1.  79, 98) A  March  29, 2017, VA  Disability
Benefits  Questionnaire   states,  “Alcohol  is  drug   of  choice.   Became   a   problem   in  2005
when   he   returned   from   Egypt.   Has  had   periods  of   abstinence   over  the   years: one   [to]
three  years but a  lot  of roller coaster. Currently has been  abstinent since  2  January 2017.”
(AE Q at 98)
SOR ¶  1.j  alleges that on  March  18, 2021,  a  licensed  psychologist,  Dr. B,  evaluated
Applicant’s mental health  at   the  request of   security officials. Dr. B   diagnosed  Applicant
with   PTSD,  Major  Depressive  Disorder  (Moderate,  Recurrent),  Generalized   Anxiety
Disorder, and  Alcohol Use Disorder (Severe).  (GE 4 at 7) Dr. B is a  clinical psychologist.
(GE  4   at   7)   Applicant   said   he   remembered   taking   a   test   on-line;   however,   he   did  not
remember Dr. B’s interview of him.  (Tr1.  80-81)  He said  he  was “a  little guarded” during
the  interview because  he  “didn’t know what  this was about” and,  he  “didn’t know that [he]
had  to  fight to keep [his] clearance  again.” (Tr1.  81) He denied that he lied to Dr. B. (Tr1.
82) Dr. B  noted  that Applicant told another evaluator that in  2016  his last  drink was in
2016; however,  he  told  Dr. B  that  his last drink was in  2014.  (Tr1.  82) Applicant said he
did not “recall  that.” (Tr1.  82)  He was  upset when  he  read  Dr. B’s report because  of  the
comments about his lack of candor. (Tr1. 153-154)
Dr.  B  noted  that  Applicant  “maintained  the  belief  that  he  had  a  brief  bout  of
substance  abuse  treatment at the  VA  in 2014  and that he has been  sober ever since.”
(GE  4  at  6)  He  relapsed  after  2014.  (Id.)  He  omitted  disclosure  of  alcohol-related
treatment from February to May 2017 at a VA facility. (Id. at 4, 6) She indicated Applicant
“has  a  history  of  underreporting  and  withholding  information.  His  tendency  to  omit
pertinent  details  of  his  behavioral  health  history  may  have  [led]  previous  evaluators  to
formulate  inaccurate  conclusions.”  (Id.)  Dr.  B  concluded  that  it  would  be  imprudent  to
grant Applicant access to classified information, and stated:
[Applicant]  is clearly  a  troubled  man  who  has been  using  alcohol  to  cope
with  severe mental  health  symptoms  for many years. While  his history of
inpatient  care  and  multiple responses is  problematic,  his  poor insight and
candor  issues  are  of  greatest  concern.   The   degree   to   which   he   withheld
information  throughout  the  security vetting  process (2016  to  present) was
indicative  of  intentional  concealment, which  brings his  overall  credibility into
question. (GE 4  at  7)
At his hearing, Applicant said his last drink of alcohol was on November 3, 2017,
and  he  has  been  sober  for  almost  six  years.  (Tr1.  82,  89)  He  remembered  the  date
because he had completed Step Four with his sponsor. (Tr1. 79, 83) He listed the dates,
times, and group names for his attendance at AA meetings in June and July 2021. (GE 2
at 74) He speaks to his AA sponsor about every day. (Tr1. 83) His sponsor did not want
to be involved in Applicant’s security clearance hearing because he had some issues with
law enforcement, and AA is anonymous. (Tr1. 83)
Applicant attends AA meetings three or four days a week. (Tr1. 90) He contacts
his sponsor if he has a craving for alcohol. (Tr1. 91) He has a stable home life, and he is
more mature. (Tr1. 90) He joined a church a few months before his hearing. (Tr1. 93) His
PTSD is less significant in his life now that he has retired from the Army. (Tr1. 93) He
regularly  sees  a  VA  counselor,  and  he  plans  to  call  the  VA  crisis  line  if  his  PTSD  is
becoming difficult for him to control. (Tr1. 94) He has the tools to maintain his sobriety.
(Tr1. 90)
SOR ¶ 2.a alleges from about 2002 to at least 2017, Applicant consumed alcohol
to excess and to the point of intoxication. Applicant said he began drinking heavily in 2003
or 2004. (Tr1. 50) Before he deployed, he drank as “a way to cope.” (Tr1. 51) After his
deployment, he drank as a way to self-medicate. (Tr1. 51) Alcohol helped him to relax.
(Tr1.  51)  After  he  returned  from  Egypt,  his  drinking  increased.  (Tr1.  52)  He  said  he
stopped drinking alcohol in 2017. (Tr1. 53) He received assistance from AA. (Tr1. 53-54)
Between  2014  and  2017,  he  did  “not  consciously”  consume  excessive  amounts  of
alcohol. (Tr1. 132) After 2017, he went to AA meetings. (Tr1. 133)
SOR  ¶   2.b   alleges  in   about   September  30,   2014,   Applicant  was   arrested   and
charged   with   driving   under  the   influence   of  alcohol  (DUI).  Applicant  bumped   a   parked
vehicle  when  he  was  parking  his vehicle. (Tr1.  56,  127-130; GE  3  at  23) The  damage  to
the   other  vehicle   was  not  extensive,   and   no   one   was  injured.  (Tr1.   58-59)  The   police
arrived,  and   Applicant   failed   a   field  sobriety  test.   (Tr1.   56;  GE   3   at   27)  Applicant’s
breathalyzer  result  was  .085.   (Tr1.   57,   128;   GE   3   at  28)  He   was   arrested   for  reckless
driving  and  Operating  Motor Vehicle  Under the  Influence  (DUI). (GE  3  at 26, 28) At his
security clearance  hearing  he  said unaware  when  he  was charged  that he  was charged
with  DUI.  (Tr1. 130) He pleaded  guilty to,  and  he  was convicted  of,  reckless driving. (Tr1.
58) He was not prosecuted for DUI. (Tr1.  59)
SOR  ¶  2.c  alleges  in  about  October  2014,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged
with DUI. Applicant hit the back corner of an unoccupied vehicle, which was parked near
his residence. (Tr1. 59, 62; GE 3 at 8) Applicant drove a short distance away and parked
his  vehicle  at  his  residence.  (Id.)  The  same  police  officer  who  was  involved  in  his
September 2014 DUI arrest arrived and assumed he had been drinking. (Tr1. 60; GE 3
at 14) Applicant had not consumed any alcohol prior to the accident. (Tr1. 62) The police
searched his vehicle and found a BB or pellet imitation firearm in the back of his vehicle.
(Tr1. 60, 131; GE 3 at 11, 12) His breathalyzer result was 0.00. (Tr1. 62; GE 3 at 14) He
also provided a urine sample for testing. (GE 3 at 12, 15, 17) Applicant denied that he
was  aware that he  was  being arrested for DUI.  (Tr1.  131)  Applicant  was charged with
Unlawful  Possession  of  an  Imitation  Firearm,  Leaving  the  Scene  of  an  Accident,
Operating a Motor Vehicle Under the Influence; and Operating an Unregistered Vehicle.
(GE 3 at 11) He believed he was arrested for possession of an illegal firearm. (Tr1. 131)
He  found  out  he  was charged  with  DUI  and  possession  of  an  illegal  firearm  when  the
charges were sent. (Tr1. 62, 132) He was convicted of reckless driving, and he received
a $158 fine. (Tr1. 60)
SOR ¶ 2.d cross alleges under the alcohol consumption guideline, the information
in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.j, which are alleged under the psychological conditions guideline.
Applicant  denied that he had  ever been terminated from his employment because
of  drinking.  (Tr1.  139)  However,  a   May  8,  2014   progress  note   states  “Veteran   called
directly [his]  case  manager reporting  to  have  recently been  fired  from  his job  and  abuses
alcohol drinking  12-18  beers a day.”  (Tr1. 140; GE 5 at 16)  At his hearing, he said he  did
not  “recall  ever saying” that he  had  been  fired. (Tr1.  141) He  suggested  his  memory in
2014  may have  been  affected  by his alcohol  consumption  and  TBI.  (Tr1. 142) However,
he did not believe  his TBI affected his ability to perform  his job today. (Tr1.  142)
Dr. G’s  Evaluation
Dr. G is a VA clinical psychologist. On July 27, 2021, Dr. G said Applicant has been
receiving VA treatment at his location since 2019. (GE 2 at 72) Dr. G diagnosed Applicant
with PTSD and Alcohol Abuse in Sustained Remission. (GE 2 at 72) Dr. G summarized
his current treatment and prognosis as follows:
He . .  . engaged  in  individual therapy from  July 2019  to  November  2020.
Individual therapy was  discontinued  because  he  had  successfully met all  of
his individual therapy treatment goals and  had  successfully developed  an
ongoing   recovery  plan.  He  currently  continues  to   be   seen   for medication
management,  through   our  clinic.  He  has  been   an   active   participant  in
treatment and  compliant with  treatment recommendations. In  regards to  his
treatment goals,  he  has made  significant progress in obtaining  his goals and
is currently maintaining those gains. (GE 2  at  72)
Dr. W’s Evaluation
On  July 20, 2023, Dr. W  provided  an  evaluation  of Applicant’s mental health. (AE
TT)  Dr. W  is a  clinical psychologist  who  focuses on  treatment of PTSD. (Tr1. 156, 163)
She  did  not review  Applicant’s medical  records because  she  did not  have  time. (Tr1.  164)
She  reviewed  Dr. B’s  report,  and  she  discussed  Dr.  B’s report with  Applicant.  (Tr1.  164-
165)  Applicant   had   26   sessions   with   Dr.  W   over  the   previous   5   ½   months.   (Id.)  She
diagnosed  him  with  PTSD. (Tr1. 157-158; AE  TT) She  said he  is dedicated  to  attendance
at AA  meetings. (Tr1. 159)  She  does not believe  Applicant has consumed  alcohol in the
last  six months.  (Tr1.  159) She  concurred  with   Dr. G, that   Applicant’s “alcoholism   is in
remission  and that he  has met all [of] his treatment goals and objectives.” (AE TT)
Dr. W  opined  that Applicant was  being  honest with  her about  his symptoms  and
mental-health  history. (Tr1. 160) Applicant has memory issues from  his PTSD. (Tr1. 166)
His  prognosis
is  good.  (Tr1.   160)  In   response   to   Applicant’s  question   about
recommendations to  ensure he  does not relapse  or his PTSD manifest does not itself in
a  negative  way,  Dr. W  said he  should receive psychotherapy  to  help with  the  traumatic
events he  experienced  in childhood  and  during  his military service. (Tr1. 161) In  her report
Dr. W said:
The  prognosis for [Applicant]  is very good,  given  his  willingness and  ability
to   comply   with   continued   aftercare.   Recovery  of  symptoms  is  possible.
Outcomes  for him  are  improved  with  continued  coping  skills and  symptom
awareness and  management.
[Applicant]   does  not  have   any  condition   that  calls  his  trustworthiness,
judgment,  or  reliability into  question. I believe  [Applicant]  has been  honest
with  me  about his  issues. We  discussed  in detail  his past alcohol abuse. He
appears  to   be   a   stable   and   well-adjusted   individual,   given   the   PTSD,
Anxiety, and  Depression  that he  has  suffered  in  the  past.  Other than  PTSD,
he does not exhibit other symptoms. (AE TT at 3)
Mr. B’s Comments
Mr. B is a VA outpatient clinical psychiatric mental health nurse practitioner. (AE
VV) On July 5, 2023, Mr. B said, “To date, [Applicant] has been actively engaged in his
outlined treatment plan. He [is] compliant with medications and with all requests outlined
by this provider.” (AE VV) Mr. B did not provide a diagnosis or a prognosis.
Personal Conduct
SOR ¶¶ 3.a, 3.b, and 3.c allege Applicant falsified material facts on his June 20,
questions.
“No,”
answered,
following
2016  SCA  when
the
he
to
(1) “Section  24-Use  of Alcohol Sought  Counseling  or Treatment Have  you  EVER
voluntarily sought counseling  or treatment as a  result of your use  of alcohol?” He  failed
to   disclose   the   information   in  SOR  ¶¶   1.a   through   1.h.   (GE  1   at  35)  In   the   Optional
Comment section  he  said,  “I attend  AA  meetings regularly. Spoke  with  a  VA  psychiatrist
in 2011 regarding alcohol use related to PTSD  issues.” (Tr1. 136; GE 1 at 35)
(2) and  (3) “Section  22-Police  Record-Summary In  the  past seven  (7) years have
you been charged, convicted, or sentenced  of a crime in any court?” Applicant disclosed
the  October 2014  vehicle accident and  arrest  for possession of an  imitation  firearm. (GE
1  at 31) He  said  the  offense  was downgraded  to  “Petty Disorderly Persons Offense,” and
he received  a $158 fine. (GE 1 at 31-32) He  did not disclose the DUI charges.
Applicant’s 2016  SCA  also asked,  “In  the  last seven  years  has  your use  of alcohol
had  a  negative  impact  on  your  work performance.  . . or resulted  in  intervention  by  law
enforcement/public  safety personnel?”  He   said, “No.”  (GE   1   at   35)  It asked,   “Have   you
EVER received  counseling  or treatment  as a  result of your use  of alcohol  in addition  to
what  you   have   already  listed   on   this  form?”  Applicant   said,  “No,”   and   in   the   Optional
Comment section said, “I attend AA  meetings regularly.” (GE 1 at 35)
Applicant  had previously completed  SCAs  during  his Army  career. (Tr1.  86) He
said when he was completing his 2016 SCA he did not remember all of the places he
attended for alcohol treatment or when he received treatment at the facilities. (Tr1. 84)
He said no because he did not want to provide the additional specific information which
would have been required to complete the SCA. (Tr1. 135-136) He expected he would be
meeting  with  an  investigator  in  about  30  days,  and  he  planned  to  disclose  his alcohol
treatment to the investigator. (Tr1. 84, 144) No one ever told him that it was okay to omit
information on the SCA and provide the information later to an investigator. (Tr1. 145)
Applicant believed when he was completing the SCA, if he answered, yes, then he
would not be able to proceed on the form without providing specific information. (Tr1. 85)
Also,  the  form  cannot  be  saved,  and  an  applicant  must  restart  the  form  if  it  is  not
completed. (Tr1. 85) However, he repeatedly indicated on his SCA “estimated” for dates,
(GE 1 at 9-13, 17-18, 21-26), and in other locations, he utilized the “Optional Comment”
function  to  indicate  “I  do  not  have  this  information”  or  “I  do  not  know  place  of  birth
information.” (GE 1 at 22)
Applicant denied that he was trying to hide or deceive security. (Tr1. 85, 87) He
signed a consent form or waiver to allow the investigator to obtain his treatment records.
(Tr1. 87) He said he disclosed the information missing from his SCA to the investigator.
(Tr1. 85) He said he thought he wrote on the form that he had alcohol issues, and he
would explain it to the investigator later. (Tr1. 145-146) He did not have any draft SCA
forms. (Tr1. 146) He did not remember ever being referred for alcohol counseling. (Tr1.
146-147) However, a treatment note indicates he was referred for alcohol treatment or
counseling. (Tr1. 147; AE H at 21) He said the treatment note was accurate except for
the part about having to go to alcohol treatment to keep his job. (Tr1. 150)
According to Applicant’s August 8, 2016 OPM personal subject interview (PSI), he
initially told the investigator that he stopped consuming alcohol in late 2014; however, he
said he most recently drank a beer in June 2016. (GE 2 at 18) He was asked three times
to  disclose  additional  alcohol-related  treatments,  and  he  denied  additional  treatments.
(Tr1. 137-138; GE 2 at 18) Then the investigator would name a particular treatment entity,
and Applicant would admit receiving alcohol-related treatment at that facility. (Tr1. 138;
GE  2  at  18)  He  attributed  his  failure  to  disclose  the  treatments  until  the  investigator
confronted  him  with  the  facts  to  his  lack  of  recollection  or  inability  to  remember  or
alternatively to oversight and not having the details available to him at the time he was
completing his SCA. (Tr1. 139; GE 2 at 18, 21)
Applicant  did  not  disclose  his  DUI  offense  because  he  was  only  convicted  of
reckless driving. (Tr1. 87) He  said, “Maybe  I  read  the  question  wrong  and  just  thought
charge meant the same thing as conviction. Are you a lawyer? No, I’m not.” (Tr1. 88) He
is aware that there would be police reports and court records, and those records would
be available to investigators. (Tr1. 89)
In his August 17, 2016 OPM PSI, Applicant disclosed the details of his two arrests
in September to October 2014 without being confronted with the facts. (GE 2 at 17) He
said he did not list the September 2014 arrest and the DUI component of the October
2014 arrest on his SCA due to oversight. (GE 2 at 17)

Applicant told Dr. B or the OPM investigator or both that he was sober from 2006
to 2011. (Tr1. 113; GE 2 at 17; GE 4 at 4) In March 2011, he returned from Iraq, locked
himself into a hotel room and drank 12 six packs of beer over several days. (Tr1. 114; GE
2 at 17-18; GE 5 at 11) He described himself as “a chronic relapse” from 2004 to 2011.
(Tr1. 115) He did not actually get sober until 2017. (Tr1. 117)
Applicant said  he  could  not afford  to  pay his mortgage  in  2014. (Tr1.  125) Applicant
said his mortgage  company foreclosed  on  his residence. (Tr1. 125) Department Counsel
raised  the  issue  of Applicant’s failure  to  disclose  the  foreclosure  of  his residence  on  his
2016  SCA.  (Tr1. 126) Applicant responded  that the  foreclosure was not in 2016; however,
he  did not remember when  it  occurred. (Tr1.  127) A  December 16,  2014  progress  note
states  that  Applicant  is  unable  to  pay  his mortgage  and  his house  is  in foreclosure.  (GE
6  at  12, 23) In  Section  26-Financial  Record  of his SCA,  Applicant disclosed  his delinquent
child  support debt,  and  in the  Optional  Comment section  he  said,  “My wife  and  I separated
in  2011.  Our divorce   was  final  in   2014.  In   2014,   I   faced   numerous   financial  difficulties
resulting  from  loss of income. I am  currently rectifying  many of those  issues.” (GE 1  at
39)  Applicant disclosed  sufficient information  on  his SCA about “financial difficulties” to
mitigate  concerns about his foreclosure not being  listed  on his SCA.  The  foreclosure will
not be further discussed in this decision.
In the additional comments at the end of his SCA, Applicant said:
Regarding  Alcohol Treatment:  In  2004,  I entered  Alcoholics Anonymous for
the  first time,  and  have  been  going  to  these  meeting  ever since. Please  note
that  I  have   never  been   reprimanded,  nor  fired   from   any  employment
regarding  my previous alcohol use. I am  currently a  lieutenant colonel in the
United  States Army Reserve and  have  never received  any sort of punitive
action   during   my
I  violated   my
responsibilities  in  maintaining   my  security  clearance-now  over  25   years
holding  a  security clearance. I am  a  trustworthy and  reliable candidate. (GE

Applicant provided a heartfelt and sincere closing statement:
Alcohol,   and   my  recovery  from   it,  has  been   brought  up   and   it’s  probably
going to be further brought up. You know, unfortunately for me, the  subject
of alcoholism and  my past issues [were] not high points in my life.
The toughest issue I  had to  experience was acceptance. And just basically
being  able to  finally admit to  myself and  say in an  AA  meeting. Hello  my
name is [Applicant]  and I’m  an  alcoholic.
I’ve  since  retired  from  military service, but I  continue  to  support the  Army in
my current employment.  I’m  very proud  of my  military service. But I‘m  also
very proud  of  the  work that I’m  currently doing  as a  Government  employee.
I am a devoted  patriot.  I’ve  spent my entire  life  working  and  supporting  this
country. And  I do  love  this country deeply. I am  very hopeful, I’m  hopeful for
a  future where I can  continue  to  contribute  and  continue  to  work in  a  role
that  I love.  I hope  that  you  will  take  that  in  consideration. Thank  you.   (Tr1.
