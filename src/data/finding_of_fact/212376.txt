As  a  preface,  I did  not  find  Applicant credible.  I  accept  little of  his testimony  as
true  unless  it  has  been  verified  by  an  independent  source.  Some  facts  cannot  be
verified because he told multiple versions of facts and events.
Applicant  is  a  38-year-old  prospective  employee  of  a  defense  contractor
sponsoring him for a security  clearance. He was born in a foreign country.  He worked
for  a  defense  contractor  in  Iraq  before  he  immigrated  to  the  United  States  in  2008.
Since  then,  he  has  worked  for  several  defense  contractors,  sometimes  overseas.  He
became  a  U.S.  citizen  in  2015.  He  held  a  security  clearance  in  the  past,  but  it  lapsed
when he was no longer employed by his sponsor. He has attended several colleges and
universities,  earning  an  associate  degree  from  one  of  the  colleges  in  about  2015.  He
married  in  about  2018  and  divorced  in  about  2020  or  2021.  He  has  one  child.

Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
February  2018.  He  reported  that  he  attended  three  colleges  or  universities  between
2010  and  2015,  and  that  he  received  an  associate  degree  from  the  last  university  in
November  2015.  When  he  was  interviewed  for  his  background  investigation  in
November 2018, he reported that he married a foreign citizen in a foreign country a few
weeks earlier. (GE 2, 3)
Applicant  worked  for  a  defense  contractor  (DC1)  from  July  2017  to  September
2017. He was rehired by DC1 in February 2020, and he resigned for personal reasons
in March 2020. He was rehired again in November 2020. (Tr. at 16; GE 6)
DC1  reported  that  Applicant  traveled  to  a  foreign  country  for  about  five  days  in
February 2021 while he was on COVID-exposure quarantine. He then returned to work
the  day  after  he  arrived  back  in  the  United  States,  “which  was  a  violation  of  [DC1]
Attestation policy.” DC1 security representatives discovered that Applicant did not report
foreign  family  members  and  foreign  travel  on  his  pre-screening  questionnaire  (PSQ)
that  he  submitted  in  December  2020.  They  conducted  a  travel  debrief  with  him.  He
stated that his recent foreign travel was related to a request by a “distant cousin” to sign
a  medical  release  form  so  that  she  could  undergo  a  medical  procedure.  During  his
background  interview  in  November  2022,  Applicant  stated  that  he  went  to  the  foreign
country to give his divorce papers to his ex-wife. (Tr. at 17-26, 30; GE 3, 4)
Applicant  testified  that  he  had  to  go  to  the  foreign  country  for  a  “family
emergency” because his cousin, who he referred to as his sister, required surgery, and
he also had to serve divorce papers on his ex-wife. He stated he did not know that, as a
clearance  holder,  he  had  to  inform  his  employer  that  he  was  traveling  to  another
country. He was on  COVID hold during that period, and he was not reporting to work.
He stated that he thought it was acceptable to report the foreign travel upon his return,
which is what he did. (Tr. at 18-26)
Applicant  was  on  a  leave  of  absence  from  DC1  from  March  2021  to  the
beginning of June 2021. He worked in Afghanistan for another defense contractor (DC2)
from about March 2021 to June 2021. He worked for DC2 in Africa for about two weeks
in  September  2021.  DC1  security  representatives  interviewed  him  upon  his  return  to
work  in  June  2021.  He  was  asked  if  he  had  any  foreign  travel  since  his  last  trip  in
February 2021. He said he could not remember, and he was not sure, before he denied
any additional foreign travel. (Tr. at 26-28; GE 4)
DC1  became  aware  that  Applicant  traveled  out  of  the  country  while  he  was  on
the leave of absence. He was interviewed again later in June 2021. He admitted that he
worked for DC2 in Afghanistan in March 2021. He stated that DC1 was not paying him,
and he needed to make money to pay his bills. He stated that he did not feel that he had
to  report  the  travel  because  he  was  working  for  the  U.S.  military  and  the  federal
government,  and  he  considered  it  “official  travel.”  DC1  terminated  his  employment  in
July 2021 for misconduct for “numerous incidents of unreported foreign travel. Several
of which were to high threat countries,” and for failure to cooperate with investigators by
deliberately providing false information about his foreign travel. (Tr. at 17, 26-33; GE 4,
5)
Applicant submitted another SF 86 in May 2022. He denied intentionally falsifying
any question on the SF 86. He pointed out multiple mistakes on innocuous questions as
proof  that  “[a]ll  of  these  omissions  happened  because  [he]  did  not  correct  the
information  the  computer  entered  in  error  for  [him].”(Tr.  at  64-75,  79-81;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 1) He testified:
these
Most  of
things  are  based   on   pure  negligence,   mistakes,
carelessness on my part and not knowing  or  understanding  the  question  --
what  the   question   is   asking.  And   honestly,   this  job   was   --  I   was   rushing
through  it. I had  somewhere to  go  and  I wanted  just  to  leave  because  this
lady  was   on   the   phone   --  my   security   lady   was  rushing   me   to   finish   and
send  it over to  her.  So  I didn’t  have  the  time  to  finally go  back and  look at
some of these questions.  (Tr. at 64)
Applicant reported on the SF 86 that he was born in a foreign country, came to
the  United  States  in  2008,  and  became  a  U.S.  citizen  in  2015.  He  inaccurately
answered “No” to the question that asked: “Have you EVER been issued a passport (or
identity card for travel) by a country other than the U.S?” He denied that the answer was
intentionally  false.  He  stated  that  he  did  not  think  about  his  expired  passport  when
answering  the  question.  He  testified  that  his mother  has  renewed his foreign  passport
without his knowledge, but he did not learn that fact until after he submitted the SF 86.
(Tr. at 45-54, 68-69; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1)
Applicant  reported  on  the  SF  86  that  he  attended  five  colleges  or  universities
between 2010 and 2022. He reported that he earned five associate degrees, including
from two colleges in August 2012 and December 2012. He testified that was a mistake,
and he did not have degrees from those colleges. He stated that he completed the SF
86  in  a  rush,  and  he  did  not  look  back  at  his  answers.  (Tr.  at  57-59;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 1)
On  the  SF  86,  under  Section  13A  –  Employment  Activities,  Applicant  failed  to
report his work for DC2 from about March 2021 to June 2021 and again in September
2021. He reported the job with DC1. He falsely reported the reason for leaving the DC1
job  was  “work  ended  due  to  COVID-19.”  (Tr.  at  41;  GE  1)  He  also  provided  false
information when he answered “no” to the following question:
For  this  employment  have  any  of  the  following  happened  to  you  in  the
last seven (7) years?
•   Fired
•   Quit after being  told you would be  fired
•   Left   by  mutual  agreement  following   charges  or  allegations  of
misconduct
•   Left   by  mutual  agreement
following   notice   of   unsatisfactory
performance1
Section  13C –  Employment Record of the  SF 86  asked  similar questions to  the
above, except   it asked: “Have  any of   the  following  happened  to  you   in the  last seven
(7) years  at employment activities that you  have  not previously listed?  (If ‘Yes’, you  will
be   required   to   add   an   additional  employment  in  Section   13A.”  (italicized   emphasis
added) Since  any issues that would  have  required  a positive response  occurred at DC1,
which   Applicant  previously  listed,  he   correctly  answered   “No”  to   this  specific  question.
(GE 1)
Applicant  stated  that he  reported  that his “work [for DC1] ended  due  to  COVID-
19”   because   he   was   on   hold   due  to   COVID at  the   time.   He  stated   that he   “mistakenly
focused on  the  root cause of [his]  termination  from  [DC1]  which  was  because  of COVID-
19   instead  of  just admitting  that   [he]   was  terminated.”   (Tr. at   33-36, 40-41;  Applicant’s
response to SOR)
Applicant testified that he did not report his work for DC2 because he thought he
did not have to report that work because he “was doing a government service.” He also
indicated that “it was a short amount of time and [he] thought it wasn’t important.” (Tr. at
42-44) In his response to interrogatories, he wrote the following as the reason he did not
report his job with DC2:
No  I did not list these  employments because  reason  (1) I totally forgot due
to   the   fact  that  they   [were]   both   too   short  especially   the   employment  in
Africa   wasn’t   a   good   fit  for  me[.]   I  was   only   there  for  two   weeks.  I   might
have  just  confuse[d]  them  to  be  international travel for  work,  which  is not
required  to  report or listed since it’s work related travel. (GE  3)
Under Section 17 – Marital/Relationship Status, Applicant failed to report his ex-
wife,  and  he  falsely  wrote  that  he  had  “[n]ever  entered  into  a  civil  marriage,  legally
recognized civil union, or legally recognized domestic partnership.” He stated that he did
not  report  his  marriage  because  he  was  divorced,  and  he  did  not  realize  he  had  to
report previous marriages. He added, “We didn’t get married in the church or mosques,
so  maybe  that’s  probably  why.  It  was  just  family  arrangement.  It’s  a civil  - - I  don’t
know.” He later added, “And then the marriage part, it was just because I knew the lady

was never going to come here.” (Tr. at 59-61, 72-73; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE
1, 3)
Under Section 20C – Applicant reported several foreign trips, including his trip in
February 2021. He did not report his work in Afghanistan and Africa for DC2 in 2021. He
testified that  he did  not  report  those trips  because  they  were  work-related  trips  for the
DoD. (Tr. at 36-40; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1)
Applicant  was  interviewed  for  his  background  investigation  in  November  2022.
He  reported  most  of  the  information  addressed  in  this  decision.  He  denied  being
dishonest  with  DC1  personnel,  and  he  denied  intentionally  providing  false  information
on the SF 86. (GE 3)
