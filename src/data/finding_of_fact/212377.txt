Applicant  admitted  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b  and  1.d  through  1.i.  She
denied SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.j, and 1.k. Her answer to SOR ¶ 2.a was ambiguous and will be
considered  a  denial.  Applicant’s  admissions  are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.
After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I
make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 55  years old.  She  earned  some  college  credits but not a  degree. She
was married  twice before her present marriage  in 2020. She  has  an  adult child. She  has
been  employed  by  her present  employer since  September 2021.   She  explained  that in
her present  job  she  works for four to  six  weeks and  then  is  off  for two  to  three  months.
She   has  been   on   Social  Security   disability   since   2007   and   works  part-time.   She   is
participating   in  a   re-entry  work  program   to   determine   when   she   can   return  to   100%
employment.  She  has worked  intermittently since  2007  and  her part-time  jobs subsidize
her  disability  payments.  On   her  November  2021   Questionnaire   for  National  Security
Position  (SF 85) she  disclosed   she  was unemployed  from  2016  to  2021.  Her husband
has medical issues  and  had  heart attacks in 2017  and  2018. In  lieu  of paying  rent,  he  is
the  property manager for the  farm  property  where they  live.   He helps with  the  animals
and  does maintenance  around  the  farm. He has no  outside  employment.  (Tr. 16-23,  30-
31; GE 1)
Applicant attributes her financial issues to  her husband’s medical problems, her
mother’s  failing  health,  and  her  limited  income.  She  also  stated  that  the  pandemic
impacted her because she was unable to find part-time work, and she had to care for her
mother because she did not have home health care. (Tr. 35-36)
The SOR allegations are corroborated by Applicant’s admissions and credit reports
from December 2021, July 2022, and January 2023. (GE 1-5)
In  response  to  questions  about  her  finances  on  her  November  2021  SF  85,
Applicant answered “no” that she did not have bills or debts turned over to a collection
agency.  It  also  asked  if  in  the  past  seven  years  she  had  an  account  or  credit  card
suspended,  charged  off,  or  canceled  for  failing  to  pay  as  agreed,  which  she  also
responded “no.” (GE 1)
When  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  the  government  investigator  in  December
2021, she did not disclose her delinquent debts until she was confronted with them by the
investigator. She acknowledged the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a ($6,305) was for a vehicle that she
purchased in May 2019 and in January 2020 was repossessed when she returned it to
the dealer. She attributed being unable to pay  for it due to the pandemic. She told the
investigator that she would contact the creditor to arrange monthly payments and resolve
the debt within a year. She testified that she moved in with her mother when her mother
needed help. She returned the car because she knew she would not be able to make the
payments. She testified that the cost of her medical bills increased, and she was unable
to make the car payments. She has not resolved the debt because it is her largest, and
she intends to pay it after she pays her other debts. She said she also had some medical
expenses she had to pay. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 24, 45-47; GE 5)
Applicant initially testified that the reason she failed to disclose she had delinquent
debts was because she was confused and nervous and she had recently moved. She
said she had not received inquiries from creditors about her  debts but knew her credit
was  bad.  She  said  she  realized  she  should  have  responded  to  the  SF  85  inquiries
differently.  When  questioned  further, she  admitted  that  she  was  aware  that  she  had a
number of debts that were delinquent and was aware her vehicle had been voluntarily
repossessed. She said she did not intentionally lie about her debts. When asked why she
failed  to  disclose  them,  she  stated,  “because  I  was  afraid  I  wouldn’t  get  the  job.”  She
further stated that her medical issues have an impact on her memory. I find Applicant was
aware  she  had  delinquent  debts  and  was  aware  of  her  duty  to  truthfully  disclose  her
delinquencies and deliberately failed to do so. (Tr. 23, 63-68; GE 1, 5)
Applicant acknowledged the credit card debt in SOR ¶ 1.b ($3,600), which became
delinquent in approximately November 2019. She told the investigator she was unable to
pay it due to insufficient income but intended to satisfy it with monthly payments within
five years. She testified the creditor reached out to her to settle the debt for $1,800. She
said she contacted the creditor in August 2023. She is attempting to settle the debt for a
lump-sum  amount.  In  her  post-hearing  submission,  she  provided  a  document  with  the
settlement offer. She wrote on the document that she intended to accept the offer and
settle the debt by the end of 2023. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. 48-50; GE 2, 3, 4, 5; AE
J, N)
Applicant testified that she paid the collection account in SOR ¶ 1.c ($2,773) for a
delinquent  credit  card.  The  record  was  held  open  for  her  to  provide  documents  to
substantiate her payments. She provided documents to show that she received a letter
from the creditor in June 2022 indicating it had filed a lawsuit against her. She provided
receipts from July, August, and September 2022 showing she paid the amount owed. She
did  not  provide  evidence  that  the  creditor  accepted  her  payments  and  is  no  longer
pursuing legal action, but based on her payments, it appears the debt is resolved. (Tr. 37,
40, 44-45; AE J, K)
Applicant testified that she paid the collection account in SOR ¶ 1.h ($1,614) for a
delinquent credit card. She said the debt date back to 2019. The record was held open
for her to  provide documents  to  substantiate  her payments.  She provided a document
from the  creditor from August 2022 offering her a settlement  agreement. She paid the
settlement amount in December 2022. Although there is no confirmation letter indicating
the debt is resolved, based on the documents it appears it is resolved. (Tr. 37, 40-45; AE
I, J, K, L)
Applicant resolved the collection accounts in SOR ¶¶ 1.d ($2,524-settled for $631)
and 1.e ($2,499-settled for $606) in August 2022 and are reflected as paid on her January
2023 credit report and other documents provided. (Tr. 36-37; GE 4; AE J, O, P)
The   credit  card  debts in  SOR  ¶¶  1.f   ($1,901)  and   1.g   ($1,807)  are   owed   to   the
same  creditor. Regarding  the  debt in SOR ¶ 1.g, Applicant told  the  investigator she  would
contact the  creditor in January 2022  and  arrange  monthly payments  to  satisfy the  debts
in one  year. She  testified  that  she  made  a  partial payment on  the  debt in  SOR ¶ 1.f  and
would provide  documents to  substantiate  her actions. The  record was held open  for her
to  provide  documents  to  substantiate  her payments.  She  provided  a  document  showing
that in  early October 2023  she  made  a  $1,000  payment and  in late  October she  made  a
payment of $901  to  resolve the  balance  owed  on  the  debt.  SOR ¶  1.f  is resolved.  SOR
1.g is not resolved. (GE  2, 3, 4, 5; AE  I,  M)
The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.i ($75) and 1.k ($35) are unpaid medical debts. Applicant
told the investigator that she forgot to pay the debt in SOR ¶ 1.k and she did not know
who  the  creditor  was.  She  intended  to  pay  this  bill.  She  told  the  investigator  that  she
intended to satisfy the debt in SOR ¶ 1.i with a lump-sum payment within six months. She
admitted she has been irresponsible in paying her bills. At her hearing, she testified that
she did not know who the creditor was for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.i, and she took no action
to find out who it might be. The accounts remain unpaid. (Tr. 54-55, 57; GE 2, 3, 4, 5)
The  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.j  ($49)  is  an  unpaid  cable  bill.  She  told  the  government
investigator  that  she  forgot  to  pay  the  remaining  cable  bill  when  she  vacated  her
residence. She intended to satisfy the debt within two weeks. She testified that when she
vacated her residence, she thought the cable was turned off. She has not contacted the
creditor to dispute the debt and has not paid the bill. (Tr. 56; GE 2, 3, 4, 5)
Applicant testified that with her limited income, she is doing the best she can. She
incurred student loan debt in 2003 and due to her disability, she was told she did not have
to repay the loans. However, in 2015, when for a period she worked full time, the loans
were reinstated. She has not made any payments since 2015. The loans were delinquent
prior  to  the  pandemic  and  are  currently  in  a  deferred  status.  She  owes  approximately
$6,625. (Tr. 58, 62-63)
Applicant  testified  that  she  and  her  husband  have  about  $1,100  in  their  bank
accounts.  They  do  not  have  retirement  accounts  or  investments.  They  do  not  provide
financial  support  for  anyone.  After  paying  their  monthly  expenses  there  is  minimal
expendable income. Applicant said it was because she was paying her delinquent debts,
she  has  less  money.  She  does  not  keep  a  written  budget  and  has  not  had  financial
counseling.  She  has  five  credit  cards  that  she  is  making  payments  on  and  the  total
balance owed is about $800. (Tr. 24, 29-31, 34-35, 59-60)
Applicant  provided   character   letters.  In   them,  she   is  described   as  honest,
dependable,  dedicated,  trusted,  loyal,  responsible,  hardworking,  supportive,  positive,
professional,  and  an  asset  to  her  work.  She  is  considered  a  person  with  exceptional
character and integrity. (AE A-F)
