In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, she admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.j, with a narrative
statement. In answering the amendment to the SOR, she admitted SOR ¶ 1.k and denied
SOR ¶ 1.l. Her admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings follow.
Applicant is 48  years old.  She  and  her second  husband  were  married  from  2007
until they divorced  in December 2021, in State  2. They did  not  have  children. She  has two
children   in  their   20s  from   her  first  marriage.  They  are  in  college,   but  their   father  is
responsible  for paying  for their  education. Applicant has an  associate  degree. (Tr. 33, 46-
47, 65; GE 1; AE H)
Applicant  and  her  second  husband  lived  in  State  1  until  late  2017.  She  was
employed with a government contractor at a government facility in State 1. She left her
job and they moved to  State 2 for his job. In State 2, she had only temporary, clerical
employment. (Tr. 35-37; GE 1)
Applicant’s then-husband lost his job  in State  2  in about September 2019. (Tr. 37,
47) They were  offered  jobs at military facilities in State  3. In  September 2019, Applicant
moved  to  State  3  for a  job,  but  he  did not  move  from  State  2. He  told her he  wanted  a
divorce  in May 2021. (Tr. 35-38, 47-48)
Applicant worked in City 1, in State 3, for two years, until September 2021, when
she moved to her current location in the same state. (Tr. 47-48) She worked for contractor
A in State 3 until the Friday before the hearing. She worked full time and earned $34.79
an hour. On the day of the hearing, as noted above, she began a new job on the same
base, with a new employer. She received a $7 an hour pay raise. (Tr. 39)
As  amended, the SOR concerns 11  alleged  delinquent debts,  discussed below.
They include federal and state income tax debts, consumer debts, a repossession, past-
due rent, and other debts. The debts are established by credit reports  from November
2022  and  April  2023,  and  other  record  evidence.  (GE  4,  GE  5).  In  her  Answer  to  the
original  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  debts,  and  said  they  were  being  resolved
through bankruptcy (SOR ¶ 1.k) or were the responsibility of her ex-husband.
The debts alleged are due to Applicant’s ex-husband’s employment issues and his
refusal to address the marital debts. They also were not able to afford to live in State 1, a
state with high taxes and a high cost of living. They addressed that by moving to State 2.
Applicant did not have steady work until she moved to State 3. (Tr. 63-64)
SOR ¶ 1.a ($11,392) concerns past-due federal income taxes, for tax years (TY)
2014, 2017, 2020, and 2021. (GE 2, GE 3; AE G) Most of these debts were incurred when
Applicant and her then-husband were living in State 1. They filed joint income tax returns
before their divorce. They were making payments, but he stopped doing so. They found
they could not afford to remain in State 1, so they moved to State 2. Her then-husband
refused to pay the taxes or any of their marital debt. “He just didn’t care,” she said. They
could not keep up with the tax burden, and always owed $2,000 or $3,000  each year.
State 2, where they moved, does not have a  state  income  tax.  Applicant  has filed her
federal income taxes individually since the divorce. (Tr. 35, 40-41, 49-51, 53-55, 63-64)
Under their divorce decree, Applicant’s then-husband (“Petitioner”) was ordered to
pay “All IRS past-due taxes.” (AE H at 2) Even so, Applicant included the tax debts in her
bankruptcy per her counsel’s advice. (Tr. 34, 51-52; GE 6 at 31)
SOR ¶ 1.b ($599) concerns past-due state income taxes owed to State 3 for TY
2020. (GE 2; AE F; Tr. 50) Applicant (“Respondent” in the divorce decree) was assigned
responsibility for any State 3 past-due taxes in the divorce decree, along with any debts
incurred after their May 29, 2021 separation date. (AE H at 3, 6; Tr. 51-52) Her State 3
tax debt is included in the bankruptcy. (GE 6 at 30)
SOR ¶ 1.l is a 2020 state tax lien, for $3,309  in past-due state income tax debt
owed to State 1. (GE 9) Applicant initially denied the debt because she was not aware of
it. (Tr. 54) She then researched the matter diligently in the days before the hearing and
learned the debt was valid. She plans to include this tax debt in he pending Chapter 13
bankruptcy proceeding. (SOR ¶ 1.k) (Tr. 32-33, 42-44)
The following SOR debts are all listed on credit reports in the record as past due
and in collection status:  SOR ¶ 1.c ($161), to a communications company; SOR ¶ 1.d
($552), to an insurance company; SOR ¶ 1.e ($315), to a lending company; SOR ¶ 1.f
($156), a gas credit card; SOR ¶ 1.h ($2,137), for past-due rent; and SOR ¶¶ 1.i ($63)
and 1.j ($862), which are consumer accounts. (GE 4, GE 5)
SOR ¶ 1.g ($10,781) is the balance due on a repossessed auto. (GE 4, GE 5) This
car was repossessed after Applicant’s then-husband lost his job in State 1. They could
only keep one vehicle so they returned this one. (Tr. 39,59-60)
Applicant retained legal counsel and filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in April
2023. She declared about $37,000 in liabilities and about $69,000 in assets. (GE 6 at 20;
AE B) The bankruptcy payment plan was approved in July 2023. (GE 8; AE D, AE E) She
is required to pay $1,123 per month. She has done so, in weekly payments of about $259
since May 2023. Payments are transferred from her pay automatically. (Tr. 61-62. AE C)
She is on a 60-month (5-year) repayment plan. (AE A) She had to participate in financial
counseling for the bankruptcy. (Tr. 58-60) All of the original SOR debts are addressed in
the bankruptcy. (GE 6)
Since moving to State 3, Applicant has had steady employment and has not had
issues  paying  bills.  She  attested  that  she  has  about  $1,500  or  $2,500  left  over  each
month. She provides financial assistance to her parents. (Tr. 56-57; GE 6 at 43; AE J)
Two  prior  supervisors  provided  strong  reference  letters  attesting  to  Applicant’s
professional  performance.  She  has  worked  closely  with  representatives  of  other
companies and understands the importance of protecting  confidential information. She
has excellent record-keeping skills and is a highly valued employee. (AE I, AE J)
