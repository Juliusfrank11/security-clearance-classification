Applicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his  current  employer  since  2016.  He  is  applying  for  a  security  clearance  for  the  first
time.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2015  and  a  master’s  degree  in  2020.  He  is
married without children. (Tr. at 27, 32, 40; GE 1, 3)
Applicant  started  using  marijuana  in  2015,  when  he  was  in  his  last  year  of
college.  It  increased  until  it  was  essentially  daily.  He  used  cocaine  on  about  10  to  15
occasions in 2015. He stopped using illegal drugs for about a year after he graduated
college. (Tr. at 15-16, 22-24; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 3; AE A)
Applicant  resumed  using  marijuana  in  2016  after  he  was  hired  by  his  current
employer, which has a drug-free workplace policy. He lives in a state where marijuana
possession  and  use  do  not  violate  any  state  laws.  He  used  ecstasy  (3,  4-
methylenedioxy-methamphetamine or MDMA) on three occasions in 2019, and he used
cocaine and LSD in 2021. He justified his drug use to himself by never using it at work
or when it could affect his work. (Tr. at 16-19, 24-32; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE
1, 3; AE A)
Applicant  started  using  marijuana  less  frequently  until  he  ended  all  illegal  drug
use in about February 2022. He regrets his past drug use. He became engaged, and he
and his wife married in August 2022. They plan to have children in the near future, and
he does not want drugs to be a part of their lives. He feels he has “matured away from
that lifestyle.” He admits that his application for a security clearance played some part in
his decision to stop using illegal drugs, but he stated that he would have stopped even if
he had never applied for a clearance. He is happy with his family life and his job, and he
does not intend to let drugs jeopardize either. He no longer associates outside of work
with the coworkers with whom he used drugs. He provided a signed statement of intent
to  abstain  from  all  drug  involvement  and  substance  misuse,  acknowledging  that  any
future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. (Tr.

Applicant  received  a  substance  abuse  evaluation  from  a  certified  addiction
specialist  in  April 2023.  The evaluator reported  that  she  “did not find  any  indicators or
evidence  that  met  the  criteria  for  a  current  misuse,  abuse,  or  dependence  issue  of
substances at this time.” (Tr. at 33-36; AE B, D)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF-86)  in
April 2022. He meticulously reported his use of marijuana, cocaine, MDMA and LSD. He
fully discussed his illegal drug use during his background interview in May 2022. (Tr. at
25-26, 38; GE 1, 3; AE A)
Applicant called a witness, and he  submitted documents and letters attesting to
his  excellent  job  performance  and  strong  moral  character.  He  is  praised  for  his  work
ethic, reliability, and trustworthiness. He is recommended for a security clearance. (Tr.
at 42-47; AE B)
