In Applicant’s Answer, he admitted all the debts except for SOR ¶ 1.h; however,
all his positive responses were qualified by language that his debts had been settled, paid
in full, or a settlement had been reached and they would be paid off shortly. Therefore, I
am considering these answers to be de facto denials. He also denied the two Guideline
J allegations and indicated they were dismissed. (Answer; AE I)
The  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.a  was  a  credit  card  account  opened  in  2018  and
charged  off  in  2021.  A  judgment  was  filed  against  Applicant  in  2022  in  the  amount  of
$22,277.  At  the  hearing,  he  testified  he  entered  into  a  payment  agreement  with  the
creditor  in  September  2022  to  make  monthly  payments  of  $376,  and  his  wife  was
negotiating with the creditor to settle the debt for a lump-sum payment. His April 2023
credit  bureau  report  (CBR)  reflects  a  balance  of  $20,168,  indicating  he  did  make

Applicant attributed  his  financial problems to  his wife’s four  bouts with  cancer,  his
under and  unemployment,  and  a  failed  business. His wife  has been  unable to  work since
approximately 2018. In addition  to  her lost income, costs related to uncovered transplant
medications, chemotherapy,  and  travel for her treatment affected  their  finances. Her latest
illness also coincided  with  the  period  he  returned  to  school full  time  (2017  to  2019).  They
relied on  his education benefits from his military service (GI Bill)  and his Navy retirement
and   VA   disability  pay. However,  they   had   insufficient   income   for their   needs,   and  they
used credit cards to support themselves  and  pay for her necessary medications.  (Tr.  18-
19, 36-39, 56-58;  GE  2  at 3; GE 3  at 9; AE Y)

time student, and from December 2019 until March 2020, when he was preparing to open

unable to make the business successful and despite multiple attempts, he shut it down in
October 2021. He was subsequently unemployed until January 2022. Additionally, since
retiring from the Navy, he struggled to find a position in his field, because he lacked a
college degree. (Tr. 27-28, 41, 56, 63-66, 76-78; GE 1 at 10; GE 2 at 2-3)

expenses and  save  money.  They  were  subsequently  able  to  make  payments and  resolve

State  A  and  used  the  proceeds to  resolve their  remaining  debts. (Tr. 30, 45, 48-49, 63-

pay  for  three  items. These  smaller items, body wash, mascara, and  a  lip  pencil,  were  in
the  upper basket  of  the  shopping  cart  under his wife’s purse, and  they were  worth  $19.07.
As  they  were   leaving   the   store,   Applicant   and   his  wife   were  apprehended   by   loss
prevention. After they  were  confronted, they  apologized,  and  offered  to  pay  for  the  items.
They did not intend to  steal these items. The  charges were ultimately dismissed. (Tr. 82-

In June 2021, Applicant was arrested and charged with assault and battery for an
incident that occurred in October 2020.  His original business partner for the restaurant

defend himself, but did not hurt him. Applicant left the restaurant with the paperwork and
filed a police report the same day. In June 2021, his former partner filed charges against
him, but they were dismissed in October 2021. (Tr. 91-93; AE T)
