The  SOR  alleges  one  debt  charged  off  for  $43,150.  The  debt  is  reflected  in  a
credit report dated July 14, 2021. (GX 2) In Applicant’s  answer to the SOR, he did not
admit or deny the debt but offered an explanation for it. I have treated his explanation as
a denial.
Applicant  is  a  50-year-old  marine  electrician  employed  by  a  defense  contractor
since  September  2009.  He  graduated  from  high  school  in  June  1992.  He  married  in
June  1996,  divorced  in  September  1999,  and  remarried  in  May  2009.  He  has  two
children, ages 20 and 14. He received a security clearance in October 2009.
Applicant’s  base  income,  based  on  a  48-hour  work  week,  is  about  $75,000  per
year.  He  usually  works  50  or  60  hours  per  week,  making  his  annual  income  about
$90,000  (Tr  14-15)  His  wife  starting  working  part  time  three  or  four  months  ago.  The
record does not reflect her income. (Tr. 15) He testified that his net monthly remainder
after paying his debts is about $200 when he is working a 48-hour week and about $600
when he is traveling and working longer hours. (Tr. 33)
Applicant  purchased  his  family  home  in  2006  for  $283,000,  financed  with  two
mortgage loans. One of the loans was an adjustable-rate loan, on which the payments
initially  were  about  $200  per  month.  By  2019,  the  payments  had  increased  to  about
$800  per  month,  which  he  could  not  afford.  His  last  payment  on  the  debt  was  in  July
2019.  (GX  5  at  5)  He  contacted  the  lender  in  December  2019  and  applied  for  relief
under  the  Making  Home  Affordable  Program.  (AX  A)  He  testified  that  he  asked  the
lender about his application in January 2020 and was informed that the lender had not
received it. He submitted a second application in January and was informed in February
that this application had not been received. (Tr. 18-19) He did not inquire further until he
was interviewed by a security investigator in early 2021. (Tr. 21) All his interactions with
the  lender  have  been  telephonic  conversations,  without  any  written  corroborating
documentation. (Tr. 31)
Applicant  testified  that when  the lender informed  him that his loan was  charged
off, and he thought that  “charged off”  meant that the lender had been  paid “in  another
way.” (Tr. 22) He still lives in the home, and the payments on the first mortgage loan are
current. He explored the possibility of refinancing the first mortgage loan and using his
equity in the home to pay the charged-off debt, but he was informed by the lender that
he  could  not  qualify  for  refinancing  because  the  charged-off  debt  was  on  his  credit
reports. (Tr. 24)
After the hearing, Applicant submitted a statement stating that he had negotiated
a payment plan with the lender for the charged-off debt, providing for monthly payments
of  $100  per  month.  He  stated  that  the  lender  would  not  provide  documentation  of  the
payment  plan  because  the  debt  was  still  in  a  charged-off  status.  (AX  D)  He  provided
documentation of a $100 payment to the lender on March 29, 2023. (AX B; AX C)
Applicant’s credit report from March 2023 reflects a telecommunications account
that is past due for $377. The account was opened in April 2003, and the last activity on
the account was in September 2021. The credit report reflects that the debt is disputed,
but it does not reflect the basis for the dispute. (GX 5 at 5) The debt is not alleged in the
SOR.
In January 2023, Applicant obtained an unsecured loan of $28,821, with monthly
payments  of  $875.  He  used  the  proceeds  of  this  loan  to  pay  off  several  credit-card
accounts.  (Tr.  27)  In  addition  to  the  charged-off  debt  alleged  in  the  SOR  and  the
delinquent telecommunications account, his most recent credit report reflects that he is
carrying a balance of $11,739 on six revolving accounts and $32,699 on two installment
accounts,  all  of  which  are  current.  His  total  monthly  payments  on  all  these  open
accounts total about $1,683. (GX 5 at 3)
