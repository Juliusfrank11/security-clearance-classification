In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted in part ¶¶ 1.a-1.c, 1.h and 1.j, and
admitted  in  full  ¶¶ 1.d-1.g  and  1.i,  1.k  and  1.l  with  explanations.  His  admissions  are
incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  47  years  old.  He  was  born  in  Armenia  in  1976,  when  it  was  still  a
republic of the Soviet Union.  In  1998,  he  completed  a  bachelor’s and  master’s degree
through  a  university  in  Armenia.  Subsequently,  from  June  1998  through  November
1999, he completed mandatory service with the Armenian army. In 2003, he completed
a  second  master’s degree. He married  in 2004  and  has two children, ages 16 and 18.
(GX 1-2; AX A; Tr. 22-31, 60-72)
From   about  April  2008   through   April  2010,   Applicant  worked   in  the   translation
center  for  the   Armenian   Ministry  of   Justice.   Later  in  2010,  he   and   his  family  received
visas  under the  DOS  Diversity Immigration  Program  and   entered  the  United  States.  In
2015, he  and  his wife  became  U.S. citizens,  and  they  purchased  a  home  in  the  United
States  for about $512,000.  His wife  is a  schoolteacher.  (GX 1-2; Tr.  21-32, 55-57, 133-
136)
Also  in  2015,  Applicant  traveled  to  Armenia  to  visit  his  parents  and  close  his
Armenian  bank  accounts.  In  2016,  his  children  became  U.S.  citizens.  Later  that  year,
Applicant sponsored his parents to become U.S. permanent residents. They have since
become  U.S.  citizens.  Applicant’s  only  sibling,  his  sister,  is  a  U.S.  citizen.  Applicant’s
mother-in-law  is  also  a  U.S.  citizen,  and  she  lives  with  Applicant’s  family.  They  are
estranged from Applicant’s father-in-law. (GX 1-2; Tr. 28-31, 65-67)
Following his entry into the United States, from August 2010 through September
2014,  Applicant  worked  for  a  U.S.  Government  organization.  From  September  2014
through  June  2021,  he  worked  in  various  positions  as  a  contractor  for  another  U.S.
Government department. Since June 2021, he has been with his sponsoring employer
as a business analyst performing contract work for DOD and another U.S. Government
department. He currently earns an annual salary of about $104,000 and does not have
any other sources of income.  He has never held a security clearance.  (GX 1-2; AX A;
Tr. 7-8, 25, 83-93, 133-134)
In  April  2022,  Applicant  renounced  his  Armenian  citizenship.  He  only  holds
financial accounts in the United States and recently sold one of the two properties that
his family  owned  in  Armenia.  (See  discussion  below) He  described  being  active  in  his
church and community as well as voting in U.S. elections. He stated he has no intention
of residing in Armenia again. (GX 1-2; AX B-D; Tr. 25-26, 31-32, 109)

The  Republic of Armenia
Armenia  declared  its  independence  from  the  Soviet  Union  in  September  1991
and  is  a  parliamentary  democracy.  The  United  States  established  diplomatic  relations
with Armenia in 1992.
Following independence, Armenia has been involved in multiple conflicts over the
years with neighboring Azerbaijan over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh. The
conflict  increased  significantly  in  2020  and  there  were  reports  that  Azerbaijani  forces
engaged  in  unlawful  killings  and  cruel,  inhuman,  or  degrading  treatment  of  Armenian
forces  during  that  time.  A  ceasefire  arrangement  was  reached  in  November  2020.
However,  in  September  2023,  Azerbaijan  launched  a  military  offensive  reasserting
control  in  the  region.  The  United  Stated  has  issued  calls  for  an  end  to  hostilities  and
unhindered  humanitarian  access  in  the  region.  (See  U.S.  State  Department,  Country
Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2022: Armenia: https://www.state.gov/reports/
2022-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/armenia/  (March  20,  2023);   U.S.  State
Department,  Secretary  Blinken’s  Call  with   Azerbaijani   President  Aliyev:
https://www.state.gov/secretary-blinkens-call-with-azerbaijani-president-aliyev-17
(September 26, 2023))
The   Russian   government  also   assists   Armenian   security  institutions  and
Armenia’s  economy   has  become   increasingly   dependent   on   Russian   investment.
However,  Armenia  is   actively   seeking   increased   U.S.   engagement   in  support  of   its
democratic  ambitions,   economic  growth   targets,   and   improved   regional  security.   The
U.S.  role   in  Armenia   has  become   more  important  as  regional   tensions  increase
following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
The Russian Federation
The  Russian  Federation  has  a  highly  centralized  authoritarian  political  system
dominated by President Vladimir Putin. Russia presents one of the most serious foreign
threats  to  the  United  States  and  has  attempted  to  position  itself  as  a  great  power
competitor to  the  United  States  by  undermining  norms  within  the  existing  international
system.
In  February  2014,  Russia  annexed  Crimea,  claiming  the  area  to  be  part  of  the
Russian  Federation.  In  September  2022,  Russia  occupied  four  more  provinces  in
Ukraine, and in February 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. As a
result,  the  United States  issued  numerous  sanctions  against Russian  citizens  and has
provided  aid  to  Ukraine.  DOS  issued  “Level  4  - Do  not  travel”  warnings,  for  both
countries.
Russia  also  remains a  top  cyber  threat as it refines and  employs  its espionage,
influence,   and   attack  capabilities.   Russia   views  cyber  disruptions   as   a   foreign   policy
lever  to   shape   countries’  decisions,  as  well  as  a   deterrence   and   military  tool.   Russia
remains a  hostile  country to  the  interests of the  United  States. See  ISCR  Case  No.  19-
00831 at 3 (App. Bd. July 29, 2020). Russia’s war with Ukraine is ongoing.
Ukraine
The only allegation concerning Applicant’s connections to Ukraine that make  the
facts  contained  in  AN  III  relevant  here  is  SOR  ¶  1.c,  Applicant’s  aunt  who  lived  in
Ukraine and passed away in 2020. Given the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia
(see discussion above), there is an obvious foreign influence security concern involving
Ukraine generally. However, Applicant has no current or recent connections to Ukraine
to suggest an  ongoing security concern  related to him. Therefore, I will not expand on
the facts contained in AN III about Ukraine.
It  is  well  established  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.  As  the
Supreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent standard
