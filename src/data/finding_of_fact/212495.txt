In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, she admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.c, 1.e, and 1.h, all
with explanations. She denied SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.d, 1.f, and 1.g, also with explanations. Her
admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings follow.
Applicant is 46  years old.  She  has never married  and  has no  children. She  earned
a bachelor’s degree  in  2000  and  a  master’s degree  in 2009. She  has worked  as a  DOD
contractor, for various  employers,  since  March  2001, with  some  periods of unemployment
and work stoppage. She has held a clearance since  at least 2009. She was  unemployed
for six months from  January to  June  2012  due  to  the  end  of a  contract with  contractor S.
Under that contract,  she  held a  salary of about $98,000. She was unemployed  again in
early  2018   for  about  three   months  before  beginning   with   contractor  G,   since   renamed
contractor F,  in July 2018,  with  annual income  of  about  $60,000. She  has worked  for them
ever since, and  she  has been  working  remotely since  September 2019.  (Tr. 9, 22-37, 43-
47, 80-83, 96-98; GE  1)
Applicant  also  experienced  periods  of  work  stoppage,  from  October  2021  to
December  2021,  and  January  15  to  April  24,  2022.  During  this  time,  she  earned  no
income, but was able to receive some unemployment benefits. In July 2022, her job was
reduced to 20 hours a week. Since early October 2023, her job has been reduced to 10
hours a week. She believes she earns $37 to $38 an hour, which would be less than $400
a month. The job is her only source of income. (Tr. 22, 27-32, 36-37, 43, 80-83, 96-99)
Applicant’s  debts  include  two  repossessed  cars and  some other,  smaller debts.
She  disclosed  several  debts  on  her  SCA  and  discussed  them  in  her  May  2020
background  interview  They  are  established  by  credit  reports  from  May  2020,  August
2020, and June 2022. (GE 3, GE 4, GE 5) She said she was advised by the agent who
interviewed her to try to pay off at least half of the debts discussed. At the time, she was
not able to address the auto debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b). She believes those debts were
cancelled by the creditors with the issuance of an IRS form 1099-C but she never received
confirmation. (Tr. 53-55)
SOR  ¶  1.b  ($12,758)  is  the  balance  due  on  a  repossessed  vehicle  placed  for
collection. (GE 3 at 13, Acct. # 45988) Applicant admitted the debt but denies the amount
owed. She purchased the vehicle in 2015 for about $19,000. She made payments until
the car broke down in July 2017. She attempted to trade the vehicle in for another working
vehicle, but she was not able to do so. Out of necessity, she took out another loan in 2017
(SOR ¶ 1.a) to purchase a replacement vehicle, leaving her with two car payments.. She
stopped paying on the loan at SOR ¶ 1.b in 2017 and had the car voluntarily repossessed.
In about October 2017, the account was charged off by the creditor. (GE 3 at 13; GE 2 at
2; Tr. 47-52, 92-93) A June 2022 credit report reflects that this account (Acct. # 45988)
was  charged  off,  for $21,994,  but  also  that  the  account  was  paid  for  less  than  the  full
balance. It is reflected as a “Paid Charge Off” and no balance is due. (GE 5 at 13)
SOR ¶ 1.a ($14,637) is an account placed for collection. (GE 3 at 12, GE 4) This
debt concerns the vehicle Applicant purchased while attempting to trade in her previous
vehicle (SOR ¶ 1.b). The amount alleged is the balance due after the vehicle was sold at
auction. She purchased the car in 2017 for about $34,000 and fell behind on payments in
September 2018 due to a significant reduction in income. She said she tried to refinance
this  loan  with  a  lower interest  rate  but  was  not  able  to  do  so.  The  car  was  voluntarily
repossessed  in  July  2019.  She  said  she  paid  the  account  off  in  January  2022,  with  a
lump-sum payment on a debit card for between $8,000 and $10,000. She believes the
remaining amount may have been canceled by the creditor. (Answer; Tr. 55-59, 85-87,
92-95) After the hearing, she also documented a $6,000 payment towards this debt that
occurred  in  February  2022.  (AE  C)  This  account  is  not  listed  on  her  June  2022  credit
report. (GE 5)
SOR ¶ 1.c ($1,367) is a credit account placed for collection. Applicant admitted the
account  but  said  a  portion  had  been  paid  off  and  the  remainder  was  disputed.  At  her
hearing, she disputed the account, and said she did not take out the payday loan at issue.
She also said she attempted to resolve it by paying it off. (Tr. 60-64) After the hearing,
she documented a $448 payment towards this debt in January 2022. (AE C)
SOR ¶ 1.d ($1,043) is a medical debt placed for collection. (GE 3 at 13) This was
for  an  emergency  room  visit  when  Applicant  had  no  insurance  during  a  period  of
unemployment in 2018. She said the account was paid off in January 2022, with a debit
card. (Tr. 64-66)
SOR ¶ 1.e ($693) is a cell phone account placed for collection. Applicant was made
aware of this debt during her background interview. She admitted the debt and said she
tried several times to pay it off by phone between 2020 and 2022 but was unable to do
so due to a language barrier between herself and the creditor’s representative. She also
explained that she was contesting some of the early termination penalties included in the
amount owed. (Answer; Tr. 67-72)
SOR ¶ 1.f ($329) is a medical account placed for collection. (GE 3 at 4) Applicant
denied the debt, asserting that she paid it off in December 2021. (Answer) She incurred
this debt when she was injured while stepping off of a boat in spring of 2018, a time when
she was unemployed and without insurance. She believes the debt was paid in late 2020.
(Tr. 72-75, 85)
SOR ¶ 1.g ($185) is a medical account placed for collection. Applicant denies the
debt, asserting that she paid it off in January 2022. (Answer, Tr. 76-77) She documented
this payment after the hearing. (AE C)
SOR ¶ 1.h ($70) is a past-due debt reported for collection. Applicant admits the
debt but says she is unsure who to pay. (Answer; Tr. 77-78)
Applicant’s post-hearing documentation includes excerpts from  bank statements
in  January  and  February  2022,  some  of  which  are  cited  above.  There  are  also  some
payments by check card, for $898 and $735, which may also concern other SOR debts
(such as SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e), though this is not entirely clear. (AE C)
Applicant  said  her  debts  were  due  to  lack  of  income,  decreased  salary  and
unemployment. She denied living or spending beyond her means. All of her SOR debts
were  caused  months  after  the  purchases  were  made,  when  she  fell  behind  on  her
accounts due to unemployment. (Tr. 16, 22, 33, 79)
Applicant was also the victim of an assault in 2021 and was badly injured. She had
other  health  issues  in  2023  but  they  did  not  impact  her debts  as  she  now  has  private
health insurance. She also had a flood in her home in early 2023 that destroyed some of
the documentation she might otherwise have presented. (Tr. 83-88)
Applicant has followed a budget since late 2020 but has not participated in credit
counseling. Now, before she buys something, she considers whether she can afford it if
she found herself unemployed. (Tr. 39-43, 81-82) A June 2022 credit report shows less
than  $2,000  in  collection  accounts,  mostly  medical  debts.  Applicant  owes  just  under
$50,000 in federal student loans. At the time of the hearing no payment was due, as the
student  loans  were  in  deferment  due  to  the  pandemic.  She  intends  to  address  them
through an income contingent repayment plan. She is current on her state and federal
income tax requirements. (Tr. 89-92) She loves her job and is trying to pay what she can.
(Tr. 96, 101; GE 5)
Two references provided strong recommendation letters vouching for Applicant’s
character and worthiness to hold a clearance.  Applicant’s direct supervisor attests that
she is a highly professional and trustworthy individual. She routinely works with sensitive
information and upholds the highest standards of security and compliance with rules and
regulations. She has a strong pride in her work and an excellent work ethic. (AE A, AE B
