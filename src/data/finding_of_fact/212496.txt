Applicant is a 43-year-old systems administrator employed by a defense contractor
since October 2021. He has worked in various information technology (IT) positions for
federal  contractors  since  September  2007,  except  as  follows:  From  March  2014  to
November 2015, he worked several part-time jobs while he unsuccessfully attempted to
open a small business; and he was unemployed from March 2017 to July 2017 and from
August 2021 to October 2021. He has held a security clearance since 2009. (GE 1; Tr.
31-35, 57-62)
Applicant attended some college and has earned numerous IT certifications. He
married in February 2022. He was previously married from November 2005 to April 2015.
He has two children, ages 17 and 10, with his former spouse. (GE 1; Tr. 38, 59, 77-78)
The  SOR  alleges  seven  delinquent  accounts  totaling  $153,540,  including  a
mortgage  loan  for  $124,265.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.h)  In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,
Applicant denied all SOR allegations with explanations.
In his January 2020 SCA, Applicant disclosed a 2016 mortgage foreclosure, and
a delinquent auto loan and credit-card account totaling about $25,000. (GE 1 at 35-39) In
April 2021, an intelligence agency warned Applicant about security concerns raised by
his  financial  problems  and  granted  him  a  “conditional  clearance”  for  access  to  certain
intelligence  information.  (AE  C) The  agency concluded  he provided  evidence  of  good-
faith efforts to resolve delinquent accounts that were later alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.c
through  1.h,  and  that  his  financial  issues  were  caused  by  circumstances  beyond  his
control.  (AE  C)  Applicant’s  eligibility  for  access  to  certain  intelligence  information  was
conditioned upon timely repayment of his debts and submission of evidence he resolved
the debt later alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e; and a delinquent auto loan not alleged in the SOR.
(AE C; GE 5 at 8) For reasons unclear from the record the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b was
not identified or otherwise addressed in the intelligence agency correspondence. (AE C)
Applicant  attributes  his  financial  problems  to  his  divorce,  his  failed  business
venture,  associated  underemployment  from  March  2014  to  November  2015,  and
unemployment.  He  said  he  attempted  to  file  for  bankruptcy,  but  his  attorney  never
completed  the  process.  After  discussing  his  credit  problems  with  a  government
investigator, Applicant started resolving some delinquent debts in 2020 with funds from
an  income  tax  refund.  He  said  he  was  paying  off  his  delinquent  debts  and  stated  his
intention to restore his good credit. (GE 1 at 35-39, 41, GE 2 at 8; Tr. 24, 35-40, 49-52,
59-60)
The evidence concerning the specific SOR allegations is summarized below.
SOR  ¶   1.a:  mortgage  account  placed  for  collection  for  $124,265.  Applicant
denied the allegation, stated the mortgage account was closed in about February 2016
and  removed  from  his  credit  report  in  2022.  (Answer)  He  testified  that  he  accepted  a
payout  from  the  creditor  and  moved  out  of  the  marital  home  after  his  2015  divorce  to
resolve  the delinquency.  A March 2020  credit  report shows the account was closed  in
December 2015 with no balance due, but credit reports from September 2021 and March
2022 erroneously show the account as in collection. He provided documentary evidence
in  December  2015  with  no  balance  due,
the  mortgage  account  was  closed
correspondence  from  April  2022  confirming  credit  bureaus  were  provided  corrected
information, and credit reports from May 2023. (AE A-C, F; GE 1 at 36-37, GE 1-5; Tr.
24-28, 38-39, 44) This debt was resolved in December 2015.
SOR  ¶   1.b:  credit  account  charged  off  for  $17,544.  Applicant  denied  the
allegation, said the account was no longer delinquent and that payment arrangements
were made on January 8, 2022. (Answer) Credit reports from March 2020 and September
2021 show a July 2015 balance date and balance of $17,544, and that the account was
charged  off  for  $17,544.  (GE  4  at  2,  GE  5  at  5)  In  December  2021,  Applicant
acknowledged the debt was unpaid, reported entering a payment agreement and making
monthly  payments  of  $100,  and  acknowledged  he  had  not  submitted  documentary
evidence of payment status or proof of payments. (GE 2 at 3-4, 9)
He testified this debt was for a line of credit or loan he obtained to start a small
business in about 2014, that he probably stopped making payments at about the time of
his divorce, and that the account had been charged-off. He said after this debt came up
during an interview with a government investigator he decided “I need to address this. So
I  did  work  out  at  the  time  with  them  a  payment,  an  auto-deduction  from  my  account
monthly of [$100] . . . . They continue to make deductions from my bank account[.]” (Tr.
40-41) During the hearing, he acknowledged he had not provided evidence of payments,
stated his understanding that bank statements showing payments to the creditor could
provide such evidence, and stated his intent to keep making payments until the debt was
paid. (Tr. 39-49, 51-53)
After  the  hearing,  he  submitted  a  letter  dated  February  26,  2022,  showing  an
account balance of $23,662, and that he authorized the creditor to debit his bank account
for $100 monthly from March to December 2022 to apply towards the debt. (AE G) In an
email dated July 26, 2023, he described the February 2022 letter as “showing my initial
payment  plan”  and  explained  his  difficulties  communicating  with  the  current  creditor
including lengthy wait periods on the phone, and multiple points of contact. He said, “they
took payments out of my bank account up until December of 2022, and now nobody has
any record of my account.” (AE E at 1-2) Credit reports from March 2022 and May 2023
do not list this account. He did not submit bank account records or other documentary
evidence of payments made on this debt. (GE 2-5; AE A, E, G; Tr. 39-49, 51-53)
SOR  ¶   1.c:  credit  account  charged  off  for  $7,999.  Applicant  denied  the
allegation  and  said  he  paid  the  account  on  February  24,  2021.  (Answer)  He
acknowledged he had given his ex-spouse access to this credit-card account and said he
settled the account. He said he had correspondence showing the creditor’s willingness to
settle the account for about $6,000 and bank records showing he had paid that amount
in  February 2021,  but he  did not  submit  that documentary evidence.  (Tr. 36, 48-51)  A
March 2020 credit report shows the account was charged off for $7,999 in June 2015,
and in collection for $7,999. (GE 5 at 6) A September 2021 credit report shows a balance
of  $7,999  but  indicates  the  account  was  “settled  for  less  than  full  balance”  and  “paid
charge off.” (GE 4 at 2-3) I resolve this allegation for Applicant because his September
2021 credit report and AE C corroborate his claim that he settled this debt in 2021.
SOR ¶  1.d: credit collection account for $1,430. Applicant denied the allegation
and said he paid the account on March 22, 2021. (Answer) A March 2020 credit report
shows the account with activity in August 2014 and in collection for $1,430. (GE 5 at 6)
Credit  reports  from  September  2021,  March  2022,  and  May  2023  do  not  reflect  this
account.  He  testified  he  paid  the  debt  in  full  in  March  2021  and  said  he  had  proof  of
payment. After the hearing, he submitted evidence including bank records that he paid
the debt in full on July 11, 2023. (Tr. 54-55; AE H)
SOR  ¶   1.e:  credit  account  charged  off  for  $1,082.  Applicant  denied  the
allegation and said he paid the account on March 17, 2021. (Answer) A March 2020 credit
report  showed  the  account  as  charged  off  for  $1,082  in  February  2015,  and  as  in
collection for $931. (GE 5 at 6) In December 2021 and at the hearing, Applicant said he
had paid the debt. (GE 2 at 4; Tr. 28, 55) After the hearing, he submitted bank records
showing he paid the creditor $931 on March 17, 2021. (AE I)
SOR ¶  1.f: credit account charged off for $911. Applicant denied the allegation
and said he paid a collection agency on March 17, 2021. (Answer) A March 2020 credit
report  shows  the  account  as  assigned  in  April  2010,  charged  off  for  $911  in  February
2015, and in collection for $911. (GE 5 at 7) In December 2021 and at the hearing, he
said he had paid the debt but did not provide evidence of payment. (GE 2 at 4; Tr. 55-56)
After  the  hearing,  he  asserted  this  debt  was  transferred  to  another  creditor,  that  the
creditor  acknowledged  the  account  was  resolved,  but  that  he  had  not  yet  received
promised proof of payment from the creditor, and that his online account was no longer
accessible. (AE E) He submitted a bank record showing payment of $501 to that creditor
on March 17, 2021, which referenced the original creditor. (AE J) I find for Applicant on
this allegation because his claims that he paid the debt are corroborated in part by AE C
and AE J.
SOR ¶  1.g: credit collection account  for $309.  Applicant denied  the  allegation
and said  he paid the  account  on  January 15, 2021. (Answer)  A  March 2020  credit report
showed  the  account  as assigned  in March 2015,  and  as in  collection  for $309. (GE  5  at
7)  In  December 2021  and  at the  hearing, he  said he  had  paid the  debt but  did  not provide
evidence  of payment. (GE  2  at  5; Tr.  55-56)  After the  hearing, he  submitted  documentary
evidence  including a  bank statement showing  that he paid the  debt  in June  2023. (AE K)
Applicant’s financial situation has improved. His gross annual income increased
from about $99,000  in 2018 to about $110,000. In April 2022, he obtained a $373,000
mortgage loan and has made timely payments since. In January 2023, he purchased a
2021 model-year vehicle and has made regular payments since. He said he has about
$1,500 in the bank, and $26,000 in a retirement account. (AE A, Tr. 23-28, 66, 72-76)
Applicant  has  not  received  formal  financial  counseling.  He  provided  a  written
budget  in  December  2021  and  reported  a  remainder  of  about  $1,900  a  month  after
expenses. He said he had a more comprehensive financial statement and acknowledged
his understanding that submission of that document could be helpful  but did not do so.
(GE 2 at 9; Tr. 56-57, 76-77)
During  the  hearing  Applicant  was  informed  of  the  importance  of  providing
documentary evidence of debt payments, contact with creditors, and efforts to address or
resolve his delinquent debts. (GE 2 at 9; Tr. 42-46, 55-57, 62-66, 70-72, 76-78, 84)
Applicant  submitted  letters  of  recommendation  from  his  current  supervisor,  a
former  co-worker  and  friend,  and  his  former  spouse  that  comment  favorably  on  his
judgment,  reliability,  trustworthiness,  performance,  expertise,  security  awareness,  and
loyalty. (AE D)
