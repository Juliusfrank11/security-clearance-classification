Under Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed an approximate
total of $28,000 for eight delinquent accounts (SOR 1.a – 1.h). In her Answer, Applicant
admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations.  In  addition  to  the  facts  established  by  Applicant’s
admissions, I make the following findings of relevant fact.
Applicant  is  34  years  old  and  is  being  sponsored  for  a  security  clearance  by  a
defense contractor. She has worked for them for two years. She has over nine years work
experience in the same career field. This is her first time applying for a security clearance.
She is a single mother of three teenage children, ages 16, 15, and 14. (GE 1; Tr. 20-21)
Applicant completed  an  electronic questionnaires for investigations processing  (e-
QIP)  on   September  16,  2018.  A   subsequent  background   investigation   revealed   the
following  delinquent accounts:  a  $9,459  collection  debt owed  as a  result of  an  automobile
repossessed  in  2019  (SOR ¶  1.a: GE  3  at 2; GE  4  at  3;  Tr. 35); a  $8,595  collection  debt
as a  result of an automobile  repossessed  in  2017  (SOR ¶  1.b: GE  3  at 2; GE  4  at 3; Tr.
39-41); a  $1,105  charged-off  account  owed  to  a  credit  union  (SOR  ¶  1.c:  GE  3  at  2;  GE
4  at 4); a  $1,029  delinquent  credit card account that  was  placed  for collection  (SOR ¶  1.d:
GE  3  at 2; GE  4  at 5); a  $760  credit card account that was placed  for collection  (SOR ¶
1.e: GE  3  at 2; GE  4  at 5); a  $140  charged-off account (SOR ¶  1.f: GE  3  at 2); a  $1,471
charged-off  account (SOR ¶  1.g:  GE  4  at 4); and  a  $5,698  account  that was placed  for
collection. (SOR ¶  1.h: GE 4 at 4)
Applicant’s  former  boyfriend  and  the  father  of  her  children,  was  an  abusive
alcoholic. The abuse increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. In February 2021, she
moved out of the apartment with her children. Before she decided to move out, there were
three domestic  violence  incidents  initiated by her former partner that  made  her realize
she needed to move out for the sake of the children. She initially moved in with her parents
who live in a one-bedroom apartment. She paid her parents $1,000 a month rent when
she and children lived with them.  She rented a place for her and the children to live a few
months later. The monthly rent was $1,632.  (Tr. 19, 22-25)
Applicant is the sole provider of her three children. The children’s father does not
provide  child  support,  although  Applicant  recently  filed  for  child  support  about  a  week
before the hearing. She realized the only way to get money from him would be through a
child support order because his paycheck could be garnished. (Tr. 26-27)
Applicant intends to pay her debts. She does not live an expensive lifestyle and
does not spend money on gambling.  She needs time to resolve her debts. (Tr. 19-20)
The   $9,459   debt  alleged   in  SOR  ¶   1.a   was  the   debt  remaining   after  one   of
Applicant’s cars was  repossessed  in 2019. The  debt  was paid off  through  garnishment.
Her paycheck was  garnished  between  $700  to  $900  a  period  beginning  in May 2022. She
testified  the  garnishment stopped a few months ago. (Tr.  35-38; AE  B)   She   was unable
to  pay any of the  remaining  SOR debts.  (Tr.  39-46) She  pays her current debts and  her
rent.  Most  of  the  debts  alleged  in  the  SOR occurred  as  result of her relationship  with her
abusive boyfriend. When  she  lived  with  him, he  was not working  on  a  regular basis. His
mother and  occasionally his sister  lived  with  them.  Neither  worked. Applicant  was the  only
breadwinner  in  the   household.   She   would  often   give   her  boyfriend   $100   a   day  to   buy
alcohol so he would not bother her. (Tr.  48-50)
Applicant has been on her own for about two years. A few months ago, Applicant’s
father suffered a heart attack. She had to pay his mortgage while he recovered from his
illness. This prevented her from making more payments towards her delinquent accounts.
Applicant  currently  does  not  own  a  car.  She  takes  an  Uber  to  work  because  her  day
begins earlier than when public transportation is available. She takes public transportation
home. Despite all of these challenges, she believes she is in a better financial situation
on her own. She is current on federal and state income taxes. (Tr. 54 – 59)
Applicant currently earns $31 per hour. She also works overtime hours. Her net
paycheck is $2,600 a pay period. She is paid twice a month, so she earns $5,200 monthly.
Her monthly expenses include: rent $2,000; and utilities $150 - $200. She estimates she
has a couple hundred dollars left over each month after expenses. (Tr. 29)
Whole-Person Evidence
Mr.  R.,  Applicant’s   superior,  states   Applicant  is  an  asset   to   their   team.  She   has
completed  all  the  necessary briefings regarding  safeguarding  sensitive information. (AE
A)  Mr. T. has known Applicant  for several years. He has  observed  her duty performance.
She   is  dedicated   to   her  job   and   is  very  professional.  She   performs  her  duties  in  an
excellent  manner. He  has worked  at a  high-level state  commission  and  currently works
at  a   high-level  at  the   federal  level.  He  believes  Applicant  is  worthy   of  maintaining   her
security clearance. She  possesses  “the  analytical ability,  judgment,  discretion, personal
integrity,  and represents the  organization in  a  positive light.” (AE C)
