Applicant  is  a  24-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor  working  as  an
inspector. He has worked for his current employer since 2017. He seeks to reestablish
his security clearance. He earned his high school diploma in 2017 and has completed
some apprentice courses but has not obtained a degree. He previously held a security
clearance from December 2017 until it was suspended in September 2021. He is single,
lives with his partner, and they have three young children. (GE 1 at 12, 14, and 21; Tr.
17-18.)
In  Applicant’s Answer to  the  SOR, he  admitted  the  three  Guideline  H allegations.
SOR  ¶   1.a,  that  he   purchased   and   used   marijuana   with   varying   frequency  from   about
January  2012  through January 2019.  SOR ¶ 1.b,  that he purchased  and  used  marijuana
as set forth  in subparagraph  1.a  after being  granted  access to  classified  information  in
2018.  SOR ¶  1.c, that  in  January  2019  he  was arrested  and  charged  with  (1) sell, give,  or
distribute  more  than  one-half ounce, but less than  five  pounds of marijuana, a  felony,  and
(2) carrying  concealed  weapon. He pled  no  contest to  a reduced  drug  charge  of sell, give,
or distribute  less than  one-half ounce  (misdemeanor). He  was  sentenced  to  12-months'
confinement (11  months suspended), and  three-years'  probation, which  ended  in October
2022.
Applicant stated he started to use marijuana when he was 13 and from 2012 to
2017 he smoked marijuana on a daily basis (Tr. at 18-19.) He stopped smoking marijuana
from March 2017 to about February 2018, which was around the time he was hired by his
employer, but he could not recall why he stopped. (Tr. at 20.)  In his security clearance
interview  he  told  the  investigator  he  stopped  to  prepare  for  attending  college  and
apprentice school where he knew he would be required to pass a drug screening. (GE 3
at 6.) After February 2018 he described his usage as “more of a weekly basis…not every
day.” (Tr. at 20.) He estimated he would probably purchase about an ounce of marijuana
a week. (Tr. at 20-21.) When he resumed smoking marijuana in February 2018 he held a
clearance;  had  been  granted  to  classified  information,  and  he  acknowledged  in  his
testimony it was not allowed. (Tr. at 21-22; GE 1 at 27.) He explained his duties generally
and generally what his security clearance had allowed him access to inspect until it was
suspended. (Tr. at 22.)
In January 2019, Applicant was pulled over and the officer smelled marijuana in
the vehicle. A search of the vehicle found about seven ounces of marijuana in a glass
cistern, which he purchased for about $1,000.  (Tr. at 24, 25-26; GE 5.) He denied any
intentions to sell the marijuana. (Tr. at 26.) He told the investigator he would purchase
enough  to  avoid  the  long  drive.  (GE  3  at  5.)  The  felony  charge  was  reduced  to  a
misdemeanor as  part of  a  plea  agreement. He  served  the  unsuspended  portion  of  his
sentence on weekends, paid a fine, and served probation for three years. (Tr. at 24.) The
carrying  a  concealed  weapon  charge  was  dismissed.  He  claimed  that  he  was  legally
carrying the weapon. He testified; “trying to do my due diligence in reading it upon the law
on how to carry my weapon. And, I believe I had it contained legally. It was in a bag that
was zipped up that I couldn’t reach in the back of the vehicle.” (Tr. at 27.) It was inside
the bag with the marijuana. (Tr. at 34.) The weapon was not registered in his name but
stated it was a gift to him  from his brother. (Tr. at 27, 34; GE 3 at 7.) He reported the
incident to his supervisor and no action was taken by his employer. (GE 3 at 7.)
Applicant  stated  he  stopped  using  marijuana  after  January  2019  because  the
arrest was “like a reality check, you know, how fast things can go wrong.” (Tr. at 28.) He
explained to the investigator that he has his children to live for now and cannot risk  being
fired because of illegal drugs. He does not want his children around illegal drugs. (GE 3
at 7.) He has not attended any substance abuse courses. He no longer associates with
people who use marijuana. He has never failed an employer drug test. (Tr. at 29.) There
are  no  further  terms  on  his  conviction.  (Tr.  at  39.)  He  stated  in  response  to  DOHA
interrogatories he had no intention of further use of marijuana. (GE 3 at 13.)
Applicant in his Answer denied SOR ¶ 2.a. Department Counsel queried Applicant
about the denial and pointed out this was a cross-allegation of SOR ¶ 1.c. In response to
Department Counsel’s question, Applicant responded he is not disputing the Guideline J
allegation. (Tr. at 28.)
SOR ¶  3.a cross-alleges the SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.c, which Applicant denies but
admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.c.  The  underlying  facts  were  discussed  above  under
Guideline H. I applied those facts discussed above to SOR ¶ 3.a.
Applicant denies SOR ¶ 3.b, that he: Falsified material facts on a  Questionnaire
for National Security Positions (SF-86) executed on August 18, 2021, by answering “No”
to:
Section  23-Illegal  Use  of  Drugs  or  Drug  Activity  Illegal  Use  of  Drugs  or
Controlled Substances: In the last seven (7) years, have you illegally used
any drugs or controlled substances? Use of a drug or controlled substance
includes  injecting  snorting  inhaling,  swallowing  experimenting  with  or
otherwise consuming any drug or controlled substance?
He testified  he  believed  it was a  clerical error and  “when  [he] first lied  about
it in 2017. When  [he] went back and  when  [he] went to  refill  this out, a  lot  of things
[he]   didn’t  change,   and   [he] believe[s]  this is   one   of  the   pages [he]   missed,  just
skipped through.” (Answer and  Tr. at 30-31.) He believed  he  was being  open and
honest  in   his  application   when   discussing   the   discrepancy  with   the   security
clearance investigator. (GE 3  at 6.)
Applicant denies  SOR ¶ 3.c, that he: Falsified material facts on an  SF-86 dated
August 18, 2021, by answering “No” to:
Section  22-Police  Record  Police  Record  (EVER):  Other  than  those
offenses already listed, have you EVER had the following happen to you?
Have  you  EVER  been  charged  with  an  offense  involving  firearms  or
explosives?.”
Applicant reported the incident in the drug section of the SF-86. (GE 1 at 27, 34.)
He testified “I didn’t state something, but I believe it was stated in another question, and
that’s why I didn’t restate it.” (Tr. at 16-17.)
Applicant admits SOR ¶ 3.d, that he: Falsified material facts on an SF-86 executed
on September 26, 2017, pertaining to “Section 23-Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity”
when he stated “No” to whether he had illegally used drugs or controlled substances in
the last seven years. (Answer and Tr. at 30-31.) He acknowledged the lie in his testimony,
“When I filled out the one in 2017, I did lie knowingly about my marijuana usage. I was
18, freshly coming out of high school, and really didn’t know  what I was getting into when
I done that one.” (Tr. at 16.) His reason for not revealing his marijuana use at the time; “I
thought it would affect my employment.” (Tr. at 31.)
Applicant very credibly described the difference between the man he was in 2019
and the man he has become. Four years ago, he would come home, smoke marijuana,
and go to sleep. He would get off work, smoke and sleep until about 1800, 1900, 2000,
then get up and eat, maybe smoke again, and just do nothing, lay around the house all
day. (Tr. at 38.) He is now a father of three, his oldest child was born in August 2020. He
normally works during the week from 0500 to 1300. When he gets home, he takes care
of the yard and works on his truck because the children are napping until 1600. When
they wake up he is with the children making them a snack and taking them to an activity
like a jump park, painting, or playing in the sprinkler and after that it would be dinnertime.
After dinner there is some more playtime and then it is time to  “change diapers, [and] get
ready to go to bed.”  (Tr. at 38.) Typically, the weekend is spent just trying to keep  the
children  busy  and  “not  making  a  mess  inside  the  house.”  (Tr.  at  36)  He  offered  as
examples attending group children’s readings at a local bookstore or going to the beach.
His hobby is working in the driveway on his two vehicles. Aside from a “cold beer on a hot
day” otherwise he does not drink. (Tr. at 37-38.)
