Applicant is a 38-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security
clearance.  Admitted  facts  are  adopted  and  incorporated  by  reference.  Additional
findings of fact follow.
Background
Applicant  married  in  June  2008  and  has  one  daughter  (age  13)  from  this
marriage. (GE 1) He earned a high school diploma in June 2004, an associates degree
in  August  2013,  and  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  business  administration  in  August  2016.
(GE 1) He enlisted in the Army in May 2005 and served four years of active duty before
receiving an honorable discharge in May 2009. (GE 1)
Since October 2009, Applicant has been employed by his current employer as a
subcontract  manager.  (GE  1;  Tr.  28-29)  He  has  held  a  security  clearance  since
February 2012. (GE 1; Tr. 30)
Applicant’s finances
Between  2017  and  2022,  Applicant  accumulated  a  number  of  delinquent
accounts  (nine  in  all)  exceeding  $25,000  in  the  aggregate.  The  SOR-listed  debts  are
comprised  of  the  following:  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  (an  individual  investment  account  opened  in
June 2017 and reported delinquent in May 2022 for $12,064); 1.b (an individual furniture
account opened in June 2017 and reported delinquent in April 2021 for $3,457); 1.c (an
individual consumer account opened in January 2010 and reported delinquent in March
2017  for  $2,377);  1.d  (an  individual  consumer  account  opened  in  2016  and  reported
delinquent  in  April  2017  for  $2,569);  1.e  (an  individual  consumer  account  opened  in
January  2018  and  reported  delinquent  in  May  2018  for  $2,377);  1.f  (an  individual
consumer account opened in September 2016 and reported delinquent in  April 2017 for
$1,184);  1.g  (an  individual  consumer  account  opened  in  October  2016  and  reported
delinquent  in  June  2017  for  $989);  1.h  (an  individual  medical  account  opened  in
January 2017 and reported delinquent in January 2019 for $166); and 1.i (an individual
medical  account  opened  in  January  2017  and  reported  delinquent  in  May  2017  for
$166).
Applicant  attributed  his  debt  delinquencies  to  a  combination  of  poor  financial
management  on  his  part  and  significant  medical  expenses  associated  with  his  young
son’s  birth-related  kidney  and  liver  medical  complications.  (GE  8;  Tr.  25-26)  Child
emergencies  depleted  his  family’s  savings  and  contributed  to  the  disarray  of  his
finances and resulting delinquencies in his accounts. (Tr. 27-28)
All  of  Applicant’s  cited  consumer  accounts  remain  delinquent  and  unaddressed
at this time, the result of either unsuccessful creditor enforcement action (SOR ¶ 1.a) or
Applicant’s  failure  to  devote  sufficient  attention  to  his  listed-SOR  debts  (i.e.,  SOR  ¶¶
1.b-1.g). (GEs  4-7) To help him  in addressing  his  delinquent accounts  and  clear them
from his credit report, he pursued debt consolidation and credit repair in 2017. (Tr. 42)
After several months of working with the  credit repair firm without any tangible results,
he  ceased  using  the  firm.  (Tr.  42-43)  Applicant  currently  has  no  documented  plans  to
address and pay off his SOR-listed creditors. (Tr. 53-61)
Applicant  earns  $93,400  annually  in  base  salary  and  earns  additional  overtime
hours  (10  to  12)  monthly.  (Tr.  30)  After  taxes,  he  nets  approximately  $6,400  a  month
from  his  work.  And,  he  receives  an  additional  $820  a month  in  disability  benefits  from
the Veterans Administration (VA). (Tr. 30-31)
Contributing  to  his  monthly  income  is  his  wife  who,  although  not  currently
employed,  receives  $17,500  a  month  in  disability  benefits.  (Tr.  32)  Applicant  currently
has $3,230 in his checking account and $40,000 in a savings account. (Tr. 33) He also
has a modest 401(k) retirement account. (Tr. 33-34)
