Applicant  admitted  all  the  SOR  allegations,  with  explanations.  Her  admissions
are  incorporated  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  review  of  the  pleadings  and  evidence,  I
make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 52-year-old employee of a federal contractor. She has worked for
this  employer  for  over  11  years.  She  is  a  high  school  graduate  and  has  taken  some
college  courses.  She  is  single,  never  married,  and  has  no  children.  She  has  held  a
position of trust since 2011. (Tr. at 6, 20, 28; GE 1)
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant  accumulated  10  delinquent  debts
totaling
approximately $64,000 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.j). The delinquent debts included credit cards, a
personal  loan,  a  utility  debt,  and  a  medical  debt.  The  debts  are  established  by
Applicant’s  admissions  to  a  background  investigator  in  May  2021;  her  answers  to
interrogatories  in  May  2022;  credit  reports  from  May  2021,  February  2022,  October
2022,  and  October  2023;  and  her  admissions  in  her  SOR  answer.  (GE  2-7;  SOR
answer)
The  SOR  also  alleged  that  Applicant  deliberately  provided  false  information  on
her September May 2021 trustworthiness application (SF-86) concerning any delinquent
debts she made in the preceding seven years.
Financial  Considerations.
Applicant  testified  that  her  financial  difficulties  began  in  about  2016  when  her
mother,  who  lived  in  a  distant  location  from  Applicant,  was  diagnosed  with  dementia.
Her condition was so serious, the doctors stated she could not be left alone to care for
herself.  Applicant  and  her  three  siblings  took  on  the  responsibility  to  care  for  their
mother.  Applicant  had  to  travel  to  her  mother’s  location,  close  down  her  house,  and
move her to Applicant’s location. In order to fund this, she took out a personal loan and
used her credit cards. Applicant stated that this loan was also used to make payments
on her mother’s home so it would not face foreclosure by the bank. While  some of her
mother’s medical expenses were covered by Medicare, she did not qualify for Medicaid,
so  Applicant  and  her  three  siblings  had  to  fund  the  remainder  of  their  mother’s
expenses.  Applicant  was  the  main  financial  contributor  because  she  did  not  have  a
family to support like her siblings. Her mother’s sole income came from Social Security
and amounted to about $180 per month. At first, her mother resided with Applicant, but
because  of  her  declining  health,  her  doctor  recommended  that  she  be  placed  into  a
nursing  home  so  she  could  receive  full-time  medical  care  when  needed.  In  2017,
Applicant’s  mother  was  placed  into  a  nursing  home  in  close  proximity  to  where
Applicant’s brother lives. She remained there until she passed away in 2019. (Tr. 22-26)
In November 2022, Applicant entered into an agreement with a credit restoration
service (CRS). The CRS agreed to assist Applicant dispute any inaccuracies appearing
on her credit reports. Applicant paid an initial $195 fee and monthly payments of $119
for  this  service.  The  CRS  does  not  settle  or  assist  in  the  payment  of  any  delinquent
accounts.  While  she  did  an  initial  credit  evaluation,  she  did  not  receive  financial
counseling  from  the  CRS.  She  believes  the  service  has  helped  raise  her  credit  score.
(Tr. 27-28, 43-45; AE B)
The status of the SOR debts is as follows:
SOR ¶  1.a-$17,611.  This is a delinquent credit card. Applicant used this card for
cash  withdrawals  and  payments  to  fund  her  mother’s  move.  It  appears  on  her  most
recent  credit  report.  She  admitted  not  making  any  payments.  This debt  is  unresolved.
(Tr. 29-30; GE 7)
SOR ¶¶  1.b, 1.e, 1.f, 1.i-$11,699; $8,894;  $1,776;  $1,286.  These are delinquent
credit cards. Applicant used these cards for cash withdrawals and payments to fund her
mother’s move. They appear on her most recent credit report. She has several accounts
from  this  creditor  on  her  credit  report  and  she  claims  she  has  paid  and  closed  the
accounts with account numbers ending in 4332 and 9030. The account number endings
for  these  debts  are  2191,  1700,  6952,  and  6057,  respectively.  These  debts  are
unresolved. (Tr. 30; GE 3, 7; AE A)
SOR ¶  1.c-$9,454.  This is a delinquent credit card. Applicant used this card for
cash  withdrawals  and  payments  to  fund  her  mother’s  move.  It  appears  on  her  most
recent  credit  report.  She  admitted  not  making  any  payments.  This debt  is  unresolved.
(Tr.31; GE 7)
SOR ¶  1.d-$9,403.  This is a delinquent personal loan. Applicant used the funds
from this loan to pay for her mother’s move. She claims that she made payments toward
this  loan,  but  it  eventually  was  charged  off  for  nonpayment.  It  appears  on  her  latest
credit report. This debt is not resolved. (Tr. 32; GE 7)
SOR ¶ 1.g-$1,474.  This is a delinquent utility account. Applicant claims she paid
this  account  but  could  not  find  records  of  the  payment.  This  debt  does  not  appear  on
her  two  latest  credit  reports  and  it  was  too  recent  to  have  aged  off.  This  debt  is
resolved. (Tr. 33-34, GE 4, 5, 7; AE A)
SOR ¶ 1.h-$1,439.  This is a delinquent medical account. Applicant documented
making a payment of $741  towards a medical debt.  This debt does not appear on her
two  latest  credit  reports  and  it  was  too  recent  to  have  aged  off.  This  debt  is  resolved.
(Tr. 34, GE 5, 7; AE A, C, E)
SOR ¶  1.j-$1,199.  This is a delinquent credit card. It appears on her most recent
credit  report.  She  admitted not making  any  payments.  This debt  is unresolved.  (Tr.35;
GE 7)
Applicant testified that her finances are in a better state now than they have been
for a while and she is not late on her current bills. She admitted securing a car loan in
2019  for her current partner’s  daughter. Applicant makes the  $500 monthly payments,
but  the  daughter  pays  for  her  own  insurance.  The  daughter  attends  college  now.
Applicant did this because her partner could not afford to do it. (Tr. 28, 37-38; GE 2, p.
10)
Applicant claims to use a budget. Her student loans are now out of the COVID-
relief  period  and  she  will  have  to  start  making  payments  on  them.  Her  student  loan
balance  is  approximately  $31,000.  The  personal  financial  statement  she  completed  in
May  2022,  showed  a  net  monthly  remainder  after  expenses  of  $281.  This  did  not
account for making any payments on her SOR debts or toward her  student loans. (Tr.
41-42, 49-50; GE 2, p. 10, GE 7)
Personal Conduct.
Applicant credibly testified that she did not intentionally provide false information
on her SF 86 about her delinquent debts. She explained that the SF-86 was completed
on a computer and it was prepopulated with information from her previous SF-86 form.
She made the appropriate changes, but apparently the information was not saved in the
SF86’s  final  form.  Department  Counsel  indicated  she  was  satisfied  with  Applicant’s
explanation. (Tr. 36)
