In  Applicant's Answer to  the  SOR, he  admitted  to  the  allegations under Guideline
F. His admissions are incorporated into  the findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  32-year-old  cloud  engineer  for  a  government  contractor.  He  has
worked  for  his  employer  since  2019.  His  income  with  his  company  has  increased
incrementally from about $56,000 to $90,000 a year. He earned his bachelor’s degree in
2016. After college he worked odd jobs. His student loans became due in May 2017, he
did  not  have  enough  income  to make  the minimum  payments.  He has  held  an  interim
clearance  since  2022.  He  lives  with  his  domestic  partner,  and  they  have  a  preschool-
aged child. (GE 1 at 10-13; Tr. at 22, 24, 25-29.)
SOR  ¶   1.a:  past-due   account   referred   for  collection   for  $30,708.  Applicant
admitted  the  debt.  He  shared  a  rental  property  with  friends  and  each  person  was
responsible for an equal share of the rent. He elected to move out when he learned his
girlfriend  was  pregnant  with  their  child.  (Tr.  at  51.)  When  he  informed  the  property
manager  he  was  not  renewing  he  learned  their  rent  was  delinquent.  The  roommate
responsible  for  the  rental  payment  to  the  property  manager  had  been  cashing  out  his
portion  of  the  money  and  had  not  been  paying  the  rent.  (Tr.  at  52.)  He  provided
screenshots of his monthly payments to his roommate through his cash application. (AE
D; Tr. at 63.) The account appears on both credit reports the Government submitted. (GE
4; GE 5.) He thought he had worked out an agreement with the property manager, and
his  former  roommates  were  being  taken  to  court.  (Tr.  at  53.)  The  email  exchange  he
provided between the property manager was inconclusive about the steps he had taken
to be released from the lease. (AE A.)
SOR  ¶¶   1.b-1.g   are   student   loans   placed  for  collection  totaling  $40,486.
Applicant could not recall if he ever made a payment after his loans came due. He could
not afford the $200 minimum monthly payment when they came due. He cited his  monthly
income as “holding [him] back” from making any payments. (Tr. at 34.) He could not recall
if  he  contacted  anyone  to  explore  having  his  student  loans  deferred  or  put  into
forbearance  or  to  request  a  hardship  arrangement.  He  told  the  investigator  during  his
security  clearance  interview  that  in  October  2020  he  contacted  the  Department  of
Education and had his loans consolidated. He indicated he had a payment arrangement
for  $80  monthly  payments  or  possibly  $58  monthly  payments  but  did  not  provide
documentation of the payments being withdrawn from his account. Government Exhibit
4, a September 2022 credit report, shows his student loans as in collection. Government
Exhibit  5,  an  August  2023  credit  report,  does  not  list  his  student  loan  accounts  under
collection status and lists last payment date as June 2023 with a March 2023 start. (GE
2; GE 4 at 60; Tr. at 33, 34-40, 48.)  Government Exhibit 6 indicated that in March 2019,
two payments were made by a treasury offset. He could not recall having his tax refunds
garnished. (Tr. at 39, 47.) After the hearing, he provided a Department of Education email
informing him his interest payments would resume on September 1, 2023, and identified
the holder of his student loans. (AE B.) He offered an email dated August 18, 2023, from
the holder of his student loans stating his “federal student loans … are on the Standard
Repayment Plan with a current monthly payment amount of $52.” (AE C.)
