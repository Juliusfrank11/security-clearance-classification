In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations in the SOR. His
admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  32-year-old  welder  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  since  April
2018.  He  has  worked  as  a  welder  for  various  contractors  since  November  2009,  with
periods of unemployment between contracts. He received a certificate in welding from a
technical school in September 2013.  He attended a community college for about three
months  in  2016  but  did  not  receive  a  degree.  He  married  in  March  2023  and  has  no
children. (Tr. 20). He has never held a security clearance.
The SOR alleges 15 delinquent debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.o) and failure to file a federal
income tax return for tax year 2018 (SOR ¶ 1.b). The delinquent debts are reflected in
credit reports from June 2021, June 2022, and March 2023. (GX 4, 5, and 6) The evidence
concerning the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below.
SOR  ¶¶   1.a-1.e:  student   loans   referred  for  collection  of   $9,059;   $4,186;
$3,863;  $3,392;  and  $1,926.
Applicant testified that these debts were incurred while he
was  attending  technical  school  and  community  college.  (Tr.  21)  All  of  the  loans  were
delinquent before the COVID-19 deferment of collections because of Applicant’s erratic
employment, which consisted of multiple short-term, low-paying jobs. (Tr. 30) In October
2023, Applicant was approved for the Fresh Start program, and the loans were taken out
of default status and transferred to a loan servicer. On October 13, 2023, Applicant was
notified that his monthly payments of $239.40 would begin on November 7, 2023. (AX F)
SOR  ¶   1.f:   payday   loan  referred  for  collection  of   $1,062.   Applicant  admitted
that this debt was valid, but that he had taken no action to resolve it. (Tr. 36)
SOR ¶  1.g: telecommunications debt  referred for collection of  $807. Applicant
submitted proof of a payment of $1,537 to a collection agency collector for the original
creditor on October 13, 2023. (AX P)
SOR ¶  1.h: collection  account  for $462. Applicant provided no evidence of action
on this debt.
SOR  ¶¶   1.i-1.n:   medical   debts   referred  for  collection   of   $411,   $215,   $121,
$115, $87,  and $50. All these debts have been delinquent since 2017. Applicant testified
that  he  made  payment  agreements  for  these  debts  in  September  2023,  with  the  first
payments  due  in  October  2017.  The  payment  agreements  were  telephonic  and  not
reduced to writing. (Tr. 33-34) There is no documentary evidence in the record showing
that any of these debts are resolved or are being resolved.
SOR  ¶   1.o:  debt   to   fitness   club  referred   for  collection  of   $160.  Applicant
testified that he had forgotten about this debt and has taken no action to resolve it. (Tr.
39)
SOR ¶  1.p: failure  to  file  federal income  tax  return for  tax  year  2018.  Applicant
admitted that he failed to file his federal returns for 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021. He filed
all the past-due returns in February 2023. He estimated that he owes about $40,000 in
federal taxes. (Tr. 43-45) He submitted evidence that he had a payment agreement with
the IRS to pay $390 per month by direct debit. (AX E) He submitted bank records showing
that he had made the agreed payments in July, August, September, and October 2023.
(AX R, S, T, and U)
Applicant  admitted  that  he  was  indebted  to  two  insurance  companies  and  had
taken no action to resolve these debts, which were not alleged in the SOR. (Tr. 47-48)
After the hearing, he submitted evidence that he had resolved both debts. (AX I) I have
considered the evidence of these unalleged debts for the limited purpose of  evaluating
his evidence of mitigation and in my whole-person analysis.
Applicant  submitted  evidence  that  he  has  engaged  a  credit-repair  company  to
assist  him.  (AX  H)  The  debts  being  handled  by  the  credit-repair  company  include  the
collection agency for five medical debts alleged in the SOR (SOR ¶¶ 1.i, 1.j, 1.l, 1.m, and
1.n). He also submitted evidence of a payment to a medical group not alleged in the SOR
(AX N) and payments to several creditors not alleged in the SOR. (AX I through M)
In June 2019, Applicant was arrested and charged with assault and battery on a
family  member,  abduction  by  force  and  intimidation,  strangling  or  wounding  causing
injury, and destruction of property of a value less than $1,000. The incident occurred when
Applicant decided to leave a cohabitant. His cohabitant did not want him to leave, and
she started hitting him. No injuries were inflicted. (Tr. 49-50) As they were fighting and
wrestling,  his  cohabitant’s  daughter  arrived   at  the   scene,  and   they  stopped   fighting.
Applicant  found   out  three   days  later  that  his   cohabitant  had   filed   a   criminal  complaint
against  him.   (GX  7   at   4)  The   assault   and   battery   charge   was   dismissed,   but   he   was
referred  to  a  battery intervention  group  and  placed  on  supervised  probation  for two  years.
(GX 3  at 17-18) The  abduction and  strangling  charges were  nolle  prosequi. (GX  3  at 19-
22). Applicant  pleaded  guilty  to  destroying  a  cellphone.  He  was sentenced  to  12  months
in jail, suspended for 12  months, and placed on  supervised  probation  for two  years. (GX
3 at 23-24)
Applicant  is well-regarded and  respected at work.  Three project managers from
Applicant’s employer submitted statements attesting to his dependability, dedication, and
competence. (AX A, B, and C)
