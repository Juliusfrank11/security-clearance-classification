Applicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since August 2022. He served in the National Guard from 1994 to
1995  and  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  military  from  1995  until  he  was  honorably
discharged in 2001. He is a high school graduate.  He married in 1995 and divorced in
2005.  He  lived  with  a  cohabitant  from  about  2012  or  2013  to  2019.  He  currently  lives
with a different cohabitant. He has seven children. He also tragically lost a child at birth.

Applicant  was  an  E-5 and  stationed overseas  in  May  2000.  Military police  were
notified that at about 0215, Applicant and a first lieutenant from his company violated a
policy  when  they  purchased  food  from  a  vendor  after  0200.  They  were  warned  not  to
purchase  food,  but  they  refused  to  leave  until  they  purchased  the  food.  They  were
escorted to the military police station. The report indicated that the first lieutenant “was
extremely  belligerent  and  used  indecent  language  towards  the  military  police.”  The
report  indicated  there  was  sufficient  probable  cause  to  charge  Applicant  and  the  first
lieutenant  with  failure  to  obey  an  order  or  regulation,  drunk  and  disorderly  conduct,
conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman, and indecent language. It appears that
most of the alleged charges referred to the first lieutenant and not Applicant because as
an enlisted person, Applicant could not be charged with conduct unbecoming an officer,
and  the  report  did  not  state  that  Applicant  was  belligerent  or  used  indecent  language.
(GE 5)
Applicant  stated  that  he  recognized  a  first  lieutenant  from  his  unit  fighting  with
another individual. He tried to break up the fight and get the lieutenant to leave. At that
point,  the  military  police  arrived,  and  the  lieutenant  started  arguing  with  the  military
police.  Applicant  stated  that  he  tried  to  take  the  lieutenant  back  to  base,  but  the  MPs
arrested him for drunk and disorderly and failure to obey an order. (Tr. at 18-19, 85-87;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3, 5)
Applicant  stated  in  an  October  2022  background  interview  that  he  received
nonjudicial punishment under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ)
for the incident. He did not recall what he was charged with nor what punishment was
awarded.  In  his  response  to  the  SOR  and  during  his  testimony,  he  stated  that  he
refused  nonjudicial  punishment  and  requested  a  court-martial.  He  stated  that  his
command  convinced  him  to  perform  extra  duties  without  formally  going  through
nonjudicial punishment. (Tr. at 18-21, 86-87, 134-135; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE

Applicant  was  stopped  by  the  police  in  October  2005  for  speeding.  The  police
report  indicated  that  Applicant’s  speech  was  slurred  and  there  was  a  strong  odor  of
alcohol.  He  was  belligerent  and  uncooperative.  He  cursed  at  the  police  officers  and
refused to take a breath or blood test. He was arrested and charged with driving while
intoxicated (DWI). (Tr. at 87; GE 4, 6)
Applicant stated that he wanted a breath or blood test, but the police did not give
him one. He stated that the video camera and breathalyzer were not working. He denied
that  he  was  belligerent  with  the  police  officers.  He  received  some  type  of  diversion
program in which he had to report to the probation office, attend an alcohol class, and
pay fines and fees. The charge was dismissed in 2006 after he successfully completed
the diversion program. (Tr. at 88-92; GE 3)
Applicant was arrested again for DWI in about 2007. He testified that he received
a  deferred  adjudication  in  which  he  completed  a  class,  and  the  charge  was  then
dismissed. (Tr. at 88-92, 128-129) There is no independent evidence of the 2007 DWI,
and it was not alleged in the SOR. Any matter that was not alleged in the SOR cannot
be used for disqualification purposes. It may be used to assess Applicant’s credibility, in
the application of mitigating conditions, and in the whole-person analysis.
Applicant  submitted a Questionnaire  for  Public Trust  Positions  (SF 85P) in  May
2011.  He  answered  “No”  to  a  police  record  question  that  asked,  “In  the  last  7  years,
have  you  been  arrested  for,  charged  with,  or  convicted  of  any  offense(s)?  (Leave  out
traffic fines of less than $150.)” He did not report that he was arrested in May 2005 and
2007 and charged with DWI. (Tr. at 105-107; GE 2)
Applicant also answered “No” to a question on the 2011 SF 85P that asked, “Are
you now over 180 days delinquent on any loan or financial obligation? Include loans or
obligations  funded  or guaranteed  by  the  Federal  Government.”  He  failed  to  list  any  of
the  delinquent  debts  that  were  listed  on  an  August  2011  credit  report,  including  an
$8,211 charged-off auto loan. (Tr. at 114; GE 2)
Applicant  denied  intentionally  providing  false  information  on  the  SF  85P.  He
stated  that  he  misunderstood  the  police  record  question  to  be  asking  if  he  had  been
convicted. He also stated that he thought his DWI charges were more than seven years
old.  He  testified  that  he  was  unaware  that  he  had  delinquent  debts.  (Tr.  at  107-118;
Applicant’s response to SOR)
Police responded to a bar just after midnight in February 2012. The police report
indicates  that  Applicant  and  another  man  refused  to  leave  the  bar  after  security  told
them to leave. They still did not leave after the police told them to leave. They finally left
and  were  separated  by
individual  apparently  resisted
apprehension. Applicant was arrested as he started to walk toward the other individual
and the police officer. He was charged with criminal trespassing and public intoxication.
The  owner  of  the  bar  did  not  want  to  pursue  criminal  charges,  and  the  charges  were
dismissed in April 2012. (Tr. at 92-96; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3, 4, 7)
the  police.  The  other
Applicant  was  living  with  a  cohabitant  (Ms. A)  in  January  2014  when  the  police
responded  to  a  domestic  violence  call.  Ms.  A  reported  that  she  and  Applicant  had  an
argument,  and  he  told  her  that  she  had  to  leave.  She  responded  that  they  both  lived
there,  and  she  was  not  leaving.  She  told  the  police  that  he  grabbed  her,  spun  her
around, placed her in a “choke hold,” took her to the ground, and choked her. After he
released her, he again told her to leave. He choked her again when she refused. (GE 7)
When  the police  arrived, they noticed  redness  on  the  Ms. A’s neck,  bruising  on
her arm, and a welt on her knee. She told the police that Applicant had also mistreated
her in the  past. Applicant  was  arrested and charged  with the  felony  offense of assault
family/house  member  impeding  breath/circulation.  An  emergency  protective  order
(EPO)  was  issued  by  a  magistrate  forbidding  Applicant  from  communicating  with  the
cohabitant or returning to the property. (Tr. at 96; GE 4, 7)
An  investigator  contacted  Ms.  A  about  nine  days  later,  and  she  told  the
investigator that she did not want Applicant to be prosecuted. She admitted that she and
Applicant  had  been  in  contact,  and  that  he  had  returned  to  the  residence.  The
investigator  met  with  Applicant  a  few  days  later  in  February  2014.  Applicant  told  the
investigator  that  he  placed  his hands  on  the  cohabitant,  but  it  was  after  she  swung  at
him, and he was trying to restrain her to avoid being hit. He admitted that he spoke with
Ms.  A  over  the  phone,  but  she  called  him.  He  also  admitted  that  he  returned  to  the
residence to pick up his things. He was charged with violating the EPO. The case was
“no billed” in April 2014 and all charges dismissed. (GE 7)
Applicant stated that he and Ms. A had been drinking when they started arguing.
He  told  her  to  leave,  and  she  “attacked”  him.  He  grabbed  her  just  to  restrain  her.  He
denied  striking  and  choking  her.  He  stated  that  his  daughter  lived  with  him,  and  he
returned  to  the  property  because  there  was nowhere  else  for him  and  his daughter to
go,  and  Ms.  A  was  staying  with  her  mother.  (Tr.  at  97-105;  Applicant’s  response  to
SOR)
Applicant  has  not  been  arrested  or  charged  with  anything  since  the  2014
charges. He testified that he “quit drinking a long time ago,” and that “I don’t even drink
today.” He then clarified that he still drinks socially in moderation, but he no longer goes
out and parties. (Tr. at 131-132, 147, 151-153)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
September  2022.  He  answered  “No”  to  all  the  police  record  questions.  The  questions
were  in  two  sections.  The  first  section  requested  information  from  the  previous  seven
years. The second section asked:
Other  than  those  offenses  already  listed,  have  you  EVER  had  the
following happen to you?
*
*
*
•  Have  you  ever  been  charged  with  any  felony  offense?  (Include
those  under  the  Uniform  Code  of  Military  Justice  and  non-
military/civilian felony offenses)
*
*
*
•  Have  you  ever  been  charged  with  an  offense  involving  alcohol  or
drugs?
Applicant  was  interviewed  for  his  background  investigation  in  November  2022.
He  provided  negative  answers  to  all  the  criminal  questions,  including  whether  he  had
ever  been  charged  with  a  felony  or  an  offense  related  to  alcohol.  The  interviewer
reminded him that they were “ever” questions and not limited to the last seven years. He
then  discussed  his  criminal  history,  including  the  matters  discussed  above,  except  he
never discussed the 2007 DWI. He stated that he did not think he had to report the 2005
DWI  because  he  had  not  been  convicted.  He  stated  that  he  had  never  been  charged
with any other offense related to alcohol or drugs. He stated he did not report the 2014
arrest  for  domestic  violence  because  he  did  not  know  he  had  been  charged  with  a
felony. (GE 3)
Applicant denied intentionally providing false information on the 2022 SF 86. He
stated  that  he  misunderstood  the  police  record  questions  to  be  asking  if  he  had  been
“convicted.”   He  also  stated  that  he  thought  he  only  had  to  go  back  seven  years.  He
stated  that  he  discussed  the  2007  DWI  with  the  background  investigator,  but  the
investigator  did  not  include  it  in  the  report.  He  also  stated  that  he  filled  out  the  SF  86
quickly,  and  he  “breezed  through”   the  application.  (Tr.  at  25,  120-131,  135-137,  148-
149; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3)
I  did  not  find  Applicant  credible.  I  find  the  police  reports  associated  with  his
arrests to be more reliable than his testimony. I also find that he intentionally provided
false information on the 2011 SF 85P and the 2022 SF 86, as discussed further in the
analysis section.
Applicant has a history of financial problems, including a Chapter 13 bankruptcy
case  and  delinquent  debts.  He  filed  a  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  case  in  February  2023.
Under Schedule D, Creditors Holding Secured Claims, the petition listed an auto loan of
$9,782. Under Schedule E/F, Creditors Who Have Unsecured Claims, the petition listed
$4,058  owed  to  his  bankruptcy  attorney  and  13  additional  claims  totaling  $36,051.  A
$3,500 claim was for a  student  loan.  As part of the bankruptcy, Applicant surrendered
three  vehicles  to  the  holders  of  the  auto  loans.  From  March  2023  through  November
2023,  he  paid  $6,438  into  the  bankruptcy  plan.  He  received  financial  counseling  as  a
requirement of the bankruptcy. (Tr. at 22-24, 45-48; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 8;
AE E)
The SOR alleges the Chapter 13 bankruptcy case (SOR ¶ 1.a) and 15 delinquent
debts as listed on an October 2022 credit report (SOR ¶¶ 1.c-1.p) or an April 2023 credit
report (SOR ¶ 1.b). The debts include  a student loan that was $5,442 past due with a
balance of $10,358 (SOR ¶ 1.b); an auto loan that was $5,777 past due with a balance
of  $52,660  (SOR  ¶  1.o);  $1,193  in  child  support  arrearages  (SOR  ¶  1.p);  and  12
miscellaneous delinquent debts totaling about $23,600 (SOR ¶¶ 1.c-1.n).
Applicant attributed his financial problems primarily to a job  change  in which he
made  substantially  less  in  the new  job.  He  changed  jobs because  he  had  an  extreme
commute for the first job, and he was moving closer to his current cohabitant. He also
overextended himself on auto loans and helping his children. He had five vehicles with
loans  in  his  name,  including  the  vehicle  and  loan  that  was  $5,777  past  due  with  a
balance  of  $52,660  (SOR  ¶  1.o).  That  vehicle  and  a  car  were  his  vehicles.  Two  other
vehicles  were  for  his  adult  children,  and  another  was  for  Ms.  A’s  child.  They  were
supposed  to  pay  the  loans  but  had  financial  issues  associated  with  the  COVID-19
pandemic and loss of employment. As part of the bankruptcy, Applicant surrendered the
three  vehicles  for  the  children  to  the  holders  of  the  auto  loans.  The  truck  with  the
$52,660  balance  was  voluntarily  repossessed  before  the  bankruptcy.  He  still  has  the
fifth vehicle, which was reported under Section D of the bankruptcy petition. (Tr. at 22,
28-37, 42-45, 55-63, 76-77, 80-84, 152; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3, 8)
SOR  ¶  1.b  alleges  a  student  loan  that  was  $5,442  past  due  with  a  balance  of
$10,358.  Applicant  stated  this  loan  was  for  an  online  school  that  lost  its  accreditation,
after  which  the  school  forgave  the  loan.  The  debt  is  not  listed  on  the  October  2022
combined credit report. The April 2023 Equifax credit report indicates the account was
opened in July 2020, with a last payment date of March 2021. The debt is not included
in  the  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  petition.  Both  credit  reports  list  four  Department  of
Education  student  loans  totaling  $14,750  in  good  standing.  It  is  unclear  why  the
bankruptcy  petition  only  listed  one  student  loan  for  $3,500.  (Tr.  at  48-55;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 10, 11: AE F)
The  SOR  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.c-1.n  are  reported  as  delinquent  on  an
October  2022  credit  report.  They  are  included  in  the  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  case.  He
discussed the debts during his background interview in November 2022. (GE 3, 10)
SOR ¶ 1.p alleges $1,193 in child support  arrearages. That account is listed by
all three credit reporting agencies on the October 2022 combined credit report. It is not
listed  on  the  April  2023  Equifax  credit  report.  Applicant  stated  the  child  support
payments are  automatically deducted  from  his pay,  but  the  deductions  were  disrupted
when he changed jobs. He indicated he has caught up to the payments, and there are
no more arrearages. (Tr. at 39-40, 78-79; AE F)
Applicant  submitted  documents  and  letters  attesting  to  his  excellent  job
performance  and  strong  moral  character.  He  is  praised  for  his  reliability,  work  ethic,
dedication, and integrity. (AE A-D)
