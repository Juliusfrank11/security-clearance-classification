Applicant  admitted  all  the  SOR allegations, except for SOR ¶¶  1.c and  1.f,  which
he  denied. Additionally, while acknowledging  his erroneous answers  as stated  in SOR ¶¶
1.a   and   1.b,   he   denied   his   answers   were   deliberate   falsifications.  His   admissions   are
adopted   as   findings   of   fact.  After  a   thorough   and   careful  review  of   the   pleadings  and
exhibits submitted, I make the  following  additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 30 years old. He has worked for defense contractors since January
2018. He has a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering. He is married but has no
children. He has held a security clearance since 2018. (Tr. 11, 54-55; GE 1)
Under  Guideline  E,  the  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  deliberately  gave  false
information on his March 2018 security clearance application (SCA), and his March 2021
SCA when he failed to disclose his illegal drug use of marijuana, cocaine, and Adderall,
at  various  times  on  both  SCAs.  It  also  alleged  he  failed  to  disclose  his  purchases  of
marijuana, at various times, on both SCAs. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.f)
Applicant's  answers  were  false  because  he  admitted  using  marijuana  various
times in 2014, 2015 and 2017. He admitted purchasing marijuana at various times in 2014
and  2015.  He  admitted  using  cocaine  once  in  2016  and  once  in  2017.  His  last  use  of
illegal drugs was in 2017. (None of this conduct was alleged in the SOR and it will not be
used  for  disqualification  purposes.  It  may  be  used  for  credibility,  mitigation,  and  for  a
whole-person assessment.) Applicant admitted intentionally falsifying his answers to the
March 2021 SCA concerning his past drug use and purchases. He did so because he
was afraid that if he answered truthfully on his March 2021 SCA, the inconsistency of his
answers with his March 2018 SCA answers would cost him his job. (Tr. 24-25, 27, 30; GE
2, 3)
At the time Applicant filled out his first SCA in March 2018, he was working for his
first defense contractor (DC1). He admitted the falsity of the information that he submitted
on his 2018 SCA concerning his past drug use and purchases, but denied any deliberate
intent to deceive with that information. Rather, he maintains that he misunderstood the
question  and  provided  the  negative  response  based  upon  his  misunderstanding.  He
believed the question was asking him if he was currently using any illegal drugs or if he
had  a  drug  addiction  problem.  He  maintained  that  he  had  no  reason  to  report  to  his
security officer or any other management official his false answers on this 2018 SCA any
time before his realization that he misunderstood the questions, which did not occur until
he  was  completing  his  March  2021  SCA.  Applicant  testified  that  he  did  not  undergo  a
background interview with an investigator after submitting his March 2018 SCA. There is
no evidence in the record of a background interview after he submitted his March 2018
SCA, or before completing his March 2021 SCA. (Tr. 23-24, 45; GE 1-2)
The Section 23 of the SCAs states as follows:
In   the   last   seven   years,  have   you   illegally  used   any  drugs  or  controlled
substances?   Use   of   a   drug   or  controlled   substance   includes  injecting,
inhaling, swallowing, experimenting  with  or otherwise consuming  any drug
or controlled substance?
In  the  last  seven  years, have  you  been  involved  in the  illegal purchase  . . .
of any drug or controlled substance?
Applicant responded with “No” answers to both the above questions. (Tr. 23; GE 1-2)
Applicant testified that he considers himself a detailed-oriented person. A witness
also  acknowledged  that  Applicant  was  detailed  oriented  in  his  work  where  he  had  to
comprehend schematics and planning documents. (Tr. 45, 75)
Applicant denied that he misused the prescription drug Adderall and therefore his
March 2018 SCA answer indicating the same was not a deliberate false answer. He was
prescribed Adderall while in college. His doctor recommended taking the medication in
the morning with food. Sometimes he took the medicine in the evenings so he could stay
awake to study. Upon completing interrogatories in December 2022, he stated that it was
wrong and illegal for him to do so (taking Adderall in the evenings). Since supplying that
answer, he has come to realize that he did not misuse the prescription because he never
exceeded the prescribed dosage and while the recommended dosage taking time was in
the  morning,  there  was  no  legal prohibition  preventing  him  from  taking  the  medication
later in the day, as needed. (Tr. 25, GE 3 (See interrogatory narrative answers under “II.
DRUG USE”); SOR Answer)
In  March  2021,  Applicant  was  hired  by  a  second  defense  contractor  (DC2),  his
current employer. He completed a new SCA in March 2021. He testified that when he
was  completing  the  drug  use/abuse  section  of  this  SCA,  he  realized  that  he  had
misunderstood  the  related  questions  listed above  when  he  completed  his  March  2018
SCA. At this moment, he understood that the questions were asking whether in the past
seven  years  he  had  used  or  purchased  illegal  drugs  and  that  his  March  2018  SCA
answers were false. He again answered falsely to the March 2021 SCA drug questions
knowing they were false at the time. (Tr. 27, 30, 47; GE 1)
These answers were false because he admitted using marijuana various times in
2014, 2015 and 2017. He admitted purchasing marijuana at various times in 2014 and
2015. He admitted using cocaine once in 2016 and once in 2017. His last use of illegal
drugs was in 2017. (None of this conduct was alleged in the SOR and it will not be used
for disqualification purposes. It may be used for credibility, mitigation, and for a whole-
person assessment.) Applicant admitted intentionally falsifying his answers to the March
2021 SCA concerning his past drug use and purchases. He did so because he was afraid
that if he answered truthfully on his March 2021 SCA, the inconsistency of his answers
with his March 2018 SCA answers would cost him his job. (Tr. 24-25, 27, 30; GE 2, 3)
On  March  11, 2021,  Applicant  signed  and  certified  his SCA  answers were  true,
complete, and correct, after acknowledging the warning under 18 USC 1001, which sets
forth the consequences of providing intentionally false information. He claims that he felt
guilty almost immediately about intentionally providing false answers on his March 2021
SCA after he completed it. He even lost sleep thinking about his dishonest answers. He
did  not  inform  his  supervisor  or  facility  security  officer  about  what  he  did.  Instead,  he
waited approximately seven weeks until his background interview on April 28, 2021, to
bring  it  up  with  the  investigator.  He  initially  testified  that  he  thought  his  background
interview was just two weeks after he completed his March 2021 SCA. (Tr. 28-29, 49, 58;
GE 1, 3)
During Applicant’s April 28, 2021, background interview, after he was administered
the oath, he immediately admitted his past drug use and history. He admitted giving false
information about his past drug use on his 2021 SCA, as well as  on his 2018 SCA. He
told the investigator he did this because he was scared that he would not get a clearance
and might lose his job. There is no mention of Applicant stating he misunderstood the
2018 SCA questions about past drug use. He further expressed his regrets for providing
the false information. (GE 3 (See enhanced subject interview))
Applicant regrets his poor decisions. To  help  with  his future decision-making, he
completed  an  education  program entitled  “Discovering  Better Choices.” He learned  that
he  cannot  let  his own moral values  be  compromised  by the  decisions he  makes. He  must
be honest and  accept the consequences of his actions. (Tr. 32-33; AE A)
Applicant  had  three  witnesses  testify  for  him.  Two  of  the  witnesses  know  him
through his current job. Both spoke highly of his honesty, trustworthiness, work ethic, and
communication skills. Both recommended that he continue to have access to classified
information. The third witness is a family friend who has known Applicant since he was a
child.  This  witness  is  also  a  retired  military  officer  who  held  a  security  clearance.  He
described  Applicant  as  honest,  truthful,  and  reliable.  He  knows  that  Applicant  deeply
regrets his actions that brought him here. He has no security concerns about Applicant.
(Tr. 60-61, 63-64, 71-75, 80, 83-86)
