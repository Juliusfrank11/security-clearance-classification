1.h, 1.l-1.m, and 1.o with clarification and denied SOR ¶¶ 1.g, 1.i-1.k, 1.n, and 1.p with
clarification under Guideline F. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact.
Applicant is a 55-year-old retired Army veteran. He was honorably discharged in
2006.  He has been married five times and has three adult children. His divorces occurred
in 1993, 1999, 2001, 2013, and 2020. He was required to pay $571.76 in monthly alimony
to his fourth wife through November 2022. (Tr. at 43-44.) He earned his bachelor’s degree
in 2013 and his master’s degree in 2015. He has worked for a Federal contractor since
2010. He also worked as an independent contractor from October 2010 to October 2014.
(Tr. at 46.) He has been in his current position since May 2022. He has experienced brief
periods  of  unemployment  when  he  was  between  contracts  and  after  retiring  from  the
military. (Tr. at 45-46.) The largest period of unemployment for him was three months in
2015. (Tr. at 29; GE 1.) His most recent security clearance was granted in 2017. (GE 1;
Tr. at 47.)
SOR ¶¶  1.a and 1.b-1.e:  A June  2018  tax  lien by  the  Federal  government  for
$166,567.00  for  tax  years  2010  through  2016  and delinquent  tax  debt  to  the  Federal
Government   for  tax   years   2017   through   2020   in  the   amounts   of   $8,947,  $11,287,
$7,311,   and   $10,063   respectively   that  remains   unpaid.  Applicant  in   his   security
clearance  application  admitted  that his taxes were delinquent for tax years 2013 through
2018. He cited  being  unable to  obtain  the  appropriate  records  and  that  this was  during
the  period  he  was  an  independent contractor. (GE 1; Tr.  at  48-49.) He did  not discover
the  problem  until he  switched his limited  liability company (LLC)  from a 1099 payment to
a  W-2. He could not  tell  “exactly what documents” he  was told he  was missing  at the  time.
(Tr. at 49.) He explained  he  was “just  relying  on  whoever filed  [his]  taxes at  the  time” and
what they  told  him  for why he  did  not  adjust his tax withholdings.  (Tr. at  52.) He went  to  a
tax lawyer to  try to  get  back on  track.  He has not made  any voluntary payments to  the
IRS  since  2014  when  he  started  with  the  first  tax relief company. (Tr. at 56.) He has been
working  with  the  second  tax relief company since  April 2019.  (Tr. at  53.) He  acknowledged
his security clearance  was in jeopardy,  which  was why he  retained  the  tax relief  company
to  assist him  in getting  his tax debt down. He did not think  it was in his best interest  to  talk
to  the  IRS  himself.  He  testified  he  was  told  by  his tax  relief  company “the  best  way  forward
is  to   let   them   negotiate   the   monies   owed”  but  added   “With   me   doing   it   on   my   own   I'll
probably get  the same  results that they would get.” (Tr. at 57.)

of  $9,682.  Applicant  admitted  this  debt.  He  testified  his  wages  were  garnished  for  his
delinquent  state  taxes  in  August  2020,  but  he  did  not  know  what  tax  years  the
garnishment  covered.  The  state  tax  returns  that  he  provided  with  his  supplemental
interrogatory responses indicated he owed state  taxes in the amount of $8,587 for tax
year 2018 and $1,095 for tax year 2020. (Tr. at 58.) He testified the tax relief company
was also negotiating a resolution to the state delinquency. (Tr. at 60.)

relief  company  reported  he  had a total debt of  $60,899  enrolled. He  has  been  making
$862 monthly payments to this debt relief company. (AE C.) He provided exhibits showing

C at 4, 6.) This debt is resolved.
Applicant   testified   “the   best  way   forward”  was  for   him   to   stick  with   the   payment
plan  with  the  debt relief company to  resolve  his debts.  He testified  that  the  first part of
being   enrolling   in  the   debt  relief  program   was  to   undergo   financial  counselling   and
