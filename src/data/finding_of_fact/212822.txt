In Applicant’s response to the SOR, he admitted all allegations (SOR ¶¶ 1.a - 1.h)
except the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.e, which he denied. His admissions are incorporated in
my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked as a
full-time  management  analyst  with  multiple  defense  contractors  supporting  the  same
government  office  since  August  2009.  He  testified  he  earns  about  $106,000  per  year,
and that he anticipates a pay raise in March 2024. From November 2019 to about May
2021, he worked as a part-time salesman with a non-defense employer. He earned about
$9 per hour and worked an estimated 12 hours per week. He stated he left the part-time
position due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He also stated he received a 401(k) plan through
this part-time employer, but that he was unaware of the value of the plan. (GEs 1 and 4;
Tr. 27-29)
Applicant  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  May  2001.  Though he has  never been
married, he has resided with a cohabitant girlfriend since about March 2019. He has a
16-year-old son who resides with him. He also testified he has a second minor child, about
seven  years  old,  whom  he  supports  financially  but  does  not  maintain  physical  contact
with. He volunteered that he financially supports his second child through court-ordered
child support payments of $441 every two weeks. (GEs 1 and 4; Tr. 19, 62-63)
Applicant testified he pays $2,519 per month for rent, and that he neither receives
nor provides financial support to anyone, other than the child support payments discussed
above.  He  testified  his  cohabitant  girlfriend  is  an  accountant  employed  by  a  major
company. He testified she helps him with groceries and electricity expenses. (Tr. 62-64)
He also testified she paid for their vacation to the Bahamas in August 2023 in celebration
of his birthday. (Tr. at 66)
In response to questions in his November 2021 SCA, Applicant denied having any
financial  issues.  (GE  1  pp.  31-32)  He  also  denied  having  any  delinquent  debts  when
initially asked by DOD investigators during his May 2022 interview. (GE 4 at 2) It was only
after investigators confronted him with specific debts that he agreed and discussed his
delinquent debts with them. He informed investigators that he was a private person, and
that only his mother knew about his delinquent debts. (GE 4 pp. 3, 6) During the hearing,
Applicant disclosed he owed the federal government about $4,500 for 2019 income taxes,
but stated he cleared the debt and no longer owes it. (Tr. at 64) Delinquent income taxes
were not alleged in the SOR.
Applicant has not sought professional financial counseling services or advice, but
stated he discussed financial matters informally with acquaintances because he desired
to buy a home. (Tr. at 66) He disclosed he was granted eligibility for access to classified
or  sensitive  information  in  about  April  2004.  He  currently  holds  a  secret-level  security
clearance. (GE 1 at 30; Tr. at 8) He described his current financial situation as stable and
stated he is currently able to meet his financial obligations. (GE 4 at 4; Tr. at 72)
The  SOR  alleged  eight  financial  concerns  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  - 1.h)  totaling  about
$117,000 in delinquent debts. Amongst the eight allegations are two delinquent student
loans (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b) totaling about $63,718, or 54% of the total alleged delinquent
debts.
The evidence regarding financial issues alleged in the SOR is summarized below.
SOR ¶¶  1.a  ($38,297) and 1.b  ($25,421): Applicant admitted being delinquent on
his  two  U.S.  Department  of  Education  (DOE)  student  loans.  In  his  SOR  response,  he
stated he applied for student loan forgiveness in an effort to resolve these loans.  Both
student loans were placed for collection and assigned to the government as indicated in
his April 2022 credit bureau report (CBR). (GE 2 at 2)
Applicant testified he took out these student loans between 2002 and 2004. He
stated  he  initially  paid  either  $109  or  $120  per  month,  and  that  he  stopped  making
payments in about 2005. He stated he restarted payments of either $250 or $344, but he
could not remember when. (Tr. 34-35) He again stopped making payments at an unknown
time  and  testified  he  had  not  made  any  full  payments  since  2018  or  2019,  before  the
COVID-19 pandemic. (Tr. at 35). At some point he began making payments on a student
loan  rehabilitation  program.  He  stated  he  then  applied  for  student  loan  forgiveness  by
sending a short email to the DOE. He received a letter from DOE in either 2021 or 2022
indicating his student loans were paused under President Biden’s program. (Tr. 36-38) At
the hearing, Applicant presented a letter from DOE dated August 16, 2023, which notified
him  that the  student loan  repayment  pause or deferment  was ending  and that  student
loan payments would resume in September 2023. He did not provide a copy of the letter
at the hearing. (Tr. at 37) I left the record open for a week to allow Applicant to submit a
copy of the August 16, 2023 letter and any additional documentary evidence, especially
concerning his student loans. He did not submit any documentary evidence on his student
loans during this period; nor did he submit a record copy of the August 16, 2023 letter
referenced above.
SOR  ¶   1.c   ($18,269):   Applicant  admitted  this  delinquent  debt.  In  his  SOR
response and at the hearing, Applicant stated he contacted the creditor many times but
the creditor would not accept payments, but would accept a settlement of the delinquent
debt. This individual account was opened in October 2014, and the last payment made
on  it  occurred  in  October  2018.  (GE  3  at  4;  Tr.  39-42).  The  debt  was  assigned  to  a
collection agent in December 2019, and ultimately charged off for the full $18,269. (GE 3
at 3)
SOR ¶ 1.d ($804): Applicant admitted this debt. In his SOR response and at the
hearing, he stated his intent to resolve the debt. He testified he contacted the creditor in
March 2023 and made a payment of $100 during the conversation, leaving a balance due
of $704. This is the first and only payment he made on this delinquent debt. He stated the
debt was from rental equipment he did not return. (Tr. 42-47) He opened this individual
account in 2018 or 2017, and first received notice of the delinquency in 2019 or 2020 (GE
2 at 3; Tr. 45-46)
SOR ¶  1.e  ($565): Applicant denied this debt in his SOR response, stating he was
unfamiliar with the creditor. However, at the hearing he admitted knowledge of the debt
after becoming familiar with the underlying facts on the creditor’s website. This individual
account is being collected by a third-party. Applicant stated this was for a claim against
him  by  the  person  causing  a  rental  car  accident.  The  debt  was  originally  assigned  in
January  2018.  He  recently  made  payment  arrangements  with  the  creditor  where  he
agreed to pay about $141 every two weeks starting in August 2023 until the debt is paid
off. He presented proof he is in compliance with these arrangements. (GE 2 at 3; GE 3
pp. 1-2; GE 4 at 3; Tr. 48-52; and AE A;) This debt is being resolved.
SOR ¶  1.f  ($421): Applicant admitted this delinquent debt and stated in his SOR
response  that  the  debt  had  been  paid  in  full.  (Tr.  52-54)  This  individual  account  was
assigned in March 2020. Applicant stated he had made payments on the account of about
$22 per month (GE 4 at 3). He believed he paid off the debt in about April 2021, and that
he would locate the receipt. No paid receipt was received for this debt. (Tr. at 53-54)
SOR  ¶   1.g   ($52):  Applicant  admitted  this  delinquent  debt  and  stated  he  would
contact the creditor and make arrangements to pay it off. He testified the debt was actually
$74 and that he paid it off in about January 2023. (Tr. 54-55)  This individual account was
assigned in November 2016. (GE 2 AT 4; Tr. 55, 57) He presented a receipt showing he
paid off the debt in January 2023. (AE B at 2) This debt is resolved.
SOR ¶  1.h ($2,700  past due of  $33,207  total balance): Applicant admitted this
delinquent debt, an automobile loan, in his SOR response and at the hearing. He opened
this  individual  account  in  March  2020.  In  April  2022,  the  creditor  reported  a  120-day
delinquency with a past-due balance of $2,700. (GE 2 at 4) Applicant testified he offered
to make a payment, but the creditor refused to accept it. The creditor demanded the full
balance of the account. (Tr. 57-60) Applicant testified the car is still in his possession, and
that the creditor never repossessed it though he provided the creditor with the location of
the  car.  The  last  payment  he  made  occurred  in  May  2022.  (Tr.  57-60)  The  creditor
ultimately charged off this delinquent debt for $29,856 as reported in Applicant’s August
2023 credit bureau report. (GE 3 at 4; Tr. at 60)
