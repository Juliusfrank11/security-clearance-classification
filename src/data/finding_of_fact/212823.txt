In  his  Answer,  Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.c  and  denied  SOR  ¶  1.d  with
explanations. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough
and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  evidence  submitted,  I  make  the  following
additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  45  years  old.  He  is  married  and  has  two  children.  He  received  a
bachelor’s  degree  in  2006  and  a  master’s  degree  in  business  administration  in  2010.
Since  January 2011, he  has  been  consistently  employed  in  various  full-time  positions.
He  has  been  with  his  current,  sponsoring  employer  since  January  2023.  He  has  not
previously held a security clearance. (GX 1-2; Tr. 9, 19-22)
The SOR alleges two private student loans totaling about $45,500 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a
and  1.b);  a  federal  tax  debt  of  $4,568  for  tax  year  (TY)  2016  (SOR  ¶  1.d)  and  that
Applicant  failed  to  timely  file  his  federal  tax  return  for  TY  2018  (SOR  ¶  1.c).  The
allegations are established by his  admissions, his responses to interrogatories, and by
various credit reports and IRS account transcripts. (GX 1-5; AX C-D)
SOR  ¶¶  1.a  ($13,004)  and  1.b  ($32,464)  are  two  of  four  private  student  loans
that Applicant cosigned for his then-girlfriend, now his wife, to attend nursing school in
2008 and 2009. The loans became due in 2012 and she began making timely payments
of $600 per month. They married in 2013. (GX 1-3; Tr. 24-28)
In  2015,  Applicant’s  wife  became  pregnant  and  eventually  stopped  working  for
several  months.  Applicant  claimed  that,  during  this  time,  he  was  unaware  that  she
stopped paying on two of the loans. In 2016, the creditor began calling Applicant, but he
initially  refused  to  answer  because  he  believed  the  loans  were  being  paid  by  his  wife
and he had no other accounts with the creditor. (GX 1-3; Tr. 25-32)
Finally, by early 2017, Applicant communicated with the creditor and learned that
the two loans were behind. He testified that he applied for a resumption of payments at
a reduced rate based on economic hardship. This request was denied. He then claimed
to  have  offered  a  $3,000  payment  from  his  emergency  savings  to  bring  the  loans
current. The creditor informed him that the two loans had been charged off and that  a
payment would not  change  their  status. Applicant  believed the  delinquent  loans would
transfer  to  a  collection  agency  and  waited  for  someone  to  contact  him.  He  further
claimed that no one ever reached out for payment. (GX 1-2; Tr. 26-30, 52-55)
Applicant  testified  that  his  wife  never  stopped  paying  on  the  two  loans  that
remained in good standing with the original creditor. In 2018, he researched his financial
options online and called the creditor quarterly to see if he could resolve the charged-off
loans  or  pay  to  have  the  negative  reporting  of  the  loans  be  removed  from  his  credit
reports.  He  testified  that  the  creditor  took  no  action  in  response.  (GX  2;  Tr. 33-35,
52-59)
With the birth of his second child in 2019, Applicant testified that he took a break
from contacting the creditor about the charged-off loans. He resumed his efforts in 2020
and  claimed  his  wife  submitted  an  application  to  consolidate  the  loans.  During  the
application  process,  only  the  two  active  loans,  and  not  the  two  charged-off  loans,
appeared in her paperwork. For unknown reasons, his wife did not qualify for any  loan
consolidation. Payments on the two loans in good standing continued. (GX 1-2; Tr. 33,
53-56, 62-65)
In  2021,  Applicant’s  work  transitioned  to  governmental  services,  and  he  knew
that the charged-off loans could be a concern in a background investigation. He testified
that,  during  this  period,  he  contacted  the  creditor  and  asked  to  be  removed  from  the
loan as a cosigner. He also claimed to have offered $10,000 to settle the debt. In both
instances,  Applicant  claimed  that  the  creditor  refused  to  act  as  the  loans  had  been
charged off. (GX 2; Tr. 57-60)
Applicant  disclosed  the  loans  in  his  September  2021  SCA  and  claimed  he  was
attempting to set up a payment plan with the creditor. During his October 2021 interview
with a background investigator, he clarified that he made additional attempts to contact
the  creditor  to  negotiate  the  removal  of  the  charged-off  loans  from  his  credit  report.
During this period, he learned from the creditor that the two loans in good standing were
being transferred to another lender. He hoped the new lender would be able to provide
some information on the charged-off loans. (GX 1-2; Tr. 31-34, 62-65)
In early 2023, the original creditor transferred the  two remaining loans to a new
creditor.  Applicant  testified  that  he  and  his  wife  continue  to  make  timely  payments  on
those loans and estimates the combined balance to be about $40,000. He testified that
he  also  inquired  with  the  new  creditor  as  to  the  status  of  the  charged-off  loans.
However,  he  was  informed  that  the  new  creditor  did  not  have  the  loans  and  he  was
referred back to the original creditor. (GX 2; Tr. 28-34, 62-64)
At  hearing,  Applicant   admitted   that  he   never  received   an   IRS   Form   1099-
Cancellation  of Debt  or any  documentation  from  the  original creditor indicating  that  the
loans were closed. He described communicating with the original creditor over the years
as hitting a “brick wall,” and everything going into a “black hole.” Applicant’s November
2023  credit  report  shows  the  two  loans  as  charged  off  in  the  combined  amount  of
$45,468. (GX 5; Tr. 30, 48-49)
After the hearing, Applicant submitted correspondence from the original  creditor,
dated  December  2023,  regarding  the  two  charged-off  loans.  It  stated  that  “due  to  the
age  of  your debt,  we will  no  longer attempt to  collect  from  you”  and  that  no  additional
payments on the loans were required. Applicant also submitted a budget that reflected
continued  payments  on  three  student  loans.  He  did  not  specify  whether  these  were
payments  on  any of his wife’s student  loans or his own student  loans that remained  in
good  standing.  This  budget  also  showed  that  Applicant  maintained  a  net  monthly
remainder, after expenses and retirement contributions, of about $4,800. (AX B, E-G)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges that Applicant owed $4,568 in past-due taxes for TY 2016. At
hearing,  Applicant  admitted  that  he  previously  owed  past-due  taxes  for  TY  2016  and
explained  that  he  experienced  increased  income  that  year  and  insufficient  funds  were
withheld  by  his  employer.  Applicant  also  described  experiencing  financial  and  marital
issues during this time and admitted he was slow to address the problem, but that the
tax return had since been filed and the taxes paid. (GX 1-2; Tr. 43-45)
Post-hearing  documentation  included  an  IRS  account  transcript  for  TY  2016.  It
shows that Applicant filed the return in April 2018, and was assessed penalties for the
late  filing  and  late  payment.  He  made  periodic  payments  between  2019  and  January
2023. The TY 2016 taxes have now been paid. (AX C)
An  IRS  account  transcript  for  TY  2017  reflects  that  Applicant  filed  this  return  in
May 2018 and received a penalty for the late filing and late payment. Beyond the initial
withholding,  Applicant  made  payments  in  2019  and  2020  toward  this  tax  debt,  which
has now been paid. (GX 2)
SOR  ¶  1.c  alleges  that  Applicant  failed  to  timely  file  his  TY  2018  return.  At
hearing, Applicant provided documentation reflecting that he attempted to file this return
late,  in 2020.  However, he  forgot to  sign  the return and it  was  rejected by  the  IRS. At
that time, Applicant also had a job offer fall through and moved his family twice in one
year. He admitted he forgot about resubmitting the tax return, but said that it had since
been filed and paid. An IRS account transcript reflects that he refiled his TY 2018 return
in  January  2023  and  received  penalties  for  the  late  filing  and  late  payment.  In  May
2023,  Applicant  issued  a  payment  to  the  IRS  for  $6,179,  part  of  which  resolved  his
remaining balance for TY 2018. (GX 1-2; AX A-B, D; Tr. 35-39)
Applicant  timely  filed  his  TY  2019  return.  A  $723  credit  was  transferred  to  pay
unspecified taxes owed for TY 2015. Similarly, Applicant timely filed his TY 2020 return
and received a refund. However, $5,158 was credited towards his past-due taxes owed
for TYs 2015 and 2016. (GX 2; AX C)
With regard to Applicant’s TY 2021 obligations, an IRS account transcript, printed
in June 2022, showed that the return had not been filed. At hearing, Applicant  testified
that he had since filed the return and owed no additional taxes for that year, but did not
provide an updated IRS account transcript or other documentary evidence in support of
this assertion. (GX 2; Tr. 39-40)
Applicant  testified  that  he  filed  his  TY  2022  return  early,  but  owed  between
$9,000 and $10,000 in additional taxes. This was because of a miscalculation involving
his  wife’s  income  and  several  months  of  insufficient  withholdings  by  her  employer.  To
address this tax debt, Applicant claimed that he submitted multiple payments to the IRS
in 2023 from $500 to $1,000 and that the back taxes would be paid by the end of 2023.
His budget included a $500 monthly payment for taxes. (AX G; Tr. 39-42)
Applicant  testified  that,  in  the  last  two  years,  his  financial  situation  had
significantly  improved,  and  he  was  now  financially  stable  and  maintaining  his  monthly
expenditures as well as  an emergency fund. He  also followed general financial advice
online and used a web-based budgeting system that allowed him to closely monitor the
family  budget.  Beyond  the  two  charged-off  student  loans,  he  testified  that  he  has  no
additional delinquent debts. This is supported by his November 2023 credit report. (GX
5; AX G; Tr. 45-46)
