The SOR alleges Applicant was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol
(DUI) in May 2014 and arrested for driving while intoxicated (DWI) in February 2020, and
that he pled guilty to both offenses. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.b) His DUI and DWI were cross-alleged
as criminal conduct under Guideline J. (SOR ¶ 2.a) In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he
admitted  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.b,  but  did  not  specifically  admit  or  deny  the
allegation in SOR ¶ 2.a. During the hearing, he admitted the allegation in SOR ¶ 2.a. His
admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. (Answer; Tr. 7-8)
Applicant  is  a  42-year-old  aircraft  mechanic  employed  by  a  defense  contractor
since May 2019. He was employed by a different defense contractor from October 2017
to  May 2019.  He  served  in the  United  States  Air Force  from October 2002 to October
2017 and was honorably discharged as a staff sergeant (E-5). He has served in the Air
Force Reserve or Air Guard since October 2017 and was promoted to master sergeant
(E-7) in July 2022. He has been awarded numerous awards and decorations including
the Air Force Achievement Medal (three oak leaf clusters) and Air Force Good Conduct
Medal (three oak leaf clusters). He successfully completed extensive military training and
education  and  has  made  multiple  overseas  deployments.  He  has  held  a  security
clearance since 2003. (GE 1; AE A-B; Tr. 23-27, 48-52, 54-56)
Applicant received  an  associate  degree  in November 2012. He  has  taken  college
courses  since   September   2018   and   is  pursuing   a   degree   in  aviation   science
management.  He  was married  from  October 2002  to  May 2006, and  has one  child, age
20. (GE 1; AE  B: Tr. 25-26, 52-54)
In May 2014, Applicant was stopped by a local police officer after he was observed
erratically operating a vehicle. He failed a field sobriety test, and a breathalyzer registered
a blood-alcohol content (BAC) of 0.152. He was arrested for DUI. He pled guilty in a state
court  and  was  placed  on  probation  for  six  months,  fined,  had  his  driver’s  license
suspended for 90 days, and had an ignition interlock device installed in his vehicle for six
months. He was required to complete an Air Force alcohol, drugs, and abuse prevention
treatment course, and received a letter of reprimand from his commander. (Answer; GE
1-2; AE B; Tr. 20-21, 28-38, 56-57)
Before his 2014 arrest, Applicant had consumed an unrecalled quantity of alcohol
in a bar. He was heartbroken after learning his prospective fiancé had been unfaithful to
him. He took a taxi home from the bar, but after arriving at his residence realized he had
lost his cellphone. He then made the admittedly poor decision to get into his truck and go
to look for his cellphone. He pulled onto a road in front of a police car and proceeded to
the left turn lane. When the left turn light turned green, he remained stationary for about
five seconds, and the police officer pulled him over. (Tr. 20-21, 28-38, 56-57; AE B)
In  February  2020,  Applicant  was  stopped  by  a  local  police  officer  after  he  was
observed driving the wrong way on an access road. He told the police officer that he was
not familiar with the area, had three or four drinks that night, and that he had stopped
drinking  60-90  minutes  before  being  pulled  over.  The  police  officer  attempted  to
administer  a  field  sobriety  test,  but  Applicant  disputed  some  procedures  and  did  not
perform parts of the test, so the officer interpreted his actions as a refusal. Applicant was
arrested for DWI. He was administered two breathalyzers and registered a blood-alcohol
content (BAC) of 0.147 and 0.150. In March 2021, a deferred adjudication was entered,
and the charges were dismissed pursuant to the deferred adjudication in May 2022. He
was fined $500 and had an ignition interlock device placed on his vehicle. He completed
a DWI driver education program in May 2020, a state-mandated online alcohol education
program in October 2020, and a 16-hour program in May 2022 that included counselling.
(Answer; GE 3-4; Tr. 21, 38-44, 58-59)
Applicant said he went out with friends for a few drinks and to reflect on his father’s
death. His friends wanted to go to a bar, and Applicant drove them. He consumed several
drinks over six or seven hours and said his last drink, a mixed drink, was stronger than
he had anticipated. After his DWI arrest, he refocused his life, disassociated himself from
friends who drank excessively and “party mode” environments. (Tr. 61) He abstained from
the  use  of  alcohol  from  February  2020  until  June  2022.  Since  June  2022  he  has
occasionally consumed one to three beers or seltzers at social events, said that he has
not been intoxicated, and no longer drinks hard liquor. He said he has not  driven after
consuming alcoholic beverages since February 2020 and has never been intoxicated at
work. (AE B; Tr. 21, 38-47, 58-62)
Character  letters  from  two  of  Applicant’s  former  supervisors  and  long-term
colleagues praised his work ethic, expertise, positive attitude, trustworthiness, honesty,
integrity, loyalty, judgment, character, and favorable security clearance history. (AE A at
3-5) A character letter from one former supervisor, an Air Force Major, noted his two DWIs
were out of character, that he was ashamed of his behavior, has owned up to his mistakes
and  worked  to  bounce  back.  (AE  A  at  3-4)  Character  letters  from  four  of  Applicant’s
colleagues  and  long-term  friends  commented  favorably  on  his  work  ethic,  leadership,
expertise,  loyalty,  trustworthiness,  compassion  for  others,  commitment  to  mission  and
country, suitability for a security clearance, remorse for his alcohol-related incidents, and
his  commitment  to  sobriety.  (AE  A  at  6-9)  Applicant’s  girlfriend  of  about  18  months,  a
government employee and former spouse of an alcoholic, wrote that he disclosed his two
DUIs  on  their  first  date  and  is  remorseful  for  his  actions,  does  not  consume  alcohol  if
driving, and consumes no more than two drinks during occasional social interactions. She
said he is responsible, has earned her trust, and always tries to take care of others. (AE
A at 2)
I  found  Applicant's  responses  and  demeanor  at  the  hearing  to  be  credible  and
consistent  with  someone  who  was  reliably  telling  the  truth.  After  reviewing  the  entire
record,  I  find  that  his  hearing  testimony  is  corroborated  by  documentary  evidence
submitted by the government and his own exhibits. He credibly responded to all questions
and  was  keenly  aware  of  the  significance  of  additional  alcohol-related  incidents  or
misconduct.
