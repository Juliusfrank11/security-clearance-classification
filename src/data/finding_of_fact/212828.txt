In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, she admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.l, 1.n, and 1.o, and
she denied SOR ¶ 1.m, all with explanations. Her admissions are accepted as findings of
fact. Additional findings follow.
Applicant is 28 years old. She has never married. She has two young children. She
graduated from high school in 2013. She attended college between 2013 and 2017 but
did  not  earn  a  degree.  She  held  a  variety  of  jobs  at  fast-food  restaurants  and  other
minimum-wage jobs ($7.25 to $8 an hour) both while in school and afterwards, from 2014
to 2020. She was assigned to work part time for a defense contractor in February 2020,
and  she  was  hired  by the  same  contractor as  a  full-time  employee  in  June  2020. She
works as a technician. (Tr. 26-29, 54-56; GE 1; AE D)
Applicant disclosed some debts on her SCA. (GE 1) The debts in the SOR total
about $37,700. They include federal student loans, medical debts, utilities, rent, and other
debts. The debts are established by credit reports in the record, from  March 2020 and
May 2022. (GE 2, GE 3) The record also includes credit reports from April 2022 (part of
GE 5) and October 2023 (GE 4)
Applicant used federal student loans to finance her college education. These loans
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.f, 1.h-1.j) total $32,399. She dropped out of college in 2017 to care for her
first child. She fell behind on repayments in the years that followed, a time when she was
working at fast-food restaurants in minimum- wage jobs. She also acknowledged that she
was immature and had no experience with money when she was younger and did not
understand “what I was getting into” financially. (GE 1; Tr. 31-32, 54-56)
Applicant’s  student  loans  were  listed  as  past  due  on  the  2020  and  2022  credit
reports. (GE 2, GE 3, GE 5) She acknowledged that she made no payments after she left
school in 2017. Her tax refunds were withheld for a period to address the debt, but she
said her refunds were also returned to her during the COVID-19 pandemic (when federal
student loans payments were deferred by Presidential Executive Order. (Tr. 32-33, 39)
An  October 2023  credit  report  shows the  loans  as being  in  “pays  as  agreed” status.
(GE 4) The  COVID-19  deferment program  ended  in October 2023, and  individuals are to
begin  repaying  their  federal student loans. On  October 23, 2023, Applicant applied  for the
U.S. Department  of  Education’s “Fresh  Start Initiative,” under which  her defaulted  student
loans   would   be   transferred   to   a   loan   servicer.  She   owes   about  $32,500   in   loans  and
interest. She expressed interest in “Income Driven Repayment.” No payment is currently
due  (as of October 2023). (AE  B) She  said she  has made  $50  payments  every two  weeks
since October 23, 2023. (AE  A  at 6; Tr. 30-32, 40-41)
SOR  ¶¶   1.g   ($2,498)  and   1.h   ($185)   are   past-due   medical   debts.   (GE  2,   GE   3)
They  occurred  due  to  pregnancy  complications requiring  an  ambulance  and  emergency
treatment. Applicant said she began paying these debts in October 2023. (Tr. 36-38, 41-
42)
SOR ¶ 1.l ($281) is a past-due cable debt. (GE 3 at 3) Applicant said she never
received a bill at the apartment complex where she lived at the time. (Answer) She called
the debt collector and was told that the account is closed. She is disputing the debt with
credit bureaus. (AE A; Tr. 33-34, 42-43)
SOR ¶ 1.m ($62) is a past-due energy bill from 2017. (GE 3 at 3) It is the only debt
Applicant denied in her SOR response, asserting that it has been paid. She is disputing
the debt with credit bureaus on that basis. (AE A; Tr. 33-36)
SOR ¶  1.n  ($1,194)  is a  past-due  rental debt  to  an  apartment  complex. (GE  3  at  3)
Applicant said  she  broke  her  lease  because  “no  one  ever came  to  fix anything.”  (Answer)
This was in 2017. (Tr. 27) This apartment had drainage problems and the  building was  a
safety hazard because  there  were  racoons living  in  the  stairwell. (Tr. 37) She has set up
a   payment  agreement,   with   $100   payments  every  two   weeks,   beginning   in   early
November 2023, with final payment in early April 2024. (AE C)
SOR ¶ 1.o ($1,150) is a consumer debt placed in collection by a bank. (GE 3 at 4)
Applicant said that this debt has been partially paid. (Answer) In late October 2023, she
called the debt collector and was told that the account is closed. She is disputing the debt
with credit bureaus. (AE A; Tr. 33-34. 43-44)
Applicant works full  time  and  earns $19.25  an  hour  ($770  a  week), an  increase
from  $15.80  an  hour in  mid-2022.  (GE  5  at 13-14)  She  estimated  that she  earns $1,300
every two  weeks. This is her sole  income. She  receives no  child  support. She  has lived
with   her  mother   since   2018.   She   pays  $300   in  rent   and   has  about  $2,130   in  monthly
expenses,  according   to   the   list  of  expenses   she   provided.  This  suggests  a   surplus  of
about $450  each  month. There is no evidence of tax issues or credit counseling. (Tr. 29-
30, 44-48;  AE F)
Applicant loves her job. She feels the hearing process has “helped me to put some
fire behind my feet” and get her finances organized. She wants to further her training at
work so she can receive better opportunities. She is well-regarded at work, and provided
awards and training certificates (Tr. 48-49, 57, AE D, AE E)
