Applicant is 57 years old, divorced from his third wife, and has one adult child and
one adult stepchild. He served in the United States Navy from 1992 to 2017, retiring as a
senior  chief  petty  officer  (E-8).  He  has  been  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  since

The SOR stated that Applicant had seven debts that were past due, charged-off,
or in collection, in the total amount of approximately $80,323. He also had one foreclosure
of a time share. The existence and amount of these debts is supported by his admissions
to three SOR allegations in his Answer and by credit reports dated April 14, 2022; August
22, 2022; and March 6, 2023. They are also confirmed by Applicant’s answers during an
interview with an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) that was
held on December 6, 2021. (Items 4, 5, 6, and 7.)
Applicant  stated  in  his  Answer, “The  condition  which  resulted  in  my  financial
hardship as alleged in the Statement of Reasons were [sic] largely beyond my control, as
it resulted from my separation and subsequent divorce. I have acted responsibly under
the circumstances and worked to ensure all outstanding financial problems are resolved.”
(Item 2 at 4.)
The current status of the debts is as follows:
1.a. Applicant denied owing $11,777 for a judgment to a creditor. He stated in his
Answer that he had paid the creditor $12,072 on November 14, 2022. No documentary
proof of this payment was provided by him. This debt appears on the April 14, 2022 (Item
5 at 4); and August 22, 2022 (Item 6 at 2-3) credit reports. The debt does not appear on
the most  recent  credit report in the  record, dated  March 6, 2023  (Item  7). As  set forth
below,  Applicant’s  statements  about  payments  to  other  creditors  are  supported  by
documentation. That fact provides support for his statement that he paid this debt as well.
Based on the state of the record, I find  by a preponderance of the evidence  Applicant
resolved this former debt.
1.b. Applicant admitted owing $16,566 for a delinquent credit card debt. He further
stated that he has been making $388 monthly payments towards this debt since October
2020. Support for this statement is found in the March 6, 2023 credit report. That report
shows a reduced balance for the debt and that the last payment was in March 2023. (Item
7 at 8.) This debt is being resolved by mutually agreed payments.
1.c.  Applicant  denied  owing  a  charged-off  debt  to  a  creditor  in  the  amount  of
$9,855.  The  latest  credit  report  in  the  record  states,  “Account  paid  for  less  than  full
balance, paid charge off.” (Item 7 at 12,) This debt has been resolved.
1.d. Applicant admitted  owing  a  creditor $21,068  for a  charged-off  account. In  his
Answer he  stated  that a  third  party now held the  account. He further stated, “At this time
I am  in current contact to  resolve this debt.”  No further information was provided. This
debt is not resolved.
1.e. Applicant denied owing $3,265 for a charged-off debt. He stated in his Answer
that he had reached a payment arrangement with this creditor and had paid the debt in
November 2022. The latest credit report in the record states, “Account paid for less than
full balance, paid charge off.” (Item 7 at 11,) This debt has been resolved.
1.f. Applicant denied owing $10,103 for a charged-off debt. He stated in his Answer
that he had reached a payment arrangement with this creditor and had paid  the debt in
November 2022. The latest credit report in the record states, “Account paid for less than
full balance, paid charge off.” (Item 7 at 11,) This debt has been resolved.
1.g. Applicant denied owing $7,689 for a charged-off debt. He stated in his Answer
that he had reached a payment arrangement with this creditor and had paid the debt in

full balance, paid charge off.” (Item 7 at 10,) This debt has been resolved.
1.h. Applicant admitted that he had a timeshare foreclosed on in 2022 for failure to
