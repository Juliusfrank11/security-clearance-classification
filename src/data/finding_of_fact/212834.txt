In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted all of the SOR allegations. (HE 3) He
also provided mitigating information. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  26-year-old  product  repair  technician  who  has  worked  for  a
government contractor for 14 months. (Tr. 6-7, 17-18) In 2016, he graduated from high

(Tr. 21)
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  Applicant  has  a  charged-off  debt  for  $4,300  and  SOR  ¶  1.c
alleges Applicant has an  account  placed for collection for $1,507.  In  2018,  Applicant’s
transmission on his vehicle needed to be replaced, and he borrowed the funds from two
creditors  to  pay  for  replacement  of  his  transmission.  (Tr.  23-24)  He  has  not  made
payments arrangements to address either of these debts. (Tr. 22). He may have made
one or two payments in 2018; however, he was unable to afford any other payments to
the two creditors. (Tr. 25-26) He planned to make payment arrangements.
SOR  ¶  1.b  alleges  Applicant  has  an  account  placed  for  collection  for  $20,306.
Applicant said the loans for his technical school were obtained through the Department
of  Education  (DoED).  (Tr.  27-28)  He  did  not  provide  documentation  showing  DoED
originated the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b. He received a six-month deferment after he completed
the courses in January 2019, and then he made two or three small payments. (Tr. 29) In
2020, he believed the account was in a COVID  19 deferment, and in 2021, he started
receiving notices from the collection agent. (Tr. 30) When he completed his September
28, 2022 SCA, he said for the SOR ¶ 1.b debt that he has “been making payment of my
debt and  collections to  the best  I  can.”  (GE 1)  During  his December 9,  2022 Office  of
Personnel  Management  personal  subject  interview,  he  said  he  intended  to  call  the
creditor “next week to set up a payment plan.” (GE 5 at 2) He did not attempt to arrange
a payment plan until recently. (Tr. 30) He said it was possible the SOR ¶ 1.b debt was not
a federal student loan. (Tr. 36)
On September 27, 2023, the SOR ¶ 1.b creditor offered Applicant a payment plan
with $100 monthly payments from September 28, 2023, to October 28, 2025; at that time
the balance will be $17,706; and a new payment arrangement can be made. (AE A) He
made the first $100 payment. (Tr. 30) He said the proposed $100 payments are affordable
to him. (Tr. 21)
Applicant’s June 26, 2023 credit bureau report shows six DoED student loans with
balances ranging from $2,132 to $5,637, and the status of each loan is “pays account as
agreed.” (GE 4)
Applicant did not receive financial counseling. (Tr. 32) He paid a credit-card debt
which totaled about $1,000. (Tr. 32) He paid off a debt related to a car for about $4,300.
(Tr.  33)  In  March  2022,  he  went  to  the  Dominican  Republic  on  vacation.  (Tr.  34)  His
fiancée’s parents paid for the trip. (Tr. 35)
