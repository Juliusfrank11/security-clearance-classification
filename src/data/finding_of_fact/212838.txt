Personal Conduct
Substance Misuse
SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b allege Applicant misused  cocaine and Percocet “most days
between at least approximately June 2016 and August 2016.” SOR ¶ 1.c alleges Applicant
“abused  Xanax  on  various  occasions  between  at  least  approximately  June  2016  and
August  2016.”  SOR  ¶  1.d  alleges  Applicant  “used  marijuana  on  various  occasions
between at least approximately June 2016 and August 2016.”
The  first tim
e Applicant  used  cocaine  was  in  1982  when he  was 20  years old. (Tr.
30) He  may have  used  marijuana  in  1982. (Tr. 32)  From  1982  to  2016, he  did  not use
cocaine. (Tr. 31) He was prescribed  Xanax in  the  early 1990s to  treat his anxiety. (Tr. 38)
In 1983, Applicant left college because he was consuming an excessive amount
of  alcohol  and  abusing  illegal  drugs.  (Tr.  51)  In  1983,  he  was  in  a  serious  motorcycle
accident while under the influence of alcohol. (Tr. 51) Over the next 20 years, he drank
alcohol to intoxication on some weekends. (Tr. 52) Around 2001, he attended Alcoholics
Anonymous (AA) meetings, and he stopped drinking alcohol for one year. (Tr. 53) In 2005,
he  was  getting  intoxicated  on  a  regular  basis,  and  he  attended  an  alcohol-treatment
program. (Tr. 54) In February 2006, he completed the program, and he intended to remain
sober. (Tr. 54) He was sober for about five months. (Tr. 55) He continued to attend AA
meetings, and he had periods of alcohol consumption and sobriety over the next several
years. (Tr. 55-59) In 2015, he moved to a different state from where his wife was living,
and his alcohol consumption increased. (Tr. 59)
From  June  to  August 2016, Applicant was living  apart from  his spouse, and  he  was
unemployed  because  he  quit  his  job  with  a  defense  contractor in  May 2016. (Tr. 26-27,
62) He  argued  with  his spouse  about  his  alcohol consumption, and  he  was  depressed.
(Tr. 26, 28) He met a  woman  at a  bar, and  he  had  an  affair  with  her. (Tr. 28-29) She  also
provided  illegal drugs to  him. (Tr. 29-31) He did  not specifically remember using  marijuana
with  her. (Tr. 32; HE 3  at 2)  He denied  that he  used  marijuana, cocaine, or Percocet after
2016. (Tr. 33)
From September to November 2016, Applicant attended an  intensive  outpatient
substance abuse (IOSA) program. (Tr. 33-34) He primarily attended the IOSA program
for alcohol treatment. (Tr. 34) In his initial IOSA diagnostic assessment on September 8,
2016, he disclosed: cocaine use most days for eight weeks with last use August 23, 2016;
Percocet use “5-6 [pills]” most days for eight weeks with last use August 23, 2016; and
Xanax use “2-3 5 mg [pills] twice a week for eight weeks with last use August 23, 2016.
(GE 4 at 3) Applicant took Xanax for two or three years; however, he did not use Xanax
in 2016. (Tr. 39) He believed his IOSA program medical records incorrectly indicated he
used Xanax in 2016. (Tr. 29, 63; GE 4 at 3)
Applicant attended IOSA treatment three days a week, and on November 3, 2016,
he successfully completed the IOSA program. (Tr. 34-36; AE A) He was honest about his
substance  abuse  at  the  IOSA  program.  (Tr.  35)  He  has  had  some  relapses  when  he
consumed alcohol after completion of the IOSA program. (Tr. 36) He frequently attends
AA meetings. (Tr. 36) When he responded to DOHA interrogatories on March 23, 2023,
he  said  he  most  recently  consumed  alcohol  in  July  2021,  when  he  drank  about  eight
beers. (GE 2 at 25) At his hearing, he said he most recently consumed alcohol in July
2022, and on that occasion, he drank to intoxication. (Tr. 37, 71; GE 2) He did not explain
the discrepancy about his most recent alcohol consumption at his hearing.
SOR  ¶  1.e  alleges  in  about  September  2016,  Applicant  was  diagnosed  with
Alcohol  Use  Disorder,  Severe;  Stimulant  Use  Disorder,  Cocaine  Type,  Severe;  Opioid
Use Disorder, Severe; and Anxiolytic Use Disorder, Mild. He agreed with the accuracy of
the diagnosis alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e. (Tr. 42; GE 4 at 8)
On May 16, 2023, Applicant provided a PSC specimen, which tested negative for
alcohol evidence of moderate to heavy ethanol consumption. (AE B) On May 23, 2023,
Applicant provided a hair sample, which tested negative for use of any illegal substances.
(AE A)
On  July 22, 2022, Dr. D, a  licensed  psychologist, evaluated  Applicant  at the  behest
of the  DOD CAF. (GE  3) Applicant told  Dr. D about his use  of cocaine, marijuana,  and
oxycodone   (Percocet) in  2016.  (Id. at  4) He told  Dr.  D  that  he   had   not  consumed  any
alcohol in the  previous 12  months. (Id.) Dr. D’s report concluded  that  Applicant “does not
present   with   a   condition   at   this   time   that   could  pose   a   significant   risk  to   his  judgment,
reliability, or trustworthiness concerning  his  ability to  handle  classified  information.” (Id. at
6)  He “meets the  criteria  for Alcohol Use  Disorder, moderate, in self-reported  remission
over  12   months.  .  .  .   His  use   has  apparently  not  caused   any  legal  or  occupational
problems.” (Id.)
Dr.  D  diagnosed  Applicant  as  follows:  Polysubstance  Use  Disorder  (cocaine,
marijuana, and prescription pain medications), mild, in self-reported remission for 6 years;
Dysthymia,  in  self-reported  remission/controlled  with  medication;  and  Generalized
Anxiety  Disorder,  in  self-reported  remission/controlled  with  medication.  (Id.)  Dr.  D
concluded  his  “mental  health  condition  appears  to  be  well  controlled  with  his  current
medications  and  participation  in  Alcoholics  Anonymous  meetings.  For  these  reasons,
[Applicant’s] risk for problems with judgment and reliability appear to be LOW at this time.”
(Id.)
On May 3, 2023, Dr. L, a licensed psychologist, evaluated Applicant at Applicant’s
behest.  (SOR  response,  AE  C) Dr.  L  concluded:  (1) Applicant  has a  serious  drug  and
alcohol history; however, his substance use disorders are in remission; (2) his provision
of false information during the security clearance process occurred “because he panicked
and feared he would lose his job (i.e., a lie motivated by anxiety rather than a lie motivated
by any malice or by shame that could be used to blackmail him)”; (3) the likelihood of him
being  dishonest  in  the  future  is  relatively  low;  (4)  he  is  remorseful  about  his  prior
substance abuse; (5) he seems motivated to do better and “his prognosis is fair to quite
possibly good”; and (6) he “does not present with evidence  of behavioral or personality
patterns,  or  mental  health  conditions  that  could  reasonably  degrade  his  reliability,
trustworthiness, or judgment.” (Tr. 43; AE C at 7)
Provision of False Information during the  Security  Clearance  Process
SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.g allege Applicant answered, “No,” to two questions on his April
23,  2020  SCA:  (1)  “In  the  last  seven  (7)  years  have  you  illegally  used  any  drugs  or
controlled  substance?”;  and  (2)  “In  the  last  seven  (7)  years,  have  you  intentionally
engaged  in  the  misuse  of  prescription  drugs,  regardless  of  whether  the  drugs  were
prescribed  for you  or someone  else?” He  deliberately failed  to  disclose  the  information
set forth in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.d, supra.
In his SOR response, Applicant said he failed to accurately report his illegal drug
use on his SCA. (HE 3 at 3) He said he has learned from his mistakes. (Id.) He said:
During  my subject  matter interview in 2020,  I inadvertently misrepresented
the   number  of  times  I  illegally  used   cocaine   [and   Percocet],  as  I  had
forgotten  the  exact  details due  to  the  passage  of time  since  2016.  I  could
not  recall  the  exact  number  of  times  that  I used  cocaine  [and  Percocet]  or
how much  I used. It  was never my intent to  falsify or conceal information
during the investigative process. (HE  3 at 1-2)
Applicant said he has learned from his mistakes. (HE 3 at 3) At his hearing, he
admitted  he  failed  to  disclose  accurate  information  on  his  SCA,  and  he  said  he  was
“extremely ashamed,” and he panicked. (Tr. 44) He knew it was wrong when he submitted
the false denial of use of illegal drugs. (Tr. 44, 64)
SOR ¶ 1.h alleges Applicant  denied, during his March 19, 2021 interview by an
authorized investigator for the DOD, that he used any illegal drugs other than cocaine or
misused any prescription drugs other than Percocet during the July 2016 to August 2016
timeframe. He deliberated failed to disclose the information set forth in SOR ¶ 1.c and
1.d, supra.
On June 5, 2020, an authorized investigator for the DOD interviewed Applicant,
and he did not disclose his use of cocaine and use of any controlled substances without
a  prescription  in  2016.  (Tr.  64;  GE  2  at  4-7)  The  investigative  summary  states,  “[a]ll
relevant  adjudicative  criteria  were  discussed  with  Subject.  The  interview  disclosed  no
additional  information.”  (GE  2  at  7)  He  said  he  “was  ashamed  and  scared  to  tell”  the
investigator about his use of cocaine and Percocet without a prescription. (Tr.  64) The
allegation  that  he  failed  to  disclose  his  cocaine  use  and  Percocet  use  without  a
prescription is not alleged in the SOR.
On March 19, 2021, an authorized investigator for the DOD interviewed Applicant,
and he disclosed that he used cocaine and Percocet without a prescription. (Tr. 45-46,
65.) The OPM investigator said if his use of illegal drugs was 10 times or less, it would be
considered experimental, and Applicant agreed with this suggestion and said it was 10
times.  (Tr.  45,  66)  The  investigative  summary  states  that  Applicant  said,  “he  used
[cocaine] about ten times over a two to three week period.” (GE 2 at 8) He said he used
“two  or three  Percocet  pills per day over the  same  two  or three  week period.” (Id.) He
disclosed his Xanax use in the 1990s to the investigator. (Tr. 47; GE 2 at 8) He said he
ended his Xanax use in 1995. (Id.)
Applicant did not disclose his marijuana use in 2016 to the investigator. He did not
disclose the marijuana use because “it was so trivial” in comparison to his cocaine use.
(Tr. 65)  He did not know how many times he  used cocaine and Percocet in the eight-
week period of June to August 2016. (Tr. 47-49, 66-68)
SOR ¶¶ 1.i and 1.j allege Applicant said in response to DOHA interrogatories on
March 23, 2023, that he only used cocaine on one or two occasions in 1982 and 10 times
or less between June and July 2016, and he denied  that he had ever been diagnosed
with any condition or disorder related to drugs. He failed to disclose the information in
SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.e, supra.
In  his SOR response, Applicant said he  failed  to  accurately report his cocaine  use
and  past diagnosis during  his  response  to  DOHA  interrogatories. (HE 3  at  4) He  said  he
did not have  access to  his medical records.  (Id.)  In  his answers to  DOHA  interrogatories,
he  said  he used  cocaine  10  times or less in  the  end of June and  beginning  of July 2016.
(GE  2  at  23) At   his hearing,  he  denied   that  he   remembered  how many   times  he   used
cocaine. (Tr. 67)  In  his response  to  DOHA interrogatories, he  said he  used  Percocet on
most  days during  the  same  period  in  2016.  (GE  2  at 23) At  his hearing, he  said  he  did  not
use   Percocet  more  frequently  than   he   used   cocaine.  (Tr.  72-73)  When   he   told   the
investigator and  responded  to  DOHA  interrogatories  and  said  he  used  cocaine  10  times
or less,  he  knew that was not  the  truth. (Tr. 74) He made  the  claim  that he  used  cocaine
10  times  or less because  he  wanted  to  be  labeled  as an  experimental cocaine  user.  (Tr.
74) When  he  used  cocaine, sometimes he  would snort six lines  or more of cocaine  on  a
single occasion. (Tr. 75)
When  he  was  using  cocaine  in  2016,  he  did  not  have  access  to  classified
information. (Tr. 77) He held a sensitive position when he was working for the contractor;
however, in 2016, when he was using cocaine, he was unemployed. (Tr. 78)
As to the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.j that he failed to disclose his substance-related
diagnosis  in  his  March  23,  2023  response  to  DOHA  interrogatories,  Applicant  was
unaware of his substance abuse diagnosis set forth in SOR ¶ 1.e until he reviewed his
medical records in April 2023. (Tr. 41-42)
Character Evidence
The  general  sense  of  the  statements  of  five  coworkers  is  that  they  believe
Applicant  is  honest,  trustworthy,  reliable,  and  professional.  (AE  F)  His  performance
reviews for April 2017 to August 2020 indicate he is a highly effective employee who made
contributions to  his employer’s mission  accomplishment.  (GE 2  at 48-56) His employer
awarded a certificate of recognition to Applicant for five years of service and commitment.
(GE 2 at 59)
