Applicant  admitted  to  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a.  through  1.c.,  with
explanations. At the hearing, Department Counsel amended the SOR adding allegation
¶ 1.d, which reads as follows:
falsified   material
facts   on   an   Electronic   Questionnaire
You
for
Investigations  Processing  (e-QIP), executed  by you  on  or about August  4,
2022, in response  to  Section  23, Illegal Use  of Drugs or Drug  Activity. In
the   last  seven   (7)   years,  have   you   illegally  used   any   drugs  or  controlled
substances,  use   of  a   drug   or  controlled   substance,  including   injecting,
snorting,  inhaling, swallowing, experimenting  with  or  otherwise consuming
any  drug   or   controlled   substance?   You   answered   “No”   and,   thereby,
deliberately failed   to   disclose   that   you,   in   fact,   used  marijuana   in   June   of
2022. (TR at page 39 line 3 to  page 41 line 13.)
Applicant  neither  admitted  or  denied  this  additional  allegation;  and  as  such,  I
consider  it  denied.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and
testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 22-year-old employee of a
defense  contractor.  He  has  been  employed  with  the  defense  contractor  since  July  of
2022. Applicant has a high school diploma. He is unmarried, and has no children. (GX 1
at pages 5, 8~9, 10 and 17.)
Guideline E  - Personal Conduct
1.a.  In  about  February  2022,  Applicant  was  terminated  from  his  previous
employment  for  employee  theft  of  merchandise.  He  admits  he  was  terminated,  but
avers he felt pressure to sign a statement of guilt because he knew of the theft by his
fellow employees. Applicant claims that this was only guilt by association. (TR at page
18 line 9 to page 25 line 21.) This claim is not believable.
1.b.  Applicant  admits  that  he  used  marijuana  on  “one  occasion”  in  June  2022.
(TR at page 33 line 13 to page 35 line 6.)
1.c. Applicant answered “No,” in his response to Interrogatories dated March 25,
2023,  as  to  past  marijuana  use.  (GX  2  at  page  7.)  As  Applicant  already  admitted  this
one-time usage during an Enhanced Subject Interview in October 2022 (GX 2 at page
4), he “thought the question referred to EVER using a substance other then [sic] the one
time  admitted  use.”  (TR  at  page  28  line  24  to  page  37  line  19,  and  Answer.)  This
allegation is found for Applicant.
1.d.  Applicant answered “No” to Section 23 on his August 2022 e-QIP as to past
illegal use of drugs  in the  last  seven  years.  (GX  1 at  page  24.)  As he  used  marijuana
two  months  earlier  in  June  2022,  noted  above,  this  was  willful  falsification.  This
allegation is found against Applicant.
