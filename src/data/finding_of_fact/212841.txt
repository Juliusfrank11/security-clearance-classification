Applicant  admitted  both  allegations  without  explanation.  His  admissions  are
incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings
and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 35 years old. After serving honorably in the U.S. Navy from November
2008 until August 2014, he was hired by a federal contractor immediately after leaving
active duty. He worked for four years in state C before moving in 2018 to state Z to take
his current position. He earned his high school diploma in June 2008. He married in May
2008 and has two school-age children. (Item 5 at 10-16,19, 22.)
The SOR alleges two delinquent debts totaling $33,912. The debts are reflected in
two credit reports, from January 2023 (Item 7 at 2) and July 2021 (Item 8 at 4-5).
SOR ¶ 1.a: car loan charged off in the amount of $18,147. Applicant admits the
debt. He states he could not afford the car on a single income. The loan amount was for
$46,883. (Item 7 at 2.) He turned over the vehicle after about 18 months when he could
not  afford  to  make  the  payments.  He  was  not  aware  of  the  outstanding  balance  until
confronted during his December 2021 security clearance interview. (Item 7 at 2; Item 8 at
4; Item 9 at 2-3.)
SOR  ¶ 1.b: A  timeshare  account that  is past due in  the approximate  amount of
$1,981,  which  is  in  foreclosure  status  with  a  total  loan  balance  of  $15,765.  Applicant
admits  the  debt.  He  was  not  aware  of  its  status  until  confronted  during  his  security
clearance interview. (Item 9 at 2-3.) He told the investigator that he and his wife signed a
timeshare contract while on vacation. He sought to terminate the contract after returning
from the vacation and was told he was not allowed to cancel the contract. He elected to
not make any payments. (Item 9 at 2-3.) Both credit reports show the account opened in
March 2018 and reported delinquent in April 2019. (Item 7 at 2; Item 8 at 5.)
In  response  to  government  interrogatories,  in  the  personal  financial  statement
portion, Applicant did not list any details concerning his monthly income and provided one
item in his monthly expenses (utilities). He did list four debts and their monthly payments,
which total $2,450. (Item 6 at 6.) During his security clearance interview he did offer that
he would contact the creditors to work out a payment plan. (Item 9.)
