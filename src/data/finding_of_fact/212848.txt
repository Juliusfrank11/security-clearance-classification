Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a through 1.h. After a thorough and
careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of
fact.
Applicant is 33 years old. He served in the military from 2008 until his honorable
discharge in 2015 in the rank of E-5. He married in 2014 and divorced in 2016. He has
no  children.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2019.  He  has  worked  for  his  present
employer, a federal contractor, since June 2022.
Applicant disclosed in his August 2022 security clearance application (SCA) that
he  experienced  periods  of  unemployment  from  May  2017  to  September  2017,  March
2018  to  May  2019,  and  December  2019  until  October  2020.  The  later  due  to  the
pandemic. (Item 2)
The SOR alleges eight delinquent debts. Most appear to be credit card debts. The
total delinquent amount alleged is approximately $45,208. The debts are corroborated by
Applicant’s admissions in his answer, SCA,  interrogatories,  statement  to  a  government
investigator, and credit reports from September 2022 and August 2023. (Items 1-6)
In  his  SCA,  Applicant  disclosed  the  credit  card  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a
($5,460), 1.b ($5,390), 1.c ($1,684), 1.h ($2,633) and presumably 1.g (he disclosed the
amount owed was $11,000, the current balance appears to be $13,839, as alleged). For
the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a he said he spoke with the bank, and he planned to make
monthly payments on the debt. He stated in his SCA that he was having money issues at
the time and could not make the payments on the debts. He said he was living beyond
his means, never learned about proper budgeting when he was growing up, and when he
joined the military, he went crazy with his spending. He said he made most of his mistakes
as  a  young  military  member.  He  said  in  the  SCA  that  he  had  not  taken  action  on  the
accounts,  and  they  were  canceled  by  the  creditors.  He  planned  on  looking  into  credit
counseling services that could help him. (Item 2)
Applicant  was  interviewed   by  a   government   investigator  in   November  2022.   He
acknowledged   his   delinquent  debts  and   attributed   them   to   his   being   unknowledgeable
about finances, credit,  and money in  general. He  also lived  beyond  his means and over-
extended  himself with  credit cards. He allowed  his financial delinquencies to  linger and
eventually  go   to   collections.   He   told   the   investigator  that   he   had   contacted   all   of   the
creditors but  was not  in  a  position  to  make  payments towards  his debts. Once  his financial

Applicant responded to government interrogatories in April 2023. He was asked to
provide  information  on  each  of  the  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.h.  He
responded that none of the debts were paid. He had not made payment arrangements
with any of the creditors and was not making any payments on any of the debts. He said
the cause of his financial problems was because of his divorce and discharge from the
military, which left in a bad financial situation. He said he planned on making things right
and paying off his outstanding accounts. As part of his interrogatories, Applicant provided
a  personal  financial  statement,  which  reported  he  is  timely  paying  five  debts.  None  of
them are those alleged in the SOR. (Item 3)
In  Applicant’s answer to  the  SOR, he  admitted  all  of the  debts alleged. He said he
took  full  responsibility for the  debts  and  intended  to  make  things  right and  pay  what  he
owed in “due time.” He said he  had  made a payment arrangement for the  debt alleged in
SOR  ¶   1.d   ($723).  He   provided   a   document   showing   that  he   authorized   an   electronic
payment   of   $12.95   a   month   beginning   in  December  2022   and   continuing   through
November 2024.  He  did  not  provide  additional documents  to  show  he  is  in compliance
with   the   agreement.   He   also  stated   he   hoped   to   fix  his  credit  issues.  No   additional
information  or documents were  provided. (Item 1)
