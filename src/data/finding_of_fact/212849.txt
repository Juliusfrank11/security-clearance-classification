Applicant  is  a  63-year-old  administrative  specialist  employed  by  a  defense
contractor since October 2021. She has been employed by various federal contractors
since November 2009. She has three adult children. She was cleared for a public trust
position in May 2016.
Applicant immigrated to the United States in April 1979, when she was 18 years
old, unmarried, and had two daughters. She became a U.S. citizen in May 1993, attended
a trade school, earned an associate degree from a community college in 1991, and was
employed  in  the  private  sector  until  she  began  working  for  federal  contractors.  An  Air
Force major general for whom Applicant worked from January 2021 through June 2023
submitted a letter attesting to Applicant’s competence and trustworthiness in her handling
of the records of sensitive investigations. (AX F)
Applicant’s two daughters both became U.S. citizens and graduated from college.
The  older  daughter  is  a  senior  project  manager  for  a  major  U.S.  corporation,  and  the
younger  daughter  is  a  senior  employee  of  a  DOD  agency  and  has  held  a  security
clearance since 2001. The younger daughter submitted a letter attesting to her mother’s
intelligence, trustworthiness, and motivation. (AX G)
The SOR alleges a single delinquent debt to a credit union that was charged off
for $34,606. The debt was a consolidation loan and is reflected in credit reports from June
2022 and December 2023. Applicant obtained the loan in July 2018, and her last payment
on the loan was in December 2018. (GX 2 and 3) In her answer to the SOR, Applicant
denied the allegation, because she believed that she owed a lesser amount. (Tr. 32)
Applicant testified that she leased an automobile in 2018. Shortly thereafter, she
realized that she was paying more on her debts than she was earning.  When she was
interviewed by a security investigator, she attributed her delinquent debts to overspending
for  furniture  and  preparing  to  move  to  a  new  residence.  She  hired  a  debt-resolution
company in 2017 or 2018 that resolved some of her delinquent debts. Her credit report
from June 2022 reflected four delinquent debts (three credit card debts and one debt to
the credit union alleged in the SOR) that were settled for less than the full balance. (GX
2  at  3-4)  She  testified  that  she  fired  the  debt-resolution  company  because  it  was  not
paying  all  her  creditors.  The  company  explained  to  her  that  it  could  not  pay  all  her
creditors because she had insufficient funds in her account with them to resolve all her
debts. (Tr. 55)
Applicant testified that she contacted the creditor alleged in the SOR several times,
beginning  in  2019,  but  received  no  response.  After  she  was  interviewed  by  a  security
investigator  several  times  in  June,  July,  August,  and  September  2022,  she  sent  the
creditor a letter in May 2023. She did not have a copy of the letter. (Tr. 44)
On  November  20,  2023,  Applicant  wrote  another  letter  to  the  credit  union
proposing a payment plan with the following conditions: (1) reduce the amount of the debt
to $20,000; (2) deduct payments automatically from her checking account for 60 months,
without any interest added, beginning in January 2024; (3) assess no penalty for an early
payoff; and (4) notify credit bureaus that the debt is being resolved. (AX B) As of the date
of the hearing, she had not received a response from the credit union.
In  Applicant’s  post-hearing  submission,  she  explained  she  contacted  the  credit
union  again  and  learned  that  the  credit  union  could  not  respond  to  her  letters  and
telephone calls because the credit-repair company was listed as her representative, and
a  “cease  and  desist  notification”  precluded  the  credit  union  from  contacting  her.  She
notified  the  credit  union  that  the  debt-resolution  company  was  no  longer  her
representative. (AX I and J) She stated that she had negotiated an agreement with the
credit union to pay $380 per month by automatic deduction from her checking account,
beginning  on  January  17,  2024.  She  did  not  submit  documentary  evidence  of  the
agreement, but she submitted evidence that she made a $200 payment to the credit union
on December 21, 2023. (AX H; AX K)
Applicant’s long-time friend and companion testified on her behalf. He testified that
he and Applicant travel together and exchange gifts. The last trip he could remember was
in 2018 (Tr. 69). He also testified that he was a cosigner on a  debt-consolidation loan
from  the  creditor  alleged  in  the  SOR,  and  that  monthly  payments  of  about  $550  were
deducted from his bank account from 2019 until this year. (Tr. 72) It was unclear which
bank accounts he cosigned, because the December 2023 credit report reflects three debt-
consolidation loans from the same creditor, as well as two joint credit-card accounts. (GX
3 at 7, 11, 13, 14)
Applicant currently earns $49,000 per year. (Tr. 27) At the hearing, she estimated
that she had about $1,000 in her checking account and about $15,000 in her retirement
account. (Tr. 47-48) She bought her personal vehicle in 2018 car and owes about $9,000
on the car loan. (Tr. 47-49) She and her children went on a seven-day cruise to celebrate
her birthday in November 2023. She and her daughter paid about $1,200 each for the
cruise. (Tr. 50-51) She has not sought or received any financial counseling. (Tr. 51)
