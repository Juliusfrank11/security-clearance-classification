Financial Considerations
The SOR alleges five delinquent debts, and the record establishes the status of
Applicant’s accounts as follows:
SOR  ¶   1.a  alleges  a  credit  card  debt placed for collection  for  $4,998.  Applicant
believes this account became delinquent in 2016. Since it became delinquent, he has not
made  any  payments  or  communicated  with  the  creditor  about  this  debt.  In  2018,  he
contacted a bankruptcy attorney to assist him with his outstanding financial obligations.
Applicant made payments to the attorney for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing fee.  In May
2023, Applicant informed the attorney’s secretary that he may want to pursue a Chapter
13 bankruptcy instead. Since that time, he has had no further communications with the
attorney. After the hearing, Applicant sent an email stating he had contacted the attorney
again  and  discovered the  law  office  was  permanently  closed.  Applicant  will  attempt  to
resolve his delinquent debts with another bankruptcy attorney. This debt is unresolved.
(Tr. 24-25; AE A; GE 3)
SOR  ¶   1.b alleges  a  credit  card  debt placed for collection  for $4,672.  Applicant
believes this account became delinquent in 2016. Since it became delinquent, he has not
made any payments or communicated with the creditor about this debt. He included this
debt  in  his 2018  communications with  a  bankruptcy  attorney,  who, as stated  above,  is  no
longer in business. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 25-26; AE  A; GE 3)
SOR  ¶   1.c   alleges  a  credit  card  debt  placed  for  collection  for  $4,435.  Applicant
believes this account became delinquent in 2016. Since it became delinquent, he has not
made any payments or communicated with the creditor about this debt. He included this
debt  in  his  2018  communications  with  the  bankruptcy  attorney  who  is  no  longer  in
business. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 26; AE A; GE 3)
SOR  ¶   1.d alleges  a  credit  card  debt placed for collection  for $3,972.  Applicant
believes this account became delinquent in 2016. Since it became delinquent, he has not
made any payments or communicated with the creditor about this debt. He included this
debt in his 2018 communications with the aforementioned bankruptcy attorney. This debt
is unresolved. (Tr. 26-27; AE A; GE 3)
SOR  ¶   1.e  alleges  a  credit  card  debt placed for collection  for  $2,859.  Applicant
believes this account became delinquent in 2016. Since it became delinquent, he has not
made any payments or communicated with the creditor about this debt. He included this
debt in his 2018 communications with the bankruptcy attorney. This debt is unresolved.
(Tr. 26-27; AE A; GE 3)
Applicant stated he had contacted the bankruptcy attorney in  2018 because his
wife had lost her job in 2015, she attempted suicide, and in addition to the mounting credit
card debts, they accumulated a lot of medical bills for her treatment. He could not keep
up with the mounting debt. The filing fee for the Chapter 7 bankruptcy was $1,700, and
Applicant  made payments  to  the  attorney  whenever he  was  able. The  plan  was  to file
bankruptcy  in  2021,  but  due  to  COVID-19  everything  was  placed  on  hold.  Applicant
emailed the attorney a couple times and left some voice mail messages over the years,
but he never heard back from him. In May 2023, the attorney’s secretary  called stating
that the attorney needed to know what Applicant wanted to do. Applicant told the secretary
that he would like to look at other options because his financial situation had improved.
He also told the secretary he was going to pay off some of  his debts and that he may
prefer  filing  a  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  instead.  The  secretary  told  Applicant  they  would
work  on  a  plan  and  be  in  touch  with  him  soon.  Applicant  has  not  had  any  further
communications with the attorney or legal secretary since May 2023. (Tr. 27-38)
Applicant  admitted  that  during  the  last  two  years  he  had  accumulated
approximately $6,000 in credit card debt, but he emphasized that the accounts were not
delinquent. He stated that he would not include this recent accumulation of credit card
debt in his anticipated bankruptcy filing. He has never participated in a consumer financial
counseling program. (Tr. 36-37, 40)
Applicant  responded  to  a  financial  interrogatory  in  March  2023.  He  provided  a
personal financial statement (PFS) which showed his monthly net income, to include his
VA  disability  pay,  was  $4,385.  After  deducting  his  monthly  expenses  and  financial
obligations,  he  was  left  with  a  monthly  remainder  of  $878.  There  were  no  payments
arranged  for his delinquent debts.  There is no  evidence  that Applicant  is taking action  to
resolve the five delinquent accounts listed in the SOR.  (GE 3)
