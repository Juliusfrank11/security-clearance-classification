In  Applicant’s  response  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  all  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a
through 1.e. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 34-year-old full-time employee of a defense contractor. He received
his high school diploma in May 2008, and subsequently attended community college for
about a year before leaving without graduating. He has never been married and does not
have children. (GE 1; Tr. 21-30)
Applicant  was  initially  hired  in  September  2022  as  a  full-time  pipefitter  earning
$19.75 per hour. He was released from the position in about February 2023 after he was
not initially granted a security clearance. After about three months of unemployment, he
testified he was re-hired by the same defense contractor in May 2023, and currently works
as a full-time sheet metal fabricator earning $21.23 per hour. (GE 1; Tr. 19-21, 26-29)
Applicant  previously  worked  as  a  truck  driver  for  three  different  non-defense
employers  from  about  June  2016  to  about  September  2022.  He  testified  his  annual
earnings for work as a truck driver in 2016 ranged between $40,000 and $45,000. From
2017 until he left his last job as a truck driver in September 2022, he testified he earned
between  $52,000  and  $53,000.  He  testified  his  delivery  work  slowed  down  during  the
COVID-19 pandemic, which negatively impacted his pay.  He was paid based on the load
and deliveries, and with few deliveries he was paid less. As a result, he fell behind on
some bills. (Tr.  27-29, 49-51)
Applicant  gets  paid  weekly  and  his current net  or take-home  pay is  about  $628
each week. (Tr. at 55) He participates in his employer’s 401(k) plan and saves a portion
of his earnings each month. He has two savings accounts, one with a balance of about
$1,800.  He  also  minimized  his  living  expenses  by  moving  out  of  his  independent
apartment  to  live  with  his  sister.  He  pays  her  about  $400  per  month  for  rent,  which
includes  all  utilities.  He  has  not  taken  on  any  new  debts.  He  owns  an  older  car,
manufactured in 2001, and a 2011 motorcycle both without debt. He testified he used his
profit of about $25,000 from the sale of his home in June 2023 to pay off his delinquent
debts. (Tr. at 64) He has not received formal counseling, but he maintains a budget, which
he plans to revise to reflect his current pay level. (Tr. at 59) He testified he is able to meet
his financial obligations though for some months he has less money remaining over. (Tr.
55-60)
During the hearing, Applicant disclosed he has not yet filed his 2022 federal and
state income tax returns because he is missing a W2 from his previous employer. He is
seeking  a  tax  professional  to  help  him  navigate  this  issue.  He  intends  to  file  his  2023
income tax returns on time. (Tr. 61-64) Delinquent or unfiled income tax returns were not
alleged in the SOR.
The SOR alleged five financial concerns (SOR ¶¶ 1.a - 1.e) totaling about $29,900
in delinquent debts. The evidence regarding the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized
below.
SOR ¶  1.a  ($10,207): Applicant admitted  this  delinquent  consumer debt  for a  car
he  purchased  for  himself, a  2017  Ford. He  fell  behind  on  payments  during  the  COVID-19
pandemic  because  of cut-backs in truck deliveries and  cargo  loads. His pay as a  truck
driver largely depended  upon  the  weight and  number of deliveries to  factories  and  plants.
During   the   pandemic,   numerous  factories  and   plants  closed   down,  which  “drastically
reduced”  the  number  of deliveries and  loads he  was able  to make.  He testified  his hours
were  reduced  significantly  at times. For this debt he  testified  he  was about four payments
behind, and  the  creditor was unwilling  to  work with  him. (GE 2   at 1-2)  In  June  2023, he
paid off  this  debt  with  proceeds from  the  sale of his  home. (GE  3  at 2;  AE  C;  Tr.  27,  49-
51)  This debt is resolved.
SOR ¶  1.b  ($6,541):  Applicant  admitted  this delinquent  consumer debt. He  testified
this was one  of  two  car  loans  he  cosigned  for a  long-time  friend  who  needed  help getting
started   after  leaving   the   military.   This  car  was  a   sports  car,  and   unsuitable  for  use   in
inclement  winter  weather. His friend  wrecked this car and it  was deemed  a total loss.  His
friend  ultimately lost  his job, and  was unable  to  pay. Applicant paid  off  this  debt in June
2023  with  proceeds from  the  sale  of his home. (GE 3  at 3; GE  4  at  4; AE  B; and  Tr.  34-
36, 50-51)  This debt is resolved.
SOR ¶  1.c  ($2,823):  Applicant admitted  this delinquent consumer debt. He testified
this loan  was a  smaller consolidation  loan  to  pay off  smaller debts when  he  was younger.
He fell  behind  on  payments in  2020  during  the  COVID-19 pandemic due  to  reduced  pay
as discussed  above. He paid  off  this debt  in  June  2023  with  proceeds from  the  sale  of his
home. (GE  3  at 3; GE  4 at 5; and  Tr.  45-49)  This debt is resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.d  ($2,019): Applicant admitted this delinquent consumer debt. He testified
he incurred this debt for the purchase of a refrigerator and stove for his first new home.
He testified he set up automatic payments for this bill, but believed the credit card he used
expired,  and  automatic  payments  stopped.  He  did  not  remember  to  reset  automatic
payments, which would have been in the 2020 timeframe during the COVID-19 pandemic.
(Tr. at 41) He experienced financial problems for many of his bills due to reduction in work
assignments and pay as discussed above. He addressed this debt when he learned about
its  existence  during  his  interview  with  investigators  in  October  2022.  He  stated  he
contacted  the  creditor  immediately  after  the  interview  and  begin  working  on  payment
arrangements. He ultimately paid off this delinquent debt in June 2023 with proceeds from
the sale of his home. (GE 3 at 3; AE A; Tr. 40-42) This debt is resolved.
SOR ¶  1.e  ($8,347):  Applicant admitted this delinquent consumer debt. He testified
this was the second car loan he cosigned for a long-time friend who needed help getting
started after leaving the military, discussed in SOR ¶ 1.b above. This car was a four-wheel
drive car suitable for winter. He testified he learned his friend lost his job and defaulted
on  the  loan.  Applicant  has  not  communicated  with  his  friend  and  stated  he  learned  a
valuable lesson and will not take this kind of risk again to help a friend. In June 2023, he
made  a  $1,000  lump-sum  payment  towards  this  delinquent  debt  with  the  remaining
proceeds  from  the  sale  of  his  home.  He  is  communicating  with  the  creditor,  and  he
credibly testified concerning his commitment to paying off this debt. (GE 3 at 4; GE 4 at
3; Tr. 43-44, 50) This debt is being resolved.
