The SOR alleges that Applicant used marijuana in November 2020 (SOR ¶ 2.a),
that he falsified his SCA by failing to disclose his marijuana use (SOR ¶ 1.a), and that he
failed to disclose his marijuana use during an interview with a security investigator in May
2021 (SOR ¶ 1.b). In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR
¶¶ 1.a and 1.b but denied intentional falsification. His explanation of his conduct alleged
in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b amounts to a denial. His admission of the marijuana use alleged
in SOR ¶ 2.a is incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 30-year-old security administrator employed by a defense contractor
since February 2021. He served on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps from June 2011
to February 2015 and received an honorable discharge. He served in the inactive ready
reserve  from  February  2015  to  June  2018  and  received  an  honorable  discharge.  He
received a bachelor’s degree in May 2020. He is unmarried and has no children. His SCA
reflects that he received a security clearance in September 2012, while he was on active
duty  in  the  Marine  Corps,  and  again  in  November  2020,  while  employed  by  a  federal
contractor.
Applicant consumed two marijuana edibles in November 2020 after his roommate
suggested using them as a sleep aid. He was unhappy with his job and was considering
looking for non-federal employment. He submitted applications for several jobs, but his
applications  were  not  accepted  because  of  COVID.  He  was  stressed  about  finding
suitable employment and unable to sleep. He had tried melatonin without success. His
roommate suggested marijuana edibles and gave him two of them that were purchased
from a legal dispensary. They did not work, and he experienced a panic attack after taking
the second edible.
Applicant  changed  his  mind  about  leaving  federal  employment  when  he  was
offered a job by his current employer. He submitted an SCA in March 2021, but he did
not disclose his marijuana use. (FORM Item 3)
Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in May 2021. The summary of
the May 2021 interview reflects that he was questioned about his college education, his
previous  employments,  his  military  service,  and  an  unusual  financial  transaction.
However, the summary does not reflect that he was asked about any drug involvement.
(FORM Item 4 at 10-11)
Applicant was interviewed again in November 2022. He told the investigator that
he self-reported his marijuana use in September 2022, after his roommate reminded him
of the panic attack he experienced after using it. (FORM Item 4 at 14)
In  response  to  DOHA  interrogatories  in  May  2023,  Applicant  stated  that  the
summary of the  November 2022 was incorrect and that he  self-reported his marijuana
use in November 2021, not September 2022. (FORM Item 4 at 4) He also submitted a
statement  of  intent  to  abstain  from  all  drug  involvement  and  substance  misuse,
acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse would be grounds for revocation of
his national security eligibility. (FORM Item 4 at 9)
