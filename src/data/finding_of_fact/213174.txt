Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated into
the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits
submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 70 years old. He graduated from a military service academy in 1976
with a bachelor’s degree and served on active duty until 1981. He received an honorable
discharge. He earned an associate degree in 1981. He never married and has no children.
He has worked for a federal contractor from 2002 until the present. He has held a security
clearance since approximately 1976. (Item 3)
Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in June 2020. In it he
disclosed that he failed to file his 2013 through 2019 federal and state income tax returns
due to neglect. For each year, he essentially stated the same:
I need  to  resolve this problem  for the  past 7  years. All  withholding  occurred,
but I failed  to  file.  Thus, I do  not believe  I owe taxes, except for possible
penalties. I am consulting legal assistance to  solve this problem.  (Item 3)
Applicant  noted  his  reason  for  failing  to  file  or  pay  his  taxes  was  “simple  neglect”  or
negligence. He disclosed that he owed $1.00. (Item 3)
Applicant  completed  government  interrogatories  in  April  2022.  He  certified  the
accuracy  of  statements  he  made  to  government  investigators  in  2014  and  2020  and
adopted them as accurate summaries of his interviews. (Item 4)
Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator in April 2014 as part of his
background investigation for his security clearance. He told the investigator that he failed
to pay any taxes for “2004/2005”. He said he had not paid his taxes because he just hated
doing it. He understood he may owe penalties. He said he did not file returns because he
did  not  owe  any  taxes  at  the  time.  He  received  numerous  letters  from  both  his  state
government and the IRS regarding unpaid taxes. In May 2010, his wages were garnished
by  the  IRS  for  $10,000  of  unpaid  taxes  for  tax  years  2005  and  2006.  He  told  the
investigator that he had federal liens on his property for failing to pay his federal income
taxes. Once he satisfied the tax debt through the garnishment, the liens were removed.
He was going to try and recoup some of this money with the help of an attorney. He told
the investigator that he will be filing all his past tax returns during the current year and will
pay any outstanding debt. (Item 4)
During his 2014 interview, Applicant also disclosed he was four months delinquent
in  paying  his  homeowner’s  association  dues  during  2013.  He  said  he  failed  to  do  so
because he was lazy. He was notified by letter from the homeowner’s association that a
lien might be placed on his property for failing to pay. Applicant paid the dues and avoided
the lien. He admitted this was not the first time he was late paying these dues. (Item 4)
Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator in August 2020. He told
the investigator that he did not file his tax returns for tax years 2013 through 2019 because
he did not get around to it, and he was lazy. He said he was working with a commercial
company to help him file his delinquent returns. He did not know if he owed taxes, but he
would pay what he owed. (Item 4)
Applicant also disclosed to the investigator during his 2020 interview that in 2013
he had not paid his homeowner’s association fees for four to five months. He eventually
paid the amount due. He said his failure to pay these dues was due to forgetfulness. He
volunteered that he was five months behind in paying his homeowner’s association dues.
He intended to pay the delinquent amount. In his SOR answer, he said he paid this debt,
and it will not happen again. He did not provide corroborating evidence he has paid this
debt.
In Applicant’s response to interrogatories, he stated the following:
Unfiled   2010   through   2015   federal  income   tax  returns  were   “being
negotiated”  by OTR (a tax service  he  hired).
Federal income  tax  returns for tax  years 2016  through  2019  were filed  in
April 2022. He said it was unknown how much he  owed.
State  income  tax  returns for 2014, 2015,  2020  and  2021  will  be  filed  in April
2022.
Federal income  tax  returns for tax years 2020  and  2021  will  be  filed  in  April
2022.
OTR is working on a repayment agreement for federal taxes owed.
Applicant  stated  in  his  interrogatory  response  that  he  had  doubts  whether  he
needed to file his 2007, 2008, and 2009 federal and state income tax returns. He did not
say why. He said he needed to research it. He explained that the reason he has failed to
timely  file  his  tax  returns  is  because  of  neglectfulness,  and  he  is  not  a  great  financial
manager. He believed he always had sufficient withholdings that would exceed his tax
liability, and he would be entitled to refunds.
IRS tax transcripts from April 2022 for tax years 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017,
2016, 2015, 2014  show no tax return had been filed. Several tax years show inquiries
were made to Applicant about non-filing of his tax returns. His 2013 tax transcript shows
a substitute return was prepared by the IRS in 2017. For tax year 2012, a substitute return
was prepared by the IRS in 2014. He provided an IRS account balance that reflected he
owed approximately $20,890 for tax years 2010 through 2013. There was no information
reported for balances owed for tax years 2014 through 2021. (Item 4)
In response to interrogatories about Applicant’s state tax returns, he stated that he
filed the returns for tax years 2014 through 2020 in April 2022. He believed he was entitled
to refunds.
Applicant did not provide any supporting documents to show he filed any of the
delinquent  federal  or  state  income  tax  returns.  He  did  not  provide  any  corroborating
evidence that he has paid his delinquent taxes, is negotiating payment  agreements, or
has hired a tax service.
In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  stated  he  earns  approximately  $168,000
annually. He owns a townhouse valued at $800,000, which has no mortgage. He said he
opted to purchase a smaller house because he is debt averse, and he does not like to
owe  money.  He  purchased a  2017  Corvette  two  years ago  with  cash.  He  said  he has
been working with a tax service since March 2021 and has agreed to pay his federal tax
bill in a single payment, which he estimated was approximately $36,000.
In SOR ¶ 1.d, the SOR alleges Applicant’s home was foreclosed upon in 2018. In
his answer, he stated:
I don’t recall   this event,  but I ADMIT  that this  may well have  happened. I
believe  that this foreclosure would  have  been  driven  by  my HOA, not  my
mortgage  company. I paid up those dues to a debt collector. On August 18
of  that  same   year,  I  paid  off   the   mortgage   to   [Lendor]  with   a   $76,890.48
credit union  check. (Item 2)
Applicant’s  July  2020  credit  reports  reflect  his  mortgage  account  was  being
foreclosed due to payments 180 days past due. His August 2023 credit report shows he
made  a  payment  of  $76,890  for  late  payments.  There  is  no  updated  evidence  to
corroborate the mortgage is foreclosed. (Items 5, 6)
Applicant stated in his SOR that he has held a security clearance for 46 years and
has  never  failed  to  recognize  the  gravity  of  the  privilege  nor  given  anyone  reason  to
doubt his allegiance to the United States. He said he is not susceptible to manipulation
by any foreign power or subversive interest. (Item 2)
