Applicant denied the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.a. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  31-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed with the defense contractor since March of 2018. Applicant is unmarried, and
has no children.  (GX 1 at pages 7, 14 and 20,)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
1.a. Applicant denies that he has a past-due debt to Creditor A in the amount of
about  $33,000.  He  avers,  credibly,  that  it  is  a  fraudulent  debt.  Applicant  filed  a  police
report in that regard, and hired an attorney to dispute its authenticity. As a result, it has
been removed from Applicant’s most recent credit report. (TR at page 26 line 11 to page
51  line  8,  GXs  4  and  5,  and  AppX  A  at  pages  1~6.)  This  allegation  is  found  for
Applicant.
