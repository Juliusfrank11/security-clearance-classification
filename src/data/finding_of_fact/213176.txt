In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, she admitted all of the SOR allegations (SOR
¶¶  1.a-1.g)  but  for  SOR  ¶  1.b,  which  she  denied,  all  with  brief  explanations.  Her
admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings follow.
Applicant is 31 years old. She earned a college degree in business administration
and finance in December 2018, in State 1. She worked as a financial analyst for a bank
from December 2015 to February 2019,  mostly while in college.  (Tr. 41) She also had
other jobs as a server in various restaurants. In early 2019, she relocated to State 2 to be
closer  to  her  family.  After  that,  she  had  a  variety  of  short-term  jobs  and  periods  of
unemployment  until  finding  work  as  a  financial  analyst  with  a  defense  contractor  in
February 2020. She has never held a clearance. She has never married, and she has no
children.  (GE  1;  Tr.  23-28)  She  works  full  time.  She  has  an  annual  salary  of  about
$75,000. (Tr. 25-26)
Applicant  attributed  her  debts
to  her  period  of  unemployment  and
underemployment after moving in early 2019. She did not have enough money saved up
and fell behind on her bills.  (Tr. 25-28) She recently  retained a debt-relief  company to
challenge and pay her unpaid debts. She paid $378 to retain them and then pays them
about $100 a month. (AE B; Tr. 30, 37-38, 50)
Applicant disclosed delinquent debts and unfiled federal income tax returns on her
SCA. (GE 1) The debts in the SOR total about $17,365. Her debts are established by her
admissions and by credit reports from July 2020 and April 2022 in the record. (Answer;
GE 2, GE 3) There is also a credit report from November 2023 in the record. (GE 4)
SOR ¶ 1.a ($694) is a debt placed in collection by a bank. (GE 2, GE 3) Applicant
asserted  that  she  paid  the  debt  around  the  time  that  the  account  was  closed  by  the
creditor (and likely sent to collections). She believes she owes about $300. She hopes to
settle this debt through the debt-relief company. (Tr. 29-31) This account remains unpaid.
(GE 4)
SOR ¶ 1.b ($98) is a past-due cell phone or internet bill. (GE 2) Applicant paid the
debt in April 2022. (AE A; Tr. 28)
SOR ¶ 1.c ($5,229) is an account placed for collection by the university Applicant
attended in State 1. (GE 2) As of November 2023, the balance was $2,523. (AE C) She
is on a $210 a month payment plan for the balance, and she made the first payment in
late 2023 (Tr. 21-22, 28-29; AE B – AE F, AE H)
SOR  ¶  1.d  ($4,989)  is  an  auto  account  placed  for  collection.  This  is  a  car  loan
Applicant took out after moving to State 2. She made payments for a time but could not
afford  the  car.  The  car  was  repossessed,  then  she  paid  to  reacquire  it,  then  it  was
repossessed again, in March 2020. She hopes to settle this debt through the debt-relief
company, but she has not had contact with the creditor for several years. (Tr. 32-35) The
account remains unpaid. (GE 4)
SOR  ¶  1.e  ($4,726)  is  a  consumer  account  placed  for  collection.  (GE  3)  This
account was a loan she took out in 2018, when she lived in State 1. She hopes to settle
this debt through the debt-relief company. (Tr. 35-37)
SOR ¶ 1.f ($1,629) is an account placed for collection by a payday loan service.
(GE 3) It remains unpaid. (Tr. 38-39)
SOR ¶ 1.g alleges that Applicant failed to timely file her federal tax returns for tax
years (TY) 2017 and 2018. She disclosed on her April 2020 SCA that those returns were
unfiled. (GE 1 at 44) She asserted that her 2018 taxes had been filed and paid within the
last year but acknowledged that her TY 2017 tax return was unfiled. She said she had
assistance from a tax preparer but did not know what happened. During these tax years,
she  was  working  at  a  bank,  during  and  after  college.  (Tr.  39-42,  63)  Post-hearing
documentation of the TY 2017 filing reflects that she owes about $1,425. (AE J) She did
not provide documentation regarding TY 2018.
Applicant  also  acknowledged  that  her  tax  returns  for  TY  2020  and  TY  2022
remained unfiled. She filed an extension for 2020 but not 2022. She let the tax filings “slip
through the cracks.” She was on a leave of absence for several months in 2022 due to a
death in the family. State 2, where she now lives, does not have a state income tax.  (Tr.
42-46, 63) After the hearing, Applicant also provided copies of her TY 2020 and TY 2022
federal income tax returns. They reflect that she owes about $5,882 and $2,815 in past-
due taxes, respectively. (AE K, AE L) Applicant said she had requested payment plans
for her unpaid taxes. (AE I) She therefore owes about $10,122 in past-due federal taxes
from TY 2017, 2020, and 2022, not including penalties and interest. It is not clear that any
of the past-due tax returns have  been filed.
Applicant provided a budget from about July 2023. She noted several of her SOR
debts  and  other  revolving  debt.  She  has  a  loan  of  about  $7,300  against  her  401k
retirement plan at work. Her budget at the time reflects a negative balance and limited if
any savings. (Tr. 51; AE P) Applicant said she  recently moved in with her sister to cut
down on rent and other expenses. She said she has about $1,200 left over each month
after bills are paid. (Tr. 48-50) Her plan is to settle her debts, repair her credit, and file her
tax  returns.  (Tr.  58-59;  AE  G,  AE  H)  She  scheduled  an  appointment  with  a  credit
counselor in early December 2023. (AE O, AE Q)
Applicant’s credit reports reflect that she has several active credit cards, and she
estimated that she has a combined balance of about $5,000, though she acknowledged
it could be as high as $30,000. She owes about $66,000 in federal student loans. (GE 4)
She has applied for a reduced payment plan now that the loans are being removed from
(COVID-19 pandemic) forbearance. She has not participated in other credit counseling.
(Tr. 53-61)
Applicant  submitted  reference  letters  from  acquaintances  who  attested  to  her
honesty,  work  ethic,  and  dependability.  (AE  M,  AE  N)  In  her  year-end  reviews,  her
supervisors all rate her as “[s]trong,” note that she is making progress in her job, and say
that she has an “amazing attitude.” (AE R)
