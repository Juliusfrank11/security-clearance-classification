Applicant  is  a  56-year-old  employee  of  a  government  contractor  for  whom  she
has  worked  since  March  2022.  She  married  in  2004  and  divorced  in  2005.  She
remarried  in  2021  but  has  been  separated  since  October  2023.  She  has  two  adult
daughters. She earned a high school diploma in 1985. She took some college courses
but did not earn a college degree. (Tr. 19-21, 35-36, 44-45; GE 1)
In  the  SOR,  the  Government  alleged  Applicant’s  five  delinquent  debts  totaling
approximately  $34,000  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.e).  These  delinquencies  consist  of  the
following: an auto loan (SOR ¶ 1.a); a personal loan (SOR ¶ 1.b); and credit cards (SOR
¶¶ 1.c through 1.e). She admitted the SOR allegations with no additional comment. Her
admissions  are  adopted  as  findings  of  fact.  The  SOR  allegations  are  established
through her admissions and the Government’s credit reports. (Answer; GE 2-4)
The  delinquent auto  loan  in the amount of $19,428  listed  in SOR  ¶  1.a  has  not
been  resolved.  Applicant  fell  behind  on  this  account  in  May  2021  when  she  was
involved  in  a  car  accident  that  totaled  the  vehicle  that  secured  the  account.  Her  auto
insurance did not cover the full amount of the loss. After her July 2022 interview with a
DOD  investigator,  she  claimed  that  she  contacted  the  creditor  to  make  payment
arrangements but could not  come to an agreement on an amount. Despite not coming
to  an  agreement  with  the  creditor,  she  claims  that  since  about  August  2022,  she  has
been  consistently  making  monthly  payments  on  this  account  in  the  amount  of  $25  to
$50. (Tr. 21-26, 47-50, 56; Answer; GE 2-4)
The  delinquent  personal loan  in  the  amount of $5,422  listed  in  SOR ¶  1.b  has not
been   resolved.  Applicant  opened   this account  to   borrow money  to   assist  her daughter
financially. She  fell  behind  on  the  account  in  March 2020  after making  about  five  timely
payments.   She   claimed   that  she   attempted   to   make   a   payment  arrangement   with   the
creditor  after her July 2022  security interview,  but the  creditor refused  to  work with  her.
The  December 2022  credit report reflects  a  last  payment date  of January 2020.  (Tr. 26-
28,  50-53; Answer; GE 2-4)
The delinquent  credit cards  in the amounts of $3,306  and $3,267  listed  in SOR
¶¶ 1.c and 1.d, respectively, have not been resolved. The December 2022 Government
credit  report  reflects  a  last  payment  date  of  early  spring  2020  on  both  accounts.
Applicant claimed that she fell behind on these accounts in 2013 or 2014 because she
could not afford the payments, and the creditors would not work with her. She claimed
that after her July 2022  security  interview,  she has been  making monthly payments  of
about  $10  to  $20  per  month  on  these  accounts,  but  also  acknowledged  that  she  has
missed some of these monthly payments on the account in SOR ¶ 1.c. (Tr. 28-29, 31,
53-58; Answer; GE 2-4)
The  delinquent credit card  in  the amount  of $3,191  listed  in  SOR ¶  1.e has not
been  resolved.  Applicant  became  delinquent  on  this  account  in  about  2015  or  2016.
She claimed that since her July 2022 security interview, she has been making monthly
payments of about $10 on this account. She claimed that about two-weeks prior to the
hearing, she applied for an additional credit card secured by a $250 payment to use to
make  payments  on  the  debt  listed  in  SOR  ¶  1.e.  She  had  not  yet  received  the  credit
card, so she did not make any additional payments on this SOR debt. She claimed that
she opened this new credit card to help pay off the debt in SOR ¶ 1.e and to raise her
credit score. (Tr. 31-34, 58-60; Answer; GE 2-4)
After  her  July  2022  security  interview,  Applicant  claimed  that  she  contacted  a
debt  consolidation  company  and  made  three  $110  monthly  payments  to  it.  However,
she claimed the debt consolidation company was not responsive and was not providing
results, so she stopped working with them after those three payments. (Tr. 29-31)
Applicant provided  no  documentation  to  corroborate  her  payments  or her  efforts
to   resolve   her  debts.   She   claimed   that  she   provided   some   documentary  evidence   of
debt  resolution  via  e-mail  to  the  DOD  investigator who  conducted  her  July 2022  security
interview, but  she  did not provide  those  documents  in this proceeding,  and  they  are not
part of the  record.  She  claimed  that she  is now able to  pay  her financial obligations, but
she  made  the  same  claim  during  her July 2022  security interview.  (Tr.  17-18,  23-24,  27-
28; Answer; GE  1-5)
In  addition  to  the  aforementioned  causes,  Applicant  claimed  her  delinquencies
were  caused  by  unemployment,  underemployment,  a  fire  that  destroyed  her  home  in
March  2021,  and  marriage  problems.  After  the  fire,  her  home  was  rebuilt,  and  she
moved back into it in July 2021. In November 2023, she stopped working because of a
medical condition and is no longer being paid. She believed that she may begin working
again in January 2024. She claimed that she has short-term disability insurance that will
pay her 60 percent of her salary, but she has yet to receive any disability payments. (Tr.
31-37, 42-45; Answer; GE 4)
Applicant  earned  about  $3,685  per  month  in  take-home  pay  from  March  2022
until  November  2023.  She  has  earned  about  $67,500,  annually.  In  August  2023,  she
sold  her home  and  bought  a  recreational  vehicle  (RV)  to  serve  as  her residence.  She
has about $8,000 in savings left over from the sale of her home, but she has not used
that money to resolve her SOR debts because she is worried that she will lose her job if
she is not awarded access to sensitive information. She also wants to save money while
she  is out  of  work  for her medical  condition.  She  claimed  that  her estranged  husband
spent  some  of  her  savings  before  she  was  able  to  transfer  the  funds  from  their  joint
checking account to an account to which he has no access. She asserted she will have
between $2,000 and $2,500 per month in surplus once she returns to work following the
aforementioned medical procedure. Beginning in March 2024, she claimed she will have
about $7,000 in a retirement account. (Tr. 35-47; GE 4)
