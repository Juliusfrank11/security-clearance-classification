In  his  Answer,  Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b  with  explanations.  His
admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  67  years  old.  He  was  married  from  1976  through  1981  and  again
from  1992  through  2007  with  both  relationships  ending  in  divorce.  He  has  three  adult
children.  He  served  in  the  Marine  Corps  from  1974  through  1977  and  received  an
honorable discharge. (GX 1-2; Tr. 25-28)
From  about  February 2001  through  October 2017, Applicant  served  as a  police
officer for a municipality. After about four months of unemployment, he started with his
current,  sponsoring  employer  in  March  2018  as  a  full-time  security  guard.  He  has  not
previously held a security clearance. (GX 1-2; Tr. 28-30)
The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  failed  to  timely  file  his  federal  and  state  tax
returns for tax years (TYs) 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2021 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b). The
allegations are established by his  admissions, his responses to interrogatories, and by
various IRS and state tax account transcripts.
Applicant  testified  that,  prior  to  his  divorce  in  2007,  his  wife  handled  their  tax
filings.  After  the  divorce,  he  struggled  to  maintain  his  financial  and  tax  obligations.  He
testified that, when he was able to file, he would use a tax preparer and submit federal
and state returns at the same time. (Tr. 44-54, 77-86)
Applicant’s  first  known  tax  delinquency  came  in  2011.  Unable  to  pay  his
mortgage and issue payments on a payday loan, he filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy. He
filed his TY 2011 federal return late, but did not recall the date. Details about Applicant’s
TY 2012 filings are also uncertain and he could not recall whether a tax debt was part of
his  bankruptcy  payments.  He  completed  his  bankruptcy  obligations,  and  it  was
discharged in 2014. (GX 1-3; Tr. 31, 44-46)
An IRS account transcript for TY 2013 shows that a return was filed in May 2014
and  that  Applicant  was  assessed  penalties  for  the  late  filing  and  late  payment.  At  the
time,  he  owed  about  $1,176  in  taxes.  However,  the  tax  debt  was  not  resolved  until
payments occurred from December 2021 through March 2022. (GX 3; Tr. 49)
In  his  July  2022  response  to  interrogatories,  Applicant  detailed  that  he  had  not
filed his federal and state tax returns for TYs 2014, 2016 and 2017, but stated his intent
to  do  so  that  month.  He  testified  that  the  federal  and  state  returns  for  all  three  years
were filed in about July 2022. He did not provide documentary evidence that he filed the
federal returns. However, records show that the state returns for these tax  years were
filed  in  2022  and  2023.  In  September  2023,  the  state  issued  a  notice  of  assessment
stating  that  Applicant  owed  an  additional  $692  in  taxes  for  TYs  2014  and  2016.  He
promptly  paid  this  debt.  The  state  also  issued  a  notice  denying  Applicant  a  refund  for
TY 2017  because  the  filing  was  received  more  than  three  years  after  it  was  due.
(GX 3-5; AX A-C, G-M; Tr. 51-57, 68-71)
An  IRS  account  transcript  reflects  that  Applicant  filed  his  TY  2015  return  in
October  2016  and  was  assessed  penalties  for  the  late  filing  and  late  payment.  At  the
time  of  the  filing,  Applicant  owed  about  $497.  However,  Applicant  did  not  complete
payments on that debt until November 2021. Records do not reflect when the state filing
occurred,  but  do  indicate  that  the  state  taxes  for  TY  2015  were  paid.  (GX  3;  AX  J;
Tr. 59)
Applicant  testified  that  he  filed  his  federal  and  state  TY  2018  returns  in
September  2023.  He  did  not  provide  documentary  evidence  that  he  filed  the  federal
return. However, state records confirm that the state return was filed and taxes paid in
September 2023. (GX 3, 6; AX D, N; Tr. 73-74)
Applicant  filed  his  TY  2019  federal  and  state  returns  on  time.  He  received  a
penalty from the IRS for not prepaying his taxes, but the taxes have since been paid. He
filed  his  TY  2020  federal  and  state  returns  late,  in  June  2021.  He  was  assessed
penalties for the  late filing  of his federal return  and late payment. All federal and state
taxes for TY 2020 were paid. (GX 3, 7; AX J; Tr. 76-78)
As of May 20, 2022, an IRS account transcript shows that Applicant had not filed
his TY 2021 federal return. Applicant testified that he filed his federal and  state returns
in September 2022. He did not provide documentary evidence that he filed the federal
return.  However,  state  records  show  that  the  state  tax  filing  and  payment  occurred  in
September 2022. (GX 3, 7; AX E; Tr. 77-79)
Applicant testified that he filed his TY 2022 federal and state returns in February
2023 and paid the taxes that were due. He stated it was his intent to timely file and pay
his obligations in the future. (Tr. 80-81)
Applicant  detailed  that,  after  the  Chapter  13  bankruptcy,  his  financial  difficulties
continued. In 2018, the mortgage account on his home went into foreclosure and he lost
the property. Financial difficulties over the years made him reluctant, at times, to file his
tax returns because he could not afford to pay a tax preparer or pay the taxes that were
likely due. (GX 1-2; Tr. 82-96)
In his April 2018 SCA, Applicant stated that “procrastination” also played a part in
the  escalation  of  his  tax  problems,  but  that  he  had  “full  intentions”  of  resolving  the
filings.  He  reiterated  these  intentions  during  his  April  2019  background  interview.  At
hearing, Applicant testified that the security investigation had “lit a fire” for him to resolve
his  tax  and  financial  circumstances.  Additionally,  since  starting  with  his  current
employer, his financial circumstances have significantly improved, and he believes he is
in  a  much  better  position  to  handle  his  future  financial  and  tax  obligations.  (GX  1-2;
Tr. 39-42, 91-96)
