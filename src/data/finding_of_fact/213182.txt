In Applicant’s response to the SOR, he admitted allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c,
2.b, and 2.c; and denied allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 2.a. Applicant’s admissions are
incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is 23 years old. Born in Ghana, he arrived in the United States with his
parents in 2006 at the age of six. He attended schools in the United States and became
a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2016 at age 16.
Applicant received his high school diploma in May 2018. He attended an out-of-
state college after graduation from May 2018 to about December 2019, until he withdrew
from school as a result of the arrest alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c discussed below. In January
2020, he enrolled in a different college. In May 2023, he was awarded a bachelor’s degree
in business management and information systems. Applicant has never been married and
has no children. (GE 1; and Tr. 17-20)
Since  August  2022,  Applicant  has  worked  for  a  defense  contractor  as  an
administrative  support  technician.  His  duties  involve  work  accomplished  on  a  federal
installation. He previously held an interim secret security clearance, which was removed
when  he  did  not  initially  clear.  In  November 2023,  he  was  placed  in  an  administrative
leave status pending the outcome of this adjudication process. (Tr. 17-20)
Applicant was raised in State 1. In October 2019, while attending a college in State
2, he  was  arrested  by campus police  for possession of marijuana  after marijuana  was
found  in  his  dorm  room.  His  arrest  was  then  processed  by  local  police,  and  he  later
appeared in court. Applicant testified that all charges were subsequently dropped. (GE 1
and  GE 2; and Tr. 17-33)
As a result of the arrest, however, Applicant faced discipline from college officials.
He testified he was given the option to either leave the university voluntarily within a week,
or  risk  defending  himself  before  a  college  disciplinary  board  where  he  faced  formal
expulsion and an unfavorable student record. He chose the former and signed a voluntary
permanent separation from the college in November 2019. As a result, he was banned
from all campuses and unable to re-enroll. (GE 2 at 8; Tr. 26-30) As discussed above,
Applicant soon enrolled in college elsewhere, and eventually earned his degree.
When  Applicant  submitted  his May  2022  SCA, he  did not disclose  any prior drug
involvement; nor did  he  disclose  his 2019  arrest  for marijuana  possession. Specifically,
he  answered  “no” in  response  to  two  questions in Section  23, Illegal Use of  Drugs  or Drug
Activity, which  asked  whether, in the  last seven  years, Applicant  had: (1) illegally used
any drugs or controlled  substances;  and  (2) illegally purchased, received, handled, etc.,
any drug  or controlled   substance.   He   also   answered   “no”  in   response   to  a   question   in
Section   22,  Police   Record,  which   asked   whether   he   had   ever  been   charged   with   an
offense involving  alcohol or drugs.  (GE 1  pp. 27-29)  (SOR ¶¶  1.c, and  2.a  - 2.c)
In  Applicant’s  June  2022  interview  with  DOD  investigators,  authenticated  in
October 2022, he disclosed he first used marijuana in May 2018, and that he last used it
in June 2022, prior to his DOD interview. He also disclosed he acquired the marijuana by
either purchasing it from multiple dealers or receiving it as a gift from others. (GE 2 at 10;
Tr. at 26) (SOR ¶¶ 1.a  and 1.b)
In the hearing Applicant testified he subsequently used marijuana twice after his
June  2022  background  interview:  in  October  2022  before  completing  his  response  to
interrogatories; and in December 2022. This last use he stated was due to the depression
and sadness he felt after the death of his grandmother with whom he enjoyed a close
relationship. His December 2022 marijuana use occurred after the issuance date of the
SOR, November 9, 2022, though it is unclear if Applicant actually received it beforehand.
He testified that December 2022 was the last time he used marijuana, and that he has no
future intent to use it. (Tr. 23-29, 40-45)
During the hearing, Applicant admitted he deliberately falsified his answers to the
above  SCA  questions  because  he  was  concerned  that  admitting  his  illegal  drug
involvement, including his drug use, purchase, and his drug-related arrest for possession
of illegal drugs would hinder his ability to obtain a security clearance. He also testified his
employer has a drug-free workplace policy, and that he signed an agreement not to use
illegal drugs. (Tr. 18-19, 28, 35-36)
Applicant  testified  he  made  the  decision  to  “do  better”  after  his  grandmother
passed away. His grandmother’s passing and his current job motivated him to graduate
from college and to stop using marijuana. He discussed his feelings of depression with
his medical doctor, but was never clinically diagnosed with depression. He also disclosed
his use of marijuana to his doctor, but stated he was never prescribed medical marijuana.
He  used  marijuana  primarily  for  recreational  purposes.  (Tr.  32-34,  41-45)  Applicant
submitted two supplemental documents: a personal statement, and a copy of his job offer
from a federal agency, both of which were considered in this case. (AE A and AE B)
