In Applicant’s Answer to the SOR he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.b,
1.e, and 1.h and he denied SOR ¶¶ 1.c-1.d and 1.f-1.g. His admissions are incorporated
in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  58-year-old  technician.  He  first  held  a  clearance  in  2006  while
working for a government agency from June 2006 to July 2017 (Item 2 at 14, 51.) He was
unemployed from August 2017  to April 2018 and again  from October 2018  to  January
2019. (Item 2 at 12-13.) He has completed some college course work, has been married
to his current spouse since 2014, and has one child. (Item 2.) He divorced his first spouse
in 2013. (Item 2 at 20.) He has over $52,000 in alleged consumer debt and a delinquent
tax debt to the Federal government totaling approximately $60,803.
In his Answer, Applicant cites his illness, a loss  of records and other unspecified
“extenuating  circumstances”  for  his  financial  difficulties.  He  notes  he  is  on  the  road  to
“repair and recovery” of his financial situation. As part of his Answer, he provided a June
2023 letter from his accountant to the IRS, which summarizes his personal situation and
the reason for him not filing the tax returns in question until 2023. The accountant cites to
the IRS: 1) an out of state move that his employer had initially approved but was then
rescinded, which he elected to proceed forward with requiring that he sell his house in
state A; 2) a medical condition that was “severely affected” by the move requiring him to
be  hospitalized  for  months;  and  3) being  unable  to  work due  to  his  medical  condition,
which resulted in him filing a lawsuit against his employer. (Answer at 4.) He included the
tax returns for tax years 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 with his
Answer.
In  his  October  2023  Response  to  the  FORM,  he  states  he  has  spent  years
attempting  to  obtain  the  correct  income  reporting  documents  from  his  tenure  with  the
government agency, which had incorrectly reported his income for tax years 2015, 2016,
and 2017. He states that after “many futile attempts to obtain the correct form, and only
after hiring tax professionals to help resolve the cascading issue, was [he] able to bring
[his] tax return filings current for all outstanding years through 2022.” (Response.)
In Applicant’s FORM Response he states most of his consumer debt was due to
unemployment during the pandemic. (Item 3 at 12-13.) He states, “I have been gainfully
employed  and  have  been  and  remain  active  in  resolving  all  outstanding  obligations.”

the Company thought there could be an issue with identity theft. (Item 4 at 10.)
