Applicant is a 59-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security
clearance. Allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are incorporated
and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow.
Background
Applicant married in January 1985 and divorced in January 1988. (GE 1; Tr. 39)
He  has  two  adult  children  from  this  marriage.  (GE  1;  Tr.  39)  He  remarried  in  January
1995, divorced in January 1997, and has one adult child from the marriage. (GE 1; Tr.
39-40)  He  earned  a  high  school  diploma  in  December  1981  and  a  certificate  of
completion  of  a  truck-driving  course  in  March  2020.  (GE  1)  Applicant  reported  no
military service.
Since  September 1992, Applicant has  been  employed  as an  over-the-road  truck
driver. (GE 1; Tr. 36-37)  In  his work, he  leases his owned  truck to  his employer. (Tr. 36-
37)  Contemporaneously  with   his  current  employment,   he   and   his  son   have   operated
their  own  trucking  business. (GE  1) Between  April  2020  and  April 2021, Applicant  and
his  son   were   self-employed   with   their   own   trucking   business.  (GE  1;   Tr.  36-37))
Previously,  he  was  self-employed  in  sailing  ventures  and  car dealerships.  (GE  1; Tr.  37-
39) Applicant has never held a security  clearance.  (GE 1; Tr. 37)
Applicant’s finances
Between 2018 and 2022, Applicant was self-employed in various businesses that
failed.  (GE  1)  He  reported  major  losses  and  sold  his  businesses  individually,  netting
between  $500,000  and  $600,000.  (GE  1)  With  his  proceeds,  he  invested  in  other
business ventures “to shore them up.” (GE 1)
Tax records document that Applicant did not timely file either his federal income
tax  returns,  as  required,  for  tax  years  2018  through  2022  or  his  State  A  income  tax
returns for tax years 2018-2020 and 2022, as required. (GEs 1-2 and AEs C-K and P;
Tr. 40) Tax records also confirm that Applicant did not timely file his State B income tax
return for tax year 2018, as required. (GEs 1-2)
In  his  post-hearing  submissions,  Applicant  documented  his  filing  his  federal
income tax returns in December 2023 for tax years 2018-2020, but he has been unable
to  obtain  verifying  IRS  transcripts  for  tax  years  2021  and  2022.  (AEs  O  and  Q)
Previously,  the  federal  tax  returns  he  provided  for  tax  years  2018-2022  were  neither
signed nor filed. Before filing them, he was awaiting instructions from his tax preparer.
(AEs C-G; Tr. 41-42)
As with  his federal tax returns,  Applicant’s State  A  tax returns for tax years  2018-
2020  and  2022  were not filed  before  his security clearance  hearing  in November 2023.
(GEs  1-2;  Tr.  27-28,  41-42)  Among   his   post-hearing   submissions   was  a   documented
State A  tax filing  (dated  December  2023) for tax year 2019. His submitted  October 2023
tax  correspondence   from   his  tax   preparer  referenced   the   prepared   tax   return   for  tax
year  2019, but did not cover any  of the  other State A  tax years covered  in the  SOR. (AE
P) And, Applicant’s signed  2019  State  A  tax return bears a  signature  date  of December
2023.  (AE   P)  Without   more   documentation   from   Applicant,  State   A   tax  returns  for  the
missing  2018  and  2020-2022  tax years cannot be  credited  to  Applicant as  filed  returns
for  these   years   in  issue.   Applicant  attributed   his  late   tax   filings  to   procrastination.   (Tr.
42)
Because Applicant failed to provide any documented evidence of filing his State
B  income  tax  return  for  tax  year  2018,  he  cannot  be  credited  with  filing  a  State  B  tax
return for that tax year. Based on the evidence produced and developed by Applicant to
date, Applicant’s due 2018 tax return for State B remains unfiled.
Besides  his  federal  and  state  tax  filing  lapses,  Applicant  accumulated  11
delinquent  debts  exceeding  $102,000.  (GEs  1-4)  To  date,  most  of  his  accrued  debts
remain  unaddressed  and  outstanding.  (GEs  1-4)  Currently,  he  has  no  documented
payment plan or plans for addressing the bulk of these debts. (Tr. 42-43) Nor does he
have  any  identified  resources  to  pay  his  SOR  creditors  (either  through  payoffs  or
payment  plans)  Asked  why  some  of  the  listed  SOR  debts  have  fallen  off  of  his  credit
report, Applicant could provide no meaningful explanations for most of them. Although,
he  did  acknowledge  that  several of  these  creditors  (1.e.,  those  with  accounts  covered
by  SOR  ¶¶  1.d-1.e,  1.g  and  1.j)  made  contact  with  him  in  their  efforts  to  resolve  the
debts. (Tr. 44-53)
While Applicant has paid off one creditor (SOR ¶ 1.h), accepted payment offers
from two of the listed SOR creditors (SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.g) and made payments to them
in  accordance  with  the  settlement  terms  with  these  creditors  (AEs  M  and  R-S),  the
remainder of his SOR-listed debts remain unaddressed. (Tr. 43-54) Applicant attributed
his delinquent accounts to several sources: business losses, embezzlement by a former
employee, and procrastination. (AE K; Tr. 33-34, 42-49)
Whether  Applicant’s  delinquent  accounts  (exceeding  $102,000)  are  business-
related, personal, or a combination of both is unclear. Because he accepts responsibility
for  all  of  the  debts  (reported  as  individually  opened  accounts  in  his  credit  reports),
distinctions  between  business  and  personal  debts  make  no  material  difference  in
assessing  Applicant’s  payment  obligations  for the  debts.  Legally,  he  remains  liable  for
all of the debts regardless of how they are classified. (GEs 1-4)
Endorsements
Applicant’s  son  and  business  partner  endorsed  him.  (Tt.  60-63)  Together,  they
transport  military  components  for  the  DoD.  (Tr.  61)  Applicant’s  son  described  himself
and  Applicant  as  “fantastic  truck  drivers”  and  consistently  available  for  whatever  is
timely  needed  by  the  DoD.  (Tr.  60)  He  credited  Applicant  with  trustworthiness  and
acceptance of responsibility for whatever obligations are imposed on persons who hold
security clearances. (Tr. 64)
