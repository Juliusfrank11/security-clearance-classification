In  his  Answer,  Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations  except  for  SOR  ¶
1.b,  which  he  denied.  He  is  49  years  old,  married,  and  he  has  an  adult  child.  He
graduated from high school in 1993 and attended various colleges from 1993 to 1995, in
2004,  and  from  2006  to  2009,  but  he  did  not  earn  a  degree.  He  received  an  aircraft
maintenance  technician  diploma  in  1997,  and  he  received  numerous  technical
certifications.  He  owned  his  first  home  from  July  2004  to  February  2014,  and  he  has
since owned his second home. (Items 1-3, 7)
Applicant has worked in the information technology field since 1997. He worked
for  a  DOD  contractor  overseas  from  December  2010  to  July  2014,  and  he  worked  for
another  DOD  contractor  from  July  2021  to  at  least  the  date  of  his  May  2022  security
clearance  application  (SCA).  He  was  self-employed  from  August  2014  to  at  least  May
2022, and he was unemployed from around March 2020 to October 2020. Since March
2023, he has worked as an independent contractor network consultant for his employer,
a DOD contractor. He was first granted a security clearance in 2010. (Items 1-3, 7-8)
The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  had  eight  delinquent  consumer  debts  totaling
$187,376 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c, 1.e-1.i) and a medical account in collection for $3,043 (SOR
¶  1.d).  The  allegations  are  established  by  Applicant’s  admissions  in  his  Answer,  May
2022  security  clearance  application  (SCA),  June  2022  background  interview  with  an
authorized  DOD  investigator,  November  2022  response  to  interrogatories,  and  credit
bureau reports from June 2022, November 2022, February 2023, and July 2023. (Items
1-8)
Applicant attributed his delinquent debts to his failed house-flipping business he
started with a business partner. He obtained large personal loans from 2018 to 2020 to
fund the business. When he elected not to close on a property after deciding it was not
a worthwhile project because the property had a lien, he utilized the loan money to pay
his credit cards. He was financially overextended. (Items 2-3, 7-8)
Applicant  stated  that  the  COVID-19  pandemic  halted  any  further  business,  and
he was furloughed by his employer, a private company, in March 2020. He stated in his
Answer that his business ultimately failed when his partner became ill and subsequently
passed  away. He  used  the  equity  from  the sale  of  his  first home  to  settle  some of his
debts upon obtaining employment. Although he considered resolving his debts through
a debt consolidation plan in approximately September 2019, as well as other debt relief
programs, he did not finalize any of those options.  With his current employment as an
independent contractor,  he stated in his response to interrogatories that he is required
“to  pay  for  all  expenses  traveling  and  working  to  be  reimbursed  30  days  later.”  He
consequently  has  to  “be  careful  with  my  finances  and  make  payments  that  are
manageable for my debts.” (Items 2-3, 7-8)
Applicant  stated  in  his  Answer  that  he  had  monthly  payment  arrangements  of
$277, $50, $50, and $243, respectively, to resolve the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.e, 1.f, and
1.g,  which  total  $113,351.  He  made  the  following  payments  in  accordance  with  these
arrangements: for SOR ¶ 1.a, he made a $100 payment in May 2023 and five monthly
payments  of  $277  from  June  2023  to  October  2023;  for  SOR  ¶  1.e,  he  made  a  $50
payment  in  May  2023;  for  SOR  ¶  1.f,  he  made  a  $50  payment  in  May  2023;  and  for
SOR  ¶  1.g,  he  made  a  $116  payment  in  January  2019  and  a  $243  payment  in  May
2023. He intended to increase his monthly payments for SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g once
he had the financial means to do so. (Items 2, 7]
Applicant also stated in his Answer that he paid the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.d,
but  he  did  not  provide  documentation  to  corroborate  his  claim.  He  stated  that  he  was
awaiting correspondence from the creditor for SOR ¶ 1.b, but he did not provide proof of
payment.  Although  he  provided  a  copy  of  a  return  receipt  for  correspondence  that  he
mailed to an attorney for the creditor in SOR ¶ 1.d, such documentation does not reflect
that he paid this debt. He intended to continue resolving these debts. (Items 2, 7)
Applicant also stated in his Answer that he contacted the creditor for SOR ¶ 1.c,
and  that  he  was  in  the  process  of  negotiating  a  payment  arrangement  to  resolve  this
debt. He intended to resolve this debt. He also stated that he contacted the creditor for
SOR  ¶  1.i  to  negotiate  a  payment  arrangement,  but  that  he  had  not  received  a
response. He intended to continue trying to resolve this debt. (Item 2)
Applicant also  stated  in  his  Answer that  he  had  been  paying  the  debt  in SOR  ¶
1.h.   He   acknowledged   that   he   did   not  have   documentation   to   corroborate   his   claim   of
payment.  He intended  to continue resolving this  debt. (Item 2)
Applicant’s annual salary as of his Answer was $115,000. In November 2022, he
estimated  that  he  and  his  spouse’s  combined  net  monthly  income  was  $10,600,  and
their  monthly  net  remainder  after  expenses,  which  included  some  of  the  SOR  debts,
was  $3,546.  He  signed  a  statement  of  intent  to  “always  pay  my  debts  to  maintain
financial stability,” and that any failure to do so would result in the automatic revocation
of his clearance. There is no evidence in the record that Applicant received any financial
counseling. He stated that he takes his security clearance responsibilities seriously, no
matter his financial status. (Items 2, 7)
