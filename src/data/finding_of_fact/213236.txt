In his Answer, Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d, and he denied SOR
¶ 1.c.  He is 39 years old. He has never married, and he does not have any children. He
graduated from high school in May 2002. He attended college from September 2002 to
December 2007 and earned a bachelor’s degree. He has owned his home since 2018.
(Items 1-4) He has worked as an audio video engineer for a private company since July
2014. He has never held a security clearance. He is being sponsored for a public trust
position. (Items 3, 5)
Applicant  used  and  purchased  marijuana  with  varying  frequency  from  January
1998  to  at  least  February  2022,  including  after  he  completed  an  e-QIP  on  January  7,
2022,  to  obtain  a  DOD  position  of  trust.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.b)  He  purchased  it  for  his
personal  use,  and  he  used  it  once  to  twice  weekly  in  the  evenings,  at  home,  to  relax
after  work  and  to  exercise  his  civil  liberties.  He  maintained  during  his  February  2022
background  interview  that  he  does  not  associate  with  individuals  who  use  drugs
illegally, and that he has never used marijuana in the presence of others.  He intends to
continue to use and purchase marijuana in the future. (SOR ¶ 1.d) He does not consider
stopping to be an option. (Items 1-4)
Applicant denied that he used and purchased marijuana in February 2022, while
employed  in  a  sensitive  position,  as  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.c  (Item  1)  In  his  Answer,  he
claimed that he was not employed in a sensitive position when he used and purchased
marijuana  in  February 2022.  The  record  does  not  contain  any  evidence  that Applicant
was employed in a sensitive position in February 2022. It only reflects that he has been
sponsored for a public trust position since February 2022.
