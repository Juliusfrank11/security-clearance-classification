Applicant is a 40-year-old, single man. For the past six years, he has been working
for a defense contractor as an engineer. Previously, he worked as a sales representative

Applicant has been using marijuana weekly from about 2013 to 2022. (Item 1 at 3)
He buys marijuana from state dispensaries and uses it in both cigarette and edible form.
(Item 4 at 4) He enjoys using it because it makes him feel calm. (Item 4 at 4) He has used it
at different points in his career while he possessed either a security clearance or a position
of trust. (Item 4 at 6) On September 14, 2023, Applicant completed a set of interrogatories
that the Government propounded. Questions 13 and 14 asked the following:
13. Do  you  understand  that  marijuana  use  remains  illegal  under Federal law
and   that  any  future  use   of  marijuana   may  affect  your  security  clearance
eligibility?
14.   Do   you   intend   to   illegally  use   drugs   or   controlled   substances   in   the
future?
Applicant answered “Yes” to both questions. (Item 4 at 7)
In 2020, Applicant completed a security clearance application. He did not disclose
his marijuana involvement and his use of marijuana while possessing a security clearance.
(Item 2 at 24) In his Answer, he explained that he did not disclose his use because it was
obtained legally and used in a state where it was legal. (Item 1 at 4)  Section 23 of the
security  clearance  application,  which  contained  all  the  questions  related  to  drug
involvement, informs applicants to answer the questions “in accordance with Federal Laws,
even though permissible under state laws.”  (Item 4 at 24) Two months later, Applicant
disclosed his marijuana use during an investigative interview. (Item 4 at 10,11)
