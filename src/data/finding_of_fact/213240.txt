Applicant  is  a  47-year-old  executive  assistant  (EA)  employed  by  a  defense
contractor since September 2021. She has worked in various administrative positions for
13 different federal contractors since 2004. She has held a security clearance since about
2004. She attended college but has not earned a degree. She married in 1996 and has
three children, ages 29, 27 and 26. (GE 1; AE A-H; Tr. 13, 29, 54-55, 79-81)
The SOR alleges that in about March 2020, Company A refunded approximately
$3,380 to the government due to a 56.75 hour discrepancy between Applicant’s reported
time  and  government  badge  swipe  records,  and  that  in  about  March  2020  she  was
terminated by Company B or resigned in lieu of termination due to timecard discrepancies
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.b). She denied both allegations with explanations. (Answer)
From July 2015 to March 2020 Applicant worked for various contractors in direct
support of the same defense agency (Agency). She was employed as an EA for Company
A  from  August  2016  to  October  2019  when  she  resigned  to  pursue  a  better  job  with
Company B. She was employed as a strategic analyst for Company B from October 2019
to February 2020. While employed by Companies A and B, Applicant worked in different
buildings in the same four-building, campus-like complex on a military installation. Each
building had multiple access points and accessible parking areas. There was no perimeter
fence  or  designated  access  control  point.  In  early  2020,  Agency  compared  some
contractor  timecards  with  building  badge  swipe  records  to  identify  potential  timecard
fraud. (GE 1, 4-5; Tr. 27-34, 80-83, 87)
On   February  28,  2020,  Agency   notified   Company   A   that  building   badge   swipe
records  from   April  2019   through   September  2019   reflected   a   52-hour  discrepancy
between  the  973   hours billed  for Applicant’s   services and  the  amount of time  she  was
“badged   into”   an   Agency  complex.   (GE   2   at  1)  Agency   requested  Company   A  provide
evidence   to   rebut   the   apparent  mischarging   or  reimburse  the   government  for  the
discrepancy   plus a   fee.  In   March 2020,   Company  A   confirmed   a  discrepancy   between
Agency  internal badging  records and  company records  and  found  that “977  hours were
billed   and   56.75   hours  were   not  allocable   to   the   contract  .  .  .   .  with   an   actual  cost  of
$3,219.28  and  fee  of $160.96, for a  total of  $3,380.24  due  to  the  Government.” (GE  3)
Company A  reimbursed  the  Government  for the  discrepant hours.  (GE  2-5;  Tr. 107-108)
Company A‘s Director of Security and Facility Security Officer (FSO) explained:
[Agency] began  running  timecard  checks based  on  individuals badging  in
and   out   of   the   building.  This  was  a   flawed   process   which   [Company   A
chose]  not  to  appeal, and  paid  back any  difference  found. The  flaw comes
when  an  Admin Assistant leaves the  building  and  makes a  delivery or pick
up  related  to  their  job. [Agency’s] position  was that an  individual could not
have  worked  the total hours claimed  if  they were not  in the  building  for that
number of hours. Administrative Assistants are often  asked  to  “run  errands”
for  their   job.  .  .  .  Since   [we]  could  not  adjudicate   whether  the   time   was
fraudulently entered  or not,  we decided  to  simply pay back this amount. It
was  my  judgement   this  was   not  sufficient  evidence   to   enter  an   incident
report on the individual. (GE 4)
Applicant denied  the  SOR allegation  regarding  Company  A  and  identified  problems
with   the   badging   system   in   the   building   where   she   worked.   (SOR   ¶   1.b;   Answer).   She
explained  that “I  had  no  idea  there was  an  investigation  nor  was I given  a  chance  to  refute
the   findings.”  (Answer)  Notably,  Company  A’s  assessment  of  Applicant’s  original  and
corrected  timesheets from  April 15, 2019  through  September 2019  showed  no  difference
in  her  hours  worked   except  two  periods  were   “corrected”  to   show  more  hours  than
originally claimed  (100.50  to  105.50, and  88  to  89.25  hours). (GE 5  at 23, 26) Company
A identified  63  hours Applicant worked  as “Unbillable Labor.” (GE 5  at 1)
On Friday, February 28, 2020, Applicant’s supervisor at Company B informed her
that  Agency  identified  an  estimated  39-hour  discrepancy  between  her  timesheets  and
Agency  access  card  swipe  logs  from  October  2019  to  December  2019.  On  Monday,
March 2, 2020, at 1:41 PM, Applicant’s supervisor sent her an email identifying nine dates
from October 2019 through December 2019 with more than an hour discrepancy between
hours reported on her timesheet and Agency badging records. (GE 6) He also asked if
she had been able to corroborate that she had been approved to work some hours from
home and said he needed her information by the end of the workday so he could timely
respond to Agency. (GE 6-7; Tr. 25-29, 37-39, 87-88, 94-97) Applicant’s response later
that day included:
[Company  B]  has already started  the  ball  removing  me  as an  employee.  No
matter what I have  found  the  bottom  line  is, will  it change  anything?  Along
with  the  undercharged  time  there is overcharged  time  reflected. The  word
has already been  put out at [Agency] that I am  not returning. Seems to  me
[Company   B]   had   no   intention   to   let   me   clear  my   name;  all   I  want  is  my
security  clearance   intact.   .   .  .   I  am   officially  resigning   from   the   company
effective Friday, February 28, 2020. (GE 6)
In her SCA of June 29, 2020, Applicant reported she had resigned from Company
B because:
I was suspended  d[ue]  to  discrepanc[ies] in time  card  entries. I was  asked
to   account   for  hours  and   entries  that  did   not   match.  I  was  [in]formed   on
Friday  28   February  and   given   until  Friday  6   March   to   help   explain  the
discrepancy.  I  was  contacted   on   Monday  2   March  and   asked   if  I  had
completed  my research. I had  not,  as it was a  weekend, so  I tendered  my
resignation. I did not f[eel] I was given  enough time  and felt pressure to get
this done  when  I need  time  to  compare  my calendars. I  want to  save  my
clearance  and  name, so  I resigned. I filed  for unemployment,  was denied
and in the  hearing I found  out the company had received the inquiry weeks
earlier  than   when   I   was  notified.   They   also   stressed   the   fact  that  I  left
preempting  the  investigation, they  at  the  time  had  no  intention  of  firing  me.
I jumped the gun  and now understand I was to[o]  emotional. (GE  1  at 14)
Applicant’s testimony at hearing, statements to a government investigator during
a December 2020 background interview, and explanations in her Answer to the SOR were
generally consistent. She denied falsifying timecards at any time she worked as a federal
contractor.  She  said  that  on  Friday,  February  28,  2020,  her  supervisor  at  Company  B
invited  her  to  an  offsite  location  where  he  informed  her  that  Agency  had  identified  an
estimated 39-hour discrepancy between her timesheets and Agency access card swipe
logs from October 1, 2019 to December 1, 2019. She denied that she falsified her time
sheet and asked if she could obtain emails and personal records including notes about
her  daily  duties  to  prepare  her  response.  Her  supervisor  said  that  he  would  try  to  get
someone to send it to her. He retrieved her Agency access badge, provided her a copy
of the audit, said she had until Friday, March 6, 2020, to explain the discrepancies, and
he sent her home. (Answer; GE 6-7; Tr. 25-29, 37-53, 66-70, 83-84, 87, 94-101)
Applicant was unable to return to her agency workspace to access her computer
or  her  notes  or  to  otherwise  research  records  to  document  her  work  hours  before
receiving the email from her supervisor on Monday, March 2, 2020. After receiving the
email  from  her  supervisor,  she  requested  a  coworker  retrieve  her  notes  and  other
information. The coworker informed Applicant that she could not  retrieve the notebook
because  Applicant’s  belongings  were  being  packed  up  for  delivery  to  Company  B.
Applicant had seen other employees treated in a similar manner and believed she had no
viable  recourse  to  research  or  resolve  the  time  discrepancies.  She  believed  she  was
about to be terminated; she felt that she was being treated unfairly; and she was frustrated
and angry. She was also aware that being fired could affect her security clearance, so
she  immediately  resigned  via  email.  She  stated  her  belief  that  if  she  had  been  given
access to her office and more time that she could have provided a logical response and
evidence to explain the discrepancies. She received her personal belongings including
her notebooks about two weeks later. She said that she later learned that Company B
had no intention to fire her and that she reacted too emotionally by resigning. (GE 1, 6-7;
AE B; Tr. 25-27, 40-50, 61-63, 83-89, 90-101)
Applicant said Agency swipe log records were inaccurate, that the Agency badging
system was often down and transitioning from access badges to common access cards,
and  that  security  personnel  would  often  have  to  manually  open  turn  styles  at  building
access points. She denied improperly reporting time when she was not at work and said
she only left her desk when required to go to other buildings in the Agency complex or
other buildings on the base, and when she was on break or at lunch. She acknowledged
that she sometimes returned late from lunch but said she was never more than 30 minutes
late. She said her job responsibilities required her to walk to other buildings, that she often
used an entrance without badge swipe access and that security personnel would visually
inspect badges and allow entry or exit. She said workers were not required to access the
Agency building via a specified access point, and that there was no way for Agency to
accurately audit time spent in the building through card swipe records  due to turn style
issues and an entrance that did not have a turn style. (Answer; GE 7; Tr. 27-29, 34-37,
58-62, 80-83, 102-104)
Applicant testified that the only time she entered inaccurate information into her
timecard was at the direction of her program manager and supervisor during a six-month
period not alleged in the SOR. She said Company A employees were sometimes required
to  work  more  than  eight  hours  by  Agency,  but  could  not  request  overtime  and  were
prohibited from claiming more than 40 hours per week. She said Company A employees
were directed to submit timesheets showing no more than 40 hours worked per week,
that Company A tracked and treated any excess hours worked as compensatory time off,
and that Agency was aware of the practice. (Tr. 63-71; GE 5-6)

An  Agency  executive  that  Applicant  supported  as  an  EA  while  employed  by
information,
Company  A  noted  her  responsibilities
administrative  matters,  and  customer  interaction.  (AE  H;  Tr.  77-78)  He  praised  her
organizational skills, reliability, dependability, self-discipline, and dedication to her job and
the team. He also provided his “highest recommendation.” (AE H) Six current or former
Agency executives commented favorably on her conscientiousness, work ethic, integrity,
commitment to people and mission, and reliability. (AE A, G) Two long-term colleagues
and  friends  praised  her  outstanding  dedication,  trustworthiness,  moral  fiber,  integrity,
dependability, timeliness, commitment to people and mission, and noted she had earned
the trust of senior executives.  (AE  C, E) A  former Parent  Teacher Organization (PTO)
president  commented  favorably  on  her  performance  as  PTO  treasurer  including  her
diligence,  problem-solving  ability,  and  professionalism,  and  provided  her  unqualified
recommendation. (AE F) Applicant’s pastor of 20 years and a man who has known her
since her birth praised her loyalty, honesty, dependability, and significant contributions to
her church including service as a youth advisor. (AE D)
