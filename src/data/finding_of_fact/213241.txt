Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.h through 1.l. He denied the SOR
allegations in ¶¶ 1.a through 1.g and 1.m through 1.o. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 41 years old. He is twice married and has four minor children who do
not reside with him. He has some college credits but did not earn a degree. He has worked
for his present employer, a federal contractor, since July 2017.
Applicant  completed  a  security  clearance  application  in  May  2022.  He  did  not
disclose he had any delinquent debts, delinquent tax debts, or unfiled tax returns. He was
interviewed by a government investigator in June 2022. During the interview, he disclosed
that he owed money to the IRS and was delinquent in filing at least one tax years’ return.
He said he would file the delinquent return by July 2022. He believed he owed taxes to
the IRS for tax years 2008 to 2017, but he could not afford to make a payment plan with
the IRS. He said he wanted to pay his tax debt, but his wife had health issues and then
lost her job during the COVID pandemic. (Item 4)
When  Applicant  was  confronted  with  his  delinquent  debts  by  the  government
investigator he said generally the same thing about each debt, that is he was unaware of
the debt, but he would look into it, and contact the creditor. If it was determined that he
owed the debt, he would set up a payment plan to resolve each debt. (Item 4)
Applicant  answered  government  interrogatories  and  was  asked  to  comment  on
each of the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.h through 1.o. For each debt he noted that it was
not paid and he was not making payments. He answered “no” to the question that asked
if he had any adverse or delinquent accounts, including local, state, or federal tax debts
that he currently owed. (Item 5)
The SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file his 2020 and 2021 federal income tax
returns (SOR ¶ 1.a). It also alleged that Applicant was indebted to the federal government
for  delinquent  taxes  for  tax  years  2012  ($2,989),  2014  ($2,295),  2015  ($1,275),  2016
($1,099), 2017 ($1,819), and 2019 ($2,297). (SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.g) In Applicant’s SOR
answer, he denied these allegations. IRS tax transcripts for tax years 2012 through 2021
were provided as part of the interrogatories. They substantiate Applicant owes the IRS
for each tax year as alleged. For tax years 2020 and 2021 the transcripts report that no
tax returns were filed, but he received a tax credit each year that was applied to balances
he owed. These were the tax credits that were authorized as part of the pandemic relief.
Applicant did not provide evidence that he has a payment agreement with the IRS
to satisfy his delinquent tax debts, and he did not provide proof of any payments towards
these  debts.  He  did  not  provide  any  documentary  evidence  of  action  he  has  taken  to
contact his creditors, verify his debts, and pay them.
In his interrogatories, Applicant stated that due to his wife’s health issues and the
COVID  pandemic  he  is  trying  to  get  back  on  top  of  things  and  that  was  why  he  was
working at his job. (Item 5)
Applicant’s  admissions  in  his  answer,  statement  to  a  government  investigator,
interrogatories,  tax  transcripts,  and  credit  reports  from  March  2023  and  June  2022,
support the SOR allegations. (Items 2-7)
Any  derogatory  information  that  was  not  alleged  will  not  be  considered  for
disqualifying  purposes  but  may  be  considered  in  applying  mitigating  conditions  and  in
whole-person analysis.
