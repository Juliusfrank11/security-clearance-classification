The  SOR alleges  eight  delinquent  accounts totaling  $27,181.  (SOR ¶¶  1.a  through
1.h) In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted  all allegations without explanation.
Applicant is 36-years old and has been employed by a defense contractor since
about September 2021. He served in the Army from June 2008 to about October 2020
and was honorably discharged as an E-6. He served as a missile operator and maintainer
and deployed overseas for more than four years. He has held a security clearance since
about 2008 without reported incident. (GE 1; Tr. 23-25, 59-62)
Applicant  completed  two  years  of  college.  He  married  in  December  2008,
separated from his then spouse in July 2015, and their divorce was finalized in April 2017.
He has two children with his former spouse, ages 14 and 10. (GE 1; Tr. 23-24, 58-60)
Applicant  attributes  his  financial  problems  to   his  divorce,   child   support,
underemployment, and  his  former  spouse’s  use  of  credit  cards,  issued  in  his name  and
intended   for  emergency  use,  which   she   used,   without  his  knowledge,   to   pay  for  her
apartment and  furnishings. He contested  debts his former spouse  charged  to  his credit
cards but  the  judge  in  the  divorce  proceedings ruled  against  him.  He had  also provided
his former spouse  with  a  General Power of Attorney.  He did not disclose  any  financial
problems, delinquent accounts,  or judgments  in  his March 2020  SCA.  He said that he  is
slowly paying  off his debts and  prioritized  paying  his smallest debts  first. (Tr. 36-44,  56-
65, 51, 85-88; GE 1  at 32-33, GE  7 at 8)
The evidence concerning the specific SOR allegations is summarized below.
SOR ¶  1.a: credit account  charged off for $7,145.  Credit reports dated from April
2020 to June 2023  show the credit card account was  an individual account opened or
assigned in March 2012, charged off for $7,145 in December 2017, and with a past due
balance of $7,145. The June 2023 credit report states consumer disputes this account.
In May 2020, Applicant told a government investigator this was his former spouse’s credit
card or a credit card they had for emergencies, that he had been trying to pay it off and
that he believed the balance had been reduced to about $1,780. (GE 2 at 7, GE 3 at 2,
GE 4 at 2, GE 5 at 18-19, GE 7 at 7)
Applicant testified that he called the creditor about a year before the hearing and
was told the account had been charged off and that they had taken a loss. He asked if
the debt had been sold to another creditor because he wanted to start paying it. He said
he was told that it had not been sold but he did not receive anything else from the creditor.
He did not report any unauthorized use  of the card. After the hearing he submitted an
email stating he had agreed to a settlement with the creditor and would resolve the debt
within a year. He also submitted an undated letter from the creditor, the same creditor
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b, to “confirm the payment arrangements agreed upon in our recent
telephone  conversation.  You  have  scheduled  payments  of  $298.00  to  begin  July  14,
2023[,] with subsequent payments scheduled for every 30 days.” (AE F) The letter did not
specify an account number or type of debt. He did not submit evidence of any payment
made under the arrangement. (Tr. 43-49, 63-73, 105-107; AE A, F)
SOR ¶  1.b: credit account  charged off for $6,322. Credit reports dated from April
2020 to June 2023 show this individual secured credit account was opened or assigned
in June 2016, charged off for $6,322, and with a past due balance of $6,322. In May 2020,
Applicant told a government investigator this was a motorcycle loan he could not afford
to pay after his divorce, that the motorcycle was repossessed and sold for more than he
owed, and that the debt was resolved. (GE 2 at 7, GE 3 at 2, GE 4 at 2, GE 5 at 19, GE
7 at 8)
Applicant  testified that he  spoke  with this creditor in late  2021  and  was told the
account had been charged off and that the motorcycle had not been sold. He said that
“after [creditor]  repossessed  the  motorcycle,  I have  never received, got a  single  notice
about  what  was  left  over,  the  remaining  balance  of  the  motorcycle,  if  they  sold  the
motorcycle. I didn’t receive any information from [creditor] about any of that.” (Tr. 73-74)
After  the  hearing  he  submitted  an  undated  letter  from  the  creditor,  the  same  creditor
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a, to “confirm the payment arrangements agreed upon in our recent
telephone  conversation.  You  have  scheduled  payments  of  $298.00  to  begin  July  14,
2023[,] with subsequent payments scheduled for every 30 days.” (AE F) The letter did not
specify an account number or type of debt. He did not submit evidence of any payment
made under the arrangement. (Tr. 43-49, 72-74, 105-107; AE A, F)
SOR ¶¶  1.c-1.d: student  loan accounts  in  collection for $4,028  and $3,760.
Credit reports from April 2020, September 2021, and January 2022 show these individual
student  loan  accounts  as  assigned  in  March  2017,  affected  by  a  natural  or  declared
disaster, and in collection for amounts varying from $4,028 to $4,279, and from $3,760 to
$3,994, respectively. A June 2023 credit report shows the accounts with current balances
of  $4,995  and  $4,663,  no  last  payment  date,  and  no  payment  due.  Applicant  told  a
government investigator these accounts were student loans and that he would address
the debts after resolving higher priority debts. He testified that both loans were under his
name but said that one was for his former spouse, that he had obtained the loans in about
2008, and that he made payments until about 2012 when he experienced some financial
difficulties  and  stopped  making  payments.  He  said  the  loans  were  deferred  or  in
forbearance for about six months and that he had not made a payment on the loans since
about 2014. He had not contacted the creditor from 2014 until about a week prior to the
hearing when he started working with the creditor to consolidate the loans into a single
loan  of  about  $8,000  or  $8,700.  He  did  not  submit  documentary  evidence  of  a  loan
consolidation agreement or of any payment made thereunder. (Tr. 33, 49-50, 77-85; GE
2 at 9, GE 3 at 2-3, GE 4 at 2-3, GE 5 at 20, GE 7 at 7)
SOR ¶ 1.e: credit collection account for $1,580. Credit reports from April 2020,
June  2021,  January  2022,  and  June  2023  show  this  individual  credit  account  was
assigned in July 2017, and in collection for $1,580. The June 2023 credit report reflected
that  he  disputed  the  account  information.  In  May  2020,  Applicant  told  a  government
investigator he was unaware of this account and would investigate and attempt to resolve
the debt after taking care of other debts. He testified that he had not communicated with
the creditor from 2017 until about May 2023 and said that he planned to pay this debt. He
said his former spouse used the credit card without his knowledge. After the hearing, he
submitted evidence that he made a payment of $500 on June 15, 2023, and said he would
pay the debt off the next month. (Tr. 32, 50-52, 85-91; GE 2 at 7, GE 3 at 3, GE 4 at 3,
GE 5 at 20, AE A, C)
SOR ¶  1.f: credit account  charged off for $1,017.  Credit reports from April 2020,
June 2021, January 2022, and June 2023 show this individual credit  card account was
opened or assigned in May 2016, charged off for $1,017, and with a past due balance of
$1,017. The June 2023 credit report notes that he disputed the account.  In May 2020,
Applicant  told  a  government  investigator  he  was  unaware  of  this  account  and  that  he
would  investigate  and  attempt  to  resolve  the  debt  after  taking  care  of  other  debts.  He
testified that he  had not communicated with the creditor from 2017 until May 2023  but
was confused because he had multiple credit cards with this creditor and would have to
contact them to determine account status. After the hearing, he submitted evidence he
paid this debt on June 15, 2023. (Tr. 32-33, 53-54, 91-98; GE 2 at 5, GE 3 at 3, GE 4 at
3, GE 5 at 21; AE A, B)
SOR ¶ 1.g: credit account charged off for $456. Credit reports from April 2020,
June 2021, and January 2022 show this individual credit card account was assigned in
August 2015, charged off for $456 in June 2017, and with a balance of $456. This account
is  not  listed  in  a  June  2023  credit  report.  In  May  2020,  Applicant  told  a  government
investigator he was unaware of this account and would investigate, and, if liable, would
attempt to resolve it. He testified that he paid this debt in about December 2022, that it
had  been  removed  from  his  credit  report,  and  that  he  could  provide  documentary
evidence. He had multiple credit cards with this creditor and said he would have to contact
the creditor to determine the account status. He did not submit documentary evidence the
debt was paid. (Tr. 32, 53-54, 91-99; GE 3 at 3, GE 4 at 3, GE 5 at 21, GE 7 at 8)
SOR ¶  1.h: past due child support in the  approximate amount  of  $2,873. An
April  2020  credit  report  shows  this  account  as  in  dispute,  past  due  in  the  amount  of
$7,742, and with a balance of $7,771. A June 2021 credit report shows this account as
past due in the amount of $4,280, and with a balance of $5,190. A January 2022 credit
report shows this account as past due in the amount of $2,873, and with a balance of
$2,876. A June 2023 credit report shows this account as current since about March 2022,
and with a balance of $157. In September 2021, a state court amended an involuntary
withholding  order  (IWO)  because  he  was  in  arrears  for  more  than  12  weeks.  The
amended IWO required him to pay $1,060 per month in child support including $160 to
be applied towards arrearages. (GE 6) He testified that he regularly paid his child support
obligations  but  said  that  he  missed  a  payment  when  transitioning  from  the  Army.  He
submitted documentary evidence of payments on this debt since May 2018 and that this
debt was no longer past due. This allegation is resolved for Applicant. (Tr. 26-31, 36-43,
99-104, 113-115; GE 2 at 5, GE 3 at 3-4, GE 4 at 3-4, GE 5 at 3; AE D)
Applicant’s  financial  circumstances  have  improved.  In  January  2023,  the
Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) determined that he was 100% disabled and he has
received monthly disability payments of about $3,400 since. His net pay from his job is
about $1,700 every two weeks after child support payments are withheld pursuant to an
IWO. His monthly rent is about $1,550 and his truck payment is $600 per month. He has
about  $780  in  the  bank  and  said  he  may  have  a  401K  retirement  account  with  his
employer but was not sure. The only past due debts shown in a June 2023 credit report
are accounts alleged in the SOR. (GE 2) (Tr. 25-34, 52, 63, 108-109; GE 6)
In  May 2021, he  financed  the  purchase  of a  2020 model year pick-up  truck  with  a
$41,909  loan. He has made  monthly payments of $600  since  and  had  reduced  the  loan
balance to  $32,616,  as  of  June  1,  2023. In  April 2023, he  purchased  a motorcycle  with a
$25,998  loan. He characterized  this  as “a  dumb  . . .  spur of  the  moment purchase.” (Tr.
110) He said he  had  made  one  payment on  the  loan  before the  hearing  but did not provide
documentary evidence. (Tr. 33-35, 55-56, 74-77, 110; GE 2 at 7-8,  GE 3 at 4, GE  4 at 5)
Applicant received financial counseling while in the Army in about 2020, and said
he  maintains  an  unwritten  budget  in  his  head.  He  does  not  gamble  or  take  vacations.
During the hearing Applicant was informed of the importance of providing documentary
evidence of debt payments, contact with creditors, and efforts to address or resolve his
delinquent debts. (Tr. 54-57, 67-73, 98-102, 112-113)
