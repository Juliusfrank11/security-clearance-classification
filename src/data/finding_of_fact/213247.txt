Applicant,  43,  applied  for  access  to  classified  information  in  June  2022.  On  the
security  clearance  application,  she  indicated  that  she  had  not  been  previously
investigated for or granted security clearance eligibility or access. However, in February
2015,  she  applied  for  public  trust  eligibility  in  connection  with  her  work  on  a  federal
contract.  It  is  unclear  if  the  public  trust  eligibility  application  was  adjudicated  to
completion. (GE 3,5)
On  the  February  2015  public  trust  application,  she  responded  to  ‘Section  14:
Illegal Drug  Use,’  that she had not  used, possessed, supplied, or manufactured illegal
drugs  in  the  last  year.  (GE  5)  On  her  June  2022  security  clearance  application,  she
disclosed in response to ‘Section 23: Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity,’ that her first
use  of marijuana occurred  in  May  1998  and her last  use  occurred in  November 2021.
She  provided  the  following  information  about  the  nature,  frequency,  and  number  of
times she used the drug:
2018-2020:  The  recent  use  of  marijuana  was  once  a  month,  on  a
weekend, over a span of two years, starting around 2018 purchased from
a dispensary in [City 1].
2020-2021:  Since  2020,  I  had  two  small  occurrences  with  an  old  friend.
Since then, I have had nothing.
1998-2002:  Before  that,  I  had  a  very  long  break  of  ever  using  since
college. I smoked marijuana in college and stopped before graduation as I
was becoming a certified teacher.  (GE 3)
Applicant’s  employment  disclosures  start  in  2012.  She  worked  on  a  federal
contract between January 2015 and October 2018. Between October 2108 and October
2020,  she  worked  as  a  science  specialist  at  school.  With  respect  to  her  future  use  of
marijuana, she disclosed  that she  did not  “condone  this drug  anymore.” She no longer
considered  the  drug  good  for her personal health. She  also indicated  that she  stopped
using the  drug in 2020  with the intent and  the  goal to work  for the government.  (GE 3)
A  background  investigator  interviewed  Applicant  twice  in  July  2022.  In  the  first
interview,  she  confirmed  the  disclosures  on  her  June  2022  security  clearance
application as correct. She explained that she used marijuana because she saw it as a
healthier  alternative  to  relieve  stress  as  compared  to  alcohol,  and  because  it  was
becoming legal in the state where she lived. In the second interview, she indicated her
family and friends were aware of her marijuana use and that it could not be used as a
point of exploitation or vulnerability. She also stated her intent to abstain from marijuana
use  in  the  future,  and  that  she  no  longer  associated  with  individuals  who  used  illegal
drugs.  She  did  not  make  any  changes  or correction  to  her prior  disclosures  about  her
history of illegal drug use. (GE 4)
The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  used  marijuana  between  May  1998  and
November  2021,  as  she  disclosed  on  her  June  2022  security  clearance  application.
(SOR  ¶  2.a)  The  SOR  also  alleges  that  she  intentionally  falsified  her  February  2015
application for public trust eligibility by stating that she had not used illegal drugs within
the year of the application. (SOR ¶ 1.a) She denied both allegations, explaining that she
did not use marijuana in the year before she completed the public trust application. She
also  explained  that  her  disclosures  about  her  drug  use  on  the  security  clearance
application lacked specificity. She offered that she used the drug between 1998 to 2002,
and  again  between  2018  to  2020.  She  explained  that  her  use  was  infrequent  and  for
spiritual and creative purposes for her yoga and art practices. She also indicated, for the
first  time,  that  the  period  of  marijuana  use  she  disclosed  also  had  long  period  of
abstinence, from 2002 to 2017 and again from 2020 to 2022. (GE 1-2)
