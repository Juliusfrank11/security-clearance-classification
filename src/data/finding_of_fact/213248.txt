Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.j and 1.n-1.o, and he denied ¶¶ SOR 1.k-1.m.
He is 43 years old. He is not married, and he does not have children. He graduated from
high school in 1999. He attended a community college from 2001 to 2006 and earned an
associate degree. He then attended a university from 2009 to November 2013 and earned
a  bachelor’s  degree  in  computer  information  science.  He  owned  a  home  from  around
2010  to  2018,  but  he  was  living  with  a  family  member  as  of  the  date  of  the  hearing.
(Answer; Tr. at 6-8, 22-23, 25, 32, 44, 70; GE 1)
From  2006  to  the  summer of 2014, Applicant  worked  as a  server at  a  restaurant.
He  then   briefly  worked   for  a   software   company  for  four  months   until  the   company
downsized  in December 2014. He subsequently worked  various temporary jobs, started
his own cleaning  service  for several months,  and  worked  part time  for a  tax preparation
service  from  December 2014  to  April 2015. From  April 2015  to  June  2019  and  October
2019  to  March 2020, he  worked  for two  companies,  both  DOD contractors. He was laid
off  and  unemployed  until July 2021, when  he  began  working  for his employer, another
DOD contractor.  He  was first granted  a  security clearance  in  2015. (Tr. at  5,  22-24,  32-
35, 38-42; GE 1-4)
The SOR alleged that Applicant had 10 delinquent federal student loans, totaling
$68,747.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.j) It  also  alleged  that  he  had  three  unpaid  judgments,  totaling
$2,859, entered against him in 2012, 2014, and 2019. (SOR -1.m). It also alleged that he
failed to file his federal and state income tax returns for tax years (TY) 2016, 2017, and
2018. (SOR ¶¶ 1.n-1.o) The SOR allegations are established by Applicant’s admissions
in  his  Answer;  his  April  2020  security  clearance  application  (SCA);  his  responses  to
interrogatories  from  September  2020,  March  2021,  and  April  2021;  court  records;  and
credit  bureau  reports  from  December  2019,  June  2020,  May  2021,  and  May  2022.
(Answer; GE 1-9)
Applicant took out student loans to attend college for his bachelor’s degree from
2009 to 2013. He took some time off in 2010 to purchase a $90,000 home. He lived there
when he  returned  to school to  obtain  his degree  and  he  intended to  later use  it  as an
investment  property.  He  made  his  first  payment  towards  his  student  loans  before
graduation.  In  approximately  2012  or  2013,  he  began  experiencing  financial  problems
when he faced discrimination at his restaurant job after certain managers cut his hours,
assigned him to bad sections, and did “things that would hinder me making money . . . .”
His pay decreased by approximately 30% and he fell behind on his mortgage. He moved
out of his home and in with his father for eight months in the summer of 2013. This affected
his ability to receive his mail, to include student loan and tax documentation. He continued
to incur utility expenses for his home. When his student loans became due in May 2014,
he was unable to pay them despite obtaining deferments for three-to-six-month periods
on  several  occasions  in  2014  and  2015.  From  the  summer  of  2014  to  April  2015,  as
previously discussed, he was underemployed, and he incurred approximately $4,000 in
self-employment-related expenses for his cleaning service. In around 2014 or 2015, the
mortgage creditor thought he abandoned  his home. It went into foreclosure  in 2017 or
2018 and he did not owe a deficiency balance. (Tr. at 14-15, 22-44, 56-58; GE 1-4, 6-10)
Applicant’s  wages were garnished in the amount of $1,000 monthly  by the U.S.
Department of Education (DoE) from October 2019 to March 2020 for his student loans.
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.j)  In the summer of 2022, he completed documentation in an attempt to
set up an income-based repayment plan with the DoE, and he made two payments to the
DoE of $150 each in December 2022. He did not receive a response. He understood that
he did not have to pay his student loans during the COVID-19 payment pause. In July
2023,  he  agreed  to  long-term  payment  arrangements  with  the  DoE,  his  student  loans
were transferred to a new loan servicer, and they were no longer in default status. The
most recent credit bureau report from July 2023 reflects that while these student loans
continue to have outstanding balances, they were no longer reported as delinquent, and
they were scheduled to go to a positive status by December 2024. (Tr. at 44-49, 65-67;
GE 1-4, 9-10; AE A)
SOR  ¶  1.k  is  a  $2,576  judgment  entered  against  Applicant  by  a  property
management company in 2019.  He contracted with the company in 2017 for a term of
one or two years to obtain renters for his home. The company found renters for a six-
month period and then he elected to “just get the house back to the mortgage.” He did
not believe he owed the company, and he was unaware of the judgment until he received
the SOR. He then immediately telephoned the company to inquire about the judgment,
but  he  was  not  given  an  explanation.  In  late  2022,  the  court that  issued  the  judgment
garnished  his  wages  for  $3,100.  Court  records  reflect  that  Applicant  satisfied  this
judgment in March 2023. (Tr. at 49-55, 67-70, 72-73; GE 1-2, 5, 11)
SOR  ¶¶  1.l  and  1.m  are  for  judgments  entered  against  Applicant  by  a  city
treasurer’s  office  in  the  amounts  of  $59  and  $224,  in  2012  and  2014,  respectively, for
property taxes related to his home.  These debts are established by court records, and
they  are  not  reported  on  any  of  the  credit  reports.  Applicant  stated  that  he  paid  these
debts. (Tr. at 55-56; GE 5)
Applicant filed his federal income tax returns for TY 2016, 2017, and 2018 in 2021,
and he owed $820, $750, and $385 respectively, which he paid when he filed. He believed
he filed his state income tax returns for those tax years at the same as his federal income
tax returns, but he acknowledged that he had not yet done so as of the date of the hearing.
He did not believe he owed any state taxes for those tax years. In July 2023, he stated
that he filed these state income tax returns in person with the state tax authority. (SOR
¶¶ 1.n-1.o; Tr. at 48, 56-61; GE 2-4; AE A)
Applicant  earned  approximately  $60,000  annually  from  October  2019  to  March
2020 and $50,000 annually from April 2015 to June 2019. As of the date of the hearing
and since July 2021, his annual income was approximately $80,000. He stated that his
total monthly income and monthly net remainder was $2,300 since he began residing with
a  family  member, and  he  had  $22,000  in  his  joint  checking  and  savings  accounts.  He
therefore  had  the  financial  means  to  pay  his  student  loans.  He  stated that  he filed  his
income tax returns for TY 2019 through 2022 and he did now owe any taxes for those tax
years. As of the date of the hearing, he had been working with a credit repair company
since approximately April 2023 to dispute debts on his behalf and he was monitoring his
credit through a credit monitoring service, but he had not received credit counseling. His
most recent credit report, from July 2023 only reflects one minor delinquent debt. (Tr. at
33, 35, 38-42, 59-64, 69-72; GE 1-4, 10; AE A)
