Applicant,  29,  has  worked  for  his  current  employer,  a  federal  contracting
company,  as  a  laborer  since  February  2019.  He  completed  a  security  clearance
application,  his  first,  in  October  2019.  He  disclosed  five  delinquent  accounts  totaling
$15,783.  The  ensuing  investigation  revealed  four  additional  delinquent  accounts.  The
SOR alleges that he owes $30,638 on nine delinquent accounts. (GE 1,3, 5-9)
Applicant  discussed  the  origins  of  his  financial  problems  in  his  first  subject
interview  on  December  9,  2019.  He  explained  that  he  incurred  the  debts  financing  a
move  from  State  1  to  State  2  with  his  girlfriend  when  she  began  attending  school  in
State 2 in 2016. He accumulated the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.f ($1,230) 1.g ($2,413),
and 1.h ($1,727) to pay for the airfare required for the move as well items needed to set
up  a  new  residence.  In  2017,  he  took  out  a  personal  loan  as  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.b
($3,570) to finance a vacation. (GE 9)
After  the  move,  he  became  the  sole  source  of  income  for  himself  and  his
girlfriend because she was a full-time student. He did not earn enough to pay their living
expenses and repay the debt he incurred. He claimed to have resolved two debts with
the same creditor identified in SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d. On December 17, 2019, he provided
the  investigator  with  receipt  for  two  paid  accounts.  Because  the  account  numbers
reported  on  the  receipts  do  not  match  the  account  numbers  in  the  credit  reports  in
evidence, it is unclear if the debts are duplicate accounts. He also told the investigator
that he resolved SOR ¶ 1.i, but he could not provide any corroborating documentation.
(GE 5,9)
In  response  to  DOD  interrogatories  about  the  status  of  his  delinquent  debts,
Applicant indicated that he had payment arrangements in place for the debts alleged in
SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b,  1.c,  1.f,  1.g,  and  1.i.  However,  he  did  not  provide  any  details  of  the
payment  arrangements  and  he  did  not  provide  any  receipts  of  payment.  The  credit
reports in the record do not show decreases in balances that would be consistent with
payment plans for SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.f, and 1.g. The debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d,
and 1.i do not appear on the August 2023 credit report, which is the most recent report
in the record. (GE 4-9)
In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  reported  that  he  was going  to  work on  the
debts  through  a  “credit  mentor.”  He  did  not  offer  any  details  of  the  mentorship
arrangement or details of a plan to resolve his delinquent accounts. (GE 2)
