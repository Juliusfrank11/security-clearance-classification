(Item 2)
SOR ¶ 1.a alleged that Applicant used marijuana and other products containing
tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) with varying frequency from about March 2013 to about June
2023.  SOR  ¶  1.b  alleged  that  Applicant  purchased  marijuana  and  other  products
containing THC from about February 2023 until about June 2023. He admitted both SOR
allegations. His  SOR admissions are incorporated  as findings of fact. After a  thorough
review of the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:
In his answers to Section 23 (Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity) of his December
2022 security clearance application, Applicant disclosed that he illegally used marijuana
with varying frequency between March 2013 and July 2021. (Item 3 at 44) He described
his illegal marijuana use as follows:
I smoked marijuana a few times in college. It is not illegal in [state where I
currently live] but illegal in [state] where I went to school. (Item 3 at 44)
I had a year in high school where I used it frequently. And now I probably
use it twice a year. (Id.)
On February 13, 2023, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator conducting
his background investigation.  In response to DOHA interrogatories dated July 18, 2023,
he reviewed a summary of the interview and indicated that he found it to be accurate after
adding  some  additional  information.  During  the  background  investigation  interview,  he
was  questioned  about  his  illegal  use  of  marijuana.  He  indicated  that  his  last  use  of
marijuana was in February 2023, after he completed his security clearance application in
December 2022. From March 2013 to July 2021, Applicant did not purchase marijuana.
He  obtained  marijuana  from  his  friends.  He  began  using  marijuana  again  in  February
2023. He purchased marijuana from a dispensary. Marijuana is legal in the state where
he currently resides. He began using marijuana again because he is around friends who
smoke marijuana, and it is legal. He is willing to stop smoking marijuana if it affects his
security clearance. He told the investigator that he will likely use marijuana in the future.
(Item 4)
In his July 2023, interrogatory responses, Applicant indicated that the last time he
used marijuana was on June 10, 2023, but he no longer uses marijuana. (Item 4 at 3) In
his response to the SOR, Applicant indicated that a lot of his mistakes occurred when he
was  young  and  immature.  He  has  since  matured  and  become  more  responsible.  He
believes he can contribute to his country and community. (Item 2)
