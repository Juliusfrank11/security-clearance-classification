After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  the  Government’s
exhibits, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  42  years  old,  has  never  been  married,  and  has  an  adult  daughter.
From June 2007 to October 2016, he lived in a home he owned with his then girlfriend
(who became his fiancée). After they broke up in October 2016, she bought him out in
January 2020. Since October 2016, he has lived with a cohabitant. Since March 2018, he
has worked for a federal contractor. He has been employed full time by federal contractors
since October 2001. (Items 3 and 5.)
Under  Guideline  F,  the  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant:  (1)  is  delinquent  on  eight
consumer debts totaling $45,655; (2) is indebted to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
for $21,768 in unpaid taxes for tax years 2012 through 2015; (3) is indebted to his state
for $3,607 in unpaid taxes for tax year 2016; (4) failed to file federal income tax returns
for tax years 2016 through 2021, and; (5) failed to file his state income tax returns for tax
years 2016 through 2021. (Item 1.) He admitted all allegations (except SOR ¶ 1.g), with
explanations that will be discussed below. (Item 2.)
In  his  Answer,  Applicant  said  he  planned  to  retire  some  of  his  debts  once  he
received a lump sum payout from his pension fund. (Item 2, SOR ¶¶ 1a., 1.d, 1.m, 1.n,
and 1.o.) He did not explain when he might receive that payout. He failed to file state and
federal tax returns, because he knew he owed taxes and could not afford to pay them.
(Item 2, SOR ¶¶ 1.n, 1.o.) His personal subject interview (PSI) reported that his debts
were not tied to events beyond his control. (Item 5 at 14.)
His  personal  financial  statement  (PFS)  reported:  total  net  monthly  Income  of
$4,330; total monthly expenses of $1,645, and actual monthly expense payments of $573.
His monthly net remainder is $2,112.
In response to interrogatories, Applicant stated:
In  2016,  my  [fiancée]  and  I  ended  our  relationship  and  due  to  the
extent of our bad relationship I chose to move out. I was still responsible to
pay half of the bills in the house we purchased together. I found a roommate
and had to pay half of the bills where I was staying. In addition to those bills,
I was making payments to the IRS. I was concerned that if I filed my taxes
right  away  and  I  owed  money,  I  wouldn’t  be  able  to  afford  to  make  the
payments.  My  money  was  stretched  thin,  my  ex-[fiancée]  successfully
applied and was approved for a mortgage loan to solely purchase the house
[in 2020], I no longer have to pay bills in my prior residence so I can now
file my taxes and pay off current debt. (Item 4 at 12.)
Consumer Debts
SOR  ¶  1.a   is a 2020 charged  off  auto loan for $17,673. Applicant admitted  this
debt, and his PSI reported that he is paying $300 per month. (Item 2; Item 5 at 12; Item
7 at 2; Item 8 at 2.) He did not document prior payments or the current status of the debt.
This debt is unresolved.
SOR ¶  1.b is a  2020  charged  off credit  card for $11,250.  Applicant admitted  this
debt, and  his PSI reported  that he  was making  payments.  His most recent credit report
(8/21/23) states “paying  under a  partial payment agreement” with  the  last  payment in July
2023. (Item  2; Item 5  at 12; Item  6 at 6.) This debt is being resolved.
SOR  ¶   1.c  is a   2020  charged   off   credit  card   for $5,655.  Applicant  admitted   this
debt, and  his PSI reported  that he  was making  payments.  His most recent credit report
(8/21/23) states “paying  under a  partial payment agreement” with  the  last  payment in July
2023. (Item  2; Item 5  at 12; Item  6 at 5, 6.) This debt is being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.d is a 2020 charged off personal loan for $4,690. Applicant admitted this
debt with  plans to  pay it once  he  receives his  pension  payout.  (Item  2.) Applicant’s PSI
reported  that he  was  making  payments on  this  debt.  (Item  5  at 12.)  His most recent credit
reports, however, show  the  same  balance  as  previous credit reports with  the  last payment
made in  October 2017. (Item 6  at 7; Item 7  at 3; Item 8  at 2.) This debt is unresolved.
SOR ¶ 1.e is a 2020 charged off personal loan for $4,681. Applicant admitted this
debt with  plans to  pay it once  he  receives his  pension  payout.  (Item  2.) Applicant’s PSI
reported  that he  was  making  payments on  this  debt.  (Item  5  at 12.)  His most recent credit
reports, however, show  the  same  balance  as  previous credit reports with  the  last payment
made in  October 2017. (Item 6  at 6; Item 7  at 3; Item 8  at 2.) This debt is unresolved.
SOR ¶  1.f  is a 2022 charged off account for $1,005. Applicant admitted this debt
with plans to pay it once he receives his pension payout. (Item 2.) This debt is unresolved.
SOR ¶  1.g is a credit card that went into collection in 2019 for $525.  Applicant
denied this allegation and claimed it was paid in full. (Item 2.) He provided documents
showing  payments  of  $50  and  $75  on  November  27,  2022,  and  December  11,  2022,
respectively. (Item 4 at 14, 17.) But the latest document he produced still shows a balance
of $525 on November 29, 2022. (Item 4 at 15.) This debt is unresolved.
SOR  ¶   1.h   is  a  credit  card  that  became  past  due  in  2022  for  $714.  Applicant
admitted this account and claimed that he has a payment arrangement to settle the full
balance.  His  most  recent  credit  report  shows  a  somewhat  higher  balance  than  the
previous  credit  report.  (Item  6  at  9;  Item  7  at  3.)  He  did  not  provide  any  documents
showing a payment arrangement. This debt is unresolved.
The most recent credit report shows delinquent accounts not alleged in the SOR.
There are two charged off accounts for $821 and $2,382. (Item 6 at 4, 8.) And there are
three past due accounts totaling $499. (Item 6 at 5, 9.)
Tax Delinquencies
Applicant admitted owing federal income taxes for tax years 2012 through 2015
and failing to file federal income tax returns for tax years 2016 through 2021. He stated
that he was currently making payments to the IRS (Item 2.)
Applicant explained that in 2016, he and his then fiancée broke up. He moved out
of the house they owned together. He found another roommate, but that meant he had to
pay half of his fiancée’s bills and half of his new roommate’s bills. Money was tight. He
failed  to  file  tax  returns,  because  he  knew  he  owed  taxes  and  was  already  making
payments to the IRS. (Item 4 at 12.)
Applicant provided IRS tax transcripts for tax years 2012 through 2015 in both his
interrogatory responses. (Item 4 at 26-31; Item 5 at 18-23.) Those show some payments
made, but the last payment is for tax year 2015 made on December 3, 2021 ($365). (Item
5 at 23.) The Payment Detail he provided dated December 5, 2021, shows four payments
from September 13, 2021, to September 12, 2022, with the latest payment made for tax
year 2014 on January 5, 2022. (Item 4 at 24.) Contrary to his Answer, there is no evidence
history  of  timely  payments  being  made  on  his  federal  tax  debt.  These  debts  are
unresolved.
Applicant admitted owing his state income taxes for tax year 2016 and  failing to
file his federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2016 through 2021. (Item 2.) His
plan is to file these returns and pay his taxes once he receives his lump sum pension
buyout.  (Item  2.)  The  record  shows  these  issues  have  not  been  addressed  and  are
unresolved.
Law and Policies
It is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the
Supreme Court has noted, “the clearly consistent standard indicates that security
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.” Department of the Navy
v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).
When   evaluating   an   applicant’s   suitability  for   a   security  clearance,   the
administrative judge  must consider the  adjudicative  guidelines. These  guidelines, which
are flexible  rules of law, apply together with  common  sense  and  the  general factors of the
whole-person  concept.  The  administrative  judge  must consider all  available and  reliable
information  about  the  person,  past and  present,  favorable and  unfavorable, in making  a
decision.  The   protection   of   the   national  security  is  the   paramount   consideration.   AG  ¶
2(b)  requires  that   “[a]ny  doubt  concerning   personnel  being   considered   for  national
security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.”
Under Directive ¶  E3.1.14, the  Government must present evidence  to  establish
controverted   facts   alleged   in   the   SOR.   Under  Directive   ¶   E3.1.15,   the   applicant   is
responsible  for presenting  “witnesses and  other evidence  to  rebut,  explain,  extenuate, or
mitigate  facts admitted  by applicant or proven  by Department Counsel. . . .” The  applicant
has the  ultimate  burden of persuasion in seeking a  favorable security decision.
