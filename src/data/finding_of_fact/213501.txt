Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. He is 32 years old. He is not married
and does not have children. He graduated from high school in 2009 and attended college
from 2009 to 2013 but did not earn a degree. He worked for various private companies
until December 2016, when he began working for his current employer, a DOD contractor.
He started as a pipefitter; he became in rigger in 2017; he worked in quality insurance in
February 2020; he became an inspector in May 2021; and he was promoted to supervisor
in December 2022. He started his own part-time business as a custom fishing lure painter

The SOR alleged that Applicant had eight delinquent federal student loans, totaling
$40,272.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.h)  The  SOR  allegations  are  established  by  Applicant’s
admissions  in  his  Answer;  background  interviews  conducted  by  an  authorized  DOD
investigator in March 2019 and  May 2022; and a  credit bureau report from  April 2022.
(GE 1, 3-5)
Applicant  took  out  student  loans  in  2009  to  attend  college.  His  minimal  income
affected his ability to make consistent payments toward his loans when they became due
in  2013  but  acknowledged  that  he  also  did  not  prioritize  paying  due  to  his  youth.  He
obtained deferments and forbearances on two or three occasions. He has not made any
payments since he began working for his employer in 2016. His attempts to negotiate a
repayment plan with the creditor in around 2019, to include one that was income based,
were  unsuccessful  because  he  could  not  afford  the  creditor’s  proposed  payments  of
between $500 and $800 monthly. He last contacted the creditor to verify that he did not
have to pay his student loans during the COVID-19 payment pause. He also suffered a
work-related injury between 2020 and 2021 that caused him to be  out of work for one
month.  He  indicated  during  his  May  2022  background  interview  that  he  intended  to
contact the creditor once the pause was lifted to negotiate a repayment plan. He stated
at the hearing that he had not yet found the time to do so, primarily because of his work
schedule, but he intended to. He also stated that he found it to be an overwhelming task.
(Tr. at 13-14, 22-24, 30-38, 45-47, 49-53, 59-61; GE 2-4)
Applicant earned approximately $30,000 when he began working for his employer.
His income steadily increased over the years, and his annual salary as a supervisor is
$84,400,  with  the opportunity  to  earn more  with  overtime  and  shift  differential.  He had
approximately $2,980 in his checking and savings accounts and $44,000 in his retirement
savings account. He and his girlfriend split the rent and utilities. He anticipated earning a
profit from his part-time business in 2024. He planned to  apply his increased earnings
and his profit from his part-time business to resolve his outstanding student loans. He has
not received credit counseling. His 2022 credit report does not reflect any other delinquent
debts. (Answer; Tr. at 13-14, 24, 24-32, 38-50, 52-53, 60-61; GE 3, 5)
