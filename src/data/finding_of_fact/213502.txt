Applicant  is  a  57-year-old  master  technician  employed  by  a  defense  contractor
since  February  1988.  He  seeks  to  retain  his  Secret  security  clearance  which  is  a
requirement of his continued employment. At the time of his hearing he had successfully
held a clearance for 34 years. (Tr. 13-20) Applicant’s senior security manager submitted
a February 13, 2023 email confirming that Applicant had no reported security violations.
He  further  added  that  Applicant  mentors  and  trains  company  employees  to  remain
security compliant. (Tr. 79-80; AE E)
Applicant  graduated  from  high  school  in  June  1984.  He  was  awarded  an
associate  of  applied  science  degree  in  electronics  in  June  1988.  (Tr.  20-22;  GE  1)  He
did  not  serve  in  the  U.S.  armed  forces.  Applicant  has  never  married  and  has  no
dependents. (Tr. 22-23)

Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  DUI  in  October  2019.  The  September  and
October 2019 DUIs were apparently adjudicated together. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a – 1.i)
These allegations are established by Applicant’s  April 27, 2021 SF-86; his Office
of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  Report  of  Investigation  (ROI),  Personal  Subject
Interview  (PSI)  conducted  on  July  21,  2021  with  follow-on  contact;  his  OPM  ROI  PSI

September  22,  2022;  his  October  26,  2022  SOR  Answer  in  which  he  admitted  all
allegations; and his hearing testimony. (GE 1 -14; SOR Answer; Tr.)
Applicant  provided   evidence   that   the   1983   and  1986  alcohol-related   incidents   in
State   A   were   actually   citations,   not  arrests.   On   these   two   occasions,   Applicant  was
pulled   over  for  speeding   and   the   police   discovered   that  he   was  underage   and
transporting  alcohol.   (Tr. 23-26) Applicant could not  recall  many  details about  his  earlier
1988, 1996, and  1997  DUIs;  however, he  does not  dispute  that  they occurred.  (Tr. 27-
32)
Applicant does recall spending 180 days in a work-release program following his
2000  DUI  arrest.  At  the  time  of  his  2000  DUI  arrest,  he  was  on  probation  for  his  prior
DUIs.  After  his  1997  DUI,  he  stopped  drinking  for  about  nine  months,  but  returned  to
drinking,  “but  cut  back,”  and  “drank  to  intoxication  three  to  four  times  a  year”  until  his
2000  DUI.  (Tr.  32-34;  GE  13)  Applicant  did  not  participate  in  any  voluntary  substance
abuse  counseling treatment  between  his 1997  DUI  and  2000  DUI.  After his 2006  DUI,
he participated in a “work program” that lasted approximately three months. (Tr. 34-35;
GE 5) In between DUIs, Applicant had a history of stopping and resuming drinking. (Tr.
35-39; GE 8, GE 9)
Up  until  2019,  Applicant  had   accumulated   five   DUI   arrests.   In   2019,  he   was
arrested  for DUI  in September  with  a  .28 BAC.  Two weeks later, he was arrested for DUI
in October 2019  with  a  .32  BAC.  After these  two back-to-back  DUI  arrests  Applicant had
an “epiphany”  that he  had  a  drinking  problem. Before  his September DUI,  he  has gone
home  to  celebrate  his  mother’s  95th  birthday and  he  stated  that experience  had  taken  an
emotional  toll   on   him.   He  started   drinking   three   to   six  beers  a   day  typically  at   home.
However,  he   was  drinking   at  a   bar  before  his   September   DUI   and   attempted   to   drive
home.   (Tr.  39-42,   64-65)   It   appears that   his   September and   October 2019   DUI arrests
were   merged   and   adjudicated   together.   He   pleaded   guilty  and   was  sentenced   to   five
years  of  unsupervised   probation,  a   $1,600   fine,  and   ordered   to   attend   an   enhanced
offender’s course.  This class consisted  of  a  nine-month  treatment  program  from  July 2,
2021  to  May  2, 2022,  for which  he  received  a  certificate  of completion.  (Tr. 42-45,  61-63;
GE 4; AE H)
On the recommendation of his attorney, before his September and October 2019
DUI arrests were adjudicated, Applicant enrolled in an Intensive Outpatient Program. He
was formally admitted to the program on January 29, 2020, with a primary diagnosis of
alcohol  dependence,  in  remission,  and  was  successfully  discharged  on  April  3,  2020.
Before  Applicant  was  discharged,  his  Program  developed  a  treatment  plan  which
provided  Applicant  “will  continue  to  use  good  coping  skills  to  manage  his  triggers  and
prepare  for  discharge,”  that  he  “will  continue  to  check  in  with  his  sponsor  and  use  his
sober  support  system  to  manage  his  daily  life  stressors,”  and  he  “will  attend  groups,
meet with psychiatrist and prepare for discharge by using his coping skills. Tx team will
provide education, support and feedback as needed.” (Tr.46-48, 68-71; GE 4(a))
Applicant  has   a   sobriety  date   of   October   7,  2019,   and   he   has   not  had   a   drink
since  – “[t]hree  years, four months, and  16  days”  as of  the  date  of his hearing. (Tr. 45,
56)  Applicant acknowledged  that he  is an  alcoholic  and  that  if he  drinks one  drink, it will
lead   to   drinking  more.   As  an   alcoholic,  he   understands  he   cannot  drink  anything.  He
realized  that  with  the  increases  in his  DUI BAC levels and  progression  of  his alcoholism,
“the   next  step   is  death   inevitably.”   (Tr.  46,  56)  Both   of   Applicant’s  parents  were
alcoholics.  Alcohol  was  prevalent  in  every  family  event  or  function.  His  father  passed
away  “about  20   years   ago”   and   died   of  cirrhosis  and   liver  cancer.  His  mother  passed
away in October 2022.  (Tr. 66-67)
To  maintain  sobriety,  Applicant  attends  AA  meetings  every  day  and  submitted
documentation  of  such  attendance.  Additionally,  he  not  only  leads  meetings,  but  also
serves as secretary at meetings. Having admitted he is an alcoholic, Applicant considers
his condition to be a mental disease, “in the respect that I can – I can justify drinking in
my head for just about any reason. And unless – unless I recognize my disease, it will –
it will be all-encompassing and take over my life. I don’t know where else to go with that.
I don’t know what else to say on that.” (Tr. 46, 63, 65-66; AE I)
Applicant  has  been  actively  participating  with  AA  since  October  2019  to  the
present. During the COVID pandemic, there were no in-person AA meetings; however,
Applicant and another AA member started their own Zoom AA meeting. Applicant leads
that  meeting  consisting  of  15  to  20  individuals  every  day  at  5:30  PM.  He  finds  the
fellowship  in  AA  a  supplement  to  staying  away  from  alcohol.  He  has  completed  all  12
steps  in  AA,  is  in  the  process  of  repeating  them,  and  has  an  AA  sponsor.  He  also
participates  in  several  other  AA  meetings  during  the  week.  During  one  of  those
meetings,  he  serves  as  secretary  to  make  sure  rent  is  paid  and  there  is  money  for
coffee, tokens, and supplies. (Tr. 48-52, 71-75; GE 1) In addition to AA, Applicant relies
on his spirituality to deal with the losses and stressors that led to his drinking. He cited
the  Serenity  Prayer  as  a  source  of  inspiration  and  spoke  of  a  “higher  power”  that
provides him strength in times of need. (Tr. 53-54) As of his hearing date, Applicant had
served two years of unsupervised probation without any violations. (Tr. 55)
Although Applicant has  had periods of sobriety  in the past,  his current period of
sobriety is different from those. In the past, he did not have any support group, nor did
he have the coping tools he has today. (Tr. 55) He stated:
In   the   past,   when   I  tried   to   forecast   what   the   future   would  hold,  because
that’s  what  I   would   do   –   I  would   forecast.   I  would  say,  well,   you   know
what?  Maybe then  I can  do  this or maybe  –  and  that’s, in  my  opinion, what
got me  into  the  situation  where sobriety did not last  because  it was so  –  it
wasn’t in the  present,  whereas  today –  I live  –  I live  today in the  present.
(Tr. 56)
Applicant did not realize he was an alcoholic until October 5, 2019. Before that he
considered  his  DUIs  to  be  bad  luck  or  bad  timing  and  did  not  think  he  had  a  problem
with alcohol. In retrospect, he was a functioning alcoholic and was able to separate his
work  from  his  non-work  drinking  habits.  His  drinking  never  caused  him  problems  at
work. He drank alone as well as in group settings. He would frequently meet at his local
VFW with a group of friends after work. (Tr. 58-60)
Applicant works a 40-hour week, but with accumulated paid time off, he has every
Friday off. Having the additional time off during the week has been a  “huge benefit”  to
maintaining  his  sobriety.  He  owns  his  own  home  that  was  built  in  1948  and  spends  a
significant  portion  of  his  discretionary  free  time  maintaining  his  home,  gardening,  and
taking  care  of  his  dog.  (Tr.  75-77)  He  also  participates  in  Homes  For  Our  Troops
program, which provides homes for disabled veterans. (Tr. 77; AE J)
Post-hearing,  Applicant  submitted  a  January  5,  2022  chemical  dependency
assessment  that  corroborated  his  sobriety.  He  also  submitted  a  comprehensive
chemical dependency evaluation dated April 13, 2023. The evaluation was completed by
a  highly  credentialed  psychotherapist  and  addiction  specialist.  (AE  F(2),  AE  O,  AE  P)
The report concluded:
After  reviewing   all   aspects   of   this   evaluation   including   the   information
obtained  in the  clinical interview, the  questionnaires and  assessments,  the
UA  screening   and   a   review  of  diagnostic   criteria   for   Substance   Use
Disorder in the  DSM-V, it is this Evaluator’s opinion,  that [Applicant]  would
not meet  criteria   for any  current   Alcohol Use   Disorder mild, moderate,  or
severe.  [Applicant]   has  demonstrated   remorse,   insight,   and   has  been
extremely  proactive   in   dealing   with   the   events  of  his  past.   Additionally,
[Applicant]   has   been   sober   over  3  years  and   pursued   lifestyle  changes
that are congruent with first order, comprehensive, and  behavioral change.
Furthermore,  [Applicant]   has  been   extremely  involved   in  Alcoholics
Anonymous and  has spent  a significant  amount  of time  sponsoring  newly
sober  people   in  his  support  group   and   being   an   example  of   a   sober
lifestyle.  His   past   offenses  should   be   considered   events   that   lend   little
association  with  his current lifestyle. It is of this Evaluator’s opinion  that, at
this  time,  [Applicant]  is  fully  capable  of   maintaining   full   licensure  and
security  clearance   without  risk  associated   with   Alcohol  Use  Disorder.
Furthermore,  no   additional  treatment  or  testing   is  indicated   at  this   time.
(AE O, AE P)
With  regard  to  AA  participation,  Applicant  stated  attending  AA  meetings  has
helped him tremendously. He also derives satisfaction in helping others go through the
AA process. In short, the AA meetings have provided a turning point for him. He plans
to continue participating in and facilitating AA meetings and helping other AA members
in the future. (AE F)
Character Evidence
Applicant  submitted   six  reference   letters:  (1)  former  co-worker   and   friend,  who
has  known  Applicant   since   2016   (AC);  (2)     fellow  AA   member  and   friend,  who   has
known   Applicant   2019   (ND);  (3)   fellow   co-worker and   friend,  who  has  known   Applicant
for more  than  six years  (RW); (4) former co-worker and  friend, who has known Applicant
since  2016  (KH);  (5) fellow AA  member and  friend, who   has known  Applicant for more

daily  Zoom   AA   meetings   (FS).  Applicant’s  work-related   references
lauded   his
professionalism,   honesty,   good   character,   and   contribution   to   the   national  defense.
Additionally, his AA   references   noted  his commitment   to   sobriety  and   the  AA   program,
as well as  his willingness to  help others similarly situated. (Tr. 77-79; AE  A  –  AE  D, AE
K)   Applicant  also  submitted   his   employee   evaluations  for  2020,  2021,  and   2022   that
further corroborate  the  favorable  comments that his reference  letters provided.  (AE  L  –
