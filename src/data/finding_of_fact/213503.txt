Applicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security
clearance. Allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are incorporated
and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow.
Background
Applicant never married and has three children from previous relationships (ages
29,  24,  and  22.  (GEs  1-2;  Tr.  22)  Only her middle  child  (who  attends  college)  resides
with  her.  (Tr.  23).  She  earned  a  diploma  in  travel  and  tourism  in  February  2000,  an
associate’s degree in February 2002, and a bachelor’s degree in December 2005. (GEs
1-2) Applicant reported no military service.
Since November 2021, Applicant has been employed as a security officer for her
current employer. (GEs 1-2) She reported unemployment between September 2021 and
November  2021  and  between  February  and  March  2018.  (GEs  1  and  3).  Between
March 2018 and September 2021, she worked for a federal agency as a security officer.
She  held  various  jobs  with  other  employers  between  April  1999  and  February  2018.
Applicant  held  a  security  clearance  with  the  federal  agency  she  worked  for  between
March 2018 and September 2021. (GEs 1; Tr. 23, 27)
Applicant’s finances
Between  2013  and  2020,  Applicant  accumulated  14  delinquent  accounts
exceeding  $24,000.  (GEs  3-4  and  6-8)  To  date,  Applicant  has  provided  no
documentation of addressing any of the listed SOR debts. One of the listed SOR debts
(SOR  ¶  1.a)  covers  a  delinquency  balance  on  a  vehicle  she  purchased  in  2016  for
$10,712. (GEs 3 and 6-8) While the loan has since been charged off, Applicant retains
possession of the vehicle with no plans to pay off the debt. (GEs 68; Tr. 28-30)
Another  debt   (SOR  ¶   1.c)  covered   a   telecommunications   account  opened   in
2017  and  placed  for  collection  in 2021.  (GEs  6-7) Applicant  claimed  that  her cell  phone
covered  by the  account  was stolen  and  reported  to  the  police  and  SOR 1.c creditor. (Tr.
71-74) Told  by the  creditor that she  did  not need  to  worry about the  account,  she  never
followed  up  with  the  creditor or addressed  the  debt.  (Tr. 74) Without any  documentation
covering  her conversations  with  the  creditor,  her claims  of  forgiveness by SOR creditor
1.c cannot be accepted  as sufficient to resolve the debt.
Other  debts  covered  by  the  SOR  remain  unresolved  and  outstanding.  While
Applicant claims to have paid off two of the debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.j-1.k), lacked awareness of
others (SOR ¶¶ 1.g-1.h and 1.m), and committed to look into the remaining ones (SOR
¶¶ 1.f,  1.i, 1.k-1.l, and 1.n), she provided no documentation of any efforts to track down
these  debts  and  either  validate  and  resolve  them  or  dispute  them  with  documented
evidence.  Other  debts  that  she  acknowledged  as  her  own,  she  furnished  no
documentation of any initiatives on her part to contact her creditors and either work out
payment arrangements or explain why she could not reach any positive settlements with
the creditors.
Applicant’s  e-QIP  and PSI  omissions
Asked to complete an e-QIP in December 2021, Applicant omitted material facts
related to her delinquent debts she accumulated between 2013 and 2020. (GEs 1, 3-4,
and 6-8) More specifically, section 26 of her September 2021 e-QIP asked for answers,
inter  alia,  covering  any  delinquent  accounts  she
involuntary
repossessions, any accounts turned over to a collection agency, any accounts charged
off or cancelled  for failure  to pay as  agreed,  any garnishments or  attachments for any
reason,  and  any  accounts  over  120  days  delinquent  within  the  previous  seven  years.
(GE 1) Responding to each of the questions in her 2021 e-QIP, Applicant answered no
without any explanations or qualifications in the comment section of the e-QIP.
incurred,  any
Applicant’s only explanations for her denials of any debt delinquencies in the e-
QIPs she completed were her claims of unawareness of any listed delinquent accounts
in her credit report. See Applicant’s SOR response and hearing testimony.
In a follow-up personal subject interview (PSI) with an investigator from the Office
of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  in  January  2022,  Applicant  was  asked  during  the
course  of  her  interview  whether  she  has  any  delinquent  accounts,  and  she  initially
confirmed the correctness of all of the information about her finances that she provided
in  her  2021  E-QIP.  (GE  3)  After  being  afforded  the  opportunity  to  provide  voluntary
information  about  her  finances,  she  was  confronted  by  the  investigator  about  each  of
the debts listed in the SOR. (GE 3) Once confronted, Applicant admitted the debts and
provided explanations about the debts and what steps she intended to take to address
them, (GE 3)
Considered  together,  and  taking  account  of  her  explanations  and  all  of  the
circumstances  surrounding  Applicant’s  debt  accruals  and  ensuing  denials  over  the
course of many years,  Applicant’s withholding  of  material information  about the  details
of her accumulated debts in her 2021 e-QIP and ensuing PSI, inferences are warranted
that  her  material  omissions  were  the  result  of  candor  and  judgment  lapses  that  were
corrected  only after  confrontation  by  her  interviewing  OPM  investigator  in  her  January
2022 PSI.
Other incidents covered in the SOR reflect acts of dishonesty on Applicant’s part
that when stitched together form a pattern of dishonest conduct over a period of many
years  (even  without  convictions).  Each  of  these  incidents  were  covered  in  Applicant’s
2022 PSI. Confronted by the OPM investigator in her 2022 PSI with a reported incident
in  February  2008,  in  which  she  was  reportedly  arrested  and  charged  with  theft  that
occurred  during  her  employment  at  a  previously
listed  employer,  Applicant
acknowledged the incident, while defending her actions, and claimed she was subjected
to  a  deferred  judgment  (not  a  conviction),  placed  on  two  years  of  probation,  and
ultimately discharged from the deferred judgment. (GE 3)  Similarly, when confronted by
the  OPM  agent  with  a  reported  2013  incident,  in  which  she  was charged  with  coupon
fraud while employed by another listed employer, Applicant acknowledged her charged
actions, her ensuing  Alford plea, and her  acceptance of  the court’s  imposed probation
and fine. (GEs 3 and 5; Tr. 64-67))
In addition to the raised 2008 and 2013 theft and fraud incidents, Applicant was
asked  in  her  2022  PSI  about  employer  allegations  of  a  14-day  suspension  from  her
employment with a government employer in June 2021 over multiple complaints about
her  behavior  from  supervisors,  co-workers,  and  passengers.  (GE  3)  Applicant
acknowledged  her  suspension,  while  attesting  to  her  vacating  her  employment  in
September 2021. (GE 3; Tr. 60-61)
