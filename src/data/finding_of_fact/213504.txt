Applicant is a 58-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since May 2021. He worked for a different federal contractor from
2012  to  May  2021.  He  served  in  the  U.S.  military  from  1988  until  he  was  honorably
discharged in 2008. He is married with two adult children. (Item 3)
Applicant cosigned a student loan from a credit union with his daughter in 2012.
The understanding was that she would make the payments. As a cosigner, Applicant is
legally  responsible  for  the  loan  if  his  daughter  does  not  pay  it.  Nobody  maintained
payments on the loan. The last payment was reported as made in September 2020, and
the  credit  union  charged  off  $95,126.  Credit  reports  indicate  that  the  balance  on  the
account  was  $102,145  in  October  2022;  $104,056  in  February  2023;  and  $107,590  in
October 2023. (Items 6-8)
Applicant  was  interviewed  for  his  background  investigation  in  December  2022.
He  told  the investigator that he was unaware of the  status of  the  student  loan until he
talked  to  his  daughter  the  day  before  the  interview.  He  daughter  had  an  inconsistent
payment history because of her low income. He said that his daughter was attempting
to contact the collection company for the loan to set up a payment plan. He stated that
he  planned  to  pay  his daughter  $300  per  month  as  assistance  in  paying  the  loan.  He
could  afford  that  amount  because  he  was  half  beneficiary  of  his  recently  deceased
sibling’s retirement, which he expected to be $125,000. He did not plan to contact  the
credit union or the collection company directly, as he allowed his daughter to handle it.
(Item 4)
When  Applicant  responded  to  interrogatories  in  June  2023,  he  wrote  that  his
daughter “has had problems trying to get ahold of them to work something out. She is
trying.”  He  wrote  that  no  one  came  after  him,  and  all  his  other  bills  were  being  taken
care of. (Item 4)
Applicant  denied  owing  the  defaulted  student  loan  in  his  response  to  the  SOR.
He wrote:
As  per  my  Credit   Karma   account,   that  debt   has  been   closed   and   is  no
longer  shown  on   my  debt  owed.  There   are   also  no   current   collections
against me.  My  current score is  689. This  is  not the  score  of  someone  in
financial distress. This should not be held against me. Thank you.
