In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions
are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  25-year-old  maintenance  clerk  employed  by  a  federal  contractor
since June 2022. He served on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps from August 2016 to
August  2020  and  received  an  honorable  discharge.  While  on  active  duty,  he  received
nonjudicial  punishment  under  Article  15  of  the  Uniform  Code  of  Military  Justice  for
misusing a government travel card for personal expenses, including caring for his wife’s
family  members.  He  was  reduced  in  rank  from  pay  grade  E-4  to  E-3.  His  nonjudicial
punishment is alleged in SOR ¶1.h.
Applicant  held  a  security  clearance  while  on  active  duty,  but  it  was  suspended
because  of  his  misuse  of  the  government  travel  card.  He  does  not  currently  have  a
security clearance.
Applicant  married  in  November  2017,  but  has  been  separated  since  February
2019. He lives with his partner, their new-born baby, and his younger sister. He is the
only person in the household who is employed. (FORM Item 6 at 6)
The SOR alleges seven delinquent debts, reflected in credit reports dated July 7,
2022 (FORM Item 5) and April 12, 2023 (FORM Item 4). The evidence concerning those
debts is summarized below.
SOR ¶  1.a: credit-card account  placed for collection  of  $12,246. The  July 2022
credit report reflected  that this debt was  charged  off  for $12,790.  (FORM  Item  5  at 2) In
July 2022,  Applicant told a  security  investigator that he  had  consolidated  his  debts  to  this
creditor and  had  a  payment agreement for $327  per month. (FORM  Item  7  at 3) The  April
2023 credit report reflects that Applicant is making payments on this debt under a partial-
payment agreement. (FORM Item 4 at 2)
SOR  ¶   1.c:  damage  to  an  apartment  totaling  $2,087.  In  Applicant’s  security
interview  in  July  2022,  he  told  the  investigator  that  his  wife’s  family  broke  into  his
apartment while he was absent on military training, stole all his belongings, and damaged
the  apartment.  This  debt  is  for  damages  to  the  apartment.  Applicant  submitted  no
evidence of efforts to resolve it.
SOR ¶  1.e: line of credit with credit union, past due for $1,613, with a total
balance of $11,172. The creditor for this debt is the same as the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a and
is included in the same payment agreement . (FORM Item 7 at 5)
SOR  ¶¶   1.b,   1.d,   1.f,   1.g:  personal  loan  placed  for  collection  of  $9,253;.
cellphone bill placed for collection of $1,230; delinquent cable television account
placed for collection of $422; and utility bill placed for collection of $326. Applicant
submitted no evidence of efforts to resolve these debts. They are not resolved.
In  response  to  financial  interrogatories  in  April  2023,  Applicant  submitted  a
personal financial statement reflecting net monthly income of $3,682 (based solely on his
salary)  and  monthly  expenses  of  $3,212,  leaving  a  net  monthly  remainder  of  $670.
(FORM Item 6 at 7) He did not list any debt payments such as his monthly payments of
$327 to the creditor alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.e. He provided no evidence of financial
counseling.
