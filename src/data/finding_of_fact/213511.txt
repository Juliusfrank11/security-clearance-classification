In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, she admitted all the allegations in the SOR. Her
admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 42-year-old program analyst employed by a defense contractor. She
served on active duty in the U.S. Air Force from April 2002 to September 2022 and retired
with an honorable discharge. She was employed by another defense contractor after her
retirement  until  she  was  hired  by  her  current  employer  in  December  2022.  Her  SCA
reflects that she underwent background investigations and received clearances in 2001,
2010, and 2020.
Applicant married in September 2003, divorced in June 2007, married in October
2011, and divorced in October 2015. Her January 2023 SCA reflects that she has three
children,  ages  3,  9,  and  13.  In  her  answer  to  the  SOR,  she  stated  that  she  “lost”  the
youngest child’s father in February 2020. She has taken college courses since 2006 but
has not earned a degree.
The SOR alleges two delinquent debts: SOR ¶ 1.a alleges a collection account for
$3,481; and SOR ¶ 1.b alleges an automobile finance loan charged off for $34,991. SOR
¶ 2.a alleges that Applicant falsified her SCA by deliberately failing to disclose the two
debts.
When Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in April 2023, she told
the investigator that she was unaware of her delinquent debts until she applied for a home
mortgage  loan in August 2022.  In her  answer to the SOR, she stated that she did not
disclose  the  two  debts  in her SCA because  she  “must have  read  the  question  wrong,”
and she did not know about some of her debts until she was interviewed by  a security
investigator in April and May 2023.
The  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.a  was  reflected  in  a  February  2023  credit  report.
(FORM  Item  7)  When  Applicant  responded  to  the  SOR,  she  submitted  documentary
evidence that this debt was resolved in September 2023. (FORM Item 4 at 3-5)
The  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.b  was  an  automobile  loan.  Applicant  told  the
investigator that the loan was solely in her name, with the understanding that her husband
would  make  the  payments.  When  they  separated,  her  husband  stopped  making  the
payments. In her answer to the SOR, she stated that she was working with the creditor,
but she submitted no evidence of payments, a payment plan, or other resolution of the
debt.  (FORM  Item  3  at  3)  This  debt  is  reflected  in  the  February  2023  credit  report  as
assigned for collection in May 2015. (FORM Item 7) It is not reflected in an August 2023
credit report. (FORM Item 6)
The security investigator’s summary of the interviews conducted in April and May
2023  reflects  that  Applicant’s  net  monthly  income  is  about  $13,100.  Her  total  living
expenses  and  debt  payments  are  about  $4,109,  leaving  a  net  monthly  remainder  of
$8,999. (FORM Item 8 at 4)
