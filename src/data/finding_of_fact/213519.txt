Applicant admitted all of the allegations. His admissions are adopted as findings
of  fact.  After  a  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  evidence,  I  make  the  following
additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 32 years old. He has worked for a defense contractor since 2019, as
an  operations  manager.  He  was  unemployed  from  April  to  June  2018  and  from
November 2010 to February 2011. He holds two associate degrees, earned in 2010. He
used  student  loans  to  finance  this  education.  He  has  been  married  for  five  years  and
has a stepchild from this marriage. He also has two children from a prior relationship for
whom he pays child support of $950 monthly. (Tr. 6, 24, 49; GE 1-2)
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant  had  four  delinquent  student  loans,  in  collection
status, totaling approximately $6,260. (SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.e) It also alleged that he failed to
file his 2018 and 2019 federal income tax returns, as required. (SOR ¶ 1.a)
Student Loans.
Applicant  admitted the  four delinquent  student  loans.  He  claimed to  have  made
payments  using  his  debit  card  through  about  January  2012  when  he  received  a  new
bank  debit  card  but  never  informed  the  student  loan  servicer  about  the  change.  He
subsequently changed mailing addresses and did not receive correspondence from the
loan  servicer.  Applicant  admitted  not  making  any  student  loan  payments  during  this
time. Sometime in 2019, the loan servicer effectuated a garnishment proceeding against
Applicant and automated deductions came out of his paychecks. Sometime in 2020 or
2021,  the  deductions  ceased  because  of  the  pandemic  relief  provided  by  the  CARES
Act for student loan payments. Applicant’s most recent credit report shows that all four
student  loans  are  in  collection  status  with  the  dates  of  first major  delinquency  ranging
from  April 2017 (two  loans),  May 2018  (one loan),  and  February 2021  (one  loan).  (Tr.
29-30, 43-46; GE 1-2, 5)
Recently  (no  specific  date  provided  in  the  record),  Applicant’s  student  loans
came  under  control  of  a  new  servicing  provider.  In  July  2023,  Applicant  set  up  a
payment plan with the provider and made his first $60 monthly payment on October 2,
2023. The payments are set up to come out of his bank account  monthly. The current
balance on these student loans is approximately $5,212. (Tr. 30, 46-47; AE A, C-D)
Tax Return Non-Filings.
Applicant admitted that he failed to timely file his 2018 and 2019 federal income
tax returns. He testified that he cannot confirm that they have now been filed. He also
has not filed his 2020 federal return and he does not know if his 2021 federal return was
filed.  (Since the  non-filing of his 2020 and 2021 returns  was not alleged in the SOR, I
will  not  use  this  evidence  for  disqualification  purposes,  however,  I  may  use  it  for
credibility,  determining  mitigation,  and  in  assessing  the  whole-person  factors.)  (Tr.  27,
37-38; SOR answer; GE 1-2)
Applicant  explained  that  he  got  into  his  tax  difficulties  in  approximately  2018,
when he decided to change his W-4 tax withholding form so that nothing was deducted
from his paycheck to make the monthly payments  towards his federal taxes. He called
this  process  “going  exempt.”  He  took  this  action  so  he  would  have  more  money
available  to  pay  other  financial  obligations.  He  now  understands  he  made  a  poor
decision in that regard. When it came time to file his 2018 federal tax return, he did not
have the funds to pay the amount he owed, so he did not file a tax  return.  He did the
same thing regarding his 2019 and 2020 federal returns for the same reason. He knows
he owes “a good amount of money” for these tax years. (He resides in a state that does
not have a state income tax.) (Tr. 25-28; GE 4)
On June 25, 2021, Applicant completed a security clearance application. In it he
disclosed  that  he  failed  to  file  his  2018  and  2019  federal  returns  and  the  reason  for
doing  so.  He  estimated  that  he  owed  a  total  of  $30,000  in  taxes  for  these  two  years.
(Since the failure to pay his 2018 and 2019 taxes was not alleged in the SOR, I will not
use  this  evidence  for  disqualification  purposes,  however,  I  may  use  it  for  credibility,
determining mitigation, and in assessing the whole-person factors.) On June 28, 2021,
he entered into an agreement with a tax service to assist him with filing  his delinquent
tax returns and  working out a payment plan with the IRS. Even after engaging  the tax
service, Applicant could not document that his 2018 and 2019 federal returns have been
filed. (Tr. 27; GE 1, 3)
Applicant  provided  documentation  showing  he  entered  into  an  addendum
agreement  with  the  tax  service  on  November  21,  2023.  He  did  not  provide
documentation  that  his  2018  and  2019  returns  were  filed  after  signing  the  addendum.
Applicant  is  aware  of  how  to  obtain  copies  of  his  tax  account  transcripts,  which  will
indicate whether a certain year’s tax return has been filed and the date it was received
by the IRS. He obtained his 2017, 2018, and 2019 transcripts by using the IRS website
in July 2022, in response to the Government interrogatories. At that time, the transcripts
showed that neither the 2018 or 2019 tax returns had been filed. Applicant admitted at
hearing that he has not gone back to the IRS website to request updated transcripts for
his  2018  and  2019  tax  returns.  He  also  has  not  contacted  the  IRS  directly  about  his
non-filed tax returns. (Tr. 53-54; GE 4; AE F)
Other Financial Factors.
Applicant  provided  an  updated  personal  financial  statement  that  shows  a  net
monthly remainder of $2,308 after paying all expenses and debt servicing. He is current
on his child support obligation and has never been delinquent. He also identified a non-
SOR debt that he paid in November 2023. (Tr. 24, 32, 50, 53; AE B, E)
