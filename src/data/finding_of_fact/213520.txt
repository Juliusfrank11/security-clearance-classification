In  Applicant’s  SOR  response,  he  admitted  both  allegations  in  the  SOR.  His
admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings follow.
Applicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor seeking to obtain a
security clearance. He has worked for his current employer since February 2019. This is
his first time applying for a security clearance. He is a high school graduate and has some
college credits. He is single and has no children. (Tr.13-14; GE 1)
Financial Considerations
The SOR alleges that Applicant failed to file his Federal Income tax returns for tax
years 2017 and 2018, (SOR ¶ 1.a) and failed to file his state income tax returns for tax
years 2017 and 2018. (SOR ¶ 1.b)
Applicant admits to not filing his federal and state income tax returns for 2017 and
2018. He believed that he was not required to file them because his income was below
the amount required to file income tax returns.  He also mistakenly believed he did not
have  to  file  if  he  had  refunds.  He  admits  he  should  have  researched  the  issue  before
deciding not to file his federal and state income tax returns for 2017 and 2018. (Answer
to SOR; Tr. 20-21; Gov 2; Gov 3)
During  his  security  clearance  background  investigation,  Applicant  answered
several interrogatories about his tax filing history. (GE 2; GE 3) At the time of completing
the  interrogatories,  he  was  not  sure  whether  he  filed  his  federal  and  state  income  tax
returns for 2017 and 2018.  He cooperated during the investigation and asked if there
were  further  steps  he  needed  to  take  to  resolve  the  issue.  He  provided  proof  that  his
federal income tax returns were filed for tax years 2015, 2016, 2019, 2020, and 2021.
(GE 2 at 5; GE 3 at 6-10)
In  February  2023,  Applicant  received  the  SOR.  He  became  aware  that  he  was
required to file his federal and state income tax returns for 2017 and 2018. He immediately
hired an accountant to help him file his income tax returns. He completed and filed his
2017 and 2018 federal income tax returns on March 20, 2023.  He received refunds for
each tax year. He provided proof that both his 2017 and 2018 federal and state income
tax  returns  were  sent  via  Fed  Ex  to  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  and  the  state
department  of  taxation.  (AE  A)  He  testified  that  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)
accepted his returns but advised him that he would not receive the refunds because he
waited more than three years to file his tax returns. After 2018, he has filed his federal
and state income tax returns on a timely basis. He does not owe any tax debts to the IRS
or the state department of taxation. (Tr. 22-27)
