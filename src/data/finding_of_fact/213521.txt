Guideline H –  Drug Involvement
1.a.  Applicant  used  marijuana  with  varying  frequency  from  about  January  1992
until his last usage  in August  of  2022,  about 15 months  prior to his hearing.  Applicant
has taken a drug test to confirm his abstinence. (AppX C.) Prior to his application for a
security  clearance,  Applicant’s  usage  was  “a  couple  times  a  week.”  Because  of  a
snowboarding accident,  Applicant had a “Medical Marijuana Prescription  in  California,”

page 24 line 20 to page 28 line 15.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
Applicant blames his past financial difficulties, including failure to file Federal and
state  income  tax  returns,  to  periods  of  unemployment  and  underemployment.  He  also
misunderstood  the  obligation  to  file  income  taxes,  thinking  that  he  had  withheld  more
than enough income to cover his income taxes that were due. (TR at page 30 line 21 to
page 32 line 19.)
