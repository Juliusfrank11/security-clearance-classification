Applicant is a 23-year-old prospective employee of a government contractor. The
relevant  government  contractor  offered  him  a  job  in  June  2022  that  was  conditioned
upon  him  graduating  from  college  and  obtaining  a  security  clearance.  He  earned  an
undergraduate  degree  in  December  2022  with  a  3.69  grade  point  average  (GPA),
including  a  4.0  GPA  during  his  last  two  semesters.  He  has  never married  and  has  no
children. (Tr. 18-19, 25-26; GE 1, 2; AE D, E)
From  about  June  2021  until  about  March  2023,  Applicant  used  marijuana  with
varying frequency. He purchased it once from a dispensary in State A in June 2021. He
estimated  that  he  used  it  socially  with  friends  about  20  times  during  this  period.  At  all
times  relevant  to  this  security  clearance  investigation,  marijuana  purchase  and
possession  (and  therefore  its  use)  has  been  illegal  under  federal  law.  However,
pursuant to state laws in State A, where he resided while he used marijuana, its use has
been legal. In July 2022, while he was still in college, Applicant completed and certified
an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (SF 86). He continued to use
marijuana for several months after completing the SF 86 and after his September 2022
security interview with a DOD investigator. (Tr. 17, 19-26, 32-35; Answer; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  stopped  using  marijuana  after  he  received
the  Governmentâ€™s
interrogatories in March 2023, as he realized that marijuana use was incompatible with
holding a security clearance. Prior to then, he thought using marijuana was acceptable
because  it  was  legal  pursuant  to  the  laws  in  State  A,  because  he  had  not  started
working  for  a  government  contractor,  and  he  did  not  have  access  to  any  classified
information. While he used marijuana after being granted an interim security clearance,
he was not notified that he had earned one. (Tr. 17, 19-26, 32-35; Answer; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  now  understands  that  marijuana  is  not  compatible  with  holding  a
security clearance and will hinder his career development. Now that he is out of college,
he  has  shifted  his focus  to  obtaining  his first  post-college  job  and  being  a  responsible
adult. He also now understands that being involved with marijuana is illegal, regardless
of  what  state  laws  seem  to  indicate.  He  acknowledged  that  he  was  immature  and  did
not understand the seriousness of illegal drug use. He has no future intent to purchase,
possess,  or  use  marijuana  or  other  illegal  drugs  and  provided  a  signed  statement  of
intent  to  that  effect.  He  also  no  longer  associates  with  anyone  who  is  involved  with
illegal drugs. I observed him testify and found him to be credible. (Tr. 17, 24-30, 32-33;
Answer; GE 1, 2; AE A-C)
Applicant  provided  a  copy  of  a  January  2024  urinalysis  test  result  that  was
negative  for  several  illegal  drugs,  including  marijuana.  He  received  a  leadership  and
community engagement award from his university in the fall of 2022. He also provided
character-reference letters from a former work colleague and friends who wrote that he
is trustworthy, loyal, hardworking, and a leader. One  of these friends is a veteran who
holds a security clearance. All those who submitted character-reference letters believe
he  should be  entrusted  with  a  security clearance.  (Tr.  17,  24-30, 32-33;  Answer;  GE  1,
2;  AE A-C)
