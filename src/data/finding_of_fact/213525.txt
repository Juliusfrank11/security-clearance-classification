Applicant  admitted  all  the  SOR  allegations  in  his  Answer.  He  is  29  years  old,
married, and he does not have any children. (Answer; Items 1-2)
Applicant  was  unemployed  from  July  2012  to  March  2015.  He  worked  in  retail
from March 2015 to March 2016. He then changed careers and worked as a machinist
for various companies, to include a staffing company, until August 2021. He has since
worked as a legal transcriptionist. He has never held a security clearance. (Item 2)
The SOR alleges that Applicant had three medical debts in collection for $2,477,
$1,265,  and  $51,  respectively  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b,  1.i),  and  six  delinquent  consumer
accounts  totaling  $7,104  (SOR  ¶¶  1.c-1.h).  The  allegations  are  established  by
Applicant’s  admissions  in  his  Answer,  his  August  2022  security  clearance  application
(SCA),  his  February  2023  response  to  interrogatories,  and  credit  bureau  reports  from
September 2022 and March 2023. (Items 1-5)
Applicant  attributes  his  delinquent  debts  to  minimal  income,  an  employment
layoff  in January 2017,  underemployment  in March  2019, and an in-state  relocation  in
August  2021.  He  planned  to  file  bankruptcy  or  seek  other  debt  relief  programs  to
resolve his delinquent debts, but he did not provide documentation of his efforts. (Items
2-3)
Applicant’s three medical debts stem from  an emergency visit that required him
to  have  oral  surgery.  SOR  ¶¶  1.c  through  1.f  are  for  credit  cards,  in  collection  for
$1,221, $814, $652, and $200, respectively. (Items 2-5)
SOR ¶ 1.g is a $3,533 charged-off credit line with an online retailer. It is reported
on  the  September  2022  credit  bureau  report.  Although  the  March  2023  credit  bureau
report reflects a zero balance for this debt, it also notes that this account was 150 days
past due, charged to profit and loss, and purchased by another lender. Applicant did not
provide documentation to show that he resolved this debt. (Items 2-5)
SOR ¶ 1.h is an auto loan past due in the amount of $664, with an outstanding
balance  of  $15,960.  It  is  reported  on  the  September  2022  credit  bureau  report.  The
March 2023 credit bureau report also reflects a zero balance for this debt, but it notes
that there may be a balance due after the “merchandise was taken back by grantor” and
loss.  Applicant  did  not  provide
to  profit  and
that
documentation to show that he resolved this debt. (Items 4-5)
the  account  was  charged
In  February  2023,  Applicant  stated  that  he  and  his  spouse’s  joint  monthly  net
income  was  approximately  $4,000.  After  expenses,  which  did  not  include  payments
toward   any   of  his  delinquent   debts,   their   monthly   net   remainder  was  $120.   (Item   3)
There is no evidence  in the record that Applicant has received credit counseling.
