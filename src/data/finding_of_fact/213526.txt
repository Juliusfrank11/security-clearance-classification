In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b.
(HE 3) He also provided mitigating information. His admissions are accepted as findings
of fact.
Applicant is a 40-year-old engineering manager who has been employed by a large
defense contractor since 2004. (Tr. 6-7) In 2001, he graduated from high school. (Tr. 6)
In 2005, he received a bachelor’s degree in a specialized type of engineering. (Tr. 6) He
has  not  served  in  the  military.  (Tr.  7)  In  2020,  he  married,  and  he  has  a  two-year-old
daughter. (Tr. 7-8)
Applicant has held a security clearance since 2005, and there is no evidence of
security violations. He lived in a foreign country from November 2013 through September
2018, where he worked for his current employer. (HE 3) He worked very hard to meet his
employer’s  requirements,  and  this  included  deployments  and  rotations  away  from  his
residence in the United States. (Tr. 21-22)
Financial Considerations
SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b allege Applicant failed to timely file as required his federal and
state income tax returns for tax years (TY) 2014 through 2020. His federal income tax
returns for TYs 2019 through 2021 were filed in May 2022. His federal income tax return
for TY 2022 was timely filed.
Several  of  the  overdue  tax  returns  were  drafted  several  years  ago;  however,
Applicant elected not to file them because he thought it would be better to file all of them
at the same time. (Tr. 29; GE 2 at 3) He wanted his attorney to review the draft tax returns
before  they  were  filed.  (Tr.  35)  When  he  first  met  with  a  tax  attorney,  the  attorney
suggested that he not file the tax return for TY 2015, and to wait for the IRS to address
the   issue.   (Tr.  30-32)   The   IRS   filed   substitute   returns   for   TYs  2014   and   2016,   and
determined  he  owed  about  $79,000  for  TY 2014  and  about $61,000  for TY 2016.  (Tr. 32-
33, 36; GE 2 at 3)
For TY 2018, the state assessed additional taxes of about $16,000. (GE 2 at 4)
However, the IRS was unaware of the taxes Applicant paid to the foreign country while
he lived overseas and of the amount of state taxes he already paid. (Tr. 32; GE 2 at 4)
He expected to receive a deduction for taxes paid to the foreign country. He did not feel
an urgency to get his federal and state income tax returns filed because he did not believe
he  would  owe  taxes  after  all  tax  returns  were  correctly  filed.  (Tr.  30-31)  Applicant
conceded at the time of his hearing, and in his December 7, 2023 email, that he had not
filed all federal and state income tax returns which were due for TYs 2014 through 2018.
(Tr. 38) On December 7, 2023, Applicant provided the information which he summarized
in the following table. (AE F)

Applicant paid the taxes owed for TY 2020 when he filed his federal income tax
return in May 2022. (AE B) His refund for TY 2022 was transferred to address a tax debt
for TY 2016, which was based on the substitute return the IRS filed. (Tr. 40-41; AE D) He
said all state and federal taxes for TYs 2019 through 2022 are filed and paid. (AE F) A
letter from a law firm dated November 1, 2023, indicated the law firm had agreed to work
on filing Applicant’s tax returns for TY 2014 through 2018. (Tr. 21-22; AE E)
Applicant is generally financially responsible. His car loan will be paid off in two
months. (Tr. 20) During his time living in a foreign country, he had access to tax resources
which he could have used to complete his federal and state income tax returns. (Tr. 20,
22) He  was  aware  of his obligation  to file  his  federal  income  tax  returns  while  he  was
living in a foreign country. (Tr. 20, 24) He had some difficulties obtaining information about
filing his state and federal income tax returns. (Tr. 21) Filing his tax returns “would then
be out-prioritized by other things rather than moving forward.” (Tr. 21) He acknowledged
that he did not have a good reason for his failure to timely file his tax returns. (Tr. 22, 24)
