Applicant  admitted  all  the  SOR  allegations  in  his  Answer.  He  is  50  years  old,
married,  and  he  has  an  adult  child.  He  served  honorably  in  the  U.S.  military  from
January  1992  until  he  retired  in  February  2018.  He  has  since  worked  as  a  senior
logistics  analyst  for  his  employer,  a  DOD  contractor.  He  was  first  granted  a  security
clearance while he served in the U.S. military. (Answer; Items 1, 2, 4)
The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  had  three  delinquent  consumer  debts:  a
$31,539 charged-off credit card (SOR ¶ 1.a); a credit card in collection for $970 (SOR ¶
1.b);  and  a  store  credit  card  in  collection  for  $364  (SOR  ¶  1.c).  The  allegations  are
established  by  Applicant’s  admissions  in  his  Answer,  his  May  2022  background
interview  with  an  authorized  DOD  investigator,  and  a  credit  bureau  report  from  April
2022. (Items 1, 2, 8)
Applicant  indicated  during  his  background  interview  that  he  did  not  realize  how
delinquent his debts  had  become.  He acknowledged that he procrastinated paying  his
debts,  but  he  planned  to  pull  a  copy  of  his  credit  bureau  report  and  make  payment
arrangements  for  his  delinquent  accounts  no  later  than  May  2022.  In  his  Answer,  he
stated that: (1) he would settle the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a by the end of May 2023; (2) the
debt in SOR ¶ 1.b was no longer delinquent and carried a balance of $700; and (3) he
paid  the  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.c  in  May  2023.  He  did  not  provide  documentation  to
corroborate  his  claims.  Credit  bureau  reports  from  November  2022  and  January  2023
do  not  reflect  any  delinquent  debts.  The  2023  credit  bureau  report  also  reflects  that
three accounts with the same original creditor as that of SOR ¶ 1.b were current. (Items
2, 5-7)
Applicant estimated during his background interview that his net monthly salary,
which  included  $2,792  in  military  retirement  pay,  was  $7,334,  and  his  monthly  net
remainder  after  expenses  was  $3,117.  He  also  indicated  that  he  had  $15,000  in  his
bank savings account. He had not received any financial counseling. (Item 5)
