In his Answer, Applicant denied the sole SOR allegation. He is 42 years old, he
has never married, and he does not have any children. He worked as a part-time clerk
for  a  music  company  from  August  2012  to  January  2017.  Since  April  2016,  he  has
worked as a part-time, self-employed, music instructor. He has also worked as a part-
time  janitor  for  his  employer,  a  DOD  contractor,  since  July  2022,  and  as  a  part-time
music  instructor  for  a  nonprofit  organization  since  August  2022.  He  has  never  held  a
security clearance. (Items 1, 3-4, 6)
The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  failed  to  file  his  federal  income  tax  returns  for
tax years (TY) 2015 through 2019, as required, and that they remained unfiled as of the
date of the SOR. (SOR ¶ 1.a) The allegation is established by Applicant’s admission in
his Answer, October 2022 security clearance application (SCA), May 2023 response to
interrogatories,  and  November  2022  background  interview  with  an  authorized  DOD
investigator. (Items 1, 3-6)
Applicant  was  unsure  why  he  did  not  file  his  federal  income  tax  returns  for  TY
2015  and  2016.  He  stated  in  his  2023  response  to  interrogatories  that  he  would  have
received a refund for these tax years “since I was still a W2 employee, and paid taxes
for those years.” The record does not contain any documentation reflecting that he filed
his federal income tax returns for TY 2015 and 2016. (Item 5)
Applicant  attributed  his  failure  to file  his federal income  tax  returns  for TY  2017
through 2019 to financial distress, poor planning, and bad judgment. Having decided to
change  careers  to  focus  on  being  a  music  instructor,  he  earned  $13,525  in  2017.  He
chose to wait until his earnings increased to file his federal income tax return for that tax
year because he needed to live off his savings. He stated in his SCA, “It wasn’t until well
after the deadline that I realized I hadn’t filed, and [I] decided to wait to be contacted by
the IRS.” (Items 4-6)
In  2018,  Applicant  earned  $19,636.  Still  struggling  financially,  he  was  worried
about  what  he  owed  from  the  previous  year.  He  stated  in  his  SCA,  “[a]fter  much
procrastination, the date to file had passed and I decided to take care of everything at a
later date.” (Item 4-6)
In 2019, Applicant earned $27,377. With his increased earnings, he intended to
file his income tax returns in 2020 and pay for any taxes owed with the money he was
able  to  save.  When  the  COVID-19  pandemic  caused  him  to  instantly  lose  60%  of  his
students, he “[w]orried that the lock down would last until a vaccine was available, I had
to live off what savings I had, so I decided to postpone filing my federal taxes again.” He
indicated  during  his  background  interview  that  he  should  have  elected  to  have  taxes
taken out of his pay quarterly to keep from acquiring a tax bill that he could not afford to
pay.  The  record  does  not  contain  any documentation  reflecting  that he  filed  his  federal
income tax returns for TY 2017 through  2019.  (Item 4-6)
In 2020, Applicant earned $19,483. He timely filed his federal income tax return
for  that  tax  year  in  March  2021.  He  owed  $713  and  had  an  $1,800  credit,  so  he  was
issued  a  refund  of  $1,087.  In  August  2022,  the  IRS  notified  him  that  a  third  party
reported that he had earned more than $19,483 in 2020, and he consequently owed an
additional  $2,740  in  federal  income  taxes  for  that  tax  year.  He  disputed  the  IRS’s
determination in September 2022. In his response to interrogatories, he stated that the
IRS  denied  his  dispute  and,  “[o]nce  I  finish  paying  that  amount  off,  I  plan  on  filing  all
missing  years.”  (Items  4-6)  As  Applicant’s  outstanding  federal  taxes  for  TY  2020  was
not  alleged  in  the  SOR,  it  may  not  be  an  independent  basis  for  revoking  Appellant’s
clearance. However, I may consider it for the limited purposes of evaluating Applicant’s
evidence  of  extenuation,  mitigation,  or  changed  circumstances;  to  decide  whether  a
particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or to provide evidence
for the whole-person analysis.
Applicant timely filed his federal income tax return for TY 2021 and he had a zero
balance for that tax year as of an IRS tax account transcript from March 2023. (Item 5)
Documentation from the  state  tax  authority  reflects  that  Applicant did  not  have  a state
income tax filing requirement for  TY 2015 through 2017, and he filed his state income
tax returns but did not have a tax liability for TY 2018 through 2020. He was contacted
by the state tax authority in the summer of 2021 regarding his outstanding state taxes,
which he paid as of October 2021. (Items 4-6)
Applicant  indicated  during  his  background  interview  that  he  sets  aside  money
from his pay to ensure that he has enough saved at the end of the year to pay any taxes
owed. He does not intend to repeat the same mistakes he previously made. He intends
to work with the IRS to establish a payment plan to resolve his outstanding taxes. (Item
6)
