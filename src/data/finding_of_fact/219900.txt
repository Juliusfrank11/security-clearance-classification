In  Applicant’s  SOR  response,  he  admitted  the  allegations  in  the  SOR.  His
admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings follow.
Applicant  is  a  75-year-old  contractor  for  a  DOD  agency  seeking  to  obtain  or
maintain a trustworthiness position. He has owned his current company since 2016. He
has owned  a contracting business  since 1995.  He served on active  duty in the  United
States Air Force from 1970 to 1973, separating with an honorable discharge. He held a
security  clearance  in  the  past  without  incident.  His  highest  level  of  education  is  a
bachelor’s degree. He is married but lives separately from his wife. He has adult children.
(Tr.44-46, 87; GE 1; AE D, enclosures 5-6)
Financial Considerations
The SOR alleges Applicant failed to file his federal income tax returns for tax years
2010 through 2018. (SOR ¶ 1.a: GE 1 at 3 - 4; GE 2 at 4, 11); is indebted to the federal
Government for delinquent taxes in the approximate amount of $223,723 for tax years
2010 through 2016. (SOR ¶ 1.b: GE 2 at 4, 11-12, 19-37); failed to file his State A income
tax returns for tax years 2010, 2011, 2015, 2016, and 2017 (SOR ¶ 1.c: GE 2 at 38); and
is indebted to State A for delinquent taxes in the amount of $38,595 for tax years 2010,
2011, and 2016. (SOR ¶ 1.d: GE 2 at 2, 4, 13, 38-40).
Additional allegations consist of a $4,094 delinquent medical account (SOR ¶ 1.e:
GE 2 at 5; GE 3 at 1; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 2; GE 6 at 8); a $192 delinquent medical account
(SOR ¶ 1.f: GE 2 at 5; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 2; GE 6 at 9); and a $206 delinquent
medical account. (SOR ¶ 1.g: GE 2 at 6; GE 3 at 2; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 2; GE 6 at 8)
Applicant  and  his  business  partner  started  a  consulting  business  in  1995
(consulting firm #1). His business partner was responsible for the overall management of
the  business.  In  other  words,  he  did  the  payroll,  accounting  and  state  and  federal  tax
returns. The business partner died unexpectedly in 1997.  Applicant continued to operate
consulting  firm  #1  but  was  not  experienced  with  running  the  business  operations,
including preparing  and filing the state and  federal tax returns for  the business.  As a result,
he neglected to file   and   pay the business’s  federal and   state tax returns as well as his
personal federal and state tax returns  beginning  in 1998.  (Tr. 44-49, 89-92)
In 2001, Applicant attended a meeting at State A, regarding filing an application
for a tax forgiveness/amnesty. He met CPA #1 at this meeting. She agreed to help him
with filing and paying his state and federal income tax returns. She also advised him on
the structure of his business. She also brought in a law firm and another accountant who
were  more  experienced  in  dealing  with  Applicant’s  issues.  Applicant  believes  CPA  #1
over-charged him. Over a two-year period, he paid her approximately $38,000. CPA # 1
only prepared two years of federal and state income tax returns as of 2003. (Tr. 49-51,
92, 101-102; AE D. enclosure 10 at 245)
CPA #1 advised him to take out a second mortgage on his home in order to resolve
his tax debt. In 2003, Applicant saved $44,000 which he intended to pay off his tax debts.
However, he lost a contract unexpectedly and needed the money to pay living expenses.
He was unemployed for approximately six months. He rehired CPA # 1 around 2004. She
filed his several years of taxes. (Tr. 50-51, 101)
Between 2003 and 2011, Applicant’s consulting business had several contracts to
work on, yet he did not file and pay federal and state taxes for the business or his personal
income taxes. He hired CPA #2 in 2011, who helped him, but referred him to CPA #3 who
was more familiar with business taxes. CPA #3 referred him to a company who would do
his  withholding,  401(k),  and  quarterly  filings  for  him.  Between  2001  to  2014,  Applicant
experienced  eight  months  without  a  contract  and  without  income.  This  delayed  his
attempts to resolve his income taxes. (Tr. 51-52, 97, 103; AE D at 1-19)
In 2016, Applicant’s son referred him to CPA #4. He prepared all  of Applicant’s
outstanding state and federal tax returns. He remains his CPA and wrote a letter indicating
all tax returns are now filed and they are in the process of negotiating an OIC with the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS)  with the federal tax debt. Applicant also hired a business
to help him prepare his payroll, withholdings, and to prepare his quarterly business and
personal income tax returns. (Tr. 52, 98, 104; AE D, enclosure 11 at 247)
Between  2016  and  2019,  Applicant  had  several  serious  health  issues  which
delayed his ability to file his income tax returns. In 2016, Applicant had what he thought
was to be routine outpatient surgery, but it became complicated when it was discovered
he had other issues. In 2018, he was diagnosed with cancer and received radiation and
therapy over the next two years. (Tr. 52, 105)
In 2016, Applicant shut down consulting firm # 1, and started consulting firm #2.
CPA  #  3  helped  him  file  his  late  federal  and  state  personal  and  business  income  tax
returns. He and his business, consulting firm #2, have timely filed and paid federal and
state income taxes for the past four years. He currently serves as a subcontractor to a
prime contractor on a DOD contract. His contract expires in August 2024. He hopes to
receive a new contract when his contract expires.  He claims that if he does not receive
another contract, he may have difficulty paying off the IRS. (Tr. 62, 80, 106-107)
The status of the SOR allegations is as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a:  Failed to timely file, as required, federal income tax returns for at least
tax  years  2010  through  2018.  All  Federal  income  tax  returns  are  filed.  The  following
indicates the dates each tax return was filed:
Tax year 2010: Return filed on September 9, 2019. (Tr. 63; GE 2 at 17-18)
Tax year 2011: Return filed on September 16, 2019. (Tr. 63; GE 2 at 19-20)
Tax year 2012: Return filed on September 16, 2019. (Tr, 63; GE 2 at 21-22)
Tax year 2013: Return filed on September 16, 2019. (Tr. 63; GE 2 at 23-24)
Tax year 2014: Return filed on November 23, 2015. (Tr. 64; GE 2 at 25-27)
Tax year 2015: Return filed on September 16, 2019. (Tr. 63; GE 2 at 28-29)
Tax year 2016: Return filed on January 6, 2020. (Tr. 64; GE 2 at 30-31)
Tax year 2017: Return filed on January 6, 2020. (Tr. 64; GE 2 at 32-33)
Tax year 2018: Return filed on January 6, 2020. (Tr. 64; GE 2 at 34-35)
Tax year 2019: Return filed on August 17, 2020. (Tr. 65; GE 2 at 36-37)
SOR ¶ 1.b: Applicant is indebted to the federal government for delinquent taxes in
the approximate amount of $223,723 for tax years 2010 through 2016: He submitted an
OIC for his  federal tax  debt  on July 7,  2022.  He offered to  pay $16,000 to  resolve his
federal tax debt. (AE D, enclosure 10 at 177-245) On August 14, 2023, the IRS rejected
the OIC because they believed the amount offered was less than Applicant’s reasonable
collection potential. The IRS determined he has $94,058 in net equity in assets. His net
monthly  income  is  $3,973.  They  also  estimated  Applicant  has  a  total  future  income  of
$353,671. As of the date of the IRS letter, the total amount of the delinquent tax debt is
$326,872. (AE A at 1-7) Applicant is appealing the denial of the OIC because he contends
his  future  income  will  not  be  $353,671.  This  future  income  is  apparently  assessed  at
working 89 months. Applicant claims this is impossible because he is 75, in poor health,
and the unreliability of competing for and being awarded contracts. The appeal is pending.
(Tr. – 65-72; AE B)
SOR ¶ 1.c: Applicant failed to timely file State A’s tax returns for tax years 2010,
2011, 2015, 2016, and 2017: He filed State A’s tax returns for tax years 2010, 2011 and
2016. (GE 2 at 38-40; AE D at 226).
SOR ¶ 1.d: Applicant was indebted to State A for delinquent taxes in the amount
of $38,595 for tax years 2010, 2011 and 2016: On November 30, 2021, he entered into a
payment plan with State A for his outstanding taxes for tax years 2010, 2011, 2016 and
2017.  He agreed to  pay monthly  payments of  $1,324. His  first installment was  due on
January 1, 2022. He consistently made these monthly payments. (AE D at 260-261) At
some point, Applicant submitted an OIC to State A. On June 1, 2023, State A accepted
the offer. State A forgave the remaining balance due towards his state income taxes. His
delinquent taxes owed to State A are resolved. (AE D at 256)
SOR ¶ 1.e:  $4,094 delinquent medical account: A March 27, 2022, credit report
indicates the account is paid. The debt is resolved. (Tr. 77; AE D at 268)
SOR ¶ 1.f: $192 delinquent medical account: Applicant attempted to resolve this
account. He was unable to locate the holder of the account despite several attempts to
locate the current creditor. I find for Applicant on this account. It is a medical bill and the
amount of the account is de minimis. It does not raise a security concern. (Tr. 78)
SOR ¶ 1.g: $206 delinquent medical account: Applicant provided proof he resolved
this account. (Tr. 79; AE D, Enclosure 16 at 265-267)
Unalleged Tax Debts
During the hearing, Applicant admitted he had not filed or paid federal taxes since
1998. CPA # 1 helped him file his federal income tax returns for 1999 and 2000. CPA #
2 helped him file his federal tax returns for tax years 2008, 2009, and 2014. (Tr. 117) His
current accountant, CPA #3, advised him that the IRS did not have his federal income tax
records before 2008. In other words, they would not pursue his federal income tax issues
between 1998 and 2007 because of the passage of time. (Tr. 112)
Applicant also disclosed that he owed State B income taxes for tax years 2011,
2012,  2013,  and  2015.  The  total  amount  owed  was  approximately  $30,000.  State  B
agreed to an OIC for $17,000. In October 2022, Applicant paid $17,000 to State B. The
state tax debt owed to State B is resolved. (Tr. 75-77, 100, 112; AE D, enclosure 15 at
263)
The failure to timely file and pay federal income taxes from 1998 to 2007 and
failure to timely file and pay state income taxes to State B were not alleged in the SOR.
In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) the Appeal Board listed five
circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:
(a)  to  assess  an  applicant’s  credibility;  (b)  to  evaluate  an  applicant’s
evidence  of  extenuation,  mitigation,  or  changed  circumstances;  (c)  to
consider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation;
(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is
applicable;  or  (e)  to  provide  evidence  for  whole-person  analysis  under
Directive Section 6.3.
Applicant’s  non-SOR  conduct  will  not  be  considered  for  disqualification  purposes,  and
consideration will be limited to the five circumstances outlined by the appeal board.
Applicant’s gross annual income is $180,000. His net annual income is $130,000.
He lives separate from his wife but pays her expenses. He will likely move back in with
her when he retires to save on expenses. He pays $1,250 a month for the condominium
he rents in State B. His  wife  lives in the residence  that  they both  own in State A. The
monthly  mortgage  payment  is  $1,150.  Between  2013  –  2023,  his  gross  income  was
approximately  $150,000.  During  this  time,  Applicant  was  out  of  work  for  a  total  of  two
years  when  he  was  without  a  contract,  so  his  gross  annual  income  was  more  like
$130,000. His wife is a retired school teacher. Her retirement pay is $250 a month and
with her social security, she earns approximately $1,150 a month. (Tr. 111-112)
Applicant has not made payments towards his federal back taxes. He is waiting for
the outcome of his appeal regarding the denial of his OIC to settle. He states that CPA
#4  advised  him  to  not  make  payments  towards  his  back  taxes  because  the  payments
would not count as part of the OIC. Applicant was making double payments towards his
mortgage in hopes of paying off his mortgage before he retires. (Tr. 112 -114)
Whole-person Evidence
Mr. Z is a senior official of a DOD Agency. He has held a security clearance for
over 20 years. He has known and worked with Applicant over 20 years. Applicant currently
works as a contractor for his agency. He describes his duty performance as outstanding.
He ranks him in the top 1% of all analysts he has worked with. He is aware of the issues
in  the  SOR.  He  believes  Applicant  has  good  judgment.  He  has  a  unique  skillset.  He
believes it would be a loss if he were not able to work. He recommends him for a position
of trustworthiness. (Tr. 19-25; AE 2, Enclosure 9, at 173-174)
Colonel  (Retired)  P  served  30  years  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  Army.  Applicant
worked with him as a contractor on several projects in 2003 while Colonel P was still on
active  duty.  Applicant  secured  millions  of  dollars  in  funding  for  several  projects.  He
worked  hard  behind  the  scenes  to  resolve  the  project’s  problems.  He  is  aware  of  the
issues related to Applicant’s trustworthiness investigation. He is confident the issues with
the IRS will be resolved soon. He believes Applicant’s long tenure as a DOD contractor
should be considered. (AE D, Enclosure 9 at 175-176)
Two  of  Applicant’s  sons  testified  on  his  behalf.  His  oldest  son  testified  that
Applicant is a good father who always provided for his family. Applicant reached out to
him around 2010 - 2011 regarding his tax issues and asked him for advice. He told his
father to hire a tax attorney and a CPA. They have discussed his father’s tax problems
for several years. He referred his father to his personal CPA, CPA #4, who helped his
father with filing his delinquent tax returns. His father resolved the state tax issues and is
working diligently to resolve the federal tax issues through an OIC. He believes after his
father’s business partner died, his father did not know what needed to be done on the
business  side  of  the  firm.  He  was  also  unemployed  on  an  intermittent  basis,  so  he
struggled with getting things on track. His father lives within his means. He drives a car
that is 20 years-old and has rented an affordable condominium over the past 12 years.
Aside from the tax issues, his father has no other issues. He is a forthright person who is
dedicated to his career. He has always supported him. (Tr. 27-34)
His youngest son is an active-duty Air Force major who has served in the military
for 14 years. He is aware of his father’s tax issues. His father resolved the state tax issues
through approved OICs and is still negotiating the resolution of the federal tax issues with
the IRS. His father is good with money and is not an extravagant spender. He has always
been a good father. He describes his father as trustworthy and reliable. He possesses
the characteristics of a security clearance holder. (Tr. 36-42)
