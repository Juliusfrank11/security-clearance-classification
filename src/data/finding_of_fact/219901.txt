In his Answer, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.d and denied
SOR  ¶¶  1.a-2.a.  He  is  57  years  old.  He  graduated  from  high  school  in  1985,  and  he
earned a bachelor’s degree in 1990 and a master’s degree in 2018. He married in 1995,
divorced  in  2020,  and  remarried  in  2022.  He  has  a  25-year-old  son  from  his  previous
marriage, and he still considers his 31-year-old stepdaughter from his previous marriage
his child, despite their limited relationship. He resides in state A. (Tr. 33-35, 37, 73-74,
146-148, 154-157; GE 1-3; AE A, J, M, P, Q)
Applicant  commissioned   in   the   U.S.   military   upon   graduating   from   college.  He
served  honorably  from  May  1990  to  April  2011, to  include  deployments to  Haiti,  Bosnia,
and   Afghanistan,  and   he   retired   as  a   lieutenant  colonel.   He   was  subsequently
unemployed   until   November  2011.   He   has   since   worked   for  various  DOD  contractors,
except   for  additional  periods  of  unemployment  from   November   2016   to   June   2017,
September 2018  to  December 2018,  and  since  approximately September  2020. As  of the
date   of  the   hearing,  he   had   an   offer  of  employment  with   a   DOD   contractor  that  was
contingent  on  obtaining  a  security clearance.  He was first granted  a  clearance  when  he
served in the U.S. military, and  his clearance  was suspended  in  September 2020.  (Tr. 9-
11, 35-37, 42, 50-51, 77-78, 151-152, 157-158; GE  1-3, 5-6; AE J, R, T)
Personal Conduct
In 1995, Applicant was charged with simple assault. On the night of his bachelor
party,  he  got  into  a  physical  altercation  with  a  fraternity  brother.  They  resolved  their
conflict and remained friends. Unbeknownst to them, the charge remained pending in the
court system until Applicant’s friend requested its dismissal in 2012. (Tr. 37-41; AE L)
Prior  to  deploying  to  Bosnia,  Applicant  had  a  verbal  disagreement  with  another
soldier in 2002. The soldier pushed him, and he choked the soldier to get the soldier out
of his way. He reported the incident to his superior, and he was not disciplined for this
incident. (Tr. 140-144; AE J)
In  August  2002,  while  deployed  to  Bosnia,  Applicant  was  the  subject  of  an
investigation by the Army Criminal Investigation Division for aggravated assault. He was
on patrol with his team as the communications officer when some of the communications
failed.  He  returned  to  the  military  base  and  immediately  approached  the  desk  of  the
civilian  contractor,  who  was  the  lead  communications  help  desk  technician,  to  try  to
troubleshoot the issues. He denied pulling his weapon from his holster, pointing it at, and
verbally  threatening  this  individual.  Because  he  breached  protocol  by  not  properly
disarming his weapon upon returning to the base and approaching this individual’s desk,
he disassembled it on  the  “help  desk  ledge.”  He did  so  while he  was  having  a heated
conversation with this individual wherein profanity was exchanged, and he warned that
he would elevate the communications failures to the individual’s supervisor. (SOR ¶ 1.d;
Tr. 41-50, 131-140, 158-163, 170-172; GE 2-3, 6, 8; AE J)
Applicant testified that he recognized how his act of disassembling his weapon on
the help desk technician’s ledge while they were having a heated conversation could have
been perceived by this individual as an intimidation tactic or threat, but he stated that such
was not his intention. He and this individual had previous and reoccurring  conflict with
each other. He recalled later apologizing to this individual and voluntarily surrendering his
weapon during the remaining two to three weeks of his deployment as an act of good
faith. He was not court-martialed, he did not receive an Article 15 non-judicial punishment,
he was not administratively reprimanded or counseled, and this incident did not have a
negative impact on his military career. (Tr. 41-50, 131-140, 158-163, 170-172; GE 2-3, 6,
8; AE J)
In  February 2015, Applicant  was arrested  in state  C  and  charged  with  felony gun
possession   on   education   property,  misdemeanor  assault  by  pointing   a   gun,   and
misdemeanor  communicating  threats.  Between  2003  and  2005,  he  had  purchased  from
the  military post  exchange   several firearms  for which   he   had  a   non-residence   conceal
and  carry permit from  state  B.  The  morning  of his arrest  in 2015, he  intended  to  go  to  the
firing   range   with   one   of  his  firearms,  so   he   disassembled   it   and   put  it,   along   with   one
magazine,  in  a   case   that  he   then   put  in   the   trunk  of  his  car.  He  also  put  a   separate
magazine  and ammunition  in  the  trunk of his car, as they  would  not fit in his  case. When
he  went back inside  his  home  to  say good-bye  to  his then  spouse, she  was crying  on  the
phone   with   his  stepdaughter,  who   was  attending   college   in  state   C.  Concerned   about
reports  that   his  stepdaughter  was  having   loud   parties,  drinking   excessively,  and   using
drugs, he  changed  his plans  at his then  spouse’s request  and  drove  from  state  A  to  state
C  to  bring  his stepdaughter home. He mistakenly did not  think to  remove  his firearm  from
the trunk of his car beforehand. (SOR ¶ 1.c;  Tr. 51-62, 78-100, 163-167, 169-170; GE  1-
3, 5-6; AE E-H, J)
Applicant’s  stepdaughter  refused  to  cooperate  with  him  when  he  arrived  at  her
apartment in state C. He decided to retrieve her things from her car, put them in his car,
and  park  her  car  at  his  friend’s  house  for  him  to  retrieve  later.  As  he  was  putting  her
belongings in his car, her girlfriend saw his firearm, which had fallen out of its case that
opened during his drive from state A to state C, as he was attempting to put it back in its
case. They got into a heated exchange, and he decided to leave and drive to his friend’s
house. (Tr. 51-62, 78-100, 163-167, 169-170; GE 1-3, 5-6; AE E-H, J)
As Applicant drove to his friend’s house, his then spouse called and told him that
the  police  were  looking  for  him.  His  stepdaughter’s  girlfriend  reported  that  he  “had
threatened her by pointing a firearm at her and saying I was going to blow her head off or
something to that extent,” which he denied. He reacted to this news “very poorly.” He did
not want to have any issues with the police, and although he had a firearm permit for state
B, he did not remember that state C had reciprocity with state B for concealed handguns.
He drove into a parking lot that he did not know was on educational property, he loaded
his firearm with one of the magazines, and he hid it along with the additional magazine
and ammunition under a bush. He stated that he loaded the firearm because he “was just
putting it all together just to get all the evidence out of the car.” The police pulled him over
as he was driving to his friend’s house, and when they questioned him about whether he
had a firearm, he replied that he did not. They put him in the police car, searched his car,
and drove him to his stepdaughter’s apartment for identification. There, they asked him
where  his gun  was,  and  he  cooperated  and took them to the location  where  he  had  it
hidden. The police recovered his gun, arrested and charged him, and he was released
on bail. The charges were voluntarily dismissed in March 2015 and expunged in February
2016. (Tr. 51-62, 78-100, 163-167, 169-170; GE 1-3, 5-6; AE E-H, J)
In April 2017, Applicant was in a physical altercation with his then spouse. They
consumed alcohol at a friend’s home earlier that evening and got into an argument upon
their arrival at home. When their argument escalated, she struck him across his chest,
threw her cell phone at him, and hit him in the back as he walked away. He turned and
punched  her  in  the  face,  causing  her  to  suffer  an orbital fracture.  No  criminal  charges
were filed against him. (SOR ¶ 1.b; Tr. 62-67, 116-117, 119-126, 149-151, 155, 170-172;
GE 2-3, 5-6; AE C, D, J, K, M, T) He testified:
[U]nder  no  circumstances should  a  man  ever hit  a  woman,  no  matter what
the  situation  is. No mater what the  situation, you  still  have  the  choice to  walk
away.  I did not   exercise  my choice   to   do  so.  I’m  extremely remorseful for
what I did. (Tr. 64)
This  incident  led  to  a  two-to-three-week period of  separation between Applicant
and his then spouse. He voluntarily took a 16-hour anger management class in April 2017,
through which he learned coping skills and methods to de-escalate a situation. At his then
spouse’s request, he surrendered his firearms to the police and sought an evaluation from
the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to determine if he suffered from PTSD. He
saw a VA doctor once, and he was not given a diagnosis. He also obtained a referral from
his general practitioner for a psychiatrist, whom he saw six to seven times over the course
of  four  to  five  weeks  in  June  or  July  2017.  This  psychiatrist  also  did  not  give  him  a
diagnosis. He and his then spouse also attended marriage counseling, which he found
useful. (Tr. 62-67, 71-72, 116-117, 119-126, 149-151, 155, 170-175; GE 2-3, 5-6; AE C,
D, J, K, M, T) He testified:
I found  out there were  tools and  things that I  could use  to  understand  the
situation  better  and  to better approach  situations when they  do  get heated:
one, just walk, disengage; everything  doesn’t need  to  be  resolved  right then
and  there; let cool heads prevail, things of that nature. (Tr. 65)
In   approximately  2018,  Applicant   and   his  then   spouse   had   multiple  occasions
where  their   son   was  “.  .  .  very  disrespectful,  using   profanity,  and   .  .  .  yelling,”  having
removed  him  from  college  because  of poor grades, alcohol consumption,  and  drug  use.
(Tr. 146)  Applicant  recalled  one  incident  where  his  son  “struck  me  in  the  face  with  a  closed
fist,” and  another incident where  his son  “pulled  knife  out on  me  asking  to  fight. So, I took
him  and  pushed  him  against  a  wall, and  I asked  him  to   . . . leave  the  house.” His then
spouse  took their  son  and stayed  with  him  at her daughter’s apartment for a  couple of
days. His son  was diagnosed  with  bipolar disorder in 2021  or 2022. (Tr. 73, 146-147, 155-
157)
In  July  2019,  Applicant  engaged  in  another  altercation  with  his  then  spouse.  In
2018, he replaced the firearms that he had previously surrendered, and on the morning
of July 2019, he worked on one of his firearms in his garage. He subsequently placed the
firearm on a counter inside the home. When his then spouse finished preparing dinner
that evening, he secured the firearm in an upstairs safe. He denied having left the firearm
in his garage and stated that his then spouse saw him take the firearm upstairs to secure
it.  Over  dinner,  they  argued  about  an  invitation  to  attend  a  neighbor’s  cookout.  She
wanted to attend but he did not, as he no longer desired that kind of environment and did
not like that this neighbor had previously made disparaging comments about her. Their
argument continued as she followed him when he returned to his garage to work on one
of his cars. (SOR ¶ 1.a; Tr. 66-71, 100-119, 122-123, 155-156, 167-172; GE 2-3, 6-7; AE
B, J) He testified:
We  were  in the  garage  initially. I did break the  antenna  off of a  joint  on  the
car that we both  owned, and  I threw it out the  garage. And  I did kick the  car
tire,  the  actual rubber that touches the  road. Both  are very immature actions.
(Tr. 69)
Applicant’s then  spouse  called  the  police  and  reported  that  he  struck her  with  an
antenna   and   pointed   a   firearm   at  her,  which   he   denied.  He   was  not  arrested,   and   no
criminal charges  were  filed  against him.  Early  the  next morning,  the  sheriff’s department
served  him  with  a  temporary  48-hour  restraining  order  that  was subsequently extended
for an  additional  week. He  surrendered  his  firearms  as required  by  the  order.   His then
spouse  also  filed  for divorce, at which  point she  pressed  charges against  him  for second-
degree  assault  and malicious destruction  of  property  and  obtained a  one-year protective
order against  him.   He   was  ordered   to   pay   for  the   property  damage,  the   charges   were
dropped, and  the  records pertaining  to  this incident were  expunged  in  August 2020. After
their  requisite  one-year period  of separation, their  divorce  was finalized  in 2020. (Tr. 66-
71,100-119, 122-123, 155-156, 167-172; GE  2-3, 6-7; AE B, J)
Since 2019, Applicant has not faced any other allegations of misconduct. He is not
prohibited from owning firearms. Applicant’s son moved in with him during the period in
which he and his then spouse were separated and going through divorce proceedings.
Applicant  helped  his  son  enroll  in  school,  get  his  driver’s  license,  and  attend  church.
Although  his  son  lived  with  his  ex-spouse  as  of  the  date  of  the  hearing,  Applicant
described his relationship with his son as a healthy one. He has a limited relationship with
his stepdaughter, due to her unfounded rape allegations against him during the divorce
proceedings. Although Applicant and his spouse have disagreements, he stated that they
do not compare to those he had with his ex-spouse, to which he credits his spouse’s calm
demeanor, their marriage, and his spirituality. (Tr. 74, 146-148, 157, 168-169, 171-172;
AE N-O)
Applicant stated:
Simply put,  I’m  a  changed  man. I acknowledged  the  mistakes that I did.  I
realized  that  I  was in  a  volatile  marriage,  didn’t want  to  admit  it at the  time.
Being  [a  military] officer, we try to  fix everything. Everything  is repairable.
We  can  always solve  every mission,  and  I  put that  attitude,  looking  back,
took that same  approach  into my marriage. It can be  repaired. That can be
repaired.  And  I  just  refused  to  believe  that  some  things  are  irreparable.  And
that  applied   to   my  marriage.  I  found   Christ.   I  found   other  coping
mechanisms. I’ve  changed. I  no  longer get upset  for  the  things  that will   --
would  normally  get  me   angry  or  out  of  character,  and   I’ve   learned   to   be
better in control of me  and  everything is truly not that important. (Tr. 72-73)
Psychological  Conditions
In  December  2010  Applicant  was  evaluated  by  the  VA  in  connection  with  his
disability claim. (Tr. 71-72, 125-129, 172-175; GE 2) A VA examiner diagnosed him with
adjustment disorder in June 2011, but noted that there was “no evidence of permanent
residual or chronic disability shown” and his symptoms were not consistent with PTSD.
(AE  T)  The  VA  consequently  denied  his  “[s]ervice  connection  for  adjustment  disorder
(claimed as [PTSD]),” but found that he was entitled to treatment because an adjustment
disorder was diagnosed within the requisite time. (AE T)
As  previously discussed,  Applicant  sought  an   evaluation   from   the   VA   at  his ex-
spouse’s request after the  incident in  April 2017, to  determine  if he  suffered  from  PTSD.
He also saw a  psychiatrist in June  or July 2017. He  was not  given  a  diagnosis  on  either
occasion. (Tr. 62-67, 71-72, 116-117, 119-126, 149-151, 172-175; GE  2-3, 5-6; AE  C, D,
J, K, M, T)
In March 2018, Applicant was again evaluated by the VA, in connection with  his
claim for increased evaluation. (Tr. 71-72, 125-129, 172-175; GE 2) The VA again denied
his “[s]ervice  connection  for adjustment disorder (claimed  as PTSD),” after finding  that
the  treatment  records  submitted  by  him  in  connection  with  his  2018  claim  did  not
constitute new and material evidence. (AE T) As of the date of the hearing, he has had a
100% disability rating from the VA since 2021, but not on the basis of any mental health
condition. (Tr. 126-127, 172-175)
In  July  2021,  the  DOD  CAF,  renamed  the  Defense  Counterintelligence  and
Security  Agency  on  June  13,  2022,  referred  Applicant  for  evaluation  by  a  licensed
psychologist  (PSYCH  1)  because  evidence  of  a  history  of  mental  health  conditions
requiring
treatment  was  discovered  during  his  security  clearance  background
investigation. (SOR ¶ 2.a; Tr. 148-149; GE 3) PSYCH 1 conducted her evaluation on July
8, 2021, and she reported her findings on July 18, 2021. PSYCH 1 stated, as the basis
for her opinion, that “[Applicant] has an extensive history of criminal behavior and legal
involvement  since  the  1990s.  Additionally,  there  is  evidence  that  he  has  a  pattern  of
brandishing  guns  and  becoming  violent  [and]  aggressive  when  he  is  upset.”  (GE  3)
PSYCH  1  also  stated  that  her  evaluation  included  “review  of  background  information,
including medical and mental health  treatment records provided by the DOD CAF” and
“[a]dditional  data  was  collected  via  clinical  interview,  testing  observations,  and
administration of the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI).” (Tr. 148-149; GE 3)
PSYCH 1 provided the following diagnostic impressions and prognosis:
Based   solely  on   [Applicant’s]  self-report,  it  would  seem   that  he   does  not
currently  meet   criteria   for  any  diagnosable  mental  health   conditions.
However, when  considering  background  information,  clinical interview and
observations,  and  objective  personality  assessment,  his diagnostic profile
is as follows:
309.81
V62.22
V62.5
[PTSD]
Personal history of Military Deployment
Problems Related to Other Legal Circumstances
While   it  is  challenging   to   conclusively   diagnose   PTSD  in   a   one-time
evaluation, particularly if there is no  supporting  medical history, [Applicant’s]
background  history is noteworthy  for extensive criminal conduct and  violent
behavior. Since  the  1990s, he  has demonstrated  1) irritable behavior and
angry  outbursts;  2)  reckless  behaviors;   and   3)  dissociative   reactions  in
which  he  acts  as  if the  traumatic event were recurring.  These  behaviors are
symptomatic of PTSD and  have  clearly negatively  impacted  his social and
occupational functioning. (GE 3)
PSYCH 1 concluded:
[Applicant’s]  behavioral  health   history  suggests  several  behaviors,   which
cast doubt  on  his judgment,  reliability and/or trustworthiness. His  history of
interpersonal  volatility  and  legal involvement is concerning,  and  his  limited
insight and  pattern of grandiosity (in  speech,  thought, and  behavior) may
indicate  a  poor prognosis. Despite  claims that  he  and  his ex-spouse  are on
amicable  terms  and   a   judge   awarded   him   physical  custody  of  their  son,
these  claims could not be  independently verified  and  court records indicate
that  his [ex-]wife  extended  the  no-contact  protective  order  through  at least
July 2020.  Given  the  recent  nature  of  [Applicant’s] issues,  and  the  fact that
he  lacks  the  requisite  insight  and  treatment to  reduce  the  likelihood  of future
violent  behavior,  it  may  be   imprudent  to   grant  him   access  to   classified
information. (GE  3)
Applicant was evaluated by another licensed psychologist (PSYCH 2) in January
2023, on the advice of his attorney. PSYCH 2 stated that her evaluation included review
of the SOR; PSYCH 1’s July 18, 2021 summary of psychological evaluation; Applicant’s
January  19,  2022  response  to  interrogatories;  and  “[m]iscellaneous  records  from
[Applicant’s] background investigation.” (Tr. 123-131, 134-139, 152-154; AE I-J) PSYCH
2  also  stated  that  additional  data  was  collected  via  “semi-structured  clinical  interview,
observations,  and  administration  of  objective  personality  measure,  the  .  .  .  [PAI]  ,  and
subjective  report of  symptoms  .  .  .  .”  (Tr.  123-131,  134-139,  152-154;  AE  J)  Applicant
acknowledged that PSYCH 2 did not speak with any of his family or friends, to include his
ex-spouse. (Tr. 153-154)
PSYCH  2  stated  that Applicant “does not appear to  meet diagnostic criteria  for any
mental health  conditions at this time,” and  she  concluded  that Applicant does not currently
have  a  mental health  diagnosis that  could cast doubt  on  his  reliability, trustworthiness,
judgment,   or ability  to   safeguard  sensitive   or   classified   information.   (Tr.  123-131,   134-
139; AE J) PSYCH 2  stated:
I did not  find  evidence  to  support a  diagnosis of  [PTSD]. While  [Applicant]
has a  history of military deployment,  this does not independently cause  a
mental  health   condition.  Additionally,  although   Applicant  did  endorse  a
number  of  individual   items  within  his  PAI  that  elevated   a   subscale
commensurate  with  traumatic events, upon  further evaluation  of  those  items
one  finds  reflection  of  reactions commensurate  with  frustration  noted  above
related  to  his relationship with  his ex-wife  and  the  process  that led  to  him
losing his security clearance. . . . (AE J)
Applicant’s 1995 simple assault charge, 2002 verbal and physical altercation with
a soldier, 2011 adjustment disorder diagnosis by the VA, and 2018 physical altercation
with his son were not alleged in the SOR, so they may not be an independent basis for
revoking Applicant’s clearance. However, I may consider them to evaluate his credibility;
to evaluate his evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; to decide
whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or to provide
evidence  for  the  whole-person  analysis.  I  have  considered  these  unalleged  events  for
these limited purposes.
Applicant  received   numerous  certificates  and   medals,   to   include   a   Meritorious
Service   Medal  for  his  service   in  Bosnia,   a  Bronze   Star  Medal   for  his  service   in
Afghanistan,  and  a  Legion  of Merit medal upon  his military retirement  for exceptionally
meritorious  service. (Tr. 50-51, 144-146; AE  J, R)  He volunteers in his community.  (AE
S)  Numerous   character  references,   to   include   individuals  who   have   known   Applicant
since their service in the U.S. military and who have remained  close  friends, vouched for
his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. (AE M) His officer evaluation reports reflect
outstanding performance in the U.S. military. (Tr. 49-50; AE R)
