In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b,  and  1.d  with
explanations and denied the allegations  in SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.e, with explanations. His
admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 40-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been working
for his current employer as lead warehouse technician since September 2021. He testified
he previously held a clearance for 12 years. (Tr. at 21, 22-23.) He also works in the music
department  for  his  church  and  multiple  entertainment  companies  doing  weddings  and
corporate events. He has worked at his church since 2010. He has been with one of the
entertainment  companies  for  two  years  and  with  the  other  since  2011.  (Tr.  at  25.)  He
offered character letters from his church and work evidence attesting to his work ethic,
integrity, and commitment to family. (AE A; AE B.)
He married in September 2016 and has two children, one high school age and the
other  starting  grade  school.  A  high  school  graduate,  he  has  started  taking  computer
courses to reach a certification level. (Tr. at 22; GE 1 at 12-13, 22 25, 27.)
SOR  ¶   1.a:  Applicant   failed   to   timely   file,   as   required,  Federal   income   tax
returns  for tax  years  2016  through  2021  and as  of  the  date  of  the  SOR  tax  returns
Applicant admits  this  allegation.
for  tax   years   2016,  2017,  and 2021   remain  unfiled.
The income tax transcript for 2016 shows no tax return filed in 2016 as of December 28,
2022. (GE 5.) After the hearing closed, he offered a 2016 Federal tax return signed by
him on October 3, 2023, and an October 3, 2023 receipt from a commercial tax preparer.
(AE I; AE K.) He cited losing his job in 2015 for getting “off track.” (GE 5; Tr. at 27-28.) He
did not provide a tax transcript for 2017. He was not sure if the 2017 tax return were filed
and he believed they had filed an extension. (Tr. at 31.) He acknowledged his failure to
file his 2018 tax returns on his SCA and in his security clearance interview. He cited in his
security  clearance  interview  losing  his  job  in  February  2018;  learning  his  wife  was
pregnant in March 2018; having to move; and that his wife was in charge of filing their tax
returns and he never asked about them. He stated the reason the 2018 tax return had
been filed in August 2022 was to get caught up because they were looking to purchase a
home. (GE 1 at 39; GE 2; Tr. at 32.) He told the investigator in July 2020 he thought the
2019 and 2020 tax returns had been filed. (GE 2 at 3.) The tax transcript for 2019 reflects
he and his wife filed for an extension but that the tax return was not filed until May 2022.
(GE 5; Tr. at 35.) He filed his 2020 tax return in June of 2022. (GE 5; Tr. 36.) He received
a  notice that  his  request  for  an  extension  for  his  2021  Federal  tax  return  had  been
accepted on April 19, 2022. (GE 5 at 1-2; AE D.) He testified that “The only thing I can
say is … we should have went through an actual tax professional instead of trying to do
it ourselves.” (Tr. at 37.) The October 2023 tax transcript for tax year 2022 shows that he
had filed a request for an extension of time on April 15, 2022, but as of October 2023 his
tax year 2022 tax return had not been filed. (AE C; AE G; Tr. at 36-37.)
SOR ¶  1.b: Applicant  failed to  timely  file, as  required, state  income  tax  returns
for tax  years  2016  through  2021  and  as  of the  date of  the  SOR  tax  returns  for tax
years   2016,  2017,  and 2021   remain  unfiled.  Applicant admitted the allegation. In his
Answer he states he had filed an extension for “2017 and going forward.” (Answer.) He
acknowledges he was a resident of his state in the time period in question. For 2016 he
testified “I don't believe my [state] would be filed either.” For 2017 he had no answer and
stated he would have to log in to his portal. For the remaining years he stated “honestly,
have  to  go  through  our records to  see.”  (AE D; Tr. at 39.) After the hearing closed, he
offered a 2016 state income tax return signed by him on October 3, 2023, and an October
3, 2023 receipt from a commercial tax preparer. (AE J; AE K.) No other state returns were
offered.
SOR  ¶   1.c:  Applicant   is   indebted  to   the   Federal  government   in  the
approximate amount  of  $560  for  delinquent taxes  for tax  year 2018. As of  the  date
of  the  SOR the  account  remains  delinquent. Applicant denied the debt and states in
his Answer he and his spouse are “engaged” in a payment plan for the debt and that he
thought it was resolved.  (Answer) The IRS amount balance shows him owing $560. (GE
5 at 3.) In response to Government interrogatories, he provided an untitled receipt dated
July 22, 2022, reflecting a credit card payment for “individual tax return payments” in the
amount of $115.34. (GE 4 at 9.)
SOR ¶  1.d: Applicant  is  indebted to  a  creditor for a store  account  that has
been placed in collection  in the  approximate amount  of  $1,450. As  of  the  date  of
the   SOR  the   account   remains   delinquent.  In   his Answer,   Applicant  admits   this debt
and  states he  is  in a  weekly payment  plan. (Answer.) In  his testimony he  admitted  he  was
taken  to  court and  a  2022  judgment was awarded  to  the  creditor. (Tr. at 41; GE  9.)  He
blamed   the   COVID  pandemic  for  falling   behind   on   his  payments   stating,  “I  had   been
making  the  payments  correctly and  had  no  issues, and  then  I hate  to  keep  bringing  up
2020, but  happened  and  COVID and  everything  just kind  of got thrown.  Everything  just
kind  of got thrown off so I missed some payments and didn't, unfortunately did not reach
out to  them  to  tell  them  that  I was  in financial straits…so  they submitted  my  account to
[the  creditor].”  (Tr. at 41-42.) He offered  AE  H showing  he  made  twelve  payments from
January 13, 2023, through  April 10, 2023, totaling $1,601.40.
SOR ¶  1.e: Applicant  is  indebted  for a  store  account  that has  been  placed for
collection   in   the   approximate   amount   of   $1,970.   As   of   the   date  of   the   SOR  the

the debt had been paid in full. He testified the reason it became delinquent was because
he lost his job shortly after he had purchased  an engagement ring and with the loss of
wages his payments slowed and eventually stopped. He stated he tried “a few times to
start back up paying it periodically but was not successful unfortunately.” (Tr. at 45.) In
late 2020, the creditor took him to court and a default judgment was obtained in January
2021. (Tr. at 45; GE 8.) He testified he paid it in full around November 2022. (Tr. at 46.)
In  response  to  Government  interrogatories  dated  October  13,  2021,  and  February  28,
2022, he marked the debt was not paid; that he was making payments; and that he had
not attached documentation showing payment status or proof of payments. (GE at 4; GE
at 4.) A January 2023 credit report shows the debt as a charge-off; with a last payment in
February  2021;  and  the  first  major  delinquency  in  November  2018.  The  account  was
opened  in  March  2014.  (GE  at  6.)  He  told  the  investigator  he  had  missed  payments
because  he  was  paying  for  the  wedding  and  could  not  afford  both.  (GE  2  at  3.)  He
travelled  overseas  twice  in  2016  for  tourism,  with  both  trips  occurring  after  his  2016
wedding. (GE 1 at 31, 33.)
