Financial Considerations
for
On  April  8,  2022,  Applicant  submitted  an  Electronic  Questionnaires
Investigations  Processing  (e-QIP).  (GE  1)  A  subsequent  background  investigation

The delinquent accounts include a $528 federal tax debt for delinquent taxes for

apartment complex placed for collection (SOR ¶ 1.i: GE 2 at 14-15; GE 4 at 3; GE 5 at
2).
Additional  delinquent   debts   include   a   $1,070   delinquent  credit   card  account
placed   for   collection   (SOR  ¶   1.j:   GE   2   at  15-16;  GE   3   at  9;   GE   4   at   4);   a   $1,040
delinquent credit  card account that was charged  off  (SOR ¶  1.k: GE  2  at 16; GE  3  at 8;
GE  4  at 4);  a  $968 delinquent credit  card  account  placed  for collection  (SOR ¶  1.l:  GE  2
at 16; GE  3  at  6; GE  4  at 4); a  $652  delinquent credit  card account that was  charged  off

5   at 5);   a   $300  delinquent   student   loan   account   that   was placed  for collection   (SOR ¶
1.p:   GE   2   6;  GE   3   at   5;  GE   4   at   5);  a   $294   delinquent  student   loan   account   that  was

television  account that  was placed  for collection (SOR ¶  1.r: GE  2  at 17;  GE  4  at 6;  GE
5   at   3);   and   a  home   mortgage   loan   that  went  into   foreclosure  in   2016;  the   balance
owed, if any, is unknown  (SOR ¶ 1.s: GE  4  at 7).
In  her  response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  denies  the  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  1.o  and
admits  the  remaining  SOR  allegations.  She  indicates  most  of  the  debts  were  incurred
between  2014  –  2017.  She  incurred  the  credit  card debts  during  times  when  she  was
unemployed.  She  was  laid  off  twice  within  a  four-year  time  span.  The  foreclosure
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.s occurred at a time when she owned two homes. One was a rental
property  and  she  lived  in  the  other  one.  The  tenant  in  the  rental  property  broke  her
lease  at  a  time  when  Applicant  was  unemployed.  She  claims  she  had  to  choose
between the two houses and let the rental property go to foreclosure. She testified that
the 2016 foreclosure is no longer in her credit report. She is not certain how much was
owed  after  the  foreclosure.  (Tr.  39-40)  The  apartment  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.f
occurred because she was laid off and had to move out. She moved to state 1 where
she thought the cost of living would be cheaper. (Answer to SOR)
Applicant  did not file  federal and  state  income  taxes  for tax  year  2018  because
she  was  a  full-time  student  at  the  time  who  worked  part-time  jobs.  She  believed  her
gross  income  was  under  the  limit.  She  discovered  the  tax  return  needed  to  be  filed
when applying for financial aid for her daughter’s education. (Answer to SOR) She filed
the 2018 federal income tax return on June 21, 2021. She owes the IRS $528.73 for tax
year  2018;  and  $464.84  for  tax  year  2019.  She  has  not  filed  her  federal  income  tax
return for tax year 2021. (Tr. 26-27, 30-35; GE 2 at 24-27; 30) She testified that she is
not sure whether she filed her state income tax returns for tax years 2018 and 2021. (Tr.
36-37) She also testified that she did not file federal or state income tax returns for tax
year 2022. (Tr. 27, 37-38)
Applicant has not paid or resolved the remaining SOR debts, SOR ¶¶ 1.e  –  1.r.
She disputes the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.f, and 1.l. She submitted disputes with the
credit  reporting  agencies.  After  some  research,  the  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.l  was
confirmed  as  valid.  She  testified  she  has  to  prove  that  it  is  not  her  debt,  but  has  not
followed through the dispute. She has not received a response regarding her dispute of
the debt in SOR ¶ 1.f. (Tr. 41-43)
Applicant has paid off several debts that were not alleged in the SOR. (Tr. 42) At
the end of the hearing, Applicant mentioned that she is considering filing for bankruptcy.
She has consulted two bankruptcy attorneys but has not hired one yet. (Tr. 47-48) After
the hearing, she provided a receipt for a payment made to her college in the amount of
$504.90. (AE H) It is unclear if this relates to the student loan debts alleged in SOR ¶¶
1.p and 1.q.
Applicant keeps a budget, but it is not written down. She currently earns between
$83,000 and $85,000 annually. She occasionally provides support to her daughter who
recently graduated from college. Her net monthly income is approximately $4,200. Her
total monthly expenses are approximately $2,500. She rents a home with her daughter
and  son-in-law.  They  each  contribute  one  third  to  the  household  expenses.  She  has
about  $900  in  her  checking  account,  $500  in  a  savings  account,  and  $15,000  in  a
retirement  account.  She  tries  to  save  $1,000  a month,  but  recently  had  expensive  car
repairs that cost between $5,000 and $6,000. (Tr. 17-24)
Her financial problems began when she was laid off in 2015.  She was also laid
off  in  2016  and  2017.  Between  August  2014  to  December  2017,  she  was  a  full-time
college student who worked part-time. She attended college using the GI Bill.  She was
unemployed  between  February  2019  to  August  2019.  She  lived  off  her  savings  and
worked  part-time  in  a  grocery  store.  (Tr.  28-30)  She  also  has  a  chronic  medical
condition. (Tr. 49)
Applicant’s integrity is very important to her. Her divorce and health issues have
made  things  challenging.  She  has  a  strong  allegiance  to  the  United  States.  She  has
been waiting for an opportunity to get a security clearance for 15 years. Obtaining and
keeping a security clearance is important to her. (Answer to SOR)

R.,  her  current  supervisor,  highly  recommends  Applicant  be  granted  a  security

positive  relationship  with  Applicant.  She  has  always  conducted  herself  with
professionalism and dignity. When they were dating, she took care of his elderly mother
while he was on deployment. She possesses the qualities necessary to hold a security
clearance. (AE E)
Other co-workers and former co-workers have said similar favorable things about
Applicant. (AE F; AE G)
