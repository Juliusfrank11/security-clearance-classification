Applicant is a 48-year-old, single man. He has been married twice previously. Both
marriages ended in divorce, most recently in 2019. (Item 3 at 26-27) He is a veteran of
the U.S. Air Force, serving from 1995 to 1999. He was discharged honorably. (Response
to Interrogatories (Item 3 at 11).He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2016 and a master’s
degree in 2018. (Item 3 at 13) He has been working for a defense contractor as a data
analyst since 2016. (Item 3 at 14)
The SOR alleges Applicant has been struggling with recurrent financial problems
for  more  than  15  years.  In  July  2011,  he  filed  for  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  protection,  as
alleged in subparagraph 1.k. (Item 1 at 41; Item 1 at 5) In October 2011, the court granted
the petition, discharging approximately $41,000 of delinquent debt. (Item 11)
In
the  seven  years  after
the  bankruptcy  discharge,  Applicant
incurred
approximately  $19,000  of  additional  delinquent  debt,  including  the  debts  alleged  in
subparagraphs 1.e, totaling $2,335; 1.f, totaling $863; 1.h, totaling $2,589; and 1.i, totaling
$13,543. (Item 8 at 1-3) Applicant enrolled in a debt-consolidation plan and began making
payments through the plan in 2018. (Item 8 at 6) Although he made consistent payments
for four years, he never finished the payment plan because he became ensnared in an
online  romance  scam  in  2022  in  which  he  was  duped  into  sending  multiple  payments
totaling  $15,000  to  an  anonymous  online  person  masquerading  as  a  potential  love
interest.  (Item 4 at 2;  Item 8 at 6)  Because  of the  scam,  two additional accounts, as
alleged in subparagraphs 1.g, and 1.j, totaling approximately $1,800, that Applicant had
opened after the debt consolidation, became delinquent. Both were charged off  by the
fall of  2022. (Item 5 at 10; Item 6 at 5)
In October 2022, Applicant consolidated all his delinquent SOR debts into another
payment plan. (Item 2 at 69, 84, 91) He has been paying $176 per month towards the
plan  since  November 2022.  By  September 2023,  he  had  satisfied  the debt  alleged  in
subparagraph 1.f. (Response at 3)
In   addition   to   the   delinquent   commercial  debts,   the   SOR  includes  delinquent
federal   and   state   income   tax  debts,   as   alleged   in   subparagraphs  1.a   through   1.d.
Specifically, SOR subparagraph 1.a alleges a $4,524 federal income tax delinquency for
tax year 2021  and  a  $511  federal income  tax delinquency for tax year 2018. (Item  4  at
28) Applicant has  been making  $51  monthly  payments  to  the  IRS through  an  installment
agreement since  June  2019.  (Item 4  at 30-35)  When  he  did not satisfy the tax year 2021
delinquency  on  time,  it  was incorporated  into  the  installment agreement.  Apart from  six
payments   that  were   dishonored   for  insufficient  funds,   Applicant   has  been   making   the
payments, as agreed. (Item  4  at  31, 46-48)  The most recent  dishonored payment was in
November 2022. (Item  4 at 31)
Subparagraph 1.c alleges that Applicant owes $1,967 in back state taxes for tax
year 2021. It remains outstanding.
SOR subparagraph 1.d alleges that Applicant had two business tax liens entered
against him in 2016 and 2020, totaling $198. This debt constituted a tax on a business
that Applicant’s ex-wife owned, which he financed. (Item 12) When Applicant discovered
these liens, he contacted the municipality and satisfied them. (Item 2 at 2)
Applicant continues to work on paying off his debts. In September 2023, he made
payment arrangements to satisfy a $650 debt that was not listed on the SOR. (Response
at 3)
SOR  Paragraph   3   alleges  two   domestic  violence   allegations.   Specifically,  on
December  17,   2018,   Applicant’s  estranged   wife,  a   foreign   national,   filed   a   request  for
domestic violence  protective  order, alleging  that  on  December 11,  2018,  around  6:00  am
in the  morning, he  assaulted  her  in the  parking  lot  of  his apartment  complex.  (Item  13  at
8)   At  the   time   of  the   alleged   episode,  Applicant  and   his  wife   had   been   separated   for
approximately  eight   months.  That  morning,  she   had   gone   to   his  apartment   without
notifying   him   in  advance   to   retrieve   her  immigration-related   documents.  (Item   13   at   8)
When  she  rang  the  doorbell, he  did not  answer it, nor did  he  invite  her in.  Shortly after
she  rang, however, he  walked  out of the  home  towards his car. Applicant’s estranged  wife
asked  him  about the  documents  that she  needed  and  followed  him  to  his car. She  alleged
that Applicant,  while walking  to  his car, suddenly became  enraged, threatened  to  kill her,
and  began  strangling  her. (Item  13  at 8).  After he  stopped, he  punched  her in the  face.
(Item  13  at 8) After the  assault,  Applicant’s estranged  wife  alleged  that he  entered  his  car
and drove  away, whereupon  she  got into  her  car and  “tried  to  follow him  so he  could not
get away.” (Item 13 at 8) After losing him in traffic, Applicant’s estranged wife alleged that
she then drove towards her immigration attorney’s office, called him from the car and told
him what happened. He advised her to return to the scene and call the police. (Item 13 at
8-9)
Applicant’s estranged wife followed the immigration attorney’s advice and returned
to  Applicant’s  apartment  complex.  At  approximately  8:45  am,  an  apartment  complex
maintenance worker noticed Applicant’s estranged wife in the parking lot crying, and he
called the police. (Item 13 at  17) The  police  arrived, and  after taking  Applicant’s wife’s
statement,  prepared  a  domestic  violence  report.  In  the  report,  Applicant’s  wife  was
characterized as “upset,” “crying,” “fearful,” and “nervous.” (Item 13 at 14) Moreover, the
officer noticed that Applicant’s wife had lacerations on her neck, a swollen right eye, and
scrapes and bruises on her palm and lower left arm. (Item 13 at 17) The police then called
an  ambulance  for  transport  to  the  local  emergency  room.  (Item  13  at  16)  Before  the
ambulance arrived, the police officer took pictures of the injuries, completed an incident
report,  including  a  “strangulation  documentation  form,”  and  issued  an  emergency
protective order. (Item 13 at 17, 22, 24)
Applicant’s  estranged  wife  was  treated  at  the  hospital and  discharged  that  day.
The  intake  staff  noted  multiple  contusions.  (Item  13  at  26)  On  December  17,  2024,
Applicant’s estranged wife filed a request for a domestic violence restraining order against
him. (Item 13 at 31) The court originally scheduled the hearing for January 2, 2019, and
granted a temporary restraining order pending the hearing. (Item 13 at 31) The case was
continued until March 2019. (Item 13 at 52)
On February 2, 2019, Applicant responded to the request for a domestic violence
restraining order, denying the allegations, and moving for a restraining order against his
estranged wife. (Item 13 at 43) He admits that his estranged wife came to his home the
morning of December 11, 2018, at approximately 6:00 am. However, he denies harming
or threatening her. Instead, he said that she repeatedly hugged him, begged him for help
to prevent her from being deported, and asked him to kiss her. Intent on getting away,
Applicant closed his apartment door and ran to his car with his estranged wife in pursuit.
(Item 13 at 47) After he entered the car, she then allegedly jumped into his lap before he
could close the door, while continuing to exclaim, “help me, baby!” and “kiss me, baby!”
(Item  13  at  47)  He  then  lifted  and  pushed  her  off  him,  removing  her  from  the  car.  He
contends  that  he  did  not  injure  her  in  the  process.  Applicant  then  exited  the  car.  Per
Applicant, his estranged wife continued to put her arms around him and beg him for help.
(Item 13 at 48) Fearing that they were waking up the neighbors, Applicant exhorted his
estranged  wife  to  calm  down,  and  suggested  that  she  follow  him  in  her  car  to  a
commercial establishment where they could talk in public.(Item 13 at 48) After Applicant
and his wife got into their respective vehicles, Applicant intentionally turned in a direction
opposite from the street that led to the location where he had asked her to meet, and then
intentionally lost her in traffic.
Later that day, Applicant returned  home, packed  his belongings,  and  moved  to  a
friend’s house. (Item  13  at  48) He did so  because  he  was terrified  that his estranged  wife
“and/or her boyfriend could do something” to him. (Item 13 at 48) (Applicant’s discovery
of his wife “in an intimate embrace” with a lover several months earlier had prompted him
to separate from her. (Item 13 at 46))
On  March  2,  2019,  the  local  court  held  a  hearing  regarding  the  competing
protective  order  motions.  At  the  conclusion  of  the  hearing,  the  court  ruled  against
Applicant’s estranged wife, concluding that she did not meet her burden of proving by a
preponderance of evidence that abuse occurred within the meaning of the state statute,
or that she was placed in a reasonable fear of imminent bodily harm  by any actions of
Applicant.  (Item  13  at  54)  The  court  reached  this  conclusion  “despite  the  injuries
admittedly present” on Applicant’s estranged wife and finding ‘the testimony of [Applicant]
to  be  sufficiently  more credible  than  the  testimony of  [the estranged  wife]  to  preclude
[her]  from  meeting  her  burden  of  proof.”  (Item  13  at  54)  The  local  court’s  decision
constitutes the evidence Applicant offered in support of his denial of the allegations set
forth in SOR Paragraph 2, and cross-alleged in SOR Paragraph 3, that he choked and
punched his wife.
In Applicant’s reply to the FORM, he stated that his estranged wife was not injured
when  he  left  her on  the  morning  of  December 11,  2018, and  that “whether or how she
received those bruises or lacerations was not from me.” (Reply at 1) Contrary to his earlier
statement when he suggested that she follow him to a nearby commercial establishment
where they could talk without disrupting the neighbors, Applicant, in his reply, stated that
he left the apartment complex to go directly to work. (Reply at 1)
During Applicant’s estranged wife’s interview with the police officer who filed the
December 2018 incident report, she told him that the episode where Applicant choked
her was not the first time he physically abused her. Specifically, one morning in  March
2018, he punched her on the shoulder “a couple of times” after she would not get out of
bed  to  move  her  car  away  from  his  car  so  that  he  could  drive  to  work,  as  alleged  in
subparagraph 2.b. (Item 13 at 9)
