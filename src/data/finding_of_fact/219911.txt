Applicant is 38 years old. She has never been married but she does cohabitate
with a domestic partner. She has an 11-year-old daughter. Based on her December 2022
SCA, she was currently enrolled in college but she had not yet earned a college degree.
Since January 2015, she has worked for a government contractor as an inspector, except
for a period of approximately 15 months beginning in January 2020 when she worked for
another government contractor. Her employer is sponsoring Applicant for a DOD security
clearance so she can perform specific job duties. This is her first application for security
clearance eligibility. (Item 2)
The  SOR alleges  that Applicant is responsible  for seven  accounts (SOR ¶¶  1.a-
1.g) that were  either placed  into  collection, charged  off, as well as two  vehicles  that were
repossessed,   for  a   combined   total  amount  of  $37,403.   She   did   not  disclose   any
delinquent   accounts  under  the   financial  section   of   her  December   2022   SCA.   In   her
Answer, Applicant admitted  all  of the  allegations  except for SOR ¶¶  1.d  and  1.g, which
had  a  combined  total balance  of  $4,070.  She stated  her car insurance  account,  alleged
in SOR ¶  1.d  was current and  said she  continues to  carry insurance  with  the  insurance
provider. She  failed  to provide  an  explanation  as to  why she denied  SOR ¶  1.g,  and  she
did not submit any supporting  documentation.  The  credit reports in  the  record  support the
SOR allegations. (Items 1, 2, 5, 6)
SOR  ¶   1.a   alleges   a   delinquent   account   in  the   amount   of  $32,079,   for  a
repossessed  vehicle. This debt is the  largest debt in the  SOR. During  her background
interview in  February 2023,  Applicant   confirmed   to   the   investigator that  her responses
under the  financial section  of the  SCA were  accurate. She  was then confronted  with  this
delinquent account information. She  told the  investigator that she  had  no  knowledge  of
this  account.  In   her  April  23,  2023   interrogatory  response,  she   listed   that  she   had   co-
signed a car loan  for her friend, who is now deceased. She does not know where the car
is  located   and   she   has  not  made   any  payments  to   this  creditor.   This  debt   remains
unresolved.  (Items 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges an account referred for collection in the amount of $483, for an
unpaid cable company debt. During her February 2023 background interview, Applicant
told  the  investigator  that  she  had  no  knowledge  of  this  account.  In  her  April  23,  2023
interrogatory response, she listed that this “old satellite  TV  bill” is not satisfied and  she
had   not  made   any   arrangements  to   pay  this  account.  This  debt  remains  unresolved.
(Items 2, 3, 4, 5)
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges an account referred for collection in the amount of $448, for an
unpaid credit card debt. During her February 2023 background interview Applicant told
the  investigator  that  she  had  no  knowledge  of  this  account.  In  her  April  23,  2023
interrogatory response, she listed that she still had no knowledge of this delinquent debt.
This debt remains unresolved. (Items 2, 3, 4, 5)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges an account referred for collection in the amount of $483, for an
unpaid insurance account. During her February 2023 background interview Applicant told
the  investigator  that  she  had  no  knowledge  of  this  account.  In  her  April  23,  2023
interrogatory response, she provided a current insurance card by the insurance carrier to
show  that  this  account  was  up-to-date  and  in  good  stading.  I  find  there  is  sufficient
evidence to support her claim. This debt is satisfied. (Items 2, 3, 4, 5)
SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f allege two delinquent medical accounts in the total amount of
$323. During her February 2023 background interview Applicant told the investigator that
these were old medical bills from her 2018 gallbladder surgery. She forgot to list these
debts on her December 2022 SCA, and she admitted she had received collection notices
for these accounts in 2022. She told the investigator that she would pay these accounts
in full within the next month or two. In her April 23, 2023 interrogatory response, she listed
that “these are old medical bills” and she had not yet made any payment arrangements
for these accounts. These debts remain unresolved. (Items 2, 3, 4, 5)
SOR ¶ 1.g alleges a delinquent account in the amount of $3,587, for a repossessed
vehicle. During her February 2023 background interview Applicant told the investigator
that she had no knowledge of this account. In her April 23, 2023 interrogatory response,
she listed that she still had no knowledge of this delinquent debt. She denied this debt in
her Answer, but she did not provide an explaination or supporting documentation to show
her correspondence with this creditor or what steps she took to settle this account. This
debt remains unresolved. (Items 2, 3, 4, 5)
Applicant provided a personal financial statement with her April 2023 interrogatory
response. Her monthly net income was $3,571. After paying her monthly expenses, she
was left with a monthly net remainder of $945. It does not appear she was paying any of
the SOR creditors, except for her current insurance carrier alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d. During
her February 2023 background interview Applicant told the investigator that  her current
finances were fine. She pays her bills on-time, and she lives within her means. (Items 3,
4)
Department  Counsel  made  it  clear  in  the  Government’s  July  2023  brief  that
Applicant had not provided any evidentiary documentation to show what steps she had
taken  to  resolve  her  significant  delinquent  debt.  Applicant  responded  to  the  FORM  by
providing a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition that was filed in August 2023. Some of the
SOR debts are listed in the petition, and Schedules E and F showed  that several new
creditors were also included. The total amount of Applicant’s liabilities, to include secured
and unsecured claims, was $69,491. There is no evidence that Applicant has made any
monthly payments to  the  bankruptcy trustee  in accordance  with  a  bankruptcy plan. (AE
