Applicant is a 56-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security
clearance. Allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are incorporated
and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow.
Background
Applicant never married and has no children. (GE 1) He attended college classes
between  March  2019  and  June  2019  and  earned  certificates  in  June  2019.  (GE  1)
Applicant  enlisted  in  the  Air National Guard of  his state  of  residence  in  July 1995  and
served  17  years  of  active  duty  before  his  retirement  with  an  honorable  discharge  in
January  2017.  (GE  2) While  an  active-duty member  of  his Air  National Guard  unit,  he
served in a dual role as an active-duty service member and civilian employee. (GE 4)
Since September 2019, Applicant has been employed by his current employer as
an information technology specialist. Previously, he was employed by other employers
in various jobs. He has never held a security clearance.
Applicant’s finances
Tax  records  document  that  Applicant  did  not  timely  file  his  federal  and  State  A
income tax returns for tax years 2009-2011, and for tax years 2017-2018, as required.
(GEs 1-4; Tr. 21-22, 27-30) Tax records also document his indebtedness to State A in
the approximate amount of $10,246 for tax year 2018. (GEs 1-4) Applicant attributed his
2009-2010 tax-filing lapses to procrastination and his 2017-2018 tax-filing failures to his
mistaken reliance on a prior accountant he engaged to file his returns for those years.
(Tr. 27-30) Applicant acknowledged that his 2009-2011 federal tax returns were  force-
filed  by  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  and  garnished  to  satisfy  IRS-calculated
taxes owed. (GE 4: Tr. 28)
for
Applicant’s  mistaken  reliance  on  a  prior  accountant  to  file  his  federal  and  state
tax  returns
tax  years  2017-2018,  was  never  documented.  Without  some
documentation of his claimed arrangements with a tax accountant to prepare and file his
2017-2018  federal and  State  tax  returns,  credit  for making  good-faith  efforts  to  file  his
returns  cannot  be  extended.  Undocumented  and  unresolved  as  well  are  Applicant’s
satisfaction of his state taxes owed for tax years 2017-2018.
