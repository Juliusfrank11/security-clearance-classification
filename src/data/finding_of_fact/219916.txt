Applicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks eligibility
to hold a public trust position. Allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant
are  incorporated  and  adopted  as  relevant  and  material  findings.  Additional  findings
follow.
Background
Applicant  married  in  May  1995  and  divorced  her  husband  (since  deceased)  in
May  1999.  (GEs  1-2) She  has  two  adult  children  from  this marriage,  ages  27  and  29.
(GEs 1-2; Tr. 26-27) She remarried in March 2002 and separated in 2018 after nursing
her husband back to health following three massive strokes in 2016. (GE 2 and AEs A-I)
Applicant earned a bachelor’s degree in January 2011 and master’s degrees in March
2013,  February  2015,  and  September  2016.  (GE  1)  She  attended  other  graduate
programs  between  October 2019  and  July  2021  without  earning  diplomas  or  degrees.
(GE 1). Applicant reported no military service.
Since August 2022, Applicant has been employed as a referral specialist for her
current health services employer. (GEs 1-2) Previously, she worked for other employers
(including her current employer)between July 2017 and October 2021) in various jobs.
(GEs  1-2)  She  reported  unemployment  between  November  2021  and  February  2022.
(GE 1; Tr. 23) Applicant has never held a public trust position. (GEs 1-2)
Applicant’s finances
Applicant  struggled  with  the  management  of  her  finances  for  many  years.  In
November  1992,  she  petitioned  for  Chapter  13  bankruptcy  relief.  (GE  5)  Her  petition
was dismissed. Bankruptcy records confirm that she petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy
relief in May 1997; she attributed this petition to the medical expenses associated with
the  birth  of  her  two  children.  (GE  6;  Tr.  27)  Applicant  petitioned  again  for  Chapter  7
relief  in December 2007. (GE 7; Tr.  28) She  attributed  this filing to  the joint desires of
herself and her husband  to clean up their debts. (Tr.29) In her petition, she scheduled
personal property valued at $18,581 and claimed no real property. (GE 7) For claims of
creditors, she  scheduled  $13,906  in  secured claims, $725  in unsecured  priority  claims
(i.e., state income taxes owed), and $86,130 in unsecured non-priority claims. (GE 7)
Following  each  of  her  bankruptcy  petitions,  Applicant  returned  to  accumulating
debt beyond her ability manage and control. (Tr. 55-56) In 2016, her husband suffered
three  strokes,  which  prevented  him  from  working  for  over  two  years.  With  only  her
income to over her family’s expenses, she encountered major difficulties, and setbacks,
in managing her family’s finances. (GE 2 and AE Y; Tr. 29) Strains from her increased
financial responsibilities impacted her marriage and her own finances and contributed to
their 2018 marital separation. (GEs 1-2; Tr 28-29)
More recently, Applicant has experienced further financial stress associated with
her  father’s  failing  health.  In  2023,  health  issues  involving  her  father’s  diagnosed  lung
cancer  necessitated  her  devotion  of  more  time  and  resources  to  providing  financial
assistance  and  travel  support  to  her  parents.  (AE  Y;  Tr.  22,  56)  Pressures  on  her
finances  increased  following  her  three-month  layoff  from  her  non-profit  employer  in
2021. (GE 2 and AE Y; Tr. 22) While her father is a military veteran with a pension and
social  security  benefits,  he  requires  her  help  with  household  expenses  and
transportation to his medical appointments. (AE Y; Tr. 63)
Between   2010   and   2021,  Applicant  accumulated   26   SOR-listed   delinquent
accounts  exceeding   $30,000.   (GEs  2-4)   She   is  also  of  record   in  accumulating
delinquent accounts exceeding  $10,000  that are not included  in the SOR. (GE  4; Tr. 49-
51) To  date, Applicant  has  provided  no  documentation  of  addressing  most of the  listed
SOR debts.
One of the listed SOR debts (SOR ¶ 1.a) covers a $3,070 delinquency balance
on  a  medical  vet  bill,  for  which  she  claims  to  have  made  some  payments
(undocumented)  to the  assigned  collection agent.  (GEs 2-4  and AE  BB;  Tr.  32-33) To
address  this  debt  and  others  listed  in  the  SOR,  she  engaged  post-SOR  debt
counselors, neither of whom have been able to help her with documented payments to
the  creditors on  the  plans they set up  for her. (AE  V; Tr. 35)  Another debt  (SOR ¶  1.b)
covered  a  mobile  loan  she  took  out  to  tide  her over after  she  lost  her job  in  2021. (GEs
2-4; Tr. 36) To  date, she  has not taken  any  documented  steps to  address  this debt. (Tr.
36) .
Other  unaddressed  delinquent  debts  that  Applicant  is  checking  on  include  the
following:  SOR  ¶¶  1.c  (an  unsecured  loan  for  $2,239,  for  which  Applicant  received  a
settlement  offer  for  monthly  payments  beginning  in  January  2024,  but  which  lacks
payment  documentation  (GEs  2-4;  Tr.  37);  1.d  (a  $1,962  delinquent  debt  with  no
documented  payment  action;  (GEs  2-4;  Tr.  38);  1.e-1.f  (two  $1,934  charged-off  credit
card accounts that have not been addressed) (GEs 2-4; Tr. 38); 1.g-1.j (credit card  and
other delinquent accounts that have not been addressed (GEs 2-4; Tr. 39-40); and 1.k
(a  delinquent  consumer  account  for  $1,577  that  Applicant  has  discussed  with  the
creditor, but taken no action on the account). (GEs 2-4; Tr. 40)
Additional  delinquent  dets  are  comprised  of  the  following:  1.l  (a  $1,477  a
delinquent short-term loan account that was initially covered by a documented payment
plan with a former debt counselor, but  which lacks any payment documentation); 1.m (a
delinquent  credit  card  account  for  $1,396  that  has  not  been  addressed)  (GEs  2-4;  Tr.
42-43);  1.p-1.q  (two  credit  card  accounts  with  the  same  creditor  for  $923  and  $883,
respectively, with documented action taken on SOR ¶ 1.p, but nothing on SOR ¶1.q to
date) (GEs 2-4 and AEs Z and CC; Tr. 44-45); 1.r-1.t (charged off consumer debts with
no reported actions taken on the debts to date) (GEs 2-4; Tr. 45-46); 1.u (a delinquent
consumer account for $405 that  is covered by a payment plan.  (GEs 2-4 and AEs BB
and DD;  Tr. 47-48); and 1.v-1.z (collection accounts  that have not  been addressed by
Applicant  to date). (GEs 2-4; Tr. 47-49)
Delinquent  non-SOR  debts  covered  in  Applicant’s  credit  reports  total  five  in
number and exceed $10,000 in the aggregate. (GE 4; Tr. 50-55) While she expects to
have  more  time  now  to  devote  to  resolving  these  admitted  debts,  she  has  taken  no
actions to date to either work out payment arrangements or explain why she could not
reach any positive settlements with these creditors. (GE 4; Tr. 54-57)
Applicant’s  post-SOR attempts to enlist debt counselors  to  help  her resolve  her
delinquent  accounts  never  achieved  the  positive  results  she  hoped  for.  (AE  V;  Tr.  59)
Neither  of  these  debt  service  firms  were  successful  in  helping  her  to  successfully
resolve any of her delinquent SOR accounts or the  non-SOR accounts covered  in her
latest credit report. (GE 4; Tr. 59-61)
