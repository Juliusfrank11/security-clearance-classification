Applicant is 42 years old and single. She has a bachelor’s degree. She has been
employed  by  a  defense  contractor  since  2003,  and  seeks  to  retain  national  security
eligibility  and  a  security  clearance  in  connection  with  her  employment.  (Government
Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, 17, and 18; Tr. 5-6.)

The SOR stated that Applicant had 13 debts that were past due, charged off, or in
collection,  in  the  total  amount  of  approximately  $59,758.  These  include  delinquent
Federal taxes as well as consumer indebtedness. In her Answer she admitted allegations
1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.h, with explanations. She denied allegation 1.e, stating
that she had filed all of her Federal income tax returns. She further denied allegations 1.i,
1.j, 1.k, 1.l, 1.m., 1.n, and 1.o, stating she had resolved those debts. The existence and
amount of these debts is supported by her admissions to seven SOR allegations in her
Answer and by credit reports dated January 30, 2019; August 9, 2022; and July 3, 2023.
(Government Exhibits 5, 6, and 7.) They are also confirmed by Applicant’s answers during
an interview with an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management  (OPM) that
was held on June 7, 2019. (Government Exhibit 2.) In addition, they were confirmed by
Applicant’s responses to DCSA CAS interrogatories, dated August 4, 2022. (Government
Exhibit  3.)  Finally,  Applicant  also  supplied  a  credit  report  dated  September  15,  2023.
(Applicant Exhibit D.)
The current status of the debts is as follows:
1.a   through   1.d.  Applicant  admitted  owing  delinquent  taxes  to  the  Federal
government for tax years 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016. She testified that the total amount
owed to the Federal government for back taxes, including penalties and interest, is about
$30,000. She further stated that she has now filed all of her back Federal tax returns and
begun working on a payment arrangement with the IRS. (However, see further discussion
under 1.e, below.) The reason she did not file her tax returns in a timely fashion is that
she got scared of the consequences as time went on. As of the date of the hearing, these
debts have not been resolved. (Tr. 14-15, 23-25; Applicant Exhibit B at 4.)
1.e. Applicant  denied   that  she   failed   to   file  her 2017   Federal income   tax  return.
She stated in her Answer, “I deny, 2017, I worked  for 2½  months and  I was on  medical.  I
have  filed  these  taxes numerous amounts of  times and  they were  received  by IRS. I only
had   a  [sic]  income   of   about  $13,000.”  Government  Exhibit  3   contains   IRS   account
transcripts  for  various   tax  years.  Regarding   tax  year  2017   the   transcript  states,  “We
apologize for the  inconvenience, but  we  are  not able  to  process the  requested  tax year at
this time.”   (Government Exbibit  3  at  4.) Based  on  the  state  of  the  record, I cannot  find
wither that Applicant has filed  this subject tax return  or that she  was not required  to  do
so.
1.f. Applicant admitted that she had not filed her state income tax returns for tax
years 2012 through 2017. In fact, she admitted that she had not filed her state income tax
returns for approximately 18 years, through tax year 2022. She has prepared and printed
out the returns  but has  not filed them.  The  reason  she did not file  her tax  returns  in a
timely fashion is that she got scared of the consequences as time went on. However, she
also stated that she does not believe she owes any back taxes to her state tax authority.
(Tr. 15, 17, 23-24.)
1.g. Applicant admitted owing $14,872 to a creditor for a charged-off automobile
loan. She indicated that she is working with a credit repair agency to set up a plan to pay
this debt. This debt had not been paid or resolved as of the time the record closed. (Tr.
26; Applicant Exhibit B at 4.) This debt is not resolved.
1.h. Applicant admitted owing $11,998 to a creditor for a charged-off automobile
loan. She stated that she still has the car, is making payments, and the amount currently
owed is $4,900. The most recent credit reports in the record (Government Exhibit 7 and
Applicant Exhibit D) confirm that she has been making payments and the balance on the
account has been significantly reduced. (Tr. 27-30.) This debt is being resolved.
1.i.  Applicant  denied  owing  $2,284  for  a  collection  account  to  a  creditor.  She
submitted  documentation  showing  that  this  debt  was  paid  in  March  2023.  (Tr.  30;
Applicant Exhibit C at 2.) This debt is resolved.
1.j. Applicant denied owing $493 for a charged-off account. She testified that she
had paid this debt and had a receipt to support her statement. A receipt from this creditor
is not included in Applicant Exhibit C. The account does not show up in the most recent
credit report in the record, Applicant Exhibit D. There is insufficient evidence to show that
this debt has been paid or resolved. (Tr. 33.) This debt is not resolved.
1.k.  Applicant denied owing $330 for a past-due medical account. She testified that
she had not paid this debt. No evidence was submitted after the hearing to show that this
debt has been satisfied. (Tr. 34-35.) This debt is not resolved.
1.l. Applicant denied owing $130 for a past-due medical account. She testified that
she had not paid this debt. No evidence was submitted after the hearing to show that this
debt has been satisfied. (Tr. 34-35.) This debt is not resolved.
1.m. Applicant denied owing $70 for a past-due medical account. She testified that
she had paid this debt and had a receipt to support  her statement. A receipt  from this
creditor is not included in Applicant Exhibit C. (Tr. 34-35.) This debt is not resolved.
1.n. Applicant denied owing $66 for a past-due medical account. She testified that
she had paid this debt and had a receipt to support her statement. A receipt  from this
creditor is not included in Applicant Exhibit C. (Tr. 34-35.) This debt is not resolved.
1.o.  Applicant denied owing $65 for a past-due medical account. She testified that
she had paid this debt and had a receipt  to support her statement. A receipt  from this
creditor is not included in Applicant Exhibit C. (Tr. 34-35.) This debt is not resolved.
Applicant testified that she had satisfied debts that are not on the SOR, but are
included in her credit reports. Applicant Exhibit C contains receipts to two creditors that
are not identified on the SOR. (Tr. 16, 30-31, 34-38.)
Applicant admitted that she had several other delinquent debts that are not on the
SOR. They are found in Government Exhibit 7 and Applicant Exhibit D. She is working
with a credit consolidation company to resolve these debts, as well as the one in allegation
1.g. (Tr. 16, 34-38.)
