In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, she admitted each debt alleged (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-
1.k). She also provided a chart detailing the status of each debt alleged, and a narrative
explanation. Her admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings follow.
Applicant is 44 years old. She has a bachelor’s degree. She has been employed
in  the  defense  industry  since  at  least  2001,  with  a  clearance.  She  has  worked  for  her
current employer since 2012. She is currently a technical writer. Applicant and her future
husband met in 2011, and were in a long-term relationship together until they married in
March 2021. They have no children together. (GE 1; Tr. 12, 18-19. 81-82)
With Applicant’s help, her husband, then her boyfriend, started a trucking business
in 2014. In about 2016 or 2017, his trucks needed costly maintenance and repairs. They
took out loans in both their names to help the business. The COVID pandemic crippled
his company in early 2020, and their financial problems worsened from there. She trusted
him to handle the finances of the business. All the SOR debts relate to this circumstance,
as Applicant testified throughout the hearing that she took out credit accounts to get him
set up in the business. She had no prior financial problems. After his business failed, he
got a stable, well-paying job in auto sales in December 2020, and they began addressing
their debts. She owns their home, and they recently refinanced the mortgage, using some
of the equity to address their debts. (Tr. 18-19, 81-82)
Applicant learned a hard lesson about tying her credit to someone else, particularly
before  marriage.  After  receiving  the  SOR,  Applicant  talked  to  her  security  officer  and
learned that she remained responsible for many of her delinquent debts, like charge offs
or debts in collection. (Tr. 18-19, 38-45, 80-81).
Applicant  disclosed  several  debts  on  her  December  2021  SCA  and  discussed
them in her April 2022 background interview. They are established by credit reports from
November  2021,  January  2022,  August  2022,  and  March  2023.  (GE  2  –  GE  6)  The
Government also added a December 2023 credit report before the hearing. (GE 7) The
debts in the SOR total about $107,500.
SOR ¶ 1.a ($9,229) is the amount owed to Bank S from a judgment entered against
Applicant in 2021. The debt concerns a past-due consumer credit card that H used for
gas. The debt was resolved as of May 2023, through the equity in her home when they
refinanced.  (Tr.  52-55,  68-69;  AE  G  AE  I,  AE  J)  This  is  the  same  debt  as  SOR  ¶  1.h
($6,270), an account placed for collection by a bank. (Tr. 77-78)
SOR ¶ 1.b ($13,264) is the amount owed to a credit union on a judgment entered
against Applicant in 2019. The amount, $14,901 with fees and costs, was paid in full in
May 2023. The debt concerned one of her husband’s trailers from the trucking business.
(Tr. 55-57; AE I, AE K)
SOR ¶ 1.c ($1,827) is the amount owed to Bank C on a judgment entered against
Applicant  in  2019.  During  her  testimony,  she  was  unsure  what  this  debt  concerned.
However, she later provided a letter from Bank C’s successor, Bank G, reflecting that she
had a checking account there that was charged off in September 2019, with a balance
due of about $416. The account was paid in full in March 2020. (Tr, 57; AE I, AE L)
SOR  ¶  1.d  ($36,749)  is  a  charged-off  auto  debt.  (GE  7)  This  debt  concerns
Applicant’s husband’s truck that he  used  to  haul the  trailer for his business.  The  amount
is the charged-off remainder after the vehicle was sold at auction. Applicant put her name
on the vehicle so he could buy it, in about 2014 or 2015. They fell behind on payments
during  the  COVID  pandemic.  In  2023,  they  negotiated  a  settlement  of  $20,000,  with
$2,000 monthly payments beginning in April or May 2023. As of December 2023, $12,000
had been paid and $8,000 remained. (Tr. 58-61, 73; AE A, AE, AE M) This debt is being
resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.e  ($21,939)  is  a  charged-off  auto  debt.  This  is  another  of  Applicant’s
husband’s trucks. The amount is the charged-off remainder after the vehicle was sold at
auction.  In April 2023, the  creditor initially  offered  to  settle  the  debt  for $15,000,  in  six
installments.  (AE  A)  By  December  2023,  the  balance  had  been  reduced  to  just  under
$19,000. The creditor offered a new settlement, for $8,500, with one payment of $1,416
due in December 2023, and six payments of $1,181, with final payment due in early June
2024. (AE I, AE N; Tr. 61-63, 74-76) This debt is being resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.f ($6,854) is a bank credit card with a hardware store, an account placed
for collection. The account, another one Applicant set up for her husband, was paid in full
as of May 2023. (AE G, AE I, AE O; Tr. 63-67)
SOR ¶ 1.g ($5,709) is an account placed for collection by Bank C. This account is
another that Applicant set up for her husband’s business. She provided a satisfaction of
judgment showing that this account has been paid. (AE I, AE P; Tr. 67-68)
SOR ¶ 1.i ($3,355) is an account placed for collection by Bank S. This account is
another that Applicant set up for her husband’s business.  She made payments totaling
$7,183 to resolve this account, and it was satisfied in August 2023. (Tr. 68-69, 78; AE F,
AE I, AE Q)
SOR ¶ 1.j ($1.458) is a charged-off credit account that was used for Applicant’s
husband to purchase tires for his business. In February 2023, the creditor offered to settle
the account for $875, which she promptly paid with a credit card. (Tr. 69; AE I, AE S)
SOR ¶ 1.k ($797) is a charged-off credit card from a tire company. As with other
debts, Applicant took out the account to help her husband with his business. The account
was settled and paid in August 2023. (Tr. 69-70; AE I, AE T)
Applicant has an annual salary of $105,000, a 401(k) pension with about $65,000,
and about $10,000 in savings. Since her husband changed careers in December 2020 to
become  an  auto  salesman,  their  finances  have  stabilized.  She  estimated  that  her
husband would earn about $250,000 in annual income by the end of 2023. She is now
actively involved in the family finances and is  the one who pays the bills. They have a
joint bank account. She is also trying to pay down other household debts beyond the SOR
accounts. She has no new credit cards or debts. She took a course at work through a
nationally  known  and  reputable  credit  counseling  service  that  teaches  clients  the
“snowball” way of paying  debts (smallest debt first, one  by one). They have  no  past-due
taxes or returns. Her plan is to continue to resolve the two debts that remain. (Tr. 19, 46-
52, 66, 70-71, 81-87; GE 7)
Applicant is highly experienced and highly rated at work, earning ratings of either
“Outstanding”  or  “Exceeds  Expectations”  across  the   board  in  recent  performance
evaluations. (AE B, AE C) Two supervisors of either 4 or 10 years of experience working
with Applicant, as well as her facility security officer (FSO) attested to her ability to get
along  with  others,  her  dependability,  accountability,  integrity,  judgment,  responsibility,
trustworthiness, and overall clearance worthiness. (AE D)
