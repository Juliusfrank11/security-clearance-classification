Applicant is 59 years old. She  earned  a bachelor’s degree  in 1987. She was on
active duty in the U.S. Air Force from December 1989 to April 1995. She was married in
1989  and  divorced  in  2000  and  has  31-year-old  daughter.  Since  2014,  she  has
cohabitated  with  her  domestic  partner.  From  March  2015  to  March  2021,  she  was
employed as an IT  quality  control analyst  for a  company.  She  then  worked for a  state
government contractor from February 2021 to May 2021 when she was laid off. Applicant
is currently unemployed. (Item 2)
The  record  evidence  shows  that  Applicant  has  significant  outstanding  financial
obligations; to include (1) a total of $41,916 in delinquent Federal income taxes for tax
years (TY) 2017-2019, (SOR ¶ 1.f.); (2) $13,272 in outstanding State A taxes for TY 2016-
2019 (SOR ¶ 1.g.); and (3) various consumer debts delinquent in the approximate amount
of $24,898. (SOR ¶¶ 1.h-1.s.) The record evidence further demonstrates that Applicant
has failed to timely file her Federal income tax returns for TY 2017 through 2022. She
failed to timely file State A income tax returns for TY 2017 through 2022. (SOR ¶¶ 1.d
and 1.e.) Applicant provided documentation, with the exception of TY 2022, that both the
Federal  and  State  A  tax  returns  have  since  been  filed.  Applicant  filed  for  bankruptcy
protection in 1998, 2008, and 2013. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c.) (Items 1- 8)
In her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all  of the SOR allegations. She
also  clarified  that  based  on  the  advice  from  her  tax  representative,  she  did  not  earn
sufficient income to require the filing of Federal and state income tax returns for TY 2022.
Her admissions are accepted as findings of fact. (Item 1)
The October 2022 SCA showed that Applicant had disclosed multiple delinquent
accounts and listed that she had not filed Federal or state income tax returns for TY 2020
“[d]ue to Covid, layoffs and not working. Just recently after exhausting all [of her] savings,
[she] has not been able to pay due to hardship.” (Item 2)
Applicant was interviewed by an authorized DOD investigator in December 2022.
She  attributed  her  unpaid  taxes  and  account  delinquencies  to  her  May  2021  loss  of
employment. She was paying delinquent taxes until June 2022, when she depleted the
remaining funds in her savings account. She is willing but financially unable to satisfy her
creditors. Her current financial situation is dire unless steady employment can be secured.
(Item 3)
In September 2023, Applicant responded to the Government’s FORM. She stated
that she faced a series of life challenges, including a divorce, periods of homelessness,
and the responsibility of being a single mom to two children (although only one child was
listed  on  the  SCA).  Caring  for  her  parents  with  medical  issues  also  contributed  to  her
financial struggles. She admitted to making financial mistakes in life, but her primary focus
was always on providing for her family. Applicant does not believe her financial challenges
classify her as a risk to U.S. security. (FORM response)
