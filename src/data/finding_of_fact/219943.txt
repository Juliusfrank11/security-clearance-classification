Applicant is a 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security
clearance. Allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are incorporated
and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow.
Background
Applicant married in June 2013 and divorced in November 2020. (Item 2) He has
one  child  from  this  marriage.  He  earned  a  high  school  diploma  in  August  2008  and
attended college classes in 2008 without earning a degree or diploma. He reported no
military service. (Items 2-3)
Since December 2021, Applicant has been employed by his current employer as
a system server engineer. (Item 2) Previously, he worked for other employers in various
support positions. He held a security clearance briefly in June 2012. (Item 2)
Applicant’s finances
Between  2018  and  2022,  Applicant  accumulated  nine  delinquent  accounts
exceeding $42,000. (Items 3-6) He attributed his debt delinquencies to being immature
with  too  much  extended  credit.  (Item  3)  When  asked  about  debt  delinquencies  by  an
OPM investigator in a personal subject interview (PSI) in February 2023, he assured the
investigator  that  he  intended  to  pay  off  all  of  his  creditors.  (Item  3)  Since  his  PSI,  he
engaged  a  credit  repair  service  who  has  helped  him  with  creditor  payoffs  and  credit
removals of creditors with  payment demands  he disputed.  (Items 7-11)  While  he  was
able  to  document  a payoff of  the  $21,506  debt  covered by  SOR ¶ 1.d  (Item 9),  and a
settlement  offer  from  SOR  creditor  1.a  (Item  8),  his  submissions  contains  no
documentation  of  his  satisfaction  of  SOR  creditor  1.a’s  $3,000  offer  or  payoffs  or
payment  plans  with  any  of  the  remaining  creditors.  While  credit  is  warranted  for  what
appears to be a duplicative debt covered by SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.i, none of the remaining
accounts  reflect  any  documented  actions  taken  on  them  to  date.  That  all  or  most  of
these  remaining  SOR  debts  may  have  been  deleted  from  his  credit  report  does  not
equate  to  proof  that  the  debts  were  resolved  by  means  of  voluntary,  good-faith
payments or other agreed settlement arrangement between the parties See Item 11.
