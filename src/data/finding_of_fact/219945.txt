Applicant used marijuana when he was young, and then did not use it again for
an  extended  period.  He  started  smoking  marijuana  again  in  2015  in  a  state  where
marijuana possession and use did not violate state law. He used marijuana about 10 to
12 times between about January 2015 and August 2017. He did not work for a defense
contractor,  and  he  did  not  hold  a  security  clearance  at  the  time.  (Tr.  at  34-35;

Applicant  went  to  work  for  a  defense  contractor  (not  his  current  employer)  in
February  2018.  He  applied  for  a  security  clearance,  and  it  was  granted  in  about  May
2019. The Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF-86) he submitted to obtain
his clearance is not in evidence, but Applicant stated that he submitted one, and he was
interviewed  for  his  background  investigation.  He  reported  his  marijuana  use  and
discussed  it  during  his  background  interview.  He  admitted  at  his hearing  that  he  likely
told the investigator that he would not use marijuana while holding a security clearance.

Applicant  moved  to  another  state  to  accept  his  current  job  with  a  defense
contractor  in  2021.  Marijuana  possession  and  use  does  not  violate  state  law  in  this
state.  His  security  clearance  transferred  with  him.  His  employer  has  a  drug-free
workplace policy. He used marijuana about six times between about January 2022 and
June  2022.  He  held  a  security  clearance  at  the  time,  but  he  did  not  have  access  to
classified  information.  He  was  going  through  a  stressful  time  with  the  move  to  a  new
state, attempting to buy a new house, and the COVID-19 pandemic. He knew marijuana
possession violated federal law, but he justified the use to himself by the fact that it did
not violate state law. (Tr. at 30-31, 36-42; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE H)
Applicant became an active member of a new church in June 2022. He stopped
smoking  marijuana.  His  participation  in  the  church  and  its  activities  gave  him  a  better
way  to  deal  with  stress  and  problems.  He  is  working  on  his  physical  fitness.  He  is
remorseful for his actions. He has not used any illegal drugs since he joined the church,
and his testimony that he does not intend to use illegal drugs in the future was sincere
and credible. (Tr. at 30-32, 37-39, 44, 47-48; GE 1, 2; AE H)
Applicant submitted another SF-86 in December 2022. He reported his marijuana
use. He fully discussed his illegal drug use during his background interview in February
2023. (Tr. at 38; GE 1, 2)
Applicant called witnesses, and he submitted documents and letters attesting to
his  excellent  job  performance  and  strong  moral  character.  He  is  praised  for  his
dependability,  responsibility,  professionalism,  loyalty,  humility,  trustworthiness,  work
ethic, honesty, reliability, dedication, patriotism, and integrity. He is recommended for a
security clearance. (Tr. at 16-28; AE A-E, G)
