In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations in the SOR. His
admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is 42 years old. He attended a community college from August 2010 to
May 2011, but he did not receive a degree. He married in July 2017, and has two children,
ages 9 and 4, and a 17-year-old stepchild.
Applicant was employed as a restaurant manager from November 2009 to March
2020, when he was laid off due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He has never held a security
clearance. The record reflects that he has remained unemployed since March 2020 and
that he is sponsored for a clearance by a federal contractor.
Applicant  responded  to  interrogatories  in  September  2022.1  In   his   response   he
stated  that he  and   his  spouse  had  agreed  that he  would stay home  with  their   children
during  the  COVID-19  pandemic. Their  agreement apparently followed  his involuntary lay-
off   in   March  2020.  He   indicated   that  he   had   remained   unemployed   for  three   years
pursuant to  that agreement.   He admitted  that,  during  his unemployment, he  was living
beyond his means and was financially irresponsible. (FORM Item  4  at 6-7)
1  The FORM does not identify who sent the interrogatories or the addressee for responses. Based on the
format and content, I have concluded that the interrogatories were from either the DCSA CAS or DOHA,
and the responses were sent to one of those agencies. Applicant has not challenged the authenticity of the
documents.
The SOR alleges four delinquent consumer debts (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d)
and failure to pay state taxes for tax years 2018, 2019, and 2021 (SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, and
1.g.) The consumer debts are reflected in credit reports from June 2021 (FORM Item 6),
March 2022 (FORM Item 7), and October 2023 (FORM Item 8). The evidence concerning
the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below.
SOR ¶  1.a: vehicle  loan opened in November 2014  and charged off in March
2019  for $2,761. The creditor obtained a judgment against Applicant in February 2020
for the amount charged off. (FORM Item 5) The judgment is unsatisfied.
SOR ¶  1.b: deficiency  of  $11,119  after a  vehicle  repossession  and sale. The
repossession was in June 2019. The debt is not resolved.
SOR ¶  1.c: credit-card account  charged off in May  2021  for $797. The debt is
not resolved.
SOR ¶  1.d: credit-card account  placed for collection  in May  2021  for  $467.
This debt is not resolved.
SOR ¶¶  1.e, 1.f. and 1.g: unpaid state taxes  for $318  for 2018;  $1,490  for 2019;
and $278  for 2021. Applicant timely filed  his state  tax returns  for 2018, 2019, and  2021,
which  reflected  taxes due  in the  amounts alleged  in the  SOR. (FORM  Item  4  at 103, 113,
120) His 2020  state  tax  return reflected  a  refund  of $949. (FORM  Item  4  at  92) The  record
does  not   reflect   whether  the   2020   refund   was  applied   to   the   unpaid  taxes  for 2018   or
2019.
In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he stated that the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.c,
and 1.d will be paid once he returns to the workforce, and the tax debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.e,
1.f,  and  1.g  will  be  paid  through  payment  arrangements  after  he  returns  to  work.  He
submitted no evidence of financial counseling and no evidence of contacts with creditors,
payments, or payment plans. He has not disputed any of the debts alleged in the SOR.
