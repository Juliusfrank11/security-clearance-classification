Applicant is a 63-year-old employee of a government contractor for whom he has
worked since June 2020. He has been employed part-time with another employer since
2013.  He  lost  full-time  employment  from  December  2019  until  March  2020,  when  he
was reliant on his part-time employment. He earned a high school diploma in 1977. He
has  been  married  and  divorced  twice  (1980-1982  and  1986-1987).  He  remarried  in
1988 and has three adult children. (Items 3, 4)
The SOR alleges Applicant owes 10 delinquent accounts totaling about $22,000
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.j). These delinquencies consist of credit cards (SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f,
1.h, and 1.i.), medical accounts (SOR ¶¶  1.g and 1.j), a personal loan (SOR ¶ 1.b), and
an account of an unknown  type (SOR ¶ 1.a). In his response to the SOR, he admitted
all of the SOR debts without comment. His admissions are incorporated into the findings
of  fact. The SOR allegations are  established by his admissions and  the  Government’s
2022 and 2023 credit reports. (Items 4-6)
Applicant  became  delinquent  on  these  accounts  between  2015  and  2019.  The
last  payment he  made  on  these accounts  was  in  about  2020.  Applicant  fell  behind  on
his  debts  because  his  wife  was  diagnosed  with  cancer  in  2015.  He  also  had  heart
surgery in 2016, and he has diabetes, which requires costly medications. The burden of
paying for his and his wife’s medical expenses, despite having health insurance, caused
him to miss required payments on the SOR debts. He also lost a job in December 2019,
that added to his financial difficulties. (Items 4-6)
Beginning  in  October  2018,  Applicant  and  his  wife  hired  a  debt  consolidation
company to help them settle their delinquent accounts. He claimed that he made $570
monthly  payments  to  this  company  to  pay  off  his  creditors,  but  he  stopped  making
payments in about March 2020 because he was laid off from one of his jobs. (Item 4)
In January 2023, Applicant estimated that  his budget reflected a deficit of about
$545  every month.  His daughters will  occasionally  help him and  his wife  with  some of
their expenses. He claimed that he would try to resolve his delinquent debts if he could,
but he cannot afford to do so. He reported that he does not have enough money to file
bankruptcy,  and  he  is  mainly  focused  on  paying  for  his  wife’s  ongoing  medical
expenses. Despite having several opportunities to do so, he provided no documents to
corroborate his debt resolution efforts or the current balances of the SOR debts. (Items
