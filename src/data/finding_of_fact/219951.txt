Applicant is 63 years old. She is currently single after her two previous marriages
ended in divorce. She does not have any children. She has four years of college credits,
but  not  enough  for  a  college  degree.  From  2004  to  2010  she  worked  for  a  federal
government contractor as a graphic designer. She unexpectedly lost her job in late 2010,
and she was unemployed for about 18 months until she became employed in April 2012.
She worked about eight months until her contract ended. For the next nine months she
freelanced  as  a  graphic  designer,  but  she  did  not  earn  sufficient  income.  She  worked
various jobs from 2013 to late 2018, but the income from these jobs was nominal. In late
2018, she was hired by an employment servicer to work for a large federal government
contractor.  In  February  2019,  the  government  contractor  hired  her  directly.  Applicant’s
current annual salary is approximately $72,000. Her employer is sponsoring Applicant for
a DOD security clearance. (Tr. 18-23; GE 1)
Financial Considerations
The SOR alleges Applicant failed to file her 2009, 2010, and 2012 Federal income
tax returns. She also failed to file her state income tax returns for the same years. She
admitted both SOR allegations (¶ 1.a and ¶ 1.b) She stated in her SOR response that she
was  unable  to  file  these  income  tax  returns  due  to  grief,  divorce,  medical  issues,
unemployment, and underemployment. She stated that she had filed her 2009, 2010, and
2012 Federal income tax returns, and she had filed her 2012 state income tax return. Her
tax  preparer  was  currently  working  on  her  2009  and  2010  state  tax  returns,  and  she
expected to have those filed soon. (SOR response)
Applicant stated that her financial problems occurred in 2010, after she separated
from her second husband, and she also unexpectedly lost her job. During the summer of
2010, she discovered from her husband that he had not filed their income tax returns for
2009.  He  had  always  been  the  one  to  handle  their  tax  returns.  This  was  during  a
tumultuous period in their marriage. He told Applicant he would file the 2009 tax returns
when he filed their 2010 income tax returns. Not long after that statement, they separated.
He had her W-2s and all the other necessary tax documents. She kept asking him if he
had filed their tax returns, but she was unable to get a response from him. She did not
learn until the spring of 2011 that he had not filed their 2009 or 2010 Federal and state
tax returns. She confronted him about it, and he told her he was still working to get their
tax returns filed. She was responsible by filing her 2011 income tax returns because they
were still married but living separate. (Tr. 24-25; SOR response)
In  2012,  Applicant  was  dealing  with  significant  back  issues.  She  was  getting
epidurals for pain management. She was working parttime, and the medication her doctor
prescribed for her pain kept her in a mental fog. She was not earning enough income,
and she depleted her full retirement account by 2012. Due to these withdrawals, she was
worried she would owe taxes for 2012, but she did not have any money at the time. She
was more focused on paying her living expenses and trying to find employment with a
decent wage. She did not file her 2012 Federal or state income tax returns. (Tr. 25-27;
SOR response)
Applicant was hired in February 2019 by her current employer. It was at this time
she  started  to  address  her  income  tax  filing  problem.  She  was  now  earning  enough
income to take care of these issues by finding a tax preparer, but she was having difficulty
finding W-2s and other documents  for specific tax years. She filed her 2018 and 2019
Federal and  state  tax  returns  timely.  In  July 2019,  she  was  asked  by  her employer  to
apply for a DOD security clearance. She filed all of her delinquent income tax returns for
tax years 2013 through 2017. She owed approximately $14,000 in back taxes for these
years, which has been completely satisfied. Her tax preparer advised her that she did not
need to file tax returns for years 2009, 2010, or 2012. (SOR response; Tr.  27-31)
After Applicant received her July 2023 SOR, she realized that she still needed to
file her tax returns for 2009, 2010, and 2012, despite the advice she had been given by
the tax preparer. She was able to get her tax documents from her ex-husband, and she
hired a tax service in August 2023. By the end of 2023, her Federal and state tax returns
from 2009, 2010, and 2012 were filed. She paid in full Federal back taxes owed for 2010
which totaled $1,673. If filed timely she could have received state tax refunds for tax years
2009 and 2012. She does not believe she will owe any back taxes for the other tax years
based  on  what  the  tax  service  told  her,  but  she  has  money  saved  if  she  is  otherwise
notified by the IRS or state tax authority. She stated that she has filed all tax returns timely
since  2018,  and  she  never  will  allow  herself  to  file  her  tax  returns  late  again.  She  is
financially responsible, and she feels a sense of pride  concerning her current financial
and tax status. (SOR response; Tr. 31-34; AE A, B, C and D)
Character References
Two  character  references,  a  project  manager  and  a  technical  illustrator  from
Applicant’s  current  place  of  employment,  provided  character  reference  letters.  They
described Applicant as  a  hard  worker,  reliable,  and  responsible. They  both  stated  that
Applicant  provides  important  graphic  art contributions  to  keep  U.S.  soldiers safe.  Both
references highly recommend that Applicant be granted a DOD security clearance. (AE
