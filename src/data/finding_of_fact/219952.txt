Applicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security
clearance.  Admitted  facts  are  adopted  and  incorporated  by  reference.  Additional
findings of fact follow.
Background
Applicant married in March 2017 and divorced in March 2020. (GE 1; Tr. 20, 24)
He  has two biological children:  one from his first marriage (age 5) and another from a
prior  relationship  (age  8).  (GE  1;  Tr.  24-26)  Both  children  reside  with  their  respective
mothers  and  receive  monthly  child  support  from  Applicant.  (Tr.  25-29)  Applicant
remarried in June 2022 and  separated in 2023. (GE 1; Tr. Tr. 33) His current wife has
three  biological  children  of  her  own  from  a  previous  marriage  and  three  adopted
children,  for  whom  Applicant  has  no  legal  responsibility  for  their  care  and  upbringing.
(GE  1;  30-31)  Applicant  and  his  current  wife  are  living  apart  and  anticipate  their
marriage will ultimately end in divorce. (GE 1; Tr. 41)
Applicant earned  an  associate’s degree  in  May 2014  and  a  bachelor’s  degree  in
May 2016. (GE 1; Tr. 22-23) He reported  no military service. Since  April 2022, Applicant
has been  employed  as a  material coordinator. (GE 1;  Tr. 34)  Previously, he  worked  for
other employers in  various jobs. (GE  1)  He  reported  brief unemployment in  2021.  (GE
1) Applicant has never held a security clearance.  (GE 1)
Applicant’s finances
Between 2017 and 2022, Applicant accumulated 20 delinquent debts exceeding
$48,000. (GEs 1-5) He attributed his debt delinquencies to overspending during his first
marriage, citing expensive cars and housing. (GE 2; Tr. 44) In his words, his debts just
“avalanched.” (Tr. 42) Under the terms of his March 2020 divorce decree, Applicant and
his wife were each assigned respective responsibilities for specific marrital debts. (GE 2
and AE C) The debts assigned to Applicant were considerable and limited his ability to
resolve them in a timely way. (GEs 1-2)
Acknowledging  the  debts  assigned  to  him  by  his  divorce  decree,  Applicant
accepts  full  responsibility  for  his  debts.  His  assigned  debts  are  comprised  of  the
following:  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  (a  consumer  account  for  $7,591);  1.b  (a  revolving  credit  card
account for $5,977); 1.c (a credit card account for $5,462); 1.d (a credit card account for
$5,416); 1.e (a personal loan for $5,175); 1.f (a digital retail account for $3,879); 1.g (a
credit  card  account  for  $2,509);  1.h  (a  an  auto  loan  for  $2,100);  1.i  (a  credit  card
account for $1,514); 1.j (a credit card account for $1,395); 1.k (a credit card account for
$1,124);  1.l-1-p  and  1.r  (unknown  family  debts  assigned  to  him  from  his  divorce
exceeding  $1,300);  1.q  (a  cell  phone  account  for  $161);  1.s  (child  support  arrears
approximating $4,096); and 1.t (a utility account for $54). (GEs 1-5; Tr. 56-71)
Since  his  finalized  divorce  from  his  first  wife  in  2020,  Applicant  has  addressed
only  two  of  the  delinquent  debts  covered  in  the  SOR.  Based  on  his  testimony  and
payment documentation, he  is credited with paying off the automotive debt covered by
SOR  ¶  1.h.  (AE  D;  Tr.  42)  His  recent  engagement  of  a  credit  repair  service,  while
encouraging,  has  not  produced  any  tangible  results  in  resolving  his  delinquent
accounts.
Applicant’s  monthly  child  support  obligations  cover  both  of  his  biological  sons.
(GE 2; Tr. 25-26) With respect to the mother of his son from a prior relationship, he has
a  standard  custody  agreement  under  which  he  has  bi-weekly  monthly  child  support
obligations of $200. (Tr. 27) Applicant’s ordered monthly child support obligations to the
child of his first marriage run $400 a month for current support and include designated
amounts applied to arrears. (GE 2 and AE C; Tr. 29) Applicant is credited with being in
compliance  with  his  state’s  court-ordered  withholding  of  calculated  owed  child  support
(both current and arrears) from his bi-weekly pay-check. (GE 2 and AE C; Tr. 29)
Applicant  currently  earns  $66,000  from  his  work.  (GE  3;  Tr.  34)  His  monthly
gross  approximates  $5,425.  (GE  3;  Tr.  49)  After  deductions,  (inclusive  of  his  monthly
child  support  withholding)  his  net  monthly  take-home  pay  is  $2,968.  (Tr.  51,  55)
According  to  Applicant,  he  and  his  wife  have  lived  well  below  their  means.  (Tr.  46)
Currently,  his  reported  monthly  (post-separation)  living  expenses  total  around  $2,500.
(GE  3;  Tr. 55-56)  Matching  his net-monthly take-home  pay with  his  monthly expenses
leaves him with a net monthly remainder of approximately $450. (Tr. 56) Such a small
remainder leaves him with little discretionary funds to make any serious inroads into his
debts. (Tr. 78-79) Creditors that he has talked to have already charged off most of his
SOR-listed debts and have not been willing to open their books to negotiate settlement
payoffs. (Tr. 83)
