The  SOR  identified  four allegations  consisting  of  delinquent  Federal back  taxes
owed  for  tax  years  2010,  2011,  2017,  and  2021,  totaling  approximately  $19,000.
Applicant admits each of the allegations with explanations.  Applicant began working for
his current employer in 2021.  He is applying for a security clearance for the first time.
Applicant  explained  that  he  has  had  tax  problems  since  2008.  At  that  time,  he
took  about  $65,000  out  of  his  401(k)  to  put  down  on  the  purchase  of  a  house.  The
escrow closing took eight months, and so he was hit with  a 30 percent tax penalty for
early withdrawal.  This cost him additional taxes and penalties of about $20,000.  (Tr. p.
27.)  He did not file his 2008 income taxes on time but filed them the following year.  (Tr.
26.)  He started making payments towards resolving the taxes and then lost his job, and
had to stop  making payments.  When he started working again,  payments were either
garnished from his account, or he made payments to resolve the debt.  He  stated that
he has paid off his 2008 income taxes, and that since 2012, he has filed his income tax
returns on time.  (Tr. 38.)
In regard to the back taxes owed that are listed in the SOR, he stated that for the
past two years he has been trying to set up a payment plan with the Internal Revenue
Service  (IRS)  but  has  not  been  successful.  (Tr.  pp.  31-35.)  He  has  not  made  any
payments  toward  resolving  any  of  the  back  taxes  listed  in  the  SOR,  and  they  remain
owing.  (Tr. p. 31.)
Applicant believes he incurred delinquent tax debt for tax years 2010 and 2011,
because he sold a number of stock options, considered income, that he used to pay for
a sewage backup problem he had to fix in his house.  (Tr. p. 29.)
In 2017, he was laid
off from his job, and he did not have stable employment until 2020.  He had previously
taken out a loan on his 401(k), and because he did not pay it, it was also considered an
early  withdrawal.  He  was  hit  with  additional  tax  liability.
In  2020,  he  refinanced  his
house  to  lower  the  payment  so  he  could  afford  to  keep  it.  He  also  exhausted  his
original 401(k) to keep the house.  He currently owes about $410,000, on his house.  He
believes that the house is now worth about $600,000, so there is equity there.  In 2021,
Applicant  began  working  for  his  current  employer,  and  did  not  pay  enough  in  Federal
taxes.  (Tr. p. 37.)
For  the  past  thirteen  years,  Applicant  has  been  struggling  with  his  back  tax
liability and he continues to remain indebted.  Applicant currently earns about $159,000
annually.  His wife is also employed and earns about $16.00 an hour.  He currently has
about $50,000 in his new 401(k).  His mortgage payment is $3,100 monthly.  He has no
other savings yet.  (Tr. pp. 22-23.)
Applicant stated that he plans to pay his back taxes as soon as he can.  He may
refinance his house to obtain the money to pay his back taxes.  Applicant stated that he
has been working on getting other things taken care of and he has not put the effort into
getting his back taxes paid.
