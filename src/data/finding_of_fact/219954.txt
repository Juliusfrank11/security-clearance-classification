The SOR alleges that Applicant failed to file federal income tax returns for “at least
2014, 2015, and 2016” (SOR ¶ 1.a); that he failed to file state income tax returns for 2014,
2015, and 2018 (SOR ¶ 1.b); and that he was indebted to the federal government in the
amount of $445.43 for tax year 2017 (SOR ¶ 1.c). In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he
admitted all the  allegations  in  SOR.  His  admissions  are  incorporated  in  my findings  of
fact.
Applicant  is  a  52-year-old  senior  systems  administrator  employed  by  federal
contractors  since  February  2021.  He  was  employed  by  non-federal  employers  from
October 2011 to February 2021, with periods of unemployment from December 2012 to
April  2013,  June  to  July  2014,  and  April  to  June  2016.  He  was  employed  by  federal
contractors  from  December  2009  to  October  2011.  He  was  cleared  for  a  public  trust
position in March 2021.
Applicant married in March  1995 and divorced  in July 2011.  He has three adult
children.  He  attended  a  technical  school  from  May  to  October  2001  and  a  community
college from September 2000 to May 2004 but did not receive a degree.
In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  that  he  failed  to  file  his  federal
income tax returns for 2014, 2015, and 2016; that he failed to file his state income tax
returns for 2014, 2015, and 2018; and that he owes federal income taxes in the amount
of $445 for tax year 2017. He explained that he assumed responsibility for some large
debts and child-support payments after he divorced. He stated that he is working with a
financial  advisor  to  resolve  his  tax  problems  and  assist  him  with  general  financial
management.
When Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in February 2021, he
admitted that he was notified by the IRS and state tax authorities about his unpaid taxes
on dates that he could not recall, but he did not have the money to pay them. (FORM Item
3 at 2) In a follow-up interview in August 2021, he told the investigator that in 2020, he
filed his federal and state returns for all years except 2014 and 2015, because he had
investment income for those two years and did not know how to report it correctly. He
also told the investigator that he had contacted the IRS and state tax authority and made
payment plans for his federal and state tax debts, but that he was furloughed before he
could make the first payments. (FORM Item 4 at 2)
In response to interrogatories from DCSA CAS in April 2023, Applicant submitted
federal tax transcripts and state tax records reflecting that no federal or state returns were
filed for tax years 2014 and 2015; that a state return for 2016 was filed in March 2021;
that federal and state returns for 2017 were filed in March 2021; that a federal return for
2018 was filed in September 2019; and that federal and state returns for 2019 were filed
in March and April 2021. He submitted a federal wage and income transcript for 2016 but
did not submit any evidence that the 2016 federal income tax return was filed. The federal
tax transcript for 2017 reflected unpaid taxes in the amount of $445.43. (FORM Item 5)
He  submitted  no evidence  that the state  income tax  returns  for 2014,  2015,  and  2018
were filed and no evidence that the federal tax debt was paid.
