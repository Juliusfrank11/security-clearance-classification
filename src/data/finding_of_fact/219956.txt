to recover from the financial situation he had gotten himself into. He cited that when he
had  full-time  employment,  he  had  been  able  to  pay  his  bills.  When  he  became
unemployed in 2014 and was out of work for almost a year, he relied on credit cards to
pay for his needs. He attempted to make minimum payments but was not making enough
money to cover his housing and transportation bills. When he found employment, he was
underemployed and could not make enough money to repay his debts or setup a payment
plan for the delinquent accounts. He offers without documentation that he paid and settled
some accounts; however, he did not provide a budget and  sufficient details showing a
track record of resolution of debts. He states he has been “trying to dig out of this hole.”
(Response.) He has been employed by his sponsor since 2021. (Item 3.) His credit report
reflects inaction on all SOR debts with the exception of SOR ¶ 1.m.
