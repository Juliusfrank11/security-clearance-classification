The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  is  indebted  to  the  federal  government  in  the
amount of $188,755 for tax years 2004 through 2007. In Applicant’s answer to the SOR,
he admitted the allegation. His admission is incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 59-year-old systems integration consultant employed by a federal
contractor since June 2021. He has worked for federal contractors since March 2000. He
served on active duty in the U.S. Army from January 1994 to January 1997 and in the
Army National Guard from January 1997 to September 2005, and he received honorable
discharges.  His  July  2010  SCA  reflects  that  he  received  a  DOD  security  clearance  in
1994, and a clearance from another government agency in March 1999.
Applicant married in 1987. He and his wife have three children, born in 1992, 1991,
and 1988. The two oldest children have passed away. He attended a community college
from September 1991 to June 1993 but did not receive a degree.
In  Applicant’s  August  2022  SCA,  he  disclosed  that  he  owed  about  $120,000  in
federal income taxes. He explained that he was unable to pay the taxes because his wife
lost her job, and he incurred medical bills and legal expenses in 2004, after his son was
involved  in  an  accident.  In  2005,  he  received  a  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  discharge  that
included the medical bills and legal expenses from his son’s accident.  (FORM Item 4 at
52-54) When he was interviewed by a security investigator in September 2022, he stated
that he was discussing his tax debt with the IRS and making monthly $500 payments to
the IRS, using his wife’s retirement fund. (FORM Item 6 at 4-5)
In response to DOHA interrogatories in August 2023, Applicant reported that he
and his wife owed federal taxes for every year from 2004 to 2022, except for 2013, 2014,
and 2015. (FORM Item 8 at 2) They submitted a personal financial statement reflecting
net monthly income of $17,052; expenses of $18,758; and monthly payments of $1,145
on a personal loan, leaving a net monthly shortfall of about $2,851. (FORM Item 8 at 8)
Their personal financial statement reflects $4,000 per month for groceries and $8,799 for
utilities. These unusually high expense items are not explained.
Over the years, Applicant has set up several installment plans for his tax debt, but
they were cancelled when he did not pay his income taxes for the following year. (FORM
Item  7 at 8)  The payment  plan mentioned by  Applicant during his security  interview in
September  2022  apparently  is  no  longer  in  effect.  In  a  May  2023  letter  to  the  IRS,
Applicant attributed their inability to pay the taxes due to a substantial increase in their
wages  in  2015.  (FORM  Item  7  at  8)  However,  his  responses  to  DOHA  interrogatories
reflected that his tax debts began accumulating in 2004. (FORM Item 8) He received a
Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in 2005 that relieved him of the expenses related to his
son’s  accident  and  the  reduction  in  family  income  when  his  wife  retired.  However,  his
federal tax debt  continued  to  increase.  He  presented  no  evidence  of  a  current  plan  to
resolve his tax debt.
The  SOR alleges that  Applicant owes $188,755  for tax years 2004  through  2017.
The basis for that calculation is not clear from the record. Applicant’s response to DOHA
interrogatories indicated  that his tax  debts for 2004  through 2012  totaled  about $40,921.
(FORM   Item   8   at 2)   His tax   transcripts   reflect  a   debt   of   $71,361   for 2013;   $21,937   for
2014;  and   $8,027   for  2015.  (FORM   Item   8   at  9-16)  He  submitted   wage   and   income
transcripts  for  2016   and   2017   but  did   not  submit   tax  transcripts   for  those   two   years.
However, he  admitted  in his response  to  DOHA interrogatories that  his federal tax debt
is about $140,000.  (FORM  Item  8 at 3) His admission  is sufficient to  establish a  tax debt
of that amount.
Applicant’s tax transcripts reflect that a significant portion of his tax debt is for late
filing and underreporting his income. For tax year 2013, he incurred penalties of $4,491
and $3,245 for late filing, an accuracy-related penalty of $2,596, and an additional tax of
$13,412  assessed.  For  2014,  he  incurred  an  accuracy-related  penalty  of  $2,327;  an
additional tax assessment of $11,658; and interest of $664 on a late payment. For 2014,
an additional tax of $4,906 was assessed, and he was charged $405 for late payment.
