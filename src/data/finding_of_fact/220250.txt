Applicant admitted the allegations with clarifications in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.g, 1.i,
1.j, 1.m, 2.a through 2.q, 3.a, 3.c through 3.f. He denied SOR ¶¶ 1.k, 1.l, and 2.r in part,
and 3.b and 3.g. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough
and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  testimony,  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant is 40 years old. He received his high school equivalency diploma in 2001.
He never married. He has two children ages 18 and 14 from previous relationships. He
has worked for a federal contractor since September 2021. He estimated his gross salary
for 2023 to be between $45,000 and $50,000. (Tr. 15-18, 26-27; GE 1, 2)
Criminal Conduct Allegations
In March 2004 Applicant worked at a McDonald’s located  on  a  miliary base. He
was a shift manager. He quit the job but retained the key to open the building. He illegally
entered the building at night when it was closed and stole about $1,200. He was arrested
and  charged  with  larceny.  He  was  found  guilty  of  the  offense  and  ordered  to  pay
restitution. He was barred from entering the military base. (SOR ¶ 1.m) (Tr. 41-43; GE 4,
5).
In  December  2004  and  in  January  2005,  Applicant  was  charged  with  failure  to
appear before a court and found guilty of both charges. (SOR ¶¶ 1.l, 1.k) (GE 4)
In April 2005, Applicant was arrested and charged with assault on a female. He
pleaded guilty to the charge. (SOR ¶ 1.j) He and the mother of his daughter got into an
altercation. He was interviewed by a government investigator in February 2019 about the
incident, and he said it was an unfortunate event but that he did nothing wrong. He failed
to tell the investigator that he had slapped the woman. He testified that the woman broke
his car window, and he reacted. (Tr. 19, 37-39; GE 4, 5)
In June 2005, Applicant was charged with driving while his license was revoked, a
misdemeanor. (SOR ¶ 1.i) In November 2005, he was found guilty. (SOR ¶ 1.g) (GE 5)
In August 2005, Applicant was found guilty of a parole violation that was part of his
sentence for the March 2004 larceny conviction alleged in SOR ¶ 1.m. (SOR ¶ 1.h) (GE
5)
In November 2005, Applicant was issued a notice of a probation violation and his
probation  was  extended  (SOR  ¶  1.g).  In  July  2007,  Applicant  was  found  guilty  of  a
probation violation that was associated with his April 2005 assault on a female offense
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.j. He was sentenced to 50 days in jail. Applicant had been ordered to
attend an anger management class. He testified that he did not attend the class because
he did not think he needed it and decided not to go. He served 40 days in jail. He never
took the anger management class. (SOR ¶ 1.f) (Tr. 39-41; GE 5)
In May 2009, Applicant was charged with fictious/altered title/registration card/tag,
a misdemeanor. He had purchased a motorcycle. He did not have the title and attempted
to retrieve it from the seller, but he had passed away. He requested a new title from the
Department of Motor Vehicle. He drove the motorcycle without the proper registration and
took license plates from another vehicle and put them on his motorcycle. He was aware
that his conduct was illegal. (SOR ¶ 1.e) (Tr. 35-36; GE 5, SOR answer at Exhibit (Ex.)
D)
In  April  2014,  Applicant  was  charged  with  reckless  driving-wanton  disregard,  a
misdemeanor, and speeding. In March 2016,  he was charged with operating a vehicle
without insurance, a misdemeanor and following too closely. He admitted he did not have
insurance for the motorcycle he was driving. He said he was careless in not getting it.
(SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d) (Tr. 35; GE 5; SOR answer at Ex. D)
In June 2019, Applicant was arrested and charged with assault on a female, the
mother of his child. He pleaded not guilty and was found not guilty. He testified that the
woman stabbed him five times. He said she was arrested and convicted of assault. (SOR

In May 2022, Applicant was charged with operating a vehicle without insurance, a
misdemeanor, canceled/revoked/suspended certificate/tag, a misdemeanor, and failure
to maintain lane control. Applicant admitted he did not have insurance. He had no excuse
and was aware of it at the time, but he needed to drive. The tags for his car were expired
or canceled. He provided a letter from his attorney that confirmed he pleaded guilty to
improper equipment and the paid court costs and a fine. (SOR ¶ 1.a) (Tr. 29-30; AE C)
Personal Conduct Allegations
The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) conducted an investigation regarding
Applicant’s failure to  disclose  on numerous official government documents that  he had
been terminated from a job due to absenteeism.  The investigation found that Applicant
intentionally  provided  false  information  about  his  employment.  A  copy  of  the  notice  of
disciplinary  action  and  termination  letter  he  received  from  his  employer  for  excessive
absenteeism shows he signed it and dated the letter in July 2017. Applicant denied he
intentionally  falsified  the  government  documents.  The  SOR  alleged  the  specific
documents were a June 2018 resume, a July 2018 Optional Form 306, a September 2018
Optional  Form  306,  a  September  2018  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  and  a
November  2018  SCA.  I  was  provided  a  copy  of  the  November  2018  SCA  and  the
September 2018 Optional Form 306. I was not provided copies of the other documents
alleged  in  the  SOR.  My  findings  are  based  only  on  the  two  documents  provided.  The
documents show he did not disclose on these documents that he was terminated from
his employment. (Tr. 47-49; GE 1, 3, 6, 7)
Applicant’s testimony was that it was a misunderstanding, and he did not believe
he was terminated. He said he thought it was a “mutual separation.” He said he stands
by his belief he left by mutual agreement but understands now he was terminated. On his
November 2018 SCA he was asked if in the past seven years he had left a job after being
fired; quit after being told he would be fired; by mutual agreement following charges or
allegations  of  misconduct;  or  mutual  agreement  following  notice  of  unsatisfactory
performance.  He  responded  “no.”  The  September  2018  Optional  Form  306  asked  a
similar question, if in the past five years he had been fired for any reason, quit after being
told he would be fired, leave any job by mutual agreement because of specific problems
or been debarred from Federal employment. He responded “no.” I did not find Applicant’s
explanations credible. I find he intentionally failed to disclose on his November 2018 SCA
and September 2018 Optional Form 306 that he was terminated from a job. (Tr. 47-49;
GE 1, 3, 6, 7)
In  January  2020,  OPM  directed  that  Applicant  be  separated  from  government
employment  and  debarred  from  government  employment  for  three  years  for  falsifying
government documents. In March 2020, his debarment was reduced to 18 months. (SOR
¶ 2.a) (Tr. 47-49; GE 1, 3, 6, 7)
In  March  2020  and  February  2017,  Applicant  was  charged  with  improper
equipment,  speedometer,  or  other  traffic  violation.  He  was  convicted  of  improper
equipment, speedometer in August 2021 and June 2017, respectively. (SOR ¶¶ 2.b and
2.e) (Tr. 49GE 4)
In  July  2019,  December  2014,  April  2014,  September  2012,  October  2011,
October 2010, August 2010, April 2008, February 2008, and December 2004, Applicant
was charged and convicted of speeding. In February 2015, after his speeding conviction,
the Department of Motor Vehicles placed him on probation for obtaining two convictions
for speeding within 12 months. (SOR ¶¶ 2.c, 2.f, 2.g, 2.h, 2.i, 2.j, 2.k, 2.n, 2.o, 2.q) (Tr.
49-51; GE 4)
In March 2019, Applicant was charged with a traffic violation in connection with a
vehicle accident. (SOR ¶ 2.d) (GE 4, 5)
In November 2008 Applicant was charged with driving with no/expired operator’s
license and failure to wear a seat belt. Later in November 2008 he was  again charged
with no operator’s license. In March 2009 he was convicted of both offenses. (SOR ¶¶ 2.l
and 2.m) (GE 4, 5)
In November 2006, Applicant was charged with expired registration card/tag and
expired/no inspection. In about February 2007, he was convicted of both offenses. (SOR
2.p) (GE 5)
Financial
The  SOR  alleged  seven  delinquent  debts  totaling  approximately  $28,719.
Applicant resolved the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a ($138) in August 2023, after receipt of the SOR
(AE  I).  He  has  a  payment  agreement  to  pay  $36  a  month  for  SOR  ¶  1.g  ($362).  He
provided proof he has made four payments since December 2023. (AE I, J) He has three
delinquent debts from approximately 2009 or 2010 owed to a credit union in the amounts
of $8,282, $8,246, and $10,131. (SOR ¶¶ 3.c, 3.d, 3.e). He testified that at this time, he
does not intend to pay these debts because he does not have the money.  He said he
would pay them, if he had the money. He testified that he got behind on these debts when
he  broke  up  with  his younger daughter’s mother.  He also has a medical debt for $513
(SOR ¶ 1.b) and a cell phone bill for $1,047 (SOR ¶ 1.f) that are unpaid. He testified that
he has a history of some negative debts, but he also has a history of paying his debts too.
He provided a document to show he had a large car repair expense. He took a loan from
his pension plan to pay it. (Tr. 21-25, 55, 57-63; GE 10-13; AE N)
His latest credit report from January 2024 reports that since receiving the SOR, he
has  incurred  three  more  delinquent  debts,  including  one  for  a  car  repossession  for
$14,367. Applicant was asked if he had filed his past income tax returns, and he testified
that he has not yet filed his 2022 income tax return but intended to do so with his 2023
returns. (Tr. 63-71; GE 13)
I have not considered for disqualifying purposes any derogatory information that
was not alleged in the SOR. I may consider it in the application of mitigating conditions,
in making a credibility determination, and in my whole-person analysis.
Applicant testified that he takes full responsibility for his conduct over the past 20
years, including his financial problems. He said he has changed and is trying to get his
life together. He said many of the criminal charges and violations were many years ago
and he has done good things since getting in trouble.  He provided character letters. In
them,  he  is described  as  admirable,  dependable,  honest,  kind,  generous,  responsible,
hardworking,  caring,  professional,  courteous,  disciplined,  proficient,  knowledgeable,
dedicated, proficient and honorable. (Tr. 18-19, 75-76; AE B, H)
