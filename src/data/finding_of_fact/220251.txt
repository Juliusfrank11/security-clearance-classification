Applicant  admitted  the  sole  SOR  allegation  in  his  Answer.  He  is  36  years  old,
married, and he has a one-year-old child. He graduated from high school in 2006 and he
earned a bachelor’s degree in aerospace engineering in 2012 and a master’s degree in
2016. He worked as a DOD contractor from 2012 to 2015, when he was hired as a DOD
civilian. Since March 2022, he has worked as a senior professional staff member for his
employer,  another  DOD  contractor.  He  conducts  artificial  intelligence  research  and
engineering for combat-related platforms, a position that requires a security clearance.
He was first granted a clearance in 2015. (Tr. 6, 19-33, 50-53, 80-81, 84-85; GE 1-3; AE
H)
Applicant used marijuana on three occasions from April 2021 to December 2021,
while he was granted access to classified information. (SOR ¶ 1.a) On each occasion, he
was at a social gathering and he had consumed alcohol. In the spring of 2021, he was at
a friend’s party and he ate a portion of a marijuana brownie. In the fall of 2021, he was at
a  party  and  he  took  one  puff  of  a  marijuana  cigarette  that  was  passed  around  by  his
spouse’s friend. On the third occasion, he was out of state at a New Year’s party hosted
by his in-laws and he took one puff of a marijuana cigarette that was passed around by
his brother-in-law. (Tr. 33-41, 53-78, 83-84; GE 1-2; AE B-C)
These were the only occasions in which Applicant used marijuana. He described
his use as experimental in nature, and he regretfully did not consider the implications that
his  marijuana  use  would  have  on  his  security  clearance.  Although  he  did  not  access
classified  information  as  part  of  his  day-to-day  job  duties,  he  acknowledged  that  he
attended optional, classified seminars between April 2021 and December 2021 and his
security clearance enabled him to do so. (Tr. 33-41, 53-78, 83-84; GE 1-2; AE B-C)
Applicant did not think to report his marijuana use until he voluntarily disclosed it
on his March 2022 security clearance application (SCA). He did so, despite the potential
consequences  on  his security  clearance,  because  he  wanted  to  be  honest.  He  further
discussed it in his December 2022 response to interrogatories. He took responsibility for
his marijuana use. He also acknowledged that he violated federal law and the rules and
regulations  governing  individuals  with  security  clearances,  having  received  annual
security trainings since 2015. (Tr. 41-50, 52, 68, 71-80, 83; GE 1-2; AE B-C)
Applicant stated that his marijuana uses were extraordinary lapses of judgment.
He  stated  that  it  permanently  stained  his  personal  integrity  and  he  is  committed  to
rehabilitation.  He  voluntarily  completed  a  drug  and  alcohol  education  course  in  March
2022. He also voluntarily submitted to drug screens, testing negative for marijuana and
other illegal drugs, in April 2022, November 2022, February 2023, April 2023, July 2023,
and  October  2023.  He  also  chose  to  stop  consuming  alcohol  in  the  summer  of  2023,
because he felt that his alcohol use contributed to his poor decision-making in 2021. He
has  no  intention  of using  marijuana  in the  future. (Tr. 41-50, 52, 68,  71-80, 83; GE  1-2;
AE B-C)
Applicant does not socialize with anyone involved with drugs. His spouse is aware
of his marijuana use. They are  committed  to  Applicant’s decision  to  refrain from illegal
drug use. He also informed his family and friends of his intent to refrain from any illegal
drug use and they are supportive of his decision. If he were to find himself in a situation
where  illegal  drugs  are  being  used,  he  would  leave.  In  December  2022,  he  signed  a
statement of intent to never use any illegal drugs in the future and that any violation would
result in him losing his security clearance. (Tr. 46-47, 61-62, 65-68, 71-73, 81-83; GE 2;
AE A)
In  addition  to  Applicant’s  impressive  educational  background,  he  has  made
valuable contributions as an aerospace engineer since he first started working as a DOD
contractor in 2012. He was awarded for his exceptional work in 2012, 2018, 2019, and
2022. He is an esteemed member of his team, as evidenced by his stellar performance
evaluations  from  2016  to  2021.  He  also  continues  to  contribute  to  his  community.  He
provided numerous letters of support from close friends, colleagues, a former supervisor,
and former colleagues, some of whom were aware of his past marijuana use. All of these
individuals vouched for his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. (GE 2; AE D-G)
