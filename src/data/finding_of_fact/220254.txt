In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR  Applicant  initially  denied  the  factual  allegations  in  all
the Paragraphs of the SOR, with explanations He also provided additional information to
support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.
Applicant is  58  years old,  unmarried,  and  has no  children.  He has  a  Bachelor of
Science  degree. He has worked  for a  defense  contractor  since  October of 2018.  (TR at
page   169   line   11   to   page   110   line   20.)  Applicant  was  honorably  discharged   from   the
U.S.  Navy  as  an   Engineman   Second   Class  in  June   of  1989.  (TR  at  page   124   lines
11~25, and AppX  X.)
Guideline I  –  Psychological Conditions
1.a.  Applicant  was  evaluated  by  a  duly  qualified  mental  health  professional  (as
stipulated to by Applicant’s Counsel) on June 30, 2022, with a brief follow-up interview
on  Julu  26,  2022.  (GX  4.)  This  psychologist,  who  testified  at  length  at  Applicant’s
hearing,  determined  that  Applicant  met  the  criteria  for  Other  Specified  Personality
Disorder, Mixed Personality Features. (TR at page 36 line 13 to page 39 line 17.) The
psychologist  noted  that  Applicant  exhibited  a  lack  of  candor  regarding  his  personal
history, with a high level of defensiveness, and an exaggerated response to perceived
threats  throughout  his  evaluation  process.  (TR  at  page  14  line  22  to  page  44  line  23,
and at page 96 line 4 to page 98 line 11.) He also noted that he was unable to complete
the  second  interview  due  to  Applicant’s  defensive,  redundant,  and  non-responsive
statements.  (TR  at  page  33  line  15  to  page  35  line  25,  and  at  page  55  lines  13~19.)

may impair his ability to safeguard classified information. (TR at page 39 line 18 to page

line 25.)

2.a. Applicant denies that he knew he was “fired” from his employment in May of
2018 for conduct identified as “Poor Judgment/Policy Violation.” His employer’s Human
Resources  (HR) department  “explained”  to Applicant,  as  reiterated by  his  then lawyer,
that  no  “reason”  was  given,  just  that  he  departed  his  former  employment  by  “mutual
agreement.” (TR at page 110 line 22 to page 112 line 10, and at page 117 lines 1~25.)

was  within  legal  limits.  Applicant  had  forgotten  about  this  incident,  that  occurred  more
than  25  years  prior  to  him  executing  his  e-QIP,  until  he  was  questioned  about  the
incident at his psychological evaluation in June of 2022. (TR at page 120 line 18 to page

Mast”  as Applicant’s blood/alcohol ratio was within legal limits. Applicant had forgotten
about this incident, that occurred more than 26 years prior to his interview, until he was
questioned  about  the  incident  at  his  psychological  evaluation  in  June  of  2022.  (TR  at
page 121 line 21 to page 123 line 1, at page 123 lines 14~18, and at page 172 line 22
to page 173 line 18.)
2.e.  Applicant did not willfully falsify material facts at his January 2019 Office of
Personnel Management (OPM) interview regarding the circumstances surrounding him
leaving  his  employment  in  May  of  2018.  As  noted  above,  under  the  findings  as  to
Subparagraph  2.a.,  only  recently,  with  the  submission  of  the  Government’s  exhibits,
was Applicant made aware that his termination was categorized as “fired.” (TR at page

the  submission  of  the  Government’s  exhibits,  was  Applicant  made  aware  that  his

2.g.  Applicant  did  not  willfully  falsify  material  facts  at  his  June  2022
psychological evaluation regarding him being pulled over on a Naval Base in January of
1993, for a possible DUI. (GX 6.) The allegation was dropped at a “Captain’s Mast” as

incident,  that  occurred  more  than  29  years  prior  to  his  evaluation,  until  he  was
