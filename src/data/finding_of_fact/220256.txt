Applicant  is  a  52-year-old  finance  manager  employed  by  a  defense  contractor
since November 2014. She has worked for federal contractors since March 2002, except
from August 2014 to November 2014 when she was unable to work because of a medical
condition. She has held a security clearance since 2006. She earned a master’s degree
in  May  2012.  She  married  in  June  2000  and  divorced  in  October  2018.  She  has  four
children, ages 31, 29, 21, and 20. (GE 1; Tr. 15, 66-80, 93-94)
The SOR alleges nine delinquent accounts totaling $79,896. In her Answer to the
SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.h with explanations, but
denied the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.i.
Applicant  attributes  her  financial  problems  to  divorce,  her  former  husband’s
unemployment, marital debt,  child-support costs, and unanticipated medical expenses.
She said that after her former husband lost his job and left her without a home or a reliable
car, she prioritized her debts. She rented two homes to pay the mortgages and moved
into  an  inexpensive  apartment,  entered  payment  arrangements  with  other  creditors,
obtained and has timely paid auto loans for her and her daughter, worked part-time to
earn  extra  income,  and  used  loans  from  her  retirement  account  to  pay  some  bills.
(Answer; GE 1 at 39-42, GE 2 at 6-11; Tr. 44-59, 64-68, 83-86)
The evidence concerning the specific SOR allegations is summarized below.
SOR ¶  1.a: credit card charged off for $24,642.  Applicant admitted the  debt  but
disputed  the  amount  and  said  payment  arrangements   were  underway. (Answer)  Credit
reports from  July 2020, May 2021, and  February 2022  show this  individual account was
opened   in  January  2008,  with   a   last  payment  in  March  2018,  and   charged   off  with   a
balance of $24,342. (GE 3 at 17, GE 4  at 3, GE 5 at 7)
Applicant testified the debt was for a credit card she and her former spouse used
to  purchase  building  materials  for  a  house.  She  thought  her  former  spouse  should  be
responsible for the debt because the home was in his name, and he lived there. However,
the debt was not divided in the divorce proceedings because the credit card was in her
name only. When she learned the debt was delinquent, she called the creditor, but they
were closed and “it fell off [her] radar[.]” (Tr. 44-45, 60-62, 85-89)
After the hearing, she reported she could not find evidence of a payment plan. She
contacted the creditor and said she was preapproved for a home equity loan to pay the
debt. She submitted correspondence dated October 13 and 24, 2023, confirming receipt
of documents required to process her “home equity loan application,” that her application
had  been  forwarded  to  an  “underwriting  team  for  review,”  and  that  unspecified  credit
accounts would be paid with “loan proceeds.” (AE D at 1, AE I at 1-2, 9)
SOR ¶  1.b: credit account  charged off for $7,992.  Applicant admitted  the  debt
was  hers   but  disputed   the   amount   and   said   she   had   been   in  a   payment   plan   since
February 2022. (Answer)  Credit reports from  July 2020, May  2021,  and  February 2022
show  the   individual  account   was  opened   or  assigned   in  November  2011,  with   a   last
payment   in  June   2016,   and   charged   off  with   balances  of  $7,085;   $7,561;   and   $7,992,
respectively.   She   testified   payments   were   deducted   from   her   bank  account   and   she
thought  the  debt  had  been  paid. She  contacted  the  creditor the  day of  the  hearing,  learned
the  balance  was  $2,903,  and  submitted  documentary  evidence  she  paid it that day. (GE
3  at 18,  GE  4  at  3,  GE  5  at 6; Tr.  45-47,  50-52, 62-66;  AE  D at 1,  AE  G at  1-3, AE  I at 10)
SOR ¶  1.c: credit  account  charged  off for $6,192.  Applicant admitted  the  debt
was  hers   but  disputed   the   amount   and   said   she   had   been   in  a   payment   plan   since
February 2022. (Answer)  Credit reports from  July 2020, May  2021,  and  February 2022
show the  individual account was opened  or assigned  in May 2004, with  a  last  payment in
April  2016,  and  charged  off  with  a balance  of $6,192. (GE  3 at 18, GE  4  at 3, GE  5 at 9)
She  testified  her payments reduced  the  balance  to  $3,562, as of the  hearing  date.  (Tr.
47-48,  58, 68-69)  She  made  a  $597  payment  over  the  phone  on  the  day of the  hearing
and,  after the  hearing, submitted  evidence  her payments  reduced  the  account  balance  to
$619  as of October 25,  2023, and  of a  “pending” $597  payment.  (AE  D at 1-2, AE  I at 11)
This debt is being resolved  or has been  resolved.
SOR ¶  1.d: credit  card account  charged off for $2,449.  Applicant  admitted  the
debt had  been delinquent, said she  had  been  in a  payment plan and  paid the debt  in full
in  May 2022. She  submitted  documentary  evidence  of  payments  totaling  $1,495  to  the
creditor from  October  2021  to  January  2022. (Answer)  Credit  reports from  July 2020,  May
2021, and  February 2022  show the  individual account was opened  or  assigned  in October
2011,  with   last   activity  in  November  2016,   and   charged   off   with   balances  of  $4,472;
$4,472;  and  $2,449,  respectively.  (GE  3  at 18,  GE  4  at 3, GE  5  at 9)  She  testified  the
creditor closed  four credit card accounts when  she  defaulted  on  one  account, that she
paid the  debt  off  in 2022, was later permitted  to  reopen  a  credit card account,  and  has
made  timely payments since.  (Tr. 40-41, 54-55, 59, 69-71; AE D at 2,  AE I at 12, 15)
Although there are variances in account numbers in the supporting documents, the
evidence  shows Applicant  had  four credit  cards  issued by this creditor, that  she made
payments that reduced the alleged account’s overdue balance, that three of the accounts
were  closed  including  two  accounts  annotated  with  “paid  charge  off,”  and  that  one
account had been reopened and was current. (Answer; AE D at 2, 6, 24, AE E at 3, 7, AE
I at 12, 15; GE 3 at 12, 18-20, GE 4 at 3, 4, 13, GE 5 at 5, 9, 15, 17) I resolve this allegation
for Applicant because the documentary evidence corroborates her testimony.
SOR ¶  1.e: credit  account  charged  off for $1,498. Applicant admitted the debt
had been delinquent, and said she paid $1,358 on February 9, 2022, to resolve the debt.
(Answer) Credit reports from July 2020, May 2021, and February 2022 show the account
was opened or assigned in July 2014, and charged off with balances of $7,880; $4,219;
and $1,498, respectively. (GE 3 at 18, GE 4 at 4, GE 5 at 5) The debt was paid, and a
judgment satisfied in March 2022. She made a $148 payment on September 27, 2023, to
fully resolve the debt. (AE E at 1, 3, AE F, AE I at 13; Tr. 39-41, 55-56)
SOR ¶  1.f: credit  collection account  for $2,380.  Applicant  admitted  the  debt  had
been  delinquent,  said she  had  a  payment plan,  and  paid the  debt in full. (Answer)  Credit
reports from  July 2020, May 2021, and  February 2022  show the account was opened or
assigned  in  May  2017, and  in  collection  for $3,719;  $3,060;  and  $2,380, respectively.  (GE
3  at 19, GE  4  at 4, GE  5  at 4)  She  submitted  documentary evidence  of biweekly payments
from  October 2021  to  February 2022, and  that the  debt was  satisfied  by May  2,  2023.
(Answer, AE A, AE C, AE D at 2, 8-11, AE  I at 14; Tr. 37-38, 56, 73-75)
SOR ¶  1.g: credit account  charged off for $714.  Applicant admitted  the  debt had
been delinquent and  said she  had paid  the  debt  in full. (Answer)  Credit reports fro  m  July
2020, May  2021,  and  February 2022  show the  individual account  was opened  or assigned
in January  2005,  charged  off for $714, and  that  she  resolved  the  debt  before  the  SOR
was issued.  (GE 3 at 19, GE 4  at 4, GE  5  at 17; AE  I at 15; Tr. 39-41, 75-76)
SOR ¶  1.h: credit account  charged off for $33,613.  Applicant admitted  the  debt
but said the  balance  due  was incorrect because  she  had  made  weekly payments since
2018   in   accordance   with   an   agreement.   (Answer;  Tr.   57-58,   77-78)   She   submitted
documentary evidence  of weekly,  $50  payments from  October 2018  to  October 25, 2023,
and  an  account balance  of $25,640, as of  October 25,  2023. (AE D at 2-3, 12-16, AE I  at
16, AE J) This debt is being resolved.
SOR ¶  1.i: credit account  charged off for $416.  Applicant denied  the  allegation
and  said the  debt was  not  hers.  (Answer)  Credit reports from  July 2020  and  May  2021
show an  individual credit-card account was opened  or assigned  in April 2017, charged  off
with  a  balance  of  $416, and  transferred  or sold  to  another creditor. (GE  3  at 20, GE  4  at
5) A  February 2022  credit report shows  that  an  account opened  the  same  month  with  a
similar account  number,  but  different creditor,  was charged  off  for $416,  and  transferred
or sold with a  balance of $0. (GE 5  at  16)  She  testified  she  did  not recognize the  debt  or
creditor,  that  the   debt   was  not  listed   in  her  credit  reports,  and   that  she   contacted   the
creditor and  was told they had  no  records of  a  debt associated  with  her social security
number. (Tr. 57-58, 79; AE  D at 3, AE  I at 1) I resolve this allegation  for Applicant because
her testimony is corroborated, in part, by documentary evidence.
Applicant’s  financial  situation  has  apparently  improved.  She  reported  a  gross
annual income of about $145,000 including salary and bonuses. She has about $10,000
in her bank accounts and about $50,000 in a retirement account. She has two homes in
her name with current mortgages and at least $133,000 in equity. She has not received
formal  financial  counseling.  She  submitted  a  spreadsheet  she  uses  to  track  expenses
and a written budget. (Answer; GE 1-3; AE B, AE I; Tr. 81-101)
Applicant  submitted  a  letter  of  recommendation  from  a  friend  and  fellow  social
organization  executive  that  comments  favorably  on  her  sincerity,  trustworthiness,
reliability, judgment, loyalty, and ethical standards. (AE I at 6-7)
