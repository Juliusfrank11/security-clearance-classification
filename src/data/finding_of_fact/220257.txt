Applicant, age 52, has three adult children with his first wife, and two minor children
with his second wife. He married his first wife in 1992 (ex-wife). They divorced in 2013.
He has been married to his second wife since 2015 (wife). His two minor children reside
with  him  and  his  wife.  He  is  not  obligated  by  a  court  or  otherwise  to  provide  financial
support  to  his  adult  children.  He  graduated  from  high  school  in  1989.  He  earned  a
professional  certificate  in  2005.  He  worked  full  time  as  a  professional  singer  from
approximately  2000  to  March  2020,  when  the  COVID-19  pandemic  shut  down  the
industry. Since approximately August 2011, he has also been employed full time by an
independent government agency (IGA). He submitted the SCA in connection with an offer
of employment by the defense contractor who sponsored his SCA, pending the successful
adjudication of his clearance. (GE 1-2; Tr. 10, 15-19, 32)
Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged Applicant failed to timely file his federal and
state income tax returns and pay his federal and his state taxes for tax years (TY) 2017
through 2020. Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged he falsified the SCA by deliberately
failing to disclose the federal and state tax issues alleged under Guideline F. He admitted
all allegations in his response to the SOR. (Answer)
At the hearing, Applicant admitted he had neither completed nor filed his federal
and state income tax returns for TY 2017 through 2018 and TY 2020 through 2021. He
claimed,  without  proffering  corroborating  documentation,  that  he  filed  a  “low-earner”
income tax return with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for TY 2019. He also admitted
that  he  has  not  made  any  direct  payments  to  either  the  IRS  or  his  state  for  TY  2017
through 2021 income taxes. He anticipated he owes the IRS and his state for TY 2017
through 2021 income taxes, in amounts to be determined. He testified that he intended
to file his TY 2022 income taxes in a timely manner. I will consider the unalleged TY 2021
federal and state tax issues for the purpose of evaluating mitigation and the whole-person
concept. (Tr. 21, 24, 37, 42)
Applicant  also  failed  to  timely  file  his  federal  and  state  income  tax  returns  in
previous tax years. In 2016, he filed his federal and income tax returns for four unspecified
TY he could not recall, which resulted in him owing federal taxes totaling approximately
$8,000, and state taxes totaling approximately $2,000.  He initially established a payment
plan with the IRS to resolve the $8,000 debt. The record does not indicate whether he
made any payments pursuant to the plan. However, the debt was eventually resolved in
the  summer of 2022, through  a  wage  garnishment issued  to  IGA, which  was paid  via bi-
weekly payments   of   $300   to   $400.   He   paid the   $2,000  debt  to  his state,   on   a   date   he
could not recall, to  reinstate  his driver’s license, which  had  apparently been  suspended
for reasons not indicated in  the record.  (Tr. 21-24, 38, 40-41)
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  acknowledged  he  failed  to  prioritize  resolving  his  tax
issues, despite being contacted by the IRS in the past regarding his unfiled income tax
returns. He did not specify the dates when he was contacted by the IRS, but he denied
the IRS has contacted him recently. He denied being contacted at any time by his state
regarding his unfiled state income tax returns. (GE 1 at 52-53; GE 2 at 8; Tr. 39-41)
Applicant and his wife file separate income tax returns. She has timely filed her tax
returns  annually  with  the  assistance  of  a  professional  accountant.  Applicant  earns  an
annual income of  approximately $45,000  from  his IGA employment.  His  wife  earns  an
annual income of approximately $90,000 from her employer of over fifteen years. Without
proffering any specific amounts, he estimated that the sporadic annual income he earned
during  his  singing  career  never  exceeded  more  than  about  $55,000  or  $60,000.  His
annual  income  was  reduced  for unspecified periods in 2011 and 2016 to 2017, during
which  he  was  incapacitated  by  various  medical  conditions  and  surgeries.  From  March
2020 through July 2021, he received COVID-related unemployment financial assistance,
in an amount not specified in the record. (GE 1-2; GE 8; Tr.19-20, 26-31, 46)
Applicant  and  his  wife  manage  their  finances  separately.  They  are  each
responsible for paying an unspecified portion of their household expenses and bills. He
does  not  manage  his  finances  with  a  written  budget,  nor  has  he  sought  financial
counseling. He reported scant details and provided no documents about his assets and
monthly  expenses.  He  reported  only  one  asset:  an  IGA  retirement  savings  with  an
unknown balance. He asserted that he has no money in savings and very little remaining
at the end of each month. He disclosed that he has been  making unspecified monthly
payments towards resolving three unalleged delinquent credit-card debts, involving three
credit  cards  that  he  used  to  keep  himself  “afloat”  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic.  He
claimed  he  resolved  one  of  the  three  unalleged  debts,  is  making  payments  towards
resolving the second, and intends to pay the third. I will consider these three unalleged
debts for the sole purpose of evaluating mitigation and the whole-person concept. (GE 2;
Tr. 33-35, 37, 41, 45, 48-50)
At the hearing, Applicant disclosed that he was in the process of filing for Chapter
13  bankruptcy  protection,  as  he  is  not  eligible  for  Chapter  7  bankruptcy.  He  did  not
indicate the amount or nature of the debts he intends to include in the bankruptcy. He
also revealed that, for an unspecified period, he has been playing shows as a musician
to help pay his debts. He did not address the amount of income he has earned in this
endeavor. He professed that he is seeking a security clearance to obtain a position with
a higher salary. (GE 2; Tr. 33-35, 37, 41, 45, 48-50)
On Applicant’s December 2020 SCA, he did not disclose his federal and state tax
issues  or  any  delinquent  debts.  However,  during  his  February  2021  background
investigation  interview,  he  volunteered,  prior to  confrontation, his  federal  and  state  tax
issues.  He  claimed  that  an  unrecalled  relative,  who  either  held  or  previously  held  a
security  clearance,  advised  him  not to  disclose  his  federal and  state  tax  issues on  his
SCA, because he could explain those issues during his interview. (GE 2)
