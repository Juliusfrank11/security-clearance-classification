Applicant admitted  the  SOR  allegations in  ¶¶  1.a  through  1.k.  She  denied  SOR  ¶¶
1.l through  1.n. Applicant’s admissions  are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of fact.  After a
thorough  and  careful review of the  pleadings, testimony,  and  exhibits submitted, I  make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 52 years old. She never married and has two grown children, ages 24
and 30. She has worked for her present employer for about a year. Before then, she was
employed by a government agency for about four years. She estimated her annual salary
for  2023  was  about  $34,000  and  with  an  increase  in  her  pay  she  anticipated  earning
$38,000 in 2024. (Tr. 20, 25, 62-63; GE 1)
Applicant completed an associate degree in 2007. She used student loans to fund
her degree. She testified that she was going to college on and off from 2009 to 2012, full-
time  and  part-time  during  different  periods  and  continued  to  fund  her  studies  through
student loans. She did not take any college course after 2012. She testified that she has
never  made  a  payment  towards  her  student  loans.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  $65,088  and  1.b,
$33,531) The day before her hearing, she enrolled in college to complete her bachelor’s
degree. Applicant stated that she needs to do an internship to complete her degree. She
is waiting to find out if her employer will fund some of the expenses and if she is eligible
for financial assistance from the college and her employer. (Tr. 21-22, 27-35)
Applicant testified that her student loans were in a default status until sometime in
2022. She received a notice from her student loan  creditor asking her to contact them
about getting her loans out of default. She contacted them and agreed to pay $7 a month
for 52 months. She made two payments, and the creditor returned the payments because
her loan was transferred to a new creditor. She contacted the new creditor and inquired
about a loan forgiveness program. She was advised that to qualify for this program her
loans would have to be brought out of default. She was told she needed to first apply to
the  Federal  Fresh  Start  Program  administered  through  the  Federal  Student  Loan
Program. Once she completed that program and her loans were no longer in a default
status, she could attempt to inquire about her eligibility for a federal forgiveness program.
Applicant applied to the Fresh Start Program for federal loans on January 31, 2024. She
is waiting for her application to be accepted. Her student loans were in default prior to the
pandemic  and  then  were  in  forbearance  from  March  2020  to  October  2023  under  the
CARES Act due to the COVID pandemic. Applicant testified that once her student loans
are accepted in the Fresh Start Program and she completes that program, she hopes to
start a repayment plan. She stated she could afford to pay $150 a month because she is
now in a better financial position. (Tr. 35-65; GE 1, 2, 3; AE A)
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.c ($712) is for a loan Applicant received through a computer
application  that  would  allow  her  to  build  her  credit.  She  failed  to  make  the  required
payments. She disclosed the debt on her April 2022 Questionnaire for National Security
Positions (SF 86) and said she was trying to pay it off. During her June 2022 interview by
a government investigator, she said she was going to contact the creditor by the fall of
2022 to obtain the status of the debt, but she could not predict when it would be paid in
full. She testified that she contacted the creditor and they agreed to settle the debt. She
attempted to make a payment of  $35.62 the last week of January 2024, but it was not
properly  submitted.  Post-hearing,  she  contacted  the  creditor,  and  her  account  was
reopened, and she said she made the payment. She anticipated making another payment
in March 2024. She was waiting to receive the settlement agreement. (Tr. 65-67; GE 1,
2, 3; AE B, Q, S)
Applicant explained that the debt in SOR ¶ 1.d ($465) has been delinquent for two
years.  She  said  the  balance  owed  is  $790.  She  contacted  the  creditor  and  reached  a
settlement agreement to pay $474, which must be paid in full by March 1, 2024. She said
she sent a payment of $25 to the creditor. She anticipates paying the settlement amount
when she receives her refund from her federal income tax return. She anticipates filing
her  return  soon.  She  is  waiting  for  a  tax  document  to  complete  it.  Post-hearing,  she
provided  a  statement  saying  that  her  payment  was  sent  to  the  wrong  account.  She
contacted the correct creditor and was going to send a payment of $75 on payday. (Tr.
74-78; AE D, Q)
During her background interview, Applicant told the government investigator that
she  received  a  letter  from  the  creditor  in  SOR  ¶  1.e  in  June  2022.  She  was  going  to
contact the creditor and make payment arrangements but could not predict when the debt
would be resolved. Applicant testified that she had not taken any action on the delinquent
account in SOR ¶ 1.e ($465) until she contacted the creditor a week before her hearing.
She testified she defaulted on the account in 2022. She accepted a settlement offer to
make a $100 payment the week of her hearing and then another payment in February
2024, and a final payment in March 2024. At the time of her hearing, she had not made
a payment, but anticipated making one. No proof was provided that she made the initial
payment. (Tr. 78-79; GE 3; AE D)
Applicant testified that the delinquent account in SOR ¶ 1.f ($288) was paid when
her state withheld her tax refund and applied it to the debt. She did not provide documents
to substantiate the debt is resolved. (Tr. 80-82; AE E)
The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.g through 1.k are medical debts. Her insurance company
paid the debts. These debts are resolved. The debt in SOR  ¶ 1.l ($1,445) was paid in
September 2022. The debt in SOR ¶ 1.m was paid in 2022. (Tr. 83-86; AE F, G, H, R)
The  debt in  SOR  ¶ 1.n  ($7,477) is for a  repossessed  vehicle. Applicant purchased
it in 2019  but gave  it  to  her daughter to  drive. Although  the  loan  was  in Applicant’s name,
her daughter was to  make  the  car payments.  Her daughter got  behind  in  payments  and
did not tell  Applicant.  The  car was repossessed  in May 2023. Applicant  reached  out to
the creditor but was unable to pay the amount they offered. Sometime later in 2023, the
car was sold, and Applicant received a letter advising her she was required to pay the
deficiency balance. She contacted the creditor two weeks before her hearing and agreed
on a  settlement amount of $2,245  to be paid  in installments of $100 a month until the
balance is satisfied. The first payment was due three weeks from the date of hearing. (Tr.
86-93; AE I)
The  SOR  debts are supported  by Applicant’s admissions, disclosures, testimony,
and  a May 2022 credit  report. (GE 1, 2, 3)
Applicant accepted full responsibly for her delinquent debts. She attributed them
to “hardship.” She had some medical issues in 2022 and other periods of time that she
had to take off work. If she had paid sick leave then she used it, but sometimes she did
not and had to take sick leave without pay.  Her daughter also had an injury. Applicant
had  to  take  off  work and  take  her to  doctor’s appointments.  Her daughter was living  in
another state attending college. She stated she is now in a better financial position to pay
her  bills.  She  intends  to  pay  her  delinquent  debts.  She  anticipates  receiving  a  $3,000
federal income tax refund and using it to make some of the payments noted above. (Tr.
71-74, 94-96)
Applicant took a one-day financial management class in late 2023, which required
her to prepare a budget and review how she spends money. It also showed her how to
save money. She also participated in a follow-up overview of her finances after the initial
class. Applicant is also participating in a class that helps educate her about finances and
budgeting. The class meets twice a month and she has attended for several months She
contributes  to  a  retirement  plan  through  her  employer  but  took  a  withdrawal  from  it  in
October 2023 and paid the penalty tax. She used the money to pay her property taxes.
She also took a loan from it in April 2023 that will be repaid by April 2024. She does not
have a saving account and has a minimal amount in her checking account. Her daughter
lives  with  her and  pays  some of the household  expenses  such as for food, household
supplies,  and  the  water  bill.  Applicant  intends  to  return  to  college  in  the  summer  and
believes she is back on track financially and will be able to pay her debts. (Tr. 98-108)
Applicant provided character letters that describe her as an exemplary employee
with  a  great  work  ethic.  She  is  viewed  as  dedicated,  dependable,  professional  and  a
person of integrity. She is passionate about helping others and has had a profound impact
on many lives. (AE J, K, L. M, P)
