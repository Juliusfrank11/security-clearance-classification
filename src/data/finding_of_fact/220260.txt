Applicant,  41,  has  worked  for  his  employer,  a  federal  contractor,  as  a  security
officer since January 2020. He completed a security clearance application, his first, on
May 6, 2020.  He disclosed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy that was discharged in 2013 as well
as  outstanding  federal  and  state  income  taxes.  The  ensuing  investigation  revealed
additional  delinquent  accounts.  The  SOR  alleges  Applicant  owes  $41,358  on  ten
delinquent accounts, including outstanding federal taxes. (GE 1; Tr. 16-17)
Applicant  married  in  July  2003.  Although  he  held  steady  employment  from
August  2003  until  January  2020,  his  wife  worked  sporadically  because  of  an  ongoing
medical  issue.  For  most  of  their  marriage,  Applicant  served  as  the  primary  source  of
income  for  their  family,  which  included  the  couple’s  daughter  and,  at  times,  two  of  his
three stepchildren. Although the couple maintains separate bank accounts,  Applicant’s
wife’s  medical  condition  has  consistently  had  a  negative  impact  on  their  joint  finances
and  caused  them  to  accumulate  debt.  In  July  2013,  the  couple  filed  for  bankruptcy
protection.  Their  debts  were  discharged  in  December  2013.  He  testified  that  within  a
year  of  the  bankruptcy  discharge,  the  couple  began  to  experience  financial  problems
again. (GE 1, 7; Tr. 19-22, 24, 51-53)
Applicant’s tax  problems began  around  2016. Historically, he  and  his wife  chose
to  file their  income  taxes using  the  married  filing  separately status. Prior to  the  2016  tax
year, Applicant claimed  the  couple’s daughter as a  dependent on  his income  tax return.
Since  2016,  his  wife  has claimed  their  daughter as a  dependent. He did  not adjust the
income  tax  withholding  rate  from  his pay to  address the  change, resulting  in additional
income  tax liability each  year between  2016  and  2022.  SOR ¶  1.k  alleges   he  currently
owes  $16,199   in  outstanding   federal  taxes.  He  sought  an   installment  agreement  with
the IRS but could not afford the terms. He is not on  a  formal payment plan  but makes ad
hoc  payments as he  is  able.  At the  time  of the  hearing, he  had  made  two  payments  to
the   IRS   totaling   $375.   He  claims  he   paid  $1,349   in  state   taxes.  He   provided   payment
receipts  for  two  $100  payments  made  to  the  state  tax  authority  in  January  2024.  (AE  A,
D; Answer; Tr. 38-44)
Applicant  denies  owing  the  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.b  and  1.g  - 1.i,  claiming
they  have  been  paid. However,  he  only provided  proof  of  payment  for SOR  ¶  1.b.  He
also  denied  owing  SOR  ¶  1.c,  because  he  believed  it  was  included  in  his  2013
bankruptcy. However, GE 8 shows he reaffirmed the debt during his bankruptcy but did
not  follow  through   with   the   agreed   upon   payment  plan.  In   June   2023,  he   entered   a
payment arrangement for $148  each  month  and  provided  evidence  of the  first payment
in July 2023. He  claims he  established  payment plans  for  the  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶
1.a  and  1.j  but did  not  provide  any  evidence  of  payments. He  admits  the  debts alleged
in  SOR ¶¶ 1.d  –  1.f but has not taken  any steps toward  the resolution of  those accounts.
(AE B; Answer; Tr. 28-38)
Applicant plans to  address his outstanding  debts by taking  on  additional jobs to
earn  more   income.  He   began   working   a   part-time   job   sometime   in   2022,  earning   $10
per hour, working  up  to  ten  hours per week.  At the  time  of  the  hearing, he  also planned
to  start a  second  security job  at a  concert venue.  He planned  to  work shifts on  his days
off   or  in   the   afternoon   and   evenings   before   his  overnight   shift  at   his  full-time   job.   His
wife   is  currently  healthy  and   working.   After  paying   their   recurring   expenses,  Applicant
testified  that he  has over $600  in disposable income  each  month. (Tr. 17-18, 25-27, 46-
50)
