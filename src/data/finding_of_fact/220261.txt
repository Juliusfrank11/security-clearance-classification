In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations with explanations.
His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is 52 years old. He worked for various federal contractors from August
2011 to April 2014, August 2018 to January 2020, and since June 2020. From April 2014
to  April  2018,  he  worked  as  an  independent  contractor  for  a  company  owned  by  the
government of Country A.  He served in the Marine Corps from December 1990 to March
1995 and in the Army from July 1995 to July 2011, was honorably discharged, and retired
as  an  E-7.  He  was  unemployed  from  April  to  August  2018,  and  from  January  to  June
2020. He has held a security clearance since at least 1999. (GE 1, GE 3; Tr. 13, 28-36,
79-84)
Applicant has been  married  since  May 1995. He was previously married  from  May
1991  to  May  1993.  He  has  one  adult  child  and  two  adult  stepchildren, ages 29,  34  and
35. He  graduated  from  high  school in  1989  and  completed  about  36  college  credit hours.
(GE 1; Tr. 83-84)
Applicant  worked  in  Country  A  from  November  2011  to  April  2018.  He  was
employed by a federal contractor from November 2011 to April 2014, and his pay was
subject  to  income  tax  withholding.  He  used  a  tax  preparation  service  provided  by  his
employer to file annual income tax returns for tax year (TY) 2011 through TY 2014. From
April 2014 to April 2018, he earned about $200,000 per year as an independent contractor
for a company owned by  the government of Country A and his pay was not subject to
income tax withholding. (Tr. 22-40; GE 1 at 44-46, GE 2 at 2, GE 3 at 2-4)
In his September 2018 SCA, Applicant disclosed he failed to pay federal and state
income taxes and failed to file federal and state income tax returns for TY 2015 through
TY 2017. In about July 2018, he hired a tax service company (TSC) to counsel him, to
prepare and file his delinquent returns, and to negotiate payment agreements with federal
and  state  tax  authorities.  In  August  2018,  the  TSC  estimated  his  federal  income  tax
liability for TY 2015 through TY 2017 as $86,264, including $54,371 for TY 2015, $16,074
for  TY  2016,  and  $15,818  for  TY  2017.  The  TSC  informed  Applicant  that  interest  and
penalties accrue on unpaid taxes. He submitted evidence he paid the TSC about $9,400,
as of September 2018, and in February 2019 reported he had paid the TSC $12,000 to
assist him. (Tr. 22-41; GE 1 at 44-46, GE 2 at 2-26, GE 3 at 3-16; AE G)
The evidence concerning the allegations in the SOR is summarized below:
SOR ¶  1.a: failed to  file  federal  income  tax  returns  for   TY 2015  through  TY
2020.
Applicant  admitted  the  allegation  and  attributed  his failure to  file his federal  income
tax returns to  bad  advice, his mistaken belief that he  could  file tax returns after returning
to  the  United  States from  overseas,  difficulty  finding  a  preparer to  file  his returns  and  in
obtaining  required  information,  and  delay by a  TSC. Applicant filed  his federal income  tax
returns  for  TY  2019   and   TY  2020   in   May  2022.  He  said  those   filings  were   delayed
because  he  was missing  required  information, had  experienced  difficulties with  tax filing
software, and  tax preparer delay.  He  has not  claimed  or submitted  documentary evidence
he  filed  federal income  tax returns for TY 2015  through  TY  2018. (Answer; GE  1  at 44-
46, GE 3  at 4-5; AE  B, C,  G,  K, L, P, Q; Tr. 22-58)
Applicant testified he had been frustrated with the TSC’s delay in filing his income
tax returns for TY 2015 through TY 2018. When asked about his communications with
the TSC since September 2018, Applicant testified:
I don't  recall. I've  had  some  email  contact  with  them  when  they  were  looking
for different  documentation.  So  I  really haven't --I don't  recall.  Again,  that's
one  of the  things I was hoping  that  would  just go  away,  and  it didn't.  But I
don't recall  -- I know I had  some  contact with  them, but I don't know  when.
So  when  I double-checked  it  . . .  a  couple weeks ago, they asked  for a  2018
[financial document]  that I had  sent them  prior.  . . .  At this point, [I  think they
have  all   they need   to  file  my  returns].  But  not  until about  two   weeks  ago
when they asked for that [document] from  2018.  (Tr. 69-70)
On March 6, 2024, Applicant submitted a statement that the “IRS doesn’t accept
filings  that  have  surpassed  seven  years [and  that  his 2018]  Federal  Taxes  have  been
prepared  and  are  being  submitted  to  the  IRS  [by  the  TSC].”  (AE  O)  He  provided  an
unsigned, undated federal income tax return for TY 2018 and a certified mail receipt dated
March 6, 2024, for mail addressed to the TSC. (AE U, W) He indicated that on March 6,
2024, he forwarded his signed TY 2018 federal income tax return to the TSC, and that
the preparer would sign and then submit the return to the IRS. (AE W at 2)
SOR ¶¶  1.b-1.d:  indebted to  the  federal government  for delinquent   income
taxes   of   about   $54,371   for  TY  2015,  $16,074   for  TY   2016,   and  $15,818   for   2017.
Applicant admitted the allegations and said he intended to pay his tax debt. He testified
his income as an independent contractor in Country A from TY 2015 through TY 2017
was not subject to income tax withholding and that he had not paid federal income taxes
on that income. The overdue tax amounts alleged in the SOR were derived from his TSC’s
estimate  of  federal  tax  liabilities  in  about  August  2018.  Those  estimates  do  not  reflect
interest  or  penalties  that  may  accrue  or  have  accrued  since.  He  has  submitted  no
documentary  evidence he  has  paid  federal income  taxes  due for TY  2015  through  TY
2017. (Answer; Tr. 39-52; GE 1-3; AE G, O, U, W)
On March 6, 2024, Applicant submitted an undated statement indicating he had
downloaded his available tax account documents from the IRS website and that:
is  no   mention   of
There
tax   debt  years  2015,  2016,  or  2017
available/accessible   from   the   IRS   website.  This  is  by  no   means  inferring
they  are  settled,   but  the   IRS   doesn’t  accept  filings  that  have   surpassed
seven years. There is a balance  for those years, and they must be  settled.
I  continue   to   contact  [the   TSC]  with   minor  progress.   My  2018   State   and
Federal Taxes have  been prepared and  are being submitted [by the  TSC].
The  program  which I have  enrolled  with  the  assistance  [of the  TSC] is called
the  New Start Initiative  which  is an  IRS  program  to  become  compliant and
settle  my  tax  debt  to   the   IRS.  It  is  unlikely  I  will   qualify  for  the   “debt
forgiveness.” I have  every intention  to  fulfill this obligation, regardless  of the
decision  made  on  my  security clearance.  I will  do  what is necessary to  repay
the  debt to the IRS.
[I] fully and  completely accept the  responsibility for not paying  my taxes in
full  on  time  as required  by  law. There is no  excuse.  I do  however humbly
request  that you  consider that I  am  current with  my (non-disputed) taxes,
fully employed  with  a  defense  contractor [that]  has been  steadfast in support
of  my  continued   clearance   issue   [and]  has committed   to  me   through   this
process and  continue  to  keep  me  aboard until the  final decision  has  been
made. (AE O)
Applicant  said  he  mailed  his  TY  2018  federal  income  tax  return  to  the  TSC  on
March 6, 2024, and indicated that “[o]nce [the TY 2018 return is filed and] accepted by
the IRS, negotiation (on my behalf) of the [TY] 2015-2017 [taxes] owed will be determined
.  .  .  .  [w]ith  the  assistance  of  [the  TSC]  a  repayment  amount  and  schedule  will  be
established.” (AE W at 2) However, he has not provided documentary evidence he has
paid income taxes due for TY 2015 through TY 2017 or of an arrangement with the IRS
to pay his overdue taxes. (Answer; Tr. 39-41; GE 1-3; AE G, O, U, W)
Applicant timely filed federal income tax returns for TY 2021  and  TY 2022. (AE D-
F, M, N, R, S)  Although not alleged in  the SOR, he had not filed  state income tax returns
for TY 2015  through  TY  2018  prior to  his June  2023  hearing.  (GE  1  at 44-46,  GE  3  at 4;
AE   O,   V,   W   at   1; Tr. 37-39)   He   testified   he  filed   state   income   tax  returns  for  TY   2019
through  TY  2021  and  submitted  some  corroborating  evidence.  (Tr. 53- 57; AE  A, AE  B  at
3-5, AE  C  at  7-9).  He submitted  an  unsigned  TY 2018  state  income  tax return dated  March
4, 2024, a check payable to the state tax authority for $300 and a certified mail receipt for
mail addressed to that tax authority both dated March 6, 2024. (AE O, AE V, AE O at 1).
Applicant testified he earns about $86,000 per year in his current position and that
his wife manages their finances. (Tr. 73-74) He earns about $19,000 annually in Army
retired  pay  and  receives  about  $24,000  annually  in  Department  of  Veterans  Affairs
disability payments for a 90% service-connected disability. He had about $60,000 in joint
savings at some point, owns some stock, and has a retirement account but did not know
the current balances of those accounts. (Tr. 28-30, 71-75)
Any  adverse  information  not  alleged  in  the  SOR  will  not  be  considered  for
disqualification  purposes  but may  be  considered  in  evaluating  application  of mitigating
conditions and in applying the whole-person concept. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-07369
at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017).
