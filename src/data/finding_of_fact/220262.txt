In  his  Answer,  Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.f  with  explanations.  His
admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  50  years  old.  He  was  married  in  1989  and  divorced  in  2008.  He
remarried  in  2010  and  has  two  adult  children  and  one  adult  step-child.  He  attended
some college from 1991 through 1996. He returned to college in 2014 and completed a
bachelor’s degree  in 2018.  From about 2003 through 2016, he worked as a director of
worship  in  a  church.  In  April  2015,  he  began  working  part-time  with  his  current
employer.  In  2016,  he  switched  to  full-time  with  his  employer  and  continued  to  work
part-time  as  an  independent  contractor  for  the  church.  In  2023,  he  changed  positions
with his current employer to business development. He also described earning a small
amount  of  income  from  royalties  he  collects  from  his  work  as  a  musician.  (GX  1,  3;
Tr. 17-25, 41-44)
The SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state  income
tax returns for tax years (TYs) 2018, 2019 and 2021 (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d) and that he owed
delinquent  taxes  of  $3,409  for  TY  2018  (SOR  ¶  1.f)  and  $3,368  for  TY  2019  (SOR
¶ 1.e).  The  allegations  are  established  by  his  admissions,  his  responses
to
interrogatories, and by various IRS and state tax documents. (GX 1-4)
Applicant’s  tax  issues  began  with  TY  2018  when  he  tried  to  deduct  additional
expenses from his part-time work for the church as an independent contractor while he
was  full-time  with  his  current  employer.  In  early  2019,  Applicant  hired  an  individual  to
prepare  his  TY  2018  federal  and  state  income  tax  filings.  That  person  was  slow  to
request  necessary  information  from  Applicant  and  Applicant  was  slow  to  respond.  He
testified  that,  as  the  deadline  drew near, “there  [were] additional things  that they  were
asking for that I did not have at the time … I became frustrated with the preparer, and
we missed the filing deadline, and it continued to drag on into the summer, into the fall,
and I did not file an extension. They didn't even recommend that I file an extension.” At
an  unspecified  date,  he  hired  another  tax  preparer  who,  similarly,  was  unable  to
complete his TY 2018 filing. He testified then, “I tried to do it myself and tried to put my
head through a wall, trying to figure it all out.” (GX 1-3; Tr. 24, 39-43, 48-50)
With TY 2018 unresolved, Applicant also failed to timely file his TY 2019 federal
and state income tax returns and his tax situation began to “snowball.” He testified that
he  began  to  look  for  another  tax  preparer  that  would  be  more  responsive,  but  also
admitted  that  he  procrastinated  during  this  period  out  of  frustration  over  the  process.
(GX 1-3; Tr. 42-45)
Applicant disclosed both delinquent tax returns in his November 2020 SCA  and
stated  that  he  “expect[ed] the situation to be resolved before January 2021.” However,
he  then  failed  to  file  his  TY  2020  return  on  time.  He  hired  a  new  tax  preparer  in  late
2021. In December 2021, he filed his federal and state income tax returns for TYs 2018,
2019 and 2020. (GX 1-3; Tr. 42, 48-54)
Federal  tax  account  transcripts,  printed  in  October  2022,  reflect  that  Applicant
received penalties for the late filing of his TYs 2018, 2019 and 2020 income tax returns
and  that  he  owed  about  $6,784  in  delinquent  federal  taxes  for  TYs  2018  and  2019.
Applicant did not owe any additional taxes for TY 2020. An installment agreement was
established  in  June  2022  where  Applicant  would  pay  $75  per  month.  However,
documents only show a $44 payment made in August 2022 and a $75 payment made in
September  2022.  He  testified  that  payments  were  ongoing  but  did  not  provide  any
additional payment records. (GX 2-3; Tr. 21, 27-28)
Although Applicant  claimed to have  continued working with the tax preparer, he
failed to timely file his TY 2021 and TY 2022 federal and state income tax returns. At the
hearing, he testified that his work as an independent contractor as well as royalties he
collected  from  his  music  again  complicated  his  income  tax  returns.  He  also  described
difficulties  in  communicating  with  the  tax  preparer  as  a  cause  for  the  delays.  He
switched to another tax preparer in early 2023 and was scheduled to meet with her the
day  after  the  hearing  to  finalize  his  TY  2021  and  TY  2022  income  tax  returns.  He
testified that this new tax preparer was great to work with and he intended to retain her
services to prepare his TY 2023 and future income tax returns. (GX 4; Tr. 37-40, 52-55)
Outside of his delinquent tax filings and back taxes owed, Applicant had no other
financial issues. Based on his salary, his work as an independent contractor and a small
amount of royalties, he estimated that he earned about $135,000 to $140,000 annually
and was able to meet his monthly expenditures. (GX 1, 3; Tr. 44-46)
