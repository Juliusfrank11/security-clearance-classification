Applicant is a 33-year-old cyber operations lead analyst who has been employed
by  a  defense  contractor  since  September  2022.  He  seeks  to  retain  his  Top
Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) Clearance, which is requirement
of his continued employment. (Tr. 17-18, 83, 96-99) Applicant successfully held Secret
and  Top  Secret  clearances  while  he  was  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  Army,  discussed
below. (Tr. 97)
Applicant graduated from high school in May 2009. He was awarded a Bachelor
of  Science  Degree  in  Criminal  Justice  and  Cyber  Security  in  August  2018;  and  a
Master’s  Degree  in  Organizational  Leadership  in  August  2019.  At  the  time  of  his
hearing, Applicant was pursuing a Ph.D. in Cyber Security. (Tr. 19-20; 22-25) Applicant
has  been  married  two  times.  His  first  marriage  was  from  August  2012  to  December
2017,  and  his  second  marriage  was  from  March  2019  to  May  2022.  Both  marriages
ended  by divorce. Applicant  does not have any  children.  (Tr. 25-26,  32-38, 44-45,  55-
57, 61-73, 84-87; AE H, AE I)
Applicant’s first wife  was an active duty Army soldier, who he met on  post. She
has  since  separated  from  the  Army.  Applicant’s  second  wife  was  a  Japanese  flight
attendant, who he met  online. When Applicant and his second wife  divorced, she was
working  in  a  Japanese  restaurant.  (Tr.  74-76,  78-79,  83)  Applicant  initiated  divorce
proceedings  to  end  both  of  his  marriages.  Neither  of  his  wives  wanted  a  divorce.  (Tr.
101)
Applicant served  in the Army from November 2009 to January 2017, and in the
Army Reserve from January 2017 to January 2020.  He was honorably discharged as a
sergeant (pay grade E-5). He was subsequently awarded a Veterans Affairs (VA) 100%
disability rating as a result of injuries he sustained on active duty. (Tr. 26-29) Since his
release from active duty, he has worked exclusively for defense contractors. (Tr. 97-98)
Criminal Conduct/Personal Conduct
The  concerns  identified  under  these  Guidelines  are  listed  as  three  separate
allegations  and  are  discussed  in  order  as  listed  in  the  SOR.  Applicant  testified  on  his
own behalf, and I found his testimony to be credible.
SOR ¶  1.a  –  In May 2017, Applicant was arrested and charged with abuse of a
family member and household members, and a temporary restraining order (TRO) was
entered again him. The complainant was Applicant’s first wife. The charge was initially
dismissed without prejudice and later dismissed with prejudice. (Tr. 39-43; GE 2, GE 5,
AE  A,  AE  F)  Applicant  was  not  required  to  attend  domestic  violence  counseling
following this arrest. (Tr. 79-80)
SOR  ¶   1.b   –   In  July  2019,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  abuse  of
family and household members. The complainant was Applicant’s second wife. (Tr. 50-
51, 57-59) The charge was dismissed with prejudice for lack of evidence. (Tr. 103; AE
A)
SOR  ¶   1.c  –   In  February  2020,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  a
domestic  violence  crime  and  a  TRO  was  entered  against  him.  Again,  the  complainant
was Applicant’s second wife. (Tr. 52, 59; GE 6; AE E). The charge was dismissed with
prejudice,  as  in  the  two  previous  cases,  because  his  former  spouse  failed  to  appear.
(Tr. 60, 101; AE A)
All  three  arrests  were  subsequently  expunged,  and  the  records  of  arrest  were
annulled. The State’s Attorney General issued Applicant expungement certificates. The
certificates authorized Applicant to state in response to any question or inquiry, whether
or not under oath, that he had no record regarding these arrests. Applicant testified that
his case was dismissed because his former spouses failed to appear and added, “[y]es,
[a]nd I just didn’t do the crime.” (Tr. 43-44, 49-50, 79-83, 101-102; 103, GE 1, GE 8; AE
A, AE C, AE D)
Following  his  TRO  hearing  in  February  2020,  Applicant  volunteered  to  attend
domestic  violence  classes.  He  did  so  for  the  duration  of  the  active  restraining  order.
These classes were online and consisted of sharing experiences with other people and
teaching  different  approaches  to  communicating  with  one’s  spouse.  In  August  2020,
Applicant’s  TRO was dismissed, and he  stopped  taking  the online classes. (Tr. 49-50,
79-83, 101-102; GE 1, GE 8)
Applicant  reiterated  the  reason  the  domestic  violence  charges/TRO  petitions
were  dismissed  in  all three  cases  was  because neither of his wives  appeared in  court
because “there wasn’t any proof that [he] actually did these (offenses).”  He added that
he was never abusive to either of his wives. (Tr. 101)
In November 2021 Applicant applied for, and in December 2021 he received, an
eight-year  restraining  order  until  December  2029  against  his  second  spouse.  Since
Applicant’s  appearance  in  divorce  court  in  May  2021,  he  has  had  no  contact  with  his
second spouse and has no idea where she is. (Tr. 70-74, 76-78; AE C, AE B)
During  the  timeframe of  August  2017 to  December 2017,  Applicant  consulted  a
psychiatrist  at  the  VA  for  stress  related  to  his  2017  divorce.  Applicant  does  not  recall
being  given  a  diagnosis  but  was  provided  medication  to  help  him  sleep  that  he  no
longer takes. At the time of his hearing, Applicant was seeing a psychologist on an as-
needed basis to help him cope with depression following his divorces. (Tr. 47-49, 101;
GE 1)
Applicant asserts that he is a law-abiding citizen who respects the law. He added
that  he  is  a  ten-year  Army  veteran  who  lived  by  Army  core  values  of  loyalty,  duty,
selfless service, honor, integrity, and personal courage. He acknowledges making poor
choices in his personal life but is not a threat to national security. He considers himself a
patriot and loves his country. (Tr. 102; AE A)
Law and Policies
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (EO)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive
5220.6, Defense Industrial  Personnel Security  Clearance  Review Program  (January 2,
1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  adjudicative  guidelines  (AG),  which  became
effective on June 8, 2017.
When  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability
the
administrative  judge  must  consider  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  In  addition  to  brief
introductory  explanations  for  each  guideline,  the  adjudicative  guidelines  list  potentially
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information.

These  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the
complexities  of  human  behavior,  administrative  judges  apply  the  guidelines  in

scrutiny  of  a  number  of  variables  known  as  the  “whole-person  concept.”  The
administrative  judge must  consider  all available,  reliable  information  about  the  person,
past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.

fair,
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b)
requires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  national  security
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.”
Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.14,  the  Government  must  present  evidence  to  establish
controverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  the  applicant  is
responsible  for presenting  “witnesses  and  other  evidence  to  rebut,  explain,  extenuate,
or  mitigate  facts  admitted  by  the  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel.”  The
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.
the  Government  predicated  upon
A  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary
trust  and  confidence.  This
relationship  with
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The
Government  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of
the  possible  risk  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard
classified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible
extrapolation  of  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified
information.
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be  “in  terms of the
national  interest  and  shall  in  no  sense  be  a  determination  as  to  the  loyalty  of  the
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites
for access to classified or sensitive information).
