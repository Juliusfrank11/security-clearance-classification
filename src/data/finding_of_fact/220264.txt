In Applicant’s May 2021 SCA, he disclosed he failed to file and pay his federal and
state income taxes for tax year 2020. He indicated he had “been having … ongoing issues
with [his] taxes.” He estimated the largest amount he owed was $27,000 but claimed he
had paid most of the debt. He also disclosed two vehicle repossessions, and indicated
they were the result of his ongoing tax issues. (GE 1 at 43-45)
In  July  2021,  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator,  and  his
financial issues were discussed.  At that time, he  disclosed he had not filed his federal
income  tax  returns  for TYs  2016  through  2020, despite  contacting  the  IRS, tax advocates,
and   a   “tax collector”  for more  details.   His tax  issues  were  an   ongoing  problem,   in part,
due  to  withdrawals from  his retirement accounts.  He told  the  investigator he  owed  $7,500
to the IRS, and he intended to resume making payments by the end of 2021. (GE  4 at 3)
DOHA sent Applicant interrogatories at an unspecified date, and he responded in
August  2022.  In  his  response,  he  adopted  the  summary  of  the  July  2021  security
interview, discussed supra, and he answered additional questions regarding the status of
his unfiled income tax returns and delinquent taxes. He claimed he filed his federal income
tax  returns  through  TY  2021.  He  was  asked  to  provide  copies  of  his  IRS  account
transcripts  for  TY  2015  through  2021;  however,  he  provided  IRS  wage  and  income
transcripts.  A  second  request  was  sent  to  him  in  August  2022,  and  he  provided  IRS
account transcripts for TY 2016 to 2021. (GE 4; GE 5; Tr. 15, 25-26)
At the hearing, Applicant testified that his  tax issues started in 2000. In 2005 or
2006, the IRS notified him he owed approximately $27,000. At some unrecalled year, he
filed without having all his W-2s, and the IRS accused him of fraud. (Tr. 24-25) He utilized
tax professionals in the past to file his taxes but at the hearing could not recall which TY
were filed for him by others. (GE 3 at 6; Tr. 25-26, 29)
Applicant lived  in  State  A  from  2001  to  2016.  He received  a  $20,000  buyout  from
Company  A   to   move   to   State   B   in   2016.  In   2017,  he   “cashed   in”   stock  options  from
Company B, worth  $16,000, and  in 2018, he  withdrew $16,000  from  his 401k  at Company
B   to   pay  his  bills.  He  had   difficulty  obtaining   the   necessary  tax  documents  related   his
early withdrawal to  file his tax return. In  2021,  he  moved  from  State  B  to  State  C, at that
time  he “cashed out” $20,000  from Company B 401k  to pay bills. (Tr. 26, 29-41)
Applicant  testified  he  failed  to  file  his  federal  income  tax  returns  for  TYs  2013,
2014,  and  2018  in  a  timely  manner  because  he  did  not  have  all  the  requisite  W-2s.
However, he believed he paid the taxes he owed for TY 2013, as he had previously set
up “a couple payment plans” with the IRS and “increased the taxes that came out of [his]
check.” However, he did not provide account transcripts or proof of filing for TYs 2013
and 2014 at the hearing or in his post-hearing submission. Nor did he provide proof of
payments or resolution of his outstanding federal taxes for TYs 2016, 2017, and 2020.
(Tr. 27-28, 32)
Applicant provided a document from a tax preparer for his TY 2018 federal income
tax  return.  In  some  places  the  document  is  dated  March  12,  2022,  and  it  indicates
Applicant is entitled to receive a refund of $185; however, it is not clear the return was
filed  and  received  by  the  IRS,  nor  does  it  reflect  any  potential  late  fees  or  penalties.
According  to  his  August  22,  2022  IRS  account  transcript  for  TY  2018  (included  in
response to interrogatories), the IRS had not received a filing from him. He did not provide
an  updated  account  transcript  after  the  hearing.  Applicant  filed  his  TY  2019  federal
income  tax  return  late  on  April  4,  2022,  and  there  is  no  evidence  in  the  record  of  an
extension. He did not provide proof of payments or resolution of his outstanding federal
taxes for TY 2020. Finally, he testified that his last proactive contact with the IRS was in
2016. (GE 5 at 9; AE A; AE C; Tr. 35-36)
Applicant  testified  he  resolved  SOR  ¶  1.e,  a  $166  insurance  debt  placed  for
collection in  June  2002; however, he  failed to  provide proof of  resolution.  He provided
documentation  demonstrating  he  resolved  SOR  ¶¶  1.f  ($1,255/cellular  bill)  and  1.g
($235/medical bill) in February 2022. These accounts became delinquent in December
2019 and October 2020, respectively. Additionally, SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.g do not appear on
his most recent credit bureau report. (GE 6 at 4-7; GE 7; AE B; Tr. 66-72)
Applicant  currently  earns  $71,000  annually,  and,  after  paying  his  bills,  his  net
monthly remainder is less  than $500.  As of  the date of the hearing,  he  had $25  in his
savings  account,  $2,000  in  his  checking  account,  and  approximately  $24,000  in  his
retirement  account.  He  does  not  follow  a  written  budget,  nor  has  he  received  credit
counseling. (GE 3 at 9-11; Tr. 18-20, 24)
