Applicant admitted the allegations in the SOR ¶¶ a. through 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.h.
He did not admit or deny SOR 1.i, 2.a and 2.b, but rather provided explanations. I will
consider his response as denials.  After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings,
testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 59 years old. He served in the military from 1988 to 1990 and received
a hardship discharge, which was honorable. He reenlisted in December 2001 and served
in combat in Iraq from April 2003 to November 2003. He earned a bachelor’s degree in
2007.  He  married  in  1996  and  divorced  in  2012.  He  has  a  child  from  a  previous
relationship and two children from the marriage. His youngest child has special needs,
and  Applicant  provides  financial  support  to  her  as  needed.  He  and  his  ex-wife  share
guardianship  over  her.  He  remarried  in  June  2021.  He  has  worked  for  his  current
employer, a federal contractor, since 2008 and has held a security clearance since then.
He  stated  that  he  has  earned  approximately  $67,000  a  year  since  2008  with  minimal
raises. During his marriage to his first wife, she earned about $65,000 until she became
unemployed  for  a  period  after  their  divorce.  His  second  wife  earns  approximately
$140,000 annually. (Tr. 16-29; GE 1)
During Applicant’s tour in Iraq, he was injured when he leaped from his vehicle to
avoid an attack on his convoy. He cracked his femur and had muscle tears in his knees.
He completed his enlistment in December 2004 and received an honorable discharge. In
2009, he was awarded a Veteran’s Affairs (VA) disability rating of 30%. He received about
$500 a month from the VA. He resubmitted a VA claim in August 2022 with a diagnosis
of post-traumatic stress disorder and was awarded a 100% disability rating in December
2022. He receives $4,109 a month for his VA disability. (Tr 21-26; AE B)
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant  had  delinquent  debts  that  included  approximately
$104,137 of delinquent student loans (SOR ¶¶ 1.a - 1.d). He began taking out student
loans  when  he  was  attending  college  in  1995.  He  testified  that  he  made  consistent
payments but after he got married the first time, he got behind and requested a deferment.
At some  point,  he  stopped  attending  college  but went  back  in  2005  and  took  out additional
loans.  He said he  was paying  the  loans  through  the  school  while  he  was attending.  Once
he  graduated  in  2007, he  said he  continued  paying  the  loans. In  2009,  when  he  began  to
receive VA  disability payments,  he  said he  used  those  funds to  pay his student loans. He
stated  he  continued  to  pay the  student loans  until his 2012  divorce. He  then  contacted
the   student  loan   creditor to   obtain   a   deferment  or an   income-based   payment  plan.  He
said he  got the  plan  and  started  to  pay it but  then  his divorce, child  support and  his ex-
wife’s  unemployment  impacted  his finances. He also stated  in his SOR answer that the
interest  rate  on  his mortgage  increased  due  to  the  housing  crisis and  that increased  his
mortgage  payments.  Apparently,  he  had  an  adjustable-rate  mortgage.  (Tr. 39-64;  SOR
answer)
Applicant  said  he  contacted  the  student  loan  creditor  and  requested  another
deferment  until  he  could  make  consistent  payments.  When  the  deferment  expired,  he
would  get  a  payment  plan,  make  payments  for  a  few  months,  then  stop  due  to  other
financial priorities, such as his children’s medical and other needs. He said about 65% of
his  income  was  going  for  child  support  and  his  mortgage.  In  2016,  his  oldest  child
graduated  from  high  school,  and  he  was  not  required  to  pay  child  support  for  him.
Although his child support decreased by half, he used this money to help with his child’s
college expenses and other bills. His loans were in default and in 2020 were placed in a
deferment status under the CARES Act due to the pandemic. He testified that from 2016
to 2020, he made sporadic payments toward his student loan debts. In his SOR answer,
he  attributed  his  inability  to  pay  his  student  loans  to  having  a  young  family,  a  new
mortgage, and interest rates increasing on his mortgage. (Tr. 39-64)
Applicant stated in his SOR answer that when his student loans were deferred due
to the pandemic in 2020, it allowed him to catch up on his other financial obligations. In
his answer, he stated that he intended to apply for the “Fresh Start” program, which he
did in December 2022. In July 2023, his VA disability was increased to 100% and the total
amount he owed for federal student loans were discharged  due to his disability status.
The student loans are resolved. (Tr. 39-64; AE B)
Applicant disputed the debt in SOR ¶ 1.d ($4,433). He explained in 2017 the roof
of his house was damaged in a storm. An unsolicited person came to his house asking to
repair his roof. Applicant and the person agreed an estimate would be provided but he
clearly told the person that he was not agreeing to contract with the company. He provided
Applicant  an  estimate  and  there  was  no  further  contact  with  this  salesperson  or  the
company. They did not do any work for Applicant. In late 2017, he was contacted by the
company that provided an estimate and it demanded payment. He told them he did not
owe  any  debt  to  them.  He  was  told  he  needed  to  pay  them  for  their  estimate,  or  they
would send the debt to a collection company. Applicant refused. When he saw the debt
on his credit bureau account, he contacted the collector and asked them to provide him
with  a  copy  of  a  signed  contract.  They  were  unable  to  produce  a signed  contract  and
removed  the  debt  from  his  account.  Applicant  provided  documents  to  substantiate  his
actions. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 29-38; AE A)
SOR ¶ 1.f alleged Applicant had a delinquent credit card in collection ($3,227). He
testified  that  this  credit  card  became  delinquent  in  approximately  2013  or  2014.  A
judgment was entered against Applicant for the balance owed on the debt. In February
2022, the creditor agreed to settle the judgment for less than the amount owed ($2,049).
Applicant  was  able  to  pay  the  settlement  after  he  sold  his  house  in  2021,  as  detailed
below. In his post-hearing statement, he said he was unaware of the debt until he received
a letter from a debt collector. The debt is resolved. (Tr. 90-93; AE C, D)
During  his hearing, Applicant was  asked  if  he  filed  and  paid his federal and  state
taxes on  time,  and  he  confirmed  he  filed  the  returns on  time.  He said he  has a  federal
income  tax  debt  for 2013  (approximately $9,000) and  he  also  owes  approximately  $6,000
for tax years 2014  and  2015. He did not pay the  taxes because  he  did not have  the  money.
He had  been  a  1099  employee  in addition  to  his regular employment.  He  stated  that the
IRS   withheld   any  refunds  he   may  have   been   entitled   to   in  subsequent  tax   years  and
applied  them  to  his delinquent balance. At the  time  of his hearing, he  had  not made  any
independent  payments  towards  these  tax  debts. He testified  that  he  received  notifications
from the IRS  advising  him of how to  address  his delinquent tax debts. It also told him the
IRS  would withhold any refunds he  may be  entitled  to.  Prior to  his  hearing, he had  not
contacted  the  IRS  to  make  any payment arrangements  and  did  not  have  a  payment  plan.
(Tr. 69-83, 96-97)
Applicant further testified that in 2020 he contacted the IRS because he wanted to
find out why a tax return had been rejected. He was told he could request tax transcripts
from their website. He said when he went on the website, he found out his 2013 tax debt
had been reduced when his refunds were applied to the balance, and he had a balance
owed of about $9,000. He explained when he sold his house, he used the profit for other
expenses and did not prioritize his student loans or income tax debt. (Tr. 72-78)
Applicant testified that he sold his house in June 2021. He received approximately
$105,000 profit from the sale. He said it was his intention to obtain a payment plan at that
time to repay his student loan debt. He said he used about $35,000 to pay other debts he
owed but were not delinquent. He paid property taxes that were three years in arrears for
property he owns in another state. He said he did not have the money to pay these taxes
when  due.  He  estimated  he  owed  about  $1,400  on  one  parcel  of  land  and  $900  on
another. His wife had medical bills that  were not covered by insurance, and they were
about  $15,000  to  $20,000  in  out-of-pocket  expenses.  He  also  decided  to  invest  in  his
uncle’s start-up business. He referred to it as his retirement savings. He invested about
$25,000 in it. He stated that by December 2022 he had about $15,000 remaining from the
profit on the sale of his house. He did not use any of the profits from the sale of his home
to make payments at the time on his delinquent federal income taxes. Applicant currently
has approximately $1,300 in his bank accounts. (Tr. 64-78, 82)
In Applicant’s September 2021 security clearance application (SCA), he disclosed
he took foreign trips to the Bahamas in 2014, 2016 and 2019 to visit his family and his
2019 trip was to attend his grandmother’s funeral. He also traveled to Mexico in 2018 for
vacation (6-10 days), 2020 (1-5 days), and in 2021 (6-10 days). He traveled again in 2021
to Costa Rica (1-5 days). (Tr. 83, 93-94; GE 1)

2014,
Post-hearing,  Applicant  provided  IRS  tax  transcripts  regarding  his  delinquent
federal income taxes. Applicant testified that he was receiving notices from the IRS about
the delinquent taxes. He did not provide IRS tax transcripts for tax years 2013, 2016 or
2017. He provided a document from the IRS noting “N/A” by the years 2016 and 2017.
His tax year 2014 transcript reports a notice was issued to him regarding his delinquent
tax debt in 2016, 2017, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023. His tax year 2015 transcript reports
a notice was issued regarding his delinquent tax debt in 2016, 2018, 2020, 2021, 2022
and 2023. (AE F, G)
I  find  there  is  substantial  evidence  to  conclude  Applicant  deliberately  failed  to
disclose his delinquent federal income tax debts on his SCA. I find because there was
confusion due to the pandemic regarding the technical status of Applicant’s student loans,
the evidence is insufficient to conclude he deliberately failed to disclose their prior default
status. I also find that there is insufficient evidence to conclude that Applicant was aware
he  had  a  delinquent  credit  card  debt  (SOR  ¶  1.f)  owed  until  he  was  notified  by  the
collection  company.  I  do  not  have  evidence  that  he  was  aware  of  this  debt  prior  to
completing the September 2021 SCA. His statement on the SCA that all of his debts were
paid in full was misleading and false.
In his post-hearing submission, Applicant stated his 2021 federal income tax return
has been electronically filed. He explained that this was the year he remarried, and his
wife  filed  as  single  because  they  did  not  marry  until  June.  He  filed  as  married  filing
separately. The IRS was unable to process the return. He stated he has now refiled as
single, and the return was accepted, and it is waiting to be processed. He provided his
tax  year 2021 transcript  which reflects that as  of February 8, 2024,  the  return had  not
been filed. It also notes Applicant received the government’s tax relief credit of $1,400 in
March 2021 and a notice was issued in April 2021. He did not provide any documentary
proof that his 2021 federal income tax return was filed. However, I believe Applicant filed
his 2021 income tax return after his hearing. (AE K)
Post-hearing, Applicant provided a document from the IRS showing a payment of
$2,980 was pending as of February 21, 2024. Applicant indicated this would be applied
to  his  2014  tax  debt  and  satisfy  the  debt  for  tax  year  2014.  He  also  provided  an  IRS
installment agreement signed on February 27, 2024, which provides that $420 monthly
payments  would  begin  in  April  2024.  These  payments  will  be  applied  to  outstanding
balances for tax years 2013 and 2015. The amount owed as of the date of the agreement
is $8,307. (AE D, E, F, N, O)
I have not considered any derogatory information not alleged in the SORs in the
application of disqualifying conditions. I may consider this information in the application
of  mitigating  conditions,  in  making  a  credibility  determination,  and  in  my  whole-person
analysis.
