Applicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer since 2019. He served on active duty in the U.S. military from 2001
until he was honorably discharged in 2013. He has a General Educational Development
(GED)  high  school  equivalency  diploma.  He  married  in  2001.  He  and  his  ex-wife
separated in  2003  but did not  divorce until about 2019. He  lives with  his girlfriend. He
has two adult children. (Tr. at 27, 40-41, 44-45; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 11)
Applicant was arrested in November 2005 and charged with the felony offense of
hindering  apprehension/prosecution  of  a  known  felon.  He  pleaded  guilty  to  the
misdemeanor  charge  of  hindering  apprehension  or  prosecution.  He  was  sentenced  in
January  2007  in  a  deferred  adjudication  to  probation  for  six  months,  a  fine,  and  court
costs.  He  stated  that  the  offense  was  related  to  the  police’s  attempt  to  apprehend  his
then girlfriend’s brother. (Tr. at 28; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 6, 8, 9, 11)
Applicant  was  arrested  in  November  2007  and  charged  with  driving  while
intoxicated  (DWI).  He  pleaded  no  contest  or  nolo  contendere  to  DWI  in  September
2009.  He  was  sentenced  to  confinement  for  three  days,  a  fine,  and  court  costs.  The
2005 and 2007 offenses both occurred in the vicinity of the military post where Applicant
was  stationed.  The  military  was  notified  of  both  arrests.  He  attended  the  military’s
Alcohol and Substance Abuse Program on his military installation after the DWI  arrest.
He stated that he now drinks responsibly and does not drink and drive. He has not been
arrested  or  charged  with  anything  since  the  2007  DWI.  (Tr.  at  28,  37-38;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 6-9, 11)
Applicant  submitted  a  Declaration  for  Federal  Employment  on  March  30,  2015.
He answered “No”  to the question that asked: “During the last 7 years, have you been
convicted, been imprisoned, been on probation, or been on parole? (Includes felonies,
firearms or explosives violations, misdemeanors, and all other offenses.)” Applicant was
arrested for DWI in 2007, which was beyond the seven-year period of the question, but
his  conviction  in  September  2009  should  have  been  reported.  Applicant  denied
intentionally  providing  false  information  on  the  declaration.  He  thought  the  crime  was
beyond the reporting period. (Tr. at 29-30; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 10, 11)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
October  2020.  He  answered  “No”  to  all  the  police  record  questions  under  Section  22.
The  first  block  of  questions  asked  for  information  that  occurred  “In  the  last seven (7)
years.”  The  second  block  of  questions  asked  for  information  that  “EVER”  happened,
including questions that asked:
Have   you   EVER   been   charged   with   any  felony  offense?   (Include   those
under the  Uniform  Code  of Military Justice  and  non-military/ civilian  felony
offenses)
Have   you   EVER   been   charged   with   an   offense   involving   alcohol  or
drugs?  (GE 1)
The  2005  felony  charge  of  hinder  apprehension/prosecution  of  a  known  felon
should  have  been  reported  even  if  it  resulted  in  a  deferred  adjudication  of  a
misdemeanor offense. The 2007 DWI charge should also have been reported. Applicant
denied intentionally providing false information on the SF 86. He stated he misread the
questions  and  thought  he  was  only supposed  to  go  back  ten  years.  He  stated  that he
would not lie about his past because “I know you guys know more about me than I do,
so  I  wasn’t  trying  to  hide  nothing.  I  just  don’t  remember  everything.”  (Tr.  at  30-35;
Applicant’s response to SOR)
The SOR alleges three delinquent debts for $19,547 (SOR ¶ 1.a), $2,978 (SOR ¶
1.b),  and  $645  (SOR  ¶  1.c).  The  debts  are  listed  on  one  or  more  credit  reports  from
November 2020, December 2021, August 2022, and September 2023.
All  four  credit  reports  list  the  for  $19,547  charged-off  joint  auto  loan  alleged  in
SOR  ¶  1.a.  The  last  payment  was  made  in  July  2017.  The  two  most  recent  credit
reports  include  the  comment:  “Consumer  Disputes  After  Resolution.”  Applicant  denied
responsibility for the debt. (Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-4, 12)
Applicant stated that he did not report this debt on the Questionnaire for National
Security  Positions  (SF  86)  he  submitted  in  October  2020  because  he  was  not
responsible  for  the  loan.  He  discussed  the  loan  during  his  background  interview  in
December 2020. The unauthenticated, and therefore less reliable, report of investigation
of Applicant’s background interview indicated that Applicant told the investigator that he
discovered the loan when he applied for a mortgage about a month after he submitted
the SF 86. He stated that his ex-wife took the loan out partially in his name without his
consent or knowledge, and he did not cosign for the loan. He stated that he planned to
contact his ex-wife and ask her to pay the debt, which he did not expect her to do. He
also  told  the  investigator  that  he  had  been  separated  from  his  ex-wife  for  a  very  long
time before his divorce. He stated that if she did not pay the debt, he would contact the
creditor and set up a settlement arrangement for the debt. He stated that he intended to
address the debt sometime in 2021. (Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 11)
Applicant testified at his hearing that it was an ex-girlfriend who presumably took
out  the  loan,  not  his  ex-wife.  He  indicated  that  after  they  broke  up,  the  ex-girlfriend
moved  to  a  state  where  he  never  lived.  His credit  report  listed  that  an  address  in  that
state  was  reported  in  November  2018.  The  credit  report  also  listed  that  Applicant  had
another auto loan in his name alone from September 2016 through February 2018. He
submitted a letter from the auto financing company purportedly to show that he did not
have an account with the company. However,  the September 2022  response  from the
company  indicated  they  were  responding  to  Applicant’s  inquiry  dated  September  20,
2022,  “requesting  the  removal  of  an  [auto  financing  company]  credit  inquiry  from  [his]
credit report issued by one or more credit reporting agencies.” The company indicated it
was  unable  to  locate  any  information  about  Applicant  in  their  records  and  requested
additional information such as his full name and the last four digits of his Social Security
number. Applicant never responded to the request for additional information. He stated
that he read the letter as indicating the company was unable to locate his account. (Tr.
at 15-26, 46; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-5, 12; AE A)
Applicant contacted the auto financing company after the hearing. He wrote in his
email, “I called [auto financing company] and now they do have my personal information
on the account. So I now [sic] I will have to try and figure that out.” (AE D)
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges a $2,978 delinquent debt on the financing for leased furniture.
Credit  reports  from  November  2020  and  December  2021  indicate  the  charged-off
account  was  assigned  in  November  2013  for  about  $5,255,  with  the  last  activity  in
February 2015 or September 2015, and a balance of $2,978. Applicant settled the debt
with  a  $884  payment  received  on  or  before  September  26,  2022,  which  is  after  he
received the SOR. (Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 4, 5, 11; AE B)
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges a  $645 delinquent debt for a department store credit card. A
credit  report  from  November  2020  indicates  the  charged-off  account  was  assigned  in
May 2013; it had a balance of $645; and the last activity was in March 2017. Applicant
paid  the  debt  in  full  on  August  24,  2021,  which  was  before  he  received  the  SOR,  but
after he was questioned about the debt during his background investigation. (Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 4, 5, 11; AE C)
Applicant’s  finances  are  otherwise  in  reasonable  shape.  He  received  financial
classes  when  he  was  in  the  military,  but  no  formal  financial  counseling.  He  and  his
girlfriend share their expenses, and his children do not live at home.  The credit reports
indicate  he  paid  a  small  collection  account  in  November  2016.  Excepting  the  SOR
debts, he has not accrued any additional delinquent debts since 2016. (Tr. at 28, 38-44;
GE 3-5, 11, 12)
Applicant  answered  “No”  to  all  the  financial  questions  under  Section  26  of  his
October 2020 SF 86, which included the following:
In  the   last  seven  (7)   years,  [have]   you   defaulted   on  any  type   of   loan?
(Include   financial  obligations  for  which   you   were   the   sole   debtor,  as  well
as those for which you  were  a cosigner or guarantor)
In the  last  seven  (7) years, [have]  you  had  bills or debts  turned  over to  a
collection   agency?   (Include   financial  obligations  for   which   you   were  the
sole debtor, as well  as those for which you were a cosigner or guarantor)
In  the   last  seven   (7)   years,   [have]   you   had   any  account  or  credit  card
suspended, charged off,  or cancelled  for failing  to  pay as agreed?  (Include
financial obligations for which  you  were  the  sole debtor, as well as those
for which you were a cosigner or guarantor)
In the  last seven (7) years, [have  you]  been  over 120  days delinquent on
any  debt  not  previously  entered?  (Include   financial  obligations  for  which
you  were  the  sole debtor, as well as those  for which  you  were  a  cosigner
or guarantor)
[Are  you]   currently  over  120   days  delinquent  on   any  debt?   (Include
financial obligations for which  you  were the  sole  debtor, as  well as those
for which  you were  a cosigner  or guarantor)1
Applicant  discussed  the  three  SOR  debts  during  his  background  interview  in
December 2020. He told the investigator that he discovered the debts when he applied
for a mortgage about a month after he submitted the SF 86. (GE 11)
Applicant denied intentionally providing false information on the SF 86. He stated
he  was  not  responsible  for  the  defaulted  auto  loan,  and  he  lost  track  of  the  other  two
debts. (Tr. at 33-34; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 11)
