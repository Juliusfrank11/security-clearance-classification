Applicant is  64  years old  and has  three sons,  ages  23, 20,  and 16. He married his
first wife  in 1980,  they divorced  in 1981, and  he  has been  married  to  his second  wife  since
1999. He entered  the  United  States in 1977  on  a  student visa but did not earn a  college
degree. He took online  courses in 2016  and  2017  and  has completed  approximately 64
credits. From  2009  to  2017, he  worked  periodically as  a  linguist  for  the  U.S. Army and
U.S.  Navy.   He   worked   in  Iraq   (April  2009   to   October  2010),  Guantanamo   Bay,  Cuba
(January 2014  to  July 2015  and  February 2016  to  July 2017), and  Djibouti, Africa  (October
2017  to  2019).  He previously held  a  security  clearance  in 2009  and  is currently  seeking
to have  his  security clearance  reinstated.  (GE 1-2; Tr.  11-13, 15-16, 31-32, 34-37)
The SOR alleged 11 delinquent debts, including four judgments, totaling $75,885.
Applicant admitted all the allegations, except SOR ¶ 1.k ($557). These debts appear in
Applicant’s credit bureau reports (CBRs). (Answer; GE 2-8)
The debts alleged in the SOR were opened between 2015 and 2020 and became
delinquent  between  2018  and  2022.  All  but  one  of  the  alleged  debts  are  credit  cards,
personal-bank loans, or a line of credit. Applicant testified he had not made any payments
toward  the  alleged  debts,  nor  has  he  contacted  his  creditors.  However,  he  intends  to
resolve them in the future when he has more income and the ability to make payments.
At the time of the hearing, his mortgage of approximately $280,000 was in forbearance,
and his last full payment was made in April 2021.  Additionally, he testified he has new
unalleged delinquent debts, including a $2,000 credit card he opened in December 2022
that is approximately four to five months past due. He is also a month behind on his two
car leases. These debts were not alleged in the SOR, and  they are not considered as
disqualifying;  however,  they  may  be  considered  in  determining  the  applicability  of
mitigating conditions and in my whole person analysis. (GE 2 at 7-9; GE 3-7; Tr. 37-47,
52-54, 62-70, 78-81)
SOR ¶ 1.k ($557) is the only medical debt alleged in the SOR. It became delinquent
in  approximately  2021.  According  to  Applicant,  the  debt,  a  2015  surgery-related
deductible,  was  personally  forgiven  by  his  physician
in  2016.  Applicant’s  only
communications with the physician were over the phone, and he last communicated with
him in 2016. Applicant does not have documentation to support his claim the debt was
forgiven or resolved. (GE 3 at 7; Tr. 47-52)
Applicant entered a debt consolidation plan in October 2017 to consolidate his bills.
Monthly payments of $1,100 were withdrawn electronically from his bank account for eight
or nine months. The debt consolidation company retained $5,500 of the approximately
$8,800 to $9,900 he paid it. The company resolved two small accounts, not alleged in the
SOR, and Applicant resolved three additional unalleged accounts after he discontinued
payments to the company. He did not provide proof of these payments. He has made no
additional payments toward his debts since making these payments. (Answer; Tr. 53-63)
Applicant  was  unemployed  during  the  following  periods:  December  2010  to
December  2013  (medical  reasons  and  worked  part  time  for  his  brother);  July  2015  to
January 2016 (medical reasons and supported by $39,000 medical policy); July 2017 to
October  2017  (changed  employers  and  supported  himself  with  savings  and
unemployment benefits); and June 2019 to present (left by mutual agreement). (Answer;
GE 1-2, 8; Tr. 36, 50)
As noted above, Applicant has been unemployed since June 2019. He has been
unable to find positions with government contractors and civilian employers. He testified
that  after  leaving  his  last  employment  in  2019,  he  received  unemployment  benefits  of
$350 for 14 weeks. He previously disclosed he received unemployment benefits of $650
weekly  or  $2,600  monthly.  Starting  in  2020,  he  received  COVID-19  benefits  for
approximately  one  year.  His  wife  received  unemployment  benefits  of  $320  weekly  or
$1,280 monthly starting in March 2021. She started working in September 2022 earning
approximately  $1,500  net  monthly.  His  oldest  son  left  college  early,  and  he  provides
financial support to their family. Since July 2023, he has received $1,511 monthly in Social
Security  disability  due  to  an  injury  he  received  in  Africa  (he  received  Social  Security
benefits  of  $1,100  monthly  from  June  2022  to  July  2023).  One  of  his  brothers  also
provides him with financial support. Applicant owes him approximately $27,000, and he
has not made any payments to his brother. He also borrowed $1,500 from a cousin and
used part of his 2022 income tax refund of $5,000 to repay him. The unalleged personal
loans from family members are not alleged in the SOR, and they are not considered as
disqualifying;  however,  they  may  be  considered  in  determining  the  applicability  of
mitigating conditions and in my whole person analysis. (GE 8; Tr. 24-33, 69, 76)
Applicant does not follow a written budget. At the time of the hearing, he had $482
in his savings account, no money in his checking account, and no money in a retirement
savings account. In 2021, he leased a brand-new vehicle with a $465 monthly payment,
and in 2022, he leased a brand-new vehicle with a $306 monthly payment. He was aware
of  his  financial  issues  when  he  leased  both  vehicles.  In  2010,  during  a  previous
investigation,  he  had  $18,000  in  delinquent  debt,  and  he  resolved  it  through  a
consolidation firm. (Tr. 77, 79-82, 85)
In Applicant’s Answer to the SOR, he included  a personal statement and a letter
of  recommendation  regarding  the  circumstances  related  to  his  leaving  his  former
employer in June 2019 by mutual agreement. Applicant asserted and was supported by
the letter of recommendation, that he was discriminated against by his supervisor, and it
affected his employment. (Answer)
