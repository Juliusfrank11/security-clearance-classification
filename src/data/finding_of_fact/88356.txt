Applicant  is  a  30-year-old  warehouse  technician  for  a  defense  contractor,
employed since November 2016, but he has been on furlough since September 30, 2020,
pending  resolution  of  his  security  eligibility.  Applicant  refereed  high  school  basketball
games part time from November 2019 to February 2020. He also worked as a full-time
security guard from 2013 to 2016, when his five-year-old niece accessed his unsecured
firearm  and  discharged  a  round  into  his  leg.  He  missed  work  as  a  result  and  incurred
some  of  the  medical  debts  listed in the  SOR.  Applicant  graduated from  high  school  in
2009, and earned an associate’s degree in 2013. He is not married and has no children.
This is Applicant’s first application for security eligibility.
The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant owes approximately $51,709 in
12 delinquent debts. His debts include a charged-off car loan (SOR ¶ 1.a), a delinquent
education  loan (SOR  ¶ 1.b),  nine delinquent  medical  debts  (SOR  ¶¶  1.c  –  1.k),  and a
student apartment debt (SOR ¶ 1.l). Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.h, 1.k, and 1.l. The
remaining  debts  were  denied  with  the  explanations  that  the  student  loan  was  in  good
standing, the denied medical debts were removed from his credit report, or he could not
locate records for the accounts.
Applicant testified  at the hearing that he purchased  a vehicle in  2015, and  it was
voluntarily repossessed in   2016. (SOR ¶ 1.a) Applicant’s mother   assisted him with the
payments, but she was unable to  continue when she became ill and retired.  He believes
he owes about $27,000, and has not taken any action to resolve the debt.
Applicant has a student-loan debt  (SOR ¶ 1.b)  that was rehabilitated in  January
2019. He  owes approximately $44,000. He testified that he made payments under the
rehabilitation program until  February 2020. He  stopped payments on his student loans
because he  claimed that he was not obligated  to continue  paying due  to a Federal COVID-
19
