Under Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant  owed $33,996  for  22
delinquent  or  past-due   debts  (SOR  1.a  –   1.v).   In  response,  Applicant   admitted  with
explanations all of  the SOR allegations. (Answer)  As noted, above, Department Counsel
amended  the SOR by adding as SOR 1.w an allegation  that Applicant  owes an additional
$4,503.22 for  a state tax  lien entered against  him in  June 2018. Applicant  admitted SOR
1.w without explanation.  Accordingly, the total amount of  debt at issue is $38,499.22. The
SOR amendment and  Applicant’s  response to  it are included  as HX  3. In addition to the
facts established by Applicant’s admissions,  I make  the  following additional findings of
fact.
Applicant is 41 years old and was hired by his current employer in November 2019.
He  requires  a  security  clearance  as  part  of  his  assigned  duties.  He  has  worked  in
information technology (IT) positions, mostly with federal contractors, since August 2007.
In 2010, Applicant earned an associate’s degree in computer network systems, and he
holds multiple IT certifications. He has held a security clearance since 2008. (GX 1; AX
B; Tr. 33)
Applicant and his wife have been married since December 2007. They have one
child, age 13. In 2013, Applicant became the legal guardian of two nephews, now ages
20  and  17,  after  their  mother  died.  In  2020,  he  took  in  another  child  whose  parents
(Applicant’s sister’s brother-in-law and his wife) died within a year of each other. All four
children still live with Applicant and his wife. (GX 1; Tr. 29 – 31)
In Section 26 (Financial Record) of his most recent security clearance application,
Applicant  did  not  disclose  any  adverse  financial  information.  However,  credit  reports
obtained during his background investigation disclosed the debts alleged in the SOR. In
September  2018  and  March  2019,  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  government
investigator,  with  whom  he  discussed,  inter  alia,  the  debts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  At
Applicant’s  hearing, he testified that he was unaware of the debts at issue in this case
until he received the SOR in December 2019. (GX 1; Tr. 28, 61 – 63)
After  graduating  from  high  school,  Applicant  was  enrolled  at  a  local  community
college  between  July  1997  and  May  2009.  Between  September  2006  and  December
2010,  Applicant  also  studied  for  his  associate’s  degree  at  a  privately-owned  technical
school. To finance his education at both schools, he obtained several student loans. The
debts  alleged  at  SOR  1.a,  1.f,  1.q,  and  1.v  are  student  loans  that  became  delinquent
between  2011  and  2014.  The  debts  alleged  at  SOR  1.a  and  1.f  are  the  result  of
consolidations  of  some  of  his  loans  in  2016;  however,  Applicant  has  not  made  any
payments on those loans since they were consolidated. (GX 2 – 3; AX E; Tr. 28, 33, 43 –
50)
In response to the Government’s information, Applicant claimed that the student
loan  debts  in   the  SOR   are  no  longer  his  responsibility.  He   cites  a  class  action  lawsuit
brought  by  the  Bureau  of  Consumer  Financial  Protection  against  the  technical  school
where he studied  for  his associate’s degree.  He  further claimed that the suit resulted in  a
nullification   of  student  loans  obtained   through  the  school.  In  support   of  his  claim,  he
proffered  a  proposed  “Stipulated  Final  Judgment  and  Order”  filed  in  federal  court  in
September 2020. The  only creditor mentioned  in  that document is the one  cited in  SOR
1.q.  The   document  does not  constitute  a   final   order  or  other manner  of   resolution that
would  relieve  Applicant  of   any  of  the  student  loans   addressed   in   the  SOR.  Further,
Applicant testified that he also has a letter that supports his claim that he no longer is
responsible for  SOR 1.a, 1.f, 1.q, and  1.v.  Despite being allowed additional time after the
hearing, he has not produced that letter.  (Answer; AX J; Tr. 22 –  23, 25, 43 –  44)
Applicant has several chronic medical issues that require regular medications and
have resulted in multiple hospitalizations. He estimates that between 2014 and 2019, he
spent a total of three weeks out of work due to illness, and that he lost about $5,400 in
income over that period. Applicant has always had employer-provided health insurance.
The debts alleged at SOR 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.g – 1.p represent unpaid medical expenses
comprised of co-payments and other services not fully covered by his insurance plan. (Tr.
21 – 22, 28, 58 – 61)
During his direct testimony and on cross-examination, Applicant averred that he
has paid the debts at SOR 1.b – 1.e, 1.g – 1.p, 1.t, and 1.u. He also claimed that he has
been working with the creditor at SOR 1.r by making $188 payments each month. As to
SOR 1.s, Applicant averred that he is making $100 monthly payments to bring that credit
card account current. In most cases, Applicant has based his claims on the absence of
information about those debts in his most recent credit report. He also stated that he had
additional  corroborating  information  he  could  submit;  however,  despite  being  allowed
additional time after the hearing, he has not produced that information. (Answer; AX E;
Tr. 22 – 27, 50 – 54)
The debt alleged at SOR 1.w is for a state tax lien obtained against Applicant in
June 2018. In response, Applicant presented information about a past-due EZ-Pass toll
Account. His position is that when the EZ-Pass became delinquent, the state converted
it to a tax lien. He also averred that his father has paid $2,500 toward that debt and that
Applicant now owes only $1,809 after making a $170 payment in January 2021. When
asked  to  provide  information  that  supports  his  claim  that  the  state  where  he  lives
somehow  converts  EZ-Pass  debts  to  tax  liens,  Applicant  produced  only  additional
information about his EZ-Pass account. (Answer to SOR Amendment; GX 4; AX F – I; Tr.
31 – 32, 54 – 57, 72)
Aside from a two-month period of unemployment after his employer lost a contract
in January 2014, Applicant has been steadily employed (with insurance benefits) in the
IT field for the past 13 years. His current job pays him an annual salary of $128,000 and
that he brings home about $5,200 each month. The job he had between May 2016 and
November 2019 paid him a starting annual salary of $88,000. When he left to take his
current job, he was making $118,000 annually. Applicant also receives Social Security
benefits as assistance connected to the custody of his two nephews, and his wife earns
about $600 monthly as a waitress. Applicant did not provide any documentation of his
earnings. (Tr. 19 – 20, 37)
In  addition   to  his  medical  challenges,  Applicant  claimed  his  financial  problems
have   been   caused   or  exacerbated  by  his   wife’s  marital  infidelities,  gambling,  and
substance  abuse.  He   testified  that  those  behaviors  occurred  between  2016   and   2019,
and that aside from  continued online gambling expenditures each  month of less  than $100
since 2019,  her conduct has not  been  an impediment to their finances. He  did not explain,
however, how his wife’s conduct was related to the fact that most of the debts at issue in
this case became delinquent before 2016. (Tr. 28 –  29, 40 –  43, 66)
Applicant  has  never  paid  rent  or  had  a  mortgage  for  a  home  of  his  own.  Since
1996,  after  living  in  the  home  in  which  he  was  raised,  Applicant  has  lived  in  a  house
owned  and  paid  for  by  his  father.  Applicant’s  only  living  expenses  are  the  money  he
contributes for utilities and food. He estimates that he has less than $100 remaining each
month. When he responded to the SOR, Applicant stated that part of his plan to resolve
his debts relied on his ability to pay off one of his car loans by June 2020 and reallocate
the $700 monthly car payment to resolve other debts. Applicant still owes $4,000 for that
car loan because his car was repossessed in 2020 and the loan was refinanced so he
could  keep  the  car.  Applicant  also  indicated  that  he  expected  to  apply  his  income  tax
refunds, which he reports have averaged between $7,000 and $8,000, to debt payments;
however, he did not provide any information that supports his testimony in this regard.
(Answer; Tr. 21, 63 – 65)
In December 2020, at the behest of his attorney in this case, Applicant engaged in
online  financial  counseling  services.  He  credits  those  services  with  his  ability  to  better
organize his finances, the only identifiable example of which is a nascent monthly budget
he tracks on an eraser board in his house. Additionally, Applicant submitted several letters
of  recommendation  and  support  in  which  he  is  described  as  reliable,  trustworthy,
knowledgeable in his profession, and honest. Applicant also is active in his community’s
sports programs as a coach and organizer. (Answer; AX A; Tr. 31, 38 – 40)
