Under Guideline F, the SOR alleges six delinquent debts totaling $35,679. In his
Answer,  Applicant  denies  SOR  ¶  1.d,  a  $13,368  charged-off  account,  and  admits  the
remaining  debts.  The  delinquent  debts  are  reflected  in  Applicant’s  March  2019  and
January  2018  credit  bureau  reports  (CBR),  discussed  during  his  personal  subject
interview  (PSI),  and  partially  disclosed  on  his  e-QIP.  (GX  6;  GX  5;  GX  4;  GX  3.)
Applicant’s admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant,  32,  has  been  employed  as  a  federal  contractor  part  time  since
November 2017. He served honorably on active duty in the U.S. Navy from June 2009
until  June  2013,  which  included  a  six-month  combat  deployment.  He  received  his
bachelor’s degree in 2017. He has resided and shared expenses with his fiancée since
2016. He was first granted a security clearance in or about 2010. (GX 3; GX 4.)
Applicant states that  his past financial  delinquencies arose due  to a confluence of
several “life events.” After  leaving active duty,  Applicant  was unemployed from June until
October  2013   when   he  obtained   part-time  seasonal   employment.   The   part-time
employment ended in  December 2013, and  Applicant  was unemployed  until November
2017 when he began working part time for his current employer. (GX 3; GX 4.)
In  November  2011,  Applicant  secured  a  vehicle  loan  for  approximately  $15,502
and maintained timely payments. In December 2013, while between insurance policies,
Applicant totaled the vehicle. Applicant believed that he had insurance that should have
covered the vehicle between policies and attempted to get proof of insurance from his
provider, but was unsuccessful. He contacted the creditor in an effort to enter a monthly
repayment plan, but the creditor demanded payment in full. Applicant intends to pay this
debt. The $11,572 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a reflects the balance due on this account.
The debt was charged off by the creditor.
The $6,675 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.b is for a delinquent credit card that Applicant
opened  in  2011.  He  fell  behind  on  his  payments  while  unemployed  and  incurring
unanticipated costs after totaling his vehicle and moving. The account became delinquent
in July 2014 with a balance of $7,500. Applicant entered a monthly repayment plan of
$150 a month in December 2018. (GX 4; GX 6.) This debt is being resolved.
The  $2,837 debt alleged  in  SOR ¶ 1.c  was a secured account that was charged
off  in  2013. Both of  Applicant’s CBRs reflect a $0  balance due. (GX  5; GX 6.) This debt
has been resolved.
Applicant denies the $13,368 charged-off debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d. In June 2014,
Applicant signed an agreement for a non-refundable deposit to hold an apartment in a
complex that primarily housed college students. He did not sign a lease. While waiting for
an apartment to become available, he needed a place to live so he rented in a different
complex. He notified the original complex that he would not be renting from them in July
2014. In 2017, Applicant discovered that the original complex had charged him for a full
year  despite  the  fact  that  he  did  not  sign  a  lease  or  reside  in  the  complex.  Applicant
contacted  the  complex  in  July  2017  to  dispute  the  debt  but  was  unable  to  reach  a
resolution. He disputed the debt with a major credit-reporting company in October 2017.
(GX 4.) The dispute is reflected on his January 2018 CBR. (GX 5.) The debt does not
appear on his March 2019 CBR. (GX 6.) This account has been resolved.
Applicant does not recognize the $581 and the $646 medical debts alleged in SOR
¶¶ 1.e and 1.f. (GX 4.) Both debts were assigned for collection in January 2015 and closed
in April 2015. (GX 5.) The debts do not appear on Applicant’s March 2019 CBR. (GX 6.)
During his PSI, Applicant explained that he is seeking higher paying employment
opportunities and that he is actively focused on proper money management. He has no
current delinquencies and characterizes his financial status as stable, stating that he is
saving money, paying his bills on time, and trying to repair his credit.
Applicant’s  CBRs show a credit history dating back to 2008 that include paid-off
student loans, credit cards, personal loans, a line of credit, and his 2017 apartment rental
agreement.  Despite  his  2013  to  2017  period  of  unemployment  and  his  ongoing
underemployment, Applicant has not incurred any delinquent debt since 2015. He lives
within his means and does not have any open credit accounts. (GX 6.)
