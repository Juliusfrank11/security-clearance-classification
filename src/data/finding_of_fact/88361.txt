Applicant is 35 years old and single. He has a Bachelor of Science degree and has
worked for his current employer since 2020. He has worked in the defense industry since
2008 and held a security clearance the majority of that time. (Government Exhibit 1 at
Sections 12, 13A and 17; Tr. 6, 13.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations)
The Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  has  failed  to  meet  his  financial  obligations  and  is  therefore  potentially
unreliable, untrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.
Applicant admitted both SOR allegations (1.a and 1.b), with explanations.
1.a. Applicant admitted that he had not filed his Federal income tax returns in a
timely manner for tax years 2013, 2014, and 2016. (In his Answer Applicant incorrectly
stated 2017 instead of 2016. (Applicant Exhibit C; Tr. 23-24.))
1.b. Applicant admitted that he had not filed his state income tax returns in a timely
manner for tax years 2013, 2014, and 2016. (In his Answer Applicant incorrectly stated
2017 instead of 2016. (Applicant Exhibit C; Tr. 23-24.))
In Section 26 of Applicant’s e-QIP (Government Exhibit 1) Applicant admitted that
he had not filed Federal or state taxes for at least tax year 2013. He further stated in the
questionnaire,  “It  is  my  understanding  that  the  taxes  were  not  owed  based  on  normal
paycheck  withholding  and  exemptions/credits  from  previous  years.”  The  questionnaire
then asked what actions Applicant had taken. He stated, “No action has been taken as it
is assumed no amount is owed and only a filing is required. I intend to back-file for the
applicable years as soon as possible.” (See also Tr. at 29.)
Applicant  was  interviewed  by  an  investigator  from  the  Office  of  Personnel
Management (OPM) on February 14, 2019. During that interview Applicant was  asked
about his failure to file Federal or state tax returns for 2013, 2014, and 2016. The report
stated, “Subject [Applicant] filed tax extensions for each year but has not filed the required
follow-up.  Subject did not follow up on sending in the taxes due to oversight. . . . Subject
knows  he  is  responsible  for  filing  and  will  attempt  to  bring  everything  up  to  date  by
February 2019.” (Government Exhibit 2 at 2.)
Turning first to Applicant’s 2016 Federal and  state tax  returns. After the hearing
Applicant provided documentation from the IRS and his state tax agency showing that
those returns were filed in a timely fashion in 2017. (Applicant Exhibits I and P.)
With regard to his 2013 and 2014 Federal and state tax returns, Applicant admitted
that he intended to file them from 2015 on, but it became too hard “because of my job
duties, the amount of time I spend on the job, the amount of time I spend on travel.”  In
fact, Applicant’s dilatory conduct with regard to the tax returns continued even after he
received the Statement of Reasons. (Tr. 24.) (See Applicant Exhibits A, B, and C; Tr. 64-
65.)
According to Applicant, he finally filed his Federal 2013 and 2014 tax returns in
May  2020.  However,  there  is  no  confirmation  from  the  IRS  that  they  were  actually
received and Applicant did not follow up as of the date of the hearing. After the hearing
Applicant  submitted  a  written  statement  saying  that  he  had  contacted  the  IRS  on
December  9,  2020.  He  had  checked  their  website  and  these  two  tax  returns  were  not
showing as filed. A representative allegedly told Applicant it was possible that the  IRS
had received them, but due to Covid-19 the returns had not yet been entered into the IRS
data base. No further information was provided. (Applicant Exhibits D and O; Tr. 28-29,
52-53, 65-66.)
Applicant did not file his state 2013 and 2014 tax returns in May 2020, at the same
time he allegedly filed his Federal tax returns. Rather, according to Applicant, his filing of
these  returns  was  complicated  by  a  proposed  assessment  from  the  state.  After  some
questioning from Department Counsel about the current status of the returns, Applicant
revealed that he had not filed his state tax returns, but they were actually sitting in his car
to be mailed after his hearing. (Tr. 35-36, 56-58.)
The reason for his dilatoriness was described by Applicant as follows:
Well, that’s because my - - what I intended to do here wasn’t necessarily to
show that I had fully filed everything and closed everything out - - but that I
was making efforts to address them, beginning with my Federal Forms and
then also with the State Form portion that I file today and then the last step
would be any adjustments or priorities. (Tr. 57.)
After the hearing Applicant submitted documentation from the state tax authority
showing that his 2013 and 2014 returns were received on December 10, 2020. (Applicant
Exhibit P.)
Applicant’s  attention  was  also  drawn  to  several  delinquent  accounts  that  were
found on his credit report and had been outstanding for a considerable period of time.
Applicant  submitted  evidence  that  he  had  resolved  those  issues  after  the  hearing.
However,  once  again,  Applicant  was  dilatory  in  resolving  these  items.  (Government
Exhibits 3, 4, and 5; Applicant Exhibits K, L, M, N, and O; Tr. 39-45.)
Mitigation
Applicant  submitted  letters  of  recommendation  for  employment  from  former  co-
workers. He also submitted his evaluations from his former employer. These documents
show that he is a respected person in his field of endeavor. (Applicant Exhibits E, F, and
G; Tr. 30-35.)
