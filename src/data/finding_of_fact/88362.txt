Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  his  SCA  unless  otherwise
indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of
the  pleadings,  including  Applicant’s  admissions  in  his  Answer  to  most  of  the  SOR
allegations, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make the following findings of
fact.
Applicant, age 50, is divorced, and presently cohabitates with his fiancée. He did
not list any children in his SCA, but he mentioned having a 16-year-old son in his April 3,
2019 background interview (Interview). He  confirmed the accuracy of the investigator’s
report summarizing the Interview in his response to the Government’s interrogatories. He
has a high school diploma and earned a graduate certificate in 1993 from the U.S. Navy
Nuclear EM A School. He served in the Navy Reserve from 1993 to 1999, when he was
honorably discharged. He presently works for a Navy contractor as a deck electrician. He
is a first-time applicant for a security clearance. (GE 4 at 2-3, 6.)
Applicant’s   SCA  does   not  reflect   any  periods  of  unemployment,  though  he  was
self-employed operating a food truck for  nine months in  2017  before he began his current
employment. In  the  Interview, Applicant  reported that after he and  his fiancée  began the
food-truck business  they  encountered several problems. His fiancée’s father became ill,
and  he and his fiancée  had  to relocate to a  different state to care for the father  until  he
died later  that year. When  the business was in  operation, they  had  difficulty finding places
to park the truck to sell  food and  were forced to move to  a new  residence  because they
could  not  park  the   truck  where  they   were  living.  In  his  Interview,  he  blamed  his  non-
payment of  most of the debts listed in  the SOR on his problems with his business in  2017.
Ultimately, Applicant started his current employment in October 2017. His fiancée does
not work outside their home. (GE 4 at 5-7.)
SOR  Allegations
Applicant  admitted  each  of  the  allegations  in  the  SOR,  except  SOR  ¶  1.e.  The
debts listed in the SOR and the relevant evidence in the record are as follows:
SOR  ¶  1.a,  Unfiled  Federal  and  State  Income  Tax  Returns  for  2017.  Applicant
volunteered  in  the  Interview  that  he  had  not  filed  his  2017  tax  returns  due  to
procrastination. In 2017, he was self-employed for the first nine months of the year. He
intended to  file the returns  with  his 2018 returns,  but he admitted  the  allegation of  the
unfiled 2017 returns in his January 21, 2020 Answer. This financial obligation is not
resolved. (GE 2 at 1.)
SOR ¶ 1.b, Judgment Entered in the Amount of $8,542. On October 15, 2018, a credit
union obtained a judgment against Applicant on a debt arising from a car loan. He opened
this account in April 2014 and defaulted on the loan in September 2017. In the Interview,
he blamed his default on the loan and failure to pay the judgment on problems with his
food-truck business. He has made no payments on this debt. This debt is not resolved.
(GE 4 at 7; GE 5 at 1; GE 9 at 3.)
SOR ¶ 1.c, Judgment Entered in the Amount of $11,524. On May 15, 2018, a financial
company obtained a judgment against Applicant on a debt-consolidation loan that was in
default.  Applicant  was  unable  to  pay  this  debt  due  to  problems  with  his  food-truck
business.  The  creditor  garnished  his  wages,  and  as  the  date  of  the  Interview,  it  had
collected about $6,000 of the debt. The balance due at that time was about $14,000. In
his  January  21,  2020  Answer,  Applicant  wrote  that  the  amount  of  the  debt  had  been
reduced to $7,157. The balance due as of the most recent credit report in the file, dated
March 30, 2020, was $4,846. This debt is not yet resolved. (GE 4 at 5; GE 6 at 1; GE
9 at 2.)
SOR ¶ 1.d, Judgment Entered in the Amount of $1,152. On October 25, 2017, a credit
union obtained a judgment against Applicant on a credit-card account that was in default.
Applicant was unable to pay this debt due to problems with his food-truck business. This
account was opened in July 2014. Applicant defaulted on the payments in January 2017.
He has made no payments on this judgment since then. This debt is not resolved. (GE
4 at 5-6; GE 7 at 1; GE 9 at 3-4; GE 10 at 2.)
SOR ¶ 1.e, Judgment Entered in the Amount of $2,000. On July 11, 2017, an individual
obtained a judgment against Applicant and his fiancée. The record contains no additional
information  about  the  debt  except  that  Applicant  wrote  in  his  Answer  that  he  paid  this
judgment  on  January  12,  2019.  He  has  provided  no  evidence  of  the  payment.  The
Government’s evidence of this judgment is a printout of the court record, which reflects
the date and amount of judgment and that the judgment remains unsatisfied. The printout
was created on September 9, 2019. Applicant has not established that this debt has
been resolved. (Answer at 2; GE 8 at 1.)
SOR ¶  1.f,  Past-Due Debt Owed to a Credit  Union. This credit-card debt is the same
debt that was subsequently converted into a  judgment and  is the subject of  SOR ¶  1.d,
discussed above. The  record evidence reflects that Applicant  only had  one   credit-card
account with this credit union. This debt is a duplicate of the debt alleged in SOR ¶
1.d.  (GE 4 at 5-6;  GE 9 at 3; GE 10 at 2; GE 11 at 2.)
SOR ¶  1.g, Collection  Account  in the Amount of $422. Applicant defaulted on a credit
card and  the account was referred to a collection agency. In his Interview, he attributed
his  failure  to  pay  the  credit  card  to  his  problems  with   his  food-truck  business.  He   has
made no payments on this debt.  This debt is not resolved.  (GE 4 at 6; GE 9 at 2-3;  GE
10 at 2; GE 11 at 5.)
SOR  ¶   1.h,   Unpaid  Bank  Overdraft   Expense  Charged  Off   in  the  Amount  of  $390.
Applicant failed to repay an overdraft  on a bank account and  the institution charged off
the debt. The debt was first listed  on a  June 2019 credit report in  the record. It was not
listed on the Government’s original  investigative credit report  so the report  in  the record
summarizing  the Interview  makes no mention  of this debt.  In  the March 2020 credit report
in  the record,  the debt is shown  as  unpaid. This debt is not resolved.  (GE 9 at 3; GE 10
at 2.)
SOR ¶  1.i,  Unpaid Bill  for Medical Services  in the Amount of  $131. Applicant has an
unpaid medical  bill. As of  the  March 2020 credit report in  the  record, this  debt remains
unpaid.  This debt is not resolved.  (GE 4 at 6; GE 9 at 2; GE 10 at 2; GE 11 at 5.)
SOR ¶  1.j,  Unpaid Bill  for Medical Services  in the Amount of $100.  Applicant has a
second  unpaid medical  bill. As of the March 2020  credit report  in  the record,  this  debt
remains unpaid. This debt is not  resolved.  (GE 4 at 6;  GE 9 at 2; GE 10 at 2; GE 11 at
5.)
SOR ¶  1.k,  Collection Account  in the Amount of $376.  Applicant has an unpaid bill
with  an internet  or  cellphone   provider.  In  his  Interview,  Applicant   reported that  he was
unaware of  this debt and that he had an active account with the same creditor at the time
of the Interview. As of the March 2020 credit  report  in  the record,  the debt remains unpaid.
This debt is not resolved.  (GE 4 at 6; GE 9 at 2; GE 10 at 2; GE 11 at 5.)
