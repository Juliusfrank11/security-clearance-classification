Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations.  She  is  34  years  old,  single,  and
has a minor child. (Tr. at 87; GE 1)
Applicant graduated from high school in 2005. She earned a bachelor’s degree in
2011  and  a  master’s degree  in  2020.  She  worked  as  an  administrative  assistant  for  a
state  government  until  February  2011,  when  funding  for  her  position  ceased  and  she
was  unemployed  until  January  2012.  She  then  worked  for  two  previous  DOD
contractors until December 2018, when she began working for her current employer as
of  the  date  of  the  hearing,  another  DOD  contractor.  She  was  first  granted  access  to
sensitive information in 2013. (Tr. at 5-6, 38-40, 72-73, 97-99, 115; GE 1, 2; AE O)
The  SOR  alleges  seven  delinquent  consumer  debts  totaling  $29,674  (SOR  ¶¶
1.a-1.b,  1.d-1.h)  and  two  delinquent  medical  debts  totaling  $1,141  (SOR  ¶¶  1.c,  1.i).
The  debts  are  established  by  credit  reports  from  2018,  2019,  and  2020.  She  also
discussed  them  during  her  2019  background  interview.  The  SOR  also  alleges  that
Applicant  falsified  her  November  2018  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  by
deliberately failing to disclose, in response to section 26, her delinquent debts in SOR
¶¶ 1.a to 1.i. (GE 1-5; AE A)
Applicant  attributed  her  delinquent  debts  to  her  youth,  financial  illiteracy,  and
limited  income.  She  earned  between  $45,000  and  $52,000  from  2012  to  2014,  and
$65,000 to $68,000 from 2014 to 2018. She started regaining control of her finances in
2016. As of the date of the hearing, she paid SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.i
and she was  in the  process  of  resolving  SOR  ¶¶  1.b  and 1.h.  (Answer;  Tr. at  37-103,
115-122; GE 2)
SOR ¶ 1.a is for a $15,630 charged-off auto account for a car Applicant bought in
2008 and timely paid until the car was stolen in 2013. She bought another car believing
the  account  for  the  stolen  car  would  be  written  off  as  a  total  loss.  The  stolen  car  was
found  shortly  thereafter  and  she  became  delinquent  on  the  account  for  the  stolen  car
because  she  could  not  afford  to  pay  for  two  cars.  A  lien  was  placed  against  her.  She
remained in contact with the creditor and made minimal payments that she could afford.
She  received  approximately  $45,000  from  her  father’s  estate  in  September  2019,  and
she used $3,000 to settle and pay this account in October. The lien was subsequently
released. (Tr. at 41-43, 103-106, 113-115; GE 2; AE A, B, D, U)
SOR  ¶  1.b  is for  a $4,533  charged-off  furniture rental account  for  a  bedroom set
Applicant  rented  in  2014,   with  the  expectation  that  she  would  eventually  own  it.  She
made 10 to  11 payments of  approximately $128 monthly. She  returned  the furniture  in
2015  after several  pieces broke,  and  she assumed  she was no longer required to pay
the  account.  She  did  not  learn  about  the  delinquency   until   an  unrecalled  date  when  it
appeared on her credit  report. She obtained  a store  return receipt  in  January 2020 and
believed  she  no  longer  had   an  outstanding  balance.   Her  efforts  to  verify  her   zero
balance with the store  were  unsuccessful,  due  to the store’s limited hours as a result of
the  COVID-19 pandemic. She intends to continue  to contact the store to  verify that this
account is resolved; if she has an outstanding balance, she intends to pay  it. (Tr. at 43-
50, 106-109;  GE  4;  AE A, B, E, U)
SOR   ¶   1.c   is  for  a   $724   dental   bill   in   collection.   Applicant   believed  her  health
insurance  paid  for   this  bill.  She   did  not  learn  that  it  was  outstanding  until  after  she
received  the SOR.  She called the dentist’s office  and  was told that the bill  was due  to  a
submitting code error. After the dentist’s office resubmitted the bill with the  proper code,
her  insurance  paid  the  outstanding  balance.   She  disputed  this  debt  in   June  2020
because  she believed it was  paid. Her  credit report  from  August 2020 reflects that the
account has a zero  balance. (Tr. at  50-52, 110, 115; AE  A, B)
SOR   ¶   1.d   is  for   a  $544  charged-off   credit  card.   Applicant   became  delinquent
due  to her limited income.  She contacted the creditor in  2017  to try to resolve it and  the
creditor  offered  to  transfer  her  outstanding  balance  to  another  credit  card.  When  she
realized that the high interest rate on the new  credit card would require  higher monthly
payments,  she   instead   elected   to  pay  the  account   in   full.   Documentation   from  the
creditor  reflects  that  she   settled  and   paid  this  account   in   October  2019.   (Tr.  at   53-54,
111-113, 115; AE  A,  B,  F)
SOR ¶ 1.e is for a $488 debt in collection for costs Applicant incurred when she
vacated  an  apartment  rental.  Applicant  incorrectly  believed  that  her  security  deposit
would  cover  these  costs.  Documentation  from  the  creditor  reflects  that  Applicant  paid
this debt in October 2019. (Answer; Tr. at 54-56, 110-111; AE G)
SOR  ¶  1.f  is  for  a  $453  outstanding  electric  bill  from  Applicant’s  previous
apartment.  She  learned  about  it  when  she  activated  her  utility  account  with  the  same
provider  for  the  apartment  in  which  she  lived  as  of  the  date  of  the  hearing.
Documentation from the creditor reflects that she paid this debt as of May 2020. (Tr. at
56-59; AE A, B, H)
SOR  ¶  1.g  is  for  a  $7,317  charged-off  auto  account,  for  another  car  that
belonged to Applicant. The car was primarily driven by her sister and it was stolen while
parked in approximately 2018.  Applicant’s  gap  insurance notified her  that it  would pay
the outstanding balance on the account. When she subsequently learned that her gap
insurance did not pay the full outstanding balance, she unsuccessfully tried to reach an
affordable monthly payment with the creditor.  In March 2020, she settled  and  paid  this
account for $7,000  with money she received  from her  father’s estate.  (Tr. at  59-65, 111-
112; AE  B, I)
SOR  ¶  1.h  is for  a  $709 cable and internet account  in  collection.  Applicant  was
unable  to  pay  the  outstanding  balance   on  the  account   when   she  switched   providers.
She settled this account and  made the first  payment of $170 in  early August 2020; the
remaining balance of $516 was scheduled to be auto-debited from her banking account
later that month. (Tr. at  65-66; AE  J, U)
SOR  ¶  1.i  is for  a  $417 medical  account in  collection.  She settled this account for
$275 and paid it in October 2019. (Tr. at  66-8; AE  K, U)
When Applicant learned of another delinquent  cable account after  she pulled her
credit  report   in   2020,  she  set  up  a  payment  plan  of  $150  monthly  to  resolve   it.  The
creditor  suspended   the  payment  due   to   the  COVID-19  pandemic,  but  Applicant
continued to make payments of  $50  to $80  monthly. As of the date of the hearing, her
remaining  balance  was  $200,  which   she   intended  to  continue  to  resolve.  She  also
contacted a student loan  resolution program in  January 2020 to  consolidate  her federal
student loans,  scheduled to become due  since the completion of her graduate degree.
(Tr. at 68-78; AE  A,  L, P)
Applicant enrolled in  a  credit counseling program  in  August 2019, through which
she has met with  a credit counselor monthly, developed a budget, and  learned how  to
manage  her  finances.  She   earned   $75,000  annually  from  2018  to  2019,  when  she
began  working  for   her  employer  as  of  the  date  of  the  hearing.  She  received  a
performance-based raise in  October 2019 and earned $78,124 annually  as of the date
of  the  hearing.  Of   the  $45,000   she  received  from  her  father’s  estate,   she  applied
$28,000  towards  resolving  her  delinquent  debts   and   placed  the  remaining  $16,800  in
her  savings  account;   she  does   not  intend  to  use  this  money.  She  has  saved  an
additional  $3,000,  also  in   her  savings  account,   and   she  contributes  to  her   employer-
matched   retirement  savings  plan.  She  has  a   monthly  net  remainder  of  approximately
$800,  which  provides  her  with   sufficient   disposable  income  to  meet  her  financial
obligations.  (Answer; Tr. at  63-64, 70-92, 111-113, 115-125; AE  C, K,  M, N, Q, R, U)
Applicant mistakenly believed that section 26 of her SCA required her to only list
financial  delinquencies  related  to  gambling,  drug  use,  alcoholism,  and  other  illegal
activities. Though she acknowledged that she was embarrassed about the poor state of
her finances, she misread the question and believed she was only required to disclose
delinquencies  that  stemmed  from  the above-mentioned  factors.  She  did  not  seek  help
with completing her SCA. (Answer; Tr. at 92-94, 102-103, 122-123)
As of the date of the hearing, Applicant’s witness had served in the U.S. military
for 28 years, during which time he has held a security clearance. He was Applicant’s on-
site supervisor from approximately 2012 to 2014, when they both worked for a previous
DOD  contractor  and  had  access  to  sensitive  information.  He  testified  that  while
Applicant  began  as  a  temporary  employee,  he  quickly  observed  her  proficiency  and
eagerness to learn so he recommended that their employer hire her full time. He rated
her  performance favorably  during this period.  He testified that  she was  an  honest  and
trustworthy individual. He was aware of Applicant’s delinquent debts and had no doubts
that  Applicant  would  make  necessary  life  changes  and  resolve  them.  Applicant’s
supervisor  as  of  the  date  of  the  hearing  rated  Applicant  favorably  on  her  most  recent
performance  review  from  2019.  She  also  described  Applicant  as  a  trusted  and  valued
employee. Applicant’s character references, which include a friend, a former co-worker,
and a fellow volunteer, also attested to her trustworthiness and reliability. She has also
volunteered  as
for  her  daughter’s  parent-teacher
treasurer
association. (Answer; Tr. at 16-37, 39-40, 94-; GE 1; AE S, T)
