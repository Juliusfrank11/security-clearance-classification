Applicant  admitted  all   three   allegations  in   SOR.  After  a  thorough  and   careful
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  42-year-old  employee  of   a  defense  contractor.   (GX   1  at  page   5,
and   TR   at  page  16  lines  10~21.)   He   has  been  employed  with  the   defense  contractor
since  1998, and has held a security clearance for about “20 of those years.” (TR at page
16 lines 16~21.)  He  is married, and has two  children.  (TR at page 16 line 22 to page 17
line 15, and at page 20 lines  17~20.) Applicant  attributes the alleged  financial  difficulties
to  his  wife  losing  her  job  as  a  Flight  Attendant  due   to  health  reasons   (TR  at   page  17
lines  1~18),  and   his  tax   delinquencies  to  an  overwhelming  work  schedule  with  a  new
position as Lead Engineer.  (TR at  page 20 line 16 to page 22 line 5.)  He  has a monthly,
positive cash flow of over $1,500. (AppX C at page 5.)
1.a. and  1.b. Applicant has filed his Federal  and  state income tax returns,  albeit
in   an  untimely  fashion,  for   tax   years  2014  through  2017,  as  evidenced  by  tax
documents.   (GX  4  at   pages  12~15,  AppX  A,  and  AppX   C  at  pages  6~9.)   Tax   years
2014 through 2016 were filed prior to the issuance  of the SOR. Tax  year 2017 was filed
with an extension, and with his 2019 income tax return,  in April of 2020. (Id.)
1.c.  Applicant is current with his home mortgage, as evidenced by documentation
from the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. (TR at page 29 line 22 to page 30 line 4,
and AppX  C at pages 6~7.)
