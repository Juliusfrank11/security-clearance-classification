Applicant, 50, has worked for his current  employer as an information technology
expert  since  2018,   supporting   the  intelligence  community.  He   completed  a  security
clearance application  in  March 2018, in  anticipation of employment in  a federal agency.
Applicant  disclosed  derogatory  financial   information   on  the  application,  including:  his
failure  to  file   his  federal  income   tax   returns  since  2014;  two  delinquent  student  loan
accounts;   four  delinquent  credit  card  accounts;  and,  and   a  delinquent  mortgage.  The
background  investigation  confirmed  Applicant’s  financial  problems.   The   SOR  alleges
that  Applicant  failed  to   file   his  federal   income  tax   returns  from   2014  to  2018  (SOR  ¶
1.a),   that  he  lost  a  home  to  foreclosure  in   2019  (SOR  ¶  1.b),   and   that  he  owes  over
$101,000 on 14  delinquent accounts.  (SOR ¶¶  1.c –  1.s).  (GE 1,  5; Tr. 24-25,  56  100)
Applicant  has  worked  in   the  information  technology  field  since  2011.  Between
2011 and  2018, Applicant lived in  a low-cost-of-living state,  earning between $130,000
and  $160,000,  depending on the bonuses he earned during the year. In the fall of 2014,
Applicant decided to switch from an engineering role to  a sales role, hoping to increase
his  earning   potential   through  sales  commissions.  In  doing  so,  Applicant   accepted  a
$30,000 reduction in  his base  pay. Despite the  pay cut, Applicant  was able to  purchase
a  home  in   late  2014.  Although  Applicant  admits  he  was  overextended  at  times,   he
believed he could comfortably afford his  home and  two luxury vehicles. (Tr. 28-29, 93-
96)
Applicant  considered   himself  financially  stable  in   2015,  but  admitted  that  the
deaths of his father and  stepfather  at the end of 2014 left  him out of sorts,  and  he failed
to file his 2014 federal income tax returns. By the summer of 2015, Applicant returned to
his engineering positon and his higher salary.  In late 2015, Applicant decided to move to
another city  within the state  and  rented his home to  an acquaintance from his  church  for
a  one-year  lease  period.  Applicant   returned  to  his  home  city  in   November  2015   and
rented an apartment  for  an 18-month lease term.  Unbeknownst  to Applicant,  his renter
abandoned   the  property  in   September.   Applicant   did  not  learn  that  the  property  was
empty until  November 2015. He could not afford to break his recently-signed lease. The
company  Applicant  retained  to   manage  the  property  could  not  find  another  renter
because the property was in  disrepair.  Applicant retained a realtor to sell  the home, but
he  could  not  afford  the  repairs  required  to   prepare  the  home  for   sale.  As  a  result,
Applicant began to pay both the mortgage on his home and the rent on the apartment.
In addition to his other  bills, he also supported his girlfriend, who was unemployed. He
paid  both  obligations  through  May  2017,  when  he  stopped  paying  the  mortgage.
However,  he  continued  to  pay  the  homeowners’  association  fees  and  other  expenses
required  to  maintain  the  home,  which  amounted  to  approximately  $300  per  month.
Between 2016 and 2017, the accounts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.j., 1.l, and
1.n, totaling approximately $29,820 became delinquent. (Answer; GE 2, 4-5; Tr. 28-29,
32-34, 96-99, 102-113)
In  January  2018,  Applicant   moved  from   State  1  to   State  2.   In  April  2018,
Applicant  resigned  his  position   after  accepting  a  position  with  a  federal  agency.
However, the agency rescinded the offer after Applicant was unable to obtain an interim
security clearance. He  remained  unemployed until  September 2018. During this period
of unemployment, the creditor repossessed  the  vehicle alleged  in SOR ¶ 1.c, resulting
in  a $48,764 deficiency balance. The  debts alleged  in SOR ¶¶  1.e, 1.i, 1.k,  1.r, and  1.s
totaling $18,993,  also  became  delinquent.  (GE 2 -Tr. 55-56,100)
Applicant began his current position in  October 2018, earning $165,000. Once he
started  working,  Applicant  began  providing   $1,000  in   financial   support  to  his  mother
each   month.  He   also  hired  an  accountant  to  help  him  resolve  his  outstanding  federal
income  tax   returns.  Between  February  and   August  2020,  Applicant  filed  his  2014
through  2019  income   tax   returns.  After  filing  the  outstanding  returns,  Applicant  owed
over  $22,117  in   federal  taxes  for   the  2014,  2016,  2017,  and   2018  tax   years.  The   IRS
applied overpayments from tax  years 2015  ($1,736) and  2019 ($9,810) to the balance,
satisfying   the  amounts  due   for   the 2014 and 2016 tax   years.  Applicant   currently owes
over  $9,200  for  the   2017  ($1,688)  and   2018   ($7,609)  tax   years.   At  the  time  of   the
hearing, Applicant  had  not received  an installment agreement from the IRS. In absence
of an installment agreement, Applicant testified that he set up automated payment to the
IRS  on  the   16th  of   each   month.  However,  the   documentation  he   provided  only  shows
three payments in  April, June, and  July 2020,  totaling $700.  (GE 5; AE  C-H, N, P  Tr.30-
32, 5, 88, 101-102, 115-119)
To date, Applicant  has resolved  5  of the 14  debts alleged  in  the SOR: ¶¶  1.j  (1.q
is a duplicate of this account and  is resolved  in  Applicant’s favor), 1.k, 1.l,  1.n,  and  1.r,
totaling $3,904. The  bank was able  to sell  the foreclosed home alleged  in  SOR ¶ 1.b for
more than the amount owed on the loan. The remaining outstanding debt totals $93,242
(SOR ¶ 1.c –   1.i, and  1.s). Applicant  testified that he had  been in contact with each  of
his  creditors   and  had   negotiated  settlements  on  each   of  the  remaining   accounts,
reducing the total  amount owed to  $42,892, which  he plans to resolve  by March 2021.
However, Applicant only provided corroborating evidence of  two of the settlement  offers.
The  settlement  offer for   the  debt  alleged   in  SOR  ¶  1.c,   agreeing   to   accept  $17,067  of
the $48,764  owed,  expired in  November 2019. The  offer for the debt alleged  in  SOR ¶
1.i,  agreeing  to  accept  $1,225  of   the  $2,443  balance  due,  expired  in  May   2020.
(Answer; AE N, Q-R; Tr. 34-35,  39  –  46, 50, 67-84)
Applicant  believes  that  he  currently  lives  within  his  means.  He  earns  $205,000
per  year,  which  includes  commissions.  He  has  approximately  $2,400  in  disposable
income each month. He has reduced the amount of financial support he provides to his
mother because his brother has assumed primary responsibility for their mother’s care.
He   has  not  accumulated  any  new   delinquent  accounts  since  he   returned   to   work  in
October 2018. Applicant  admits that his student loan accounts have  historically been in
delinquent   status,  but  are  currently  in   forbearance.   At  the  hearing,  Applicant  took
responsibility  for  his  financial  history  and   credibly  testified  about   his  willingness  and
intent to repay his creditors.  He  hopes to resume his teaching position  supervising post-
graduate  students   in   2021.  He   plans   to   apply  the  $25,000  in  income  toward  his
delinquent debt. (GE 5;  AE N; Tr. 36, 38-39, 48-50,  55, 59-63, 84-88, 114-122)
Applicant  participates   in   service   projects  through  his   fraternity,   as  well   as  a
university  and   a  non-profit  organization   dedicated  to  providing  services  in   his
hometown.  Applicant’s  character  witnesses,  two  of  whom  are  long-time  clearance
holders,  describe  Applicant   as  a  good  person,  who  is  a  conscientious   rule  follower.
Each  witness  was  aware  of  Applicant’s  financial  problems  and   none  have  observed
Applicant  living  extravagantly  or  above  his  means.  All   recommend  him  for  access  to
classified information.  (AE K, S-U; Tr. 16-23, 123-131)
