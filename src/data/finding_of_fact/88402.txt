Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶  1.a  and  he  denied  SOR  ¶  1.b.  His  admission  is
incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 51 years old. He is divorced and has no children. (Tr. 40-41) He has
a high school diploma and vocational training. He has worked for the same employer in
the  defense  industry  for  about  20  years,  since  January  2001.  He  is  a  network
administrator.  He  works  at  his  employer’s  computer  “help  desk.”  (Tr.  39,  47,  GE  1)
Applicant has had a clearance for his whole career. (Tr. 11-12, 27, 40; GE 1) He has an
annual salary of about $85,000 or $90,000. (Tr. 63)
The  SOR  concerns  Applicant’s  history  of  marijuana  use  and  his  alleged  future
intentions.  SOR  ¶  1.a  reads,  “You  used  marijuana  with  varying  frequency  from  about
March  2013  to  about  July  2017,  while  granted  access  to  classified  information.”
Applicant offered no clarification or additional explanation when he admitted SOR ¶ 1.a.
In  denying  SOR  ¶  1.b,  regarding  his  future  intentions,  he  also  made  no  further
comment.
The basis of both SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b is set forth in Applicant’s December 2017
SCA  and  in  the  summaries  of  his  background  interviews  of  December  2017  and
January  2018,  both  of  which  he  authenticated,  with  some  corrections,  in  an  August
2019 interrogatory response. (GE 1, GE 2) The details of what Applicant reported and
said  in  these  two  documents  about  his  drug  involvement  are  addressed  at  length,
followed by his hearing testimony.
On  his  February  2017  SCA,  Applicant  answered  “Yes”  to  the  question,  “In  the
last  seven  (7)  years,  have  you  illegally  used  any  drugs  or  controlled  substances?”  He
stated,
I  have  smoked  pot  and  experimented  with  Dope  again.  I  put  down  the
dope even though it was more than 7 years ago because I was asked this
question before, when I was asked why I did not put that down I replied it
was more than 7 years ago. (GE 1 at 26)
When asked to provide the type of drug or controlled substance used, Applicant
listed:
THC  (Such  as  marijuana,  weed,  pot,  hashish,  etc.)  Also  codeine,
Morphine  and   Vicodin  when  I  was  in   a  sickle  cell   crisis.  For  medical
reasons. The  pot was about a year ago  and  I had  a  SC  [sickle  cell] crisis
last year also. The  experiment with dope was more than 7 years ago  but [I
am] being honest in case it comes up.” (GE 1 at 26)
Applicant  listed   a  month   of  first   use  as  “03/2013  (Estimated)”  and  most   recent
use as “11/2016 (Estimated).” He   then stated, “I  used   the pot on   my birthday and   at a
cookout,  other drugs when I was  sick.” (GE  1 at 26) Applicant’s birthday is in  November.
(GE 1 at 5)
Applicant  answered  “Yes”  to  the  question,  “Was  your  use  while  possessing  a
security  clearance?”  As  to  the  question,  “Do  you  intend  to  use  this  drug  or  controlled
substance in the future?,” he answered “Yes,” and explained:
I  answered  yes  because  of  my  sickle  cell  but  I  am  trying  other  drugs
prescribed  by  my  Dr.  to  try  and  not  to.  For  now  this  seems  like  the  only
thing that helps SC. [I] don’t have crises all the time, maybe once or twice
a year.” (GE 1 at 26)
Applicant  discussed  his  history  of  illegal  drug  use  during  his  first  background
interview, in December 2017. He said he first used THC when he was 17. (GE 1 at 26;
Tr. 45) He said he believed he started using it again in March 2013. Then he said words
to the effect of:
Within  the  last  7  years,  [Applicant]  has  used  4-6  times.  [Applicant]  does
not purchase THC and only uses when it is available and offered to him.
[Applicant]  last  used  in  7/17  with  his  cousin,  while  possessing  a  security
[Applicant]  has  used  with  ex-girlfriends,  and  friends  at
clearance.
cookouts,  fishing  trips,  and  people’s  houses.  .  .  .  [Applicant]  uses  THC
medically  for  his  sickle  cell  anemia.  Outside  of  this,  [Applicant]  generally
takes 1-2 hits of the THC socially and obtains it from other people, mainly
his cousin. . . . (GE 2 at 10)
Applicant also stated words to the effect of, “[w]ith regard to future intentions, [he]
does not intend to seek out THC but if he it [sic] is offered to him, he does not plan to
turn  it  down.”  (GE  2  at  10)  Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  had  used  THC  with  a
clearance.  Applicant  also  acknowledged  in  his  interview  that  he  used  heroin  about  20
years ago. He relapsed about 15 years ago (in about 2005) and went to treatment. (GE
2 at 11)
In his second interview, in January 2018, Applicant clarified the details of his prior
drug use. He said he never used THC medically, only socially. He also clarified that his
use  of  codeine,  morphine,  and  Vicodin  was  not  illegal,  as  he  was  given  those  drugs
intravenously in hospitals. (GE 2 at 16; Tr. 41)
With respect to his use of THC, Applicant clarified that he put March 2013 as his
start date on his SCA because “prior to 3/13, his use was much less frequent.” GE 2 at
16  (emphasis  added)  Since  March  2013,  Applicant  “has  used  THC  approximately  4-6
times. [Applicant] most recently used THC in 7/17.” (GE 2 at 16) Applicant stated in his
interview that he “is aware that the use of THC is illegal and that usage could jeopardize
his clearance. [Applicant] does not use THC regularly and has no intentions [of] seeking
out  the  drug  to  use  it.”  (GE  2  at  16)  Applicant  also  addressed  his  prior  use  of  heroin,
most recently in 2005. (GE 2 at 16)
Applicant was given the opportunity to review, edit, and correct the OPM agent’s
summaries of his two interviews in an interrogatory response that he returned to DOHA
in  August  2019.  (GE  2)  In  reviewing  the  interview  summaries,  Applicant  corrected  the
status  of  certain  financial  matters,  his  father’s  citizenship,  and  the  name  or  location  of
his high school. Applicant did not make any corrections to the portions of the interview
summaries concerning his THC use. (GE 2 at 2-3; Tr. 55)
In a separate section, the DOHA interrogatory also asked about Applicant’s drug
use.  To  a  question  asking  “Have  you  engaged  in  any  additional  drug  use  since  July
2017?,”  he  answered  “No”  and  wrote,  “I  don’t  recall.”  To  a  question  asking  “Have  you
EVER  used  ANY  illegal  drug  in  addition  to  marijuana?,”  (emphasis  in  original)  he
answered,  “Yes”  and  reported  his  prior  heroin  use,  noting  that  he  had  previously
indicated the dates to the best of his knowledge. (GE 2 at 4)
Applicant  began  his  hearing  testimony  by  acknowledging  that  he  had  made  a
mistake. He asserted that he is an honest person. He has worked for his employer for
21 years and does not get into trouble. (Tr. 25-26, 31)
Applicant  denied  using  any  marijuana  between  2006  and  2013.  (Tr.  46)  He
repeatedly  asserted  during  his  testimony  that  during  the  timeframe  in  question  (March
2013 to July 2017, as alleged), he had used marijuana twice. Once was on a fishing trip,
in 2013, and once was at a cousin’s wedding in another state, in 2016 or 2017. (Tr. 27-
29,  38,  49-51)  Both  times  he  was  offered  marijuana  by  someone  else.  (Tr.   29-30)  He
denied using marijuana more frequently, such as on weekends or “every day.” (Tr. 28,
30)  Under questioning, he specifically denied using marijuana four to six  times between
2013 and 2017. “I remember two,” he said several times. (Tr. 42, 43)
When  confronted  at  his  hearing  about  what  he  reported  on  his  SCA  about  his
prior drug use (“I used the pot on my birthday and at a cookout. . . ”), Applicant testified,
“I  don’t  remember.”  (Tr.  52)  When  pressed  further  about  whether  he  might  have  used
marijuana  at  least  four  times  (the  birthday,  the  cookout,  the  fishing  trip  and  the
wedding), Applicant acknowledged, “I think that that’s accurate.” (Tr. 53)
Applicant  testified  that  “I can’t hardly  remember  what  happened,  you know,  last
year, last month.” (Tr. 53)  He asserted several times more that he had a poor memory
for dates and other specifics. (Tr. 55, 56, 57)
With  respect  to  the  timing  of  his  most  recent  use,  Applicant  denied  using
marijuana  or  THC  since  filling  out  his  SCA  in  February  2017.  (Tr.  57)  He  said  his
interview  statements  that  he  used  marijuana  as  recently  as  July  2017  were  not
accurate.  (Tr.  57)  He  later  said,  “And,  like  I  said,  it  could  have  been  before  that  .  .  .
.”)(Tr. 67)
Applicant denied any prior use of marijuana for  medicinal  purposes. (Tr. 36,  48-
49) He  denied any intention to use marijuana in  the future (Tr. 33-34, 60)  He  is aware
that  he  could  get  a  doctor  to   prescribe  medical  marijuana  to  treat  the  pain  from   his
sickle  cell  anemia,  but  “because  of  my  job,   because  of  my  clearance,  I  can’t  do  that.”
(Tr.  33-34,   35-36)  Applicant   is  subject  to  drug  testing  at  work,   though   he  said   he  has
never  been  tested.  (Tr.  36-37,  63)  He   has  never  had   counseling  concerning   his
marijuana use. (Tr. 46)
Applicant said he is no longer in regular contact with his cousin who gave him the
marijuana.  Applicant  testified  that  he  no  longer  socializes  with  people  who  use
marijuana. He does not really socialize with anyone. Some of this is attributable to his
personal habits; he said he is a “workaholic” and has no real hobbies. He acknowledged
that some of this is also due to the ongoing pandemic, which  limits everyone’s interest
and ability to socialize with others. (Tr. 43-44, 47, 68)
Applicant’s  post-hearing  materials  included  a  letter  in  which  he  expressed
“sincere  remorse  for  my  irresponsible  actions.”  He  offered  “no  excuse”  and  accepted
“full  responsibility.”  He  further  stated,  “I  know  for  a  fact  I  will  never  take  illegal
substances, for I don’t associate with those people who provided it anymore.” (AE A)
Applicant  also  provided
from  professional
references. All of the references praise Applicant’s technical and  professional  skills, as
well as his responsiveness, positive attitude, and value as a “team player.” (AE B)
