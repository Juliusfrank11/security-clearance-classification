Applicant is a 73-year-old call center operator for a defense contractor who seeks
a security clearance. Applicant denied generally each of the allegations in the SOR with
explanations covering the financial allegations that included admissions. Findings of fact
follow.
Background
Applicant married in November 1968 and divorced in December 1982. (GE 1) He
has one adult child from this marriage. He remarried in January 1983 and was widowed
in  November  2013.  He  has  one  adult  child  from  this  marriage.  Applicant  earned
community college education credits between September 1971 and June 1973, but did
not receive a degree or diploma. (GE 1) He enlisted in the U.S. Army in October 1966
and served two years of active duty. Applicant earned a bronze star and purple heart in
recognition of his distinguished contributions to his military service. (AE A)
Since August 2016, Applicant has been employed by his current employer.  (GE
1)  He   reported  periods  of  unemployment  between  August  2015  and   March  2016,
between July 2013 and September  2013, and  between February 2011 and  March 2011.
In March 2012, Applicant  was terminated from his  then  employer as a switch operator
on an Army Base. Cited cause for  his termination was  his being caught taking pictures
of a dial central office with a personal camera  after being granted a security clearance  in
June 2011. (GEs 1 and 6)
Applicant’s finances
three
Between  November  2008  and  May  2019,  Applicant  accumulated
delinquent  student  loan  debts  he  guaranteed  as  a  parent  for  his  daughter’s  college
education.  These  loans  covered  by  SOR  ¶¶1.a-1.b  and  1.d  involve  three  separate
student  loan  accounts,  each  guaranteed  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  Education  (DoE):
one  for  $42,802;  another  for  $35,313;  and  a  third  for  $39,108.  (GEs  2-5)  Based  on
available  credit  reports,  the  student  loan  covered  by  SOR  ¶  1.d  was  opened  jointly;
while the loans covered by SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.b were opened individually by Applicant. (GE
4)
For  two  years  (2012-2013)  after  the  loans  became  due,  Applicant’s  wife  made
voluntary  payments  on the  loans  on behalf  of  their  working daughter.  (Tr.  124)  During
some  of  this  time  (for  short  periods  in  2011  and  again  in  2013),  Applicant  reported
periods of unemployment, which may explain some of the reasons for his wife’s paying
on their daughter’s student loans before her passing.  Still unclear is why he could not
help  her  and  his  daughter  with  payments  on  the  loans  that  he  was  individually
responsible for while he was gainfully employed.
Following  his  wife’s  passing  in  November  2013,  Applicant  did  not  assume  any
responsibility  for  making  voluntary  payments  on  his  daughter’s  student  loans,  and  in
January  2014,  the  accounts  were  reported  to  be  delinquent.  (GEs  2-5;  Tr.  122-123)
Asked  whether  his  daughter  ever  made  any  payments  once  she  began  working,
Applicant could not say. (Tr. 124) Acknowledging that each of the three loans went into
default after 2013, he could not confirm with any certainty whether any of the loans were
ever placed in forbearance before or after the defaults. (Tr. 121-123) Credit reports do
not reflect any prior forbearances granted to Applicant on any or all of the three student
loans covered in the SOR. (GEs 3-5)
In  his  hearing  testimony,  Applicant  expressed   certainty  that  his  three  parent-
guaranteed   student  loans  were  consolidated  into  one   loan.  (Tr.  122)  He   provided  no
documentation of   consolidation  of   any or  all of  the  three loans,  however,  and only  the
two loans covered by  SOR ¶¶1.a  and 1.b  are treated by the DoE  and the Department
of the Treasury (DoT)  as consolidated into one  account  for  collection purposes.  (GEs A-
N and P)
Without  corroborated  evidence  of  consolidation  of  the  student  loan  covered  by
SOR ¶1.d with the loans covered by SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b, the SOR 1.d DoE-guaranteed
student  loan  must  be  considered  a  separate  delinquent  loan  account  that  was
apparently  not  included  in  any  DoT  garnishment  initiatives  covering  the  SOR  1.a-1.b
loans. (GEs 3-5 and AEs Q-R; Tr. 121-123) And, from the evidence produced, none of
the  three  delinquent  student  loans  covered  by  the  SOR  have  been  voluntarily
addressed by Applicant or his daughter since his deceased wife’s passing in November
2013.
Beginning  in  January  2016,  and  ending  in  February  2020,  the  DoT  placed  the
since  consolidated  two  parent-guaranteed  loans  (totaling  $78,115)  in  collection  status
and  began  intercepting  Applicant’s  SS  benefits  and  involuntarily  applied  over  $300  a
month of Applicant’s earmarked SS benefits to his delinquent student loan debts (AEs
B-N  and  P-R;  Tr.  54)  The  DoT’s  intercepted  dollar  amounts  from  Applicant’s  monthly
$2,200 SS benefits ranged from $300 to $338 a month and were all applied to fees and
interest  only.  (AEs  B-L  and  P-R;  Tr.  53-54)  Altogether,  DoT  intercepted  monthly
amounts  in  excess of $9,000  from Applicant’s SS   benefits between  January  2016 and
February 2020. (AEs B-L  and P-R)
After  February  2020,  the  DoT  ceased  intercepting  portions  of  Applicant’s  SS
benefits, likely attributable to the Covid-19 pandemic. (Tr. 28) Absent any documented
voluntary payments on the student loan debts from Applicant (none reported), the DoT
can be expected to resume its intercepting of Applicant’s SS benefits once the Covid-19
pandemic  fades  or  Applicant’s  consolidated  student  loans  are  otherwise  favorably
resolved.
Because the DoT’s intercepted funds from Applicant’s SS  benefits were applied
exclusively  to  interest  and  fees  owing  on  the  student  loan  debts,  Applicant  was  not
credited with any principal reductions from the SS benefits intercepted by the DoT. (AEs
N  and  P)  Based  on  updated  information  (AEs  P-R),  the  principal  balance  of  $78,115
remains unchanged. (GEs 3-5 and AEs P-R)
Additional  delinquent  debts  attributable  to  Applicant  in  the  SOR  are  two  small
delinquent medical debts totaling $633. (GEs 2-5) These debts are listed in Applicant’s
credit reports without any information by which to identify the creditors by name. Asked
about these debts, Applicant could not identify them as debts belonging to him. (GE 2;
Tr. 40-41) The listed medical debts are small and cannot be further corroborated.
Currently,  Applicant  has  an  annual  salary  of  $40,000.  (Tr.  52)  He  has  earned
annual social security  benefits  of $25,000 and two pensions  from prior  employers  that
pay him $441 and $350 a month, respectively, for a combined annual return of $9,480.
(Tr.  93-94)  He  maintains  an  average  monthly  checking  balance  of  $1,600  and  an
average monthly savings balance in the $600 range. (Tr. 94). His monthly debt liabilities
include a $279,000 mortgage on a home valued at $420,000. (Tr. 95)
Based  on  Applicant’s  monthly  income  and  identified  debts,  his  current  financial
condition  should  enable  him  to  make  some  voluntary  payments  on  his  daughter’s
delinquent  student  loans  for  which  he  bears  repayment  responsibility.  Since  2013,
though,  he  has  made  no  voluntary  payments  on  the  loans  that  are  in  any  way
documented.
Applicant’s 2012 employment separation
According  to  Joint  Personnel  Adjudicative  System  (JPAS)  incident  reports  from
the Army Base in which he was assigned in March 2012, Applicant was discovered by
base police taking pictures with his personal camera phone of a base-dial central office
directly  outside  of  the  Base  communications  office  at  the  Army  Base  where  he  was
assigned.  (GE  6)  He  acknowledged  his  awareness  that  having  any  camera  on  Base
property is strictly forbidden. (Tr. 101, 130)
It  is  unclear  from  JPAS  reports  of  the  incident  as  to  why  Applicant  took  such  a
picture  of  a  major  portion  of  the  Base’s  dial-central  office.  Applicant  admitted  only  to
taking  a  picture  of  a  tree  with  his  personal  camera  for  curiosity  reasons  and  denied
taking a picture of  the dial  central  office  or  any communications center on  the Base as
charged.  (Tr.  101-102, 116-118) In his July 2017 e-QIP, he attributed his ensuing 2012
employment  termination  to  a  report  of   the  manager  of  the  contracting  customer   of  the
Base, based on purported accounts from two unidentified Base security officers and  his
own supervisor  (but not directly privy to the incident)  on site at the time of the reported
incident,   to   the  contracting customer   of   the  Base being   uncomfortable  with  Applicant’s
reporting the matter  to  his supervisor.  (GE 1; Tr.  105-109,  114-119, and  126-128, 131-
132)   Based  on  Applicant’s  understanding  of  the  sequence  of  events,  the  manager  of
the Base customer  told him he was fired. (Tr. 107) Applicant’s direct supervisor, in  turn,
concurred with the customer  manager’s directives and formally fired Applicant.  (Tr. 108-
109, 129-130) Applicant later  filed a lawsuit against the  Base customer  which reportedly
did not produce any compensation award for Applicant. (Tr. 109-110)
Two  weeks  after  the  reported  Base  camera  incident,  Applicant  was  fired  for
cause by his own supervisor. (GE 1; Tr. 107-109) It is Applicant’s stated belief that his
ensuing  firing  was  prompted  by  the  contracting  customer’s  perceived  retaliation  to
Applicant’s  reporting his observations of the customer’s  heated encounter with his wife
(armed with a gun in his possession), to his supervisor. (Tr. 107-109) Corroboration of
Applicant’s claimed observations is lacking in the record.
With conflicting versions of what Applicant was  targeting with his camera in the
March 2012 incident, little evidence in place to corroborate either version of the camera
incident, and the lengthy time lapse (over eight years) in which to locate witnesses with
clear  recollections  of  the  camera  incident,  inferences  of  what  Applicant  was  targeting
with  his  personal  camera  in  the  reported  March  2012  Base  incident  cannot  be
reasonably and reliably drawn without considerable reaching and speculation. All that is
clear  and  accepted  is  that  Applicant  took  a  picture  with  his  personal  camera  of  some
object  on  the  Base  in  March  2012  that  he  knew  at  the  time  was  forbidden  by  Base
regulations and guidelines, was escorted off the Base, and was later  terminated by his
direct supervisor.
Since his March 2012 Base camera incident, Applicant has not had any reported
adverse  incidents  involving  security  violations.  His  employment  record  with  his  current
employer has no known adverse marks or blemishes.
