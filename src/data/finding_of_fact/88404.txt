The  amended  SOR  alleges  under  Guideline  F  that  Applicant  owes  $70,875  in
delinquent Federal income taxes (SOR ¶ 1.a) and approximately $25,000 in delinquent
state  income  taxes  (SOR  ¶  1.b).  Under  Guideline  E,  Applicant  is  alleged  to  have
deliberately falsified an August 2017 Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing
(security clearance application or SCA) by denying an inquiry into whether she failed to file
or pay Federal, state, or other taxes when required within the last seven years (SOR ¶ 2.a).
Applicant admits the tax delinquencies but asserts that her husband handled their returns,
and she had “no idea, until this process, that [they] had a problem.” She stated in response
to the SOR that her husband  told her “the tax  debt is due  [to] his business.” Applicant
denies that she intentionally falsified her SCA, as she “answered what [she] knew to be
true”  at  that  time.  After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant is  a 71-year-old  secretary  with  a  high  school  education.  (GE  1;  Tr.  30.)  She
has worked for  a succession  of defense  contractors  in  support  of the  U.S. Navy  since  1983,
staying on in  her job as the contract  changed hands every five  years.   She  seeks  to  retain  a
secret clearance, which  she has held since 1983. (Tr. 58.) Her clearance  was  last renewed
in  July 2007. When the contract  changed in  October 2007,  the Navy attested to Applicant
being “both an exemplary employee and  a wonderful  person.” Her contributions reportedly
went beyond those required in  the current or previous contract. The  letter was signed  by
the department’s director of contracts and  by 47 of her co-workers. (AE A.) Applicant has
worked for  her current employer since October 2016, when the company acquired the
contract   on  the  Navy  base.  (GE 1;  Tr.   49-51.)   She testified that  all of  her  work,   which
involves data entry, is unclassified. (Tr. 50-51.)
Applicant and  her spouse  have  been married since July 1968. They purchased  a
home together in  October 1992, and  have  a son age  49 and  a daughter age  47. (GE 1.)
Applicant  and  her spouse  have  never legally separated, despite a “rocky”  relationship  over
the last 20 years. “A good couple [of] times a year,”  she would move in  with her daughter
for  weeks or even a couple of months and  then return to her husband. She and  her spouse
kept separate bedrooms when they were in  the same household. (Tr. 25, 30-32.) Applicant
has not lived with her spouse since June 2019. (Tr. 32.)
Applicant and  her spouse  have  always maintained  separate  finances, and  they  paid
their own bills. (GE 4; Tr.  31.) He  took care of the house. (Tr. 31.) They have  never had  a
joint bank account.  (Tr. 26.) Her spouse  retired from a job on the base  at age  55. (Tr. 49.)
He   is  now   age   71.  (GE  1.)   He   has  a  dog-breeding  business  in   which   Applicant  is  not
involved, and  she is not aware of the details of his finances, including his debts or his
expenses. (GE 4; Tr. 63-64.)
Applicant’s spouse  filed their income tax  returns as married  filing jointly. He  filed
them electronically in  recent years and  did not inform Applicant that they had  any issues
with their taxes. (GEs 3-4; Tr.  33.)  For the earlier years when they filed paper returns, her
spouse   told  her  to  “sign  here,”   and   she  did  not  review   the  returns  before  they  were
submitted. Applicant assumed her spouse  was doing the right thing and  that they were “all
set”  with respect to the taxes. She  never asked to see any documents regarding  the taxes.
He kept any refunds they received. (Tr. 39-40.)
Applicant  and  her spouse  were  issued  refunds  of $9,344  in  Federal  income  taxes  for
tax  year 2013  and  $10,919 for  tax  year 2014. In April 2016, the IRS examined  their returns
for  both years. The  IRS assessed  additional  taxes of $29,308 for  2013 and  $26,919 for
2014; tax  penalties of $5,861 for  2013 and  $5,383 for  2014; and  interest of $2,175  for 2013
and  $980 for  2014. Their refund for  tax  year 2015 was applied to reduce their tax  debt for
2013 by $7,615 in  April 2016.  In September 2016, the IRS issued a notice of intent to levy
for  tax  year 2013, which  was refused or unclaimed. In November 2016, the IRS issued a
notice of intent to levy for  tax  year 2014,  which  was signed  for  by someone other than
Applicant,  likely Applicant’s  spouse. On  April  15, 2017, the  IRS  intercepted  their income  tax
refund of $7,335 for  tax  year 2016 and  applied it to their tax  liability for  2013. On May 1,
2017, the IRS issued a first  levy for  tax  year 2013. The  levy was likely on social security
benefits of Applicant’s spouse, given the IRS records show  a final  notice on November 28,
2016, “before levy on social security benefits.”  (GE 3.)
On August 17, 2017, Applicant completed an SCA to update her security clearance
eligibility. She responded negatively to all of the financial  record inquiries on the SCA,
including the following: “In the past seven (7) years  have  you failed to file  or pay Federal,
state, or other taxes when required by law or ordinance?” (GE 1.)
As of November 2017, Applicant and  her spouse’s joint mortgage on their marital
home was $21,232 past due  on a balance  of $281,759. Applicant had  no other adverse
credit accounts on her credit report. (GE 7.)  On August 7, 2018, Applicant was interviewed
by an authorized  investigator for  the Office of Personnel  Management (OPM).  Applicant
reported that she and  her spouse  separated in  June 2018, and  she moved in  temporarily
with  their  daughter.  When  questioned  about  her  finances,  she  did  not  dispute  the
delinquent  mortgage,  but  she  was  unaware  of  it  because  her  spouse   handled  the
mortgage. Applicant described her finances as good. (GE 2.)
The  mortgage on the marital home was listed as $26,313 past due  as of March
2019. (GE 6.)  On April 23, 2019, their lender foreclosed on the mortgage. (GE 4.)  On May
22, 2019, Applicant responded  to  financial  interrogatories  from  the  DOD  CAF.  She  provided
documentation  showing  that  she  and   her  spouse   had   a  zero  principal   balance   on  the
mortgage loan because of the foreclosure. In response to an inquiry into whether there
were any additional  delinquent accounts,  Applicant answered affirmatively and  listed an
unpaid Federal tax  delinquency of $68,785. She disclosed that no payment arrangements
had been made, and she stated in part:
My husband  always took care of filing our taxes. I knew  there was a problem
a few years back, but it was about his business . . . . My name is not on the
business at all. Through  this process, I found out how much we owe. It is a
small  business that he runs at home. He  says he didn’t do anything wrong,
but I guess interest is being added. I have  been told that there are tax  relief
programs, and I am going to look into them. (GE 4.)
Applicant clarified at her hearing that the “problem”  had   to do with her spouse’s
business.  Applicant  testified  that  she  overheard  him  discussing  an  issue   about  his
business. She denied knowing  about any  tax  problem. (Tr.  34.)  Applicant learned  about the
tax   debt  in   approximately  May  2019,  when  she  contacted  the  IRS  so  that  she  could
respond to DOD CAF  interrogatories. (Tr. 34-35, 61.)  She was told by the IRS that she
could  file   as  an  innocent   spouse.  She  had   not  done  so  because  she  “just  didn’t  want
trouble.” (Tr. 61.)
On January 21, 2020, in response to interrogatories, Applicant provided DOHA with
IRS account transcripts for tax years 2013 through 2018.  The IRS had taken her and her
spouse’s income tax refunds of $5,030 for 2017 and $1,130 for 2018 and applied them to
their  outstanding  tax  liability  for  2013.  Their  Federal  income  tax  delinquency  totaled
$70,875 ($24,534 for 2013 and $46,341 for 2014), and they were not in a payment plan to
address the debt. They had no outstanding Federal tax liability for tax years 2015 through
2018.  In  response  to  an  inquiry  into  whether  she  owed  any  outstanding  state  taxes,
Applicant responded that, to her knowledge, she did not owe state taxes. She requested
tax  transcripts  from  the  state  but  had  not  received  a  response.  Applicant  provided the
following  additional  information  for  consideration  in  determining  her  security  clearance
eligibility:
I have been working here, at the same place for 36 years. I have never been
in trouble, or have done anything wrong. I am 70 years old and have never
done the taxes. They were always done by my husband. I need this job to
pay my bills. (GE 3.)
In early to mid February 2020, Applicant received  a notice at her current address
that  the  state  intended  to  garnish  her  wages  to  collect  her  and   her  spouse’s  joint  tax
delinquency of $25,000. She does not know  for  which  year or years the taxes are owed.
(Tr. 40-41.)  Information from the state concerning the levy (AE B) does not reflect the tax
year(s)  in  question.  Applicant asserts that she was “in shock” when she learned about the
tax  debt because she had  asked her spouse  if they owed state income taxes, and  he told
her no. She denies ever seeing any notices, as her husband  got the mail and  “left [her]  in
the dark.”  (Answer; Tr.  38.)  He  apparently has had  a girlfriend  since 2000 and  made sure
that Applicant “did not see a lot of things,” including the telephone  bills. (Tr. 38.)  The  same
day  Applicant  received   the  notice   that  the  state  intended  to  attach  her  wages,  she
contacted the state’s tax  division, which agreed to  lower the garnishment amount to $150
per pay period. That amount is less than the maximum allowable levy. (Answer;  AE  B; Tr.
41-43.)  She has been repaying the state  income  taxes  from  her pay  since  then. (Tr.  25-26.)
Her spouse  is not paying anything towards their state or Federal  tax  delinquencies. (Tr.  25,
41.)  Applicant testified that she “keep[s]  begging him to just try and  do something with the
federal [taxes],  and  he hasn’t.”  (Tr. 25.) They are not currently living together,  and  she has
not talked to him recently, but when she brought it to his attention in  the past,  he  told  her he
would take care of it. (Tr. 26-27.)
Applicant  filed her  own income  tax   returns for   2019. She owed $577 in  Federal
income taxes, which  she paid when she submitted her return. Her state income tax  refund
of approximately $477 was taken by the state. (Tr. 44-45.) Applicant has not contacted the
IRS  about  establishing  an  installment  agreement  to  repay  the  Federal  income  tax
delinquency of approximately $70,875. She asked the IRS to remove her name from the
debt but was denied. She wanted her spouse to take care of the debt because it was not
her  fault,  and   she  does  not  have   much  money.  (Tr.  45-46,  54.)   At  her  hearing,  she
indicated that she would contact the IRS. (Tr. 54.)  Despite the record being held open  after
her hearing, she presented no evidence of having done so.
Applicant earns about $50,000 a year. (Tr. 48.)  She testified that she has about
$300 in  discretionary income every month after she pays her recurring expenses.  (Tr. 53.)
She has about $2,000 in  her checking account as of November 2020 because she was
paid for  her unused leave time.  (Tr. 63.) As of January 2020, Applicant owed $28,914 in
revolving  credit  on  six   credit-card  accounts.   She  was  making  payments  on  terms
acceptable to the creditors.  The  only negative  credit entry on her credit report  was the
mortgage loan, which had a zero balance after foreclosure. (GE 5.)
