Applicant is a 46-year-old avionics technician for a defense contractor, employed
since  June  2018.  He  graduated  from  high  school  in  1991,  and  earned  an  associate’s
degree  in  1998.  He  was  married  in  2004  and  divorced  in  2015.  Applicant  has  eight
children between the ages of 14 and 27, but none live with him. This is Applicant’s first
application for security eligibility.
The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant failed to file Federal income tax
returns as required, for tax years 2010, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015. (SOR ¶ 1.a) It also
alleges Applicant failed to file Federal tax returns in a timely fashion for tax years 2016
and 2017. (SOR ¶ 1.b) Also, the SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted to State “A” for
delinquent taxes from 2002, 2003, 2009, and 2011 in the amount of $25,332. (SOR ¶ 1.c)
Finally, the SOR alleges Under Guideline E that Applicant falsified his June 7, 2018 SCA
by deliberately failing to disclose that he failed to file or pay Federal or state taxes, as
listed as SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.c. (SOR ¶ 2.a) Applicant admitted all but the first SOR
allegation  with  explanations.  He  noted  in  his  Answer  to  SOR  ¶  1.a,  that  his  Federal
income taxes have been filed, and he is currently making payments. As to SOR ¶ 1.b, he
stated that his federal taxes were not filed in a timely fashion, but have since been filed.
In response to SOR ¶ 1.c, he stated that his “state tax is in process as of the date of this
SOR.” As to the SCA falsification allegation, Applicant answered that it was an oversight
on his behalf, and that he revealed his mistake to his investigator during the interview.
Applicant’s Federal tax issues date back to at least 2002. He testified that he was
previously  on  a  Federal  tax  repayment  plan,  but  did  not  know  the  dates.  His  IRS  tax
transcripts show a refund due in 2008 was credited toward taxes owed in 2003 and 2005.
(GE 3)  A tax refund due in 2009 was credited for taxes owed in 2002. Applicant testified
that negligence on his part resulted in this situation. He is making installment payments
for his Federal income tax debts, and he has an installment plan to pay his state tax debt.
As to the SOR tax filing allegations, he admitted that he did not file tax returns as
alleged, but testified that he filed 2008 to 2016 tax returns in 2018, and that the 2017 and
2018  returns  were  filed  on  time.  His  2010  tax  return  has  yet  to  be  filed.  Applicant’s
testimony  as  to  filing  dates  was  contradicted  by  the  tax  returns  submitted  after  the
hearing. Also, Applicant testified that he filed his 2019 tax return, but did not pay the tax
owed  because  he  did  not  know  whether  he  would  have  a  job  after  the  November
elections,  despite  having  about  $25,000  in  savings.  Applicant  testified  that  he  started
using an accountant in 2018 or 2019, to assist him with his tax return submissions.
Applicant  testified  that  he  agreed  to  a  Federal  installment  repayment  plan  in
October  or  November  2018.  However,  in  his  post-hearing  submission,  he  provided  an
IRS  letter  showing  his  agreement  to  a  Federal  installment  agreement  beginning  in
October 2019. (AE F) Applicant’s IRS installment agreement statement dated September
23, 2020, shows that he owes Federal taxes for 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2018. (AE A) He
testified that he also owes about $4,000 for unpaid 2019 taxes.  Applicant’s  agreement
with the IRS was to pay $250 per month. He provided evidence that he made inconsistent
Federal tax payments under the plan in November 2019 (three payments totaling $500);
January – March 2020; August 2020; September 2020 (two payments totaling $500); and
October  2020.  (AE  E)  He  testified  that  from  June  to  November,  he  only  made  two
payments  because  his  work  hours  were  reduced  from  February  to  June  2020  due  to
rolling furloughs. However, he lost only two weeks of pay during that period, totaling about
$2,400.
Applicant’s  state  tax  delinquencies date from 2002 through  2009,  and  2011. He
made  payments  toward  state  taxes  owed  in  2004,  2011,  and  2019.  (GE  3)  Applicant
testified that  his  state  “A”  tax returns  were  filed in 2018,  and that he has a balance of
approximately $25,000. No documentary evidence was submitted showing when his state
tax returns were filed. Applicant did not volunteer his tax delinquency with State “A” during
his personal subject interview. In fact, made a point of noting to the investigator, that his
tax delinquencies involved “just Federal taxes as [state “B”] does not have state taxes.”
(GE 2)
As of July 21, 2020, Applicant  owed the state $6,967 in  tax, $2,552.51 in  penalties,
$15,489.18  in  interest, with a balance  of $25,007.69. (AE B) He  made a  payment  under
a state  installment plan in  June 2020, and  another payment in  September 2020. He  noted
that  he   has  not  made  regular  monthly  payments  under  the  plan.   After  the  hearing,
Applicant secured a new  payment plan dated  December 1, 2020, requiring  payments of
$200 per month for  12 months, starting on December 30, 2020. This payment plan will
pay  $1,103.33  toward  his  current  total  balance  due,  but  does  not  resolve  the  total   tax
debt. (AE F) He noted in his testimony that he missed state tax payments so that he can
make federal tax payments.
In his post-hearing submission, Applicant provided Federal  tax  returns showing his
2019 return was filed on December 1,  2020, and he owes $4,638. Applicant’s submission
does not show  when the 2018 return was filed. His 2017  return was filed on April  2, 2019,
and   his  2012   through   2016  tax   returns  were  filed   in   March  2019.   (AE  F)  These
submissions contradict Applicant’s testimony  as to when he filed his delinquent returns,
and his claim that the 2017 (and maybe 2018) Federal tax returns were filed on time.
Applicant testified that by 2014 or 2015, his financial life improved to allow him to
catch up on debts, taxes, and savings. Although he was aware that he owed tax debts,
he was fearful of using his savings to pay debts. He decided to accumulate savings rather
than address his tax debts. In June 2018, he completed his SCA, but failed to disclose
that he failed to file tax returns, or owed Federal and state taxes. He testified that he was
aware of his debts, but did not know how much he owed because he had not filed returns.
During his November 2018 interview by a Government investigator, he volunteered “that
he does have a few years of taxes that he needs to file, which weren’t listed due to error,”
and stated that “he needs to file 4 or 5 years’ worth of taxes since he’s been in [state “B”].”
GE 2)
Applicant testified that he traveled on vacation to Antigua, Canada, and England
in 2017, and again to England in 2018 or 2019. He also travels to Las Vegas, but does
not gamble. He owes about $100,000 in a recreational vehicle debt (current) and student
loans (deferred until December 2020). In 2014, he testified that he had delinquent student
loans and medical debts, but he is now current. He stated that he hoped to pay his tax
debts by 2021.
Applicant has about $25,000 in a savings account, $500 to $1,000 in a checking
account. He has about $40,000 in a 401k retirement plan, and just before the hearing, he
took out a loan for $20,000. Applicant’s adjusted gross income in 2018 was $93,727 and
$118,624  in  2019.  He  testified  that  he  expected  to  make  about  $100,000  in  2020.
Applicant testified that despite the availability of funds, he did not plan to pay his taxes
until 2021, because he believed it to be more valuable to have savings. He also testified
that he hoped to hire legal counsel to assist him in not paying the total tax debts that he
owes. He has not had financial counseling.
Applicant  submitted  credit  agency  scores  and  a  character  letter  from  a  work
supervisor who noted Applicant was one of his best employees, dependable, talented,
outstanding, and self-directed with no disciplinary issues or infractions. Finally, Applicant
incorrectly  claimed  in  his  post-hearing  submission  that  the  government  investigator
concluded in Applicant’s subject interview summary stating that Applicant’s background
cannot  be  used  to  blackmail  or  coerce  him.  As  a  matter  of  practice,  Government
investigators do not make conclusions or evaluations of the interviewee’s security status
in the subject interview summaries. Rather, statements such as this typically denotes an
Applicant’s summarized response to a related question.
