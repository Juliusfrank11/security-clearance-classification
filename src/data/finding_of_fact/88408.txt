In Applicant’s  answer to the SOR,  he  admitted the allegations in  SOR ¶¶  1.a, 1.c-
1.f, and   2.b.   He   denied the  allegation in   SOR ¶ 1.b.  In   his   response to the FORM, he
admitted the allegation in  the additional SOR ¶ 2.d. He did not expressly admit or deny
the allegation in  the amended SOR 1.f.  His  admissions  are incorporated in  my findings of
fact.
Applicant is a 53-year-old linguist employed by a defense  contractor since June
2018.  He   was  born  in  Afghanistan,  fled  to   India  during  the  Soviet  occupation,  and
immigrated to the United States in November 1981. He became a U.S. citizen in  1986.
He attended college in the United States and received a bachelor’s degree in economics
in  June 1999. In  November 1995, he  moved to  Russia to  operate  an import and  export
business. After  six  months, he moved to Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE),  in  order to
export  goods  from   the  UAE  to  Russia.  In  November  1996,  he  returned   to  the  United
States. From 1996 to 2000, he made multiple month-long trips to Russia, UAE, Indonesia,
China,  and Taiwan to attend  trade fairs and  arrange shipments  of goods to Russia. (GX
5 at 1-2.)
Applicant  worked  for  a  telecommunications  company  in  the  United  States  from
March  2001  to  December  2007,  when  he  was  laid  off.  He  was  unemployed  from
December 2007 until he was hired by his current employer. His SCA reflects that he was
reemployed by his former employer from January to June 2018. (GX 3 at 13.) However,
during a personal subject interview (PSI) in August 2018, he told a security investigator
that the information in the SCA was incorrect and that he was unemployed during that
period. (GX 4 at 7.) He has never held a security clearance.
Applicant  has  lived  with  his  wife  since  1995,  and  he  considers  himself  married
under Islamic law, he but has never registered his marriage in the United States. He and
his wife have a 22-year-old son.
From  December  2007  to  January  2010,  Applicant  and  his  wife  supported
themselves with their savings. Since January 2010, they have lived with his wife’s family
free of charge, taking care of his elderly father-in-law, who is an alcoholic and incapable
of caring for himself. Applicant’s  mother-in-law is deployed overseas in support of U.S.
forces  as  a  linguist.  During  a  counterintelligence  screening  interview  in  July  2018,
Applicant  explained  that  he  was  unemployed  because  he  lost  his  certificate  of
naturalization in January 2010 while moving to another state, could not afford the fee to
obtain a replacement copy, and was embarrassed to ask for money so that he could pay
the fee for a replacement. He did not provide any evidence of the cost of a replacement
certificate, but it would have been relatively expensive. The current fee for a replacement
certificate  is  $555.  (www.uscis.gov/forms/filing-fees.)  In  April  2018,  a  friend  gave
Applicant the money to replace the certificate of naturalization, enabling him to obtain his
current job in June 2018. (GX 4 at 6; GX 5 at 3.)
Between  March  2007  and  September  2018,  Applicant  was  involved  in  several
incidents of criminal conduct, which are alleged in reverse chronological order in the SOR.
The evidence concerning these incidents is summarized below.
SOR  1.f:  In  March  2007,  Applicant  uttered  an  insufficient-funds  check,  was
charged with a felony bad-check offense, and a warrant was issued for his arrest. He has
given  several  somewhat  different  explanations  of  the  circumstances  surrounding  his
uttering an insufficient-funds check. During the counterintelligence screening interview in
July 2018, he stated that he cashed a $1,200 check at a casino so that he could pay a
utility bill. (GX 5 at 10.) In a personal subject interview (PSI) in August 2018, he told a
security investigator that he gave the check to his wife for delivery to her father. (GX 4 at
12.) In his response to the FORM, he stated that he wrote the check to pay a utility bill,
not realizing that he had insufficient funds to cover the check. (FORM Response at 7.)
Applicant agreed to repay the bad check over a six-month period, but failed to do
so. (GX 5 at 10.) In September 2011, after he had moved to another state, he was stopped
for a traffic violation, the outstanding warrant was discovered, and he was arrested. At his
trial,  adjudication  was  deferred,  conditioned  on  restitution  and  good  behavior.  He
completed paying the restitution in October 2014 and the charge was dismissed. (GX 11.)
SOR ¶ 1.e: In January 2011, Applicant was arrested and charged with burglary
after  stealing  diabetic  test  strips  from  a  retail  store,  intending  to  sell  them  because  he
needed money. He pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of shoplifting and was sentenced to
confinement for 10 days, payment of fines and restitution totaling $1,140, and ordered to
have no direct or indirect contact with the retail store. He spent five days in jail. The court
records  reflect  that  Applicant  had  made  no  payments  on  the  fines  or  the  restitution
requirement as of February 7, 2020. (GX 12.)
SOR  ¶  1.d:  In  July  2012,  Applicant  was  charged  with  felony  possession  of
methamphetamine. He gave two explanations for this incident: (1) that he was alone and
disposing  of  his  wife’s  methamphetamine  pipe  after  she  had  abstained  for  two  years
(FORM Response at 6; GX 4 at 13); and (2) that he was walking with his wife, they were
stopped by a policeman for jaywalking, and he took the pipe from his wife to shield her
from being charged (GX 5 at 9). He pleaded guilty to misdemeanor possession of drugs
and  was  sentenced  to  imprisonment  for  three  days,  credited  with  time  served,  and
required to attend drug-education classes. (GX 10.)
SOR  ¶  1.c:  In  July  2012,  Applicant  was  charged  with  petit  larceny  for  stealing
diapers from a store. The purpose for stealing diapers is unclear, because his only child
would have been 14 years old at the time. (GX 3 at 23.) He pleaded guilty and was ordered
to attend drug counseling and to stay out of trouble for six months. (GX 9.)
SOR ¶ 1.b: In July 2013, Applicant was charged with domestic battery. His wife
and  intoxicated  father-in-law  were  arguing,  and  his  father-in-law  was  shouting  and
cursing. Applicant pushed his father-in-law while trying to keep his wife and his father-in-
law separated, and his wife called the police. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated
that that he declined to press charges against his father-in-law and that his father-in-law
did not press charges against him. During the counterintelligence screening interview, he
told the investigator that the charges were dismissed because his father-in-law was too
drunk to appear in court. (GX 5 at 10.) However, the court records reflect that a criminal
complaint was filed against Applicant, an arrest warrant was issued, he was taken into
custody,  and  a  public  defender  was  appointed.  On  request  of  the  defense,  he  was
released on his own recognizance, on the condition that he could not live in the same
house  as  his  father-in-law.  In  August  2013,  the  charges  were  dismissed  “per
negotiations.” (GX 8.)
SOR  ¶  1.a:  In  September  2018,  after  Applicant  submitted  his  SCA  and  had
undergone  his  counterintelligence  screening  and  a  PSI,  he  was  charged  with  felony
larceny, after stealing a music compact disc worth about $25 from a store. In his answer
to the SOR, he stated that he intended to give the compact disc to his wife as a birthday
gift. In his response to the FORM, he stated that he tried to return the compact disc to the
store for store credit so that he could buy personal necessities. He pleaded no contest to
misdemeanor petit larceny and was sentenced to confinement for 60 days, suspended;
fined  $500,  satisfied  by  transfer  of  cash  bail;  and  ordered  to  have  no  contact  with  the
store. (GX 7; Response to FORM, AX D.)
The SOR also alleges that Applicant failed to timely file federal and state income
tax returns and owes federal and state taxes. The evidence concerning each allegation
is summarized below.
SOR ¶¶ 2.a (federal tax debt) and 2.d (failure to timely file returns for 2006,
2007, and 2008). When Applicant submitted his SCA in July 2018, he disclosed that he
did not file any income tax returns after he was laid off in November 2007, and that he
believed he owed about $1,200 in state or federal income taxes. (GX 3 at 36-37.) During
his  counterintelligence  screening  interview,  he  stated  that  he  visited  an  IRS  office  in
February 2018 and was informed that his tax debts for 2006, 2007, and 2008 had been
charged  off  as  bad  debts  and  were  treated  as  income.  (GX  5  at  16.)  It  is  likely  that
Applicant misunderstood the IRS employee, because the IRS subsequently informed him
that he owed $49,637 for tax years 2006, 2007, and 2008.
On February 27, 2018, Applicant made an installment agreement with the IRS to
resolve his tax debt by paying $50 per month beginning in April 2018 (GX 4 at 18; GX 13;
AX  H.)  In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  submitted  an  Annual  Installment  Agreement
Statement from the IRS reflecting payments between July 2018 and July 2019, reflecting
two payments of $100 and $350. (Answer at 6-8.) He also submitted copies of 14 money
orders,  two  of  which  were  illegible.  They  were  issued  between  January  2018  and
November 2019. All are for $50, except one for $82 that was issued in April 2018. The
copies do not reflect the payee, except for the one dated June 23, 2019, on which he
wrote “United States Treasury.” (Answer at 9-11.) Finally, he submitted copies of his bank
statements reflecting eight payments to the U.S. Treasury between April and December
2019, in amounts varying from $20 to $100. (Answer at 15-37.) In his response to the
FORM,  he  submitted  an  e-file  signature  authorization  (IRS  Form  8879)  dated  June  1,
2020, for a 2019 federal tax return reflecting taxes of $540 withheld and claiming a refund
of $540. (AX H.).
SOR  ¶¶  2.b  (failure  to   timely   file  state  income  tax  return  for  2006)  and   2.c
(state tax debt of $2,595).  Applicant  failed  to timely file  his state income tax  return for
2006, incurring a delinquent tax debt of $2,595. In January 2019, he submitted a request
for   an   installment  agreement  providing  for  monthly  payments  of   $250.  (GX   14.)   In   his
answer  to  the  SOR,  he  submitted  copies  of  his  bank  statements  reflecting  six   $250
payments to  the state tax  authority between March and  November 2019. (Answer at 15-
36.) In his response  to  the FORM, he submitted evidence that he made $250  payments
in   September  2020,  October  2020,  and   December  2020.  (AX  G.)  He   also  submitted
photocopies of money orders for  $250 purchased in  March,  April, June, September,  and
October 2020, but the  photocopies do not reflect  the payees  for  those money orders. (AX
H.)
In  July  2020,  Applicant  completed  a  computer-based  course  of  instruction  on
financial management developed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. (AX K.)
In November 2020, he submitted a personal financial statement (PFS) dated November
20, 2020. It reflects net monthly income of $5,100, debt payments of $525 ($250 to IRS,
with a balance of $49,000; $250 to state tax authority, with a balance of $14,000; and $25
to a credit-card account with a balance of $1,000). The PFS reflects monthly expenses of
$2,025 and a net monthly remainder of $3,075. (AX J.) A November 2020 credit report
from Experian reflects only two open accounts (one credit card reflected in the PFS and
another credit card with a zero balance), no adverse entries, and a FICO score of 789.
(AX I.)
Applicant has served as a linguist in Afghanistan since February 2019. He received
a certificate of appreciation for his expertise, professionalism, and dedication from June
2019  to  June  2020.  (AX  A.)  His  linguistic  services  manager,  a  civilian,  and  military
supervisor¸  an  Army  lieutenant  colonel,  submitted  a  joint  letter  attesting  to  Applicant’s
linguistic  skills,  cultural  awareness,  calm  and  focused  demeanor,  integrity,  and
professionalism. They strongly support his application for a security clearance. His two
linguist  supervisors,  an  Army  major  and  an  Army  lieutenant  colonel,  also  strongly
recommend that Applicant receive a security clearance. (AX B.)...
A friend of Applicant, who has known him for 35 years, is now serving at the U.S.
Embassy  in  Kabul,  Afghanistan  and  holds  a  top  secret  clearance,  submitted  a  letter
strongly supporting Applicant’s application for a clearance. He has reviewed the SOR and
does not believe that the allegations are reflective of Applicant’s character, patriotism, or
willingness to protect classified information. To the contrary, he believes that Applicant is
a hardworking, honest, and reliable person who should be granted a clearance. (AX C.)
This friend is the person who gave Applicant the money to obtain a replacement for his
lost naturalization certificate. (GX 5 at 3.)
