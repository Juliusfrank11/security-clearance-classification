Applicant,  age  50,  married  in  2018  and  has  one  adult  son.  She  obtained  her
Master’s  degree  in  2003.  Applicant  completed  her  security  clearance  application  on
August 22, 2018. She has been employed with her current employer since 2016.  She
has held a security clearance since 2008. (GE 1).
The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  has  eleven  delinquent  debts,  three  for  medical
collection  accounts  in  the  approximate  amount  of  $99.  The  debts  include  seven
delinquent student loan debts in the approximate amount of $216,847. Applicant denied
that all allegations for student loans were not paid or past due. (SOR)The SOR further
alleged a collection account for an apartment in the amount of $489.
Applicant  acknowledged  that  not  all  of  the  student  loans  belonged  to  her.  She
explained  that  she  obtained  some  for  her  son  so  that  he  could  complete  his  college
education, and that she was a single parent. (Tr. 18). She could not recall the amount of
money for the student loans which belonged to her. (Tr. 18)  In her 2019 subject interview,
she stated that some of the student loans were duplicates on her credit reports after she
had  consolidated  some  of  the  student  loans.  (GE  2)  In  her  DOHA  interrogatories,  she
stated that all the student loans were paid, that she had a payment plan, but that she had
no  documentation  to  show  payments.  At  the  hearing,  Applicant  had  no  idea  how  the
student loans were combined. (Tr. 23)
The student loans date from 2000 until 2011. (Tr. 44) Applicant stated she had a
repayment plan for a few years with one servicer, but did not realize that it expired after
one year. However, she received an email that stated the servicing agent had changed
and  directed  her  to  the  proper  source.  (GE  4)  She  claims  she  continued  to  make
payments but they were not counted. (Tr. 20) None of this information on student loans
was included in her security clearance application.
Applicant presented a document showing rehabilitation terms and conditions, for
her student loans, dated December 2019. The first payment of $633 was due in January
2020.  (AE)  F  She  believed  the  payment  is  for  the  student  loans  alleged  in  SOR  1.a
through 1.d. (Tr. 23)
Applicant submitted post-hearing documentation concerning the payments made
but there were no account numbers to match the student loans, and the various payments
were started in 2019. There was a copy of a note from federal student aid that some or
all of the federal student loans were rehabilitated from September 2019 until November
2020. There is no connection to discern which student loans were rehabilitated.
As for the medical accounts in 1.e, 1. 1g, and 1.h, Applicant presented a receipt
for a total amount of $117 paid on February 13, 2020. (AE H)
Applicant  denied  that  she  owed  the  alleged  2018  debt  of  $489  in  1.f.  She  told
investigators that she was not aware of this debt. She explained at the hearing that it was
a debt from an apartment that her son was renting in college. She co-signed the loan.
(Tr.25) She stated that it has been removed from her credit report. She had not tried to
resolve this debt.
As to  the  student  loan  accounts  in 1.i,  1.j,  and 1.k.,  Applicant  claimed  that  they
were also in consolidation and she has been paying the $633 for the loans. (Tr. 28) The
post-hearing submission (AE J) did not substantiate her claim.
Applicant presented a letter of recommendation and employee reviews. (AE C  )
and D. She also presented performance reviews which attest that she is competent and
handles her duties in a professional manner. (AE C and D).
Applicant earns approximately $120,000 a year. (Tr. 34) A pay stub (GE 4) shows
that her earnings for a pay period in 2019 were $ 158,938. Applicant acknowledged that
may have included bonuses. Her husband earns approximately $150-$160,000 per year.
(Tr.37) Applicant has a net remainder of approximately $1,000. (Tr.41) She has no written
budget and has not received financial counseling. (Tr. 57)
Applicant’s credit bureau report shows that the reason for her credit score is that
she  has  too  many  over-due  accounts.  (AE  I)  The  original  amount  of  her  student  loan
accounts was approximately $60,000 to $70,000, but due to defaulted payments or no
payments until 2019 or 2020 the amount is now over $200,000.
Although the SOR does not contain any allegation with regard to federal or state
tax liens, when asked routine financial question by the Government, she stated that she
had none. (Tr. 58) Applicant’s final post-hearing submission (AE K) shows she contacted
a tax attorney on November 19, 2020 to resolve the issue of the tax liens (federal and
state) for delinquent taxes from about 2009 until 2011. (GE 7 and 8)
