file his state income tax returns for tax years 2012 through 2015 when they were due.
He asserted that he completed the 2012 state return, but forgot to file it. He then lost the
return  and  corresponding  tax  documents.  He  did  not  file  the  2013  through  2015  state
tax  returns because  he  had  not  filed  the  2012  return. He  filed  his  state  tax  returns  for
2016 forward on a timely basis. (Items 2-4)
