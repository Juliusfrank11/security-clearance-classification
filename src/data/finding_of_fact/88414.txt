In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted,  with  brief  comments,  all  of  the
factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through
1.i.). Applicant’s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete
and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same,
I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 44-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as a production technician II with his current employer since March 2018. He previously
worked for a variety of employers as an electronics technician from May 2016 until March
2018;  as  an  electronics  technician  from  January  2016  until  May  2016;  as  a
telecommunications  specialist  from  April  2014  until  May  2015;  and  as  a  field  service
representative  in  Afghanistan  for  different  defense  contractors  from  August  2013  until
April 2014; and from July 2012 until August 2013. He is a May 1995 high school graduate
with some university credits, but no degree. He enlisted in the U.S. Navy (USN) in January
1996, and served on active duty until January 2012, when he was honorably discharged
as  an  E-5.  During  his  active  military  service,  he  was  deployed  to  Bahrain,  Oman,  and
Djibouti (September 2004 until March 2005); to Iraq (September 2009 until March 2010);
and Bahrain (September 2010 until July 2011).  He served in the USN inactive reserve
from  January  2012  until  January  2015.  He  was  granted  a  secret  clearance  in  2007.
Applicant was married in 2002. He has two children, born in 2002 and 2005, respectively,
as well as two stepchildren, born in 1994 and 1996, respectively.
Financial Considerations
General source information pertaining to the financial issues discussed below can
be found in the following exhibits: Item 1 (Answer to the SOR, undated); Item 2 (SF 86,
dated  March  22,  2017);  Item  3  (Enhanced  Subject  Interview,  dated  July  3,  2018,  and
Subject  Contact,  dated  July  17,  2018);  Item  7  (Combined  Experian,  TransUnion,  and
Equifax Credit Report, dated May 4, 2017); Item 6 (Equifax Credit Report, dated April 9,
2019); Item 4 (Responses to Interrogatories, dated June 20, 2019); and Item 5 (Equifax
Credit Report, dated October 29, 2020).
Financial  difficulties  are  not  new  to  Applicant.  On  January  28,  2009,  the
Department of the Navy (DON) CAF issued him an SOR citing security concerns under
Guideline  F  (Financial  Considerations).  On  April  2,  2009,  the  DON  CAF  issued  him  a
favorable  determination
that  he  had  submitted  sufficient  mitigating
circumstances and explanations to support a favorable decision. Nevertheless, despite
the  favorable  determination,  he  was  strongly  cautioned  to  avoid  similar  derogatory
circumstances. (Item 8, SOR and Favorable Determination)
indicating
Applicant went through two separate periods of unemployment. The initial period
occurred upon his discharge from active duty, and it lasted from January 2012 until July
2012. During that period, he was supported by unemployment benefits and G.I. Bill funds
for school, and he attended a university from March 2012 until October 2012. The second
period started when he was terminated due to a communications issue in May 2015, and
lasted  until  January  2016.  During  that  period,  he  was  supported  by  unemployment
benefits, savings, and his wife’s part-time employment wages.
In July 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator from the U.S. Office of
Personnel  Management  (OPM).  During  the  interview,  he  acknowledged  only  two
delinquent  accounts.  One  referred  to  a  repossessed  automobile,  and  the  other  was
related to student loans and G.I. Bill benefits for which there were conflicting facts. As a
result of the student loan issue, Applicant explained that his wages were garnished ($200
per  month  until  February  2017).  He  did  not  submit  any  documentation  to  support  the
garnishment.  He  denied  having  any  other  delinquent  accounts.  When  the  OPM
investigator confronted him with other delinquent accounts, Applicant either claimed to be
unaware of the account(s) or recalled some facts regarding other accounts. On July 3,
2018, he described his financial situation as improving, and he claimed that he was able
and willing to repay all debts. He contended he was on a budget. He acknowledged that
he  had  never  received  financial  counseling.  (Item  3,  at  10-11)  During  a  subsequent
interview, he recalled additional facts pertaining to some of the accounts he had already
discussed. (Item 3, at 13)
In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant acknowledged that he has not always been
the most financially responsible person, but he had always tried to live within his means.
He attributed his financial problems to having lost a very high paying job in 2015, and his
over six-month period of unemployment. He contended that he prioritized his bills, and
pushed the bills that were not immediately important off to the side while trying to care for
his family of six individuals. When he obtained new employment, it was at a lesser salary,
and he fell back even further financially. He borrowed money from his family, and although
he repaid most of what he had borrowed, he was still in the process of doing so. (Item 1)
The SOR alleged nine delinquent accounts totaling approximately $25,711, but it
failed  to  allege  any  delinquent  balances  for  two  of  the  alleged  accounts,  and  simply
alleged that they had been charged off. In fact, two of the alleged accounts refer to the
same account during different phases of existence. The accounts are set forth as follows:
SOR  ¶  1.a.  refers  to  an  automobile  loan  for  Applicant’s  stepson.  His  stepson
stopped making the $500 monthly payments when he lost his job in January 2015, and
although Applicant tried to continue making those payments, when he lost his own job,
he  too  was  eventually  unable  to  continue  doing  so,  and  the  vehicle  was  voluntarily
repossessed  in  February  2016.  The  vehicle  originally  cost  $22,000,  and  although  the
account was charged off in the amount of $17,234 in May 2016, the SOR alleged that the
unpaid balance is $11,847. (Item 5, at 2; Item 6, at 1; Item 7, at 2; Item 3, at 10) In the
nearly  five  years  since  the  repossession,  Applicant  has  made  no  effort  to  enter  into
payment  arrangements  with  the  creditor  or  make  any  payments.  (Item  4,  at  2)  The
account has not been resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.b.  refers  to  an  unsecured  loan  that  Applicant’s  wife  took  out  for  her
daughter,  in  Applicant’s  name,  using  his  power  of  attorney.  Payments  stopped  being
made in June 2016,  and the  unpaid  balance of  $5,056 was  charged off.  In July 2018,
Applicant told the OPM investigator that he was “currently working” with the creditor to
set up a payment plan, and that he was willing and able to pay the debt. (Item 5, at 4;
Item 6, at 2; Item 7, at 6; Item 3, at 13) Since he made that statement, Applicant has made
no effort to enter into payment arrangements with the creditor or make any payments.
(Item 4, at 2) The account has not been resolved.
SOR  ¶  1.c.  refers  to  an  unspecified  type  of  account  with  an  unpaid  balance  of
$4,247 that was placed for collection. (Item 5, at 2; Item 6, at 2) Applicant has made no
effort to enter into payment arrangements with the creditor or make any payments. (Item
4, at 3) The account has not been resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.d. refers to an unspecified type of retail account with an unpaid balance
of $969 that was placed for collection and transferred or sold to a debt purchaser. (Item
5, at 2; Item 6, at 2; Item 7, at 11) Applicant contended that the account was associated
with his daughter’s dental services, and that she had repeatedly failed to make payments.
(Item 3, at 11) He has made no effort to enter into payment arrangements with the creditor
or make any payments. (Item 4, at 3) The account has not been resolved.
SOR ¶¶ 1.e. and 1.h. refer to the same bank-issued credit-card account with an
unpaid balance of $640 that was charged off and sold to a debt purchaser. (Item 5, at 3;
Item 6, at 2) Applicant has made no effort to enter into payment arrangements with the
creditor or make any payments. (Item 4, at 3) The account has not been resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.f. refers to a medical account with an unpaid balance of $460 that was
placed for collection. (Item 6, at 2) Applicant has made no effort to enter into payment
arrangements with the creditor or make any payments. (Item 4, at 4) The account has not
been resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.g. refers to a bank-issued credit-card account with a high credit of $793
that became delinquent and placed for collection. An unspecified balance was charged
off.  (Item  5,  at  3;  Item  6,  at  2)  Applicant  has  made  no  effort  to  enter  into  payment
arrangements with the creditor or make any payments. (Item 4, at 4) The account has not
been resolved.
SOR ¶ 1.i. refers to a student loan or G.I. Bill overpayments with an unpaid balance
of $2,492 that was placed for collection. (Item 7, at 11) It remains unclear if Applicant has
made  any  effort  to  enter  into  payment  arrangements  with  the  creditor  or  make  any
payments. The account has not been resolved.
As noted above, when Applicant  was interviewed by the OPM investigator in July
2018, he claimed to be willing and able to pay his delinquent accounts. Nevertheless, he
offered no evidence that he had  entered into any repayment arrangements or made any
payments to  his creditors. In  June 2019, he submitted a Personal Financial Statement  in
which  he indicated that his net  monthly income was $4,900; his monthly expenses were
$4,055.25; and  that his  monthly remainder available for  discretionary  spending or savings
was approximately $845. Despite  claiming  that he was repaying a family loan, he listed
no loans or other debts  under the debts section of the Personal Financial Statement.  (Item
4) His current financial  situation is not known. He  claimed  that he had  a family budget,
but he offered no documentation  to support  his claim. In the absence of additional more
recent financial  information, it  remains difficult to determine if Applicant  is currently in  a
better position financially than he had been.
