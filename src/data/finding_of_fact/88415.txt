Financial Considerations
The SOR alleges six delinquent debts totaling $24,152 as follows:
SOR  ¶  1.a  is  a  charged-off  debt  for  $15,933  owed  to  a  credit  union.  Applicant
borrowed $20,000 from the creditor to purchase a motorcycle, and the account became
delinquent when he was deployed. (Item 3 at 6) His February 4, 2019 SCA indicates the
“financial issue began” in September 2010; he disagreed “with method of payment after
loan was late”; and he was “saving to pay a lump sum to them to satisfy the debt.” (Item
2 at 41)
SOR ¶ 1.b is a charged-off debt for $4,351 owed to a bank. Applicant’s February
4, 2019 SCA indicates the “financial issue began” in September 2007; the creditor wanted
a lump sum payment; and he was “[s]aving money to pay lump sum.” (Item 2 at 39-40)
SOR ¶ 1.c is a charged-off debt for $1,379 owed to a bank. Applicant’s February
4,  2019  SCA  indicates  the  “financial  issue  began”  in  November  2007,  and  he  was
“[a]waiting to pay lump sum.” (Item 2 at 40-41) He said he shared the account with his
older  sister.  (Item  1,  SOR  response)  “She  used  a  credit  repair  company  without  [his]
knowledge,  and  the  first  action  this  company  took  was  to  close  this  account  without  it
being paid off. Again, the company wanted the full amount since the account was closed.”
(Item 1, SOR response)
SOR ¶ 1.d  is a  debt placed for collection for $1,202.  Applicant’s February 4,  2019
SCA indicates the “financial issue  began” in  either August or  November 2016; he  moved
and  was not notified of the  debt; and  he was “[a]waiting to  pay lump sum.” (Item  2  at  42-
43)  On  September  22,  2020,  Applicant   paid   $1,001   and   resolved  this  debt.   (FORM
response)
SOR ¶ 1.e  is a debt placed for collection for $1,145.  Applicant’s February 4, 2019
SCA indicates the “financial issue  began” in  either August or  November 2016; he  moved
and  was not notified of the  debt; and  he was “[a]waiting to  pay lump sum.” (Item  2  at  42-

of the debt; and he was “[a]waiting to pay lump sum.” (Item 2 at 41-42) On September 22,
2020, Applicant paid $122 and resolved this debt. (FORM response)
In his Office of Personnel Management personal subject interview on March 27,
2019, Applicant acknowledged his responsibility for the SOR debts. (Item 3) He disagreed
with some of the charges his creditors claimed, and he emphasized that he intended to
pay the debts as soon as he had saved sufficient funds to do so. (Id.)
In  the  FORM,  Department   Counsel  noted  the  absence  of  corroborating  or
supporting   documentation  of  resolution  of  the  SOR  debts.   Aside  from  Applicant’s
uncorroborated statements  and  credit reports, at  the time the FORM was issued, there
to  pay,  settled,
was   no  documentary  evidence
compromised,  or  otherwise   resolved  any   of  the  SOR  debts.   The   FORM  informed
Applicant  that  he  had   30  days  from  the   receipt  of  the  FORM  “in  which  to   submit   a
documentary  response  setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation,
or explanation, as appropriate. If  you do not file  any objections or submit any additional
information . . . your  case will be assigned to an Administrative Judge for  a  determination
based solely” on the evidence set forth in this FORM.  (FORM at  2  (emphasis added))
that  Applicant   paid,  arranged
Applicant responded with receipts showing payment of the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.d,
1.e, and 1.f. He said that he paid a credit monitoring service and received some financial
advice about how to improve his credit score, reduce his debt, make timely payments,
and  pay  off  collections.  (FORM  response).  He  received  two  Air  Force  Achievement
Medals  when  he  was  on  active  duty  and  deployed.  (Id.)  He  acknowledged  making
financial  decisions  in  the  past  that  he  regretted,  and  he  is  taking  responsibility  for  his
delinquent debts. (Id.) He said:
My wife and I purchased a home in February of 2019 and have never been
late on a payment.  We paid off  my wife’s vehicle this year as well. We live
within our means and  are  working on paying off the last of my collections. I
hope  by  showing  proof  that   I  have  paid  off   half  of  the  findings   brought
against me,  [that my actions] will  shine light [on] the  fact that I am financially
responsible.   It  is  my  sincerest  hope  that  this  is  enough  to  convince  the
parties involved to renew  my security clearance so I can continue to aid the
United States Air Force [in its  mission  to]  continue to defend this country.
(Id.)
Applicant’s most recent credit report is dated October 22, 2020. (Item 6) The only
