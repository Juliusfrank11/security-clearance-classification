Applicant,  age  32,  is  divorced  with  one  minor  child.  He  received  a  high  school
diploma  in  2006.  He  has  been  employed  as  an  avionics  technician  by  a  defense
contractor since May 2018. Applicant previously held a security clearance while serving
on active duty with the U.S. Marine Corps from October 2007 until September 2017, when
he was discharged under other than honorable conditions. (Item 2)
In 2012, Applicant drove to a friend’s house after a 24-hour work shift to help his
friend with yard work. After completing the yard work, Applicant watched television for a
time and then left to go home. During his drive home, he fell asleep at the wheel and hit
a neighbor’s truck. He  attributed the incident to his lack of  sleep. He  was charged with
reckless driving – wanton disregard. A court found him guilty of the charge. (Item 1; Item
3 at 7).
In 2014, Applicant  consumed four mixed drinks over four and one-half hours while
at  a  restaurant  with  coworkers.  He   then  drove  back  to  base.  Because  he  smelled  of
alcohol  when  he  presented  his  identification  at  the  gate,  he  was  administered  a  field
sobriety test,  which  he failed. He  was also administered a breathalyzer, which registered
a  .14  blood  alcohol   count   (BAC).  He   attributed  the   incident  to   poor  judgment  and
intoxication.  He   received   a  Non-Judicial  Punishment   (NJP)  for  Drunken  or  Reckless
Operation of Vehicle  (Article  111)  under Article  15  of the  Uniform  Code of Military Justice
(UCMJ). The  NJP  resulted in  a reduction in  rank, forfeiture of $2,426,  45 days of restriction
and  extra duty. Applicant’s driver’s license was suspended  for  six  months, and  he was
ordered to take alcohol-education courses.  (Item 1; Item 2 at 21-22, 33-34; Item  3 at 5-6,
8)
In  2017,  Applicant  consumed  six  beers  while  at  a  few  bars  by  himself.  While
walking  outside  one  of  the  bars,  two  men  unknown  to  Applicant  approached  him  and
asked if he wanted to go to a party. Applicant agreed and entered their car, which was
parked in the parking lot outside of the bar. The men offered Applicant cocaine, which he
accepted.  He  felt  sick  after  consuming  the  cocaine  and  immediately  exited  the  car  to
vomit. He then walked back to his car, which had been parked in the same parking lot.
He decided to sleep in his car until morning, and then he drove home for the weekend.
When  he  returned  to  work  the  following  Monday,  he  was  subjected  to  a  random  drug
screening. He tested positive for cocaine. He attributed the incident to being intoxicated.
He  received  an  NJP  for  Wrongful  Use  of  a  Controlled  Substance  (Article  112a)  under
Article 15 of the UCMJ. The NJP resulted in a reduction in rank, forfeiture of $2,534, and
45  days  of  restriction  and  extra  duty.  He  was  subsequently  discharged  from  the  U.S.
Marine Corps under other than honorable conditions for this misconduct. (Item 1; Item 2
at 22, 34-36; Item 3 at 4-6; Item 4)
In  December  2018,  Applicant  consumed  four  mixed  drinks  and  two  to  three  tall
beers while at a bar by himself. He went outside of the bar to retrieve a pack of cigarettes
from his car and decided to leave to go home. While driving home, an officer stopped him
for failure to maintain his lane. After refusing to take a field sobriety test, he was arrested
and  transported  to  the  police  station.  While  at  the  station,  he  was  administered  a
breathalyzer, which registered a .17 BAC. He was then charged with Driving Under the
Influence (DUI) and spent two days in jail. He self-reported the incident to his employer
the day following his release from jail. The charge was scheduled for disposition in April
2019, which was not pronounced in the record.  (Item 1; Item 3 at 12)
There is no mention in  the record of the specific day that Applicant’s December
2018 DUI occurred. Applicant was interviewed on December 4, 2018 (Interview #1) and
December 12, 2018 (Interview #2) in connection with the background investigation of his
security  clearance  application.  He  did  not  discuss  his  December  2018  DUI  during
Interviews  #1  and  #2.  In  April  2019,  he  was  interviewed  specifically  to  discuss  the
December 2018 DUI. There is neither an indication in the record nor any allegation that
he intentionally omitted the December 2018 DUI during Interviews #1 and #2. (Item 3)
Applicant first consumed alcohol in 2008 at age 20. Because it made him sick the
first time, he did not consume it again until his 21st birthday. From ages 21 through 25,
he consumed approximately six beers once per week. From age 25 through September
2017, he consumed approximately 12 beers two times per week. From September 2017
through at least December 2018, he consumed six beers two times per week. Applicant
admitted that he consumed alcohol to intoxication twice per month between age 21 and
December 2018. He defined intoxication as slurred speech and stumbling. He estimated
that it takes approximately eight beers for him to become intoxicated. Applicant does not
feel  that  he  has  a  problem  with  alcohol.  He  has  not  had  any  alcohol  counseling  or
treatment. He has no intent to drive under the influence in the future. (Item 3 at 8, 12)
Applicant acknowledged that his 2017 cocaine use was “wrong and stupid” and
vowed never to use it or any other illegal drugs again. He asserted that he used cocaine
only once, but admitted that he used marijuana two times in 2006. He has no intent to
use any  illegal  drugs  in the  future because of the  negative effect it  had on his  military
career, his life, and prospective employment opportunities. (Item 2 at 35-36; Item 3 at 8)
