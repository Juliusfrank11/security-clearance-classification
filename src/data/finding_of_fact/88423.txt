Applicant  is  50  years  old,  and  married.  He  has  a  Bachelor  of  Science  degree.
Applicant  requires  access  to  personally  identifiable  information  in  order  to  perform  his
work  duties.  He  has  been  employed  by  his  current  employer  since  2018  as  a  Field
Support Engineer. (Tr. 5-6, 14.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline H – Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for  access
to sensitive information because he has used illegal drugs. Applicant admitted all three
allegations under this paragraph.
Applicant  has  used  marijuana  with  varying  frequencies  from  1985  until  the
present. He used it on an infrequent but regular basis until 2015. In 2015 he moved to
his  current  state  of  residence,  which  allows  marijuana  use  by  people  possessing  a
medical marijuana card. Applicant has possessed a medical marijuana card since that
time. Applicant stated that he currently uses marijuana on almost a daily basis because
of a medical condition for which marijuana provides relief. Applicant stated that he only
buys marijuana from legal marijuana dispensaries. Applicant testified that he last used
marijuana two days before his hearing on December 8, 2020. Applicant also stated that
he  knew marijuana use was  not allowed by  people applying  for, or  granted, access to
sensitive  information,  but  that  he  intended  to  continue  to  use  marijuana  in  the  future.
(Tr. 15-16, 19-20, 23-29; Government Exhibits 1 and 2; Applicant Exhibit A.)
Applicant told the Human Resources manager at his current employer about his
drug use before beginning work with them in 2018. That was because Applicant knew
that  he  would  have  to  take  a  drug  test  and  marijuana  would  be  detected.  Applicant
testified that he was told  by the Human Resources manager that his employer’s policy
was to allow drug use that was legal in the state of employment. (Tr. 21-23.)
