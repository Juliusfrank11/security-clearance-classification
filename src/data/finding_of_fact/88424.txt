In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  all  the  allegations,  with
explanations.  His  admissions  in  his  answer  and  at  the  hearing  are  incorporated  in  my
findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  32-year-old  engineering  technician  employed  by  a  defense
contractor since February 2009. He was unemployed for about three months before being
hired  for  his  current position.  He  attended various educational institutions  from August
2007 to September 2018 but did not receive a degree. He has never married. He has a
four-year-old daughter for whom he pays child support. He received a security clearance
in December 2014.
The SOR alleges 15 delinquent debts, of which 8 are student loans. The delinquent
debts are reflected in credit reports from March 2019 and September 2019. (GX 3; GX
4.) The evidence concerning these debts is summarized below.
SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.e, 1.g, 1.n, and  1.o: student loans totaling about $34,848.  The
student loans alleged  in  SOR ¶¶  1.b and  1.d  were opened  in  August 2008.  The  student
loan alleged in  SOR ¶  1.g was opened  in  September 2011. The  student loans alleged in
SOR ¶¶  1.a and  1.d  were opened  in  October 2011. The  student loan alleged  in  SOR ¶
1.e  was  opened   in   July  2012.  Applicant   fell  behind  on  his  student  loans  in   April  2017
because he could not afford to pay them and keep up with his child-support payments of
$600 per month.  At the  time,  he was earning about $41,000 per year. (Tr.  60-61.) His pay
was garnished and the loans were brought up to date in November 2017.
The loans alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.n and 1.o were referred for collection in February
2018.  (GX  4  at  1-2.)  The  loans  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.e  and  1.g  were  referred  for
collection  in  April  2018.  (GX  3  at  5-6.)  Applicant  stopped  attending  college  courses  in
September 2018 without obtaining a degree, and he began working full time because he
did not want to incur any more student loans. (Tr. 27-28.)
Applicant disclosed his delinquent student loans and the other debts alleged in the
SOR when he submitted his SCA in February 2019. He paid $1,125 in March 2019 to
bring  one  of  his  loans  up  to  date,  and  he  was  questioned  about  them  by  a  security
investigator in April 2019. (GX 2 at 4.) As of November 2019, he was making payments
of  about  $150  per  month  on  two  consolidated  student  loans  totaling  about  $15,714.
(Answer at 17.)
In February 2020, Applicant applied for consolidation of all his student loans. All
his student loans now have been consolidated into four loans totaling $33,424, all of which
are in forbearance. (Tr. 21-22; AX A.) He anticipates that he will be paying a total of about
$212 per month after the period of forbearance ends. (Tr. 36.) He has received pay raises
every year and is financially able to make the payments when the forbearance ends. His
annual pay increased to $55,000 in 2018, and in December 2019, it increased to $75,000
per year. (Tr. 60-61.)
SOR ¶ 1.f: charge  account charged off for $627. Applicant incurred this debt to
buy a desk in January 2013. His last payment was in May 2013. (Tr. 38; GX 4 at 2.) In his
answer and at the hearing, he stated that he had contacted the collection agency and
original creditor, and they informed him that they had charged off the debt and will not
accept a payment. (Tr. 22, 39; Answer at 1.) He contacted the original creditor and was
informed that an IRS Form 1099-C, reflecting the cancellation of the debt, would be sent
within 15 days. At the time of the hearing, he was waiting for the IRS Form 1099-C. (Tr.
67.)  After  the  hearing,  he  contacted  the  creditor  again  and  was  informed  that  that  he
would receive the IRS Form 1099-C by January 16, 2021. When he did not receive it, he
contacted the creditor a third time and was informed that the document had not been sent
because they could not verify his address. Documentation of his repeated contacts with
the creditor is attached to the record as AX I. I am satisfied that the debt was cancelled.
SOR  ¶  1.h:  credit-card  account   charged  off   for  $133.  Applicant  opened  this
account in December 2015 to build his credit, and he made payments until August 2016.
The  debt  was  charged  off  in  January  2017.  (GX  3  at  6;  Tr.  40.)  In  February  2020,  he
settled the debt for $80.26. (Answer at 12; Tr. 41.)
SOR  ¶  1.i:  delinquent  rent  payments  referred  for  collection  of  $3,892.   This
debt was incurred April 2016, when Applicant moved out of an apartment without giving
60 days’ notice. (GX 2 at 4.) His monthly rent had been $1,000. The landlord increased
the rent to $1,500 and demanded payment for the equivalent of two months’ rent at the
increased rate. The debt was referred for collection in June 2016. (GX 3 at 11.) Applicant
made monthly payments of $252 for about a year and then settled the debt in January
2020 for $1,557. (Answer at 13; GX 2 at 4; AX E; Tr. 45.)
SOR ¶ 1.j: debt  to  insurance company   referred  for collection   of  $984.  This
debt was incurred when Applicant sold a vehicle but neglected to cancel the insurance.
The debt was referred for collection in January 2016. (GX 3 at 11.) In February 2020, he
made an agreement to pay $984 in four installments. (Answer at 15.) He complied with
his agreement, and the debt has been resolved. (Tr. 22; AX B and C.)
SOR ¶ 1.k: delinquent medical  debt for $636.  In  Applicant’s answer to the SOR,
he stated that he was unaware of this debt and was not sure of its  origin. The March 2019
credit report reflects that it was referred for collection in February 2013, but it does not
identify the original creditor or the collection agency. (GX 3 at 12; Answer at 5.) Applicant
believes  that  this  debt  may  have  been  for  treatment  after  an  automobile  accident.  He
contacted the hospital where he was treated, but the hospital was unable to provide him
any information about the debt. (Tr. 23.) I have resolved this debt for Applicant, because
the SOR does not provide the specificity required by Directive ¶ E3.1.3. It does not provide
the name of the original creditor or the collection agency, making it virtually impossible
for him to investigate or resolve the debt.
SOR ¶ 1.l: telecommunications account referred for collection of  $595.  This
was incurred when Applicant failed to return cable equipment in 2014. (Tr. 48.) The debt
is reflected in the March 2019 credit report (GX 3 at 12) but not the November 2019 credit
report. (GX 4.) Applicant contacted the original creditor and the collection agency in an
effort to resolve the debt. The collection agency informed him that they had returned the
debt to the original creditor. He testified that he tried to contact the original creditor but
could not get beyond the telephone menus and talk to a “live person.” (Tr. 49.)
SOR  ¶  1.m:   debt  to   insurance  company   referred  for  collection  of  $260.
Applicant testified that this debt was incurred after an insured vehicle was totaled, but he
could not remember the specific circumstances that caused this delinquent debt. (Tr. 51.).
It was referred for collection in November 2017. (GX 3 at 12.) He paid it in February 2020.
(Answer at 16; AX D.)
Applicant has enrolled in a financial management course through his church. (AX
H.) He now has a budget, which reflects his net monthly income of $3,920, expenses of
$3,275, projected student-loan payments of $200 per month, payments on a credit-union
loan of $105 per month, and a net monthly remainder of $340. (AX G.)
Applicant’s  branch chief for the past five years, a retired Army  non-commissioned
officer,   testified  that  he  has  watched  Applicant  mature   over  the  years  into  a  reliable,
dependable,  and   trustworthy  electronic  technician.  (Tr.  72-73.)  One  of  Applicant’s  co-
workers  for  the  past   three  years,  a   former   Army  Green  Beret,  submitted  a  statement
attesting  to   Applicant’s  growth  in   his  personal  and  professional   life.  He   considers
Applicant a  loyal, reliable, talented employee, with a unique ability to solve  problems with
an “outside-the-box” approach. (AX F.)
