Applicant is a 40-year-old  executive  assistant for a  defense  contractor who seeks
eligibility to hold a public trust position. The allegations covered in  SOR ¶¶  1.a through
1.p   and   admitted  by   Applicant  are  incorporated  and   adopted  as  relevant  and   material
findings. Additional findings follow.
Background
Applicant never married  and  has no children.  (GE  1)  Applicant attended  college
between 2005  and  2010 and earned a bachelor’s degree in  May 2010. (GE 1 and  AE B;
Tr.   42,   60)   She  started  graduate  school   classes  in   2011,  but  had   to  withdraw  from
school  in  2012 due  to  her  increased domestic responsibilities and  limited finances. (Tr.
43)  Applicant reported no military service.  (GE 1  and AE B)
Since  January  2019,  Applicant  has  been  employed  by  her  current  employer.

contractors in various capacities. (GE 1)  From June 2017 to January 2019, she worked
as  an  unpaid  volunteer  for  a  non-defense  employer  while  living  with  her  mother  and

grandmother. (GE 1; Tr. 40-41)
Applicant’s finances
Between  2016  and  2019,  Applicant  accumulated  student  loan  and  other
delinquent  debts  exceeding  $63,000.  She  attributed  these  debts  to  being  out  of  work
while helping her ill mother and ailing grandmother. She has since addressed all of the
debts  (save  for  a  medical  debt  for  $282  covered  by  SOR  ¶  1.k).  Reportedly,  SOR
