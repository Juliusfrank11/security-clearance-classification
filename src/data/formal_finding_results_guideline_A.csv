"In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the sole allegation under Guideline
A  (SOR  ¶  1.a)  with  an  explanation,  and,  by  reference,  the  cross-allegation  under
Guideline  E  (SOR  ¶  2.a).  He  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  2.b  –  2.g,  also  with  explanations.  I
incorporate  his admissions  and  explanations  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough
and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  the  record  evidence  submitted,  I  make  the
following  additional  findings  of  fact.  (I  also  incorporate  my  factual  findings  about  the
Government’s evidence, discussed above.)
Applicant is 43 years old. He graduated from high school in 1994. (Tr. 147; GE 1)
He has never married but has a longtime cohabitant. They have three children, ages 17,
15, and 13. (Tr. 126-127) He previously worked for a government contractor for several
years,  until  2001,  when  he  was  injured  on  the  job.  He  received  workmen’s
compensation, and he was unemployed from September 2001 to October 2013. During
that  time  he  was  a  “stay-at-home  dad”  raising  his  children.  (GE  1  at  13;  Tr.  129-131,
141)  Applicant  returned  to  the  workforce  in  October  2013,  and  has  worked  for  his
current employer, a defense contractor, since October 2014. He has not held a security
clearance before. (Tr. 9-10, 48, 131-133, GE 1)
Guideline E
In  March 1991, Applicant  was  arrested and charged  with  breaking  and  entering
after he and some high school friends broke into an office at a mall. (SOR ¶ 2.c). They
initially left the scene, but were arrested when they returned a short time later. He was
found guilty in juvenile court, placed on probation, and fined. He attended several weeks
of counseling and a youth offender program. (GE 3 at 2; GE 5 at “p. 60”; Tr. 66-67)
In  June  1993,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  carrying  a  concealed
weapon after he was found in possession of a knife while at a mall with friends. (SOR ¶
2.d)  He  was  found  guilty  in  juvenile  court  and  ordered  to  perform  community  service.
(GE 3 at 2; GE 5 at “p. 60”; Tr. 68-70)
In November 1993, Applicant was involved in an altercation with numerous other
students  at  his  high  school.  The  altercation  was  racially  motivated.  Though  Applicant
claimed  self-defense,  others  accused  him  of  having  a  weapon  and  pressed  charges.
(GE  3  at  2-3)  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  assault  and  battery  and
brandishing  a  firearm.  (SOR  ¶  2.e)  In  juvenile  court,  he  pleaded  not  guilty,  but  court
records  state  that  evidence  was  sufficient  to  convict.  There  is  no  indication  that  a
conviction was entered, and in December 1994, the charges were dismissed. (GE 5 at
“p. 60”; Tr. 70-71)
In March 1994, Applicant was at a party with friends when he had an altercation
with  an  interracial  couple.  The  police  were  called  and  Applicant  was  questioned  and
released. The couple then pressed charges. When the police came to Applicant’s home,
they  searched  it  and  found  a  sawed-off  shotgun.  He  was  arrested  and  charged  with
assault  and  battery,  and  felony  possession  of  a  sawed-off  shotgun.  (SOR  ¶  2.f)  He
testified that the weapon was his father’s but that he had altered it. In December 1994,
he was convicted on the felony weapon charge and was later sentenced to six years in
jail, all suspended, and six years of probation. He was released from probation in 1999.
(GE 1; GE 3 at 3; GE 4; Tr. 71-75, 148-149)
In  August  1994,  Applicant  and  several  friends  vandalized  a  local  black  church,
which the record indicates was located in a white neighborhood. He spray-painted racial
and religious slurs on the church, such as “white power,” the phrase “n - - - - - s out,”
(the  phrase  includes  the  racial  epithet  commonly  known  as  “the  N  word”),  a  “burning
cross,” and a reference to Adolph Hitler and the “SS” (GE 2 at 4; GE 5 at “p. 45”; Tr. 71-
76) Applicant was arrested and charged with felony willful and malicious defacement of
church property. In January 1995, he was convicted and sentenced to five years in jail,
three years suspended, and ten years of probation. (SOR ¶ 2.g). (GE 1, GE 4, GE 5) He
served ten months in jail and paid a $2,000 fine. He was released from probation early,
in  October  1999.  (GE  5  at  “p.  38”;  Tr.  150).  At  hearing,  though  he  accepted
responsibility for what he did, Applicant denied knowing at the time that it was a black
church. He acknowledged “painting some pretty offensive stuff on it” and that “it wasn’t
that funny.” (Tr. 76)
Applicant allegedly used marijuana, with varying frequency, from 1986 until 2013.
(SOR  ¶  1.a)  More  specifically,  he  tried  marijuana  once  in  1986,  when  he  was  10,
smoked  it  daily  from  about  1990  to  1995,  and  again  “on  and  off”  between  November
2005  and  August  2013.  (GE  1  at  25;  GE  3  at  4;  Tr.  134,  138-140)  He  also
acknowledged  that  he  procured  the  marijuana  by  purchasing  it.  He  resumed  using
marijuana in 2005 when he joined a band. (Tr. 136-140)
Neither Applicant nor his cohabitant use marijuana. However, he acknowledged
that  he  is  around  marijuana  on  a  weekly  basis,  when  he  is  with  other  band  members
who use it. He said his friends know better than to offer it to him. He denied any other
illegal  drug  use  since  2013.  He  said  he  does  not  intend  to  use  marijuana  until  it  is
legalized.  (Tr.  134-138)  He  acknowledged  that  marijuana  is  illegal  under  Federal  law
and under the law of his home state. He is subject to drug testing at work. (Tr. 142-143)
Guideline A
According  to  the  Government’s  evidence,  Group  X  was  founded  in  the  early
1970s. Among its founders was Dr. P. (GE 9 at 16, 18; Tr. 82, 124) Both GE 7 and GE
8, newsletters published by Group X in 1990 and 1994, contain “Commentary” from Dr.
P  that  can  generally  be  described  as  racist,  anti-Semitic,  and  homophobic.  The
commentary also advocates racial and religious genocide. (GE 8 at 5) Applicant was not
a  member  of  Group  X  when  those  newsletters  were  published.  He  denied  that  Group
X’s views, as expressed in GE 7 and GE 8 were the views of Group X when he was a
member years later. (Tr. 112)
In  March  2000,  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  an  agent  of  the  Defense  Security
Service as part of what was probably a security clearance investigation. (GE 3; Tr. 59-
60, 86) In a portion of his sworn statement, Applicant said he had been a self-described
“skinhead”  since  1991.  As  such,  he  described  his  views  concerning  white  supremacy
and white separatism as follows:
I  believe  that  the  white  race  is  the  most  evolved  race  and  should  be
preserved. Any further evolution of the white race should occur within the
white  gene  pool  only.  I  believe  that  white  people  should  not  socialize  or
breed  with  other  races.  I  believe  that  other  races  and  Jewish  people
should  exist,  but  within  their  own  specified  territory.  I  don’t  like  people  of
other races being in a position of authority to me. I don’t think they should
be in any positions of power or authority. (GE 3 at 5; Tr. 169-70)
Applicant  said  in  the  statement  that  he  regularly  used  the  internet  to  read  and
learn  about  “national  socialist  views.”  He  printed  national  socialist  literature  and
distributed it. He acknowledged wearing clothes and having tattoos that symbolized his
beliefs, including “the German Cross, the Swastika, the Triskellon (symbol of the South
African resistance), 88 (symbol of skinhead culture), and the confederate flag.” (GE 3 at
6)
Applicant acknowledged at hearing that he had most of those tattoos at the time,
but  he  has  since  had  all  but  one  of  them  covered  up  with  other tattoos.  He  still  has a
tattoo  of  the  number  “88”  on  the  back  of  his  neck,  under  his  ponytail.  He  said  it
symbolized  “skinhead culture.  He  said  he has  not  decided  how  to cover up  that  tattoo
(with another one). (Tr. 62-65, 162-163)
In  the  March  2000  statement,  Applicant  disavowed  the  use  of  violence  to
“enforce  my  beliefs,”  or  to  change  the  fact  that  “other  races”  were  “in  positions  of
power.” He said, “I plan to use education as opposed to violence to spread my message
to  others.”  (GE  3  at  6)  He  referenced  his  prior  criminal  conduct  (“vandalism  and
fighting”)  and  noted  that  he  engaged  in  those  activities  when  he  was  “younger  and
immature.”  He  said,  “I  am  not  a  violent  person  and  do  not  want  to  use  violence  as  a
means to accomplish any of my goals.” (GE 3 at 6)
In the sworn statement, Applicant also stated that “I am not in any formal group
or  organization  of  skin  heads.  I  practice  this  belief  system  with  my  girlfriend  and  my
friends.”  (GE  3  at  6;  Tr.  65)  At  his  hearing,  Applicant  confirmed  that  he  was  not  a
member  of  Group  X  when  he  made  his  sworn  statement  to  the  DSS  Agent.  (GE  2).
However,  he  also  acknowledged  that  he  had  been  contemplating  joining  the  group  at
the time, and testified that he deliberately waited to join Group X until after he made the
statement  to  the  DSS  agent  so  he  would  not  have  to  declare  his  membership  in  the
group during his background interview. (Tr. 83, 86-87, 145-146)
So I waited a couple of weeks after the -- until after the interview before I
sent in my application for membership. And I did that intentionally so that
when  I  did  the  interview,  I  wouldn’t  have  to  say  I  was  a  member  of
anything, and I wouldn’t be lying. (Tr. 83)
Dr.  P  died  in  2002.  According  to  Group  X’s  website,  this  led  eventually  to  a
“leadership vacuum” and some tension about the organization’s future direction. (GE 9
at 18-19) Applicant is not named in GE 9, but he confirmed the group’s leadership void
and resulting “chaos” after Dr. P’s death. (Tr. 88)
Applicant said between 2000 and 2009, he went to group meetings about once or
twice  a  year,  at  Group  X’s  meeting  hall,  in  a  neighboring  state.  He  acknowledged
engaging in recruiting efforts, but stopped doing so in about 2007 or 2008. (Tr. 90) He
denied attempting to recruit people at work. (Tr. 91)
Applicant  testified  that  as  of  about  2004,  he  no  longer  considered  himself  a
“skinhead.” He considered those individuals “pretty much just a bunch of drunken thugs”
who did not have a “professional attitude” about anything. He decided to grow his hair
out and to be more professional. (Tr. 60-61, 159-161)
Applicant also testified “philosophically I was – I left it [Group X] in 2009.” (Tr. 54,
87, 151) However, “I still found some validity in some of their philosophical beliefs.” (Tr.
88) For a period of time, he and his cohabitant (whom he had recruited into the group)
had little to no involvement with  the organization. (“When I left it, I left it, we left it,” he
said.)(Tr. 129)
In 2012, Applicant was asked by other Group X leaders, whom he knew, to be a
member  of  the  board.  This  led  him  to  change  his  mind,  and  he  re-engaged.  (Tr. 129)
Group X was also a corporation chartered in State 1, where Applicant lives. (Tr. 87-89,
151-152)  In  February  2012,  Applicant  filed  an  annual  report  with  State  1’s  regulatory
authorities  on  behalf  of  Group  X,  in  his  capacity  as  a  director  and  officer.  His  title  is
listed as Vice-President and Treasurer. Applicant is listed on the filing documents as the
State  1  Registered  Agent,  and  his  home  address  is  listed  as  the  office  address  for
Group X. His name is typed into the signature block on the 2012 Annual Report. (GE 6
at  3)  Group  X’s  registered  address  is  also  the  home  address  Applicant  gave  on  his
SCA, GE 1.
Applicant testified that, as an officer and director of Group X, he attended Group
X  board  meetings  three  or  four  times  a  year.  He  testified  that,  despite  being  listed  on
GE  6  as  the  treasurer  for  several  years,  he  had  no  knowledge  of  Group  X’s  financial
information. (Tr. 94)
In his December 2014 SCA (GE 1) Applicant disclosed that in about April 2014,
he  and  two  other  board  members  of  what  he  called  “a  not  for  profit  corporation”  were
sued  in  State  1  court.  Among  the  people  Applicant  names  in  GE  1  are  the  treasurer
(Ms.  C)  and  the  president of  Group  X  (Mr.  G),  as  identified  in  the  corporate filing  with
State 1. (GE 6 at 3; Tr. 118-119)
Mr. G is identified on Group X’s website as its chairman at the time. (GE 9 at 19)
In  late  2014,  Mr.  G  resigned  as  chairman,  and  was  replaced  by  Mr.  W,  the  same
individual who filed the change of address and change of registered agent form with the
State 1 agency in January 2015. (GE 6; GE 9 at 19)
Applicant  did  not  identify  Group  X  on  his  December  2014  SCA  when  he
disclosed the lawsuit, though he did list several individuals who were then, or who had
previously been, Group X members. (GE 1 at 35; Tr. 118-119) There are no documents
from  that  lawsuit  in  the  record  evidence  in  this  case  to  definitively  identify  the  parties
involved.
Applicant acknowledged that, being an officer and director of Group X, he was a
group  leader,  and  represented  the  organization’s  beliefs.  (Tr.  94)  He  confirmed  in  his
testimony  that  Group  X’s  beliefs,  as  detailed  in  GE  9,  the  2018  website  excerpt,  were
their beliefs when Applicant was a member of the Group. (Tr. 99-100)
Applicant also stated that he knew, from his prior association with Group X, that
“illegal activity  was frowned upon,” and “there wasn’t going to be anything in here that
said  ‘go  out and  violate  people’s  rights,  or overthrow  the  government,  or do  this or do
that.’  I  already  knew  that  wasn’t  in  there,  at  least  when  I  was  involved.”  (Tr.  110)
Applicant  testified  that  “it  was  a  very  well  understood  policy  of  [Group  X]  that  illegal
activity would get you kicked out . . . and discussion of it, planning of it, talking about it,
was cause for immediate dismissal.” (Tr. 55, 171-172; Answer) In the 1990 newsletter,
Dr. P made a similar statement: “We have always, as a matter of policy, avoided illegal
acts  or  other  activity  which  might  bring  us  into  conflict  with  the  government’s  law
enforcement apparatus. . . . in the future we may not be able to avoid such conflict. . . .”
(GE 7 at 3-4)
Applicant testified that during a board meeting conducted by teleconference,
[Applicant] had been pressuring the chairman, for some years, to change
the direction of [the group], to stop being adversarial towards other people,
other  races.  And  if  we  really  wanted  to  preserve  our  people  and  our
culture, that we should really learn to work with people rather than trying to
take on the world, that made no sense. And it took several years of finally
getting them to agree. We actually changed the bylaws of [the group]. We
took  a  vote  on  it,  by  phone.  And  I  believe  as  soon  as  the  bylaws  were
changed,  that  is when  the  lawsuit  kicked off.  ” (Tr. 121-122;  see  also  Tr.
124-125, 170-171)
Applicant  testified  that  he  submitted  a  letter  of  resignation  and  resigned  from
Group X and its board in March 2014. That letter is not in evidence. During the lawsuit,
he learned that he was still listed as the registered agent for Group X, and was still an
officer and a director. He testified that in January 2015, Applicant went on the website of
the  State  1  regulatory  authority  and  removed  his  name  from  Group  X’s  registration
papers. (Tr. 117, 152-157; GE 6) Applicant denied that the fact that he had submitted an
SCA  in  December  2014  had  anything  to  do  with  the  timing  of  his  actions.  (Tr.  158)
Annual  reports  filed  by  Group  X  in  later  years  (2016-2018)  with  State  1  do  not  list
Applicant as an officer or director and do not list his home address as Group X’s office
of record in State 1. (GE 6)
Applicant  denied  ever  having  a  discussion  with  other  Group  X  members  about
issues  relating  to  sedition  or  overthrowing  the  United  States  Government.  (Tr.  55)
Applicant  is  a  United  States  citizen.  He  testified  that  he  has  given  no  thought  to
renouncing his U.S. citizenship for that of another country. (Tr. 58)
Applicant’s SCA contains several questions about his “Association Record.” (GE
1  at  Section  29)  Questions  asked  include:  a)  whether  Applicant  had  knowingly  or
intentionally ever been a member of an organization “dedicated to the use of violence or
force to overthrow the United States Government and which engaged in activities to that
end  .  .  .”;  and  b)  whether  he  had  ever  been  a  member  of  an  organization  “that
advocates  or  practices  commission  of  acts  of  violence  or  force  to  discourage  others
from exercising their rights under the U.S. Constitution or any state of the United States
with  the  specific  intent  to  further  such  action.”  Applicant  answered  “No”  to  both
questions,  and  to  all  others  under  Section  29.  The  Government  did  not  allege  in  the
SOR that these answers were deliberately false. (Tr. 186-187)
GE  9,  excerpted  from  the  Group  X  website,  details  its  white  supremacist  and
separatist views, under a subheading, “Building a New White World.” The group’s stated
goals include  “White  Living  Space,” “An  Aryan  Society,”  “A  Responsible  Government,”
“A  New  Educational  System,”  and  “An  Economic  Policy  Based  on  Racial  Principles.”
(GE 9)
Under the  “Responsible  Government” subheading,  GE  9  states  that  due  to  “the
growth  of  mass  democracy,”  including  increased  voting  enfranchisement  of  “non-
Whites” and the “control over the media” by Jews, “the U.S. government was gradually
transformed  into  the  malignant  monster  it  is  today:  the  single  most  dangerous  and
destructive enemy our race has ever known.” (GE 9 at 7)
Applicant  denied  that  through  this  statement,  or  otherwise,  Group  X  advocated
sedition against the United States Government, or sought to “overthrow” it, by violence
or other means. (Tr. 122-124) He testified,
[Y]ou  are  recognizing  that  apparently  there are  policies,  and programs  in
place  that are  dangerous  to  your people  and  you  have  to  change  that.  It
doesn’t say anything about violating the law or doing anything like that. . . I
mean,  the  government  can  be  considered  a  threat  to  many  things,  life
liberty, pursuit of happiness, depending on, you know, how you look at it.
So  I  would  say  that  I  don’t  think  declaring  it  an  enemy  in,  like,  a  military
term.  Maybe  on  a  philosophical  term.  I  mean,  that  it  how  it  reads  to  me.
(Tr. 100-101) (discussing GE 9))
Applicant  acknowledged  that  when  he  joined  Group  X,  the  group  believed  “that
the government was working against the interest of white people and culture, definitely
believed  that,  they  definitely  believed  that  .  .  .  and  so  did  I  .  .  .  .”  (Tr.  122)  Applicant
denied that Group X advocated going out and stopping “other people from doing what
they have a constitutional right to do.” (Tr. 103) He also said, “I can’t speak for what it
stands for now.” (Tr. 103)
Applicant testified that if he had been aware that Group X espoused a philosophy
of violence or overthrow of the government, he would “absolutely not” have joined it. (Tr.
170) He testified that he has not been a member of Group X, and has not attended any
meetings  for  several  years.  (Tr.  56,  157)  Applicant  denied  any  further  contact  with
anyone  he  knew  to  be  a  member of  Group  X.  Occasionally,  he  gets  phone  calls  from
the former chairman of Group X, but does not believe the individual remains a member.
(Tr. 57, 125-126)
Applicant testified that he has never had any issues with coworkers at his current
job. His coworkers come from a variety of backgrounds, races, and creeds. (Tr. 48, 133;
Answer) He testified that, the day before the hearing, he told some of his coworkers, of
other races, that “I used to be a skinhead, I used to be a white supremacist.”  (Tr. 134)
This testimony is uncorroborated.
Applicant denied that he considers himself to be a ”skinhead” anymore. (Tr. 160)
He also testified that he no longer considers himself to be a white supremacist; indeed,
he  testified  that  he  “can’t  be”  one,  because  he  learned  in  about  2012  that  one  of  his
grandparents, who he had never met, was a Native American. (Tr. 161-162)
When  asked  why  his  prior  membership  in  Group  X  should  no  longer  be
considered a security concern, Applicant said,
Well,  I’m  not  a  member.  I  don’t  believe,  or  ascribe  to  those  views.  .  .  .  I
don’t  know  what  else  to  say.  I  don’t  follow  any  of  that  philosophy,  or
anything like that, any form of socialism or collectivism, or any of that. (Tr.
168)
Applicant acknowledged his prior criminal record, has accepted responsibility for
his actions, and said he has paid the price. He said he has matured and has not been
“in  trouble”  for  a  long  time.  (Tr.  168;  SOR  Answer)  To  show  that  he  is  considered
rehabilitated by authorities, he testified that he has a concealed handgun permit in his
home state. He testified that he successfully applied with the federal Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco,  and  Firearms  (ATF)  for  a  permit  to  build  a  suppressor  for  his  handgun.  He
testified  that  he  has  been  a  licensed  armed  security  officer  in  his  home  state  since
2009.  These  assertions  are  undocumented.  He  has  not  committed  any  other  crimes
beyond  those  alleged.  He  has  had  his  voting  rights  restored.  (Tr.  49-51,  144-145)
Applicant  attested  to  his  patriotism  and  to  the  valuable  service  he  provides  to  the
country and to the U.S. military at work. (Tr. 166)
Applicant  provided  no  documents  in  support  of  his  case,  and  he  offered  no
character  testimony,  documented  or  otherwise.  Thus,  his  own  testimony  is  in  all
respects uncorroborated by other sources.

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, she admitted the factual allegation in SOR ¶ 1.a
but denied that there was any reason to question her allegiance to the United States. At
the hearing,  Department  Counsel moved  to withdraw the  Guideline  A  allegation, and  I
granted the motion. (Tr. 8.)
Applicant  admitted  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  2.b  and  2.c.  She  denied  the
allegations in SOR ¶¶ 2.a, 2.d, and 2.e. Her admissions in her answer and at the hearing
are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 34-year-old Russian linguist hired by a defense contractor in January
2018.  She  has  never  held  a  security  clearance.  Her  employment  is  contingent  on  her
ability to obtain a security clearance.
While  attending  college  in  Russia,  Applicant  applied  for  a  program  that  offered
positions abroad for students or recent graduates. She testified that she lived in a very
cold region in Siberia, found it boring, and wanted to explore other opportunities. She was
accepted in the program and came to the United States in June 2009 on a work visa. She
worked as an office manager from June 2009 until March 2010.
Applicant testified that she chose to come to the United States because she spoke
English but did not speak the languages of other countries involved in the program. She
was required to learn English in the Russian elementary school and high school, and she
enrolled in additional English classes in college. (Tr. 42-43.) She also testified that the
United  States  was  her  first  choice  for  a  position  abroad,  because  when  she  watched
movies  growing up,  the  United  States  seemed  like  a  “great  place  to  be.”  (Tr.  43.) She
testified that she has become immersed in American life and culture, to the extent that
she now thinks in English instead of Russian. (Tr. 17.)
Applicant married a U.S. citizen in September 2010 and became a permanent U.S.
resident. She became a U.S. citizen in August 2014. (GX 3 at 15.) She has never formally
renounced  her  Russian  citizenship,  but  she allowed  her  Russian  passport to  expire  in
January 2014.
Applicant  and  her  husband  separated  in  December  2015  and  divorced  in  May
2018. (Tr. 30.) She testified that they divorced because her husband was dominated by
his  mother  and  preferred  to  stay  home  and  watch  television  instead  of  going  out  and
“doing  things.”  (Tr.  29-30.)  They  do  not  have  much  contact  with  each  other,  but  they
maintain an amicable relationship when they talk. (Tr.17.) They have no children.
Applicant’s  ex-husband  served  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  Marine Corps  for four
years and has been employed by DOD for 24 years. Her ex-husband submitted a letter
supporting her application for a security clearance. In his letter he states, “During her time
in the United States of America, she developed a deep love for this country. I was at her
citizenship ceremony; it was easy to see the pride and emotion of that day.”
In May 2009, Applicant obtained  the  equivalent of a  master’s degree  in taxation
from the Siberian State Aerospace University in Russia. She received a bachelor’s degree
from  a  U.S.  university  in  May  2017  and  has  been  taking  post-graduate  courses  since
September  2017.  She  obtained  a  graduate  certificate  in  cyber  security  from  a  U.S.
university in August 2018. (Tr. 19; GX 3 at 13.)
The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant’s  father,  mother,  and  brother  are  citizens  and
residents of Russia. (SOR ¶¶ 2.a-2.c) It also alleges that her father formerly served as a
“security inspector” and “district inspector” for the Russian government (SOR ¶¶ 2.d), and
that he had provided Applicant with financial assistance of about $1,900 per month for a
total of about $53,000 since December 2015 (SOR ¶ 2.e).
Applicant’s mother lives in an apartment that she owns, worth about $16,130. Her
father,  now deceased,  owned  an  apartment  that  was  also  worth  about  $16,130  and  a
dacha (vacation house) worth about $5,645. Applicant and her brother expect to inherit
their parents’ property, but she intends to give her share to her brother, because she has
no  intention  of  living  in  Russia.  (Tr.  37;  GX  3  at  11.)  During  her  counterintelligence
screening  interview,  she  commented,  “Russia  is  a  wonderful  country  with  a  horrible
government.” (GX 3 at 3.)
Applicant’s  father  passed  away  in  July  2018.  (AX  A.)  He  had  worked  for  the
Russian government from 1980 to1995, and he received a pension for his service. (GX 3
at 16.) He provided financial assistance to Applicant in the amounts alleged in the SOR
so  that she  could obtain her bachelor’s degree. Applicant’s relationship with  her father
was strained  before his death  because  he  was involved  with  a  woman  who  resented  his
family.  She  received  about $5,000  from  her father’s estate  when  he  passed  away. She
did not  receive  any  benefits  from  the  Russian  government for her father’s former  service.
(Tr. 33-34.)
In  Applicant’s  SCA,  she  stated  that  she  has  daily  telephone  contact  with  her
mother. Her mother has been employed for about 15 years by a sportsmanship institute
that  trains  and  educates  athletes.  (Tr.  35.)  She  is  not  affiliated  with  the  Russian
government, military security, defense industry, or intelligence service. (GX 1 at 28.) In
her answer to the SOR, she stated that she has “very little” verbal contact with her mother,
about five times a year. However, at the hearing, she testified that they text “every week,
two times a week, sometimes every day of the week depending on [her] mom’s mood and
situation.” (Tr. 21.)
In  Applicant’s  SCA,  she  stated  that  she  had  weekly  telephone  contact  with  her
brother. Her brother is employed by as an electrical engineer for a construction company.
(Tr. 36.) He has no affiliation with the Russian government, military, security,  defense-
related  industry,  or  intelligence  service.  (GX  1  at  30-31.)  In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the
SOR, she stated that she has little contact with her brother and has not seen him for about
five years. However, at the hearing, she testified that she and her brother send texts every
two or three months and talk on the telephone once every two or three months. (Tr. 21.)
Applicant’s  SCA  reflects  that  she  visited  her  family  in  Russia  in  October  2011,
December 2013, and March 2015. (GX 1 at 36-41.) Since 2016, she has been sending
her mother $100 for Christmas or her birthday. (GX 3 at 10.) At the hearing, she testified
that she and her mother vacationed together in Europe in November 2019, but she has
not seen her brother since she went to Russia in 2015. (Tr. 22-23.)
Applicant  testified  that  her  brother  approves  of  her  decision  to  become  a  U.S.
citizen  and  live  in  the  United  States.  However,  her  mother  disapproves  because  she
believes that a daughter should stay at home and support her parents. (Tr. 25.)
Applicant was unemployed and supported by her husband during their marriage,
except for employment as a waitress in a bar from December 2011 to January 2012. She
was self-employed as an artist from January to December 2017, when she was offered a
position as a Russian linguist, contingent on obtaining a security clearance.
In July 2018, Applicant accepted an invitation from an acquaintance to invest in a
used-car dealership. She borrowed money from her credit union and used credit cards to
invest about $100,000 in a 50% interest in the business. She owes about $32,000 on the
loan. She lived in a home owned by her husband during their marriage, but she currently
does not own a home or any other investment interests. (Tr. 39.)
Applicant testified that the used-car business is doing well in spite of COVID-19.
Last year, she earned about $45,000. She actively works in the business six days a week,
selling cars, dealing with banks, dealing with clients, and every aspect of the business.
(Tr. 20-21, 40.) If she is hired as a linguist for one year, she will retain her financial interest
in the business. If her application for a clearance is denied, she will stay in the United
States and sell cars. (Tr. 41.)
A  business  owner,  who  is also  an  ordained  minister,  trusts and  respects Applicant.
He describes her as dedicated, hardworking,  and  a  “woman  of  refreshing  candor.”  (AX  E
at 2.) Two  longtime  friends admire  her for her candor, honesty, reliability, and  kindness.
(AX E at 3, 4.)
I  have  taken  administrative  notice  that  Russia  is  one  of  the  top  three  most
aggressive  collectors of  economic information  and  technological  intelligence from  U.S.
sources. Russia uses cyber operations as an instrument of intelligence collection, using
sophisticated  and  large-scale  hacking  to  collect  sensitive  information,  influence  the
political process in the United States, and undermine Euro-Atlantic unity.
Russia also uses commercial and academic enterprises that interact with the West,
recruitment  of  Russian  immigrants  with  advanced  technical  skills,  and  penetration  of
public and private enterprises by Russian intelligence agents to obtain sensitive technical
information.  The  areas  of  highest  interest  include  alternative  energy,  biotechnology,
defense technology, environmental protection, high-end manufacturing, and information
and  communications  technology.  Russian  agents  have  been  involved  in  intrusions
affecting  U.S.  citizens,  corporate  entities,  international  organizations,  and  political
organizations in the United States.
Significant  human-rights  issues  in  Russia  include  extrajudicial  killings;  enforced
disappearance;  torture,  including  punitive  psychiatric  incarceration;  harsh  prison
conditions;  arbitrary  arrest  and  detention;  and  lack  of  judicial  independence.  The
Department of State has identified Moscow as a high-threat location for terrorist activity
directed at official U.S. Government interests.

"Applicant  is  a  38-year-old  employee  of  a  staffing  company  that  provides
employees to a defense contractor. This is his first application for a security clearance.
He earned a bachelor’s degree in 2009. He has never married, and he has no children.
(Transcript (Tr.) at 14-18, 51-52; GE 1)
In 2009, Applicant uploaded his resume on a job-search website. He received an
email from  what  he  thought  was  a  financial  consulting  company.  He  responded  and a
telephonic interview was arranged. During the telephonic discussion, the caller (Ms. C)
asked Applicant to set up a limited liability company (LLC) and open a bank account in
the  LLC’s  name.  Ms.  C  or  someone  she  represented  would  deposit  $15,000  into  the
bank  account.  Applicant  would  keep  $500,  withdraw  the  rest,  and  send  it  by  Western
Union to an unidentified location. Applicant would also receive an additional $2,000 per
month.  Ms.  C  told  him  to  withdraw  the  money  from  different  branches  and  send  the
money through different Western Union locations. (Tr. at 19-53; Applicant’s response to
SOR; GE 2)
When he initially responded to the email, Applicant thought it was legitimate. By
the time he agreed to the plan, he realized it was an illegal money laundering scheme.
He did not know if the money was going to terrorists, a drug cartel, organized crime, or
some other illegal entity, and he did not care. He admitted that he was greedy and did
not  care  who  benefitted  from  the  scheme.  (Tr.  at  21-24,  53;  Applicant’s  response  to
SOR; GE 2)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
August 2020. He answered “No” to a question under Section 29 that asked, “Have you
EVER associated with anyone involved in activities to further terrorism?” (GE 1)
Applicant was interviewed for his background investigation on February 23, 2021,
and again on February 26, 2021. He was asked if he conducted any wire transfers. He
discussed  his  telephone  conversation  with  Ms.  C.  He  described  the  wire  transfers  as
part of a legitimate business venture, when he knew it was not. After being confronted
by  the  investigator  with  inconsistencies,  Applicant  admitted  that  he  had  attempted  to
conceal the actual nature of his conversation with Ms. C. He admitted to the investigator
that  he  quickly  realized  that  it  was  not  a  legitimate  business  venture,  but  rather  an
unscrupulous  or  illegal  money  wiring  scheme.  He  told  the  investigator  that  he  did  not
have concrete proof, but he thought the money was going to ISIS. He admitted that his
actions were solely motivated by greed. (Tr. at 50; AE 2)
Applicant  told  the  investigator  that  he  received  four  deposits  of  $15,000  and
transferred $14,500 three times. When he went to the bank to withdraw the money the
fourth time, he was told by the bank that the account had been frozen due to suspicious
activity.  He  told  the  bank  manager  that  he  was  an  innocent  victim  of  the  scheme.  He
followed the manager’s advice and filed a false police report in which he claimed to be
an  innocent  victim  of  the  scheme.  He  attempted  to  call  Ms.  C  and  alert  her  to  the
further
developments,  but  her  phone  had  been  disconnected.  He  had  no
communications with her. (GE 2)
Applicant  told  the  background  investigator  in  February  2021  that  he  was
contacted by the U.S. Secret Service about three to four months after the last attempted
transfer.  He  stated  that  the  Secret  Service  told  him  that  the  funds  went  to  ISIS.  He
downplayed  his  involvement  in  the  scheme  to  the  Secret  Service,  and  he  was  never
charged with anything. (GE 2)
Applicant contacted the background investigator and indicated he had additional
information.  On  February  26,  2021,  he  told  the  investigator  that  the  Secret  Service
never  actually  told  him  the  money  went  to  ISIS,  and  that  the  only  thing  the  Secret
Service  would  confirm  is  that  the  money  went  to  an  Eastern  European  country.
Applicant reaffirmed that it was only a “gut” feeling that the money went to ISIS. (Ge 2)
The two interviews in February 2021 were summarized in reports of investigation
(ROIs).  Applicant  certified  the  ROIs  were  accurate  in  September  2022.  He  initially
testified that the Secret Service provided some indication to him that Ms. C represented
someone in “the Middle East and overseas.” (Tr. at 27) He later testified that the Secret
Service did not inform him that the money went to the Middle East, and that it went to an
Eastern  European  country.  He  stated  that  he  surmised  the  funds  might  have  gone  to
ISIS or the Middle East because the Secret Service was investigating the transactions.
He  stated  that  he  was  honest  to  the  bank  manager,  in  the  police  report,  and  to  the
Secret  Service.  He  also  stated  that  he  provided  the  Secret  Service  with  all  his  emails
and electronic communications with Ms. C. (Tr. at 29-40, 46-47, 52-53; GE 2)
Applicant  admitted,  without  explanation,  all  the  SOR  allegations.  His  testimony
was inconsistent with parts of the ROIs. He testified that he did not intentionally provide
false information on his SF 86 or during his background interview. He stated that he told
the  interviewer  that  the  information  that  Applicant  received  was  false,  and  the
interviewer misinterpreted  his statements  to mean  that  Applicant  intentionally  provided
false information. (Tr. at 47-51)

"Applicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his  current  employer  since  August  2021.  He  served  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  military
from  1993  until  he  was  honorably  discharged  in  1996.  He  then  served  in  the  miliary
reserve  until 2001.  He  attended college  for a  period  without earning a  degree, and  he
has  technical  certifications.  He  married  in  1997  and  divorced  in  2008.  He  married  his
current wife in 2011. He has an adult child from his first marriage and a minor child from
his second marriage.  (Transcript  (Tr.) at  61-65;  Applicant’s  response  to SOR;  GE 1-3;

Applicant’s first and  second  wives  were  both  born in the  foreign  country  (Country
A) where Applicant served  when  he  was in  the U.S. military. He lived  and  worked  in that
country from   1999   to  2021.   He   worked   for   defense   contractors from  2008   until he   lost
his  job   in  2021   as  a   consequence   of  the   actions  described   below.   (Tr.  at  61-65;
Applicant’s response  to SOR;  GE 1, 3; AE  I)
On  January  13,  2021,  a  U.S.  servicemember  reported  that  a  vehicle  on  the
military  installation  was  “displaying  Three  Percenter  and  QAnon  stickers  on  its  back
window.  Both  of  these  organizations/beliefs  have  been  linked  to  racially  motivated
violent  extremism  and  anti-government  actions.”  He  reported  that  he  first  noticed  the
“III” sticker on July 31, 2020, and the QAnon sticker on January 12, 2021. He stated that
he became aware of the III symbol because it was reported that an NFL player had the
symbol as a tattoo.1 (GE 3, 4 at 38-39)
The  military  criminal  investigation  division  did  a  criminal  and  insider-threat
analysis  and  determined  that  Applicant  was  not  suspected  of  committing  a  criminal
offense  or  being  an  insider  threat.  The  military  criminal  investigation  division  did  not
open an investigation, with the following rationale in an email dated January 15, 2021:
1. Social media was identified with no derogatory information noted.
2.  The   FBI   has   not   designated   the   3%ers  or  QAnon   as  a   terrorist
organization. Neither of them  are organized groups.
3.  The   3%er  sticker  alone   is  not  an   indicator  of  militia   affiliation   (see
attached   [FBI  Joint  Information   Bulletin   identified   in   above   Evidence
section] and below for more details.
4. While an  internet search for  three  percenters  (III%) and  QAnon  will  yield
several sites declaring  them  anti-government, militia  linked, or conspiracy
theorists;  as  with   any   group   there  are  those   who   take   matters  to   the
extreme  and  those  who  are more conservative  in their  voice. Displaying  a
sticker in support of  either group does not make an individual a  threat.
5.  At  this  time,  [Applicant]  is  not  suspected  of  committing  a  criminal
offense or insider threat. (GE 4 at 133)
An  administrative  investigation  was  ordered  and  completed  by  a  U.S.  military
field  grade  officer.  The  investigation  disclosed  that  the  vehicle  belonged  to  Applicant.
The  Three  Percenter  sticker  has  III  inside  a  circle  of  stars.  The  QAnon  sticker  is  a
stylized Q with a skull inside. Applicant bought the III sticker on eBay for $20 and placed
it on his vehicle in about June 2020. He bought the QAnon sticker on eBay for $10 and
placed it on his vehicle in about January 2021. He also bought a rubber bracelet with a
red Q. (Tr. at 66, 94-102, 110-111; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3, 4)
During  the  investigation,  Applicant  stated  that  he  placed  the  III  sticker  on  his
vehicle because he liked the design and to “tell that I defend the Constitution. That I am
a  patriot.  I  want  to  show  loyalty  as  a  patriotic  American.”  He  stated  that  his
understanding  of  the  Three  Percenters  was  that  “[i]t’s  like  Paul  Revere,  protecting  the

the
second amendment and the Constitution. Nothing to do with supremacy or extremism.”
(GE 3, 4)
Applicant  stated  that  he  placed  the  QAnon  sticker  on  his  vehicle  “to  raise
awareness. Spawn curious[ity] and let people research for themselves.”  He stated that
his understanding of QAnon was that it “is a group that conducts independent research.
It’s  not  an  ideology  nor  does  it  promote  violence  or  any  type  of  derogatory  actions.
[T]here  is  no  ill  har[m]  at  all.  It  is  suspected  of  being  very  close  to  [the]  Trump
administration.” (GE 3, 4 at 68-71)
The  investigator  interviewed  a  number  of  Applicant’s  work  colleagues.  He  was
described as “glad to be at work”; “low-key, calm, friendly, easy going guy”; “respectful
and  competent  in  his  duties”;  “very  quiet,  tends  to  keep  things  to  himself”;  and  an
“introvert.”  Most  of  his  colleagues  stated  that  they  had  not  seen  Applicant  display
images of either QAnon or Three Percenters, but most of his colleagues were unfamiliar
with QAnon or Three Percenters before the investigation. (GE 3, 4)
Applicant’s  supervisor  at  the  time,  a  retired  lieutenant  colonel,  provided  a
statement for the investigation. He had never heard Applicant discuss Three Percenters
or QAnon, and he never heard Applicant advocate any activities designed to overthrow
the  U.S.  Government  by  force.  He  stated  that  “[e]verybody  in  the  office  discussed  the
riots  on  Jan.  6.  We  were  all  horrified  by  the  incident  and  everyone  in  the  office
disagreed with what occurred, including [Applicant].” The supervisor was unfamiliar with
Three Percenters before Applicant’s stickers became an issue. He then looked them up
online. What he found indicated that the Three Percenters supported the Constitution by
non-violent means. He also looked up QAnon, and he felt  it was developed as a joke,
and  that  “[w]ho  else  would  come  up  with  a  story  line  that  the  world  is  controlled  by  a
small  cabal  of  children  eating  cannibals?  A  good  video  game  story,  but,  laughable.  I
don’t think anyone takes it seriously, but they enjoy following the antics of the few idiots
who do.” (GE 4 at 44)
One  employee  reported  to  the  investigator  that  he  and Applicant were  traveling
by  car  on  a  work  trip  when  he  noticed  Applicant  wearing  a  rubber  bracelet  with  a  red
letter Q. The employee asked him about the bracelet. Applicant stated it was an online
social media group that he followed. The employee reported that Applicant “described Q
as  what  [he]  would  consider  conspiracy  theories  about  shadow  government  and
pedophiles.” (Tr. at 77-79, 109; GE 4 at 91; AE L)
The  investigator  reported  that  there  was  no  indication  that  Applicant  had  ever
specifically  advocated  activities  designed  to  overthrow  the  U.S.  Government  by  force,
and that there was no indication that he supported the January 6, 2021 insurrection at
the Capitol. (GE 3, 4)
On  numerous  occasions,  Applicant  accessed  QAnon-affiliated  websites  and
social media using his government computer system. On June 29, 2020, and June 30,
2020,  using  his  government  email  account,  he  sent  emails  through  his  government
computer  system  to  three  other  federal  employees.  Attached  to  the  emails  were
documents  that  contained  QAnon-associated  rhetoric.  With  slight  variations,  the  two
attached  documents  had  the  same  message.  The  two-page  message  is  a  rambling
diatribe  that  appears  to  be  mainly  against  the  mainstream  media  with  open-ended
questions.  This  was  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  around  the  time  of  the
lockdown.  One  of  the  recipients  of  the  email  stated  that  he  was  not  alarmed  by  the
message  and  thought  the  message  may  have  referred  to  the  media’s  coverage  of
elections and the lockdown. Another recipient remembered receiving the email, but not
the  contents.  (Tr.  at  74-75,  84-85,  106-108;  Applicant’s  response  to  SOR;  GE  3,  4  at
100-119)
I did not understand much of the QAnon message (possibly because it is written
in a way to be intentionally obtuse), but I did not see anything calling for violence. One
section  stated,  “They  want  you  divided”  by  religion,  race,  sex,  political  affiliation,  and
class,  and  that  “When  you  are  divided,  and  angry,  and  controlled,  you  target  those
‘different’  from  you,  not  those  responsible  [controllers].”  (Emphasis  in  original)  The
message closed with:
“Free   thought”   is  a   philosophical   viewpoint   which   holds  that  positions
regarding   truth   should  be   formed   on  the   basis  of  logic,  reason,  and
empiricism, rather than authority, tradition, revelation, or dogma.
THIS   REPRESENTS   A   CLEAR   AND   PRESENT   DANGER  TO  THE
CONSTITUTIONAL  REPUBLIC  OF  THE  UNITED STATES  OF AMERICA.
(GE 4 at 113-119)
Applicant  followed   on   his  government   computer  system   numerous   QAnon
conspiracy  theories  and   messages  posted   on   Facebook.  A   post   from   May  7,  2020,
addressed  a  media conspiracy  directed  at the  2020  Presidential election, and  included:
“When  do  you  expend  ammunition?  For What  Purpose?  .  . . You  have  more power and
influence   than   you   realize.   Welcome   to   the   Revolution.  Q”  (Emphasis  in   original)
Another   post   on   October  31,  2020,  stated,  “Are  you   ready  to   finish   what  we   started?
‘Nothing  can  stop  what  is coming’ is not  just  a  catch-phrase.  Q”  A  third  post,  apparently
from November 2020, was a  political comic referencing  election fraud. (GE   3,  4)
Applicant  removed  the  bumper  stickers  in  January  2020,  after  emails  about
extremist  iconography  were  circulated  through  the  command.  (Tr.  at  69-70,  102-106;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3, 4)
Applicant’s access to classified information was suspended in March 2021. (GE
8,  9)  In  April  2021,  the  commander  of  the  U.S.  forces  in  Country  A  barred  Applicant
from entering any U.S. military installation in the country for ten years, with the following
rationale:
You   have   been   found   to   have   displayed   iconography   associated   with
extremist  ideologies  on   your  personally  owned   vehicle   and   in  the
workplace. Additionally, you  distributed  material associated  with  extremist
ideologies.   Your  actions   are  incompatible  with   the   interests   of  national
security,   reflect  negatively  on   the   image   of  the   U.S.   overseas,  and
adversely  affect  the   safety  and   morale   of  personnel  on   [U.S.   facilities  in
Country A].  (GE 6)
When  Applicant  was  barred  from  the  military  installations,  he  also  lost  his  job,
and he had to relocate back to the United States. He could not afford to move much of
his household goods, and he gave most  things  away.  He estimated  that he lost about
$100,000 through the process. (Tr. at 65, 88-82; GE 1, 2, 8)
Applicant adamantly denied that he is a Three Percenter, that he has ever been
a member of a militia or any similar group, or that he supports or is sympathetic to any
group  that  “advocates resistance  to  certain U.S.  federal government  policies.”  He  was
horrified  by  the  events  at  the  Capitol  on  January  6,  2021.  He  testified  that  he  did  not
understand  the full meaning of  the  III sticker, and that he came across  it on  eBay. He
liked  the  design,  and  he  thought  it  symbolized  patriotism,  support  for  the  Second
Amendment,  and  the  national  dialogue.  He  did  not  realize  it  was  associated  with
extremist groups. He added that he “thought they were Constitution defenders, kind of
like Paul Revere, people that stand up when there is like, the Government is not doing
exactly  as  the  Constitution  states.”  (Tr.  at  66-68,  82-83,  94-97,  113-122;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 2; AE A)
Applicant  testified  that  he  thought  “QAnon  is  basically  an  online  repository  of
information.  There’s  no  ideology.  A  person  can  go  in  and  access  it  and  do  their  own
research  on  it.”  He  stated  that  it  is  “kind  of like  a  big  puzzle,”  and “kind  of  like  the  Da
Vinci  Code.”  He  did  not  agree  with  everything  on  QAnon.  He  stated  that  he  sent  the
emails  “to  spawn  curiosity,  just  to  give  them  an  alternate  view  over  what  mainstream
media was saying on the TV in our office.” He stated that he thought the QAnon website
he  visited  would  have been  blocked if  it  was  a  problem, and he was  never notified by
any  IT  personnel  that  it  was  a  problem  before  the  investigation.  He  felt  the  QAnon
message  he  sent  was  anti-racist,  and  promoted  unification,  not  division.  He  now  feels
that  he  was  misinformed  about  QAnon.  He  does  not  intend  to  have  any  further
connection  to  QAnon.  (Tr.  at  71-77,  84-87,  97-102,  110-117,  122-132;  Applicant’s

Applicant  submitted  letters  and  documents  attesting  to  his  outstanding  job
performance  and  strong  moral  character.  He  is  praised  for  his  patriotism,  efficiency,
competence, dedication, work ethic, compassion, leadership, positive attitude, honesty,
trustworthiness,  and  loyalty  to  the  United  States.  They  recommend  him  for  a  security
clearance. (AE D, J)
The   colleagues  and   supervisor   at   his  former  job,   which   include   several  retired
U.S.   military  officers,   feel  that  Applicant  was   unfairly  treated   because   they  never  saw
any  indication   that  he   was   sympathetic   to   any  militia   or  extremist  group.   They   confirm
that  he   was  appalled   by  the   events  of  January   6,  2021,  and   he   condemned   the
insurrection.  They   believe   that   the   politically  charged   atmosphere  following   January  6,
2021,  contributed   to   the   command’s   decisions.   A   security  officer  at  the   command
expressed   the   same   view.  One   co-worker  wrote   in  his  statement  for  the   investigation,
“[Applicant]  has never represented  himself as  anything  other than  being  patriotic.  I  think
he got himself caught up in something he didn’t know what he was getting into.” (Tr. at
