"Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  allegations  except  SOR  ¶  3.a,  which  he  denied.
Applicant’s admissions are incorporated in my factual findings.
Applicant  is 43  years old.  He  is a  Moroccan-born  citizen  who  immigrated  to  the
United  States  in  2006.  He  became  a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen  and  was  issued  a  U.S.
passport  in  June  2011.  As  of  the  date  of the  hearing,  he  was  single  and did  not  have
any children. (Tr. at 40-45; GE 1, 3; AE E, H)
Applicant  graduated  from  high  school  in  Morocco  in  1997  and  obtained  a
bachelor’s degree there in 2002. He attended a community college in the United States
from 2007 to 2012, but he did not earn a degree. In 2006, he received an offer to work
as a linguist for a DOD contractor in Iraq, contingent on obtaining a security clearance.
Meanwhile,  he  has  worked  primarily  as  a  contract  virtual  linguist,  but  he  was
unemployed as of the date of the hearing. He has never held a DOD security clearance.
(Tr. at 7-10, 13, 36-46, 53-58, 113-114, 121-122; GE 1, 2; AE F, G)
All  of  Applicant’s  family  live  in  Morocco.  His  mother,  three  brothers,  and  three
sisters are citizens and residents of Morocco (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c). His father passed away
in approximately 2008. His mother is a 73-year-old housewife. His brothers are ages 52,
39, and 33. His 52-year-old and 39-year-old brothers are self-employed carpenters, and
his  33-year-old  brother  works  as  a  technician  for  a  private  company.  His  sisters  are
ages  48,  46,  and  35.  His  48-year-old  and  35-year-old  sisters are  housewives,  and  his
46-year-old  sister  is  an  assistant  at  a  private  school.  (SOR  ¶  1.h).  Other  than  his  48-
year-old sister, who is widowed, all of his siblings are married with children. He testified
that  none  of  his  sisters’  spouses  have  affiliations  with  the  Moroccan  government  or
military. (Tr. at 22, 58-72, 74-75, 78-79, 116-118; GE 1, 2, 3)
While  Applicant  indicated  in  his  August  2017  security  clearance  application
(SCA) that he communicated regularly with his brothers and sisters, he testified that his
only contact with family in Morocco was with his mother and 33-year-old brother. They,
along with his 33-year-old brother’s wife and minor child,  live together in an apartment
Applicant  purchased  for  his  mother,  as  further  discussed  below.  He  speaks  with  his
mother and 33-year-old brother almost daily, primarily through group chat on WhatsApp.
He  traveled  to  Morocco  to  visit  his  family  and  friends  in  approximately  2008,  2011,
2013, and for nearly three months in both 2016 and 2019. He testified that none of his
family members in Morocco are aware that he is seeking a security clearance or that he
has  received  an offer to  work as  a  linguist  for a  DOD contractor.  (Tr. at  16-17, 50-53,
58-72, 74-75, 91-93, 105, 112-114, 116-118, 125-126, 133-134; GE 1, 2, 3)
Applicant  testified  that  he  gave  his  mother  money  when  he  visited  her  in
Morocco, and he also provided money to some family members so that they could visit
her in Morocco when she was sick; however, he had not sent money to his mother in a
long time. He clarified that his disclosure in his SCA that he provided financial support of
$6,000 annually to his mother (SOR ¶ 1.h) occurred only once, in approximately 2016.
He testified that no family member in Morocco was relying on him for financial support
as of the date of the hearing, as his siblings were financially independent. (Tr. at 58-72,
115-116; GE 1, 2, 3)
Applicant  also  has  five  cousins  who  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Morocco:  two
are  police  officers  (SOR  ¶  1.e),  two  serve  in  the  Moroccan  military,  and  one  is  retired
from  the  Moroccan  military  (SOR  ¶  1.f).  He  testified  and  disclosed  in  his  2018
counterintelligence (CI) screening that his 56-year-old cousin retired from the Moroccan
military in approximately 2009, and his last contact with this cousin was during his 2016
trip to Morocco; his 40-year-old and 34-year-old cousins began serving in the Moroccan
military in 2000 and 2004, respectively, and his last contact with these cousins was in
2012  and  2002,  respectively;  and  he  was  unaware  of  the  ranks  that  all  three  cousins
held  in  the  Moroccan  military  but  indicated  that  they  served  in  the  infantry.  He  also
testified and disclosed in his CI screening that his 39-year-old and 34-year-old cousins
were police officers in Morocco since 2007 and 2008, respectively, and his last contact
with these cousins was in 2008 and 2002, respectively. (Tr. at 72-78, 118-119; GE 3)
Applicant  has  two  childhood friends  who are  citizens  and  residents  of  Morocco,
one  of  whom  is  a  police  officer  (SOR  ¶  1.g).  He  testified  that  he  had  only  occasional
contact with the childhood friend in Morocco who is a police officer, and he last saw this
friend during his 2019 trip to Morocco. He testified that he did not have any contact with
his other childhood friend. (Tr. at 16-17, 75-78, 119-120; GE 1, 2, 3)
In approximately 2008, Applicant opened a bank account in Morocco (SOR ¶ 1.l).
He  testified  that  he  did  so  to  hold  the  money  necessary  for  his  land  purchase,  as
discussed below. He estimated in his 2018 CI screening that the balance of this account
was  approximately  $9,000  USD.  In  late  2013,  he  purchased  an  apartment  in  Morocco
for  $50,000  USD  (SOR  ¶  1.j).  He  purchased  the  apartment  for  his  mother  to  live.  He
intends to sell the property when his mother passes away and transfer the profit to the
United States. In 2016, he purchased land in Morocco for $30,000 USD (SOR ¶1.k). He
did  so  as  an  investment,  as  he  intends  to  build  commercial  property  on  the  land  and
then rent or sell it. He testified that his land purchase was not a reflection of any loyalty
to Morocco. As of the date of the hearing, his 33-year-old brother was overseeing and
managing the development of the land, which consisted of construction of a coffee shop
with an apartment on top. (Tr. at 16-17, 50-53, 58-72, 93-105, 109-112, 123-125; GE 1,
3)
Applicant’s former girlfriend and ex-fiancée is a citizen of Somalia, and she has
children living in Somalia (SOR ¶ 1.d). She is a 42-year-old permanent resident of the
United  States.  He  testified  that  she  was  never  a  citizen  of  Syria.  He  met  her  in
approximately 2013 or 2014, when he worked for a refugee shelter in the United States
in  which  she  was  a  former  resident,  after  she  had  fled  Somalia  at  age  ten  to  Saudi
Arabia and then Syria before receiving refugee status to come to the United States. She
has  six  children:  three  reside  in  the  United  States,  two  reside  in  Somalia,  and  one
resides in Europe. He provided approximately $3,000 in financial support to her parents,
who are also citizens of Somalia (SOR  ¶ 1.i). He testified that his relationship with her
was on and off from approximately 2013 to 2017, as she became engaged to another
individual in late 2015, and then yet again another individual in approximately 2019. He
testified  that  he  had  no  intentions  of  reuniting  with  his  ex-fiancée,  and  he  last  had
contact with her in approximately June 2019. He testified that he no longer had any ties
to her, her parents, or any Somali citizen. (Tr. at 16-17, 20, 46-50, 79-91, 126-134, 152;
GE 2, 3)
As of the date of the hearing, Applicant rented an apartment in the United States.
He  has  a  checking  account  in  the  United  States  with  a  balance  of  approximately
$30,000.  He  believed  he  has  a  retirement  account  in  the  United  States  related  to  a
previous  employer,  but  he  was  unaware  of  its  value.  He  also  owns  a  car.  He  testified
that he has no intentions of returning to Morocco to live. He testified that he is loyal to
the  United  States.  He  received  a  charter  membership  certificate  in  2012  for  his
participation  and  contribution  to  the  National  Language  Service  Corps.  He  was
presented a team player award in 2014. He was awarded a certificate of appreciation in
2015 in recognition for three years of service to a former employer. (Tr. at 46, 53-54, 66,
105-106, 112, 120-123, 134-135; GE 1; AE B, C, D)
CRIMINAL
Applicant  was  arrested  in  December  2015  and  charged  with:  (1)  assault  and
battery  (SOR  ¶  2.a);  (2)  stalking  with  reasonable  fear  of  death,  assault,  etc.  (SOR  ¶
2.b); (3) using profane or threating language by means of telephone, cell broadcast, or
text (SOR ¶ 2.c); and (4) causing a telephone to ring, with or without intent to talk, with
intent  to  annoy  (SOR  ¶  2.d).  Applicant  testified  that  his  ex-fiancée,  as  discussed
previously,  reported  him  to  the  police  in  late  2015  after  he  questioned  her  upon
discovering  that  she  had  gotten  engaged  to  another  individual.  He  pled  guilty  to  the
fourth charge and charges one through three were nolle prossed. He was sentenced to
180 days  in  jail,  suspended,  fined $92,  and  ordered not have  any  contact  with  his ex-
fiancée  and  her  family.  She  obtained  a  two-year  protective  order  against  him  in  April
2016, which was dissolved by the court in May 2017 at her request. He does not have
any other criminal-related incidents. (Tr. at 16-17, 54-56, 79-91, 106-109, 112, 114-115;
GE 1, 2, 3, 4; AE A)
PERSONAL CONDUCT
The SOR alleged that Applicant  deliberately falsified his response to section 22
of his 2017 SCA, because he failed to list the assault and battery charge, as set forth in
SOR ¶ 2.a, and the charge of causing a telephone to ring, with or without intent to talk,
with intent to annoy, as set forth in SOR ¶ 2.d (SOR ¶ 3.a). Section 22 instructed that he
report information regardless of whether the record in his case was sealed, expunged,
or  otherwise  stricken  from  the  court  record,  or  the  charge  was  dismissed.  Section  22
also  inquired  whether,  in  the  seven  years  prior  to  completing  his  SCA,  he  had  been
issued a summons, citation, or ticket to appear in court in a criminal proceeding against
him; he had been arrested by any police officer, sheriff, marshal or any other type of law
enforcement  official;  he  had  been  charged,  convicted,  or  sentenced  of  a  crime  in  any
court; or he had been or was at the time of completing his SCA on probation or parole. It
also  inquired  whether he  was  at  the  time  of  completing  his  SCA  on  trial  or  awaiting  a
trial on criminal charges.
Applicant  disclosed,  in  response  to  section  22  of  his  2017  SCA,  his  April  2016
conviction for “cause telephone/pager to ring to annoy.” In so disclosing, he stated that
he was in a relationship with his then girlfriend, the complainant, when she reported to
the  police  that  he  was  bothering  her.  He  stated  that  the  court  issued  a  two-year
protective order prohibiting him from having contact with his ex-girlfriend or her children.
He also stated that she dropped the protective order in May 2017, after which time they
resumed their relationship. (GE 1, 2)
Morocco
The United States considers Morocco an important regional security, trade, and
development  partner,  and  Morocco  is  a  designated  Major  Non-NATO  Ally.  It  is  a
member of the U.S.-led Global Coalition to Defeat the Islamic State. In 2017, the United
States and Morocco launched an “Initiative to Address Homegrown Violent Extremists”
under the auspices of the multilateral Global Counterterrorism Forum.
In April 2019, the U.S. Department of State raised the travel advisory for Morocco
to  “Level  2:  Exercise  Increased  Caution,”  due  to  terrorism.  Terrorist  attacks  targeting
tourist sites, official Moroccan government facilities, and the U.S. Consulate and Public
Affairs  annex  in  Casablanca  took  place  in  Morocco  in  2003,  2007,  2011,  and  2018.
Extremists claiming allegiance to ISIS targeted and murdered two Scandinavian tourists
in  the  2018  attack.  In  addition,  while  Morocco  is  viewed  as  one  of  the  more  stable
countries in West Africa, protests reflecting grievances over the economy, governance,
police  brutality,  and  high-level  cronyism  and  corruption  have  surged  in  the  historically
marginalized north and east since 2016.
Somalia
The  United  States  formally  recognized  the  federal  government  of  Somalia  in
January  2013.  In  July  2018,  the  U.S.  Department  of  State  issued  a  level  4  travel
advisory  for  Somalia,  advising  U.S.  citizens  not  to  travel  to  Somalia  due  to  terrorism,
crime,  and  piracy.  It  also  assessed  Mogadishu  as  being  a  critical  threat  location  for
terrorist  activity  directed  at  or  affecting  U.S.  Government  interests.  Violent  crime  is
common throughout Somalia and no area is considered immune from violence, as the
potential exists  for hostile  acts,  either  targeted  or  random,  against  foreign  nationals  at
any  time  throughout  the  country.  The  U.S.  Government  cannot  provide  consular
services to U.S. citizens in Somalia.
In March 2008, the U.S. Secretary of State designated Somali-based Al-Shabaab
as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. The group remained active in Somalia throughout
2017.  In  what  is  believed  to  be  the  single  deadliest  attack  of  the  group’s  history  in
Somalia,  Al-Shabaab  detonated  multiple  bombs  in  Mogadishu  in  October  2017,  killing
more than 500 people. Somalia’s porous borders contribute to regional insecurity, as Al-
Shabaab  and  others  continue  to  move  throughout  the  region  mostly  undetected.  With
little  law  enforcement  cooperation  between  the  federal  government  of  Somalia  and
Somali state governments, the ability of U.S. law enforcement to investigate suspected
terrorists, terrorist incidents, and kidnappings is hampered.

"Applicant is 59 years old. He was born in Somalia and graduated from high school
in 1978. He was ranked as a Major (artillery officer) in the Somalian army and came to
the United States in  August 1990 for military training. He worked closely with the U.S.
military for nearly a year when Somalia erupted in civil war. Applicant requested to stay
in the U.S. and was offered political asylum. He rented an apartment in State A, which
was paid by the Somalian government for two years. (Tr. 13-14; GE 1, GE 2, GE 3)
Applicant was married in 1988 and divorced in 1996. In February 2005, he married
again through a religious ceremony, which was recognized in the U.S. after they were
legally married in 2012. His spouse is a naturalized U.S. citizen from Somalia. Applicant
became a naturalized U.S. citizen in June 2008. He is a dual citizen of Somalia and the
U.S. Applicant currently is employed by a county government agency as deputy auditor
for  public  relations.  He  is  applying  for  a  linguist  position  with  a  DOD  contractor.  His
employment is contingent on him obtaining a DOD security clearance. (Tr. 14; GE 1, GE
2, GE 3)
Foreign Influence:
Applicant’s mother is approximately 85 years old. At the time the SOR was drafted,
his mother was living in Kenya to receive medical treatment since the medical healthcare
system in Somalia was generally nonexistent during that time. At the hearing, Applicant
stated that his mother is now residing in Somalia. Department Counsel requested I amend
the SOR to reflect the current information, which I did without an objection. Applicant’s
mother  is  a  citizen  and  resident  of  Somalia.  He  communicates  with  his  mother
approximately  twice  weekly.  He  also  sends  her  approximately  $400  every  month.  His
deceased father was employed by the Somalian government in the postal service. (Tr.
15, 21-24; GE 1, GE 2, GE 3)
One of his brothers is also a citizen and resident of Somalia. Applicant does not
communicate regularly with him. His brother is currently residing with his mother. A niece
and her five children also live with his mother. The house contains approximately eight
bedrooms  that  can  accommodate  the  family.  The  house  is  valued  at  approximately
$140,000,  and  Applicant  would  inherit  one-fourth  of  this  property  upon  her  death.
Applicant communicates frequently with his niece. His youngest brother remains in Kenya
and continues to receive treatment for mental health issues. Applicant communicates with
this brother every couple of days. (Tr. 15-17, 24-27; GE 1, GE 2, GE 3)
Applicant has three nephews who are citizens and residents of Somalia. One of
his nephews is employed by the Canadian government in the capital of Somalia, working
with the United Nations. At the time of Applicant’s background interview, this nephew had
been previously employed as a consultant for the President of Somalia in the presidential
palace. Applicant communicates with this nephew on a monthly basis. Applicant’s second
nephew is currently employed by the Minister of Finance in Somalia. His third nephew,
also living in Somalia, is currently unemployed. The third nephew has requested Applicant
send him money on occasion. Applicant sends him $50 to $100 whenever he can afford
it. (Tr. 18, 28-32; GE 1)
Applicant admitted that an acquaintance of his, who had served with him in the
Somalian army, was also the Defense Minister of Somalia from 2015 to 2017. He stated
that  this  acquaintance  currently  resides  in  the  same  city  as  Applicant,  but  he  has  not
spoken to his colleague since 2016. (Tr. 17-19, Tr. 1/2020 7-9)
Applicant  also  admitted  that  the  current  Minister  of  Foreign  Affairs  in  Somalia
attended  middle  school  with  him.  Applicant  met  with  him  during  a  visit  he  had  to
Applicant’s U.S. city of residence. In February 2018, Applicant organized a meeting with
the Somalian Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Somalian Community Association in his
city. Since that meeting, Applicant has not had further contact with him. (Tr. 1/2020 10-
11; GE 3)
Applicant  admitted  that  in  1984,  while  he  served  in  the  Somalian  army,  he
purchased  three  properties  in  Somalia  worth  an  approximate  combined  value  of
$120,000.  He is uncertain if anything has been built on his properties, and he would like
to sell them at some point. Applicant does not own a home in the U.S., nor does he have
any  future  retirement  accounts  in  the  U.S.  His  only  asset  in  the  U.S.  is  an  apartment
building  he  purchased  during  an  auction  in  2010.  The  apartment  building  is  currently
unoccupied,  but  he  would  like  to  rent  the  apartments  out  someday.  He  estimated  the
current value of the apartment building at approximately $100,000. (Tr. 1/2020 11-13; GE
3)
Applicant  stated  during  a  background  interview  that  he  would  like  to  retire  in
Somalia within the next ten years, but only if the political party and  the government of
Somalia resolved their conflict. During the hearing, Applicant admitted he would retire in
Somalia,  especially  if  he  generated  enough  income  from  his  apartment  building  in  the
U.S. He would also return to Somalia if he were offered a Somalian government position,
perhaps in the capacity of rebuilding the Somalian army. (Tr. 1/2020 14-17; GE 2, GE 3)
",False
"Applicant  admitted  each  of  the  allegations  in  the  SOR.    After  a  thorough  and
careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of
fact.
Applicant  is  44  years  old,  is  married,  and  has  eight  children.    He  has  a  high
school  diploma  and/or  GED  and  two  years  of  college,  and  is  currently  applying  for  a
positon  as  a  Translator.    A  security  clearance  is  required  in  connection  with  this
employment with a defense contractor.
Applicant was born in Afghanistan on April 21, 1975.  In 1982, at the young age
of  seven,  Applicant  and  his  family  fled  Afghanistan,  because  of  the  war,  and  became
refugees  in  Pakistan.    Applicant  lived  in  Pakistan  until  1992.    During  that  time,  he
finished  high  school  and  two  years  of  college  in  Pakistan.    He  also  learned  how  to
speak English.  (Tr. p. 38.)  Applicant then moved to Saudi Arabia, where he could find
employment  to  support  his  family  and  resided  there  from  1992  to  2004.    During  that
time, he worked at a gas station and at a restaurant.  In 2004, the U.S. forces came to
Afghanistan and the country became much more secure.  Applicant could speak English
and so he applied for and was hired to work with the U.S. forces in Afghanistan.  From
2004 to 2008, Applicant worked as a translator for the U.S. military in Afghanistan.  He
did  not  have  a  security  clearance,  nor  was  he  a  U.S.  citizen,  and  so  his  duties  and
responsibilities were limited.  In 2008, Applicant came to the United States on a Special
Immigrant  Visa.    In  2009,  he  deployed  to  Afghanistan  where  he  worked  for  the  U.S.
military for 21 months.  Applicant explained that at some point, on a convoy or mission
under fire, an IED blew up underneath his seat.  (Tr. p. 53.)  He continued to do his job
without faltering or showing fear.
Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2014.  Since then, he has lived in
the  United  States.    Now  with  hopes  of  obtaining  a  security  clearance,  he  plans  to  go
back  to  work  for  the  U.S.  forces  as  a  Translator  or  Linguist  and  provide  unlimited
information.  He presently works as a Lyft driver.
To  provide  some  background,  Applicant  married  an  Afghan  woman  in  1995.
Together  they  have  eight  children,  who  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Afghanistan.
Applicant’s spouse has a green card and resides with their eight children in Afghanistan
where the children go to school.  Since 1995, Applicant has spent only about six months
out  of  every  year  with  his  family  in  Afghanistan  and  the  rest  of  the  year  he  spends  in
Pakistan to work in order to provide for their financial support.
Applicant  has  nine  siblings,  five  brothers,  three  who  are  citizens  of  Afghanistan
and residents of Saudi Arabia.  He also has four sisters who are citizen and residents of
Afghanistan.  One of his brothers is a citizen of Afghanistan and was a resident of India.
This  brother  was  going  to  school  in  India  and  working  toward  earning  his  Master’s
degree  in  Business.    He  recently  returned  to  Afghanistan  and  is  working  for  the
Department  of  Agriculture.    Two  of  his  brothers  live  in  Afghanistan.    They  are  both
physically ill, unable to work,  and are financially supported by their sons who are  both
teachers.  Three of his brothers are currently living in Saudi Arabia.  There are no jobs
in  Afghanistan  and  it  is  easier  to  find  work  in  Saudi  Arabia.    Two  are  working  in  a
restaurant and the other works for a touring company.  Applicant speaks to them about
once every three, four or six months, or on the holidays.  (Tr. pp. 33-34.)
Applicant  has  four  sisters  who  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Afghanistan.    They
would all like to come to the United States.  All of them are housewives.  None of their
husbands  work  for  the  military  or  the  Government.    (Tr.  p.  39.)    Since  none  of  them
have cell phones, Applicant does not speak with them on any regular basis.  If he gets a
chance  to  call  one of  their  children, he  may  get  the  opportunity  to speak  to  one  of  his
sisters.  None of Applicant’s nephews or nieces work for or are affiliated with the Afghan
military or Government.  (Tr. p. 40.)
Applicant explained that his wife and eight children live with three of his brothers
and  their  families  on  a  huge  family  compound  that  they  all  inherited  from  their
grandfather.    (Tr.  pp.  42-43.)    The  house  is  divided  into  smaller  apartment  areas,  but
they all own the property together.  None of the Applicant’s sisters reside on the family
compound.  Applicant provides all of the financial support for his wife and children.  He
provides no other financial support to any of his extended family members.  Since 2008,
Applicant has visited his family in Afghanistan every three or four months.  He provides
no  financial  support  to  his  siblings,  or  their  families,  as  they  either  take  care  of
themselves or they do not need his help.
Applicant  has  no  foreign  bank  accounts,  but  does  own  his  portion  of  the  family
compound  in  Afghanistan.    He  has  no  family  or  property  in  the  United  States.    (Tr.  p.
53.) He has a bank account and a vehicle in the United States.  (Tr. p. 45)  He states
that next year, he plans to move his entire family to the United States, where all of his
children will attend school.  (Tr. pp. 46-47.)
Applicant  is  uniquely  talented.    He  speaks  5  languages  which  include  Farsi,
Pashto, Urdu, Hindi, and Arabic.  He also speaks 6 or 7 dialects of Pashto.  (Tr. p. 66.)
A  number  of  laudatory  letters  of  recommendation  from  defense  contractors  and
pertinent  military  personnel  that  Applicant  has  worked  with  and  who  have  direct
knowledge  of  his  abilities  attest  to  his  experience  as  a  translator,  knowledge  of  the
country,  loyalty,  professionalism,  and  great  overall  value  he  has  given  to  the  mission.
(Applicant’s Post-Hearing Exhibits 1 through 9.)
Applicant has received a number of Certificates of Appreciation from U.S. forces
for  his  outstanding  translator  support  and  contributions  to  the  missions.    (Applicant’s
Post-Hearing Exhibits 10 through 14.)
I have taken administrative notice of the information set forth in the Government’s
briefs  and  supportive  documents  on  the  countries  of  Afghanistan  and  Saudi  Arabia.
(HE1  and  HE2.)    In  summary,  both  countries  provide  a  significant  and  heightened
security risk to the United States.

"Applicant is a 35-year-old senior software engineer who was born and educated in
Pakistan.  He  received  his  undergraduate  degree  in  Pakistan.  He  came  to  the  United
States in June 2002 and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2008. (GX 4) His Pakistani
citizenship  was  revoked.  He  has  four  children  who  are  U.S.  citizens.  His  wife  is  a
naturalized U.S. citizen. (Tr. 15) He has held a security clearance since 2012. He has
worked on various Government projects and he has worked in support of the U.S. military
in  the  United States  and  abroad.  (Tr. 20)  Applicant  submitted  his most  recent  security
clearance application on June 5, 2017. (GX 1) He also submitted SCAs in 2013, 2014,
and 2015. (GX 2, 3, and 4)
The sole Guideline B allegation (SOR ¶ 1.a) concerns  Applicant’s mother-in-law
and father-in law, who are citizens and residents of Pakistan. Under Guideline E, the SOR
alleged  that  Applicant  falsified  material facts on his security  clearances  in 2015,  2014,
2013, and in background interviews in 2016 and 2011, by failing to disclose his brother
as a relative. (SOR ¶¶ 2.a-2.e). Applicant’s brother has been in a U.S. prison since 2005.
The SOR alleged in SOR ¶ 2.f that Applicant resigned from his employment after being
told that he would be fired in 2013. Applicant denied all allegations of falsification under
Guideline E. (Answer)
Applicant admitted SOR ¶ 1.a., concerning his in-laws in Pakistan. He stated that
he has minimal telephone contact with them, about two or three times a year.  Applicant’s
wife talks to her parents by phone about every few months. Her mother is a housewife
and her father is retired. (Tr. 29) Applicant stated that he does not know much about them.
He met his wife’s parents in Pakistan in 2010 when he married his wife. Their marriage
was pre-arranged. His in-laws have never been to the United States. They do not know
the nature of Applicant’s work. He considers them “old and aged” and simple people who
have no connection with the government. (Tr. 31; GX 5) Applicant does not give them
financial support.
Applicant has five siblings: four brothers and one sister. They reside in the United
States and are naturalized U.S. citizens. (Tr. 27) One of his brothers has been in a U.S.
prison since 2005. (GX 6) In Section 18 of the SCAs that he prepared in 2013, 2014, and
2015. Applicant listed his siblings, but he did not list the brother in prison.
Applicant stated that he was advised by his first employer that he did not have to
list the brother in prison because Applicant had minimal contact with him and Applicant
does not like to speak about his past. (Tr. 33-34) Applicant stated that he relied on that
advice and when he completed subsequent security clearance questionnaires, he did not
change any answers to disclose his brother in prison. (Tr. 34)
During a 2016 subject interview when asked if he had any other family members
to list, Applicant said “No.” When asked directly by the interviewer if he had a brother in
prison, Applicant responded in the negative again. (GX 5) In his 2011 subject interview,
he confirmed that no other relatives needed to be listed. (GX 5)
At the hearing, Applicant  testified that he takes his mother to visit his brother in
prison about twice a year. (Tr. 57) He acknowledged that he sees his brother on these
visits. Applicant’s mother lives with Applicant and his family. Applicant’s brother calls from
prison to speak to her mother, and sometimes Applicant will answer the phone and speak
to him.  (Tr. 58)
However,  when  Applicant  answered  the  SOR,  he  stated  that  his  estranged
relationship with his brother is unspoken because it would be unfair if it were to negatively
impact Applicant’s life. (Answer) He added that he “falsely” believed that this disclosure
of his brother in prison would negatively impact his ability to obtain a clearance. Applicant
stated that his intent was not to defraud the U.S. Government.
Applicant disclosed his brother in prison on his 2017 SCA. Applicant acknowledged
that the omission of his brother’s details looks like a deliberate failure to disclose material
facts. Applicant testified that he has received counseling and stressed that since 2017,
he has disclosed his brother in prison during the clearance application process. He said
one of his other brothers advised him to disclose that he had a brother in prison. (Tr. 62)
The final SOR allegation, ¶ 2.f, concerns Applicant’s resignation in 2013 from a job
before  being  fired  for  issuing  an  unauthorized  badge  to  someone  at  work.  Applicant
explained at his hearing that the issue resulted from a personality conflict. (Tr. 67-69)
Applicant submitted five letters of recommendation from various personal friends
and  professional  colleagues.  Each  letter  attests  to  Applicant’s  integrity,  positivity,
responsibility,  and  reliability.  He  is described  as  a  valuable  asset to  any  team.  Military
officers  for  whom  Applicant  worked  stated  that  he  was  a  dedicated  and  respectful
employee. (AX A – E) Applicant also submitted an entry on duty (EOD), dated January
2020 for approval for work with another government agency. (AX F, H)
",True
"Applicant is a 61-year-old interim team lead who has performed the same type of
work  with  the  same  entity  for  about  a  year.  He  currently  earns  just  over  $100,000  a
year. Born and raised in the United States, Applicant has earned a bachelor’s degree in
statistics.  Married  in  2007,  Applicant  and  his  wife  have  three  children,  including  one
stepchild. He is committed to his spouse, who he describes as “way too cute” to divorce.
(Tr. 9) His wife teaches on an hourly basis at a Russian language and studies program.
Applicant  lives  within  his  means,  owns  an  unencumbered  $250,000  rental
property yielding a monthly profit of about $900, and maintains both a retirement and an
investment account. He does not “have to dip into” either of those accounts. (Tr. 26-27)
He  has  a  mortgage  balance  of  about  $244,000  on  a  property  with  a  market  value  in
excess  of  $600,000.  He  pays  a  monthly  mortgage  payment  on  that  home  of  $2,000.
One of his two cars has a modest monthly payment due, a payment of $300 toward its
purchase  plan.  He  and  his  family  are  settled  in  their  neighborhood.  Applicant  has  not
received credit counseling. (Tr. 38)
Applicant’s  wife  has  a  future  interest  in  an  apartment  in  Ukraine  owned  by  her
63-year-old  mother.  The  apartment  is  expected  to  pass  in  equal  halves  to  both
Applicant’s  wife  and  her  brother.  It  is  believed  the  total  value  of  the  property  is  about
$25,000-$30,000, making Applicant’s wife’s share worth about $12,500-$15,000 before
taxes  or  fees.  (PHE  14)  While  Applicant  has  not  been  to  Ukraine  since  his  2007
marriage,  his  wife  and  children  spent  about  two  months  there  in  the  summer  of  2018.
The wife regularly spends about two months in Ukraine each summer. (Tr. 44)
Applicant’s  mother-in-law  is  a  citizen  and  resident  of  Ukraine.  She  is  a  retired
factory worker. She has not served in the Ukrainian or Russian military or government.
Applicant’s wife sends money to her mother. Applicant does not know the exact extent
of his wife’s current largess in terms of her payments to her mother. (Tr. 39) Before his
wife  started  working  and  earning  her  own  income,  however,  Applicant  would  send  his
mother-in-law  about  $200  a  month.  (Tr.  39)  This  mother-in-law  recently  spent
approximately five months in the United States with Applicant and his wife.  Otherwise,
Applicant has periodic exchanges with her when she Skypes or phones with Applicant’s
wife, exchanges that take place weekly.
Applicant’s 46-year-old brother-in-law has not visited the United States. Although
he  is believed  to  still  be  a  citizen  of  Ukraine,  he  has  spent the  last  decade  residing  in
Russia.  (Tr. 40)  His  contact  with  Applicant  is  minimal,  limited  to birthday  calls.  Neither
speaks the other’s language. (Tr. 41) Applicant’s wife speaks with her brother “no more
than” once a month. (Tr. 41) This sibling has never worked for the Ukrainian or Russian
government. (Tr. 48) He is a salesman for a private firm.
The father of Applicant’s eldest child, who lives with Applicant and his wife in the
United  States,  lives  in  Ukraine.  This  teen  has  occasional  contact  with  her  biological
father  when  she  is  in  Ukraine.  The  ex-spouse’s  obligation  to  pay  child  support  was
waived in exchange for letting the girl move to the U.S. after Applicant and his wife wed.
For  tax  years  (TY)  2013-2017,  Applicant  failed  to  timely  file  Federal  and  state
income  tax  returns.  This  failure  was  the  result  of  “pure  procrastination.”  (Tr.  30)
Applicant was aware the returns had to be filed by mid-April of each year or a request
for an extension  had to  be  submitted,  but  his  focus  was  elsewhere.  Although  he  does
not have a “specific record,” such tax return filing failures are not new;  he volunteered
that earlier TY return omissions “probably occurred.” (Tr. 37) When later asked whether
he was testifying that he had not timely filed returns for TY 2007-2012, Applicant stated:
“I’m testifying that the timely filing of taxes was inconsistent for all that. . . . There may
have been on-time filings. I couldn’t tell you whether there were or not.” (Tr. 38)
Evidence  was  offered  showing  that  the  following  delinquent  TY  returns  were
prepared, although only the Federal return for TY 2016 is signed by Applicant. (Ex. B)
The  copy  of  Applicant’s  complete  Federal  TY  2017  tax  return  is  unsigned.  (Ex.  C)  A
2018  bill for Federal taxes  due for TY  2014 for $1,235.19  was  presented along  with a
copy of Applicant’s un-transacted check in that amount. (Ex. D)
The  evidence  presented  after  the  hearing  are  copies  of  a  tax  preparer’s  forms
designed  for  electronic  transmittal.  No  direct  documentary  evidence  was  provided
showing that they were filed. The only evidence of taxes paid were copies of checks for
TY 2017 state taxes owed and an April 2019 check paying his Federal obligation from
2017 (see Exs. H-P). In sum, the evidence submitted here shows:
TY  2013  –  Federal  return  prepared  in  2017  with  $841  refund;  state  filing
presented, reflecting $340 refund;
TY  2014  –  Federal  return  prepared  in  2018;  state  filing  presented,  reflecting
$114 refund.
TY  2015  –  Federal  return  prepared  in  April  2019  showing  $2,679  owed;  state
filing presented, reflecting $367 owed;
TY 2016 – Federal return prepared in April 2019; state filing presented, reflecting
refund of $1,175;
TY  2017  –  Federal  return  prepared  in  April  2019  with  payment  of  $1,763;  state
filing presented, reflecting $752 owed.
Notice
I  take  administrative  notice  of  the  following  facts:  Ukraine,  formerly  part  of  the
later dismantled Union of Socialist Soviet Republics (USSR), is a republic with a semi-
presidential  political  system.  In  2014,  the  Ukrainian  parliament  approved  a  new
government, which caused Russia to respond by seizing Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula.
Additional  unrest  occurred  in  2014,  involving  thousands  of  pro-Russian  protesters  in
eastern  and  southern  Ukraine.  In  2015,  a  ceasefire  agreement  established  a  de  facto
dividing  line  between  Ukrainian  government-controlled  and  separatist-held  areas  in
Ukraine. (GX 5.) Relations between the countries are strained.

"The  SOR  alleges  Applicant’s  father,  grandmother,  and  parents-in-law  are
residents and citizens of Egypt; his spouse and mother are citizens of Egypt, residing in
the United States; and his brother is a citizen of Egypt, living in the United Arab Emirates
(UAE). Applicant admitted the SOR allegations, and provided comments and documents
with his answer to the SOR.
Applicant  is  a  40-year-old  American  citizen  by  birth.  He  received  a  bachelor’s
degree  in  2007  from  an  Egyptian  university,  and  a  master’s  degree  in  2012  from  an
American  university.  He  has  been  employed  as  a  senior  software  engineer  by  a  U.S.
defense contractor since February 2018, who is sponsoring him for a security clearance.
He previously worked for a similar U.S. defense contractor form October 2015 to February
2018, but was promoted to a senior position to move to his current employer. Applicant
married in December 2017 and has a one-year-old daughter, also a U.S. citizen. He has
no foreign financial interests. Applicant has a brother who is a U.S. citizen and resident,
and another who is an Egyptian citizen, working in construction in the UAE.
Applicant’s spouse was born in Saudi Arabia and lived there for seven years before
moving  to  Egypt.  She is an  Egyptian  citizen,  attended  school  in  Egypt,  and became a
licensed  medical  doctor  in  approximately  2006.  She  practiced  as  a  dermatologist  and
studied for a master’s degree, which was awarded in 2016. She met Applicant in Egypt
in December 2016 through an arrangement with his mother and her family’s friends. She
traveled to the United States in September 2017 to visit her sister and Applicant, and she
and  Applicant  married  in  December  2017  in  the  United  States.  She  became  a  U.S.
permanent resident in January 2019, and intends to apply for U.S. citizenship as soon as
permitted. She believes she can apply for citizenship in about three years, and is willing
to renounce her Egyptian citizenship. She has no business, financial, or property interests
in Egypt. In a post-hearing letter, she described her love and awe of the United States,
calling it the greatest of nations with great, hardworking people, and a nation of freedom,
justice, expression of speech, liberty, and law. She is studying to take the U.S. medical
licensing exam to become a U.S. licensed physician and hopes to practice medicine in
the United States.
Applicant’s  mother  and  father  currently  reside  together  in  Egypt,  and  are  both
Egyptian  citizens.  His  mother  is  a  66-year-old  U.S.  permanent  resident  who  travels
between Egypt and the United States to visit her family. She intends to become a U.S.
citizen as soon as permitted. She is a degreed civil engineer, but has worked substantially
as  a  homemaker  and  currently  cares  for  her  spouse.  Applicant’s  father  is  a  civil
engineering professor at an Egyptian university. He earned a degree from an American
university,  was  named  the  graduate  student  of  the  year,  and  eventually  taught
engineering at the same university when Applicant and his brother were born. He received
a prestigious American Society of Civil Engineers award for his work and was personally
recognized by a U.S. ambassador for his design work on a U.S. embassy compound. He
is 69 years old and suffers from a heart condition, but intends to apply for U.S. permanent
resident status as soon as practical.
Applicant’s  brother  is  an  Egyptian  citizen,  residing  in  the  UAE  shortly  after
graduating from an American university in Egypt in 2007. He is a construction engineer
for a UAE construction company. He received a master’s degree from a U.S. university
in 2017. He is pursuing a U.S. professional engineering certification and has applied for
U.S.  permanent  resident  status,  which  is  currently  pending  approval.  He  intends  to
renounce  his  Egyptian  citizenship  once  he  is  able  to  become  a  U.S.  citizen.  He  and
Applicant speak with each other about every three to six months.
Applicant’s  grandmother is in  her late  80s  and not  highly  educated.  His parents
care for her in Egypt. Applicant speaks with her about twice a year. His father-in-law is a
civil engineer who operates his own business in Egypt, and his mother-in-law is a high
school graduate and homemaker in Egypt. All are citizens and residents of Egypt.
None of Applicant’s family members have ties to a foreign military, government or
intelligence service. Applicant maintains weekly phone or social media contact with his
parents and tries to visit them annually. He reports all foreign travel to his facility security
officer  and  he  provides  a  debrief  when  he  returns.  Applicant  noted  that  his  employer
trained him on issues to consider when traveling abroad. He owns a home in the U.S.
valued at about $320,000, and has about $19,000 in bank and investment accounts after
paying a cash down payment on his home. He regularly attends religious services. Two
of  Applicant’s  co-workers  and  friends  submitted  letters  on  his  behalf,  attesting  to  his
devotion  to  family,  work  and  friendships.  Applicant  is  described  as  compassionate,  a
passionate  family  man,  dedicated,  honest,  trustworthy  and  inspiring.  Applicant  was
awarded in 2018 for the impact his work has on his company, and he was recognized as
a  team  innovator  for  his  achievements  in  efficiency  and  effectiveness.  He  presented
himself  at  the  hearing  as  a  thoughtful,  mature  professional,  and  appeared  honest  and
forthcoming in his testimony.
",True
"Applicant’s  admissions  to  the  Iraqi  residency  and  citizenship  and  the  Iraqi
government employments of his family members, and to his former service in the Iraqi
National Guard, are accepted and incorporated as findings of fact. After considering the
FORM, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant  is  a  39-year-old  dual  citizen  of  the  United  States  and  his  native  Iraq.
Applicant has never married, but he has a five-year-old daughter, who was born in the
United States in August 2014. As of August 2017, Applicant was paying child support at
$700 a month. (Item 4.) He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in January 2017. Although
he expressed an intention to renounce his Iraqi citizenship when he applied in July 2017
for a DOD clearance to work as a linguist for a defense contractor (Item 3), and indicated
during an October 2017 subject interview that he had signed a form renouncing his Iraqi
citizenship during a counterintelligence screening interview in August 2017 (Item 5), there
is no evidence showing that he no longer holds Iraqi citizenship.
Applicant was raised in his native Iraq. He is the third of eight children born to his
parents, both native resident citizens of Iraq. His father retired from a position with the
Iraqi government. His mother did not work outside the home. Applicant’s siblings (an older
brother and  sister, three  younger  sisters, and  two  younger  brothers)  are  Iraqi  resident
citizens. (Items 3-4.)
Applicant  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  November  2004  from  a  technological
university  in  Iraq.  At  that  time,  he  was  serving  in  Iraq’s  National  Guard  at  the  rank  of
sergeant. He enlisted voluntarily because of the financial benefit and the lack of civilian
work in Iraq at the time and began active duty service in June 2003. He was discharged
in July 2005. He then worked as an electrical engineer for a construction company in Iraq
until November 2006. From November 2006 to July 2009, he worked on a reconstruction
team in Iraq providing linguist services in support of the U.S. government. (Items 3-4.) He
had yearly security screenings as part of his employment as a local hire in Iraq for his
duties for the U.S. government. (Item 4.)
Applicant came to the United States on a Special Immigration Visa (SIV) in July
2009. (Items 4-5.) The United States granted employment fourth preference immigration
visa status to certain special immigrants, including Iraqi nationals who were employed by
or  on  behalf  of  the  U.S.  government  in  Iraq  for  at  least  12  months  and  met  certain
requirements.  See  travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/special-immg-
visas-iraqis-employed-us-gov.html. He was cleared to immigrate in March 2009 and was
issued the SIV in April 2009. He entered the United States on an Iraqi passport issued in
January 2007 and valid until January 2015. (Item 4.) After a brief period of unemployment
in the United States, Applicant worked part time, as needed, as an interpreter and role
player from November 2009 to March 2011. He indicates that he had a counterintelligence
(CI) screening in June 2010 (Item 5) for that work.  He also held a job with a company
from  November  2010  to  February  2011.  From  May  2011  to  October  2011,  Applicant
worked  full  time  as  a  security  guard.  He  left  the  job  voluntarily,  and  worked  as  an
equipment operator in the oil industry from October 2011 to August 2012. (Item 3.)
Applicant  attended  graduate  school  in  the  United  States  from  August  2012  to
November  2013,  and  was  awarded  his  master’s  degree  in  industrial  engineering  in
December 2013. He returned to work for his previous employer in the oil industry in the
United States until September 2015, when he was terminated for failure to show up for
work  during  his  scheduled  days  off.  Applicant  collected  unemployment  compensation
while  out  of  work  from  October  2015  to  April  2016.  From  May  2016  through  at  least
October  2017,  Applicant  worked  as  a  truck  driver  for  a  succession  of  seven  different
employers in the United States. (Items 3-4.)
In  January  2017,  Applicant  became  a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen  on  his  own
application  submitted  in  October 2014.  He  obtained  a  U.S.  passport  in  early  February
2017.  Later  in  February  2017,  he  renewed  his  Iraqi  passport,  which  expires  in  mid-
February 2025. (Items 3-4.) He was in Iraq for his uncle’s funeral and had entered Iraq
using his Iraqi passport that expired in January 2015. He used his expired Iraqi passport
rather than his newly-obtained U.S. passport because he wanted to avoid the visa fee,
and he renewed his Iraqi passport because under Iraqi law, he was required to exit Iraq
on a current Iraqi passport. That Iraqi passport bears a departure stamp from Iraq dated
February 27, 2017. (Item 4.)
In  June  2017,  Applicant  was  offered  contract  work  by  a  defense  contractor
(company X) to provide linguist services in Iraq to the United States military, apparently
contingent on passing a CI screening and background investigation for security clearance
eligibility. On July 24, 2017, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a security
clearance  application  (SCA)  on  which  he  disclosed  personal  and  family  ties  to  Iraq,
including his Iraqi citizenship and possession of a valid Iraqi passport. He stated about
his foreign citizenship that he was renouncing it as an employee of company X and that
he will surrender his Iraqi passport to company X following his CI screening. Applicant
indicated that he had used his Iraqi passport in February 2017 to travel to Iraq but used
his U.S. passport while in transit through Qatar. Applicant disclosed on his SCA that his
parents and siblings are resident citizens of Iraq, and he listed their employments showing
that,  with  limited  exception,  his  family  members  are  or  were  employed  by  Iraq’s
government. Applicant reported that he had daily telephone contact with his mother and
brothers and weekly contact with his father and sisters. Applicant responded affirmatively
to an SCA inquiry concerning whether he has or has had close or continuing contact with
other  foreign  nationals  within  the  last  seven  years.  He  listed  ten  persons  with  Iraqi
citizenship, eight living in Iraq and two living in the United States. Of the eight persons in
Iraq,  four  work  for  Iraq’s  government  and  one  works  for  a  public  university;  two  are
homemakers; and one is a self-employed jeweler. (Item 3.)
On August 30, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator as
part of his CI screening. He explained that he immigrated to the United States with a SIV
because he wanted to start a new life in the United States, and he had previously worked
for the United States in Iraq and was concerned for his safety in Iraq. He denied that he
had any allegiance to any country over the United States, stating that he loves the United
and that his affection grew for the United States because he was trained by the United
States  military  while  he  served  in  the  Iraqi  National  Guard.  He  denied  any  ongoing
association  with  anyone  with  whom  he  served  in  Iraq.  He  admitted  that  he  sometimes
misses  Iraq  but  has  decided  to  stay  in  the  United  States  and  “become  something.”
Applicant expressed a plan to renounce his Iraqi citizenship, and to surrender his Iraqi
passport to company X on completion of his CI screening. In the event of any attempts to
threaten or blackmail him, Applicant indicated that he would contact the U.S. government.
He  could  conceive  of  no  situation  where  it  would  be  acceptable  to  betray  the  U.S.
government. (Item 4.)
During his CI, Applicant discussed his family members in Iraq, their employments,
and his contacts with them. The family members with whom he has ongoing contact are
set forth in the following table.

Applicant also provided the names and occupations of 15 other extended family
members (uncles, aunts, cousins) in Iraq, including three cousins who work for the Iraqi
government. He saw nine of these extended family members when he was in Iraq for his
uncle’s funeral in February 2017, including a cousin who has worked in intelligence for
the Iraqi government since  July  2014.  He has  otherwise  had  no  contact  with  these 15
family members in Iraq since January 2007. CI agent reviewers considered Applicant to
be  a  potential  security  risk  because  of  Applicant’s  renewal  and  use  of  a  current  Iraqi
passport to depart Iraq in February 2017 and his family members’ employment with Iraq’s
government,  particularly  in  light  of  his  older  brother’s  employment  and  a  cousin’s
intelligence duties. (Item 4.)
On October 30, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for
the  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM).  Applicant  stated  that  company  X  took
possession  of  his  current Iraqi passport  about  a month prior to  his  OPM  interview.  He
also stated that he would renounce his Iraqi citizenship as soon as he is granted a security
clearance and  that  he  had  signed  a  renouncement form at  his CI  screening  in  August
2017.  (Item  5.)  Available  records  from  that  CI  screening  (Item  4)  do  not  include  any
renunciation  form  or  other  document  showing  action  taken  to  renounce  his  Iraqi
citizenship.  When  asked  about  his  contacts  with  family  members  in  Iraq,  Applicant
provided  information  consistent  with  what  he  had  said  during  his  CI  with  some  limited
exceptions.  He  related  that  he  has  not  had  any  contact  since  2007  with  some  of  his
extended family in Iraq, including no contact with the cousin who works in intelligence for
the Iraqi government. He disclosed his travel to Iraq for his uncle’s funeral, but there is no
indication that he told the OPM investigator that he saw several members of his extended
family at the funeral. (Item 5.)
By  way  of  interrogatories,  DOHA  provided  a  copy  of  a  summary  report  of  his
October 2017 OPM interview for his review. On January 5, 2019, Applicant adopted the
summary as accurate with a few corrections, including that a friend discussed during the
interview was living in the United States and not Baghdad. Applicant also responded to
foreign influence inquiries. He disclosed his previous service in Iraq’s National Guard. He
provided  information  about his relatives  in  Iraq,  which  showed  no changes  in the Iraqi
government employments of his family members from what he had reported during his
August 2017 CI screening. Applicant denied that he has any foreign financial interests,
while also reporting that he had a new employer since March 2018 and was working as
an  electronics  technician.  Applicant  answered  “Yes”  to  whether  he  currently  holds  a
foreign passport because company X had returned his valid Iraqi passport to him “about
3 months ago.” He had not used that passport since he departed Iraq for the United States
in February 2017. (Item 5.)
As of August 30, 2017, Applicant reported financial assets in the United States of
$5,700,  consisting  of  a  2008  model-year  vehicle  worth  $2,000  and  $3,700  in  bank
savings. He owed $21,853 on a federal student loan, $1,716 on a credit loan, $2,926 on
a car loan, and $14,540 in credit-card debt. His monthly net income was $4,542, and after
paying expenses and debts, he had $18 in discretionary income. (Item 4.) In response to
DOHA interrogatories, Applicant did not provide updated information about his finances
other than to indicate that he is making more money in his current job, which he started
in March 2018. Applicant has no foreign financial assets, and he does not expect to inherit
any property in Iraq. He denies voting or exercising any rights of his Iraqi citizenship since
immigrating  to  the  United  States  in  July  2009.  (Item  5.) There  is  no  information  in  the
record about whether Applicant has voted in the United States or whether he is involved
in community or other activities in the United States.
Administrative Notice
Administrative  or  official  notice  is  the  appropriate  type  of  notice  used  for
administrative  proceedings.  See  ISCR  Case  No.  16-02522  at  2-3  (App.  Bd.  July  12,
2017); ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n. 1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-
24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb.
10, 2004) and McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n. 4
(3d Cir. 1986)). Usually administrative notice at ISCR proceedings is accorded to facts
that are either well known or from government reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW,
Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice).
After reviewing the source documents relied on by the Government, I have taken
administrative notice of the facts set forth in the Government’s October 31, 2019 request
and incorporate them by reference in this decision. For additional background information
regarding Iraq’s relationship with the U.S., I have reviewed the U.S. State Department’s
Bilateral Relations Fact Sheet, issued for Iraq on November 13, 2019. Consistent with my
obligation to consider updated information in Guideline B cases, I have received the latest
State Department travel advisory for Iraq issued on January 11, 2020. Of particular note
are the following salient facts.
Iraq is a constitutional parliamentary republic. With the assistance of the United
States  and  in  coordination  with  the  Global  Coalition  to  Defeat  ISIS,  Iraq  liberated  its
territory from ISIS in December 2017. The United States increased its efforts to stabilize
liberated  areas  as  Iraq  continues  to  develop  as  a  sovereign,  stable,  and  self-reliant
country. Iraq is now considered a key partner of the United States in the region and as a
voice  of  moderation  and  democracy  in  the  Middle  East.  Iraq  benefits  from  functioning
government  institutions,  including  an  active  legislature.  The  United  States  maintains
vigorous and broad engagement with Iraq on diplomatic, political, economic, and security
issues  in  accord  with  the  U.S.-Iraq  Strategic  Framework  Agreement.  Since  2014,  the
United  States  has  contributed  billions  of  dollars  in  humanitarian,  de-mining,  and
stabilization  aid  to  conflict-affected  and  displaced  Iraqis  in  the  region.  U.S.  security
assistance programs support the development of a professional Iraqi military capable of
defending Iraq and its borders, responding to threats, and conducting counterterrorism
operations, and promote civilian oversight of the military, adherence to the rule of law,
and respect for human rights. Iraq’s efforts to transition to a market-oriented economy are
aided  by  a  significant  increase  in  investment  by  U.S.  companies  in  Iraq  in  the  last  ten
years.  To  increase  trade,  the  United  States  has  designated  Iraq  as  a  beneficiary
developing country under the Generalized System of Preferences program.
Parliamentary  elections  in  Iraq  in  2018  were  imperfect  but  generally  met
international standards of free and fair elections and led to the peaceful transition of power
to Prime Minister Adil Abd al-Mahdi. However, some human rights abuses persisted. In
2018, civilian authorities did not maintain effective control over some elements of the Iraq
Security Forces (ISF), particularly certain units of the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF)
aligned  with  Iran  that  were  implicated  in  unlawful  or  arbitrary  killings.  Other  significant
human  rights  abuses  included  forced  disappearances;  torture  and  arbitrary  arrest  and
detention; arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy; restrictions on free expression,
the press, and the Internet, including censorship; legal restrictions on free movement by
women; widespread official corruption; unlawful recruitment or use of child soldiers by the
Iran-aligned  PMF;  trafficking  in  persons;  and  criminalization  of  lesbian,  gay,  bisexual,
transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) status and conduct. Impunity existed for government
officials and security force personnel.
ISIS  continued  to  carry  out  deadly  attacks  and  kidnappings  in  Iraq,  resorting
increasingly  to  targeted  assassinations  of  police  and  local  political  leaders  through
shootings and improvised explosive devices (IEDs). With the cooperation of the United
States and  the  international community,  Iraq  improved  its  ability  to  detect  and  prevent
terrorist  threats  and  in  disrupting  terrorist  activities  by  detaining,  arresting,  and  trying
thousands  of  suspected  terrorists  in  2018.  Border  security  remained  a  critical  gap  in
capability as the ISF had limited capability to fully secure Iraq’s borders with Syria and
Iran. Iraqi Shia militants conducted several attacks against U.S. diplomatic facilities in Iraq
in September 2018 and December 2018. In January 2019, the U.S. Director of National
Intelligence expressed that the PMF Shia militias supported by Iran remained the primary
threat to U.S. personnel in Iraq and that the threat is expected to increase as the tension
between Iran and the United States increases.
As of January 11, 2020, the U.S. State Department’s travel advisory for Iraq was
Level 4: Do Not Travel due to terrorism, kidnapping, and armed conflict. U.S. citizens in
Iraq are considered to be at high risk for violence and kidnapping. Terrorist and insurgent
groups  active  in  Iraq  regularly  attack  both  Iraqi  security  forces  and  civilians.  Anti-U.S.
sectarian militias threaten U.S citizens and Western companies throughout the country.
Effective December 31, 2019, the U.S. Embassy suspended public consular services until
further notice because of the damage inflicted by Iranian-backed terrorist attacks on the
Embassy  compound.  Operations  at  the  U.S.  Consulate  General  in  Basra  have  been
suspended  since  October  18,  2018.  U.S.  Embassy  personnel  in  Baghdad  have  been
instructed not to use Baghdad International Airport due to security concerns.

"Applicant is 50 years old. He was born and lived in Iraq until age 22. He and his
wife married in 2003, and they have three children, ages 15, 14, and 10.  His wife and
children were also born in Iraq. He and his family came to the United States in 2010 under
a  special  refugee  visa  program,  based  on  his  work,  starting  in  October  2004,  as  a
linguist/interpreter for a company supporting U.S and coalition force training programs in
Iraq. They all became permanent U.S. residents in 2011, and became naturalized U.S.
citizens in August 2015. (GE 1; GE 2; GE 3; AE B; Tr. 26-40.)
Applicant  earned  an  associate’s  degree  in  Iraq  in  1990,  and  certification  as  an
HVAC technician in 2015 from a college in the United States. From 2010 until 2017 he
worked  full-time  in  several  security  guard,  maintenance,  and  HVAC  technician  jobs,
except for a brief part-time employment in 2015 and 2016. He has been employed since
May  2017  by  a  defense  contractor  as  a  contract  linguist,  to  serve  overseas  in  direct
support of U.S. Army units. He renounced his Iraqi citizenship and applied for a security
clearance  in  connection  with  that  position.  His  wife  is  currently  a  preschool/daycare
teacher, and his children attend local schools, in the United States. (GE 1; GE 2; GE 3;
Tr. 26-40.)
Applicant’s  mother  and  father  are  deceased.  He  has  seven  brothers  and  four
sisters, who are all citizens and residents of Iraq. His wife’s parents and siblings are also
Iraqi  citizens  and  residents.  Several  of  these  relatives  are  employed  by  civilian
government  agencies,  but  none  have  any  connection  to  Iraqi  defense  or  intelligence
agencies.  Except  for  one  brother,  Applicant  has  intentionally  avoided  contact  with  his
family members in Iraq for many years, as further discussed below. He also has numerous
Iraqi aunts, uncles, and cousins who reside there. Two of his cousins, with whom he has
had no contact for years, served and retired from careers in the Iraqi armed forces. (GE
2; GE 3; AE C; Tr. 35, 41-49, 53-65.)
1 HE I is the Government Exhibit Index.
Although Applicant obtained regular employment in the United States, he did not
earn enough money to satisfactorily  house and support his family until he obtained his
present job after returning from a 20-day visit to Iraq in May 2017. He explained, in his
June 2017 counterintelligence-screening interview, that his wife and children had returned
to reside in Iraq in March 2017 because his wife was depressed and was having a hard
time adjusting to life in the U.S. They rented a home in Iraq so she could live near her
family. Applicant wired them about $500 per month for living expenses, while he lived in
a  homeless  shelter  and  sought  better  work  in  the  United  States.  In  September  2017,
Applicant’s wife and children moved back to the United States. They have repaid  their
temporarily  delinquent  debts from that period, and  purchased  a  house  with  the  greatly
increased income he earns working for the defense contractor. (GE 1; GE 2; GE 3; Tr.
35-38, 46-50.)
During his June 6, 2017 interview with an investigator from the Office of Personnel
Management (OPM), Applicant explained that he:
has not maintained any contact with his various brothers and sisters, except
with his brother [A], whom [he] will speak with daily to monthly on the phone.
[He] is not close to his brothers and sisters as he does not trust that they
could  reasonably  keep  private  that  he  lives  in  the  US  and  is  considering
working as a contractor for the US Army in Iraq. He fears for his wife and
children’s safety if this information stumbled into the wrong hands, like that
of an anti-US or terrorist group. [He] clarified none of his family members
are involved in any anti-US activities, but fears they could accidentally share
what [he] does and as a result that information could trickle to other people
and ultimately end up putting [him] in danger. [He] only trusts that his brother
[A] would keep this information absolutely private, hence why they still have
communication.
Applicant testified during his hearing that his family members know that he lives in
the  United States,  but  only  his  brother  [A]  knows  that he  “is  working for Americans” in
Iraq. He further explained:
Nobody  knows  other  than  him,  so  all  my  brothers  I  did  not  tell  them  I’m
working  for  Americans.  .  .  .  They  are  all  in  danger,  you  know,  because
they’ve  been  in  danger  when  I  was  working  here.  Now,  as  long  as  I’m
outside, I don’t see them, so . . . they are safe. . . . [I have not been in touch
with  them  at  all  since  2010],  the  main  reason,  because  I  work  with  the
Americans, so I cut all my relationship for their safety. I used to see them
every day but . . . [Brother A], he got to take the risk because I got to have
contact with someone. (Tr. 57-62.)
Describing his and his family’s experience moving to the United States he testified,
“I’m  feeling  American.  So  I’m  -  -  this  is my  country.  So  even  my  kids,  my  family,  they
started to feel American. So that’s it. We kind of lost connection with the Iraqi citizenship;
now everything became - - we start to integrate into American society.” He said that he
would continue to be loyal to America, that he no longer considers Iraq to be his home
country. He said that a friend and coworker had been shot and died a month earlier while
serving as a linguist in Iraq, but he does not care about the danger associated with his
work there because he feels he is doing the right thing. (Tr. 51-52.)
Applicant provided character reference letters and a certificate of commendation
related to his work in Iraq as a linguist/interpreter from 2004 to 2008. He explained that
he did not obtain any evaluations or letters from his more recent employment because he
only worked with people for a few months at a time so he could not ask them for a letter.
(AE A; Tr. 65-66.)
I  have  taken  administrative  notice  of  facts  contained  in  U.S.  Government
publications  concerning  the  state  of  Iraq,  as  outlined  on  pages  2  through  6  of  HE  II,
including  the  following:  Iraq  faces  many  challenges  fueled  by  sectarian  and  ethnic
divisions. Numerous terrorist groups and anti-U.S. sectarian militias are active throughout
Iraq. The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) no longer controls a portion of the country’s
territory, but remains active in both countries and controls some areas of Syria along the
border.  Threats  of  terrorist  attacks,  kidnapping,  and  violence  are  high  from  ISIS  and
Iranian-backed Shia militias. The Department of State  has advised U.S. citizens not to
travel to Iraq, and U.S. Government personnel assigned to duty in Iraq are required to
live and work under strict security guidelines. Additionally, human-rights-related problems
including kidnappings for ransom, disappearances, torture, and attacks against civilians
have been noted.

"Applicant  is  a  62-year-old  Arab  linguist  with  a  pending  employment  offer  with  a
defense  contractor,  contingent  on his security  eligibility.  He  is fluent  in  Arabic,  French,
and English. In 2001, he applied for a linguist position with a government law enforcement
agency,  but  failed  to  pass  a  polygraph  examination  for  allegedly  manipulating  his
responses  and  failing  to  disclose  his  affiliation  with  a  former  Syrian  Army  intelligence
officer. From 2003 to 2005, he was employed as a linguist and translator in Iraq for a U.S.
defense contractor. He worked with U.S. Army members that were training Iraqi military
personnel,  and  with  U.S.  military  Judge  Advocates  working  with  the  Central  Criminal
Court of Iraq. While in Iraq, Applicant had an interim DOD security clearance, but stated
that he resigned before a final eligibility was determined. In 2009, Applicant applied for
another linguist position but was not retained because he was denied an interim security
clearance due to his foreign business involvement. (GEs 5 and 7) Of note, in his personal
subject interview (PSI) in December 2017, he claimed that he was unaware of ever having
a security clearance denied, despite his admitted knowledge in 2010. (GEs 3 and 7)
Applicant was born in Lebanon, and met his former spouse while traveling in the
United  States.  He married  in  1983 and  applied for U.S.  permanent  residency.  He  was
naturalized a U.S. citizen in 1988. He divorced his spouse in 1995. He has one adult child
who is a U.S. citizen and resident. He received a bachelor’s degree in 1981 in Lebanon.
Applicant stated that he served three months in the Lebanese Army after graduating from
high  school,  from  December  1975  to  March  1976,  but  claimed  that  the  Army  was
“dissolved” and he was released from training. (GE 2) Applicant failed to report his military
service in his 2009 or July 2017 SCAs, or in counterintelligence screening interviews in
2009 and 2010, because he did not consider it military service if he did not complete his
training or fight. His claim of short-term military service in Lebanon was finally disclosed
in his September 2017 counterintelligence screening interview. (GE 2)
The SOR alleges under Guideline B, that Applicant’s brother and sister-in-law are
citizens  and  residents of  Lebanon.  Under Guideline  F, Applicant  is alleged  to have  13
delinquent  financial  accounts  that  have  been  charged  off  or  are  in  collections,  totaling
about $146,775. He admitted the Guideline B and F allegations in his answer to the SOR.
Under Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have deliberately falsified material facts in prior
security questionnaires and interviews; and failed to disclose the financial delinquencies
alleged under Guideline F in his July 2017 SCA. He denied these allegations in his answer
to the SOR.
Applicant  has  a  brother  and  sister-in-law  who  are  citizens  and  residents  of
Lebanon. His brother is 71 years old and retired, and his sister-in-law was a homemaker
who is now in a nursing home. Applicant last visited Lebanon in 2009, and communicates
with  his  brother  about  once  every  two  months.  Applicant’s  sister  is  a  naturalized  U.S.
citizen residing in the United States. His parents are deceased.
Applicant testified that when he returned from Iraq in 2005, he was wealthy and
did not work for years thereafter. He testified that he last earned income in 2009, but his
2017  security  screening  interview  does  not  support  that.  (GE  2)  He  claimed  that  he
remained  unemployed  for  the  majority  of  the  years  since,  but  that  he  worked  as  a
freelance  translator  for  a  government  agency  from  2012  to  2016.  In  his  2017
counterintelligence screening interview, he claimed that he worked for the agency until
2017,  and  that  he  left  the  employment  because  he  did  not  want  to  read  from  a
teleprompter in a courtroom for a trial. He claimed to have sold cars for a dealership in
2015, and attempted to open a sandwich shop and invest in a health care business, but
these  business  endeavors were  unsuccessful.  He  lived  off of  credit  cards  and  savings
when necessary. (GE 2) At the hearing, he did not know how much he earned in 2016,
but stated that he had no income in 2017, 2018, or 2019.
Applicant claimed in 2009 and 2010 counterintelligence screening interviews that
he sold and shipped cars to Lebanon as part of an oral agreement with a U.S. dealership,
but left the employment because he was not making enough money. He described his
association with the owner of the dealership as a “partnership,” and stated that he shipped
four to five vehicles to Lebanon as part of a scheme to sell the vehicles in Lebanon with
the help of his brother who worked as the area manager for the Lebanese port authority.
He  later  recanted  statements  about  being  a  partner  with  the  car  dealer,  and  denied
shipping any vehicles to Lebanon. (GEs 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 7)
Applicant admitted that he fabricated his involvement with the international car deal
scheme  and  denied  any  foreign  shipments  of  vehicles.  He  never had  a  foreign  export
license. (GE 3) In a 2010 affidavit, Applicant admitted that he intentionally and wrongfully
asked his friend, the used-car dealer, to “vouch” for his employment as a “partner” for the
purpose of selling and transporting cars to his brother in Lebanon. He later stated that he
never made an attempt to sell or ship cars to Lebanon, and never made any income from
the effort. (GE 7) He claimed that he fabricated his involvement in order to embellish his
resume and to attempt to show consistent employment. (GEs 2 and 7) Despite claiming
that he arranged deals in Lebanon with his brother and a Lebanese car dealer he met
while visiting his brother in 2009, he later denied knowing who he made the deal with in
Lebanon and denied his brother’s involvement. (GE 2)
In his affidavit, he stated:
I do not want to hide anything now. The reason I made such a claim was
that  I  was  embarrassed  for  the  lack  of  employment  or  employers  on  my
resumes and that when I presented them, they would not show a continuity
of  employment  activity.  I  was  under  the  impression  that  this  looked
unfavorable to prospective clients, business partners and employers.
In  the  past,  I  have  lied  about  my  affiliation  and  purpose  with  (the  car
dealership).  I  have  none  at  all.  I  have  provided  false  statements  on  my
security forms on two separate submissions and in two counterintelligence
briefings with the U.S. Army out of Ft, Meade, MD. I can only claim that my
misrepresentation of myself was as a result of business related preservation
of  my  resumes  [sic]  continuity  and  to  selfishly  not  look  like  I  was
unemployed as I was from Jan 06 to Mar 09. I take full responsibility. (GE
7)
Applicant  did  not  report  any  delinquent  debts  in  his  July  2017  SCA.  (GE  1)
However,  he  was  confronted  in  his  September  2017  counterintelligence  screening
interview with several delinquent debts for which he said he did not have the money to
pay. (GE 2) He stated in his December 2017 PSI, that he depleted his financial resources
in about 2016 and he has been living off of credit cards with no steady income. He was
confronted  with  several  delinquent  accounts,  and  he  acknowledged  them  all.  (GE  3)
Applicant  claimed  during  the  hearing  in  this  case,  that  he  was  unaware  of  financial
delinquencies  when he  completed  his  2017 SCA  and that  he  was always  on  time  and
never late on credit card payments before he submitted his SCA. (AE D) However, in his
post-hearing submission, he acknowledged that he had “some late payments and fees
assessed to my accounts,” but that he only discovered them after the hearing and that he
did not realize he had the delinquencies when he completed his SCA. (AE D) Of note, in
his  2010  Affidavit,  Applicant  stated  that  his financial  situation  was  manageable  for  the
time being, but that he went from $230,000 in savings to about $20,000 in 2010, with no
earned income at that time.
Applicant  testified  that  he  did  not  attempt  to  settle,  pay,  or  otherwise  resolve
delinquent debts before filing bankruptcy in 2019. His delinquent financial accounts were
included in a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, filed in May 2019 (after the SOR was issued), and
discharged in August 2019.  Approximately $281,000 was discharged in the bankruptcy.
He received financial counseling as required by the bankruptcy process.
Applicant testified that he has no current income, and has about $10,000 in bank
accounts, and about $30,000 in equity in his home, valued at about $150,000. However,
Applicant testified that he has received $2,000 per month since March 2018, from a doctor
friend  he  has  known  for  20  years  who  is  also  a  member  of  Applicant’s  fraternal
organization.  Applicant  did  not  declare  this  income  in  his  bankruptcy  because  he
considers it a gift, not a loan. Applicant stated that his friend said he could pay it back if
he wants, and Applicant indicated his intention to pay it back. The money is transferred
monthly to Applicant’s bank account, and there is no written agreement. He has received
about $30,000 as of September 2019, and it is unclear whether payments have continued
since  then.  Since  the  bankruptcy,  no  documentary  information  has  been  submitted
regarding Applicant’s income, expenses, debts, budget, employment, or other financial
information.
Applicant’s friend and personal representative at the hearing testified on his behalf.
He  is  a  retired  juvenile  probation  officer  and  teaches  at  a  community  college.  He  has
known  Applicant  since  1987  and  they  spend  significant  time  together.  He  attested  to
Applicant’s love for America, compassion, and elation to be an American citizen and vote.
He said that Applicant wanted to work for the U.S. military after the attacks on the United
States  on  9/11,  and  is  a  walking  example  of  someone  who  loves  God  and  country.
Another witness,  a  retired  U.S. Army  Sergeant  Major,  had daily  contact  with  Applicant
while  in  Iraq.  He  described  Applicant  as  having  performed  a  tremendous  job  as  a
translator and recommended him for future work. Several military officers recommended
Applicant for employment positions in 2004 and 2005, attested to his performance and
accomplishments as an interpreter in Iraq; and a friend who is a local jeweler attested to
Applicant’s honesty and trustworthiness, saying he leaves the keys to his jewelry store
with a million dollars in inventory with Applicant when he is on vacation. Applicant also
received a certificate from his employer for 18 months of faithful service in Iraq.

“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants
eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information  “only  upon  a  finding  that  it  is  clearly
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865 § 2.
National  security  eligibility  is  predicated  upon  the  applicant  meeting  the  criteria
contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.
Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies
these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An
administrative  judge  must  consider  a  person’s  stability,  trustworthiness,  reliability,
discretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG ¶ 1(b).
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with
access  to  classified  information.  This  relationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the
possible  risk  that  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard
classified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible
extrapolation  about  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified
information.
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” Exec. Or. 10865
§ 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant
has  not  met  the  strict  guidelines  the  President  and  the  Secretary  of  Defense  have
established for issuing a clearance.
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the
personal or professional history  of  the applicant  that  may  disqualify  the  applicant from
being  eligible  for  access  to  classified  information.  The  Government  has  the  burden  of
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. “Substantial
evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.” See v. Washington
Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a
nexus  or  rational  connection  between  proven  conduct  under  any  of  the  criteria  listed
therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3
(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015).
Once  the  Government  establishes  a  disqualifying  condition  by  substantial
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition,
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No.
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-
20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if
they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG ¶ 1(d).
Guideline B: Foreign Influence
",True
"Applicant admitted SOR allegations1.a through 1.f. He denied allegation 1.g. He
also  submitted  additional  information  in  his  Answer  and  Applicant  Exhibit  A.  After  a
thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  testimony,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant is 38 years old and married with one child. He has a master’s degree.
He is applying for national security eligibility and a security clearance in connection with
his employment with a defense contractor as a global intelligence analyst.
Paragraph 1 – Guideline B (Foreign Influence)
Applicant  is  a  native-born  American  citizen.  From  2005  through  2008  Applicant
lived and worked in Taiwan. He met his wife, a native-born citizen of Taiwan, during this
period.  Applicant  and  his  wife  were  married  in  the  United  States  in  2008.  They  have
lived in the United States since that time. She became a naturalized American citizen in
2013. Applicant and his wife have one native-born American child. (Item 2 at Sections
11, 12, and 17; Item 3.)
Applicant’s  mother-in-law,  father-in-law,  and  brother-in-law  are  citizens  and
residents of Taiwan. Applicant has minimal contact with these relatives of his wife. He
travels  to  Taiwan  approximately  once  every  two  years  so  his  wife  can  visit  her  family.
Otherwise his contact is limited to occasional contact over Skype or telephone. None of
these  people  have  any  connection  to  the  Taiwanese  government.  (Answer;  Applicant
Exhibit A.)
Applicant’s  wife  worked  for a Taiwanese  government  organization  in  the  United
States from 2009 until about the time she became an American citizen in 2013. Her job
was  clerical  in  nature.  Since  leaving  this  employment  Applicant’s  wife  has  maintained
social contact with several former co-workers. Her closest contact currently works for an
American police department. (Answer; Item 3; Applicant Exhibit A.)
Applicant  was  interviewed  by  investigators  from  the  Office  of  Personnel
Management  (OPM)  in  2010  and  2017.  The  respective  Reports  of  Investigation  are
contained  in  Item  3.  During  both  investigations  Applicant  stated  his  wife  believed
another  employee  of  the  Taiwanese  organization  where  she  worked  was  a  possible
Taiwanese intelligence agent (Mr. A). Applicant’s wife had casual, work-related, contact
with Mr. A during her employment. Applicant met Mr. A twice in casual social situations.
They  have  had  no  contact  with  Mr.  A  since  Applicant’s  wife  left  that  employment  in
2013.  Item  3  shows  that  Applicant,  and  his wife,  freely  provided  extensive  information
about  this  person  to  each  investigator.  According  to  the  ROI,  Applicant’s  wife  stated,
“[Mr. A] worked in a division where everyone knew that the division dealt with National
Security  for  Taiwan.”  This  is  the  only  evidence  in  the  available  record  to  support  the
alleged fact that Mr. A was a Taiwanese intelligence agent.
Taiwan
Applicant  has  contacts  with  Taiwan.  Accordingly,  it  is  appropriate  to  look  at  the
current  situation  concerning  Taiwan.  Taiwan  is  a  multiparty  democracy,  whose
authorities  generally  respect  the  human  rights  of  its  citizens.  Taiwan  is  an  active
collector of industrial information and engages in industrial espionage, as shown by the
administrative  notice  documents  in  the  record.  However,  the  record  does  not
demonstrate that the Taiwanese government seeks to exert pressure on U.S. citizens to
collect information from family members residing in country or abroad. Finally, it is worth
noting  that  the  U.S.  Government,  and  the  Defense  Department  in  particular,  have  a
close  and  continuing  relationship  with  Taiwan  and  its  military,  in  accordance  with  the
Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, which has governed policy in the absence of diplomatic
relations or a defense treaty with Taiwan. In 2018 the Secretary of Defense stated, “The
Department  of  Defense  remains  steadfastly  committed  to  working  with  Taiwan  to
provide the defense articles and services necessary to maintain sufficient self-defense
consistent  with  our  obligation  set  out  in  our  Taiwan  Relations  Act.   We  oppose  all
unilateral  efforts  to  alter  the  status  quo,  and  will  continue  to  insist  any  resolution  of
differences  accord  with  the  will  of  the  people  on  both  sides  of  the  Taiwan  Strait.”

"Applicant is 37 and married. He and his wife have two boys. He seeks to obtain
national  security  eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information  in  connection  with  his
employment  as  a  Senior  Solutions  Architect  for  a  defense  contractor.  (Item  4  at
Sections 17 and 18.)
Paragraph 1 – Guideline B (Foreign Influence)
Applicant was born in the United States in 1982. His parents, who were born in
Iran,  were  living  in  the  United  States  at  the  time.  Applicant  lived  in  the  United  States
until he was 9 years old, when his family moved back to Iran. Applicant returned to the
United  States  in  1997  and  has  lived  here  continuously  since  that  time.  He  has  never
been  a  citizen  of  Iran.  He  has  not  traveled  to  Iran  since  moving  back  to  the  United
States. (Item 3 at Section 18; Item 5 at 2.) He attended high school and college in the
United States, and has worked for his present employer since January 2010. (Item 4 at
Sections 12 and 13A.)
Applicant’s wife is a naturalized American citizen. She was born in Canada. Her
parents are citizens of Canada, and are of Iranian descent. She is also employed in the
defense industry. (Item 2 at 39; Item 4 at Sections 17 and 18.)
Applicant’s  parents  moved  permanently  to  the  United  States  in  approximately
2011,  and  they  have  become  naturalized  American  citizens.  They  both  now  live  with
Applicant, since his mother has serious health issues. (Item 2 at 4.)
The following are the specific security concerns raised in the SOR:
(a) Applicant’s father worked for a local police department in Iran until he retired
in 1979, over 40 years ago. He is 79 years old. At one point he received a small pension
from  the  Iranian  government.  Applicant  does  not  believe  his  father  still  receives  a
pension. (Item 2 at 29; Item 6 at 5.)
(b)  Applicant  has  one  older  brother.  He  is  about  20  years  older  than  Applicant,
and they have little in common due to their age difference. Applicant’s brother is a dual
citizen  of  Iran  and  the  United  States,  and  currently  lives  in  Iran.  He  is  a  language
teacher. Applicant has not seen his brother since he moved back to Iran around 2016.
Applicant has had little contact of any kind with his brother since he returned to Iran. He
does not know his brother’s address in Iran. (Item 2 at 29; Item 6 at 5.)
(c) Applicant has one older sister. She is about 18 years older than Applicant and
they have little in common due to their age difference. Applicant’s sister is a dual citizen
of Iran and the United States, and currently lives in Iran. She is a housewife. Applicant
has not seen his sister since she moved back to Iran around 2016. Applicant has had
little contact of any kind with his sister since she returned to Iran. He does not know his
sister’s address in Iran. (Item 2 at 29; Item 6 at 5.)
Mitigation
Applicant  is  highly  respected  as  a  person,  and  as  a  successful  and  talented
engineer.  Letters  of  recommendation  were  provided  by  coworkers,  who  are  also
Applicant’s  personal  friends.  They  all  admire  his  professional  accomplishments,  and
view him as a trustworthy person worthy of national security eligibility. (Item 2 at 36-38,
40-42.)
On coworker, who has known Applicant since 2011, ended his letter:
In  conclusion,  if  it’s  a  matter  of  an  individual  displaying  integrity,  ethics,
honor and taking pride in themselves both personally and professionally, I
can  say  that  [Applicant]  has  all  those  qualities  .  .  .  as  well  as  an
abundance  of  other  positive  tangible  merits  that  I’ve  had  the  privilege  to
witness in person and . . . years to come.
Applicant’s work evaluations are consistently “Outstanding,” the highest ranking.
(Item  2  at  44-73.)  In  2016,  in  evaluating  areas  Applicant  needed  to  improve,  his
supervisor said, “He [Applicant] has been doing an outstanding job since he started in
2010. He believes he needs improvement in all areas. I believe he needs to spend more
time with his family and his children.” (Item 2 at 45.)
Over the years Applicant has also received many letters of appreciation from his
management. Many of these letters include laudatory comments from customers served
by Applicant. (Item 2 at 75-89.)
Iran
I take administrative notice of the following facts about Iran:
Iran is an authoritarian theocratic republic. The U.S. Department of State advises
American  citizens  not  to  visit  Iran  due  to  the  very  high  risk  of  kidnapping,  arrest  and
detention of U.S. citizens in Iran, particularly dual national Iranian-Americans. Iran has
been  designated  a  state  sponsor  of  terrorism  since  1984.  Iran  continues  to  present  a
cyber-espionage  and  attack  threat.  The  Iranian  government’s  human-rights  record  is
extremely poor. There are numerous reports of unlawful killings, forced disappearance
and torture. (Request for Administrative Notice: Attachments.)

willing to renounce his Nigerian citizenship if security officials request that he do so. (Tr.
28, 37; SOR response at 5)
Personal Conduct
In about April 2004, Applicant’s  spouse  obtained a domestic  violence  restraining
order  against  Applicant.  (SOR  response  to  ¶  3.b;  GE  7)  He  was  not  convicted  of  any
offense  as  a  result  of  the  April  2004  altercation  with  his  spouse.  (SOR  response  at  6)
Applicant  was  unable  to  remember  or  unwilling  to  disclose  details  of  the  April  2004
altercation with his spouse at his hearing. (Tr. 31, 54)
In June 2007, Applicant and his spouse had another physical altercation. She was
a petty officer first class, and Applicant and his spouse were living on base in government
housing overseas. (GE 6 at 9) They were in bed, and she was insulting him. (GE 6 at 9)
Applicant  described  the  physical  altercation  to  the  Naval  Criminal  Investigative  Service
(NCIS) as follows:
At some point, [she] started to try to push me out of the bed with her leg.
She was lying on her side as she was trying to push me out of the bed. She
was not able to get me out of the bed, but she kept on saying things to me
to hurt me, belittle me, and make me mad. [She] was lying face down on
her stomach, and I got on top of her to hold her down by lying on her with
my body. I was trying to stop her from continuing to say things to me so I
grabbed her with my hands by her face and head. I kept telling her to shut
up. [She] was struggling the whole time. I did not twist or turn [her] by her
head. I am sure she got the mark on her face when I was holding her by the
head, but I do not know how she got the other marks, shown [in the photos].
. . . I knew she was going to call security, so I unplugged the phone from
the wall. (GE 6 at 9-10)
Applicant  admitted  that  he  laid  on  top  of  his  spouse  and  grabbed  her  face  hard
enough to leave marks on her skin. (See SOR response to ¶ 3.a at 5 (admitting to mutual
physical  contacts  and  unhealthy  marital  conflicts)  The  NCIS  report  of  investigation
indicates  Applicant  and  his  spouse  engaged  in  a  physical  altercation,  and  they  both
sustained bruises. (GE 6) Applicant admitting pinning his spouse to the bed and grabbing
her by  the face and head. She  had  “bruises  and abrasions  to  her chest,  shoulder, and
face.”  (GE  6  at  2,  5) Applicant  had  “a  small  injury”  to  his  neck  and  thumb.  (AE  6  at  2)
Applicant’s commander ordered him to move out of base housing until further notice. (AE
6 at 5) Applicant told NCIS that there were two prior incidents involving the police, one
involving pushing in 2004, and one involving a verbal argument  (no physical contact) in
2006. (AE 6 at 5, 11) No adverse inference is drawn from the incident in 2006. He received
marital  counseling.  (SOR  response  at  5-6)  He  was  not  convicted  of  a  crime.  (SOR
response at 5; GE 6) Applicant was unable to remember or unwilling to disclose details of
the June 2007 altercation with his spouse at his hearing. (Tr. 30, 54)
On July 2, 2019, Applicant responded to the  domestic violence allegations in the
SOR. Applicant said, “[a]fter going to counseling and working together as a team, my wife
and I came out strong and closer than ever before. We have found healthy ways to handle
conflict, so I can say with utmost confidence that the behaviors from the past will not recur.”
(Tr. 54-56; SOR response at 6)
In August 2019, Applicant was upset with his spouse because he believed she was
having  an  extramarital  affair.  (Tr.  32-33)  Applicant  and  his  spouse  argued  for  several
hours.  (Unless  another  citation  is  indicated,  the  information  in  this  paragraph  is  from  a
police report, GE 5 at 4, 6-9) They engaged in mutual shoving. (Tr. 67) She took a photo
album into the kitchen and began burning photographs. (Tr. 67) His spouse said Applicant
pulled  her  hair,  pushed  her  into  the  sink,  grabbed  her  crotch,  and  made  negative
comments  about  her  crotch.  (Id.  at  4,  6)  Applicant  said  he  could  have  pulled  her  hair;
however, he did not remember pulling her hair. (Tr. 67-68) She responded by calling the
police. Applicant admitted the mutual pushing, and that he pushed her away from the stove
because she was trying to burn photos of his deceased father. (Id. at 4)
The police arrested Applicant for the August 2019 altercation, and Applicant was
charged with assault and battery. (Id. at 4, 9) Applicant told the magistrate “he pushed her
by  the  stove,  and  also  that  he  may  have  pulled  her  hair.”  (Id.  at  4)  The  disposition
information  relating  to  Applicant’s  assault  and  battery  charge  is  not  part  of  the  record.
Applicant  said  he  did  not  understand  whether  the  court  proceeding  included  a  plea  of
guilty. (Tr. 57, 64) On December 2, 2019, Applicant paid $450 to enable him to begin  a
court-ordered 18-week domestic violence course. (Tr. 33-34, 57-58; AE K) Applicant said
he started the course. (Tr. 34) Applicant said he will be on probation until October 2020.
(Tr. 58) He might be able to have the charges dismissed. (Tr. 66)
Financial Considerations
Applicant  is  currently  unemployed,  and  he  was  unemployed  from  July  2017,  to
January  2018,  and  from  June  2006,  to  August  2007.  (Tr.  28,  44-45;  GE  1;  GE  2  at  3)
Applicant said he was unable to pay some of his debts because of unemployment. (Tr. 35-
36) He has a 70 percent disability rating from the Department of Veterans Affairs. (Tr. 29)
The SOR alleges three delinquent debts totaling $34,013 as follows:
SOR  ¶  4.a  alleges  Applicant  has  a  charged-off  credit-card  debt  for  $20,140.
Applicant’s June 27, 2019 Equifax credit report indicates this debt was $5,879 past due,
and  was  reported  delinquent  in  May  2017.  (AE  D  at  21)  On  November  15,  2019,  the
creditor wrote the debt was settled for $12,175, and the debt is resolved. (Tr. 34, 64-65;
AE  J)  Applicant’s  January  6,  2020  TransUnion  credit  report  reflects  a  zero  balance,
“Account paid in Full; was a Charge-off,” and “SETTLED-LESS THAN FULL.” (AE R at 2)
SOR  ¶  4.b  alleges  Applicant  has  a  store  debt  placed  for  collection  for  $9,878.
Applicant’s June 27, 2019 Equifax credit report indicates the debt was in collections until
May 2019 when a $4,270 payment was due as a balloon payment. (AE D at 9-10) In June
2019,  the  creditor  sent  Applicant  a  bill  for  $4,270.  (AE  G)  Applicant’s  January  6,  2020
TransUnion credit report reflects a zero balance, “Account Paid in Full; was a Collection,”
and “SETTLED LESS THAN FULL.” (Tr. 34-35, 64-65; AE R at 3)
SOR ¶ 4.c alleges Applicant has a delinquent vehicle debt for $3,995. Applicant’s
June  27,  2019  Equifax  credit  report  indicates  the  debt  was  $3,769  past  due,  and  was
charged-off  in  the  amount  of  $16,026.  (AE  D  at  50)  The  debt  became  delinquent  in
September  2017.  (AE  D  at  50)  Applicant’s  January  6,  2020  TransUnion  credit  report
reflects a zero balance, “Account paid in Full; was a Charge-off,” and “SETTLED-LESS
THAN FULL.” (Tr. 35, 64-65; AE R at 6-7)
In addition to the SOR alleged debts, Applicant paid a charged-off credit-card debt
for $6,747 for less  than  the full  amount  in  April 2019.  (AE  D at  24-25) He  had multiple
accounts in “pays as agreed status,” including a mortgage for about $696,000. (AE D at
33-35) In July 2019, Applicant received financial counseling and generated a budget. (Tr.
36;  AE  E;  AE  S)  His  budget  indicated  his  net  monthly  income  is  $4,500;  his  monthly
expenses total $4,256; monthly debt payments are $525; and his monthly remainder is
$219.  (AE  E  at  3-4;  AE  S  at  3-4)  According  to  his  budget,  his  spouse  pays  part of  the
mortgage. (AE E at 3-4; AE S at 3-4) Applicant said he withdrew $50,000 from his Thrift
Savings Plan account and used the funds to pay all of his delinquent debts. (Tr. 44-45, 63)
Applicant has filed all of his state and federal tax returns for the previous five years.
Character Evidence
In 2019, Applicant received an excellent annual performance evaluation. (AE P) A
co-worker  who  has  known  Applicant  for  nine  months,  a  co-worker  and  friend  who  has
known him for two years, a friend who has known him for 10 years, a friend and co-worker
who has known him for more than three years, and a major who has known him for a year
provided letters supporting Applicant’s access to classified information. (AE I; AE Q) The
general sense of their letters is that Applicant is trustworthy, professional, diligent, highly
motivated, an exceptional leader, helpful, intelligent, and innovative. (AE I; AE Q) Applicant
provides important contributions to mission accomplishment. The letters did not indicate
his character references were aware of the contents of the SOR.
Nigeria
Nigeria  is  the  largest  economy  and  most  populous  country  in  Africa  with  an
estimated population of more than 190 million, which is expected to grow to 400 million
by 2050 and become the third most populous country in the world after China and India.
Nigeria had an estimated gross domestic product of 375 billion USD in 2018. Although
Nigeria’s economy has become more diversified, crude oil sales have continued to be the
main source of export earnings and government revenues. Despite persistent structural
weaknesses such as a deficient transportation infrastructure, the Nigerian economy grew
briskly for the decade ending in 2013. The growth rate slowed in 2014, owing in large part
to the fall in oil prices, and in 2016 and 2017 Nigeria experienced its first recession in over
two  decades  before  rebounding  in  2018.  The  gains  from  economic  growth  have  been
uneven; more than 60% of the population lives in poverty.
The United States is the largest foreign investor in Nigeria, with U.S. foreign direct
investment concentrated largely in the petroleum/mining and wholesale trade sectors. At
$2.2 billion in 2017, Nigeria is the second largest U.S. export destination in Sub-Saharan
Africa. The United States and Nigeria have a bilateral trade and investment framework
agreement. In 2017, the two-way trade in goods between the United States and Nigeria
totaled over $9 billion. . . .  Nigeria and the United States belong to a number of the same
international  organizations,  including  the  United  Nations,  International  Monetary  Fund,
World  Bank,  and  World  Trade  Organization.  Nigeria  also  is  an  observer  to  the
Organization of American States.
Nigeria  is  a  federal  republic  composed  of  36  states  and  the  Federal  Capital
Territory. In 2015, President Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressives Congress party
was elected to a four-year term in the first successful democratic transfer of power from
a  sitting  president  in  the  country’s  history.  In  February  2019,  he  was  re-elected  for  a
second  term.  Notwithstanding  important  steps  forward  on  consolidating  democracy,
Nigeria continues to face the formidable challenges of terrorist attacks, inter-communal
conflicts, crime, kidnapping, and public mistrust of the government.
The U.S. Department of State travel advisory for Nigeria is Level 3: Reconsider
Travel due to crime, terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, and maritime crimes; and
Level 4: Do Not Travel to Borno and Yobe States and Northern Adamawa State due to
terrorism.  (emphasis  in  original)  The  U.S.  Embassy  has  limited  ability  to  provide
emergency  services  to  U.S.  citizens  beyond  Abuja  and  Lagos  and  their  immediate
surrounding areas. U.S. Government employees are subject to movement constraints as
security conditions warrant. Both Abuja and Lagos are assessed by the Department of
State as being high-threat locations for terrorist activity directed at or affecting official U.S.
Government interests. U.S. Government personnel are currently prohibited from traveling
to Borno due to terrorist threats against United States and European citizens located in
Borno.
Boko Haram, and ISIS-West Africa, both of which are designated Foreign Terrorist
Organizations,  are  active  in  Nigeria.  Boko  Haram  seeks  to  replace  the  Nigerian
government with an Islamic state, establish an Islamic caliphate across Africa, avenge
military offenses against the group, and destroy any political or social activity associated
with Western society. It conducts attacks primarily on civilian and regional military targets.
ISIS-West Africa also seek to implement its strict interpretation of Sharia and replace the
Nigerian government with an Islamic state.
Boko  Haram  and  ISIS-West  Africa  continued  to  conduct  attacks  against
government  and  security  forces  in  the  northeast,  which  resulted  in  deaths,  injuries,
abductions,  and  the  capture  and  destruction  of  property.  Boko  Haram  attacks  did  not
appear  to  discriminate  between  civilians  and  government  officials,  whereas  ISIS-West
Africa  tended  to  generally  focus  on  government  and  security  forces,  while  trying  to
cultivate  stronger  ties  with  local  communities,  including  by  providing  limited  social
services.  The  Nigerian  military  has  expanded  its  presence  in  parts  of  northeastern
Nigeria, but the northeast remains an active zone of combat, as Boko Haram and ISIS-
West Africa insurgents continue to carry out attacks.
While  Boko  Haram  no  longer  controls  as  much  territory  as  it  once  did,  the  two
insurgencies nevertheless maintain the ability to stage forces in rural areas and launch
attacks against civilian and military targets across the northeast. Boko Haram continued
to employ indiscriminate suicide bombings targeting the local civilian populations. ISIS-
West  Africa  targeted  civilians  with  attacks  and  kidnappings  less  frequently  than  Boko
Haram, but employed targeted acts of violence and intimidation against civilians in order
to expand its area of influence and gain control over critical economic resources. As part
of a violent and deliberate campaign, ISIS-West Africa also targeted government figures,
traditional leaders, and contractors. Both groups have carried out more than 600 to 700
attacks  in  Nigeria  using  small  arms,  captured  military  equipment,  suicide  bombers,
improvised  explosive  devices  (IEDs),  vehicle-borne  (VB)  IEDs,  ambushes,  and
kidnappings.
In  2018,  Boko  Haram  recruited  and  forcefully  conscripted  child  soldiers,  and  it
carried  out  scores  of  suicide  bombings,  many  by  young  women  and  girls  forced  into
service. The group conducted abductions and subjected many abducted women and girls
to sexual and gender-based violence, including forced marriage and rape. The Nigerian
government investigated attacks by Boko Haram and ISIS-West Africa and took steps to
prosecute their members, although the majority of suspected insurgent group supporters
were held in military custody without charge.
Other human rights issues reported in Nigeria during 2018 included unlawful and
arbitrary killings, forced disappearances, and torture by both government and non-state
actors;  prolonged  arbitrary  detention  in  life-threatening  conditions,  particularly  in
government  detention facilities;  harsh and  life-threatening  civilian  detentions  in military
facilities,  often  based  on  flimsy  or  no  evidence;  and  infringement  on  citizens’  privacy
rights.  The  government  took  steps  to  investigate  alleged  abuses  but  fewer  steps  to
prosecute officials who committed violations. Impunity remained widespread at all levels
of government.

"Applicant is 41 years old. She was born and lived in Turkey until age 26, when she
moved to the United States for three and a half years to work, on an L-1 visa, for a Turkish
aerospace  company  in  collaboration  with  a  major U.S.  defense  contractor on a  NATO
foreign military sales contract. She met her husband, who is a native-born U.S. citizen,
through  their  work  during  that  period.  He  moved  to  Turkey  for  work  in  2007,  and  they
began dating after she moved back to Turkey in 2008. They married in Turkey in 2010,
and have no children. They moved back to the United States in 2012, and she became a
naturalized U.S. citizen in November 2012. (GE 1; GE 2; AE B.)
Applicant  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  aeronautical  engineering  at  a  Turkish
university  in  2001.  She  has  never  been  employed  in  military  or  civil  service  for  any
government. She worked, supporting NATO contracts, for two different Turkish aerospace
companies from 2003 to 2012, and was granted Turkish and NATO security clearances
in connection with that work. After she and her husband returned to the United States,
she  was  unemployed  until  resolving  her  legal  employment  status,  for  immigration
purposes, and then resumed employment in her area of expertise. (GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 39,
79-80, 96, 101-103.)
Applicant’s father is 87 years old. He is a lifelong citizen and resident of Turkey,
and now lives alone in the family’s condominium flat. He retired in 1996 from his position
as  a  personnel  manager  at  the  Turkish  Ministry  of  Health.  Applicant’s  mother  passed
away in 2014, at which point she, as her parent’s only child, automatically inherited 75%
ownership in the family flat. After recent exchange-rate fluctuations and an assessment
of  the  local  real  estate  market,  the  flat  is  estimated  to  be  worth  between  $36,000  and
$54,000.  Applicant  will  eventually  inherit  her  father’s  25%  interest  in  the  flat,  and  she
intends to sell it at that point. She has no intention of returning to Turkey, other than her
annual visits to see her father and check on his welfare. (Answer; GE 1; GE 2; GE 3; Tr.
43-46, 53, 80-84, 99.)
Several years ago, Applicant set up cable and cell phone services for her father’s
use.  She  arranged  to  make  automatic  payments  from  her  account  in  a  Turkish  bank,
because he did not know how to do that. During her last visit to see her father in Turkey,
she arranged for the payments to be made from his account, and closed hers, to avoid
generating perceived security clearance concerns. The former payments were modest,
and he does not depend on her for financial support in his retirement. She also closed, or
withdrew all funds, from her other bank accounts in Turkey. All of her financial assets are
now held in the United States. (Answer; Tr. 46-47, 85-88.)
Applicant listed four longtime friends from Turkey on her e-QIP. They are former
coworkers  she  and  her  husband  met  and  socialized  with  during  their  time  working  in
Turkey. They have only occasional and casual contact now, primarily discussing family
events or sharing a meal when she is in Turkey to visit her father. They do not discuss
each other’s work, and Applicant feels no obligation toward any of them beyond extending
common courtesies. (Answer; GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 38-39, 47-51, 84-85.)
In 2017, Applicant traveled to the closest Turkish consulate, which is located in a
Canadian city across the border, with some friends for a getaway weekend and to vote in
the Turkish election held that year. She traveled using her U.S. passport, but used her
Turkish  identity  card  to  document  her  eligibility  to  vote  in  the  election.  She  did  this
because she read a number of U.S. Government statements indicating the importance of
the election results for U.S.-Turkish relations, and wanted to vote in favor of the outcome
preferred  by  the  United  States.  She  has  no  intention  to  vote  in  any  future  Turkish
elections, and has voted in every U.S. election since she gained citizenship and eligibility
to vote. (Answer; GE 2; Tr. 40-42, 57-58, 88-91.)
From  about  2003  to  2011,  while  Applicant  worked  for  a  Turkish  aerospace
company involved in aircraft procurement programs in support of NATO, she held both
Turkish and NATO security clearances. These clearances were required for her NATO-
related  employment,  and  lapsed  after  she  left  that  employment  for  a  better  job,  then
moved to the United States with her husband. (Answer; GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 39, 102-103.)
Applicant’s  husband  and  two  of  her  current  coworkers  testified  concerning  her
excellent character, integrity, and dedicated loyalty to the United States as her adopted
country. She is an assiduous rule follower and complies with all measures and procedures
involving  protected,  sensitive,  and  classified  information.  She  has  immersed  herself  in
workplace, community, and national cultural events, customs, and practices. Five other
friends  and  coworkers  wrote  letters  expressing  similar  observations.  Applicant’s
testimony was direct, open, and impressive. (AE A; Tr. 37-103.)
I  have  taken  administrative  notice  of  facts  contained  in  U.S.  Government
publications concerning the Republic of Turkey, as outlined on pages 2 through 5 of HE
II, including the following: Turkey is a constitutional republic. It is a member of NATO and
the counter-ISIL coalition. On February 5, 2019, the United States and Turkey issued a
joint statement reaffirming the strategic importance of their relationship, and committed
to addressing shared concerns as allies. There are some conditions in Turkey that are
problematic, including ongoing activities by terrorist organizations, expanded state police
powers  implemented  to  address  them,  and  reports  of  some  significant  human  rights
issues. (HE II.)
",True
"Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations, with explanations. After a thorough
and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  testimony,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant is 48 years old and married, with one child. He is applying for national
security  eligibility  and  a  security  clearance  in  connection  with  his  employment  with  a
defense contractor as a hazardous material technician.
Paragraph 1 – Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and
Paragraph 2 – Guideline C (Foreign Preference)
The  Government  alleged  in  Paragraph  1  of  the  SOR  that  Applicant  is  ineligible
for  clearance  because  he  has  foreign  contacts  or  interests  that  may  result  in  divided
allegiance. The Government further alleged in Paragraph 2 of the SOR that Applicant is
ineligible for clearance because he has acted in such a way as to show a preference for
another country over the United States.
Applicant  was  born  in  the  Philippines  in  1971.  He  immigrated  to  the  United
States,  along  with  his  family,  in  1988.  Applicant  joined  the  US  Navy  in  1989.  He  was
naturalized as an American citizen in 1993. Applicant retired from the Navy as a Master
at Arms First Class (E-6) in 2009. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 9 and 15; Tr. 14-
15.)
Applicant met his wife while stationed in the United States. They were married in
1994. She is also a naturalized American citizen of Filipino ancestry. Their son was born
in the United States in 2001, and is about to join the US Navy. Applicant’s wife, son and
father, also an American citizen, all currently live in the Philippines. Once his son enlists
in  the  Navy,  the  plan  is  for  Applicant’s  wife  to  join  Applicant  in  the  country  where  he
currently works. Eventually, Applicant and his wife plan to return to the United States as
their primary residence. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 17 and 18; Tr. 15-16.)
Applicant  and  his  family  moved  to  the  Philippines  after  his  retirement  in  2009.
Applicant  reacquired  Philippine  citizenship  in  2009,  in  expectation  of  living  full-time  in
the  Philippines.  He  lived  in  the  Philippines with  his family  until 2015,  when  he  went  to
work for the Navy as a contractor in another country. When in the Philippines during that
period,  Applicant  went  to  school.  (Government  Exhibit  1  at  Section  12,  Government
Exhibit 2 at 7; Tr. 17-18.)
Applicant’s wife, with minimal help from Applicant, ran a chicken rotisserie stand
business in the Philippines for about three years. The business closed in 2015 or 2016
due to unprofitability. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section 20A; Tr. 18-19.)
While living in the Philippines, Applicant and his wife bought a house and some
land.  The  house  is  worth  approximately  $138,000.  The  land  is  worth  about  $32,000.
Applicant  plans  to  sell  the  land,  since  he  and  his  wife  have  decided  not  to  build  on  it.
(Government Exhibit 1 at Section 20A; Tr. 19-21.)
In  connection  with  the  business,  and  the  properties  they  purchased,  Applicant
and his wife had three bank accounts in the Philippines. None of the accounts had a lot
of  money,  and  at  least  one  of  them  has  been  closed.  (Government  Exhibit  2  at  8;
Applicant Exhibits F and G; Tr. 22.)
Applicant realized that he would have to renounce his Philippine citizenship when
he went back to work with the Navy. To that end, he renounced that citizenship in the
presence  of  his  security  officer  on  February  10,  2016  He  also  had  his  Philippine
citizenship  document  destroyed,  and  verified  his  allegiance  only  to  the  United  States.
(Government Exhibit 2 at 6, Government Exhibit 3; Tr. 21-22.)
Applicant provided a copy of his most recent American passport, valid from April
2013 to April 2023. That passport showed many Filipino visa stamps during the period
Applicant still had dual citizenship with the Philippines. (Applicant Exhibit C.)
Paragraph 3 – Guideline E (Personal Conduct)
The  Government  alleged  in  this  paragraph  that  Applicant  is  ineligible  for
clearance because he  made  intentional misstatements  on  an Electronic Questionnaire
for  Investigations  Processing  he  filled  out  on  February  15,  2016.  (Government  Exhibit
1.)  Applicant  argued  that  any  misstatements  he  made  on  the  form  were  mistakes  and
unintentional on his part.
3.a.  Section  17  of  Government  Exhibit  1  concerns  Applicant’s  marital  status.  In
answering  that  question  Applicant  properly  identified  his  spouse,  that  she  was  born  in
the  Philippines,  and  was  an  American  citizen.  The  questionnaire  also  asked,  “Provide
your  spouse’s  country(ies)  of  citizenship.”  Applicant  stated  that  his  wife  was  an
American  citizen.  He  did  not  further  identify  her  as  also  being  a  dual  citizen  of  the
Philippines.  Applicant  testified  that  he  misread  the  questionnaire  on  that  point,  noting
that it is formatted differently than Section 10 of Government Exhibit 1, which concerned
Applicant’s dual or multiple citizenship information. (Tr. 23-25.)
3.b. Section 20A of Government Exhibit 1 concerns Applicant’s foreign activities.
Under  that  section,  he  identified  his  wife  as  the  owner  of  the  chicken  rotisserie  stand
described above. Applicant did not identify himself as being a co-owner. Applicant was
interviewed  by  an  investigator  for  the  State  Department  on  June  29,  2016.  In  that
interview he identified the business, stated it was not doing well financially, and that his
wife  was  going  to  close  it  down.  Applicant’s  involvement  in  this  business  was  passive
and minimal. (Government Exhibit 2 at 7-8; Tr. 25, 33.)
3.c.  Section  20A  goes  on  to  ask  about  foreign  property  that  is  owned  by
Applicant.  He  properly  identified  the  house  as  belonging  to  himself  and  his  wife.  He
stated that the additional property was owned by his cohabitant. Applicant testified that
he  was  confused  by  this  answer  himself,  since  it  was  obviously  wrong.  Applicant  told
the State Department investigator in June 2016 that the additional property was owned
by  himself  and  his  wife,  as  shown  in  the  Report  of  Investigation  (ROI).  (Government
Exhibit 2 at 8; Tr. 25-27.)
3.d. Finally, Section 20A asks about any bank accounts Applicant may have in a
foreign country. Applicant did not identify the three bank accounts he and his wife had in
the Philippines. Applicant fully identified these accounts during his June 2016 interview,
after admitting to the interviewer that he should have listed them. Applicant testified that
he  overlooked  the  specific  part of  the  question  that  concerned  foreign  bank  accounts.
(Government Exhibit 2 at 8; Tr. 27-29.)
Mitigation
Applicant  had  a  successful  20-year  career  in  the  Navy.  He  received  many
personal decorations. In addition, he has been successful after his return to the Navy as
a  civilian  employee,  as  shown  by  positive  evaluations  and  commendations.  (Applicant
Exhibits A, B, and E.)
The Philippines
I take administrative notice of the following facts. The Philippines is a multi-party
constitutional  republic.  There  are  terroristic  threats  in  several  parts  of  the  Philippines,
particularly  in  the  south.  In  addition,  there  are  allegations  of  human  rights  abuses  by
members of the security forces.
The State Department’s “U.S. Relations With the Philippines: Bilateral Relations
Fact Sheet” states:
U.S.-Philippine  relations  are  based  on  strong  historical  and  cultural
linkages and a shared commitment to democracy and human rights. The
1951 U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty provides a strong foundation
for  our  robust  security  partnership,  which  began  during  World  War  II.
Strong people-to-people ties and economic cooperation provide additional
avenues  to  engage  on  a  range  of  bilateral,  regional,  and  global  issues.
The  U.S.-Philippine  Bilateral  Strategic  Dialogue  is  the  annual  forum  for
forward planning across the spectrum of our relationship. There are more
than four million U.S. citizens of Philippine ancestry in the United States,
and more  than  350,000  U.S.  citizens  in  the  Philippines,  including  a  large
number  of  United  States  veterans.  An  estimated  650,000  U.S.  citizens
visit  the  Philippines  each  year.  .  .  .  Manila  is  home  to  the  only  Veterans
Administration  regional  office  outside  the  United  States.  (United  States

",True
"Applicant is 22 years old, and he was born in the United States. He is engaged,
and his fiancée has a young son who resides with them. He attended school in Iraq and
received  a  high  school  certificate  in  2012,  but  he  does  not  have  a  general  education
diploma. Applicant has worked as a mortgage broker since May 2019. This is Applicant’s
first application for a DOD security clearance. He is seeking a security clearance to be a
linguist for a defense contractor in Iraq, which would increase his salary. (GE 1; Tr. 9-12,
20-23, 26-28, 57-58)
Criminal Conduct:
In March 2012, Applicant was arrested for domestic assault and battery after he
punched his stepmother twice in the face, breaking her nose. He was 14 at the time of
the  arrest,  and  as  a  result  he  spent  a  month  in  juvenile  detention.  After  this  incident,
Applicant’s father sent him to live in Iraq with Applicant’s aunt. (GE 2 at 7; GE 4; GE 3 at
3-4; GE 4; Tr. 59-61)
In  October  2013,  Applicant  was  arrested  for  domestic  assault  and  battery.  His
father called the police after Applicant broke his father’s car windows. Applicant’s father
told the police that Applicant was using marijuana. Applicant was put in a juvenile home
for  approximately  one  month  after  this  incident,  and  the  charges  were  ultimately
dismissed. (GE 3 at 5; GE 4; GE 5; Tr. 60-61, 68-69)
In  June  2014,  Applicant  was  arrested  for  failure  to  stop  after  a  personal  injury
accident, and failure to have insurance. Applicant struck a motorcycle and fled the scene.
Applicant and his friend were chasing an individual who took marijuana from Applicant’s
friend.  Applicant  pled  guilty  in  2015,  after  he  was  released  from  prison  for  the  crime
alleged in SOR allegation 2.d., and he received six months of probation. Despite his guilty
plea, Applicant claimed he allowed his friend to drive his vehicle, and he was a passenger
in his own vehicle. Applicant accepted responsibility for the accident because his friend
had a suspended license. (GE 1; GE 2 at 7; GE 3 at 7; GE 6; Tr. 69-77)
In August 2014, Applicant was charged with aggravated assault. Applicant was 17,
and his brother, who was 14, called the 18-year-old victim multiple times until the victim
met  Applicant,  his  brother,  and  two  of  their friends  in  a  parking  lot. Applicant’s  brother
threw the first punch, Applicant then punched the victim in the head, but claims he only
punched  him  once,  and  then  one  of  their  friends  punched  the  victim  once.  The  victim
suffered  a  broken  jaw,  a  broken  nose,  required  stitches,  and  reconstructive  surgery.
Applicant pled not guilty. He was tried as an adult, and a jury convicted him. Applicant
was sentenced to 365 days in jail. He was released two months early for good behavior.
(GE 1 at 27-28; GE 2 at 7; GE 3 at 4; GE 4; GE 7; Tr. 24, 77-88)
In  September  2014,  Applicant  was  arrested  for  driving  while  his  license  was
suspended, operation of a vehicle without registration plates, and no insurance. He was
sentenced to six months of probation. He had just purchased a vehicle from Craig’s List,
and  he  was  using  a  screwdriver  as  a  key.  At  that  time,  he  had  a  suspended  license;
therefore, he could not obtain registration plates. The incident occurred before he was
sentenced for the incident alleged in SOR allegation 2.d. (GE 8; Tr. 89-92)
In July 2015, Applicant was arrested due to outstanding warrants for driving while
his  license  was  suspended,  no  registration,  failure  to  stop  after  an  accident,  and  no
insurance. The outstanding warrants were related to the September 2014 incident alleged
in SOR allegation 2.c. Applicant failed to resolve these issues in SOR allegation 2.c due
to being incarcerated for ten months. Applicant pled guilty to three of the charges, and in
exchange the other three charges were dropped. He received six months of probation.
(GE 4; GE 9; Tr. 92-93)
In  May  2016,  Applicant  was  pulled  over  and  ticketed  for  no  insurance  and
registration  violation.  He  had  insurance  and  registration,  but  he  did  not  have  the
documentation  with  him  at  the  time  of  the  traffic  stop.  The  charges  were  eventually
dismissed. (GE 10; Tr. 93)
In May 2018, Applicant was ticketed for failure to display a valid license. He did
have a valid license, but not on him when he was pulled over by the police. The charge
was dismissed. (GE 11; Tr. 93-94)
Applicant has not been arrested or ticketed since 2018, and he has no unresolved
criminal issues. (Tr. 58, 89)
Personal Conduct
All of the Guideline J allegations were cross alleged under Guideline E.
At  the  hearing,  Applicant admitted  using  marijuana  from 2012 until  sometime  in
2014,  when  he  went  to  prison  for  the  crime  alleged  in  SOR  allegation  2.d.  He  used
marijuana  approximately  20  times  in  his  life,  and  he  sold  marijuana  for  six  months  to
friends. Applicant did not disclose marijuana involvement in his December 2017 SCA, in
his January 2018 counterintelligence screening interview (CSI), and in his February 2018
subject  interview.  At  the  hearing,  he  admitted  to  lying  about  his  drug  involvement.
Applicant’s failure to self-report his marijuana use was not alleged in the SOR and will not
be considered disqualifying in the determination of his security clearance. (GE 1; GE 2 at
11; GE 3; Tr. 62-67)
Applicant testified that he has turned his life around in the past several years and
no longer associates with individuals who use drugs or are involved in criminal activity.
He now accepts responsibility for his actions and strives to be a positive person. (Tr. 67-
68, 76-77, 97-98)
While working at the airport from 2016 to 2018, Applicant was promoted multiple
times.  He  left  this  job  in  July  2018,  because  he  obtained  his  real  estate  license  and
became a realtor. (Tr. 23-26)
Guideline B:
Applicant’s  father  was  born  in  Iraq.  In  1991,  he  fled  to  the  United  States  as  a
refugee and was subsequently naturalized. Applicant’s father owns property in Iraq, and
he  served  as  a  linguist  for  a  defense  contractor  from  approximately  2007  to  2009.
Applicant’s father’s sister and her family are citizens and residents of Iraq. (GE 1; GE 2;
GE 3 at 2; Tr. 29-31, 37-38)
Applicant does not own property or have financial assets in Iraq. Applicant lives in
his  fiancé’s  home,  but  does  not  own  any  real  estate.  His  assets  total  approximately
$5,000. In his CSI, Applicant told the investigator that he had equal loyalties to the US
and Iraq. At the hearing, Applicant indicated that  he would not want to have to choose
between the two countries, but he would choose the US over Iraq. (GE 2; Tr. 30-32)
Applicant’s aunt is a citizen and resident of Iraq. She lives near the Kuwait border
and sells homemade pickles. She has never been associated with the Iraqi government.
Applicant  communicated  electronically  with  her  and  his  cousins  once  a  week  until
approximately two to three years ago. (GE 3 at 3; Tr. 36-37, 44, 46-48)
Applicant is solely a United States citizen; however, he lived in Iraq with his father
from January 2003 to January 2006. They lived with his father’s sister and her children.
Applicant’s father sent Applicant to Iraq to live with his aunt in January 2008, and he lived
with her for a year. After the arrest listed in SOR allegation 2.a, Applicant’s father sent
him to Iraq to live with his aunt from March 2012 until December 2012. (GE 2; Tr. 21, 33-
37, 39-43, 46)
Applicant visited Iraq for two weeks in October 2017, and stayed with his aunt for
a day. He went to Iraq for a family wedding. Applicant is not aware of his cousins having
any ties to the Iraqi government. (GE 1 at 24; GE 2; Tr. 34, 42-43, 53)
Applicant does not consider himself to be close to his aunt, despite living with her
for  three  significant  periods  during  his  childhood  and  maintaining  weekly  electronic
communications with her and her sons until approximately three years ago. (Tr. 48-49,
51-52)
Iraq
The U.S. Department of State warns that travel within Iraq remains very dangerous
and  the  ability  of  the  U.S.  Embassy  to  assist  U.S.  citizens  is  extremely  limited.  U.S.
citizens in Iraq are at high risk for kidnapping and terrorist violence. Numerous terrorist
and insurgent groups are active in Iraq, including ISIS. Such groups regularly attack Iraqi
security forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias may also threaten U.S. citizens
and western companies throughout Iraq. (HE I)
Severe  human  rights  problems  are  widespread  in  Iraq.  Sectarian  hostility,
widespread corruption, and lack of transparency at all levels of government and society
weakened the government’s authority and worsened effective human rights protections.
Problems include harsh and life-threatening conditions in detention and prison facilities;
arbitrary arrests and lengthy pretrial detention; limits on freedom of expression to include
press,  social,  religious  and  political  restrictions  in  academic  and  cultural  matters;
discrimination  against  and  societal  abuse  of  women  and  ethnic,  religious,  and  racial
minorities; seizure of property without due process and limitations of worker rights. (HE I)

From July 2011 to April 2013, Applicant served as a linguist in Afghanistan. (Tr. 7,
29; GE 1) His support of the  U.S. military exposed him to a risk of injury or death from
combat.  (Tr.  31-32)  For  example,  around  2012,  an  improvised  explosive  device  (IED)
exploded near his Stryker vehicle, and he and other vehicle occupants were tossed around
inside the vehicle, but Applicant was not injured. (Tr. 45) In January 2019, he returned to
Afghanistan as a linguist supporting the United States. (Tr. 7, 40, 43-44) Two days before

with  about  $500  on  deposit.  The  value  of  his  land  in  Pakistan  has  varied  from  about
$40,000 to about $100,000 depending on a variety of economic factors. (Tr. 70-71) One
bank account currently has about $4,500 on deposit, and amount changes because his
retired pay is deposited in the account by the Pakistan government. (Tr. 64, 115-116) He

in Pakistan is limited and making comments about religion and politics or support of the

110) He is adamant that he would resist any attempt at coercion and unlawful influence.
(HE 3 at 10) He is happy about his life in the United States, and he does not intend to
leave the United States and return to settle in Pakistan. (Tr. 117-118; HE 3 at 16)
The Islamic Republic of Pakistan (Pakistan)
The separation in 1947 of British India into the Muslim state of Pakistan (with West
and East sections) and largely Hindu India was never satisfactorily resolved; India and
Pakistan fought two wars and a limited conflict (in 1947-48, 1965, and 1999 respectively)
over the disputed Kashmir territory. A third war between these countries in 1971 - in which
India  assisted  an  indigenous  movement  reacting  to  the  marginalization  of  Bengalis  in
Pakistani politics - resulted in East Pakistan becoming the separate nation of Bangladesh.
The Department of State travel advisory for Pakistan is Level 3: Reconsider Travel
to  Pakistan  due  to  terrorism.  Four  areas  of  the  country  (Balochistan  Province,  KPK
Province, Azad Kashmir, and the India Pakistan Border) are at Level 4: Do Not Travel.
Pakistan is a federal parliamentary republic. In July 2018 the Pakistan Tehreek-e-
Insaf (PTI) party won the most National Assembly seats in the general elections, and in
August 2018, PTI’s Imran Khan became prime minister.
Since 2001, U.S. policy has broadly been to assist the creation of a more stable,
democratic, and prosperous Pakistan that actively combats religious militancy. A key U.S.
ally  in  combatting  terrorism  after  9/11,  Pakistan  had  been  a  leading  recipient  of  U.S.
assistance, receiving more than $30 billion in aid and military reimbursements since 2001.
In January 2019, the U.S. Director of National Intelligence told a Senate panel of
“Pakistan’s  recalcitrance  in  dealing  with  militant  groups,”  and  predicted  Pakistan  will
continue  to  threaten  U.S.  interests  “by  deploying  new  nuclear  weapons  capabilities,
maintaining  its  ties  to  militants,  restricting  counterterrorism  cooperation,  and  drawing
closer to China.” Pakistan is a haven for numerous Islamist extremist and terrorist groups,
and successive Pakistani governments are widely believed to have tolerated and even
supported some of these as proxies in Islamabad’s historical conflicts with its neighbors.
Although  the  Pakistani  government  voiced  support  for  political  reconciliation
between the Afghan government and the Afghan Taliban, it did not restrict the Afghan
Taliban and the Haqqani Network (HQN) from operating in Pakistan-based safe havens
and  threatening  U.S.  and  Afghan  forces  in  Afghanistan.  The  government  failed  to
significantly  limit  Lashkar  e-Tayyiba  (LeT)  and  Jaish-e-Mohammad  (JeM)  from  raising
money, recruiting, and training in Pakistan - and allowed candidates overtly affiliated with
LeT front organizations to contest the July general elections.
Pakistan experienced significant terrorist threats in 2018, although the number of
attacks  and  casualties  have  continued  to  decrease  from  previous  years.  The  major
terrorist groups that focused on conducting attacks in Pakistan included Tehrik-e-Taliban
Pakistan (TTP), Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (JuA), Islamic State’s Khorasan Province (ISIS-K), and
the  sectarian  group  Lashkar-e-Jhangvi  al-Alami  (LJA).  ISIS-K  claimed  several  major
attacks  against  Pakistani  targets,  some  of  which  may  have  been  conducted  in
collaboration  with  other  terrorist  groups.  Separatist  militant  groups  conducted  terrorist
attacks against governmental, non-governmental, and diplomatic targets in Balochistan
and  Sindh  provinces.  Groups  located  in  Pakistan,  but  focused  on  conducting  attacks
outside  the  country,  included  the  Afghan  Taliban,  HQN,  LeT  and  its  affiliated  front
organizations, and JeM. Terrorists used a range of tactics to attack individuals, schools,
markets, government institutions, and places of worship, including IEDs, VBIEDs, suicide
bombings, targeted assassinations, and rocket-propelled grenades.
Terrorist  Incidents:  Pakistan  has  experienced  numerous  recent  terrorist  attacks.
Militant  and  terrorist  groups  targeted  civilians,  journalists,  community  leaders,  security
forces,  law  enforcement  agents,  and  schools,  killing  and  injuring  hundreds.  Religious
minorities faced significant threats from terrorist groups.

Terrorist financing networks in Pakistan have come under scrutiny. In early 2018,
the  United  States  joined  Britain  in  urging  other  members  of  the  Paris-based  Financial
Action Task Force (FATF) to return Pakistan to its list of countries found to be insufficiently
combating money laundering and terrorism financing, where it had been listed from 2012
to 2015. In mid-2018, FATF formally added Pakistan to this “Gray List.”
Human  rights  issues  in  Pakistan  include  credible  reports  of  extrajudicial  and
targeted killings; forced disappearances; torture; arbitrary and lengthy pretrial detention;
arbitrary  or  unlawful  interference  with  privacy;  censorship,  site-blocking,  and  arbitrary
restrictions on journalists’ freedom of movement; severe harassment and intimidation of
and  high  profile  attacks  against  journalists  and  media  organizations;  government
restrictions on freedom of peaceful assembly and association, including overly restrictive
nongovernmental  organizations  (NGO)  laws;  restrictions  on  religious  freedom  and
discrimination against members of religious minority groups; restrictions on freedom of
movement;  corruption  within  the  government;  recruitment  and  use  of  child  soldiers  by
non-state militant groups; lack of criminal investigations or accountability for cases related
to rape, sexual harassment, so-called honor crimes, female genital mutilation/cutting, and
violence  based  on  gender,  gender  identity  and  sexual  orientation;  legal  prohibitions  of
consensual  same-sex  sexual  conduct;  forced  and  bonded  labor  and  transnational
trafficking in persons; and the worst forms of child labor.
In early 2017, after Pakistan’s military announced the nationwide Radd-ul-Fasaad
or  “Elimination  of  Strife”  operation  to  prevent  cross-border  terrorist  attacks  and  limit
militants’ access to explosives and weapons, government and military sources reported
scores of military and police operations to disarm, disrupt, kill, and apprehend terrorists.
Military  courts  operated  without  transparency  and  sentenced  at  least  104  convicted
terrorists to death in 2018, up from at least 15 in 2017.
The  Pakistani  military  and  intelligence  services  nominally  reported  to  civilian
authorities but essentially operated without effective civilian oversight. There was a lack
of government accountability, and abuses often went unpunished, fostering a culture of
impunity  among  the  perpetrators,  whether  official  or  unofficial.  Authorities  seldom
punished government officials for human rights abuses.

"Applicant  is 40  years old,  single,  and  has  no  children.  He  was  born  in  Iraq  and
immigrated  to  the  United  States  in  October 2010.  He  was  naturalized  in  August  2016.
Applicant  has  worked  for  his  current  employer  as  a  physical  therapist  assistant  since
February  2018.  He  is seeking  a  security  clearance  to  work  as  a  linguist  for  a  defense
contractor in Iraq. (Item 3; Item 4; Item 5)
Applicant received a bachelor’s degree from an Iraqi university in 2003. He worked
as a local-hire translator for the U.S. military from August 2008 until October 2010, when
he  immigrated  to  the  United  States.  Since  he  moved  to  the  United  States.,  Applicant
received  a  certification  in  an  undisclosed  field  and  an  associate’s  degree  from  U.S.
institutions. (Item 3; Item 4; Item 5)
Applicant’s father, two brothers, and two sisters are residents and citizens of Iraq.
Additionally,  his  aunt  and  brother-in-law  are  residents  and  citizens  of  Iraq.  When
Applicant’s mother passed away in 2018, he returned to Iraq for her funeral. During the
three weeks he was in Iraq, he stayed with his family. (Item 3; Item 4; Item 5)
None  of  Applicant’s  family  members  are  employed  by  the  Iraqi  government  or
military. He has varying contact with them via phone conversations and text messages.
The last time he saw his family was during his 2018 visit to Iraq. Applicant gave his brother
$5,000 to help pay for his mother’s funeral expenses. He had previously given him a total
of $2,000 between 2012 and 2014. (Item 4; Item 5)
When Applicant’s mother passed away, he inherited 20 percent of her home, which
is worth an estimated $50,000. During his September 2018 personal subject interview,
he indicated that he intended to retain his share of the family home and would also stay
there when he visited his family. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that the home
is for sale. (Item 1; Item 4; Item 5)
There is no evidence that Applicant owns a home or other property in the United
States. Nor does he have any family living in the United States. (Item 3; Item 4; Item 5)
The U.S. Department of State warns that travel within Iraq remains very dangerous
and  the  ability  of  the  U.S.  Embassy  to  assist  U.S.  citizens  is  extremely  limited.  U.S.
citizens in Iraq are at high risk for kidnapping and terrorist violence. Numerous terrorist
and insurgent groups are active in Iraq, including ISIS. Such groups regularly attack Iraqi
security forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias may also threaten U.S. citizens
and western companies throughout Iraq. (HE I)
Severe  human  rights  problems  are  widespread  in  Iraq.  Sectarian  hostility,
widespread corruption, and lack of transparency at all levels of government and society
weakened the government’s authority and worsened effective human rights protections.
Problems include harsh and life-threatening conditions in detention and prison facilities;
arbitrary arrests and lengthy pretrial detention; limits on freedom of expression to include
press,  social,  religious  and  political  restrictions  in  academic  and  cultural  matters;
discrimination  against  and  societal  abuse  of  women  and  ethnic,  religious,  and  racial

"In the SOR, the Government alleged that Applicant’s wife is a citizen and resident
of Iraq (SOR 1.a), and that his mother-in-law and father-in law, a former senior official in
the Iraqi government, are Iraqi citizens residing in Iraq (SOR 1.b). It was also alleged that
Applicant has two sisters-in-law who live in Iraq and are Iraqi citizens (SOR 1.c), and that
his extended family members and associates are citizens of and reside in Iraq, some of
whom have or are serving in the Iraqi government and military (SOR 1.d).
In  response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  with  explanations  all  of  the  SOR
allegations.  In  addition  to  the  facts  established  by  Applicant’s  admissions,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant is 49 years old and employed as a linguist by a defense contractor for
work in support of U.S. military missions in the Middle East. He was born and educated
in Iraq, receiving a bachelor’s degree from an Iraqi university in 2006. In 2005, one of
Applicant’s professors warned him that a militia of Shi’ite Muslims was targeting Applicant,
who is a Sunni Muslim, for assassination and that he should leave the country. Applicant
fled to Jordan for a few months until the professor called him to say it was safe to return.
Applicant left Iraq for good in July 2007, moving first to Egypt, where he lived until March
2008. At that time, Applicant left Egypt for Jordan, where he lived until immigrating to the
United States in June 2009. Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in August 2014.
(Answer; GX 1 – GX 3)
When  Applicant  submitted  his  e-QIP  in  August  2017,  he  declared  that  he  was
single; however, in December 2016, he had travelled to Iraq to meet the woman who is
now  his  wife.  Theirs  is an arranged marriage  that was  made official  in  Iraq in  January
2017. Nonetheless, Applicant identifies June 2018 as the start of his marriage. It was then
that he returned to Iraq to bring his wife to the United States, where the marriage was
consummated. They now have one child, who was born in the United States in May 2019.
His wife is still an Iraqi citizen and recently became a permanent resident alien. She will
begin her application for U.S. citizenship as soon as she is able. (Answer; GX 1 – 3; AX
C; AX D; Tr. 26 – 27, 35 – 36, 58, 62 – 64)
Applicant initially planned to meet his wife in Jordan to accompany her back to the
United States. He was hesitant to travel all the way to Iraq to meet his wife because he
feared for his safety. In the end, he travelled to Iraq on an Iraqi passport he had renewed
when he was in Iraq to marry his wife in January 2017. For that trip, he also used an Iraqi
passport.  Applicant  has  since  relinquished  his  Iraqi  passport  to  his  employer’s  facility
security  officer  (FSO)  and  expressed  a  willingness  to  formally  renounce  his  Iraqi
citizenship. (Answer; GX 3; Tr. 46 – 47)
Applicant’s parents, who were naturalized as U.S. citizens in 2015, and one of his
brothers, who became a U.S. citizen in December 2019, live with Applicant and his wife
in a house Applicant bought in August 2012. Applicant also has two brothers living in the
United  States  who  are  still  Iraqi  citizens  and  not  yet  permanent  resident  aliens  here.
Applicant’s wife’s parents and siblings are Iraqi citizens and still reside in Iraq. His father-
in-law retired in 2011 after a 26-year career as a senior official in the Iraqi government.
Applicant has had little contact with his wife’s relatives since he went to Iraq to marry his
wife in 2017; however, his wife is very close with her family and communicates with them
as often as daily. (Answer; AX G; AX H; AX Q; GX 1 – 3; Tr. 28, 33, 36 – 37, 48 – 52)
Applicant’s father is a retired Iraqi diplomat and press official, and his mother did
not work outside the home. Applicant’s parents left Iraq for Jordan in 2000 because his
father was at risk of incarceration or worse at the hands of the Saddam Hussein regime.
After  living  in  both  Jordan  and  Egypt,  they  immigrated  to  the  United  States  in  2011.
(Answer; GX 1 – 3)
Applicant also has extended family and other associates in Iraq, most of whom live
in or near Baghdad. His family members are cousins, aunts and uncles on his mother’s
side. Many of them were or are employed by the Iraqi government or served in the Iraqi
military after the Hussein regime was ousted in 2003 during Operation Iraqi Freedom. He
has had contact as often as monthly with some of those relatives. One of his associates
is a retired pilot in the Iraqi air force who has served as a mentor to Applicant. Others are
old friends or classmates. Applicant insists that he ended all contact with these family and
friends in Iraq in 2018 due to security concerns associated with his employment in support
of the U.S. military. (Answer; GX 1 – 3; Tr. 37 – 38, 41)
Applicant’s  request  for  a  security  clearance  was  sponsored  by  a  defense
contractor who hired him in July 2017 for work as a linguist supporting a military mission
in a country other than Iraq. Applicant now works for a different company doing similar
work, and he indicated he was returning overseas for that work soon after his hearing.
His deployment is due to end in October 2020. He also indicated that if he receives a
clearance for his current position, he would likely be sent to Iraq, specifically to Baghdad.
Applicant’s wife, who communicates regularly with her parents and sisters, is aware that
Applicant requires a security clearance for his work. (GX 1; AX M; AX R; AX T; Tr. 32 –
35, 42 – 45)
Applicant’s  work  with  the  military  has  earned  him  praise  for  his  dedication  and
professionalism. A senior noncommissioned officer with whom Applicant worked closely
for  several  months  in  2019  believes  Applicant  “has  shown  tremendous  loyalty,
trustworthiness  and  reliability”  and  recommends  Applicant  for  a  security  clearance.
(Answer; AX O; AX V)
To properly assess the security significance of these facts within the adjudicative
guideline at issue, I have taken administrative notice of certain facts regarding  Iraq as
presented  in  HX  3  and  its  supporting  documents.  Of  particular  note  is  the  continued
inability of Iraq=s freely-elected government to quell violence and instability that persist in
parts of Iraq. These conditions are fueled and perpetrated by  terrorist groups affiliated
with Al-Qaeda and ISIS, as well as by Sunni insurgents and Iranian-backed Shiite militias.
As a result, some parts of Iraq remain wholly unstable. Even the city of Baghdad is still
subject to random acts of terrorist violence.
U.S. citizens and interests in Iraq remain at high risk for kidnapping and terrorist
violence. The U.S. State Department has advised against all individual travel to Iraq. The
ability of the U.S. Embassy to provide consular services to U.S. citizens outside Baghdad
and the southern city of Basra is extremely limited given the security environment. ISIS
again  controls  significant  portions  of  Iraq’s  territory,  and  numerous  other  terrorist  and
insurgent groups are active in Iraq. Such groups regularly attack both Iraqi security forces
and  civilians.  Anti-U.S.  sectarian  militias  may  also  threaten  U.S.  citizens  and  western
companies  throughout  Iraq.  U.S.  Government  and  western  interests  remain  possible
targets  for  attacks.  Additionally,  there  are  significant  human  rights  problems  in  Iraq.
Widespread corruption, as well as abuses by Iraqi security forces in response to acts of
violence by terrorists and others, have undermined confidence in the Iraqi government
and its judiciary. Human rights violations by Iraqi law enforcement are not uncommon and
are not being addressed when identified. Those include killing, kidnapping, and extorting
civilians, as well as inhumane conditions in detention and prison facilities, arbitrary arrest
and lengthy pretrial detainment, denial of fair public trial, limits on freedom of expression,
freedom of the press, censorship of religion, limits on peaceful assembly, and societal
abuses of women. The various terrorist and militia organizations are also responsible for
significant human rights abuses in Iraq.
Applicant is loyal to the United States and expressed pride in the work he does for
the U.S. military. All of his personal and financial assets are in this country. Beginning in
January 2017, he provided his wife in Iraq about $300 each month for support; however,
that  support  stopped  when  his  wife  immigrated  to  the  United  States  in  June  2018.
Applicant has not provided financial support to anyone else in Iraq. He is registered to
vote  in  the  United  States  and  he  meets  all  of  his  income  tax  reporting  obligations  as
required.  In  September  2018,  Applicant  received  a  master’s  degree  in  business
administration from a U.S. university. (Answer; GX 3; AX I - M; AX B; AX S; AX W; Tr. 28

"Applicant  admitted  the  SOR  allegations  in  ¶¶  1.a,  2.a,  2.b,  and  3.a,  with
explanations. He failed to respond to the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b through 1.e, which
will  be  considered  denials.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and
exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is 44 years  old.  He  was  born in Afghanistan.  He married in  2005  and
moved to the United States in 2007 on a spousal visa. His wife is a naturalized citizen of
the United States. He became a naturalized citizen in 2011. He has two children born in
the United States, ages nine and five years old. He resides in a home he owns. He has
worked for a federal contractor as a linguist assigned to Afghanistan from July 2018 to
at  least  the  date  of  his  answer  to  the  SOR.  He  also  previously  worked  for  a  federal
contractor  as  a  linguist  from  April  2010  to  February  2013,  assigned  to  Afghanistan.
Applicant was self-employed during other periods. (Item 3)
Applicant’s  brother,  sister,  half-brother,  and  two  half-sisters  are  citizens  and
residents of Afghanistan. His brother is 65 years old and retired from the Afghan Army
in 1988. Applicant stated in his SOR Answer that his brother quit the Army due to unfair
circumstances. He stated his brother receives a partial mental disability pension. He has
quarterly telephonic or electronic contact with him. Applicant did not disclose his sister’s
employment or means of support. He has monthly telephonic contact with her. (Item 3)
Applicant’s  half-brother  is  a  university  student  in  Afghanistan.  Applicant  has
monthly telephonic and electronic contact with him. Both of Applicant’s half-sisters are
teachers  employed  by  the  Ministry  of  Education.  Applicant  has  quarterly  telephonic  or
electronic contact with them. (Item 3)
During Applicant’s October 30, 2018 interview with a government investigator, he
disclosed  he  visited  his  family  in  Afghanistan  in  2013,  2014,  2015,  2016,  and  from
December  2017  to  January  2018.  This  information  was  not  included  in  his  October  5,
2018  security  clearance  application  (SCA).  He  also  disclosed  that  he  sends  money
quarterly  to  his  half-brother  in  Afghanistan.  In  the  past,  Applicant  provided  financial
support to his brother, sister, and half-brother in Afghanistan. (Items 4, 7)
In the past, Applicant provided about $15,000 in financial support to his nephew,
who  is  a  dual  citizenship  of  Afghanistan  and  the  United  Kingdom  (UK),  and  currently
lives in the UK. (Item 3)
During  Applicant’s  October  2018  Counterintelligence  Focused  Security
Screening  Questionnaire  (CIFSSQ),  he  was  asked  if  there  is  any  country  he  had
allegiance to over the United States. He responded that the United States is his country,
but  he  is  also  loyal  to  the  UK  because  he  has  family  there,  and  he  is  also  loyal  to
Afghanistan.  He  would  like  to  live  in  Europe  and  have  his  children  grow  up  with  his
family’s children, because they are lonely in the United  States, but believes that is not
possible. He confirmed that he is more loyal to the United States. (Item 4)
In April 2010, Applicant completed a CIFSSQ. In it he disclosed that in 2004 he
used marijuana two to three times while living in the UK, but had not used it since that
time. (Item 6)
In Applicant’s April 2012 CIFSSQ, he disclosed that he used marijuana once per
week when he lived in the UK and his last use was in 2005. (Item 5)
In Applicant’s August 2018 CIFSSQ, he disclosed he had used marijuana about
twice a week from 2016 to 2018 while living in the United States. He used it because it
was fun and stopped using it because he did not want his use to affect his employment
with U.S. Forces. He stated he never thought about the illegality of his use.
On  his  October  5,  2018  security  clearance  application  (SCA),  Applicant
answered  “no”  in  response  to  the  question  if  he  had  in  the  last  seven  years  illegally
used drugs. (Item 3)
In his October 2018 interview with a government investigator, Applicant said he
used marijuana a total of five to six times with his nephew in the U.S. from 2017 to the
present.  Whenever  his  nephew  obtained  marijuana,  they  smoked  it  to  relax.  Applicant
was attempting to quit smoking and used marijuana in its place. He told the investigator
that he did not disclose his drug use on his SCA because he believed his use was now
legal,  and  he  had  no  intention  to  use  it  in  the  future  due  to  its  potential  impact  on  his
eligibility  to  hold  a  job  with  U.S.  Forces.  He  told  the  investigator  that  he  had  used
marijuana from 2004 to 2008 once or twice a month with a nephew while he was in the
UK. (Items 4, 7)
In Applicant’s SOR Answer he stated:
It was a big mistake made by me and that happened due to ignorance and
lack of knowledge about the drug classifications. Honestly speaking one of
my friends mentioned to me that marijuana is legally allowed in [State A],
so while living in [State A] it was revolving in my mind that once it is legally
allowed it might not be counted [as] illegal drugs, so due to the ignorance
the word “no” uttered from my mouth on (e-QIP). (Item 2)

"Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  his  June  27,  2018  security
clearance application (SCA), unless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the
record. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, Applicant’s testimony, and
the documentary evidence, I make the following findings of fact:
Guideline B, Foreign Preference
Applicant (57) was born in the Philippines. He entered the United States with his
parents in 1983 at the age of 19. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1984 to 2004,
and retired as a staff sergeant (pay grade E-6), with 20 years of honorable service. While
serving  in  the  Marine  Corps,  he  was  deployed  overseas  several  times.  He  married  in
1984.  His  wife  was  also  born  in  the  Philippines  and  immigrated  to  the  United  States.
Applicant became a U.S. citizen in 1993. His wife is also a naturalized U.S. citizen. (AE
B; Tr. at 49.)
Applicant  and  his  wife  have  three  adult  children.  The  children  were  born  in  the
Philippines and are naturalized U.S. citizens. Applicant has an older brother and an older
sister, who are citizens and residents of the Philippines. In his SOR answer, Applicant
wrote that his contacts with his foreign family members are not frequent. He testified that
he speaks with his siblings during holidays and on other occasions, totaling three or four
times a year. He also testified that he “seldom” speaks with his mother-in-law, perhaps
two or three times a year. He was last in the Philippines in 2003 when his father died.
Applicant returned his father’s remains to the Philippines for burial. Neither his siblings
nor  his mother-in-law  have  ever  visited  him  and  his family  in  the  United  States.  (SOR
answer at 2-3; AE B; Tr. at 25-27, 30, 49, 52-53.)
Applicant’s brother works in the Philippines as a traffic officer. His sister is a retired
psychologist.  His  relatives  in  the  Philippines are  poor. They  have  no  knowledge  about
Applicant’s employment history and current status, except that he is a retired Marine. (Tr.
at 29-31.)
Guideline F, Financial Considerations
Applicant earned an associate’s degree in 2006 and a bachelor’s degree in 2013.
Since  his  discharge  from  the  Marine  Corps  in  2004,  Applicant  has  been  employed  by
federal  contractors  with  three  periods  of  unemployment,  specifically  from  July  to
November  2009,  December  2014  to  May  2016,  and  October  2017  to  June  2018.
Altogether,  he  experienced  about  28  months  of  unemployment  since  December  2014.
Each period of unemployment began with the expiration of the government contract on
which  he  was  working.  During  the  period  April  2013  through  November  2013,  he  was
deployed to a war zone by his employer, a major U.S. Government contractor. He was
rehired  by  that  contractor  in  April  2019  to  work  as  a  logistics  support  representative.
Starting with his years serving in the Marine Corps, he has worked for 35 years in the
field  of  logistics.  While  serving  in  the  Marine  Corps,  Applicant  was  granted  a  security
clearance in 1993. His clearance was renewed in 2010. (Tr. at 19-22.)
In  late  2013,  Applicant  began  to  experience  financial  difficulties  when  he  was
working in a war zone. Pursuant to a change in U.S Government policy, he and many
others were ordered to return from the war zone prematurely. Applicant was subsequently
laid off. He was highly paid for his work in the war zone. Upon his return to the United
States,  he  incurred  significant  tax  liabilities  due  to  his  loss  of  the  favorable  tax  rules
available to U.S. taxpayers who live and work outside of the United States. This resulted
in  unanticipated  taxes,  which  aggravated  his  financial  distress  from  his  loss  of
employment.  At  the  time  Applicant  applied  for  a  security  clearance  in  June  2018  after
another period of unemployment, he had a number of delinquent accounts, some of which
had been placed for collections. (Tr. at 31-33.)
SOR ¶¶ 2.a – 2.c, Three Student Loans Placed for Collection in the Total Amount of
$25,325 – Applicant has outstanding student loans for his daughter’s education and for
his more recent education. He claimed in his SOR answer that he has made payments
and is “no longer delinquent.” He is presently paying about $800 each month directly out
of his paycheck, as evidenced by the two leave and earning statements he submitted into
the record. These loans will be fully repaid in two or three years. These debts are being
resolved. (AE F; AE G; AE H; Tr. at 35-36, 63.)
SOR ¶¶ 2.d, 2.f, 2.g, 2.h., Credit Card Accounts Placed for Collection or Charged-
Off  in  the  Total  Amount  of  $5,893  - The  debt  alleged  in SOR  ¶ 2.d  ($3,715)  is for a
credit card account opened in December 2013. Applicant wrote in his SOR answer that
he learned about this collection account when he returned from his deployment in a war
zone in November 2013. He testified that he tried to reach the bank  when he returned
from the war zone and learned that the debt had been transferred to a collection agency.
He  never  heard  anything  further  about  this  account.  Applicant  intends  to  pay  his
outstanding debts pursuant to a plan discussed below. This debt will be resolved pursuant
to his repayment plan. (GE 3 at 2; GE 7 at 2-3; Tr. at 35-37.)
The  credit-card  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  2.f  ($1,224)  and  ¶  2.g  ($1,098)  are  the
same debt owed to the same bank. The debt is listed twice in Applicant’s credit reports
and in the SOR because the bank changed its name. Applicant has made payments on
this debt. Applicant  Exhibit  J,  dated  August 26,  2019,  evidences five  payments  on  the
account of $100 each. This debt is being resolved or has already been resolved. (GE 2;
AE J; Tr. at 37-38, 56-57, 66.)
The credit-card account alleged in SOR ¶ 2.h ($1,080) was opened in December
2013 and became delinquent about a year later. Applicant testified that he contacted the
creditor and was advised that the debt was charged off and would be treated as income
to Applicant for tax purposes. He believes that he included this debt as income on his tax
returns and owes nothing further. This debt will be resolved pursuant to his repayment
plan. (Tr. at 38-40.)
SOR ¶ 2.e, Consumer Retail Account Placed for Collection in the Amount of $1,576
–  This  debt  was  transferred  to  a  collection  agency.  The  agency  obtained  a  judgment
against Applicant in October 2017. Applicant never received any correspondence or court
papers from the creditor, either before the judgment or after. This debt will be resolved
pursuant to his repayment plan. (GE 2; Tr. at 37.)
SOR  ¶  2.i,  Consumer  Retail  Account  Charged-Off  in  the  Amount  of  $553  –  This
account was opened in 2012. Applicant defaulted on the payment of this account in about
June 2015. Applicant testified that he is unfamiliar with this debt. This debt will be resolved
pursuant to his repayment plan. (GE 3 at 2; Tr. at 40.)
SOR  ¶  2.j,  Account  Placed  for  Collection  in  the  Amount  of  $1,295  –  Government
Exhibit 4 established this collection debt. Applicant testified that he is unfamiliar with this
debt. This debt will be resolved pursuant to his repayment plan. (GE 4 at 6; Tr. at 42.)
After his background interview, Applicant called his creditors, but he learned that they
no longer owned the accounts. He could not figure out which company was the correct owner
of his debt, and which the legal creditor. Applicant testified that he has sought advice from a
financial counselor who has created a repayment plan to address the unresolved debts in the
SOR. Applicant has decided to delay implementing the plan until he knows whether he has
been granted a security clearance before he commits to repaying his debts. He is concerned
that  if  his  application  is  denied,  he  will  lose  his  employment  and  be  unable  to  honor  his
commitment to repay his creditors. He also wants to preserve the available income from his
wife’s employment and his military retirement to pay his mortgage and car payment should
he  become  unemployed  again.  He  credibly  testified  that  if  his  clearance  was  granted,  he
would begin making the payments pursuant to the counselor’s repayment plan. Applicant’s
attorney  represented  that  he  possessed  a  single  copy  of  the  plan,  which  he  would  submit
after the hearing. The plan was not included in the post-hearing submission by Applicant’s
law firm. I note that his attorney separated from that law firm shortly after the hearing and
before the post-hearing submission was made. (Tr. at 40-42, 65, 72, 79.)
Guideline E, Personal Conduct
In his SOR answer, Applicant responded to the falsification allegation in SOR ¶ 3.a by
writing that he did not understand the question involved. He noted that English is not his
native language. Also, he was unaware that he had any delinquent debts. At the hearing,
he clarified that the main reason for his incorrect response to the financial question in the
SCA was that he thought he had no delinquent debts. His wife played the major role in
paying household bills. He first learned about the debts during his background interview.
He  then  checked  his  credit  for  the  first  time.  He  credibly  denied  that  he  intentionally
provided a false answer. (SOR answer at 8; Tr. at 42-43, 62, 65-72, 78.)
The Philippines
The U.S. Department of State warns U.S. citizens to exercise increased caution
when  traveling  to  the  Philippines  due  to  crime,  terrorism,  and  civil  unrest.  The  State
Department advises that there is considerable risk of terrorism in the country. Terrorist
organizations and criminal gangs operate throughout the country. Some groups are allied
with the Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham, also known as ISIS. The organizations and
gangs  conduct  bombing  attacks  and  kidnappings  against
foreigners,  civilians,
government institutions, and security forces.

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions
in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  34-year-old  linguist  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  since  May
2011. He is seeking to work on a contract that requires a security clearance.
Guideline B, Foreign Influence
The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline B, based on Applicant’s family
connections to Iraq. He was born in Iraq. He married an Iraqi woman in January 2007.
His wife is now a U.S. citizen. They have two children, ages 11 and 6, who are native-
born U.S. citizens.
Applicant was employed by a defense contractor and served with U.S. Forces in
Iraq  from  February  2006  to  October  2008.  He  was  involved  in  direct  combat  and
participated  in  numerous  security  missions,  reconnaissance  missions,  and  prisoner
apprehensions.  He  received  numerous  accolades  and  certificates attesting  to  his hard
work, bravery, reliability, and dedication. The Army officers and noncommissioned officers
with whom he served strongly supported his application for a special immigrant visa. (AX
A through AX L; AX T through Y; AX Z.)
Applicant, his mother, his wife, and his youngest sister came to the United States
in October 2008 on a special immigrant visa. He and his family lived in the United States
with the U.S. Army captain for whom he worked in Iraq. (Tr. 41.)  His mother and sister
returned  to  Iraq  after  living  in  the  United  States  for  about  11  months.  (Tr.  45,  57.)  He
became a U.S. citizen in January 2014.
In  2009,  Applicant  decided  to  enlist  in  the  U.S.  Army  as  a  linguist.  He  took  the
Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery twice and failed it. He passed on the third
try.  Before  he  could  enlist,  his  wife  was  hospitalized  and  disabled  for  several  months.
Instead of enlisting, he applied for a linguist position with a defense contractor and was
hired. (Tr. 125-29.)
Applicant was employed by this defense contractor from September 2009 to July
2011. He worked intermittently as a cultural role player during pre-deployment training in
the  United  States  for  U.S.  Army  units  on  their  way  to  Iraq.  (GX  1  at  16-17.)  He  again
received  numerous  certificates  of  appreciation  for  his  dedication  and  service.  (AX  N
through R; AX OO.)
From May 2011 to May 2017, Applicant was employed by a federal contractor as
an  audio  technician  operating  a  broadcasting  system  for  another  government  agency
(AGA). He was commended for his skill, dedication, and teamwork. (AX OO.)
Applicant’s mother, brother, three sisters, uncle, two brothers-in-law, and mother-
in-law, are citizens and residents of Iraq. His father served as a bandsman in  the Iraqi
Army,  retired  with  a  pension,  and  is  now  deceased.  (Tr.  47.).  Applicant  has  monthly
contact with his mother by social media. (Tr. 45.) She is supported by his father’s military
pension. (Tr.
Applicant’s brother is employed by the Iraq Ministry of Interior, was trained by U.S.
Forces  in  2005,  and  works  as  an  unarmed  security  officer  for  the  Facilities  Protection
Service in Iraq. Applicant talks to his brother between two times and four times a year by
social media. (Tr. 50.)
Applicant has had no contact with his oldest sister since he visited her in Iraq in
2014. The lack of contact is due to a poor relationship between her and Applicant’s wife.
(Tr. 52.) He talks to his middle sister two or three times a year. His last contact with his
youngest sister was in 2014, when she returned to Iraq.
Applicant has had no personal contact with his mother-in-law and brothers-in-law
since 2014. His last personal contact with his uncle was in 2017, when his uncle visited
the  United  States  in  connection  with  personal  business  in  Iraq.  (Tr.  59.)  Applicant
communicates with his uncle about twice a year by text message. (Tr. 61.)
Applicant’s  wife  talks to  her mother  and  one  of  her sisters in  Iraq about twice  a
week. His wife’s other sister lives in Turkey. Applicant exchanges greetings with his wife’s
mother about twice a year. He last visited her in person in 2014. (Tr. 62-63, 65-66.)
One of Applicant’s brothers-in-law is a teacher in an Iraqi government school. His
wife talks to her brother about once a month, and Applicant exchanges greetings with him
occasionally.  (Tr.  67.)  Applicant’s  other  brother-in-law  owns  a  small  grocery  store.
Applicant’s wife talks to this brother-in-law about once a month, and Applicant exchanges
greetings with him about once a year. (Tr. 69.)
Iraq is a constitutional parliamentary republic. Iraqi parliamentary elections in 2014
generally  met  international  standards  of  free  and  fair  elections  and  led  to  a  peaceful
transition of power. The United States regards Iraq as a key partner in the region as well
as a voice of moderation and democracy in the Middle East, and it maintains vigorous
and broad engagement with Iraq on diplomatic, political, economic, and security issues.
U.S.  assistance  to  Iraq  focuses  on  economic  reform,  assistance  to  vulnerable  groups,
democracy,  and  governance.  U.S.  security  assistance  supports  the  development  of  a
modern,  accountable,  fiscally  sustainable,  and  professional  Iraqi  military  capable  of
defending Iraq and its borders.
The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) is a designated terrorist organization that
controls some areas of Syria on the Iraqi border and remains a threat to public safety in
Iraq through indiscriminate terrorist attacks. ISIS, criminal gangs, and local militias pose
a potential threat to U.S. citizens and interests. The Department of State travel advisory
for Iraq is Level 4: “Do not travel to Iraq due to terrorism and armed conflict.”
Iraq’s most significant human rights issues include allegations of unlawful killings
by some members of the Iraqi Security Forces, forced disappearances, torture, arbitrary
detention, and widespread official corruption. Iraqi citizens are not eligible for travel to the
United States under the Visa Waiver program, which permits citizens of certain countries
to travel to the United States for business or tourism for up to 90 days without a visa.
Guideline F, Financial Considerations
The  SOR  alleges  ten  delinquent  debts  totaling  about  $56,779.  The  debts  are
reflected in credit reports from March 2017, May 2017, and April 2019. (GX 3, 4 and 5.)
Applicant testified that his financial problems began in 2017, when his income was
drastically reduced. He had been working for a contractor supporting an AGA. He worked
at night, earning a night differential, and working overtime. He earned $84,000 in  2014
and  $73,000  in  2015.  Due  to  budget  cuts,  his  employer  stopped  his  night  work  and
overtime, reducing his annual income to about $31,800. (Tr. 104-09.) When his pay was
reduced, he kept his house payments current but fell behind on his other debts. (GX 4 at
1; GX 5 at 1.) He hired a credit-repair company in April 2018. (Enclosure to SOR answer.)
He  terminated  his  contract  with  the  company  after  paying  $110  per  month  for  three
months  and  decided  to  deal  directly  with  his  creditors.  (Tr.  114-15.)  The  evidence
concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below.
SOR ¶ 2.a: credit-card account charged off for $6,187. Applicant opened this
account  in  October  2011.  It  was  charged  off  in  June  2017.  (GX  4  at  2.)  He  made  a
payment agreement in August 2018 providing for monthly $100 payments. (Attachment
to SOR answer.) His payments were current through February 10, 2020. (AX EE.)
SOR ¶ 2.b: electronics bill referred for collection of $1,980. Applicant testified
that he believed this debt was for a cellphone. (Tr. 77.) It was referred for collection in
December 2017. (GX 4 at 2.) He made a payment agreement with the collection agency
for this debt and settled it for less than the full amount on February 11, 2020. (AX FF.)
SOR ¶ 2.c: collection account for $624. Applicant testified that this debt was for
the purchase of a lawn mower. The account was opened in December 2014 and charged
off  in  July  2016.  (GX  3  at  4.)  In  October  2017,  it  was  referred  to  the  same  collection
agency as the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 2.b, and it was settled on February 11, 2020. (Tr.
77; AX FF.)
SOR  ¶  2.d:  automobile  lease  referred  for  collection  of  $24,965.  Applicant
testified that he purchased a car for $35,000 with a six-year loan. He was advised by an
unidentified person that he should lease a car instead of buying one. In 2012, he traded
in his $35,000 car and leased a luxury car for three years. (Tr. 33; GX 5 at 3.) He had a
dispute with the dealership about a $2,300 repair that he thought should covered by the
warranty.  He  stopped  making  payments  and  the  car  was  repossessed  in  September
2015. (Tr. 81-83; GX 5 at 1.) In his answer to the SOR, he submitted evidence that he
received a settlement offer in February 2019, and he settled the debt in April 2019 for less
than the full amount.
SOR ¶ 2.e: electronics bill referred for collection of $2,089. This debt was for
the purchase of a television. It was charged off in February 2016 and was referred to the
same  collection  agency  as  the  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  2.b  and  2.c.  (GX  3  at  3.)  He
settled this debt for less than the full amount in March 2019. (Enclosure to SOR answer.)
SOR ¶ 2.f: credit-card account referred for collection of $1,619. This account
was opened in February 2012 and charged off in August 2016. (GX 4 at 2.) It was settled
for less than the full amount on February 11, 2020. (AX NN.)
SOR ¶ 2.g: department store account charged off for $1,382. This was opened
in  August  2011  and  charged  off  in  September  2016.  (GX  3  at  4.)  It  was  settled  in
September 2018. (AX II.)
SOR  ¶  2.h:  home  improvement  store  account  charged  off  for  $427.  This
account  was  opened  in  December  2014  and  charged  off  in  July  2016.  (GX3  at  4.)  In
Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  submitted  documentation  of  a  settlement  offer  he
received and accepted in April 2019. He paid the final installment of $156.77 on February
11, 2020. (AX JJ.)
SOR ¶ 2.i: credit-card account referred for collection of $1,979. This debt is a
duplicate of the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 2.b. (AX FF.).
SOR ¶ 2.j: credit-card account referred for collection of $15,527. This account
was  opened  in  April  2010  and  referred  for  collection  in  December  2015.  (GX  3  at  3.)
Applicant settled this debt for less than the full amount in September 2018. (AX KK.) The
creditor cancelled $13,826 of the debt. Applicant received an IRS Form 1099-C reflecting
the cancelled portion of the debt, and he reported it as income on his tax return for 2018.
(Tr. 96-97; AX LL.)
Applicant  is  currently  employed  full  time  by  a  local  county  as  an  assistant
broadcast engineer at an annual salary of $75,000. He also has two part-time jobs as a
freelance contractor for an AGA, from which he expects to earn about $30,000 per year.
(Tr. 100-02.) He has about $50,000 in savings that he has accumulated since 2018. (Tr.

"In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with comments, all of the factual
allegations  pertaining  to  foreign  influence  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a.  through  1.c.).  Applicant’s
admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete
and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same,
I make the following additional findings of fact:
Background
Applicant  is  a  37-year-old  Iraqi-born,  naturalized  U.S.  citizen,  whose  parents,
siblings, and in-laws are Iraqi citizen-residents. As a linguist, in 2012, Applicant emigrated
from  Iraq  to  the  United  States  under  the  Special  Immigrant  Visa  for  Iraqi  Translators
Program (SQ1) because he had previously served as a linguist-translator with the U.S.
Army  in  Iraq  from  February  2005  until  November  2011,  during  a  period  of  increased
hostilities and military action, and he contributed to the missions of the United States at
personal risk on behalf of U.S. combat forces in Iraq. He was married in Iraq in 2008, and
his wife accompanied him to the United States in 2012. He has not reported any children.
He  became  a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen  in  2017,  and  although  Department  Counsel
indicated that Applicant’s wife was naturalized the following year, there is no evidence in
the  file  to  confirm  that  date.  Applicant  is  considered  to  be  a  part-time  “prospective”
employee of a defense contractor, since March 2018, and he will be serving as a linguist-
translator,  to  be  deployed  to  Iraq.  All  of  Applicant’s  formal  education,  including
elementary,  high  school,  and  college,  was  received  in  Iraq.  He  received  a  bachelor’s
degree in Iraq in 2005. However, he has attended classes at a local college in the United
States in an effort to obtain a General Educational Development (GED) diploma, but as
of  April 2018,  no  such  diploma  had  been  awarded  to  him.    He  has  never served  as  a
member  of  the  U.S.  military  or  of  any  foreign  military.  He  has  never  been  granted  a
security clearance. He has no financial interests outside of the United States.
Foreign Influence
General  source  information  pertaining  to  the  foreign  influence  issues  discussed
below can be found in the following exhibits: Item 3 (SF 86, dated March 30, 2018); Item
2 (Answer to the SOR, dated July 17, 2019); Item 5 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated
April  20,  2018);  Item  4  (Investigative  Findings;  Counterintelligence  Focused  Security
Screening  Questionnaire  (CIFSSQ);  List  of  Foreign  Travel;  List  of  Relatives  and
Associates  (LRA);  List  of  Developed  Relatives  and  Associates;  List  of  Relatives  and
Associates Military & Government Service (LRAM&GS); and List of Developed Relatives
and Associates Military & Government Service, all dated August 16, 2018).
From about 1999 until about 2001, Applicant was forced to join the Arab Socialist
Ba'ath  Party  which  was  headquartered  in  Baghdad,  Iraq, until  2003,  in order to  attend
college after graduating from high school. While affiliated, he did not perform any duties,
he did not hold any rank, he did not pay any fees, and he did not attend any meetings.
His past membership in the Ba'ath Party does not present a counterintelligence (CI) or
foreign preference (FP) risk according to U.S. counterintelligence authorities. However,
because Applicant’s National Intelligence Agency Checks (NIAC) were incomplete at the
time of his screening in August 2018, and the completed portions contained no derogatory
information,  until  the  checks  are  completed,  there  is  a  potential  CI/FP  risk.  (Item  4
(Investigative Findings), at 2-3; Item 4 (CIFSSQ), at 5))
Because  of  the  draw-down  of  U.S.  Forces  in  Iraq  in  2011, Applicant  decided  to
leave Iraq as well because he felt his life would be in danger for supporting those U.S.
Forces  as  a  local-hire  linguist  for  seven  years.  (Item  4  (CIFSSQ),  at  1)  In  2018,  he
described his feelings for Iraq: “I feel it’s unsafe for everyone, not just ME . . . if it was up
to ME I wish I can bring all of MY family . . .  the safety and environment is very poor.
Security is really bad because it is controlled by Iran. I feel scared for MY family . . . .”
(Item 4 (CIFSSQ), at 3) In 2019, he reaffirmed his desire to bring his entire family to the
United States. (Item 2)
When questioned about having any concerns about working for the United States
in  Iraq,  and  how  he  would  handle  those  concerns,  Applicant  replied:  “No  .  .  .  if  I  ever
accept an offer to go to Iraq I will not let anyone know where I am working . . . I did this
job before with the U.S. military, I don’t fear anymore.” (Item 4 (CIFSSQ), at 8)
Applicant continues to be a dual citizen, despite having renounced his allegiance
to Iraq when he took his oath of U.S. citizenship in 2017. That oath is as follows:
I hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure
all  allegiance  and  fidelity  to  any  foreign  prince,  potentate,  state,  or
sovereignty, of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen;
that I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States
of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true
faith and allegiance to the same; that I will bear arms on behalf of the United
States when required by the law; that I will perform noncombatant service
in the Armed Forces of the United States when required by the law; that I
will  perform  work  of  national  importance  under  civilian  direction  when
required by the law; and that I take this obligation freely, without any mental
reservation or purpose of evasion; so help me God.

united-states-america
When  questioned  by  an  investigator  from  the  U.S.  Office  of  Personnel
Management (OPM) in April 2018, he acknowledged that he maintains dual citizenship,
and  that  he  had  taken  no  action  to  renounce  it.  He  explained  that  his  inaction  was
associated with the fact that his parents and in-laws remain in Iraq, and his family keeps
him “tethered” to Iraq. (Item 5, at 1) However, during his August 2018 counterintelligence
interview, when asked about having allegiance to any country over the United States, he
insisted that “[b]ecause everything changed, I don’t feel like it’s MY country anymore . . .
government, politics, and even people.” (Item 4 (CIFSSQ), at 1) In his Answer to the SOR,
he added: “[M]y allegiance and my family allegiance are to the United States of America
. . . My loyalty is only to the United States. I have nothing . . . that will limit my loyalty,
service to the United States. . . .” (Item 2)
As  noted  above,  Applicant’s  parents,  siblings,  and  in-laws  are  Iraqi  citizen-
residents. His mother, a woman in her 70s, is currently a housewife, and she retired as a
school librarian a decade ago; his father, also in his 70s, retired as an unarmed school
security guard a decade ago after being drafted into the Iraqi Army in 1987, and being
wounded; a brother, in his 40s, is with the Ministry of the Interior as an armed school and
mosque security officer who has never served in the Iraqi Army; another brother, also in
his 40s, is an unarmed school front desk security person who has never served in the
Iraqi  Army;  his  mother-in-law,  a  woman  in  her  60s,  is  currently  a  housewife,  and  she
retired as a school archiver over a decade ago. Except as noted above, parents, siblings,
and  in-laws  were  never  associated  with  the  Iraqi  military  or  intelligence  service.  As  of
August 2018, Applicant’s contacts with his family and extended family members varied.
He  generally  spoke  to  his  parents  and  mother-in-law  on  a  weekly  basis,  and  his  two
brothers on a monthly basis. He last had contact with his father-in-law over a decade ago.
(Item 3, at 28-39; Item 5, at 8-10; Item 4 (LRA), at 1-3; Item 4 (LRAM&GS).
Iraq
Iraq is a constitutional parliamentary republic in constant turmoil. The outcome of
the  2014  parliamentary  elections  generally  met  international standards  of free  and fair
elections and led to the peaceful transition of power from former Prime Minister Nuri al-
Maliki to Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi. The assessment of subsequent elections has
not been reported. On October 2, 2018, Iraqi President Barham Salih selected Adil Abdul-
Mahdi  to  be  the  Prime  Minister  of  Iraq,  and  he  was  given  30  days  to  form  a  new
government. On October 25, 2018, Abdul-Mahdi was sworn into office, five months after
the  2018  elections.  However,  on  November  29,  2019,  after  weeks  of  widespread
demonstrations  against  a  government  that  protesters  considered  corrupt,  failing  to
provide  them  with  basic  services,  and  beholden  to  powerful  neighboring  Iran,  Mahdi
resigned  his  post,  and  the  Iraqi  parliament  approved  his  resignation  on  December  1,
2019. He was scheduled to continue on in a caretaker role until parliament approved a
full-time replacement. On February 1. 2020, Mohammed Tawfik Allawi was nominated to
serve as Prime Minister of Iraq, but he withdrew his candidacy on March 1, 2020, after
parliament  failed  for  the  second  time  in  a  week  to  approve  his  cabinet.  On  March  17,
2020,  Adnan  al-Zurfi,  a  former  official  of  the  Iraq  Reconstruction  and  Development
Council (IRDC) that took over Iraq after the 2003 U.S. invasion that deposed former ruler
Saddam Hussein, was designated to become Prime Minister, drawing criticism from Iran’s
allies in the country amid new tensions between Washington and Tehran.
In August 1990, Iraq invaded neighboring Kuwait and declared its annexation into
Iraq. Despite United Nations (UN) disapproval of the action, Iraq refused to withdraw from
Kuwait. In January 1991, a coalition of nations, led by the United States, launched military
operations against Iraq, called Operation Desert Storm. The Iraqi Army was crushed. No-
fly zones were established in Iraq, banning Iraq from using all aircraft in the designated
no-fly zones. After several years of Iraqi non-compliance with established UN resolutions
and  requirements,  in  March  2003,  the  United  States  and  another  coalition  of  nations
launched  another  assault  on  Iraq,  called  Operation  Iraqi  Freedom.  Some  military
operations ceased in May 2003, and a provisional government under the IRDC and an
American Chief Civilian Administrator was established to decide all Iraqi affairs. Over the
ensuing years, hostilities and terrorism continued, and U.S. military operations increased.
In 2003, outlawed mid-level and lower level officials of the Ba’ath Party were permitted to
return to their previous posts. By late 2010, over 90,000 U.S. troops were withdrawn from
Iraq,  leaving  only  a  transitional  military  force  to  advise  and  assist  security  forces,
counterterrorism missions, and protect U.S. civilians.
The U.S. Mission in Iraq remains dedicated to building a strategic partnership with
Iraq and the Iraqi people. The December 2011 departure of U.S. troops from Iraq marked
a milestone in our relationship as Iraq continues to develop as a sovereign, stable, and
self-reliant country. Iraq is now a key partner for the U.S. in the region as well as a voice
of  moderation  and  democracy  in  the  Middle  East.  Iraq  has  functioning  government
institutions including an active legislature, is playing an increasingly constructive role in
the  region,  and  has  a  bright  economic  future  as  oil  revenues  surpass  pre-Saddam
production levels with continued rapid growth to come. The U.S. maintains vigorous and
broad  engagement  with  Iraq  on  diplomatic,  political,  economic,  and  security  issues  in
accordance with the U.S.-Iraq Strategic Framework Agreement (SFA).
The SFA between Iraq and the U.S. provides the basis for the U.S.-Iraq bilateral
relationship.  It  covers  the  range  of  bilateral  issues  including  political  relations  and
diplomacy, defense and security, trade and finance, energy, judicial and law enforcement
issues, services, science, culture, education, and environment. Efforts to implement the
SFA are overseen by the Higher Coordinating Committee and several Joint Coordination
Committees, which meet periodically.
The U.S. Department of State warns that U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high risk for
violence and kidnapping, and advises U.S. citizens not to travel to Iraq. The current travel
advisory level is Level 4: “Do not travel to Iraq due to terrorism and armed conflict.” The
U.S. Government considers the potential personal security threats to U.S. Government
personnel  in  Iraq  to  be  serious  enough  to  require  them  to  live  and  work  under  strict
security guidelines. On May 15, 2019, the U.S. Department of State ordered the departure
of non-emergency U.S. government employees from the U.S. Embassy in Bagdad and
the U.S. Consulate in Erbil amidst heightened tension with Iran.
The  ability  of  the  U.S.  Embassy  to  provide  consular  services  to  U.S.  citizens
outside  Baghdad  is  limited  given  the  security  environment.  Anti-U.S.  sectarian  militias
may  threaten  U.S.  citizens  and  western  companies  throughout  Iraq.  Kidnappings  and
attacks  by  improvised  explosive  devices  (IED)  occur  in  many  areas  of  the  country,
including  Baghdad.  Methods  of  attack  have  included  explosively  formed  penetrators
(EFPs), magnetic IEDs placed on vehicles, human and vehicle-borne IEDs, mines placed
on or concealed near roads, mortars and rockets, and shootings using various direct fire
weapons. Such attacks may take place in public venues such as cafes and markets.
Iraq  witnessed  continued  terrorist  activity  in  2016,  primarily  as  a  result  of  the
actions  of  Islamic  State  of  Iraq  and  Syria  (ISIL).  In  2016,  ISIL  remained  the  greatest
terrorist threat globally, maintaining a formidable force in Syria, including a large number
of foreign terrorist fighters. ISIL’s capacity and territorial control in Iraq has dramatically
eroded in the past two years. According to estimates from the UN Assistance Mission for
Iraq, acts of terrorism and violence killed more than 7,000 civilians and injured more than
12,000 in 2016. By the end of 2017, Iraqi Security Forces had liberated all territory from
ISIL, drastically reducing ISIL’s ability to commit abuses and atrocities. Nevertheless, anti-
American/anti-western  sentiment  exists  throughout Iraq,  especially  among  Iran-backed
militias.  Human  rights  violations  continue  to  be  a  problem  with  allegations  of  unlawful
killings  and  other  abuses  being  made  against  the  Iraqi  Security  Forces  and  Popular
Mobilization Forces.
In  its  annual  human  rights  report,  the  U.S.  Department  of  State  reported  that
severe  human  rights  problems  were  widespread.  Sectarian  hostility,  widespread
corruption, and lack of transparency at all levels of government and society weakened
the  government's  authority  and  worsened  effective  human  rights  protections.  Iraqi
Security Forces, members of the Federal Police, and the Peshmerga committed some
human rights violations, and there continued to be reports of Popular Mobilization Forces
killing,  torturing,  kidnapping,  and  extorting  civilians.  ISIL  committed  the  overwhelming
majority of serious human rights abuses, including attacks against: civilians, (particularly
Shia but also Sunnis who opposed ISIL); members of other religious and ethnic minorities;
women; and children.
Observers  also  reported  other  significant  human  rights-related  problems:  harsh
and  life-threatening  conditions  in  detention  and  prison  facilities;  arbitrary  arrest  and
lengthy  pretrial  detention,  denial  of  fair  public  trial;  insufficient  judicial  institutional
capacity;  ineffective  implementation  of  civil  judicial  procedures  and  remedies;  arbitrary
interference  with  privacy  and  homes;  child  soldiers;  limits  on  freedom  of  expression,
including  press  freedoms;  violence  against  and  harassment  of  journalists;  undue
censorship; social, religious, and political restrictions in academic and cultural matters;
limits on freedoms of peaceful assembly and association; limits on religious freedom due
to  violence  by  extremist  groups;  restrictions  on  freedom  of  movement;  refugee  and
internally displaced persons (IDP) abuse; both forced IDP returns and preventing IDPs
from  returning  home;  discrimination  against  and  societal  abuse  of  women  and  ethnic,
religious, and racial minorities, including exclusion from decision-making roles; trafficking
in  persons;  societal  discrimination  and  violence  against  lesbian,  gay,  bisexual,
transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) persons; seizure of property without due process; and
limitations on worker rights.
The  United  States’  extraordinary  commitment  to  Iraq  is  balanced  against  the
inherent  dangers  of  the  ongoing  conflict  in  Iraq  to  its  citizens  and  residents  and  Iraq
government  problems  developing  and  complying  with  the  rule  of  law.  A  top  national
security goal of the United States is to establish relationships, cooperation, training, and
support of the Iraq Government and military in the ongoing war against terrorism.
While most of the official U.S. commentary regarding Iraq focuses on human rights
violations  and  terrorist  activities,  there  is  little,  if  any,  evidence  that  Iraq  is  an  active
participant in economic espionage, industrial espionage or trade secret theft, or violator
of export-control regulations.

"The SOR, as amended, alleges Applicant’s three sisters, brother, half-brother, half-
sister,  and  mother-in-law  are  residents  and  citizens  of  Sudan.  It  also  alleges  three
delinquent debts totaling $19,897, including a line of credit, a personal loan, and a credit
card  debt.  Applicant  admitted  the  Guideline  B  allegations  and  denied  the  Guideline  F
allegations, with comments and explanations.
Applicant is 64 years old. He was born in Sudan, entered the United States in 2000,
and naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 2008. He married in 1984. His spouse was born in
Sudan, and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2010. They have four adult children, all
of whom live in the United States. His two daughters are U.S. citizens, and his two sons
are permanent U.S. residents. Applicant received a bachelor’s degree in 1981, and has
been employed as a linguist for a government contractor since March 2019. He primarily
works for the U.S. Army in Iraq. He drives a taxi when between contracting jobs. He has
never held a security clearance.
Applicant has three sisters that are citizens and residents of Sudan between the
ages of 75 and 85. He testified that they are not educated and suffer from bad health. He
speaks to them about once or twice per year. Applicant’s brother is a resident and citizen
of  Sudan.  He  does  not  know  what  his brother does for a  living,  and  last  spoke  to  him
about eight months ago. Applicant reported in his 2018 counterintelligence screening that
his  brother  was  unemployed.  Applicant  also  has  a  half-brother  and  half-sister  that  are
citizens and residents of Sudan. He spoke to them about eight months ago, and his half-
brother is sick and bedridden. Applicant last saw them in 2015 when he visited Sudan.
Applicant’s mother-in-law is a citizen and resident of Sudan. She is 85 years old, and is
also  bedridden  with  heart  problems.  Her  children  care  of  her.  Applicant’s  spouse  has
contact with her mother over social media, and speaks to her about every six months to
a year. None of Applicant’s family members have ties to the Sudanese government. Once
Applicant applied for a security clearance, he reduced contact with his family in Sudan,
and he does not have property or financial interests in Sudan.
Applicant moved to the United States for a better life for his family, and education
for his children. He supported his children’s education while driving a taxi from 2003 to
2017. In 2017, he was unemployed for about four months while undergoing eye and neck
surgery,  and  remained  underemployed  as  the  taxi  business  was  overcome  by  ride-
sharing  services.  Applicant  stated  that  he  loves  the  United  States,  and  his  immediate
family live in the United States. His children’s education and occupations include medical
doctor,  chemist,  nurse,  and  human  resource  specialist.  He  is  a  loyal  U.S.  citizen,  and
considers the United States his home.
Applicant incurred three debts as a result of medical procedures, unemployment,
and underemployment. He fell behind on debts when he lost income after being unable
to drive a taxi after his surgeries, and with the decline of the taxi business.  He hired a
debt relief company in 2017, received financial counseling, and resolved the debts. One
debt was settled and paid on a payment plan as a result of litigation, and two others were
paid  in  September and  November 2019.  Applicant owns  a home and  is current  on his
mortgage and expenses. He earns about $80,000 per year, and his spouse earns about
$21,600 per year. His February 2020 personal financial statement shows a monthly net
remainder of $3,114. He has bank savings valued at about $15,000.

"In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  all  of  the  allegations  with
explanations. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough
and careful review of the evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  32  years  old.  He  was  born  in  Iraq  in  1987.  He  immigrated  to  the
United States in 2009, using a special immigrant visa earned as a result of his work as a
linguist  for  U.S.  forces  in  Iraq  from  2006-2009.  He  became  a  U.S.  citizen  in  2015.  He
earned an associate’s degree. He is single and has no children. Applicant is seeking a
linguist position, which requires a security clearance. (Tr. 6, 20-21, 24; GE 1)
The SOR alleged that Applicant’s father, mother, three brothers, two sisters, and
his stepmother are residents and citizens of Iraq. It also alleged that his cousin, who is a
Kurdish soldier, and his brother-in-law, who is a police officer for the Ministry of Interior,
are  also  residents  and  citizens  of  Iraq.  Additionally,  the  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant
provided financial support to various family members, friends, and contacts in Iraq.
In  2006,  after  Applicant  graduated  from  high  school  in  Iraq,  he  was  hired  as  a
linguist to work with U.S. forces. Performing his linguist duties placed him in harm’s way
on  numerous  occasions.  Three  U.S.  Army  officers  he  served  with  provided  letters  of
recommendations,  which  described  Applicant’s  duties  performed  and  his  character
traits.  (Tr.  20,  38;  AE  A-C)  A  former  Army  officer  described  Applicant  as  having
“unquestionable integrity and sheer dedication.” He went on to state:
I  have  prioritized  maintaining  contact  with  [Applicant]  over  the  years,
because his character and integrity are simply beyond reproach. My trust
and faith in [Applicant’s] patriotism has only strengthened over the years. I
cannot imagine he has not faced hardship and struggle, leaving his family
and  coming  to  the  United  States.  But  every  time  we  talk,  [Applicant]  has
always  expressed  incredible  gratitude  to  be  in  this  country  and  an
unwavering  pride  to  be  an  American.  The  fact  that  he  is  seeking  this
secret clearance so that he can continue to serve this country in a critically
important  role  as  a  translator  underscores  [Applicant’s]  patriotism  and
dedication to our country (AE A)
Another Army officer who served with Applicant stated the following:
[Applicant]  is  dependable,  hardworking,  and  punctual.  He  is  able  to  form
relationships  with  locals  that  facilitate  our  later  engagements.  [Applicant]
has proved to be loyal, trustworthy, and has become a good friend.
I commend [Applicant’s] performance and recommend [Applicant] without
reservation for employment or citizenship. He has fought and suffered with
my soldiers and done more than many Americans who decided to sit this
war out. The courage he has shown and dedication to improving the lives
of Iraqis is commendable and should be rewarded. (AE B)
The third Army officer supporting Applicant noted that Applicant’s actions in Iraq
contributed to the safety of his soldiers and Iraqi citizens. (AE C)
The current status of Applicant’s relatives listed in the SOR is as follows:
1. Applicant’s father and stepmother (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.e). Applicant has no ongoing
relationship with his father and stepmother who are citizens and reside in Iraq. He has
never met or spoken to his stepmother and his last contact with his father was in 2007.
His estrangement is due to his father abandoning their family years ago. (Tr. 25)
2. Applicant’s mother (SOR ¶ 1.b). Applicant’s mother is a resident and citizen of
Iraq.  She  is  68  years  old.  She  resides  in  a  refugee  camp  in  the  Kurdish  area  of  Iraq.
She  does  not  work  outside  the  home  and  has  no  affiliation  with  the  Iraqi  government.
Applicant maintains weekly telephone contact with his mother. He has provided financial
assistance  to  his  mother  at  various  times  in  order  to  overcome  the  loss  of  all  family
possessions  when  she  fled  from  hostile  occupiers  and  entered  a  refugee  camp.  Most
recently,  he  sent  her $800  two  months  ago.  He  estimated  that  over the  years he may
have provided approximately $30,000 to various family members in Iraq. (Tr. 21, 26, 32-
34, 39-40; GE 3)
3.  Applicant’s  three  brothers  (B1,  B2,  B3)  (SOR  ¶  1.c).  All  Applicant’s  brothers
remain citizens of Iraq, but B1 and B2 currently reside in France. Both recently moved
to  France  and  are  seeking  employment  there.  They  do  not  intend  to  return  to  Iraq.
Applicant has weekly telephone contact with B1 and B2. B3 has resided in Germany for
approximately  four months.  He does  not  intend to  return  to  Iraq. Applicant  has  weekly
telephone  contact  with  B3.  He  has  provided  financial  assistance  to  his  brothers  at
various  times  in  order  to  overcome  the  loss  of  all  family  possessions  when  they  fled
from hostile occupiers and entered a refugee camp. (Tr. 21, 26-29, 32-34, 40; GE 3)
4. Applicant’s two sisters and a brother-in-law (S1, S2, BL (SOR ¶¶ 1.d, 1.f). S1
and BL (S1’s husband) are residents and citizens of Iraq. S1 does not work outside the
home  and  BL  is  a  police  officer  for  the  Ministry  of  the  Interior.  Applicant  has  weekly
telephone contact with S1 and monthly contact with BL. S2 remains a citizen of Iraq, but
she currently resides in France where she attends school. She does not intend to return
to Iraq. Applicant has had weekly contact with S2 in the past. She has no affiliation with
the Iraqi government. (Tr. 21, 26, 30-34, 41; GE 3)
5. Applicant’s cousin (SOR ¶ 1.f). Applicant’s cousin is a resident and citizen of
Iraq.  He  is  currently  a  member  of  the  Kurdish  military.  Applicant  has  contact  with  this
cousin approximately two times a year. (Tr. 32, 41-42; GE 2)
Applicant  maintains  checking  and  savings  accounts  in  a  U.S.  bank.  Currently
between  both  accounts,  he  has  approximately  $10,000.  He  has  no  property  or  other
assets  in  Iraq  and  he  does  not  stand  to  inherent  any  property.  He  returned  to  Iraq  in
2015 for approximately 40 days to visit his family. He would protect the interests of the
United States over concerns about his Iraqi family’s safety. He  intends to reside in the
United States in the future and has no desire or intent to reside in Iraq. (Tr. 34-37)
Administrative Notice.
The  U.S.  State  Department  warns  U.S.  citizens  against  travel  to  Iraq  as  travel
within the country remains dangerous. The U.S. Embassy warns that U.S. citizens are at
high risk for kidnapping and violence and to avoid all but essential travel to Iraq. In May
2019,  the  U.S.  government  considered  the  potential  threat  to  U.S.  government
personnel  in  Iraq  to  be  serious  enough  to  order  the  departure  of  non-emergency
employees from the embassy and consulate. The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS)
remained the greatest terrorist threat globally, maintaining a formidable force in Iraq and
Syria. Human rights abuses in Iraq include unlawful killings and other serious crimes by
Iraqi security forces. (HE II)

"Applicant is 39 years old.  He is married with no children.  He has two Master’s
degrees, one  in  Business,  and  the other in Data Science.   (Tr.  p. 5.)    He  is employed
with  a  defense  contractor  as  a  Software  Engineer.    He  is  seeking  to  retain  a  security
clearance in connection with his employment.
Guideline B – Foreign Influence
Applicant is a native-born American citizen.  Both of his parents are from Taiwan.
He  grew  up  here  and  obtained  his  education  in  the  United  States.    He  married  a
Chinese woman, who became a naturalized American citizen before he married her.
Applicant’s only contact with China is with his mother and father-in-law, who are
citizens  and  residents  of  China.    His  mother-in-law  was  a  civil  engineer  who  has  now
retired.  His father-in-law worked in the real estate business and he has recently retired.
Neither  of  them  speak  English.    Applicant’s  father-in-law  has  never  served  in  the
Chinese military, nor has he worked for the Chinese Government.  Applicant visited his
in-laws  in  China  as  recently  as  2018.    His  in-laws  come  to  the  United  States  to  visit
Applicant and his wife about once every two years or so.  (Tr. p. 34.)  Any foreign travel
Applicant does to China or elsewhere, he reports to his company security officer.
Applicant’s  wife  is  an  only  child.    When  her  parents  pass  away,  she  stands  to
inherit  a  two  bedroom  condominium  valued  at  approximately  $300,000.    Applicant  nor
his wife have any assets of any kind in China, including bank accounts.
Anytime Applicant travels to China he has always informed his security manager
and follows all security protocol.  Applicant has never been approached, confronted, or
contacted  by  any  foreign  entity  attempting  to  obtain  protected  information  from  him.
Applicant  states  that  he  is  loyal  to  the  U.S.  and  that  his  limited  relationships  with  any
foreign  resident  of  China  cannot  induct  him  to  do anything  against the  interests of  the
United States.  (Tr. pp. 44 - 46.)
Guideline H – Drug Involvement
In  October  2018,  during  his  security  clearance  interview  with  an  investigator,
Applicant admitted that from February 2017 through February 2018, he used marijuana.
He explained that as a result of a left knee injury in June 2012, where he dislocated his
knee  cap,  which  required  surgery,  he  has  continued  to  have  discomfort.    Instead  of
over-the-counter drugs, Applicant chose to use marijuana for relief since it was legalized
in  the  state  for  recreational  use.    Applicant  stated  that  in  order  to  purchase  marijuana
from  a  dispensary,  he  had  to  obtain  a  prescription  from  a  doctor  first.    He  then
purchased the marijuana he used to soothe his knee discomfort.  Applicant stated that
he is aware that marijuana use is still prohibited under Federal law.   He stopped using
marijuana  before  his  interview  in  October  2018,  because  his  medical  marijuana  card
which  allowed  him  for  one  year  to  purchase  marijuana  from  a  dispensary  had  expired
and  he  decided  not  to  renew  it.    At  the  time  Applicant  used  marijuana,  from  February
2017 through February 2018, he held a security clearance issued by the Department of
Defense.  Applicant stated that he never asked anyone at work to determine whether he
should or should not use marijuana.  He did not report his marijuana use on his security
clearance  application  because  he  did  not  see  it  as  an  issue.    He  remembers  the  last
time he used marijuana to have occurred sometime before February 2018.
Applicant began working for his current employer, a defense contractor, in 2001.
Over  the  years,  ownership  of  the  company  has  changed  hands,  but  the  Applicant’s
employment has continued.  Applicant is currently a supervisor  with over 15 engineers
working for him.  He explained that he chose to use marijuana because he was doing it
on  his own  personal time  and  not  while  he was  at  work.    Applicant  expressed  that he
enjoyed the use of marijuana, but felt that by doing a cost/benefit analysis, the cost to
continue using it was too great.
Applicant submitted a Statement of Intent dated June 14, 2019.  It indicates that
Applicant  has  not  used  marijuana  since  February  2018.    It  also  states  that  Applicant
does not intend to use marijuana in the future and that if he does, his security clearance
will be subject to automatic revocation.  (Government Exhibit 3.)
A  number  of  letters  of  recommendation  from  his  Manager,  a  Project  Manager,
other  professional  associates,  coworkers,  and  friends  attest  to  Applicant’s  excellent
work product, good character, integrity, and loyalty to our country.  Overall, Applicant is
considered  to  be  an  invaluable  resource  to  his  company.    They  all,  without  hesitation,
recommend him for a security clearance.  (Applicant’s Exhibit A.)
Performance reviews of the Applicant for the periods from January 2013 through
January 2018, reflects that he receives “high marks” and consistently over achieves and
performs  beyond  expectation.    He  is  also  an  exceptional  team  player  and  has  good
leadership characteristics.  (Applicant’s Exhibit C.)
Applicant  is  an  active  participant  in  the  community,  volunteering  for  various
charity and community outreach events.  (Applicant’s Exhibit B.)
Applicant has received numerous awards from his employer in recognition of his
significant contributions to the work product.  (Applicant’s Exhibit C.)

"I have incorporated Applicant’s admissions in my findings of fact and have noted
his denials and additional comments. Applicant’s personal information is extracted from
his  SCA,  unless  otherwise  indicated  by  a  parenthetical  citation  to  the  record.  After  a
thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  the  Department  Counsel’s  FORM  and
administrative notice request, Applicant’s response to the FORM, and the documentary
evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant was born in Afghanistan in 1981 and is presently 38 years old. In 1994,
he and his family relocated to Pakistan as refugees. He earned a high school diploma in
Pakistan  in  2009  at the  age  of  28.  In  about 2009, Applicant  met  a  woman  online. The
woman was born in Afghanistan but had lived in the United States for many years, and
holds dual citizenship with the U.S. and Afghanistan. Applicant and the woman married
in Pakistan in 2010. Applicant’s wife has three adult children. They were all born in the
United States and hold dual U.S. and Afghan citizenships. Her middle child, age 32, lives
in Afghanistan, and the two others, ages 34 and 30, reside in the United States. (GE 4 at
13.)
In January 2012, Applicant returned to Afghanistan while he waited for a visa to
join his wife in the United States. After an interview at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, he was
granted  an  IR1  (spouse  of  a  U.S  citizen)  visa.  Applicant  entered  the  United  States  in
October 2013, about three years after his marriage. He and his wife separated in March
2017 and divorced in the United States in October 2018. He became a naturalized U.S.
citizen in March 2018, at the age of 37. (AE A; GE 4 at 3, 13.)
Applicant possesses both a U.S. passport and an Afghan passport. He renewed
his Afghan passport in 2015. He traveled to Afghanistan in March 2016 and April 2018 to
visit his family there. He reported in his June 2018 U.S. Army counterintelligence security
screening interview (Interview) that he does not plan to renounce his Afghan citizenship.
He  wants  to  keep  that  citizenship  so  that  he  can  travel  to  Afghanistan  on  his  Afghan
passport without the necessity of applying for a visa and because he has emotional ties
to Afghanistan due to his birth there. (GE 4 at 12, 14.)
In 2014, Applicant attempted to enlist in the U.S. Army because he could not find
employment.  However,  he  failed  the  Armed  Services  Vocational  Aptitude  Battery
(ASVAB) exam. In 2018, he applied for his current position as a linguist because he was
divorced. Prior to starting his work for the U.S. Army as a contractor in October 2018, he
was “’in a bad financial situation.’” (GE 4 at 5-6, 8, 11; AE F.)
Applicant’s  father  is  deceased,  and  his  mother  is  a  citizen  and  resident  of
Afghanistan. He has three sisters who are citizens and residents of Afghanistan. All three
are  married  and  have  children.  Applicant  has  other  siblings  who  live  outside  of
Afghanistan. Since 2015, he has sent about $200 per calendar quarter to help support
his mother, who is a “housewife.” In his June 2018 Interview, Applicant reportedly said
that if he worked for the U.S. Government in Afghanistan, he would be concerned about
the safety of his mother and one of his three sisters in Afghanistan. He planned to deal
with this concern by keeping his work there a secret. He also stated, however, that if his
family  was ever threatened, he would not betray his country. He further stated that he
would never betray the U.S. or Afghanistan. (SOR answer at 2; GE 4 at 2, 8, 10, 11, 17.)
As of June 2018, when Applicant submitted his SCA and was interviewed by Army
investigators, Applicant reported that he had weekly telephone contact with his mother
and one of his sisters in Afghanistan. He also reported that he had monthly or quarterly
telephone contact with his other two sisters in Afghanistan and monthly telephone contact
with the daughter of his former wife, who resides in Afghanistan. (GE 4 at 17-19.)
Applicant has a friend who is a citizen and resident of Afghanistan. The friend is a
senior executive officer in the Afghan National Army serving in the Afghan Special Forces.
As  of  June  2018,  Applicant  had  monthly  contact  with  this  friend.  In  his  SOR  answer,
Applicant wrote that he keeps their friendship very professional and does not discuss his
work with the friend. (GE 4 at 12, 16, 21; SOR answer at 3.)
The  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  1.e  sets  forth  security  concerns  about  Applicant’s
statement in the Interview that his allegiance to the U.S. was the same as his allegiance
to Afghanistan. In his SOR answer, he wrote that his response to the security screening
question was misunderstood. He wrote that the security and national interest of the United
States  are  his “priority.” He  also  wrote  that his allegiance to Afghanistan  is just  as the
country of his birth. The reason he provided for declaring that the United States was his
priority is that his future belongs in the United States. (SOR answer at 3.)
Character Evidence and Services Provided to the U.S. Army
Applicant  provided  with  his  SOR  answer  four  character  references  and  three
certificates of appreciation, one from his employer and two from the Combined Security
Transition Command – Afghanistan. A U.S. Air Force captain described Applicant as the
“most  valued  contributor  to  our  team”  and  that  he  has  “the  highest  level  of  moral
character”  and  “a  very  trustworthy  American.”  He  also  noted  that  Applicant  once  put
“himself at personal risk to physically escort the deceased remains” of coalition forces to
safety after an attack in Kabul. A U.S. Army captain wrote that Applicant has been asked:
“to call and work with high ministerial levels of the Afghan Government due to his ability
to  achieve  results  and  be  trusted.”  He  praised  Applicant’s  “great  moral  character.”  A
captain  in  the  British  Army  wrote  that  Applicant  “has  coordinated  multiple  security
meetings with police commanders and high ranking officials across the security services
in order to facilitate the successful implementation” of an important security program. A
U.S. Army major and first sergeant co-wrote a memorandum in which they recommended
Applicant receive a clearance. They wrote that Applicant “demonstrates his loyalty to U.S.
military forces by providing interpretation and translation services to the U.S. military and
coalition forces in support of counter-terrorism efforts in Afghanistan.” They also wrote: “I
trust [Applicant] with my life on every mission; his action in supporting the United States
is a testament to his loyalty to our nation.” Applicant’s employer awarded him a Certificate
of Appreciation that describes Applicant as one of its “exceptional employees.”(AE B-H.)
Afghanistan
The  Taliban  is  a  serious  challenge  for  the  democratically  elected  Afghan
Government  in  almost  every  province  of  Afghanistan.  It  considers  itself  the  rightful
government of Afghanistan, and it continues to fight for the withdrawal of foreign forces
from  the  country.  The  U.S.  State  Department  advises  against  travel  to  any  area  of
Afghanistan  due  to  terrorism,  crime,  civil  unrest,  kidnapping,  and  armed  conflict.  The
State Department warns that the security situation in Afghanistan is extremely unstable
and the threat to U.S. citizens remains critical. Extremist groups across the country utilize
a variety of tactics to expand their territorial influence, disrupt governance, and create a
public perception of instability. The presence of more than 20 terrorist organizations in
the region creates the largest concentration of terrorist and extremist organizations in the
world.  The  country  also  experiences  serious  abuses  of  human  rights  as  well  as
widespread  disregard  for  the  rule  of  law  and  official  impunity  for those  responsible  for
human rights abuses.

"In  his  response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  denied  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b,  and  1.c.  He
admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.d, and 1.e, and attached three documents to his SOR response. (See
AE A-C)
Applicant is 56 years old. He was born in Sudan and is a member of the Zaghwa
tribe. He has been married since 2007, and has two children, ages 8 and 12. Applicant is
sponsored by a government contractor for a linguist position in Kuwait or Iraq, with his
employment contingent on the issuance of a DOD security clearance. He is a dual citizen
of Sudan and the United States. Applicant’s employer asked him to surrender his expired
Sudanese  passport.  At  the  hearing,  Applicant  avowed  that  he  is  loyal  to  the  U.S.,  the
country that ultimately saved his life. He does not own any property or bank accounts in
Sudan, and only travels with his U.S. passport. (Tr. 58-59, 64-70, 72-73, 80; GE 1, GE 2,
GE 4)
Applicant  left  Sudan  when  he  was  19  years  old  to  attend  college  in  the  Soviet
Union, and was able to avoid conscripted military service in the Sudanese military. He
obtained  his  bachelor’s  degree  in 1988,  master’s  degree  in  1993,  and his  doctorate  in
international  law  in  1997.  He  moved  to  Dubai  in  1998.  Applicant  worked  for  the
government  of  the  United  Arab  Emirates  (UAE) for approximately  two  years before he
became a partner in other businesses. In 2003, Applicant became a human-rights activist
in  Dubai,  after  the  genocide  campaign  started  in  the  Sudanese  city  of  Darfur,  and  the
Sudanese government targeted mainly three African tribes, including his own tribe. He
worked  diligently  to  establish  a  network  within  the  international  community  and  inform
them of the needless slaughter of innocent people. (Tr. 12, 33-36; GE 2, GE 4)
Applicant soon became a target for the government of Sudan, not only for being a
member  of  the  Zaghwa  tribe,  but  also  for  being  a  vocal  human-rights  activist.  The
Sudanese government requested that the UAE government arrest and detain Applicant.
During his first arrest in 2008, the UAE security agency held him in jail for three weeks,
and required him to be interviewed daily for about ten hours each day. He was released
only after Applicant’s wife went to the U.S. Consulate in Dubai to seek assistance. In early
2009, about two months after his release, Applicant was arrested a second time. He was
held for ten days in a detention center. He was arrested a third time in 2009.  He was held
in captivity for five or six months, facing possible deportation to Sudan. During his stay in
jail,  U.S.  Homeland  Security  and  United  Nations  (UN)  personnel  took  him  to  the  UN
building in Abu Dhabi, interviewed him, and he was released from captivity. There was a
strong U.S. presence in the Middle East at the time taking action to improve the misplaced
citizens of the Sudan situation. (Tr. 37-44; GE 2, GE 4)
In December 2009, Applicant arrived in the United States as a political refugee. In
May 2015, he and his wife became naturalized U.S. citizens. Applicant returned to Sudan
from December 2016 to January 2017 to visit his elderly father. Even though it was risky
to return to Sudan, Applicant maintained daily contact with the U.S. embassy in Khartoum.
Applicant was not detained or interviewed by the Sudanese government during this travel.
(Tr. 46-48; GE 1, GE 2, GE 4)
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges Applicant’s father is a citizen and resident of Sudan.  Applicant
denied  this  allegation  since  his  father  passed  away  on  February  26,  2019.  (SOR
response; Tr. 56; AE A)
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges Applicant’s sister, a citizen and resident of Sudan, serves as
the  Senior  Legislative  Advisor  for  the  Sudan  National  Legislative  Counsel.  Applicant
denied this allegation in his SOR response. He admitted at the hearing that his sister has
been  employed  by  the  Sudanese  government  for  25  years,  with  her  last  five  years  of
employment  with  the  Sudanese  Legislative  Council.  His  sister  had  been  an  elected
member of the ruling party until the military overthrew the Sudanese government in 2019.
She is now barred from government service. Applicant had repeatedly warned his sister
over the years that there will come a time that she and the corrupt government  will be
held  accountable  for  their  crimes  against  innocent  people.  Since  the  2019  revolution,
Applicant admitted that she could be in some danger for her past involvement with the
corrupt Sudanese government. He regularly communicates with his sister through social
media,  and  no  action  has  yet  been  taken  against  her.  He  stated  that  if  she  is  held
answerable for her crimes, as a brother he would be sad, but as a human rights activist,
Applicant fully understands the possibility that his sister may face charges one day. (Tr.
51-57, 62-63; GE 2-4)
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges Applicant’s brother-in-law, a citizen and resident of Sudan, and
serves on the Sudanese Legislative Council. Applicant denied this in his SOR response.
He  admitted,  however,  that  his  brother-in-law  had  been  on  the  Sudanese  Legislative
Council for approximately the last six years, until the 2019 military coup. His brother-in-
law is now working as a lawyer for a law firm in Sudan. He is also barred from Sudanese
government service. (Tr. 51-57; GE 2-4)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges Applicant’s cousin is employed as a police officer in Sudan, and
he is also a resident and citizen of Sudan. Applicant admitted this information and also
disclosed that he communicates with his cousin weekly through social media. His brother
is a local police officer, and is not involved in the politics or government of Sudan. (Tr. 51-
52; GE 2-4)
SOR  ¶  1.e  alleges  Applicant’s  half-sister  is  a  citizen  and  resident  of  Sudan.
Applicant admitted this allegation and stated that she lives in northern Dafur, which is not
currently a safe place. He met her for the first time in 1997, and again in 2016 when he
traveled to Sudan. His contact with her is sporadic. (Tr. 49-51; GE 2-4)
After Applicant arrived in the U.S., he started teaching U.S. public policy part-time
as an adjunct faculty at different universities. He is grateful to have civil rights in the U.S,
and  he  is  currently  involved  in  human-rights  campaigns  for  Sudan.  He  feels  a  moral
obligation  to  defend  the  rights  of  Sudanese citizens  who  have  been  oppressed  by  the
government for many years. He intends to continue to be a human-rights advocate not
only for Sudan, but for other countries with serious human rights violations. (Tr. 59, 63-

Administrative Notice – Sudan
The United States reestablished diplomatic relations with Sudan in 1972, however,
Sudan’s established  links  with  international terrorist  organizations  resulted  in  the  1993
designation  of  Sudan  as  a  State  Sponsor  of  Terrorism,  and  the  suspension  of  U.S.
Embassy  operations  in  1996.  The  U.S.  Embassy  was  reopened  in  2002,  and  remains
open today.
In July 2011, conflict broke out between the government and the Sudan People's
Liberation  Movement  -  North  in  states  of  Southern  Kordofan  and  Blue  Nile  (together
known as the Two Areas),  which resulted in 1.1 million internally displaced persons or
severely affected persons needing humanitarian assistance. A separate conflict broke out
in the western region of Darfur in 2003, displacing nearly 2 million people and causing
thousands of deaths. Fighting in both the Two Areas and Darfur has largely subsided,
however the civilian populations are affected by low-level violence including inter-tribal
conflict and banditry, largely a result of weak rule of law. The United Nations (UN) and
the African Union have jointly commanded a Darfur peacekeeping operation (UNAMID)
since 2007. Peacekeeping troops have struggled to address insecurity in Darfur and have
increasingly become targets for attacks by armed groups. Sudan also has faced refugee
influxes  from  neighboring  countries,  primarily  Ethiopia,  Eritrea,  Chad,  Central  African
Republic, and South Sudan. Armed conflict, poor transport infrastructure, and denial of
access  by  both  the  government  and  armed  opposition  have  impeded  the  provision  of
humanitarian assistance to affected populations.
Sudan was a Republic, however, in April 2019, the Sudanese military overthrew
the  government  of  President  Omar  Hassan  Al  Bashir  and  established  a  transitional
military counsel. The previous government of Sudan concentrated power in the hands of
an authoritarian government and the National Congress Party, which maintained nearly
absolute political power. There is a national state of emergency in effect across Sudan
which give security forces greater powers of arrest and incarceration.  The detention of
foreigners has been reported and other human rights issues include unlawful or arbitrary
killing, forced disappearance, torture, and arbitrary detention. The U.S. State Department
Travel Advisory for Sudan is:  Level 4 - do not travel.

"Applicant  admitted  the  allegation  in  the  SOR  ¶  1.a,  and  he  both  admitted  and
denied parts of the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 39 years old. He was born in Iraq where he attended high school. He
attended the Iraqi Military College and earned a bachelor’s degree in military science. He
then attended the Iraqi Police College and earned a bachelor’s degree in criminal justice.
His attendance at the Military College was considered military service, and he graduated
with  a  military  rank.  He  was  subject  to  recall  to  military  service,  if  needed.  When  he
graduated from the Police College in 2003, he began working for the Iraqi government
police force. He married in 2008 and has no children. (Tr. 20-22; GE 1, 2)
In 2003, Applicant was part of the Iraqi security forces. After the invasion of Iraq
by  Coalition  Forces,  the  Iraqi  security  forces  were  sent  home.  Because  there  was  no
official  Iraqi  government  at  the  time  (for  about  six  months),  Applicant  was  paid  an
emergency salary by the United States to provide police protection for the Iraqi people.
He continued to work with the U.S. security forces and provided bodyguard protection for
a U.S. General in 2004 and 2005. (Tr. 73-85)
In  2006,  while  supporting  the  Coalition  Forces,  Applicant  was  kidnapped  by  a
militia group because of his efforts to rid areas of terrorist groups within Iraq. Applicant
was  blindfolded,  handcuffed,  beaten,  and  put  in  the  trunk  of  a  vehicle  where  he  was
transported  to  a  different  location.  He  was  accused  by  his  captors  of  working  with  the
Coalition Forces. At one point, he was left alone in a room and used his military training
to remove the handcuffs, but injured his wrists while doing so. He escaped from the room
where he was held captive and knew if he was found he would be killed. Applicant was
afraid  for  his  safety.  He  found  a  driver  who  took  him  to  a  village  and  the  sheik  there
provided him protection, medical care, and transportation to his sister’s resident. Because
he was being accused of working with the Coalition Forces, he knew his family was in
danger. He warned his family and asked them to bring him his passport, which they did.
His father gave him money so he could escape the country. Applicant did not trust the
Iraqi government to protect him. Applicant fled Iraq through Syria to Jordan. (Tr. 22-36)
In 2005, Applicant’s wife’s brother was working for the United Nations in Iraq. He
was kidnapped and is presumed dead. Her family has never heard from him again. That
same year, Applicant and his wife were taking her mother to hospital in Iraq when the
vehicle they were driving was attacked. His wife was hit in the head with shrapnel and
survived  the  attack  as  did  her  mother.  After  this  incident,  his  wife,  her  mother,  two
brothers, and two sisters fled Iraq to Jordan. His wife’s family remain citizens of Iraq and
are residents of Jordan. Her father is deceased. Her mother is a homemaker. Her brothers
are engineers. One works in private industry and the other works in a government position
that verifies people’s educational credentials. One sister is a teacher and the other works
in the accounting field. (Tr. 41-45, 57-62; GE 1, 2, 3)
After fleeing Iraq, Applicant stayed in Jordan as a refugee from 2006 to 2008. He
then applied to immigrate to the United States. He and his wife married in August 2008
and immigrated in December 2008. They both became naturalized citizens of the United
States in 2014. Applicant legally changed his name in 2014, because he wanted to follow
the American culture and have his name reflect a common American name, and so he
could start a new life. He also changed it for security reasons. He is aware that there are
still militias in Iraq who cultivate hate. (Tr. 36-41, 45, 62, 66-68)
Applicant and his wife have regular contact with her family in Jordan. They visited
them two or three times in Jordan since they immigrated to the United States. Their most
recent visit was in 2017. (Tr. 41-45, 57-62; GE 1, 2, 3)
In  Applicant’s  May  2017  security  clearance  application,  he  stated  that  he  has
renounced  his  Iraqi  citizenship  since  becoming  a  U.S.  citizen.  His  Iraqi  passport  has
expired and he does not intend to ever renew it. GE 1
Applicant’s  wife  was  a  dentist  in  Iraq.  She  worked  as  a  dental  assistant  in  the
United States from 2009 to 2015. She was diagnosed with cancer in 2015, and did not
work. She recently took the national dental boards to be certified and licensed as a dentist
in the United States. (Tr.41-42, 48-49)
Applicant’s mother, four brothers, and three sisters are citizens and residents of
Iraq. Two brothers are married, and his three sisters are married. All are citizens of Iraq.
Applicant’s father is deceased. Two of his sisters are teachers and the other works in a
bank. Three of his brothers are jewelers and one is a student. His mother is a homemaker.
Applicant has no current information about his family in Iraq beyond 2015. (Tr. 55; GE 1,
2, 3)
In 2012, Applicant applied for refugee status for two of his brothers to immigrate to
the  United  States.  In  2014,  he  applied  for  the  rest  of  his  family  to  immigrate.  Their
applications are still pending. One of his brothers died of cancer, and in 2015 the other
came to U.S. He stayed for about a month and was homesick. His father was sick and
his parents  wanted  his  brother to  return to  Iraq.  Applicant  warned  his family  that  if  his
brother returned to Iraq he would not be permitted to return to the United States. Applicant
was  concerned  about  his  brother’s  future  in  Iraq.  He  told  his  family  that  if  his  brother
returned to Iraq, Applicant would cut ties with the family. His brother returned to Iraq in
2015,  and  Applicant  has  not  had  any  contact  with  any  family  members  since  then.
Applicant testified that he will not visit his family in Iraq. If they chose to visit him in Jordan
or Kuwait, he would agree. Applicant’s wife also does not have contact with his family in
Iraq. (Tr. 49-54, 70-73; GE 2, 3,)
Applicant stated that he does not hate his family in Iraq. If they were to immigrate
to the United States, he would welcome a relationship with them. However, his concerns
are with Iraq, and if his family lives there, he will not have contact with them. He does not
trust the Iraqi government and many of its people. (Tr. 53-54, 70-73)
Applicant’s  father  was  a  jeweler  and  had  a  small  factory  in  Iraq.  He  also  had  a
house  and  some  land.  His  father  told  him  the  property  was  worth  about  $50  million.
Applicant  believes  his  father  was  confused  about  the  value  of  the  property  and  its
conversion to U.S. dollars. Applicant contacted a real estate agent in Jordan to determine
the  actual value  of  the  property,  if  it  were  sold.  He  provided  a  document from  the  real
estate agent with the estimated value of the property as $950,000. According to Islamic
law, one-eighth of the amount would go to his mother. The remaining amount would go
to the children, with the males receiving twice as much as the females. (Answer to the
SOR)  Applicant  has  no  information  about  whether  or  not  the  property  has  been  sold
because he has no contact with his family. If the property was sold, he would likely inherit
a share, but noted he had a big family so it would be divided accordingly. (Tr. 62-66)
Applicant stated that in 2003, as part of the Iraqi military, he was working against
the United States, but he never fought against U.S. forces. After the invasion, he worked
with U.S. security forces. (Tr. 73-85)
Applicant worked as a role player employed by U.S. defense contractors from April
2009 to April 2010. He has employment as a linguist with a defense contractor pending
the disposition of his security clearance. The terms of his employment are that he will not
be sent to Iraq. However, Applicant said he would acquiesce and go to Iraq if the United
States  Government  ordered  him  to  do  so.  As  a former military  officer, he  would follow
orders. Applicant was also a self-employed limousine and truck driver for a time. He and
his wife intend to remain in the United States. They do not own property in the U.S. They
have no assets in Iraq or Jordan. All of their assets are in the United States. Because he
was kidnapped and almost killed in Iraq, he continues to be concerned for his safety in
Iraq and has no intention of returning. (Tr. 45-48, 52-53, 85-88; GE 1, 2, 3)
Applicant provided a character letter from a former senior deputy minister in Iraq
now living in the United States. He worked with Applicant from 2003 to 2004. He noted
that Applicant was working as a police officer and was involved in important  missions.
Applicant worked with the senior deputy minister’s team, who were in charge of protecting
him  and  other  high  profile  visitors  from  the  Coalition  Provision  Authorities  in  Iraq.  He
described  Applicant  as  a  dedicated  professional  with  high  ethical  standards.  Applicant
was trusted during a time when Iraq was going through a difficult period. Applicant willingly
performed his duties under difficult circumstances. (AE A)

Applicant was born in  India to  Indian  parents.  He married  his wife  in  India a  few
months before he  came  to  the  United  States in  1998. He became a U.S. citizen  in 2008.
India  does not permit dual citizenship, and  he  renounced  his Indian  citizenship when  he
became   a   U.S.  citizen.  His   wife   is   originally   from  India.  She   is   now   a   U.S.   citizen,

Applicant started his first business in the United States in  2003. He sold  his share
of   the   business   in  2009.   He   worked   part   time   for  the   company   that   acquired   his
company  until 2015. He  currently  is part owner of  three  U.S. businesses. He became  a
partner in a  property  management company  in 2009. The  defense  contracting  company
was started  by  two  of  Applicant’s friends. Applicant  became  a  partner in the  company  in
2013.  (Tr. at  22-23; GE 1, 2; AE A)
Applicant  is  principal  owner  (50%)  and  chief  executive  officer  of  an  information
technology  (IT)  and  engineering  staffing  company  that  was  started  in  2015.  The
company  provides  IT  professionals  and  engineers  to  other  companies.  The  IT
professionals and engineers are employees of Applicant’s company, but work at various
other  companies  in  the  United  States.  Applicant’s  company  has  a  subsidiary  staffing
company  that  provides  healthcare  workers  to  companies  and  healthcare  facilities.  His
company  also  has  a  wholly  owned  subsidiary  in  India  that  works  at  placing  the
company’s  IT  professionals  and  engineers  in  the  United  States  at  companies  in  the
United States. The Indian subsidiary is purely support for the U.S. business. It does not
place  any  individuals  in  Indian  businesses,  and  it  does  not  generate  any  income  in
India.  Applicant  estimated  that  the  company  has  about  700  employees  in  the  United
States,  which  includes  about  20  permanent  employees,  with  the  remainder  of  the
employees  working   at   other  companies.   The   company   has  about   320   employees   in
India.   Applicant  estimated   the   value   of   his  share  of   the   company   at  $7   to   $10   million.
The  company  does not have  any  defense  contracts, and  there is no  plan  to  pursue  any
in the  future.  (Tr. at  23-31;  Applicant’s response to  SOR; GE 1, 2)
Applicant owns 50  percent  of  the  defense  contracting  company. That company  is
much  smaller than  his  staffing  company. It  is primarily  for Applicant  and  his partners to
work  as  contractors.   He  estimates   the   value   of  his  share   of  that   company   at   $20,000.
(Tr. at  31-33; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  frequently   talks  to   his  parents   and   sister,  and   he   regularly   travels  to
India to  visit his family  and to  oversee his staffing  company. He periodically  gave  money
to   his  parents,  and   he   maintains   bank  accounts  in   India,   including   at  least  one   joint
account  with  his  father. The  accounts were used  to  facilitate  the  transfer of  funds to  his
parents  and   for  Applicant  to   use   when   he   is   in  India.   About  five   to   seven   years  ago,
Applicant  gave   his father about $50,000   to  help  renovate   his house   and  to   replace   an
old car.  Applicant  has  less than  $5,000  in his  Indian  accounts  at  present. He  estimates

"Applicant admitted the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.a (that his sister is a citizen-resident
of  Iraq).  He  denied  the  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  1.b  (that  his  brother  is  a  citizen  of  Iraq
residing  in  Austria),  because  his  brother  is  currently  residing  in  Iraq.  Applicant’s  SOR
admissions and those at his hearing are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a
thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant, his parents, five brothers, and two sisters were born and raised in Iraq.
His  father  died  in  1990.  (Tr.  37)  His  mother  is  a  U.S.  permanent  resident  living  in  the
United  States.  She  owns  the  family  home  in  Iraq,  a  two  bedroom  house,  with  an
estimated  value  between  $200,000  and  $400,000.  Applicant  testified  that  no  one  is
currently residing in that property. He does not know who would inherit it at his mother’s
death. (Tr. 41 -42)
Applicant, 36, was educated in Iraq and received a bachelor’s degree in January
2007. He testified that while in high school and college, he sometimes volunteered as a
translator  for  U.S.  personnel.  Applicant  was  issued an  Iraqi  passport  in  January  2007,
and he used it to travel to Syria that same year. He also used his Iraqi passport to travel
from the United States to Canada in June 2012. His Iraqi passport expired in July 2015.
Between  July  2007  and  January  2009,  Applicant  worked  as  an  interpreter  for  a
federal  contractor  providing  services  to  U.S.  personnel  in  Iraq.  He  knew  the  job  had
risks  associated  with  it,  but  the  pay  was  good  and  he  had  no  other  employment
opportunities.  He  believed  that  taking  the  job  was  his  commitment  to  helping  the  Iraqi
people  and  the  United  States.  Applicant  received  three  recommendations  from  U.S.
personnel that supervised him when he worked as an interpreter in Iraq. (AE 1 and 2)
In 2009, Applicant received a threat from the Al Mahdi Army because of his work
for the United States. The threatening letter included bullets and a note indicating that
they  knew  he  was  working  for  the  United  States  and  they  would  get  him.  Applicant
provided  the  letter  to  U.S.  authorities  investigating  the  threat.  (Tr.  54  –  55)  After  the
threat,  he  moved  from  his  mother’s  home  to  one  of  his  brother’s  residence.  Applicant
was granted refugee status and immigrated to the United States on September 9, 2010.
He  was  granted  permanent  residency  a  year  later,  and  became  a  naturalized  U.S.
citizen in June 2016.
Between November 2010 and April 2011, Applicant worked selling pizza. He then
worked  for  a  company  from  April  2011  to  May  2016.  In  April  2016,  Applicant  paid
$247,000 in cash for a home (currently in his name). He explained that he saved most
of the money from his earnings and that all of his siblings contributed money to buy the
property.  Although  it  is  in  his  name,  Applicant  considers  the  property  as  his  mother’s
property – as the family’s home. His mother and five siblings live in the home.
Applicant was unemployed between May 2016 and August 2017, and supported
himself  with  his  state’s  unemployment  benefits.  A  federal  contractor  offered  him  a
position  as  a  linguist  in  Iraq  in  March  2017.  The  offer  is  contingent  on  Applicant’s
eligibility  for  a  security  clearance.  He  submitted  his  first  security  clearance  application
on April 20, 2017. While waiting for his clearance, Applicant was hired in August 2017,
as  a  technical  specialist  by  his  current  employer,  a  large  U.S.  software-hardware
manufacturing company. (Tr. 57 – 58)
Applicant married his wife in March 2020, and they are expecting a baby. She is
a 30-year-old, Iraqi-born, permanent U.S. resident. Her father was a major in the Iraqi
Army. He was threatened by an Iraqi militia, and her family fled to Egypt. She and her
brother  were  granted  refugee  status  and  entered  the  United  States  in  2012.  She
became  a  U.S.  permanent  resident  in  2013,  and  applied  for  her  naturalization  in  May
2020.  Applicant  anticipates  her  naturalization  in  the  near  future.  (Tr.  57  -  60)  Her
mother, father, and sister are still in Egypt seeking refugee status or to immigrate to the
United States. (Tr. 59 – 60)
Applicant  owns  a  car  and  is  renting  an  apartment  for  himself  and  his  wife.  He
indicated  that  he  currently  has  no  savings,  but  has  about  $4,000  in  a  retirement
account. He is pursuing a master’s degree in cyber security at a U.S. university.
Applicant  has  four  brothers  (ages  32,  49,  54,  and  57)  and  one  sister  (age  56),
that are permanent U.S. residents living with his mother in the family home in the United
States. One of Applicant’s brothers, age 56, is currently a citizen-resident of Iraq. (SOR
¶  1.b)  Applicant  went  to  live  with  this  brother  after  he  was  threatened  in  2009  for
working as a U.S. interpreter. Apparently, his brother was afraid for his life and also fled
to Austria seeking refugee status. Austria denied his request for asylum, and his brother
returned to Iraq where he currently resides with his wife and three children. He is a taxi
driver. Applicant testified that in 2012, he also applied for refugee status for his brother
and  sister  in  Iraq,  but  it  was  not  granted.  Applicant  traveled  to  Austria  in  2016  and
stayed  with  his  brother  for  about  one  week.  Applicant  communicates  with  his  brother
once or twice a month via social media.

One  of  Applicant’s  sisters,  age  51,  is  a  citizen-resident  of  Iraq.  (SOR  ¶  1.a)
During  his  counterintelligence
interview  (interview),
Applicant stated that his family disowned his sister because she married his cousin and
the family did not approve. (GE 2) However, in October 2015, his sister sent Applicant
$10,000  from  Iraq  to  help  support  the  family  in  the  United  States.  (GE  3;  Tr.  44  -  45)
Currently, Applicant and this sister have telephonic contact every two weeks. However,
his  other  siblings  and  mother  have  daily  contact  with  his  sister  in  Iraq.  (Tr.  33  –  34)
According  to  Applicant,  his  sister’s  husband  is  retired.  He  used  to  work  for  the  Iraqi
government in a shoe factory.
During his June 2017 interview (GE 2), Applicant stated that he was a citizen of
two  countries,  Iraq  and  the  United  States.  When  questioned  further,  he  stated  he
considers  the  U.S.  his  country  and  that  he  would  never  betray  the  United  States.  He
expressed that it was his dream as a child to come to the United States. He believes he
earned  his  right  to  be  a  U.S.  citizen  when  he  risked  his  life  working  for  the  United
States,  and  that  he  and  his  family  endured  hardships  to  come  to  the  United  States.
When  questioned  about  renouncing  his  Iraqi  citizenship,  Applicant  replied  “the  U.S.
allows me to have both.” He later qualified that he would renounce his Iraqi citizenship if
required  for  his  position.  Applicant  believes  that  he  is  not  subject  to  any  foreign
influence because his family lives in the United States.
Applicant testified that he has friends that are officers in the Iraqi Army – one is a
major  and  the  other  a  lieutenant.  (Tr.  38  –  39)  They  became  friends  while  he  was  in
college. He communicates with them infrequently via internet and social media.
Concerning  Iraq,  I  took  administrative  notice  that  the  U.S.  Department  of  State
warns  that  travel  within  Iraq  remains  very  dangerous  and  the  ability  of  the  U.S.
Embassy to assist U.S. citizens is extremely limited. U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high risk
for kidnapping and terrorist violence. Numerous terrorist and insurgent groups are active
in  Iraq,  including  ISIS.  Such  groups  regularly  attack  Iraqi  security  forces  and  civilians.
Anti-U.S.  sectarian  militias  and  criminal  elements  may  also  threaten  U.S.  citizens  and
western companies throughout Iraq.
Severe  human  rights  problems  are  widespread  in  Iraq.  Sectarian  hostility,
widespread corruption, and lack of transparency at all levels of government and society
weakened the government’s authority and worsened effective human rights protections.
Problems include harsh and life-threatening conditions in detention and prison facilities;
arbitrary  arrests  and  lengthy  pretrial  detention;  limits  on  freedom  of  expression  to
include press, social, religious and political restrictions in academic and cultural matters;
discrimination  against  and  societal  abuse  of  women  and  ethnic,  religious,  and  racial
minorities; seizure of property without due process and limitations of worker rights.

allegations  ¶¶  1.f.  and  1.g.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,
exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  35-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  (GX  1  at  page  7,
and TR at page 16 lines 5~6.) He has been employed with the defense contractor since
August of 2018. (GX 1 at page 19.) Applicant was born in the United States; but as a
child,  he was  taken to  Taiwan by  his  Taiwanese parents. (GX  1 at  page 7,  and TR  at
page 16 line 7 to page 18 line 2.) He returned to the United States in 2016, has received
a Master’s Degree from an American university, and is pursuing a Ph.D. from that same
university.  (TR  at  page  18  line  3  to  page  24  line  9.)    He  is  married,  and  has  one
American born child, age 2. GX 1 at page 38.)
Guideline B - Foreign Influence
1.a. Applicant’s parents are citizens and residents of Taiwan. (TR at page 25 line
6 to page 30 line 21.) However, “they have been separated for more than 30 year.” (Id.)
His mother is a retired nurse, having been retired “for more than 20 years.” (TR at page
25 line 10 to page 26 line 10.) She never worked for the Taiwanese government, and he
contacts her only about “four times a year.” (TR at page 25 line 6 to page 30 line 21.)
Applicant’s  father  is  “a  dentist.”  (TR  at  page  26  lines  11~19.)  Apart  from  his
mandatory  military  service,  Applicant’s  father  had  no  connection  with  the  Taiwanese
government.  (TR  at  page  25  line  6  to  page  30  line  21.)  He  contacts  his  father  about
“once every year.” (TR at page 29 lines 7~18.)
1.b.  Applicant’s two sisters are citizens and residents of Taiwan. (TR at page 30
line 22 to page 34 line 6.) His oldest sister has mental health issues, and his youngest
sister is a veterinarian. (Id, and at page 71 lines 15~17.) Applicant has little contact with
his oldest sister, and only about four times a year with his youngest sister. (TR at page
30  line  22  to  page  34  line  6.)  Neither  sister  has  any  connection  with  the  Taiwanese
government.
1.c.  Applicant’s  mother-in-law  and  father-in-law  are  citizens  and  residents  of
Taiwan. (TR at page 34 line 11 to page 36 line 3.) His mother-in-law is “a cook,” and his
father-in-law is “retired.” (TR at page 71 lines 18~25.)  Through  his  wife,  Applicant  has
contact with these in-laws about  four times a year. (TR at page 34 line 11 to page 36
line 3.)
1.d.   Applicant’s sister-in-law is citizens and resident of Taiwan. (TR at page 37
line 7 to page 39 line 8.) She is a “full-time mother,” and their contact is limited to about
twice a year. (Id, and TR at page 72 at lines 1~3.)
1.e. Applicant maintains contact, about once or twice a year, with friends who are
citizens of Taiwan, but for the most part reside in the United States. (TR at page 37 line
7 to page 39 line 8.)  None are affiliated with the Taiwanese government, and he met
them through his university schooling in the United States. (Id.)
1.f.  Applicant  denies  that  he  owns  any  real  property  in  Taiwan.  He  transferred
ownership to his wife, who is in the process of selling said property. (TR at page 39 line
9 to page 43 line 13, at page 54 lines 7~16, and AppX A and B.) Furthermore, they are
in  the  process  of  purchasing  real  property  in  the  United  States,  as  evidenced  by
documentation. (AppXs V and W.)
1.g. Applicant denies that he has two bank accounts in Taiwan, valued at about
$50,000.  He  has  transferred  said  funds  to  the  United  States,  as  evidenced  by
documentation to that end. (TR at page 43 line 14 to page 45 line 21, and AppXs C, D,
E~I.)

SOR  allegations  ¶¶  1.a~1.d,  and  1.g.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  46-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  (GX  1  at  pages  5
and  13.)  He  has  a  Bachelor’s  Degree,  and  two  Master’s  Degrees  from  American
universities. (TR at page 15 lines 6~19.) Applicant has been employed with the defense
contractor since April of 2017. (GX 1 at page 13, and TR at page 59 line 20 to page 61
line 18.) He is married to a U.S. citizen. (GX 1 at pages 21~22.)
Guideline B - Foreign Influence
1.a.~1.d.  Applicant  categorically  denies  these  allegations  regarding  a  former
business  interest  in  Pakistan.  His  American  company  dealt  with  solar  panels.  (TR  at
page 18 line 3 to page 24 line 12, and AppX F.) It was deregistered in the United States
and Pakistan in in 2019, as evidenced by formal documentation submitted by Applicant
on behalf of his former business. (TR at page 18 line 3 to page 24 line 12, and AppXs A
and E.)
Applicant’s  enrolment  with  the  solar  panel  company  was  never  “hidden,”  as
alleged.  This  is  clear  from  the  registration  and  deregistration  documentation,  noted
above. He  did draft email correspondence to Pakistan’s Minister of Finance (AppX B),
but  it  was  for  his  American  nephew,  who  was  the  company’s  Chief  Operating  Officer.
(TR at page 27 line 5 to page 30 line 1, at page 46 line 22 to page 48 line 10, and AppX
C.)
While  the  former  company  did  employ  six  Pakistani  relatives,  it’s  foreign  bank
accounts  have  been  closed,  as  evidenced  by  banking  documentation.  (TR  at  page  30
line 2 to page 32 line 7, and AppXs G and H.)
1.e. Applicant’s 70 year-old mother and 74 year-old father are dual nationals with
Pakistan.  (TR  at  page  32  line  8  to  page  34  line  10,  and  GX  1  at  pages  24~28.)  His
mother is not employed and his father is retired from a U.S. state “transit authority.” (Id.)
Apart from their primary residence in the United States, “they own a house in . . . [their]
village,” which they visit “once every two years . . . [for] about three months” at a time.
(TR at page 32 line 8 to page 33 line 17.)
1.f. and 1.g. Applicant’s brother-in-law is a citizen and resident of Pakistan. (TR
at  page  34  lines  11~14.)  Between  2013~2016,  Applicant  lent  his  mother-in-law  about
$35,723 to fund the brother-in-law’s “startup home building business,” and to “help build
a family home” for his mother-in-law in Pakistan. (TR at page 34 line 11 to page 37 line
15.)  These  monies  have  been  repaid,  and  Applicant’s  mother-in-law  now  lives  in  the
United States. (TR at page 62 line 7 to page 64 line 2, and AppXs M and N.)
1.h. Applicant’s father-in-law is a citizen and resident of Pakistan. (TR at page 37
line  16  to  page  38  line  23.)  “He  works  .  .  .  on  a  dairy  farm.”  As  they  speak  different
dialects, Applicant has spoken to his father-in-law in person “probably [only] five times”
during the 12 years that he has been married. (Id.)
1.i.  Applicant’s male cousin is a citizen and resident of Pakistan. (TR at page 38
line 24 to page 40 line 15.) He is “a barber.” (TR at page 64 line 16 to page 65 line 4.)
Applicant has spoken to his cousin “five to 10 times over the last 40 years. (TR at page
38 line 24 to page 40 line 15.)
1.j. Applicant’s uncle is a citizen and resident of Pakistan. (TR at page 40 line 11
to page 41 line 4.) He is also “a barber.” (TR at page 65 lines 5~8.) Applicant has met
with or spoken to his uncle perhaps only three times. (TR at page 40 line 11 to page 41
line 5.)
1.k.  Over  the  last  13  years,  since  2007,  Applicant  has  provided  his  Pakistani
family  about  $4,000,  normally  in  increments  of  $300~$500  pursuant,  to  the  Muslim
tradition “called Zakth.” (TR at page 41 line 5 to page 42 line 16.)
Notice
I take administrative notice of the following facts regarding The Islamic Republic
of  Pakistan:  Pakistan  is  a  federal  parliamentary  republic.  The  U.S.  State  Department
has  issued  a  Level  3;  Reconsider  travel  advisory  to  Pakistan  due  to  terrorism.  The
Pakistani military and intelligence services nominally reported to civilian authorities but
essentially operate without effective civilian oversight. (HE 1 at pages 1~5.)

"Applicant’s admissions to the foreign or dual citizenships of his family members;
to  the  Saudi  residency  of  his  sister,  two  brothers,  and  parents-in-law;  to  the  Egyptian
residency of his father; and to his college scholarship from the Saudi government, are
accepted  and  incorporated  as  findings  of  fact.  After  considering  the  FORM,  which
includes Applicant’s response to the SOR, and Applicant’s December 30, 2019 response
to the FORM (AE A), I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 29-year-old dual citizen of the United States and Saudi Arabia. He
was born in the United States to Saudi citizens. (Item 3.) The FORM does not contain any
explanation for why his parents were in the United States at the time of his birth in 1990.
On his June 25, 2019 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86), Applicant
explained  that  his  father  was  from  a royal family  in  Yemen  that  was  forced to  flee  the
country after its 1962 civil war, and that Saudi Arabia gave the family asylum and allowed
his father to keep his family title. (Item 3.) Applicant told an authorized investigator for the
OPM on December 14, 2015, that his family emigrated as refugees from Yemen to Saudi
Arabia in the 1960s. (Item 4.) His SF 86 indicates that his mother was born in Egypt. (Item
3.)
Applicant has four siblings: two sisters ages 34 and 21 and two brothers ages 38
and 31. According to his SF 86, his 21-year-old sister was born in Egypt while his other
siblings  were  born  in  the  United  States.  Applicant  and  his  siblings  acquired  Saudi
citizenship through their parents. (Item 3.) Applicant told an OPM investigator that he lived
in Egypt and Saudi Arabia as a minor. (Item 4.)
Applicant  moved  to  Saudi  Arabia  in  August  2004  and  acquired  his  Saudi
citizenship in approximately July 2006. Applicant acquired a passport from Saudi Arabia
in late August 2006, which he renewed over the years. His current Saudi passport expires
in December 2021. Applicant traveled extensively on his Saudi passport to countries in
the  region  (Bahrain,  United  Arab  Emirates  (UAE),  Lebanon,  and  Egypt)  between  July
2007 and October 2010. (Items 3-4.)
After passing examinations in Saudi Arabia, Applicant came to the United States.
He had recently obtained his U.S. passport on December 4, 2010, and he lived with an
uncle in the United States for the next year. According to Applicant, his uncle is a Saudi
citizen who has never been employed in the United States and has no affiliation with a
foreign government, military, security, defense industry, or intelligence service. Applicant
obtained  his  General  Education  Diploma  (GED)  and  pursued  studies  at  a  community
college until August 2011, when he enrolled in a four-year university in the United States
on a full scholarship funded by Saudi Arabia’s government. Over the next four years, he
also received a monthly stipend of $1,850 from the Saudi government to cover his living
expenses as well as health insurance. Applicant obtained the scholarship based on his
Saudi citizenship. While pursuing his bachelor’s degree, which he earned in May 2015,
Applicant  had  quarterly  contact  with  a  local  advisor  from  the  Saudi  Arabian  Cultural
Mission, to whom he had to submit his transcripts. (Items 2-4.) Applicant indicates that he
had  to  meet  “certain  requirements”  while  in  school,  although  he  did  not  specify  the
requirements. He denies any contact with the advisor since he graduated, and there is no
evidence to the contrary. (Item 4.)
Applicant went to Saudi Arabia from December 2013 to January 2014 to visit his
family and for his engagement celebration to his now spouse. He used his Saudi passport,
renewed in July 2011 for another five years, to enter and exit Saudi Arabia. (Items 3-4.)
He was issued a personal identity card in Saudi Arabia to facilitate travel between Gulf
Cooperation Council countries without a Saudi passport. (Item 4.)
During his last semester in college, Applicant had a part-time, unpaid internship in
finance  with  a  real  estate  developer.  (Item  3.)  From  July  2015  to  December  2016,
Applicant  held  full-time  employment  in  the  United  States  as  a  financial  analyst  with  a
defense  contractor.  He  applied  for  a  DOD  security  clearance  at  that  time,  and  was
interviewed on December 14, 2015, by an OPM investigator. He admitted that he holds
dual  citizenship  and  passports  with  the  United  States  and  Saudi  Arabia,  and  that  his
college degree was paid for by a full scholarship valued at $200,000 from Saudi Arabia’s
government.  Applicant  stated  that  he  would  be  reluctant  to  surrender  his  passport  or
renounce his citizenship with Saudi Arabia because he feels he would be disrespectful
and because several of his family members and his fiancée were living there at the time.
Applicant explained that he was considered for a position by a company based in Saudi
Arabia (apparently in May 2015 per his SF 86), but he was not interested in working in
Saudi  Arabia.  He  expressed  “ultimate  allegiance”  to  the  United  States  as  his  moral
compass, ideals, and religion align with the United States. Applicant explained about his
travels in the Persian Gulf that he went to Bahrain about 15 to 20 times to go to the movies
or to shop because it was only 30 to 40 minutes away from his home in Saudi Arabia;
traveled to Egypt to visit his father; went to the UAE to see his brother, who was living
there at the time; and went to Lebanon to visit his grandmother, who had an apartment
there at the time. He returned to Saudi Arabia only one time since coming to the United
States in December 2010, for 21 to 30 days from December 2013 to January 2014 for his
engagement ceremony and to visit family members. (Item 4.)
Applicant was contacted by telephone by an OPM investigator on December 16,
2015, to clarify information regarding his relatives and foreign contacts. He provided the
full names of his siblings and detailed the extent of his contacts with his cousin, a dual
citizen of the United States and Saudi Arabia, with whom he was sharing an apartment.
He was re-contacted on December 17, 2015, for further clarification about  his parents’
names. (Item 4.) There is no indication that he reported to the investigator any plans to
travel to Saudi Arabia.
Applicant  indicated  on  a  June  2019  SF  86  that  he  married  his  spouse  in  Saudi
Arabia on December 25, 2015, but also his “wedding ceremony” was on March 18, 2017.
(Item  3.)  On  February  11,  2016,  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  different  OPM
investigator. Regarding his “fiancée,” Applicant related that she is a dual citizen of Saudi
Arabia  and  France,  and  that  they  met  ten  years  ago  in  Saudi  Arabia  through  a  family
friend. He indicated that he had almost daily contact with her, by telephone or Internet
chat.  Because  of  their  relationship,  he  also  had  contact  with  his  “future  in-laws”  once
every two weeks by electronic chat. (Item 4.) There is no indication in the record that he
told the investigator about any December 2015 marriage in Saudi Arabia.
Applicant met with the same OPM investigator on February 17, 2016, for further
details about his foreign contacts. He indicated that his “fiancée” was born in France and
works as a graphic designer in Saudi Arabia; that her father was born in Yemen and is
employed as chairman of a medical department in a hospital and also  as an assistant
professor for health sciences; and that her mother is a native of Lebanon and works as a
French teacher in Saudi Arabia. Applicant also disclosed that he has monthly contact with
his grandmother, who is a homemaker in Saudi Arabia. He explained that none of these
foreign nationals knew that he was under consideration for a sensitive position, and that
they were not affiliated with a foreign government or military organization. (Item 4.) As
with his interview a week prior, there is no indication that he mentioned a trip to Saudi
Arabia for his marriage in December 2015.
Applicant  left  his  job  for  a  better-paying  position  as  a  help-desk  technician  with
another federal contractor in December 2016. He stayed in that position only through July
2017.  In August  2017,  he began his  current  employment  as a business analyst  with a
technology company that contracts with the DOD. (Item 3.)
In January 2018, Applicant traveled to the UAE for his oldest brother’s wedding. In
July 2018, Applicant took a “road trip” through three European countries with his spouse
and her family. In December 2018, Applicant went to Saudi Arabia for over two weeks to
visit his spouse’s family, his grandmother, and his older sister. On December 19, 2018,
Applicant’s  personal  identity card was renewed by Saudi Arabia  for  another five years.
(Item 3.)
Applicant completed an SF 86 on June 25, 2019. He indicated on his SF 86 that
he  and  his  spouse  married  in  Saudi  Arabia  in  late  December  2015,  but  also  that  he
traveled to Saudi Arabia in  March 2017 for their “wedding ceremony” on March 18. He
indicated that they were presently living together in the United States, and that she had a
“Green  Card”  under  his  sponsorship  valid  to  March  19,  2028.  Given  U.S.  Permanent
Resident cards are valid for ten years (see www.uscis.gov), she apparently obtained her
Green Card in March 2018. She came to the United States in April 2017. Applicant also
indicated on his SF 86 that he has been cohabiting since September 1, 2016, with his
mother, who immigrated to the United States under his sponsorship in June 2016, and
has a Permanent Resident Card that expires on August 18, 2028, and with his younger
sister, who has an I-20 Form for student and exchange visitors and a visa valid to June
24, 2021. His sister, a Saudi citizen, is attending college, and his mother is traveling to
see her mother in  Saudi  Arabia. Applicant reported that he had  contact every other day
of late with  his father in  Egypt,  who planned  to release  a feature film in  October 2019.
Applicant also disclosed that his older sister and  two  brothers, who hold dual  citizenship
with the United States and  Saudi  Arabia,  live in  Saudi Arabia, where his sister owns a
“co-working space,” and  his oldest brother works for  an American credit lender. He  did
not report an  employer for his  other brother nor  report the extent of his contacts with his
siblings  in   Saudi  Arabia.  Regarding  his  parents-in-law,   who  have   dual  citizenship  with
France  and   Saudi   Arabia  and   live  in   Saudi   Arabia,   Applicant   indicated  he  had   weekly
contact  with  them,   primarily  through   web  chat.  At  least  once   a  month,   he  called  his
spouse’s parents through   a mobile   application. Applicant also listed that he  had  held a
full  scholarship   to  attend  college  in   the  United  States  from   Saudi   Arabia,  and   that  his
younger sister has  been receiving a monthly stipend  and  health insurance from the Saudi
government to pay for her college in  the  United States since August 2018. The  estimated
total  value of her scholarship is $150,000. Applicant  disclosed the names of his former
and his sister’s current advisors from the Saudi Arabian Cultural Mission.
As of Applicant’s September 2019 Answer to the SOR, Applicant’s older sister and
two brothers were living in Saudi Arabia. Applicant’s sister still owned her own “artistic co-
working space,” his oldest brother was still working for the U.S.-based credit lender, and
his other brother was employed by a Saudi oil company. Although Applicant expressed
that he was thankful to Saudi Arabia for the full scholarship that paid for his college studies
in the United States, he stated,
I  am  thankful  to  the  government  of  Saudi  Arabia  for  that  privilege  [of
attending  university  for  free  in  the  United  States],  but  as  an  adult  I  have
never considered living in Saudi Arabia. I have chosen to live as a proud

Administrative Notice
Administrative  or  official   notice   is  the  appropriate   type  of  notice  used  for
administrative  proceedings.  See   ISCR   Case  No.  16-02522  at  2-3  (App.  Bd.  July  12,
2017); ISCR  Case No. 05-11292 at 4  n.  1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12,  2007); ISCR  Case No. 02-
24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb.
10, 2004) and  McLeod v. Immigration and  Naturalization Service, 802  F.2d 89, 93 n. 4
(3d Cir.  1986)).  Usually administrative notice at ISCR  proceedings is accorded to facts
that are either well  known or from government reports. See  Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW,
Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006)  (listing fifteen types of facts  for administrative notice).
After reviewing the source documents relied on by the Government, I have taken
administrative notice of the facts set forth in the Government’s October 2, 2019 requests
and incorporate them by reference in this decision. For additional background information
regarding the two countries relationships with the U.S., I have reviewed the U.S. State
Department’s  respective  Bilateral  Relations  Fact  Sheet,  issued  for  Saudi  Arabia  on
November  26,  2019, and for  Egypt  on September  20, 2019. Of particular  note  are the
following salient facts.
Saudi Arabia is ruled by King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud as both head of state
and  head  of  government.  Its  1992  Basic  Law  provides  for  the  system  of  governance,
rights of citizens, and the powers and duties of the government, including that the Quran
and  Sunna  serve  as  the  country’s  constitution,  and  that  the  male  descendants  of  its
founder rule the country.
While the country’s most recent municipal elections in 2015 were held without any
significant irregularities, and women were allowed to vote and run as candidates for the
first time, government agents killed and dismembered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi
in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, in October 2018. King Salman pledged to hold
accountable  all  those  involved,  but  by  late  2018,  the  Saudi  government’s  Public
Prosecutor’s Office had not named 11 indicted suspects. In spring 2019, the U.S. State
Department publicly designated 16 officials of the Saudi government as ineligible for entry
in the United States because of their roles in the murder of Khashoggi. On December 10,
2019,  the  U.S.  State  Department  designated  Mohammed  al  Otaibi,  former  counsel
general of  Saudi  Arabia in Istanbul under  Section 7031(c)  of the Department  of  State,
Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriation Act 2019, as ineligible for entry
into  the  United  States  because  of  his  involvement  in  Khashoggi’s  murder.  The  State
Department urged the Saudi government to conduct a full, fair, and transparent trial of
those responsible and to hold those involved accountable. In December 2019, after a trial
that was closed to the public and lacked transparency, a Saudi court sentenced five to
death in the killing but cleared the two most senior officials implicated, including al Otaibi.
In 2018, other significant human rights abuses included unlawful killings, including
executions  for  nonviolent  offenses;  forced  disappearances;  torture  of  prisoners  and
detainees  by  government  agents;  arbitrary  arrest  and detention,  arbitrary  interference
with privacy; restrictions on freedom of peaceable assembly, association, and movement;
severe  restrictions  on  religious  freedom;  citizen’s  lack  of  freedom  to  choose  their  own
government; trafficking in persons; and violence and official discrimination against women
and members of the LBGTQ community. Saudi law is based on the local interpretation of
Sharia law and is influenced by local customs and practices. U.S. citizens are subject to
all local laws and authorities may expel, arrest, imprison, and even execute those violating
the law, even unknowingly.
A  Saudi-led  coalition  continued  to  conduct  air  strikes  in  Yemen  that  resulted  in
civilian  casualties  and  damage  to  infrastructure.  The  U.S.  State  Department’s  current
travel advisory for Saudi Arabia is Level 2 – exercise increased caution – due to terrorism
and the threat of missile and drone attacks on civilian targets. U.S. citizens are advised
to not  travel within 50 miles of Yemen because of  terrorism and  armed conflict. The  U.S.
warns that terrorist groups may attack with little  or no warning, targeting both Saudi and
Western government interests,  mosques and other religious sites,  and  places  frequented
by  U.S.  citizens  and   westerners.  Missile  attacks  from  rebel   groups  in   Yemen  have
targeted major  cities,  such as Riyadh and  Jeddah; Riyadh’s international airport; Saudi
Aramco  facilities;  and  vessels  in   the  Red  Sea  shipping  lanes.  The   airport   in   Abha,  in
southeastern Saudi  Arabia, has been under frequent attack, and  U.S. mission personnel
are not allowed to use the airport without Chief of Mission approval.
The  United  States and  Saudi  Arabia have  had  full diplomatic relations since 1940.
Saudi Arabia’s significant  oil reserves and  its strategic location and role in  the Arab and
Islamic worlds have  played a role in  the  longstanding bilateral relationship between the
two countries. The  United States  and  Saudi  Arabia have a common interest  in  preserving
the stability, security, and  prosperity of the Gulf region. The  United States regards Saudi
Arabia  as  a  strong   partner  in   security  and   counterterrorism  efforts  and  in   military,
diplomatic, and  financial cooperation. Saudi  Arabia is the  U.S.’ largest customer  of foreign
military  sales,  with  more  than  $100   billion  in   active  sales.  Through   its  foreign  military
sales, the United States has supported Saudi  Arabia’s Ministry of Defense, the National
Guard,  and  Ministry of  Interior. The  U.S.-Saudi  partnership is rooted in  more than seven
decades  of  close  friendship   and  cooperation,  and   the  two  countries  enjoy  a  strong
economic  relationship.   They  enjoy  robust  cultural  and  ties  with  some  55,000   Saudi
students studying at universities or engaged in  cultural exchanges in  the United States
each   year.  The   United  States,  in   cooperation  with  the  Saudi   government,  provides
technical support in  areas such as education, trade, and  economic development. Saudi
Arabia participates in some of the same international organizations as the United States,
such as the United Nations, International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and  World Trade
Organization.
Egypt is a constitutional republic governed by an elected president and unicameral
legislature.  Challengers  to  Egypt’s  incumbent  President  al-Sisi  withdrew  before  recent
presidential elections in March 2019, some citing political pressure or unfair competition.
Some  challengers  were  arrested  for  alleged  violations  of  candidacy  prohibitions  for
military  personnel.  Domestic  and  international  organizations  expressed  concern  that
government limitations on association, assembly, and expression severely constrained
broad  participation  in  the  political  process.  Egypt’s  parliament  approved  a  state  of
emergency after  an April 2017 terrorist  attack  on Coptic churches.  Egypt  was  under  a
government-declared  state  of  emergency  for  all  of  2018.  Illegal  demonstrations  have
occurred  in  Egypt  which  have  turned  volatile.  The  U.S.  State  Department’s  Office  of
Diplomatic  Security’s  Egypt  2019  Crime  &  Safety  Report:  Cairo  indicates  that  illegal
demonstrations have been quashed by Egyptian authorities in a relatively short time, but
that, because of the volatility of past demonstrations, peaceful demonstrators and even
bystanders  may  be  subject  to  questioning,  detention,  arrest,  and  conviction  for
participating in or proximity to unauthorized demonstrations.
In 2018, Egypt’s most significant human rights issues included arbitrary or unlawful
killings,  including  by  government  forces  or  its  agents  and  non-state  terrorist  groups;
10
forced  disappearances;  torture,  arbitrary  arrest  and  detention;  arbitrary  or  unlawful
interference  with  privacy;  undue  restrictions  on  free  expression,  the  press,  and  the
Internet;  substantial  interference  with  the  rights  of  peaceful  assembly  and  freedom  of
association;  restrictions  on  political  participation;  and  arbitrary  arrest  and  targeting  of
LGBT  persons  and  other  minority  groups.  Government  officials  enjoyed  a  measure  of
impunity for human rights abuses.
In  2017  and  2018,  terrorist  organizations,  including  some  affiliates  of  the  self-
proclaimed Islamic State (ISIS) terrorist group, carried out deadly attacks on government,
civilian,  and  security  targets  in  Egypt,  including  on  places  of  worship.  While  Egyptian
authorities  investigated  terrorist  attacks  and  prosecuted  alleged  perpetrators,  the  U.S.
State  Department’s  current  travel  advisory  for  Egypt  is  Level  2  –  exercise  increased
caution – due to terrorism. U.S. citizens are advised against travel to the Sinai Peninsula
(with  the  exception  of  travel  to  Sharm  El-Sheikh  by  air)  or  the  Western  Desert  due  to
terrorism.  The  U.S.  warns  that  terrorist  groups  may  attack  with  little  or  no  warning,
targeting  tourist  locations,  transportation  hubs,  markets  or  shopping  malls,  and  local
government  facilities,  and  that  there  is  a  considerable  risk  of  terrorist  attacks  in  urban
areas, including Cairo, despite  a heavy security  presence. On May 20, 2019, the U.S.
State Department issued a security alert on reports of a roadside bomb attack on a tourist
bus resulting in injuries in the area of the museum complex near the pyramids in Giza.
Cairo is reported to be at considerable risk of terrorism.
The  U.S.  seeks  to  maintain  its  traditionally  close  ties  with  Egypt.  Promoting  a
stable, prosperous Egypt, where the government protects the basic rights of its citizens,
continues to be a core objective of U.S. policy. Since 1980, the U.S. has provided Egypt
with  over  $40  billion  in  military  assistance  in  furthering  the  strategic  partnership  and
regional  stability,  and  $30  billion  in  economic  assistance.  Two-way  trade  in  goods
between the U.S. and Egypt totaled $7.5 billion in 2018. American firms are active in most
sectors of Egypt’s economy,  including oil and gas exploration and production, financial
services, manufacturing, construction, telecommunications, information technology, and
the restaurant and hospitality industry. Egypt and the U.S. belong to some of the same
international  organizations,  such  as  the  United  Nations,  International  Monetary  Fund,
World Bank, and World Trade Organization.

"Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer for about two years. He is applying for a security clearance for the
first time. He is married without children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 43, 46, 77; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  was  born  in  Iraq  to  Iraqi  parents.  He  performed  mandatory  military
service from 1991 to 1996. He returned to serve in the U.S.-backed Iraqi National Guard
from 2006 to 2008.  He worked under dangerous conditions in Iraq as a linguist for the
U.S.  military  from  2008  to  2010.  Because  of  his  work,  he  was  eligible  for  a  special
immigrant visa. He immigrated to the United States in 2010. He became a U.S. citizen
in 2015. (Tr. at 15-18, 34, 38-44, 68-73, 84-87; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2)
Applicant is one of four children. His parents and one of his siblings are citizens
and residents of Iraq. His father was a senior military officer, but he retired more than 30
years  ago.  His  brother  in  Iraq  is  a  retired  technician.  His  two  other  siblings  live  in  the
United States. One is a U.S. citizen, and the other is a permanent resident. His mother
came  to  the  United  States  for  about  six  months  in  2013,  but  she  got  homesick  and
returned  to  Iraq.  His  father  visited  the  United  States  in  2016.  Applicant  communicates
with  his  mother  about  once  a  week,  and  with  his  father  about  every  other  month.  His
parents  gave  him  about  $20,000 in  2014.  (Tr.  at  52-68;  Applicant’s  response  to  SOR;

Applicant  has  not  returned  to  Iraq  since  2012.  He  has  worked  for  a  defense
contractor  in  Kuwait  since  2018.  He  does  not  own  any  property  in  Iraq.  His  wife  is  a
citizen and resident of Thailand. He visits her from Kuwait. He bought a condominium in
Thailand for the equivalent of about $90,000 as an investment. The condominium is in a
resort area that is distant  from  where  his  wife  lives.  (Tr.  at  45,  48-4975-77,  80, 88-90;

Applicant  expressed  his  undivided  loyalty  to  the  United  States.  He  credibly
testified  that  his  family  in  Iraq  could  not  be  used  to  coerce  or  intimidate  him  into
revealing  classified  information, and  that  he would  report  any  attempt  to  do  so.  (Tr.  at
74-79, 90-92)
Applicant submitted documents and letters from U.S. military members and other
individuals  who  knew  him  in  Iraq  or  know  him  in  Kuwait.  He  is  praised  for  his
outstanding  service  as  a linguist in  support  of  the  U.S.  mission,  as  well  as  his loyalty,
work ethic, professionalism, honesty, reliability, and integrity. (AE A, A(1)-A(7))

"Applicant  is  60  years  old.  (GX  2  at  page  5.)  He  avers,  “I  couldn’t  choose  the
country where I was born, my ancestors were exiled to Siberia from Poland and Estonia
where  they  were  fighting  against  the  Russian  Empire  for  freedom  of  their  countries.”
(AppX A at page 1.) Applicant  was previously married to a Russian women in Russia;
but is now married a second time to a native born American, and has two native born
American  children.  (AppX  A  at  page  1.)  In  1976,  he  attended  a  university  in  the  then
Soviet Union. (Id.) However, in 1991, nearly 30 years ago, he fled the Soviet Union, and
“applied  for  Political  Asylum.”  (AppX  A  at  page  2.)  Applicant  has  worked  for  his
employer since February 2016.  (Item 2 at page 12.)
Guideline B – Foreign Influence
1.a.  Applicant  admits  that  his  father,  sister  and  two  children  from  a  previous
marriage  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Russia.  (GX  2  at  pages  27~30,  and  32.)  (His
mother died in 2018.) (GX 3 at page 3.) He last saw his father in 2004, about 16 years
ago.  (AppX  A  at  page  1.)  He  has  little  contact  with  his  sister,  who  works  at  a  beauty
salon (GX 2 at page 32, and GX 3 at page 14); and has not seen his children in “more

1.b.  Applicant  admits  that  he  has  two  friends  who  are  citizens  and  residents  of
Russia.  However,  he  has little  contact  with  them,  one  in  2014,  and  the  other  a former
coworker, in 2016. (GX 2 at pages 39~40.)
1.c.  Applicant  admits  that  he  has  two  “associate(s)”  who  are  citizens  and
residents  of  Russia,  and  who  are  also  employed  by  the  Russian  government.  One
works for the government “as a Deputy Govenor (sic) for National Resources.” (GX 3 at
page 14.) He contacts this Deputy Governor “via Skype approximately 1 time every 1 to
2 years,” the last time being in 2017. (Id.) The other “holds a high position with the IRS
working for the Russian government.” (GX 3 at page 14.) He also contacts this Russian
IRS official “via Skype approximately 1 time every 1 to 2 years,” the last time being in
2015.  (Id.)  These  last  two  associates  clearly  pose  the  potential  for  improper  foreign
influence on Applicant.
Administrative Notice
I  take  administrative  notice  of  the  following  facts  about  Russia:  Russia  uses
cyber operations as an instrument of intelligence collection to inform its decision-making
and  benefit  its  economic  interests.  Russian  intelligence  services  have  conducted
sophisticated and large-scale hacking operations to collect sensitive U.S. business and
technology information. Based on the eight pages summary offered by the Government,
Russia appears to be a significant threat to our national security.

"Applicant is a 53-year-old employee who is seeking to obtain or retain a security
clearance for her job as a software developer with a consulting firm. She has worked for
the firm since 2009. She has a good employment record with the firm as well as highly
favorable letters of recommendation (Exhibits G, H, and L)
Applicant  was  born,  raised,  and  educated  in  China.  She  earned  a  bachelor’s
degree from a Chinese university in 1991. She then immigrated to the United States on
a student visa. She earned a master’s degree from a U.S. state university in 1993. She
has  since  been  continuously  employed  in  the  United  States  while  at  the  same  time
having  lawful  immigration  status.  She  became  a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen  in  2002,  and
she  obtained  a  U.S.  passport.  Upon  becoming  a  U.S.  citizen,  she  swore  an  oath  of
allegiance  to the  United  States, thereby renouncing all allegiance and fidelity to  China
and  any  other  foreign  country.  China  does  not  recognize  dual  nationality,  and  she
automatically  lost,  under  Chinese  law,  Chinese  citizenship  when  she  acquired  U.S.
citizenship.  E.g.  ISCR  Case  No.  18-02960  (May  13,  2019)  at  3  n.  3.  Her  Chinese
passport  had  previously  expired  and  she  destroyed  it  after  obtaining  U.S.  citizenship.
She  has  not  returned  to  China  since  departing  there  in  1991,  because  she  has  “no
interest” in doing so. (Tr. 33-34)
Applicant married in 1992; her spouse was also from China; and they divorced in
2007. She has not remarried. She has two children from the marriage. (Exhibit K) Both
are  native-born  U.S.  citizens.  (Exhibit  C)  Both  are  now college  students,  ages  21  and
18. And both continue to live with her in the same home she has owned since 1999.
The SOR concerns  Applicant’s family  ties to  China via her mother, brother, and
sister-in-law. The relevant details are set forth below.
Applicant’s father is not alleged in the SOR as he passed away in 2017. He had
been  long  retired  from  his  employment  as  an  aerospace  engineer  with  a  research
institution. Before he passed, Applicant typically had weekly contact (once or twice per
week) with her father by telephone calls, video chats, or texting. The last time she saw
her father in-person was in August 1991 when she left China.
Applicant’s mother, age 82, is long retired from her employment as an electrical
engineer with a manufacturing company. Applicant typically had weekly contact (once or
twice  per  week)  with  her  mother  by  telephone  calls,  video  chats,  or  texting.  Applicant
explained  during  the  hearing  that  she  has  reduced  her  contact  with  her  mother  to
monthly  due  to  the  Government’s  concern  about  her  family  ties  to  China.  (Tr.  25-26)
She  does  not  provide  financial  support  to  her  mother,  although  she  understands  her
brother does. The last time she saw her mother in-person was in August 1991 when she
left China.
Applicant’s  brother  is  employed  as  a  civil  engineer  with  a  contracting  and
engineering company. Applicant typically had weekly contact with her brother by phone
calls,  video  chats,  or  texting,  although  such  contact  has  also  been  reduced.  The  last
time  she  saw  her  brother  in-person  was  in  May  2015,  when  he  visited  her  over  a
weekend while in the United States on a business trip.
Applicant’s  sister-in-law  is  not  employed  outside  the  home  and  is  a  full-time
homemaker. Applicant has  the  same level of  contact  with  her sister-in-law as  she  has
with her brother. Applicant has never met her sister-in-law in-person.
Applicant’s  family  in  China  is  unaware  of  the  specifics  of  her  employment,  and
they are unware of any security clearance matters. (Tr. 27)
Applicant’s financial  interests  are  in the United States.  In addition to her annual
salary of about $150,000, she has the following financial assets here: (1) her home with
a market value of about $1.2 million with a mortgage loan balance of about $77,000; (2)
about $300,000 in a brokerage account; and (3) about $200,000 in cash in credit union
accounts. (Exhibits D, E, and F) She has no financial or business interests in China, nor
does she have any financial accounts in China.
Concerning
the  country  of  China,  Department  Counsel’s
for
administrative  notice  contains  an  extensive  discussion  of  the  security  concerns
associated with China. (Exhibit 4) The essential facts about China are the following: (1)
China is an authoritarian state in which the Chinese Communist Party is the paramount
authority; (2) China  (along with Russia) is the most  aggressive collector of  intelligence
(both industrial and military)  related  to  U.S.  information and technology;  and  (3) China
has  a  poor  record  of  human  rights  regarding  respect  for  the  integrity  of  the  person,
respect for civil liberties, respect for political rights, corruption and lack of transparency
in  government,  worker  rights,  as  well  as  discrimination,  societal  abuses,  and  human
trafficking.

Law and Policies
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (E.O.)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of
Defense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review
Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  National  Security
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.
It  is  well-established  law  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.1  As
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan,  “the  clearly  consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side   of   denials.”2  Under  Egan,  Executive  Order  10865,  and  the  Directive,  any  doubt
about  whether  an  applicant  should  be  allowed  access  to  classified  information  will  be
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that
the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3  The Appeal Board has
followed   the   Court’s  reasoning,  and   a   judge’s  findings  of  fact  are   reviewed   under  the
substantial-evidence standard.4
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access  to  classified  information.5  Under  the  Directive,  the  parties  have  the  following
burdens:  (1)  Department  Counsel  has  the  burden  of  presenting  evidence  to  establish
facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for
presenting  evidence  to  refute,  explain,  extenuate,  or  mitigate  facts  that  have  been

Discussion
The  gravamen  of  the  SOR  under  Guideline  B  for  foreign  influence  is  whether
Applicant’s  ties  to  China  should  disqualify  her  from  access  to  classified  information.
Under  Guideline  B  for  foreign  influence,  the  suitability  of  an  applicant  may  be
questioned or put into doubt due to foreign contacts and interests. The overall concern
is set forth in AG ¶ 6 as follows:
Foreign  contacts  and  interests,  including  but  not  limited  to  business,
financial,  and  property  interests,  are  a  national  security  concern  if  they
result in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern
if they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or
induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a
way  inconsistent  with  U.S.  interests  or  otherwise  made  vulnerable  to
pressure  or  coercion  by  any  foreign  interest.  Assessment  of  foreign
contacts  and  interests  should  consider  the  country  in  which  the  foreign
contact  or  interest  is  located,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  considerations
such  as  whether it  is known  to  target  U.S. citizens  to  obtain  classified  or
sensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism.
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise a security concern under
AG ¶ 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:
AG  ¶  7(a)  contact,  regardless  of  method,  with  a  foreign  family  member,
business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen
of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk
of  foreign  exploitation,  inducement,  manipulation,  pressure,  or  coercion;
and
AG ¶ 7(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country
that  create  a  potential  conflict  of  interest  between  the  individual's
obligation  to  protect  classified  or  sensitive  information  or  technology  and
the  individual's  desire  to  help  a  foreign  person,  group,  or  country  by
providing that information or technology.
The  starting  point  for  the  analysis  is  the  country  of  China.  Suffice  it  to  say,  the
U.S.  Government  views  the  behavior  of  the  Chinese  government  as  presenting  a
serious national security concern. The heightened-risk element is easily satisfied. Given
Applicant’s  family  ties  to  China,  the  Government  has  established  its  case  under
Guideline B. The above disqualifying conditions are raised by the evidence.
6 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶ E3.1.14 and E3.1.15.
The guideline provides that certain facts and circumstances may mitigate foreign
influence  concerns.  Given  the  evidence  here,  I  considered  the  following  mitigating
conditions:
AG ¶ 8(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country
in  which  these persons  are located, or the positions or activities  of  those
persons  in  that  country  are  such  that  it  is  unlikely  the  individual  will  be
placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign
individual,  group,  organization,  or  government  and  the  interests  of  the
United States;
there   is  no   conflict  of   interest,  either  because   the   individual’s
AG  ¶ 8(b)
sense  of  loyalty  or  obligation  to  the  foreign  person,  or  allegiance  to  the
group,  government,  or  country  is  so  minimal,  or  the  individual  has  such
deep  and  longstanding  relationships  and  loyalties  in  the  United  States,
that  the  individual  can  be  expected  to  resolve  any  conflict  of  interest  in
favor of the U.S. interest.
China’s  relationship  with  the  United  States  and  the  heightened  risk  it  presents
place  a  heavy  burden  on  Applicant  to  mitigate  the  security  concern.  With  that  said,
Applicant  has  multiple  indicators  of  a  mature,  stable,  responsible,  and  trustworthy
person.  She  was  serious,  candid,  and  credible  at  the  hearing.  She  appears  to  have
cooperated fully and provided truthful information during the security clearance process.
She made a good impression upon me during the hearing.
I have considered the totality  of  Applicant’s ties to  China. Applicant came to the
United States nearly 30 years ago in 1991. She has since established and made her life
here.  After  earning  a  master’s  degree,  she  has  had  a  long  employment  record  in  the
United States. She gave birth to two children in the United States, and her adult children
are  pursing  their  lives  and  educations  in  the  United  States.  Her  financial  assets  (her
estimated  net  worth  is  more  than  $1  million)  are  exclusively  in  the  United  States.
Although  her family  ties  to  China  still  count  and  cannot  be  dismissed  out  of  hand,  the
strength of those ties are diminished due to distance and time (the passage of nearly 30
years  since  she  departed  China  and  has  never  returned).  On  balance,  her  ties  to  the
United States are much stronger than her now distant and largely nominal family ties to
China.
Given  the  totality  of  facts  and  circumstances,  I  conclude  that  it  is  unlikely
Applicant  will be  placed  in a  position of  having to  choose  between the interests of  the
United States and the interests of the Chinese government or her family members who
have  Chinese  citizenship.  I  further  conclude  there  is  no  conflict  of  interest,  because
Applicant has developed such deep and long-standing relationships and loyalties in the
United States that she can be expected to resolve any potential conflict of interest in the
favor of the United States. AG ¶ 8(a) is partially applicable. AG ¶ 8(b) is applicable.
Following  Egan  and  the  clearly  consistent  standard,  I  have  no  doubts  or
concerns  about  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  good   judgment,   and   ability   to
protect  classified  or  sensitive  information.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  I  weighted  the
evidence  as  a  whole  and  considered  if  the  favorable  evidence  outweighed  the
unfavorable  evidence  or  vice  versa.  I  also  considered  the  whole-person  concept.
Accordingly, I conclude that she met her ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified
information.

"Applicant is a 65-year-old director of a defense contractor  who seeks a security
clearance.  The  allegations  covered  in  the  SOR  and  admitted  by  Applicant  are
incorporated and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow.
Background
Applicant is a naturalized U.S. citizen and a dual citizen of Israel who retains his
Israeli  passport  that  was  issued  to  him  in  June  2003  and  was  renewed  in  February
2014.  (Item  3)  His  Israeli  passport  is  not  scheduled  to  expire  before  February  2024.
(Item  4)  Applicant  immigrated  to  the  United  States  in  October  1997  and  became  a
naturalized  U.S.  citizen  in  April  2009.  (Item  3)  He  was  issued  a  U.S.  passport  in  May
2009 and only uses his Israeli passport to gain ingress to Israel and egress to return to
the United States. (Items 3-4) Applicant married in October 1978 and has two children
from this marriage, ages and 34 and 40. (Item 3)
Applicant  attended  a  Russian  university  between  1977  and  1981,  but  did  not
earn a degree before immigrating to Israel in 1981. Between 1982 and 1985, he studied
engineering at an Israeli university, but did not earn a degree. (Item 3) Whether he has
resumed  his  studies  in  Israel  or the  United States  with  the  objective  of  completing his
degree requirements is unclear.
Since  February  2018,  Applicant  has  been  employed  by  his  current  employer.
(Item  3)  Between  February  2017  and  January  2018,  he  was  employed  by  another
defense  contractor  as  a  director  of  electronic  systems  development.  (Items  3-4)  He
reported  unemployment  between  June  2016  and  February  2017.  Between  May  2006
and  May  2016,  Applicant  worked  for  a  non-defense  contractor  as  an  associate  vice
president. (Items 3-4)
Citizenship and residency status of Applicant’s family members
Applicant’s parents are both deceased and were citizens and residents of Russia
before their deaths in 1968 and 1990, respectively. (Item 3) His youngest daughter is a
citizen  of  Israel  who  currently  resides  in  Belgium  where  she  is  employed  by  the
government of Israel in the Israeli Embassy in Brussels, Belgium. (Item 4)
Applicant  maintained weekly contact with his youngest daughter prior to October
2018.  Whether  he  has  since  resumed  his  contacts  with  her  is  unclear.  (Item  4)
Applicant’s oldest daughter is a citizen of Israel who resides in Switzerland. (Item  3) He
maintains weekly contact with her and visits her once or twice a year. (Item 4).
Applicant’s brother  was born  in  Russia  and immigrated to Israel. (Items 3-4) He
maintains monthly contact with his brother and sees  him when he travels to Israel. His
brother retired several years ago.
While his father-in-law is deceased, his mother-in-law is a citizen and resident of
Israel. Applicant maintains quarterly contact with her by telephone. (Item 3)
Applicant  reported many short trips  to and from Israel  between 2009 and 2015.
(Item 3) On these trips, he made contact with his brother and in-laws. (Item 3) Except
for his youngest daughter who works for the Israeli government, none of his immediate
and  extended  family  members  have  any  reported  affiliations  or  ties  to  the  Israeli
government. (Items 3-4)
Country status of Israel
Israel is a  multi-party parliamentary democracy.  See  Request for Administrative
Notice-Israel,  at  2  (April  2019)  and  Israel  and  the  Golan  Heights  2018  Human  Rights
Report,  U.S.  Department  of  State  (March  2019).  Israel  is  a  close  ally  of  the  United
States.  Although  it  has  no  constitution,  Israel’s  unicameral  120-member  Knesset,  has
enacted a series of “Basic Laws” that enumerate fundamental rights. Implementation of
certain fundamental laws, orders, and regulations legally depend on the existence of a
“state of emergency,” which has been in effect since 1948.
Under  the  Basic  Laws,  the  Knesset  has  the  power  to  dissolve  the  government
and  mandate  elections.  The  nationwide  Knesset  elections  in  2015,  which  were
led  by  Prime  Minister
considered  free  and  fair,  resulted  in  a  coalition  government
Benjamin Netanyahu. The Knesset voted on December 26, 2018 to dissolve itself  and
set  April  9,  2019,  as  the  date  for  national  elections.  See  Request  for  Administrative
Notice, Israel, supra.
Terrorism  remains  a  considerable  risk  in  Jerusalem  and  Tel  Aviv,  and  tensions
remain  high.  Throughout  2018,  random  attacks  were  reported,  prompting  the  Israeli
Defense  forces  to  initiate  Operation  Northern  Shield.  See  Request  for  Administrative
Notice,  Israel,  supra;  Israel  2019  Crime  and  Safety  Report,  U.S.  Dept.  of  State  (July
2019  )  Several  designated  foreign  terrorist  organizations  (such  as  Hamas,  Palestinian
Islamic  Jihad,  and  Lebanese  Hisb’allah)  maintain  a  large  presence  in  the  West  bank
and Gaza, and in bordering countries. Violent demonstrations and shootings occur on a
frequent  basis,  and  the  collateral  risks  of  terrorist  attacks  run  high  in  Gaza  (a  region
controlled by Hamas).  See  Request for Administrative  Notice, Israel,  supra; Israel,  the
West  Bank  and  Gaza,  Country  Information,  U.S.  Dept.  of  State  (May  2018).  Human
rights  issues  in  Israel  include  unlawful  or  arbitrary  killings,  restrictions  on  Palestine
residents of Jerusalem, including arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy, family,
and  home;  and  significant  restrictions  on  freedom  of  movement.  See  Request  for
Administrative Notice, Israel, supra.
State  Department  travel  advisories  caution  U.S.  travelers  in  Israel  to  exercise
increased  caution  due  to  terrorism,  civil  unrest,  and  armed  conflict.  See  Request  for
Administrative Notice, supra, at 5; Israel, the West Bank & Gaza, Travel Advisory, U.S.
Dept. of  State (December 2018). Based on State Department travel warnings, terrorist
groups  and  lone-wolf  terrorists  continue  plotting  attacks  in  Israel,  the  West  bank,  and
Gaza.  Often  with  little  warning,  terrorists  may  attack,  targeting  tourist  locations,
transportation  hubs,  markets  and  shopping  malls,  and  local  government  facilities.  (Id.)
Israel has been subjected to numerous attacks from the Palestinians operating from the
Gaza strip.
The United States and Israel participate in joint military planning and training and
have  collaborated  on  military  research  and  weapons  development.  There  have  been
incidents of  illegal export,  actual or attempted,  of  dual-use  technology from  the  United
States to Israel.
The  United  States  has  disagreed  with  Israel  about  its  sale  of  U.S.  and  Israeli
technologies  to  other  countries,  such  as  China  and  Russia.  See  Request  for
Administrative  Notice-Israel.  supra,  at  2;  Summary  of  Major  U.S.  Export  Enforcement

child. (Transcript (Tr.) at 18-19, 22; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1; AE A, B)
Applicant was born in India to Indian parents. His father is deceased. His mother
and three of his siblings immigrated to the United States before Applicant. He followed
them to the United States in 1997, and he became a U.S. citizen in 2003. India does not
permit dual citizenship, and he renounced his Indian citizenship when he became a U.S.
citizen. His wife is originally from India. She is now a U.S. citizen. Their child was born
in the United States. (Tr. at 17-18, 22, 36, 49-50, 56; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE

nieces and nephews who are citizens and residents of the United States, including two
children of one of his sisters in India. His wife’s brother and his family live in the United
States.  Applicant  has  had  little  to  no  contact  with  his  brother  in  India  in  the  last  ten
years.  Applicant  and  his  wife  maintain  contact  with  their  other  family  in  India  through
electronic media and visits. To the best of his knowledge, none of his immediate family
members  have  any  current  direct  connection  to  the  Indian  government.  (Tr.  at  20-21,

Applicant  and  his  wife,  separately  or  jointly,  owned  several  properties  in  India,
with an estimated total value of about $232,000. They have since divested themselves
of  the  properties.  They  have  substantial  assets  in  the  United  States,  including  their
home,  which  they  own  without  a  mortgage,  and  three  investment  properties.  He
estimated their net worth to be between $1.2 and $1.5 million. (Tr. at 23-26, 39-40, 48-

Applicant  has  no  plan  to  move  back  to  India.  His  family  has  enjoyed  great
success  in  the  United  States.  It  includes  doctors,  lawyers,  and  engineers,  with
graduates from some of the most prestigious universities in the United States. His child
is in a medical program at a top university. Applicant expressed his undivided allegiance
to the United States, which he considers his home. He credibly testified that his family in
India could not be used to coerce or intimidate him into revealing classified information,
and that he would report any attempt to do so. (Tr. at 19-20, 32-34, 52-53; Applicant’s

"In the SOR, the Government alleged that Applicant’s father is a citizen and resident
of China who works there as a police officer (SOR 1.a), and that his step-mother (SOR
1.b) and half-sister (SOR 1.c) are citizens and residents of China. It was also alleged that
Applicant maintains contact with his cousin, who is a citizen and resident of China and
served in the Chinese military (SOR 1.d). Finally, it was alleged that Applicant maintains
contact with an uncle and two aunts, one of whom works for the Chinese government,
who are citizens and residents of China (SOR 1.e).
In  response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  without  explanation  all  of  the  SOR
allegations.  In  addition  to  the  facts  established  by  Applicant’s  admissions,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  24  years  old  and  employed  as  an  engineer  for  a  large  defense
contractor. He was born in China, immigrated to the United States in 2008, and became
a U.S. citizen in 2014. His parents, both native-born Chinese citizens, divorced in 2007.
His  mother  subsequently  married  an  American,  now  Applicant’s  stepfather,  whom  she
met when he was on vacation in China. Applicant and his mother subsequently moved to
the  United  States  where  Applicant  completed  his  middle  and  high  school  education.
Applicant went on to earn an associate’s degree at a community college. Thereafter, he
enrolled in a state university where he earned a bachelor’s degree with two engineering
majors in 2017. In 2019, he earned a master’s degree in engineering. He began working
for  his  current  employer  during  his  last  semester  in  college  as  an  engineering  intern,
before being hired in May 2017 as a full-time employee. (GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 14, 32 – 33)
Applicant is single and lives with other single professionals his age. He owns a 14-
year-old used car and earns about $70,000 annually. He has about $22,000 saved in a
retirement savings account.  He  has no assets  or  other  interests  in  China  or  any other
foreign  country.  His  father  in  China  helped  pay  for  about  30  percent  of  Applicant’s
education. The rest was funded by his mother and American stepfather. (GX 1; GX 2; Tr.
32 – 34, 48 – 50)
Applicant’s  father  has  lived  in  China  his  entire  life.  He  served  in  the  Chinese
People’s Liberation Army (PLA) for about 15 years before transitioning to his current job
as  a  civilian  police  officer  in  one  of  China’s  southern  provinces.  He  has  worked  as  a
policeman since about 2007. Applicant’s father has remarried and now has an 11-year-
old  daughter  (Applicant’s  half-sister).  Applicant’s  Chinese  stepmother  owns  a  private
company that manufactures batteries for electric cars. (GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 32, 37, 56 – 57)
Applicant maintains close and continuing contact with his father in China. Most of
their  communication  takes  place  weekly  via  text.  He  last  visited  his  father  for  about  a
month in December 2016 and January 2017. Before then, he visited his father and other
family members in China for about six weeks in May and June 2015. He hopes to visit his
father  in  the  future,  but  he understands  that  if  he holds  a  clearance  such travel  would
raise additional security concerns. (GX 1; Tr. 41 – 46, 59 – 60)
Applicant  also  maintains  regular  contact  with  two  aunts  and  one  uncle  who  are
Chinese citizens and reside in China. One of his aunts (his mother’s sister) works for the
Chinese  government’s  provincial  agricultural  commission.  Applicant  speaks  or
electronically messages with her about four times annually. Applicant also stays in regular
contact a cousin, the son of the aforementioned maternal aunt, whom Applicant regards
as a brother because they are about the same age. He and his cousin communicate by
text  about  once  each  month.  His  cousin  served  in  the  PLA  as  part  of  a  two-year
compulsory service obligation. While in the Chinese military, Applicant’s cousin served in
a forestry division. He now works at the factory owned by Applicant’s stepmother. (GX 1;
Tr. 37 – 39)
Applicant’s other aunt, his father’s sister, and his uncle (by marriage to this aunt)
work  for  the  Chinese  government’s  forestry  and  water  commission.  Applicant  has
electronic contact with them about four times annually. Applicant last saw his aunts, his
uncle, and his cousin, as well as other family members with whom he has no contact,
when he visited his father in early 2017. His last contact with any family member other
than his father was in mid-2019. He last spoke with his father in late January 2020. (GX
1; Tr. 39 – 41)
To properly assess the security significance of these facts within the adjudicative
guideline  at  issue,  I  have  taken  administrative  notice  of  certain  facts  regarding  China.
China is an increasingly industrialized world economic and military power. The country
has a population in excess of one billion people who are governed by an authoritarian,
Communist regime. Geographically vast and demographically diverse, the country has
significant natural resources to help support its growing economy. China devotes most of
its industry and domestic production to its military forces, and it has a strategic nuclear
arsenal.  China  is  in  direct  competition  with  the  United  States  in  many  geopolitical  and
economic  areas,  and  it  is  known  to  actively  collect  military,  economic  and  industrial
information about the United States. In addition to being the leading threat to the security
of U.S. technology, China of late has emerged as a persistent cyber espionage threat to
U.S. military and critical infrastructure systems. Much of that activity is conducted through
the auspices of the PLA. (Hx. 3, Items I - V)
China  and  the  U.S.  also  are  major  trading  partners  and  share  other  common
interests.  For  example,  the  two  countries  have  worked  closely  on  regional  issues,
especially  those  involving  North  Korea.  However,  China  is  one  of  the  most  active
collectors of U.S. defense information and technology, as evidenced by multiple federal
prosecutions  of  U.S.  citizens  attempting  to  act  illegally  on  behalf  of  the  Chinese
government  in  the  United  States.  Further,  the  Chinese  government  has  an  abysmal
human  rights  record.  Officials  continue  to  engage  in  suppression  of  personal  and
electronic  expressions  of  political  dissent.  Arbitrary  arrest  and  detention,  forced
confessions,  torture,  and  other  prisoner  mistreatment  are  commonplace.  Government
and law enforcement practices are largely unchecked by any independent judicial review.
Most recently, the central Chines government has begun to exert a repressive influence
in Hong Kong, a historically open society. (Hx. 3, Item I, VII)
Applicant is loyal to the United States and unequivocally favors western democratic
government,  with  its  system  of  individual  liberties  and  freedom  of  speech,  over  the
repressive, authoritarian regime in China. He testified that if any of his family members
were ever put under duress to leverage Applicant’s access to classified information, he
would contact his employer’s security organization. Applicant also presented information
showing that his life is one of total immersion in personal and professional interests in
United States. Applicant was a good student of whom his father, mother, and stepmother
are  rightfully  proud.  He  is  assumed  to  be  a  good  employee,  and  he  has  a  variety  of
personal interests that are typical of any American citizen his age. (AX A; AX B; Tr. 58 –

incorporated and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow.
Background
Applicant  immigrated  to  the  United  States  in  November  2007  and  became  a
naturalized U.S. citizen in January 2018. (GE 1; Tr. 20, 35)  He married in September
2009 and has one child (age seven and a U.S. citizen by birth) from this marriage. (GE

U.S. citizen in 2018 (GE 1; Tr. 20, 35-36, 70-71) Both Applicant and his wife hold U.S.
passports.  (AEs  G  and  J)  Applicant’s  wife  (formerly  a  school  teacher)  is  currently  a
homemaker  who  takes  care  of  their  young  son.  (Tr.  37)  When  they  acquired  U.S.
citizenship, respectively, they renounced their South Korean citizenship. (Tr. 20-21, 26)
Applicant  completed  his  formal  education  in  South  Korea  and  has  not  pursued
any higher education credits since his immigration to the United States. (GE 1 and AE
B) Between 2014 and 2020, he earned certificates from his employers documenting his
demonstrated  knowledge  and  proficiency  in  routing  switching,  security,  networks,  and
solutions as a network engineer. (AE B)
Applicant has no U.S. military service, but reported two years of required military
service in South Korea, between April 1994 and October 1996. (GE 1; Tr. 34) Applicant
was  discharged  from  his  South  Korea  military  obligations  upon  completion  of  his
mandatory two years of service. (GE 1)
Since  January  2020,  Applicant  has  been  employed  by  his  current  defense
contractor.  (GE  1;  Tr.  40-42)  Between  November  2007  and  October  2017,  he  was
employed  by  other  defense  and  non-defense  employers  in  various  capacities.  (GE  1)
He is licensed to drive a motor vehicle in his U.S. state of residence. (AE H) Applicant
has never held either a U.S. issued security clearance or a public trust position. (Tr. 22,

Both Applicant and his wife are registered to vote in U.S. elections. (AE L) Since
immigrating  to  the  United  States,  neither  Applicant  nor  his  wife  have  voted  in  any
foreign elections. (Tr. 26)
Family connections with South Korea
Applicant’s  mother  recently  passed  away.  (Tr.  23)  His  father  is  a  citizen  and
resident  of  South  Korea.  (GE  1)  Applicant  has  a  brother  and  four  sisters  who  are
citizens and residents of South Korea. (GE 1; Tr. 23-24) While his father-in-law passed
away some time ago, his mother-in-law is a citizen and resident of South Korea. (GE 1;
Tr. 24-25)
Applicant maintains annual contact by telephone with his father and last saw his
father  in  2013  during  Applicant’s  last  trip  to  South  Korea.  (Tr.  24)  Applicant  maintains
annual contact with his brother and less frequent contact with his older sisters. (Tr. 24,
66)  As  with  his  father,  he  last  saw  his  brother  and  sisters  in  2013  on  his  last  trip  to
South Korea. (Tr. 24, 56-57, 66). None of his family members have ever visited him in
the  United  States.  (Tr.  51-52,  57-58)  Applicant  maintains  even  less  frequent  contact
with his mother-in-law and last talked with her by telephone over two years ago. (Tr. 58-

While  Applicant  listed  several  friends  and  acquaintances  in  his  electronic
questionnaires for investigations processing (e-QIP) who are South Korean citizens and
residents, he has not spoken to any of these listed persons in several years and does
not consider them to be close to him in any way. (Tr.   59-60) He has not seen any of
these former acquaintances since he immigrated to the United States in 2007. (Tr. 60-
61)
None of Applicant’s family members in South Korea have any known knowledge
of what kind of work he does. (Tr. 23-24, 64-65, 68) And, none of his family members
and acquaintances residing in South Korea have any reported associations or ties to the
South Korea government or military. (GE 1; Tr. 64-65)
Financial assets
Applicant  and  his  wife  have  no  property  or  financial  interests  (inclusive  of  bank
accounts) of their own in South Korea. (Tr. 26) By contrast, they own some real estate
in  the  United  States  (AE  C)  and  maintain  residential  leases  in  their  U.S.  state  of
residence. (GEs C and D; Tr. 28) They also maintain their checking accounts with U.S.
banking  institutions  in  their  U.S.  state  of  residence.  (AEs  E-F)  These  documented
accounts  reveal  that  they  have  $24,000  in  one  account  and  $33,000  in  the  other
account.  (AEs  E-F)  This  year  Applicant  opened  a  401(k)  retirement  account  in  a  U.S.
financial institution and currently has close to $5,000 in the account. (Tr. 68)
Applicant  neither  provides  nor  receives  any  financial  support  from  his  father,
siblings,  or  mother-in-law  residing  in  South  Korea  and  does  not  have  any  personal
financial dealings with them. Asked whether he intends to return to South Korea in the
foreseeable future, Applicant confirmed he has no current intention to return to his birth
country. (Tr. 32, 64)
Country status of South Korea
South  Korea  (officially  the  Republic  of  Korea)  is  a  self-governing  state  with  a
population of over 46 million people. See Background Note: Korea, supra. Its religions
are  comprised  of  Christianity  (today  one  of  South  Korea’s  largest  religions),  Buddism,
Shamanism,  Confucianism,  and  Chandogyo.  (id.)  Since  its  liberation  in  August  1945,
South Korea is described as a republic with powers shared between the president and
the legislature, which consists of a unicameral national assembly (id., at 2) Its judiciary
consists of a Supreme Court, appellate courts, and a Constitutional court.
The  origins  of  Korea’s  people  are  somewhat  obscure.  See  Background  Note:
Korea, supra. Korea was first populated by peoples who migrated to the peninsula from
the northwestern regions of Asia.  An independent kingdom for much of its long history,
Korea  was  occupied  by  Japan  beginning  in  1905  following  the  Russo-Japanese  War.
See  Background  Note:  Korea,  supra  and  The  World  Factbook:  South  Korea,  the  U.S.
Intelligence Agency (May 2020).
Following the end  of Japanese colonial  administration  in  1945, migration trends
from  the  South  to  the  North  reversed  and  more  Koreans  returned  to  the  South  from
Japan and Manchuria. (id.) This reverse migration continued after the Republic of Korea
was  established  in  1948  and  during  the  Korean  War  (1950-1953).  See  Background
Note,  Korea,  supra,  at  8-10,  and  The  World  Factbook:  South  Korea,  supra.  A  1953
armistice split the Peninsula along a demilitarized zone at about the 38th parallel. Under
Park Chung-hee’s leadership of South Korea (1961-1979), South Korea achieved rapid
economic  growth,  with  per  capita  income  in  the  country  rising  to  roughly  17  times  the
level of North Korea in 1979. See id.
In  August  1991,  South  Korea  joined  the  United  Nations  (UN),  along  with  North
Korea,  and  has  been  an  active  participant  in  most  UN  specialized  agencies  and
numerous  international  fora.  See  Background  Note:  Korea,  supra,  at  10.  South  Korea
maintains diplomatic relations with more than 170 countries and has a broad network of
trading  relationships  throughout  the  world.  Since  normalizing  relations  with  Japan  in
1965, the two countries have built a strong bilateral relationship centering on principles
of  mutually  beneficial  economic  activities.  Divergent  positions  on  the  process  of
relinquishing North Korea’s weapons system and South Korea’s more turbulent politics
continue to undermine interstate relations between South and North Korea.
U.S.–South Korean Relations
The United States and Korea’s Joseon Dynasty established diplomatic relations
under the 1882 Treaty of Peace, Amity, Commerce, and Navigation, and the first U.S.
diplomatic  envoy  arrived  in  Korea  in  1883.  See  U.S.  Relations  with  the  Republic  of
South  Korea,  Bilateral  Relations  Fact  Sheet,  supra.  Since  their  first  establishing
diplomatic  relations,  the  United  States  and  South  Korea  have  maintained  a  long  and
enduring  history  of  friendship  and  cooperation  based  on  shared  values  and  interests.
(id.,  at  2-3)  Working  together,  the  two  countries  are  committed  to  combating  regional
and  global  threats  and  strengthening  their  economies.  (id.)  For  its  part,  the  United
States has maintained Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine personnel in South Korea in
fulfillment  of  its  commitments  under  the  U.S.-Korea  Mutual  Defense  Treaty  to  help
South Korea defend itself against external aggression.
Today,  the  United  States  provides  no  development  assistance  to  South  Korea.
See  U.S.  Relations  with  the  Republic  of  South  Korea,  Bilateral  Relations  Fact  Sheet,
supra.  While  a  recipient  of  U.S.  assistance  in  the  years  after  the  Korean  War,  South
Korea  is  now  a  development  aid  donor.  Over  the  past  several  decades,  South  Korea
has achieved a notably high level of economic growth and is currently the United States’
sixth largest trading partner with a trillion dollar economy. (id., at 4-5) Bilateral relations
between  the  United  States  and  South  Korea  are  marked  by  large-scale  flows  of
manufactured goods, agricultural products, services, and technology.
South Korea’s direct foreign investment in the United States has nearly doubled
since 2011 from $19.7 billion to $38.8 billion in 2016. (id.) This makes South Korea the
second  largest  Asian  source  of  foreign  direct  investment  into  the  United  States.  The
Korean-United  States  trade  agreement  entered  into  force  in  March  2012  only
underscores the depth of South Korea’s trade ties with the United States. (id.) Notably,
the  United  States  and  South  Korea  reached  an  agreement  in  August  2018  on
renegotiation of their 2012 trade agreement.
Reinforcing their strong bilateral relations with each other, the United States and
South  Korea  belong  to  a  number  of  the  same  international  organizations.  See  U.S.
Relations  with  the  Republic  of  South  Korea,  Bilateral  Relations  Fact  Sheet,  supra.
Common  memberships  include  the  UN,  G-20,  Organization  of  Economic  Cooperation
and development, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum, Association of Southeast
Asian  Nations  (ASEAN),  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF),  the  World  Bank,  and
the World trade Organization (WTO)
South Korean government espionage activities
Despite South Korea’s long history of democratic governance and strong bilateral
relations  with  the  United  States,  South  Korea  has  been  involved  in  government
espionage and collection activities against the United States that have resulted in U.S.
criminal proceedings See Administrative Notice, South Korea, supra, at 2-5.
The  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  has  highlighted  numerous  instances  of  South
Korean  persons  and  corporations  securing  proprietary  and/or  export-controlled
information  in  contravention  of  U.S.  law.  Examples  include  South  Korean  citizens
charged  with  illegal  exportation  of  military-grade  accelerometers  to  Iran;  illegal
exportation of carbon fiber and other materials to Iran and China via South Korea; illegal
exportation of infrared military technology to South Korea; illegal exportation of technical
data to South Korea; and illegal exportation of rocket propulsion systems, engines, and
technology to South Korea. See Request for Administrative Notice, South Korea, supra;
Summary  of  Major  U.S.  Export  Enforcement,  Economic  Espionage,  Trade  Secret  and
Embargo-Related  Criminal  Cases  (January  2015  to  the  Present),  U.S.  Department  of
Justice (January 2018)
Globally, South Korea remains one of seven countries most actively engaged in
foreign collection and industrial espionage against the United States. The United States
restricts  the  export  of  sensitive,  dual-use  technologies  that  can  have  civilian  uses,  but
also can be used for military purposes or to build weapons of mass destruction. Reports
document  that  South  Korea  has  been  the  unauthorized  recipient  of  technology
controlled under the U.S. control laws, including material that could be used in missile
delivery/reentry  systems,  encryption,  software,  military  truck  parts,  and  night  vision
cameras. See  Request  Administrative Notice,  South  Korea,  supra.;  Summary  of Major
U.S.  Export  Enforcement,  Economic  Espionage,  Trade  Secret  and  Embargo-Related
Criminal Cases, supra.
South Korea’s human rights record
Human  rights  are  generally  respected  by  the  South  Korean  government.  See
Republic of Korea 2019 Human Rights Report, U.S. Department of State (March 2020).
Although,  there  have  been  reports  of  human  rights  problems.  Identified  problems
include  societal  discrimination  against  women,  persons  with  disabilities  and  minorities,
domestic violence and rape, and corruption. (id.) Overall, though, South Korea’s human
rights record is compatible with generally accepted international norms of state respect
for human rights.

"Applicant admitted each of the SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated
in  my  findings  of  fact.  Applicant,  age  51,  has  been  married  since  1997.  He  has  two
children, ages 16 and 20. He earned a bachelor’s degree (in 1991) and master’s degree
(in  1993)  in  Taiwan.  He  earned  a  second  master’s  degree  (in  2000)  in  the  United
States.  He  has  been  employed  as  a  software  engineer  by  two  employers  since  he
arrived  in  the  United  States  –  the  first  from  1999  through  2016;  and  the  second,  a
defense  contractor,  since  2016.  This  is  his  first  application  for  a  security  clearance.
(Items 1, 3)
Applicant  and  his  wife  are  Taiwanese  citizens  by  birth.  Applicant  entered  the
United  States  in  1997.  His  first  U.S.  employer  sponsored  his  green  card.  At  their  first
opportunity, he and his wife became naturalized U.S. citizens in 2010. Their children are
U.S. citizens by birth. His wife earned her bachelor’s and master’s degrees in the United
States. She works for a U.S. private-sector employer. (Items 1, 3)
Applicant’s  mother  and  father  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Taiwan.  His  mother,
age 75, is a homemaker. His father, age 86, retired from the Taiwanese Navy in 1986
as  instructor  at  the  military  service  school.  Applicant  visits  his  parents  in  Taiwan  once
per  year.  He  communicates  with  his  father  by  phone  once  per  month,  and  with  his
mother by phone once every week. (Items 1, 3, 4)
Applicant’s two brothers are citizens and residents of Taiwan. Brother 1, age 49,
retired from the Taiwanese Army  in 2012  as an aircraft mechanic. From 2013 through
2016,  he  attended  and  then  graduated  from  a  theological  seminary.  He  has  been
employed as a pastor by a community church since 2017. Brother 1 is married with two
school-aged children. Brother 1’s spouse is a homemaker and part-time piano teacher.
Applicant  visits  Brother  1  in  Taiwan  once  per  year,  and  communicates  with  him  by
phone or email two times per year. (Items 1, 3, 4)
Brother  2,  age  47,  is  employed  as  an  engineer  by  a  private-sector  electronics
company.  His  company,  an  original  design  manufacturer  with  64,000  employers,
produces  computers,  computer-related  equipment,  and  televisions  for  a  variety  of
clients around the world. Brother 2 is married with two school-aged children. Brother 2’s
spouse  is  a  homemaker  and  an  elementary-school  substitute  teacher.  Applicant  visits
Brother 2 in Taiwan once per year, and communicates with him by phone or email once
every two to three months. (Items 1, 3, 4)
Applicant’s mother-in-law (MIL), age 73, is a homemaker. He visits her in Taiwan
once  every  one  to  two  years.  He  communicates  with  her  by  phone  once  every  three
months. His father-in-law is deceased. (Items 1, 3, 4)
Applicant  has  traveled  to  Taiwan  every  year  since  1997,  except  for  2002  and
2009, to visit the family members described above. During his trips to Taiwan, Applicant
is  accompanied  by  his  wife  and  children  and  they  stay  with  Applicant’s  parents.  They
have  never  experienced  any  security-significant  issues  while  in  Taiwan.  (Item  1  at  12;
Item 3 at 10-12, 39-50; Item 4 at 2, 4)
Applicant  has  owned  his  home  in  the  United  States  since  2002.  His  wife
maintains a bank account with a balance of $600 or less in Taiwan that is only used for
convenience during trips to Taiwan. His wife co-owns, with her mother and brother,1 two
properties  in  Taiwan  that  they  inherited  from  his  wife’s  father.  His  wife’s  one-third
interest  in  those  properties  totals  $33,000.  The  value  of  his  wife’s  bank  account  and
property interests in Taiwan represent less than 2.5 percent of their family’s overall net
worth  and  is  not  important  to  their  overall  financial  situation.  The  value  of  the  assets
they  own  in  the  United  States  totals  approximately  1.4  million  dollars,  including  their
home  (the  mortgage  on  which  has  been  paid  off),  education  and  retirement  savings,
personal property, and regular savings. (Item 1 at 11; Item 3 at 33-37; Item 4 at 5)
Although  Applicant  has  never  had  access  to  classified  information,  both  of  his
U.S.  employers  have entrusted  him  with  sensitive  proprietary  information. He  received
trainings on information, personnel, and physical security procedures from his first U.S.
employer. As a defense contractor, he has received basic security indoctrination training
and annual online training regarding the safeguarding of sensitive material, protection of
personal  information  on  social  media,  export  controls,  and  handling/reporting  of
suspicious  contacts.  He  is  “very  security  conscious  at  work”  and  has  “never  been
involved  in  a  security  violation.”  If  he  is  ever  approached  by  anyone  and  asked  to
provide  information  concerning  his  work,  classified  or  not,  to  any  foreign  country  or
entity,  he  will  decline  immediately  and  notify  the  FBI.  He  will  immediately  report  any
suspicious contact, including those with Taiwanese nationals, to his employer’s security
representative. He keeps the contact information for the FBI and his employer’s security
office in his mobile phone so that he will have it with him  at all times. To-date, he has
never been involved in any conduct or situation that needed to be reported. (Item 1 at

Applicant  and  his  wife  chose  to  remain  and  raise  their  children  in  the  United
States  because  they  “recognized  and  agreed  with  the  freedom,  quality,  politics,  and
many other aspects of life in the [United States].” They value the “career opportunities,
work  environment,  education  system,  and  healthy  living  environment  available  [in  the
United States].” Applicant’s experience living in and visiting Taiwan has made him more

enjoy in the United States. The United States has been his home for 22 years, which is
most of his adult life, and is the only country to which Applicant feels loyalty, allegiance,
and attachment. (Item 11, 13)
With  respect  to  the  potential  conflict  of  interest  his  Taiwanese  family  poses,
Applicant stated:
I  would  never  do  anything  for  the  benefit  of  another  country  that  might
work to the disadvantage of the [United States]. I would never do anything
that  might  be  detrimental  to  the  national  security  interests  of  the  [United
States].  I  am  willing  to  support  the  defense  of  the  United  States  against
other  country[sic],  including  Taiwan  should  the  relationship  between  the
[United States] become adversarial. . . .
I  feel  familial  affection  and  obligation  to  my  relatives  in  Taiwan,  but  my
desire  and  obligation  to  maintain  the  security  of  the  United  States
supersedes  my  obligation  to  my  relatives  in  Taiwan.  I  can  say  without
equivocation that I feel no divided loyalty or allegiance between the United
States  and  Taiwan.  The  only  country  to  which  I  feel  national  allegiance
and  loyal[sic]  is  the  United  States  of  America.  .  .  .  I  could  never  be
influenced  to  do  anything  detrimental  to  the  interests  of  the  [United
States], even under threat of harm to my relatives in Taiwan. If I were ever
asked  to  choose  between  the  security  interests  of  the  United  States  and
the safety, security, and wellbeing of my relatives in Taiwan, I would chose
the security interest of the United States without hesitation. . . . (Item 1 at
9, 12)
Friends  and  colleagues  who  know  Applicant  well  commended  his  character,
judgment,  and  work  ethic.  They  also  praised  his  patriotism  and  loyalty  towards  the
United States. Applicant is active in his church and community. His supervisors lauded
his work performance. (AE A through H)
Administrative Notice
The United States recognizes the Government of the People's Republic of China
as the sole legal government of China, acknowledging the Chinese position that there is
but one China and Taiwan is part of China. In 2019, China made clear its increasingly
uncompromising  stance  towards  Taiwan’s  independent  status  and  sense  of  urgency
regarding unification.
The United States does not support Taiwan independence. However, the United
States and Taiwan enjoy a robust unofficial relationship. The 1979 Taiwan Relations Act
provides  the  legal  basis  for  this  relationship  and  enshrines  the  United  States’
commitment to assist Taiwan in maintaining its defensive capability. In 2019, the United
States  took  significant  steps  to  demonstrate  support  for  and  expand  cooperation  with
Taiwan in the areas of defense and security.
China  poses  a  serious  threat  to  the  national  security  of  the  United  States.  It
remains  the  most  active  strategic  competitor  responsible  for  cyber  espionage  against
the  U.S.  Government.  China’s  pursuit  of  intellectual  property,  sensitive  research  and
development  plans,  and  U.S.  person  data  remains  a  significant  threat  to  the  U.S.
Government.  Taiwan  has  been  an  active  collector  of  U.S.  economic  technologies  that
have  sensitive  military  applications.  Numerous  cases  have  arisen  involving  the  illegal
export or attempted export of sensitive, dual-use technology to Taiwan.

"Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations.  Under  Guideline  B,  the  SOR
alleged that: his mother, two brothers, and four sisters are citizens and residents of Iraq
(SOR  ¶¶  1.a-c);  and  that  one  brother  works  for  the  Iraqi  government  in  an  important
position of trust (SOR ¶ 1.d). Under Guideline C, the SOR alleged that Applicant applied
for employment with the city of Baghdad in 2016, worked there for about six months and
went  on  extended  leave  in  July  2017.  He  has  the  ability  to  return  to  work  at  any  time
(SOR  ¶  2.a).  Applicant  anticipates  receiving  a  pension  from  the  government  of  Iraq
starting at age 50 (SOR ¶ 2.b).
Applicant’s  SOR  admissions  are  incorporated  herein  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a
thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant, his parents and siblings were born and raised in Iraq. He is 50 years
old. He claimed that in the 1990s, he and a brother protested against the government of
Saddam  Hussein.  In  1995,  they  both  left  Iraq  for  Lebanon,  afraid  for  their  lives,  and
received  refugee  status.  He  resided  in  Lebanon  until  he  entered  the  United  States  in
2000. Applicant married his wife, a U.S. citizen, in 2003, and they have three children,
ages  16,  14,  and  12.  He  became  a  U.S.  citizen  in  2008.  Applicant  stated  that  he
renounced his Iraqi citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen.
Since  leaving  Iraq,  Applicant  has  maintained  close  contact  with  his  family
members,  most  of  whom  are  residents  and  citizens  of  Iraq.  He  has  weekly  telephone
contact with his 73-year-old mother. His most recent in-person contact with his mother,
siblings, and friends in Iraq was in 2017.
Applicant has four brothers born and raised in Iraq, ages 59, 53, 43, and 40, and
four sisters, ages 51, 47 (2), and 41. The brothers, ages 59 and 40, and all four sisters
are Iraqi resident-citizens. The 53-year-old brother immigrated to the United States and
is a naturalized U.S. citizen. The 43-year-old brother is a citizen of Iraq, but residing in a
foreign  country  because  of  his  important  position  of  trust  for  the  Iraqi  government.
Applicant has weekly or monthly telephone contact with his brothers and sisters.
Applicant has in-person contact with his siblings, extended family members, and
friends whenever he visits Iraq. Applicant has traveled to Iraq frequently, specifically as
follows:  November  2009  –  March  2010;  March  2013  –  April  2013;  August  2014  –
October 2014; June 2015 – July 2015; May 2016 – June 2016; and November 2016 –
July  2017.  In  addition  to  his  contacts  with  family  members,  Applicant  communicates
quarterly  with  a  brother-in-law  who  is  a  member  of  an  Iraqi  government  commission,
and two to three times a year with a high school classmate. Two of Applicant’s sisters
are teachers working for the Iraqi government.
During his trip to Iraq in November 2016, Applicant applied for a job with the city
of Baghdad. Applicant used an Iraqi identification card that he renewed in 2008-2009 to
apply for his Iraqi job. He explained that he renewed his Iraqi identification card because
travelling within Iraq using U.S. identification documents is dangerous. After working for
the  city  of  Baghdad  for  about  six  months,  Applicant  went  on  extended  leave  in  July
2017. He is able to return to his job at any time.  Applicant took the job with the city of
Baghdad to earn benefits under an Iraqi government program that allows prior refugees
to receive a retirement of about $325 monthly starting at age 50.
Applicant  initially  failed  to  disclose  in  his  SCA  and  to  government  investigators
during an  interview  that  he had  an Iraqi  identification  card  that  he  renewed  it  in  2008-
2009.  He  also  failed  to  disclose  his  use  of  the  Iraqi  identification  card  to  travel  within
Iraq,  or  about  him  using  it  to  obtain  employment  from  the  city  of  Baghdad.  Applicant
omitted during a counterintelligence interview that he was hired by the city of Baghdad,
and he claimed that he traveled to Iraq three times between November 2016 and July
2017, when in fact he was working in Baghdad during the whole period.
Between  2006  and  about  2015,  Applicant  conducted  business  in  Iraq  by
purchasing  vehicles  in  the  United  States  and  shipping  them  to  Iraqi  customers  for  a
profit.  His  sibling  in  the  United  States  and  those  residing  in  Iraq  assisted  him  with  the
business transactions.
Concerning  Iraq,  I  took  administrative  notice  that  the  U.S.  Department  of  State
warns  that  travel  within  Iraq  remains  very  dangerous  and  the  ability  of  the  U.S.
Embassy to assist U.S. citizens is extremely limited. U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high risk
for kidnapping and terrorist violence. Numerous terrorist and insurgent groups are active
in  Iraq,  including  ISIS.  Such  groups  regularly  attack  Iraqi  security  forces  and  civilians.
Anti-U.S.  sectarian  militias  and  criminal  elements  may  also  threaten  U.S.  citizens  and
western companies throughout Iraq.
Severe  human  rights  problems  are  widespread  in  Iraq.  Sectarian  hostility,
widespread corruption, and lack of transparency at all levels of government and society
weakened the government’s authority and worsened effective human rights protections.
Problems include harsh and life-threatening conditions in detention and prison facilities;
arbitrary  arrests  and  lengthy  pretrial  detention;  limits  on  freedom  of  expression  to
include press, social, religious and political restrictions in academic and cultural matters;
discrimination  against  and  societal  abuse  of  women  and  ethnic,  religious,  and  racial
minorities; seizure of property without due process and limitations of worker rights.

remaining  family  now  lives  in  the  United  States.  His  brother  retired  from  the  Pakistani
Army as an officer in 2017. Applicant has not seen this brother since he returned to the
United States in January 2018. His only contact with this brother since then is through
social media.  (Item 2; Item 4; Applicant Exhibit A.)
1.b.  The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant’s  son  resided  in  Saudi  Arabia.  Applicant
stated  that  his  son  returned  to  the  United  States  in  2017.  The  Government  conceded
that  this  allegation  has  been  mitigated.  Accordingly,  it  is  found  for  Applicant.  (Item  2;
FORM at footnote 1.)
1.c.  The  Government  alleged  that  Applicant  maintained  close  and  continuing
contact  with  various  friends  and  family  members  in  Pakistan.  In  this  regard  Applicant
stated,  “Since  2018,  there  is  ONLY  minimal/infrequent  contacts  with  friends  and
relatives in Pakistan using social media (WhatsApp) for personal greetings.” (Applicant
Exhibit A at 1-2.)
The  following  three  allegations,  1.d,  1.e,  and  1.f,  concern  Applicant’s  financial
connections in Pakistan. For ease of discussion they will be addressed together. At the
time the SOR was issued in February 2020, Applicant had cash and property assets in
Pakistan worth between $140,000 and $160,000. This included $22,000 in several bank
accounts;  an  apartment  owned  by  Applicant’s  wife  worth  approximately  $70,000;  and
property  that  was  alleged  to  be  worth  $111,000,  but  due  to  currency  deflation  in
Pakistan had been reduced to approximately $70,000. (Item 5.)
Applicant  submitted  documentation  from  his  bank  in  the  United  States  showing
that  approximately  $100,000  had  been  remitted  from  his  Pakistani  bank.  Applicant
stated that only approximately $20,000 remained in Pakistan as of June 29, 2020, and
that  amount  was  in  the  process  of  being  transferred.  (Applicant  Exhibit  A.)  Item  5
indicated  that  Applicant  had  approximately  $601,000  worth  of  assets  in  the  United
States, before transfer of the funds from Pakistan.
Pakistan
I  take  administrative  notice  of  the  facts  set  forth  in  Item  6.  Pakistan  is  a
parliamentary federal republic, created in 1947 after British India was partitioned when
the  British  government  granted  India  its  independence.  Pakistan  was  created  for  the
Moslem population of the Indian sub-continent. Its population is about 170 million. After
September 11, 2001, Pakistan reassessed its relations with the Taliban and supported
the U.S. and international coalition in its efforts to remove the Taliban from power. Many
Islamic  extremists  and  terrorists  are  known  to  inhabit  parts  of  Pakistan,  leading  to  a
growth of their insurgency. Although Pakistan has intensified its efforts to deal with the
violence and terrorists, the country continues to experience serious problems. The U.S.
Department  of  State  confirms  that  many  border  cities  are  known  as  safe  havens  for
terrorists. Numerous suicide bombings and kidnappings have taken place over the past
years. Human rights violations continue to be a significant problem, as killings, torture,
and  disappearances  remain  prevalent.  The  Pakistani  government  maintains  domestic
intelligence surveillance activities. The U.S. government warns Americans against travel
to Pakistan.

"Applicant,  age   59,  is  married   with   two   adult  children.  He  earned   a   bachelor’s
degree  from  a  university  in Venezuela in 1984.  He has been  self-employed  full  time  in
the  information  technology  (IT) field  since  2008. He has been  employed  part time  by  an
IT   defense   contractor   as  an   instructor  since   2018.  This  is  his  first  application   for  a
security clearance. (GE 1)
Applicant,   his  wife,  and   eldest  child   are  Venezuelan   citizens  by   birth.  Applicant
entered   the   United   States  in   1991.   He  became   a   naturalized   U.S.  citizen   by   his  own
application  in 2013.  His wife  and  eldest child  also became  naturalized  U.S. citizens. His
youngest  child   is  a   U.S.  citizen   by   birth.   Applicant   chose   to   become   a   U.S.   citizen   to
fulfill his dream  of  “fully  embracing  the  United  States as his country”  where he  then  had
lived  with  his wife, raised  his children, and  worked  for over 25  years. (GE  1  at 9-10, 19-

Applicant’s mother (age 83), sister (age 54), and two brothers (ages 56 and 60)
are  citizens  and  residents  of  Venezuela.  They  all  reside  in  the  state  of  Bolivar,
Venezuela.  His  father,  mother-in-law,  and  father-in-law  are  deceased.  Applicant’s
mother  is  a  homemaker.  None  of  his  siblings  are  employed  by  the  Venezuelan
government.  He  communicates  by  either  telephone  or  email  with  his:  mother,  weekly;
sister, monthly; and brothers, quarterly. He travelled to Venezuela in 2011 and 2015 to
visit his family. (GE 1 at 26-30, 32; GE 2 at 4)
Applicant  and  his  wife  own  an  apartment  in  Venezuela  that  they  purchased  in
1991.  This  was  their  primary  residence  when  they  lived  in  Venezuela.  The  purchase
price  was  approximately  $40,000.  Applicant  is  not  sure  what  the  current  value  of  the
apartment  is,  but  estimates  that  it  has  very  little  value  due  to  the  poor  economy  in
Venezuela. The apartment is currently vacant.  He does not intend to sell the property at
this time, but may consider doing so if and when the economy improves. The apartment
is not important to Applicant’s overall financial situation. (GE 1 at 31; GE 2 at 3)
Applicant has sent money to his mother in the approximate amount of $400 per
quarter  for  the  past  30  years.  This  money  helps  with  her  day-to-day  expenses.  He
intends to continue these payments for the foreseeable future. He has owned his home

other U.S. assets. (GE 1 at 12-14, 32; GE 2 at 3-4)
Administrative Notice
Venezuela is legally a multiparty, constitutional republic. However, for more than
a decade, political power has been concentrated in a single party with  an authoritarian
executive.
The  United  States,  along  with  nearly  sixty  other  countries,  recognizes  Interim
President  Juan  Guaido  and  considers the  Venezuelan  National  Assembly  (NA),  which
he  currently  leads,  to  be  the  only  legitimate  federal  institution,  according  to  the
Venezuelan Constitution. The United States works with Interim President Juan Guaido
and  his  team  on  a  number  of  areas  of  mutual  concern,  including  humanitarian  and
migration
initiatives,  and
reestablishment of the rule of law. The United States proposed a Democratic Transition
Framework  in  2020  as  a  guide  to  help  Venezuelan  society  achieve  a  peaceful,
democratic transition.
issues,  security,  anti-narcotrafficking
issues,  health
Venezuela’s previous presidents, the late Hugo Chavez (1999-2013) and Nicolas
Maduro  (2013-2019),  defined  themselves  in  large  part  through  their  opposition  to  the
United  States,  regularly  criticizing  and  sowing  disinformation  about
the  U.S.
government,  its  policies,  and  its  relations  with  Latin  America.  Maduro,  who  was  not
reelected via free and fair elections, clings to power through the use of force. Maduro’s
former regime has consistently violated and abused the human rights and dignity of the
country’s citizens, plundered its natural resources, and driven a once-prosperous nation
into  economic  ruin  with  authoritarian  rule  and  ruinous  economic  policies.  Maduro’s
thugs  have  reportedly  engaged  in  killings  and  physical  abuse,  detained  political
opponents, and  severely interfered with the exercise of  freedom of expression, all in a
brutal effort to retain power.
Maduro  and  his  associates  use  criminal  activities  to  help  maintain  their
illegitimate  hold  on  power,  fostering  a  permissive  environment  for  known  terrorist
groups, including dissidents of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC-D),
the  Colombian-origin  National  Liberation  Army  (ELN),  and  Hezbollah  sympathizers.
Financial  ties  with  FARC-D,  ELN,  and  Venezuelan  paramilitary  groups  facilitate  the
public  corruption  and  graft  schemes  of  the  regime  to  include  members  of  the  armed
forces.
Significant human rights issues exist in Venezuela including: unlawful or arbitrary
killings,  including  extrajudicial  killings  by  security  forces  of  the  former  Maduro  regime,
including  regime-sponsored  armed  groups;  forced  disappearances;  torture  by  security
forces;  arbitrary  detention  by  security  forces;  harsh  and  life-threatening  prison
conditions;  political  prisoners;  unlawful  interference  with  privacy;  and  lack  of  judicial
independence. The former Maduro  regime  restricted free  expression  and  the press by
routinely  blocking  signals  and  interfering  with  the  operations  of,  or  shutting  down,
privately  owned  television,  radio,  and  other  media  outlets.  Libel,  incitement,  and
inaccurate reporting were subject to criminal charges. The former Maduro regime used
violence to repress peaceful demonstrations and repressed freedom of assembly. Other
issues included: intimidation, harassment, and abuse of  NA members, including denial
of  due  process  and  parliamentary immunity;  pervasive  corruption and  impunity among
all  Maduro-aligned  security  forces  and  in  other  national  and  state  regime  offices,
including  at  the  highest  levels;  trafficking  in  persons;  violence  against  indigenous
persons;  and  the  worst  forms  of  child  labor,  which  the  former  regime  made  minimal
efforts to eliminate.
Venezuela has one of the highest number of violent deaths in the region and in
the world.  Nationwide criminal developments in 2019 include that the  state of  Miranda
now ranks  as  the most  violent  state  in Venezuela,  with  the  state of  Bolivar now in  the
second position.
Venezuela  regularly  ranks  in  international  studies  as  one  of  the  most  corrupt
countries  in  Latin  America,  and  the  world.  In  2020,  anti-corruption  watchdog
Transparency International rated Venezuela 173rd out of 180 countries in its Corruption
Perception Index, rating Venezuela less corrupt than only Yemen, Syria, South Sudan,
and  Somalia.  Corruption  takes  many  forms,  from  motorists  bribing  traffic  police  to
allegations of bribes and kickbacks in the allocation of government contracts. Corruption
appears  to  have  reached  record  levels  in  recent  years,  with  government  institutions
becoming increasingly criminal in nature, including activities such as rampant corruption
in  the  state-controlled  food  distribution,  active  black  market  dollar  trading,  gasoline
smuggling, drug trafficking, illegal gold mining, and other activities.
The U.S. Department of State continues to assess Venezuela at Level 4 (out of
4),  which  indicates  that  travelers  should  not  travel  to  the  country  due  to  crime,  civil
unrest, poor health infrastructure, kidnapping, and arbitrary arrest and detention of U.S.
citizens.

"Applicant admitted the six allegations contained in the SOR. His admissions are
incorporated into the findings of fact below. (Item 4)
Applicant is 58 years old  and married. He was born in  Iraq and graduated from
high school there. He earned a bachelor’s degree in engineering from an Iraqi university
in  1983.  He  was  subsequently  conscripted  into  the  Iraqi  army  for  two  years.  He  then
worked for an Iraqi ministry from 1987 to 2010, when he left as a senior chief engineer.
(Item 4)
In April 2010, Applicant went to Syria. He stated that he left Iraq because he feared
for his and  his family’s lives. He said he had been kidnapped for one night in 2007. In
August 2010, Applicant immigrated to the United States under refugee status, along with
his wife and their son, who were Iraqi citizens. They became U.S. citizens in May 2016.
Applicant and his family are dual citizens with Iraq. (Items 5, 6)
Upon his arrival in the United States, Applicant was unemployed until December
2010, when he obtained a short-term contract with a private company. He worked for a
private food company for 15 months and was then unemployed until August 2012, when
he obtained the facilities engineer position where he remains today. (Item 6)
Applicant’s mother is deceased. His elderly father is a citizen and resident of Iraq.
His father worked for an Iraqi ministry for over 30 years and collects a pension. Applicant
contacts his father monthly. Applicant has two sisters, who are citizens and residents of
Iraq. Both work for the Iraqi government. He contacts them annually. (Item 6) Applicant
did not visit Iraq from 2010 to January 2019, at which time he visited his sick father for
three weeks. (Item 5)
Applicant has financial interests in Iraq. In 2017, he began receiving a pension of
$450 per month from Iraq for his 20 years of government service. Applicant’s friend, an
Iraqi citizen and resident, collects the pension for Applicant and then wires the money to
him. Applicant pays his friend 5 to 10 percent of his monthly pension for his assistance.
During his August 2019 background interview with a government investigator, Applicant
stated that he was not willing to give up this pension because he uses it to support his
family in the United States. (Item 5)
Applicant  owns  an  apartment  in  Iraq  with  an  estimated  value  of  $40,000  to
$50,000. He said he owns it on behalf of his spouse and sister-in-law, who cannot legally
own the property. To date, his wife and sister-in-law have not chosen to sell the property.
(Item 5) Applicant rents his home in the United States. (Item 4) He  did not submit any
evidence pertinent to his financial interests in the United States.
Iraq
I  have   taken   administrative   notice   of  facts  contained   in   U.S.   Government
documents  concerning  the  Federal Republic  of  Iraq, as  outlined  in Item  7,  including  the
following: Iraq  faces many  challenges fueled  by  sectarian  and  ethnic  divisions. Numerous
terrorist groups are increasingly active throughout Iraq. The Islamic State  of Iraq and the
Levant  (ISIL   or  Islamic  State)  controls   some   of   the   country’s  territory.  Threats  of
kidnapping  and  violence  are high, and  the  Department of State  warns U.S. citizens that
all  travel to  Iraq  should be  avoided. Additionally, human-rights-related  problems including
disappearances, torture, denial of fair  public trial,  and  limits on  freedom  of  expression,
are present.

"The  SOR  alleges  under  Guideline  B  that  Applicant’s  mother  is  a  citizen  and
resident of Taiwan. Applicant denies this allegation stating that his mother passed away
in  January  2020.  The  SOR  also  alleges  that  Applicant’s  two  brothers  are  citizens  and
residents of Taiwan and that one brother works in the telecom field and the other works
in the engineering field. The SOR further alleges that Applicant’s mother-in-law is a citizen
and resident of Taiwan, Applicant’s wife is a dual citizen of Taiwan and the United States,
and Applicant owns a home in Taiwan worth approximately $100,000. Applicant admits
each of these allegations. However, he denies that any of these circumstances should
raise security concerns.
Applicant, 54, is a software engineer currently employed by a defense contractor
since December 2017. He was born in Taiwan and attended high school, college, and
graduate school in Taiwan. After receiving his master’s degree in 1991, he was required
to serve two years in the military. Applicant was a junior lieutenant in the Taiwanese Army
from  July  1991  until  May  1993.  In  approximately  1994,  Applicant  moved  to  the  United
States  where  he  attended  a  university  from  1994  until  1997,  and  received  a  second
master’s degree. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in December 2006. Applicant and
his wife married in Taiwan in 1995. They have two adult children, both born in the United
States. This is Applicant’s first application for a security clearance. (GX 2.)
In his answer, Applicant stated that one of his brothers is a general manager for a
telecom company and his other brother is a civil engineer employed by a private company
that  “the  nature  of  [their]  work  makes  it  unlikely  that  [Applicant]  would  be  placed  in  a
position  where  [Applicant]  must  choose  between  foreign  and  U.S.  interests  due  to
[Applicant’s] relationship with [them].” He further stated that he is not in “frequent regular
communication”  with  either  of  his  brothers  and  that  he  does  not  discuss  his  work  with
them “in a way that could lead to security concerns.”
Applicant  stated  that  his  mother-in-law  is  “not  working  or  participating  in  any
political  or  professional  organization.”  He  further  stated  that  his  relationship  with  his
mother-in-law  is  unlikely  to  put  him  in  a  position  of  conflict  between  foreign  and  U.S.
interests. Since 2006, Applicant has traveled to Taiwan annually with the stated purposes
of  tourism  and  visiting  family.  He  has  visited  with  his  family  and  his  mother-in-law  in
person on each of these visits. (GX 2; GX 3.)
Applicant’s wife is a dual citizen of Taiwan and the United States. She maintains
her Taiwanese citizenship for ease of travel to visit her elderly mother. Applicant is also
a dual citizen of Taiwan and the United States. He stated on his e-QIP that Taiwan has
affordable medical coverage for citizens and he maintains his Taiwanese citizenship in
case of a medical emergency. (GX 2.)
Applicant  was  issued  a  Taiwanese  passport  in  2006  that  expired  in  2016.  He
traveled  to  Taiwan  using  this  passport  annually  from  2006  through  2015.  In  2016,
Applicant was issued a Taiwanese passport that expires in 2026. He used this passport
to  travel  to  Taiwan  in  2016,  2017,  and  2018.  Applicant  stated  in  his  personal  subject
interview (PSI)  that he uses his Taiwanese  passport to travel to Taiwan  instead of his
U.S.  passport  due  to  the  restriction  on  the  number  of  days  he  is  permitted  to  stay  in
country when using his U.S. passport. (GX 3.)
Applicant owns a home in Taiwan worth approximately $100,000. When listing the
home on his e-QIP, Applicant stated that the home was a “gift from [his] parent.” (GX 2.)
In his answer, he stated that he purchased the home in his name for his parents to live in
during  their  retirement.  The  home  is  currently  uninhabited  and  after  a  “culturally
appropriate period” of mourning of one year, he plans to sell the home.
Applicant purchased a house in the United States in 2009. He stated in his answer
that his children were born U.S. citizens, he and his wife have lived solely in the United
States for more than 20 years, and they have been naturalized citizens for more than 15
years. He further stated that he and his family consider themselves to be U.S. citizens
“first and  foremost”  and that they have  “demonstrated  [their]  allegiance”  to  the United
States by exercising their rights as citizens by “paying taxes, voting, serving for jury duty,
and   supporting  [their]  local  community.”  During  his  PSI,   Applicant  expressed  his
willingness to relinquish his Taiwanese citizenship if required to do so by his employer.
The United States and Taiwan enjoy a robust unofficial relationship. The 1979 U.S.
- P.R.C. Joint Communique switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing. In the
Joint  Communique,  the  United  States  recognized  the  Government  of  the  People’s
Republic  of  China  as  the  sole  legal  government  of  China,  acknowledging  the  Chinese
position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China. The Joint Communique
also stated that the people of the United States will maintain cultural, commercial, and
other unofficial relations with the people of Taiwan. The United States does not support
Taiwan independence.
The 2019 U.S. Department of State report on human rights in Taiwan noted that
there  were  no  reports  of  significant  human  rights  abuses.  However,  throughout  2019,
Beijing adopted a more coercive policy toward Taiwan, seeking to isolate and intimidate
Taipei into unification on Beijing’s terms. In January 2019, General Secretary Xi delivered
a  major  speech  wherein  he  claimed  that  Taiwan’s  unification  with  the  P.R.C  was
inevitable  and  indicated  that  the  “one  country,  two  systems”  model  was  the  only
acceptable arrangement for unification. That model has been consistently rejected by the
Taiwanese  public  and  presidential  administrations,  prompting  Beijing  to  intensify  its
multipronged campaign to coerce and isolate Taiwan. In implementing this policy, Beijing
sharply  escalated  its  military,  diplomatic,  and  economic  pressure  against  Taiwan,
including interfering in Taiwan’s media to shape public opinion on China and cross-Strait
relations.  The  deliberate  crossing  of  the  Taiwan  Strait  median  line  by  Chinese  fighter
aircraft  in  March  2019  was  the  first  such  crossing  in  20  years  and  marked  a  sharp
escalation in the military pressure Beijing has increasingly applied against Taipei. China
signaled that its intensifying campaign of military coercion had become official in a key
policy document released in July 2019.
The  United  States  faces  a  serious  threat  to  its  national  security  from  Chinese
intelligence  operations.  China  aggressively  targets  U.S.  sensitive  and  protected
information  and  Chinese  actors  are  the  world’s  most  active  perpetrators  of  economic
espionage. Taiwan has also been an active collector of U.S. economic technologies that
have sensitive military applications. There have been multiple cases involving the illegal
export, or attempted illegal export, of U.S. restricted, dual-use, or military technology to
Taiwan or by Taiwanese nationals. The dual-use of military technologies that have been
targeted  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  classified  materials,  trade  secrets,  weapons
technologies, and high-tech microelectronics.

Applicant  has  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  electrical  engineering,  awarded  in  1976,
and  he  has  a  master’s  degree  in  the  same  field,  awarded  in  1978.  He  also  earned  a
master’s  degree  in  operations  research  in  1984.  He  married  for  the  first  time  in  July
2016  to  his  current  spouse,  a  citizen  of  China.  (Enclosure  3  to  Answer)  He  has  no
children.
The  genesis  of  this  case  goes  back  to  2013-2014  when  Applicant  decided  he
wanted  to  pursue  marriage  with  an  Asian  woman  and  used  the  services  of  an  online
match-making service for that purpose. He informed his employer of his intention during
a  debriefing  regarding  foreign  travel  to  China  in  2014  when  he  traveled  to  meet  a
Chinese woman. (Exhibit 2) That same Chinese woman visited him in the United States.
Shortly thereafter in January 2015, the FBI interviewed Applicant concerning his contact
with  the  Chinese  citizen.  Upon  completion  of  the  interview,  the  FBI  informed  the
company facility security officer (FSO) that the interview went well, nothing unusual was
occurring, and they were satisfied that nothing was going on that the company needed
to be concerned about. Subsequently, Applicant and the Chinese woman decided to not
pursue the relationship further.
Applicant met the woman who is now his spouse in 2015 using the same online
medium he used  previously.  The  initial contact  was  by  e-mail  that gradually  increased
from  a  few  times  weekly  to  daily  as  well  as  two  video  calls  per  week.  He  traveled  to
China to meet her in 2015 or early 2016. She also traveled to the United States before
accepting his proposal of marriage. She returned to the United States in June 2016 and
they married the following month. She has since resided here with Applicant.
Applicant’s spouse was born in China in 1971. She earned a bachelor’s degree
in  textile  engineering  from  a  Chinese  university  in  1994.  She  then  worked  as  a
purchasing  agent  for  the  next  20  years  or  so  for  several  trading  companies  in  the
import-and-export business. (Tr. 90-91) Some of the trading companies were Chinese-
owned  businesses  while  two  were  foreign-owned  businesses  (Czech  Republic).  She
has no previous marriages and she has no children.
Applicant’s spouse entered the United States in 2016 on a conditional basis as a
fiancée of a U.S. citizen, also known as the fiancée visa. In September 2016, based on
her  marriage  to  Applicant,  her  immigration  status  was  adjusted  to  conditional  resident
status, and she was issued the so-called Green Card. (Enclosure 2 to Answer) In July
2018, her conditional resident status was extended for 18 months, as her initial Green
Card  was  due  to  expire  in  September  2018.  (Exhibit  B)  She  was  granted  permanent
resident status in August 2019 based on a bona fide marriage to Applicant, and she was
issued a Green Card valid for ten years. (Exhibit A)
Applicant’s spouse spent the first year or so getting settled in her new home. She
has  not  been  employed  in  the  United  States,  but  since  2018  she  has  been  a  full-time
student pursuing an MBA degree on full scholarship at a state university. (Tr. 35) She is
studying  business  data  analytics,  and  she  anticipates  she  will  complete  the  MBA
program in the summer of 2020. She is highly focused on achieving good grades, and
she intends to turn her attention to studying for the U.S. citizenship test upon completion
of the MBA program.
Applicant’s  spouse  maintains  contact  with  her  immediate  family  in  China,
consisting of her mother, father, and brother. She speaks with them via a Chinese multi-
purpose  messaging,  social  media,  and  mobile  payment  app,  which  is  on  her  smart
phone. Due to the language barrier, Applicant does not participate in the calls other than
a greeting or wave. Applicant and his spouse traveled to China in February 2018 for the
New Year’s holiday and Applicant met his in-laws during the trip. Otherwise, he has had
no in-person contact with his Chinese in-laws.
Applicant’s  spouse’s father and  mother, age  83  and 76,  have  both  been  retired
for more than 20 years. Neither were employed directly by the Chinese government nor
the  Chinese  military.  His  spouse  speaks  with  her parents  at  least  weekly.  Her  brother
works as a purchasing agent for a manufacturing business (large machinery). He is not
employed directly by the Chinese government or military. Given the time difference and
her  brother’s  job,  she  has  little  communication  with  her  brother.  (Tr.  87)  She  has  the
same  amount  of  contact  with  her  sister-in-law  who  works  as  a  bookkeeper  for  a  local
college in China.
Applicant  does  not  have  business,  financial,  or  property  interests  in  China.  The
same  is  true  for  his  spouse  except  for  a  bank  account  in  China,  which  she  has
maintained for occasional online shopping at a Chinese online retail business. She has
not used the bank account for months and estimated a balance of less than US $1,000.
She has not made a deposit to the account since she departed China, and she is simply

As  a  longtime  clearance  holder,  Applicant  does  not  discuss  his  work  with  his
spouse, other than the general unclassified work that he performs for the company. (Tr.
62)  He  expressed  a  good  understanding  of  and  sensitivity  to  the  security  issues
involved with his spouse’s family members in China. (Tr. 66-68) His spouse now knows
he has a security clearance due to her participation in the hearing, but he did not inform
her  earlier,  although  she  may  have  learned  about  the  matter  during  his  telephone
discussions with his attorney. (Tr. 62) His spouse stated that she told her parents that
Applicant is an engineer, but that was the extent of the conversation. (Tr. 83)
Concerning
the  country  of  China,  Department  Counsel’s
for
administrative  notice  contains  an  extensive  discussion  of  the  security  concerns
associated with China. (Exhibit 3) The essential facts about China are the following: (1)
China is an authoritarian state in which the Chinese Communist Party is the paramount
authority; (2) China (along with Russia) is the most aggressive collector of  intelligence
(both  industrial and military)  related  to  U.S.  information and  technology;  and  (3)  China
has  a  poor  record  of  human  rights  regarding  respect  for  the  integrity  of  the  person,
respect for civil liberties, respect for political rights, corruption and lack of transparency
in  government,  worker  rights,  as  well  as  discrimination,  societal  abuses,  and  human
trafficking.

Law and Policies
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (E.O.)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of
Defense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review
Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  National  Security
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.
It  is  well-established  law  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.1  As
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side  of  denials.”2  Under  Egan,  Executive  Order  10865,  and  the  Directive,  any  doubt
about  whether  an  applicant  should  be  allowed  access  to  classified  information  will  be
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that
the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has
followed  the  Court’s  reasoning,  and  a  judge’s  findings  of  fact  are  reviewed  under  the
substantial-evidence standard.4
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access  to  classified  information.5  Under  the  Directive,  the  parties  have  the  following
burdens:  (1)  Department  Counsel  has  the  burden  of  presenting  evidence  to  establish
facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for
presenting  evidence  to  refute,  explain,  extenuate,  or  mitigate  facts  that  have  been
admitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain
a favorable clearance decision.6
Discussion
The  gravamen  of  the  SOR  under  Guideline  B  for  foreign  influence  is  whether
Applicant’s  ties  to  China  should  disqualify  him  from  access  to  classified  information.
Under  Guideline  B  for  foreign  influence,  the  suitability  of  an  applicant  may  be
questioned or put into doubt due to foreign contacts and interests. The overall concern
is set forth in AG ¶ 6 as follows:
1  Department  of  the  Navy  v.  Egan,  484  U.S.  518,  528  (1988)  (“it  should  be  obvious  that  no  one  has  a
‘right’ to a security clearance”); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no
right to a security clearance).
2 484 U.S. at 531.
3 484 U.S. at 531.
4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).
5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).
6 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶ E3.1.14 and E3.1.15.
Foreign  contacts  and  interests,  including  but  not  limited  to  business,
financial,  and  property  interests,  are  a  national  security  concern  if  they
result in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern
if they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or
induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a
way  inconsistent  with  U.S.  interests  or  otherwise  made  vulnerable  to
pressure  or  coercion  by  any  foreign  interest.  Assessment  of  foreign
contacts  and  interests  should  consider  the  country  in  which  the  foreign
contact  or  interest  is  located,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  considerations
such  as  whether it  is known  to  target  U.S. citizens  to  obtain  classified  or
sensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism.
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise a security concern under
AG ¶ 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:
AG  ¶  7(a)  contact,  regardless  of  method,  with  a  foreign  family  member,
business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen
of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk
of  foreign  exploitation,  inducement,  manipulation,  pressure,  or  coercion;
and
AG ¶ 7(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country
that  create  a  potential  conflict  of  interest  between  the  individual's
obligation  to  protect  classified  or  sensitive  information  or  technology  and
the  individual's  desire  to  help  a  foreign  person,  group,  or  country  by
providing that information or technology.
The  starting  point  for  the  analysis  is  the  country  of  China.  Suffice  it  to  say,  the
U.S.  Government  views  the  behavior  of  the  Chinese  government  as  presenting  a
serious national security concern. The heightened-risk element is easily satisfied. Given
Applicant’s  family  ties  to  China,  via  his  spouse,  the  Government  has  established  its
case under Guideline B. The above disqualifying conditions are raised by the evidence.
The guideline provides that certain facts and circumstances may mitigate foreign
influence  concerns.  Given  the  evidence  here,  I  considered  the  following  mitigating
conditions:
AG ¶ 8(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country
in  which  these  persons  are  located,  or  the positions  or activities  of  those
persons  in  that  country  are  such  that  it  is  unlikely  the  individual  will  be
placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign
individual,  group,  organization,  or  government  and  the  interests  of  the
United States; and
AG  ¶  8(b)  there  is  no  conflict  of  interest,  either  because  the  individual’s
sense  of  loyalty  or  obligation  to  the  foreign  person,  or  allegiance  to  the
group,  government,  or  country  is  so  minimal,  or  the  individual  has  such
deep  and  longstanding  relationships  and  loyalties  in  the  United  States,
that  the  individual  can  be  expected  to  resolve  any  conflict  of  interest  in
favor of the U.S. interest.
China’s  relationship  with  the  United  States  and  the  heightened  risk  it  presents
place  a  heavy  burden  on  Applicant  to  mitigate  the  security  concern.  With  that  said,
Applicant  has  multiple  indicators  of  a  mature,  stable,  responsible,  and  trustworthy
person.  He  was  serious,  candid,  and  credible  at  the  hearing.  He  appears  to  have
cooperated fully and provided truthful information during the security clearance process
and during an interview with the FBI. He made a good impression upon me during the
hearing.
I have considered the totality of Applicant’s ties to China via his spouse and I am
not  unduly  concerned.  Applicant  has  a  demonstrated  record  as  a  reliable  clearance
holder and employee in the defense industry for the last 40 years or so. He expressed a
good understanding of and sensitivity to the security issues involved with his spouse’s
family  members  in  China.  (Tr.  66-68)  Although  the  family  ties  to  China  still  count  and
cannot  be  dismissed  out  of  hand,  the  strength  of  those  ties  are  diminished  given  the
facts and circumstances here. On balance, his ties to the United States are far stronger
than the largely nominal family ties to China.
Given  the  totality  of  facts  and  circumstances,  I  conclude  that  it  is  unlikely
Applicant  will be  placed  in a  position  of  having  to  choose  between  the  interests of  the
United States and the interests of the Chinese government or her family members who
have  Chinese  citizenship.  I  further  conclude  there  is  no  conflict  of  interest,  because
Applicant has developed such deep and long-standing relationships and loyalties in the
United States that he can be expected to resolve any potential conflict of interest in the
favor of the United States. AG ¶ 8(a) is partially applicable. AG ¶ 8(b) is applicable.
Following  Egan  and  the  clearly  consistent  standard,  I  have  no  doubts  or
concerns  about  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  good  judgment,  and  ability  to
protect  classified  or  sensitive  information.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  I  weighted  the
evidence  as  a  whole  and  considered  if  the  favorable  evidence  outweighed  the
unfavorable  evidence  or  vice  versa.  I  also  considered  the  whole-person  concept.
Accordingly, I conclude that he met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified
information.
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are:
Paragraph 1, Guideline B:
For Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.a – 1.c:
For Applicant
Conclusion
It  is  clearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  Applicant  eligibility  for
access to classified information. Eligibility granted.

"Under Guideline B, the Government alleged that Applicant’s wife is a citizen and
resident of Poland, and that she is a major in the Polish army (SOR 1.a). Under Guideline
F, the Government alleged that Applicant owes $13,930 for three delinquent or past-due
debts  (SOR  2.a –  2.c).  Applicant  has  admitted  all  of the SOR  allegations.  (Answer)  In
addition  to  the  facts  established  by  Applicant’s  admissions,  and  based  on  all  of  the
information before me, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 57 years old, and was born and raised in Poland. He immigrated with
his family to the United States at age 13 and became a U.S. citizen in 1979. Applicant
enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in 1980 and served for four years as a radar technician. He
first received a security clearance while in the military, and he was honorably discharged
in  1984.  Thereafter,  Applicant  worked  for  several  different  defense  contractors  in
positions  that  required  a  security  clearance.  He  embarked  on  other  employment
opportunities in the information technology (IT) field until 2010. Between 2010 and 2014,
Applicant worked as a federally-contracted Polish-English linguist in support of coalition
forces at a forward operating base (FOB) in Afghanistan. Between March 2014 and April
2017, Applicant was a self-employed computer repair technician before being hired as an
IT  technician  by  a  health  care  organization.  Applicant  then  was  re-hired  as  a  Polish
linguist by the defense contractor for whom he previously worked in Afghanistan, this time
for  work  in  Poland.  His  assignment  to  an  overseas  job  location  is  contingent  on  a
favorable outcome of this adjudication. (GX 1; GX 5; AX A; Tr. 36, 56)
While  working  in  Afghanistan  in  2010,  he  met  and  began  a  relationship  with  a
Polish army officer assigned to the same FOB. She was a divorced mother of one child
and her home of record has always been in Poland. She was then, and continues to be,
a citizen of Poland residing therein. In September 2011, she and Applicant were married
in the United States while he was home for two weeks of leave. Thereafter, both Applicant
and his new wife returned to Afghanistan. On his return to the FOB, Applicant reported
his marriage to his supervisors and his company security manager, and he continued his
work at the FOB until the end of his rotation in November 2011. Before he could return to
Afghanistan after that rotation, Applicant was interviewed on multiple occasions about his
marriage to a foreign national to determine if he was still eligible for classified work at the
FOB.  Applicant’s  mother  and  the  rest  of  his  immediate  family  have  long  been  either
naturalized citizens or permanent resident aliens living in the United States. (GX 1; GX 5;
AX A; AX C; Tr. 33 – 36, 71 – 73)
In April 2012, Applicant again deployed to Afghanistan, where he would continue
to work with a security clearance on a rotational basis until February 2014; however, his
wife completed her military deployment and returned to Poland in October 2013. Applicant
traveled to Poland with  his wife between November 2011 and February 2012. He also
traveled  there  to  see her in  March  and  November 2014, and for about  three  weeks  in
December 2014  and  January  2015. Applicant’s  wife  also  traveled  to  the  United States
over the Christmas holidays in 2013. They have not seen each other since January 2015,
and the only time they have communicated by phone or email since December 2016 was
in May 2019. Additionally, a few days before his hearing, Applicant’s mother received a
phone  call  from  his  wife,  who  conveyed  that  she  was  retired  from  the  Polish  military.
Applicant does not know what his wife does for a living now or how long she has been
retired. On November 13, 2019, Applicant filed for divorce in a state court in the United
States. (GX 1; GX 5; AX A; AX C; Tr. 44, 47, 53)
After he returned from Afghanistan in 2014, Applicant  had difficulty finding work
that  would  enable him  to  provide  him, his wife,  and  her child a  good  life  in  the  United
States. They have been estranged since early 2015 because they had agreed she and
her  child  would  only  immigrate  to  the  United  States  if  Applicant  found  employment
sufficient to support them all comfortably in a house they could own.  Applicant and his
wife have never lived together in an established marital residence. (GX 1; GX 5; AX A;
Tr. 50 – 52, 54 – 59, 66 – 70)
Poland and the United States are close allies in all respects. Our State Department
characterizes that alliance as “stalwart.” Applicant’s wife’s presence in Afghanistan with
the  Polish  army  was  due  to  Poland’s  cooperation  with,  and  support  of,  United  States
geopolitical  efforts  in  Afghanistan  and  other  parts  of  the  world.  Poland  successfully
transitioned from being a Warsaw Pact nation within the ambit of the Soviet Union to a
member in good standing of NATO in 2000. Since then, it has been actively engaged with
the United States and the European Union in all facets of military and economic efforts in
Europe.  Poland  is  a  leading  trade  partner  in  Eastern  and  Central  Europe.  Available
information does not reflect any significant human rights or other issues, such as military
or economic espionage directed at the United States by Poland. (HX 2)
Since  leaving  his  employment  as  a  linguist  in  2014,  Applicant  has  experienced
uneven employment and income-earning circumstances. As previously noted, his inability
to find work that would support his wife and her child in the United States has been at the
heart of the failure of his marriage. Additionally, available information shows that Applicant
incurred numerous delinquent and past-due debts since about 2015. The debts alleged
SOR 2.a and 2.b have been delinquent since the middle of 2015; the debt at SOR 2.c has
been  delinquent  since  2018.  Applicant  acknowledged  in  his  testimony  that  he  has  not
taken any action to resolve any of his debts. He also described other financial challenges,
such as the need for him to provide financial assistance with family medical expenses
over the years, and other recent unplanned expenses that have impaired his ability to pay
his debts and meet his current expenses. Applicant did not present any information that
shows  his  current  finances  would  be  sufficient  to  both  address  his  outstanding
delinquencies  and  avoid  similar  problems  in  the  future.  He  has  not  sought  any  credit
counseling or other professional assistance in resolving his financial problems. (GX 2 –
5; AX A; Tr. 37 – 40, 59 - 66)
Applicant’s  work  in  support  of  coalition  forces  in  Afghanistan  put  him  at  great
personal risk. Several times, the FOB where he worked came under hostile fire and on
one occasion he was injured during an attack. His work earned him praise from Polish
and  U.S.  commanders,  whose  confidence  he  earned  through  his  professionalism  and
dedication to the missions he supported. (Answer; AX A; AX B; Tr. 44 – 45)

"Applicant is 51 years old. He has worked for a major aerospace company since
2007 as a manufacturing planner, and applied for a security clearance in order to qualify
for work on defense contracts. He was born and lived in India until age 23. He entered
the United States with a student visa in 1992, intending to remain and pursue a career in
the aviation industry. He and his second wife married in 1999, and have three children,
ages 22, 16, and 7. He has a 25-year-old daughter from his first marriage, with whom he
has little contact. All four of Applicant’s children were born in the United States. His first
wife, who he married in 1994, was a naturalized U.S. citizen who was born in Pakistan.
His second wife, who he married in 1999, was born in India and became a naturalized
U.S. citizen in 2018. (GE 1; GE 2; AE A; AE B; AE C; Tr. 37-39, 50-51.)
Applicant testified that his father, who is deceased, worked for the Indian national
government  as  “a  joint  director.  He  said  his  father  “was  highest  position  in  India,”  and
served as “the Director of Agriculture.” (Tr. 57.) His father retired from that position with a
pension, and his mother continues to receive spousal pension benefits from the Indian
government.  (Tr.  69.)  From  2007  to  2012,  Applicant’s  father  and  mother  came  to  the
United  States  to  live  with  him  and  obtained  permanent  resident  (green  card)  status.
However, they preferred to live in India, and decided to move back. His mother is in her
early eighties, and intends to remain there. She lives there with one of Applicant’s brothers
and  one  of  his  sisters.  He  speaks  with  her  once  or twice  a  week,  and  sends  financial
support  for  her  to  his  brother,  averaging  less  than  $500  per  month  on  a  semi-regular
basis. Applicant’s mother-in-law is also a citizen and resident of India. His father-in-law is
deceased. (Answer; GE 1; Tr. 42-46, 51-53, 67-69.)
Applicant’s  six  brothers  and  three  sisters  were  all  born  in  India.  Three  of  his
brothers  and  his  three  sisters  still  reside  in  their  family’s  hometown  there.  Applicant
testified that all but one of them, or their spouses, works in the private sector as doctors
or engineers. One of the sisters is a homemaker who is not otherwise employed. Two of
Applicant’s younger brothers have moved to Canada and become citizens there. They
also work as engineers. His youngest brother is a pharmacist who maintains his Indian
citizenship but has lived and worked in Saudi Arabia for more than 15 years. Applicant
said  that  these  three  brothers,  and  possibly  one  of  his  sisters,  have  visa  applications
pending and hope to move to the United States in the near future. (Answer; GE 1; Tr. 34-
35, 47-49, 66.)
Applicant owns no real estate in India, but owns five different homes in the United
States, three of which he rents to tenants. One remains vacant because Applicant hopes
that one of his brothers will immigrate and live there. He and one of his daughters have a
joint bank account in India containing the equivalent of several thousand dollars, which
he uses during his annual visits there. (Tr. 46, 49, 70-72.)
Neither  party  produced  witness  testimony  or  documentary  evidence  concerning
Applicant’s  character,  work  performance,  or  record  of  compliance  with  procedures  for
protecting sensitive information. Applicant testified that he has two master’s degrees and
will soon complete his dissertation for a PhD degree. He is seeking a security clearance
to become eligible to apply for a manufacturing planner position within his company that
requires only an associate’s degree and three years of related experience. (GE 1; GE 2;
AE B; AE C; Tr. 38-40.)
I have taken administrative notice of facts concerning the states of India and Saudi
Arabia,  as  set  forth  on  pages  2  through  7  of  HE  II,  and  pages  2  through  4  of  HE  III,
respectively. These facts are derived from and contained in U.S. Government publications
referenced in those hearing exhibits, and include the following: India is among the most
active foreign nations targeting U.S. aeronautical and other high-technology sectors for
economic collection and industrial espionage. Numerous criminal cases during the past
12 years involved India-related espionage and illegal export of U.S. scientific information
and technology. There are also significant concerns over ongoing terrorist and insurgent
activities, government corruption, and human rights abuses. Saudi Arabia is a monarchy
with numerous human rights issues and organized anti-American terrorist activities.

"Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations with some clarifications. (Tr. 10; HE

herein  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  complete  and  thorough  review  of  the  evidence  of
record, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  56-year-old  linguist,  and  DOD  contractors  have  employed  him
since April 2015 in Iraq. (Tr. 23) Shortly after his hearing, he returned to Iraq to continue
his  linguist  duties.  (Tr.  26)  His  annual  salary  as  a  linguist  is  $80,000.  (Tr.  23)  Before
becoming a linguist, he worked in a hotel as a cook. (Tr. 23) In Iraq, before coming to
the  United  States,  he  worked  in  the  oil  industry.  (Tr.  47)  Applicant  and  his  family  are
Roman Catholic,3 and he and his wife are from the Kurdistan region of Iraq. (Tr. 51-52,
54)
In 1984, Applicant received a technical degree with a specialty in petroleum. (AE
A)  From  1985  to  1987,  he  performed  mandatory  service  in  the  Iraqi  army.  (AE  A)  In
1989, he married, and his children are ages 24, 27, and 28. (Tr. 18-20) His spouse is 56
years old. (Tr. 22) His children are citizens and residents of the United States. (Tr. 19-
21) His father-in-law and mother-in-law are citizens and residents of the United States,
and in 2006, they arranged for Applicant, his spouse, and their children’s immigration to
the  United  States  from  Iraq.  (Tr.  21-22,  53)  In  2012,  Applicant  and  his  spouse  were
naturalized  as  U.S.  citizens.  (Tr.  52)  He  has  property  in  the  United  States  including  a
home and about $22,000 in his U.S. bank account. (Tr. 24; AE F)
The SOR alleges that Applicant has three relatives living in Iraq.  His father and
one sister are citizens and residents of Kurdistan, a region of Iraq. (Tr. 26; SOR ¶¶ 1.a
and 1.b; GE 1) His father and sister live together. (Tr. 27) His father is 84 years old and
suffers from cancer and high blood pressure. (Tr. 38) His mother is deceased. (Tr. 40)
His  most  recent  visit  with  his  father  was  in 2012, and  he most  recently  communicated
with his father or sister two or three years ago. (Tr. 27-28) He does not send money to
his father or sister in Iraq. (Tr. 28) He does not own property or bank accounts in Iraq.
(Tr. 28-29) When his father dies, he does not plan to go to Iraq for his father’s funeral,
and his father’s property in Iraq will go to his sister in Iraq. (Tr. 39-41) His only visits to
Iraq after 2012 were on behalf of his employer. (Tr. 41)
Applicant  has  a  sister  who  lived  in  Iraq  and  is  a  citizen  of  Iraq.  She  currently
resides  in  Germany  with  her  husband.  (Tr.  29;  SOR  ¶  1.c)  He  communicates  with  his
sister  in  Germany,  who  provides  information  to  Applicant  about  his  family  in  Iraq.  (Tr.

3 In accordance with “well established DoD policy [Applicant and his family’s] religious affiliation
play[ed] no part” in this decision. ISCR Case No. 08-06795 at 6 n. 3 (App. Bd. May 25, 2012).
Foreign Preference
Applicant  is  not  fluent  in  English.  He  admitted  twice  that  he  voted  in  an  Iraqi
election  in  2014.  (Tr.  30;  SOR  response;  Officer  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)
personal  subject  interview  (PSI);  GE  2)  In  his  OPM  PSI,  which  is  the  investigator’s
summary of his statement, he said he voted because he wanted to help Iraq become a
better  democratic  country  like  the  United  States.  (Tr.  44;  GE  2)  He  may  have  simply
agreed  with  the  OPM  investigator’s  statements  about  voting.  Applicant  explained  in
broken  English,  “It’s  not  a  vote.  There  was  misunderstood  for  me  in  that  question,
because they, did you practice or did you exercise this election. I said yes. Yeah I work
on it. I’m not vote in it.” (Tr. 31) He said he did not understand English “very good,” and “I
work there. It’s not vote.” (Tr. 44) “I see a lot of Iraqis they come to vote. That one they
vote in Iraq and they vote. For that I say it’s allowed to Iraqis to vote who’s living in the
U.S. . . . So for that I say they allowed to me. But I’m not voted on.” (Tr. 45-46) He was
unable to clarify the content of the summary in his OPM PSI, possibly because he could
not  understand  the  questions  about  it;  however,  he  insisted  that  he  did  not  vote  in  the
Iraqi election. (Tr. 49)
In  2010  and  2014,  Applicant  worked  as  a  volunteer  while  living  in  the  United
States to help expatriate Iraqis living in the United States vote in Iraqi elections. (Tr. 31-
32,  47)  He  was  paid  in  2014;  however,  he  was  unsure  if  he  was  paid  in  2010  for  this
work.  (Tr.  31-32;  42-43)  He  did  not  say  whether or not  the Iraqi  or  U.S.  government or
some other entity paid him in 2014.
Applicant did not believe he continued to have Iraqi citizenship, and in any event,
he  was  willing  to  renounce  his  Iraqi  citizenship.  (Tr.  50)4  In  2012,  he  took  the
Naturalization Oath of Allegiance to the United States of America (AE H) which states:
I  hereby  declare,  on  oath,  that  I  absolutely  and  entirely  renounce  and
abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or
sovereignty, of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen;
that  I  will  support  and  defend  the  Constitution  and  laws  of  the  United
States  of  America  against  all  enemies,  foreign  and  domestic;  that  I  will
bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I will bear arms on behalf
of  the  United  States  when  required  by  the  law;  that  I  will  perform
noncombatant  service  in  the  Armed  Forces  of  the  United  States  when
required by the law; that I will perform work of national importance under
civilian  direction  when  required  by  the  law;  and  that  I  take  this  obligation
freely,  without any  mental  reservation  or  purpose of evasion;  so  help me
God.5
4 The Iraqi Council of the Presidency issued Article 10(I), which states, “An Iraqi who acquires a
foreign  nationality  shall  retain  his  Iraqi  nationality,  unless  he  has  declared  in  writing  renunciation  of  his
Iraqi nationality.” Iraqi Official Gazette Issue 4019 dated March 7, 2006, No. 26, https://www.refworld.org/

5  The  language  of  the  current  Oath  of  Allegiance  is  found  in  the  Code  of  Federal  Regulations
Section 337.1 and is closely based upon the statutory elements in Section 337(a) of the Immigration and
Nationality  Act.  U.S.  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Services,  8  U.S.C.  §  1448,  https://www.uscis.gov/us-

On  April  19,  2018,  an  Army  colonel  and  Task  Force  commander,  who  served
with Applicant in Iraq from August 2017 to April 2018, wrote:
[Applicant’s] dedication, professionalism and positive demeanor positively
impacted the Task Force’s ability to communicate, coordinate and execute
operations in close partnership with Iraqi senior leaders. [Applicant] could
always  be  counted  upon  to  assist  with  requirements,  going  above  and
beyond to accomplish the mission. His superb knowledge of the language
and culture directly impacted the unit’s ability to achieve mission success
and he was an indispensable member of the team.

Iraq
The U.S. Mission in Iraq remains dedicated to building a strategic partnership with
Iraq and the Iraqi people. The December 2011 departure of U.S. troops from Iraq marked
a milestone in our relationship as Iraq continues to develop as a sovereign, stable, and
self-reliant country. Iraq is now a key partner for the United States in the region as well
as  a  voice  of  moderation  and  democracy  in  the  Middle  East.  Iraq  has  functioning
government  institutions  including  an  active  legislature,  is  playing  an  increasingly
constructive role in the region, and has a bright economic future as oil revenues surpass
pre-Saddam  production  levels  with  continued  rapid  growth  to  come.  The  United  States
maintains  vigorous  and  broad  engagement  with  Iraq  on  diplomatic,  political,  economic,
and security issues in accordance with the U.S.-Iraq Strategic Framework Agreement.
The  Strategic  Framework  Agreement  (SFA)  between  Iraq  and  the  United  States
provides the basis for the U.S.-Iraq bilateral relationship. It covers the range of bilateral
issues  including  political  relations  and  diplomacy,  defense  and  security,  trade  and
finance,  energy,  judicial  and  law  enforcement  issues,  services,  science,  culture,
education,  and  environment.  Efforts  to  implement  the  SFA  are  overseen  by  the  Higher
Coordinating  Committee  and  several  Joint  Coordination  Committees,  which  meet
periodically.
The  U.S.  State  Department  warns  that  U.S.  citizens  in  Iraq  are  at  high  risk  for
violence  and  kidnapping,  and  advises  U.S.  citizens  not  to  travel  to  Iraq.  The  current
travel advisory level is Level 4: Do not travel.
The  ability  of  the  U.S.  Embassy  to  provide  consular  services  to  U.S.  citizens
outside  Baghdad  is  limited  given  the  security  environment.  Anti-U.S.  sectarian  militias
may  threaten  U.S.  citizens  and  western  companies  throughout  Iraq.  Kidnappings  and
attacks  by  IEDs  occur  in  many  areas  of  the  country,  including  Baghdad.  Methods  of
attack  have  included  explosively  formed  penetrators  (EFPs),  magnetic  IEDs  placed  on
vehicles,  human  and  vehicle-borne  IEDs,  mines  placed  on  or  concealed  near  roads,
mortars and rockets, and shootings using various direct fire weapons. Such attacks may
take place in public venues such as cafes and markets.
Iraq  witnessed  continued  terrorist  activity  in  2016,  primarily  as  a  result  of  the
actions of ISIL. In 2016, ISIL remained the greatest terrorist threat globally, maintaining a
formidable  force  in  Syria,  including  a  large  number  of  foreign  terrorist  fighters.  ISIL’s
capacity  and  territorial  control  in  Iraq  has  dramatically  eroded  in  the  past  two  years.
According  to  estimates  from  the  UN  Assistance  Mission  for  Iraq,  acts  of  terrorism  and
violence  killed  more  than  7,000  civilians  and  injured  more  than  12,000  in  2016.  By  the
end  of  2017,  Iraqi  Security  Forces  had  liberated  all  territory  from  ISIL,  drastically
reducing ISIL’s ability to commit abuses and atrocities. Human rights violations continue
to  be  a  problem  with  allegations  of  unlawful  killings  and  other  abuses  being  made
against the Iraqi Security Forces and Popular Mobilization Forces.
In  its  annual  human  rights  report,  the  U.S.  Department  of  State  reported  that
severe  human  rights  problems  were  widespread.  Sectarian  hostility,  widespread
corruption,  and  lack  of  transparency  at  all  levels  of  government  and  society  weakened
the  government's  authority  and  worsened  effective  human  rights  protections.  Iraqi
Security  Forces,  members  of  the  Federal  Police,  and  the  Peshmerga  committed  some
human rights violations, and there continued to be reports of Popular Mobilization Forces
killing,  torturing,  kidnapping,  and  extorting  civilians.  ISIL  committed  the  overwhelming
majority of serious human rights abuses, including attacks against: civilians, (particularly
Shia  but  also  Sunnis  who  opposed  ISIL);  members  of  other  religious  and  ethnic
minorities; women; and children.
Observers  also  reported  other  significant  human  rights-related  problems:  harsh
and  life-threatening  conditions  in  detention  and  prison  facilities;  arbitrary  arrest  and
lengthy  pretrial  detention,  denial  of  fair  public  trial;  insufficient  judicial  institutional
capacity;  ineffective  implementation  of  civil  judicial  procedures  and  remedies;  arbitrary
interference  with  privacy  and  homes;  child  soldiers;  limits  on  freedom  of  expression,
including  press  freedoms;  violence  against  and  harassment  of  journalists;  undue
censorship;  social,  religious,  and  political  restrictions  in  academic  and  cultural  matters;
limits on freedoms of peaceful assembly and association; limits on religious freedom due
to  violence  by  extremist  groups;  restrictions  on  freedom  of  movement;  refugee  and
internally  displaced  persons  (IDP)  abuse;  both  forced  IDP  returns  and  preventing  IDPs
from  returning  home;  discrimination  against  and  societal  abuse  of  women  and  ethnic,
religious, and racial minorities, including exclusion from decision-making roles; trafficking
in  persons;  societal  discrimination  and  violence  against  lesbian,  gay,  bisexual,
transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) persons; seizure of property without due process; and
limitations on worker rights.
The  United  States’  extraordinary  commitment  to  Iraq  is  balanced  against  the
inherent dangers of the ongoing conflict in Iraq to its citizens and residents and the Iraqi
government’s  problems  developing  and  complying  with  the  rule  of  law.  A  top  national
security goal of the United States is to establish relationships, cooperation, training, and
support of the Iraqi Government and military in the ongoing war against terrorism.

Egyptian  passport  issued  in  2014  that  was  not  scheduled  to  expire  until  2021  (SOR  ¶
1.a). He indicated that when he traveled to Egypt, he did so on his U.S. passport; upon
arrival in Egypt, he used his Egyptian passport as identification to show that he was an
Egyptian  citizen,  because  it  was  convenient  for  him  to  do  so.  He  relinquished  his
Egyptian  passport  to  his  facility  security  officer  (FSO)  when  he  received  the  SOR  in
2017. He testified that he had no intentions of retrieving his Egyptian passport from his
FSO or obtaining another Egyptian passport in the future.6
Applicant’s second ex-wife is a citizen and resident of Egypt; their son is a dual
citizen of the United States and Egypt, residing with Applicant’s second ex-wife in Egypt
(SOR  ¶¶  2.a,  2.b).  Applicant  married  his  second  ex-wife  in  Egypt.  He  sponsored  her
move to the United States, but she never became a U.S. citizen. She returned to Egypt
in  November  2015  with  their  son,  and  Applicant  testified  that  he  has  not  since  had
contact with either of them. She works as an accountant for a bank in Egypt. Applicant
was unaware whether the bank was affiliated with the Egyptian government. Applicant
testified that she has custody of their son, according to Egyptian law, until he reaches
age 15, at which point he can choose the parent with whom he wants to live. Applicant

Egyptian  government,  and  his  one  brother  was  formerly  employed  by  the  Egyptian
government (SOR ¶¶ 2.c - 2.g). He has not spoken to his former mother-in-law since his
2017 divorce. He indicated in his SCA that she worked for the Egyptian government. He
testified that he visits his family in Egypt approximately once every two to three years,
and he did so in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014 and 2016. He planned to visit them less
in the future, and testified that he would do so using his U.S. passport. He testified that
none  of  his  family  in  Egypt  are  aware  that  he  is  seeking  to  maintain  his  eligibility  for
access to sensitive information, and do not know the nature of his work.8
Applicant’s  mother  is  79  years  old.  His  54-year-old  brother  lives  with  her.  She
has never worked outside of the home. Applicant’s father was a teacher for the Egyptian
Department of Education (DOE); he died when Applicant was 14 years old. Applicant’s

believe this brother had any current affiliations with the Egyptian government or military.
This brother’s wife and children continue to live in Egypt. Applicant talks to this brother
two  to  three  times  yearly.  Applicant  sent  him  $400  in around  early  2018,  because  this

From  2008  to  2016, Applicant  owned  an  apartment  in  Egypt;  its value  as  of  his
SCA  was  approximately  $40,000  USD  (SOR  ¶  2.h).  With  help  from  his  mother  and
siblings,  he  purchased  it  for  approximately  $10,000  USD  from  his  60-year-old  brother,
with the idea that he would use it with his family when he traveled to Egypt. He sold it
for  $25,000  USD  to  a  distant  relative,  and  he  gave  all  of  the  proceeds  to  his  family  in
Egypt. At the time of his SCA, he also had a bank account in Egypt. He opened it with
$200 USD between 2012 and 2014. He had returned to Egypt to live, while working as a
medical  interpreter  for  a  U.S.  company  and  completing  his  master’s  degree,  to  spend
time with his then-wife and son and complete their paperwork to immigrate to the United

groups,  including  the  Islamic  State  of  Iraq  and  Syria  (ISIS)  have  committed  multiple
deadly attacks in Egypt. U.S. diplomatic personnel are prohibited from travel in parts of
Egypt, and U.S. citizens are warned to avoid those areas.

Significant  human  rights  problems  in  Egypt  include  excessive  use  of  force  by
security  forces;  deficiencies  in  due  process;  and  the  suppression  of  civil  liberties,
including  societal  and  government  restrictions  on  freedoms  of  expression  and  the
press, and the freedoms of peaceful assembly and association. Political protests occur
without warning in Egypt. Demonstrations have led to frequent violent clashes between
police and protestors, resulting in deaths, injuries, and property damage.

second  works  in  information  technology  for  an  insurance  company;  the  third  is  an
assistant professor; and the fourth one is unemployed. He sees them when he travels to
China  to  visit  his  parents,  and  he  saw  three  of  them  during  his  August  2018  trip.  In
addition,  Applicant  has  known  three  to  four  other  such  friends  since  high  school  and
college. One works for a bank; two are professors at a local college; and the fourth is a
nurse  at  a  local  hospital.  He  also  saw  these  friends  when  he  visited  China  in  August
2018.9

Applicant’s home was valued at $560,000 as of the date  of the hearing. He and
his  wife’s  checking,  savings,  and  retirement  accounts  in  the  United  States  total
approximately  $1,000,000.  They  do  not  have  any  foreign  assets.  His  July  2016
background  interview  reflects  that  he  told  the  investigator  that  he  is  loyal  solely  to  the
United States. He testified that he is proud to be an American.10
China
The  National  Counterintelligence  Executive  has  identified  China  as  among  the
most  aggressive  collectors  of  U.S.  economic  information  and  technology.  China’s
intelligence services, as well as private companies and other entities, frequently seek to
exploit  Chinese  citizens  or persons  with family  ties  to  China  who  can  use  their  insider
access to corporate networks to steal secrets using removable media devices or email.
Chinese attempts to collect U.S. economic and technological information will continue at
a high level and will represent a growing threat to U.S. economic security. The nature of
the  cyber  threat  will  evolve  with  continuing  technological  advances  in  the  global
information environment. China’s military modernization is targeting capabilities with the
potential to degrade core U.S. military-technological advances.
China  is  an  authoritarian  state  in  which  the  Chinese  Communist  Party  is  the
paramount  authority,  with  its  members holding  almost  all  top  government  and  security
apparatus  positions.  Humans  rights  concerns  observed  in  2017  included  arbitrary  or
unlawful  deprivation  of  life;  executions  without  due  process;  forced  disappearances;
torture  and  coerced  confessions  of  prisoners;  arbitrary  detention;  illegal  detention  at
unofficial  holding  facilities;  significant  restrictions  on  freedom  of  speech,  press,
assembly,  religion,  and movement.  Authorities  continued  to maintain  ultimate authority
over all published, online, and broadcast material.
The  U.S.  Department  of  State  warns  visitors  to  China  that  they  may  be  placed
under surveillance. Hotel rooms, offices, cars, taxis, telephones, internet usage, and fax
machines may  be  monitored onsite  or remotely.  Personal possessions  in hotel rooms,
including computers, may be searched without knowledge or consent.

"The SOR alleges  under Guideline B that Applicant’s  brother-in-law is a resident
citizen of Kyrgyzstan employed by the Kyrgyz government (SOR ¶ 1.a); that Applicant’s
spouse (SOR ¶ 1.b) and daughter-in-law (SOR ¶ 1.c) are Kyrgyz citizens; that Applicant’s
father-in-law is a resident citizen of Kyrgyzstan (SOR ¶ 1.d); and that Applicant’s spouse
owns  an  apartment  in  Kyrgyzstan  valued  at  approximately  $45,000  (SOR  ¶  1.e.).  In  a
detailed response to the SOR, Applicant indicated that with a change in leadership in the
Kyrgyz Republic following October 2017 elections, his brother-in-law has been removed
from  his  government  position,  and  his  employment  status  was  unclear.  Applicant
explained that his immediate family had no direct contact with him and so learned about
his  status  from  extended  family  members.  Applicant  admitted  that  his  spouse  and
stepdaughter had Kyrgyz citizenship, but his spouse’s U.S. citizenship test was scheduled
for May 30, 2018. His stepdaughter was employed in the United States and planned to
apply for her U.S. citizenship at her earliest opportunity next year. Applicant admitted his
father-in-law’s residency and citizenship in Kyrgyzstan. Regarding the apartment in the
Kyrgyz Republic, Applicant explained that his spouse sold the apartment in June 2017
after his stepdaughter graduated from college in Kyrgyzstan.
After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
1  The  country  is  formally  known  as  the  Kyrgyz  Republic,  although  the  country  is  often  referred  to  as
Kyrgyzstan. The U.S. government uses the terms interchangeably when referring to the country.
Applicant is a 56-year-old global security specialist, who has worked for his current
employer,  a  defense  contractor,  since  December  2016.  (GE  1;  Tr.  48.)  He  attended
college  on  a  Reserve  Officer  Training  Corps  (ROTC)  scholarship,  and  earned  a
bachelor’s degree in aerospace engineering. He entered on active duty in the U.S. military
in April 1984. (GE 1.) He held a DOD security clearance throughout his active duty service
and  worked  on  several  classified  programs.  (Tr.  26-27,  44.)  Applicant  married  in
December 1986, but he and his first wife divorced in August 1988. (GE 1; Tr. 49.)
In April 1990, Applicant was granted an honorable discharge from active duty, and
his clearance eligibility lapsed for about a year. (Tr. 47.) In February 1991, Applicant and
his second wife married, and they had a son in March 1993. (GE 1.) From April 1993 to
August 2004, Applicant worked as a civilian contractor with a clearance at a U.S. military
research laboratory. After being in the inactive reserve for six years, he returned to the
military as an active reservist in 1996. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 27, 47.)
From  August  2004  to  December  2005,  Applicant  was  employed  as  a  program
director for a federal contractor at a space center. In January 2006, he began teaching at
a  public  university  as  a  state  employee.  (GE  1.)  He  continued  to  maintain  security
clearance eligibility for his duties in his military reserve unit, and he was called to active
duty during the summers. From June 2006 to September 2006, he was stationed in the
Kyrgyz  Republic  as an  active-duty  reservist.  Applicant  became friends  with  his current
wife, a native Kyrgyz resident citizen who worked as a contractor at the base’s exchange.
(Tr. 51.) Applicant was stationed in the United States during the summer of 2007, and
was deployed to Tajikistan in the summer of 2008. (GE 2; Tr. 45-46.)
In  June  2009,  Applicant  left  his  job  as  a  university  lecturer.  He  was  recalled  to
active duty that summer and served in Europe. He and his current spouse began dating
in July 2009. (Tr. 43, 51.) From November 2009 to May 2012, he was stationed in the
Kyrgyz Republic as an active duty reservist for the U.S. military at the rank of lieutenant
colonel.  Applicant  and  his  current  spouse  continued  dating.  In  December  2010,
Applicant’s divorce from his second wife was finalized. (GEs 1-2.)
In March 2011, Applicant and his current spouse married in the Kyrgyz Republic.
(GE 1; Tr. 52.) She had been previously married against her will, and had two children,
including a daughter born in June 1995 who took Applicant’s surname on her mother’s
marriage to Applicant.2 (GE 1; AE G.) Applicant met his spouse’s family members while
he was stationed in Kyrgyzstan, and he asserts that he reported his foreign marriage and
contacts as required to his command. (Tr. 27.)
2 Applicant’s spouse provided a statement in which she indicated that she was kidnapped and forced to
marry. (AE G.) Applicant testified that his spouse was kidnapped when she was 19 or 20 (Tr. 81), although
according to his SF 86 (GE 1), she retained the same name from her birth in January 1975 until January
2006, when she was 30 years old. She indicated that after she left her first husband, she was forced out of
her brother’s apartment when she had no income and two children to support. (AE G.) Applicant listed only
his stepdaughter on his SF 86 (GE 1) and little to nothing is known about his spouse’s other child, including
whether he or she is even alive.
Applicant  maintained  a  legal  permanent  residence  in  the  United  States,  and  he
and his spouse had a son born in the United States in October 2011 and baptized in the
United States in early June 2012. (GEs 1-2; AE I.) After his active duty deployment ended
in  May  2012, Applicant  resumed his weekend  reservist  status  until  he  retired from  the
military as a colonel in May 2014. (Tr. 46.)
In  April  2012,  Applicant’s  spouse  purchased  an  apartment  in  Kyrgyzstan  for
approximately $45,000 so that her daughter (then age 16) would have a place to live while
in  college  in  the  country.  (GEs  1-2;  Tr.  34,  58.)  In  early  June  2012,  Applicant  began
working  under  a  personal  services  contract  as  a  member  of  the  administrative  and
technical staff at a U.S. Embassy in Eastern Europe. Available records show that his DOD
secret  clearance  was  transferred  to  his  new  position  through  reciprocity  and  that  his
spouse, his son from his second marriage, his young son from his current marriage, and
his stepdaughter were authorized to accompany him to his post in foreign country X. (AE
J.) Applicant testified that his family accompanied him to live on the embassy compound.3
(Tr. 27.) In August 2013, Applicant and his spouse had another son, who was born in the
United States. (GE 1.)
Applicant’s stepdaughter finished high school in foreign country X and enrolled in
engineering studies at a technical school. In the summer of 2013, she transferred to a
university in the Kyrgyz Republic that then closed. She then attended a private university
in  Kyrgyzstan  that  was  started  with  the  financial  assistance  of  a  U.S.  philanthropist.
Classes were in English and Russian. (AE A; Tr. 52, 55-56, 79.)
While  working  at  the  U.S.  Embassy  in  foreign  country  X,  Applicant  started  the
process for his spouse and stepdaughter to legally immigrate to the United States. His
spouse and stepdaughter became legal permanent residents in October 2014. (Tr. 28.)
In  September  2015,  Applicant’s  contract  with  the  U.S.  government  ended.
Applicant and his immediate family returned to the United States, and in November 2015,
they moved into a condominium in the United States owned by his parents.  (GE 1; Tr.
28.) As of March 2016, Applicant had a job offer with a defense contractor (not his current
employer)  contingent  on  renewal  of  his  security  clearance  eligibility.  (Tr.  28.)  He
completed and certified to the accuracy of a Questionnaire for National Security Positions
(SF 86) on March 28, 2016. He disclosed the Kyrgyz citizenship of his spouse and his
stepdaughter; his stepdaughter’s attendance at a university in Kyrgyzstan; and his father-
in-law’s Kyrgyz residency and citizenship. His mother-in-law was deceased. He indicated
that he had weekly contact with his stepdaughter and annual in-person contact with his
father-in-law,  who  is  a  retired.  In  response  to  any  inquiry  concerning  foreign  contacts,
Applicant listed a brother-in-law, who works for a Kyrgyz police unit, with whom he had
quarterly contact. In response to foreign government contacts, Applicant listed another
brother-in-law (brother-in-law X) who has intelligence duties for the Kyrgyz government.
They met occasionally at family events until as recently as October 2015. Applicant added
3 Applicant discrepantly told an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator in August 2016 that
his family resided at his U.S. home of record while he was working abroad and that he visited them when
on leave between October 2011 and September 2015. (GE 2.)
that he had reported the contacts to security personnel, but was advised “to report only if
discussions stray from family activities,” which had not occurred. Applicant also disclosed
that  his  spouse  owned  an  apartment  in  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  that  she  purchased  for
$45,000 in April 2012 after selling her previous home acquired in April 2006. Applicant
listed travel to Kyrgyzstan in August 2008 for tourism, in March 2014 to visit family and
friends,  and  in  July  2015  and  again  from  September  2015  to  October  2015  for  family
reunions. He indicated that brother-in-law X attended the family reunions. (GE 1.)
On August 2, 2016, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the
OPM. Applicant related that his stepdaughter returns each year to Kyrgyzstan for college
and that they have monthly contact when she is in Kyrgyzstan. Applicant denied any legal
involvement in the purchase of his spouse’s apartment in Kyrgyzstan, which had declined
in value to approximately $35,000. He explained that the property would be sold when his
stepdaughter graduates from college, Applicant was unable to provide information about
his father-in-law’s residence or previous employments. As for his relationship to brother-
in-law X, Applicant indicated that he had only incidental social contact with him in July
2015 and October 2015 while visiting his spouse’s family, and that their conversations
were  limited  to  family  matters.  Applicant  denied  any  vulnerability  to  foreign  influence
because  of  this family  relationship  and  stated  that  he  would  immediately  notify  proper
authorities  of  any  contacts,  requests,  or  threats  by  foreign  persons  or  organizations.
Applicant  denied  any  improper  contact  or  pressure  by  anyone  seeking  classified  or
sensitive information during any of his foreign travels, including to the Kyrgyz Republic.
(GE 2.)
In March 2016, Applicant’s spouse changed her first name to an English name so
that her two young sons would not have to explain why their mother had a foreign name.
(GE  1;  AE  G;  Tr.  28,  82.)  In  December  2016,  with  his  background  investigation  still
pending  to  renew  his  clearance  to  work  for  another  defense  contractor,  Applicant
accepted a position with his current employer that did not require a security clearance.
He withdrew his application to renew his security clearance on receipt of an SOR alleging
foreign influence security concerns. (Tr. 28-29, 48.)
In  early  June  2017,  Applicant’s  stepdaughter  earned  her  bachelor’s  degree  in
business from the university in the Kyrgyz Republic and returned to the United States.
(AE B; Tr. 56.) Two weeks later, Applicant’s spouse sold her apartment in Kyrgyzstan,
and sales proceeds of $35,435 were wired into Applicant’s checking account in the United
States. (AE D; Tr. 35, 59.) In July 2017, they used $30,632 of the funds as the down-
payment for Applicant and his spouse’s current residence. (AE E; Tr. 37, 58-59.) They
bought their home for $515,000 in part with a mortgage loan of $496,588. (AE C; Tr. 59.)
About a year into his current employment, Applicant’s employer requested that he
obtain a security clearance for some military programs. On April 4, 2018, the DOD CAF
issued a SOR alleging foreign influence security concerns because of Applicant’s familial
connections  to  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  and  his  spouse’s  apartment,  which  she  no  longer
owned. (Tr. 29.)
Applicant’s spouse was interviewed for her U.S. naturalization in late May 2018.
(AE A.) She took the oath of naturalization in June 2018, and within days she obtained
her U.S. passport. (AEs G; H; Tr. 53.)  Applicant’s spouse asserts that her loyalty is “first
and foremost to America and [her] American family.” Although she and all of her siblings
graduated from  college  or took  some  advance  coursework in  the Kyrgyz  Republic  (Tr.
84), Applicant’s spouse asserts that she came from a traditional family that did not treat
daughters well. She was not allowed to return home after she was forced to marry, and
after she left her ex-husband, her brother (brother-in-law X) forced her from his apartment
when she had no income and two children to support. Her family would not take her in,
and she asserts that it “hardened [her] to the reality of Kyrgyz tradition.” (AE G.)
Applicant’s  stepdaughter  also  maintains  that  her  full  loyalty  is  to  her  American
family. She considers Applicant to be her father. She has no desire to return to the Kyrgyz
Republic and intends to become a U.S. citizen when she is first eligible in October 2019.
She  lives  with  Applicant  and  her  mother,  has  a  full-time  job  as  a  health  service
coordinator, and pays taxes to the United States. Although she wishes her mother’s family
in Kyrgyzstan no harm, they did not treat her or her mother well. (AE F.)
Since May 2012, when he closed a bank account that he had previously held while
serving in the Kyrgyz Republic, Applicant’s ties to Kyrgyzstan have been solely familial
through  his  spouse.  In  addition  to  his  father-in-law,  six  of  his  spouse’s  siblings  (four
brothers and two sisters) live in the Kyrgyz Republic and speak Russian, which is still the
business  language  in  the  region.  At  least  five  if  not  all  six  of  the  siblings  has  Kyrgyz
citizenship.4 (Tr. 72-73, 80.) Applicant’s spouse and perhaps all but one of her siblings
attended college, although all of them had some type of advanced schooling.5 (Tr. 84-
85.)
Applicant’s father-in-law in Kyrgyzstan is now 80 years old and retired. Applicant
denies knowing about his father-in-law’s previous occupation. He never asked his father-
4 Four of the seven foreign contacts on Applicant’s SF 86 are native Kyrgyz citizens. Applicant did not clearly
describe his relationship with them apart from the brother-in-law, who had worked as a fraud investigator.
The foreign contacts include a 39-year-old  working  in  Dubai  who has the same surname as Applicant’s
father-in-law; a 36-year-old married homemaker living in Australia; and a 32-year-old housekeeper (formerly
an economics teacher) living in Kyrgyzstan. They may be siblings of Applicant’s spouse, given they were
all  born  in  the  same  city  as  his  spouse.  (GE  1.)  Whether  due  to  lack  of  contact  with  them  or  limited
knowledge, Applicant has not fully disclosed the extent of his spouse’s family ties to Kyrgyzstan.
5 Applicant testified, “I know the family emphasized everyone going to college.” (Tr. 84.) When confronted
about the inconsistency between his spouse’s account that she came from such a traditional household
that  she  was  forced  to  marry  (bride  kidnapping)  and  the  family’s  emphasis  on  college  for  even  the
daughters, Applicant responded:
The youngest [daughter] was the favorite, and so she went [to college]. The oldest one, I
think it had to do with the Soviet system, the two older ones. I mean the Soviet system
was—it was, they grew up—I don’t remember when the Soviet Union fell, but they went
during the Soviet system, and so it was part of the process. And then my wife, she actually
had to fight to go [to college]. She went, but had to really convince a brother to help her
pay for school. (Tr. 85.)
in-law  whether  he  ever  had  any  affiliation  with  the  Kyrgyz  military  or  government.
Applicant’s spouse calls her father once a month. To Applicant’s knowledge, she has not
told her father that he is applying for a security clearance. (Tr. 61-62.) Applicant indicated
on his SF 86 that he had in-person contact with his father-in-law annually between June
2010 and October 2015 (GE 1), although he now asserts that he probably saw his father-
in-law during his trips  to Kyrgyzstan.  His spouse usually traveled to Kyrgyzstan before
him so she could stay longer to visit her relatives, including her father. (Tr. 63.) Applicant’s
father-in-law  speaks  both  the  Kyrgyz  and  Russian  languages  but  not  English.  Their
conversations  were  limited because  of the  language  barrier. When  they  occurred  they
were in Russian because Applicant speaks a little Russian. (Tr. 37.)
Applicant testified that he has heard that his spouse’s brother in Kyrgyzstan, who
had worked in fraud investigations, is no longer so employed. He denies knowing about
this  brother-in-law’s  current  occupation.  His  spouse  has  contact  with  this  brother  on  a
monthly basis. Applicant believes this brother-in-law does not know that he has applied
for a security clearance. (Tr. 71-72.)
Regarding brother-in-law X, Applicant understands that he spent his entire career
after college with the Kyrgyz government. Although Applicant indicated in response to the
SOR  that  this  brother-in-law  had  been  removed  from  his  position  with  the  change  in
government in the country following the October 2017 elections, he testified there is no
way of knowing for certain. Applicant had heard from his spouse through her sister that
his brother-in-law  moved  to  another city  after the  change  in administration.  (Tr. 64-65,
78.) Applicant had in-person contact with this brother-in-law at family functions, about two
or three times total when Applicant lived in Kyrgyzstan, and during his trips to the country
in 2014 and 2015. This brother-in-law does not speak English, so Applicant relied on his
wife, his stepdaughter, or one of his wife’s sisters to interpret. This brother-in-law knows
that Applicant was in the U.S. military and also that he had worked  in a U.S. embassy.
Applicant does not believe that his stepdaughter had any contact with brother-in-law X
while she was attending college in Kyrgyzstan because brother-in-law X is “estranged to
our family.” After his spouse left her previous husband, she lived in an apartment owned
by brother-in-law X, and he threw her out when she had two young children to support
and  no  income.  As  the  senior  member  of  Applicant’s  spouse’s  siblings,  he  wanted  to
direct  her  life.  (Tr.  67-68,  75.)  Applicant  believes  his  spouse  had  no  current
correspondence  with  this  brother.  Applicant  has  told  his  spouse  that  her  brother’s
occupation could impact his clearance. (Tr. 79.)
As for any other family members or friends in the Kyrgyz Republic with whom his
spouse maintains contact more often than every few years, Applicant responded that his
spouse “might contact her older sister.” (Tr. 72.) As to whether Applicant had in-person
contact  with  his  spouse’s  siblings  during  the  family  gatherings  in  Kyrgyzstan,  he
responded that he saw some of them (“I mean, it’s a hit or miss kind of thing. It depends
on what the gathering is or where it is.”). (Tr. 73.)
Applicant asserts that he would immediately report if he was approached for any
classified or sensitive information. He has discussed with his spouse that he would have
to report if someone attempted to use her family in Kyrgyzstan because he does not want
to risk jeopardizing their sons and daughter’s future. (Tr. 69-70.) Applicant and his spouse
intend  to  raise  their  sons  in  the  United  States.  They  plan  to  have  their  younger  son
baptized in the United States. (AE G.)
As of November 2018, Applicant’s spouse did not work outside the home. She had
worked in retail in the United States for one year. (Tr. 54.) Applicant’s annual salary with
a defense contractor was $124,000 although it was soon to be increased to $138,000.
(Tr. 48.) In addition to the $65,000 in equity in their home, Applicant had $60,000 in 401(k)
assets and $15,000 in combined checking and savings deposits. (Tr. 59-60.)
Administrative Notice
The Kyrgyz Republic (or Kyrgyzstan) is a landlocked, mountainous Central Asian
country that became a Soviet republic in 1936. It achieved independence on August 31,
1991, when the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics dissolved. Predominantly rural and
Muslim, the country has a population of 5.8 million, of which 73.2% are native Kyrgyz. A
parliamentary  republic,  it  is  governed  by  an  elected  president  as  head  of  state;  by  an
appointed prime minister as head of the government; and by a Supreme Council of 120
seats. The president holds substantial powers even though the prime minister oversees
the Kyrgyz government and selects most cabinet members. The president represents the
country  internationally  and  can  sign  or  veto  laws,  call for new  elections, and  nominate
Supreme  Court judges,  cabinet members for posts  related  to  security  or defense,  and
numerous other high-level positions.
Nationwide  protests  because  of  violations  in  parliamentary  elections  led  to  the
overthrow of the country’s first president in March 2005. Under a new president elected
in July 2005, the Kyrgyz Republic made tangible progress towards meeting international
standards. The country’s human rights record improved considerably, although limitations
on  due  process  and  other  human  rights  problems  persisted.  Following  a  week  of
opposition-led  street  protests, the  country  adopted  a  new  constitution  on  November 9,
2006,  which  provided  for  greater  checks  and  balances  among  the  branches  of
government.  On  December  30,  2006,  the  parliament  adopted  a  revised  version  of  the
constitution that restored many powers to the president but also a greater role for political
parties.
On April 7, 2010, the Kyrgyz Republic had a violent change of government and
approved a new constitution and a temporary president in a June 27 national referendum.
October  10,  2010  parliamentary  elections  were  generally  free  and  fair,  and  Almazbek
Atambaev was sworn in as president in 2011. On October 15, 2017, former prime minister
and  ruling  Social-Democratic  Party  of  Kyrgyzstan  member  Sooronbai  Jeenbekov  was
elected to succeed outgoing president Atambaev, who became the first Kyrgyz president
to step down after serving one full six-year term as required in the country’s constitution.
Kyrgyzstan's 2017 presidential election marked the first peaceful transfer of presidential
power from one democratically-elected president to another in post-Soviet Central Asia.
It  was  the  most  competitive  in  the  country’s  history,  although  international  and  local
election  observers  noted  cases  of  vote  buying  and  misuse  of  public  resources.  Prime
minister Abyl-Gaziev took office on April 20, 2018
Following  independence,  Kyrgyzstan  rapidly  implemented  market  reforms,  such
as improving the regulatory system and instituting land reform. In 1998, Kyrgyzstan was
the  first  Commonwealth  of  Independent  States  country  to  be  accepted  into  the  World
Trade Organization. The government has privatized much of its ownership shares
in  public  enterprises.  Significant  impediments  to  Kyrgyzstan's  development  include
endemic corruption, aging infrastructure, high unemployment, and endemic poverty.
The  United  States  established  diplomatic  relations  with  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  on
December 25, 1991, following  the  country’s  independence from  the  Soviet  Union. The
United States supports the Kyrgyz Republic in its development of an inclusive democracy
based upon the rule of law and respect for human rights. U.S. Government assistance
goals  in  Kyrgyzstan  are  to  strengthen  democratic  institutions,  support  broad-based
economic  opportunity,  enhance  regional  security,  promote  greater  respect  for  human
rights and the rule of law, and address development challenges in health and education.
The Kyrgyz Republic and the United States belong to a number of the same international
the  United  Nations,  Euro-Atlantic  Partnership  Council,
organizations,
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, International Monetary Fund, World
Bank, and World Trade Organization. Kyrgyzstan also is a participant in the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization's (NATO) Partnership for Peace program. The Kyrgyz Republic and
the United States have a bilateral trade agreement. The Kyrgyz Republic also signed a
trade  and  investment  framework  agreement  with  the  United  States  and  other  Central
Asian countries establishing a regional forum for addressing trade issues and enhancing
trade and investment between the United States and Central Asia.

At the same time, Manas Air Base in the Kyrgyz Republic, which had served as a
transit and logistics base for U.S. troops heading to Afghanistan, was turned over to the
Kyrgyz military in June 2014 after Kyrgyz’s parliament passed legislation to end the U.S.’
lease on the base. As of February 2018, the U.S. Defense Department was concerned
about  Russian  influence  in  Central  Asia  and  the  Kyrgyz  Republic’s  increasing  alliance
with Russia and China.6
6 Pursuant to my obligation to take administrative notice of the most current political conditions in evaluating
Guideline B concerns (see ISCR Case No. 05-11292 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007)), I note that at a hearing
before the U.S. House Armed Services Committee held on February 27, 2018, the Commander of the U.S.
Central Command stated, in part:
The  Kyrgyz  Republic  has  increasingly  aligned  its  interests  with  Russia  and  China.  The
U.S.-Kyrgyz  security  relationship  has  declined  since  the  closure  of  the  Manas  Transit
Center  and  the  termination  of  the  bilateral  Defense  Cooperation  Agreement  in  2014.
Despite  the  Kyrgyz  armed  forces’  desire  to  improve  military-to-military  cooperation  with
CENTCOM, Kyrgyz senior civilian leaders have shown little interest in improving military
relations.
See www.centcom.mil/ABOUT--US/POSTURE--STATEMENT/
The  Kyrgyz  Republic  benefits  from  a  robust  civil  society,  and  the  government
generally respects laws providing for the freedoms of peaceful assembly and association,
internal movement, foreign travel, and emigration and repatriation. Continuing concerns
for the country include the trajectory of democratization; endemic corruption; a history of
tense, at times violent, inter-ethnic relations; border security vulnerabilities; and potential
terrorist threats.
Ethnic,  political,  and  socio-economic tensions  continue  to  simmer  in  the  Kyrgyz
Republic.  During  2016,  Kyrgyzstan  remained  vulnerable  to  transnational  threats,
especially in the remote south. The U.S. Embassy reviews travel of Embassy employees
to  Batken  Oblast  because  ill-defined  and  porous  borders  allow  for  the  relatively  free
movement  of  people  and  illicit  goods,  rendering  the  region  vulnerable  to  transnational
threats and could facilitate the establishment of terrorist safe havens. Rugged terrain and
a lack of resources prevent authorities from adequately controlling the borders. Lack of
economic  opportunity  was  identified  as  a  significant  driver  of  violent  extremism  in  the
country, which forces a large portion of the population to seek employment opportunities
in Russia, where they are particularly susceptible to recruitment.
On  August  30,  2016  a  vehicle-borne  explosive  device  was  detonated  at  the
Chinese  Embassy  located  less  than  300  meters  from  the  U.S.  Embassy  in  Bishkek,
Kyrgyzstan’s capital city. Kyrgyz police located and detonated several explosive devices
near  downtown  Bishkek  in  September  2016  and  have  since  made  several  terrorism-
related  arrests  throughout  the  Kyrgyz  Republic.  Areas  along  the  Kyrgyz-Uzbek  and
Kyrgyz-Tajik  borders  continue  to  have  small,  but  sometimes  violent  and  deadly,
skirmishes between border guards on both sides, which have affected civilians. These
skirmishes often result from land use disputes. Organized crime related to smuggling and
narcotics trafficking are widespread in the southern corridors of the Kyrgyz Republic. Due
to  the  exit  of  Coalition  Forces  from  Afghanistan  in  2014,  the  Kyrgyz  government  is
concerned  that  terrorist  and  extremist  groups  may  move  north  into  Tajikistan  and
Kyrgyzstan.
As  of  March  2018,  the  U.S.  State  Department’s  Bureau  of  Diplomatic  Security
assessed  Bishkek  as  a  high-threat  location  for  crime  and  political  violence  and  as  a
medium-threat location for terrorist activity directed at or affecting official U.S. government
interests. U.S. citizens visiting the country have been robbed by groups of young men
who followed them back to their residences from hotels and bars. In addition, U.S. citizens
have been victims of rape, assault, sexual harassment and kidnapping. Attackers do not
always avoid violent confrontation with their victims. Harassment and extortion by people
who  purport  to  be  Kyrgyz  police  officers  has  happened  in  local  markets  and  in  areas
frequented by Westerners. Even so, the State Department’s travel advisory to the Kyrgyz
Republic as of April 24, 2018, was Level I: Exercise Normal Precautions.
Significant human rights issues persisted in the Kyrgyz Republic in 2017 involving
law  enforcement  and  security  services  officers’  use  of  torture  and  arbitrary  arrest;
increasing  pressure  on  independent  media;  harassment  of  journalists;  selective  and
politically motivated prosecutions; pervasive corruption; forced labor; and attacks, threats,
10
and  systematic  police-driven  extortion  of  sexual  and  ethnic  minority  groups.  Official
impunity was a significant problem. While authorities investigated reports of official abuse
in  the  security  services  and  elsewhere,  they  rarely  prosecuted  and  punished  officials
accused of human rights violations, or complicity in trafficking. While the law provides for
an independent judiciary, judges were subject to influence or corruption. Throughout the
year there were multiple instances where the conduct and outcomes of trials appeared
predetermined. Numerous sources, including non-governmental organizations (NGOs),
attorneys, government officials, and private citizens, asserted judges paid bribes to attain
their positions. Many attorneys asserted that bribe taking was ubiquitous among judges.
Authorities  generally  respected  court  orders.  Numerous  NGOs  described  pervasive
violations of the right to a fair trial, including coerced confessions, use of torture, denial of
access to counsel, and convictions in the absence of sufficiently conclusive evidence or
despite  exculpatory  evidence.  International  observers  reported  threats  and  acts  of
violence against defendants and defense attorneys within and outside the courtroom, as
well  as  intimidation  of  trial  judges  by  victims’  relatives  and  friends.  Law  enforcement
officers,  particularly  in  the  southern  part  of  the  country,  frequently  employed  arbitrary
arrest,  torture,  and  the  threat  of  criminal  prosecution  as  a  means  of  extorting  cash
payments from citizens.
Kyrgyz law provides for freedom of expression, including for members of the press,
and citizens generally were free to exercise these rights. NGO leaders and media rights
advocates,  however,  asserted  the  situation  worsened  during  the  year,  highlighting  the
increase in libel lawsuits against independent media outlets and journalists and forced
closure of news agencies. Self-censorship was prevalent, and some journalists reported
pressure from editors and political figures to bias their reporting on sensitive topics. Some
journalists  reported  intimidation  related  to  coverage  of  sensitive  topics,  such  as  inter-
ethnic  relations,  “religious  extremism,”  or  the  rise  of  nationalism.  In  recent  years  there
were attempts to proscribe independent media from operating freely in the country. Tight
government  controls  over  news  content  on  state  television  was  widely  acknowledged.
Media  rights  advocates  noted  increasing  pressure  on  media  outlets  in  advance  of  the
2017 October presidential election. The Kyrgyz government failed to enforce laws against
rape effectively, and rape cases were underreported. Police generally regarded spousal
rape  as  an  administrative,  rather  than  a  criminal,  offense.  While  the  law  specifically
prohibits  domestic  violence  and  spousal  abuse,  violence  against  women  and  girls
remained a significant yet underreported problem.
The  CSCE  estimated  in  August  2017  that  12,000  young  women  in  the  Kyrgyz
Republic are kidnapped and forced to marry their abductors. Although illegal since 1994,
“bride kidnapping” is socially accepted as a Kyrgyz tradition and is often justified by the
perpetrator on that basis. According to the CSCE, in Kyrgyz society, particularly in the
rural areas, an unmarried woman’s reputation can be irrevocably damaged if she spends
even a single night outside her family home so she may feel she has no recourse other
than to consent to the marriage. The CSCE attributes the practice to Kyrgyz assertion of
ethnicity and tradition as a way to distance themselves from their Soviet past and affirm
the country’s independent identity (ethic nationalism). As a participating state of the Office
of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Kyrgyz Republic is a party to several
11
OSCE commitments to gender equality and is making efforts to end the practice of bride
kidnapping. In 2013, the penalty for bride kidnapping was increased from three to seven
years in prison. In 2016, a new law was enacted against underage marriages and forced
marriages  that  holds  accountable  those  who  perform  them  and  the  relatives  who
participate in organizing them.

"Applicant  is  a  44-year-old  mechanic  with  a  pending  employment  offer  with  a
defense contractor. He has been employed as a mechanic for another company since
2015,  and  has  a  history  of  civilian  jobs  overseas  for  U.S.  defense  contractors  in  Iraq,
Afghanistan,  Kuwait,  Syria,  and  Germany.  Applicant  was  born  in  South  Korea  and
adopted by U.S. citizens in 1980 when he was a child. He naturalized as a U.S. citizen in
1984. He did not graduate from high school, but received a general education diploma
(GED) in 1997. He married a U.S. military member in 2000 and worked as a contractor in
Germany during his spouse’s assignment there. They divorced in 2009, and he has two
children from that marriage.
Applicant remarried in October 2010, to a Chinese citizen while he was living in
China. They returned to the United States in February 2014, when his spouse became a
permanent resident of the United States. His spouse naturalized as a U.S. citizen in March
2018.  They  have  three  children,  all  U.S.  citizens.  Applicant  has  never  served  in  the
military, but he reported that as a civilian contractor, he held a DOD security clearance in
or about June 2009, and an interim clearance in 2015 that has been withdrawn.
The SOR alleges under Guideline B that Applicant’s spouse is a citizen of China,
and his mother-in-law is a citizen and resident of China. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-b)
Under Guideline E, the SOR alleges Applicant failed to disclose on a 2015 SCA,
three jobs held from 2014 to 2015, and being fired from a job in August 2015. (SOR ¶¶
2.a-d) Additionally, the SOR alleges Applicant failed to disclose on the 2015 SCA that he
was charged with possession and distribution of marijuana at a U.S. military base in 2002
(SOR ¶ 2.e); charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI) in 2004 and 2007 while living
in Germany (SOR ¶¶ 2.f-g); failing to report being delinquent in child-support obligations
(SOR ¶ 2.h), cross-alleged in SOR ¶ 3.c; and failing to report delinquent debts (SOR ¶
2.i), cross-alleged in SOR ¶¶ 3.a-c, including child-support obligations.
The SOR also alleges under Guideline E that Applicant failed to disclose on his
2009 SCA the 2002 charge of distribution and possession of marijuana at a U.S. military
installation, and the 2004 and 2007 alcohol-related charges while in Germany (SOR ¶¶
2.j-l); and failing to disclose intervention by law enforcement because of his use of alcohol,
and a referral to alcohol counseling or treatment from the 2004  DWI incident (SOR ¶¶
2.m).
Finally, the SOR alleges under Guideline F a delinquent medical collection account
for  $1,400;  a  charged-off  credit  account  for  $4,884;  and  a  delinquent  child-support
account for approximately $19,278 (SOR ¶¶ 3.a-c).
Generally, Applicant admitted the SOR allegations, but provided explanations and
clarifications with his Answers. He generally responded that his failure to report incidents
in his SCAs resulted from his lack of formal education and he is not computer savvy. He
claimed that he did not pay attention to the questions and received inadequate assistance
when  completing  the  SCAs.  Additionally,  Applicant  admitted  the  allegations  listed  as
amended SOR ¶¶ 2.g and 2.l. in his answer to the amended SOR.
Applicant was arrested three times, two involving alcohol and one involving drugs.
In his 2009 and 2015 SCAs, he reported that he has never been charged with an offense
involving  alcohol  or  drugs.  Applicant  discussed  these  incidents  in  his  interview  with  a
government investigator. He provided corrections, updates, or explanations to areas of
the  interview  summary  that  he  believed  needed  clarification.  These  incidents  are
discussed in further detail below.
In 2002, Applicant was arrested at a U.S. military installation for possession and
distribution of marijuana. In testimony, he claimed he used marijuana once per  day for
two  weeks  to  reduce  pain  from  a  2001  hernia  surgery.  He  smoked  it  in  the  on-post
quarters or on his back porch where he and his spouse lived, and he stored it in his kitchen
out of view of his spouse. He claimed that she never cooked, so she did not discover it in
the kitchen. The military police were dispatched to Applicant’s home because of a noise
complaint. Applicant claimed alternatively that he was using it on his back porch and on
his couch.  During  the interaction  with  military  police,  Applicant  admitted  possession  of
marijuana. He was apprehended and questioned, and he provided a sworn statement.
Law enforcement records show that Applicant was found in possession of 130.6 grams
of marijuana. The police investigation concluded there was probable cause to believe that
Applicant  distributed marijuana  by  giving  a  bag  containing  approximately  4.3  grams  to
another person, based on admissions by the other person. Applicant provided a sworn
statement admitting to possessing and distributing marijuana. The report notes the case
was  referred  to  the  area  Special  Assistant  U.S.  Attorney  (SAUSA),  who  believed  that
there was sufficient evidence to prosecute Applicant. The record is devoid of additional
information with regard to resulting actions by the SAUSA or installation authorities.
In  an  interview  with  a  government  investigator, Applicant  acknowledged  that  he
was charged with illegal drug usage. He noted in his interview that military police were
called to his home because of a noise complaint by neighbors, and that they wrote an
incident report and departed the home. In testimony, he stated that the police were called
because Applicant’s neighbor reported marijuana use. He also first claimed that he was
“not arrested, just questioned at another location.” He later admitted that he was arrested
and transported to the military police station where he provided a statement. (Tr. at 45,
87)
Applicant  stated  the  charge  was  dropped  because  he  did  not  have  to  appear
before any authority. When asked in his 2009 and 2015 SCAs whether he was “EVER
charged with an offense involving drugs,” he replied “no.” He followed this answer with a
series of inconsistent and contradictory statements. In his clearance interview, he claimed
he did not report it on his 2009 and 2015 SCAs because he forgot about it after the charge
was dropped, that it occurred more than 10 years ago, and he simply did not care (GE
10). He stated in response to interrogatories, that the SCA required him to report only
drug usage in the past seven years, and that he did care.
Applicant was arrested in Germany for driving while intoxicated (DWI) in 2004 after
he was stopped by German police and failed a breathalyzer test. He was turned over to
the U.S. military police, and released to his spouse and her military command. In 2007,
Applicant was again arrested in Germany for driving with a blood alcohol content of .067
after drinking at a club and driving. His car was impounded, and he was released to his
spouse and her military command. He stated to the investigator that he was required to
attend the Army Substance Abuse Program (ASAP) as a result of one of his arrests, and
he  said  he  attended  more  than  one  session.  However,  in  contradictory  testimony,
Applicant denied ever attending ASAP or any substance abuse evaluation or counseling.
In response to questions on his 2009 and 2015 SCAs whether he has “EVER been
charged with an offense involving alcohol or drugs,” he responded “no.” He followed this
with  inconsistent  and  contradictory  statements.  In  his  interview  with  a  government
investigator,  he  initially  denied  that  he  had  any  prior  alcohol-related  arrests.  When
reminded  by  the  investigator  of  the  need  for  candor,  he  admitted  the  two  incidents  in
Germany. In response to questions on why he had not listed them on his SCAs, he stated
he did not read the SCA instructions well, but he was adamant that he only needed to
report  alcohol-related  incidents  that  occurred  within  seven  years.  In  his  response  to
interrogatories, he acknowledged that he should have read the SCA instructions better,
but  thought  the  question  pertained  to  a  seven-year  period.  He  also  said  the  incident
occurred  a  long  time ago  and  when he  was  younger and  did not think  things  through.
However, in testimony, he claimed that he did not report the first alcohol-related arrest
because he did not think it was an arrest since he did not go to jail, and he failed to report
the second arrest because he forgot.
Applicant  worked  for  a  government  contractor  in  Iraq  for  about  eight  months  in
2008 before resigning, and in Afghanistan from approximately January 2009 until August
2009. He stated that he met a Chinese national online in August 2009. He vacationed in
China for two  weeks  in  August, and met  with  her. He  returned  to China  in  September
2010, and stayed until February 2014. While in China, Applicant married in October 2010,
traveled extensively around China, and their first child was born in China. Applicant also
held two jobs in China teaching English to Chinese students from wealthy families, from
2010 to 2014. He returned to the United States in 2014 with his Chinese-speaking spouse,
and his first-born child. His spouse did not speak English, except for what he taught her.
Applicant completed an SCA on October 6, 2015. In it, he reported that his mother-
in-law is a Chinese citizen, living in China, and he and his spouse had daily contact with
her via the Internet. He reported that his mother-in-law was retired, and her husband was
deceased. In testimony, Applicant noted that  his mother-in-law never worked in China,
and now lives with him as a U.S. permanent resident. She owns an apartment in China
that  she  is  trying  to  sell.  In  Applicant’s  interview  with  a  government  investigator  in
November 2015, he stated that he believed his mother-in-law previously worked as a bus
driver. Applicant noted that he does not speak Chinese and his mother-in-law does not
speak English, so he has had no verbal or written contact with her even when he lived in
China (GE 10).
In his 2015 SCA, Applicant reported that he and his spouse had no foreign contacts
in  the  previous  seven  years.  However,  he  testified  that  his  spouse  has  grandparents,
aunts, uncles, and cousins in China to whom his spouse communicates with about every
two weeks through a phone application. Applicant’s spouse sends items to China that a
cousin purchases about twice per year.
Applicant’s  spouse  testified,  and  stated  that she  returned  to  China  in  July  2014
and stayed for three months while her mother helped her with her pregnancy. Her mother
came to the United States in 2015 and stayed for six months. Her mother then took their
second child back to China for one year when the girl was  a year old. At another time,
she took another child, at two years old, to China and stayed for 11 months. Her mother
returned to the United States in 2016 and applied for permanent resident status in 2018.
She stated that her mother retired from selling bus tickets in China, and her father was a
police officer who died of cancer at 53 years old. Applicant’s spouse went to university in
Cyprus from 2004 to 2006 for a degree in tourism before returning home to China. After
marrying and coming to the United States with Applicant, she naturalized as a U.S. citizen
in March 2018. She stated that her Chinese passport was cancelled. She attributed her
excellent command of the English language to her spouse, who was her primary source
of instruction.
Applicant failed to report three jobs on his 2015 SCA, including a position teaching
English  to  Chinese  high-school  students  in  the  United  States,  a  position  at  a  car
dealership, and a position as a crane inspector. In addition, he failed to report that he was
fired from the crane operator job. These jobs are described below.
From August 2014 to June 2015, after returning to the United States from China,
Applicant taught English to Chinese high-school students residing in the United States.
He tutored, supervised, and transported the Chinese students to and from school, and
lived with them in a home provided by a company that provides these services to Chinese
nationals in the U.S. He described the job as mostly “babysitting” and that he did not like
it. Applicant did not list this employment on his 2015 SCA. In a summary of Applicant’s
interview, he stated that he intentionally did not list the job because it had nothing to do
with  military  contracts  and  he  “just  did  not  want  to  list  it”  (GE  10).  In  his  response  to
interrogatories, he stated that he did not list the job because it was not relevant since it
had  nothing  to  do  with  military  contracts  and  that  he  was  paid  as  an  independent
contractor. Applicant’s former employer reported that Applicant left the job voluntarily but
the employment was not entirely favorable. His supervisor noted that Applicant was “not
well educated” to be an English teacher, but he worked hard and was responsible (GE
5).
Two  other  jobs  were  also  not  disclosed  on  his  SCA,  including  a  three-month
position at  a  car dealership,  and  a  three-month  position as  a  crane  inspector.  He  was
fired from this job due to a safety violation (GE 6). In a summary of Applicant’s government
interview, he stated that he did not disclose the crane inspector job and subsequent firing
because he “hoped [he] would get away with it” and not get caught. In his response to
interrogatories,  he  claimed  that  he  was  upset  and  embarrassed  about  the  situation
because it was really an episode of racial discrimination against him, rather than a safety
violation,  and  that  listing  temporary  positions,  less  than  six  months,  were  not  relevant
because they had nothing to do with military contracts (GE 10). In testimony, he claimed
he did not report the missing jobs because he was not at them long enough to list them,
and he did not list being fired from the crane inspector job because of false statements
about him. He described the jobs as “stepping-stone” jobs that he believed did not have
to be listed on his SCA when  held for less than six months. Of note,  in contrast to his
testimony and interrogatory response, he did list a five-month teacher job in China and a
five-month mechanics job on his 2015 SCA (GE 1).
Applicant was delinquent on three debts, including child-support obligations that
he did not report on his 2015 SCA. A medical debt for $1,400 was incurred in 2014 and
he  testified  was  paid  in  2015  (SOR  ¶  3.a).  Rather,  documentation  submitted  with  his
Answer to the SOR show that it was paid in 2017.
A credit card debt was charged off for $4,884 (SOR ¶ 3.b) after Applicant “forgot
to pay.” He first claimed it was paid off in 2015, but later testified that it was not paid until
2016. Rather, documentation submitted with his Answer to the SOR show that it was paid
in 2017.
A debt on a child-support account for $19,278 was past due (SOR ¶ 3.c). Applicant
stopped paying his child support in 2011 while living in China, and stated to a government
investigator that he did not pay the court-ordered support because he was angry at his
former  spouse.  He  first  testified  that  he  caught  up  on  the  arrearage  in  2015,  but  later
admitted that his pay was garnished in 2014 or 2015, but his employers did not act on the
garnishment order until 2017. As of September 2015, Applicant owed $19,112, and as of
September 2016, he owed $3,402. Per his Answer to the SOR, his arrearage was paid
off by 2017. Applicant did not report his garnishment and the child-support debt on his
2015  SCA  (SOR  ¶  2.h).  In  addition, he also failed  to  report the other listed  delinquent
debts (SOR ¶ 2.i). He testified that he failed to report the arrearage because he did not
think about it.
Applicant  submitted  several  letters  of  support,  family  photos,  and  certificates  of
training  and  performance.  His  co-workers,  supervisors,  and  friends  acknowledge  his
performance,  loyalty,  and  excellent  work  ethic.  I  found  Applicant  to  be  less  than
forthcoming in testimony, and he often gave conflicting accounts.
Law and Policies
“[N]o one has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy v. Egan,
484  U.S.  518, 528  (1988). As  Commander in  Chief,  the President  has  the  authority  to
“control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an
individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.” Id. at 527. The
President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants
eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information  “only  upon  a  finding  that  it  is  clearly
consistent with the national interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865 § 2.
National  security  eligibility  is  predicated  upon  the  applicant  meeting  the  criteria
contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.
Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies
these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative
judge’s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An
administrative  judge  must  consider  a  person’s  stability,  trustworthiness,  reliability,
discretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG ¶ 1(b).
The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with
access  to  classified  information.  This  relationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and
endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the
possible  risk  that  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard
classified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible
extrapolation  about  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified
information.
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in
no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” Exec. Or. 10865
§ 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant
has  not  met  the  strict  guidelines  the  President  and  the  Secretary  of  Defense  have
established for issuing a clearance.
Initially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the
personal or professional history  of  the applicant  that  may  disqualify  the  applicant from
being  eligible  for  access  to  classified  information.  The  Government  has  the  burden  of
establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. “Substantial
evidence” is “more than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.”  See v. Washington
Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a
nexus  or  rational  connection  between  proven  conduct  under  any  of  the  criteria  listed
therein and an applicant’s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3
(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015).
Once  the  Government  establishes  a  disqualifying  condition  by  substantial
evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the
facts. Directive ¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition,
and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No.
02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).
An applicant “has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent
with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.” ISCR Case No. 01-
20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). “[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if
they must, on the side of denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG ¶ 1(d).
Guideline E: Personal Conduct
",False
"Applicant  admitted  to  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  through  1.e,  with  some
explanation. He denied SOR allegation ¶ 1.f. After a thorough and careful review of the
pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  49-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  (GX  1  at  pages  5
and 12.) He has been employed with the defense contractor since 2010. (GX 1 at page
12.) Applicant emigrated from what is now Ukraine (formerly part of the Soviet Union),
and  became  a  U.S.  citizen  in  December  of  1991.  (GX  1  at  pages  6~7,  and  TR#2  at
page  7  lines  18~20.)    He  is  married  to  a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen  who  also  emigrated
from Ukraine. (GX 1 at pages 20~21.) Applicant has four adult children, and a 13 year-
old  son.  (GX  1  at  pages  23.)  Both  Applicant’s  father  and  an  uncle,  because  of  their
Pentecostal religious beliefs, were sent to Soviet prisons where they perished. (TR#2 at
page 8 line 18 to page 9 line 23~27.) Applicant is a “deacon” for his Pentecostal church,
as  evidenced  by  a  letter from his “Pastor.”  (AppX  C at  page  2.)  Applicant  net  worth  in
the United States is about $400,000. (TR#2 at page 40 lines 6~17.)
1.a.  and  1.d.  Applicant  brother,  who  is  married  to  a  German  national,  is  a  dual
national of Germany and Ukraine. (TR#2 at page 16 line 11 to page 17 line 10,  and at
page  17  line  25  to  page  26  line  14.) This  brother  is  a  Pentecostal  missionary,  who  at
times travels to  Russia,  but presently  resides  “in  Estonia  or Latvia.” (TR#2  at  page  26
lines  7~14.)  Since  about  2007,  Applicant  has  provided  about  $100  each  month  in
financial support for his missionary brother. (TR#2 at page 16 line 11 to page 17 line 10,
and at page 17 line 25 to page 26 line 14.) In 2013, Applicant also provided this brother
with a lump sum, one-time $5,000 gift. (Id.)
1.b.  Applicant’s  other  brother,  and  his  two  sisters,  are  citizens  and  residents  of
Ukraine.  (TR#2  at  page  26  line  15  to  page  33  line  5.)  His  brother  “is  working
construction” in Germany.  (TR#2 at page 26 line 15 to page 27 line 22.) Applicant’s two
sisters are both housewives living in the Ukraine. One is the mother of “18 kids,” and the
other  “had  11”  children.  (TR#2  at  page  26  line  15  to  page  33  line  5.)  None  of  these
siblings have any connection with the Ukrainian government.
1.c.  and  1.e.  Applicant’s  77  year-old  mother-in-law  is  a  “retired”  citizen  and
resident of the Ukraine (TR#2 at page 33 line 7 to page 35 line 12.) Since about 1994,
Applicant, through his wife, has provided about $100 each month in financial support for
his  mother-in-law.  (TR#2  at  page  17  lines  10~21.)  Applicant’s  mother-in-law  has  no
connection with the Ukrainian government.
1.f.  Applicant  admits  that  he  was  investigated  in  2015  for  possible  connections
with a Russian/Armenian criminal organization. (TR#2 at page 22 lines 4~19, at page 39
line  8  to  page  40  line  5,  and  GX  2.)  No  such  connection  was  found,  and  Applicant
denies any such connection. (Id.)
Notice
I  take  administrative  notice  of  the  following  facts:  Ukraine  is  a  republic  with  a
semi-presidential  political  system.  In  2014,  the  Ukrainian  parliament  approved  a  new
government, which caused Russia to respond by seizing Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula.
Additional  unrest  occurred  in  2014,  involving  thousands  of  pro-Russian  protesters  in
eastern  and  southern  Ukraine.  In  2015,  a  ceasefire  agreement  established  a  de  facto
dividing  line  between  Ukrainian  government-controlled  and  separatist-held  areas  in
Ukraine. (GX 5.)
",True
"Applicant  admitted  to  all  the  allegations  in  SOR,  with  explanations.  After  a
thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  testimony,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  40-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  (GX  1  at  pages  5
and  14.)  He  has  been  employed  with  the  defense  contractor  “since  November  2016.”
(TR  at  page  13  line  21  to  page  16  line  11.)  Previously  divorced  “in  2014,”  he  is  now
married to a Philippine national, and has two children from his previous marriage. (Id.)
Guideline B - Foreign Influence
1.a.  and  1.d.  Applicant’s  wife  is  a  citizen  of  the  Philippines,  but  resides  with
Applicant  in  Korea.  (TR  at  page  16  line  19  to  page  18  line  21,  and  at  page  35  lines
5~11.)  He  gives  his  wife  about  $250  each  month  which  she  deposits  in  a  Philippine
bank account. (Id.)
1.b.,  and  1.c.  Applicant father-in-law  “passed  away” in  2017, and  his mother-in-
law “is a homemaker.” He currently provides no financial support for his mother-in-law,
who plans to join her sister in the United States. (TR at page 19 line 3 to page 20 line
22, and at page 23 lines 2~13.)  Applicant’s seven brothers-in-law and two sisters-in-law
“live in the mountains.” (TR at page 19 line 3 to page 20 line 22.) The men work “a little
construction, [and] farm work,” while the women “wash clothes for money.” (TR at page
34 line 8 to page 35 line 11.) “They [all] think . . . [Applicant fixes] electronics.” (TR at
page 22 line 23 to page 23 line 1.)
1.e. Applicant only owns property in the Philippines, worth about $18,000, where
he plans to “retire” in about 15~20 years.  He does not own any property in the United
States. (TR at page 21 line 12 to page 22 line 22.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
Applicant  attributes  his  current  financial  difficulties  to  the  hospitalization  of  his
former spouse, his subsequent divorce, a cut in pay, and a personal bout with stomach
cancer. (TR at page 26 line 11 to page 27 line 15, and at page 38 line 16 to page 40 line
25.)
2.a.  Applicant  has  filed  his  Federal  income  tax  returns  for  tax  years  2014  and
2015, as evidenced by documentation included in his Answer to the SOR.  (TR at page
25 line 25 to page 26 line 10, at page 27 line 19 to page 28 line 15, and Answer.)  This
allegation is found for Applicant.
2.b.    Applicant  owes  a  past-due  debt  to  the  Army  and  Air  Force    Exchange
Service  (AFES)  in  the  amount  of  about  $11,000.  (TR  at  page  28  lines  16~21,  and  at
page  37  lines  5~20.)  Despite  having  two  months  after  his  hearing  to  do  so,  Applicant
has provided nothing further in this regard. This allegation is found against Applicant.
2.c., 2.e., and 2.f.   Applicant owes three past-due debts to a credit union in the
amount of about $21,000. (TR at page 28 line 22 to page 31 line 4, at page 32 line 3 to
page 35 line 8, and at page 36 line 12 to page 37 line 4.) Despite having two months
after his hearing to do so, Applicant has provided nothing further in this regard. These
allegations are found against Applicant.
2.d.  Applicant  has  paid  a  $532  past-due  debt  on  an  automobile  loan,  as
evidenced  by  documentation  showing  this  automobile  has  been  sold.  (TR  at  page  31

Notice
I take administrative notice of certain facts relating to the Philippines: the United
States  continues  to  work  with  the  Philippine  government  to  monitor  and  investigate
groups  engaged  in  or  supporting  terrorist  activities  in  the  Philippines.  The  Philippine
government  is  also  currently  engaged  in  a  nationwide  counter-narcotics  campaign.
Extrajudicial killings have been the chief human rights concern in the Philippines.
",False
"Applicant  admitted  five  allegations  and  denied  two  of  the  SOR  allegations.  He
also provided mitigating information. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings
of  fact.  After  a  complete  and  thorough  review  of  the  evidence  of  record,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  56  years  old,  and  was  born  in  Egypt  to  Jordanian  parents.  He
renounced  his  Jordanian  citizenship  a  few  years  ago,  and  he  was  never  an  Egyptian
citizen.  (GE  2)    Applicant  lived  in  Egypt  with  his  family  where  he  attended  an  English

school.   In  1984,  he  obtained his undergraduate  degree  in business  management.  (AE
A,  B)    After  college,  he  worked  in  Saudi  Arabia  for  an  international  company.  He  was
promoted and moved to Egypt. He left Egypt in 2000 to come to the United States. (GE
2). Applicant wanted to be in the United States due to the many opportunities for himself
and his children.
In  1982,  Applicant  married,  and  in  2016,  he  divorced.  (AE  K)  He  has  three
children  from  his  marriage.  In  2000,  he  immigrated  to  the  United  States  with  his  then-
wife and children. In 2007, Applicant became a naturalized United States citizen. (AE C)
In  2009, he obtained a security clearance.
Applicant has worked as a linguist for the U.S. Army since June 2006. (AE B) He
served  as  a  linguist  on  a  military  installation  from  2006  to  2007  in  Iraq.  After  that,  in
2008,  he  returned  to  Iraq  to  again  work  for  the  U.S.  Army  and  lived  on  an  installation.
Applicant was then assigned to three different locations in combat zones. Applicant has
received many letters of commendation from officers with whom he worked. Each attests
to his exceptional ability to aid as a cultural advisor and translator. Applicant is intelligent
and hard working. He was instrumental for a successful mission in Iraq. (AE F) The U.S.
officer  stated  that  Applicant  is  “recognized  as  one  of  the  top  linguists  in  the  area”.  He
participated  in  dangerous  missions.  Applicant  received  awards  and  certificates  for  his
service in Iraq and Kuwait. (AE H)
Applicant  has  a  retirement  account  and  savings  in  the  United  States.(AE  I)  He
does  not  have  any  property  or  bank  accounts  in  foreign  countries.  Applicant’s  ex-wife
lives in the United States and has no foreign property. Applicant has siblings and cousins
in the United States.
The SOR raises the following foreign influence security concerns:
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges that Applicant’s father, brother and sister are citizens of Jordan
and reside in Saudi Arabia. Applicant’s parents were born in Jordan. (GE 1) His mother
is deceased. Applicant admits this allegation. He had not seen his family members when
he  was  in  Kuwait,  but  now  that  he  is  in  Saudi  Arabia  he  visited  his  father  once.  The
family members are not allowed on base without an invitation. The family members have
not been to the base. (Tr. 22)
SOR  ¶  1.b  alleges  Applicant’s  brother  claims  citizenship  with  the  United  States
and Canada. He resides in Saudi Arabia. (Tr. 22) He is not connected to the government
of Saudi Arabia. (Tr.) Applicant communicates with him once every few years.
SOR  ¶  1.c  alleges  Applicant’s  sister  is  a  U.S.  citizen  living  in  Saudi  Arabia.
Applicant said his sister is married and she and her children live in Saudi Arabia. She is
a  U.S.  citizen.  Now  that  Applicant  is  in  Saudi  Arabia,  he  sees  his  sister  for  lunch  on
occasion.
SOR  ¶  1.d  alleges  Applicant’s  child  is  a  dual  citizen  of  Jordan  and  the  United
States residing in Egypt. She has moved to the United States and holds a U.S. passport.
(Tr. 23) She is a university professor. (Tr. 24)
SOR  ¶  1.e  alleges  Applicant’s  brother-in-law  is  a  Jordanian  citizen  residing  in
Saudi  Arabia.  Applicant  denied  this  allegation  as  his  brother-in-law  is  a  United  States
citizen, and holds no other citizenship. He has no contact with him since his divorce. (Tr.
10)
SOR  ¶  1.f  alleges  Applicant’s  sister-in-law  is  an  Egyptian  citizen  living  in  Egypt.
Applicant has no contact with her.
SOR  ¶  1.g  alleges  Applicant’s  father  is  a  retired  member  of  the  Saudi  Arabia
Ministry of Information. This is not accurate. Applicant’s father worked for the ministry for
one year a long time ago, and disputes that he retired from the ministry. His father is ill
and elderly (80). Applicant calls his father once every ten days.
Saudi Arabia
The  United  States  and  Saudi  Arabia  generally  have  good  relations  and  share  a
common  concern  about  regional  security  in  the  Middle  East.  Relations  between  the
United States and Saudi Arabia were strained after the September 2001 terrorist attacks.
During  2003  and  2004,  terrorists  and  suicide  bombers  kidnapped  or  killed  Americans
and attacked the U.S. consulate. Terrorist attacks have been attempted or have occurred
in the last several years. The State Department warns U.S. citizens to carefully consider
the  risks  of  travel  to  Saudi  Arabia  due  to  concerns  about  potential  terrorist  activity
directed against U.S. citizens and interests.
Individuals  and  organizations  based  in  Saudi  Arabia  have  been  designated  by
the U.S. government as providing financial and material support to al-Qa’eda and more
recently  to  ISIL  and  other  terrorist  groups.  Violence  from  the  conflict  in  Yemen  has
occasionally  “spilled  over”  into  Saudi Arabia  with  numerous  projectiles  being  launched
from Yemen into Saudi Arabia. Human rights problems have occurred throughout Saudi
Arabia.

"Applicant, a native of China, is a 56-year-old employee who is seeking to retain a
security clearance at the secret level, which was granted to her in 2006,3 for her job as
a  software  quality  engineer.  She  has  worked  for  the  same  aerospace  company  since
2004.  Before  that,  she  worked  as  a  software  engineer for  a  large  U.S.  company.  She
has  a  good  employment  record  based  on  a  highly  favorable  letter  of  recommendation
from a technical fellow who serves as the technical lead for a team of 200 engineers.4
Among other things, the letter described Applicant as a sought after software engineer
“due  to  her  dedication,  attention  to  detail,  and  hard  work.”  The  letter  also  described
Applicant  as  “a  dedicated  American  citizen  who  enjoys  being  active  in  the  community
and just wants the best for her [children].”
Applicant  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree from  a  Chinese  university  of  science  and
technology in 1983. She was then employed as a software and hardware engineer. She
lived  with  her  parents  until  her  marriage  to  a  citizen  of  China  in  1987.  Applicant  has
lived in the United States since 1990, when she and her  then husband came  here via
her  husband’s  student  visa  so  he  could  pursue  further  education.  In  due  course,  she
became a permanent resident of the United States, and she obtained U.S. citizenship in
2000. Her marriage ended in divorce in 2004. She had two children during the marriage,
both of whom are native-born U.S. citizens. Her 23-year-old daughter is a recent college
graduate  who  has  plans  to  attend  medical  school.  Her  19-year-old  son  is  a  college
student who studies computer science.

4 Exhibit B.
The  SOR  concerns  Applicant’s  family  ties  to  China  via  her  father,  mother,  and
two  sisters.  These  are  the  same  family  members  as  when  Applicant  was  granted  a
security clearance in 2006. The relevant details are set forth below.
Applicant’s mother and father, now both in their 80s, came to the United States in
2002  via  Applicant’s  sponsorship.  They  were  granted  permanent  resident  status  in
November  2002.5  They  lived  with  Applicant  when  they  were  not  visiting  their  other
daughter in the United States. Neither speaks English, and neither was employed in the
United States. It was  not unusual for  her parents to travel back and forth between the
United  States  and  China.  They  returned  to  China  in  2012  or  2013  due  to  her  father’s
declining health.6 Applicant’s father has been retired for more than 20 years from his job
as  a  manager  for  the  same  company  she  worked  for  in  China.7  Likewise,  Applicant’s
mother  has  been  retired  for  more  than  20  years  from  her  job  as  a  department-store
manager.8 Applicant speaks to her parents by telephone weekly. Applicant’s parents are
aware that she works as a software engineer for an aerospace company, but that is the
extent of their knowledge.9
In  addition  to  her  parents,  Applicant  has  two  sisters  who  are  both  citizens  of
China. One sister lives in  the United States and has been a permanent resident since
2011.10  Her  sister  has  a  job  working  in  a  college  library.  Her  sister’s  husband  is
employed as a professor at the same college. Another sister lives in China, and she is
employed as a civil engineer for a Chinese engineering firm.
Applicant’s  financial  interests  are  here  with  the  exception  of  a  bank  account  in
China.  In  addition  to  her  annual  salary,  Applicant  has  the  following  financial  assets  in
the United States: (1) her home with a market value of about $400,000 with a mortgage
loan balance of about $100,000; (2) a 401(k) account with a balance of about $700,000
to $800,000; (3) two residential rental properties which are unencumbered by mortgage
loans;  (4)  approximately  $250,000  in  IRA  accounts;  and  (5)  $75,000  to  $100,000  in
bank  accounts.11  She  opened  a  bank  account  in  China  sometime  after  her  parents
return in the event she wanted to provide financial assistance to  them.12 She made an
initial deposit of about $25,000 to $30,000, and has since made no further deposits. The

if necessary.
There is no evidence that Applicant has been accused of or cited for a security
infraction  or  security  violation  since  granted  eligibility  in  2006.  Likewise,  there  is  no
evidence that she has otherwise mishandled sensitive or classified information or failed
to  perform  security-related  duties  or  responsibilities.  At  the  hearing,  she  expressed  a
good understanding of security-related matters.13
request
Concerning
the  country  of  China,  Department  Counsel’s
for
administrative  notice  contains  an  extensive  discussion  of  the  security  concerns
associated with China. The most pertinent of those facts are the following: (1) China is
an authoritarian state in which the Chinese Communist Party is the paramount authority;
(2)  China  (along  with  Russia)  is  the  most  aggressive  collector  of  intelligence  (both
industrial and military) related to U.S. information and technology; and (3) China has a
poor record of human rights regarding respect for the integrity of the person, respect for
civil  liberties,  respect  for  political  rights,  corruption  and  lack  of  transparency  in
government,  worker  rights,  as  well  as  discrimination,  societal  abuses,  and  human
trafficking. The maltreatment and oppression of the people in Tibet is but one example
of China’s poor human-rights record.
Law and Policies
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (E.O.)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of
Defense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review
Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  National  Security
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.14
It  is  well-established  law  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.15  As
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side  of  denials.”16  Under  Egan,  Executive  Order  10865,  and  the  Directive,  any  doubt
about  whether  an  applicant  should  be  allowed  access  to  classified  information  will  be
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that
the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.17 The Appeal Board has

followed  the  Court’s  reasoning,  and  a  judge’s  findings  of  fact  are  reviewed  under  the
substantial-evidence standard.18
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a  security  clearance  for  access  to  confidential,  secret,  or  top-secret  information.19  An
unfavorable  clearance  decision  (1)  denies  any  application,  (2)  revokes  any  existing
security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.20
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access  to  classified  information.21  The  Government  has  the  burden  of  presenting
evidence  to  establish  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR  that  have  been  controverted.22  An
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts  that  have  been  admitted  or  proven.23  In  addition,  an  applicant  has  the  ultimate
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.24
Discussion
The  gravamen  of  the  SOR  under  Guideline  B  for  foreign  influence  is  whether
Applicant’s  ties  to  China  should  disqualify  her  from  access  to  classified  information.
Under  Guideline  B  for  foreign  influence,25  the  suitability  of  an  applicant  may  be
questioned or put into doubt due to foreign contacts and interests. The overall concern
under the guideline is:
Foreign  contacts  and  interests,  including  but  not  limited  to  business,
financial,  and  property  interests,  are  a  national  security  concern  if  they
result in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern
if they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or
induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a
way  inconsistent  with  U.S.  interests  or  otherwise  made  vulnerable  to
pressure  or  coercion  by  any  foreign  interest.  Assessment  of  foreign
contacts  and  interests  should  consider  the  country  in  which  the  foreign
contact  or  interest  is  located,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  considerations

such  as  whether it  is known  to  target  U.S. citizens  to  obtain  classified  or
sensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism.26
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise a security concern under
AG ¶ 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:
AG  ¶  7(a)  contact,  regardless  of  method,  with  a  foreign  family  member,
business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen
of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk
of  foreign  exploitation,  inducement,  manipulation,  pressure,  or  coercion;
and
AG ¶ 7(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country
that  create  a  potential  conflict  of  interest  between  the  individual's
obligation  to  protect  classified  or  sensitive  information  or  technology  and
the  individual's  desire  to  help  a  foreign  person,  group,  or  country  by
providing that information or technology.
The  starting  point  for  the  analysis  is  the  country  of  China.  Suffice  it  to  say,  the
U.S.  Government  views  the  behavior  of  the  Chinese  government  as  presenting  a
serious  national  security  concern,  and  the  heightened-risk  element  is  satisfied  too.
Given Applicant’s family ties to China, the Government has established its case under
Guideline B. The above disqualifying conditions are raised by the evidence.
The guideline provides that certain facts and circumstances may mitigate foreign
influence  concerns.  Given  the  evidence  here,  I  considered  the  following  mitigating
conditions:
AG ¶ 8(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country
in  which  these  persons  are  located,  or  the positions  or activities  of  those
persons  in  that  country  are  such  that  it  is  unlikely  the  individual  will  be
placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign
individual,  group,  organization,  or  government  and  the  interests  of  the
United States;
AG  ¶  8(b)  there  is  no  conflict  of  interest,  either  because  the  individual’s
sense  of  loyalty  or  obligation  to  the  foreign  person,  or  allegiance  to  the
group,  government,  or  country  is  so  minimal,  or  the  individual  has  such
deep  and  longstanding  relationships  and  loyalties  in  the  United  States,
that  the  individual  can  be  expected  to  resolve  any  conflict  of  interest  in
favor of the U.S. interest; and
AG ¶ 8(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or

could  not  be  used  effectively  to  influence,  manipulate,  or  pressure  the
individual.
China’s  relationship  with  the  United  States  and  the  heightened  risk  it  presents
place  a  heavy  burden  on  Applicant  to  mitigate  the  security  concern.  With  that  said,
Applicant  has  multiple  indicators  of  a  mature,  stable,  responsible,  and  trustworthy
person.  She  was  serious,  candid,  and  credible  at  the  hearing.  She  appears  to  have
cooperated fully and provided truthful information about  her family ties to China during
the  security  clearance  process.  She  made  a  good  impression  upon  me  during  the
hearing.
I have considered the totality of Applicant’s ties to China. Applicant came to the
United  States  more  than  25  years  ago  in  1990,  and  she  has  since  established  and
made her life here. She has a long employment record in the United States, she gave
birth to two children in the United States, and her adult children are pursing their lives
and  educations  in  the  United  States.  In  addition  to  her  children,  she  has  a  sister  who
lives and works in the United States as well as a brother-in-law. Her parents resided in
the United States for about a decade until returning to China for health reasons in about
2012  or  2013.  Her  financial  assets,  which  are  substantial,  are  in  the  United  States
except for a bank account in China she established to assist her parents. The value and
routine nature of her Chinese bank account is such that it is unlikely to pose a conflict,
and it is unlikely to be used to influence, manipulate, or pressure Applicant. AG ¶ 8(f) is
applicable.
Other  than  her  parents  return  to  China,  little  has  changed  since  Applicant  was
favorably  adjudicated  for  a  security  clearance  in  2006.  Applicant  has  since  had  more
time to establish her ties and connections to the United States, and to demonstrate that
she  adheres  to  security  rules  and  requirements  for  her  employment  with  a  defense
contractor.  Given  the  totality  of  facts  and  circumstances,  I  conclude  that  it  is  unlikely
Applicant  will be  placed  in a  position  of  having  to  choose  between  the  interests of  the
United States and the interests of the Chinese government or her family members who
have  Chinese  citizenship.  I  further  conclude  there  is  no  conflict  of  interest,  because
Applicant has developed such deep and long-standing relationships and loyalties in the
United States that she can be expected to resolve any potential conflict of interest in the
favor of the United States. AG ¶ 8(a) is partially applicable. AG ¶ 8(b) is applicable.
Following  Egan  and  the  clearly  consistent  standard,  I  have  no  doubts  or
concerns  about  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  good  judgment,  and  ability  to
protect  classified  or  sensitive  information.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  I  weighted  the
evidence  as  a  whole  and  considered  if  the  favorable  evidence  outweighed  the
unfavorable  evidence  or  vice  versa.  I  also  considered  the  whole-person  concept.
Accordingly, I conclude that she met her ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified
information.

Administrative Judge
",True
"Applicant  admitted  all  the  allegations  in  the  SOR.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 58-year-old employee of a defense contractor. (TR at page 20 line
22 to page 21 line 13, and GX 1 at page 5.)  He has been employed  with the defense
contractor “since July of 2017.” (TR at page 20 line 22 to page 21 line 13.) He is married
to  a  Philippine  national;  and  has  three  children,  the  two  eldest  living  with  his  former
spouse in the United States. (TR at page 20 lines 18~21, and GX 1 at pages 46~47 and
53.)  His  youngest  child  resides  in  the  Philippines  with  the  child  mother,  Applicant’s
current wife. Applicant resides in the United States.
Guideline F – Financial Considerations
Applicant  attributes  his  admitted
to  brief  periods  of
unemployment, the one “started May 31, 2017, to July 17, 2017.” (TR at page 34 lines
1~10.)
financial  difficulties
1.a. Applicant admits that he has a past-due debt in the amount of about $7,291,
as the result of a breach of contract with a former employer. (TR at page 21 line 21 to
page  25  line  6.)  Through  a  credit  counseling  service,  Applicant  is  making  monthly
payments of $134 towards this admitted debt, as evidenced by documentation from that
counseling service. (AppX A at page1 and AppX B at page 1.) This allegation is found
for Applicant.
1.b.  and  1.f.  Applicant  admits  that  he  has  two  past-due  debts  with  the
Department of Education totaling about $3,672. (TR at page 25 line 7 to page 27 line 2.)
In  August and  September of 2017, Applicant  was  trying  to  make monthly  payments  of
only  $5  towards  this  admitted  debt.  (Id,  and  AppX  A  at  page  2  and  AppX  B  at  pages
2~3.) This documentation also shows that Applicant was “past due” $5 on his payments.
(Id.)  Despite  having  a  month  to  do  so,  Applicant  has  submitted  nothing  further  in  this
regard. (TR at page 42 line 23 to page 43 line 19.) These allegations are found against
Applicant.
1.c.  Applicant admits that he has a past-due debt in the amount of about $1,747
to  Creditor  C.  (TR  at  page  27  line  3  to  page  28  line  10.)  Through  a  credit  counseling
service,  Applicant  is  making  monthly  payments  of  $88  towards  this  admitted  debt,  as
evidenced by documentation from that counseling service. (AppX A at page1 and AppX
B at page 1.) This allegation is found for Applicant.
1.d. Applicant admits that he had a past-due debt with Creditor D in the amount
of about $696, but avers that this “phone bill account . . . was paid off.” (TR at page 28
line  11  to  page  29  line  8.)  Despite  having  a  month  to  do  so,  Applicant  has  submitted
nothing further in this regard. This allegation is found against Applicant.
1.e. Applicant admits that he had past-due child support payments totaling about
$7,747. In August of 2017, this was being paid through wage garnishment. (TR at page
29 line 9 to page 31 line 14, and AppX at page 3 and AppX B at pages 4~5.) Despite
having  a  month  to  do  so,  Applicant  has  submitted  nothing  further  in  this  regard.  This
allegation is found against Applicant.
Not alleged; but admitted to by Applicant at his hearing, he is a month past due
on a car payment, and  owes about $800 in state back taxes. (TR at page 32 line 3 to
page 36 line 2.)
Guideline B – Foreign Influence
2.a,  2.b.,  and  2.d.  Applicant’s  current  spouse  is  a  citizen  and  resident  of  the
Philippines. She hopes to immigrate to the United States. Their four-year-old American
son resides with Applicant’s spouse. Applicant provides financial support of about $600
every few months to his spouse. She lives with her parents. (TR at page 20 line 4~21, at
page 37 line 18 to page 40 line 17.)
2.c. Applicant’s mother-in-law and father-in-law are citizens and residents of the
Philippines. (TR at page 41 line 18 to page 42 line 3.) They know little about Applicant’s
employment, only that he is “a mechanic . . . [who does] work for the Military.” (Id.)
2.e. In 2012, over five years ago, Applicant gave a one-time gift of about $500 to
a  female  friend  in  the  Philippines.  (TR  at  page  40  line  18  to  page  41  line  17.)  Their
relationship was terminated years ago. (Id.)
Administrative Notice
I take Administrative Notice of the following facts regarding the Philippines: It is a
multiparty,  constitutional  republic  with  a  bicameral  legislature.  However,  dynastic
political families continue to monopolize elective offices. The U.S. Department of State
advises  all  U.S.  citizens  traveling  to  the  Philippines  to  exercise  caution  due  to  crime,
terrorism, and civil unrest. (GX 5 at pages 3~5.)

"Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations.  She  is  a  41-year-old,  native-born
U.S.  citizen  and  resident.  She  obtained  bachelor’s  and  master’s  degrees  in  1999  and
2003,  respectively.  She  is  married.  She  has  three  minor  children;  all  are  native-born
U.S. citizens. She and her husband have owned their home in the United States since
July 2004.2
Applicant  has  worked  for  her  current  employer,  a  DOD  contractor,  since  late
2017.  She  worked  for  previous  DOD  contractors  since  2004.  She  has  held  a  security
clearance since approximately 2008.3
Applicant’s husband is 44 years old. He was born in Pakistan. He immigrated to
the United States on a student visa in 2001, at age 24. He and his family in Pakistan are
religious minorities, and he sought to escape the turmoil in Pakistan. He does not intend
to return to Pakistan to live.4
Applicant met her husband online in 2003; she married him later that year. At the
time,  he  was  in  the  United  States  in  transition  from  a  student  to  a  work  visa,  and  she
was working full time and pursuing her master’s degree. He became a naturalized U.S.
citizen in 2009 and he holds a U.S. passport. His Pakistani passport expired in 2009, he
has not since renewed it, and he has no intentions of doing so in the future.5
Applicant’s mother-in-law died in 2011. Her father-in-law, brother-in-law, and one
sister-in-law  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Pakistan,  and  her  second  sister-in-law  is  a
Pakistani citizen residing in Canada. Both Applicant and her husband testified that none
of  the  family  in  Pakistan  is  affiliated  with  the  Pakistani  government  or  military.

Applicant’s  father-in-law  is  75  years  old.  He  lives  in  a  rental  property  in  an  affluent
neighborhood that is protected by a guard. He works for a private company.6
Applicant  communicates  with  her  father-in-law  telephonically  once  every  two  to
three months. She described her husband’s relationship with his father as a close one.
Her  husband  talks  to  his  father  two  to  three  times  weekly.  Applicant  and  her  husband
visited and stayed with her father-in-law in Pakistan for three weeks in 2006. They did a
few tourist activities but primarily stayed close to her father-in-law’s neighborhood. Her
father-in-law  kept  their  passports  in  a  locked  safe  and  made  sure  they  were  with  his
driver-bodyguard  anytime  they  left  his  neighborhood.  Applicant  has  not  since  returned
to Pakistan and she does not intend to in the future, primarily because she received her
security  clearance  but  also  because  her  father-in-law  advised  against  it  given  the
political climate there.7
Applicant’s husband and children have since traveled to Pakistan. They travel to
Pakistan every year to visit his father. They travel on their U.S. passports. As of the date
of the hearing, Applicant’s husband last traveled there in April 2017. He has no intention
of visiting Pakistan once his father, sister, and sister’s children no longer live there. For
two  weeks  each  in  2016  and  2017,  Applicant’s  father-in-law  visited  and  stayed  with
Applicant and her family in the United States. He was scheduled to revisit them in June
2018.  Through  the  sponsorship  of  Applicant’s  husband,  Applicant’s  father-in-law
obtained  a  green  card  in  2016.  He  intends  to  move  to  the  United  States  and  live  with
Applicant and her husband once her sister-in-law is approved to immigrate to Canada,
as further discussed below.8
Applicant’s one sister-in-law is a Pakistani citizen residing in Pakistan.  She is 41
years old. She is widowed, as her husband died in 2011, and she has two children. She
is a teacher in a private elementary school. Applicant’s husband sends his sister $200
monthly,  and  he  talks  to  her  and  her  children  two  to  three  times  weekly  to  biweekly.
Applicant  communicates  with  this  sister-in-law  telephonically  twice  yearly,  primarily
during  the  holidays,  in  which  they  discuss  their  children  or  the  health  of  Applicant’s
father-in-law.  Aside  from  meeting  this  sister-in-law’s  eldest  child  once,  in  2006,
Applicant does not have any contact with this sister-in-law’s children. As of the hearing
date,  this  sister-in-law  was  in  the  process  of  trying  to  immigrate  to  Canada.  Applicant
expected that this sister-in-law would be approved to immigrate to Canada by the end of
2019.9
Applicant’s brother-in-law is 37 years old. Applicant met her brother-in-law when
she  visited  Pakistan  in  2006.  Since  then,  their  sole  contact  was  electronically  once  or
twice  between  2007  and  2008.  Applicant  testified  that  her  husband’s  family  fell  out  of

touch  with  her  brother-in-law.  Applicant’s  husband  testified  that  his  father  talks  to  his
brother once in a while. He also testified that he had not seen or heard from his brother
since around 2010, stating that “we have no connection.” He testified that his brother is
married  to  a  Pakistani  and  they  have  one  minor  child.  He  also  testified  that  he  was
unaware  what  his  brother  did  for  a  living  and  whether  he  intended  to  remain  in
Pakistan.10
Applicant’s  other  sister-in-law  is  38  years  old.  She  is  married  and  she  has  two
minor  children.  This  sister-in-law  and  her  husband  are  Pakistani  citizens  residing  in
Canada. This sister-in-law immigrated to Canada in 2016, and she is in the process of
becoming  a  Canadian  citizen.  She  works  in  office  administration,  and  her  husband  is
attempting to start his own business. Since Applicant’s sister-in-law moved to Canada,
they talk to each other telephonically or electronically once every two to three months,
primarily  about  their  children.  Prior  to  that,  when  Applicant’s  sister-in-law  resided  in
Pakistan,  they  communicated  minimally.  Applicant’s  sister-in-law  visited  Applicant  and
her family in the United States when she received her Canadian  permanent residency
and  again  in  2017.  Applicant  has  never  met  or  communicated  with  her  sister-in-law’s
husband.11
Applicant’s assets in the United States, to include their home, total approximately
$400,000, which does not include her children’s savings accounts that are held by her
parents. Applicant’s husband received money from his father three times: (1) his father
paid for the costs associated with his move to the United States; (2) his father gave him
money when he immigrated to the United States; and (3) when his father sold the family
home  in  Pakistan  in  2015,  the  proceeds  of  the  sale  were  divided  among  Applicant’s
husband  and  his  three  siblings,  and  Applicant’s  husband’s  portion  was  $40,000.
Applicant’s  husband  put  the  $40,000  in  a  bank  account  in  his  name  in  Pakistan,  and
gave his father a power of attorney over the account in the event his father would need
the money. If Applicant’s father-in-law does not need the money before he moves to the
United States, Applicant’s husband intends to transfer the money to the United States.
Aside  from  the  money  he  sends  to  his  sister-in-law  in  Pakistan,  Applicant’s  husband
also  sends  $1,000  monthly  to  a  charity  in  Pakistan  that  is  run  by  his  cousin,  which
supports orphan children in schools. Neither Applicant nor her husband have any other
foreign financial interests.12
Applicant testified that her husband is aware that she holds a security clearance,
but  her  foreign  family  members  are  not.  She  testified  that  neither  he  nor  her  foreign
family  members  are  aware  about  the  specific  nature  of  her  work,  as  she  does  not
discuss it with anyone. He is aware that her work is affiliated with the DOD. She testified
that she has always been compliant with annual security training requirements, and she
reported her 2006 trip to Pakistan in accordance with such requirements. Both she and
her  husband  testified  that  they  would  report  to  the  proper  authorities  any  attempts  by

anyone to obtain information about her or the nature of her work. She indicated that she
is  loyal  and  bears  a  sense  of  allegiance  and  obligation  only  to  the  United  States,  and
she would resolve any conflict in favor of the United States.13
Applicant’s  parents  are  native-born  U.S.  citizens.  They  are  retired  farmers,  and
her  mother  is  also  a  retired  registered  nurse.  Her father  served  in  the  U.S. military  for
two years. Applicant and her family are heavily involved in their community. Her children
participate  in  Girl  Scouts,  and  dance  and  swim  lessons.  A  number  of  character
references,  to  include  members  in  her  community,  described  her  as  honest  and
trustworthy.  Her  direct  supervisor  noted  that  she  is  the  consummate  professional,  and
that  he  had  no  reason  to  question  her  loyalty,  integrity,  or  commitment  to  the  United
States.14
Pakistan
The U.S. State Department warns U.S. citizens against all non-essential travel to
Pakistan.  Travel  by  U.S.  Government  personnel  within  Pakistan  is  restricted.  Terrorist
groups  continue  to  pose  a  danger  to  U.S.  citizens  throughout  Pakistan,  and  evidence
suggests  that  some  victims  of  terrorist  activity  were  targeted  because  they  are
Americans.  Although  al-Qaida  in  Pakistan  has  been  degraded,  its  global  leadership
continued to operate from remote locations in the region that the group has historically
exploited  for  safe  haven.  Pakistan  did  not  take  substantial  action  against  the  Afghan
Taliban or Haqqani Network, or substantially limit their ability to threaten U.S. interests
in  Afghanistan.  Pakistan  has  also  not  taken  sufficient  action  against  other  externally-
focused  groups  such  as  Lashkar-e-Tayyiba  and  Jaish-e-Mohammad  in  2016,  which
continued to operate, train, organize, and fundraise in Pakistan.
The  U.S.  State  Department’s  2016  Human  Rights  Report  for  Pakistan  indicates
that  the  most  serious  human  rights  problems  in  Pakistan  were  the  following:  (1)
extrajudicial and targeted killings; (2) disappearances; (3) torture; (4) lack of rule of law;
(5) gender inequality; and (6) sectarian violence. Other human rights problems included
arbitrary  detention,  governmental  infringement  on  citizens’  privacy  rights,  a  weak
criminal  justice  system,  and  a  lack  of  judicial  independence.  There  were  government
restrictions  on  freedom  of  assembly  and  limits  on  freedom  of  movement.  Government
practices and certain laws limited freedom of religion, particularly for religious minorities.
Corruption  within  the  government  and  police,  as  well  as  discrimination  against  women
and  girls  remained  serious  problems.  Societal  discrimination  against  national,  ethnic,
and racial minorities persisted, as did discrimination based on caste, sexual orientation,
and gender identity.

"Applicant, a native of Iran, is a 36-year-old employee who is seeking to upgrade
an  existing  security  clearance  to  the  top-secret  level  for  his  job  as  a  senior  systems
engineer  for  a  company  in  the  defense  industry.  He  has  never  married  and  has  no
children. He immigrated with his family to the United States in 2003. He, along with his
father, mother, and sister, became naturalized U.S. citizens in 2008,5 and they all reside
in the United States.
Shortly  after  his  arrival  here,  Applicant  attended  a  local  community  college  and
then  a  large  state  university  during  2004-2006,  and  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in
electrical  engineering.  He  was  a  graduate  student  at  a  private  research  university  for
one  semester  in  2008  before  he  was  admitted  to  a  prestigious  private  research
university. He earned a master’s degree in aeronautics and astronautics in June 2012.
He  remained  a  student  at  the  same  university  while  on  leave  of  absence  from
September 2012 to August 2013.
Applicant  has  worked  for  his  current  employer  since  late  2014.  Before  that,  he
had  a  series  of  part-time  jobs.  He  was  self-employed  as  a  research  associate  during

while studying for his master’s degree. Before that, he worked as an associate software
engineer  for  a  well-known  research  and  development  center  during  2007-2008.  This
was his first job after earning his bachelor’s degree.
With exception of an unnamed friend, the SOR concerns Applicant’s family ties to
Iran via his father, mother, sister, aunt, and uncle, whom all have dual citizenship with
the United States and Iran. The relevant details are set forth below.
Applicant’s  mother,  age  63,  a  child  psychologist  with  a  master’s  degree  from  a
U.S. university, was a kindergarten teacher or principal for a few years in Iran until the
birth  of  her  second  child.  She  has  permanently  resided  in  the  United  States  since
moving  here  in  2003. She  traveled to  Iran  periodically  (e.g.,  once per  year) to  provide
care for her mother until her death after a long period of illness in 2011 or 2012. Since
the  passing  of  her  mother,  Applicant’s  mother  made  three  short  trips  to  Iran  to  assist
with the shipping of household property to the United States.6 Applicant’s mother is not
employed outside the home, and she has focused her time and energy throughout her
marriage on running the household and raising the children.
Applicant’s  father,  age  69,  has  spent  a  career  in  academia,  with  teaching
positions  at  the  university  level  in  both  Iran  and  the  United  States.  He  earned  his
degrees, including a Ph.D., from universities in the United States.7 He then worked for
various companies in the United States. When they married, his wife was then a student
at a U.S. university. After the revolution in Iran, Applicant’s father and mother decided to
return to Iran so she could be near her mother. They resided there from the early 1980s
(Applicant was born in Iran in 1983) until they returned to the United States in 2003. In
Iran,  Applicant’s  father  worked  as  a  professor  of  civil  engineering  at  a  technology
university and as a senior executive for the university. He never worked for the Iranian
government.8 He officially retired from the Iranian university in 2013 or 2014.9 Applicant
understands  his  father  is  not  entitled  to  receive  a  pension  or  other  type  of  retirement
benefit. Applicant’s father has worked for the last several years as a research professor
for  the  same  state  university  where  Applicant  obtained  his  bachelor’s  degree.  Before
that, he worked as an adjunct professor for the same university. Since retiring from the
Iranian  university,  Applicant’s  father  has  made  two  short  trips  to  Iran  in  his  capacity
representing  the  state  university.10  Neither  Applicant’s  father  not  mother  intends  to
return to Iran.11

Applicant’s  sister,  age  32,  recently  earned  a  Ph.D.  and  she  is  now  a  research
assistant in a post-doctoral program with the federal government.12 She traveled to Iran
on a single occasion in 2009 to visit her grandmother.
Applicant’s  aunt  (his  mother’s  sister)  and  uncle  are  dual  citizens  who  reside  in
the  United  States.  They  have  a  son  born  in  Iran  and  a  daughter  born  in  the  United
States. Both of Applicant’s cousins are U.S. citizens. Applicant has limited contact with
his  aunt  and  uncle  due  to  geographic  separation.  He  knows  that  his  aunt  has  always
been  a  stay-at-home mother, and  his uncle has  a  Ph.D.  in  civil  engineering.  As far as
Applicant  knows,  neither  his  aunt  nor  his  uncle  have  any  connections  to  the  Iranian
government.
Applicant believes the unnamed friend, alleged in the SOR to be a citizen of Iran,
is a person with whom he had irregular social interactions with but none since 2015.13
Applicant was introduced to the person by a professor they had in common. The social
interactions consisted of hanging out, watching football, and having a beer or two.14
Applicant’s financial interests are solely in the United States.15 His annual salary
is about $100,000, and he has a net worth of about $250,000, which is sizeable given
his age and work history. He volunteers in various constructive community activities.16
Based on documentary evidence and the testimony of two character witnesses,
Applicant has a good employment record and is held in high regard. For example, the
technical director of the program in which Applicant works described Applicant as hard
working,  exceptional,  and  a  high  performer  in  the  company.17  He  further  described
Applicant  as  dedicated,  trustworthy,  and  straightforward  in  following  the  rules  and
dealing  with  security  matters.18  Even  more  impressive  was  the  highly  favorable
endorsement  from  Applicant’s  program  director,  a  retired  Air  Force  colonel  with  25
years of active duty, including multiple combat tours. He described Applicant as one of
the  company’s  top  engineers.19  He  described  Applicant’s  work  ethic  as  the  very
highest.20  He  described  Applicant’s  character  as  one  of  unquestioned  integrity  and

trustworthiness  with  a  tremendous  sense  of  honesty.21  He  has  zero  reservations  in
vouching  for  Applicant’s  suitability  for  access  to  classified  information.  He  further
described  Applicant  as  “the  best  young  engineer”  employed  by  the  company.22  Going
even  further  in  his  praise,  he  described  Applicant  as  a  national  resource,  among  the
brightest of his generation, and whose contributions to the defense and security of the
United States are essential.”23
Concerning the country of Iran, the February 1979 fall of the Shah of Iran, then a
key  U.S.  ally,  opened  a  long  rift  in  diplomatic  relations  between  Iran  and  the  United
States  that  continues  to  today.  On  November  4,  1979,  radical  Iranian  students  seized
the  U.S.  Embassy  in  Tehran,  and  then  held  hostages  until  shortly  after  President
Reagan’s  inauguration  on  January  20, 1981.  The  United  States  severed  relations  with
Iran  on  April  7,  1980.  As  a  result,  in  the  United  States  the  Iranian  Interests  Section  is
located  in  the  Embassy  of  Pakistan,  and  the  U.S.  protecting  power  in  Iran  is
Switzerland. The U.S. Government has a number of special concerns regarding Iranian
behavior  as  outlined  in  Department  Counsel’s  written  request.24  The  concerns  include
Iran’s efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction; its support for violent opposition
to the Middle East peace process; its ongoing support of the Assad regime in war-torn
Syria; and its dismal human-rights record. The United States has designated Iran as a
state sponsor of terrorism for many years.
Law and Policies
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (E.O.)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of
Defense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review
Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  National  Security
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.25
It  is  well-established  law  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.26  As
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side  of  denials.”27  Under  Egan,  Executive  Order  10865,  and  the  Directive,  any  doubt

about  whether  an  applicant  should  be  allowed  access  to  classified  information  will  be
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that
the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.28 The Appeal Board has
followed  the  Court’s  reasoning,  and  a  judge’s  findings  of  fact  are  reviewed  under  the
substantial-evidence standard.29
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a  security  clearance  for  access  to  confidential,  secret,  or  top-secret  information.30  An
unfavorable  clearance  decision  (1)  denies  any  application,  (2)  revokes  any  existing
security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.31
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access  to  classified  information.32  The  Government  has  the  burden  of  presenting
evidence  to  establish  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR  that  have  been  controverted.33  An
applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate
facts  that  have  been  admitted  or  proven.34  In  addition,  an  applicant  has  the  ultimate
burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.35
Discussion
The  gravamen  of  the  SOR  under  Guideline  B  for  foreign  influence  is  whether
Applicant’s  ties  to  Iran  should  disqualify  him  from  access  to  classified  information.
Under  Guideline  B  for  foreign  influence,36  the  suitability  of  an  applicant  may  be
questioned or put into doubt due to foreign contacts and interests. The overall concern
under the guideline is:
Foreign  contacts  and  interests,  including  but  not  limited  to  business,
financial,  and  property  interests,  are  a  national  security  concern  if  they
result in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern
if they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or
induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a

way  inconsistent  with  U.S.  interests  or  otherwise  made  vulnerable  to
pressure  or  coercion  by  any  foreign  interest.  Assessment  of  foreign
contacts  and  interests  should  consider  the  country  in  which  the  foreign
contact  or  interest  is  located,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  considerations
such  as  whether  it  is  known  to  target  U.S. citizens  to  obtain  classified  or
sensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism.37
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise a security concern under
AG ¶ 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:
AG  ¶  7(a)  contact,  regardless  of  method,  with  a  foreign  family  member,
business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen
of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk
of  foreign  exploitation,  inducement,  manipulation,  pressure,  or  coercion;
and
AG ¶ 7(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country
that  create  a  potential  conflict  of  interest  between  the  individual's
obligation  to  protect  classified  or  sensitive  information  or  technology  and
the  individual's  desire  to  help  a  foreign  person,  group,  or  country  by
providing that information or technology.
The starting point for the analysis is the country of Iran. Suffice it to say, the U.S.
Government  views  the  behavior  of  the  Iranian  government  as  presenting  a  serious
national security concern. Given Applicant’s ties to Iran, a country that is hostile to the
United States, the Government has established its case under Guideline B. In practice,
the Iranian government considers dual citizens as Iranian citizens only, and the fact that
Applicant and his family members obtained U.S. citizenship does not amount to a formal
or  legal  renunciation  of  Iranian  citizenship,  which  is  at  the  discretion  of  Iranian
government.  Nonetheless,  I  have  given  no  weight  to  the  evidence  concerning  the
unnamed  friend  in  the  SOR.  At  best,  the  interaction  was  a  casual,  social  relationship
that  ended  several  years  ago.  The  above  disqualifying  conditions  are  raised  by  the
evidence.
The guideline provides that certain facts and circumstances may mitigate foreign
influence  concerns.  Given  the  evidence  here,  I  considered  the  following  mitigating
conditions:
AG ¶ 8(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country
in  which  these  persons  are  located,  or  the positions  or activities  of  those
persons  in  that  country  are  such  that  it  is  unlikely  the  individual  will  be
placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign
individual,  group,  organization,  or  government  and  the  interests  of  the
United States; and
37 AG ¶ 6.
AG  ¶  8(b)  there  is  no  conflict  of  interest,  either  because  the  individual’s
sense  of  loyalty  or  obligation  to  the  foreign  person,  or  allegiance  to  the
group,  government,  or  country  is  so  minimal,  or  the  individual  has  such
deep  and  longstanding  relationships  and  loyalties  in  the  United  States,
that  the  individual  can  be  expected  to  resolve  any  conflict  of  interest  in
favor of the U.S. interest.
Iran’s  hostility  to  the  United  States  and  the  heightened  risk  it  presents  place  a
heavy  burden  on  Applicant  to  mitigate  the  security  concern.  With  that  said,  Applicant
has multiple indicators of a mature, stable, responsible, and trustworthy person. He was
articulate, serious, candid, and credible at the hearing. He cooperated fully and provided
truthful  information  about  his  ties  to  Iran  during  the  security  clearance  process.  He
made a highly favorable impression upon me during the hearing.
I  have  considered  the  totality  of  Applicant’s  ties  to  Iran,  which  can  now  be
described as minimal. Applicant, then age 20, and his family came to the United States
in 2003, and he has since established and made his life here. His parents have a long-
standing connection to the United States, both having spent years here obtaining their
academic  degrees  before  returning  to Iran  in  the early  1980s.  Now,  Applicant’s father,
mother,  sister,  uncle,  aunt,  and  cousins  are  citizens  of  and  residents  in  the  United
States.  Applicant  has  spent  the  last  16  years  living,  furthering  his  education,  and
working in the United States. His financial interests are solely in the United States. He is
held  in  high  regard  by  many  who  know  him.  Indeed,  the  character  evidence,  both
documentary and testimonial, was quite powerful.
It  is  unclear  what  has  changed  since  Applicant  was  favorably  adjudicated  for  a
security clearance at the secret level within the last few years.38 Nonetheless, Applicant
has  had  more  time  to  establish  his  ties  and  connections  to  the  United  States  and  to
demonstrate that he adheres to security rules and requirements for his employment with
a defense contractor. Given the totality of facts and circumstances, I conclude that it is
unlikely Applicant will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests
of the United States and the interests of the Iranian government, a terrorist organization,
or  his  family  members  who  have  Iranian  citizenship.  I  further  conclude  there  is  no
conflict  of  interest,  because  Applicant  has  developed  such  deep  and  long-standing
relationships and loyalties in the United States that he can be expected to resolve any
potential  conflict  of  interest  in  the  favor  of  the  United  States.  AG  ¶  8(a)  is  partially
applicable. AG ¶ 8(b) is applicable.
Following  Egan  and  the  clearly  consistent  standard,  I  have  no  doubts  or
concerns  about  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  good  judgment,  and  ability  to
protect  classified  or  sensitive  information.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  I  weighted  the
evidence  as  a  whole  and  considered  if  the  favorable  evidence  outweighed  the
unfavorable  evidence  or  vice  versa.  I  also  considered  the  whole-person  concept.
Accordingly, I conclude that he met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is

what had changed since the favorable adjudication. Tr. 99-100.

"Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations.  (HE  3)  His  admissions  are
incorporated  herein  as  findings  of  fact.  He  also  provided  extenuating  and  mitigating
information.  (HE  3)  After  a  complete  and  thorough  review  of  the  evidence  of  record,  I
make the following findings of fact.
1 The facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment, names of witnesses, names
of  other  groups,  or  locations  in  order  to  protect  Applicant  and  his  family’s  privacy.  The  cited  sources
contain more specific information.
Applicant is 51 years old, and he is seeking employment in Afghanistan as a CAT
II  linguist.  (Tr.  31)  He  returned  to  Afghanistan  shortly  after  his  hearing  to  continue  his
duties as a CAT I linguist (no security clearance) supporting U.S. Forces.
Applicant  was  born  in  Afghanistan.  (Tr.  31)  The  Russian  soldiers  occupying
Afghanistan at that time abused him and his family. (Tr. 34) He received a high school
diploma in Afghanistan. (GE 6) He immigrated to the United States in 1995. (Tr. 31) In
1997,  he  became  a  U.S.  resident  alien.  (Tr.  39)  He  was  married  to  a  U.S.  citizen  from
1997 to 2000, and he obtained U.S. citizenship through this marriage; however, he said
he did not commit immigration fraud. (Tr. 40-41, 88) In 2005, he became a U.S. citizen.
(GE 1)
For  about  14  years,  Applicant  worked  in  the  fast-food  industry  in  the  United
States, and he was promoted to regional director of a large fast-food franchise. (Tr. 38,
111-11)  He  believed  his  employer  violated  an  agreement2  and  did  not  pay  him
sufficiently, and left that employment and became a linguist. (Tr. 38)
In  2009,  Applicant  began  working  as  a  linguist  in  Afghanistan.  (Tr.  36)  He  was
repeatedly  exposed  to  combat  conditions  including  small  arms  fires,  indirect  weapons
fires, improvised explosive devices (IED) and rocket-propelled grenades (RPG). (Tr. 42)
Soldiers were killed in operations in close proximity to him. (Tr. 43) On one occasion his
vehicle  was  hit  with  an  IED  and  turned  over.  (Tr.  44)  Applicant  has  experienced
problems with his sleep and memory, and he attributes his medical problems, in part, to
his  service  in  Afghanistan.  (Tr.  45)  As  recently  as  2018,  he  was  on  patrols  that
accomplished the death of Taliban military personnel. (Tr. 47)
Foreign Influence
The  SOR  alleges  under  Guideline  B  that  Applicant’s  spouse  is  a  citizen  and
resident  of  Pakistan  (¶  1.a);  and  his  mother  and  brother  are  citizens  and  residents  of
Afghanistan (¶¶ 1.b and 1.c).
Around  1999,  the  Taliban  killed  Applicant’s  father.  (Tr.  35-36,  59,  138-139)
Around  2001,  the  Taliban  killed  his  sister.  (Tr.  36,  138-139)  Applicant’s  mother  was  a
housewife, and he has not heard from his mother since about 1998 or 1999. (Tr. 58, 61,
146) He does not know if his mother is alive or dead. (Tr. 58) He does not know where
his mother lives. (Tr. 59) His brother was a farmer, and his most recent contact with his
brother was in 1995. (Tr. 60-61) He does not know where his brother currently resides.
2 The SOR did not allege that Applicant was addicted to gambling, or that he stole about $50,000
from  his  fast-food  employer.  (Tr.  113-123)  He  said  in  an  interview  that  in  2013,  he  was  addicted  to
gambling,  and  he  lost  about  $200,000  gambling.  (Tr.  122-126;  GE  6)  His  fast-food  employer  claimed
$50,000 was missing, and Applicant was responsible for the loss. (Tr. 114-122; GE 6) Applicant told his
employer  that  his  employer  could  deduct  the  loss  from  the  $200,000  debt  his  employer  owed  him.  (Tr.
114) Applicant said if his girlfriend stole the missing funds, he would take responsibility for the loss. (Tr.
116)  He  denied  responsibility  for  the  loss  of  $50,000.  (Tr.  157)  No  adverse  inference  is  drawn  against
Applicant for having a gambling addition or the missing $50,000 because the record of this conduct is not
sufficiently developed to establish whether he currently has a gambling addiction or that he stole from his
fast-food employer.
(Tr. 60) His mother and brother did not have any connections, such as employment, with
the Afghan government. (Tr. 62)
In March 2013, Applicant married his wife, and then she went to Afghanistan and
met with Applicant. (Tr. 63, 65, 96, 142) She is 49 years old. (Tr. 140) In 2013, he spent
about two weeks with his spouse. (Tr. 65, 96) He most recently met with his spouse in
2014. (Tr. 65) She resides in Pakistan. (Tr. 76) He communicates with his spouse using
Skype.  (Tr.  66)  His  spouse  has  an  8th  grade-level  education,  and  she  lived  with  her
brother until he died. (Tr. 66) His spouse has two children who are ages 23 and 24, and
Applicant  provides  financial  support  to  her,  and  she  uses  the  funds  to  support  his
stepchildren.  (Tr.  67-68, 143)  In  2018,  he provided  about $6,500  in  support  to  her.  (Tr.
161)
Applicant applied to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) two or
three  times  in  the  last  several  years  for  his  spouse  to  immigrate  to  the  United  States;
however, each time “pictures were lost or something.” (Tr. 98) Applicant acknowledged
that he has not provided all of the necessary paperwork to the USCIS for the USCIS to
approve  her  residence  in  the  United  States; however,  he  contended  that he  is  close to
obtaining approval of his spouse’s immigration to the United States. (Tr. 67, 69, 99) For
example, he has not completed the required affidavit of support. (Tr. 99-100) For about 9
months or maybe 18 months, he was focused on his own medical problems and not on
the  INS’  requirements  for  his  spouse’s  immigration.  (Tr.  100-103,  141)  However,  she
may  have  wanted  to  delay her  move  to the United States.  (Tr. 67,  69)  He  expects  she
will move to the United States within one year. (Tr. 68) She has never been to the United
States. (Tr. 76) He communicates with her about twice a week. (Tr. 141; GE 5 at 1)
Applicant could not go to Pakistan to see his spouse because he was well known
in Pakistan due to his work as a linguist, and “it was very risky for [him] to go there . . . [it]
would be very risky for [his] life.” (Tr. 141) The only time he met his wife in person after
their  marriage  was  in  a  third  country  (not  Pakistan  or  the  United  States)  in  2014.  (Tr.
141-142)
In  2015,  Applicant’s  spouse’s  brother  was  killed  by  the  Taliban.  (Tr.  140,  162)
Applicant’s  spouse  and  his  stepchildren  live  in  the  house  that  was  once  owed  by  her
brother.  (Tr.  162)  Applicant’s  stepchildren  now  own  the  home  in  Pakistan  that  they
inherited from Applicant’s spouse’s brother. (Tr. 162)
Applicant  has  some  bank  accounts  in  the  United  States  with  about  $15,000  in
them; however, he does not own any real estate in the United States. (Tr. 77) He owns a
car and rents an apartment in the United States. (Tr. 78) He was unsure of the status of
some  land  his  father  owned  in  Afghanistan,  and  he  does  not  own  any  property  in
Pakistan.  (Tr.  79)  Applicant  renounced  his  Afghan  citizenship.  (Tr. 163)  Applicant does
not have any relatives that live in the United States. (Tr. 163)
Personal Conduct
The  SOR  alleges  under  Guideline  E  that  Applicant  was  terminated  from
employment  as  a  government  contractor  in  April  2013  for  job  abandonment  (¶  2.a);
Applicant failed to disclose that he did not provide financial support to his second spouse
on his April 26, 2016 SCA (¶ 2.c); and Applicant failed to disclose that he was married to
his  second  spouse,  a  citizen  and  resident  of  Pakistan,  during  a  counterintelligence
interview on September 13, 2013 (¶ 2.d).
In April 2013, Applicant was on leave from Afghanistan in the United States. (Tr.
49-50)  An  investigator  was  interviewing  him,  and  he  missed  his  flight  back  to
Afghanistan. (Tr. 50, 105-106) He called his employer about missing his flight, and was
informed  that he needed  to  report  to Afghanistan  as  scheduled.  (Tr.  50-52)  He told his
employer he could not report on time. (Tr. 52) He waited for a follow-up response from
his  employer  for  one  week,  and  then  he  was  informed  he  was  terminated  for  not
reporting on time to Afghanistan. (Tr. 52) In September 2013, he applied for employment
with the same employer, and in January 2014, he returned to Afghanistan, and he was
employed  by  the  same  employer  that  fired  him  in  April  2013.  (Tr.  53-55)  After  eight
months  working  as  a  linguist  with  the  U.S.  Marines  in  Afghanistan,  the  Marines  and
Applicant  returned  to  the  United  States  as  part  of  the  drawdown  in  U.S.  Forces  in
Afghanistan. (Tr. 55)
A  copy  of  Applicant’s  2013  SCA  is  not  part  of  the  record.  The  summary  of
Applicant’s September 30, 2013 counterintelligence interview and a chart of relatives do
not contain any information about his spouse or stepchildren in Pakistan. (Tr. 128; GE 2;
GE 3) His 2013 counterintelligence summary of interview indicates he disclosed that he
resides with his “ex-girlfriend” and her children, and he provides financial support to her
and her children. (GE 2 at 13) He said his ex-girlfriend and best friend is a U.S. citizen.
(GE  3)  He  also  discussed  his  marriage  from  his  previous  spouse  in  2001,  and  he
provided  information  about  her  U.S.  citizenship.  (GE  2  at  13;  GE  3)  In  sum,  the  only
information  disclosed  during  his  2013  counterintelligence  interview  related  to  his
relationships  with  a  girlfriend  and  former  spouse,  and  both  of  these  women  were  U.S.
citizens. He did not disclose his marriage to a citizen and resident of Pakistan.
In his April 26, 2016 SCA, Applicant disclosed that he married his second spouse
in July 2013, and she lived in Pakistan. (Tr. 74; GE 1) On his April 26, 2016 SCA he did
not disclose that he had two stepchildren as a result of his second marriage, and he said
he did not provide any financial support to a foreign national. (SOR ¶ 2.c; GE 1) During
his May 2, 2016 counterintelligence interview, he said that he did not disclose his March
2013  marriage  to  his  second  spouse  on  his  previous  SCA  and  counterintelligence
interview because he was worried about how it would look to be married to a Pakistani
woman while working for U.S. Forces in Afghanistan. (Tr. 131-132; GE 4 at 9 (Item 35))
He  disclosed  his  two  stepchildren during  his  May  2,  2016  counterintelligence  interview.
Id.
Applicant’s  April  26,  2016  SCA  asked  Applicant  whether  he  ever  provided
financial support for any foreign national, and he responded, no. (Tr. 69; GE 1) He said
he misinterpreted the question, as he believed it pertained to support of individuals other
than  his  spouse.  (Tr.  71,  135)  In  June  2016,  an  Office  of  Personnel  Management
investigator  interviewed  Applicant,  and  he  disclosed  that  he  provided  $500  to  $1,000
monthly to his spouse. (Tr. 133-134)
Applicant  said  that  during  his  2013  counterintelligence  interview,  he  did  not
disclose his marriage to his spouse because he “was never asked any questions [about
his spouse], and it totally went out of [his] mind that [he] should put his wife at that time.”
(Tr.  73)  He  said  he  was  unsure  about  what  he  was  thinking  when  he  was  interviewed.
(Tr. 165) He conceded he “made a mistake.” (Tr. 74)
Character Evidence
Applicant worked for an employer providing overseas linguists from October 2009
to  May  2013,  from  January  2014  to  November  2014,  and  from  September  2017  to
present.  (Tr.  57;  AE  G)  He  received  some  unit  coins  from  commanders  for  his

Afghanistan
Afghanistan  is  a  country  in  Southwestern  Asia  that  is  approximately  the  size  of
Texas  (249,935  square  miles).  Pakistan  borders  it  on  the  east  and  the  south.  Iran
borders it on the west and Russia to the north. It is a rugged and mountainous country
which  has  been fought  over  by  powerful  nations for  centuries.  In  2009,  the  population
was  about  28  million  people  with  about  3  million  Afghans  living  outside  Afghanistan,
mainly in Pakistan and Iran, although over 5 million have returned since the removal of
the Taliban regime.
Afghanistan  is  presently  an  Islamic  Republic  with  a  democratically-elected
president. Afghanistan has had a turbulent political history, including an invasion by the
Soviet  Union  in  1979.  After  an  accord  was  reached  in  1989,  and  the  Soviet  Union
withdrew  from  Afghanistan,  fighting  continued  among  the  various  ethnic,  clan,  and
religious militias. By the end of 1998, the Taliban rose to power and controlled 90% of
the country, imposing aggressive and repressive policies.
In October 2001, U.S. forces and coalition partners led military operations in the
country,  forcing  the  Taliban  out  of  power  by  November  2001.  The  new  democratic
government took power in 2004 after a popular election.
A  U.S.  State  Department  Travel  Advisory  remains  in  effect  for  Afghanistan  at
Travel  Advisory  Level  4-Do  not  travel.  The  State  Department  warns  U.S.  citizens
against  travel  to  Afghanistan  because  of  continued  instability  and  threats  by  terrorist
organizations  against  U.S.  citizens.  Travel  to  all  areas  of  Afghanistan  remains  unsafe
due  to  the  ongoing  risk  of  kidnapping,  hostage-taking,  suicide  bombings,  military
combat  operations,  landmines,  terrorist  and  insurgent  attacks,  banditry,  armed  rivalry
between  political  and  tribal  groups,  militant  attacks,  direct  and  indirect  fire,  and
insurgent attacks, including attacks using vehicle-borne or other IEDs. Attacks may also
target  official  Afghan  and  U.S.  governmental  convoys  and  compounds,  foreign
embassies, military installations, and other public areas.
No province in Afghanistan should be considered immune from violence, and the
potential  exists  throughout  the  country  for  hostile  acts,  either  targeted  or  random,
against U.S. and other foreign nationals at any time. Extremists associated with various
terrorist networks and members of other armed opposition groups are active throughout
the  country  and  remain  violently  opposed  to  the  Afghan  government  and  Coalition
Forces. These terrorist groups have attacked Afghan, Coalition Forces, and U.S. targets
with little regard for or the express intent to cause civilian casualties.
According to the June 2017 U.S. Department of Defense report on Afghanistan,
Afghanistan  faces  a  continuing  threat  from  insurgent  and  terrorist  networks  present  or
operating  in  the  Afghanistan-Pakistan  region.  Department  Counsel’s  administrative
notice lists recent terrorist attacks in Afghanistan resulting in the deaths of hundreds of
civilians and military personnel in 2017 and 2018.
In  December  2016,  the  Department  of  Defense  reported  to  Congress  that,
although  al-Qaeda’s  core  leadership  in  the  Afghanistan-Pakistan  border  region  has
been  degraded,  elements  continue  to  seek  safe  haven  on  both  sides  of  the  border  to
regenerate and conduct attack planning.
The United States’ extraordinary commitment to Afghanistan is balanced against
the inherent dangers of the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan to its citizens and residents
and Afghan government problems developing and complying with the rule of law. A top
national  security  goal  of  the  United  States  is  to  establish  relationships,  cooperation,
training,  and  support  of  the  Afghanistan  Government  and  military  in  the  ongoing  war
against terrorism.
Pakistan
Pakistan  is  a  parliamentary  federal  republic  with  a  population of  more  than  167
million people. After September 11, 2001, Pakistan supported the United States and an
international coalition in Operation Enduring Freedom to remove the Taliban from power
in  Afghanistan.  The  United States  and Pakistan have  common  interests  in a  peaceful,
stable,  and  prosperous  region.  Despite  this  support,  members  of  the  Taliban  and
several terrorist groups are known to operate in several “safe havens” in Pakistan.
Pakistan has numerous human rights issues including extrajudicial and targeted
killings, disappearances, torture, violations of the rule of law, mob violence, and limited
accountability. Government restrictions, corruption, and a culture of impunity are serious
problems in Pakistan. Lack of accountability for violations of the law and human rights
abuses are common.
Some  terrorist  groups  have  had  success  raising  funds  in  Pakistan.  Taliban
financing  has  been  traced  from  Pakistan  to  Afghanistan,  enabling  the  insurgency  in
Afghanistan to strengthen its military and technical capabilities. Pakistan has intensified
its counterinsurgency efforts, but its record for dealing with militants has been mixed.
The  U.S.  Department  of  State  has  defined  several  areas  of  Pakistan  to  be
terrorist  safe  havens.  Although  al-Qaeda  in  Pakistan  has  been  seriously  degraded,
terrorist  groups  continue  to  operate  in  Pakistan.  Attacks  have  resulted  in  hundreds  of
casualties.
The  U.S.  State  Department  warns  U.S.  citizens  of  the  risks  of  traveling  to
Pakistan  in  light  of  terrorist  activity.  Terrorists  have  attacked  numerous  locations
throughout Pakistan.
Pakistan  and  the  United  States  are  allies  in  counterterrorism.  Pakistan  is
committed to elimination of terrorist camps on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border and sent
thousands  of  troops  and  sustained  hundreds  of  casualties  in  this  effort.  Overall,
Pakistan has intensified counterinsurgency efforts and demonstrated determination and
persistence in combating militants. The United States is engaging in a substantial effort
to bolster Pakistan’s military forces and security.
President Obama said that Pakistan is an essential partner of the United States
in  South  Asia,  and  he  committed  to  the  shared  security  and  prosperity  between  these
two great democracies. The United States is Pakistan’s largest trading partner. In 2013,
the United States invested more than $2 billion in Pakistan. United States investments
in  the  energy,  research  and  development,  and  education  sectors  are  particularly
significant.  In  2013,  the  United  States  and  Pakistan  committed  to  strengthening
relationships  between  the  two  countries.  President  Obama  said  that  Pakistan
Americans  living  in  the  United  States  “are  enormous  contributors  to  the  growth  and
development of the United States.” The United States has increased investment in the
U.S.  Embassy  in  Islamabad,  and  this  included  hiring  additional  personnel  and
construction of a new embassy.

"Applicant is 49 years old, married (since1997), and has two children, a daughter age
20 (who attends an American university) and a son age 16 (who is in high school). Applicant
was born Egypt and took his bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineering in 1991 from an Egyptian
university.  He  arrived  in  the  United  States  in  2009  and  promptly  obtained  a  green  card
(Permanent U. S. Resident). He was naturalized in 2015. Because his children were minors
living with him when Applicant was naturalized, they are now U.S. citizens. Applicant took
a Master’s in Business Administration from a U. S. university in 2016. From May 2012 until
July  2016,  he  worked  for  a  defense  contractor.  In  July  2016,  Applicant  formed  his  own
company  and  is  now  self-employed.  He  specializes  in  construction  and  project
management. He continues to do work for his former employer. Applicant has worked on
federal government projects, including embassy construction, since 1995. While working for
his former employer, Applicant surrendered his Egyptian passport in 2015 or 2016. When
he travels, he uses only his U. S. passport.1
The SOR alleged that Applicant has family members who are citizens and residents
of Egypt and that Applicant has property interests in Egypt. More specifically, as to family
members, the SOR alleged that Applicant’s: (1) mother is a citizen and resident of Egypt
and  a  retired  pharmacist  for  the  department  of  health;  (2)  two  sisters  are  citizens  and
residents of Egypt and that one is a teacher at a technological academy and the other is a
diplomat for the Egyptian government; (3) mother-in-law is a citizen and resident of Egypt
and a retired pharmacist for the Ministry of Health ; (4) sister-in-law and brother-in-law are
physicians, the former employed by the department of health and the latter retired from the
department of health.2 Applicant admitted those allegations with explanations, upon which
he elaborated at the hearing.3

3 Answer ¶¶ 1.a-g.
As  to  property  interests  in  Egypt,  the  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant:  (1)  owns  two
apartments; (2) co-owns a home with his mother and two sisters; (3) has bank accounts
and  bank  certificates  of  varying  values;  (3)  has  two  bank  accounts  maintained  by  his
spouse.4 Applicant admitted those allegations with explanations, upon which he elaborated
at the hearing.5
Applicant stated in his Answer that when he became a permanent resident in 2009,
his long-time goal and passion was to become a U. S. citizen along with his wife and children
and to serve this nation with honor and dignity. He reiterated those sentiments in his hearing
testimony. Applicant wanted his children to live in the United States and be educated here.
When  he  became  a  U.  S.  citizen,  he  pledged  complete,  undivided,  and  unconditional
allegiance to this country. Applicant could never be manipulated, coerced, or induced to do
anything that would be against the interests of the United States.6
In all of Applicant’s years working on federal government projects (since 1995), he
has never had any security violations or any disciplinary issues. If he learned that one or
more  of  his  family  members  in  Egypt  were  being  exploited  to  compromise  our  national
security through him, Applicant would report it his Facility Security Officer (FSO) and other
appropriate authorities. He has been briefed on the appropriate reporting requirements in
such a situation.7
Applicant’s character witnesses vouched for his exemplary character. The witnesses
each had personal knowledge of Applicant. They had known him from as far back as 2006,
2009,  and  2012.  They  each  knew  the  security  concerns  that  prompted  this  hearing.
Applicant was described as “honest” and “trustworthy,” “reliable” with “great integrity.” Those
positive qualities were also expressed in the character letters submitted by Applicant. 8
Applicant  testified  about  his  family  members  in  Egypt.  His  mother  retired  as  a
pharmacist about 15 or 16 years ago. She is 87. Applicant does not provide any financial
support to his mother. She has no ties to the Egyptian government and was not required to
join any political party to work in the department of health. Applicant visits her about once a
year. His mother knows nothing about him seeking a security clearance. She  only knows
that Applicant does construction engineering but not exactly what his job entails. She only

mother about once a week.9
One of his sisters, a chemical engineer, teaches science and chemistry at the Arab
Academy for Science and Technology. The Academy is a private school. Applicant’s sister
has no ties to the Egyptian government or the military.
Applicant’s other sister has an administrative position with the Egyptian consulate in
Bahrain.  It  is  not  a  political  appointment  but  is  a  civil  service  position.  His  sisters  know
nothing  about  him  seeking  a  security  clearance.  They  only  know  that  Applicant  does
construction engineering but not exactly what his job entails. They only know that at some
point Applicant was working on an embassy project. He speaks to them about every two to
four weeks. Applicant sees them when he visits his mother about once every year.10
Applicant sees his mother-in-law about once a year, when he visits his mother. His
mother-in-law has no ties to the Egyptian government or military. She does not know about
Applicant seeking a security clearance and does not know about his work for the United
States government. He speaks to her about every two to three weeks. Applicant has never
given his mother-in-law any financial support.11
Applicant’s sister-in-law is a physician with the Ministry of Health. She specializes in
infection control. Her spouse is a retired physician from the Ministry of Health. He has been
retired for about seven to eight years. Applicant visits his sister-in-law  when he visits his
mother.  Other  than  that  he  speaks  with  his  sister-in-law  about  once  a  month  or  less.
Applicant  speaks  only  infrequently  to  her spouse.  Applicant  has never provided  financial
support  to  his  sister-in-law  or  her  spouse.  She  and  her  spouse  have  no  ties  to  the
government or the military. They do not know about Applicant’s application for a security
clearance or the work he does for the United States government.12
Applicant testified about his real property and financial holdings in Egypt. He owns
two apartments. The first apartment (Apt. 1) was alleged to be worth about $70,000.13 That
is not currently an accurate evaluation of Apt. 1. Applicant sold that property in July of this

year because he no longer needed it and could use the proceeds on the new home he is
buying here. The sale price was $49,000.14
The second apartment (Apt. 2) was alleged to be worth about $125,000.15 That is not
currently an accurate evaluation of Apt. 2. Because of the economic situation in Egypt and
the depreciation of the Egyptian pound, Applicant estimated that its current value is between
$60,000 and $70,000. Apt. 2 was a gift from his father (now deceased). Egyptian custom is
that  the  father  gives  his  son  the  gift  of  an  apartment  (if  he  can  afford  it).  In  any  event,
Applicant has not tried to sell Apt. 2, because he wants to keep it as a place to stay when
he and his family visit.16
Along with his mother and his two sisters, Applicant is a co-owner of a home that was
alleged to be worth approximately $15,000.17 That is not currently an accurate evaluation.
Because of the depreciation of the Egyptian pound and that the home’s roof has collapsed,
it  is  now  worth  about  $8,000.  Of  that  value,  Applicant’s  mother  would  take  the  first  one-
eighth, Applicant would take half of the remainder, with his sisters sharing the other half of
the remainder. That works out to be about $3,500 going to Applicant.18
Applicant  testified  about  his  two  bank  accounts  alleged  to  have  a  value  of  about
$40,000.19 Applicant testified that he closed those two accounts, one in 2016 and the other
in 2017.20
Applicant testified about his bank certificates and savings bonds alleged to be worth
about  $16,000.21  The  value  of  those  instruments  have  depreciated  to  less  than  half  that
amount  because  of  the  depreciation  of  the  Egyptian  pound.  They  are  now  worth  about
$6,000. Those instruments are in Egyptian pounds, which makes it very hard to convert to
U.  S.  dollars.  When  economic  conditions  improve,  Applicant  intends  to  close  those
accounts.22

Applicant testified about the bank certificates alleged to be worth about $16,000.23
These were gifts from Applicant’s mother-in-law to his two children. Again, because of the
depreciation  of  the  Egyptian  pound,  those  certificates  are  now  worth  about  $7,000  or
$8,000. Those certificates are in the name of his children.24
Applicant  testified  about  the  two  bank  accounts  his  wife  maintains  in  Egypt,  one
alleged to have a value of about $14,000 and the second with a value of about $50,000.25
His wife closed the first account in July of this year. The second account has been devalued
due to the depreciation of the Egyptian pound. It is now worth about $23,000 to $27,000.26
By  my  calculation,  Applicant’s  Egyptian  assets  alleged  in  SOR  totaled  $354,000.
Based on Applicant’s testimony, either by closing some of those accounts or by virtue of
currency devaluation (or a combination of both), his current Egyptian assets total between
$149,000  and  $163,500.27  Of  that  amount,  $7,000  to  $8,000  are  gifts  (bank  certificates)
from his mother-in-law to his two children, which are held in their names, not Applicant’s
name.28
Applicant’s  average  salary  is  between  $180,000  and  $190,000  annually,  although
this year his business has picked up and he might make between $250,000 and $300,000.29
Applicant’s  wife  is  a  civil  engineer  for  a  defense  contractor,  and  she  makes  between
$140,000 and $150,000 a year including a bonus.30 Applicant has a 401k plan with about

Egypt
Egypt is a geopolitical partner of the United States, and those two countries have
had strong economic and security relationships since 1979. They have worked in tandem
to combat global terrorism and violent extremism. In 2015, Egypt and the United States
held a Strategic Dialogue to strengthen the security cooperation between them.
The United States Department of State warns U.S. citizens of threats from terrorist
groups in Egypt and to consider the risks of travel to the country. U.S. citizens have been
kidnapped  and  murdered  by  terrorist  and  extremist  groups.  Several  terrorist  groups,
including  ISIS,  have  committed  multiple  deadly  attacks  in  Egypt,  targeting  government
officials,  security  forces,  public  venues,  tourist  sites,  civil  aviation  and  other  modes  of
public transportation, along with diplomatic facilities. U.S. citizens remain at risk as ISIS
uses  kidnapping  for ransom to finance  their  operations.  Due  to  security  concerns,  U.S.
diplomatic  personnel  are  prohibited  from  travel  to  parts  of  Egypt  and  U.S.  citizens  are
warned to avoid those areas.
Extremist  organizations  operate  in  Egypt  and  ISIS  has  called  on  supporters  to
attack  U.S.  citizens  and  coalition  partners.  ISIS  media  has  threatened  that  places
associated  with  Westerners,  Christians,  the  Egyptian  military  and  police,  and  Egyptian
government facilities  could be  struck at any  time.  Authorities  believe  there  is continued
likelihood  of  such  potential  attacks.  These  terrorist  groups  use  conventional  and
nonconventional weapons to target U.S. Government interests and private interests.
Egypt’s  human  rights  problems  involve  the  excessive  use  of  force  by  security
forces, including unlawful killings and torture; and deficiencies in due process, including
excessive  use  of  preventive  custody  and  pretrial  detention,  use  of  military  courts  to  try
civilians, trials of hundreds of defendants in which authorities did not present evidence on
an  individual  basis,  suppression  of  civil  liberties,  including  societal  and  government
restrictions on freedom of expression, the press, and peaceful assemble and association.
There are also problems with arbitrary arrests; a politically motivated judiciary; restrictions
on  academic  freedom;  impunity  for  security  forces;  limits  on  religious  freedom;  and
violence, harassment, and societal discrimination against women and girls.35

located in the United States, but that employment ended in December 2016. (Answer ¶¶
1. and 2.)
Applicant  testified  about  her  service  as  a  linguist  for  U.  S.  troops  in  Iraq.  She
started working as a linguist in Iraq at about 18 or 19 years of age. Applicant is fluent in
Arabic and English. Because of force-protection requirements, Applicant had to live and
work on base with U.S. troops. She could not leave the base, and her relatives could not
visit  her  on  base.  She  was  not  allowed  to  speak  with  her  relatives  while  working  as  a
linguist. Thus, from 2003 to 2007, she had little contact with her relatives while working
as a liguist. Although the durations of deployments varied, on average one deployment
was about 9 to 11 months straight. She left Iraq after having worked as linguist for U.S.
troops  in  Iraq  from  2003  to  2007.  Applicant  came  to  the  United  States  on  a  special
immigrant visa and was fast-tracked to naturalization due to her service as a linguist for
U. S. troops. Applicant’s resume details her six deployments to Iraq as a linguist from May
2003 to present. Those six deployments add up to more than six years spent in Iraq in
the service of U. S. troops and coalition forces. From March 2012 to April 2014, Applicant
worked for a defense contractor state-side training over 4,000 DOD and Department of
State employees in Iraqi and Middle Eastern culture. (Tr. 17-20, 42, 75-78; AE A.) She
was  on  deployment  to  Iraq  when  she  received  the  SOR  and  returned  to  the  U.S.  to
prepare  for  this  hearing.  (Tr.  43-44.)  Since  Applicant’s  arrival  in  the  United  States  in
September 2007, she has maintained her residences in the United States. (GE 1, pp. 12-
15; GE 2, pp. 9-11.)
Applicant  testified  about  her  contacts  with  her  immediate  family  members.  She
saw her siblings that are the subject of the SOR, when Applicant left Iraq in 2007 and
more recently in 2008 or 2009. The last time Applicant saw her mother was in 2010 or
2011, when Applicant and her then husband met her mother in Turkey, so that her mother
could meet Applicant’s then new-born son. Before that meeting, Applicant saw her mother
in 2007 and in 2008 or 2009. (GE 2, p. 42; Tr. 58-59, 78-79.)
When  Applicant  completed  her  most  recent  security  clearance  application
(September 2016), she was telephoning her mother and her oldest sister daily or every
two or three days. Applicant spoke with her oldest brother and her younger sister about
monthly and her youngest brother annually. Applicant’s calls to her mother and siblings
became  much  less  frequent.  There  are  two  reasons  for  that.  First,  Applicant  and  her
mother had a falling out. Applicant believed that her mother delayed an unseemly length
of time before notifying her that her father had passed away. Applicant missed her father’s
funeral. It angered Applicant, and she decided to stop talking to her mother. She has not
spoken  to her mother since  her father’s  death  in  October 2017.  Second,  in  December
2017, she received the SOR and interpreted it to mean that the U. S. Government did not
want her to talk to the family members identified in the SOR. Applicant did not want to
jeopardize her job, which she loves, and her life in the United States, which she loves and
considers this country to be her home.  So, she decided to stop communications with her
immediate family. She has no problem with that. Applicant did not tell her family why she
stopped  communicating  with  them.  Nor  did  she  tell  any  family  members  that  she  was
seeking a security clearance, and they do not know what she does for a living. (GE 1; Tr.
24-25, 28-30, 37-38, 51-55, 60-62, 65-67.)
Applicant testified about her oldest sister and her immediate younger sister who
the  SOR  alleged  were  deemed  by  an  Army  intelligence  command  in  May  2009  to  be
security  risks.  (GE  3  supports  those  allegations.)  Applicant  had  no  idea  about  those
allegations. She hopes they are not true. The first Applicant ever heard of such allegations
was when she received the SOR. She was only told by family that one or both of those
sisters  were  laid  off.  (Tr.  30-32,  63-64.)  GE  4  reports  on  an  October  27,  2016
counterintelligence screening of Applicant that confirmed that those individuals were her
sisters. Applicant had disclosed that fact in her “Relatives and Associates” form. As noted,
Applicant also disclosed that fact in her 2015 and 2016 security clearance applications.
The  frequency  of  telephone  contacts  Applicant  had  with  those  two  sisters  were
approximately the same in 2015 and 2016. (GE 1, pp. 32-43; GE 2, pp. 24-35.)
The family member alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g is Applicant’s youngest sister. Applicant
has not seen her since about 2007. She is about 19 years old and is either a student in
high school or in the first year of college. Applicant and this sister do not talk at all. (Tr.
32-34.) Applicant explained that when filling out her security clearance applications she
had to call her mother, because Applicant did not have first-hand knowledge of her family
members’ ages, marital status, and whether there were any nieces or nephews. (Tr. 80-
81.)
Applicant  testified  about  her employment  by  the  Saudi Arabian  Cultural Mission
from April 2014 to December 2016. She was an administrative assistant providing general
administrative and clerical support. Applicant said that the Cultural Mission and the Saudi
Arabian  Embassy  have  different  missions  and  have  different  locations  in  the  United
States. Unlike the traditional embassy mission, the Cultural Mission provides assistance
to Saudi Arabian students who are coming on a scholarship to study in the United States
for two years and then return home. Applicant left that job to take her current job with a
defense contractor. (Tr. 35-37; AE A.)
Applicant testified that she has no financial interests, real estate, or bank accounts
in Iraq. Her mother does not own any land in Iraq. Applicant has no retirement accounts
in  Saudi  Arabia.  Applicant  is  not  a  member  of  any  foreign  groups  or  associations.
Applicant  rents  her  home  here.  She  has  checking  and  savings  accounts  in  the  U.S.
Applicant also has 401(k) accounts with two former employers here.  (Tr. 36-37, 42-47;
AE M.) She submitted an affidavit stating her willingness to renounce any dual citizenship
she may be deemed to have with any foreign country. (AE E.)
Applicant testified about her son, who is nine. He loves baseball and is on a team.
Even if Applicant does not have her son on a weekend when he has a game, she attends
anyway to show support. Also, Applicant is teaching him soccer. She has a good working
relationship with her ex-spouse about caring for their son. When Applicant is deployed,
her ex-spouse cares for their son. When Applicant returns, they have joint custody and
share care-taking responsibilities. Applicant participates in the parent teacher association
at her son’s school. (Tr. 41-42, 46, 81-83; AE G, I, K, and R.)
Applicant submitted a number of letters of recommendation. Each of the authors
had first-hand knowledge of Applicant’s performance in the field as a linguist and cultural
advisor. One author is Applicant’s current site manager where Applicant is posted in Iraq.
He described her as “reliable and trustworthy” with “excellent and unmatched work ethic”
who  “performs  her  job  flawlessly.”  Another  unit  leader  who  has  known  Applicant  as  a
linguist in Iraq since October 2017 called her “professional and trustworthy.”
Another one of Applicant’s Iraq site managers wrote that he has worked with over
300 linguists during his Army career and as a defense contractor in Iraq and that Applicant
is the “most loyal, honest, and trustworthy” one that he’s ever worked with. He gave one
example.  Once  in  the  middle  of  the  night  an  emergency  arose  that  needed  a  linguist
immediately. He called Applicant who without a question jumped out of bed, handled the
mission, which took about two hours, and still showed up the next morning to perform her
daily duties. (AE B.)
An officer-in-charge of  a  unit  wrote  that  Applicant’s  “duties  have  covered  a  vast
number  military  subjects  and  cultural  advisory  roles.”  She  “has  consistently  exceeded
expectations.”  A  Senior  Counterintelligence  Support  Specialist  wrote  that  Applicant’s
“professionalism/expertise is in the top 10% of all the linguists I have worked with in the
last 12 years of being in the intelligence field.” (AE J.)
A Marine Colonel commanding officer of a task force penned a handwritten note
on a Certificate of Appreciation awarded to Applicant for a job well-done as a Linguist,
Translator, and Cultural Advisor from March 2017 to August 2017: “Thank you for all of
your hard work for the S-4 [Logistics], but especially with medical. Your linguistic skills
are exceptional and we will miss you.” (AE N.)
I take administrative notice of the following facts concerning Iraq as requested by
the  Government:  Iraq  faces  many  challenges  fueled  by  sectarian and  ethnic divisions.
Numerous terrorist groups and elements hostile to the United States remain active in Iraq.
Iraqi forces, with the assistance of the United States, have seen successes recently and
most of the territory previously held by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIL) has been
retaken. Threats of kidnapping and violence are high, and the Department of State warns
U.S.  citizens  that  all  but  essential  travel  to  Iraq  should  be  avoided.  Although  the
government  of  lraq  has  made  significant  progress  in  its  campaign  to  retake  occupied
territory from ISIL, there remains a security vacuum in parts of Iraq.
The  State  Department  warns  that  anti-U.S.  sectarian  militias  may  also  threaten
U.S. citizens and western companies throughout Iraq. Kidnappings and attacks by means
of improvised explosive devices occur frequently in many areas of the country, including
Baghdad.  Methods  of  attack  have  included  explosively  formed  penetrators,  magnetic
IEDs placed on vehicles, human and vehicle-borne IEDs, mines placed on or concealed
near roads, mortars and rockets, and shootings using various direct fire weapons. Such
attacks often take place in public venues such as cafes and markets.
The  U.S.  government  considers  the  potential  personal  security  threats  to  U.S.
government personnel in Iraq to be serious enough to require them to live and work under
strict security guidelines. All U.S. Government employees under the authority of the U.S.
Chief of Mission must follow strict safety and security procedures when traveling outside
the Embassy and Consulates.
In its annual human rights report, the U.S. Department of State reported that ISIL
committed the overwhelming number of serious human rights abuses, including attacks
against civilians, especially Shia but also Sunnis who opposed ISIL, members of other
religious  and  ethnic minorities,  women,  and children.  ISIL  members  committed acts  of
violence  on  a  mass  scale,  including  killing  by  suicide  bombings,  improvised  explosive
devices,  execution-style  shootings,  public  beheadings,  and  other  forms  of  executions.
Sectarian  hostility,  widespread  corruption,  and  lack  of  transparency  at  all  levels  of
government  and  society  weakened  the  Iraqi  government's  authority  and  worsened
effective human rights protections. (HE 1.)
Law and Policies
It  is  well-established  law  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.
Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (“it should be obvious that no one
has a ‘right’ to a security clearance”); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988,
994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no right to a security clearance).
As noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly
consistent  standard  indicates  that  security  clearance  determinations  should  err,  if  they
must, on the side of denials.” 484 U.S. at 531. Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and
the  Directive,  any  doubt  about  whether  an  applicant  should  be  allowed  access  to
classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information. Directive,
¶  3.2.  An  unfavorable  clearance  decision  (1)  denies  any  application,  (2)  revokes  any
existing security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.
Directive, ¶ 3.2.
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information. ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). The
Government has the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR
that have been controverted. Directive, ¶ E3.1.14.
An applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate,
or  mitigate  facts  that  have  been  admitted  or  proven.  In  addition,  an  applicant  has  the
ultimate  burden  of  persuasion  to  obtain  a  favorable  clearance  decision.  Directive,
Enclosure 3, ¶ E3.1.15. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is
less than a preponderance of evidence. 484 U.S. at 531. The Appeal Board has followed
the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-
evidence standard. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).
Guideline B - Foreign Influence
Discussion
The foreign influence security concern is explained at AG ¶ 6:
Foreign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business,
financial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result
in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they
create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced
to  help  a  foreign  person,  group,  organization,  or  government  in  a  way
inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure
or  coercion  by  any  foreign  interest.  Assessment  of  foreign  contacts  and
interests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest
is located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is
known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or
is associated with a risk of terrorism.
An  individual  is  not  automatically  disqualified  from  holding  a  security  clearance
because they have connections and contacts in a foreign country. Instead, in assessing
an  individual’s  potential  vulnerability  to  foreign  influence,  an  administrative  judge  must
take into account the foreign government involved; the intelligence-gathering history of
that  government;  the  country’s  human-rights  record;  and  other  pertinent  factors.  ISCR
Case No. 05-03250 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2007) (setting forth factors an administrative
judge must consider in foreign influence cases).
The United States and Iraq are allies in the war against ISIL and other terrorists
and insurgents. The serious security threat posed by these terrorists and other elements
hostile to the United States must be taken into account in assessing the security concerns
raised  by  Applicant’s  family  members  in  Iraq.  Applicant’s  relationship  to  her  foreign
relatives,  coupled  with  the  facts  administratively  noticed,  raise  a  heightened  security
concern.
In  assessing  the  security  concern  raised  by  Applicant’s  foreign  contacts  and
interests,  I  have  considered  the  following  disqualifying  conditions  under  AG  ¶  7  and
mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 8:
AG  ¶  7(a):  contact,  regardless  of  method,  with  a  foreign  family  member,
business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen
of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk
of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;
AG ¶ 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country
that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation
to  protect  classified  or  sensitive  information  or  technology  and  the
individual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing
that information or technology;
AG ¶ 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country
in  which  these  persons  are  located,  or  the positions  or activities  of  those
persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed
in  a  position  of  having  to  choose  between  the  interests  of  a  foreign
individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.;
AG  ¶  8(b):  there  is  no  conflict  of  interest,  either  because  the  individual’s
sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or
country  is  so  minimal,  or  the  individual  has  such  deep  and  longstanding
relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected
to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and
AG ¶ 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and
infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign
influence or exploitation.
An individual with family members and other connections in a foreign country faces
a  high,  but  not  insurmountable,  hurdle  in  mitigating  security  concerns  raised  by  such
foreign ties. An applicant is not required, however, “to sever all ties with a foreign country
before he or she can be granted access to  classified information.” ISCR Case No. 07-
13739 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 12, 2008). What factor or combination of factors will mitigate
security concerns raised by an applicant with family members in a foreign country is not
easily identifiable or quantifiable. ISCR Case No. 11-12202 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 23, 2014).
In  the  present  case,  Applicant’s  mother,  three  sisters,  and  two  brothers  are
admittedly citizens and residents of Iraq. Facts admitted by an applicant in an answer to
a SOR require no further proof by the Government. ISCR Case No. 94-1159 at 4 (App.
Bd. Dec. 4, 1995) (“any admissions [applicant] made to the SOR allegations . . . relieve
Department Counsel of its burden of proof”); ISCR Case No. 94-0569 at 4 and n.1 (App.
Bd.  Mar.  30,  1995)  (“[a]n  applicant’s  admissions,  whether  testimonial  or  written,  can
provide a legal basis for an Administrative Judge’s findings”). Therefore, AG ¶¶ 7(a) and
(b) apply. The next inquiry is whether the security concern is mitigated.
Applicant signed up as a linguist and a cultural advisor for U.S. and coalition forces
in Iraq in 2003, when she was about 18 or 19 years of age. The conditions of employment
were, that because of force protection measures, Applicant was required to live and work
alongside of U. S. and coalition troops in Iraq. She was not allowed to communicate in
any way with her immediate family members in Iraq while she was deployed. On average
her deployments to Iraq lasted between 9 and 11 months. Between 2003 and the present,
Applicant served six deployments in Iraq for a cumulative six years or more. That is more
time than many U. S. active duty service members spend in Iraq.
In 2007 Applicant came to the United States and was fast-tracked to naturalization
due to her service as a linguist in Iraq. She was naturalized in 2013. By that time, she had
married  (in  2009  to  a  U.S.  citizen)  and  had  given  birth  to  her  son  (in  2010).  Applicant
continued to make deployments to Iraq as a linguist, returning to the United States after
each deployment for a few months. Although her marriage ended in a divorce in June
2016, the parting was amicable. Her ex-spouse accommodates Applicant’s deployments
by caring for their son, and sharing childcare duties with Applicant when she returns from
her  deployments  to  Iraq. When  Applicant  is  back  from  Iraq  she  is  active  in  the  parent
teacher association of her son’s school. And she supports and encourages the baseball
team he plays for.
Because  of  the  restrictions  placed  on  Applicant’s  communications  with  family
members  while  she  is  deployed  to  Iraq,  over  the  past  16  years  communications  have
been  limited  to  phone  calls  while  Applicant  is  in  the  United  States  in  between
deployments.  Even  those  communications  have  been  curtailed  lately,  for  two  reasons.
First, Applicant and her mother had a falling out in October 2017 when Applicant’s father
died. Applicant was angered because her mother did not tell Applicant promptly about his
death. Applicant vowed not to call her mother or other family members. Second, Applicant
interpreted the SOR as signaling the Government’s disapproval of such communications.
The first reason is a deeply personal and credible one.  A version of the second reason
was argued by Department Counsel, comparing Applicant’s curtailment of phone calls to
a Guideline F (financial considerations) case where applicant makes post-SOR payments
to try to clean up his finances. I respectfully disagree that the analogy is an apt one. The
argument cuts against the DOHA jurisprudence discussed above, that an applicant need
not  sever  all  ties  to  the  foreign  country  of  her  birth  before  being  granted  a  security
clearance. In fact, Applicant’s decision to cut back on phone calls to her immediate family
shows her prudence and appreciation of the security concerns that such contacts might
create.
Applicant’s meetings with family members in Iraq have been rare. She last saw her
siblings in 2008 or 2009, about ten years ago. The last time Applicant saw her mother
was  in  2010  or  2011,  when  Applicant  and  her  then  spouse  traveled  to  Turkey,  so  her
mother could meet their then newborn son.
Applicant  has  no  financial  interests,  real  estate,  or  bank  accounts  in  Iraq.  Her
mother  does  not  own  any  land  in  Iraq.  Applicant  has  no  retirement  accounts  in  Saudi
Arabia. She is not a member of any foreign groups or associations. Applicant rents her
home here. Since Applicant arrived in the United States in 2007, she has maintained her
residences here. She has checking and savings accounts in the U.S. Applicant also has
401(k) accounts with two former employers here. Applicant’s family members do not know
what she does for a living. Nor do they know that she is seeking a security clearance.
Applicant’s  testimony  about  two  of  her  sisters  who  were  deemed  by  an  Army
intelligence command in May 2009 to be security risks was credible. Applicant flatly stated
that she had no knowledge about that situation until she received the SOR in December
2017. She also said that she hoped the allegations were not true but could shed no further
light on those allegations. Moreover, that intelligence finding is over a decade old.
The letters of recommendation submitted on Applicant’s behalf are uniform in their
superlative  praise  of  her  professionalism,  reliability,  and  trustworthiness.  Applicant’s
loyalty  to  the  U.S.  troops  in  Iraq  has  been  manifestly  shown.  Even  before  Applicant
became a United States citizen in 2013, by that time she had supported U. S. troops in
Iraq  for  ten  years.  And  she  is  continuing  that  support to  this  day.  I  find  that  mitigating
conditions AG ¶¶ 8(a) and (b) apply.
Guideline C - Foreign Preference
Under  Guideline  C  for  foreign  preference,  suitability  of  an  applicant  may  be
questioned  or  put  into  doubt  because  he  or  she  acts  in  such  a  way  as  to  indicate  a
preference for a foreign country over the United States:
involvement  raises  concerns  about  an
When an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for
a  foreign  country  over  the  United  States,  then  he  or  she  may  provide
information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United
individual's
States.  Foreign
judgment,  reliability,  and  trustworthiness  when  it  is  in  conflict  with  U.S.
national interests or when the individual acts to conceal it. By itself; the fact
that a  U.S.  citizen  is also  a  citizen  of  another country  is not  disqualifying
without  an  objective  showing  of  such  conflict  or  attempt  at  concealment.
The  same  is  true  for  a  U.S.  citizen's  exercise  of  any  right  or  privilege  of
foreign  citizenship  and  any  action  to  acquire  or  obtain  recognition  of  a
foreign citizenship. (AG ¶¶ 9, 10, and 11 (setting forth the concern and the
disqualifying and mitigating conditions).)
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  potentially
disqualifying and mitigating conditions:
AG ¶ 10(d) participation in foreign activities, including but not limited to:
(1) assuming or attempting to assume any type of employment, position, or
political office in a foreign government or military organization; and
(2)  otherwise  acting  to  serve  the  interests  of  a  foreign  person,  group,
organization,  or  government  in  any  way  that  conflicts  with  U.S.  national
security interests;
AG ¶ 11(a) the foreign citizenship is not in conflict with U.S. national security
interests;
10
AG ¶ 11(b) dual citizenship is based solely on parental citizenship or birth in a
foreign country, and there is no evidence of foreign preference;
AG ¶ 11(c) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce the foreign
citizenship that is in conflict with U.S. national security interests; and
AG ¶ 11 (g) civil employment or military service was authorized under U.S. law, or
the employment or service was otherwise consented to as required by U.S. law.
Applicant admitted that from April 2014 until December 2016 she was employed by
the Saudi Arabian cultural mission in the United States performing administrative tasks.
That  period  of  employment  began  five  years  ago  and  at  a  time  when  Applicant  had
become a naturalized U. S. citizen. Nevertheless, AG ¶ 10(d)(1) is sufficiently broad to
encompass such employment as a potentially disqualifying condition. The next inquiry is
whether any mitigating conditions apply.
Iraq and the United States have been allies since 2003, when we invaded Iraq to
overthrow the Hussein government.  That was the same year that Applicant signed up as
a  linguist  and  cultural  advisor  supporting  U.  S.  and  coalition  forces.  At  that  time,
Applicant’s Iraqi citizenship, based on her parents’ citizenship and being born in Iraq, was
apparently not deemed to be in conflict with U. S. national security interests. Applicant’s
most evident preference, then and now, was to serve American interests. She has stated
her intent to renounce any dual citizenship she may have with a foreign country. Finally,
it is fair to assume that Saudi Arabia’s cultural mission was authorized to employ U. S.
citizens, which Applicant was by 2014. I find that AG ¶¶ 11(a) through (c), and (g) apply.
The  evidence  of  Applicant’s  family  ties  to  Iraq  does  not  raise  doubts  about  her
reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In
reaching  this  conclusion,  I  weighed  the  evidence  as  a  whole  and  considered  if  the
favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due
consideration  to  the  whole-person  concept.  (AG  ¶¶  2(d)(1)-(9)  and  2(f)(1)-(6).)
Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant has met her ultimate burden of persuasion to show
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to
classified information.
As required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following
formal findings on the SOR allegations:
Paragraph 1, Guideline B:
For Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.g:                   For Applicant
11
Paragraph 2, Guideline C
For Applicant
Subparagraph 2.a:
For Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to
grant Applicant access to classified information.

2009. Her husband was also born in India. He immigrated to the United States in 1998,
and he also became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2009. Both Applicant and her husband
consider themselves solely U.S. citizens.4
Applicant’s  father,  six  sisters,  brother,  mother-in-law,  and  father-in-law  are
citizens and residents of India (SOR ¶ 1.a). Her mother died in 1995. She testified that
none  of  her  family  members  in  India  have  ever  had  ties  to  the  Indian  government  or
military. She travels to India once every two years to visit her family there, and she did
so in 2010, 2012, 2014, 2017, and 2018. She testified that she has reported all of her
foreign travels to her security officer, as required. She and her  husband  indicated that
none of her foreign family members are aware that she has a public trust position, and
are  only  generally  aware  that  she  works  in  the  information  technology  field  as  a
software tester.5
Applicant’s  father  is  80  years  old.  He  was  formerly  self-employed.  He  owns
farming  land  in  India  worth  approximately  $70,000  USD.  Applicant  testified  that  her
brother  would  inherit  her  father’s  land  when  her  father  passes  away.  She  maintains
biweekly  to  monthly  telephone  contact  with  her  father,  and  she  gives  him  $150  once
yearly.6
Applicant’s  six  sisters  are  ages  61,  58,  56,  54,  52,  and  50.  They  are  all
homemakers.  Their  husbands  work  for  private  companies--one  runs  a  publication
business, another runs a product supply business, one works in education, one works in
a  private  bank,  one  works  as  an  accountant,  and  one  is  retired  from  a  private
newspaper. Applicant maintains biweekly to monthly contact with her sisters. Applicant’s
brother  is  46  years  old  and  works  for  a  private  company.  He  lives  with  their  father.
Applicant maintains monthly contact with her brother, and she gives him approximately
$100 to $200 once every two years.7
Applicant’s  mother-in-law  and  father-in-law  are  approximately  70  and  74  years
old,  respectively.  They  are  both  retired  from  the  same  private  company,  where
Applicant’s  mother-in-law  was  a  typist  and  her  father-in-law  was  a  clerk.  They  do  not
receive a pension. Applicant maintains bimonthly telephonic contact with them, and her
husband  talks  to  his  parents  once  biweekly  to  monthly.  Applicant’s  husband  travels  to
India  to  visit  his  parents  once  every  three  to  five  years,  and  he  last  did  so  in  2017.
Applicant and her husband occasionally provide them with financial support, as further
discussed below.8

Applicant and her husband have financial interests in India totaling approximately
$75,000.  She  has  two  bank  accounts  in  India  that  she  uses  to  pay  for  her  expenses
when  she  travels  there.  The  combined  balance  on  both  accounts  was  $2,000  USD  at
the  time  of  her  October  2017  security  clearance  application  (SCA),  and  it  was  $1,020
USD  as  of  the  date  of  the  hearing.  Her  husband  has  a  bank  account  in  India  that  his
parents use to pay for their medical and daily living expenses. He also uses it to pay for
his expenses when he travels to India. Its balance at the time of her SCA was $28,000
USD,  and  it  was  $24,000  USD  as  of  the  date  of  the  hearing.  Applicant’s  husband
intends  to  close  his  bank  account  in  India  when  he  no  longer  needs  it  to  pay  for  his
parents’  expenses.  He  also  owns  one  property  in  India.  He  purchased  it  for
approximately  $12,000  USD  in  1999,  before  he  and  Applicant  were  married,  for  his
parents to live. Its value as of the date of the hearing was $50,000 USD. Applicant and
her husband intend to sell this property when his parents no longer need to live in it, and
invest the money from the sale in the United States.9
Applicant testified that neither she nor her husband intend to return to India in the
future to live, as their life is in the United States. She also testified that they are loyal to
the  United  States.  Their  assets  in  the  United  States  total  approximately  $1.9  million.
This  includes  their  two  homes--their  primary  residence  and  rental  property  that  they
purchased in 2017 and 2014, respectively; their combined annual income of $200,000;
and their retirement and investment accounts.10
Applicant has not had any unfavorable issues at work, and she has completed all
requisite annual training. She testified that she would report any attempts to blackmail
her  or  her  family  in  India  to  the  proper  authorities.  Prior  to  holding  her  current  public
trust position, she was a homemaker from 2001 through 2009. She then worked in the
public  school  system  for  several  years  from  2009  to  2016.  She  is  involved  in  her
community, to include serving as her children’s Girl Scouts treasurer.11
Applicant’s supervisor and project manager since 2016 described Applicant as a
good  worker.  Her  coworker  since  November  2016  testified  that  Applicant  is  an
exceptional team lead, a driven and detail-oriented worker, and an honest and likeable
individual. A former coworker from the public school system, and a friend of Applicant of
ten years, described Applicant as possessing a strong work ethic and an individual who
is loyal to the United States. Individuals who know Applicant from Girl Scouts described
her as an honest person.12

India
India  and  seven  other  countries  were  identified,  in  a  2008  Annual  Report  to
Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage, as being involved
in  economic  and  industrial  espionage.  In  its  2009  to  2011  Report  to  Congress,  the
Office  of  the  National  Counterintelligence  Executive  reported  that  sensitive  U.S.
economic information and technology are targeted by the intelligence services, private
sector, and citizens of dozens of countries, to include U.S. allies and its partners. The
U.S.  Department  of  Justice  identified  numerous  criminal  cases  concerning  export
enforcement  related  to  proprietary  defense  information,  economic  espionage,  theft  of
trade  secrets,  and  embargo-related  criminal  prosecutions  involving  both  the  Indian
government as well as private companies and individuals in India.
Anti-Western  terrorist  groups,  including  some  on  the  U.S.  Government’s  list  of
foreign terrorist organizations, are active in India, and the DOS warns U.S. citizens that
India  continues  to  experience  terrorist  and  insurgent  activities  that  may  affect  U.S.
citizens  directly  or  indirectly.  The  South  Asian  Terrorism  Portal,  run  by  the  nonprofit
Institute for Conflict Management, reported fatalities during the first half of 2017 due to
terrorism and insurgency in India.
India  continues  to  experience  significant  human  rights  abuses.  In  its  2018
annual human rights report for India, the DOS identified the following as India’s most
significant  human  rights  problems:  police  and  security  force  abuses;  widespread
corruption; reports of political prisoners in certain states; instances of censorship and
harassment  of  media  outlets  including  some  critical  of  the  government;  and  a  lack  of
accountability  for  misconduct  at  all  levels  of  government,  contributing  to  widespread
impunity.
The  Central  Monitoring  System  (CMS)  in  India,  a  mass  electronic  surveillance
data-mining  program  installed  by  a  government-owned  center,  continued  to  allow
governmental  agencies  to  monitor  electronic  communication  in  real  time  without
informing  the  subject  or  a  judge.    The  CMS  also  provides  agencies  with  centralized
access  to  the  telecommunications  network,  the  ability  to  hear  and  record  mobile,
landline,  satellite,  and  Voice  over  Internet  Protocol  phone  calls,  read  private  e-mails
and text messages, and track geographical locations of people in real time.

"In  his  response,  Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations  with  comments,
except  for  SOR  ¶  1.i  (owning  property  in  Taiwan),  which  he  denied.  Applicant’s  SOR
admissions, and those at his hearing, are hereby incorporated into my findings of fact.
After  a  complete  and  thorough  review  of  the  evidence  of  record,  I  make  the  following
additional findings of fact:
Applicant  is  a  53-year-old  mechanical  engineer  working  for  a  federal  contractor
since 2014. This is his first clearance application. He was born, raised, and educated in
Taiwan. He voted in Taiwanese elections in 1985. He received a bachelor’s degree from
a Taiwanese university in 1987.
While  in  college,  Applicant  participated  in  a  Taiwanese  military  officer  training
program for a two-year period. Upon graduation from college, he was commissioned as
a second lieutenant in the Taiwanese military. Applicant performed compulsory military
service for two years and was discharged as a second lieutenant. He claimed he neither
receives  nor  is  entitled  to  any  benefits  from  the  Taiwanese  military  as  a  result  of  his
service. Applicant denied maintaining any contact with anyone in the Taiwanese military
or government.
Applicant entered the United States in 1990. He married a Taiwanese citizen in
the United States in 1992. They have two daughters born in the United States, ages 23
and  20.  Both  of  his  daughters  are  dual  citizens  of  Taiwan  and  the  United  States.
Applicant sent his daughters to live in Taiwan with their grandparents during extended
periods  of  time  when  they  were  babies.  He  and  his  wife  were  working  and  attending
school  and  they  needed  help  to  care  for  their  children.  His  daughters’  Taiwanese
citizenship allowed them to stay in Taiwan for extended periods.
Applicant obtained a master’s degree from a U.S. university in 1993. He became
a naturalized U.S. citizen and received his U.S. passport in 2007. When asked whether
he had renounced his Taiwanese citizenship, Applicant responded he did not know he
needed  to  renounce  it.  (GE  1)  Applicant  is  a  dual  citizen  of  the  United  States  and
Taiwan. In his SOR answer, Applicant stated that his wife is a dual citizen of the United
States and Taiwan. At hearing, he testified he was not sure whether his wife is a citizen
of Taiwan, or whether she has been or is a member of any foreign organization. (Tr. 30,
32, 48)
Applicant  travelled  to  Taiwan  to  visit  his  family  every  year  or  every  other  year
since  he  immigrated  to  the  United  States  in  1990.  (Tr.  63)  He  used  his  Taiwanese
passport to travel to Taiwan in 2009, 2010, 2011, and twice in 2012. Applicant renewed
his Taiwanese passport in 2011, through a Taiwanese agency in the United States. His
Taiwanese passport will not expire until 2021. He surrendered his Taiwanese passport
to his facility security officer (FSO) for safekeeping. When asked whether he could pick
up his passport when needed, Applicant stated “I don’t know if I can do that.” However,
he  had  recently  picked  up  his  Taiwanese  passport  from  his  FSO  at  the  request  of  a
government  investigator  before  his  background  interview.  Applicant  and  his  wife
travelled to Taiwan in 2016 and 2017 to visit family and friends. They travelled to China
in 1989, 2014, and April 2018. (Tr. 64)
Applicant’s 79-year-old mother is wheelchair-bound. She retired as a high school
teacher.  His  father,  85,  takes  care  of  his  mother.  Both  are  citizens  and  residents  of
Taiwan. Applicant’s father served in the Taiwanese military for many years and retired
with  a  high-level  rank.  According  to  Applicant’s  testimony,  his  father’s  work  led  him  to
official  interactions  with  federal  contractors  and  U.S.  military  personnel.  On  one  of
Applicant’s exhibits, his father is identified as a Chinese colonel conducting negotiations
with  a  federal  contractor.  (AE  1(M))  His  parents  visited  Applicant  in  the  United  States
about five years ago. (Tr. 28)
Applicant claimed he did not know how long his father served in the Taiwanese
military  before  he  retired,  or  what  his  father’s  duties  were,  other  than  repairing  jet
engines.  When  asked  whether  his  father  maintains  any  contact  with  anyone  in  the
Taiwanese military or government, Applicant replied that he did not believe so, but that
he did not know. (Tr. 55)
Applicant  stated  in  his  2016  SCA  that  he  communicates  with  his  parents  on  a
weekly basis via electronic and telephonic means, and his last in-person contact was in
January 2016. At his hearing, Applicant testified that he communicates with his parents
once every three months, and he last travelled to Taiwan in 2017. (Tr. 28)
Applicant  has  a  sister,  born  in  Taiwan,  who  is  a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen.  She
resides  in  the  United  States,  is  married,  and  works  as  a  music  teacher.  His  last  in-
person  contact  with  her  was  in  2017,  when  they  both  travelled  to  Taiwan  to  visit  their
parents.  He  communicates  with  her  once  every  three  months  via  electronic  and
telephonic  means.  Applicant  does  not  know  whether  his  sister  ever  worked  for  the
Taiwanese military or its government. (Tr. 58-59)
Applicant’s mother-in-law is 78 years old. She is a widower and a resident-citizen
of Taiwan. In his 2016 SCA, Applicant indicated that he communicates with his mother-
in-law  once  every  three  months  via  electronic  and  telephonic  means,  and  his  last  in-
person  contact  was  in  2017.  His  father-in-law  is  deceased.  Applicant  denied  knowing
what  his  father-in-law’s  occupation  was  before  he  died.  He  stated  in  his  SOR  answer
that  his  mother-in-law  never  worked.  During  his  testimony,  Applicant  claimed  not
knowing how frequently his wife contacts her mother, whether his mother-in-law worked
for  the  Taiwanese  military  or  the  Taiwanese  government,  or  whether  she  owns  any
property in Taiwan. (Tr. 56-57, 64) He also claimed not knowing whether his wife has a
Taiwanese passport. (Tr. 65)
Applicant  performed  volunteer  work  at  a  Chinese  language  school  and  an
association,  helping  with  their  administrative  workload.  Both  organizations  teach
Chinese language to Chinese people in the United States. According to Applicant, their
objective  is  to  “promote  multi-culturalism  in  the  United  States.”  (Tr.  29-30)  He
volunteered  at  the  school  between  1998  and  2017.  He  volunteered  at  the  association
between 2011 and 2013. Both organizations deal mostly with Chinese citizens living in
the United States.
Applicant  does  not intend  to  return  to  live in  Taiwan.  He  testified  that his family
(wife  and  daughters),  his  job,  and  his  life  are  in  the  United  States.  He  considers  the
United States his home. (Tr. 30) He noted that he has lived in the United States for 30
years and all of his assets and investments are in the United States (his and his wife’s
job,  their  savings,  real  estate, and  retirement  accounts). Applicant has  a  pension from
his  employer,  and  large  retirement  and  savings  accounts  in  the  United  States.  He
denied  owning  any  investments,  properties,  or  bank  accounts  in  Taiwan  or  any  other
foreign country.
Applicant  stated  in  his  2016  SCA  that  he  received  a  house  in  Taiwan  as  a  gift,
with an estimated value of $10,000, in 1985. At hearing, he modified his statement and
testified  that  he  mistakenly  believed  his  parents  had  purchased  their  residence  in
Taiwan under his name to avoid a possible inheritance tax. Applicant claimed that upon
realizing the property raised security concerns, he asked his parents about the property.
He  claimed  his  parents  informed  him  that  they  did  not  purchase  their  home  under  his
name and that the house was not his property. (Tr. 39)
Applicant’s reference has known Applicant since June 2015. Initially, they worked
together in several important projects, and later Applicant worked under his supervision.
Applicant  was  described  as  meticulous,  reliable,  devoted  to  his  family,  and  incredibly
dedicated  to  his  work.  His  reference  believes  Applicant  and  his  family  are  good  U.S.
citizens and strongly supports approval of his clearance. (AE 1, S)
I  take  administrative  notice  of  the  following  facts  concerning  the  Republic  of
China  (Taiwan).  The  1979  United  States  –  People’s  Republic  of  China  Joint
Communique  switched  diplomatic  recognition  from  Taipei  to  Beijing.  In  the  Joint
Communique, the United States recognized the government of the People's Republic of
China as the sole legal government of China, acknowledging the Chinese position that
there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China. The Joint Communique also stated
that  the  people  of  the  United  States  will  maintain  cultural,  commercial,  and  other
unofficial  relations  with  the  people  of  Taiwan.  The  United  States  and  Taiwan  enjoy  a
robust  unofficial  relationship;  however,  the  United  States  does  not  support  Taiwan’s
independence.
The  Director  of  National  Intelligence  has  determined  that,  in  2017,  the  leading
state intelligence threats to U.S. interests will continue to be Russia and China, based
on their services' capabilities, intent, and broad operational scope.
According to the National Counterintelligence Executive, ""Chinese actors are the
world's  most  active  and  persistent  perpetrators  of  economic  espionage,""  and  are
considered  ""aggressive  and  capable  collectors  of  sensitive  U.S.  economic  information
and  technology.""  Importantly,  ""China's  intelligence  services,  as  well  as  private
companies  and  other  entities,  frequently  seek  to  exploit  Chinese  citizens  or  persons
with family ties to China who can use their insider access to corporate networks to steal
trade secrets using removable media devices or e-mail.""
There  have  been multiple  cases  involving  the  illegal  export,  or attempted  illegal
export,  of  U.S.  restricted,  dual-use  technology  to  Taiwan.  The  dual-use  technologies
that  have  been  targeted  include:  classified  materials;  Bryant  center  hole  grinder,  LED
road lights, and an oil pump (in support of North Korea's weapons of mass destruction
and  advanced  weapons  programs);  drones,  surveillance  airplanes,  and  stealth
technology  relating  to  fighter  planes  exported  to  China;  circuit  boards;  weapons-grade
carbon fiber; U.S. missile components (circular hermetic connectors and glass to metal
seals) were exported to Iran by way of Taiwan.
Taiwan  is  a  global  partner  to  the  United  States  and  shares  much  of  the  same
human rights and economic views.
",False
"In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  she  admitted  one  of  the  allegations,  with
explanations (SOR 2.a). She denied the remaining  two allegations (SOR 1.a and 2.b).
Her  admission  is  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  61  years  old.  She  has  worked  for  her  current  federal  contractor-
employer for approximately 20 years, on and off. She is a software development project
manager. She holds bachelor’s and MBA degrees. She is a native-born U.S. citizen and
has  always  resided  in  this  country.  She  has  lived  in  her  current  location  for  over  30
years. She has been married over 30 years and has two adult sons. She previously held
a public trust position when she worked for another government agency. (Tr. at 26-27,
30-31, 33; GE 1.)
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant’s  former  employment  as  the  vice  president  of
government  sector  systems  engineering  with  Company  1  (C1), a company  with  ties  to
Russian  intelligence  and  the  Russian  government,  created  a  conflict  of  interest  and  a
heightened  risk  of  exploitation  (SOR  1.a);  the  SOR  also  alleged  that  Applicant
maintained  her  employment  with  C1  from  March  2014  through  January  2015  despite
knowing that C1 may be affiliated with the Russian government or Russian intelligence,
and  that  her former  employment  with  C1  creates  an  ongoing  potential for a  conflict  of
interest and could create an increased security risk (SOR 2.a-2.b).
Sometime  before  March  2014,  a  former  coworker  of  Applicant’s  reached  out  to
her to see if she would be interested in a position with a new company (C1) for which he
was  the  general  manager.  Applicant  understood  C1  to  be  a  services  company,  which
“sold” its  customers consulting  support.  C1 was  a  registered  U.S.  company.  Its parent
company was C2 and was also a U.S. registered company. C2’s parent company was
C3,  which  was  identified  as  a  Russian  company.  C2  and  C3  were  software  sales
companies.  C1  did  not  sell  software.  Applicant  accepted  the  position  and  was  hired  in
March  2014  as  the  Vice  President,  Government  Sector  Systems  Engineering.  Her
salary was approximately $165,000 per year, up from approximately $135,000 that she
earned  from  her  last  employer.  Since  C1  was  a  brand  new  company  with  no  existing
clientele, the first several months of the job entailed Applicant setting up and organizing
the  office.  At  the  time,  C1  had  a  total  of  four  employees:  the  general  manager,
Applicant, another vice president who served as the general manager’s deputy, and an
office manager who had the title of operations manager. (Tr. at 37-40, 42; Ans.; GE 2;
AE A)
Applicant credibly testified that while she worked for C1  it was unable to secure
any contracts. She believed that C1 was funded by C2 or C3 during this time, although
she  had  no  personal  involvement  with  C2  or  C3.  Her  general  manager  required
Applicant  to  attend  C3’s  annual  meeting  in  June  2014,  which  was  held  in  Russia.
Applicant was there to attend events, she was not a presenter or speaker. Her general
manager made presentations at some seminars. She did not make any acquaintances
at  this  meeting.  Applicant  became  concerned  about  working  for  C1  when  her  general
manager  told  her  of  an  encounter  he  had  during  the  Russia  meeting.  The  general
manager stated that he was invited into the office of someone and noticed a uniform on
display.  He  recognized  it  as  a  possible  former  KGB  (former  Soviet  secret  intelligence
service) uniform. In July 2014 when Applicant got back to the United States and thought
about this disclosure by her general manager, she decided to quit working for C1.  She
did  not  actually  quit  the  job  until  December  2014  and  stopped  being  paid  in  January
2015.  She  explained  this  delay  was  because  she  was  also  teaching  as  an  adjunct
professor at a local university at the time, which did not allow her time to search for a
new  job.  She  was  advised  early  on  in  her working  career to  never quit  a  job  until she
had another job lined up. Her family circumstances at the time were that she was paying
for  her  two  son’s  college  tuitions  and  her  health  insurance  was  through  C1.  She  was
able  to  secure  follow-on  employment  in  February  2015.  Shortly  after  she  left  the
company,  the  general  manager  was  let  go  from  his  position  and  C1  stopped  doing
business. (Tr. at 43-49, 56-59, 73-74; Ans.; GE 2)
In  October  2014,  while  still  employed  by  C1,  Applicant  attended  a  government
cybersecurity  forum  in  the  United  States.  She  participated  as  a  panelist.  The  founder
and CEO of C3 authored the written welcome page to the forum’s written materials, but
he  was  not  in  attendance.  The  forum  was  attended  by  current  and  former  U.S.
government officials. (Tr. at 69-70; GE 3)
In  September  2017,  The  Department  of  Homeland  Security  (DHS)  issued  a
binding  operational  directive  (BOD),  applicable  to  all  federal  agencies,  to  remove  and
discontinue  use  of  any  products  associated  with  C1,  C2,  and  C3  because  of  the  risk
those products create to federal information and information systems. (See 44 U.S.C. §
3552(b)) This BOD became  a final decision  in  December 2017.  Applicant  quit  working
for C1 approximately two and a half years before the issuance of the BOD. Except when
the  operations  manager  called  Applicant  in  February  2015  to  tell  her  she  was  leaving
C1, Applicant has had no contact with C1, C2, or C3, or its former employees since she
quit. She has no family or friends in Russia. She has never had any contacts with any
member  of  the  Russian  government.  Her  only  trip  to  Russia  was  in  June  2014  while
working for C1. (Tr. at 63, 72, 74, 79; GE 6-10; AE K)
Applicant admitted her employment with C1 when completing her trustworthiness
application  and  during  her  interview  with  a  defense  investigator.  She  lists  this
employment on her resume and on her employment-related social media page. She has
never  attempted  to  conceal  her  employment  with  C1  from  the  government.  (Tr.  at  29,
83; AE 1-2, 4)
Applicant documented her financial and community ties to the United States. Her
home  value  is  approximately  $385,000,  with  approximately  $102,000  worth  of  equity.
Her  U.S.  investments  and  insurance  total  approximately  $583,000.  She  is  an  active
member  in  her  local  church,  sings  in  a  community  choir,  participates  in  Habitat  for
Humanity  events,  donates  blood  to  the  Red  Cross,  and  volunteered  to  help  at  a  local

Character Evidence.
Applicant  presented  the  testimony  of  three  character  witnesses.  Witness  one
(W1) is Applicant’s sister-in-law and has known her for 40 years. W1 also worked for a
government agency for 39 years as a senior executive and held a top secret clearance
with sensitive access. Her background and experience has given her specialized insight
to foreign  companies  trying  to  exploit  U.S.  companies for sensitive  information.  She  is
also  aware  of  the  allegations  in  Applicant’s  SOR.  She  was  aware  of  Applicant’s
employed  with  C1  in  2014  and  became  aware  of  Applicant’s  disillusionment  with  her
employment after returning from Russia. Applicant’s values were not the same as those
held by C1. W1 has not witnessed or been apprised of any follow-on contacts between
Applicant  and  C1,  C2,  or C3. W1 believes  Applicant  has  strong  loyalties  to  the  United
States  and  would  trust  her  with  sensitive  or classified  information. W1 also  provided a
sworn affidavit (Tr. at 116-125; AE BB)
Witness two (W2) currently works with Applicant. He is the lead security person
on the DOD contract for his employer and has worked industrial security issues for 15
years.  He  has  also  served  as  the  facilities  security  officer  (FSO).  Part  of  his  duties
included  overseeing  the  company’s  insider  threat  program.  He  has  held  a  security
clearance  for  17  years.  He  also  worked  for  the  U.S.  Secret  Service  for  two  years.
Applicant has always completed her security training on time. Applicant “complies with
our security program and company security rules and has never been the cause of any
security problems.” Applicant has never demonstrated any behavior that would lead W2
to  question  her  personal  integrity  or  loyalty  to  this  country.  W2  also  supplied  a  sworn
affidavit. (Tr. at 128-134; AE AA)
Witness  three  (W3)  has  known  Applicant  for  30  years  and  is  a  close  personal
friend.  W3  is  an  in-house  legal  counsel  to  a  defense  contractor  and  holds  a  security
clearance.  She  is  aware  of  the  allegations  in  Applicant’s  SOR.  Applicant  has  never
shared  any  work-related  sensitive  information  with  W3.  Applicant  is  unquestionably
trustworthy and does what is right. W3 also supplied a sworn affidavit. (Tr. at  136-143;
AE R)
Applicant  also  provided  the  sworn  affidavits  of  19  other  persons  who  are  (or
were) coworkers and friends. All universally opined that she is reliable, responsible, and
trustworthy. (AE N-Q, CC-QQ)
Administrative Notice-Russia.
Russia  has  a  highly  centralized,  weak  multi-party  political system  dominated  by
the president. Russia has significant human-rights problems, marked by restrictions on
civil  liberties,  discrimination,  denial  of  due  process,  forced  confessions,  torture,  other
prisoner  mistreatment,  and  the  government’s  failure  to  prosecute  officials  who  commit
serious  violations.  Government  officials  also  engage  in  electronic  surveillance  without
proper authorization.
Russia is one of the most aggressive countries conducting espionage against the
United  States,  focusing  on  obtaining  proprietary  information  and  advance  weapons
technologies  beneficial  to  Russia’s  military  modernization  and  economic  development.
Russia’s intelligence services as well as private companies and other entities frequently
seek to exploit Russian citizens or persons with family ties to Russia who can use their
insider access to corporate networks to steal secrets. They also have offered financial
inducements  to  U.S.  government  officials  and  citizens  to  encourage  them  to
compromise  classified  information.  Russia’s  attempts  to  collect  U.S.  technological  and
economic information represent a growing and persistent threat to U.S. security. (HE II)
",True
"Applicant admitted the allegations in the SOR. Those admissions are incorporated
into the following findings of fact:
Applicant is 56 years old. He was born in the United States. He served on active
duty in the U.S. Marines from 1981 to 2001, when he retired with an honorable discharge.
He has been married four times and has an adult child from one of those marriages. After
leaving  military  service,  he  worked  for  a  period  of  time  for  a  defense  contractor  and
maintained a security clearance. (Item 2)
Applicant has resided in Thailand since 2004. He opened a bank account in 2005
that has about $30,000 in it. He married his fourth wife there in 2007. She is a citizen and
resident of Thailand. He has two teenage stepchildren, who are citizens and residents of
Thailand. In 2009, he purchased a home in Thailand that has a current value of about
$50,000. The home is recorded in his wife’s name because he is unable to legally own a
residence  there.  From  2010  to  2015,  Applicant  and  his  wife  owned  and  operated  a
business in Thailand. (Item 2)
In  2015,  Applicant  began  working  in  the  Middle  East  for  a  defense  contractor
supporting U.S. military troops. He maintains his residency in Thailand with his wife and
stepchildren. He returns to Thailand on leave and lives there when not working out of the
country. (Items 1, 2)
Applicant’s mother-in-law, sister-in-law, and two brothers-in-law are citizens and
residents  of  Thailand.  Applicant  said  none  of  those  family  members  work  for  the  Thai
government.  He  needs  to  maintain  a  bank  account  there  for  living  expenses  and
purposes. (Items 1, 2)
I  have  taken  administrative  notice  of  facts  contained  in  U.S.  Government
publications concerning Thailand as outlined in Item 5, including the following: Thailand
is  a  constitutional  monarchy,  but  since  a  military  coup  in  2014,  it  is  being  ruled  by  an
interim  military  government.  As  a  consequence  of  that  coup,  the  United  States  has
reduced  its  security  assistance  and  military  engagements  with  Thailand,  although  it
continues  to  maintain  economic  and  diplomatic  ties.  Thailand’s  increasing  economic,
military, and diplomatic ties to China are a concern to the United States. The U.S. State
Department assessed Thailand as having a moderate risk of terrorism based on recent
incidents  in  the  country’s  southern  region.  Thailand’s  human  rights  abuses  include
arbitrary arrests and detention; violence and discrimination against women; sex tourism;
and limitations of worker rights and civil liberties.

"Applicant  is  a  46-year-old  service  desk  analyst  who  has  worked  for  the  same
employer, a defense contractor, for about a year. His salary is approximately $60,000 a
year.  Applicant  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  his  native  Tunisia  and,  since  moving  to
the United States, has earned a master’s degree in information systems. He has been
married  for  over  15  years.  The  couple  has  a  pre-teen  child  attending  a  local  school.
Remaining  in  Tunisia  are  several  relatives  of  Applicant:  his  mother,  two  brothers,  and
three sisters, all of whom are citizens and residents of Tunisia.
Applicant  immigrated  to  this  country  in  1999  from  his  family’s  home  in  a  region
distant from the Libyan border of Tunisia. A few years later, he met his wife, moved to
her  state,  married,  and  started  a  family.  Both  spouses  are  established  professionals,
with  Applicant’s  hairstylist  wife  earning  between  $35,000  and  $45,000  per  year.  They
are current on their bills and taxes, and saving for their future.
Applicant owns no property in Tunisia and has no expectation of any inheritance
based  in  Tunisia.  Applicant  became  a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen  in  2013.  In  2016,  he
believes  he  formally  renounced  his  Tunisian  citizenship  by  surrendering  his  Tunisian
passport to his company. He has not been back to Tunisia in at least three years, when
he  went  to  attend  his  late  father’s  funeral.  (Tr.  30)  He  ceased  sending  any  money  to
relatives  in  Tunisia  in  2017,  when  he  discovered  it  could  raise  trustworthiness
concerns.2 (Tr. 28) He has no bank account abroad. Applicant no longer has a Tunisian
passport,  having  submitted  it  to  his  security  officer  in  2018  for  destruction;  when
traveling, he now only uses his U.S. passport. (Tr. 29; Ex. O). .
In Tunisia, Applicant’s mother, a homemaker and cancer survivor  with recurring
medical  issues,  lives  with  Applicant’s  two  older,  unmarried,  non-working  sisters.  His
mother is about 79 years old. Applicant talks to his mother by telephone “not too often.”
(Tr.  31)  He  makes  irregular  calls  to  her  to  check on  her  health.  She does  not  visit  the
United  States.  Since  learning  that  communication  with  members  of  family  living  in
foreign  countries  or  family  who  are  citizens  of  a  foreign  country  may  raise  security
concerns,  Applicant  has  ceased  contact  and  connection  with  the  rest  of  his  family  in
Tunisia. (Tr. 31, 46-47)
2 Earlier, it was not unusual for Applicant to send his mother about $200 about twice a year. (Tr. 53)
Applicant has one brother who is a private business owner and another brother
who  is  a  high  school  teacher,  although  it  is  unknown  whether  he  is  with  a  private  or
public  institution.  Neither  brother  has  connections  with  the  Tunisian  government  or
military. Applicant has had no contact with his brothers or his sisters since their father’s
early  2016  funeral.3  He  is  not  aware  what,  if  anything,  his  third  and  youngest  sister
does, although he is aware she lives apart from his other siblings and is married. None
of  this  family  knows  what  Applicant  does  for  a  living;  they  only  care  that  he  is  “doing
fine.” (Tr. 33)
Applicant  has  no  plans  to  ever  return  to  his  family  seat  in  Tunisia  or  to  that
country  in  general.  He  noted,  “my  country  is  the  United  States  of America. That  is my
dream since I came here in 1999. . . . All my future is in [sic] here.” (Tr. 35) Applicant is
highly respected by colleagues and friends. Currently in a public trust position, Applicant
has never been in a situation where he or a family member has been exploited.
",True
"Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.g, 1.i, and 2.a. (HE 4)
He also provided mitigating information. (HE 4) His admissions are incorporated herein
as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  complete  and  thorough  review  of  the  evidence  of  record,  I
make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  38-year-old  linguist,  and  DOD  contractors  have  previously
employed him for several years in Iraq. (Tr. 5, 20) In 1980, he was born in Iraq, and in
1997,  he  emigrated  from  Iraq  to  the  United  States.  (Tr.  5,  17)  In  1999,  he  graduated
from high school in the United States, and he has not attended college. (Tr. 5) In 2007,
he became a U.S. citizen. (Tr. 5) In 1996, he married, and in 1997, he divorced. (Tr. 6)
In  2008,  he  married,  and  his  children  are  ages  two  months,  three  years,  and  seven
years.  (Tr.  6)  In  2013,  his  spouse  became  a  U.S.  citizen.  (Tr.  48)  His  three  children
were born in the United States. (Tr. 22) He has not served in the United States or Iraqi
military. (Tr. 7)
Applicant  came  to  the  United  States  as  a  refugee  because  his  brother  was
working  for  the  U.S.  government.  (Tr.  17)  From  January  2006  to  April  2008,  and  from
April 2009 to March 2011, he worked for the United States in Iraq as a linguist. (Tr. 17-
18) He married in Iraq, and he and his spouse went to the United States in July 2008.
(Tr.  19)  His  spouse  spent  about  12  months  in  Iraq  with  her  family  in  the  period  from
April 2009 to March 2011. (Tr. 19) From April 2012 to September 2013, Applicant and
his family lived in Iraq, and Applicant worked for a private Iraqi company in security.  (Tr.
20-21)  From  March  to  June  2015,  Applicant  worked  in  Iraq  as  a  linguist.  (Tr.  22)  In
2017, Applicant, his wife, and children went to Iraq for a couple of months to visit family
and friends. (Tr. 22, 47) He stayed with his mother. (Tr. 44)
Applicant’s  mother,  father,  three  brothers,  four  sisters,  mother-in-law,  father-in-
law,  four  brothers-in-law,  and  one  sister-in-law  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Iraq.  (Tr.
23-30; SOR response ¶¶ 1.a-1.h) His parents are divorced. (Tr. 23) His father served as
an officer in the Iraqi military for about 11 years. (Tr. 23-24) His father is retired, and he
receives  rent  from  properties  he  owns.  (Tr.  25)  Applicant  provided  about  $10,000  to
$12,000 annually in financial support for his mother. (Tr. 23, 43) Now he provides about
$2,000 annually to her. (Tr. 45) He has acquaintances or his uncles deliver the funds to
her in increments of about $500. (Tr. 44) One of his brothers lives in the United States.
(Tr. 25) Two of his brothers in Iraq are police officers. (Tr. 26) None of his other siblings
or  in-laws  are  employed  by  the  Iraqi  government.  (Tr.  23-30)  In  the  past  he  provided
$5,000 or $6,000 in financial support to his siblings. (Tr. 48)
In  2008,  Applicant  purchased  property  in  Iraq,  and  he  values  that  property  at
about  $80,000.  (Tr.  30,  50-51;  SOR  ¶  1.i)  Applicant’s  net  worth  in  the  United  States
including  his  equity  in  his  house  is  about  $250,000.  (Tr.  49)  In  addition  to  his  spouse
and three children, he has two uncles, one brother, and about 20 cousins living  in the
United States. (Tr. 52)
2 The facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment, names of witnesses, names
of  other  groups,  or  locations  in  order  to  protect  Applicant  and  his  family’s  privacy.  The  cited  sources
contain more specific information.
Applicant communicates with his father, mother, and siblings on about a monthly
basis. (Tr. 45-46) His spouse communicates with her family in Iraq on a daily or almost
daily basis. (Tr. 46-47)
Personal Conduct
In  May  2015,  Applicant  was  terminated  as  a  linguist  from  his  employment  for
leaving  his  post  or  site  without  authorization.  (Tr.  31;  SOR  response  ¶  2.a)  Applicant
believed he was not needed at his site, and he left to visit his spouse and children, who
lived  about  90  minutes  away  by  car.  (Tr.  32)  He  did  not  have  permission  to  leave  the
site.  (Tr.  32)  He  said a  sergeant  said  he  could  do  whatever  he  wanted  to  do  because
the cameras used for their mission were down. (Tr. 33) This was the first time he left a
site  in  Iraq  without  permission.  (Tr.  34)  He  believed  that  if  he  asked  for  permission,  it
would be refused. (Tr. 35) When he left in the afternoon, he intended to return early the
next morning. (Tr. 35) About 9:30 PM, the battalion sergeant major from the site called
Applicant and asked him to come back the night he left; however, Applicant waited until
the  next  morning  to  return.  (Tr.  36-38)  Applicant  said  he  did  not  remember  anyone
telling him he had to have permission to travel off-site for personal or unofficial reasons.
(Tr.  41-42)  Applicant  conceded  that  he  should  have  asked  permission  before  leaving
the site. (Tr. 38) He returned the next morning, and he was informed he was terminated
from his employment. (Tr. 39)
The day Applicant left the site without permission, he called his wife about 1:00
PM,  and  he  knew  that  she  was  released  from  the  hospital  where  she  was  treated  for
stomach  flu  the  night  before  he  left  the  site.  (Tr.  36,  52-53)  Despite  knowing  his  wife
was not in the hospital and it was not a medical emergency, Applicant left the site about
3:00 PM without permission. (Tr. 32-38, 53)
Applicant’s  statement  in  the  security  incident  report  relating  to  his  unauthorized
departure from the site states that around 2:00 PM his sister-in-law called and said his
“wife  was  rushed  to  the  Emergency  room  so  at  that  time  I  was  really  shocked  and
worried about my wife because that was the second time she had been hospitalized that
same week.” (GE 2) So he left the base so he “could go to the hospital to see [his] wife.”
(GE  2)  He  said he  would  not  have  left  the  site  “if  it  wasn’t  an emergency.”  (GE  2)  On
January 20, 2018, he resubmitted the statement about his spouse’s medical emergency
as  an  attachment  to  a  text  indicating  it  described  “exactly  what  happened.”  (SOR
response)3
3  Applicant’s  SOR  does  not  allege  that  Applicant  made  a  false  statement  in  response  to  the
security incident report and SOR about his spouse being in the hospital for emergency treatment. In ISCR
Case  No.  03-20327  at  4  (App.  Bd.  Oct.  26,  2006),  the  Appeal  Board  listed  five  circumstances  in  which
conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:
(a)  to  assess  an  applicant’s  credibility;  (b)  to  evaluate  an  applicant’s  evidence  of
extenuation, mitigation,  or  changed circumstances; (c) to consider  whether an applicant
has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of
the  Adjudicative  Guidelines  is  applicable;  or  (e)  to  provide  evidence  for  whole  person
analysis under Directive Section 6.3.
Applicant  questioned  the fairness of  reporting  the May  2015  security incident  in
security  channels  because  he  did  “not  breach[]  any  security  or  put  anybody’s  life  in
danger.”  (Tr.  39)  He  admitted  he  made  mistakes;  however,  he  insisted  that  he  would
conscientiously protect security and classified information. (Tr. 57-58)
Iraq
The  U.S.  Mission  in  Iraq  remains  dedicated  to  building  a  strategic  partnership
with Iraq and the Iraqi people. The December 2011 departure of U.S. troops from Iraq
marked  a  milestone  in  our  relationship  as  Iraq  continues  to  develop  as  a  sovereign,
stable,  and  self-reliant  country.  Iraq  is  now  a  key  partner  for  the  U.S.  in  the  region  as
well  as  a  voice  of  moderation  and  democracy  in  the  Middle  East.  Iraq  has  functioning
government  institutions  including  an  active  legislature,  is  playing  an  increasingly
constructive role in the region, and has a bright economic future as oil revenues surpass
pre-Saddam production levels with continued rapid growth to come. The U.S. maintains
vigorous  and  broad  engagement  with  Iraq  on  diplomatic,  political,  economic,  and
security issues in accordance with the U.S.-Iraq Strategic Framework Agreement.
The Strategic Framework Agreement (SFA) between Iraq and the U.S. provides
the  basis  for  the  U.S.-Iraq  bilateral  relationship.  It  covers  the  range  of  bilateral  issues
including  political  relations  and  diplomacy,  defense  and  security,  trade  and  finance,
energy, judicial and law enforcement issues, services, science, culture, education, and
environment.  Efforts  to  implement  the  SFA  are  overseen  by  the  Higher  Coordinating
Committee and several Joint Coordination Committees, which meet periodically.
The  U.S.  State  Department  warns  that  U.S.  citizens  in  Iraq  are  at  high  risk  for
violence  and  kidnapping,  and  advises  U.S.  citizens  not  to  travel  to  Iraq.  The  current
travel advisory level is Level 4: Do not travel.
The  ability  of  the  U.S.  Embassy  to  provide  consular  services  to  U.S.  citizens
outside  Baghdad  is  limited  given  the  security  environment.  Anti-U.S.  sectarian  militias
may  threaten  U.S.  citizens  and  western  companies  throughout  Iraq.  Kidnappings  and
attacks  by  improvised  explosive  devices  (IED)  occur  in  many  areas  of  the  country,
including  Baghdad.  Methods  of  attack  have  included  explosively  formed  penetrators
(EFPs),  magnetic  IEDs  placed  on  vehicles,  human  and  vehicle-borne  IEDs,  mines
placed  on  or  concealed  near  roads,  mortars  and  rockets,  and  shootings  using  various
direct  fire  weapons.  Such  attacks  may  take  place  in  public  venues  such  as  cafes  and
markets.
Iraq  witnessed  continued  terrorist  activity  in  2016,  primarily  as  a  result  of  the
actions  of  Islamic  State  of  Iraq  and  Syria  (ISIL).  In  2016,  ISIL  remained  the  greatest
terrorist threat globally, maintaining a formidable force in Syria, including a large number
of foreign terrorist fighters. ISIL’s capacity and territorial control in Iraq has dramatically
eroded  in  the  past  two  years.  According  to estimates from  the  UN  Assistance  Mission
Id. (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd.

This conduct will not be considered except for the five purposes listed above.
for Iraq, acts of terrorism and violence killed more than 7,000 civilians and injured more
than 12,000 in 2016. By the end of 2017, Iraqi Security Forces had liberated all territory
from  ISIL,  drastically  reducing  ISIL’s  ability  to  commit  abuses  and  atrocities.  Human
rights violations continue to be a problem with allegations of unlawful killings and other
abuses being made against the Iraqi Security Forces and Popular Mobilization Forces.
In  its  annual  human  rights  report,  the  U.S.  Department  of  State  reported  that
severe  human  rights  problems  were  widespread.  Sectarian  hostility,  widespread
corruption, and lack of transparency at all levels of government and society weakened
the  government's  authority  and  worsened  effective  human  rights  protections.  Iraqi
Security Forces, members of the Federal Police, and the Peshmerga committed some
human  rights  violations,  and  there  continued  to  be  reports  of  Popular  Mobilization
Forces  killing,  torturing,  kidnapping,  and  extorting  civilians.  ISIL  committed  the
overwhelming  majority  of  serious  human  rights  abuses,  including  attacks  against:
civilians,  (particularly  Shia  but  also  Sunnis  who  opposed  ISIL);  members  of  other
religious and ethnic minorities; women; and children.
Observers  also  reported  other  significant  human  rights-related  problems:  harsh
and  life-threatening  conditions  in  detention  and  prison  facilities;  arbitrary  arrest  and
lengthy  pretrial  detention,  denial  of  fair  public  trial;  insufficient  judicial  institutional
capacity;  ineffective  implementation  of  civil  judicial  procedures  and  remedies;  arbitrary
interference  with  privacy  and  homes;  child  soldiers;  limits  on  freedom  of  expression,
including  press  freedoms;  violence  against  and  harassment  of  journalists;  undue
censorship; social, religious, and political restrictions in academic and cultural matters;
limits  on  freedoms  of  peaceful  assembly  and  association;  limits  on  religious  freedom
due to violence by extremist groups; restrictions on freedom of movement; refugee and
internally displaced persons (IDP) abuse; both forced IDP returns and preventing IDPs
from  returning  home;  discrimination  against  and  societal  abuse  of  women  and  ethnic,
religious,  and  racial  minorities,  including  exclusion  from  decision-making  roles;
trafficking  in  persons;  societal  discrimination  and  violence  against  lesbian,  gay,
bisexual,  transgender,  and  intersex  (LGBTI)  persons;  seizure  of  property  without  due
process; and limitations on worker rights.
The  United  States’  extraordinary  commitment  to  Iraq  is  balanced  against  the
inherent  dangers  of  the  ongoing  conflict  in  Iraq  to  its  citizens  and  residents  and  Iraq
government  problems  developing  and  complying  with  the  rule  of  law.  A  top  national
security goal of the United States is to establish relationships, cooperation, training, and
support of the Iraq Government and military in the ongoing war against terrorism.

entire family, including five sisters and her parents, also born in Pakistan, immigrated to
the  United  States  in  1996.  All  members  of  her  immediate  family  are  U.S.  citizens,
except  for  Applicant’s  father’s  three  sisters who  immigrated  to  America  two  years  ago
and are permanent residents. Her father (Applicant’s father-in-law) worked for a fertilizer

teacher  in  Pakistan,  but  is  a  homemaker  in  the  United  States.  Five  of  the  sisters  are
married  and  live  in  the  metropolitan  area  within  a  few  miles  of  Applicant’s  family.  His
wife’s  niece  (her  oldest  sister’s  daughter  and  a  U.S.  citizen)  and  her  cousin,  a
permanent resident who immigrated to the United States in 2017, along with several of
the other in-laws, watch Applicant’s two children during the day while Applicant and his
wife  are  at  work.  Applicant  is  extensively  involved  in  his  children’s  extracurricular
activities like swimming and martial arts. (GE 1 at 1-9, 13; Tr. 12-25, 86-87)
Applicant’s wife’s parents introduced her to Applicant in late 2007, when she was
completing her medical residency and about to start practicing medicine. They talked on
the  phone  and  realized  they  were  compatible.  He  immigrated  to  the  United  States  in
February 2008, and they married in April 2008.3 Approximately a year later, they spent
three weeks on a return trip to Pakistan to meet Applicant’s parents.  (GE 1 at 1-9, 13;
Tr. 12-22, 86-87)
SOR 1.a – Applicant’s mother, 71 years old, is a citizen of Pakistan. In February
2018, she immigrated to the United States to live with Applicant. When she was living in
Pakistan,  she  was  a  teacher  at  a  community  school  supported  by  the  Pakistani
government, her only affiliation with the Pakistani government. She intends to become a
U.S.  citizen  and  live  here  permanently  as  traveling  back  to  Pakistan  with  her illnesses
may  be  unwise  and  unhealthy.  After  his father  died  in  2015,  Applicant  began  sending
his mother $300 to $400 a month to help pay for treatment of her illnesses. (SOR 1.d)
Before she immigrated to the United States in February 2018, Applicant contacted  her
about once a week. (GE 1 at 26; Tr. 28-31, 60-62)
Applicant’s  mother  lived  at  his  father’s  Pakistani  house  before  her  move  to  the
United States in February 2018. After his father died in 2015, she was the only person
in the house. Applicant’s brother (SOR 1.d) now owns the house and is responsible for
the  upkeep.  Applicant’s  parents  have  no  other  property  in  Pakistan,  and  her  tenuous
connection  to  the  Pakistani  government  has  terminated  with  her  retirement  from  the
Pakistani school system. (Tr. 63-64)
SOR 1.b – Applicant’s brother, 50 years old, is a citizen and resident of Pakistan,
and teacher at an elementary school along with his wife. His brother has three children.
He  speaks  to  him  through  the  social  media  on  his  birthday.  Applicant’s  e-QIP  reflects
that  he  contacts  his  brother  weekly  by  phone.  As  with  Applicant’s  mother,  the  brother
and  his  wife  have  a  tenuous  affiliation  with  the  Pakistani  government  based  on  their
teaching  positions. They  have  no  connection  to  the Pakistani military.  (GE  1  at  30-31;
Tr. 30-31, 65-67)
SOR 1.c – Applicant has three sisters who are citizens and residents of Pakistan.
Their ages are 50, 40, and 44. The 50-year-old is a school teacher. Her husband works
in  the  billing  department  of  a  community  power  company.  The  sister  has  children,  but
3 His wife indicated that he was completing his master’s degree, but his e-QIP indicates that he
never received a degree in 2006 or 2008, and has no degree in information technology
Applicant does not know the number or their ages. Though he testified he only contacts
her about once a year, he hears about all his sisters through his 47-year-old sister who
is  a  U.S.  citizen.  In  his  e-QIP,  he  indicated  that  he  contacted  her  weekly.  As  with
Applicant’s mother, the 50-year-old sister has a vague link to the Pakistani government,
but no connection to the military. (GE 1 at 31-36; Tr. 68-69)
Applicant’s  50-year-old  sister,  a  resident  citizen  of  Pakistan,  was  a  school
teacher  and  is  now  a  housewife.  Her  husband  operates  a  hardware  business.  They
have  children  under 18  years old.  According  to  Applicant’s  e-QIP, his contact  with  her
was weekly by phone. They have no connection to the Pakistani government or military.
(GE 1 at 31-36; Tr. 74-76)
Applicant’s  44-year-old  sister,  a  resident  citizen  of  Pakistan,  is  married  to  a
Pakistani who is a former U.S. military veteran. Her husband became disabled while on
duty  and  returned  to  Pakistan  in  2001.  This  sister  has  children  over  the  age  of  18.
Applicant initially testified that he has no contact with this sister, then he stated that he
contacts her through a social media application. (GE 1 at 31-36; Tr. 76-82)
Applicant’s  40-year-old  sister,  a  citizen  and  resident  of  Pakistan,  was  a  school
teacher,  but  is  now  a  housewife.  Her  husband  operates  a  hardware  business.  They
have no affiliation with the Pakistani government or military. (GE 1 at 31-36; Tr. 74-76)
Applicant’s 47-year-old sister (not alleged in the SOR) was born in Pakistan. She
immigrated  to  the  United  States  in  2012  and  was  naturalized  an  American  citizen  in
2017.  She  works  as  a  medical  assistant  in  a  hospital.  She  is  married  to  a  U.S  citizen
who  is  a  taxi  driver.  They  have  no  children.  Applicant  testified  that  he  contacts  her
weekly, but his e-QIP indicates he was contacting her daily. Applicant has not provided
any financial support to any of his siblings. (AE C; Tr. 67, 70-75)
Since immigrating to the United States and marrying in 2008, Applicant has taken
six trips to Pakistan. The year after he and his wife  were married, they traveled to the
country.  In  2011,  Applicant  and  his wife made  the  trip  so  their  parents  could  see their
first child who had been born in 2010. In 2013, they went to Pakistan to introduce their
second  child  to  his  grandparents.  In  2014,  Applicant’s  parents  came  to  the  United
States. Applicant went to Pakistan twice in 2015: once to see his sick father; and then to
attend  his  father’s  funeral.  Applicant  returned  to  the  country  for  his  father’s  death
anniversary in 2016, a cultural practice to observe his passing. (GE 1 at 40-50; Tr. 36-
38, 83)
Applicant’s family members in Pakistan do not know what he does for a living. He
has received training on how to safeguard classified information. He has also received
training  to  report  any  efforts  to  exert  pressure  on  him  through  his  foreign  family
members who are citizens and residents in Pakistan.
Applicant and his wife’s U.S. assets total approximately $349,000. The checking
and savings accounts are $54,000. Their home is valued at $188,000. Their retirement
accounts total $63,000. Their automobiles are worth $44,000. Neither Applicant nor his
wife have any financial interests in Pakistan. (Tr. 44; AE A)

Administrative Notice – Pakistan
Pakistan  is  a  parliamentary  Islamic  republic  with  significant  internal  problems
caused  by  terrorist  organizations  concentrated  in  several  locations  within  the  country.
As  of  2014,  parts  of  Pakistan’s  Federally  Administered  Tribal  Areas,  Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa  province,  and  Balochistan  province  were  regarded  as  a  safe  haven  for
terrorist  groups,  including  al-Qaeda,  the  Haqqani  Network,  Tehrik-e  Taliban  Pakistan,
Lasahkar  I  Jhangvi,  and  the  Afghan  Taliban.  These  groups  create  ongoing  security
problems by targeting western interests, U.S. citizens, senior Pakistani officials, minority
political  groups,  and  religious  entities.  In  September  2012,  the  United  States  officially
declared  the  Haqqani  Network  a  foreign  terrorist  organization.  Operations  in  2014  by
the Pakistani military against some of the terror groups had with only marginal success.
The  human  rights  record  of  Pakistan  is  not  good.  Extrajudicial  killings,  torture,
and  disappearances have  been  reported,  along  with  intrusive  government  surveillance
of  politicians,  political  activists,  and  the  media.  Government  and  police  corruption,
sexual harassment, and gender discrimination are persistent problems.

Whole-person Factors
Applicant  provided  numerous  letters  attesting  to  his  character,  dedication,  and
abilities  as  a  linguist.    A  U.S.  Army  captain  who  worked  with  Applicant  in  2003,
described  Applicant  as  “.  .  .  the  most  reliable  and  sought  after  interpreter  we  have  in
camp.” (AE A at 3) Colonel G.F., U.S. Marine Corps, worked with Applicant in Iraq in the
summer of 2004.  Colonel G.F. states he has worked with interpreters around the world
and  of  the  many  dozens  he  has  observed,  Applicant  is  the  best.  Applicant  also  had  a
deep knowledge of the Iraqi government, military affairs, and the administrative process.
He also taught him about Iraqi culture.  (AE A at 4)
J.P.,  Major  General,  U.S.  Army,  recommended  Applicant  for  special  immigrant
status in September 2006. He notes Applicant served as a translator in support of U.S.
Army from June 2004 to 2006.  He states Applicant is a trusted and valuable contributor
to the Coalition efforts in Iraq. (AE A at 11)
In October 2006, J.P., Lieutenant Colonel, U.S. Army nominated Applicant for an
award for his exceptional translator/interpreter skills and his willingness to go above and
beyond  the  call  of  his  normal  duties.  Applicant’s  reputation  is  well  known  because  he
always  volunteers  for  the  difficult  tasks  and  provides  the  highest  quality  translations.
(AE A at 13)
In  June  2009,  Lieutenant  Colonel  M.,  USMC,  wrote  a  letter  of  recommendation
for  Applicant,  noting  that  he  worked  with  Applicant  during  pre-deployment  training  in
support  of  Iraqi  Freedom.    Lieutenant  Colonel  M.  notes  Applicant  “has  consistently
displayed  courage,  dedication, and  a  patriotic  sense of  duty.” His support for Coalition
Forces  and  Iraqi  Security  Forces  was  instrumental  in  developing  Joint  Coordination
Centers through Al Anbar Province and had a positive impact in the overall security and
stability of the province. (AE A at 19)
In July 2010, Lieutenant Colonel T. states “In 24 years of service as a U.S. Army
officer,  I  have  never  witnessed  such  dedication  and  loyalty  as  exemplified  by
[Applicant].  He  is  always  at  the  forefront  of  his  colleagues  in  work  ethic,  cultural
expertise  and  language  competency,  and  because  of  these  professional  attributes  I
without  hesitation  give  him  my  highest  recommendation  for  both  employment  and
continued service as a valued friend and strategic asset to the mission.” (AE A at 20)
Applicant’s current supervisor describes him as “a tireless worker, always going
the extra mile with our Army customer, whom he has impressed over and over. He has
excellent  communication  skills,  consistently  handling  complex  situations; advising  U.S.
Army personnel of best practices regarding our Jordanian military partners; working with
the customer to provide unsurpassed mission support. . . .” (AE L at 1)
Numerous reference letters say similar favorable things about Applicant. (AE A;
AE L) He also received several certificates of appreciation and other awards. (AE B) His
performance evaluations are highly favorable. He received several bonus payments for
his performance in 2018 and 2019. (AE A; AE J)  In October 2018, Applicant completed
a 28-mile March for the Fallen alongside the U.S. troops he supports. His achievement
was the focus of an article in the base newspaper and Applicant received an award from
the command. (Tr. 20-23; AE K; AE Y)
Applicant testified he enjoys being able to facilitate communications between the
American  and  Iraqi  communities.  He  enjoys  working  with  the  military  because  of  his
military background. His allegiance is to the United States. He will do his best to keep
the U.S. interests safe and will follow the rules of law. (Tr.  58; Response to SOR)

employer  in  2009.  He  deployed  to  Afghanistan  from  April  2010  to  August  2012  and
worked  with  U.S.  forces.  After  taking  time  off,  he  redeployed  to  Afghanistan  from
February  2013  to  November  2014.  He  was  then  laid off  because  his  company  had no
work for permanent U.S. residents. He was unemployed in the U.S. for several months
before finding work outside the defense industry. (Tr. 34-39, 62-64; GE 1)
Applicant resumed working for his current employer in 2016, when he submitted
his SCA. He redeployed to Afghanistan as a linguist and translator in January 2017. He
remained there until December 2018. He has never held a clearance before. (Tr. 6, 15,
60-65; GE 1)
The  SOR  alleges  foreign  influence  security  concerns  due  to  Applicant’s  family
members  who  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Afghanistan,  specifically  his  parents,  a
sister,  five  brothers,  and  a  brother-in-law.  Applicant’s  family  lives  in  a  major  city  in
Afghanistan. Their details are as follows:
Applicant’s mother: (SOR ¶ 1.b) She passed away in early December 2018, three
days after Applicant returned to the U.S. on leave. He did not return to Afghanistan for
her  funeral.  (Tr.  31,  65,  Answer;  GE  1)  Understandably,  Applicant  has  spoken  to  his
father and his siblings frequently since then, including two days before the hearing. (Tr.
41, 66) SOR ¶ 1.b is found for Applicant, since his mother is deceased. (Tr. 95)
Applicant’s  father:  (SOR  ¶  1.a)  He  is  in  his  mid-70s.  He  retired  about  25  years
ago as a colonel in the Afghan army. He collects a monthly pension. Applicant usually
contacts  his father monthly.  His  father  has never  visited  the  United  States.  (Tr. 40-43,
48, 70; Answer; GE 1)
Applicant’s sister and brother-in-law (SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.e) Applicant’s sister, age 39,
is a housewife. She is married to Applicant’s brother-in-law, who is also his cousin. He
is about 45 years old, and is an officer in the Afghan army, assigned to a training facility.
He was recently promoted from major (as alleged) to lieutenant colonel. Applicant has
little direct contact with him, though he speaks to his sister every three or four months.
Through  his  oldest  brother,  he  sends  her  money  (less  than  $100)  every  few  months.
They have never visited the United States. (Tr. 43-44, 48, 54, 69-70)
Applicant’s oldest brother: Applicant is in closest contact with his oldest brother,
at least once a month, sometimes more. Applicant sends him money to be distributed to
his other siblings. This brother is married and has several children. He formerly owned a
hotel  and  a  restaurant  but  now  drives  a  taxi.  He  has  no  military  or  government
affiliations. (Tr. 48-51, 67; Answer; GE 1)
Applicant’s  second  older  brother:  He  owns  a  small  shop  near  his  other  family
members.  He  has  no  military  or  government  affiliations.  He  is  married  with  several
children. Applicant contacts him every four to six months to check on his well-being, and
occasionally sends money for his children ($100). (Tr. 50-51; Answer; GE 1)
Applicant’s third older brother: He worked with U.S. forces as a local interpreter
from  2009  to  2011,  when  he  was  wounded  on  a  mission.  He  lives  at  home  with  his
father. He is seeking to come to the U.S. on a special immigrant visa. Applicant contacts
him about every two months. (Tr. 51-52; Answer; GE 1)
Applicant’s  two  younger  brothers.  One  brother  recently  graduated  from  college
and  started  a  job  for  an  American  company,  working  in  Afghanistan.  Applicant’s
youngest  brother  is  still  in  college.  Neither  is  married,  and  they  have  no  children.
Applicant speaks to them about every two months. (Tr. 52-53; Answer; GE 1)
During  his  prior  deployments,  Applicant  earned  as  much  as  $185,000  annually.
He estimated that he sent his family between about $50,000 and $65,000 between 2010
and 2014. He paid to renovate his parents’ house in Afghanistan, and he sent money to
one of his brothers as an engagement and wedding present, which the brother used to
buy a car. Since then, he has not sent them nearly as much money. In 2017, he sent his
family  about $600. In 2018,  he and  his  girlfriend  sent  his father  about $2,000. (Tr.  42,
53-54, 73)
Applicant  testified  that  his  family  members  know  that  he  is  deployed  to
Afghanistan, but they do not know what he does. He is not allowed to visit them while
on duty because he is not authorized to leave the base. Applicant has visited his family
when he is on leave. He is not allowed to visit his family while on his current contract, so
he will not see them after his return to Afghanistan after the hearing. (Tr. 44-47, 66-69)
Applicant owns no property in Afghanistan and he has no assets there. He may
inherit a share of his father’s house one day, like his other siblings. He is registered to
vote in the U.S. He has money in the U.S. stock market through an investment account,
which  he  valued  at  about  $100,000.  His  pay  is  deposited  into  a  U.S.  bank  account.
Applicant’s U.S. home of record is his girlfriend’s parents’ house. (Tr. 57-60, 71, 72)
Applicant’s girlfriend, age 37, is a naturalized U.S. citizen from Afghanistan. She
came to the U.S. with her parents and siblings as a child, in 1990. She became a U. S.
citizen in 2008, and holds a U.S. passport. Her parents and two of her four brothers are
also  naturalized  U.S.  citizens.  Since  leaving  as  a  child,  she  has  never  been  back  to
Afghanistan,  though  she  has  extended  family  there.  She  has  spoken  to  several  of
Applicant’s Afghan family members by phone. She has a bachelor’s degree. She helps
her mother, who owns a hair salon. (Tr. 80-88)
Applicant  and  his  girlfriend  met  online  and  have  been  together  since  August
2013. She testified that he is dedicated, patient, fair, and loving. He is trustworthy and
reliable.  (Tr.  80-84)  She  said  he  took  the  job  in  Afghanistan  to  help  them build for  the
future. (Tr. 88-89)
Applicant supplied strong character references from several U.S. military officers
who served with him in Afghanistan, often on a daily basis, both several years ago, and
recently.  All  attested  to  his  professional  skill  and  high  value  as  an  interpreter,  cultural
advisor, and trusted team member. They universally attest to his loyalty, reliability, and
trustworthiness.  (AE  B  -  AE  F.  AE  I)  Applicant  also  submitted  several  certificates  of
appreciation and training certificates, detailing his hard work, dedication, and exemplary
performance. (AE A, AE G, AE H)
Administrative Notice-Afghanistan5
The U.S. State Department warns U.S. citizens not to travel to Afghanistan due
to  crime,  terrorism,  civil  unrest, and  armed  conflict.  Extremists  associated  with  various
Taliban  networks,  the  Islamic  State  of  Iraq  and  Levant,  and  members  of  other  armed
opposition  groups  are  active  throughout  the  country.  Afghanistan  continues  to
experience  aggressive  and  coordinated  attacks  by  the  Taliban  and  other  terrorist
groups. The border region between Afghanistan and Pakistan remains a safe haven for
terrorists.  The  country’s  most  significant  human-rights  concerns  are  widespread
violence,  armed  insurgent  groups’  attacks  on  civilians,  and  killing  of  persons  affiliated
with the government.

"Applicant  is  a  65-year-old  software  developer.  He  has  worked  for  his  current
security  clearance  sponsor  since  about  April  2018.  He  worked  for  a  different  federal
contactor  when  he  submitted  his  application  for  a  clearance  (SCA)  on  November  25,
2015. He was granted a security clearance in 1984 and again in 2002. He also worked
for the Federal Aviation Administration for about 13 years (approximately 1986-1999). (Tr.

Applicant was born in Pakistan and entered the United States in September 1972
at the age of 18. He married a U.S. citizen in 1974 and divorced in 1977. He remarried
another American citizen in 1977 and divorced again in 1983.  In December 1977, they
had one child. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1982. He attended college in the
United States, and in 1984, he received his bachelor’s degree in computer engineering.
In 1989, he married an Indian-born woman in Pakistan. Her father is deceased, but was
a Pakistani citizen. Her mother is a citizen and resident of Pakistan. His wife subsequently
became a naturalized U.S. citizen. They have three adult children, who were all born in
the United States. Applicant has several U.S.-born grandchildren and a U.S.-born great-
grandchild. (Tr. 12-14; SCA 7, 10, 16, 31, and 36.)

accountant  for  a  private  developer  prior  to  his  death.  His  mother  is  a  dual  U.S.  and
Pakistani citizen. Applicant sponsored her to immigrate to the United States in the late
1980s and to become a U.S. citizen. She has been a housewife her entire life and is now

the  United  States.  They  have  become  U.S.  citizens,  as  well.  Applicant  has  one  other
brother and  six  sisters, who  are  citizens  and  residents  of Pakistan.  Applicant’s  mother
returned to Pakistan due to her health and lives with Applicant’s brother and one of his
sisters. Applicant’s sisters take care of her in her old age. (Tr. 18-19; SCA 19-20, 23-24,
26-27, 32, and 42-43.)
Applicant’s mother-in-law has been a housewife her entire life. She is almost 80
years old. He does not speak with her due to a disagreement. He last spoke with her in
2015  or  2016.  Since  then,  Applicant’s  wife  has  also  not  spoken  with  her  mother.
Applicant’s father-in-law was a civil engineer. Applicant’s wife has travelled to Pakistan
on two occasions since he married her in 1989 and brought her to the United States. (Tr.
30-32 and 43-4; SCA 31.)
Since arriving in the United States in 1972, Applicant travelled to Pakistan twice,
once in 1982, after becoming a U.S. citizen and again in 2015 for less than 10 days to
visit with most of his family. He made the trip with one of his American brothers and was
unemployed at the time. Applicant’s wife did not accompany him. He did not visit with any
non-family members during that trip. He did not return to Pakistan for the funeral of his
father in 1989. He does not plan to attend the funeral of his mother or any other relative
in the future for practical reasons. He has no plans to return to Pakistan for any reason in
the future. He speaks or otherwise communicates with his mother every few months. He
last saw her in Pakistan during his 2015 trip. His mother does not know that he is seeking
a security clearance from the U.S. Government. (Tr. 14-15, 19-20, 31-32, 36, 39, and 45.)
Applicant has even less contact with his Pakistani siblings. All of his sisters are

Applicant has no assets in Pakistan. All of his assets, including his home, which
he  has  owned  since  2002,  are  in  the  United  States.  He  does  not  have  a  Pakistani

interests of the United States. (Tr. 46; SCA 9; AE A, E, H, I, and J.)
Pakistan
The  U.S.  State  Department  warns  U.S.  citizens  to  reconsider  travel  to  Pakistan
due  to  terrorism.  Travel  by  U.S.  Government  personnel  within  Pakistan  is  restricted.
Terrorist  groups  continue  to  pose  a  danger  to  U.S.  citizens  throughout  Pakistan,  and
evidence suggests that some victims of terrorist activity were targeted because they are
Americans.  Although  al-Qaida  in  Pakistan  has  been  degraded,  its  global  leadership
continued to operate from remote locations in the region that the group has historically
exploited for safe haven. Pakistan has not taken substantial action against the Afghan
Taliban or Haqqani Network, or substantially limit their ability to threaten U.S. interests in
Afghanistan. Pakistan has also not taken sufficient action against other externally focused
terrorist groups such as Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad, which continued to
operate, train, organize, and fundraise in Pakistan.
The  U.S.  State  Department’s  2017  Human Rights  Report for Pakistan  indicates
that  the  most  serious  human  rights  problems  in  Pakistan  were  the  following:  (1)
extrajudicial and targeted killings; (2) disappearances; (3) torture; (4) lack of rule of law;
(5)  poor  implementation  and  enforcement  of  laws;  and  (6)  frequent  mob  violence  and
vigilante  justice  with  limited  accountability.  Other  human  rights  problems  included
arbitrary  detention,  lengthy  pretrial  detention,  governmental  infringement  on  citizens’
privacy rights, a weak criminal justice system, and a lack of judicial independence in the
lower  courts,  and  harassment  of  journalists.  There  were  government  restrictions  on
freedom  of  assembly  and  limits  on  freedom  of  movement.  Government  practices  and
certain  laws  limited  freedom  of  religion,  particularly  for  religious  minorities.  Corruption
within  the  government  and  police,  as  well  as  discrimination  against  women  and  girls
remained  serious  problems.  The  authorities  seldom  punished  government  officials  for
human rights violations.

"Applicant is a 43-year-old potential employee of a defense contractor. He will be

(GED)  high  school  equivalency  diploma,  which  he  received  in  2017.  He  is  married  for
the second time. He and his wife have two young children.1
Applicant was born in Iraq to Iraqi parents. He attended high school in Iraq. His
brother  worked  for  a  humanitarian  organization  that  was  affiliated  with  the  United
States. Because of his work with the organization, his brother was eligible to immigrate
with  his  family  to  the  United  States.  Applicant,  his  mother,  and  his  three  siblings
immigrated  to  the  United  States  in  1997.  Applicant’s  father,  who  was  apparently
divorced from Applicant’s mother and remarried, remained in Iraq. Applicant became a
U.S. citizen in 2009. His mother and siblings live in the United States as U.S. citizens or
permanent residents.2
Applicant worked under dangerous conditions as a linguist with the U.S. military
in Iraq from 2005 to 2011, at which time he returned to the United States. His wife is an
Iraqi citizen. He went to Iraq later in 2011  and married his wife. His two children were
born in Iraq. His application for his wife to immigrate to the United States was approved.
Applicant,  his  wife,  and  their  two  children  moved  to  the  United  States  in  2016.  His

"Applicant admitted, with some explanations, all of the eight allegations in the SOR
under Guideline B, except part of SOR ¶ 1.c regarding his brother’s current employment
in  Afghanistan.  He  denied  the  two  falsification  allegations  under  Guideline  E.  I  have
incorporated his admissions in my findings of facts.  Applicant’s personal information in
my  findings  of  facts  is  extracted  from  GE  1,  his  April  21,  2016  security  clearance
application (SCA), unless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record.
After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  the  hearing  transcript,  as
corrected by Applicant in Hearing Exhibit III, and the documentary evidence, I make the
following findings of fact.
Applicant  is 66  years old.  He  was  born  and raised  in  Afghanistan. He  earned a
medical degree there in 1976. He married his first wife in 1984 in Pakistan. They have
two  children,  ages  33 and 32.  Both  children were  born  in  Pakistan,  are  citizens  of  the
United  States,  and  reside  in  this  country  with  their  mother,  who  Applicant  divorced  in
2005.  His  first  wife  is  a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen.  In  1991,  he  had  a  third  child  out  of
wedlock. This child was born in the United States. Applicant has limited contact with these
children. Applicant remarried in 2005 to a woman who is an Afghan citizen. They married
in Afghanistan and have one child, age ten, who was born in Afghanistan, but is a U.S.
citizen. Applicant’s youngest child lives with Applicant and his second wife in the United
States.  His  wife  has  applied  for  U.S.  citizenship  and  her  naturalization  interview  was
scheduled for late March 2019. At the time the record closed, the record contained no
evidence showing that she had obtained U.S. citizenship. (Tr. 32, 36, 88-89.)
Applicant’s  parents  were  Afghan  residents  and  citizens  and  are  deceased.  His
mother-in-law  and  father-in-law  were  also  Afghan  residents  and  citizens  and  are
deceased. Applicant had six sisters and one brother. His brother is deceased, as are two
of his sisters. The remaining four sisters are citizens and residents of Afghanistan. Each
of  his  sisters married, but  three  are  now  widowed.  His  brother-in-law  is an elementary
school teacher in a rural village working for the Afghan Ministry of Education, though in
his SOR  Response, Applicant  claimed that his brother-in-law  ceased  teaching  in  2008
and now works for a private company. His explanation of the discrepancy was confusing
and centered on what entity paid the teachers in Afghanistan, not whether he was or was
not a teacher. In his SCA, Applicant reported that he has quarterly contact with his four
sisters, either by telephone or in person. At the hearing, he testified that he speaks with
them more frequently now, especially after the recent death of one of their husbands. He
explained  that  because  his  sisters  are  uneducated,  their  conversations  are  limited  to
family issues. (Tr. 48-52, 72-73, 100.)
Applicant’s wife also has family in Afghanistan. One of her brothers teaches at a
private  university  in  that  country.  Applicant  vaguely  suggested  that  his  wife  may  have
other siblings or family members there, but that none of them hold significant positions in
Afghan society. (Tr. 89-90.)
In  his  SCA,  Applicant  reported  that  between  2009  and  2016  he  traveled  to
Afghanistan nine times for business reasons, often for extended periods of time, and once
to  visit  family  members.  He  has  traveled  to  Afghanistan  ten  to  fifteen  times  since  he
immigrated to the United States. He stayed with his family during his visits, except when
he  was  in  the  country  to  work,  which  is  discussed  below.  Applicant,  his  wife,  and  his
youngest  child  were  last  in  Afghanistan  in  December  2018  for  the  engagement  of  a
grandchild of his deceased brother. (Tr. 32-35, 37, 39.)
Applicant’s deceased brother had four sons. They are all citizens and residents of
Afghanistan. One is a civil engineer. One works for a not-for-profit organization supported
by U.S. funds from USAID or a similar funding source. The third son works for a private
insurance  company,  and  the  fourth  is  doctor  who  works  as  a  surgeon.  Applicant
communicates by email with one of his nephews. (Tr. 45-46.)
The  oldest  sister  of  Applicant  is  a  widow  with  five  children.  She  lives  on  her
deceased  husband’s farm  in  the  village  where  Applicant  grew  up. She  is a  housewife.
The next oldest sister is also a widow and a housewife. She has no children. She lives
with  Applicant’s  nephews,  the  sons  of  his  deceased  brother.  The  third  oldest  sister  is
married and has approximately six children. The fourth sister is also a widow.  She has
five or six children. (Tr. 41-45.)
Applicant  has  lead  a  life  full  of  political  activism  fighting  for  political  and  social
justice in Afghanistan. After graduating from medical school in 1975, he worked for the
Afghan government as a doctor until he was imprisoned in  the 1978 to 1980 period by
the  Russian-backed  Afghan  government  due  to  his  membership  in  a  political  party
opposed  to  the  Afghan  government.  In  1980,  he  was  released,  and  he  relocated  from
Afghanistan  to  Pakistan  because  he  feared  for  his  life  if  he  stayed  in  Afghanistan.  In
Pakistan,  he  published  an  article  in  a  newspaper  opposing  Islamic  extremists  in
Afghanistan. He then became a target there and was in danger of being killed. (GE 2.)
In  1988, he  immigrated  to  the  United  States  from Pakistan  on  a  student  visa  to
escape  the  danger  he  faced  in  Pakistan.  He  was  35  years  old.  He  had  a  one-year
scholarship. In 1989, he asked for and was granted political asylum in the United States
because  of  threats  against  his  life  following  the  assassination  of  his  mentor  who  co-
founded  with  Applicant  a  health  and  social  services  organization  in  Pakistan  to  assist
Afghan refugees. The colleague was assassinated due to Applicant’s newspaper article.
As noted below, his interest in the welfare of the Afghan people continued even after he
immigrated to the United States. Applicant’s exhibits all attest to his strong beliefs in social
justice, non-violence, and the importance of educating young people to be responsible
citizens. (GE 3 at 1, GE 2 at 1-2; AE A-H; Tr. 61-67.)
In  August 1998, he earned  a master’s  degree  in  public  administration  at  a  U.S.
university.  He  became  a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen  in  July  1999,  at  the  age  of  46.  In  the
SCA, he lists that he resided in Afghanistan from April 2011 to May 2015 and from August
2008 to October 2010, in other words, for at least 6 of the last 20 years when he held U.S.
citizenship. The SCA provides no information regarding his residences prior to December
2005. (GE 3 at 1.)
In 2007, Applicant worked for a year as a contractor as a subject-matter specialist
at  the  U.S.  Marine  Corps  base  at  Quantico,  Virginia.  He  then  worked  in  Kabul,
Afghanistan, for a year as a subject matter expert contractor. From October 2010 to March
2011, he was a part-time language instructor in the United States, while at the same time
he was the full-time president of an organization he founded in Afghanistan. He performed
in that position from August 2009 to April 2016, and worked out of his home in Afghanistan
and traveled once a week to the organization’s offices in another part of Afghanistan. In
his July 2016 background interview, Applicant explained further that from May 2012 to
May 2014, he actually worked full-time at the Afghan Ministry of Center for Narcotics in
Kabul and that his work for the other organization was only part-time. He also explained
that he was not the president of that organization, just an advisor. Starting in November
2015, he also worked part-time as a security guard in the United States. (GE 3 at 2-3; Tr.
58-67.)
In April 2016, Applicant was offered a position with a U.S. defense contractor to
work as a linguist, which requires a security clearance. If granted a clearance, he will live
in Afghanistan and work with the U.S. military. As of the date of the hearing, he was still
working as a security guard in this country. He is also the “Chief Operational Officer” of
an organization that addresses issues important to immigrant communities in the United
States. (GE 3 at 2-3; Tr. 58-67; AE C.)
Applicant  explained  in  his  SOR  Response  that  his  work  in  2012  to  2014  in
Afghanistan  was  a  contract  position  on  a  USAID-sponsored  project.  He  was  paid  with
funds  provided  by  USAID,  though  his  point  of  contact  in  the  ministry  was  the  Afghan
Deputy  Minister  of  Counter  Narcotics.  Formally,  he  worked  for  part  of  the  Ministry  of
Finance  of Afghanistan,  a  government  agency,  and  was  assigned  to  provide  technical
assistance to the Afghan counter-narcotics government agency. Applicant had numerous
meetings with the Deputy Minister. (Tr. 53-60.)
Applicant also reported that he had contact for one year with the current president
of Afghanistan before his election in  May 2014. Applicant provided advice to the then-
candidate on counter-narcotics issues. His actual contact with the future president was
through written reports for the candidate. He testified that he only met the future president
twice in meetings with others. In a 2016 security screening interview, he admitted that he
was highly involved in an organization that worked closely with the Afghan government
and that he has worked closely with the current president of Afghanistan. He was offered
a position with the Afghan government and was told to wait until after the election so he
could assume the position. He waited one year after the election, but in the end he was
told that he was not going to be appointed. In May 2015, he returned to the United States.
He has had no contact with the Afghan president since May 2015. (Tr. 53-60; GE 2.)
As noted, Applicant has spent a substantial amount of time living and working in
Afghanistan during the 2008 to 2015 period. While working in support of U.S. interests,
he was also working to help the people of Afghanistan. During his time in Afghanistan, he
kept a bank account in a local bank to deposit his salary and to pay living expenses. When
he left the country in May 2015, he withdrew most of the funds in the account. (GE 2 at
3, 6-7; 14; Tr. 53-58.)
In the SCA, Applicant answered in the negative a question that asked “Has any
foreign national in the past seven (7) years offered you a job, asked you to work as a
consultant, or consider employment with them?”  His answer was incorrect because he
was offered a position by a foreign national that he thought would materialize after the
2014  presidential  elections  in  Afghanistan.  He  waited  for  one  year  after  the  election,
believing that offer was a real opportunity.  In his SOR Response, he responded to the
allegation by writing that while he was consulting for the Afghan government in the 2012
to 2014 period, he was actually working for USAID. This response missed the point of the
falsification allegation. His SCA answer failed to disclose an offer to work for the Afghan
government.  When  pressed  on  the  issue  during  his  security  screening  interview,  he
offered  the  same  inconsistent  response  about  the  offered  position.  He  repeated  that
approach at the hearing, emphasizing the consulting job he had before the presidential
election, not the job offer to work in Afghanistan after the election that he waited for a year
to  begin.  His  testimony  did  not  clarify  his  reasoning  for  his  negative  response  to  this
question. The source of the funds to pay his salary in a government job was irrelevant to
whether a foreign national offered him a job or asked him to work as a consultant. (Tr. 70-
71; GE 2 at 4, 7.)
A separate question asked “Have you or any member of your immediate family in
the past seven (7) years had any contact with a foreign government, its representatives,
whether inside or outside the U.S.?” Again he answered “No,” and in his SOR Response
he defended his response as a misunderstanding of the meaning of the word “contact” in
the question. He replied that in the Afghan culture the word “contact” has a more personal
meaning than a working relationship. He argued that the nature of his relationship with
the Afghan government officials he came to know while working there was not personal.
In answering this question in the negative, he was applying his understanding of what the
word  “contact”  meant.  He  made  the  same  point  at  the  hearing,  using  the  phrase  “we
Afghans”  in  reference  to  how  he  viewed  the  question.  Somewhat  inconsistently,  he
admitted in his SOR Response the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f that he had “contact”
with  two  senior  Afghan  government  officials,  one  of  which  was  the  president  of
Afghanistan. (Tr. 67-70.)
Applicant submitted several exhibits for my consideration. I have reviewed them
carefully.  They  explain  in  depth  his  personal  philosophy  and  beliefs.  These  exhibits
confirm my impression of Applicant when he testified that he was a serious, thoughtful
person  with  deep  convictions.  In  the  past,  those  convictions  have  caused  him  to  be
incarcerated or threatened, but they have also led him to seek to better the sometimes
oppressive  conditions of  his fellow  Afghans. Those  experiences  have  not  changed  his
commitment to speak out when necessary. He is committed to the best interests of both
Afghanistan and the United States. However, I found some of his testimony on key points
to be lacking in candor. He tried hard to provide testimony that would reduce the risk of
an unfavorable clearance decision. It was clear that it was very important to him to be
granted  a  clearance  so  he  could  return  to  Afghanistan.  The  security  screening
interviewers reported that they had the same reaction to some of Applicant’s comments.

Administrative Notice
Afghanistan  is  presently  an  Islamic  Republic  with  a  democratically  elected
president. The county has had a turbulent political history, including an invasion by the
Soviet  Union  in  1979.  After  an  accord  was  reached  in  1989,  and  the  Soviet  Union
withdrew  from  Afghanistan,  fighting  continued  among  the  various ethnic,  clan,  and
religious militias. By the end of 1998, the Taliban rose to power and controlled 90% of
the country, imposing aggressive and repressive policies.
In October 2001, U.S. forces and coalition partners led military operations in the
country, forcing the Taliban out of power by  November 2001. The coalition sought to
oust  al-Qaeda,  Osama  bin  Laden,  and  other  terrorists  seeking  to  attack  the  United
States from Afghanistan. The new democratic government took power in 2004 after a
popular election.
A U.S. State Department Travel Advisory remains in effect for Afghanistan under
which the State Department warns U.S. citizens against travel to Afghanistan because
of continued instability and threats by terrorist organizations against U.S. citizens. Travel
to  all  areas  of  Afghanistan  remains  unsafe  due  to  the  ongoing  risk  of  kidnapping,
hostage-taking, suicide bombings, military combat operations, landmines, terrorist and
insurgent  attacks,  banditry,  armed  rivalry  between  political  and  tribal  groups,  militant
attacks, direct and indirect fire, and insurgent attacks, including attacks using vehicle-
borne or other improvised explosive devices. Attacks may also target official Afghan and
U.S. governmental convoys and compounds, foreign embassies, military installations,
and other public areas.
No  province  in  Afghanistan  is  immune  from  violence,  and  the  potential  exists
throughout the country for hostile acts, either targeted or random, against U.S. and  other
foreign  nationals  at  any  time.  Extremists  associated  with  various  terrorist
networks  and members  of  other armed opposition  groups  are active  throughout the
country and remain violently opposed to the Afghan government and the U.S.-led
Coalition Forces. These terrorist groups have attacked Afghan, Coalition Forces, and
U.S. targets with little regard for or with the express intent to cause civilian casualties.
Widespread human rights abuses are also reported.

Based upon a review of the pleadings and exhibits, national security eligibility for access

Paragraph 1 – Guideline B (Foreign Influence)
Applicant  was  born  in  Afghanistan  in  1955.  He  received  a  medical  degree  in
Afghanistan in 1981. Applicant was employed by the Afghan government as a medical
officer assigned to a ministry from 1982 until 2008. He has had no contact with any of
the people he worked with at the ministry since approximately 2016. (Item 3 at Section
12; Item 5 at 2-4.)
Applicant’s  sister-in-law  sponsored  Applicant  and  his  family  to  immigrate  to  the
United  States.  They  began  the  process  in  1996.  Applicant,  his  wife,  and  their  three
daughters were approved to immigrate to the United States in 2007, and moved to the

inadmissible. They are the summaries of unsworn interviews of Applicant conducted by interviewers from
the Office of Personnel Management on January 3, 2012; and August 2, 2016. Applicant did not adopt the
summaries as his own statements, or otherwise certify  them to be accurate. Under Directive ¶ E3.1.20,
these Report of Investigation (ROI) summaries are inadmissible in the Government’s case in chief in the
absence  of  an  authenticating  witness.  (See  Executive  Order  10865  §  5.)  In  light  of  Applicant’s
admissions,  Items  4  and  6  are  also  cumulative.  Applicant  is  not  legally  trained  and  might  not  have
understood Department Counsel’s FORM footnote 1, which described the potential admissibility of Items
4  and  6.  I  therefor  reviewed  them  for  any  potentially  mitigating  information  that  Applicant  might  have
thought would be considered. Any such mitigating information will be discussed later in this decision.
United  States  permanently  in  August  2008.  Applicant  became  a  naturalized  American
citizen in 2014. His wife and daughters are also naturalized American citizens, living in
the United States. An investigator reported, “Subject [Applicant] and his family are very
happy  to  be  living  in  the  U.S.  and  are  grateful  for  the  opportunities  that  have  been
provided  to  them.”  Applicant  stated  that  his  financial  situation  is  good.  No  derogatory
information was found in a review of Applicant’s finances. (Item 3 at Sections 9, 17, and
18; Item 5 at 9; Item 6 at 2.)
Applicant  began  working  as  a  linguist  in  2012,  before  he  became  an  American
citizen.  He  left  the  job  in  2014  to  be  with  his  wife,  who  was  diagnosed  with  breast
cancer.  He  once  again  became  employed  as  a  linguist  in  early  2016,  and  is  currently
deployed to Afghanistan. (Item 2; Item 5 at 1; Applicant Exhibit A.)
Applicant  obtained  an  American  passport  in  2015.  During  the  time  he  was
employed  as  a  linguist  as  a  lawful  permanent  resident,  he  used  a  travel  document
provided  by  the  United  States  Government  for  overseas  travel.  (Item  1  at  Section  8;
Item 5 at 3.)
Applicant’s  parents  are  deceased.  His  father  passed  away  in  1979,  and  his
mother  in  2016.  He  has  numerous  half-brothers  and  half-sisters  on  his  father’s  side.
Applicant  does  not  have  a  close  relationship  with  any  of  them,  and  has  not  had  any
contact with any of them in years.  None of his relatives have knowledge of Applicant’s
job, or the fact that he is applying for a security clearance. (Item 3 at Section 18; Item 6
at 6.)
With regard to two half-brothers specifically mentioned in the SOR, Applicant had
the following information:
1.b. This relative  worked for an  Afghan  government ministry.  Applicant  has  had
no contact with him since 2015. (Item 2.)
1.c.  This  relative  worked  for  the  Afghan  government  as  a  doctor. Applicant  has
had no contact with this relative since 2008. (Item 2.)

Mitigation
Applicant is a highly respected and successful linguist. This is shown by letters of
appreciation and certificates of achievement presented to him with regard to his work in
Afghanistan. At one point Applicant supported an American military police battalion that
was conducting detention operations. The commanding office of the battalion stated in a
letter  of  appreciation,  “[Applicant]  has  played  a  vital  role  in  the  translation  and
interpretation with our Afghan Army counterparts. . . [Applicant] has always displayed a
high  degree  of  integrity,  responsibility  and  ambition.”  (Applicant  Exhibit  A  at  2.)
Applicant  Exhibit  A  also  contains  five  certificates  of  appreciation  from  various  military
units  extolling  Applicant’s  abilities  and  conduct  providing  linguistic  support  during
combat operations.
Afghanistan
I take administrative notice of the following facts: In 2001, the United States led a
coalition  to  remove  the  Taliban  from  power  in  Afghanistan.  Afghanistan  remains  an
important  partner  with  the  United  States  in  the  fight  against  terrorism,  and  has  been
designated a Major Non-NATO Ally. However, numerous attacks and kidnappings have
targeted  the  U.S.  Armed  Forces,  contractors,  and  other  civilians,  as  well  as  Afghans.
Even  with  aggressive  governmental  action  against  terrorists,  the  threat  of  terrorism  in
Afghanistan  remains high.  Terrorist  groups  conduct  intelligence activities  as  effectively
as state intelligence services. (Item 7: Attachments.)

"Applicant  admitted  both  of  the  SOR  allegations.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 33 years old and married. He is applying for a security clearance in
connection  with  his  employment  with  a  Defense  contractor  as  a  Quality  Assurance
Inspector. (Applicant Exhibit F.)
Paragraph 1 – Guideline B (Foreign Influence)
Applicant  was  born  in  Syria  in  1985.  He  immigrated  to  the  United States, along
with his parents, in 2006. Applicant became a naturalized American citizen in 2011. His
parents  are  also  naturalized  American  citizens.  Applicant  has  three  siblings,  none  of
whom live in Syria. (Tr. 24-28; Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 9, 18.)
Applicant’s wife is also from Syria. She moved to the United States in 2010 and
they were married in 2011. She became a naturalized American citizen in 2015. She is
employed by a governmental entity in the United States as an inspector. In addition, she
teaches  at  an  American  university  while  continuing  her  education.  Her  family  suffered
religious persecution in Syria. (Tr. 28-29, 41-42, 49-50.)
Applicant’s  in-laws  are  Syrian  citizens.  (Mr.  and  Mrs.  A.)  Mr.  A  works  in
construction  and  had been  living  in  Saudi Arabia for several years.  Mrs. A  is a  retired
teacher and lived primarily in Syria, though she spends a substantial part of each year
in  Saudi  Arabia  with  Mr.  A.  Neither  one  of  them  has  any  connection  to  the  Syrian
government.  Applicant  has  seen  these  people  twice  in  person,  the  last  time  in  2011
when  he  got  married  in  Syria.  He  has  telephonic  contact  with  them  very  seldom.
Applicant’s wife talks to her parents on approximately a weekly basis. (Tr. 30-32, 35-36,
44-45.)
Mrs. A’s sister, Applicant’s wife’s aunt, is an American citizen. She petitioned for
Mr. and Mrs. A to be allowed to immigrate to the United States in approximately 2004.
They received permission to submit a petition for an immigrant visa in 2016. The petition
was  approved  by  United  States  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Services,  part  of  the
Department of Homeland Security, in early 2017. In May 2017 they began the process
with  the  Department  of  State’s  National  Visa  Center  (NVC)  to  obtain  immigrant  visas.
(Tr. 43-44; Answer.)
Through  an  authorized  third  party  Mr.  and  Mrs.  A  gathered  the  required
documents,  and  also  paid  the  required  fees.  This  took  several  months,  primarily
because of the requirement to get a police check from the countries where Mr. and Mrs.
A  live.  In  this case  that  was  both  Syria  and Saudi  Arabia.  (Tr. 33-34, 46-48;  Applicant
Exhibits A and B.)
NVC  notified  Mr.  and  Mrs.  A  that  all  the  required  paperwork  was  received  on
April 11, 2018. At that point they entered the queue for an appointment with a consular
official at the United States Embassy in Amman, Jordan. (Applicant Exhibit F.)
Mr. and Mrs. A were notified on June 2, 2018, that there interview was scheduled
for July 29, 2018. Mr. and Mrs. A were required to travel to Beirut, Lebanon and fly on a
specific  airline  flight  to  Amman  at  least  five  days  before  their  interviews.  Applicant
supplied  a  copy  of  the  airline  reservation  for  Mr.  and  Mrs.  A  that  fulfilled  this
requirement.  No  other  information  was  available  as  the  record  closed.  (Applicant
Exhibits H and I.)
Applicant is proud to be an American citizen stating, “I have to build myself from
scratch.  So  United  States  allowed  me  to  do  so.”  Applicant  has  been  taking  college
classes in his area of work, achieving the Dean’s List at his college in 2011. He is well-
respected  at  his  job,  receiving  a  promotion  and  other  recognition.  (Tr.  20-22,  24,  58;
Applicant Exhibits C, D, E, F.)
Applicant is very aware  of his responsibilities if he obtains a security clearance,
particularly  if  advances  are  made  toward  him  or  his  relatives.  He  is  also  aware  of  his
employer’s requirements concerning foreign travel. (Tr. 55-57.)
Syria
I  take  administrative  notice  of  the  following  facts  concerning  Syria:  Since  1979,
the  United  States  has  designated  Syria  a  State  Sponsor  of  Terrorism.  There  is  an
increased risk of kidnapping of U.S. citizens and westerners throughout Syria. The U.S.
Department  of  State  has  a  level  4  travel  advisory  in  effect  for  Syria,  which  advises
against all travel to Syria. (Government Exhibit 3: Attachments.)

his  current  employer  since  2015.  He  seeks  to  obtain  a  security  clearance.  He  has  a
master’s degree, which was awarded in 2013. He is married with three children.1
Applicant was born in Iraq to Iraqi parents. He attended college in Iraq. He then
performed  his  mandatory  service  in  the  Iraqi  military  for  two  years.  He  worked  under
dangerous  conditions  as  a  linguist  with  the  U.S.  military  in  Iraq  from  2005  to  2007.
Because  of  his  work  with  the  military,  he  was  eligible  for  a  special  immigrant  visa.
Applicant and his immediate family immigrated to the United States in 2007. He became
a U.S. citizen in 2013, while maintaining his Iraqi citizenship. His wife and three children
also became U.S. citizens.2
Applicant’s father is deceased. His mother, four siblings, and parents-in-law are

father-in-law retired from the Iraqi military. He receives a pension for his service, but he
has no other ongoing connection to the Iraqi military or the Iraqi government.3
Applicant’s grandfather passed away in 2007 or earlier. Before he immigrated to
the United States, Applicant bought the family home in Iraq for the equivalent of about
$15,000. His mother was living in the house at the time. He bought the house so that his
brother  could  live  in  the  house  and  take  care  of  his  elderly  mother.  Applicant  has  no
intention to ever return to live in the house. He estimated the current value of the house
to be between about $40,000 and $45,000. He also owns a house in the United States
that he purchased in 2009.4
Applicant regularly contacts his mother by telephone. He will speak to his brother

used to coerce or intimidate him into revealing classified information.6
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in

service;  real  estate  in  a  foreign  country;  financial  support  for  a  foreign  national;  and
voting  in  a  foreign  election.  Applicant  testified  that  he  did  not  intend  to  provide  false
information. He did not think he had to report the information about Iraq, because as an
Iraqi  citizen,  Iraq  was  not  a  foreign  country  to  him.7  One  of  the  primary  definitions  of
foreign  by Merriam-Webster’s  dictionary  is “situated  outside  one’s  own  country.”  Since
Iraq was one of Applicant’s two countries, his interpretation is not unreasonable. In any

Applicant immigrated to the United States under a Special Immigrant Visa (SIV)
in  2010.  He  was  granted  this  status  under  a  program  that  allowed  a  small  number  of
translators, who had worked with the U.S. military in Iraq, and met certain requirements,
to immigrate to the United States. Two requirements of the program are, “The individual
has provided faithful and valuable service to the United States Government,” and “The
individual  .  .  .  has  experienced  or  is  experiencing  an  ongoing  serious  threat  as  a
consequence  of  the  employment  by  or  on  behalf  of  the  United  States  Government.”

described  by  one  officer  as  participation  in  “neighborhood  clearances,  as  well  as
countless combat patrols in a variety of densely populated neighborhoods in Baghdad.”
The  officer  goes  to  state  that  Applicant  was  “always  prepared  to  perform  his  duties
despite enemy contact on several occasions.” (Applicant Exhibits B and C.)
Applicant continued to do outstanding work in his current assignment in Jordan.
This is attested to by the letter of recommendation from the commander of the unit he
supported. (Applicant Exhibit A.)
Applicant is very aware of his  responsibilities if he obtains a security clearance,
particularly if advances are made toward him or his relatives. (Tr. 25-26.)
Iraq
I take administrative notice of the following facts: In 2003, The United States led
a  coalition  to  remove  Saddam  Hussein  from  power  in  Iraq.  After  free  elections,  Iraq’s
new  government  took  office.  Despite  the  elections  and  new  government,  Iraq  remains
engulfed  in  violence,  perpetrated  by  Al  Qaeda  terrorists  and  other  insurgents.
Numerous attacks and kidnappings have targeted the U.S. Armed Forces, contractors,
and other civilians, as well as Iraqis. Even with aggressive governmental action against
terrorists,  the  threat  of  terrorism  in  Iraq  remains  high.  Terrorist  groups  conduct
intelligence activities as effectively as state intelligence services. (Government Exhibit 6:
Attachments.)
When  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability  for  national  security  eligibility  and  a
security  clearance,  the  administrative  judge  must  consider  the  adjudicative  guidelines
",True
"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted some of the SOR allegations and
denied  others.  His  admissions  are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a
thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the
following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 56 years old. He was born in the United States. He graduated from
high school and enlisted in the U. S. Air Force in 1982. He served over 23 years and
was honorably discharged as a senior master sergeant (pay grade E-8). He deployed
numerous  times  while  in  the  Air  Force.  He  has  worked  as  a  government  contractor
since 2007. He also deployed numerous times as a contractor to such places as Iraq,
Kuwait, and Afghanistan. Applicant married his wife in 1985. They met in Korea when
he was stationed there. She was a Korean citizen when they met and later became a
naturalized U.S. citizen. They have two adult children. He has held a security clearance
for over 30 years. (45-46, 48; GE 1: AE A)
Under Guideline B, the SOR alleged that Applicant engaged in a personal and
online  relationship  with  a  citizen  and  resident  of  Lebanon  (LC)  from  approximately
1989 until at least March 2017. (¶ 1.a) Under Guideline E, the SOR cross-alleged the
same  conduct  as  listed  above.  (¶  2.a)  It  also  alleged  that  Applicant  failed  to  fully
disclose  or  report his  relationship  to  LC  to his  wife  or  to  appropriate  security  officials;
that  Applicant  failed  to  fully  disclose  or  report  that  while  deployed  to  Afghanistan  he
traveled  to  Lebanon  to  visit  LC;  that  Applicant  failed  to  disclose  his  close  and
continuing  contact  with  LC  on  his  December  2011  and  May  2016  security  clearance
applications (SCA); and that he failed to list his personal foreign travel in his May 2016
SCA. (¶¶ 2.b-2.g)
Applicant first  contacted  LC  in  approximately  1989. They  met over  the Internet
using  a  social  media  chat  site.  From  1989  through  approximately  2000,  Applicant
maintained  contact  with  LC  on  a  weekly  basis  using  Internet  chat  rooms.  In  January
2008, Applicant traveled to Lebanon and met LC. Applicant traveled to Lebanon when
he was given leave while on deployments. He usually stayed about five days. He made
additional  trips  to  Lebanon  in  September  2008,  July  2010,  November  2010,  and
September  into  October  2011.  He  was  in  contact  with  LC  on  each  visit.  He  took  the
initiative to contact her when he arrived. In his March 2017 background interview with a
defense investigator (PSI), Applicant initially denied having any foreign travel except for
trips  to  Mexico  and  the  Philippines.  He  only  admitted  his  trips  to  Lebanon  when
confronted  by  the  investigator.  The  investigator  had  to  confront  Applicant  three  times
with  information  about  his  trips  to  Lebanon  before  Applicant  admitted  all  of  his  trips
there. (Tr. 50-51, 91, 99; GE 3 (PSI, pp. 9-10))
Applicant gave conflicting accounts about what he and LC did when they were
together. In his 2017 PSI, he stated that in July 2010 he and LC enjoyed sightseeing
and going to the beach together. He said they did the same thing when he was there in
November  2010.  When  Applicant  described  the  activities  he  did  with  LC  during  his
September  to  October  (five-day)  trip  to  Lebanon,  he  stated  they  went  sightseeing,
visited  the  beach,  and  he  met  LC’s  mother  at  LC’s  parents’  residence.  During  his
hearing  testimony,  Applicant  claimed  he  never  went  sightseeing  with  LC,  nor  did  he
ever  go  to  her  home. He  claimed  the  only  thing  they  ever  did  together  was  go  to  the
beach. He also claimed that he always stayed at a hotel and that LC never visited the
hotel.  He  denied  having  any  sexual  or  romantic  relationship  with  LC.  He  maintained
that  they  were  just  friends.  Applicant  did  not  disclose  this  friendship  to  his  wife  or  to
anyone at work. When asked by the investigator if he disclosed this information to his
wife,  he  replied,  “[if]  you  are  a  wife  would  you  want  to  know  about  another  woman?”
Applicant  elaborated  during  his  testimony  about  why  he  did  not  disclose  this
relationship to his wife. He stated that because of her Korean background and culture
she  would  not  understand  the  relationship.  He  claims  that  he  told  his  wife  about  the
relationship  in  2016.  His  wife  took  the  news  hard,  but  has  forgiven  him.  (Tr.  49,  81,
101-103; GE 3 (PSI, pp. 9-10))
Applicant also gave conflicting accounts as to when he stopped the relationship
with LC. In his March 2017 PSI to the investigator, he stated that he had at least twice
yearly internet contact with LC from October 2011 to December 2016. In March 2018,
Applicant responded to interrogatories and stated under oath that his PSI was accurate
as written and he made no corrections. During his hearing testimony, Applicant claimed
that  his  previous  statement  about  when  the  relationship  ended  was  inaccurate.  He
testified that his Internet contact with LC ceased in 2012. He said he did not review his
statement  in  detail  before  he  swore  under  oath  that  it  was  accurate.  I  do  not  find
Applicant credible. (Tr. 70, 74, 91, 104-105; AE 3)
In  December  2011,  Applicant  completed  and  certified  as  accurate  an  SCA.  In
Section 19 of this SCA, Applicant was asked if he had close and/or continuing contact
with a foreign national, including associates, within the last seven years, with whom he
was  bound  by  “affection,  influence,  common  interests,  and/or  obligations.”  Applicant
answered “no” to this question failing to list his contact with LC. In Section 20C of this
SCA  he  answered  “no”  when  asked  if  all  of  his  foreign  travel,  within  the  last  seven
years,  was  for  U.S.  Government  business.  He  then  listed  his  foreign  travel  which
included  six  trips  to  Lebanon  (1.  December  2003  to  January  2004  (6-10  days);  2.
January  2008  (1-5  days);  3.  September  2008  (1-5  days);  4.  July  2010  (1-5  days);  5.
November 2010 (1-5 days); 6. September to October 2011 (1-5 days)). (GE 2)
In May 2016, Applicant completed and certified as accurate an SCA. In Section
19  of  this  SCA, Applicant  was  asked  if he had  close  and/or  continuing  contact  with  a
foreign  national,  including  associates,  within  the  last  seven  years  with  whom  he  was
bound  by  “affection,  influence,  common  interests,  and/or  obligations.”  Applicant
answered “no” to this question failing to list his contact with LC. In Section 20C of this
SCA  he  answered  “yes”  when  asked  if  all  of  his  foreign  travel,  within  the  last  seven
years, was for U.S. Government business. He failed to visit his foreign trips to Lebanon
during  the  relevant  time.  He  also  failed  to  list  13  trips  to  the  Philippines  within  the
previous seven years. (Tr. 88-89; GE 1, 3)
During his PSI, Applicant stated that he failed to list LC as a foreign contact on
his 2011 and 2016 SCAs “due to oversight.” He gave the same explanation for why he
failed  to  list  his  trips  to  Lebanon  on  his  2016  SCA.  In  his  March  2018  answers  to
interrogatories,  Applicant  changed  his  explanation.  Concerning  failing  to  list  LC  as  a
foreign  contact,  he  stated  he  did  so  because  he  was  “not  bound  to  her  by  affection,
influence,  common  interests,  and/or  obligation  to  her.”  He  further  explained  that  his
reason  for  not  listing  his  foreign  travel  on  his  2016  SCA  was  because  he  was
overworked  and  procrastinated  completing  the SCA and therefore  relied  solely  on his
memory without having access to his previous SCA to retrieve the information. (GE 3)
Applicant testified somewhat consistent with his answers to the interrogatories.
He  did  not  list  LC  on  either  SCAs  because  he  felt  the  question  did  not  apply  to  him
since he was not bound to LC by any of the descriptors. Regarding his failure to list his
foreign  personal  travel  on  his  2016  SCA,  Applicant  testified  that  in  2011  when  he
completed the form he was not under stress from work and had access to his passport
to  accurately  complete  the  2011  SCA.  He  claimed  that  was  not  the  case  when  he
completed his 2016 SCA. He was under stress from work, did not have access to the
information  from  his  2011  SCA,  and  did  not  have  access  to  his  passport.  He  claims
that  he  made  a  mistake  by  not  checking  the  correct  box  concerning  his  foreign
personal  travel,  but  that  he  had  no  intent  to  deceive  with  his  incorrect  answers.  On
cross-examination, he stated that he was not thinking straight when he completed his
2016 SCA. (Tr. 52-53, 55, 57-65, 91-92, 95, 98-99)
Applicant’s  former  supervisor  (W)  testified  for  him  and  provided  a  written
statement.  W  testified  about  the  stressful  conditions  at  work  during  2016  when
Applicant  was  completing  his  SCA.  W  stated  that  he  was  informed  by  the  security
manager that Applicant was not timely completing the SCA and W put pressure on him
to do so. W recommended that Applicant retain his security clearance. (Tr. 27-32, 38;
AE C)
Applicant also provided statements from another supervisor and two coworkers.
They described Applicant as truthful, honest, and forthright. A coworker recommended
that he retain his clearance. (AE B, D-E)
truthful
information
Aside from  Applicant’s  duty  to  accurately  and  truthfully  complete  any  SCA  and
provide
investigators  during  his  background
investigation, the Government did not produce any evidence that Applicant had a duty
to disclose his relationship with LC to security officials. The Government also failed to
produce  evidence  that  Applicant  had  a  duty  to  report  that  he  traveled  to  Lebanon  to
visit  LC  while  deployed  to  Afghanistan.  The  Government  also  failed  to  produce
evidence that Applicant was made aware of such duties, if they existed.
to  defense
Lebanon
Lebanon  is  a  parliamentary  democracy  in  which  people  have  the constitutional
right to change their government. Due to civil  war the exercise of political rights  were
precluded  until  1992.  Lebanon  has  a  free-market  economy  and  a  strong  laissez-faire
commercial  tradition.  The  economy  is  service-oriented.  The  United  States  enjoys  a
strong exporter position with Lebanon and is its fifth largest source of imported goods.
More  than  160  offices  representing  U.S.  businesses  operate  in  Lebanon.  Since  the
lifting of passport restrictions in 1997, a number of large U.S. companies have opened
branch or regional offices in Lebanon.
The foreign policy of Lebanon reflects its geographic location, the composition of
its  population,  and  its  reliance  on  commerce  and  trade.  Its  foreign  policy  is  heavily
influenced  by  neighboring  Syria,  which  has  also  long  influenced  Lebanon’s  internal
policies as well. Lebanon, like most Arab states, does not recognize Israel, with which
it has been technically at war since Israel’s establishment.
Lebanon has had some human-rights problems including the arbitrary arrest and
detainment  of  individuals  and  instances  of  arbitrary  and  unlawful  deprivation  of  life,
torture, and other abuses.
The  terrorist  group  Hezbollah  is  a  Lebanese-based  radical  Shi’a  group  and  is
designated by  the  United  States  as  a  “Foreign  Terrorist  Organization.” The  Lebanese
government recognizes Hezbollah as a “legitimate resistance group” and political party
and  until  recently  was  represented  by  elected  officials  in  the  Lebanese  parliament.
Hezbollah  also  provides  support  to  several  Palestinian  terrorist  organizations  and  is
known  to  be  involved  in  numerous  anti-United  States and  anti-Israeli  terrorist attacks.
Americans have been the targets of numerous terrorist attacks in Lebanon.
The United States seeks to maintain its traditionally close ties with Lebanon and
to  help  preserve  its  independence,  sovereignty,  national  unity,  and  territorial  integrity.
Other  terrorist  organizations  operating  in  Lebanon  include:  Al-Nusrah  Front  (ANF),
Hamas,  and  Abdullah  Azzam  Brigades  (AAB).  The  United  States  provides  more  than
$400 million in aid to Lebanon and pledged $1 billion in additional aid. The aid reflects
the  importance  the  United  States  attaches  to  Lebanon’s  development  as  a  unified,
independent and sovereign country.
U.S. citizens who also possess Lebanese nationality may be subject to laws that
impose special obligations on them as Lebanese citizens. The U.S. State Department
issued  a  travel  advisory,  updated  January  2018,  urging  U.S.  citizens  to  reconsider  or
avoid  travel  to  particular  areas  in  Lebanon  due  to  crime,  terrorism,  kidnapping,  and
armed conflict especially near Lebanon’s borders with Syria and Israel.
",False
"Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful
review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant is 38 years old. He never married and has no children. He was born in
Iraq. He did not serve in the Iraqi military. He was granted a Special Immigrant Visa (SIV)
in 2010 and immigrated to the United States that same year. He became a naturalized
citizen of the United States in 2016. He earned an associate’s degree and also became
a certified technician in a medical specialty in 2016. He worked in that field from May 2016
to  May  2017,  when  he  began  training for his  current  job.  Applicant  has  worked for his
current employer, a federal contractor, as a linguist in Iraq since June 2017.2
Applicant worked for U.S. contractors in Iraq at forward operating military bases
from 2004 to 2010. He lived on base and due to the dangerousness of the missions he
was assigned, he rarely went home. He testified that on a daily basis he was involved in
all types of operations and missions, including combat operations. He was also involved
in the arrest of terrorists. He estimated that from 2004 to 2010, he participated in 800 to
1,000  missions  “outside  the  wire,”  meaning  off-base  and  was  subjected  to  combat
situations with U.S. military forces. He testified that his unit was attacked on numerous
occasions. One of the times, he was in a Humvee when it hit an improvised explosive
device. He also participated in missions where there were casualties.3
After being granted an SIV for his service and immigrating to the United States,
Applicant worked from approximately 2011 to 2016 as a security officer and also worked
a second job as a translator.4

3 Tr. 26-29.
4 Tr. 24-25.
Applicant  provided  documents  to  show  he  renounced  his  Iraqi  citizenship  and
relinquished  his  expired  Iraqi  passport.5  He  provided  a  character  letter  from  a  military
officer who is an officer-in-charge and with whom he has worked with in Iraq over the past
two years. The officer stated that in the time they have worked together, which was daily
over the past three months, Applicant has worked on escort missions that required a level
of  discretion.  Applicant  is  described  as  respectful  of  privacy,  protects  information,  and
adheres to rules and restrictions. He has an outstanding work ethic and is considered an
outstanding citizen. He is punctual and does exactly what he is told to do and promptly
completes the assignment. The officer has great trust and faith in Applicant and his loyalty
and integrity is beyond reproach.6
Applicant also provided character letters from those whom he served with before
immigrating  to  the  United  States.  They  say  he  served  honorably  and  enabled  United
States forces to successfully accomplish its missions. He was an integral member of a
platoon, allowing it to successfully engage the local populace and members of the Iraqi
government. He earned the trust of the Iraqi Army and was a vital link for joint American-
Iraqi  cooperation.  On  multiple  occasions,  his  quick  actions  and  understanding  of  both
Iraqi and  American  cultures  assisted  in  allowing  U.S.  forces  to  gain  the  respect  of  the
local populace. He was described as trustworthy and reliable.7
Another  character  letter from  a  military  officer  that  Applicant  served  with  in  Iraq
stated that he was dedicated to his duty and a true professional while working with forces
in  hazardous  environments.  He  aided  platoons  successfully  in  their  daily  combat
missions. He was considered honest and hard working.
Applicant has no financial interests in Iraq. He and his brother own a house in the
United States, which they purchased in 2017. They both pay the mortgage on the house,
and  when  Applicant  is  in  the  United  States,  he  lives  with  his brother  and  his  brother’s
family.  He  also  owns  two  older  model  vehicles  and  a  third  he  owns  with  his  brother.
Applicant  contributes  to  an  Individual  Retirement  Account.  In  2018,  he  earned
approximately $73,000 in income. He has approximately $90,000 in a savings account in
the United States. He intends to retire in the United States.8
Applicant has three brothers. His brother with whom he purchased a house with,
immigrated to the United States in 2011  on an SIV, which he obtained because of his
service  to  the  United  States.  He  is  a  security  officer.  His  brother  and  his  wife  are
permanent residents of the United States and his brother has applied to be a naturalized
citizen. He has his interview scheduled in the coming weeks. They have four children.9

One brother joined the Iraqi Army in the 1990s. He is a citizen and resident of Iraq.
Applicant  stated  that  after  the  Iraqi  invasion  of  Kuwait,  the  Iraqi  security  forces  were
dissolved, so his brother was not a part of the army at that time. His brother worked for
the  United  States  military  before  returning  to  the  Iraqi  Army  in  approximately  2006  or
2007. Applicant does not know what his brother’s military occupation is, but believes it is
administrative. He holds the rank of major. The last time Applicant saw this brother was
in January 2010. His brother is married with two children. Applicant speaks to him about
once or twice a year. He last spoke with this brother about three months ago.10
Another brother of Applicant’s worked as a carpenter for the United States forces
from 2004 to 2007. He travels to the country of Georgia where he works as a property
manager of real estate. He also worked in Iraq for the Ministry of Oil and Minerals. He
has been on leave from this positon for the past four years because the factory is closed.
He receives partial pay while it is closed. Applicant has only visited this brother once in
person since 2010. He visited him in Georgia in 2018, because Applicant’s visa expired,
and Applicant had to leave Iraq. He stayed in Georgia with his brother until his visa was
renewed. He has quarterly telephonic contact. He provided this brother some money in
approximately 2014 or 2015, when his brother was in Georgia.11
Applicant has six sisters who are citizens and residents of Iraq. Their information
is as follows:
Sister  #1  was  born  in  1962  and  is  married  with  four  children.  Applicant’s  last
contact with her was by phone in 2014. Her husband’s occupation is unknown.12
Sister #2 was born in 1964 and is married with children. Applicant does not know
how many children. He believes her husband works in construction. His last contact with
her was in 2009.13
Sister #3 was born in 1966. She is a widow with four children. She is also a teacher
Applicant has not spoken to her since 2015.14
Sister #4 was born in 1968 and is single. She is a teacher and lives in Iraq with
their two brothers and a sister in the same house. Applicant has not seen her since 2010.
He last spoke with her about eight months ago by phone. He does not provide her or any

other  siblings  financial  support,  except  as  noted  to  above  to  his  one  brother.  The  four
siblings in Iraq have applied for immigration visas to the United States.15
Sister #5 was born in 1972 and is a teacher. Applicant spoke her with about ten
months  ago.  She  was  not  married  at  the  time,  but  he  believes  she  has  subsequently
married. She lives in Iraq with her brothers and sister. Applicant has contact with her once
or twice a year.16
Sister #6 was born in 1974. She is a teacher, who is married and has no children.
Applicant  does  not  know  her  husband’s  occupation.  He  last  spoke  to  her  by  phone  in
2014.17
Applicant’s  two  brothers  and  two  of  his  sisters  moved  to  another  area  of  Iraq
because  it  was  safer  and  away  from  areas  that  ISIS  had  infiltrated.  They  share  living
quarters.18
Applicant also has a half-sister. She is his mother’s daughter from his mother’s first
marriage. She was born in 1955. His last contact with her was in 2010. He does not know
her husband’s occupation.19
Applicant testified that he has supported the United States and its military forces
for many years. He is loyal to the United States and no other country. He does not intend
to return to Iraq to live. There is nothing there for him. He said that other than a few phone
calls to his family there, his life is in the United States. Although not asked to do so, he
said he is willing to sever all familial ties in Iraq. His current responsibilities in Iraq are to
escort supply convoys.20
IRAQ
The United States Department of State warns that U.S. citizens in Iraq remain at
high risk for kidnapping and terrorist violence and to avoid all travel to Iraq. The ability of
the  U.S.  Embassy  to  provide  consular  services  to  U.S.  citizens  outside  Baghdad  is
extremely  limited  given  the  security  environment.  ISIS  controls  a  significant  portion  of
Iraq’s territory. Within areas under ISIS control, the Iraqi government has little or no ability
to control and ensure public safety.

Numerous terrorist and insurgent groups are active in Iraq, including ISIS. Such
groups regularly attack both Iraqi security forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias
may  also  threaten  U.S.  citizens  and  western  companies  throughout  Iraq.  U.S.
Government and western interests remain possible targets for attacks.
The  U.S.  Government  considers  the  potential  personal  security  threats  to  U.S.
government personnel in Iraq to be serious enough to require them to live and work under
strict security guidelines.
There are significant human rights problems in Iraq to include: sectarian hostility,
widespread corruption, lack of transparency at all levels of government and society that
have  weakened  the  government’s  authority  and  worsened  effective  human  rights
protections.  Iraqi  security  forces  and  members  of  the  Federal  Police  have  committed
human rights violations to include killing, kidnapping, and extorting civilians.  There are
also problems that include harsh and life-threatening conditions in detention and prison
facilities, arbitrary arrest and lengthy pretrial detainment, denial of fair public trial, limits
on freedom of expression, freedom of the press, censorship of religion, limits on peaceful
assembly,  and  societal  abuses  of  women.  ISIS  is  also  responsible  for  human  rights
abuses.
",True
"Applicant  is  a  42-year-old  architect  who  has  worked  for  the  same  employer,  a
defense  contractor,  for  about  two  years.  He  specializes  in  architecture  and  urban
planning.  He  has  earned  two  bachelor’s  degrees  and  a  master’s  degree.  Born  in  the
United States, he is married and has two minor children.
In  2010,  Applicant’s  father,  a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen,  moved  back  to  the
Philippines  to  care  for  his  ailing  mother,  Applicant’s  grandmother.  Applicant’s  father
bought a condominium in the Philippines after the move, and also had his name put on
property owned by his own parents before they died. (Tr. 18)  He did so to facilitate its
transfer  upon  the  death  of  Applicant’s  grandparents.  More  recently,  Applicant’s  father
has decided to retire primarily in the Philippines in order to be close to family.2 (Tr. 20)
Applicant testified that his father subsequently decided to have Applicant put his name
on the properties because:
In  the  Philippines,  if  you  try  to  inherit  property  .  .  .  it’s  darn  near
impossible.  Pretty  much  the  government  will  take  most  if  not  all  of  it
through  inheritance. The  typical  way  people  go  and  inherit  property  is  by
transfer  and/or by  putting  a  second  name on  the  deed  title. And  the  only
way you’re allowed to have our [sic] name on a deed title in the Philippines
is if you were also a Filipino citizen. The Philippines does not allow foreign
nationals to go and own property in the Philippines . . . .  (Tr. 19)
First, however, Applicant had to become a citizen of the Philippines.
Applicant learned that as a child of two native-born Philippine citizens, he could

recognized dual-citizenship with the U.S. and the Philippines.3 He pursued this avenue
despite  having  “no  interest  .  .  .  I’m  doing  this  out  of  an  abundance  of  respect  for  my
father. I see him very infrequently . . . maybe once a year. I might correspond with him
via  email  or a  version of  text  message  maybe  a handful  of  times.” (Tr.  20)  Applicant’s
intention is to sell the property when his father passes away as he has no need for the
property or its financial benefits. He noted, “if I don’t get a dime it will not bother me in
the slightest. . . . Whether I get any money for it doesn’t matter to me.” (Tr. 20-21, 40)
In contrast to his potential future interest in the Philippines, Applicant was born,
raised, and educated in the United States. He and his wife have built their home and are
raising their family within their community, where they are highly involved in a variety of
capacities.  (Tr.  23)  The  family  is  very  involved  with  their  church  and  its  various
committees.  Currently  a  homemaker,  Applicant’s  wife,  a former  professor,  is  an  active
volunteer.4  She  plans  to  continue  in  that  capacity  until  her  children  are  a  little  older.
Applicant maintains close contact with his divorced mother and his in-laws, all of whom
live in the same region. He has worked for his current employer and several state and
local  governments  over  his  career,  earning  him  a  solid  professional  reputation.  The
family is “more than comfortable without any other financial assistance.” (Tr. 21)
Applicant maintains his checking, savings, and retirement accounts in the United
States.  His  personal  retirement  account  amounts  to  about  $200,000,  he  keeps  about
$10,000 in liquid assets, and their home is worth about $350,000. Both his children are
enjoying the local public schools, where Applicant and his wife are active. The children
are busy with multiple extracurricular and community activities. Applicant does not have
a valid Philippine passport, nor does he speak the Tagalog language. (Tr. 21, 41)
At issue are three properties in the Philippines, noted in the SOR at 1.b-1.d The
property at 1.b, in which Applicant’s father resides, is jointly owned by Applicant’s father,
half-sister,  and  Applicant.5  Technically,  the  father  is  the  primary  owner  with  Applicant
and  his  half-sister  listed  as  secondary  interests  on  the  deed.  Located  in  the  vicinity  of
Metro Manila, this condominium is currently worth about $100,000.6 (Tr. 34) A parking
space for that unit is valued at about $7,000.
The  property  at  1.c,  which  is  located  in  the  same  region,  is  a  condominium
currently  under  construction.  This  smaller  property,  valued  as  potentially  worth  about
$40,000,  is  similarly  co-owned  by  Applicant’s  father,  half-sister,  and  Applicant.  An
associated  parking  place  is  valued  at  approximately  $5,800.  This  property  was
3 Because the application for retroactive citizenship does not actually seek Philippine citizenship, but only
the  acknowledgment  that  Applicant  automatically  became  a  Philippine  citizen  upon  birth  to  two  native
Philippine citizens, it does not constitute an application to become a Philippine citizen. (Tr. 31-32)
4 No evidence was offered regarding Applicant’s wife’s finances, savings, future interests, etc.
5 Applicant’s half-sister also has no interest in the properties at issue or relocating from the United States
to the Philippines. Here, she has a family, children, and career. (Tr. 40) Should she later take an interest
in one or more of the properties, Applicant will sign over his interests to her.

Department advises U.S. citizens to use particular caution.
purchased during the pre-construction stage. Applicant’s father intends to eventually sell
his current condominium and downsize into this property.
The property at 1.d is a new residential apartment building consisting of 26 units
and  valued  at  about  $400,000.  The  building  is  currently  jointly  owned  in  the  same
manner as the other properties, with Applicant’s father as primary owner. In about 2015,
Applicant’s  grandparent’s  home  and  office  was  razed  in  order  to  build  this  structure.
Units are currently available for rent. (Tr. 39)
In  addition,  Applicant  is  a  signatory  on  his  father’s  various  savings  accounts  in
the Philippines. (Tr. 45) He was put on to these accounts to facilitate in their liquidation
upon  the father’s  death.  (Tr.  42, 45-46) They  make up his father’s  “play  money,”  cash
the father uses to make investments on the stock market. (Tr. 42) Applicant believes it
amounts  to  about  $50,000.  These  are  distinctly  different  balances  from  the  money
Applicant’s father maintains in U.S. banking institutions in this country. Applicant is not
fully aware of his father’s financial holdings in the United States. His father is 70 years
old, a diabetic smoker with serious spinal issues.

"The SOR alleges under Guideline B that Applicant’s spouse is a Russian citizen
(SOR ¶ 1.a); that Applicant’s stepdaughter (SOR ¶ 1.b), parents-in-law (SOR ¶ 1.c), and
two  sisters-in-law  (SOR  ¶  1.d)  are  resident  citizens  of  Russia;  that  Applicant  provides
financial support to his stepdaughter in Russia (SOR ¶ 1.e); and that Applicant’s spouse
has an ownership interest in property in Russia (SOR ¶ 1.f). When he responded to the
SOR allegations, Applicant admitted the foreign ties, but he also explained that his spouse
has  U.S.  permanent  residency,  and  that  she  submitted  the  paperwork  required  to
continue her green card. He indicated that while both of his spouse’s sisters are Russian
citizens, one of her sisters has been a resident of the United States since 2008 and has
U.S. permanent residency. Applicant explained that his stepdaughter is employed as an
elementary  school  teacher  in  Russia,  and  he  no  longer  provides  her  any  financial
assistance. Applicant admitted that his spouse shares ownership of her former residence
in Russia with her daughter, but she intends to transfer full ownership to her daughter.
Applicant explained that his spouse will have to renew her internal Russian passport to
transfer  the  property,  which  she  intends  to  do  when  they  travel  to  Russia  to  see  her
daughter in 2018. (Answer.)
After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant is a 57-year-old computer systems engineer with a bachelor’s degree in
electrical engineering awarded in 1983. During his senior year of college, Applicant was
in a U.S. military engineering program. On his graduation, he honorably served on active
duty in the United States military until September 1987. He held a security clearance for
his military duties and was trained to recognize potential threats from foreign sources. He
was discharged from the inactive reserve in 1994. Applicant then spent his career in the
commercial sector before commencing his current employment with a defense contractor
in May 2016 after receiving an interim security clearance. (GEs 1-2; AE E; Tr. 131-136,
144-145.)
Applicant was married to his first wife from 1989 to 2009. He has two sons ages
26 and 16 and two daughters ages 23 and 19 from that marriage. He bought his present
home in 1990. (GE 1.) He started dating about six years after his divorce, but he traveled
too much for the women he dated, some of whom he met on U.S. online dating sites. He
then  viewed  several  dating  websites  based  abroad,  including  Asian,  South  American,
Ukrainian, and Russian websites. (Tr. 147-149.)
In  late  July  2014,  Applicant  voluntarily  resigned  from  his  job  to  take  a  one-year
break  from  employment  to  travel,  including  with  his  son,  who  was  serving  in  the  U.S.
military. (Tr. 163.) In September 2014, Applicant began corresponding  with his current
spouse, a native Russian citizen, whose profile he accessed on a British dating website.
She was born in 1971, when the country was part of the Soviet Union. She never joined
the  Communist  party  but  was  a  member  of  a  conservative  youth  organization  while
growing up. Her parents were teenagers when she was born, and  they divorced when
she and her twin sister were in elementary school. After her parents’ divorce, Applicant’s
spouse and twin sister lived in their grandparents’ home, initially with their mother. Their
mother, who twice remarried, lived with them on and off. At times, she resided in the same
city, and Applicant’s spouse and her sister were able to visit their mother. Their father
was  out  of  their  lives  until  they  were  in  high  school,  and  he  began  to  tutor  them  in
mathematics to prepare for their university studies. Their father had remarried and had a
family of his own. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 46-48, 56-57, 70-71, 75-76, 100.)
Applicant’s spouse was an exchange student in the United States during the 1990
to 1991 academic school year. After graduating from a Russian university with a degree
in mathematics, she married in 1992, and had a daughter a year later. She and her first
husband  divorced  in  2001.  Her  ex-husband  is  an  electrical  engineer  and  works  for  a
manufacturing company. Applicant’s spouse focused on raising her daughter and working
as a senior manager in the commercial sector. In March 2013, Applicant’s spouse and
her daughter purchased the apartment in Russia in which her daughter currently resides.
Applicant’s spouse owns a 40% interest in the property. (GEs 1-2; AEs D, H; Tr. 53-56,
77, 80.)
After some email exchanges and Skype contact with his spouse, Applicant traveled
to Russia to meet his spouse in person in October 2014. Because he stayed in her private
home,  he  and  his  spouse  registered  his  stay  with  the  local  police  as  was  required  by
Russian  law.2    She  showed  Applicant  around  Moscow,  and  they  had  dinner  with  her
daughter during that trip. After that visit, in November 2014, Applicant applied for a fiancée
visa for his spouse to immigrate to the United States in case they developed a lasting
relationship. She was reluctant because she wanted to stay in Russia until her daughter
2 Information from the U.S. State Department indicates that U.S. citizens traveling on U.S. passports are
required to have a current U.S. passport and appropriate visa for entry to Russia, and to obtain a visa, there
must  be  a  Russian  sponsoring  organization  or  individual.  Foreigners  entering  Russia  are  fingerprinted.
Stays in Russia exceed seven days require registration of both visa and migration card with the General
Administration for Migration Issues of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and passports and migration cards
must be carried at all times while in Russia. The migration card is provided by border officials on entry into
Russia.  See U.S. State Department’s publication Quick Facts—Russia, update on March 30, 2018, which
may  be  accessed  at  www.state.gov.  Applicant’s  spouse  as  a  Russian  citizen  presumably  sponsored
Applicant’s entry.
had graduated from college and started a career, but agreed after Applicant promised to
support her daughter until her daughter graduated from college. Applicant’s intention was
not to pressure his spouse. He wanted to start what he believed would be a multi-year
process. (GE 1; AE G; Tr. 57-61, 106, 137-138.)
In January 2015, Applicant’s spouse came to the United States on a tourist visa
to see Applicant and meet his family.3 She traveled on her Russian passport valid to 2020.
In  March  2015,  she  returned  to  the  United  States  and  stayed  with  Applicant  for
approximately six months. Applicant sent $3,000 in financial support to his stepdaughter
in college in Russia during that time. His stepdaughter was initially able to find only a part-
time job on her graduation from college in June 2015.  In September 2015,  Applicant’s
spouse  returned  to  Russia  to  complete  the  requirements  for  her  fiancée  visa.  She
immigrated to the United States on that visa in early October 2015, and she and Applicant
married later that month. In December 2015, Applicant and his spouse sent her daughter
$600 as a Christmas gift. In March 2016, Applicant’s spouse acquired U.S. permanent
residency status valid for two years. (GEs 1-2; AEs A, C; Tr. 58-61, 91-92, 111, 114-117,
137, 164.) She began working part time as a receptionist at a school. (Tr. 63.)
In December 2015, Applicant lost his job in a layoff. In late March 2016, Applicant
completed and certified to the accuracy of a Questionnaire for National Security Positions
(SF 86) for a position with his employer that was contingent on him obtaining an interim
security clearance. He disclosed that his spouse and her twin sister are Russian citizens
residing  in  the  United  States  with  U.S.  permanent  residency,  but  that  his  spouse’s
daughter, parents, and a younger half-sister are Russian resident citizens.4 He indicated
that his spouse’s daughter worked at a government school in Russia. She started that job
in January 2016. (AE B.) Applicant explained that he had met his stepdaughter during his
trip to Russia in October 2014. Applicant also indicated that his spouse’s mother, who is
retired, had visited him and his spouse in the United States in July 2015. Applicant had
not met his spouse’s father, who was employed by a Russian university. Applicant had
limited  contact  with  his  spouse’s  half-sister  in  Russia  and  knew  nothing  about  her
employment.  Applicant  disclosed  that  his  spouse  has  a  foreign  financial  interest
consisting  of  a  40%  share  in  property  worth  about  $38,000  USD  co-owned  with  her
daughter in Russia. Applicant also disclosed that he had provided approximately $3,400
in financial support for his stepdaughter before she graduated from college in 2015, but
has since then only sent birthday and Christmas gifts. Applicant listed his foreign trip to
Russia in October 2014 to meet his spouse. (GE 1.)
In April 2016, Applicant and his spouse traveled to her native city in Russia for ten
days  to  visit  her  relatives,  including  her mother,  half-sister,  and  paternal  grandmother.
(AE  H;  Tr.  61.)  They  spent  most  of  their  time  there  and  went  to  a  restaurant  with  her
3 Applicant’s spouse apparently had a three-year tourist visa, which she obtained to visit her twin sister who
has lived in the United States since 2008. (Tr. 116.)

51.)
family,  including  her  father  and  half-brother,  to  celebrate  their  October  2015  wedding.
They stayed with his spouse’s half-sister when in Russia. None of his spouse’s relatives
asked them for information that would be of possible interest to the Russian government,
including its intelligence services. At Applicant’s request, they went to his stepdaughter’s
school  where  he  answered  questions  for  some  of  the  students.5  Applicant’s  spouse
translated for him because he does not speak Russian apart from a few words. Later that
day, they met with some high school students who asked Applicant questions, primarily
in English, about life, schools, and culture in the United States. (AE H; Tr. 61-68, 107-
108, 142.)
In January 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the
Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM).  Applicant  explained  that  he  met  his  spouse
through an online dating website, and in October 2014, he traveled to Russia to meet her
in person. He listed in-person contact with his spouse in November 2014, January 2015,
and from March 2015 to September 2015, before their marriage in the United States in
October 2015.  Applicant indicated that he had in-person contact with his stepdaughter
three times, and contact with her by social media weekly. Applicant denied having met
his father-in-law in person, and that he had any contact with his father-in-law.6 He related
that he had social media contact on a weekly basis with his mother-in-law in Russia and
with his spouse’s twin sister in the United States. As for his spouse’s half-sister in Russia,
Applicant indicated that he had in-person contact with her in June 2015, and contact by
social  media  once  a  quarter.  He  denied  any  knowledge  of  her  occupation  or  of  her
employment. Applicant indicated that his spouse still co-owned her former residence in
Russia. (GE 2.)
In mid-January 2017, Applicant sent his stepdaughter $1,350, of which $1,000 was
a  combined  birthday  and  Christmas  present  for  her.  The  $350  was  Applicant  and  his
spouse’s contribution to the cost of a burial headstone for his spouse’s grandmother. (AE
C; Tr. 155-156.) In May 2017, his stepdaughter was awarded her master’s degree. (AE
B.)
Applicant’s spouse has been employed full time since early 2017 for a commercial
company. (Tr. 63.) She does not intend to return permanently to Russia. (Tr. 89.) She
applied to renew her U.S. permanent residency, and on January 2018, the United States
extended  her  conditional  resident  status  for  one  year  authorizing  her  continued
employment and travel in the United States pending a decision on her petition to remove
the conditions on her U.S. residency. (AE A; Tr. 90.) She has not notified the Russian
5 Applicant indicated in his Answer that his stepdaughter started permanent employment as an elementary
school teacher in January 2016. Applicant’s spouse testified that her daughter does not have a teaching
degree. She is “a psychologist with the sake of kids.” (Tr. 83.) It is unclear whether her daughter teaches
or is a school psychologist at the government-owned elementary school.
6 This denial of any in-person contact with his father-in-law as of January 2017 contradicts other evidence.
At his hearing, Applicant and his spouse acknowledged that they traveled to Russia in April 2016. Applicant
had not met his father-in-law when he completed his SF 86 in March 2016. He met his father-in-law at the
party with her family at a restaurant in Russia in April 2016. (Tr. 107-108.)
authorities  of  her  current  address  in  the  United  States  or  of  her  permanent  residency
status  in  the  United  States.7  (Tr.  110.)  She  intends  to  apply  for  U.S.  citizenship  in  the
future. (Tr. 118.)
Applicant’s spouse  exchanges greetings with  her daughter in Russia  every day.
They have a very close relationship and engage in longer conversations every two weeks.
She converses with her daughter in Russian. Her daughter knows little English. Applicant
and  his  spouse  plan  to  travel  to  Russia  to  visit  her  daughter  in  October  2018.  Her
daughter, who is still employed by the elementary school, has no plans to move to the
United  States  and  has  never  traveled  to  the  United  States.  Two  or  three  times,  her
daughter  applied  for  a  visa  to  travel  to  the  United  States  to  visit  her  mother  and  was
denied.  Applicant’s  spouse  believes  the  United  States  denied  a  visa  to  her  daughter
because she is in “a risk category” in that she might not leave the United States were she
to visit. Applicant’s stepdaughter and her boyfriend live in the apartment that she co-owns
with her mother. Since her daughter plans to stay in Russia, Applicant’s spouse intends
to  transfer  full  ownership  to  her  daughter.  Applicant’s  spouse  had  a  Russian  internal
passport that expired in January 2003. She understands that the best way to transfer her
ownership share is to renew her Russian internal passport, and she must be in Russia to
renew it. The Russian internal passport is the primary form of identification for Russian
citizens in Russia. It expired when she turned age 45 in 2016. Applicant’s spouse has no
other financial assets in Russia. (AE A; Tr. 78-82, 86, 92-99, 108-110, 51, 157-160.) Her
Russian  passport  for  international  travel  bears  an  old  address  in  Russia.  She  has  not
made any effort to update her residency information with Russian authorities. She does
not believe that she has any requirement to notify the Russian Embassy. (Tr. 110-111.)
Applicant’s  spouse  has  a  “pretty  good  relationship”  with  her  mother.  They
exchange messages almost daily, usually about her mother’s activities. Her mother has
had no difficulty obtaining and renewing a visa for travel to the United States. She has
visited Applicant and her daughter several times in the United States. She came to the
United  States  most  recently  in  December  2017  and  stayed  in  Applicant’s  home  for  a
couple of months. (Tr. 76-77, 140, 152-153.)
Applicant’s spouse’s contact with her father, who speaks English, has never been
that frequent, and it has lessened over the years as she moved away. After her father’s
second  wife  died,  Applicant’s  spouse  called  her father  two  or  three  times  a  year.  She
called  her  father  only  once  in  2017.  He  does  not  contact  her.  He  is  a  mathematics
professor  at  a  state-owned  university  in  Russia.  Her  father  publishes  internationally  in
English and attends conferences abroad. To Applicant’s spouse’s knowledge, her father
is unaware of Applicant’s employment with a defense contractor. Applicant has had in-
person contact with his father-in-law and spouse’s half-brother on one occasion, at the
wedding party in Russia in April 2016. (AE H; Tr. 50, 71-74, 99-102, 107.)
7As  of  March  2018,  the  U.S.  State  Department  reported  that  Russian  citizens  who  are  legal  permanent
residents  of  the  United  States  must  register  their  foreign  residency  with  Russian  authorities.  See
www.state.gov.
Applicant’s spouse’s twin sister has lived in the United States since 2008. She has
Russian citizenship but U.S. permanent residency with no conditions. She is married to a
U.S. native citizen, who is a Vietnam veteran and works as a computer programmer. She
has a 10-year-old son who is a U.S. citizen. Applicant’s spouse contacts her twin sister
on a regular basis. Her sister does not work outside the home. Applicant and his spouse
have  visited  her  sister,  but  she  has  not  visited  them  in  their  home.  To  Applicant’s
knowledge, his sister-in-law is the only one of her spouse’s relatives who knows that he
has applied for security clearance eligibility. (Tr. 83-84, 103, 153, 160-162.)
Applicant’s spouse has a good relationship with  her much younger half-sister in
Russia.8  They  are  in  communication  with  each  other once  or  twice  a  month.  Her half-
sister is unmarried but has a boyfriend. She speaks English. Applicant’s spouse has a
half-brother (her father’s son from his second marriage) with whom she has contact twice
a year. She has had communication with her father through her half-brother, who also
speaks English. (Tr. 51-52, 85-87, 107.)
Applicant  acknowledges  that  he  cannot  rule  out  the  possibility  of  him  being
improperly  approached for sensitive  information  in the future.  He cites  his intelligence,
patriotism,  and  training,  including  on  his reporting  responsibilities,  as  evidence  that  he
can  be  counted  on  to  fulfill  the  obligations  of  the  secret  clearance  needed  for  his
employment. He recently completed refresher training about the behavioral indicators of
someone who could be a potential threat to the United States. He does not discuss his
job outside of the workplace. (Tr. 142-146.) He testified that he and his spouse are not a
perfect couple in that they have their disagreements and struggle at times to blend their
two cultures. (Tr. 164.)
Applicant received good to excellent ratings in all categories of performance rated
for the period February 2017 through January 2018. (AE F.) Applicant’s current salary is
$120,400  annually.  His  net  worth  in  the  United  States  is  approximately  $400,000.
Applicant estimated that his spouse’s apartment in Russia was worth $50,000 as of May
2018. (Tr. 158-159.)
Administrative Notice
Russia  is  a  highly  centralized,  authoritarian  political  system  dominated  by
President  Vladimir  Putin.  Its  bicameral  federal  assembly  lacks  independence  from  the
executive  branch.  The  United  States  and  Russia  established  diplomatic  relations  in
December 1991 following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The United States has long
sought a full and constructive relationship with Russia and supported Russia’s integration
into  European  and  global  institutions  and  a  deepened  bilateral  partnership  in  security
cooperation  to  reinforce  stability  and  predictability.  In  response  to  Russia  violating
Ukraine’s sovereignty in 2014, the United States downgraded the bilateral political and
military relationship and suspended most bilateral engagement with Russia on economic

issues.  In  addition  to  ongoing  Russian  aggression  in  Georgia  and  Ukraine,  Russia  is
engaged in a campaign to undermine core Western institutions, such as NATO and the
European  Union  to  weaken  faith  in  the  democratic  and  free-market  system.  There  is
currently a low level of trust between the United States and Russia.9
In  December  2014,  Russia’s  Supreme  Court  issued  a  ruling  recognizing  the
Islamic  Group  of  Iraq  and  the  Levant  (ISIL,  aka  ISIS)  as  a  terrorist  organization  and
banning its domestic activity. In response to Russia instituting military operations in Syria
in  September  2015,  ISIL  and  affiliated  terrorist  organizations  have  vowed  retaliatory
terrorist  attacks  in  Russia.  In  response,  Russian  security  services  enhanced  security
measures  at  many  public  venues  in  Russia,  including  tourist  sites.  In  October 2015,  a
Russian  charter  plane  exploded  in  mid-air  over  Egypt  due  to  an  improvised  explosive
device attributed to a terrorist act. The Russian Federation continued to remain a target
of international terrorist groups in 2016. As of February 2017, the U.S. State Department
assessed Moscow as being a critical-threat location for crime and a high-threat location
for terrorist activity directed at or affecting official U.S. government interests.
Serious  human  rights  abuses  persisted  in  Russia  in  2016  and  2017  as  Russia
continues to train and equip pro-Russian forces in regions of eastern Ukraine since the
occupation  and  “annexation”  of  Crimea  in  March  2014.10  The  United  States  considers
Russia’s actions in Crimea to be unlawful and in violation of Ukrainian and international
law,  and,  in  July  2018,  called on  Russia  to end  its  occupation of Crimea.  In  2016  and
2017, Russian authorities conducted politically motivated arrests, detentions, and trials of
Ukrainian  citizens  in  Russia.  Russian  authorities  continued  to  restrict  the  ability  of
Russia’s  citizens  to  choose  their  government  through  free  and  fair  elections  and  to
freedoms  of  expression,  assembly,  association,  and  movement.  The
exercise
government  selectively  employed  repressive  laws  to  harass,  discredit,  prosecute,
imprison,  detain,  fine,  and  suppress  individuals  and  organizations  critical  of  the
government. Other human rights problems included discrimination against minorities and
persons with disabilities; allegations of torture and excessive force by law enforcement;
substandard prison conditions; pressure on the judiciary by the executive branch; lack of
due  process;  extensive  official  corruption;  violence  against  women;  and  trafficking  in

Russia  has  a  history  of  espionage  against  the  United  States.  In  July  2010,  ten
individuals,  nine  of  whom  admitted  to  being  Russian  citizens,  were  expelled  from  the
United States after pleading guilty to conspiring to serve as unlawful agents of the Russian
government within the United States. In January 2011, a former employee of the Central
Intelligence  Agency  serving  a  prison  sentence  for  a  1997  espionage  conviction  was
sentenced  to  eight  more  years  for  passing  information  to  Russia  and  receiving  cash
payments from agents of Russia through his son from 2006 to December 2008. In May
2016, an agent of Russia’s foreign intelligence agency (SVR) working under non-official

cover  as  a  bank  employee  in  Manhattan  was  sentenced  to  30  months  in  prison  for
attempting  to  collect  economic  intelligence  and  recruit  New  York  City  residents  as
intelligence sources for Russia. He conspired with a trade representative of the Russian
government in New York from 2010 to 2014 and with an attaché to Russia’s Permanent
Mission to the United Nations from 2012 to 2013. In July 2016, a dual citizen of the United
States  and  Russia  was  sentenced  to  ten  years in  prison for acting  as  an  unregistered
Russian  government  agent  and  leading  a  scheme  to  illegally  export  controlled
microelectronics technology with military applications to Russia.
Russian  civilian  and  military  intelligence  services  have  been  implicated  in  a
decade-long  campaign  of  cyber  operations  directed  at  the  U.S.  government  and  its
citizens,  which  include  spear-phishing  campaigns  targeting  government  organizations,
critical infrastructure,  think  tanks, universities,  political organizations, and  corporations;
theft of information; and public release of some of this information. Russia has recently
assumed  a  more  assertive  cyber  posture  based  on  its  willingness  to  target  critical
infrastructure  systems  and  conduct  espionage  operations.  The  U.S.  intelligence
community is confident that the Russian government attempted to interfere with the U.S.
presidential  election  in  2016  and  directed  the  hacking  of  emails  of  U.S.  political
organizations  and  disclosure  on  sites  like  DCLeaks.com  and  WikiLeaks.  In  December
2016,  the  U.S.  State  Department  declared  persona  non  grata  35  Russian  officials
operating  in  the  United  States  who  were  acting  in  a  manner  inconsistent  with  their
diplomatic or consular status. This action was taken in response to Russia’s interference
in the U.S. election and a pattern of increased harassment of U.S. diplomats overseas
over  the  past  four  years,  including  a  significant  increase  in  the  last  12  months.  The
harassment involved arbitrary police stops, physical assault, and the broadcast on state
television in Russia of personal details about U.S. personnel that put them at risk. The
U.S.  intelligence  community  believes  Russia  will  remain  a  major  threat  to  U.S.
government, military, diplomatic, commercial, and critical infrastructure.

Iran
Iran is an authoritarian state in which a theocratic religious scholar, the Supreme
Leader, is accountable only to the Assembly of Experts, a popularly elected 86-member
body  of  clerics.  Iran  has  been  considered  to  be  a  State  Sponsor  of  Terrorism  by  the
United  States  since  1984.  Iran  provides  financial  aid,  advanced  weapons  and  tactics,
and  directions  to  militant  and  terrorist  groups  across  the  Middle  East.  Citizens  of  Iran
are  currently  barred  from  entry  into  the  United  States,  with  certain  exceptions.  The
United States has imposed sanctions on Iran for its nuclear-related activities.
The  United  States  does  not  have  diplomatic  relations  with  Iran  and  warns  U.S.
citizens not to travel to Iran due to risks of arbitrary detention and imprisonment. Human
rights  concerns  include:  illegal  detention  in  unofficial  holding  facilities;  torture  and
coerced  confessions;  and  detention  and  harassment  of  journalists,  lawyers,  writers,
bloggers,  dissidents,  and  others  whose  actions  are  deemed  unacceptable.  There  is  a
lack of due process and individuals have limited forms of redress against official abuse.

Iran has targeted the United States and leverages cyber espionage, propaganda,
and attacks to support its security priorities. Iran has been identified by the U.S. Director
of National Intelligence as one of the greatest cyber threats to the United States.

Applicant visited Nigeria in 2013 to attend his brother’s wedding and see his family.
He returned to Nigeria in April 2016 to see his parents, who were ill. In December 2016,
he went back to Nigeria because his father was not doing well and he thought his father
might die. Both parents recovered. They are citizens and residents of Nigeria. (Tr. 25-26)
Applicant’s mother retired from a government position. She was a secret service
officer. She also has owned a small convenience store for many years. Applicant and his
brothers worked in the store while they were growing up. Applicant’s father is retired. He
worked as a quarry manager. He also did commercial driving. (Tr. 27-30; GE 2) In April

for  a  university  doing  administrative  work  and  another  brother  owns  an  entertainment
center. His fourth brother is a resident of Canada since 2002. He works for an insurance
company located there. (Tr. 30-35; Answer)
During the April 2017 background interview, Applicant stated that he contacts his
brother residing in Canada once every two weeks through text messages. He contacts
one brother in Nigeria once a month by text. He contacts his other two brothers in Nigeria

Nigeria
Nigeria faces many challenges fueled by sectarian, religious, and ethnic violence.
Numerous  terrorist  groups  are  increasingly  active  throughout  Nigeria.  Threats  of
kidnapping and violence are high, and the Department of State warns U.S. citizens that
all travel to Nigeria should be avoided. Of particular significance are the poor human rights
record; the active and hostile presence of Boko Haram and ISIS; and other insurgent and
extremist groups that generate instability and openly attack police, security and military
forces, the local populace, and U.S. citizens and interests.

"Applicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has worked for
her  current  employer  since  2015.  She  graduated  from  a  U.S.  high  school  in  1999;
completed an associate’s degree in 2002; received a bachelor’s degree in 2004; and she
completed a master’s degree in 2006 and a master’s in business administration (MBA) in
2010. She has been married and divorced twice, and has a six-year-old daughter born in
the United States.
Applicant was born in Ukraine to Ukrainian parents. She entered the United States
in 1995 with her parents at age 14. Her father worked for the Ukrainian government in the
United States where he held a sensitive leadership position until he retired in 1999. Upon
the completion of her father’s tour in the United States, Applicant’s parents returned to
Ukraine. She stayed in the United States living with high school teachers until she became
18. After that, she supported herself by working two full-time jobs while attending school
at night. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2007, and renounced her Ukrainian
citizenship.
Applicant stayed in the United States because she believed in the American ideas
of freedom, liberty, and the many opportunities offered in the United States that enticed
her. She believed that there would be a better chance of having a future here in the United
States than in Ukraine. She loves the American dream and all the things that are here
that are just so different to those in Ukraine. She testified:
I love this country because this is the only country, as far as I know, in the
world  that  you  could  be  without  any  support  and  by  working  you  could
actually achieve something. You could have an independent life and that's
just  not  possible,  not possible  in  Ukraine  .  .  .  I  really  hope  like  the  whole
world will become one day, you know, part of the United States because it's
just the freedom of minds, the freedom of speech, the, you know, just being
nobody and, achieving, like working and, you know, have a life like that. (Tr.
39-41)
Applicant testified that when her parents left the United States, they did not have
any money to provide her with any financial support. She believes they thought she would
have the Ukrainian government return her home in a week. However, Applicant stayed
and since then, she has not had a lot of contact with her parents. Initially, she just had
telephonic contact, and now she uses computer programs for face-to-face communication
so she could actually see and talk with her mother.
Applicant’s  father  and  mother  are  both  in  their  70s.  Her  parents  and  her  half-
brother are resident-citizens of Ukraine. According to Applicant, her father has not worked
after  he  retired  in  1999.  He  receives  a  pension  from  the  Ukrainian  government,  but
otherwise  he  has  no  contact  with  the  Ukrainian  government  or  its  military  services.
Applicant has contact with her father once a month. Applicant’s mother was a professor
at a Ukrainian university. She currently works as an English tutor. Her mother is having
medical problems. She was treated for cancer during her stay in the United States (1995-
1998) and recently had a delicate operation in her country. Applicant communicates with
her mother about four times a week via electronic means. Her mother visited Applicant in
the United States four times: when she got married, when her daughter was born, when
she  divorced,  and  on  another  occasion.  According  to  Applicant,  her  parents  are  now
aware she works in a national security position.
Applicant’s  half-brother is  married  with  children.  He  is a  systems engineer for  a
private company in Ukraine. They have electronic contact once a month. Between 2002
and  2012,  Applicant  provided  around  $5,000  to  $6,000  in  financial  assistance  to  her
parents and brother. After the birth of her daughter and due to other financial obligations,
she  has  not  provided  any  financial  support  to  her  family  in  Ukraine.  Applicant  has  no
property of financial interests in Ukraine. She believes that because she renounced her
citizenship, she has no right to inherit from her parents and the inheritance will go to her
brother.
Applicant travelled to Ukraine to visit her family in 2003, 2005, and 2007 using her
Ukrainian passport. She received her U.S. passport in 2007-2008 and used it to travel to
Ukraine in 2009, 2010, and 2014. When she travels, she stays with her family in Ukraine
for about 20 days. She does not travel frequently because it takes too long to get to her
parents’ home and she does not want it to interfere with her job.
In 1999, Applicant received an internship from a U.S. agency, and later she was
hired as a consultant and granted a clearance.  She worked for this agency until 2001.
She also was granted a clearance by two other U.S. Government agencies in 2007 and
in 2010.
Applicant presented four references, two testified and two submitted statements.
In  general,  Applicant  is  considered  to  be  a good  American  who  is  trustworthy,  a  hard-
working single mother who is goal oriented, kind to her daughter, and a caring friend. (AE
1  and  2;  Tr.  21-26)  A  vice-president  (VP)  at  the  corporation  where  Applicant  works
provided favorable testimony. He has 23 years of military service experience highlighted
by his work as a senior service executive at a U.S. command, and as chief of a contracting
office for  a  military  service.  He met  Applicant  in  2014  when he  interviewed  her for her
current  position  and  they  have  become  friends.  He  closely  supervised  Applicant  from
early 2015 until November 2018, when he was promoted to his current position.
The  VP  believes  Applicant  is  a  trustworthy  person.  She  is  open,  upfront,  and
honest  in  her  dealings  with  other  people.  In  his  opinion,  Applicant  is  very  loyal  to  the
country that she has adopted and calls her home now. He has no reservations about her
maintaining her clearances. (Tr. 30-37)

married with four children.
Applicant  was  born  in  the  United  States  to  Egyptian  parents.  His  father  worked
for the Egyptian government and was assigned to the United States. Applicant returned
to  Egypt  with  his  family  when  he  was  about  three  years  old.  He  grew  up  and  was
educated  in  Egypt,  but  he  often  visited  the  United  States  and  always  planned  to
eventually move back here. He was hired by a U.S. company after college and worked
in Egypt until about 2013. His job required him to travel frequently to the United States.
Applicant’s  wife  is  from  Egypt,  and  they  were  married  in  Egypt.  Two  of  their
children were born in Egypt and two were born in the United States. All of their children
are U.S. citizens. Applicant moved his family to the United States in 2011. From 2011 to

owns his house in the United States as well as the house next store, which he rents to a
tenant.  He  has  about  $81,000  in  a  retirement  account.  He  credibly  testified  that  his
family and property in Egypt could not be used to coerce or intimidate him into revealing
classified information, and that he would report any attempt to do so.
Applicant is active in his community. He is a volunteer firefighter who was named
Volunteer  Firefighter  of  the  Year  in  2015.  He  started  the  process  to  join  the  National
Guard  in  2017,  but  when  his  wife  became  pregnant,  he  decided  it  would  require  too
much  time  away  from  a  pregnant  wife  and  three  young  children.  Seven  witnesses
testified  on  his  behalf,  and  he  submitted  numerous  documents  and  letters  attesting  to

tax years. At that time his 2015 federal income tax return was not yet due.6
Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator  in  November  2015.  He
disclosed  that  in  September  2015  he  filed  his  2007  through  2011  federal  income  tax
returns. He explained that these tax returns were not timely filed because he was lazy
and did not realize he owed money. He was unaware at that time of the total amount he
owed,  but  stated  that  he  would  possibly  set  up  a  payment  plan.  He  initially  hired  a
professional tax consultant firm to help him, but it went bankrupt.7
Applicant testified that he mailed his 2007, 2008, and 2009 federal tax returns in
2015 and he never heard back from the IRS and the returns were not processed. He said
he called the IRS frequently to find out the returns’ status. 8
Applicant  completed  government  interrogatories.9  In  response  to  inquiries,  he
explained that he failed to file his 2007 through 2011 federal income tax returns. He said
he did not realize at the time that he owed taxes. He stated: “There is not a real reason
for not filing other then I had been burning myself in my work.”10 He stated he had met
with the IRS in December 2016 about negotiating a payment plan or settlement. There
was an error in his 2007 return so he was told it needed to be corrected and resubmitted.
He explained his plan was to hire a tax attorney to complete his taxes, resubmit his 2007
return and negotiate a settlement. He provided the first page of his 2008, 2009 and 2010
IRS  1040  forms  that  only  included  his  income  and  no  other  information.  They  were
stamped by the IRS on December 13, 2016.11
Applicant  completed  additional  government  interrogatories  in  April  2018.  He

IRS  transcripts  confirmed  that  Applicant  submitted  a  2007  IRS  1040  form  in
January 2016, and it was filed in January 2018. Substitute tax returns were prepared by
the IRS for tax year 2008 in May 2010 and for tax year 2009 in August 2011. Applicant
submitted his federal income tax returns to the IRS for tax year 2010 in December 2016;

Applicant  testified  that  he  was  dedicated  to  his  work  and  did  not  practice  due
diligence in timely completing his federal income tax returns. He said he had been working
with a professional tax consultant firm in 2012, but it went bankrupt. He said after that he
was  missing  documents.  He  understood  he  had  a  duty  to  file  his  tax  returns.  He  kept
getting busy and delayed filing his tax returns. He said he was unable to retrieve from the
IRS tax transcripts for 2007 and 2008, because they were too old. He said the reason he
failed to timely file his 2011 through 2016 federal tax returns was because he was trying
to get a tax number for his wife. He was told by the IRS that he was due refunds for certain
tax years, and he should wait for all of the delinquent years to be processed. Applicant
testified that refunds he was entitled to for tax years 2012 through 2016, were applied to
the federal income taxes he owed for tax years 2006, 2007, and 2008. In May 2018, he
withdrew  money  from  his  pension  plan,  paid  the  penalty,  and  paid  the  federal  income
taxes he owed for tax years 2009, 2010 and 2011. Applicant provided an IRS document
that shows he has a zero balance as of January 2019.14
Applicant was asked if he had timely filed his 2017 federal income tax return, which
was due on April 15, 2018. He did not. He stated he filed it about three weeks before his
hearing.  He did not file  an  extension.  He  did  not  have  an explanation for  his failure to
timely file his 2017 federal income tax return. He stated “It was a credit, I didn’t owe”. He
testified that he promised he would file his tax returns on time in the future.15

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted some of the SOR allegations and
denied one (SOR ¶ 1.a). His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After
a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the
following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  44  years old.  He  was  born  in  Djibouti  in  1975.  He  graduated  from
high school there and completed his college in France in 1998. He immigrated to the
United  States  in  2008.  He  became  a  U.S.  citizen  in  November  2015.  He  is  divorced
and has two children. His ex-wife and both children are U.S. citizens and residents. He
is currently unemployed, except he is driving for a car service. (Tr. 7, 26, 31, 33; GE 1,
3 AE D-E)
Under  Guideline  E,  the  SOR  alleged  that  the  Applicant  failed  to  disclose  the
existence  of  two  brothers  and  six  sisters  on  his  April  2017  security  clearance
application  (SCA);  and  that  on  December  2015,  he  sent  threatening  texts  and  voice
messages to a classmate who was in his training class. (¶¶ 1.a-1.b). Under Guideline
B, the SOR alleged that Applicant’s father is a retired Djiboutian congressman; that his
brother is employed by the United Nations office of West Africa; that another brother is
a  colonel  in  the  Djiboutian  Army;  that  two  sisters  are  employed  by  the  Djiboutian
government  agency;  that  another  sister  is  a  former  Djiboutian  congresswoman;  that
another sister is the chief executive officer (CEO) of a major Djiboutian cable channel;
that  a  brother-in-law  is  a  former  Djiboutian  ambassador;  that  a  brother-in-law  is  a
counselor  to  a  Djiboutian  ministry;  and  that  a  brother-in-law  is  a  retired  Djiboutian
cabinet member.
In  approximately  1999,  Applicant  was  hired  by  the  Djibouti  Ministry  of  Foreign
Affairs  and  was  sent  overseas  to  work  as  a  counselor.  His  brother-in-law  was  the
ambassador  to  the  country  at  the  time.  Applicant  later  returned  to  Djibouti  and  quit
working  for the  government.  He  joined an opposition political party  and began  writing
newspaper  articles  in  support  of  this  political  movement.  He  claimed  these  actions
caused  derision  with  his  family.  He  subsequently  sought  and  was  granted  political
asylum in the United States. He has not traveled outside the United States since 2008.
(Tr. 26, 28; GE 3; AE D)
In  December  2015,  while  attending  a  police  academy  course,  Applicant
threatened  a  school  administrator  and  a  fellow  student  because  he  was  failing  the
course. The  threats  were  communicated by telephone and  text  messages.  Several of
the  texts  were  captured  and  submitted  to  school  authorities.  Applicant  admitted  this
behavior  in  his  answer.  As  a  result  of  his  actions,  Applicant  was  expelled  from  the
academy,  barred  from  the  academy  campus,  and  charged  with  criminal  harassment.
He  was  convicted  and  sentenced  to one  year of  probation, fined, required  to  perform
community service, and attend anger management. He has had no similar incidents. I
note  that  when  Applicant  was  asked  about  this  incident  during  his  May  2017
counterintelligence  (CI)  interview,  he  gave  a  completely  different  account  of  what
occurred at the academy, which led to his expulsion. That version lacks credibility. (Tr.
33-39, 50-51; GE 4-5; AE B)
Applicant completed and certified as accurate his SCA in April 2017. In Section
18,  which  requires  a  listing  of  relatives,  Applicant  failed  to  list  two  additional  brothers
and six additional sisters. Although not alleged in the SOR, he also failed to list his ex-
wife and two children (I will not consider this evidence for disqualification purposes, but
I  may  consider  it  to  weigh  Applicant’s  credibility,  determine  the  applicability  of
mitigating  conditions,  and  in  considering  the  whole-person  factors).  Applicant  testified
that his failure to list his omitted siblings was not intended to deceive the government. I
do  not  find  his  testimony  credible.  During  a  polygraph  interview  in  May  2017,  he
admitted  deliberately  withholding  this  information  in  order  to  increase  his  chances  for
employment. (Tr. 29, 31, 48; GE 1, 3; AE D)
Applicant  testified  that  his  father  died  in  February  2019.  He  admitted  that  the
remaining relatives listed in the SOR were in the locations and positions as alleged. His
brother employed by the United Nations is still in that position. Applicant’s last contact
with him was in February 2019. He has no further information about his brother who is
a colonel in the Djiboutian Army. His last contact with this brother was in 2008. His two
sisters remain working for the Djiboutian Ministry of Energy. His last contact with them
was  in  February  2019.  His  sister  who  was  a  former  Djiboutian  congresswoman  now
lives in France. His sister remains the CEO of a cable company. It is a French-owned
company.  He  cannot  recall  his  last  contact  with  this  sister.  His  brother-in-law  is  no
longer the Djiboutian Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates. He has had no recent
contact with him and does not know his current location. His brother-in-law remains the
counselor to the Djiboutian Ministry of Transportation. He was also the former CEO of
the Djibouti airport. Applicant has no regular contact with him. His last contact with the
brother-in-law  who  was  the  Djibouti  Secretary  of  Energy  was  in  2008.  (Tr.  39-45;

"Applicant is 26 years old and married. He was born in Afghanistan in 1991. In 1992,
his father, a commander in the Afghan military, was assassinated. Shortly thereafter, his
mother  fled  to  Pakistan  with  Applicant,  his  sister,  and  his  brother.  They  remained  in
Pakistan until 2001 when they immigrated the United States as refugees. They became
U.S. citizens in 2007 and continue to reside in the United States. (Item 4)
Applicant graduated from high school in 2009. He subsequently obtained student
loans  and  attended  a  U.S.  college  between  August  2010  and  May  2015.  He  did  not
complete a degree. While in college, he was unemployed for some months and financially
supported by his brother. (Items 4-6)
Applicant visited Afghanistan multiple times since becoming a U.S. citizen in 2007:
from  December  2013  to  January  2014;  June  2014  to  July  2014;  December  2014  to
January  2015;  March  2015;  July  2015;  August  2016;  June  2017; and  August  2017. In
December 2013, Applicant married his wife in Afghanistan. She is an Afghanistan citizen
and was residing there at the time. (Items 4 and 6) Applicant and his wife had a son born
in Afghanistan. In 2017, his wife moved to the United States with their young son and she
became a permanent U.S. resident. (Item 3)
Applicant’s  mother-in-law  and  father-in-law  are  citizens  and  residents  of
Afghanistan. His mother-in-law is a homemaker and his father-in-law is a taxi driver. His
father-in-law  is  also  Applicant’s  uncle.  Applicant  has  three  brothers-in-law.  Two  are
citizens and residents of Afghanistan. One brother-in-law is citizen of Afghanistan and a
permanent  U.S.  resident.  That  brother-in-law  previously  worked  for  the  Afghan  police.
Applicant has monthly contact with his in-laws residing in Afghanistan. Applicant stayed
with his in-laws when he visited Afghanistan. (Item 3, 4, 6)
Applicant  has  eight  friends  and  a  cousin,  who  are  citizens  and  residents  of
Afghanistan. He has yearly contact with six friends and quarterly contact with two friends.
He contacts his cousin yearly. (Item 5) Applicant said that since his wife has moved to the
United States, he no longer needs to maintain contact with multiple family members or
friends in Afghanistan. (Item 3)
Based  on  credit  bureau  reports  (CBR)  from  May  2017,  January  2018,  and  May
2018, the SOR alleged six debts that became delinquent between 2014 and 2018, and
totaled  over  $14,503.  They  included  an  automobile  repossession,  three  unpaid  credit
cards, an unpaid cell phone bill, and unpaid tuition. (Items 8, 9, 10)
In  his  Answer,  Applicant  stated  that  he  is  responsible  for  resolving  the  alleged
debts. He said that he is making payments on the $371 credit card debt. The most recent
CBR confirmed that the $371 debt listed in SOR ¶ 1.a had a balance of $143 as of April
2018.  (Item  10).  He  also  stated  that  he paid  the  $143  cell  phone debt, but  there  is  no
evidence to confirm that status. Applicant said he intended to pay the other four debts
when he has more money. (Item 3)
According  to  the  May  2018  CBR,  Applicant  has  student  loans  that  total  about
$53,350. SOR ¶ 1.f alleged that one of those loans has a delinquent balance of $2,607.
Applicant has not made arrangements to make payments on that loan. He makes nominal
payments of $1 to $3 on several other student loans. (Item 10)
Applicant  was  employed  full-time  from  October  2015  to  January  2016  with  a
temporary staffing firm. He then obtained a full-time position with a healthcare company.
He continues to work for that company while his application for a security clearance is
pending. (Item 6)
Applicant admitted that he provided $19,400 of financial support to his wife from
2013  until  2017,  before  she  moved  to  the  United  States.  Throughout  the  case  file,  he
stated that as a consequence of sending her money and traveling to Afghanistan, he did
not have sufficient money to pay the alleged delinquent debts. (Items 3-6)
Applicant  did  not  provide  a  current  budget  or  other  information  related  to  his
financial obligations from which to determine his current financial reliability, compliance
with  payment  agreements,  or  ability  to  maintain  payments  on  the  debts.  There  is  no
evidence that he has financial investments or other monetary connections in the United
States. Applicant asserts that his loyalty is to the United States. (Item 2)
Afghanistan
I  have  taken  administrative  notice  of  facts  contained  in  U.S.  Government
pronouncements  concerning  the  state  of  Afghanistan.  Specifically,  Afghanistan  faces
many challenges fueled by sectarian and ethnic divisions. Numerous terrorist groups are
increasingly active throughout Afghanistan. Threats of kidnapping and violence are high,
and the Department of State warns U.S. citizens that all travel to Afghanistan should be
avoided.  Of  particular  significance  are  the  poor  human  rights  situation;  the  active  and
hostile presence of Al Qaida, the Taliban, the Haqqani Network; and other insurgent and
extremist groups that generate instability and openly attack police, security and military
forces, the local populace, and U.S. persons and interests.

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.e,
with explanations. He denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 2.a. His admissions are
incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  35  years  old.  He  was  born  in  Iraq  in  1983.  He  lived  there  until  he
immigrated to the United States in 2008. He became a U.S. citizen in 2013. In 2006, he
received  his  bachelor’s  degree  from  an  Iraqi  university.  He  is  employed  in  the  private
sector,  but  is  pursuing  a  linguist  position  with  a  federal  contractor,  for  which  he  is
seeking a security clearance. He has never been married and has no children.3
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant’s  mother,  four  brothers  and  his  sister  are  all
residents  and  citizens  of  Afghanistan.  It  further  alleged  that  one  brother  works  for  the
Iraqi  National  Police.  The  SOR  also  alleged  that  Applicant  has  one  friend,  who  is  a
resident and citizen of Iraq, and who is also currently enlisted in the Iraqi Army; and a
second  friend,  a  resident  and  citizen  of  Iraq,  who  is  employed  by  the  Iraqi
Counterterrorism  unit.  The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  admitted  his  allegiance  to  the
United States and Iraq was divided to about 50 percent to each country.

Applicant was hired locally as a linguist from 2004 to 2008 for U.S. forces in Iraq.
He  provided  linguist  services  at  several  different  locations  and  for  several  different
missions.  In  approximately  2005,  he  began  working  at  a  police  academy  providing
linguistic  services  to  U.S.  forces  who  were  training  Iraqi  police  candidates.  He  later
transitioned  to  missions  that  had  him  working  “outside  the  wire”  providing  linguistic
services to U.S. forces at roadside checkpoints and providing liaison services between
U.S. forces and local leaders. His work was hazardous. He experienced frequent rocket
propelled  grenade  (RPG)  attacks  from  insurgent  forces.  In  approximately  2007,  he
began  providing  linguistic  services  at  an  Iraqi  detention  facility.  At  this  facility,  where
approximately  20,000  Arabic-speaking  detainees  were  held,  Applicant  translated
sensitive  written  and  oral  documents  for  U.S.  forces.  He  was  awarded  a  certificate  of
appreciation  from  a  U.S.  Army  Military  Police  Battalion  for  his  work  at  the  detention
facility.4
The current status of Applicant’s relatives listed in the SOR is as follows:
1. Applicant’s mother (M). M is 68 years old and in poor health. She immigrated
to  the  United  States  in  2015.  She  is  a  legal  resident  alien  in  this  country  (green  card
holder). She lives with Applicant who provides for her. She is currently visiting Iraq. She
returned  to  Iraq  in  May  2018  to  visit  her  husband’s  gravesite  (he  passed  away  in
January 2018). She intended to stay approximately 15 days. She experienced bleeding
while there and was diagnosed with cancer. Currently, she is undergoing chemotherapy
and unable to travel. She is staying in the house her husband owned presently occupied
by  her  sons  and  daughter.  She  intends  to  return  to  the  United  States  when  she  is
healthy enough to do so. She has no affiliations with the Iraqi government or military.5
2. Applicant’s four brothers and sister (B1-B4, S1). B1 immigrated to this country
in 2015 with his mother. He is a legal resident alien (green card holder). He lives with
Applicant and their mother. He works for a private sector employer. He took his mother
to  Iraq  in  May  2018,  but  returned  alone  after  15  days  when  she  experienced  medical
issues. B2 is a resident and citizen of Iraq. He works for the Iraqi National Police as a
corrections  officer.  Applicant  has  infrequent  contact  with  him,  possibly  on  a  quarterly
basis through social media. B3 is a resident and citizen of Iraq. He is unemployed. He
has  no  government  or  military  affiliation.  Applicant  has  contact  with  him  approximately
twice  a  year.  B4  is  a  resident  and  citizen  of  Iraq.  He  works  in  customer  service  for  a
telecommunication  company.  He  has  no  government  or  military  affiliations.  Applicant
has  quarterly  contact  with  him.  S1  is  a  resident  and  citizen  of  Iraq.  She  is  a  school
teacher. Applicant has quarterly contact with her. All of Applicant’s siblings were aware
of his linguist work for U.S. forces from 2004 to 2008. There were no repercussions as a

F1 was in 2016. Applicant knew that F1 was in the Iraqi Army at one time, but now he
has  no  idea  as  to  F1’s  status.  Applicant’s  last  contact  with  F2  was  in  April  2017.  He
knew  that  F2  was  working  for  an  Iraqi  counterterrorism  unit.  At present,  Applicant  has
no idea what F2 does for a living.7
Applicant  addressed  his  apparent  statement  to  a  defense  investigator  in  June
2017 during his background interview. The investigator noted in his report that Applicant
stated  that  his  allegiance  to  the  two  countries  was  50  percent  each.  In  March  2018,
when  given  a  chance  to  review  the  investigator’s  summarized  interview,  Applicant
explained that he meant that he still appreciated the culture, history, and the arts of Iraq,
however, he has no allegiance to the government of Iraq. His undivided allegiance is to
the United States as demonstrated by his willingness to put himself in harm’s way while
working with U.S. forces in Iraq. During his testimony, he reiterated his allegiance to the
United  States,  while  also  explaining  that  he  will  always  love  the  history  and  culture  of
Iraq. He documented that his Iraqi passport expired in 2016 and has not been renewed.
He has a current U.S. passport that was issued in 2017.8

four  military  commanders

Administrative Notice.
The  U.S.  State  Department  warns  U.S.  citizens  against  travel  to  Iraq  as  travel
within the country remains dangerous. The U.S. Embassy warns that U.S. citizens are at
high  risk  for  kidnapping  and  violence  and  to  avoid  all  but  essential  travel  to  Iraq.  The
U.S. government considers the potential threat to U.S. government personnel in Iraq to
be serious enough to require them to live and work under strict security guidelines. The

He has been employed as a senior engineer by a U.S. corporation since 2000 and he
has  recently  applied  for  another  position  with  a  federal  contractor,  which  approval  is
contingent  on  Applicant  obtaining  a  security  clearance.  (Tr.  60)  Applicant  provided
documents  listing  his  professional  accomplishments,  including  numerous  certificates
and awards, and 12 U.S. patents in his field of micro-electrical mechanical systems. He
also listed his academic accomplishments. (AE A, B, C)
Applicant testified that he or his wife, a naturalized U.S. citizen, owned three real
estate  parcels  in  Turkey  before  he  became  a  U.S.  citizen.  (Tr.  15,  47)  His  wife
purchased  an  apartment  in  Turkey  in  2006  before  they  were  married.  She  is  the  sole
owner. (AE H) He purchased a second property in Turkey in 2008. (Tr. 49) Applicant’s
wife  purchased  a  third  apartment  for  her  totally  disabled  mother  to  live  close  to  her
relatives  in  2012,  the  year  of  their  marriage.  (AE  D,  Tr.  50)  The  three  real-estate
holdings alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d have lost 50–60% in value compared to when they were
purchased, due to the tumultuous conditions in Turkey. (Tr. 15-16) Applicant provided a
graph that visually depicts the details of their purchases of real estate in Turkey. (AE D)
Applicant  testified  credibly  that  the  exchange  rate  for  Turkish  currency  (lira)  was
relatively flat for a long time, but then it lost half of its value on world markets in a five-
year span from 2012 to 2017. (Tr. 48)
Applicant  testified  that  the  property,  which  he  purchased  in  Turkey  in  2008,
actually  was  not  completely  built  until  2013,  due  to  chaos  in  that  country.  (Tr.  74)
Therefore, it could not be sold previously. Applicant’s wife became a U.S. citizen in June
2017. She was a market researcher in Turkey previously and she had no affiliation with
the Turkish government. Her mother also has a green card as a permanent resident in
the U.S. since 2017. (Tr. 76) Applicant testified credibly that it was extremely difficult to
sell the real estate in Turkey due to instability, its loss in value, and a saturated market
from  overdevelopment  around  Istanbul.  (Tr.  50-51,  AE  D)  He  provided  supplemental
post-hearing documents including a deed showing that the real estate he purchased in
2008  has  now  been  donated  or  conveyed  to  his  sister  under  Turkish  law.  Applicant’s
wife provided a power of attorney (POA) dated January 28, 2019, to effectuate the sale
of  property  purchased  for  his  mother-in-law.  (AE  H)  Applicant’s  former  Turkish  real
estate interests had a total value of $337,000. (Tr. 58)
Applicant has telephonic contact with his parents once or twice a week. (Tr. 63)
Applicant contacts his sister living in Turkey only in crisis. (Tr. 66) He had a falling out
with  his  sister  because  she  is  angry  that  Applicant  lives  so  far  away,  and  the  care  of
their  infirm  parents  falls  to  her.  (Tr.  67-69)  Applicant’s  80-year-old  father  had  brain
surgery in 2016 and he has not recovered well. (Tr. 30) Applicant testified that the last
crisis was when his father fell down and lacerated his scalp and Applicant flew to Turkey
in  September  2018  to  assist.  (Tr.  69)  His  father  is  prone  to  falling  and  often  injures
himself. Applicant has visited Turkey about once a year for the last ten years. (Tr. 69-

naturalized  as  a  U.S.  citizen  in  2010.  He  is  married  and  has  one  child.  Applicant  has
been employed by a government contractor since October 2014. (Item 3.)
Applicant’s  wife  is  a  citizen  and  resident  in  Sudan.  She  has  never  been  to  the
United States. She works as a teacher in Sudan, for the Ministry of Education. Applicant
has applied for her to immigrate to the United States. Applicant and his wife have a five-
year-old child, who resides in Sudan with Applicant’s wife. Applicant communicates with
his wife and child on a weekly basis. He sends them $200 in support monthly. (Answer;

Applicant’s parents are citizens and residents in Sudan. His father is 84 years old
and his mother is 64 years old. They are cared for by Applicant’s younger brother, who
is also a citizen and resident of Sudan. In addition to caring for their parents, Applicant’s
younger brother is a student. (Answer; Item 3.)
Applicant’s four sisters are citizens and residents in Sudan. They are married and

Sudan
Sudan  is  governed  by  an  authoritarian  President.  The  National  Congress  Party
has  held  near-absolute  power  in  Sudan  for  almost  30  years.  Since  1993,  Sudan  has
been designated by the U.S. Department of State as a state sponsor of terrorism, due to
concerns about Sudanese support to international terrorist organizations including Abu
Nidal  Organization,  Palestine  Islamic  Jihad,  Hamas,  and  Hezbollah.  The  U.S.
Department of State warns U.S. citizens not to travel to Sudan due to risks of terrorism,
armed  conflict,  and  violent  crime.  Westerners  and  Western  interests  are  targeted
through  suicide  operations,  bombings,  shootings,  and  kidnappings.  Violent  crimes
targeting  Westerners  including  kidnappings,  armed  robberies,  home  invasions,  and
carjacking  occur  throughout  Sudan.  Arbitrary  detentions  of  foreigners  have  been
reported.
In 2003, non-Arabs in the Darfur region of Sudan rebelled against the Sudanese
government,  protesting  decades  of  political  and  economic  neglect.  The  government
responded  with  brutal force, and more  than 300,000  people  were killed  in the  ensuing
conflict. More than two million people have been displaced as a result of that conflict.
",False
"Applicant  admitted  all  the  allegations  in  SOR,  except  for  SOR  allegation  ¶  1.a.
After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the
following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  35-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  (GX  1  at  pages  5
and 16.) He has been employed as a linguist with the defense contractor since January
of  2017.  (GX  1  at  page  16.)  In  August  of  2017,  while  on  patrol  with  U.S.  Marines,
Applicant was wounded by a suicide bomber. (TR at page 38 line 14 to page 40 line 25,
at page 82 lines 6~25, and AppX C1.) He has submitted eight letters of support (AppXs
A,  E  and  J),  to  include  one  from  a  Brigadier  General  (AppX  E5),  and  numerous
Certificates of Appreciation (AppX H1~9).
Guideline B - Foreign Influence
1.a. Applicant denied that his mother is a citizen and resident of Afghanistan, as
she  is  now  deceased.  (TR  at  page  43  lines  16~18,  and  at  page  44  lines  2~6.)  This
occurred in January of 2018, and Applicant could not attend her funeral as he could not
leave the protection of his military post. (Id.)
1.b.  Applicant  admits  that  three  brothers  are  citizens  and  residents  of
Afghanistan. (TR at page 50 line 10 to page 52 line 3, and at page 53 line 14 to page 55
line 6.) Two of these brothers are merchants, and the third a teacher. (Id.) To the best of
his  knowledge  and  belief  none  of  these  brothers  are  connected  to  the  Afghan
government.
1.c.  Applicant  admits  that  a  fourth  brother,  also  a  citizen  and  resident  of
Afghanistan, was a “Clerk” for the Afghan government. (TR at page 52 line 4 to page 53
line 12.) He is currently unemployed, but most recently worked for a U.S. company. (TR
at page 55 lines 7~21, and at page 69 lines 7~23.)
1.d. Applicant admits that between 2010~2016, he gave a total of about $5,000
to a brother, in support of his, now deceased, mother. Applicant disclosed this financial
to
the  U.S.  Government,
in  January  of  2011,  as  evidenced  by  his
support
Counterintelligence-Focused  Security  Screening  Questionnaire  (CFSSQ).  (TR  at  page
42 line 7 to page 43 line 18, at page 55 line 22 to page 56 line 11, and GX  at page 7.)
Guideline E - Personal Conduct
2.a. Applicant answered “No” on his February 2017 e-QIP to the question: “Have
you EVER provided financial support for any foreign national?” (GX 1 at page 51.) He
mistakenly thought this question did not apply to his immediate family. (TR at page 56
line  12  to  page  60  line  6,  and  at  page  71  line  1  to  page  74  line  24.)  Applicant  had
already  disclosed  his  mother’s  financial  support,  through  his  brother,  in  his  January
2011 CFSSQ. He reaffirmed his 2011 admission, just 12 days after he executed his e-
QIP, when he again executed a February 2017 CFSSQ. (GX 4 at pages 1 and 2.) I find
no willful falsification, here.
2.b.  Applicant  admits  that  he  resided  in  the  United  States  illegally  from  about
2006~2010. In about 2003, as an 18 year old,  he started working as an interpreter for
U.S. Forces in Afghanistan. (TR at page 22 lines 5~13, and at page 28 line 21 to page
31 line 12.) In 2006, while Applicant was training in the United States, he discovered he
was on a “hit list” if and when he returned to Afghanistan. (Id, and 60 line 7 to page 61
line 9, and at page 68 line 11 to page 69 line 2.)  As a result, he went to live with a half-
brother in California from 2006~2010. (Id.) Applicant disclosed his illegal status when he
applied for and was granted a Green Card. (TR at page 34 line 17 to page 36 line 11,
and at page 37 line 1 to page 38 line 13.) He was again deployed back to Afghanistan in
support  of  U.S.  forces,  and  while  there  applied  for  and  was  granted  U.S.  citizenship.
(Id.)
Notice
I  take  administrative  notice  of  the  following  regarding  Afghanistan.  A  U.S.
Department of State Travel Advisory remains in effect for Afghanistan. Extremist groups
and kidnapping syndicates are actively targeting foreign nationals. Decades of disorder
and warfare have made Afghanistan fertile territory for international terroism.
",True
"Applicant  is  a  32-year-old  linguist  employed  by  a  Department  of  Defense
contractor  since  2017.    He  is  currently  working  at  an overseas  location  supporting  the
U.S. military. He was granted a security clearance in 2016 and  is applying to maintain
his security clearance. Applicant was born, raised, and educated in Iraq. He received an
associate’s  degree  from  a  technical  college  in  Iraq.  He  worked  as  a  contract  linguist/
translator/cultural advisor with the U.S. military in Iraq from 2007 to 2008 and in 2011. In
2009,  a  local  terrorist  group  threatened  Applicant.  He  applied  for  and  was  granted  a
special  immigrant  visa  (SIV).  He  immigrated  to  the  United  States  in  October  2011.  He
became U.S. citizen in 2016. He is married, but is separated from his wife and has no
children. (Tr. 22-26, 51; Gov 1; AE C; AE G; AE H; Response to SOR) (Note: The facts
in  this  decision  do  not  specifically  describe  employment,  names  of  witnesses,  or
locations in order to protect Applicant and his family’s privacy. The cited sources contain
more specific information.)
When Applicant first immigrated to the United States, he worked several jobs and
endured  several  periods  of  unemployment.  During  his  periods  of  unemployment,  he
lived off savings and received some help from his parents. His two brothers immigrated
to the U.S. in 2013.  Applicant lived with his two brothers for about a year. They had a
falling  out  in  May  2014,  and  Applicant has had no  contact  with  his  brothers since  that
time.  Applicant  had  a  brief  marriage  in  2014,  which  was  annulled.  (Tr.  47-57;  Gov  1;
Response to SOR)
In March 2015, Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Army as an active-duty translator.
He  learned  how  to  operate  in  a  dangerous  environment.  He  was  trusted  to  interpret
conversations,  documents,  and  other  forms  of  communications  to  assist  the  U.S.
military. He trained Iraqi armed forces, he worked with high profile individuals, and was
involved  in  tactical  missions,  some  of  which  resulted  in  attacks  in  some  of  the  most
dangerous  locations  in  Iraq.  In  June  2017,  he  was  discharged  from  the  U.S.  Army  for
medical  reasons  with  a  discharge  characterized  as  Honorable.  After  being  discharged
from the U.S. Army, he was hired as a contract linguist in 2017. (Tr. 23; Gov 1; AE B;
AE F; Response to SOR)
Foreign Influence
The  SOR  raises  security  concerns  because Applicant  has family  members who
are citizens of Iraq and several who reside in Iraq. Specifically:
SOR ¶ 1.a:  Applicant’s spouse is a dual citizen of Iraq and Canada and resides
in  Canada.   Applicant admits  that  his wife  is  a  dual citizen  of Iraq  and  Canada.  They
married  in  April  2016.    Applicant’s  spouse  did  not  like  that  Applicant  was  always
deployed  and  never  home.  They  are  informally  separated.  Applicant  does  not  know
where  his  spouse  currently  resides.  His  last  contact  with  her  was  around  November
2017.  Once  he  locates  where  she  is,  he  intends  to  file  for  divorce  because  they  both
want different things out of life. (Tr. 26-27, 57-62; Gov 1 at 33-34; Response to SOR)
SOR ¶ 1.b:  Applicant’s mother is a citizen and resident of Iraq. She is retired and
was  formerly  employed  by  an  Iraqi  government  agency  in  a  senior  administrative
position.  Applicant’s  mother  receives  a  government  pension.  He  loves  his  mother  and
contacts  her  weekly  or  biweekly  depending  upon  his  schedule.  (Tr.  28-30,  63,  72-73;
Response to SOR)
SOR ¶ 1.c: Applicant’s father is a citizen and resident of Iraq.  He retired from the
Iraqi  Army  as  a  senior  enlisted  person.  He  receives  a  government  pension.  Applicant
contacts him about once or twice a month. (Tr. 32, 63-64, 81-82; Response to SOR)
SOR ¶ 1.d:  Applicant’s brother is a citizen and resident of Iraq. He is employed
as an engineer with an Iraqi government agency. Applicant contacts his brother about 3-
4 times a year. (Tr. 33-35, 70; Response to SOR)
SOR  ¶  1.d:    Applicant’s  two  sisters  are  citizens  of  and  reside  in  Iraq.  One  is  a
dentist  who  works  for  an  Iraqi  government  agency.  The  other  sister  is  a  computer
engineer for an Iraqi government agency. Applicant talks to his sisters about 3-4 times a
year. (Tr. 35-36, 71-72; Response to SOR)
The  last  time Applicant  visited  with  his family  members who  are  citizens  of and
reside in Iraq was in December 2018. His mother was in the hospital. They believed she
was  on  her  death  bed.  Applicant  stayed  for  three  or  four  days.  His  mother  recovered
from her illness. Prior to that time, he had not visited with his mother in person for seven
years. All of Applicant’s family members in Iraq hope to immigrate to the United States.
They have applied for refugee status and are awaiting their second interview with  U.S.
Customs and Immigration. (Tr. 30, 74; Response to SOR)
Applicant  provided  information  about  his  family  members  each  time  he
completed a counter-intelligence update when he was employed with DOD contractors
while he was a citizen of Iraq, and while on active duty in the U.S. Army. (Gov 3; Gov 4;
Response to SOR)
Financial Considerations
Under the Financial Considerations concern, it is alleged that Applicant owes an
auto dealership approximately $30,121 related to a voluntary automobile repossession.
Applicant purchased a car in State A (where he was undergoing military training) before
being assigned to another duty station in State B.  After Applicant moved to State B, the
automobile  dealer  attempted  to  modify  the  terms  of  the  purchase  contract  on  two
occasions.  Each  time,  the  dealer  increased  the  cost  of  the  purchase  price.  Applicant
consulted a legal assistance attorney, who advised him the automobile dealer breached
the contract. Applicant hired a civilian attorney who concurred and advised Applicant to
ship the car back to the dealer.  Applicant had only had the car for a few weeks and he
paid to have the car shipped back to the dealer in State A. His private attorney wrote a
letter to the dealer outlining the situation and alleging fraud on their part.  The debt is no
longer on Applicant’s credit report.  Applicant has no other delinquent debts and has an
excellent  credit  rating.  (SOR  ¶  2.a:  Tr.  36-39;  75-76;  Gov  5  at  6;  AE  A;  AE  K;  AE  L;
Response to SOR)
Personal Conduct
Under  Personal  Conduct,  it  is  alleged  that  Applicant  received  nonjudicial
punishment around February 2017, for violations of Articles 91 and 134 of the Uniform
Code  of  Military  Justice.  Applicant  was  deployed  to  Turkey  at  the  time  he  received
nonjudicial punishment. He had filed a formal complaint against several members of his
squadron  on  January  8,  2017  and  February  2017,  because  he  felt  he  was  being
harassed and that his unit was a hostile work environment. (AE P) On 18 January 2017,
Applicant  was  placed  on  a  medical  profile  for  injuries  to  his  left  shoulder.  The  profile
included  no  running, no  pushups,  and  no  sit-ups for 90 days. The profile  also  ordered
Applicant  not  lift  his  left  arm  and  to  engage  in  minimal  movement  with  his  left  arm.
Applicant  complained  to  the  medical  staff  that  he  was  being  harassed  by  members of
his unit.  (Tr. 39-42; 76-78; AE P; AE Q; Response to SOR)
Applicant testified he received nonjudicial punishment because he failed to follow
orders to stand at parade rest.  He could not do so because of his shoulder. Applicant
claims  his  fellow  soldiers  set  him  up  in  order  to  diminish  his  credibility.  Applicant
provided a copy of the complaints he made about the conduct of several members in his
unit and a copy of his medical profile. He did not have a copy of the Article 15 and the
Article  15  was  not  in  the  case  file.  He  disclosed  the  Article  15  on  his  most  recent
security  clearance  application  in  July  2017.  This  is  the  only  time  Applicant  has  been
punished under Article 15. Applicant believed the Article 15 was unfair. Discouraged by
the treatment he received, Applicant opted to be medically discharged. He received an
honorable discharge. (Tr. 39-42, 76-78; Gov 1 at 30-31; AE O; AE P; AE Q; Response
to SOR)
Applicant applied to become a contract linguist after his discharge from the U.S.
Army. He has had no issues in his current position. (Tr. 44)
Whole-person Factors
Applicant’s  was  counseled  on  his  duty  performance  in  June  2016  and  in  June
2017.  Both  were  favorable.  In  his  2016  counseling  he  was  praised  for  helping  other
teammates  while  on  temporary  duty  in  Jordan.  His  supervisor  wrote  “You  are  a  good
soldier in my squad when it comes to any task you are willing to take it.” In June 2017,
Applicant was told he was a valuable member of the team during an annual exercise in
Jordan. Specifically:
As a member of the exercise, you have shown great attitude towards work
and have delivered all your assignments on time. I am encouraging you to
keep  the  same  professional  manner.  You  also  showed  respect  towards
your superiors and  subordinates from  both, the  U.S. and  Jordanian  side.
You  have  performed  your  responsibilities  in  a  professional  manner  and
have showed the best of you. (AE N)
Staff Sergeant R. worked with Applicant from late 2018 to early 2019, in Jordan.
Applicant  was  a  civilian  contract  linguist.  Sergeant  R.  states  that  Applicant  is  a
phenomenal  linguist  and  has  been  asset  to  his  organization.  His  prior  military
experience  was  helpful.  Applicant’s  skill at  interpretation  quickly  made him  a preferred
linguist  to  facilitate  training  and  professional  relations  between  U.S.  and  Jordanian
armed  forces  instructors.  He  describes  Applicant  as  “intelligent,  loyal  and  excellent  at
his profession.” (AE D at 1)
Captain  M.  personally  attests
fortitude,  and
professionalism.  Applicant  has  exceptional  qualities  as  a  leader  and  interpreter.    He
states:
to  Applicant’s
intelligence,
[Applicant] possesses a breadth and depth of doctrinal knowledge seldom
seen  in  most  interpreters.  [Applicant]  has  the  natural  ability  to  express
complicated and technical information clearly and concisely. His patience
and  compassion  will  serve  him  well  as  a  linguist  and  interpreter  and
guarantee  him  continued  success  as  a  leader.  Applicant  has  continually
adapted  to  any  situation,  overcoming  differences  and  often  mending
international  disagreements  and  preventing  them  from  escalating.  (AE  D

Applicant has received several certificates of appreciation related to his duties as
a linguist in deployed locations. (AE E) He provided several photographs which reflect
his service as a linguist in support of the U.S. military. (AE E)

"The SOR alleges that Applicant’s spouse, parents-in-law, and brother-in-law are
citizens and residents of Iraq. Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations with some
clarifications. (HE 3) He also provided mitigating information. (HE 3) His admissions are
incorporated  herein  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  complete  and  thorough  review  of  the
evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 28 years old, and he is sponsored by a DOD contractor to become a
linguist for employment in Iraq or Kuwait. (Tr. 6, 30-32) In 2011, he graduated from high
school  in  the  United  States.  (Tr.  6)  He  has  two  years  of  college.  (Tr.  6)  He  has  not
served in the military of any foreign country. (Tr. 7)
In June 2016, Applicant married, and in September 2018, his spouse immigrated
to  the  United  States.  (Tr.  7,  26-27)  She  is  a  permanent  resident  of  the  United  States.
(Tr.  8,  47)  She  has  a  degree  from  a  university  in  Iraq  in  civil  engineering.  (Tr.  28)  He

Iraq
The U.S. Mission in Iraq remains dedicated to building a strategic partnership with
Iraq and the Iraqi people. The December 2011 departure of most U.S. troops from Iraq
marked  a  milestone  in  our  relationship  as  Iraq  continues  to  develop  as  a  sovereign,
stable,  and  self-reliant  country.  Iraq  is  now  a  key  partner  for  the  United  States  in  the
region  as  well  as  a  voice  of  moderation  and  democracy  in  the  Middle  East.  Iraq  has
functioning  government  institutions  including  an  active  legislature,  is  playing  an
increasingly  constructive  role  in  the  region,  and  has  a  bright  economic  future  as  oil
revenues  surpass  pre-Saddam  production  levels  with  continued  growth  to  come.  The
United  States  maintains  vigorous  and  broad  engagement  with  Iraq  on  diplomatic,
political,  economic,  and  security  issues  in  accordance  with  the  U.S.-Iraq  Strategic
Framework Agreement (SFA).
The  U.S.-Iraq  SFA  provides  the  basis  for  the  U.S.-Iraq  bilateral  relationship.  It
covers  the  range  of  bilateral  issues  including  political  relations  and  diplomacy,  defense
and  security,  trade  and  finance,  energy,  judicial  and  law  enforcement  issues,  services,
science, culture, education, and environment. Efforts to implement the SFA are overseen
by several committees, which meet periodically.
The  U.S.  State  Department  warns  that  U.S.  citizens  in  Iraq  are  at  high  risk  for
violence  and  kidnapping,  and  advises  U.S.  citizens  not  to  travel  to  Iraq.  The  current
travel advisory level is Level 4: Do not travel.
The  ability  of  the  U.S.  Embassy  to  provide  consular  services  to  U.S.  citizens
outside  Baghdad  is  limited  given  the  security  environment.  Anti-U.S.  sectarian  militias
may  threaten  U.S.  citizens  and  western  companies  throughout  Iraq.  Kidnappings  and
attacks  by  IEDs  occur  in  many  areas  of  the  country,  including  Baghdad.  Methods  of
attack  have  included  explosively  formed  penetrators  (EFPs),  magnetic  IEDs  placed  on
vehicles,  human  and  vehicle-borne  IEDs,  mines  placed  on  or  concealed  near  roads,
mortars and rockets, and shootings using various direct fire weapons. Such attacks may
take place in public venues such as cafes and markets.
4  The  language  of  the  current  Oath  of  Allegiance  is  found  in  the  Code  of  Federal  Regulations
Section 337.1 and is closely based upon the statutory elements in Section 337(a) of the Immigration and
Nationality  Act.  U.S.  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Services,  8  U.S.C.  §  1448,  https://www.uscis.gov/us-

Iraq  continues  to  be  subjected  to  terrorist  activity.  ISIL’s  capacity  and  territorial
control in Iraq has dramatically eroded in the past two years. According to estimates from
the UN Assistance Mission for Iraq, acts of terrorism and violence killed more than 7,000
civilians and injured more than 12,000 in 2016. By the end of 2017, Iraqi Security Forces
had  liberated  all  territory  from  ISIL,  drastically  reducing  ISIL’s  ability  to  commit  abuses
and  atrocities.  Human  rights  violations  continue  to  be  a  problem  with  allegations  of
unlawful  killings  and  other  abuses  being  made  against  the  Iraqi  Security  Forces  and
Popular Mobilization Forces. Iran continues to seek influence and oppose the U.S. goals
in Iraq.
Human rights problems continue to occur, including sectarian hostility, corruption,
and  lack  of  transparency  at  all  levels  of  government  and  society.  These  problems
weakened the government's authority and worsened effective human rights protections.
Iraqi  Security  Forces,  members  of  the  Federal  Police,  and  the  Peshmerga  committed
some human rights violations, and there continued to be reports of Popular Mobilization
Forces killing, torturing, kidnapping, and extorting civilians.
Observers  also  reported  other  significant  human  rights-related  problems:  harsh
and  life-threatening  conditions  in  detention  and  prison  facilities;  arbitrary  arrest  and
lengthy  pretrial  detention,  denial  of  fair  public  trial;  insufficient  judicial  institutional
capacity;  ineffective  implementation  of  civil  judicial  procedures  and  remedies;  arbitrary
interference  with  privacy  and  homes;  limits  on  freedom  of  expression,  including  press
freedoms;  violence  against  and  harassment  of  journalists;  undue  censorship;  social,
religious, and political restrictions in academic and cultural matters; limits on freedoms of
peaceful  assembly  and  association;  limits  on  religious  freedom  due  to  violence  by
extremist  groups;  restrictions  on  freedom  of  movement  including  on  refugees  and
internally  displaced  persons;  discrimination  against  and  societal  abuse  of  women  and
ethnic,  religious,  and  racial  minorities,  including  exclusion  from  decision-making  roles;
trafficking in persons; societal discrimination and violence against lesbian, gay, bisexual,
transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) persons; seizure of property without due process; and
limitations on worker rights.
The  United  States’  extraordinary  commitment  to  Iraq  is  balanced  against  the
inherent dangers of the ongoing conflict in Iraq to its citizens and residents and the Iraqi
government’s  problems  developing  and  complying  with  the  rule  of  law.  A  top  national
security goal of the United States is to establish relationships, cooperation, training, and
support of the Iraqi Government and military in the ongoing war against terrorism.

"After  a  thorough  review  of  the  record,  I  make  the  following  findings  of  fact.
Applicant  was  born  in South Korea  in  March  1959  and  is  59  years  old. She  married a

clearance  since  entering  active  duty,  and  her  eligibility  for  access  to  classified
information  has  never  been  challenged  in  the  37  years  she  has  held  a  security
clearance. (Tr. 19-29, 40-42; GX 1, e-QIP, dated March 2, 2016)
The  SOR  alleges  and  Applicant  admits  that  her  brother  (SOR  1.a),  two  half-
brothers  (SOR  1.b),  a  sister  (SOR  1.c),  and  a  half-sister  (SOR  1.d)  are  citizens  and
residents of South Korea. She also admits that she has two nephews who are a citizens
and  residents  of  South  Korea,  one  currently  serving  in  the  South  Korean  Air  Force
(SOR  1.e),  and  the  other  currently  serving  in  the  South  Korean  Army  Reserve  (SOR
1.f).
Applicant has spent half of her lifetime living and working on U.S. military bases.
Even though Applicant is now stationed in South Korea, she remains close to the U.S.
military  and  her  life  is  centered  on  the  U.S.  military  base.  She  participates  in  on-base
programs, such as the library, banking, special holiday programs, and chapel services.
While stationed in South Korea, she has returned each year to the United States to visit
family and friends, and to sightsee. She plans to retire in the United States. She and her
sister have purchased a house in the United States that they are remodeling to use in
retirement. She has a 401(k) retirement plan and a thrift savings plan, as well as stocks
and  bonds  invested  with  U.S.  based  companies.  She  will  receive  a  pension  from  the
U.S.  military  for  both  military  and  civilian  service,  she  is  receiving  disability  from  the
Department  of  Veterans  Affairs  (VA),  and  she  is  eligible  for  Social  Security.  All  of  her
funds and bank accounts are in U.S. banks or credit unions. She does not receive any
benefits from South Korea. She is current with all of her U.S. taxes. Her ultimate plan is
to be buried at Arlington National Cemetery. She considers the United States to be her
home. (Tr. 22-32)
Applicant’s  brother  (SOR  1.a)  is  62  years  old,  a  citizen  and  resident  of  South
Korea, and employed as an airport bus driver. He is married. Since he lives about two
hours from Applicant, she does not visit him often. She does not provide him financial
support.  He has  never  asked  her  about  her military  work,  or  asked  her  to provide him
with military information. (Tr. 32-33)
Applicant’s  two  half-brothers  (SOR  1.b)  are  citizens  and  residents  of  South
Korea,  in  their  late  70s  to  early  80s,  and  retired.  She  sees  them  rarely,  and  last  saw
them a few years ago when her mother was in the hospital and they came to visit. When
Applicant retired from the military and left Korea in 2015, they brought their families to
her farewell party. (Tr. 33-34)
Applicant’s sister (SOR 1.c) is a citizen and resident of South Korea, in her mid-
60s,  and  a  caregiver  for  the  elderly.  She  lives  about  two  and  a  half  hours  away  from
Applicant,  so  Applicant  does  not  see  her  often.  Their  contact  is  mainly  by  phone.  Her
sister  has  been  to  the  United  States  because  her  son  is  on  active  duty  in  the  United
States Army. Her nephew brought her sister and her brother-in-law to the United States
to  live.  Even  though  they  had  permanent  resident  status  in  the  United  States,  they
returned to South Korea because of illness and language problems. (Tr. 34-36)
Applicant’s half-sister (SOR 1.d) is a citizen and resident of South Korea, and in
her  70s.  She  lives  in  the  countryside,  so  Applicant  communicates  with  her  only
occasionally  by  phone.  Applicant’s  half-sister  has  no  affiliation  with  the  South  Korean
government. (Tr. 36)
Applicant’s nephew is a citizen and resident of South Korea, in his late 30s, and
on active duty in the Korean Air Force (SOR 1.e). Applicant saw him once or twice when
he  was  a  child.  Since  she  returned  to  Korea,  she  has  only  seen  him  at  her  sister’s
house a few times when he came to celebrate Korean holidays. (Tr.36-37)
Applicant’s other nephew (SOR 1.d) is a citizen and resident of South Korea, and
in his late 30s. He served his mandatory military duty in the South Korean Army but still
remains a member of the Korean Army Reserve. His civilian occupation is as an English
teacher in a language institute. (Tr. 37-38)
Applicant  has  immediate  family  members  who  are  citizens  and  residents  of  the
United  States.  She  stays  with  one  sister  when  she  visits  the  United  States.  Applicant
also has a sister who is married to an U.S. Air Force retiree, and two nephews who are
on active duty in the United States Army. (Tr. 38-40)
I  have  taken  administrative  notice  of  facts  concerning  South  Korean  that  are
common  knowledge  and  not  subject  to  dispute.  South  Korea  is  a  stable,  democratic
republic.  The  United  States  and  South  Korea  have  been  close  allies  since  1950,  and
have fought  communism  on  the  Korean  peninsula and  in  Vietnam. The  United  States,
since  1950  and  currently,  has  thousands  of  U.S.  military  personnel  stationed  in  South
Korea, and frequently conducts joint military operation with and in South Korea. About
2.3 million Koreans live in the United States. The United States has promised over the
next  few  years  to  provide  about  $11  billion  in  force  enhancements  to  Korea.  South
Korea  is  the  United  States’  seventh  largest  trading  partner.  The  recently  signed  free
trade  agreement  between  the  United  States  and  South  Korea  will  generate  billions  of
dollars in additional economic growth and job creation in both countries.
The  South  Korean  government  generally  respects  the  human  rights  of  its
citizens.  South  Korea.  South  Korea  does  not  recognize  dual  citizenship.  There  have
been  circumstances  were  U.S.  citizens  with  connections  to  South  Korea  were  drafted
into the South Korean Army.
In  recent  years,  the  United  States  and  South  Korea  have  differed  in  their
diplomatic  approaches  towards  North  Korea.  The  United  States  position  is  more
assertive  and  it  attempts  to  curtail  North  Korea’s  development  of  advanced  military
technology, such as ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons. There has been progress in
this area, and North Korea has curtailed its missile tests. The North Korean dictator and
the President of the United States have met to discuss diplomatic solutions and plan to
meet again. South Korea has emphasized steps towards unification of North and South
Korea.  Limited  visits  of  relatives  across  the  demilitarized  zone  have  recently  been
permitted by both North and South Korea.
Industrial  espionage  includes  seeking  commercial  secrets.  South  Korea  has  a
history of collecting protected U.S. information. In 2000, South Korea was listed as one
of the seven most active countries engaged in foreign economic collection and industrial
espionage against the United States. In 1997, a U.S. defense contractor was fined for
unlicensed  exports  to  South  Korea.  The  same  year,  a  civilian  employee  of  the  U.S.
Navy  passed  classified  documents  to  the  South  Korean  naval  attaché  to  the  United
States.  On  multiple  occasions,  South  Korea  has  been  the  unauthorized  recipient  of
sensitive  technology,  in  violation  of  U.S.  export  control  laws.    (GX  3,  Request  for

"The SOR alleges that Applicant’s sister is a citizen of Somalia residing in Kenya,
and his half brother is a citizen and resident of Somalia who is employed by the police.
Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations  with  some  clarifications.  (HE  3)  He  also
provided  mitigating  information.  (HE  3)  His  admissions  are  incorporated  herein  as
findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  55-year-old  former  linguist  who  wishes  to  return  to  linguist  duties
overseas.  (GE  1)  Pending  approval  of  his  security  clearance,  he  is  working  as  an
ultrasound technician. (Tr. 39)
In  1991,  Applicant  left  Somalia,  due  to  a  civil  war,  and  he  has  not  returned  to
Somalia  for  personal  reasons  since  then.  (Tr.  22,  40,  44)  From  Somalia,  he  went  to
Kenya, and then he lived in Europe for six years. (Tr. 22) He attended medical school in
Europe for four  years.  (Tr.  23)  He  received  a  lottery  visa  to  the  United States, and  he
immigrated to the United States in 1998. (Tr. 23-24) In 2007, Applicant became a U.S.
citizen. (Tr. 27)
Applicant  attended  two  U.S.  universities  where  he  studied  public  health  for  two
years and to be an ultrasound technician. (Tr. 24-25; AE A; AE B) In 2012, he received
an associate’s degree. (AE B) Applicant owns a home in the United States. (Tr. 28)
From February 2016 to March 2018, Applicant worked as a linguist at a location
outside  of  the  United  States.  (Tr.  29,  40)  He  risked  his  life  serving  along  with  U.S.
Forces in an area of hostilities. (Tr. 30, 37) He was not permitted to disclose details of
his service because it was classified. (Tr. 31)
In  2002,  Applicant  married,  and  he  has  five  children.  (Tr.  25)  His  children  are
ages  2,  6,  11,  13,  and  15.  (Tr.  25-26)  His  children  are  citizens  and  residents  of  the
United  States.  (Tr. 26-27)  Applicant met his spouse  in  the  United States.  (Tr. 27)  She
was born in Somalia and became a U.S. citizen in 2008. (Tr. 27)
Applicant said he believed that he renounced his Somali citizenship; however, he
did not provide details about how or when he renounced his Somali citizenship. (Tr. 39,
50) He took the Naturalization Oath of Allegiance to the United States of America, which
states:
I  hereby  declare,  on  oath,  that  I  absolutely  and  entirely  renounce  and
abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or

Applicant’s half brother is about 66 years old, and he was a Somali police officer.
(Tr.  31,  46;  SOR  response)  His  half  brother  supervised  other  police  officers;  however,
Applicant  was  unsure  whether  his  focus  was  on  street-level  crime  or  other  crime.  (Tr.
48-49)  Applicant  has  not  met  with  his  half  brother  since  2002.  (Tr.  31)  Applicant
believes his half brother is retired because of his age; however, Applicant has not asked
his half brother about whether he is retired. (Tr. 40-42, 45) Applicant communicates with
his half brother every few months. (Tr. 31; SOR response) Most likely in the future, he
will communicate with his half brother less frequently. (Tr. 33)
Applicant’s sister lives in a refugee camp in Kenya. (Tr. 32; SOR response) She
is  51  years  old.  (Tr.  32;  SOR  response)  He  has  not  seen  her  since  1991,  and  he
communicates  with  her  “perhaps  once  a  year  by  telephone.”  (Tr.  32;  SOR  response)3
For about three years, he has sent about $200 twice a year to his half brother, who then
provided  the funds  to his  sister.  (Tr.  42-43, 47-48)  In  the future, he  does  not  intend  to
communicate with his sister. (Tr. 33) Applicant’s half brother maintains contact with his
sister, and Applicant learns about her situation from him. (Tr. 48)
Applicant  said  if  his  relatives  in  Somalia  or  Kenya  contacted  him  and  asked  for
classified or sensitive information, he would report the contact to his security officer or to
the Federal Bureau of Investigation. (Tr. 34-36)
Somalia
In  2012,  Somalia  was  established  as  a  federal  parliamentary  republic.4  The
United  States  recognized  the  Federal  Government  of  Somalia  in  January  2013.  U.S.
foreign  policy  objectives  in  Somalia  are  to  promote  economic  and  political  stability,
promote  democratic  reforms,  oppose  international  terrorism,  and  alleviate  humanitarian

3 Later in his hearing, Applicant said he had not spoken to, contacted, or emailed his sister since
1991. (Tr. 43) He clarified that he did not remember any conversations with her, and he could not confirm
that  he  spoke  to  her  or  communicated  with  her.  (Tr.  44-45)  From  Applicant’s  responses  to  some
questions at the hearing, it is apparent that he has some difficulties communicating in English.

important  population  centers.  The  United  States  provided  more  than  $3  billion  in
assistance  to  Somalia  from  2006  to  present.  The  United  States  supports  and  works
closely with Somalia to establish an effective and representative security sector including
military, police, and justice officials.
The State Department has issued a Level 4 Travel Advisory for Somalia advising
U.S. citizens not to travel to Somalia due to crime, terrorism, and piracy. Violent crime is
common throughout Somalia, and criminals target foreigners in Somalia. Terrorism is an
ongoing threat throughout Somalia. The State Department designated Somali-based Al-
Shabaab  as  a  Foreign  Terrorist  Organization.  Al-Shabaab  has  frequently  attacked  a
variety  of  targets  in  Somalia  with  a  wide  range  of  weapons  and  explosives.  In  four
attacks in 2017, Al-Shabaab killed more than 100 people. The majority of those killed in
the four attacks were soldiers and police officers.
In Somalia, human rights abuses occur primarily because of Al-Shabaab’s lawless
behavior.  Some  government  officials  have  also  engaged  in  rapes,  extortions,  and
murders with impunity.
Kenya
Kenya  is  a  republic  with  three  branches  of  government:  a  president,  who  is
directly elected by the people; a bicameral parliament; and a judiciary. After an election
which  was  disputed  in  Kenya’s  Supreme  Court,  President  Kenyatta  took  office  on
November 20, 2017.  The United States and Kenya have partnered in counterterrorism
efforts.
On  March  29,  2018,  the  State  Department  issued  a  Level  2  Travel  Advisory  for
Kenya  “exercise  increased  caution”  and  indicated  “do  not  travel”  to  the  Kenya-Somalia
border  and  some  coastal  areas  due  to  terrorism.”  Violent  crime  and  terrorism  occur
throughout Kenya and are ongoing threats. Somali-based Al-Shabaab and ISIS operate
in Kenya. Terrorists have frequently attacked a variety of targets in Kenya utilizing a wide
range of weapons and explosives. In 23 attacks in 2017, terrorists killed 80 people.
Human  rights  problems  continue  to  occur  in  Kenya,  including  corruption,
politically-motivated killings, forced disappearances, torture, and harsh prison conditions.
Violations  of  privacy,  restrictions  on  freedom  of  the  press  and  assembly,  and  violence
against women continue to occur.
Somalia and Kenya
While Department Counsel has no burden or obligation to present such evidence,
I  agree  with  Applicant’s  observation  that  there  is  no  evidence  of  record  that  the
governments  of  Somalia  and  Kenya  engage  in  the  following  activities:  (1)  spy  on  the
United  States  or  commit  espionage  against  the  United  States;  and  (2)  encourage  or
sponsor terrorism.  There is no record evidence that terrorists use residents of Kenya or
Somalia  to  coerce  their  relatives  in  the  United  States  to  breach  U.S.  security.  The
primary  foreign  influence  security  concern  in  Somalia  and  Kenya  arises  from  terrorism
and  criminal  activity  and  not  from  espionage  from  the  governments  of  those  two
countries.  Terrorists are known to conduct sophisticated and aggressive espionage.

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and
2.b. He admitted ¶ 3.a in part. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  served  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  Air  Force  from  January  1988  to
February  2008,  retired  as  a  technical  sergeant,  and  received  an  honorable  discharge.
He  held  a  security  clearance  while  on  active  duty  and  retained  it  as  a  defense
contractor.
Applicant married in September 1988, divorced in October 1997, and married his
current  spouse  in  August  2011.  His  current  and  former  spouses  are  citizens  and
residents of the United States. He has an adult daughter from his first marriage, who is
a citizen and resident of the United States.
Applicant  is  a  50-year-old  owner,  president,  and  chief  executive  officer  of  a
defense contractor. He is a citizen and resident of the United States. His company does
business  in  the  Middle  East  and  is  a  partner  in  a  joint  venture  in  the  United  Arab
Emirates (UAE). The joint venture provides training, support, operations consulting, and
professional  services  to  governmental  and  military  entities  in  the  UAE.  His  business
partner in the joint venture is a citizen and resident of the UAE, and they have quarterly
telephonic  contact.  Their  last  face-to-face  contact  was  in  June  2016.  The  current
memorandum of agreement creating the joint venture expires in May 2019.
The  joint  venture  had  a  one-year  contract  in  2015-2016  that  provided  human
resource services for a project in the UAE. The gross value of the contract was about
$3,000,000.  The  services  provided  were  professional  services  for  edged-impact-

weaponry-training  services,  the  design  of  bladed  weapons,  and  the  development  of
sporting-tournament  programs.  The  involvement  with  UAE  did  not  include  classified
information,  special  nuclear  material,  U.S.  export-controlled  commodities,  technical
know-how,  or  technical  data.  (Certificate  Pertaining  to  Foreign  Interests,  attached  to
Item 2.)
Applicant  has  been  unable  to  compete  for  or  perform  defense  contracts  in  the
United  States  until  his  company’s  facility  clearance  is  reactivated,  and  it  cannot  be
reactivated  until  his  security  clearance  is  adjudicated.  In  January  2017,  the  Defense
Security  Service  (DSS)  reviewed  the  joint  venture’s  facility  clearance  and  determined
that  joint  venture  is  not  under  foreign  ownership,  control,  or  influence  that  requires
mitigation. (DSS Letter of Jan. 4, 2017, attached to Item 2.) Applicant’s foreign business
activities  have  not  been  limited  to  the  UAE.  The  record  reflects  that  he  also  has  done
business in Italy and Australia. (Item 2 at 36; Certificate Pertaining to Foreign Interests,
attached to Item 3.) His contacts with these countries are not alleged in the SOR.
In order to facilitate the operation of his joint venture in the UAE, Applicant has a
bank  account  in  the  UAE.  When  he  was  interviewed  by  a  security  investigator  in  May
2017, there was no money in the account. (Personal Subject Interview (PSI), attached
to SOR Answer.) When he responded to interrogatories in April 2018, the account had
the minimum balance required to remain open. He holds an active UAE driver’s license,
which he needs in order to drive in the UAE if he remains in the UAE for more than 30
days. He held a UAE identity card, which expired in July 2018, and he does not intend
to renew it. He held a UAE gate-entry card that expired in July 2017.
The UAE is a federation of monarchies consisting of seven emirates. The rules of
the  emirates  constitute  the  Federal  Supreme  Council,  the  country’s  highest  legislative
and  executive  body.  The  emirates  are  under  patriarchal  rule  with  political  allegiance
defined  by  loyalty  to  tribal  leaders,  leaders  of  individual  emirates,  and  leaders  of  the
federation. The United States has had friendly relations with the UAE since its formation
in 1971. The UAE has an influential role in the Middle East and is a key partner for the
United  States.  The  two  countries  enjoy  strong  bilateral  cooperation  on  many  issues,
including  defense.  UAE  ports  host  more  U.S.  Navy  ships  than  anywhere  else  outside
the United States.
The  UAE  is  a  regional  and  global  financial  and  transportation  hub,  and  terrorist
organizations  exploit  it  send  and  receive  financial  support.  It  is  a  drug-transshipment
point for illegal traffickers and its position as a major financial center makes it vulnerable
to money laundering. There have been numerous instances in which U.S. dual-use and
military components have been shipped to Iran, Iraq, and Afghanistan through the UAE,
using methods making it appear that UAE was the final destination.
The  U.S.  Department  of  State  regards  two  emirates,  Abu  Dhabi  and  Dubai,  as
medium-threat  locations  for  terrorist  activity  directed  at  or  affecting  U.S.  Government
interests. The UAE’s participation in the anti-ISIS coalition and the Yemen civil war has
increased the likelihood of terrorist attacks against Western interests.

"In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  the  three  SOR  allegations.  His
admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant was born in Taipei, Taiwan, in 1973 and is 45 years old. He was raised
in Taiwan and graduated from high school in 1991 and college in 1995. He received his
bachelor’s  degree  in  aeronautical  engineering.  After  graduating,  he  relocated  to  the
United  States  to  pursue  his  post-graduate  education  in  engineering.  He  received  two
master’s degrees, one in 1997 and the second in 1999. In 2002, he began a doctorate
program in the United States. He completed his Ph. D. in 2006. All of his U.S. degrees
were awarded by prestigious U.S. universities.
After  receiving  his  second  master’s  degree  in  1999,  Applicant  moved  back  to
Taiwan and worked there for about three years. He returned to the United States to enter
a doctorate program. After receiving his Ph. D., he remained in the United States and has
worked at five U.S. companies. His two most recent positions have been with major U.S.
defense contractors. In December 2016, he was sponsored for a security clearance by

otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record.
the  first  defense  contractor.  Applicant’s  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  was
submitted shortly after he began working for this employer. He changed companies three
months later, and his new employer is continuing to sponsor him for a clearance. (GE 2
at 2; Tr. 14-15.)
While  living  in  Taiwan  in  2002,  Applicant  married  a  Taiwanese  woman.  They
moved  to  the  United States  later that  year when  Applicant  began  his doctoral studies.
They have since had three children, ages, 15, 13, and 9. They were all born in the United
States  and  are  U.S.  citizens.  At  one  point,  they  possessed  Taiwanese  passports.
Applicant  is  unsure  whether  they  are  presently  dual  citizens  of  the  United  States  and
Taiwan. (GE 2 at 4; Tr. at 40-41.)
Applicant’s  first  U.S.  employer  applied  for  Applicant  to  become  a  permanent
resident  in  the  United  States.  In  2011,  the  government  granted  him  and  his  wife  alien
registration  status.  They  became  naturalized  U.S.  citizens  in  July  2016,  a  few  months
before Applicant submitted his SCA. On October 26, 2018, shortly before the hearing in
this case, Applicant submitted a request to the Taiwanese government to renounce his
Taiwanese citizenship. His request was granted on November 27, 2018, after the DOHA
hearing.  His  wife  retains  her  dual  citizenship  with  Taiwan.  Applicant  renounced  his
Taiwanese citizenship based upon the advice of his employers, which have sponsored
him for a security clearance. (AE A and B; Tr. 14, 32.)
Applicant’s  mother,  father,  and  sister  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Taiwan.  His
mother is a homemaker. When Applicant was young, she was a full-time, and later a part-
time,  high  school  teacher.  She  ceased  working  as  a  teacher  when  Applicant  was  in
school. His father is retired. He worked as a teacher at a vocational school. In his SCA,
Applicant  wrote  that neither  of  his  parents had  or presently  has  any  affiliation  with  the
Taiwanese government or its affiliated industries. In his SCA, he reported that he speaks
with his parents weekly. He testified that more recently, he speaks with them “constantly,”
which he then explained is every other week. (Tr. 25, 44.)
Applicant testified that his father paid for his two U.S. master’s degrees. His father
was born in 1941 and was 56 years old when Applicant earned his first master’s degree
in  1997  and  was  58  when  he  earned  his second  master’s. Applicant’s father  retired  in
1996 at the age of 55. (Tr. 54.)
When asked if either the Taiwanese government or the Chinese government paid
for any of his education, Applicant equivocally responded “No, I don’t think so.” When the
question was repeated, he answered “No” and then changed the subject to the low cost
of  education  in Taiwan  and  other matters. Applicant’s  responses and his demeanor  at
that  point  in  the  hearing  suggested  that  he  may  not  have  been  completely  candid  in
answering  questions  about  who  paid  his  tuition  and  living  expenses  for  four  years  of
graduate  education  while  he  was  studying  for  his  two  master’s  degrees  in  the  United
States. Applicant also testified that he paid  the expenses for his doctorate studies with
his  own  savings  from  when  he  worked  in  Taiwan  for  three  years  (1999-2002)  and  by
working as a research assistant at his U.S. university. (Tr. 41, 54, 55.)
Applicant’s sister is a professor at a public university in Taiwan. She also received
a Ph. D. from a U.S. university. In his SCA, he wrote that he communicates with his sister
monthly. He testified, however, that he actually has much less communication with her
and has not spoken with her since his most recent trip to Taiwan in July 2018, about four
months  earlier.  He  said  he  only  communicates  with  her  when  he  visits  Taiwan.  He
provided no explanation for the discrepancy between his 2016 SCA disclosure and his
testimony on this point. (Tr. 25-26, 44.)
The parents and the siblings of Applicant’s wife are also citizens and residents of
Taiwan. His wife has a close and continuing relationship with her Taiwanese family. Her
mother worked  as  a  sales  person for a  clothing  company,  and her father worked  as  a
security guard at an apartment building. Both are now retired. Her sister is employed in
the  financial  industry  in  Taiwan.  Her  brother  is  a  salesman,  who  sells  anti-theft,  car-
locking devices.
Applicant’s wife has regular contact with her family in Taiwan. In his SCA, Applicant
wrote that he speaks with his mother and father-in-law monthly by phone. At the hearing,
he testified that he merely says hello to his wife’s parents once a month when he happens
to be in the same room as his wife when she is talking on the phone with her parents. In
his background interview, he said that he has monthly telephone contact with his sister-
in-law  and  brother-in-law  when  he  is  with  his  wife  and  she  is  talking  with  them  on  the
phone. At the hearing, he described his contacts with his sister-in-law and brother-in-law
in the same manner. (GE 1 at 30-32; GE 2 at 4; Tr. at 26, 44, and 51-53.)
In  response  to  Section  19  (“Foreign  Contacts”)  of  the  SCA,  Applicant  disclosed
that he has three friends from his undergraduate days with whom he has “close and/or
continuing  contact.”  He  noted  that  he  maintains  annual  contact  with  each  of  them.  He
testified that in addition to their contacts as undergraduates in Taiwan, he also lived with
them in Taiwan for about six months in 2002 before he moved to the United States for his
doctorate program. He testified without any explanation that he “was required to provide
three names in Taiwan” and that it “was hard for me to generate those three names.” The
three “foreign contacts” he identified are not the three persons he was asked to identify
in  response  to  Section  16  (“People  Who  Know  You  Well”)  of  his  SCA.  He  provided
information for four persons with U.S. addresses in response to that question. (Tr. at 15,
26, 27, and 44-45.)
The  three  foreign  contacts  Applicant  identified  work  for  an  aircraft  engine
maintenance company, an electronic equipment inspection company, and a company that
manufactures power supply lines for computers. Applicant had to contact them to obtain
their employment information in his SCA because he did not know what they did or the
names of their employers. Furthermore, he testified that he does not “visit my friend[s]
that much” and “basically I don’t have a friend in Taiwan.” He did admit though that he
and his wife saw one of his listed foreign contacts in the hospital during his most recent
trip to Taiwan in the summer of 2018, but claimed that this person “forced me to meet
with him.” (Tr. 15-16, 26, and 45-49.)
Throughout  his  testimony  discussing  his  three  foreign  relationships,  Applicant
attempted to minimize the extent of his contacts with them, making the point that he did
not have their phone numbers and only communicated with them through social media.
He testified that his contacts with them were “actually” limited to the 1997 or 1998 time
period, when he and one friend communicated about their courses in mathematics. He
failed to reconcile this statement with his testimony that he actually lived with these three
persons in 2002. He also testified that “even though I know they work in the technology
industry but I don’t exactly know what they do in Taiwan, their job descriptions in detail
because basically we don’t talk about it.” In his background interview, however, he told
the interviewer that with respect to one of the friends, they work in the same industry and
frequently  discuss  industry  topics  when  they  have  contact.  Applicant’s  inconsistent
statements, demeanor, and the credibility of his testimony about his relationships with his
friends suggested that he was attempting to portray falsely his relationships with one or
more of his reported foreign contacts. (GE 2 at 4; Tr. at 26, 27, and 44-45.)
Prior to obtaining his U.S. citizenship in July 2016 and receiving his U.S. passport
a month later, Applicant travelled on his Taiwanese passport. After he was awarded his
Ph. D. in 2006, Applicant has returned to Taiwan six times. Applicant visited Taiwan each
summer in 2016, 2017, and 2018. (GE 2 at 2; Tr. at 65.)
Applicant and his wife have lived in a home they own since 2010, for two years in
one state and then six years in another. Applicant provided no documentary evidence or
testimony of his other financial ties to the United States. He has renounced his Taiwanese
citizenship  and  considers  himself  to  be  an  American.  He  believes  he  has  lived  in  the
United States for a long time, and he followed all of the proper procedures to obtain his
U.S. citizenship. He testified that he has no contact with anyone in Taiwan who works in
his industry. (Tr. 29, 57-58, and 67.)
I  have  taken  administrative  notice  of  the  following  facts  regarding  Taiwan  and
China.  Taiwan  is  a  multi-party  democracy,  established  as  a  separate,  independent
government  by  refugees  from  mainland  China  in  1949.  The  United  States  recognized
Taiwan as an independent government until January 1979, when it formally recognized
the Chinese government as the sole legal government of all of China, including Taiwan.
This has been referred to as the U.S. “One-China” policy. Nevertheless, the United States
and Taiwan enjoy a positive, unofficial relationship.
Chinese actors are the world’s most active perpetrators of economic espionage.
China  aggressively  targets  sensitive  and  protected  U.S.  technologies  and  military
information,  using  worldwide  intelligence  operations,  including  Chinese  intelligence
operatives  based  in  Taiwan.  The  United  States  faces  a  serious  threat  to  its  national
security  from  Chinese  intelligence  collection  operations.  China  uses  it  intelligence
services and employs other illicit approaches that violate U.S. laws and export controls to
obtain  important  export-restricted  technologies  and  equipment.  China’s  collection
activities include the use of Chinese nationals, such as students and researchers to act
as procurement agents or intermediaries.
Taiwan has a strong economy and maintains significant economic contacts with
China.  For  many  years,  Taiwan  has  also  been  an  active  collector  of  U.S.  economic
intelligence and technology, including dual-use technologies that have sensitive military
applications.  There  have  been  numerous  cases  involving  illegal  export  or  attempted
export of sensitive, dual-use technology to Taiwan.

"Applicant is a 37-year-old software engineer. Since August 2014, he has worked
for his security clearance sponsor, a major defense contractor. He worked for the same
company as a software intern in 2013 to 2014 while pursuing his undergraduate degree.
He submitted his application for a clearance (SCA) on March 24, 2015. The SCA is his
first  application  for a  security  clearance.  His  background  interview  occurred  on  July  6,
2017.3
Applicant was born in Taiwan and immigrated to the United States with his parents
in March 1996 at the age of 14. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in October 2001,
when he was 19 years old. He earned a high school diploma in 2000. Ten years later, he
began  studying  for  an  associate’s  degree  and  then  a  bachelor’s  degree  at  U.S.
educational  institutions.  He  received  his  associate’s  degree  in  June  2011  and  his
bachelor’s in June 2014, when he was 32 years old. He is presently pursuing a master’s
degree in engineering at an elite U.S. university. (Tr. 6-7, 25, and 29.)
Applicant’s mother is a  dual U.S. and Taiwan  citizen.  She  resides in  the  United
States  and  returns  to  Taiwan  for medical  treatment  once  or  twice  a  year  for  a  total  of
about  two  or  three  weeks.  She  is  mentally  and  physically  disabled.  She  worked  in  a
restaurant in the United States from 2000 to 2006 until she became disabled. She owns
rental properties and supports herself on the rental income produced by the properties.
Applicant talks with his mother a few times a year. Prior to 1996, Applicant’s mother was
a housewife in Taiwan. Applicant has limited contact with his mother. (Tr. 22-28.)
Applicant’s father and mother are divorced. After relocating to the United States in
1996 with Applicant and his mother, his father moved back to Taiwan because he did not
like living in the United States. During the period 1997 to 2000, his father visited Applicant
and his mother about two to three weeks each year. Applicant testified that his father was
a helicopter pilot in Taiwan providing disaster relief and that he is now elderly and retired.
Applicant  assumes  without  knowing  for  sure  that  his  father  worked  for  a  Taiwanese
government  agency.4  In  his  background  interview,  Applicant  described  his  father’s
occupation as “a retired policeman.” (Tr. 28-41; GE 2 at 7.)
After  2000,  Applicant  had  a  more  distant  relationship  with  his  father,  who
subsequently divorced Applicant’s mother and remarried a woman in Taiwan. Applicant
2  Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  his  security  clearance  application,  dated  March  24,
2015, (GE 1), unless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record.
3 The record does not reveal the reason for the delay of more than two years between the submission of
the SCA and his interview. Applicant confirmed the accuracy of the investigator’s report of the interview in
response to DOHA’s interrogatories, dated May 21, 2018. (GE 2 at 11.)
4  Applicant  was  given  the  opportunity  to  confirm  his  assumption  or  otherwise  change  his  testimony  by
January  17,  2019.  (Tr.  31-32.)  As  noted  above,  he  failed  to  provide  any  further  information  after  the
conclusion of the hearing.
testified, however, that his father did provide financial support for Applicant while he was
attending college. They had frequent contact during that period. He testified that since he
graduated in 2014, Applicant only exchanges text messages with his father on holidays.
He  last  spoke  with  his  father  in  February  2018  when  Applicant’s  wife  had  a  baby.
Applicant testified that because his father was elderly, his father does not communicate
by  phone  often.  In  his  2015  SCA,  however,  he  wrote  that  he  spoke  with  his  father  by
phone on a weekly basis. In his July 2017 background interview, he stated that he  had
monthly contacts with his father by phone and last saw him in May 2017 when Applicant
visited Taiwan. His father also had two children from his first marriage. They are citizens
and residents of Taiwan. Applicant has no contact with his half-brother and half-sister.
(Tr. 28-41; GE 2 at 7.)
Applicant married a Taiwanese woman in January 2011, and the couple divorced
in January 2012. In his background interview, he reported that he sponsored this woman
for legal residency in the United States and that he believes they were introduced so that
he would marry her, which would permit her to remain in the United States legally because
she only had a  “visa,” presumably a tourist visa.  On his March 2015 SCA, he failed to
disclose his sponsorship of his first wife in response to a question about any sponsorship
of a foreign national in Section 20B of the SCA. He testified that this omission was due to
his misunderstanding of the “definition of sponsor.” According to his SCA, he moved out
of  a  residence  in  July  2011  that  he  had  owned  and  lived  in  since  May  2010.  For
unexplained reasons, he transferred this residence to his wife as part of their divorce after
only one year of marriage, and, it appears, after only cohabiting with her as a married
couple from January 2011 to July 2011. They had no children. (GE 2 at 6; Tr. 42, 45-48,
and 50.)
According to his March 2015  SCA, Applicant lived in rental properties from July
2011 until 2015. He testified at the hearing that he purchased a condominium sometime
in 2015 and that this is his current residence. In his background interview, he reported
that he purchased this residence in June 2015, which was shortly after the date of the
SCA, and that he rented a room to a Chinese student attending a U.S. university from
June  2015  until  late  2017  or  early  2018.  The  roommate  moved  out  of  Applicant’s
residence when Applicant’s second wife was about to deliver their child. The SOR alleges
this foreign contact as a security concern under Guideline B in ¶ 1.d and alleges under
Guideline E in ¶ 2.d Applicant’s failure to disclose his contact with this person in his SCA.
The record is undeveloped whether Applicant knew this person when he submitted his
SCA in March 2015 and whether he kept in contact with him after he moved out. (GE 2
at 6; Tr. 42, 45-48, and 50.)
Although the record is not completely clear, Applicant’s new wife appears to be the
woman he described as his “girlfriend” in his July 2017 background interview. According
to  his  January  2019  testimony,  they  met  in  late  2016  or  early  2017  and  have  “been
married for about two years or so,” i.e., in early 2017. If accurate, they were married prior
to his interview and Applicant did not disclose his remarriage. The couple had a child in
February 2018, six or seven months after the interview. In his interview, he described his
“girlfriend” as a Chinese citizen, who worked as a civil engineer in the United States and
was a legal resident.5 (GE 2 at 6; Tr. 42, 45-50.)
In  his  July  2017  background  interview,  Applicant  reported  that  he  maintained
contact with a former girlfriend, who is a citizen and resident of Taiwan. They broke up in
April  2017,  but  continued  their  friendship  and  “video  chatting.""  He  reported  that  they
started dating in 2015. At the hearing, he testified that they started dating about three and
one-half years prior to the hearing date, which would be after the date of his March 2015
SCA. He then testified confusingly that he did not “have a good reason for” omitting this
foreign contact in his SCA. He speculated that the relationship “must just have slipped
[his] mind.” In his background interview, he only mentioned one former girlfriend from a
foreign country with whom he had a relationship between 2015 and April 2017. He also
testified, however, that he began dating this ex-girlfriend in late 2013 and the relationship
ended in November 2014. The timing suggests that either he was confused or there were
two former girlfriends, one from 2013 to 2014 and a second from 2015 to 2017. In either
event, he omitted at least one ex-girlfriend as a foreign contact in his SCA. (Tr. 42-43 and
49; GE 2 at 7.)
In his July 2017 background interview, Applicant listed 11 other foreign contacts
with whom he had or continues to have close and/or continuing contact, but did not report
on  his  SCA.  He  testified  that  he  misunderstood  the  question.  These  contacts  are  all
Taiwanese and Chinese citizens. Some reside in their home country and some reside in
the United States. He also reported multiple trips to Taiwan (June 2014, May 2015, and
May 2017) and China (June 2014, June 2016, August 2016, and July 2017). In his March
2015 SCA, he reported travel to Taiwan in 2012, but failed to disclose his June 2014 trip
to Taiwan and China. At the hearing, he offered no explanation for his repeated trips to
Taiwan and China during the 2012 to 2017 period, although, as noted above, he did report
in his interview that he visited his father in Taiwan in May 2017. (GE 2 at 7-8.)
In his background interview, Applicant reported that he has twice been offered jobs
to work at the Central Intelligence Agency, but turned down these offers in favor of other
jobs. He reported further that he had a pending application with that agency at the time
of the interview. (GE 2 at 7-8.)
Applicant  worked  in  the  banking  industry  before  he  began  his  undergraduate
studies  in  2010.  From  2005  to  2008,  he  worked  at  a  bank  as  a  “Personal Banker,”  as
opposed to a teller. At that bank, he concentrated his efforts in the areas of home equity
lines of credit, business loans, and mortgage lending. He testified that he was not involved
5  Subparagraph  1.e  of  the  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  has  several  close  friends  who  are  citizens  and
residents of Taiwan or China. Subparagraph 2.d alleges that he falsified information in response to Section
19 of his SCA by not disclosing these Taiwanese or Chinese friends. The SOR did not specifically allege
that this woman was a foreign contact of Applicant. In his July 2017 background interview, he reported that
he started texting her in May 2016. If that is the month in which he met her, then he would have not been
obligated to identify her as a foreign contact in his March 2015 SCA.
with  opening  new  accounts  and  did  not  need  to  do  so  to  meet  his  requirements.6  His
branch manager had monthly or quarterly quotas to meet for opening of new accounts.
As the end of the month or quarter would approach and the manager determined that his
branch was not meeting its quota, the manager would encourage his bankers, including
Applicant,  to  open  “shell”  accounts  to  increase  the  branch’s  numbers.  Shell  accounts
were not real bank accounts and were opened with only a few dollars provided by the
banker or the  manager, and  they  were  subsequently  closed.  At  the  hearing,  Applicant
admitted opening shell accounts for his family members. He also admitted this conduct
was unethical, and when asked why he engaged in this unethical conduct, his response
was “because everyone was doing it.” (Tr. 53-65; GE 2 at 5.)
In  2008,  Applicant’s  employer fired  him.  According  to  his  background  interview,
this happened in November 2008. In his SCA, he wrote that  his employment ended in
February 2008. Applicant failed to disclose on his SCA that he had been fired. In response
to  the  question  in  the  application  regarding  his  reason  for  leaving  that  job,  Applicant
responded “Moved.” (GE 2 at 5.)
In his background interview, he reported that he was not sure what happened and
did not believe the bank. He also said that his friends told him it did not matter what he
wrote  on  his  “security  forms” because  he  could  explain  what  happened  latter.  It  is not
clear from the investigator’s report of the interview whether he volunteered that he was
fired or was  confronted  by  the  interviewer  with  this fact.  He  testified,  however, that  he
learned he had been fired from the investigator and tried to get more information from the
investigator about his termination. He admitted in his SOR Response that he was in fact
fired from that position. (Tr. at 61; GE 2 at 5-6.)
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  resisted  admitting  that  he  knew  he  had  been  fired,
claiming he was confused by what happened and was never told why he was fired.  He
testified that when he was terminated, the employer’s representative used the words: “We
have to let you go.” He testified further that he was told by his employer that his actions
were not the bank’s “ways.” He refused to admit that he lost his job because he opened
“shell accounts.” He was walked out of the bank that day in 2008, though he testified that
he was never told he was fired.7 (Tr. 53-66.)
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  tried  to  explain  the  discrepancy  between  the  false
statement in his SCA and his testimony by stating that at the time he prepared the SCA,
he did not know that he was fired. Applicant testified at length that he was “the top one
percent  banker”  at  his  bank.  He  admitted  that  he  did  not  leave  this  job  voluntarily.  He
6 Tr.  58. In  his  background  interview,  he  told  the  investigator  that  his  job  at  the  bank  was  to  open  new
accounts and loans. (GE 2 at 5.)
7 Curiously, he told the background investigator a completely different story  regarding the reason he was
fired. He reported that he was falsely accused of leaving a customer loan document in an empty office on
another floor of the bank. He also testified that the alternative questions in Section 13C about quitting after
being  told  that  he  would  be  fired  or  left  a  job  by  mutual  agreement  following  charges  or  allegations  of
misconduct applied to his situation. (GE 2 at 5; Tr. 64.)
claimed that since he was subsequently hired by another bank, he did not think that there
was any reference to being fired in his record. (Tr. 53-66.)

Applicant  was  born  in Italy,  and  he  lived  there  with  his parents  as a  child.  Both
parents obtained employment in India in 1980, and Applicant and his brother went with
them. He attended high school in India at an international school providing an American
education. After completing high school in 1984, he applied for admission to colleges in
the  United  States.  He  arrived  in  the  United  States  in  1984  on  a  student  visa,  and  he
earned both his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in aerospace engineering in 1988 and
1989, respectively. He then took a year off to travel to India where he divided his time
between his family, former high school friends, and travel in India.
Applicant returned to the United States in early 1991 to attend a Ph.D. program
in aerospace engineering. He spent the next nine years working on his doctorate, which
was  awarded  in  December  2000.  This  included  working  as  a  graduate  research
1  For  ease  of  understanding  the  facts  of  this  case,  Applicant  prepared  a  summary  of  key  points  and  a
timeline, including an extended family tree for his Chinese relatives. (Exhibit W at 1-3) He also submitted
a  biography  and  a  resume,  both  of  which  are  helpful  in  understanding  his  background  and  experience.

assistant and as a teaching assistant during 1993-2000. In about 1999 or so, he won a
spot in the U.S. State Department’s diversity visa program, which allowed him to apply
for  and  obtain  status  as  a  U.S.  permanent  resident.  He  described  it  as  “an  extremely
lucky, life-changing moment.” (Exhibit C at 2)
Applicant’s  first  engineering  job  was  with  a  technology  company  for  about  two
years  during  2000-2002.  It  was  during  this  time  that  he  met  his  spouse.  She  was
working  for  the  same  company,  was  then  32,  and  had  recently  completed  a  Ph.D.  in
electrical  engineering  from  a  top-notch  public  research  university.  She  was  then  a
Chinese citizen, but had been lawfully living in the United States since 1995. (Tr. 33-34)
After dating for about a year, they married in late 2002. (Exhibit U) They also relocated
to the state where they currently  live so she could accept a job with a state university,
where she has been employed as a professor since 2003.
Applicant was unemployed upon their relocation until about May 2003, when he
began  work  as  a  research  engineer  for  a  small  company.  The  job  required  that  he
undergo  an  investigation  for  a  public  trust  position,  which  was  completed  in  2003.
(Exhibit  1  at  38-39).  During  this  period  of  employment  he  obtained  U.S.  citizenship  in
May 2004, and obtained a U.S. passport shortly thereafter. (Exhibit P) He had that job
until December 2005, when he began his current job in the defense industry. He went
through the required background investigation and was granted a security clearance for
his  employment.  He  expressed  a  good  understanding  of  the  responsibilities  and
obligations that come with being granted access to classified information. (Tr. 66-67)
In  2005,  Applicant’s  spouse  was  still  a  Chinese  citizen  as  well  as  a  U.S.
permanent  resident,  and  his  mother-in-law  and  father-in-law  were  citizens  of  and
residents  in  China.  Subsequently,  his  spouse  obtained  U.S.  citizenship  in  2008,  and
obtained a  U.S.  passport shortly  thereafter. (Exhibit  Q)  Upon becoming  a  U.S.  citizen,
she swore an oath of allegiance to the United States, thereby renouncing all allegiance
and fidelity to China and any other foreign country. Unlike the United States, China does
not recognize dual nationality, and therefore she automatically lost, under Chinese law,
Chinese citizenship when she acquired U.S. citizenship. E.g. ISCR Case No. 18-02960
(May 13, 2019) at 3 n. 3.
After  the  birth  of  their  second  child,  Applicant  and  his  spouse  decided  they
needed  help  managing  two  jobs  and  two  small  children.  His  spouse  completed  the
necessary  paperwork  to  sponsor her parents  to  immigrate  to  the United  States,  which
they did in 2010. They have been U.S. permanent residents since April 2010. (Exhibits
R and S) They initially lived in Applicant’s household for a couple of years until Applicant
and his wife purchased a home for them. Applicant and his wife jointly own the home,
they make the monthly payments on the mortgage loan, and they pay the regular living
expenses incurred by her parents. (Tr. 72-73)
Applicant’s  spouse  has  progressed  through  the  rank  of  assistant  professor,
associate  professor,  and  is  now  a  full  professor.  She  is  an  accomplished  and  well-
regarded  academic,  as  shown  by  the  highly  favorable  letters  of  recommendation
submitted  by  a  fellow  professor  in  the  same  department  as  well  as  the  professor  who
serves as the department head. (Exhibit B) The department head has not observed any
activities that might indicate that she has preference for China over the United States,
and  believes  that  she  and  Applicant  have  established  a  completely  normal  and
productive  life.  (Exhibit  B  at  2-3)  Applicant’s  spouse  has  more  than  200  journal  and
conference  publications,  and  she  has  been  recognized  for  numerous  professional
achievements.  For  example,  she  received  the  Presidential  Early  Career  Award  for
Scientists and Engineers, which was presented at The White House. (Exhibit I)
Applicant’s spouse completed work on two occasions in 2014 and 2016 on behalf
of a research organization in Hong Kong. The work was considered part of her duties to
increase the international visibility of her department and the university. (Exhibit B at 2-
3)  The  work  was  on  an  ad  hoc  basis,  and  she  was  never  a  permanent  member  or
employee  of  the  organization.  On  both  occasions,  she  evaluated  research  funding
proposals  submitted  to  the  organization;  her  work  was  performed  within  the  United
States without having to travel to foreign locations; and the work was completed through
written/electronic  communication.  (Exhibit  B  at  2-3)  Applicant  explained  the  proposals
involved open literature material that can be found in trade journals, similar to proposals
submitted to the National Science Foundation or the National Institute for Health here in
the  United  States.  (Tr.  38)  She  received  an  honorarium  on  each  occasion  from  the
organization for her work. Applicant described the payments as minimal, guessing $500
to $800. (Tr. 37-38) Applicant searched for and submitted the e-mails related to the two
proposals, and they appear to be normal academic research matters. (Exhibit V) The e-
mails indicate the work for the 2014 proposal resulted in an honorarium of $146. (Exhibit
V  at  4)  Applicant  also  stated  that  she  has  routinely  reviewed  such  proposals  for
organizations in the United States. (Tr. 39-40)
Applicant’s mother-in-law and father-in-law were lifelong residents of China until
they immigrated to the United States in 2010. Both are retired university professors. His
father-in-law is 80 years old, and his mother-in-law is 76 years old. Applicant has weekly
to  monthly  contact  with  his  parents-in-law;  the  contact  was  more  frequent  when
childcare was involved. (Tr. 42) He indicated that, because he does not speak Mandarin
and  they  do  not  speak  English  well,  conversations  with  his  in-laws  are  limited  to  the
usual  pleasantries,  as  their  primary  focus  is  on  their  daughter  and  their  two
grandchildren.  (Tr.  42-43)  His  spouse  has  more  frequent  contact  with  her  parents,  as
she  takes  them  shopping,  to  medical  appointments,  and  to other  appointments  due  to
their advanced age and limited English-language skills.
Before  their  careers  as  university  professors,  Applicant’s  mother-in-law  and
father-in-law  experienced  difficulties  under  the  Chinese  government.  His  father-in-law
was  required  to  join  the  Communist  Party  and  serve  in  the  military  as  a  means  to
safeguard  his  family  from  starvation  during  the  Great  Chinese  Famine  of  1958-1961.
His mother-in-law spent about eight years (1967-1975) in a labor or re-education camp
for anti-communist activities. Applicant’s spouse was conceived during a conjugal visit,
and her mother was temporarily paroled or released from the labor camp to give birth in
1969.  After  the  mother’s  return  to  the  labor  camp,  the  maternal  grandmother  was  the
primary  caregiver  to  Applicant’s  spouse.  As  a  result,  Applicant’s  spouse  had  a  close
relationship to her maternal grandmother.
The maternal  grandmother  and  grandfather were  successful business  people  in
China  and  managed  to  accumulate  financial  assets.  (Tr.  69-70)  The  maternal
grandfather  passed  away  many  years  ago.  Applicant  described
the  maternal
grandmother  as  “a  smart  lady”  who  was  able  to  rebuild  the  family’s  wealth  once  the
Chinese  government  introduced  their  form  of  market  capitalism.  The  maternal
grandmother  passed  away  in  2012  leaving  her  estate  to  her  three  surviving  children,
one  of  whom  is  Applicant’s  mother-in-law.  The  surviving  children  have  apparently
decided to pass that wealth directly to their children, one of whom is Applicant’s spouse.
(Tr.  74-75)  Applicant  explained  that  his  in-laws  decided  to  gift  their  share  of  the
inheritance to Applicant and his spouse with the understanding they would take care of
their in-laws’ needs in the United States. (Exhibit 2 at 29)
Although  the  term  “inheritance” is used  throughout  this decision  to describe  the
money  received  by  Applicant  and  his  spouse,  and  the  term  was  used  in  the  same
manner  during  the  hearing,  the  actual  heir  to  the  inheritance  is  the  mother-in-law,  not
Applicant’s spouse. The money gifted to Applicant and his spouse is a form of an early
inheritance.
Disbursement  of  the  inheritance  began  in  August  2013,  the  first  tranche
consisting  of  a  cash transfer from  a  Chinese  bank  in the  amount  of  about  $60,000,  or
$30,000 per person between Applicant and his spouse. (Exhibit W at 8; Exhibit 2 at 34-
42) In 2014, a total of $139,970 in three deposits was transferred ($69,985 per person);
in  2015,  a  total  of  $179,940  in  four  deposits  ($89,970  per  person);  in  2016,  a  total  of
$179,940 ($89,970 per person); and in 2017, a total of $49,970 in two deposits of which
$9,985  was  a  gift  from  a  family  member  unrelated  to  the  inheritance  ($24,985  per
person).  The  cash  transfers  were  made  by  Applicant’s  mother-in-law’s  sister  and
brother  as  well  as  other  family  members.  Applicant  believes  an  additional  $700,000
remains in China as well as two residential properties, which have been difficult to sell.
(Exhibit W at 1; Tr. 58-59) The financial assets are essentially controlled by his mother-
in-law’s sister and brother in China. The cash transfers are at their discretion as to when
the funds are released and in what amounts.
As a matter of general U.S. tax law, a cash inheritance from an individual’s estate
is  not  subject  to  federal  income  tax.  The  same  is  true  for  a  gift  of  cash.  Applicant
understands  that  U.S.  tax  law  allows  for  non-taxable  gifts  from  a  nonresident  alien
person  or  a  foreign  estate  up  to  an  amount  of  U.S.  $100,000  per  person  per  year  to
U.S. permanent residents and citizens. (Exhibit 2 at 33; Exhibit W at 5) If the amount is
$100,000 or less, there is no reporting requirement to the IRS, but receipt of more than
$100,000 requires the filing of IRS Form 3520, annual return to report transactions with
foreign trusts and receipt of  certain foreign gifts. (Exhibit W at 5) Accordingly, the only
guidance Applicant and his spouse have provided is that the cash transfers should be
less than $100,000 per person annually in order to avoid the IRS reporting requirement.
Applicant reported the inheritance to his employer’s facility security officer (FSO)
in June 2014 after receiving the first tranche of the inheritance in August 2013. (Exhibit
2  at  32-33)  At  the  time,  the  intention  was  for  the  money  to  be  given  directly  to
Applicant’s two children through a U.S. trust for their future use, but they subsequently
learned that a minor cannot control a trust. Instead, the money is held in a family trust
established  by  Applicant  and  his  spouse  in  2008.  (Exhibit  O)  The  trust  is  a  revocable
living  trust  and  their  two  children  are  the  beneficiaries.  In  addition  to  self-reporting  the
inheritance  to  the  FSO,  Applicant  disclosed  the  subject  in  his  June  2016  security
clearance application. (Exhibit 1) He further disclosed the sponsorship of his parents-in-
law  to  immigrate  to  the  United  States,  and  he  disclosed  his  spouse’s  work  for  the
research  organization  in  Hong  Kong.  He  provided  additional  information  and  financial
documents  about  the  inheritance  and  the  cash  transfers  in  response  to  written
interrogatories. (Exhibit 2)
Applicant  and  his  spouse  consider  the  inheritance  to  be  a  windfall.  (Tr.  61,  65,
67). Their annual household income of about $240,000 is more than sufficient to meet
their financial needs and cover the living expenses for his mother-in-law and father-in-
law. (Tr. 64) Although they do not need the additional money the inheritance provides,
Applicant and his spouse decided to accept it so the money is here rather than in China.
Given  the  history  of  mistreatment  of  his  mother-in-law  and  father-in-law,  Applicant
understands  they  are  motivated  to  remove  as  many  financial  assets  from  China  as
possible. (Exhibit 2 at 29) He realized it might raise an issue with his security clearance,
but  he  also  realized  the  inheritance  is  a  sizeable  amount  of  money  that  most  people
would not turn away. (Tr. 61) Nevertheless, Applicant was unequivocal in stating that he
and his spouse  are prepared  to forgo  the additional assets  in  China  if  required  by  the
circumstances. (Tr. 81-82)
The  inheritance  money  is  held  in  the  family  trust’s  accounts  with  a  bank  and  a
credit union. (Exhibit K) As of August 31, 2018, the savings and checking accounts with
the bank had a total balance of about $368,184. And as of August 30, 2018, the savings
and  checking  account  with  the  credit  union  had  a  total  balance  of  about  $212,347.
Applicant  estimated  their  net  worth  at  about  $1  million  to  $1.5  million.  (Tr.  63-64,  85;
Exhibit  W  at  4)  Their  personal  residence,  which  they  bought  in  2003,  was  paid  off  in
November  2015.  (Exhibit  M)  They  have  three  joint  investment  accounts,  a  401(k)
account  with  Applicant’s employer, and a health  savings  account for a  total amount  of
about  $192,327  as  of  September  30,  2018.  (Exhibit  L)  They  also  own  two  parcels  of
land  in  their  state  of  residence.  (Exhibit  M  and  W)  Applicant  and  his  spouse  use  the
inheritance money to make the monthly mortgage loan payments for the house in which
his in-laws live and to pay for their recurring living expenses. (Tr. 73-74)
request
Concerning
the  country  of  China,  Department  Counsel’s
for
administrative  notice  contains  an  extensive  discussion  of  the  security  concerns
associated with China. The most pertinent of those facts are the following: (1) China is
an authoritarian state in which the Chinese Communist Party is the paramount authority;
(2)  China  (along  with  Russia)  is  the  most  aggressive  collector  of  intelligence  (both
industrial and military) related to U.S. information and technology; and (3) China has a
poor record of human rights regarding respect for the integrity of the person, respect for
civil  liberties,  respect  for  political  rights,  corruption  and  lack  of  transparency  in
government,  worker  rights,  as  well  as  discrimination,  societal  abuses,  and  human
trafficking. The maltreatment and oppression of the people in Tibet is but one example
of China’s poor human-rights record.
Law and Policies
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (E.O.)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of
Defense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review
Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  National  Security
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.
It  is  well-established  law  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.2  As
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side  of  denials.”3  Under  Egan,  Executive  Order  10865,  and  the  Directive,  any  doubt
about  whether  an  applicant  should  be  allowed  access  to  classified  information  will  be
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that
the  burden  of  proof  is  less  than  a  preponderance  of  evidence.4  The  DOHA  Appeal
Board  has  followed  the  Court’s  reasoning,  and  a  judge’s findings  of  fact  are  reviewed
under the substantial-evidence standard.5
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access  to  classified  information.6  Under  the  Directive,  the  parties  have  the  following
burdens:  (1)  Department  Counsel  has  the  burden  of  presenting  evidence  to  establish
facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for
presenting  evidence  to  refute,  explain,  extenuate,  or  mitigate  facts  that  have  been
admitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain
a favorable clearance decision.7
Discussion
The  gravamen  of  the  SOR  under  Guideline  B  for  foreign  influence  is  whether
Applicant’s  connections  to  China  should  disqualify  him  from  access  to  classified
information. Under Guideline B for foreign influence, the suitability of an applicant may
be  questioned  or  put  into  doubt  due  to  foreign  contacts  and  interests.  The  overall
concern under the guideline is set forth in AG ¶ 6 as follows:
2  Department  of  the  Navy  v.  Egan,  484  U.S.  518,  528  (1988)  (“it  should  be  obvious  that  no  one  has  a
‘right’ to a security clearance”); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no
right to a security clearance).

5 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).
6 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).
7 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶¶ E3.1.14 and E3.1.15.
Foreign  contacts  and  interests,  including  but  not  limited  to  business,
financial,  and  property  interests,  are  a  national  security  concern  if  they
result in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern
if they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or
induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a
way  inconsistent  with  U.S.  interests  or  otherwise  made  vulnerable  to
pressure  or  coercion  by  any  foreign  interest.  Assessment  of  foreign
contacts  and  interests  should  consider  the  country  in  which  the  foreign
contact  or  interest  is  located,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  considerations
such  as  whether it  is known  to  target  U.S. citizens  to  obtain  classified  or
sensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism.
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise a security concern under
AG ¶ 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:
AG  ¶  7(a)  contact,  regardless  of  method,  with  a  foreign  family  member,
business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen
of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk
of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;
AG ¶ 7(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country
that  create  a  potential  conflict  of  interest  between  the  individual's
obligation  to  protect  classified  or  sensitive  information  or  technology  and
the  individual's  desire  to  help  a  foreign  person,  group,  or  country  by
providing that information or technology; and
AG ¶ 7(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign
country,  or  in  any  foreign-owned  or  foreign-operated  business  that  could
subject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or personal
conflict of interest.
The  starting  point  for  the  analysis  is  the  country  of  China.  Suffice  it  to  say,  the
U.S.  Government  views  the  behavior  of  the  Chinese  government  as  presenting  a
serious  national  security  concern.  That  is  sufficient  to  meet  the  heightened-risk
standard.
Concerning Applicant’s connections to China, the SOR alleges he has family ties
to  China  based  on  his  spouse’s  dual  citizenship  with  the  United  States  and  China  as
well  as  the  Chinese  citizenship  of  his  mother-in-law  and  father-in-law.  In  addition,  the
SOR  alleges  his  spouse’s  connections  to  China  via  her  work  for  the  research
organization  in  Hong  Kong.  First,  Applicant’s  spouse  is  no  longer  a  citizen  of  China
because  China  does  not  recognize  dual  nationality,  and  her  citizenship  is  exclusively
with  the  United  States.  His  spouse’s  citizenship  status  does  not  present  any  concern.
Second, the Chinese citizenship of his mother-in-law and father-in-law and his spouse’s
work  on  two  proposals  in  2014  and  2016  for  the  research  organization  in  Hong  Kong
are sufficient to raise the disqualifying conditions in AG ¶ 7(a) and AG ¶ 7(b).
The  SOR  also  alleges  in  two  separate  allegations  the  receipt  of  funds  from  the
inheritance based in China. The two allegations were treated as one during the hearing
because it is the same matter based on the same facts and circumstances. The receipt
of  the funds from  the  inheritance  (about  $600,000  during  2013-2017  with  the  potential
for  another  $700,000  or  so)  from  China,  a  country  that  raises  a  heightened  risk  for
foreign influence, is sufficient to raise the disqualifying condition in AG ¶ 7(f).
The guideline provides that certain facts and circumstances may mitigate foreign
influence  concerns.  Given  the  evidence  here,  I  considered  the  following  mitigating
conditions:
AG ¶ 8(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country
in  which  these  persons  are  located,  or  the positions  or activities  of  those
persons  in  that  country  are  such  that  it  is  unlikely  the  individual  will  be
placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign
individual,  group,  organization,  or  government  and  the  interests  of  the
United States;
AG  ¶  8(b)  there  is  no  conflict  of  interest,  either  because  the  individual’s
sense  of  loyalty  or  obligation  to  the  foreign  person,  or  allegiance  to  the
group,  government,  or  country  is  so  minimal,  or  the  individual  has  such
deep  and  longstanding  relationships  and  loyalties  in  the  United  States,
that  the  individual  can  be  expected  to  resolve  any  conflict  of  interest  in
favor of the U.S. interest; and
AG ¶ 8(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or
property  interests  is  such  that  they  are  unlikely  to  result  in  a  conflict  and
could  not  be  used  effectively  to  influence,  manipulate,  or  pressure  the
individual.
China’s  relationship  with  the  United  States  and  the  heightened  risk  it  presents
place  a  heavy  burden  on  Applicant  to  mitigate  the  security  concern.  With  that  said,
Applicant  has  multiple  indicators  of  a  mature,  stable,  responsible,  and  trustworthy
person.  He  was  serious,  candid,  and  credible  at  the  hearing.  He  has  cooperated  fully
and provided truthful information throughout the security clearance process. He made a
good  impression  upon  me  during  the  hearing.  I  have  considered  the  totality  of
Applicant’s  connections  to  China  via  his  marriage  to  a  native  of  China.  Overall,  he
provided  sufficient  evidence  to  explain  and  mitigate  the  foreign  influence  security
concern stemming from those connections. The rationale is set forth below.
To begin, Applicant came to the United States  about 35 years ago as a college
student. He is now wholly invested in the United States, as established by his record of
formal  education  and  his  work  history  in  the  United  States.  In  addition,  he  met  and
married  his  spouse  in  the  United  States,  and  they  have  two  native-born  U.S.  citizen
children.  Before  2013  when  the  receipt  of  the  Chinese  inheritance  began,  he  and  his
spouse’s financial interests were exclusively in the United States. The inheritance is not
a minor matter. It is a substantial amount of money. More to the point, Applicant and his
spouse consider the inheritance to be a windfall. As such, they are willing to forgo the
receipt  of  any  additional  funds  without  an  adverse  impact  on  their  overall  financial
situation.
Applicant  has  also  been  transparent  and  forthcoming  about  the  inheritance.  He
initially  reported  the  subject  to  his  company’s  FSO  in  June  2014,  which  was  within
months  of  receipt  of  the  first  tranche  of  funds  in  August  2013.  And  he  provided
additional  information  during  the  security  clearance  process.  By  self-reporting  the
inheritance, Applicant did exactly what is expected of a person who is currently eligible
for access to classified information. See Directive, Enclosure 2, ¶ 2(f). His self-reporting
put  the  Government  on  notice  and  allowed  the  Government  to  put  the  matter  under
scrutiny.  His  willingness  to  self-report  the  inheritance  strongly  suggests  he  would  be
willingly to report any potential security infraction or violation or other matters that may
be contrary to his self-interest.
The cash transfers occur  through banking channels. The money is deposited in
the family trust’s accounts held by U.S. financial institutions. Applicant has been careful
to ensure compliance with any reporting requirements mandated by the IRS. The cash
transfers  will  end  when  the  mother-in-law’s  share  of  the  inheritance  has  been  fully
disbursed.  There  is  no  evidence  that  the  cash  transfers  are  contrary  to  U.S.  law,  and
Department Counsel made no such argument. Overall, the cash transfers appear to be
a  normal way  for  an  inheritance  located  in a foreign  country,  in  this case  China,  to  be
disbursed  to  an  heir  in  the  United  States.  Given  the  circumstances,  the  mitigating
condition  at  AG  ¶  8(f)  applies  because  the  financial  interest  at  issue  here,  an
inheritance, despite its substantial size,  is of a routine nature that is unlikely to pose a
conflict, and it is unlikely to be used to influence, manipulate, or pressure Applicant.
Concerning  family  ties  to  China,  there  have  been  changes  since  Applicant  was
favorably adjudicated for a security clearance more than a decade ago. First, Applicant
and his spouse have had more time to develop their ties and connections to the United
States.  Their  ties  and  connections  are  deep,  including  their  respective  careers  as
engineers,  in  which  they  are  both  accomplished  and  successful,  and  their  two  native-
born  U.S.  citizen  children.  He  has  also  successfully  held  a  security  clearance  and
adhered  to  security  rules  and  requirements  for  his  employment  with  a  defense
contractor.  Second,  his  spouse,  a  full  professor  at  a  state  university,  is  now  a  U.S.
citizen  and  no  longer  a  citizen  of  China.  Third,  his  parents-in-law,  while  still  Chinese
citizens,  are  now  living  in  the  United  States  as  lawful  permanent  residents.  Their
presence  here  adds  an  additional  degree  of  separation  from  the  potential  for  undue
influence exerted by the Chinese government.
In  addition,  Applicant’s  spouse’s  work  in  reviewing  funding  proposals  on  two
occasions for the research organization in Hong Kong is not unusual or troubling. Nor is
the  work  part of  an  ongoing  employment  relationship  or  contractual  arrangement.  The
work was done on an ad hoc basis. It is the type of work that is common and expected
of  a  university  professor  in  an  engineering  department.  The  work  was  not  financially
lucrative,  she  was  paid  an  honorarium.  And  the  work  was  done  here  in  the  United
States, with no travel to Hong Kong or in-person interaction with Chinese officials.
10
Given  the  totality  of  facts  and  circumstances,  I  conclude  that  it  is  unlikely
Applicant  will be  placed  in a  position  of  having  to  choose  between  the  interests of  the
United  States  and  the  interests  of  the  Chinese  government  or  family  members  who
have Chinese citizenship or residence. I further conclude there is no conflict of interest,
because  Applicant  has  developed  such  deep  and  long-standing  relationships  and
loyalties in the United States that he can be expected to resolve any potential conflict of
interest in the favor of the United States. Overall, I am persuaded that Applicant and his
spouse are good people who are doing good things that benefit the United States, and
their interests are aligned with the interests of the United States. AG ¶ 8(a) is partially
applicable. AG ¶ 8(b) is applicable.
Following  Egan  and  the  clearly  consistent  standard,  I  have  no  doubts  or
concerns  about  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  good  judgment,  and  ability  to
protect  classified  or  sensitive  information.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  I  weighted  the
evidence  as  a  whole  and  considered  if  the  favorable  evidence  outweighed  the
unfavorable  evidence  or  vice  versa.  I  also  considered  the  whole-person  concept.
Accordingly, I conclude that he met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is
clearly consistent with the national interest to grant his eligibility for access to classified
information.

"In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant  admitted, with comments, all of the factual
allegations  in  ¶¶  1.a.  through  1.c.,  of  the  SOR.  Applicant’s  admissions  and  comments
are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the
evidence  in  the  record,  and  upon  due  consideration  of  same,  I  make  the  following
additional findings of fact:
Applicant  is  a  47-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
serving  as  senior  service  engineer  with  his  current  employer  since  November  2008.
Applicant’s  primary  education  has  not  been  described,  and  little  information  is  known
about  his  secondary  education.  He  attended  a  technical  university  in  Russia  for  six
years, but did not receive a diploma. He has never served with the U.S. military or any
other military.    He  has  never held  a  security  clearance.  Applicant married  in 1992.  He
has one daughter, born in 1993.
Foreign Influence
Applicant  was  born  in  1972  to  Russian  parents  residing  in  Russia.  Educated  in
Russia, in 2001, he and his Russian-born wife immigrated to the United States through
the  U.S.  Diversity  Immigrant  Visa  Program,  known  as  the  Visa  Lottery.  He  became  a
naturalized  U.S.  citizen  in  2009.  It  is  unclear  when  his  wife  was  naturalized.  When
Applicant and his wife became naturalized U.S. citizens, they took an oath of allegiance
to the United States.  That oath is as follows:
I  hereby  declare,  on  oath,  that  I  absolutely  and  entirely  renounce  and
abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or
sovereignty, of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen;
that  I  will  support  and  defend  the  Constitution  and  laws  of  the  United
States  of  America  against  all  enemies,  foreign  and  domestic;  that  I  will
bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I will bear arms on behalf
of  the  United  States  when  required  by  the  law;  that  I  will  perform
noncombatant  service  in  the  Armed  Forces  of  the  United  States  when
required by the law; that I will perform work of national importance under
civilian  direction  when  required  by  the  law;  and  that  I  take  this obligation
freely,  without any  mental reservation  or purpose of evasion;  so  help me
God. (8 C.F.R. § 337.1(a) (1995).)
Applicant’s Russian-born daughter is also a naturalized U.S. citizen. They have resided
in their own family home in the same U.S. city and county since at least October 2004.
Applicant’s mother passed away in 2000. She had previously worked as a ticket
distributor on a bus line. His nearly 79-year old father, now retired and in poor health as
a cancer survivor, worked as a driver, mechanic, tire repairer, and glass installer for the
same employer as Applicant’s mother. After  their divorce, Applicant’s father remarried.
Applicant’s nearly 73-year old stepmother was also born in Russia, and is in poor health
as  a  cancer  survivor.  She  retired  from  a  non-government  job  not  otherwise  specified.
Applicant’s  in-laws  were  Russian-born  citizen-residents.  His  father-in-law,  who  passed
away in 2018, was a retired vehicle driver. His mother-in-law, now in her mid-60s, after
having  suffered a  stroke,  is  a  retired  postal worker.  After Applicant’s  parents  divorced,
his  mother’s  brother,  his  uncle,  a  Russian-born  citizen-resident  in  his  mid-60s,  helped
raise him. He assisted Applicant to come to the United States, and considered coming
himself. He was or is a retired security officer at a mall. Applicant’s father, stepmother,
and  uncle,  as  well  as  his  mother-in-law,  reside  very  far  from  the  areas  of  turmoil  in
Russia: Chechnya and the Northern Caucasus. No member of Applicant’s family has a
past  or  current  relationship  with  the  Russian  government,  military,  or  intelligence
services.
Applicant’s contacts with his father (and step-mother) was previously monthly by
phone, but it has diminished to one to two times per year. His contact with his mother-
in-law  is  generally  monthly,  when  his  wife  calls  her  mother.  Applicant  speaks  with  his
uncle on a monthly basis. Applicant has not visited his family in Russia since he arrived
in  the  United  States  in  2001,  and  he  has  no  plans  to  return  to  Russia  within  the  next
decade, or more.
Applicant  has  furnished  emergency  financial  assistance  to  various  members  of
his family  and  extended family  in  Russia. After his  mother-in-law  suffered a  stroke, he
sent  her  $300.  Over  the  past  ten  years,  he  has  sent  her  a  total  of  $600,  an  amount
which  he  considers  insignificant.  Over  the  years,  Applicant  has  sent  his  uncle  various
small  amounts,  and the  total over the past ten  years is less  than $1,000.  He  currently
does not send any financial assistance to his family or extended family in Russia.
Russia
Russia  is  composed  of  21  republics.  The  Government  consists  of  a  strong
president, a prime minister, a bicameral legislature, and a weak judiciary often subject
to political manipulation. It is a vast and diverse country with a population of 142 million
people. It achieved independence with the dissolution of the Soviet Union on August 24,
1991, and remains a nuclear superpower that continues to develop politically, socially,
and  economically.  On  paper,  Russia  has  recognized  the  legitimacy  of  international
human  rights  standards,  but  it  continues  to  be  a  “police  state”  where  human  rights
abuses are rampant. There are numerous reports of human rights abuses, including law
enforcement  personnel engaged  in  torture,  abuse,  and  violence  to coerce  confessions
from  suspects,  with  little  accountability,  despite  the  fact  that  the  law  prohibits  such
practices;  widespread corruption  within  the police  force;  arbitrary  arrest  and  detention;
politically  motivated  arrests;  abductions;  and  life  threatening  prison  conditions.  The
media is largely state-controlled. There are restrictions on freedom of movement within
the  country,  and  all  adults  must  carry  government-issued  internal  passports  while
traveling  internally,  and  they  are  required  to  register  with  the  local  authorities  within  a
specified time of their arrival at a new location.
Russia’s  two  main  intelligence  services  are  the  Russian  Foreign  Intelligence
Service  (SVR)  and  the  main  Intelligence  Directorate  of  the  General  Staff  (GRU),  both
overseen  by  the  Russian  National  Security  Council  and  coordinated  through  the
Permanent Interbranch Commissions of the National Security. Its intelligence capability
is significant and focuses on collection of information from the United States. The Soviet
Union engaged in a series of high profile espionage missions against the United States,
and  Russia  has  continued  the  tradition.  Russia  is  one  of  the  two  most  aggressive
collectors  of  sensitive  and  protected  U.S.  technology  and  accounts  for  the  majority  of
such  targeting.  Russia  also  provides  technologies  which  could  be  used  in  the
construction  of  weapons  of  mass  destruction  and  missiles  to  other  countries.  It  is  a
leading  arms  exporter,  with  major  sales  of  advanced  weapons  and  military-related
technology to China, India, Iran, and Venezuela.  Nevertheless, the United States and
Russia share common interests on a broad range of issues, including counterterrorism
and the drastic reduction of strategic arsenals.
On July 26, 2018, the National Counterintelligence and Security Center released
its  2018  Foreign  Economic  Espionage  in  Cyberspace  Report,  in  which  it  reported  that
foreign  economic  and  industrial  espionage  against  the  United  States  continues  to
represent a significant threat to the United States’ prosperity, security, and competitive
advantage  and  identified  Russia  as  one  of  the  three  most  capable  and  active  cyber
actors  tied  to  economic  espionage  and  the  potential  theft  of  U.S.  trade  secrets  and
proprietary information. It reported that Russia uses cyber operations as an instrument
of intelligence collection to inform its decision-making and benefit its economic interests,
and  that  Russian  intelligence  services  have  conducted  sophisticated  and  large-scale
hacking operations to collect sensitive U.S. business and technology information.
The  report  noted  that,  “[a]n  aggressive  and  capable  collector  of  sensitive  U.S.
technologies,  Russia  uses  cyberspace  as  one  of  many  methods  for  obtaining  the
necessary  know-how  and  technology  to  grown  and  modernize  its  economy.”  Other
methods of collection include use of Russian commercial and academic enterprises that
interact with the West; recruitment of Russian immigrants with advanced technical skills
by the Russian intelligence services; and Russian intelligence penetration of public and
private enterprises, which enable the Russian government to obtain sensitive technical
information from industry.
On February 13, 2018, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI)
issued its Worldwide Threat Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community, Statement
for  the  Record,  in  which  it  assessed  that  Russia  will  employ  a  variety  of  aggressive
tactics  to  bolster  its  standing  as  a  great  power,  weaken  the  United  States,  and
undermine  Euro-Atlantic  unity;  and  that  Russia  will  use  a  range  of  relatively  low-cost
tools to advance its foreign policy objectives, including influence campaigns, economic
coercion, cyber operations, and measured military force. The ODNI also assessed that
President Putin will likely increase his use of repression and intimidation to contend with
domestic discontent over corruption, poor social services, and a sluggish economy; he
will continue to manipulate the media and is likely to expand the Russian government’s
legal basis for repression; and during 2018, Russia will continue to modernize, develop,
and field a wide range of advanced nuclear, conventional, and asymmetric capabilities
to  balance  its  perception  of  a  strategic  military  inferiority  vis-a-vis  the  United  States.
Russia will also seek to maintain, and where possible, expand its influence through the
former Soviet countries that it asserts are in its self-described sphere of influence.
The  ODNI  has  reported  that  areas  of  highest  interest  to  foreign  intelligence
collectors
technology;
include  energy/alternative  energy;  biotechnology;  defense
environmental protection; high-end manufacturing; and information and communications
technology.  In  March  2017,  the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  indicted  two  Russian
Federal  Security  Service  officials  and  their  Russian  cybercriminal  conspirators  on
computer hacking and conspiracy charges related to the collection of emails of U.S. and
European  employees  of  transportation  and  financial  services  firms.  The  charges
included conspiring to engage in economic espionage and theft of trade secrets.
The  ODNI  has  also  reported  that  Russian  efforts  to  influence  the  2016  U.S.
presidential  election  represent  the  most  recent  expression  of  Russia’s  long-standing
desire to undermine the U.S.-led liberal democratic order and noted that “these activities
demonstrated a significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort
compared  to  previous  operations.”  The  2016  influence  campaign  reflected  Russia’s
recognition of the worldwide effects that mass disclosure of U.S. Government and other
private  data  have  achieved  in  recent  years.  The  ODNI  assessed  that  Russian
intelligence services will continue to develop capabilities to provide President Putin with
options to use against the United States.
The  U.S.  Department  of  State  Travel  Advisory  for  Russia  is  Level  2  -  Exercise
Increased Caution, due to terrorism, harassment, and the arbitrary enforcement of local
laws.  The  advisory  directs  U.S.  citizens  not  to  travel  to  the  North  Caucasus,  including
Chechnya  and  Mount  Elbrus,  due  to  terrorism  and  civil  unrest;  or  to  Crimea  due  to
Russia’s occupation  of  the  Ukrainian  territory  and  abuses  by  its  occupying  authorities.
Terrorist  groups  continue plotting  possible attacks  in  Russia, and may  attack  with  little
or  no  warning.  U.S.  citizens  have  been  arbitrarily  interrogated  or  detained  by  Russian
officials  and  may  become  victims  of  harassment,  mistreatment,  and  extortion.  Due  to
the Russian government-imposed reduction on U.S. diplomatic personnel in Russia, the
U.S. Government has reduced ability to provide services to U.S. citizens.
The Department of State has assessed Moscow as being a high-threat location
for terrorist activity directed at or affecting official U.S. Government interests. Although
Russia  continued  to  prioritize  counterterrorism  efforts  in  2017,  it  remained  a  target  of
international terrorist groups, particularly ISIS.
Russia has attempted to reassert its dominance in, and integration of, the former
Soviet  states  and  has  generally  been  successful  with  Belarus  and  Armenia.  It  has
remained  unwelcomingly  active  in  the  internal  affairs  of  several  of  its  neighboring
countries—former republics of the Soviet Union or occupied “independent countries”—
such  as  Georgia,  Ukraine,  Azerbaijan,  and  Moldova,  and  has  issued  threats  against
Poland  (a  member  of  the  North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organization  (NATO)  since  1999),  the
Czech  Republic  (a  member  of  NATO  since  1999),  and  Estonia  (a  member  of  NATO
since 2004). Russia maintains an extensive military presence in Crimea and is likely to
take  further military  actions  in  Crimea  as  part  of  its  occupation  of  this  part  of  Ukraine.
The  international  community,  including  the  United  States  and  Ukraine,  does  not
recognize Russia’s purported annexation of Crimea. In response to Russia’s violations
of  Ukraine’s  sovereignty,  and  other  acts,  the  United  States  suspended  most  bilateral
engagement with the Russian government on economic issues. Anti-American and anti-
Western rhetoric is widespread in both official media sources and on social media.
In its 2017 Human Rights Report, the Department of State reported that Russia’s
occupation  and  purported  annexation  of  Ukraine’s  Crimean  Peninsula  continued  to
affect  the  human  rights  situation  in  Russia  significantly  and  negatively.  Credible
observers  attributed  thousands  of  civilian  deaths  and  injuries,  as  well  as  widespread
abuses,  to  Russian-led  forces  in  Ukraine’s  Donbas  region  and  to  Russian  occupation
authorities  in  Crimea.  Human  rights  groups  asserted  that  numerous  Ukrainian  citizens
remained in Russia as political prisoners.
The most significant human rights issues in Russia included extrajudicial killings;
enforced  disappearance;  torture  that  was  systematic  and  sometimes  resulted  in  death
and  sometimes  included  punitive  psychiatric  incarceration;  harsh  and  life-threatening
conditions  in  prisons;  arbitrary  arrest  and  detention;  lack  of  judicial  independence;
political  prisoners;  severe  interference  with  privacy;  severe  restrictions  on  freedom  of
expression  and  the  media;  increasingly  severe  restriction  on  freedom  of  association,
including  laws  on  “foreign  agents”  and  “undesirable  foreign  organizations;”  and
widespread corruption at all levels and in all branches of government. The government
failed  to  take  adequate  steps  to  prosecute  or  punish  most  officials  who  committed
abuses, resulting in a climate of impunity.
Cybercrime  is  also  a  significant  problem  across  Russia.  The  risk  of  infection,
compromise,  and  theft  via  malware,  spam  email,  sophisticated  spear  phishing,  and
social engineering attacks is significant. Telephone and electronic communications are
subject  to  surveillance  at  any  time  without  advisory.  The  Russian  System  for
Operational-Investigative Activities permits authorities to monitor and record all data that
traverses Russia’s networks.

Financial Considerations
The  SOR  alleges  in  ¶  2.a  that  Applicant  had  a  gambling  addiction  beginning  in
about  2012.  The  SOR  alleges  in  ¶¶  2.b  through  2.g  that  Applicant  borrowed  funds  in
various  amounts  from  friends  under  false  pretenses  to  support  his  gambling  habit,  and
he did not repay the debts as follows: in 2014, $200 (¶ 2.b); in November 2014, $3,000
to  $7,000  (¶  2.c);  in  December  2014,  $1,700  (¶  2.d);  in  May  2015,  $300  (¶  2.e);  in
October  2015,  $1,100  (¶  2.f);  and  in  November  2015,  $300  (¶  2.g).  In  2012,  he  had
saved  about  $50,000.  (Tr.  61)  By  mid-2014,  he  had  lost  all  of  his  savings  through
gambling. (Tr. 62) When he was in Afghanistan in 2014, he lost about $15,000 gambling.
(Tr.  62,  86-87)  Between  March 2014, and  June 2016, he  lost  about  $60,000  gambling.
(Tr. 63) In total, he lost about $125,000 gambling. He borrowed about $10,000 from six
friends who live in the United States as listed in SOR ¶¶ 2.b to 2.g to use for gambling.
(Tr. 64-65)
Applicant paid the friend in SOR ¶ 2.c $5,200; however, his friend said Applicant
still owes $1,512. (Tr. 67) He said he paid the debt in SOR ¶ 2.b, and he did not have
contact  information for  the  creditors  in  SOR  ¶¶ 2.e and 2.g.  (SOR  response) He  either
paid  or  offered  to  repay  the  friend  in  SOR  ¶  2.d.  (Tr.  65)  He  has  been  attempting  to
contact  some friends  to  whom  he owes  $200  or  $300, and he  is willing  to  repay  them.
(Tr. 68)
SOR  ¶  2.h  alleges  in  about  2014  to  2015,  Applicant  initiated  electronic  fund
transfers to a credit card, even though he knew he did not have the funds to cover the
transfers in his account. He then used his credit card for cash advances to enable him to
gamble. (Tr. 69-71; SOR response)
SOR  ¶¶  2.i,  2.j,  and  2.k  allege  three  delinquent  debts  as  follows:  a  charged-off
debt  owed  to  a  bank  for  $19,382  (¶  2.i);  a  debt  placed  for  collection  for $2,515  (¶  2.j);
and a debt placed for collection for $617 (2.k).
For  the  debt  in  SOR  ¶  2.i,  he  borrowed  $12,500  and  used  the  funds  to  gamble.
(Tr. 69-72) In 2016, he made three payments totaling about $750. He wanted to offer to
increase  his  payments.  However,  he  was  unable  to  make  the  payment  arrangements
with the creditor, and he stopped making payments. (Tr. 70, 77-78)
For the debt in SOR ¶ 2.j, he borrowed $1,500. He used the funds he borrowed to
make a payment to address a debt owed to a friend, and he provided some money to his
family  in  Afghanistan.  (Tr.  79)  He  recently  offered  to pay  the  creditor  $1,500;  however,
the  creditor  wanted  $2,500.  (Tr.  79)  He  is  willing  to  settle  the  debt;  however,  he  was
unable to arrange a settlement that was fair. (Tr. 79-80)
For the debt in SOR ¶ 2.k, he borrowed $300, and he used the funds to pay for
groceries and gasoline in 2015 or 2016. (Tr. 80) He was willing to pay the creditor $300;
however, the creditor wanted $600. (Tr. 80) He is willing to settle the debt; however, he
was  unable  to  arrange  a  settlement.  (Tr.  80-81)  Several months  before his  hearing,  he
consulted  a  debt  settlement  company;  however,  he  did  not  agree  to  start  the  program.
(Tr. 84-85)
In  June  2016,  Applicant  told  an  Officer  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)
investigator  that  he  stopped  gambling.  (Tr.  73)  In  December  2017,  he  told  an  OPM
investigator  that  he  gambled  after  June  2016.  (Tr.  73)  After  June  2016,  he  said  he
gambled about six times. (Tr. 73) Since 2016, he has lost more than $10,000 gambling.
(Tr.  74)  He  said  he  is  trying  to  control  his  gambling.  (Tr.  74)  He  has  reduced  his
gambling from two or three times a week to about once a month or less. (Tr. 75, 83) He
continues to have  brief  urges  to  gamble;  however,  he  is able  to  resist  these  urges  and
not gamble. (Tr. 75) He has watched some documentaries and Internet presentations on
gambling  addiction;  however,  he  has  never  received  gambling-addiction  counseling  or
therapy. (Tr. 83)
Applicant  has  little  savings  and  lives  month-to-month  on  his  salary.  (Tr.  82)  In
2015, he received a federal income tax refund, and he used half for gambling and sent
the  remainder  to  his family  in  Afghanistan.  His  employer  owes  Applicant about  $8,000,
and Applicant expects to be paid soon. (Tr. 82)
Character Evidence
Applicant  served  with  the  U.S.  Army  and  Marines  on  combat  patrols  in
Afghanistan. (Tr. 87; AE A) He received multiple certificates of appreciation and training
and letters of support for his service as a linguist in Afghanistan and the United States.
(AE A) Letters and certificates lauded his outstanding performance of duty and support
of  U.S.  Forces

Afghanistan
Afghanistan  is  a  country  in  Southwestern  Asia  that  is  approximately  the  size  of
Texas  (249,935  square  miles).  Pakistan  borders  it  on  the  east  and  the  south.  Iran
borders it on the west and Russia to the north. It is a rugged and mountainous country
which  has  been fought  over  by  powerful  nations for  centuries.  In  2009,  the  population
was  about  28  million  people  with  about  3  million  Afghans  living  outside  Afghanistan,
mainly in Pakistan and Iran, although over 5 million have returned since the removal of
the Taliban regime.
Afghanistan  is  presently  an  Islamic  Republic  with  a  democratically-elected
president. Afghanistan has had a turbulent political history, including an invasion by the
Soviet  Union  in  1979.  After  an  accord  was  reached  in  1989,  and  the  Soviet  Union
withdrew  from  Afghanistan,  fighting  continued  among  the  various  ethnic,  clan,  and
religious militias. By the end of 1998, the Taliban rose to power and controlled 90% of
the country, imposing aggressive and repressive policies.
In October 2001, U.S. forces and coalition partners led military operations in the
country,  forcing  the  Taliban  out  of  power  by  November  2001.  The  coalition  sought  to
oust  al-Qaeda,  Osama  bin  Laden,  and  other  terrorists  seeking  to  attack  the  United
States  from  Afghanistan. The  new  democratic  government  took  power  in  2004  after  a
popular election.
A  U.S.  State  Department  Travel  Advisory  remains  in  effect  for  Afghanistan  at
Travel  Advisory  Level  4-Do  not  travel.  The  State  Department  warns  U.S.  citizens
against  travel  to  Afghanistan  because  of  continued  instability  and  threats  by  terrorist
organizations  against  U.S.  citizens.  Travel  to  all  areas  of  Afghanistan  remains  unsafe
due  to  the  ongoing  risk  of  kidnapping,  hostage-taking,  suicide  bombings,  military
combat  operations,  landmines,  terrorist  and  insurgent  attacks,  banditry,  armed  rivalry
between  political  and  tribal  groups,  militant  attacks,  direct  and  indirect  fire,  and
insurgent attacks, including attacks using vehicle-borne or other IEDs. Attacks may also
target  official  Afghan  and  U.S.  governmental  convoys  and  compounds,  foreign
embassies, military installations, and other public areas.
No  province  in  Afghanistan  is  immune  from  violence,  and  the  potential  exists
throughout the country for hostile acts, either targeted or random, against United States
and  other  foreign  nationals  at  any  time.  Extremists  associated  with  various  terrorist
networks  and  members  of  other  armed  opposition  groups  are  active  throughout  the
country and remain violently opposed to the Afghan government and Coalition Forces.
These  terrorist  groups  have  attacked  Afghan,  Coalition  Forces,  and  U.S.  targets  with
little regard for or the express intent to cause civilian casualties.
According to the June 2017 U.S. Department of Defense report on Afghanistan,
Afghanistan  faces  a  continuing  threat  from  insurgent  and  terrorist  networks  present  or
operating  in  the  Afghanistan-Pakistan  region.  Department  Counsel’s  administrative
notice lists recent terrorist attacks in Afghanistan resulting in the deaths of hundreds of
civilians and military personnel in 2017 and 2018. Although al-Qaeda’s core leadership
in  the  Afghanistan-Pakistan  border  region  has  been  degraded,  elements  continue  to
seek safe haven on both sides of the border to regenerate and conduct attack planning.
The United States’ extraordinary commitment to Afghanistan is balanced against
the inherent dangers of the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan to its citizens and residents
and Afghan government problems developing and complying with the rule of law. A top
national  security  goal  of  the  United  States  is  to  establish  relationships,  cooperation,
training,  and  support  of  the  Afghanistan  Government  and  military  in  the  ongoing  war
against terrorism.

"Applicant  is  56  years  old.  He  is  married  with  one  son.  He  has  a  Bachelor’s
degree  in  Engineering.    He  is  employed  with  a  defense  contractor  as  a  Senior
Manufacturing Engineer.  He is seeking to retain a security clearance in connection with
his employment.
Guideline B – Foreign Influence
Applicant  was  born  in  China  in  1962.    He  grew  up  and  completed  elementary
school,  before  he  and  his  family  moved  to  Hong  Kong  in  1975.    He  completed  high
school in Hong Kong, and in the summer of 1986, he came to the United States.  During
his  month  long  visit  as  a  tourist,  he  was  so  impressed  by  the  amicable  people,  the
harmony of society, and the diversity of cultures, that he decided to pursue his college
education here.  He applied and was admitted to a University in 1987.  He obtained his
Bachelor’s of Science degree in Engineering in 1990.  (Applicant’s Exhibit D.)  While in
college here, Applicant met his wife, and got married in 1989.  They have one son who
is  18  years  old,  currently  attending  college,  and  studying  engineering.    Applicant
became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1994.  (Tr. p. 22.)  Over the years,
he  has  established  wealth,  purchased  a  house,  and  has  a  retirement  account  and  a
number of investments in the United States.  (Applicant’s Exhibits J and K.)
Applicant has worked for a number of employers over the years.  In March 2006,
he was offered a position with a defense contractor, and granted a security clearance in
September  2006.    Applicant  worked  there  for  ten  years  while  holding  a  security
clearance without incident.  During that time, Applicant received foreign travel briefings
and  understands  the  responsibilities  involved  with  possessing  a  security  clearance.
(Applicant’s  Exhibit  H.)    In  January  2016,  Applicant  was  highly  recommended  for  a
position  with  another  defense  contractor  by  a  longtime  colleague  of  the  company.
Applicant was subsequently  hired, and has been working  for the new company for the
past three years.
Applicant has family that are citizens and residents of Hong Kong that include his
mother,  three  brothers,  and  two  sisters.    Applicant’s  mother  has  always  been  a
housewife.  She is not affiliated in any way  with  the Government of Hong Kong or the
People’s Republic of China.  Applicant communicates with  his mother about her heath
and  his  son  about  once  a  month.    They  usually  speak  about  twenty  minutes.    She
knows that Applicant is an engineer, but nothing more.  Applicant’s mother last traveled
to the United States to visit the Applicant in 2007.  (Tr. p. 26.)  Applicant last traveled to
visit  his  mother  in  Hong  Kong  in  2013.    (Tr.  p.  27.)    While  traveling  to  Hong  Kong,
Applicant has always used his United States Passport.  (Applicant’s Exhibit C, and Tr. p.
37.)  Applicant has no future intentions to travel to Hong Kong.
Applicant  has  three  brothers  who  are  citizens  of  and  residents  of  Hong  Kong.
One of Applicant’s brother’s is a citizen of Britain, and resides in Hong Kong.  He is self-
employed as an interior designer.  (Tr. p. 29.)  He has never held a job or position with
any  foreign  Government.    The  other  two  brothers  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Hong
Kong.  One of Applicant’s brothers is a banker, for a private bank.  The other brother is
retired, and lives with their mother.  Prior to his retirement, he worked for a commercial
trading company, and is not affiliated, nor has ever been affiliated, in any way with the
any  foreign  Government.    Applicant  communicates  with  each  of  his  brothers  not  more
than two to three times a year.
Applicant also has two sisters who are citizens and residents of Hong Kong.  One
is  a  travel  agent,  the  other  is  retired.    They  are  both  married.    One  of  his  sister’s
husbands  is  a  retired  shoe  salesman,  and  the  other  sister’s  husband  is  a  private
security  guard.    Neither  husband  has  ever  had  any  affiliation  with  the  Hong  Kong  or
Chinese Government.
Applicant’s  father  is  an  American  citizen  who  resides  in  the  United  States.    He
and Applicant’s mother are still married.   Applicant’s mother prefers to live with one of
her sons in Hong Kong than with her husband in the United States.  (Tr. p. 43.)
Applicant credibly testified that he cannot be coerced into divulging any national
security  secrets.      He  also  believes  that  his  limited  relationships  with  any  his  family
members  in  Hong  Kong  cannot  be  used  to  threaten  him  to  do  anything  against  the
interests  of  the  United  States.    (Tr.  p.  38.)    Applicant  has  never  been  approached,
confronted,  or  contacted  by  any  foreign  entity  attempting  to  obtain  protected
information.  In the event that this ever occurs, Applicant stated that he will immediately
contact the DoD security officer and report the incident.  (Tr. p. 46.)
Applicant prepared a notarized Statement of Intent dated October 1, 2018, which
indicates  that  he  will  continue  to  have  minimal  or  no  foreign  contacts  outside  of  his
official  duties,  and  his  family,  and  any  conversations  will  remain  strictly  casual  and
infrequent.    Any  future  communication  with  foreign  contacts,  (other  than  described
above) is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.  (Government Exhibit E.)
Performance evaluations of the Applicant during his prior employment and in his
current positon reflect favorable ratings.  (Applicant’s Exhibit I.)  Applicant has received
a number of Certificates and Awards for accomplishments.  (Applicant’s Exhibit L.)
Letters  of  recommendation  from  professional  colleagues  of  the  Applicant,
including  his  direct  supervisor,  collectively  attest  to  his  dedication  and  commitment  to
the job, and he is described as one who excels in a fast paced potentially high stress,
changing  environment,  with  an  excellent  ability  to  interface  with  multiply  stakeholders,
works effectively in teams, and communicates with positive impact.  His excellent work
product,  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and  good  judgment  is  recognized  by  many.    He  is
considered  a  role  model  for  integrity  and  honesty  and  is  highly  recommended  for  a
security clearance.  (Applicant’s Exhibit G.)
Notice
foreign
technical
information  by
I  have  taken  administrative  notice  of  the  following  information  concerning  the
People’s Republic  of China  (China).     Targeting  and  collection  of  US  political, military,
economic,  and
intelligence  services  continues
unabated.  China is one of the most aggressive collectors of U.S. economic information
and technology.  China’s intelligence services, as well as private companies and other
entities, frequently seek to exploit Chinese citizens or persons with family ties to China
who can use their insider access to corporate networks to steal secrets using removable
media  devices  or  e-mail.    Chinese  actors  are  the  world’s  most  active  and  persistent
perpetrators  of  economic  espionage.    Chinese  attempts  to  collect  U.S.  technological
and economic information will continue at a high level and will represent a growing and
persistent threat to U.S. economic security.   The nature of the cyber threat will evolve
with continuing technological advances in the global information environment.  (HE I)
I  have  also  taken  administrative  notice  of  the  following  information  concerning
Hong Kong.  Hong Kong is a presidential limited democracy and special administrative
region of the People’s Republic of China with a population of over 7 million people.  As
a special administrative region, its foreign relations and defense are the responsibility of
China.   However, Hong Kong is a customs territory and economic entity separate from
China  and  is  able  to  enter  into  international  agreements  on  its  own  behalf  in
commercial,  economic,  and  certain  legal  matters.    The  United  States  and  Hong  Kong
have  enjoyed  a  robust  relationship,  as  stated  in  the  U.S.  –  Hong  Kong  Policy  Act  of
1992  and  grounded  in  the  determination  to  promote  Hong  Kong’s  prosperity,  freedom
and  way  of  life.    The  United  States  enjoys  substantial  economic  ties  with  Hong  Kong
and  U.S.  companies  generally  have  a  favorable  view  of  Hong  Kong’s  business
environment.    Hong  Kong  is  an  independent  body  from  China,  participates  as  a  full
member  of  several  international  economic  organizations  such  as  The  World  Trade
Organization,  Asian  Pacific  Economic  Cooperation  Forum  and  Financial  Action  Task
Force.      The  Government  of  Hong  Kong  generally  respects  human  rights  of  residents
and the law and judiciary generally provide an effective means of dealing with individual
instances  of  abuse.    The  basic  law  in  Hong  Kong  provides  for  the  protection  against
human  rights  abuses.    There  is  freedom  of  speech,  of  the  press,  and  of  publication.
Additionally,  Hong  Kong’s  basic  law  protects  the  citizen’s  freedom  of  expression,
freedom  of  peaceful  assembly,  freedom  of  religion,  and  freedom  of  movement.    Hong
Kong has also passed laws to combat discrimination and is clearly committed to liberty,
justice, and fair treatment, of their citizens through an effective government framework.
Hong  Kong  is  a  global  partner  to  the  United  States  and  shares  much  of  the  same
human rights and economic views.  There are more than 1,300 U.S. firms in Hong Kong
and approximately 85,000 American residents in Hong Kong.   (Applicant’s Exhibit M.)
",True
"Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  allegations  but  SOR  ¶  1.e,  which  he  denied.  His
admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. He is a 34-year-old, native-born U.S.
citizen.  He  is  married  and  expecting  his  first  child  in  late  2019.  He  has  owned  his
condominium in the United States since September 2015. (Tr. at 15, 21-22, 52; GE 1).
Applicant graduated from high school in 2003. He earned a bachelor’s degree in
2007.  He  has  worked  for  various  DOD  contractors  since  approximately  2013.  He
worked as a managerial data analyst since July 2016. He was granted access to public
trust information in approximately 2008. He has never had a security clearance. (Tr. at
5-6, 8-9, 14-17, 69-70; GE 1).
Applicant’s  wife  is  a  Russian-born  citizen,  residing  with  Applicant  in  the  United
States (SOR ¶ 1.a). She is 33 years old. They met at a restaurant in December 2013,
where  he  was  celebrating  a  friend’s  birthday  and  she  was  a  customer.  She  arrived  in
the United States on a student visa approximately three months earlier, to study English
to  advance  her  career  as  a  travel  agent  in  Russia.  He  testified  that  she  had  never
worked  for  the  Russian  government  or  military.  They  married  in  March  2014  and
Applicant has  since  sponsored  her  to  obtain  U.S.  citizenship.  (Tr.  at  15-16,  23-26,  45-
52, 59, 62; GE 1).
Applicant’s  wife  worked  as  a  Russian  language  teacher  for  an  American
language  education  company  for  approximately  two  years.  On  occasion,  she  also
worked  at  hotels.  She  attended  several  semesters  of  community  college  between
approximately  2016  and  2018  to  enhance  her  English  skills,  which  have  served  as  a
barrier for her employment. Though she speaks English fluently, she has “a very strong
accent.”  Applicant  testified  that  “she  doesn’t  have  a  regular  job”  and  last  worked  in
October  2018,  and  he  is  the  primary  breadwinner.  She  is  aware  that  Applicant  is
seeking a security clearance. He testified that he is confident that she has not told her
family in Russia of such. (Tr. at 15-16, 23-26, 45-52, 59, 62; GE 1).
Applicant’s  mother-in-law  and  grandmother-in-law  are  citizens  and  residents  of
Russia (SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.d). His mother-in-law is a 58-year-old retired state laborer. She
receives  a  pension  from  the  Russian  government  of  approximately  $200  monthly.  He
and his wife give her approximately $500 yearly. She owns her apartment in Russia, the
value of which Applicant testified was approximately $15,000 USD, and his wife stands
to inherit it. Applicant and his wife visited her once yearly from 2016 to 2018 during the
holidays, and they also Skype with her approximately once weekly. (Tr. at 15-17, 26-35,
54-63, 69; GE 1).
Applicant’s grandmother-in-law is 72 years old. Applicant testified that he and his
wife  Skype  with  her  quarterly.  They  also  see  her  when  they  visit  Russia.  Applicant’s
grandfather-in-law  is  also  a  citizen  and  resident  of  Russia.  He  is  elderly  and  “sleeps
pretty  much  the  entire  time.”  He  performed  mandatory  service  in  the  Russian  military.
Both  are  retired  state  laborers.  His  grandmother-in-law  receives  a  pension  from  the
Russian government of approximately $300 monthly. Applicant testified that none of his
wife’s family in Russia are aware that he is seeking a security clearance, and are only
aware that he works with computers. (Tr. at 15-17, 26-35, 54-63, 69; GE 1).
Applicant’s  wife  has  a  bank  account  in  Russia  (SOR  ¶  1.b).  Applicant  testified
that  his  wife  has  had  this  interest-bearing  account  “like  a  CD”  since  2016.  She
transferred this money from a previous bank account she had in Russia after that bank
failed.  His  wife  can  access  the  money  in  her  account  a  certain  number  of  times
throughout  the  year,  and  she  has  done  so  to  help  her  mother.  Its  balance  is
approximately $8,500 USD. He testified that it has been more convenient for his wife to
leave this money in Russia and let it continue to accrue interest, but now that they are
expecting a child they will likely bring it over to the United States. (Tr. at 35-39, 63-64;
GE 1).
Applicant testified that neither he nor his wife have any other financial interests in
Russia. Applicant purchased his condominium in the United States, in his name only, in
2015 for $151,000. Its value as of the date of the hearing was $190,000. He has a total
of approximately $123,000 in his 401k retirement account and individual bank account.
His wife has approximately $10,000 in her individual U.S. bank account. They also own
a car. (Tr. at 52-54; GE 1).
Within  a  year  of  getting  married,  Applicant  took  an  intensive  week  and  a  half
Russian language course at a Russian entity in Washington, D.C. He wanted “to better
bond with my wife” and have conversations with his mother-in-law without the need for a
translator.  He  then  took  15  to  20  private  lessons  over  the  course  of  one  year.  His
teacher  and  tutor  was  an  individual  whom  he  “thought  .  .  .  was  just  a  teacher”  at  the
time and later became a Russian official. He testified that he did not learn the individual
was a Russian official until later. He also interacted with the Russian official at a party at
the Russian Embassy in Washington, D.C., to which he and his wife were invited since
he was a student of the Russian entity. (SOR ¶ 1.e). (Tr. at 16, 21-22, 39-45, 64-68; GE
1).
Applicant testified that he and his wife attended poetry readings, musical recitals,
and  other  cultural  events  at  the  Russian  Embassy,  through  the  Russian  Orthodox
Church and a cultural entity, three to four times per year. He testified that at times, he
and his wife attended such events together or separately, but one not more frequently
than the other. He testified that he last attended such an event at the Russian Embassy
in early 2018 and his wife last did so that summer. He testified that he does not maintain
regular  contact  with  the  above-mentioned  Russian  official,  other  than  an  occasional
email inviting him and his wife to such events. He testified that he was unaware whether
the individual was still a Russian official, but believed the individual still worked for the
Russian entity. (SOR ¶ 1.e). (Tr. at 16, 21-22, 39-45, 64-68; GE 1).
Applicant  testified  that  he  incidentally  met  a  former  Russian  official  at  such  a
cultural  event.  He  described  their  contact  as  a  “handshake”  and  he  did  not  have  any
private conversation with this individual. He testified that he did not learn until later that
this individual was expelled from the United States in 2018 for being an alleged Russian
spy. He describes the contacts he has made through the Russian entity cultural events
as  “casual”  and  “clearly  incidental,  not  sought  out  by  me  and  aren’t  continuing.”  He
testified that none of these contacts are aware that he is seeking a security clearance,
though he knew that background investigators may have contacted the Russian official
who was his language teacher and tutor as he listed this individual as a foreign contact
on his security clearance application.  (SOR ¶ 1.e). (Tr. at 16, 21-22, 39-45, 64-68; GE
1).
Applicant  testified  that  neither  he  nor  his  wife  and  her  family  have  been
approached  by  any  Russian  authorities  seeking  information  about  what  he  does  for  a
living.  He  would  report  any  such  attempt  to  the  FBI  and  his  Facility  Security  Officer
(FSO).  He  has  undergone  security  training  at  work  every  six  months  for  the  past  two
years and annual security training with previous employers since 2010. He testified that
he has received favorable performance evaluations by his employer.  (Tr. at 58-63, 70-
71).
Russia
In  2018,  the  Office  of  the  Director  of  National  Intelligence  (ODNI)  identified
Russia  as  one  of  the  three  most  capable  and  active  cyber  actors  tied  to  economic
espionage and the potential theft of U.S. trade secrets and proprietary information. The
ODNI  assessed  that  Russia  will:  employ  a  variety  of  aggressive  tactics  to  bolster  its
standing  as  a  great  power,  weaken  the  United  States,  and  undermine  Euro-Atlantic
unity;  use  a  range  of  relatively  low-cost  tools  to  advance  its  foreign  policy  objectives,
including  influence  campaigns,  economic  coercion,  cyber  operations,  and  measured
military force; and continue to modernize, develop, and field a wide range of advanced
nuclear,  conventional,  and  asymmetric  capabilities  to  balance  its  perception  of  a
strategic  military  inferiority  vis-à-vis  the  United  States.  The  ODNI  also  assessed  that
president  Vladimir  Putin  will  likely  increase  his  use  of  repression  and  intimidation  to
contend with domestic discontent over corruption, poor social services, and a sluggish
economy  and  continue  to  manipulate  the  media  and  is  likely  to  expand  the  Russian
government’s legal basis for repression.
The  ODNI  has  reported  that  Russian  efforts  to  influence  the  2016  U.S.
presidential  election  represent  the  most  recent  expression  of  Russia’s  long-standing
desire to undermine the U.S.-led liberal democratic order. It noted that “these activities
demonstrated a significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort
compared  to  previous  operations.  It  assessed  that  Russian  intelligence  services  will
continue  to  develop  its  capabilities  to  provide  Putin  with  options  to  use  against  the
United States.
The  2018  U.S.  Department  of  State  (DOS)  travel  advisory  for  Russia  advised
U.S.  citizens  to  reconsider  travel  due  to  terrorism  and  harassment.  U.S.  citizens  are
often victims of harassment, mistreatment, and extortion by law enforcement and other
officials.  In  2017,  the  DOS  reported  that  the  most  significant  human  rights  abuses  in
Russia  included  extrajudicial  killings;  enforced  disappearance;  torture  that  was
systematic  and  sometimes  resulted
included  punitive  psychiatric
incarceration;  harsh  and  life-threatening  conditions  in  prisons;  arbitrary  arrest  and
detention;  lack  of  judicial  independence;  political  prisoners;  severe  interference  with
privacy;  severe  restrictions  on  freedom  of  expression  and  the  media;  increasingly
severe  restriction  on  freedom  of  association,  including  laws  on  foreign  agents  and
undesirable  foreign  organizations;  and  widespread  corruption  at  all  levels  and  in  all
branches  of  government.  The  Russian  government  failed  to  take  adequate  steps  to
prosecute  or  punish  most  officials  who  committed  abuses,  resulting  in  a  climate  of
impunity.

Cybercrime is a significant problem in Russia. The risk of infection, compromise,
and theft via malware, spam email, sophisticated spear phishing, and social engineering
attacks  are  significant.  Telephone  and  electronic  communications  are  subject  to
surveillance  at  any  time  without  advisory.  The  Russian  system  for  operational-
investigative  activities  permits  authorities  to  monitor  and  record  all  data  that  traverses
Russia’s networks.

"Applicant  admitted,  with  explanations,  the  five  allegations  in  the  SOR.  I  have
incorporated  his  admissions  in  my  findings  of  fact.  Applicant’s  personal  information  is
extracted from GE 1, his SCA, unless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to
the record. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, the hearing testimony,
and the documentary evidence, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant was born in Iraq in 1973 and is presently 46 years old. He and his wife
were  married  in  Iraq  in  1997.  They  and  two  of  their  three  children  entered  the  United
States in 2009. Applicant entered the United States as a refugee at the age of 35. In 2011,
he and his wife had a third child, who was born in the United States. Applicant became a
naturalized  U.S.  citizen  in  2014.  His  wife  and  two  oldest  children  have  also  become
naturalized U.S. citizens. (Tr. 14-15; GE 2 at 2; GE 3 at 32.)
In 1996, Applicant received an engineering degree in Iraq. For a little less than two
years ending in 2005, Applicant’s Iraqi engineering company worked with the U.S. Army
under a contract. Through his company, he performed services on several infrastructure
projects, such as potable water, sewer systems, storm drains and road paving. In 2005,
he received two anonymous threats by phone from a terrorist organization telling him to
stop working for the United States. He then received an even more threatening warning
and decided that his life was at risk. After living in Iraq for the first 30 years of his life, he
took his family to Egypt, where they lived until 2009. During that period, he returned to
Iraq  on  several  occasions.  He  was  unable  to  work  in  Egypt  because  he  was  not  an
Egyptian citizen. He learned about an organization that assists refugees to relocate to the
United States. In 2009, he successfully sought refuge in this country. (Tr. 7, 30; GE 2 at
2; AE A.)
Once in the United States, Applicant purchased a gas station and operated it for
about  three  years.  He  purchased  a  home  in  2014  after  he  sold  the  gas  station.  He
subsequently bought a less expensive home where he and his family presently reside.
(Tr. 16-17.)
Applicant’s parents and two siblings also immigrated to the United States with him
in 2009 and became U.S. citizens. Applicant’s father worked in the Iraqi Ministry of Trade
as an accounting manager before he immigrated to the United States. Applicant’s mother
is and always has been a housewife. Left behind in Iraq is one brother and his wife (SOR
¶  1.a),  his  wife’s  mother  (SOR  ¶  1.b),  sister  (SOR  ¶  1.c)  and  brother  (SOR  ¶  1.d).
Applicant’s father-in-law died in 2000. He was a lawyer in the Iraqi Ministry of Finance.
(Tr. 29; GE 3 at 26, 31, 33, 37.)
Applicant has weekly contact by phone with his brother, who lives in Baghdad. In
his  SCA,  Applicant  reported  that  his  brother  rents  cars  for  an  Iraqi  company.  At  the
hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  this  brother  is  a  civil  engineer  like  himself.  Applicant’s
contact with his brother’s wife, who is a housewife, is limited to monthly calls. Applicant’s
mother-in-law is a retired elementary school teacher, who worked for the Iraqi Ministry of
Education. He has weekly contact with her by phone. Applicant’s sister-in-law works for
a foreign airline in Iraq. In his SCA, Applicant also reported that he has weekly contact
with her by phone. He testified at the hearing that he only speaks with her every two or
three months. Applicant’s wife has a very close relationship with this sister. The brother
of Applicant’s wife works as a lawyer in the Law Department of the Iraqi Media Network,
a  government  agency.  According  to  his  SCA,  Applicant  has  weekly  contact  with  him,
though  Applicant’s  wife  speaks  with  her  brother  more  often.  At  the  hearing,  Applicant
testified that he only speaks with his brother-in-law every two or three months. Applicant
also visits each of these relatives when he travels to Iraq, which he has done in 2006 (two
times), 2007 (one time), 2008 (four times), 2009 (one time), 2015 (one time), and 2016
(one time). He did not travel to Iraq between 2009 and 2015 because of the requirements
to  obtain  U.S.  citizenship.  He  travels  on  his  Iraqi  passport  because  he  believes  it  is
dangerous to be identified as a U.S. citizen. He renewed his Iraqi passport when he was
in Iraq in 2016. (Tr. 19-20, 22-26; GE 2 at 4, 6-8; GE 3 at 16-23, 26, 31, 33, 37.)
The SOR also alleges that Applicant has a friend who is citizen and resident of
Egypt (SOR ¶ 1.e). Applicant met this foreign national while he was living in Egypt from
2005 to 2009. The friend is a “respectable businessman.” Applicant has traveled to Egypt
in 2014 (one time), 2015 (seven times), 2016 (two times), and 2017 (one time). In addition,
he  has  traveled  to  the  United  Arab  Emirates  on  five  occasions  during  the  2015-2017
period. He notes in his SCA that all of his travel to Egypt and Iraq was to “visit family or
friends,”  and  his  repeated  travel  to  the  United  Arab  Emirates  was  for  “tourism.”  (SOR
response at 1.)
Applicant owns his home, but he has exhausted his savings and has limited funds
and no retirement accounts. He has been unemployed since 2017. He has been offered
employment in Iraq as a linguist. He seeks a security clearance in connection with that
employment offer. (Tr. 8-9, 12, 18; GE 3 at 5.)
IRAQ
The U.S. Department of State warns that U.S. citizens in Iraq remain at high risk
for kidnapping and terrorist violence and advises them to avoid all travel to Iraq. The ability
of the U.S. Embassy to provide consular services to U.S. citizens outside of Baghdad is
extremely limited given the security environment. ISIS controls or is present, directly or
through affiliates, in portions of Iraq’s territory. Within areas under ISIS control, the Iraqi
government has little or no ability to control and ensure public safety.
Numerous terrorist and insurgent groups are active in Iraq, including ISIS. Such
groups regularly attack both Iraqi security forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias
may  also  threaten  U.S.  citizens  and  western  companies  throughout  Iraq.  U.S.
Government  and  western  interests  remain  possible  targets  for  attacks.  The  U.S.
Government  considers  the  potential  personal  security  threats  to  U.S.  Government
personnel  in  Iraq  to  be  serious  enough  to  require  them  to  live  and  work  under  strict
security guidelines.
There are significant human rights problems in Iraq to include: sectarian hostility,
widespread corruption, and the lack of transparency at all levels of the Iraqi government
and  society,  which  has  weakened  the  government’s  authority  and  worsened  effective
human rights protections. Iraqi security forces and members of the Federal Police have
committed human rights violations to include killing, kidnapping, and extorting civilians.
There are also problems that include harsh and life-threatening conditions in detention
and prison facilities, arbitrary arrest, lengthy pretrial detainment, denial of fair public trial,
limits on freedom of expression, freedom of the press, censorship of religion, limits on
peaceful assembly, and societal abuses of women. ISIS is also responsible for human
rights abuses.

"Applicant is 50 years old, and he was born in what is now South Sudan. In 1999,
Applicant and his wife fled Sudan and entered the United States. They were persecuted
by the Sudanese government due to their religion. Applicant and his wife were naturalized
in 2005. He has been married to his wife since 1999, and they have five children between
the ages of 8 and 18, all of whom were born in the United States. (Tr. 27-28, 101; GE 1;
GE 3 at 2, 8; AE H)
In 1995, Applicant received a college degree from a school in South Sudan, and
he  has  completed  some  college  courses  in  the  U.S.  Between  June  2006  and  January
2009, he served as a linguist in Iraq with the U.S. Army and the U.S. Marine Corps. During
this period, he was in Fallujah, Ramadi, and Baghdad, and subject to live fire. He was
granted  a  secret  security  clearance  in  2006,  and  he  received  a  top  secret,  sensitive-
compartmented information clearance in 2008. He is sponsored by a defense contractor
and requires a clearance for this position. (Tr. 17, 25-26, 30-35; GE 1; GE 3 at 2)
After Applicant returned to the United States  from Iraq in January 2009, he was
unemployed  for  eight  months.  He  was  then  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  from
August  2009  until  late  2011,  when  his  position  was  eliminated.  Applicant  struggled  to
regain  employment,  and  as  a  result,  in  the  spring  of  2009,  he  and  his  wife  started  a
trucking company. They owned a tractor-trailer truck, leased trailers, and hired operators
to drive their truck. They closed the business in 2012. (Tr. 17-18, 35-39; GE 1 at 18-21;
AE C)
In approximately May 2012, an individual filed a lawsuit against Applicant and his
company for $75,000. The plaintiff was supposed to buy Applicant’s truck, but the plaintiff
misplaced a trailer; as a result, Applicant cancelled the transfer of title for the truck. In
May 2019, the lawsuit against Applicant was dismissed. In June 2019, the lawsuit against
Applicant’s company was dismissed. At this time, there are no ongoing lawsuits against
Applicant or his company. (Tr. 37-39, 45-46; GE 1 at 71; GE 2 at 3; AE E; AE F; AE I)
After  Applicant  closed  his  trucking  company  in  2012,  he  was  unemployed  for
several months. To support his family, he moved to another state and drove a cab for
approximately one year. In 2014, Applicant and his wife opened a restaurant together.
Because  the  restaurant  was  not  doing  well,  Applicant  worked  for  other  businesses
between May 2017 and February 2018. At that time, they closed the restaurant because
it was not profitable. Applicant currently drives a supply truck and restocks gas stations
with vending supplies. His wife owns a cleaning business, and together they cater events
several times a year. (Tr. 41-44; GE 1 at 13-18; GE 2 at 2)
Due  to  Applicant’s  inability  to  find  consistent  employment  and  the  two  failed
business ventures, he fell behind on his mortgage payments. Applicant filed for Chapter
13  bankruptcy  protection  in  April  2016  to  avoid  foreclosure.  His  monthly  mortgage
payment  was  $1,500,  and  the  monthly  bankruptcy  payment  was  $1,000.  Because  his
restaurant was not doing well, he was unable to make the required bankruptcy payments,
and the bankruptcy was dismissed in November 2017. (Tr. 47-49, 97; GE 1 at 68-69; GE
2 at 3-4; GE 3 at 6; GE 4 at 4; GE 5 at 2; GE 7)
Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in October 2017, and the plan
was confirmed in March 2018. Since the confirmation of the bankruptcy plan, he has made
monthly payments of $3,800. His mortgage is included in the bankruptcy plan as well as
the credit card debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 2.c and 2.d. (Tr. 49-51, 54-56, 60; GE 4 at 4; GE
5 at 2; GE 8)
Applicant and his wife follow a written budget, and they attended a Dave Ramsey
credit-counseling  class  through  their  church.  They  also  received  credit  counseling  in
conjunction  with  their  bankruptcies.  They  have  no  outstanding  debts  related  to  their
former  businesses.  They  owe  no  new  outstanding  income  taxes  and  have  timely  filed
their income tax returns for the past several tax years. Applicant brought to the hearing a
$3,800  money  order  that  reflected  his  March  bankruptcy  payment.  After  the  hearing,
Applicant provided a spreadsheet reflecting the payments he made between March and
May 2019 to the bankruptcy plan. Although he did not provide documentation of all of the
payments he has made since March 2018, when the plan was confirmed, he and his wife
testified  credibly  that  he  has  been  making  the  required  monthly  payments.  The
government offered no evidence to rebut his claims, and the admitted credit reports do
not show any new unalleged debts. (Tr. 61, 97-100, 104; GE 4; GE 5; GE 6)
South Sudan
South Sudan became an independent presidential republic in July 2011, when it
gained  its  independence  from  Sudan.  Shortly  thereafter,  conflict  arose  between  the
government and opposition forces, and it is an ongoing issue. Additionally, there has been
border conflict between South Sudan and Sudan and South Sudan and Uganda. As a
result, over a million people have been displaced and tens of thousands were killed. Due
to  ongoing  armed  conflict,  crime,  human  rights  issues,  including  extrajudicial  killings,
abuse, rape, and abduction, the U.S. Government advises against travel to South Sudan.
South Sudan is not known for intelligence-collection efforts against the United States or
U.S. citizens.
The Government did not request that I take administrative notice of any facts or
issues related to Uganda. (Tr. 83)
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant’s  half-brother,  stepbrother,  and  brother-in-law
(sister’s husband) are citizens and residents of South Sudan, and they currently serve in
the South Sudanese Army. Applicant testified that all of these men are still citizens and
residents of South Sudan. He has not seen his half-brother since approximately 1997,
and the last time he spoke to him was in 2008. Applicant heard that his stepbrother is a
major in the South Sudan Army. Applicant met his stepbrother once when he was young
and was still living in Sudan, and he spoke to him once in 2005. Applicant’s brother-in-
law is also an officer in the South Sudan Army. Applicant saw him in 2007, when Applicant
visited  his  mother  in  Uganda,  but  he  does  not  communicate  with  his  brother-in-law.
Applicant does not know the positions, titles, or responsibilities of these relatives within
the South Sudan Army. (Tr. 62-68, 79; GE 3 at 3-4)
The SOR alleged that Applicant’s sisters-in-law are citizens and residents of South
Sudan, and they work for the South Sudan Ministry of Finance. Applicant testified that
both women fled South Sudan as a result of the conflict, and they now reside in Uganda.
Neither sister-in-law currently works for the South Sudan Ministry of Finance. (Tr. 67-68;
GE 3 at 3-4)
The SOR alleged that Applicant’s mother, sister, and sister-in-laws are citizens of
South  Sudan  who  reside  in  Uganda.  Applicant’s  mother  is  a  U.S.  legal-permanent
resident and previously resided with his family in the United States from 2008 until 2011.
Applicant has not seen her since 2011. They speak approximately once a month, and he
provides her with less than $1,000 a year in financial support. Since 2000, he has sent
her a total of approximately $15,000. He has no financial assets in South Sudan. (Tr. 68,
70-72, 82-83; GE 3 at 3-4; AE B)
The last time Applicant saw his sister was in 2007, when he went to Uganda for a
family gathering or reunion. She cares for their mother. (Tr. 73) The last time he saw his
sister-in-law was in the 1980s, and she is a homemaker. (Tr. 74)
The SOR alleged that Applicant’s father-in-law, mother-in-law, brothers-in-law, and
sisters-in-law are citizens and residents of South Sudan. Applicant’s mother-in-law and
father-in-law reside in the United States with one of their sons, who is a naturalized citizen.
They are in the process of obtaining their Green Cards. One sister-in-law and one brother-
in-law are residents of Australia. Three of his sisters-in-law are residents of Uganda, and
they are in the process of moving to Australia. One sister-in-law resides in India, and she
is in the process of moving to Australia. One sister-in-law resides in the United States.

During  his  Iraq  deployment,  Applicant  was  awarded  several  command  coins  to
signify the service he provided to various military commands. Additionally, he received a
letter of appreciation related to his service in Iraq. The Marine officer described Applicant
as  invaluable,  diligent,  responsible,  hardworking,  and  devoted  despite  the  duress  of
enemy  fire.  The  Marines  with  whom  Applicant  worked  relied  upon  his  linguist  skills  in
“countless  tactical  interrogations,  convoys,  foot  patrols,  detainee  screenings,  and
document exploitations.” (Tr. 108; AE C; AE D)

"Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.g and 1.j. He denied SOR ¶¶ 1.h,  1.i,
and 2.a. After a  thorough  and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits,  I make the
following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 31-year-old linguist for a government contractor, with whom he has
been employed since October 2017. He previously worked as a linguist in Afghanistan
for another government contractor from 2011 to 2014. He was injured while in Afghanistan
and recuperated in the United  States from January 2012  to April  2012. He returned to
Afghanistan until 2014. It is unknown whether his injury related to his job as a linguist.
(Item 3; Item 4; Item 5; Item 6.)
Applicant  was  born  in  Afghanistan.  He  attended  high  school  in  Pakistan.  He
immigrated to the United States in 2008. He was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 2017. He
resides  in  a  home  owned  by  his  father  in  the  United  States.  His  mother,  father,  and
brothers are citizens and residents of the United States. His sister is a permanent resident
in the United Sates and a citizen of Afghanistan. (Item 3; Item 4; Item 5; Item 6.)
In 2014, Applicant married his wife in Pakistan. Together, they have one child born
in 2017. His wife is a 24-year-old citizen of Afghanistan and resides with Applicant in the
United States. She is a homemaker. Applicant’s mother-in-law is a 38-year-old citizen and
resident in Afghanistan. She is a homemaker. Applicant’s father-in-law is a 49-year-old
citizen  and  resident  in  Afghanistan.  He  is  self-employed  in  an  import-export  business.
Applicant  disclosed  on  his  security  clearance  application  that  he  sent  his  father-in-law
$500 twice. Applicant later corrected this statement to clarify that he sent his father-in-law
two payments totaling $500 to assist with Applicant’s wife’s move to the United States.
Applicant has not spoken to his in-laws since his wedding. The record does not indicate
the  frequency  at  which  Applicant’s  wife  contacts  her  parents  or  if  she  visits  them  in
Afghanistan. (Item 3; Item 4; Item 5; Item 6.)
Applicant’s  grandmother  is  a  citizen  of  Afghanistan  and  resident  in  Pakistan.
Applicant  last  had  in-person  contact  with  her  in  2014.  Applicant  maintains  monthly
telephonic contact with his grandmother. (Item 3; Item 4; Item 5; Item 6.)
Applicant has two cousins who are citizens of Afghanistan, but reside in Pakistan.
Neither cousin has served in the military. They are both self-employed. The SOR alleged
that Applicant sent approximately $12,000 in support to one of his cousins. That allegation
was  based  upon  Applicant’s  disclosure  on  his  security  clearance  application  that  he
provided his cousin $2,000 on six occasions. Applicant denied that amount in his Answer.
He recalculated the funds sent to his cousin by adding up receipts for the transactions
and found that he sent a total of $3,105 over four to five years. (Answer; Item 3; Item 4;
Item 5; Item 6.) He indicated:
The reason of sending this amount is because of my spouse expenses and
my own cloths, dry fruit and because of Muslim Eid occasion where we sent
money to do Sacrifices of a Goat, cow [sic] from behalf of me and my family.
(Answer.)
Applicant  maintained  contact  with  two  childhood  friends.  One  is  a  citizen  of
Afghanistan  who  resides  in  Pakistan.  This  friend  is  a  student  and  supports  himself  by
performing odd jobs. Applicant speaks to him once or twice a year by phone. The other
is a citizen and resident of Pakistan. He runs a gas station. Neither friend has “military
experience.” Applicant last saw the second friend in 2014 at Applicant’s wedding, and has
one or two telephone conversations with him yearly. (Item 3; Item 4; Item 5; Item 6.)
Applicant  had  an  extramarital  relationship  with  an  Afghan  citizen  residing  in  the
United Kingdom from approximately October 30, 2017 to January 2018. They met on a
social media platform. The relationship ended after the woman became engaged to marry
another man. She was a student and worked part-time in an electronics store. Applicant
has not had contact with her since January 2018. Applicant told “his wife he was traveling
to England to visit a friend, and that is all she is required to know . . . in his culture he is
not required to tell his wife any further information.” He did not plan to tell his wife about
his  extramarital  relationship.  Applicant  did  not  feel  the  information  could  be  used  to
blackmail  him  because  he  knows  his  wife  “would  never  believe  he  would  ever  be
unfaithful.” (Answer.)
Applicant failed to list the woman with whom he had the extramarital affair with on
his November 17, 2017 security clearance application under foreign contacts. However,
he denied that the omission was intentional. (Item 3; Item 4; Item 5; Item 6.) He explained:
I have mention[ed] [name omitted] during my CI interview with full detail and
the  reason  [I]  first  missed  it  to  put  it  in  (e-QIP)  Maybe  because  [I]  didn’t
double  check  my  all  detail  and  was  unable  to  put  everything’s  which  [I]
should have, it [was] also possible because when there is too much paper
work there is always a chance a person missed some of the information to
put because naturally a person want to finish things in a hurry. (Answer.)
Applicant provided a copy of his itinerary showing that he flew to London in October
2, 2017, and returned early November 2017. His child was born the day after his return
to the United States. He disclosed this travel on his security clearance application and
listed  the  purpose  of  his  trip  as  “tourism.”  He  disclosed  his  extramarital  affair  with  the
resident of the United Kingdom at his November 20, 2017 counterintelligence screening.
(Item 6.) The next day, November 21, 2017, he signed his security clearance application.
(Item 4.) Despite disclosing the extramarital relationship to the Government, his wife does
not know of the affair.
Afghanistan
The U.S. Department of State has issued a travel warning for Afghanistan, due to
crime,  terrorism,  civil  unrest,  and  armed  conflict.  It  notes  that  travel  to  all  areas  of
Afghanistan  is  unsafe  due  to  the  ongoing  risk  of  kidnapping,  hostage  taking,  military
combat operations, suicide bombings, and insurgent attacks. Attacks may target official
Afghan  and  U.S.  governmental  convoys  and  compounds.  Extremists  associated  with
Taliban networks and the Islamic State are active throughout Afghanistan. Widespread
human rights abuses are reported. (Item 9.)
Pakistan
The  U.S.  Department  of  State  has  issued  a  travel  warning  for  Pakistan  due  to
terrorist  threats.  Terrorists  in  Pakistan  attack  with  little  or no  warning  and  target  public
places  like  shopping  malls,  airports,  universities,  military  installations,  and  tourist
locations.  Further,  human  rights  abuses  including  extrajudicial  and  targeted  killings,
disappearances, torture, lack of rule of law, and vigilante justice exist in Pakistan. (Item

"Applicant is a 52-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer for about four months. He is married for the second time. He has a
child from his first marriage. He and his current wife have four children.1
Applicant  was  born  in  Iraq.  His  family moved  to  Kuwait  when  he  was  young  for
greater  opportunities.  Applicant  was  educated,  including  attendance  at  law  school,  in
Kuwait.  He  was  unable  to  complete  his  education,  and  his  father  was  imprisoned  in
1990 after Iraq invaded Kuwait. His father was discriminated against because he was of
Iraqi origins. The family moved back to Iraq in 1993. Applicant was unable to complete
his education in Iraq because of the circumstances in that country.2
Applicant  volunteered  to  work  for  the  U.S.  military  in  2003.  He  worked  under
dangerous  conditions  in  Iraq  as  a  linguist  for  the  U.S.  military,  coalition  forces,  and
civilian government and reconstruction teams from 2003 to 2009. Because of that work,
he was eligible for a special immigrant visa. He immigrated to the United States in 2009.
His wife and children did not immigrate with him. He became a U.S. citizen in 2015.3
Applicant’s  father  is  deceased.  Applicant’s  wife,  five  children,  mother,  seven
siblings, in-laws, and extended family members are citizens and residents of Iraq. None
of his family have visited him in the United States. With the exception of his siblings who
are  teachers,  to  his  knowledge,  none  of  his  family  members  have  any  current
connection to the Iraqi government or any terrorist organization.4
Applicant  has  been  unable  to  bring  his  wife  and  their  children  to  the  United
States  because  of  financial  reasons.  He  will  work  in  Iraq  as  a  linguist  if  he  obtains  a
security  clearance.  He  hopes  to  use  the  extra  pay  he  will  receive  to  finance  their
immigration to the United States. He credibly testified that his family in Iraq could not be
used to coerce or intimidate him into revealing classified information.5

Bodeen (Group: Officials destroying crosses, burning bibles in China): “China’s government is ratcheting
up a crackdown on Christian congregations in Beijing and several provinces, destroying crosses, burning
bibles,  shutting  churches  and  ordering  followers  to  sign  papers  renouncing  their  faith,  according  to
pastors  and  a  group  that  monitors  religion  in  China.  .  .  .  The  campaign  corresponds  with  a  drive  to

challenge to its power over people’s lives.
bachelor’s  degree,  completed  two  years  of  post-graduate  study,  and  received  a  post-
graduate  certificate.  Applicant  is  proud  of  her  U.S.  citizenship  and  this  country.
Moreover,  she  enjoys  her  right  to  vote  and  her  ability  to  serve  on  a  jury.
Raised  in  China, Applicant  and her  husband  immigrated  to  the  United  States  in
1999  after  living  in  Europe  for  several  years.  She  became  a  United  States  citizen  in
2010.  The  couple  has  two  adult  children  who  were  raised  and  educated  in  the  United
States. The couple owns their own home. Remaining in China as citizens and residents
are Applicant’s mother, father, one sister, and Applicant’s parents-in-law.
A  well-regarded  colleague,  neighbor,  and  friend,  Applicant,  her  husband,  and
children  have  notable  roots  in  their  community.  They  are  active  in  their  Christian  faith
and  have  a  strong  interest  in  the  faith  and  culture  of  their  Jewish  friends.  Applicant’s
husband has a long history of work for the United States government and with American
media. They believe they have been fortunate to build careers and a family in the United
States over the past two decades.
Applicant has worked to impress upon her family and in-laws in China “how much
she  loves  this  country”  and  has  “shared  with  all  her  four  elder  parents  her  most
important  treasure, her  Christian faith.”  (Tr. 26)  Applicant  also  has one  sister  who  is  a
long-term  citizen  of  the  United  States,  where  she  has  raised  her  own  family.  Another
sister  lives  close  to  their  parents  in  China,  where  the  sibling  and  her  parents  visit
multiple  times  a  week.  (Tr.  40)  Applicant maintains  contact  with  her  parents anywhere
from daily to multiple times a week via telephone, email, and social media. She regularly
contacts  her  sister  in  China.  Applicant’s  husband  communicates  with  his  parents
weekly. Applicant visits her family in China annually. (Tr. 41, 45) Her parents and sister
have visited the United States from China once or twice in the past decade. (Tr. 42-43)
Applicant  is  personally  aware  of  the  nature  of  the  Chinese  government.  During
the uprising at Tiananmen Square in 1989, Applicant joined her fellows from academe
in  demonstration  against  that  government.  As  a  result,  she  was  interrogated  several
times  and  threatened  with  imprisonment.  During  China’s  Cultural  Revolution,  her
parents  and  in-laws  “all  were  made  to  suffer  physically  and  emotionally,  how  bad  you
can’t  imagine.”  (Tr.  33)  None  of  these  kin  mention  Applicant’s  husband’s  work  with  a
U.S.  governmental  entity.  (Tr.  33)  She  noted  that  her  husband’s  employment  placed
them at risk every year when they traveled to China. (Tr. 33) Every time they return to
China they keep a “very low profile . . . and don’t want to tell people where [they] work
because  [they  are]  concerned  and  worried  about  [their]  security.”  (Tr.  33)  Applicant
noted: “every time when we go back to China, we feel our life is threatened.” (Tr. 37)
In the past, a few of Applicant’s husband’s siblings were contacted to talk to the
police. (Tr. 34, 44) The siblings feel threatened because of Applicant’s husband’s work.
(Tr. 37) Applicant stated: “[the police] want to warn them ‘why your brother works for [his
employer?] . . . kind of threatening, you know?’ Even our relatives feel a threat because
my husband works for [that entity]. It’s an anti-China entity.” (Tr. 34) The brothers have
been asked to observe and report on Applicant’s husband’s activities. (Tr. 38, 44) One
particular  contact  left  a  brother  scared.  (Tr.  44)  Consequently,  Applicant  and  her
husband try to keep a low profile in order to avoid trouble for their families. (Tr. 44)
It was also noted that Applicant’s parents and parents-in-law, all of whom are in
their  mid-  to  late-80s  or  early-90s  and  in  declining  health,  are  Christians.  Because  of
their  age  and  faith,  they  “keep  a  low  profile  in  their  daily  lives”  in  China.  (Tr.  36)
Applicant  posited  that  her  parents  and  parents-in-law  have  not  been  interrogated
because of their age. (Tr. 38)

"Applicant  is  37  years  old  and  single.  He  reports  no  children.  He  was  born  in
Baghdad,  Iraq  and  he  served  as  a  linguist  for  a  federal  contractor  attached  to  armed
forces of the United States from 2003 to 2009. (GE 1, Tr. 15, 35) He went on more than
1,000  combat  patrols.  (Tr.  86)  Applicant  has  one  brother,  age  30,  who  served  as  a
linguist  in  support  of  U.S.  Marines  in  Iraq  for  five  years.  (Tr.  36)  He  also  has  three
sisters  still  living  in  different  cities  in  Iraq  with  their  husbands  and  families.  Their  ages
are 31, 39, and 42. Applicant’s parents moved from Iraq to Syria in 2005 and remained
for  three  years.  (Tr.  38-39)  Next,  they  moved  to  Turkey  due  to  the  instability  in  Syria.
Applicant moved to the U.S. in 2009 on a special immigrant visa program and he was
naturalized in 2014. (Tr. 15)
Applicant’s  mother  served  in  the  Ministry  of  Education  in  Iraq  for  22  years,  and
his father retired from the Iraqi Army as a major in 1989-’90, after more than 20 years of
service.    (Tr.  30-31)  Applicant  provided  financial  support  of  $250,  once  a  month  from
2010-2016,  to  his  parents  for  such  things  as  medical  bills.  (Tr.  39)  They  are  refugees
residing  in  Turkey.  Applicant  has  telephonic  contact  with  his  parents  once  or  twice  a
week. (Tr. 40-41) Applicant has filed an application with the Embassy in Turkey to try to
move  them  to  the  U.S.  on  a  visa.  His  brother  tutors  school  children  in  Iraq.  They  last
had  contact  more  than  three  years  ago.  (Tr.  43)  Applicant’s  two  oldest  sisters  are
teachers in Iraq and his youngest sister never worked. (Tr. 44) In addition to providing
financial support to his parents, as needed, Applicant gave his youngest sister $900 to
help  her  buy  a  car.  (Tr.  45)  His  telephonic  contact  with  his  sisters  varies  from  once
every two weeks to once a month. He has no property in Iraq, and held a bank account
there briefly from 2008-2009. (Tr. 89)
Applicant  submitted  a  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  on  February  28,
2017.2  In  section  22  (Police  Record)  of  his  SCA,  he  answered  “no”  to  all  questions
about  being  issued  any  summons,  citations,  tickets  to  appear  in  court  in  a  criminal
proceeding  etc. Applicant failed to disclose  the  civil  summons,  4  criminal  summonses,
25  citations  and  18  traffic  warnings  that  he  received  between  November  2010  and
September  2016.  (GE  4-11)  He  admitted  all  of  these  traffic  violations  in  his  Answer.
Applicant submitted AE A, an updated state division of motor vehicles driving record, to
show that he has not had any vehicle violations since 2015. Applicant testified credibly
that he may have misinterpreted the questions in this section of the SCA but since all of
his  citations  involved  fines  of  less  than  $300,  he  was  not  required  to  report  them.  (Tr.
82) Since all of the charges against him alleged in SOR ¶¶ 2.a–2.e were dismissed and
Applicant  served  no  community  service,  paid  no  fines,  and  had  no  consequences,  he
misunderstood  and  believed  he  did  not  have  to  report  these  in  his  SCA.  (Tr.  83)  To
corroborate his testimony on this point, he did disclose his arrest for domestic violence
1  Unless  otherwise  stated,  the  basis  for  these  findings  of  fact  is  Applicant’s  Questionnaire  for  National
Security  Positions  (SCA)  dated  February  28,  2017  (GE  1)  and  the  summaries  of  personal  subject

in  2015  (SOR  ¶  2.a)  and  protective  order  against  him,  as  well  as  the  arrest  for
communicating  threats  in  2016,  to the  clearance  investigator  in  his  December  8,  2017
clearance interview. (GE 2, Tr. 117) He disclosed this offense because it is the only one
where he went to trial.
In September 2011, Applicant lived with his girlfriend. They had a disagreement
and when he tried to move out, she gave him only half of his personal property. (Tr. 58)
She tried to shove him out the door and he allegedly pushed her. The judge dismissed
this complaint at SOR ¶ 2.a. (Tr. 58) In SOR ¶ 2.b, Applicant lent $250 to a female co-
worker  who  was  in  financial  distress  in  January  2015.  He  asked  her  for  a  check  to
secure this loan, which he would only cash after she became solvent. (Tr. 60-63) When
he  later  tried  to  cash  the  check,  he  found  that  there  were  insufficient  funds  in  her
account  and  confronted  her.  She  tried  to  snatch  the  cold  check  out  of  his  hand  and
called police. He was charged with trespassing and the judge summarily dismissed that
complaint and had her arrested for uttering a false instrument. (Tr. 63) In August 2015,
a  mentally  ill  neighbor  alleged  that  Applicant  committed  simple  assault,  but  promptly
dropped  the  charges. (GE  6, Tr. 63)  Again, Applicant  was  arrested for  communicating
threats against a former business partner in March 2016, as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e, and
that charge was dismissed by the judge on May 16, 2016. (GE 8)
Applicant  obtained  his  commercial  driver’s  license  (CDL)  and  operated  a
transportation  company  from  2013-2017.  (Tr.  52)  He  received  numerous  citations  for
driving infractions during that period. (Tr. 55) Applicant testified that he started driving in
Iraq  when  he  was  14  years  old,  and  he  was  accustomed  to  driving  unimpeded  by
restrictions on speed, and rules and regulations. (Tr. 75) He had difficulty assimilating to
the rules of the road and driving laws when he moved to the U.S. at age 28. Although
he studied a safe driving booklet, passed a written exam, and took a state road test to
obtain his state driver’s license in 2009, he had a habit of speeding. (GE 9, 10, 11, Tr.
77)
Applicant  testified  credibly  that  despite  his  astonishing  number  of  driving
offenses,  his  state  license  was  never  suspended,  and  it  is  still  valid.  (Tr.  80,  AE  A)
Instead, he would routinely hire an attorney who  would go into state court and get the
driving offense reduced to improper equipment (odometer), and pay a fine – 25 times.
(Tr.  79)  Despite  this  ruse,  Applicant  was  aware  that  the  problem  was  not  a  defective
odometer.  (Tr.  123)  Applicant  admitted  that  he  took  too  long  to  change  his  driving
habits,  but  he  did  so.  (Tr.  79)  He  was  recently  issued  a  warning  in  2018  because  he
was driving his girlfriend’s car, which had an improperly displayed license plate. (Tr. 96)
Applicant  was  involved  in  a  civil  dispute  with  one  of  his  former  employee-truck
drivers, after that driver abandoned one of his trucks and left it unattended. (Tr. 12, GE
7) He was charged with simple assault on the other CDL driver in August 2015 at SOR
¶  2.d.  The  state  court  judge  dismissed  this  criminal  complaint  against  Applicant  on
September  28,  2015.  (GE  7)  Then,  a  civil  action  ensued  between  Applicant  and  the
same  driver  for  $4,500  that  Applicant  loaned  the  driver.  It  was  resolved  for  $4,500  in
Applicant’s favor.  (Tr. 72)  Applicant  reasonably  stated  that  he  had  no  reason  to  report
this  civil  action  in  his  favor,  in  his  SCA,  and  he  did  not  intend  to  falsify  that  form  or
deceive the government as alleged in SOR ¶ 3.c because this is all a matter of public
court records. (Tr. 114, 118, GE 7,12)
Applicant submitted AE B–K, which are character reference letters, and AE L-N,
which  are  certificates  of  appreciation  for  his  service  as  a  linguist  on  behalf  of  U.S.
Armed  Forces.  Notably,  he  served  coalition  forces  with  bravery  and  distinction  since
2006.  An  Army  Brigadier  General  stated  “service  of  local  national  translators  who  risk
their  safety,  and  that  of  their  families,  to  support  the  mission  and  U.S.  soldiers,  is
invaluable.”  (AE  B)  Applicant  was  first  employed  by  the  U.S.  military  as  a  general
laborer in 2004 in Iraq. Then, he served in direct support of combat units including the
82nd Airborne Division, and 2nd and 3rd Brigade Combat Teams, 4th Infantry Division, as
an Arabic translator. He performed so well that he was added to Army civil action teams
in 2008. (AE C-N)

Applicant  graduated  from  high  school  in  June  1982.  He  subsequently  earned
several  degrees:  (1)  a  bachelor  of  science  degree  in  physics,  minoring  in  biology  and
mathematics,  in  June  1987;  (2)  a  master’s  degree  in  physics  in  March  1989;  (3)  a
Ph.D.in physics in December 1994; and (4) a joint degree – J.D. in December 1998 and

practice  medicine  in  five  states,  an  inactive  license  to  practice  medicine  in  one  state,
and active licenses to practice law in two states. (Tr. 35-42; AE C, AE L, AE R, AE S)
Applicant  was  married  from  June  2000  to  November  2003,  and  that  marriage
ended by divorce. He remarried in April 2014. Both spouses are U.S.-born citizens. (Tr.

His  oldest  son  was  born  while  he  was  married  to  his first  wife,  and  two  younger  sons
were born while he was married to his second and current wife. Applicant’s wife is not
employed outside the home. At the time Applicant met his wife, she was employed as a
grant analyst at a major university. (Tr. 43-45)
Foreign Influence
Applicant was born in Iran to Iranian parents.  In September 1978, at age 12, he
immigrated to the United States, along with his two older brothers, because of political
instability  in  Iran.  Since  then,  he  has  never  returned  to  Iran.  Initially  Applicant  and  his
brothers  lived  with  their  uncle  (mother’s  brother),  who  was  an  active  duty  U.S.  Navy
doctor.  Applicant’s  parents  and  older  sister  later  joined  him  and  his  brothers  in  the
United States. (Tr. 48-49, 88, 99-; GE 1) Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in
June 1996, and was issued his most recent U.S. passport in July 2007. (GE 1; AE M,
AE N)
Applicant’s  father  was  an  Iranian  Army  colonel  during  the  Shah  of  Iran’s
government, and was “in charge of passports in Iran.” When his father retired from the
Iranian  Army,  he  joined  the  family  business  of  “multi-generational  real  estate  people”
doing  “land  transactions.”  His  father’s  post-military  real  estate  career  was  going  well
until  the  Shah  was  overthrown  in  February  1999.  Hearing  reports  that  several  of  his
friends were executed shortly after the Shah was overthrown, Applicant’s father left Iran
for the United States. His father remained in the United States until he passed away in
2008. (Tr. 102-105)
Applicant’s elderly mother is a naturalized U.S. citizen and lives in Iran part time.
At  the  time  of  Applicant’s  hearing,  she  was  in  Iran  and  unable  to  return  to  the  United
States because of poor health. Applicant tries to communicate with his mother “once a
week”  on  the  telephone.  His  mother  was  a  school  teacher  before  becoming  a
homemaker. (Tr. 49-54, 82-85, 90-91, 97, 99) Applicant has two older brothers and an
older sister, who live in the United States. His oldest brother and sister are successful
physicians  and  his  other  brother  is  a  real  estate  agent  and  software  programmer.
Applicant  communicates  with  his  siblings  on  a  regular  basis  as  time  allows,  given
everyone’s respective schedules with their careers and families. (Tr. 55-57)
Applicant  has  extended  family  members  on  his  mother’s  side  living  in  Iran,
including  an  aunt,  three  (“maybe  four”)  uncles,  and  several  cousins  who  are  resident
citizens  of  Iran.  His  aunt  and  uncles  are  retired,  elderly,  and  not  affiliated  with  the
Iranian  government.  Since  Applicant  came  to  the  United  States,  he  talked  to  his
relatives  in  Iran  infrequently  --  a  handful  of  times  by  telephone.  He  met  one  of  his
cousins,  a  dentist,  who  visited  the  United  States  about  seven  years  ago.  All  of  his
uncles  on  his  father’s  side  have  passed  away.  Applicant  does  not  have  a  close
relationship with any of his relatives in Iran, except his mother. (Tr. 57-63)
Applicant has ownership or co-ownership interest in approximately 12 properties
in  Iran,  including  a  family  home,  two  apartments,  a  house,  and  eight  parcels  of  land,
with  an  estimated  value  of  at  least  $1  million  U.S.  dollars.  These  properties  are
managed by his mother. All of these properties were acquired by his late father before
the Iranian revolution. Applicant has not visited these properties since he arrived in the
United  States  nor  does  he  provide  any  financial  support  to  maintain  them.  These
properties  are  also  co-owned  by  his  siblings  and  his mother.  Applicant  did  not  have  a
full  appreciation  of  his  Iranian  properties  until  he  completed  the  paperwork  for  his
background  investigation.  It  was  only  after  some  extensive  conversations  with  his
brothers that he realized the extent of his real estate holdings in Iran. Once he became
aware  of  these  assets,  he  fully  disclosed  that  information  during  his  background
investigation. (Tr. 63-68, 85-87, 89, 95)
Unbeknownst to Applicant, he also had an ownership or co-ownership interest in
an  Iranian  bank  account  used  to  maintain  family  properties  in  Iran.  This bank  account
has  an  undetermined  value,  and  is  managed  and  controlled  by  his  mother.  Applicant
has no idea when this bank account was established, has never seen a bank statement,
and  requested  that  his  name  be  removed  from  the  account.  Applicant  surmised  this
account was established when he was a child by his parents. He only found out about
the bank account when he began making inquiries of his family members in response to
questions  that  arose  during  his  background  investigation.  Applicant  had  his  name
removed  from  the  account,  which  is  documented  by  the  sworn  affidavit  of  his brother.
(Tr. 71-72, 88-89, 108-109; AE W)
Applicant  has  a  number  of  properties  in  the  United  States  that  far  exceed  the
value of the Iranian properties in which he may have an interest. Because of the current
embargo  between  the  United  States  and  Iran,  Applicant  is  unable  to  derive  any
proceeds  from  the  family  Iranian  properties.  Furthermore,  he  has  no  control  over  his
Iranian  property  interests,  nor does  he  want  any  involvement  with  these  properties.  In
essence, Applicant’s Iranian properties are of no value to him. (Tr. 68-70, 95-96; GE 4;
AE E) To that end, he set up a blind trust in December 2018, which is irrevocable for the
duration  of his  employment  as a  defense  contractor that  transferred  any  and all  of  his
Iranian property  rights  to  his older brother. Applicant  has  chosen not  to  be  involved  in
any way with any property in Iran, real or personal, stating, “I don’t care what happens
to it.” The terms of this blind trust are documented by the sworn affidavit of his brother.
(Tr. 70-71, 89-90, 106-107; AE H, AE V, AE W)
Applicant’s real property holdings in the United States consist of four homes and
several land parcels. He estimates his net worth to be in the range of  $5 to $6 million
dollars. He has approximately $100,000 in retirement accounts. (Tr. 72-74, 107; AE T)
Applicant’s annual salary  as a contract physician  is $450,000. He also has a part-time
job  as  a  physician  consultant  with  a  search engine  company,  with  an  annual salary  of
$200,000. His combined annual salary is $650,000. (Tr. 107-108; AE K)
Personal Conduct
Applicant is alleged to have falsified his September 2016 e-QIP by failing to list
two  of  his  siblings,  three  uncles,  an  aunt,  his  Iranian  real  estate  holdings,  and  the
Iranian bank account, discussed above.  Before submitting his e-QIP on line, Applicant
completed  a  draft  hard  copy  of  his  e-QIP.  When  completing  his  e-QIP  on  line,  he
encountered  some  “computer  glitches.”  He  thought  he  had  provided  the  requested
information  when  he  hit  the  “submit”  button,  but  apparently  the  information  did  not  go
through. He stated when he hit the “submit” button, the program “would just freeze.” He
informed the security office about the problems he encountered when completing his e-
QIP and provided documentation of same. (Tr. 75-78, 90-94; AE U, AE V)
Applicant provided the draft hard copy of his e-QIP that he used when completing
his  e-QIP  on  line.  The  draft  hard  copy  listed  the  missing  relatives.  He  also  disclosed
these relatives during his April 2018 Office of Personnel Management Personal Subject
Interview  (OPM  PSI),  and  in  his  March  2018  Response  to  Interrogatories.  (Tr.  75-78,
94; GE 2, GE 3; AE D, AE F)
Applicant is also alleged to have falsified his September 2016 e-QIP by failing to
list  his  real  property  interests  in  Iran.  As  discussed  above,  Applicant  was  unaware  of
these  properties  until  he  underwent  his  background  investigation.  As  with  the  missing
relatives  issue,  Applicant  disclosed  the  Iranian  bank  account  during  his  OPM  PSI  as
well as in his Response to Interrogatories. Applicant credibly testified regarding these e-
QIP  omissions  and  did  not  attempt  to  withhold  or  conceal  information  on  his  e-QIP  to
gain a position of trust. (Tr. 78-82)
Applicant  professed  his  loyalty  for  the  United  States.  He  appreciates  the
freedoms and opportunities available to him and his family here. Applicant believes he
has  served  the  United  States  well  as  a  productive  citizen.  He  is  grateful  that  he  can
provide care for this country’s servicemen and women and their dependents, and give
back  in  some  small  measure  to  the  United  States  what  this  country  has  given  to  him.

Character Evidence
Applicant  called  an  active  duty  senior  hospital  corpsman  (HM)  as  a  character
witness.  HM  is  the  clinical  supervisor  and  senior  technician  at  the  hospital  where
Applicant  is  employed.  HM  has  held  a  secret  security  clearance  for  19  years  and  is
familiar  with  the  clearance  process.  HM  supervises  34  active  duty  military  personnel
and 16 civilian employees. (Tr. 17-20) HM has known Applicant since he reported to the
hospital in January 2017 and interacts with him on a daily basis, 12 hours a day, 5 days
a  week.  (Tr.  20-21)  HM  described  the  clinic  workload  as  “very  heavy,”  with  their
radiologists  responsible  for  treating  “thousands  of  patients.”  He  stated  Applicant  is
always  willing  to  assist  in  whatever  task  is  needed  and  always  puts  the  patient  first.
Applicant  is  considered  to  be  a  very  honest,  straightforward,  caring,  dependable,  and
trustworthy physician. (Tr. 21-26)
Applicant  has  earned  a  reputation  for  being  one  of  the  most  highly  respected
radiologists on staff. HM has no reason to doubt Applicant’s loyalty to the United States.
He is familiar with the security concerns Applicant is facing and stated that that he has
no concerns with Applicant’s ties to Iran. HM recommended Applicant for a position of
trust.  Applicant  regularly  demonstrates  his  trustworthiness  in  a  key  position  that  is
crucial  to  this  hospital’s  ability  to  provide  timely  and  comprehensive  services  to  their
patient population. (Tr. 26-28)
Applicant  submitted  numerous  reference  letters  from  fellow  physicians  and
colleagues.  The  collective  sense  of  these  letters  reflects  that  Applicant  is  loyal  to  the
United States, and is a tremendous asset at  the hospital and to the patient population
he serves. (AE B, AE P) Applicant has authored or co-authored 22 articles published in
various  medical  journals  or  medical  media,  participated  in  31  oral  presentations,  and
participated in two funded research projects. (AE L) His work performance evaluations
and  awards  document  rock-solid  performance.  (AE  O,  AE  Q)  On  the  home  front,
Applicant and his family are firmly established in their community. (AE A, AE I, AE J)

"Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  allegations  in  the  SOR,  with  clarifications.  After  a
thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant is a 31-year-old employee of a government contractor. He was born in
Afghanistan.  He  and  his  immediate family  fled  to Pakistan from  Afghanistan  in  August
2001 to escape the presence of the Taliban. They returned to Afghanistan in September
2003,  after  the  U.S.  presence  in  Afghanistan  made  it  safe  to  return.  He  lived  in
Afghanistan through 2011. He graduated from high school in Afghanistan and attended
some  college  there.  He  married  a  U.S.  citizen  in  2010,  and  immigrated  to  the  United
States  on  a  spousal  visa  in  July  2011.  He  has  one  minor  child  from  that  marriage.
Applicant returned to Afghanistan as a translator for U.S. forces in late 2011 through May
2013,  when  he  returned  to  the  United  States.  Applicant  and  his  spouse  divorced  in
October 2014. His former wife has custody of their child, and Applicant pays child support.
He married his second wife, a citizen and resident of Afghanistan, in April 2015. In 2017,
he returned to Afghanistan as a translator. He was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in June
2017. (Item 3; Item 4; Item 5; Item 6.)
Applicant’s wife is a full-time student and resides with her parents in Afghanistan.
His  in-laws  are  citizens  of  Afghanistan.  Applicant’s  father-in-law  is  self-employed  in  a
stationery  supply  company.  His  mother-in-law  is  a  homemaker.  Applicant  has  filed  a
petition to sponsor his wife to immigrate to the United States. They reside in a $4,000,000
home owned by Applicant’s father-in-law in Afghanistan. (Item 8.)
Applicant’s  mother,  father,  two  brothers,  and  two  sisters  all  are  citizens  and
residents  of  Afghanistan.  He  also  has  two  sisters  who  are  permanent  residents  of  the
United States. One of his U.S.-resident sisters works as a dental assistant and the other
is a homemaker. His family in Afghanistan reside together in an apartment owned by his
mother. The apartment is valued at approximately $150,000. Applicant’s father is a real
estate agent. His mother is a school teacher. His two of his sisters and two brothers in
Afghanistan are students. Applicant sends approximately $2,500 to $3,000 monthly to his
parent to assist with his siblings’ education. He also provides money for his parents’ food
and living expenses. (Item 6; Item 7; Item 8.)
Applicant “does not feel he can live [in Afghanistan] because [he] grew up in an
educated family, and [he] feels like [he] is not suited for the country (Afghanistan). [He]
does not like the poverty in the country or the discrimination [he] received for growing up
in a modern household.” (Item 6 at 3.)
Afghanistan
The  U.S.  Department  of  State  has  issued  a  travel  warning  with  respect  to
Afghanistan, due to crime, terrorism, civil unrest, and armed conflict. It notes that travel
to all areas of Afghanistan is unsafe due to the ongoing risk of kidnapping, hostage taking,
military combat operations, suicide bombings, and insurgent attacks. Attacks may target
official Afghan and U.S. governmental convoys and compounds. Extremists associated
with  Taliban  networks  and  the  Islamic  State  are  active  throughout  Afghanistan.
Widespread human rights abuses are reported. (Item 10.)

"The SOR alleges that Applicant’s uncle (SOR 1.a) and her friend (SOR 1.b) are
residents  of  Pakistan.  Applicant  admitted  both  allegations  with
citizens  and
explanations. She requested a hearing.
Applicant  is  36  years  old.  She  married  a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen  in  December
2016.  He  has  worked  for  a  U.S.  federal  agency  since  2011  and  has  a  security
clearance.  She  received  her  bachelor’s  degree  in  April  2005  (psychology)  and  two
master’s  degrees  in  May  2007  (psychology)  and  May  2011  (mass  communications).
She has been working for a defense contractor as a research analyst since September
2013. She received a promotion to a principal analyst in 2016, and is being considered
for a position as task leader. She held a security clearance from 2012 to August 2014,
when the clearance was “disapproved.” (GE 1 at 9-45, 60-61; Answer to SOR; AE A; Tr.
22-26, 31-32, 37)
SOR 1.a – Applicant’s uncle is a citizen and resident of Pakistan. He is a doctor
(pulmonologist)  in  the  Pakistan  Military  Medical  Corps.  This  individual  is  actually
Applicant’s  mother’s  cousin,  not  her  uncle.  Applicant  explained  that  growing  up  in  the
Pakistani  culture  one  refers  to  older  relatives  as  an  aunt  or  uncle.  When  Applicant
started filling out security applications, she continued to refer to her mother’s cousin as
uncle. He served as a doctor for the Pakistan Military Medical Corps from the 1990s to
about 2012, then he moved to another country for additional training for about a year. In
2013,  he  returned  to  the  Pakistan  Military  Medical  Corps  because  Applicant  testified
that he has been in the Corps for about 20 years. Her contact with him is four times a
year through social media and phone. Her last face-to-face contact with him was in April
2017, when she lodged at his home for a couple of days. Applicant sent an email to him
in November 2018. He has never asked Applicant about her job or information relating
to her job. (GE 1 at 42-43; GE 2 at 28, 37; GE 3 at 1; answer to SOR; Tr. 44, 46-47, 54-

SOR 1.b – Applicant’s friend is a citizen and resident of Pakistan. She is one of
Applicant’s  closest  friends  since  high  school  (circa  1996).  She  is  employed  as  a
teacher. As of May 2016, Applicant was contacting her friend about four to five times a
year.  The  friend  came  to  the  United  States  in  2012  for  medical  treatment.  During  her
stay, the friend resided with her sister in another state. Applicant last spoke to her friend
about six months before the hearing. (GE 1 at 43-44; GE 3 at 2; answer to SOR; Tr. 56-
59)
Applicant’s mother is 58 years old. She is a naturalized U.S. citizen, and lives in
another state. She is employed as a mental health clinician. (GE 1 at 35-36; GE 3 at 1;
Tr. 33)
Applicant’s  father  is  69  years  old  and  is  a  Pakistani  citizen,  who  resides  in  the
United States. In a May 2016 signed affidavit, Applicant indicated to an investigator from
the  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  that  she  was  unaware  of  her  father’s
location due to her parents’ divorce in approximately 2001. Her last social media contact
with  him  was  in  2009,  when  they  discussed  her  brother’s  personal  problems.  While  in
Pakistan, her father was employed by a pharmaceutical company. In the United States,
he was driving a taxi. (GE 1 at 36-37; GE 3 at 1)
Applicant’s  30-year-old  brother,  a  lawyer,  is  a  citizen  of  Pakistan  living  in  the
United  States  in  another  state.  In  December  2017,  she  did  not  know  his  citizenship
status and was estranged from him for about seven years. Applicant did not believe that
her brother was affiliated with any foreign government. (GE 1 at 38-39)
Applicant’s father-in-law and mother-in-law are naturalized U.S. citizens living in
another  state.  (GE  2  at  4)  Applicant’s  husband  has  several  relatives  (not  listed  in  the
SOR) who are citizens and residents of Bangladesh. These persons are identified in the
relatives’ matrix in her January 2018 answers to interrogatories (GE 2 at 9-18). Neither
Applicant nor her husband have had any contact with the first nine relatives since 1992.
(GE 2 at 9-12) Applicant or her husband expect to contact the tenth relative every two or
three years by email and phone, with their last contact occurring in 2017. (GE 2 at 12)
The last contact with the relative listed at number 11 was in 1985. There has been no
contact with the 12th relative. (GE 2 at 12) The last contact with the next eight relatives
was  in  1992.  (GE  2  at  13-15) The  last  contact  with  her husband’s 21st  and  22nd  listed
relative was in 2016, with future contact expected to occur once every ten years. (GE 2
at  16)  The  last  contact  with  the  23rd  relative  was  in  2016,  with  no  expected  future
contact. They have had no contact with the 24rd relative. Applicant or her husband’s last
contact with his 25th relative was in 2016, with no contact since. (GE 2 at 17) Their last
contact with the 26th relative was in 2017, with future  contacts expected to occur once
every  10  years.  Neither Applicant  nor her husband have  had  any contact  with  the  last
four  relatives  listed.  (GE  2  at  17-18)  From  the  30  relatives  listed  on  the  matrix,
Applicant’s  only  recent  contact  was  with  the  10th  and  26th  relative.  Applicant  or  her
husband’s last contact with the tenth relative was in 2017, with the frequency of  future
contact occurring once every two to three years. The last contact with the 26th relative
was also in 2017, with the frequency of expected future contact expected to occur once
every  10  years.  None  of  Applicant  or  her  husband’s  relatives  are  in  a  position  to  be
exploited  by  a  foreign  power  that  could  force  Applicant  or  her  husband  to  choose
between loyalty to the person(s) involved and the United States. (GE 2 at 9-18, 31)
Neither  Applicant  nor  her  husband  have  any  financial  interests  in  a  foreign
country.  They  do  not  receive  any  income  from  a  foreign  government  or  entity.
Conversely,  they  do  not  owe  money  or  have  a  legal  obligation  to  any  foreign
government or entity. If Applicant suspects someone is trying to exploit her or influence
her  through  her family  member,  or  in  any  other fashion,  she  will  resist  and  refuse  the
efforts to influence her and report the attempt to her facility security officer (FSO) or the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), should the situation require that action. (GE 2 at
22-26, 30; Tr. 51-52)
Applicant’s  financial  interests  in  the  United  States  include  a  home  she  and  her
husband purchased  in  November 2018 for approximately  $572,000.  According  to  their
personal  financial  statement  (PFS),  dated  February  11,  2019,  their  combined  monthly
income  was  $10,600.  Their  assets  totaled  $1,092,000.  Their  combined  monthly
expenses  were  $7,000,  with  a  monthly  remainder  of  $3,600.  Applicant  is  a  registered
U.S. voter. (AE J; AE K1-K4; AE L)

A vice president, three coworkers, one former coworker, and a manager provided
character references for Applicant. The vice president of her company believes that she
qualifies for access to classified information because of her conscientiousness. (AE E1)
Her  coworker  since  2013,  who  became  her  supervisor  in  2016,  has  worked  on  20
national security projects with her. She is devoted to following the rules and complying
with protocol. She receives regular security briefings and has demonstrated she would

and reliable, and a person who will not succumb to pressure. (AE E3) A coworker who
has  known  Applicant  for four  years  knows  that  she  follows  the  rules  and  would  report
attempts to manipulate her. (AE E4) Applicant’s friend of eight years, who worked with
her  on  a  job  in  2010,  and  has  continued  a  friendship  with  her,  considers  her  to  be
honest  and  reliable.  (AE  E5)  Applicant’s  colleague,  who  served  as  her  manager  on
several  projects,  considers  her  to  be  a  valuable  employee  with  integrity  and  job
performance  as  her  strong  points.  (AE  E6)  Applicant’s  job  performance  for  evaluation
periods  of  2015,  2016,  and  2017  have  been  good  to  excellent.  (AE  B1,  B2,  B3)

Administrative Notice – Pakistan
Pakistan  is  a  parliamentary  Islamic  republic  with  significant  internal  problems
caused  by  terrorist  organizations  concentrated  in  several  locations  within  the  country.
As  of  2014,  parts  of  Pakistan’s  Federally  Administered  Tribal  Areas,  Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa  province,  and  Balochistan  province  were  regarded  as  a  safe  haven  for
terrorist  groups,  including  al-Qaeda,  the  Haqqani  Network,  Tehrik-e  Taliban  Pakistan,
Lasahkar  I  Jhangvi,  and  the  Afghan  Taliban.  These  groups  create  ongoing  security
problems by targeting western interests, U.S. citizens, senior Pakistani officials, minority
political  groups,  and  religious  entities.  In  September  2012,  the  United  States  officially
declared  the  Haqqani  Network  a  foreign  terrorist  organization.  Operations  in  2014  by
the Pakistani military against some of the terror groups had only marginal success.
The  human  rights  record  of  Pakistan  is  not  good.  Extrajudicial  killings,  torture,
and  disappearances have  been  reported,  along  with  intrusive  government  surveillance
of  politicians,  political  activists,  and  the  media.  Government  and  police  corruption,
sexual  harassment,  and  gender  discrimination  are  persistent  problems.  Pakistani
government authorities seldom punish government officials for human rights violations.

When  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability

administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which
are flexible rules of law, apply together with common sense and the general factors of
the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable
information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a
decision.  The  protection  of  the  national  security  is  the  paramount  consideration.  AG  ¶

security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.”

responsible  for presenting  “witnesses  and  other  evidence  to  rebut,  explain,  extenuate,

"Applicant is 41 years old. He was born in the United States (U.S.) and obtained a
graduate equivalency diploma in 1995. He completed some college courses but did not
obtain a degree. Applicant married in 2003 and divorced in 2012. He has two children
from that marriage, ages 13, and 14. He married again to a Chinese national on April 9,
2016.  She  moved  in  with  Applicant  and  brought  her  own  two  children  to  join  his  two
biological children. Applicant’s wife is a resident alien in the U.S. She has a green card
and is presently in the process of applying for citizenship. She signed official documents
renouncing  her  Chinese  citizenship  and  she  is  a  stay-at-home  mother  to  the  four
children. Applicant has never traveled to China, and he has no intent to do so. He owns
no property, bank accounts, or other assets in China. Applicant has been employed as
a  senior-systems-engineer  for  a  federal  contractor  since  March  2016.  He  reports  a
previous security clearance from 2010.
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  or  security
clearance application (SCA) on April 13, 2016.2 In his personal subject interview (PSI)
with a clearance investigator on May 15, 2017, he disclosed that his wife’s parents, her
brother,  and  her  sister,  are  citizens  and  residents  of  PRC.  It  is  unclear  whether  her
siblings  in  the  PRC  have  any  affiliation  with  the  PRC  government  or  intelligence
services.  Applicant’s  father-in-law  is  77  years  old  and  suffering  from  late  stage
Alzheimer’s disease. He is retired as an office clerk from a home loan agency in PRC.
Applicant’s  mother-in-law  has  always  been  a  housewife-mother.  It  is  unclear  whether
either in law has any affiliation with the Chinese government, or whether Applicant and
his wife will inherit property located in China when they pass away. Applicant’s wife has
contact by telephone with her mother, in China, once a week. She owns no property or
bank accounts in PRC.
Applicant  disclosed  in  section  26  of  his  SCA  that  he  had  back  surgery  in  July
2005 and he lost significant income as he was out of work for a period of time. Applicant
was unemployed from January 2002 to April 2003, and he had other shorter periods of
unemployment  after  that.  He  avers  that  his  unemployment  combined  with  his  2012
divorce and uncovered medical expenses for himself, his current wife, and his children,
caused his financial problems.
Applicant stated in his answer to the SOR that the federal-tax-lien in the amount
of $2,482 at SOR ¶ 1.a would be paid by December 2018. No explanation of how this

tax lien arose, or documentation showing that it was paid, was provided. The federal tax
lien imposed in 2014 in the amount of $194,839 arose from tax years (TYs) 2007 and
2008  when  Applicant  inherited  valuable  stocks,  which  he  sold  to  buy  a  home.
Inexplicably,  Applicant  did  not  file  his  federal  income  tax  returns  timely  for  those  TYs
and  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS)  assumed  that  the  money  from  the  converted
stocks was ordinary income.3 Thus, he owed additional income taxes. He attached IRS
Forms  1040  (income  tax  returns)  for  TYs  2007  and  2008,  to  his  answer.  Both  were
signed  and  submitted  on  August  24,  2018.  His  problems  were  exacerbated  when  he
received  duplicate  W-2  forms  from  his  employer  in  2012.  Applicant  claims  (without
substantiation) that he contacted the IRS and hired a tax attorney to help sort this out. It
is unclear, what was done by the attorney, but the tax lien in SOR ¶ 1.b still stands.
In 2014 – 2015, Applicant was out of work for several months each year, and he
struggled  to  keep  up  with  the  $525  per  month  payments  on  his  family  vehicle.  It  was
voluntarily repossessed, sold at auction, and a $10,866 deficiency resulted, as reflected
in SOR ¶ 1.c. While Applicant claims to be making payments pursuant to a plan on this
debt,  in  the  amount  of  $100  per  paycheck  for  two  years,  no  evidence  of  actual
payments was provided. Similarly, he claims that the medical debt for $85 in SOR ¶ 1.o
has been paid in full, but provided no evidence of payment.
In  SOR  ¶  1.d,  Applicant  has  disputed  the  debt  in  the  amount  of  $1,756  since
2013.  He  claims  to  have  made  payment  in  full  and  returned  the  two  devices  to  a
telecommunications  provider.  However,  he  provided  no  correspondence  with  the
creditor  documenting  the  dispute.  The  remainder  of  the  delinquencies  alleged  in  SOR
¶¶ 1.e through 1.o are for medical debts that were not covered by health insurance. In
his answer, Applicant stated he made a commitment to pay the remaining medical debts
by  December  2018.  He  provided  no  documentary  evidence  that  he  has  done  so.  He
contends  that  his  ex-wife  was  ordered  by  the  court  to  pay  for  half  of  the  children’s
medical  expenses.  Applicant  has  been  working  with  her  to  pay  some  of  the  medical
debts  and  he  attached  a  few  receipts  evidencing  payment  of  some  random  moving
expenses, consumer loans, pay-day loans, and medical bills to his answer. It is unclear
which SOR debts these documents pertain to, if any.

DOD  contractors  since  2002.  He  worked  for  a  DOD  contractor  in  Iraq  from  2009  to
2011. He has worked in South Korea for his current employer, a DOD contractor, since
late 2015. He has held a security clearance since 2008. (Tr. at 52-109; GE 1-2; AE A-
O).
Applicant married in 1986, divorced in 1989, and remarried in 1994. His spouse
was born in South Korea. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2004. He met her in
South  Korea  when  he  was  stationed  there  in  1992.  He  obtained  permission  from  the
U.S.  military  to  marry  her,  since  she  was  foreign-born.  They  have  resided  in  South
Korea since 2002 and do not have any children. (Tr. at 52-109; GE 1-2; AE A-O).
Applicant’s two sisters-in-law, their spouses, and their children, are citizens and
residents  of  South  Korea.  His  third  sister-in-law  passed  away  in  2017.  Applicant  does
not communicate with his in-laws because he does not speak Korean and they do not
speak  English.  His  wife  maintains  regular  telephonic  communication  with  her  sisters,
and they see each other in person at family gatherings once every three to six months.
None of Applicant’s in-laws are affiliated with the South Korean government or military.
Applicant’s  nephew  performed  mandatory  service  in  the  South  Korean  military  for  21
months. He completed that service in August 2017 and has since worked as an internet
model selling clothes. (Tr. at 52-109; GE 1-2; AE A-O).
Applicant’s  spouse  owns  an  apartment  in  South  Korea  that  is  their  primary
residence.  She  purchased  it  in  2010  for  $256,000  USD,  and  its  current  approximate
value  is  $280,000  USD.  He  does  not  own  any  property  in  South  Korea.  When  he
completed his security application (SCA) in 2016, he thought his spouse had opened a
bank account in South Korea when they moved there in 2002. In fact, his spouse had
not done  so  and  they  do  not have  any  bank  accounts  in  South  Korea. Their  assets  in
the United States total approximately $500,000. (Tr. at 48-49, 52-109; GE 1-2; AE A-O).
Applicant’s  numerous  character  witnesses  attested  to  his  loyalty  to  the  United
States, trustworthiness, honesty, and integrity. (Tr. at 22-46, 109-126; AE E).
South Korea
The  signing  of  the  Treaty  of  Peace  on  May  22,  1882  marked  the  first  official
diplomatic interaction between the United States and South Korea. Following the end of
World  War  II  in  1945,  the  United  States  has  only  maintained  diplomatic  relations  with
South Korea, and has had no formal diplomatic relations with North Korea. South Korea
is one of the United States’ most important strategic and economic partners in Asia.
South  Korean  government  espionage  and  collection  activities  have  resulted  in
criminal  prosecutions  by  the  U.S.  Government.  Industrial  espionage  remains  a  high
profile concern relating to South Korea and South Korean companies. South Korea has
also been the unauthorized recipient of technology controlled under U.S. export control
laws,  including  material  that  could  be  used  in  encryption  software,  optics  and  prism
data, and infrared detectors and camera engines. The U.S. Department of Justice has
highlighted  numerous  efforts  by  South  Korean  persons  and  corporations  to  secure
proprietary and/or export-controlled information in contravention of U.S. law.
In  2017,  the  most  significant  human  rights  issues  in  South  Korea  included
government  interpretation  and  application  of  the  national  security  law,  libel  laws,  and
other laws that limited freedom of expression and restricted internet access; corruption;
and domestic violence.

"Applicant  admitted  to  all  the  allegations  in  SOR.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 34-year-old employee of a defense contractor. GX 1 at page 5.) He
has  been  employed  with  the  defense  contractor  since  August  of  2014.  (GX  1  at  page
13.)  He  is  married  to  a  U.S.  citizen.  (GX  1  at  pages  26~27.)  Applicant  was  born  in
Dubai, lived in Pakistan when he “was 11 or 10” years old,” and has not visited Pakistan
since then, and moved to the United States in 2003 as a twenty-year-old. (TR at page

to by his “Site . . . Manager.” (AppX A at page 2.)
Guideline B - Foreign Influence
1.a.  Applicant’s  66-year-old  mother  is  a  citizen  of  Pakistan,  but  has  lived  in  the

"In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied, with brief comments, all of the factual
allegations pertaining to foreign influence in the SOR (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.c.), and all
of the factual allegations pertaining to financial considerations in the SOR (SOR ¶¶ 2.b.
through 2.j.), claiming that the citizenship and residence of his family members and the
issues regarding his debts have no bearing on his trustworthiness and do not compromise
his ability to hold a security clearance. Other than those brief comments, Applicant offered
no facts or explanations addressing the specifics of the allegations in the SOR.  After a
complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration
of same, I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as  a  manager,  advanced  verification,  since  he  joined  his  employer  in  February  2016.
Applicant received a bachelor’s degree from a foreign university in 1991; and a master’s
degree from a university in the United States in 1995. He has never served with the U.S.
military  or  any  other  military.  He  has  never  held  a  security  clearance.  Applicant  was
married in 1996, and he reports one child, born in 2006.

proceedings. See McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986);
ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct.
12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)). The most common basis for
administrative notice at ISCR proceedings is to notice facts that are either well known or from government
reports. See Stein, Administrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for
administrative notice). Requests for administrative notice may utilize authoritative information or sources
from the internet. See, e.g. Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557 (2006) (citing internet sources for numerous
documents).  In  this  instance,  although  Department  Counsel  has  selected  only  certain  pages  of  facts
appearing in the identified publications, I have not limited myself to only those facts, but have considered
the publications in their entirety.
Foreign Influence3
Applicant was born in Bangladesh. He entered the United States in 1994, and he
became  a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen  in  2005.  Applicant’s  parents  are  both  residents  and
citizens  of Bangladesh.  His father  worked  in education  until he  retired nearly  25  years
ago, and his mother worked in family planning until she retired over 22 years ago. Both
parents are in their 70s or 80s. Applicant has two brothers who are also residents and
citizens  of  Bangladesh.  One  brother  works  for  a  private  company  associated  with  the
construction business, and his other brother owns his own business. None of those family
members  were  affiliated  with  a  foreign  government,  military,  security,  or  intelligence
service. Applicant speaks with his parents monthly, and he travels to Bangladesh to visit
them  every  one  to  two  years.  He  speaks and  texts  his brothers monthly,  and he  sees
them whenever he visits his parents. His relationship with one sister is more distant, and
while he infrequently exchanges texts and e-mails, he has not seen her since 2014. His
relationship with his other sister is generally non-existent, and he has not had any contact
with her, or seen her, since 2005. Applicant has contributed approximately $1,000 every
three to six months to one of his brothers to assist with their parents’ needs.
Applicant’s wife was also born in Bangladesh, and she too is a naturalized U.S.
citizen.  Both  of  her  parents  were  born  in  Bangladesh,  but  they  were  naturalized  U.S.
citizens and residents of the United States. Her father passed away in 2016.
Bangladesh
Bangladesh is located on the northern edge of the Bay of Bengal; it is bordered on
three  sides  by  India and  shares  a  small  border with  Burma.  Approximately  160  million
people inhabit Bangladesh, which has a land area of 55,598 square miles, slightly less
than that of Iowa. It is the eighth most populous nation in the world and the most densely
populated country, aside from some city states and tiny island nations.
Originally  part  of  British  India,  after  the  partition  of  British  India  in  1947,  the  entity
known  initially  as  East  Bengal  and  then  East  Pakistan  was  established.  In  April  1972,
following a war between India and Pakistan, the United States recognized East Pakistan as
Bangladesh  -  a  parliamentary  democracy  with  a  unicameral  legislature.  The  nation  is  a
developing  country  with  severe  infrastructure  shortcomings.  Outside  of  Dhaka,  tourist
facilities are under-developed as are capacities to deal with emergency situations.
Despite some earlier military coups following independence, Bangladesh has made
significant progress toward a more prosperous and pluralistic society since its independence
in 1971. Bangladesh returned to democratic rule in December 2008. Bangladesh’s economy
has  grown  at  6  percent  annually  for  more  than  two  decades.  The  United  States  remains

actively  engaged  in  efforts  to  strengthen  respect  for  labor  rights  and  improve  workplace
safety.  Despite  significant  development  achievements,  poverty  remains  a  challenge.
Infrastructure shortcomings, weak governance structures, and potential terrorist exploitation
by extremist groups are also vulnerabilities. The fact that Bangladesh is one of the world’s
most densely populated countries compounds these challenges.
U.S. Assistance to Bangladesh
Bangladesh is the largest recipient of U.S. assistance in Asia outside of Afghanistan
and Pakistan. U.S. assistance fosters engagement with the Government of Bangladesh and
complements support from other donors to address the underlying social, demographic, and
economic factors that threaten democratic governance, stifle economic growth, and increase
vulnerability to extremism in Bangladesh. The United States continues to build upon previous
gains  to  reduce  poverty,  improve  health  and  education,  mitigate  the  impact  of  natural
disasters, and achieve better governance to spur equitable and sustainable growth.
Bilateral Economic Relations
The United States exports to Bangladesh include agricultural products (cotton, wheat,
dairy), aircraft, machinery, and iron and steel products.  The United States is Bangladesh’s
single largest importer of goods including apparel, other textile products, headgear, shrimp
and prawns, and agricultural products (primarily tobacco). The two countries conduct annual
talks under a Trade and Investment Cooperation Framework Agreement (TICFA) signed in
2013.
Bangladesh's Membership in International Organizations
Bangladesh  and  the  United  States  belong  to  a  number  of  the  same  international
organizations, including the United Nations, ASEAN Regional Forum, International Monetary
Fund,  World  Bank,  and  World  Trade  Organization.  The  United  States  and  Bangladesh
cooperate closely on security issues, ranging from counterterrorism to peacekeeping.
Human Rights and Terrorism in Bangladesh
Bangladesh's legal system is based on  common law, and its principal source of
laws  are  acts  of  Parliament.  Although  human  rights  are  enshrined  in  the  country's
constitution,  government  and  security  forces  have  been  known  to  flout  constitutional
principles  and  have  been  accused  of  human  rights  abuses.  In  a  2017  Human  Rights
Report, the U.S. Department of State stated that the most significant human rights issues
included  extrajudicial  killings,  torture,  arbitrary  or  unlawful  detentions,  and  forced
disappearances  by  government  security  forces;  restrictions  on  civil  liberties,  including
freedom of speech, press, and the activities of nongovernmental organizations; a lack of
freedom  to  participate  in  the  political  process;  corruption;  violence  and  discrimination
based  on  gender,  religious  affiliation,  caste,  tribe,  including  indigenous  persons;
trafficking in persons; and restrictions on worker’s rights and the worst forms of child labor.
In addition to the usual criminal activities of some persons in the society, several
anti-Western Islamic terrorist groups have engaged in a variety of attacks against diverse
groups  and  individuals,  including  students,  Hindus,  Buddhists,  Christians,  Shia,  and
secular  bloggers.  Americans  have  not  been  specifically  targeted  for  terrorist  activity
simply because they are Americans, but there is a current terrorist threat of attack against
Westerners  in  Bangladesh.  Counter-terrorism  raids  have  been  conducted  by  the
government. The U.S. Department of State has assessed Dhaka and Chittagong as being
high-threat locations for crime and terrorist activity, including such activity directed at or
affecting official U.S. government interests.
Although Applicant’s family members resided well outside (more than 200 miles)
the two cited areas of heightened risk, some of them moved several years ago to one of
those areas.4
Applicant’s Travel to Bangladesh
Since becoming a U.S. citizen, Applicant has traveled to Bangladesh  on at least six
occasions,  visiting  his  family  members  for  periods  of  up  to  21  days  each.  He  was  never
contacted by or had any contact with any person known or suspected of being involved  or
associated  with  foreign  intelligence,  terrorists,  security,  or  military  organizations.  He  was
never in contact with anyone exhibiting excessive knowledge or undue interest in him or his
job.  He  was  not  in  contact  with  anyone  attempting  to  obtain  classified  information  or
unclassified, sensitive information. He was never threatened, coerced, or pressured in any
way to cooperate with a foreign government official or foreign intelligence or security service.
He was never threatened, coerced, pressured, put under duress or blackmailed because of
relatives, friends, or other contacts living in Bangladesh.5
Financial Considerations6
It is unclear when Applicant first started having financial difficulties,  although he
acknowledged that during an unspecified period leading up to October 2007, a business
with his personal guarantees went under. As a result, in October 2007, Applicant and his
wife  filed  a  joint  petition  for  bankruptcy  under  Chapter  7  of  the  U.S.  Bankruptcy  Code
citing  $242,800  in  creditors  holding  secured  claims;  and  $602,402  in  creditors  holding
unsecured  nonpriority  claims,  totaling  $845,202  in  total  liabilities.  On  May  6,  2008,
Applicant’s  debts  were  discharged.7  In  January  2016,  when  completing  his  e-QIP,
Applicant  denied  any  financial  issues  such  as  delinquencies,  collections,  or  accounts
being charged off. In January 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator from the
U.S.  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM).  During  that  initial  interview,  Applicant
stated  that  since  his  bankruptcy  discharge,  he  re-established  his  credit,  and  that  his

financial status since the bankruptcy is stable. He added that he feels he is capable of
meeting his current financial obligations.8
During a subsequent OPM interview in December 2017, Applicant acknowledged
that  despite  the  bankruptcy  discharge,  he  still  owed  large  amounts  of  undocumented
money to family and friends. In addition, he was caring for his parents, resulting in multiple
overseas trips, and medical and living expenses for them. Because of the bankruptcy, he
continued  to  borrow  money  from  non-conventional  sources  with  high  interest  rates  to
keep  up  with  payments  and  living  expenses.  With  insufficient  funds  to  maintain  his
accounts, in September 2017, he engaged the professional services of a company that
performs  debt  negotiations  to  provide  debt  relief.9  Under  that  agreement,  Applicant
agreed  to  make  $1,514  in  monthly  payments  to  the  debt  company  commencing  on
October 6, 2017, and the debt company would attempt to negotiate debt relief regarding
23 different accounts totaling $117,230.10 Applicant did not submit any documentation,
such as cancelled checks, bank statements, receipts, etc., to indicate that any monthly
payments were made to the debt company, or that any payments were made by Applicant
or the debt company to any of Applicant’s creditors.
At  the  end  of  his  December  2017  interview,  Applicant  was  questioned  about  a
substantial  number  of  cash  transactions,  each  in  excess  of  $10,000,  that  were  made
throughout the period 2005 through 2017 at various casinos in several states. Applicant
was  reluctant  to  answer  questions  regarding  the  casinos,  and  specifically  refused  to
answer questions pertaining to the frequent transactions. He did, however, acknowledge
that since he was struggling financially, and he felt he was good at gambling, he did so to
win money to help pay his debts. He acknowledged that “sometimes he won,” implying
that most of  the  time he  lost.  Applicant  gambles  as  a  hobby  and for fun  to perfect  his
skills. He denied having issues with gambling. He denied that gambling ever created any
financial problems for him. Furthermore, Applicant was unsure if he will continue to visit
casinos in the future.11
In addition to Applicant’s Chapter 7 Bankruptcy (SOR ¶ 2.b.); his enrollment in a
debt relief program covering $117,230 in debts (SOR ¶ 2.c.); and his casino  gambling
activities  (SOR  ¶  2.a.),  described  above,  the  SOR  identified eight delinquent  accounts
that had been placed for collection or charged off as generally reflected by Applicant’s
February  2016  or June  2018  credit  reports. Those debts,  total  approximately  $57,027.
Among the list of creditors the debt company was supposed to contact, are some of the
SOR-related accounts. There are also a substantial number of accounts in that list, most

of  which  had  balances  between  $3,000  and  $12,000,  which  were  not  alleged  in  the
SOR.12
Applicant’s  outstanding  financial  obligations  alleged  in  the  SOR,  all  of  which
Applicant simply denied in his Answer to the SOR, but essentially acknowledged to the
debt company, are as follows: an  unspecified type of account for $6,551, but listed for
$10,647 in his creditor list (SOR ¶ 2.d.); a credit card for $1,564 that was charged off, but
listed for $715 in his creditor list (SOR ¶ 2.e.); a credit card for $8,129 that was charged
off, but listed for $6,471 in his creditor list (SOR ¶ 2.f.); a credit card for $5,296 that was
charged off, but listed for $4,135 in his creditor list (SOR ¶ 2.g.); a credit card for $1,929,
but listed for $1,277 in his creditor list (SOR ¶ 2.h.); an unspecified type of account for
$755 that was past due in the amount of $196 (SOR ¶ 2.i.); an unspecified type of account
for $3,760 that was charged off, but listed for $3,614 in his creditor list (SOR ¶ 2.j.); and
an unspecified type of account for $22,492 that was charged off, but listed for $22,044 in
his creditor list (SOR ¶ 2.k.).13
In September 2017, Applicant submitted a Personal Financial Summary to his debt
company.  It  indicated  that  his  monthly  take-home-pay  was  $9,000;  monthly  expenses
were  $7,406,  not  including  his  debt  company  program  payments;  leaving  a  monthly
remainder of $1,695 if no such program payments were made, or $81 if those program
payments  were  made,  available for discretionary  saving  or spending.14  It  is not  known
what Applicant’s current financial resources may be because he did not report his current
net  monthly  income;  monthly  expenses;  and  any  monthly  remainder  that  might  be
available for discretionary spending or savings. There is no evidence of a budget. Except
for an acknowledgment that he had received credit counseling associated with his 2007
bankruptcy, there is no indication that subsequent financial counseling from a legitimate
and credible source had been received. As noted above, during his initial OPM interview,
Applicant  stated  that  since  his  bankruptcy  discharge,  he  re-established  his  credit,  and
that his financial status since the bankruptcy  was stable. He added that he felt he was
capable  of  meeting  his  current  financial  obligations.  Facts  developed  following  that
12 Unalleged conduct can be considered for certain purposes, as discussed by the DOHA Appeal
Board. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: (a) to assess an applicant's credibility; (b) to
evaluate  an  applicant's  evidence  of  extenuation,  mitigation,  or  changed  circumstances;  (c)  to  consider
whether  an  applicant  has  demonstrated  successful  rehabilitation;  (d)  to  decide  whether  a  particular

"Applicant partially admitted and denied the SOR allegation in ¶ 1.a. He admitted
the  SOR allegations  in  ¶¶  1.b  and 1.c.  He denied  the  SOR  allegation  in ¶ 1.d.  After a
thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following
findings of fact.
Applicant is 51 years old. He married in 1990 and divorced in 1998. He has a 29-
year old son from this marriage. He remarried in 2002 and divorced in 2010. He remarried
in 2013. He and his wife have a seven-year-old son. He served in the U.S. Air Force from
1990 to 1992 and received a General Discharge under Honorable Conditions. He served
in the Army National Guard for one year and received an Honorable Discharge. He served
in  the  Army  from  2003  to  2011  and  received  a  General  Discharge  under  Honorable
Conditions.  Applicant  has  worked  for  a  federal  contractor  since  January  2016.  He
currently works in South Korea. (Item 4)
Applicant’s wife is a citizen and resident of South Korea. His younger son was born
in South Korea and is dual citizen of South Korea and the United States. Applicant met
his wife while serving in the military in South Korea. Applicant, his wife, and son presently
live  in  South  Korea.  He  and  his  wife  intend  to  relocate  to  the  United  States  after  he
completes  his  employment  in  South  Korea.  They  also  intend  on  her  applying  for  U.S.
citizenship status once they relocate. During his February 2017 background interview, he
disclosed  that  his  wife  was  unemployed.  He  noted  that  she  had  no  affiliation  with  the
South  Korean  government,  military,  security,  defense  industry,  foreign  movement,  or
intelligence service. (Item 5)
Applicant’s  mother-in-law  and  father-in-law  are  citizens  and  residents  of  South
Korea. His wife’s two sisters and brother are citizens and residents of South Korea.  He
stated his contact with his wife’s parents is about once a month when they come to visit
them. His contact with his wife’s siblings is about every three months. His mother-in-law
has never been employed outside of the home. His father-in-law works for a corporation.
His brother-in-law works on a U.S. military base. The occupations of the two sisters-in-
law is unknown. (Items 3, 5)
Applicant’s  wife  formerly  owned  an  apartment  in  South  Korea  that  she  had
purchased before she married. Her parents and brother lived in the apartment. The loan
for the apartment was transferred to her brother. Her brother is now the primary person
responsible  for  the  loan,  and  Applicant’s  wife  no  longer  has  any  responsibility  or
ownership rights in the apartment. (Item 3; AE A, B, C).
The Republic of Korea (South Korea)
South  Korea  is  a  constitutional  democracy  governed  by  a  president  and
unicameral  legislature.  Recent  presidential  elections  were  considered  free  and  fair.
Civilian  authorities  maintain  effective  control  over  security  forces.  The  most  significant
human  rights  issues  were  the  government’s  interpretation  and  application  of  National
Security Law, libel laws, and other laws that limited freedom of expression and restricted
Internet access; corruption, and domestic violence.
The United States Department of State has accessed the cities of Seoul and Busan
as  being  low-threat  locations  for  terrorist  activity  directed  at  or  affecting  official  U.S.
government interests. It noted that while Americans are subject to worldwide threats of
international terrorism,  there  is  no  specific  information  to  suggest  any  specific terrorist
threats directed at Americans or American interests in  South Korea. In addition, South
Korea is the host to approximately 28,500 U.S. troops.
South Korea has made significant strides in terms of its protection of intellectual
property rights. It cooperates with U.S. law enforcement to aggressively pursue criminal
investigations and to seize counterfeit goods, including luxury items. Industrial espionage,
however, remains a high-profile concern. There are reported criminal cases in the past of
industrial  espionage  and  violations  of  export  control  laws.  South  Korea  has  been  the
unauthorized recipient of technology controlled under the U.S. export control laws.

"In  his  response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations.
Applicant is approximately 34 years old,1 and he was born in South Sudan. In 1993, when
he was approximately 8 years old, he left South Sudan and travelled to a refugee camp
with his older brother. He is considered to be one of the “Lost Boys of Sudan.”2 At the end
of  1993,  Applicant’s  uncle,  a  Catholic  priest,  took  Applicant  and  his  brother  out  of  the
refugee camp to raise them. Applicant received a scholarship and attended a boarding
school in Nairobi, Kenya. (Tr. 21-29, 87; AE A, AE B, AE C, AE D, AE E, AE H)
In May 2007, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services notified Applicant that
his  request  for  refugee  status  had  been  approved  under  Section  207(a)  of  the  U.S.
Immigration  and  Nationality  Act.  On  August  6,  2007,  Applicant  arrived  in  the  United
States.  His  airfare  was  paid  by  the  Church  World  Service.  His  only  requirement  upon
arrival to the U.S. was to register for Selective Service, which Applicant accomplished.
(Tr. 21-29, 87; AE A, AE B, AE C, AE D, AE E, AE H)
After arriving in the U.S., Applicant immediately sought full time employment and
attended school. During his employment as a caregiver for individuals with developmental
disabilities, Applicant received an award as employee of the month, and in 2010, he was

from college with a bachelor of science in electrical engineering. (Tr. 33-39; AE K)
In 2013, Applicant took a trip to Kenya, Uganda and South Sudan. This is the only
trip he has taken to visit South Sudan. He used his U.S. passport for travel and disclosed
all travel information on his SCA. He stayed for approximately two weeks in his city of
birth visiting his mother, sister and five brothers. After he returned to the U.S., Applicant
moved to another state to start his career as an engineer. He took a position in August
2016 with his current employer, a Federal contractor.
Applicant is required to attend security training at his place of employment, even
though he does not currently possess a DOD security clearance. Applicant has learned
that if an individual expresses any special interest in his work duties, he will immediately
report that information to his facility security officer. No one, including his family members
in  South  Sudan,  have  asked  any  detailed  questions  about  his  work  with  a  Federal
contractor. If any of his family members were threatened due to his status as a U.S. citizen
or  DOD  contractor,  Applicant  would  also  immediately  report  that  information  to  his
security officer. (Tr. 39-49, 84-85)
Applicant makes approximately $91,000 annually. He is financially stable and pays
his student loans, car payment, and monthly bills. He also repaid his airfare expense to

SOR ¶ 1.a alleges that Applicant’s mother is citizen and resident of South Sudan.
The SOR also alleges that he has five brothers and a sister, who are also citizens and
residents of South Sudan. (SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c.) He admitted these allegations. Applicant
calls  one  of  his  family  members  approximately  every  three  weeks.  His  mother  is
approximately 68, and she currently resides with two of his brothers in a single room hut
in a village. His mother has no formal education and is a subsistence farmer. Applicant’s
family have no connection to the government or military of South Sudan. (Tr. 84, 88
The  two  brothers  who  reside  with  Applicant’s  mother  provide  for  her  needs  as
farmers. Since he graduated from college, Applicant has provided financial support for
his mother. In 2014 he sent his family $1,985. In 2015, he sent $8,330, which was money
for his mother and for a brother who wanted to finish his college education. In 2016 he
sent  $252;  in  2017  he  sent  $255;  and  in  2018  he  sent  $775.  In  addition,  whenever
Applicant is overseas for work, he sends about $200 to $300 every three months to family
members. Applicant reported all pertinent information on his SCA and to the authorized
DOD  investigator  during  his  background  interview.  He  does  not  have  any  financial
interests in South Sudan. (Tr. 62- 66, 71-77; GE 2, GE 3; AE V)
Applicant  expressed  his  desire  to  serve  the  United  States  because  this  country
gave him a new beginning. He believes that working with a company that provides secure
facilities for Americans around the world is a good opportunity for him to give back to this
country.  Applicant  considers  himself  to  be  100  percent  loyal  to  the  United  States  of
America. (Tr. 77-78, 91)
Administrative Notice – South Sudan3
South  Sudan  became  an  independent  nation  in  July  2011.  Shortly  thereafter,
conflict broke out between the government and the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-
North in states of Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile (together known as the Two Areas),
which  resulted  in  1.1  million  internally  displaced  persons  or  severely  affected  persons
needing humanitarian assistance. A separate conflict broke out in the western region of
Darfur  in  2003,  displacing  nearly  2  million  people  and  causing  thousands  of  deaths.
Fighting  in  both  the  Two  Areas  and  Darfur  has  largely  subsided,  however  the  civilian
populations are affected by low-level violence including inter-tribal conflict and banditry,
largely a result of weak rule of law. The United Nations (UN) and the African Union have
(UNAMID)  since  2007.
jointly  commanded  a  Darfur  peacekeeping  operation
Peacekeeping troops have struggled to address insecurity in Darfur and have increasingly
become targets for attacks by armed groups. Sudan also has faced refugee influxes from
neighboring  countries,  primarily  Ethiopia,  Eritrea,  Chad,  Central  African  Republic,  and
South Sudan. Armed conflict, poor transport infrastructure, and denial of access by both
the  government  and  armed  opposition  have  impeded  the  provision  of  humanitarian
assistance  to  affected  populations.  Of  note,  in  June  2018,  the  United  States  State
Department reported South Sudan travel advisory at:
Level 4 – Do not travel to South Sudan due to crime and armed conflict.
Violent  crime,  such  as  carjackings,  shootings,  ambushes,  assaults,
robberies, and kidnappings is common throughout South Sudan, including
Juba. Armed conflict is ongoing throughout the country and includes fighting
between  various  political  and  ethnic  groups,  and  weapons  are  readily
available to the population.
The  UN,  human  rights  organizations,  and media  reported  the  government or  its
agents committed arbitrary or unlawful killings. Security forces, opposition forces, armed
militias  affiliated  with  the  government  and  the  opposition,  and  ethnically  based  groups
were  also  responsible  for  extrajudicial  killings  in  conflict  zones.4  South  Sudan  is  not
known for intelligence collection efforts against the United States or U.S. citizens.

university  in  India.  He  was  born  in  India,  came  to  the  United  States  in  1995,  and  was
naturalized in 2008. His spouse is a citizen of India, and is a permanent resident of the
United States. (GX 1) She is applying for U.S. citizenship next month. (Tr. 13) Applicant
and  his  wife  have  two  children  who  were  born  in  the  United  States.  (Tr.  24)  He  has
renounced  his Indian  citizenship.  He  does  possess  an  Overseas Citizen  of  India  Card
(OIC) card from India, which is used as a visa. He carries a U.S. passport. (Tr. 19) Since

Applicant  visited  India  about  eight  times  from  2009  to  2016.  His  two  children
needed speech therapy as they are not verbal and have special needs. In India they were
able to attend speech therapy six days a week.  Applicant, his wife and children stayed
for seven months. Applicant has otherwise visited his family about every other year. (Tr.

voted in any Indian elections.
In 1998, Applicant and his wife purchased property in India, with an estimated total
value  of  approximately  $360,000.  (Tr.  30)    He  and  his  wife  own  three  houses  and  an
apartment. Applicant fully disclosed all possible financial interests in India on his security
clearance.  He  believes  the  property  has  devalued  about  15  to  20  percent.  (Tr.  26)
Applicant is in the process of liquidating the properties except for one home for his mother
to live in. Applicant stated that one house is in the process of being sold and that there is
an  agreement  in  place  with  a  deposit.  (Tr.26)  Applicant  decided  to  sell  the  properties
because he does not intend to return to India. (GX 2)
Applicant  provided  loans  for  his  family  over  the  years  estimated  to  be  about
$125,000. He stated that most of the loans have been repaid. His cousin used the money
to send his son to university. (Answer) One cousin started a business with $30,000 that
Applicant loaned him in 2009. (Tr.15)
Applicant and his wife currently own a house in the United States that is worth
about $615,000. (Tr. 49) His current salary is about $225,000. He approximates assets
in a value of about a million dollars. (Tr.50) He and his wife want to settle in his current
state as they want their two children to receive a fine education.  He was emphatic that
the United States is home now and forever.
Applicant’s wife speaks to her mother, who has always been a homemaker, every
other  day.  (Tr.  33)  Applicant’s  mother-in-law  visited  the  United  States  in  2007  when
Applicant’s child was born. He communicates randomly with his wife’s sisters, and his two
brothers-in-law.  They  work  in  private  business  and  have  no  connections  to  the  Indian
government. None of his wife’s family know about his work. (GX 2)
Applicant  stated  that  his  wife  knows  about  the  security  clearance  process.  He
repeatedly stated that his oath of allegiance to the United States is one that he does not
take lightly. He votes in U.S. elections. Nothing could compel him to do something against
the United States.
Administrative Notice (Republic of India)
In response to the Government’s request, to which Applicant did not object, I have
taken administrative notice of the following relevant facts about the Republic of India:
  The  2000  and  2008  Annual  Reports  to  Congress  on  Foreign  Economic
Collection  and  Industrial  Espionage  identified  India  as  being  involved  in
economic collection and industrial espionage.

In June 2013, a member of parliament in India and a close advisor to a now-
deceased chief minister was among those indicted by the U.S. Department of
Justice for allegedly soliciting bribes for himself and other government officials
in India in return for approving licenses to mine titanium minerals.
  As  of  March  2016,  India  continued  to  experience  terrorist  and  insurgent
activities. Anti-Western terrorist groups active in India, some of which are on
the  U.S.  government’s  list  of  foreign  terrorist  organizations,  include  Islamist
extremist  groups  Harkat-ul-Jihad,  Harakat  ul-Mujahidin,  Indian  Myjahideen,
Jaish-e-Mohammed, and Lashker-e Tayyiba.
  As  of  2015,  the  most  significant  human  rights  problems  involved  police  and
security  force  abuses,  including  extrajudicial  killings,  torture,  and  rape;
corruption  remained  widespread  and  contributed  to  ineffective  responses  to
crimes, including those against women, children, and members of scheduled
castes or tribes, and societal violence based on gender, religious affiliation, and
caste  or  tribe.  Other  human  rights  problems  included  disappearances,
hazardous prison conditions, arbitrary arrest and detention, and lengthy pretrial
detention. A lack of accountability for misconduct at all levels of government
persisted, contributing to widespread impunity.
Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.2 As noted
by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent standard
indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of
denials.”3  Under  Egan,  Executive  Order  10865,  and  the  Directive,  any  doubt  about
whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved
in favor of protecting national security.
2 Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (“it should be obvious that no one has a ‘right’ to
a security clearance”); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no right to a
security clearance).
3 484 U.S. at 531.
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a  security  clearance  for  access  to  confidential,  secret,  or  top-secret  information.4  An
unfavorable  clearance  decision  (1)  denies  any  application,  (2)  revokes  any  existing
security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.5
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.6 The Government has the burden of presenting evidence
to  establish  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR  that  have  been  controverted.7  An  applicant  is
responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that
have  been  admitted  or  proven.8  In  addition,  an  applicant  has  the  ultimate  burden  of
persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.9
In  Egan,  the  Supreme  Court  stated  that  the  burden  of  proof  is  less  than  a
preponderance of evidence.10 The Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and
a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.11
Guideline B (Foreign Influence)
Discussion
The security concern under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) is set out in AG ¶ 6,
as follows:
Foreign  contacts  and  interests,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  business,
financial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result
in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they
create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced
to  help  a    foreign  person,  group,  organization,  or  government  in  a  way
inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure
or  coercion  by  any  foreign  interest.  Assessment  of  foreign  contacts  and
interests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest
is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether it is

known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or
is associated with a risk of terrorism.
Four disqualifying conditions under this Guideline are relevant:
AG  ¶  7(a):  contact,  regardless  of  method,  with  a  foreign  family  member,
business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen
of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk
of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;
AG ¶ 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country
that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual’s obligation
to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual’s desire to
help  a foreign   person,  group,  or country  by  providing  that  information  or
technology;
AG  ¶  7(e)  shared  living  quarters  with  a  person  or  persons,  regardless  of
citizenship  status,  if  that  relationship  creates  a  heightened  risk  of  foreign
inducement , manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and
AG ¶ 7(f): substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign
country, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, that could
subject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation
or personal conflict of interest.
Applicant’s close family ties to his mother, sisters and  members of his wife’s family
who are a citizens and residents of India, and his financial interest in India establish AG
¶¶  7(a),  7(b),  7(e),  and  7(f).    A  “heightened  risk”  is  associated  with  India,  given  the
significant human rights and terrorism problems existent there, and its history of economic
collection and industrial espionage.
Application of Guideline B is not a comment on an applicant’s patriotism but merely
an acknowledgment that people may act in unpredictable ways when faced with choices
that could be important to a loved one, such as a family member.12 Family relationships
can involve matters of influence or obligation.13 Therefore, Applicant’s family ties with his
wife’s family, property ownership, and other financial interests in India raise concerns for
which he has the burden of persuasion to mitigate.14
12 ISCR Case No. 08-10025 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2009).
13 ISCR Case No. 02-04786 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2003).
14 ISCR Case No. 99-0532 at 7 (App. Bd. Dec. 15, 2000) (When an applicant’s ties in a foreign country raise
a prima facie security concern, the applicant is required to present evidence  of rebuttal,  extenuation, or
mitigation sufficient to carry his burden of persuasion that it is “clearly consistent with the national interest”
to grant or continue a security clearance on his behalf).
The following mitigating conditions under this Guideline are potentially relevant:
AG ¶ 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country
in  which  these  persons  are  located,  or  the positions  or activities  of  those
persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed
in  a  position  of  having  to  choose  between  the  interests  of  a  foreign
individual,  group,  organization,  or  government  and  the  interests  of  the
United States;
AG  ¶  8(b):  there  is  no  conflict  of  interest,  either  because  the  individual’s
sense of loyalty or allegiance to the foreign person, group, government, or
country  is  so  minimal,  or  the  individual  has  such  deep  and  longstanding
relationships  and  loyalties  in  the  United  States  that  the  individual can  be
expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U. S. interest;
AG ¶ 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and
infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign
influence or exploitation; and
AG ¶ 8(f): the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or
property  interests  is  such  that  they  are  unlikely  to  result  in  a  conflict  and
could  not  be  used  effectively  to  influence,  manipulate,  or  pressure  the
individual.
For the reasons set out in the discussion of AG ¶¶ 7(a), 7(b), 7(e) and 7(f), above,
AG ¶ 8(a) is not established for the following reasons. Applicant has lived in the United
States since 1999. He was naturalized in 2009. His wife is a permanent resident of the
U.S.  who  will become a  U.S.  citizen.  He  has  two  special  needs  children  who  are  U.S.
citizens. Applicant visits his mother on a regular basis. None of his family or in-laws have
connections to the Indian government.
Applicant has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.
that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.
There is little likelihood that Applicant’s communications with his mother could create a
risk for foreign influence or exploitation. Applicant’s Indian bank accounts are dormant for
the most part. He will sell the Indian property that he and his wife own as soon as he is
able. His brother in India is handling the affair. His financial status in the United States far
outweighs the financial interests in India. His Indian property is not worth as much as his
liquid  assets  in  the  United  States.    Applicant  has  substantial  retirement  and  savings
accounts in the United States. He owns a home in the United States.  Applicant’s property
interest in India are such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used
effectively  to  influence,  manipulate,  or  pressure  the  individual.  I  find  that  mitigating
conditions AG ¶¶ 8(b), 8(c), and  8(f) apply.
Conclusion
The  record  does  not  create  doubt  about  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,
good judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I
weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed
the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person
concept.15 Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant met his ultimate burden of persuasion
to  show  that  it  is  clearly  consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  him  eligibility  for
access to classified information.
As required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following
formal findings on the SOR allegations:
Paragraph 1, Guideline B:
For Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.g:                    For Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to
grant Applicant access to classified information.

"In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  two  of  the  allegations,  with
explanations  (SOR  ¶¶1.a-1.b).  He  denied  the  remaining  allegation  (SOR  ¶1.c).  His
admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review
of the evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 31 years old. He was born in Afghanistan in 1987. He immigrated to
Pakistan when he was five years old with his mother and two siblings. He immigrated to
the United States in September 2001. He became a U.S. citizen in 2007. He received
two  bachelor’s  degrees  and  a  master’s  degree  from  U.S.  universities.  He  is  employed
by  a  government  agency  and  also  works  part  time  as  a  government  contractor,  which
requires a security clearance. He and his wife are expecting their first child. His wife is a
native U.S. citizen. He possesses only a U.S. passport.3
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant’s  brother  is  a  dual  citizen  of  Afghanistan  and
Russia,  residing  in  Russia.  It  also  alleged  Applicant  has  multiple  family  members  who
are  citizens  and  residents  of  Afghanistan  (one  is  an  “Attorney  General”  of  a  province

Applicant is a homeowner who is current on his monthly mortgage payment. He
has  approximately  $40,000  of  equity  in  his  home,  which  has  a  loan  amount  of
approximately  $460,000.  His  financial  statement  lists  bank  savings  of  approximately
$44,000  and  retirement  savings  of  approximately  $16,000.  He  owns  no  property  in
Afghanistan.  He  is  a  registered  voter  in  this  country.  His  mother,  one  brother,  and  a
sister  are  residents  and  citizens  of  the  United  States.  He  has  not  provided  financial
support to any relatives outside of the United States, nor has he received any financial
support.4
In  2016,  Applicant  established  a  family  chat  site  through  social  media  at  the
request  of his  mother  so  she  could  stay  in  touch  with  her  family members. The  site  is
set  up  so  that  once  a  person  becomes  a  member  of  the  group,  then  the  person  has
access to all the comments of the other group members. Applicant stated he is not that
active  on  the  site.  He  will  assist  his  mother  when  she  wants  to access  it, and  he  may
post  a  response  to  something  that  his  mother  wants  him  to  address.  For  example,
sending  congratulations  at  the  birth  of  a  child,  birthday  wishes,  etc.  Not  all  family
members  have  joined  the  group. This  chat  site  is  the  primary means  by  which  he  has
contact  with  his  relatives  residing  outside  the  United  States.  Applicant  traveled  to
Afghanistan  in  2013  with  his  mother  to  visit  relatives.  He  stayed  approximately  one
month. This is the only time he traveled to Afghanistan since leaving as a child. He has
no future plans to return.5

Applicant’s brother (SZ) is a citizen and resident of Russia (SOR ¶1.a). Applicant
does  not  know  if  he  is  still  a  citizen  of  Afghanistan.  During  the  Taliban  governance  of
Afghanistan, SZ intervened to stop the beating of a young girl. Because of his actions,
he  was  forced  to  leave  Afghanistan  and  fled  to  Russia.  He  remains  in  Russia  with  his
family.  He  owns  a  business  there.  He  has  no  contact  or  affiliation  with  the  Russian
government or the military. In 2009, Applicant’s mother sponsored SZ and his family for
alien  residency  status  in  the  United  States.  Their  petition  is  currently  pending,  but  the
backlog  is  significant.  Applicant  last  saw  SZ  in  the  summer  of  2018  when  he  visited
Russia to attend the World Cup. He stayed with his brother for about 10 days.18
Applicant’s  cousin  (AD)  (subject  of  SOR  ¶1.c)  is  now  a  resident  of  Canada.  He
received  a  work  permit  in  July  2018.  He  intends  to  reside  there.  Department  Counsel
conceded that AD no longer posed security concerns under Guideline B.19
Character Evidence.
Applicant supplied character references and work performance appraisals. In his
appraisal  he  was  rated  as  “exceeds  expectations.”  His  supervisors  and  colleagues
describe  him  as  honest,  trustworthy,  reliable,  and  transparent.  They  recommend
granting his clearance.20

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions
are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 60-year-old linguist employed by a defense contractor since June
2017. He worked as a linguist for other defense contractors from July 2003 to July 2011.
He received a security clearance in November 2004.
Applicant  was  born  in  Lebanon.  He  enrolled  in  the  Lebanese  Army  Military
Academy in 1980 but resigned in 1981 when its pilot training program was discontinued.
He came to the United States in November 1982 on a student visa. He graduated from a
U.S.  university  in  June  1984  and  returned  to  Lebanon.2  He  married  a  U.S.  citizen  in
November 1985 and came to the United States on a marriage visa in September 1988.
He divorced in November 1988 but remained in the United States and became a U.S.
citizen in November 1991.
Applicant  returned  to  Lebanon  in  September  2003  and  married  a  citizen  and
resident  of  Lebanon.  He  returned  to  the  United  States  in  April  2009.  He  divorced  his
second wife in November 2015. He has two children from his second marriage, ages 13
and 10, for whom he pays child support of $530 per month. He calls his children about

three times a week to check on their well-being and school progress. (FORM Item 7 at
6.) His children are U.S. citizens and live with their mother, who is a lawyer in Lebanon.
Applicant returned to Lebanon in June 2011 to care for his ailing mother, a citizen
and resident of Lebanon. He was unemployed while in Lebanon. He returned to the United
States in December 2016 and was unemployed until February 2017. His mother passed
away in August 2018. His father passed away before he submitted his SCA.
Applicant  has  two  sisters,  ages  55  and  51,  who  are  citizens  and  residents  of
Lebanon. His sisters are married. The older sister owns a shoe store. The younger sister
is  a  housewife  who  is  not  employed  outside  the  home.  (FORM  Item  7  at  6.)  The
occupations  of  their  husbands  are  not  reflected  in  the  record.  During  Applicant’s
unemployment,  he  borrowed  about  $50,000  from  his  older  sister  for  living  expenses.
When his mother was alive, he talked to his sisters weekly because they cared for his
mother. The record does not reflect the frequency of his contact with his sisters now that
his mother has passed away.
At  the  request  of  Department  Counsel,  I  have  taken  administrative  notice  that
.
Lebanon  is  a  parliamentary  republic.  It  apportions  governmental  authority  among  a
Maronite  Christian  president,  a  Shia  speaker  of  the  parliaments,  and  a  Sunni  prime
minister. A president was elected in October 2016. Parliamentary elections in 2009 were
considered  by  observers  to  be  peaceful,  fair,  and  free  from  regional  influences,  but
subsequent elections have been postponed repeatedly since 2013.
I have taken notice that the U.S. Department of State discourages U.S. nationals
from  traveling  to  Lebanon  due  to  crime,  terrorism,  and  armed  conflict.  Kidnapping  for
ransom, political motives or as a result of family disputes is a serious problem. Several
terrorist  groups  operate  in  Lebanon  and  control  areas  in  the  Bekaa  Valley,  southern
Lebanon, and south Beirut. Palestinian refugee camps remain outside the jurisdiction of
local security forces and pose a security threat due to potential militant recruitment and
terrorist infiltration.
I  have  also  taken  administrative  notice  of  significant  human  rights  issues  in
Lebanon,  including  arbitrary  or  unlawful  killings  by  government  forces  and  non-state
actors and torture by security forces. I have taken notice of the Lebanese government’s
violation  of  citizens’  privacy  rights;  restrictions  of  freedom  of  speech,  press,  and
assembly;  lack  of  governmental  action  to  investigate  abuse  of  refugees;  and  limits  on
political participation through repeatedly postponed elections and official corruption.
The SOR alleges three delinquent debts reflected in credit reports from July 2017
(FORM  Item  4)  and  June  2018  (FORM  Item  5),  a  personal  debt  disclosed  during  the
background  investigation  (FORM  Item  4),  and  a  federal  income  tax  debt  disclosed  in
Applicant’s  SCA  (FORM  Item  3)  and  in  his  answer  to  the  SOR  (FORM  Item  4).  The
evidence concerning these debts is summarized below.
SOR ¶¶ 2.a and 2.b: credit-card accounts charged off in May 2013 and June
2017 and placed for collection of $7,976 and $5,278. In Applicant’s answer to the SOR,
he attributed these debts to overspending by his second ex-wife. He stated that he has a
lawyer who is was negotiating with the creditors. He submitted no documentary evidence
of negotiations, payment agreements, payments, or other resolution of these debts.
SOR  ¶  2.c:  cellphone  bill  placed  for  collection  of  $57  in  July  2017.  In
Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  attributed  this  debt  to  miscommunication  with  the
provider  during  an  overseas  deployment.  He  stated  that  the  issue  is  resolved  and  he
continues  to  receive  service  from  the  same  provider.  He  provided  no  documentary
evidence of the status of this debt.
SOR ¶ 2.d: debts totaling $50,000 to sister, accumulated between 2011 and
2016. Applicant’s sister has not imposed a due date for repayment. Applicant asserts that
he will eventually repay it. (FORM Item 6 at 3.)
SOR ¶ 2.e: federal income tax debt for $39,000. When Applicant submitted his
SCA, he disclosed that he had failed to file his federal and state income tax returns for
2012  or  pay  the  taxes  due,  that  he  had  failed  to  file  his  federal  and  state  income  tax
returns for 2014, and that he failed to file his return or pay the federal income taxes due
for 2015. He estimated that he owed $15,000 for 2012, nothing for 2014, and $12,000 for
2015.  In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  submitted  documentation  that  he  had  a  payment
agreement with the IRS in 2012 for monthly $250 payments, but he submitted no evidence
that he had made any payments. He attached tax notices to his answer, reflecting that he
owed  federal  income  taxes  of  $645  for  2008;  $8,814  for  2009;  $5,687  for  2010;  and
$5,913 for 2011. He attached a copy of a federal income tax return for 2017, prepared by
a professional tax preparer, reflecting that he was entitled to a refund of $6,019, but he
submitted no evidence showing that the return was filed. He stated that he had a lawyer
who was negotiating with the IRS, but he submitted no evidence of payment agreements,
payments, or other resolution of his tax debts.
Applicant  earned  about  $160,000  per  year  as  a  linguist  in  2007  through  2010.
(FORM  Item  7  at  8.)  He  submitted  no  evidence  of  his  current  income  and  expenses.
Although he stated that he was working with a lawyer and an accountant to resolve his
financial problems, he provided no evidence of financial counseling.

"Applicant is a 37-year-old engineer for a defense contractor. He has worked for
his  current  employer  since  2013.  He  has  held  a  top  secret  security  clearance  since
2014,  but  his  eligibility  for  access  to  sensitive  compartmented  information  (SCI)  was
denied in 2017. He has a bachelor’s degree, awarded in 2012, and a master’s degree,
awarded in 2015. He is married with one child.1
Applicant  was  born  in  Syria  to  Syrian  parents.  His  brother  immigrated  to  the
United States to attend a religious college and become a missionary. Applicant followed
his brother to the United States in 2003 and attended the same religious college as his
brother  for  three  years.  Applicant  obtained  his  bachelor’s  and  master’s  degrees  in  the
United States from a different U.S. college. He met his wife, a native-born U.S. citizen,
at the religious college. They married in 2007. Their child was born in the United States.
Applicant  became  a  U.S.  citizen  in  2012.  His  brother  is  also  a  U.S.  citizen  and
apparently still a Syrian citizen.2
Applicant’s parents and three additional siblings are Syrian citizens. His parents
and one of his siblings are residents of Syria. One sibling is a resident of Egypt, married
to an Egyptian citizen, and the last sibling is a resident of Austria, married to an Austrian
citizen.  Applicant’s  father  is  a  minister.  None  of  Applicant’s  family  has  any  direct
connection to the Syrian or Egyptian governments.3
Applicant has not returned to Syria since he left in 2003. He stated that he initially
did not return because he did not have the money for the trip, then his Syrian passport
expired in about 2007 or 2008, and then the civil war broke out and he had no desire to
return.  He  does  not  plan  to  ever  return  to  Syria.  His  brother  in  the  United  States  did
some missionary work in Syria, but he stopped going after the war began. Applicant and

his  brother  met  their  parents,  siblings,  and  siblings’  spouses  in  Lebanon  in  2015  for  a

Applicant  does  not  have  any  foreign  assets  in  Syria.  He  earns  more  than
$100,000  per  year.  He  gave  his  parents  $200  during  his  2015  trip.  That  is  his  only
financial support to his family in Syria.5
Applicant  did  not  appeal  the  denial  of  his  eligibility  for  access  to  SCI.  He
explained  that  he  was  not  working  on  a  program  that  required  SCI  access,  and  his
facility security officer and supervisor both told him that they had plenty of work for him
that only required a top secret clearance.6

"In his SOR response, Applicant denied the first two SOR allegations, SOR ¶¶ 1.a
and  1.b,  and  admitted  the  remaining  allegation,  SOR  ¶  1.c.  He  also  provided  some
additional  information.  I  have  incorporated  his  admissions  in  my  findings  of  fact.
Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  his  SCA,  FORM  Item  5,  and  a
November  2010  security  clearance  application  (2010  SCA),  FORM  Item  4,  unless
otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record.
Since 2004, Applicant, 60, has worked as a contractor in U.S. facilities in overseas
locations,  including  two  years  in  Beijing,  China  (2006-2008).  He  has  a  high  school
diploma. He was granted a security clearance in 2005, which was reviewed and continued
in 2010-11. (FORM response at 26-28.)
Applicant’s marital history is complicated, and his marital status has changed since
he  submitted  his  SCA  in  March  2016.  He  married  his first  wife,  a  U.S.-born  citizen,  in
1986. They divorced in 1995, but then remarried in 1999 only to separate a year later and
divorce again. They have three children, who are all adults at this time.
In  April  2008,  Applicant  married  a  Chinese  citizen  and  resident,  who  he  met  in
2007 while working in China. They dated in China for about six months until his security
officer imposed a cease and desist order, requiring Applicant to terminate all contact with
this woman or lose his clearance and job. He chose to stop seeing her, though when his
contract in China ended in October 2007, they reconnected and married in China in April
2008. Applicant’s second wife, who was 24 years old when they married, received her
visa to enter the United States in March 2009. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in
2014. They have one child, who was born in the United States in 2010. His wife had a
second child two years later. This child was fathered by an illegal immigrant from Latin
America, who the second wife met in an English class. Applicant’s wife had an ongoing
affair  with  this  person  since  2011.  The  second  child  has  Applicant’s  last  name,  and
Applicant refers to the child as his child. At one point, the lover of his second wife moved
into Applicant’s house while Applicant worked overseas. Applicant and his second wife
divorced in August 2017. She married her lover a week later. She has told Applicant that
once her new husband becomes a legal U.S. resident alien, she wants to divorce him and
remarry Applicant. (FORM response at 26; FORM Exhibit 7 at 2, 9; FORM Exhibit 6 at 2,
4; FORM Item 3 at 2, 4.)
Beginning in April 2009, the mother of Applicant’s second wife spent part of each
year  living  in  Applicant’s  marital  home  in  the  United  States.  At  that  time,  she  was  a
Chinese citizen and resident. After his 2008 marriage, Applicant provided his then mother-
in-law $330 per month of financial support. Applicant’s former father-in-law is a Chinese
citizen and resident. Applicant last saw him in 2009 when Applicant traveled to China to
bring his second wife to the United States after she received her U.S. visa. In his SOR
response,  he  wrote  that  he  stopped  the  payments  to  his  second  wife’s  mother  “years
ago,”  which  was  presumably  after  his  2016  SCA,  where  he  reported  the  support
payments. He also represents that his wife’s mother “has no current husband” and that
she has become a legal U.S. resident. (FORM Item 7 at 8-9; FORM Item 6 at 4, 5; FORM
Item 3 at 1.)
In  2011,  the  sister  of  Applicant’s  second  wife,  who  was  a  Chinese  citizen  and
resident at that time, entered the United States with her two children and spent time living
in Applicant’s marital home. In 2016, the sister-in-law married Applicant’s son from his
first  marriage.  Despite  Applicant’s  divorce,  the former sister-in-law  remains  Applicant’s
daughter-in-law and the former mother-in-law remains his son’s mother-in-law. The two
children of Applicant’s former sister-in-law’s are now his son’s stepchildren. (FORM Item
7 at 8-9; FORM Item 6 at 4, 5.)
In an April 2017 follow-up background interview, Applicant disclosed that a week
earlier he had met a Chinese woman over a Chinese-based online chat program. She is
a Chinese citizen, and she resided in China at that time. He met this woman online after
another  person  suggested  online  that  he  chat  with  her.  Applicant  did  not  identify  the
person who introduced them. He told the interviewer that if his divorce was finalized, he
was interested in having a relationship with this Chinese woman. He told the interviewer
that  he  does  not  know  anything  about  her  employment  or  relationship  to  the  Chinese
government, military, or intelligence service. (FORM Item 6 at 9.)
In November 2017, after his divorce from his second wife was official, Applicant
traveled  to  China  to  meet  his  new  romantic  interest.  Upon  his  return  a  week  later,  he
reported  to  his  security  official  in  an  email  that  he  intended  to  marry  her.  Applicant’s
remarriage  occurred  after  his  2016  SCA  and  his  January  and  April  2017  background
interviews. The date of their marriage does not appear in the record evidence. As a result,
the DOD CAF adjudicators were unaware of Applicant’s marriage to a second Chinese
citizen  and  resident.  Applicant’s  remarriage  to  a  Chinese  citizen  and  resident  is  not
alleged  in  the  SOR.  In  her  FORM,  Department  Counsel  declined  to  amend  the  SOR,
although she noted that Applicant’s marriage to another Chinese citizen is relevant to the
issue  of  mitigation  and  the  facts  set  forth  in  SOR  ¶  1.c  about  his  efforts  to  seek  out
relationships with Chinese citizens. (FORM Response at 2-8; FORM at 5.)
Applicant’s third wife is 48 years old and has a 20-year-old child, who is a student
in a Chinese technological institute. Applicant pays her school expenses.  His new wife
presently lives with him at his job location in Africa while he sponsors her to become a
U.S. resident alien. Before they married, his wife was a general manager of an insurance
company in China. Everything the U.S. Government knows about this woman is limited
to some details in his FORM response. (FORM Item 6 at 9; FORM response at 2, 4, 9,
10-13, 22, 26-27; FORM Item 3 at 1.)
In  his  SOR  response,  Applicant  admitted  the  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  1.c  that  he
regularly uses a Chinese  online chat program to meet and communicate with Chinese
citizens. In his April 2017 background interview, he reported contact with the woman who
would become his third wife and three other women. Women in China would contact him
using  a  search  function  in  the  chat  program.  The  contacts  with  these  women  were
typically of a limited duration. In his SOR response, he wrote that he now uses a different
Chinese chat system, which he uses to stay in contact with his new wife and her adult
child, his second wife and their two children, and his second wife’s mother, sister and the
sister’s two children. He claims he only talks to his second wife and her mother if he  is
contacting his two children with his ex-wife. (FORM Item 6 at 6; FORM Item 3 at 1; FORM
response at 9, 27.)
Applicant submitted a number of character reference letters. The references praise
Applicant as dedicated and trustworthy. In his FORM response, he wrote that neither his
current  wife  nor his  second  wife have  any  affiliation  with  the  Chinese  government,  but
that he was aware that either of them could be exploited by the Chinese government. He
wrote further that if he ever faced that “hypothetical scenario,” he would report it to his
security officials and remove himself from his overseas project. He writes further that he
has always reported his travel to China and that he has always followed the rules and
intends to do so in the future. (FORM Response at 22-26.)
Applicant’s  U.S.  connections  and  contacts  are  largely  limited  to  real  estate
investments he owns in this country and his immediate family, which includes his father,
two brothers and a sister, and his three children from his first marriage, all of whom are
U.S.  citizens  and  residents.  The  record  is silent on the  nature  of  his relationships  with
these family members. He also has some relationships with other U.S. contractors with
whom he has worked overseas since 2004, though he rarely stays in contact with other
contractors unless they happen to work on the same overseas project again. Applicant
has limited connections with other Americans. He describes himself as a “homebody” and
is “not social.” (FORM Item 6 at 5; FORM Item 7 at 12.)
China
Administrative or official notice was taken of certain facts concerning China as
set forth in Department Counsel’s rather extensive written request (FORM Item 8). The
most pertinent of those facts are the following: (1) China is an authoritarian state in which
the Chinese Communist Party is the paramount authority; (2) China is actively engaged
in  intelligence  gathering  (industrial  and  military)  that  targets  U.S.  information  and
technology;  (3)  China’s  intelligence  services,  as  well  as private  companies and  other
entities, frequently seek to exploit Chinese citizens or persons with family ties to China,
who  can  use  their  insider  access  to  steal  secrets;  (4)  the  intelligence  services  also
routinely  monitor  communications,
facsimile
including
transmissions, e-mail, text messaging, and Internet communications; and (5) China has
a  poor  record  of  human  rights  regarding  respect  for  the  integrity  of  the  person  (e.g.,
freedom  from  arbitrary  or  unlawful  deprivation  of  life,  disappearance,  torture,  and
arbitrary  arrest  or  detention),  respect  for  civil  liberties,  respect  for  political  rights,
corruption, lack of transparency in government, worker rights, as well as discrimination,
societal  abuses,  and  trafficking  in  persons.  The  maltreatment  and  oppression  of  the
people of Tibet is but one example of China’s poor record of human rights.

"In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  all  the  SOR  allegations.  The
admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant’s  father,  mother,  two  brothers,  two  sisters,  and  his
brother-in-law are citizens and residents of Iraq. It further alleged that one brother (B1)
works for the Ministry of Defense, Military Intelligence Branch. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c).
Applicant is 41 years old. He was born in Iraq in 1977. He remained there until
January 2007 when he resided in Damascus, Syria, with his father. He was unemployed
when he was living in Syria. He remained there until February 2008, when he returned
to  Iraq.  He  immigrated  to  the  United  States  in  2010  through  an  international  refugee
program.  He  is  seeking  a  clearance  for  a  translator  position  with  a  federal  contractor.
From  2010  to  the  present,  he  has  worked  for  a  private  employer.  He  is  single,  never
married, with no children. He owns a home in the United States, but no further details

In 2014 and 2016, Applicant visited Iraq for approximately 30 days per visit. He
traveled  to  Iraq  to  see  his  family.  While  he  was  in  Iraq  in  2016,  he  renewed  his  Iraqi
passport. He possesses current Iraqi and U.S. passports. From July to November 2004,
Applicant was employed as a translator/linguist for a U.S. contractor in Iraq. He quit the
position  because  he  felt  it  was  too  dangerous.  In  2004,  His  brother-in-law  was  killed
working for the same contractor.5

Applicant has the following relatives who are residents and citizens of Iraq:
1.  His  mother.  His  mother  is  68  years  old.  She  is  not  affiliated  with  the
government  or  the  military.  Applicant  has  weekly  telephone  contact  with  her.  In  April
2016, Applicant sponsored her for entry into the United States seeking U.S. permanent
residency status. So far, her visa has not been approved and she remains in Iraq.6
2.  His  father.  His  father  is  71  years  old.  He  was  a  counselor  at  the  Ministry  of
Justice until he retired in 2004. Applicant has daily contact with his father. In April 2016,
Applicant sponsored his father for entry into the United States seeking U.S. permanent
residency status. He was approved and moved to the U.S. to live with Applicant. When
Applicant’s mother’s status remained unresolved, his father moved back to Iraq where
he currently resides. The record is unclear when this occurred. His father owns property
in  Iraq  worth  approximately  $250,000.  Applicant  will  inherit  a  portion  of  this  property
upon his father’s death.7
3. Applicant’s two brothers (B1 and B2). B1 is 38 years old. He is employed by
the  Iraqi  Ministry  of  Defense-Military  Intelligence.  He  has  worked  there  since
approximately  2007.  Applicant  has  monthly  contact  with  B1.  B2  is  33  years  old.  He
currently resides in the United  States with Applicant. He is a permanent resident alien
(green  card  holder).  He  is  employed  by  a  private-sector  company.  Applicant  has  daily
contact with him.8

Iraq
The  U.S.  State  Department  warns  U.S.  citizens  against  travel  to  Iraq  as
conditions  within  the  country  remain  dangerous.  The  U.S.  Embassy  warns  that  U.S.
citizens are at high risk for kidnapping and violence and to avoid all but essential travel
to  Iraq.  The  U.S.  government  considers  the  potential  threat  to  U.S.  government
personnel  in  Iraq  to  be  serious  enough  to  require  them  to  live  and  work  under  strict
security  guidelines.  The  Islamic  State  of  Iraq  and  Levant  (ISIL)  remained  the  greatest
terrorist threat globally, maintaining a formidable force in Iraq and Syria.

"Applicant is a 52-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his current employer as a linguist in Afghanistan  since 2015. He previously worked for
the  same  employer  or  another  defense  contractor  in  Afghanistan  from  2010  to  2011,
2012  to  2013,  and  2013  to  2014.  He  attended  college  for  a  period,  but  he  has  not
earned a degree. He is married with five children.
Applicant  was  born  in  Afghanistan  to  Afghan  parents.  He  worked  under
dangerous conditions in Afghanistan as a linguist for a defense contractor in support of
the  U.S.  military  from  2006  through  2009.  Because  of  his  work,  he  was  eligible  for  a
special immigrant visa. He immigrated to the United States with his family in 2009. He
became a U.S. citizen in 2015. His work as a linguist in support of the U.S. military since
2010 has also been under dangerous conditions.
Four of Applicant’s children were born in Afghanistan; one was born in the United
States. His wife and all of his children are U.S. citizens.
Applicant’s  father  is  deceased.  He  was  a  farmer.  His  mother,  two  siblings,
parents-in-law,  and  four  siblings-in-law  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Afghanistan.  He
has another brother-in-law who immigrated to the United States on a special immigrant
visa.  Applicant’s  mother  does  not  work  outside  the  farm.  Applicant  has  provided  her
financial support on an as-needed basis, predominantly for her cancer treatment.
Applicant’s  brother  is  a  former  judge.  He  is  currently  a  farmer  on  the  family’s
farm. Applicant’s sister and her husband are also farmers. Two of Applicant’s brothers-
in-law  used  to  work  as  clerks  at  the  Afghan  agency  involved  in  intelligence.  Applicant
believes  his  brothers-in-law  left  the  agency  before  2013,  and  that  they  are  now
shopkeepers.  His  father-in-law  used  to  work  as  a  clerk  in  the  executive  branch  of  the
Afghanistan  government.  Applicant  believes  his  father-in-law  retired  about  ten  years
ago.
Applicant’s  wife  has  not  returned  to  Afghanistan  since  she  immigrated  to  the
United  States.  She  maintains  telephonic  contact  with  her  family.  Applicant  will
sometimes  also  speak  with  them.  Applicant  is  prohibited  from  visiting  his  family  in
Afghanistan when he is there working. He has not seen his family in Afghanistan since
he immigrated to the United States in 2009. Applicant credibly testified that his family in
Afghanistan  could  not  be  used  to  coerce  or  intimidate  him  into  revealing  classified
information.
Applicant
completed  Counterintelligence-Focused  Security  Screening
Questionnaires in 2010, 2013, 2015, and 2017. He reported the information discussed
above  about  his relatives  in  Afghanistan,  including  specifically  discussing  his  brother’s
and brothers-in-law’s positions with the Afghanistan government.
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
April  2015.  Under  the  relatives  section  (Section  18),  he  listed  his  foreign  relatives,
including his brother and father-in-law. He reported that his brother was a judge and that
his  father-in-law  worked  in  the  executive  branch  of  the  Afghanistan  government.  The
section  did  not  require  him  to  report  siblings-in-law.  He  answered  “No”  to  the  foreign
government  contact  question  under  Section  20B.  He  thought  that  was  the  correct
answer as none of his relatives worked for the Afghanistan government when the SF 86
was submitted. I find that he did not intentionally provide false information on the SF 86.

"In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  all  the  allegations  with
explanations. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough
and careful review of the evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 57 years old. He was born in Iraq in 1962. He graduated from high
school and completed three years of college in Iraq. He immigrated to the United States
in 2007. He became a U.S. citizen in 2012. He is employed in the private sector, but is
pursuing a linguist position with a federal contractor, for which he is seeking a security
clearance.  He  has  been  married  for  26  years  and  has  three  children.  His  wife  and
children are U.S. citizens and residents. (Tr. 24, 39, 44; GE 1)
The SOR alleged that Applicant’s mother is a citizen of Lebanon and resident of
Iraq  and  that  two  brothers  are  residents  and  citizens  of  Iraq.  The  SOR  further  alleged
that Applicant provided financial support to one brother and his mother in Iraq; that he
shares  ownership  of  a  home  in  Iraq  with  his  siblings;  and  that  he  maintained  a  bank
account  in  Iraq.  The  SOR  also  alleged  that  Applicant  failed  to  disclose  his  Iraqi  bank
account during an official security screening interview on May 11, 2017.
Applicant was hired locally as a linguist from 2005 to 2007 for U.S. forces in Iraq.
He provided linguist services supporting the mission of training Iraqi police officers. He
worked  in  hostile  areas  requiring  him  to  wear  a  helmet  and  body  armor,  and  carry  a
weapon.  In  2007,  he  and  his  family  immigrated  to  the  United  States  using  a  special
immigrant  visa  based  upon  his  work  with  U.S.  forces.  In  2008,  he  was  hired  by  a
government  contractor  to  fulfill  a  linguist  position  in  Iraq.  He  served  in  various  linguist
positions. He worked for both U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Army units during this time.
Once again, he was consistently exposed to hostile areas while performing his duties. In
2011, with the drawdown of U.S. forces in Iraq, Applicant was laid off from his position
and returned to the United States. (Tr. 22-24, 31-32, 43-44; GE 1, 3-4)
Applicant  was  unemployed  from  2011  to  2014.  He  supported  his  family  with
savings  and  his  wife’s  and  children’s  employment.  In  2014,  he  began  working  in  the
private  sector  in  the  transportation  field.  Applicant  has  never  traveled  back  to  Iraq  for
any  personal  reasons  and  has  no  intent  to  do  so  in  the  future.  After  he  gained  his
citizenship  in  2012,  he  sought  a  position  as  a  linguist,  which  required  a  security
clearance. (Tr. 24, 40; GE 4)
The current status of Applicant’s relatives listed in the SOR is as follows:
1. Applicant’s mother (M). M is 78 years old. She remains a Lebanese citizen and
resident  of  Iraq.  She  is  a  housewife  and  lives  in  the  home  she  inherited  from  her
husband. She receives a small pension. She has no connection to the Iraqi government.
Applicant  sent  his mother approximately  $1,000  in  2008 or 2009, after his father died.
He  has  not  sent  her  any  other  funds.  Applicant  has  weekly  contact  with  her  using  an
Internet phone application. He loves his mother, but his most important family members
are his wife and three children. (Tr. 26, 41-42, 46-47; GE 4)
2. Applicant’s two brothers (B1-B2).  Applicant has a third brother who is a citizen
and  resident  of  the  United  States.  B1  is  a  resident  alien  of  Canada,  although  he
currently  retains  his  Iraqi  citizenship.  His  family  resides  in  Canada.  He  works  in  the
construction industry. Applicant previously had weekly contact with B1, but recently their
contact  is  infrequent  because  of  a  dispute  among  the  brothers  about  the  home  they
inherited from their father (the home where their mother currently lives). B2 is a resident
and citizen of Iraq. B2 is self-employed. Applicant previously had monthly contact with
B2, but because of the property conflict, he now has sporadic contact with him. Neither
B1 nor B2 have any ties to the Iraqi government. He does not have a good relationship
with B1 and B2. (Tr. 27-28, 42; Ans.; GE 4)
Applicant  loaned  B2  $5,000,  which  is  being  repaid.  The  current  debt  is
approximately  $3,500.  Applicant  inherited  a  20  percent  interest  in  his  father’s  home.
Applicant’s  share  of  the  home  could  be  worth  as  much  as  $100,000.  He  is  willing  to
forego any interest in this home. He has tried to persuade his brothers into selling the
property, but they refuse to do so. Applicant owns a home in the United States where
his family  lives.  He  has  over $100,000  worth  of equity  in  the  home.  He  estimated  that
his  net  worth  in  this  country  is  $300,000.  In  approximately  1979,  Applicant  opened  a
bank account in Iraq. With the wars and inflation over the years, the account lost value
resulting in a de minimis amount and Applicant believed the account was closed in the
1990s  for  not  meeting  the  minimum  balance  requirement.  (Tr.  26,  29-30,  35-37;  Ans.;
GE 4)
In May 2017, Applicant completed a security screening questionnaire. One of the
questioned  asked  whether  he  had  any  foreign  bank  accounts  and  he  answered  “no.”
Applicant  completed  a  similar  screening  questionnaire  in  2008  and  disclosed  that  he
had  a  bank  account  in  Iraq.  He  explained  the  circumstances  of  this  account  when  he
was interviewed later in May 2017 by a defense investigator. Applicant credibly testified
that he had no intent to deceive in 2017, and he believed the account had minimal funds
and had been closed. (Tr. 30, 37; Ans.; GE 3-5)
Character Evidence.
Applicant supplied character references from two military supervisors associated
with  his  linguist  duties  from  2008  to  2011.  Those  supervisors  noted  that  his  linguistic
skills  and  other  positive  character  traits,  such  as  honesty  and  being  a  team  player,
made him a valuable asset. Applicant was also recognized by receiving four certificates
of appreciation and two training certificates. (AE A)

clearance by a defense contractor. He was employed by a federal contractor previously
as an interpreter for U.S. armed forces, from May 2011 to September 2012, at forward
operating  bases  in  Afghanistan.  He  is  a  dual  citizen  of  the  United  States  and

employed  outside  her  home.  She  has  never  been  affiliated  with  the  Afghanistan
government,  or  any  other  foreign  government.  His  mother  knows  about  Applicant’s
translator  services,  but  does  not  tell  others  that  he  is  working  in  support  of  U.S.
concerns,  out  of  fear  for  his  safety.  Applicant  sends  his  mother  $500  to  $700  dollars
each month to help with her rent and groceries. He sent her $15,000 between 2009 and
2017.  Applicant  has  no  sympathy,  preference  for,  or  alliance  with  foreign  nationals

"Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful
review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant is 63 years old. He was born in Afghanistan. He married in 1976. His
wife passed away in 2001. He has eight children. All of them were born in Afghanistan.
He earned a bachelor’s degree in Afghanistan. He served in the Afghan National Army
from 1974 to 1997. He was a Major. In 1997, he abandoned his Army commitment and
fled the country with his family, because the Taliban invaded the area where he worked,
and  he  was  concerned  for  their  safety.  He  moved  his  family  to Turkmenistan  in  1998,
where they lived until 2005. He and his family were granted refugee visas and moved to
the  United  States.  His  eldest  daughter  was  married  at  the  time  and  moved  back  to
Afghanistan with her husband, who is a linguist for the government of Turkey. She is a
homemaker. She and her husband are citizens and residents of Afghanistan. They have
six  children.  Applicant  visited  his  daughter  in  2015  and  talks  on  the  phone  with  her
frequently. Applicant’s seven children, who immigrated to the United States with him, are
all citizens and residents of the United States. Three children are married. Their spouses
are  from  Afghanistan  and  permanent  residents  of  the  United  States.  He  has  six
grandchildren in the United States.2
Applicant became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 2014. From 2005 to
2010,  he  worked  as  a  linguist  and  cultural  advisor  in  the  United  States  for  different
contractors. From January 2010 to June 2014, Applicant worked as a linguist for a federal
contractor  in  Afghanistan.  He  was  then  an  on-call  temporary  linguist  and  advisor  from
June  2014  until  he  was  hired  again  full  time  in  June  2017  as  a  linguist  working  in

Applicant’s  brother  and  two  sisters  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Afghanistan.
Applicant did not see his brother from 1997 until 2015. He occasionally contacted him by
telephone. His brother is married and has eight children. Applicant is “friends” with some
of  them  on  Facebook  and  will  occasionally  “like”  their  posts.  His  brother  works  for  the
Afghan  government.  Applicant  also  visited  his  two  sisters  in  2015.  Both  sisters  are
married  and  are  homemakers.  One  sister’s  husband  is  a  custodian.  The  other  sister’s
husband is a retired custodian. He is not in regular contact with them. He does not discuss
his job with them.4
Applicant does not own property or have any assets in Afghanistan. He owns a car
in the United States. He helped his family purchase a house in March 2010, by giving
them $32,000. Two of his children and their families live in the house. Applicant lives there
when  he  is  in  the  United  States.  Applicant  has  approximately  $100,000  in  his  bank
accounts in the United States. He does not provide any financial support to anyone in
Afghanistan.5
Applicant  explained  that  when  he  is  in  Afghanistan  he  lives  on the  U.S. military
base. He is not permitted to leave the base due to safety concerns. He was involved in
patrols outside of the base for a few months. He understands the danger of serving with
the American forces. He testified that he has spent many years working with the United
States military and is happy with his job. He considers himself a loyal American and would
never engage in any activity that would compromise himself or the United States.6
Applicant provided certificates of appreciation from United States and NATO forces
for  his  unwavering  commitment  in  support  of  their  missions  and  his  outstanding
performance  and  professionalism  that  contributed  to  their  success.  He  also  provided
character letters noting his past contributions as a role player and linguist.7

The United States Department of State’s travel warning for Afghanistan remains in
effect and it warns U.S. citizens against travel there because of continued instability and
threats  by  terrorist  organizations  against  U.S.  citizens.  Travel  there  is  unsafe  due  to
ongoing risk of kidnapping, hostage-taking, military combat operations, and armed rivalry
between  political  and  tribal  groups,  militant  attacks,  suicide  bombings,  and  insurgent

Syria (ISIS), and members of other armed opposition groups are active throughout the
country. These terrorist groups routinely attack Afghan, coalition forces, and U.S. targets
with  little  regard  for  or  the  express  intent  to  cause  civilian  casualties.  Due  to  security
concerns, unofficial travel to Afghanistan by U.S. Government employees and their family
members is restricted and requires prior approval from the State Department.
Afghanistan  continues  to  experience  aggressive  and  coordinated  attacks  by
different terrorist groups. These groups remain active and were able to conduct a number
of high-profile, mass-casualty attacks in Kabul against sectarian and Afghan government
targets. They continue to plan such attacks against U.S. and coalition forces and Afghan
interests. Border regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan remain safe havens for terrorists.
The Afghan government struggles to assert control over this remote region.
According  to  a  June  2017  U.S.  Department  of  Defense  report  on  Afghanistan,
Afghanistan faces a continuing threat from as many as 20 insurgent and terrorist networks
present  and  operating  in  the  Afghanistan-Pakistan  region,  in  what  is  the  highest
concentration of extremist and terrorist groups in the world.
The State Department’s report on human rights for Afghanistan notes there was
widespread violence, including indiscriminate attacks on civilians and killings of persons
affiliated with the government by armed insurgent groups, widespread disregard for the
rule of law and little accountability for those who committed human rights abuses. There
was also targeted violence and endemic societal discrimination against women and girls.
Afghanistan remains an important partner of the United States in the fight against
terrorism,  working  with  the  U.S.  to  eliminate  terrorist  groups.  The  U.S.  Government
continues  to  invest  resources  to  help  Afghanistan  improve  its  security,  governance,
institutions, and economy. The U.S. Government has a strong bilateral partnership with
the Afghan government.

"Applicant was born in Turkey in 1970 and moved to Germany with her family in
1976, when she was five years old. In 1988, she met a man in Germany, who was born
in  Turkey.  They  married  in  Turkey  and  were  divorced  in  Turkey  in  1991.  During  their
marriage, they lived in Germany. She has one child from that marriage, who was born in
Germany in 1992. After filing a letter with the Turkish consulate, renouncing her Turkish
citizenship, Applicant applied for and received German citizenship in 1993. In 1996, she
met  her  second  husband,  a  U.S.  citizen,  while  he  was  stationed  with  the  military  in
Germany. They married some months later during a trip to Denmark. They moved to the
United States in 1996. She has one child from that marriage, who was born in the United
States.  In  1997,  she  received  permanent  U.S.  residency.  In  2008,  she  became  a
naturalized U.S. citizen. She and her second husband divorced in 2012. Applicant  has
dual citizenship with Germany. She attended U.S. community colleges, and has earned
some credits. Both of her children reside in the United States. (Tr. 26 GE 1, GE 2)
Applicant  has  worked  for  federal  contractors  since  2006,  providing  various
services,  sometimes  overseas,  including  the  Middle  East.  She  has  held  security
clearances  some  of  that  time,  beginning  in  2011.  In  January  2017,  she  applied  for  a
position with a federal contractor that requires a security clearance. Since then, she has
worked for federal contractors on short-term contracts. (Tr. 31-35, 91; GE 1)
Applicant’s elderly mother is a citizen and resident of Turkey. Her father died in
2012. Prior to moving back to Turkey, Applicant’s mother resided in Germany with other
family members. She worked in a factory in Germany, and is now retired. She receives a
monthly pension of about $1,000 from Germany. She also receives about $500 a month
from a pension she earned in Turkey while working and living there. (Tr. 36-39, 73-75,
79) Applicant does not provide her mother financial support; however, her mother sent
Applicant’s daughter about $7,000 or $8,000 to help with college expenses several years
ago. (Tr. 80) Applicant maintains contact with her mother. (Answer)
While  Applicant’s  parents  were  married,  they  purchased  properties,  including
apartment  buildings.  (Tr.  40,  45)  Upon  Applicant’s  father’s  death  in  2012,  her  mother
inherited 40% of his estate. The remaining 60% was divided among Applicant, her sister,
and four half-siblings. Applicant inherited two small apartments. She subsequently sold
one for $27,000, and transferred the proceeds of the sale into her U.S. bank account. Her
mother has rented out the other apartment. Applicant does not receive any rental monies
because they are used for repairs and maintenance. (Tr. 46-48) She thinks her mother’s
assets now total $700,000 to $800,000. (Tr. 86) She and her sister will inherit her mother’s
estate. (Tr. 80) Applicant owns two homes in the United States. She resides in one and
rents the other. (Tr. 95)
In 2014, Applicant visited the Turkish Consulate in the United States, in order to
obtain  proof  that  she  was  related  to  her  deceased  father  and  entitled  to  receive  an
inheritance. Her married name had caused confusion with her Turkish documents. While
at the consulate, she discussed her situation with a woman employee, who helped her
resolve the problem. Before leaving the consulate, Applicant heard the woman employee
speak  German.  Applicant  then  began  talking  to  the  woman  in  German.  After  a  few
minutes, the woman gave Applicant her business card. Applicant subsequently ”friended”
the  woman  on  Facebook,  and  sent  a  Facebook  message  thanking  her  for  her  help  in
resolving  the  name  issue.  Several  weeks  later,  Applicant  “unfriended”  the  woman
because  she  was  concerned  that  she  should  not  converse  with  a  Turkish  official.
Applicant has not had contact with the woman since July 2014. (Tr. 48-55, 83-85; GE 2;

Applicant had infrequent contact with those half-brothers before her father died. She has
had no contact with them since his death. (Tr. 40-41) Applicant had contact with one of
her half-sisters, who is a citizen and resident of Turkey, while they were teens. Applicant
has  not  had  contact  with  her  since  her  father’s  death  in  2012.  Her  other  half-sister  is
deceased. (Tr. 43-45)
During an investigative interview in March 2011, Applicant said that she has visited
Turkey almost yearly since 2010: once in 2010; once in 2011; twice in 2012; once in 2013;
once in 2015; and once in 2016. She noted that she traveled there for tourism or pleasure.

Turkey
Turkey  is  a  constitutional  republic  with  a  multiparty  parliamentary  system.  The
president’s powers are not precisely defined and his influence depends on his personality
and  political  weight.  Its  citizens  and  foreigners  have  been  targeted  by  domestic  and
transnational terrorist groups for many years. There have been terrorist bombings in the
past five years resulting in deaths. The targets have been religious, government, political,
tourist,  and  business  locations  throughout  the  country.  In  addition,  leftist  and  Islamic
terrorist groups have targeted U.S. and Western interests. The potential for future terrorist
attacks remains high. Its judiciary is declared to be independent, but is in need of reform.
There  are  significant  human  rights  abuses  with  respect  to  detainees  and  personal
freedoms. The U.S. State Department warns citizens to reconsider travel to Turkey due
to the presence of terrorism. (HE 1)

"In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with comments, all but one of the
factual  allegations  pertaining  to  foreign  influence  (¶¶  1.a.  through  1.c.,  and  1.e.).
Applicant’s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a
complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration
of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant is a 59-year-old employee of defense contractor (A), serving as a linguist,
currently deployed to Iraq until the end of 2019. He initially served as a linguist with the
U.S.  Army  in  Iraq, training  at  the  Iraqi Police  Academy  through  defense  contractor  (B)
and  other  unidentified  contractors  with  the  U.S.  Army  in  Iraq  from  July  2006  until
December  2008.  He  subsequently  joined  defense  contractor  (B)  again  in  the  United
States  in  July  2017,  where  he  remained  employed  until  sometime  after  he  was
interviewed by an investigator with the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) in
late August 2017, at which time he joined defense contractor (A). All of Applicant’s formal
education,  including  elementary,  high  school,  and  college,  was  received  in  Iraq.  He
received a bachelor’s degree in 1984. In 1985, during the Iran–Iraq War, Applicant was
drafted into the Iraqi Army for the required compulsory military service. Although he was
wounded in combat in 1987, he remained on active duty in a non-combat role until he
was medically discharged as a 1st lieutenant in 1992. He has never served as a member
of the U.S. military. He has never been granted a security clearance.
As a linguist, in 2008, Applicant emigrated from Iraq to the United States under the
Special  Immigrant  Visa  for  Iraqi  Translators  Program.  He  became  a  naturalized  U.S.
citizen in 2014.3 In his e-QIP, Applicant stated that he had renounced his Iraqi citizenship:4
12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)). The most common basis for
administrative notice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice facts that are either well known or from government
reports. See Stein, Administrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for
administrative notice). Requests for administrative notice may utilize authoritative information or sources
from the internet. See, e.g. Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557 (2006) (citing internet sources for numerous
documents). In this instance, although Department Counsel has selected only certain facts appearing in
the identified publications, I have not limited myself to only those facts, but have considered the publications
in their entirety.

As  noted  above,  Applicant  was  born,  raised,  educated,  and  worked  in  Iraq.  His
father, now deceased, was an Iraqi-born clerk, and his mother, also deceased, was an
Iraqi-born  housewife.  They  had  six  children,  including  Applicant.  Applicant’s  three,  as
opposed to the alleged four, brothers are Iraqi-born citizens and residents. One brother
is a self-employed steelworker; one is an accountant with the Iraqi Government; and the
other is a retired enlisted man with the Iraq military. Applicant’s two sisters are also Iraqi-
born  citizens  and  residents.  One  is  a  teacher  and  the  other  is  a  housewife.  None  of
Applicant’s siblings was ever associated with the Iraqi intelligence service. As of August
2017, Applicant’s contacts with his siblings varied.  He generally spoke to his sisters by
telephone on a monthly to quarterly basis. He last spoke to one brother in May 2018, but
had  not  had  any  contact  with  his  other  two  brothers  in  about  a  year.  In  early  2018,
Applicant’s  relationship  with  his  brothers  became  strained  following  a  falling  out  when
they demanded Applicant’s financial support, something Applicant declined. As a result,
he cut all ties with them.7 Two of Applicant’s brothers are married to Iraqi-born wives, both
of whom are teachers. Applicant initially spoke with them when he spoke with his brothers,
but communication with them now is much more limited.

After  Applicant  completed  his  military  service,  and  started  receiving  a  monthly
military pension of approximately $320, he worked in a number of different entrepreneurial
jobs ranging from driving a taxi, selling hand-woven rugs, to running a chicken farm. By
the  mid-1990s,  he  managed  to  save  enough  money  to  purchase  a  house  in  Iraq  for
approximately  $4,000.  After  the  United  States  invaded  Iraq,  his  military-subsidized
chicken-farm  income  plummeted  with  the  collapse  of  the  Iraqi  Army,  so  Applicant
searched  for  another  job.  He  finally  obtained  a  position  as  an  interpreter  for  the  U.S.
military, initially out of desperation to make money despite the dangerous nature of the
job. Because it was considered an extremely dangerous job, Applicant had to keep his
job a secret from all but his closest family members. Applicant described his experience
as follows:8
. . . as I got to know the fine men and women of our military, it became a
calling. I was inspired by their dedication for their country and their desire
to  do  good.  They  served  their  country  with  honor  and  deserved  all  the
admiration that I could give them.
Upon immigrating to the United States, Applicant briefly resided first with a former
U.S.  colleague  in  Baghdad  –  and  then  with  the  family  who  had  been  sponsoring
Applicant’s  son  as  an  exchange  student.  He  went  back  to  Iraq  briefly  in  2009,  and
returned to the United States with his wife and other children. He rented his house in Iraq
to family members for $400 per month. He went through periods of unemployment in the
United States, and he eventually became a taxi driver, before being able to, once again,
become a linguist. The rental money and his military pension provided some continuing
income  for  him  that  was  sufficient  for  him  to  place  a  down  payment  for  the  family
residence  in  the  United  States.  Applicant  sold  his  Iraqi  house  for  approximately

Iraq
Iraq  is  a  constitutional  parliamentary  republic.  The  outcome  of  the  2014
parliamentary  elections  generally  met  international  standards  of  free  and  fair  elections
and led to the peaceful transition of power from former  Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki to
Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi.
In August 1990, Iraq invaded neighboring Kuwait and declared its annexation into
Iraq. Despite United Nations (UN) disapproval of the action, Iraq refused to withdraw from
Kuwait. In January 1991, a coalition of nations, led by the United States, launched military
operations against Iraq, called Operation Desert Storm. The Iraqi Army was crushed. No-
fly zones were established in Iraq, banning Iraq from using all aircraft in the designated
no-fly zones. After several years of Iraqi non-compliance with established UN resolutions
and  requirements,  in  March  2003,  the  United  States  and  another  coalition  of  nations
launched  another  assault  on  Iraq,  called  Operation  Iraqi  Freedom.  Some  military
operations ceased in May 2003, and a provisional government under a governing council
and an American Chief Civilian Administrator was established to decide all Iraqi affairs.
Over the ensuing years, hostilities and terrorism continued, and U.S. military operations
increased. In 2003, outlawed mid-level and lower level officials of the Ba’ath Party were
permitted to return to their previous posts. By late 2010, over 90,000 U.S. troops were
withdrawn from Iraq, leaving only a transitional military force to advise and assist security
forces, counterterrorism missions, and protect U.S. civilians.
The U.S. Mission in Iraq remains dedicated to building a strategic partnership with
Iraq and the Iraqi people. The December 2011 departure of U.S. troops from Iraq marked
a milestone in our relationship as Iraq continues to develop as a sovereign, stable, and
self-reliant country. Iraq is now a key partner for the U.S. in the region as well as a voice
of  moderation  and  democracy  in  the  Middle  East.  Iraq  has  functioning  government
institutions including an active legislature, is playing an increasingly constructive role in
the  region,  and  has  a  bright  economic  future  as  oil  revenues  surpass  pre-Saddam
production levels with continued rapid growth to come. The U.S. maintains vigorous and
broad  engagement  with  Iraq  on  diplomatic,  political,  economic,  and  security  issues  in
accordance with the U.S.-Iraq Strategic Framework Agreement (SFA).
12 Response to the FORM, supra note 7.
The SFA between Iraq and the U.S. provides the basis for the U.S.-Iraq bilateral
relationship.  It  covers  the  range  of  bilateral  issues  including  political  relations  and
diplomacy, defense and security, trade and finance, energy, judicial and law enforcement
issues, services, science, culture, education, and environment. Efforts to implement the
SFA are overseen by the Higher Coordinating Committee and several Joint Coordination
Committees, which meet periodically.
The  U.S.  State  Department  warns  that  U.S.  citizens  in  Iraq  are  at  high  risk  for
violence and kidnapping, and advises U.S. citizens not to travel to Iraq. The current travel
advisory level is Level 4: “Do not travel to Iraq due to terrorism and armed conflict.” The
U.S. Government considers the potential personal security threats to U.S. Government
personnel  in  Iraq  to  be  serious  enough  to  require  them  to  live  and  work  under  strict
security guidelines.
The  ability  of  the  U.S.  Embassy  to  provide  consular  services  to  U.S.  citizens
outside  Baghdad  is  limited  given  the  security  environment.  Anti-U.S.  sectarian  militias
may  threaten  U.S.  citizens  and  western  companies  throughout  Iraq.  Kidnappings  and
attacks  by  improvised  explosive  devices  (IED)  occur  in  many  areas  of  the  country,
including  Baghdad.  Methods  of  attack  have  included  explosively  formed  penetrators
(EFPs), magnetic IEDs placed on vehicles, human and vehicle-borne IEDs, mines placed
on or concealed near roads, mortars and rockets, and shootings using various direct fire
weapons. Such attacks may take place in public venues such as cafes and markets.
Iraq  witnessed  continued  terrorist  activity  in  2016,  primarily  as  a  result  of  the
actions  of  Islamic  State  of  Iraq  and  Syria  (ISIL).  In  2016,  ISIL  remained  the  greatest
terrorist threat globally, maintaining a formidable force in Syria, including a large number
of foreign terrorist fighters. ISIL’s capacity and territorial control in Iraq has dramatically
eroded in the past two years. According to estimates from the UN Assistance Mission for
Iraq, acts of terrorism and violence killed more than 7,000 civilians and injured more than
12,000 in 2016. By the end of 2017, Iraqi Security Forces had liberated all territory from
ISIL, drastically reducing ISIL’s ability to commit abuses and atrocities. Nevertheless, anti-
American/anti-western sentiment exists throughout Iraq. Human rights violations continue
to be a problem with allegations of unlawful killings and other abuses being made against
the Iraqi Security Forces and Popular Mobilization Forces.
In  its  annual  human  rights  report,  the  U.S.  Department  of  State  reported  that
severe  human  rights  problems  were  widespread.  Sectarian  hostility,  widespread
corruption, and lack of transparency at all levels of government and society weakened
the  government's  authority  and  worsened  effective  human  rights  protections.  Iraqi
Security Forces, members of the Federal Police, and the Peshmerga committed some
human rights violations, and there continued to be reports of Popular Mobilization Forces
killing,  torturing,  kidnapping,  and  extorting  civilians.  ISIL  committed  the  overwhelming
majority of serious human rights abuses, including attacks against: civilians, (particularly
Shia but also Sunnis who opposed ISIL); members of other religious and ethnic minorities;
women; and children.
Observers  also  reported  other  significant  human  rights-related  problems:  harsh
and  life-threatening  conditions  in  detention  and  prison  facilities;  arbitrary  arrest  and
lengthy  pretrial  detention,  denial  of  fair  public  trial;  insufficient  judicial  institutional
capacity;  ineffective  implementation  of  civil  judicial  procedures  and  remedies;  arbitrary
interference  with  privacy  and  homes;  child  soldiers;  limits  on  freedom  of  expression,
including  press  freedoms;  violence  against  and  harassment  of  journalists;  undue
censorship; social, religious, and political restrictions in academic and cultural matters;
limits on freedoms of peaceful assembly and association; limits on religious freedom due
to  violence  by  extremist  groups;  restrictions  on  freedom  of  movement;  refugee  and
internally displaced persons (IDP) abuse; both forced IDP returns and preventing IDPs
from  returning  home;  discrimination  against  and  societal  abuse  of  women  and  ethnic,
religious, and racial minorities, including exclusion from decision-making roles; trafficking
in  persons;  societal  discrimination  and  violence  against  lesbian,  gay,  bisexual,
transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) persons; seizure of property without due process; and
limitations on worker rights.
The  United  States’  extraordinary  commitment  to  Iraq  is  balanced  against  the
inherent  dangers  of  the  ongoing  conflict  in  Iraq  to  its  citizens  and  residents  and  Iraq
government  problems  developing  and  complying  with  the  rule  of  law.  A  top  national
security goal of the United States is to establish relationships, cooperation, training, and
support of the Iraq Government and military in the ongoing war against terrorism.
While most of the official U.S. commentary regarding Iraq focuses on human rights
violations  and  terrorist  activities,  there  is  little,  if  any,  evidence  that  Iraq  is  an  active
participant in economic espionage, industrial espionage or trade secret theft, or violator
of export-control regulations.

considered dual residents of Egypt and Iraq since their father was an Iraqi. His children
acquired  Iraqi  citizenship  by  default.  (Tr. 31-32)  In  2001, her entire family  moved from
Egypt to Iraq to be with her father’s extended family. (Tr. 43) They remained in Iraq for
13  years.  After  college,  Applicant’s  wife  moved  with  her  family  back  to  Egypt  in  2014
due  to  deteriorating  conditions  in  Iraq.  (Tr.  32-33)  They  maintain  no  ties  to  Iraq  and
have no desire to return to that war-ravaged country. (Tr. 33)
Applicant testified credibly that his wife could not find a job in Iraq after obtaining
her college degree because her mother was an Egyptian and her family were Shia. (Tr.

Applicant is 32 years old, and he is seeking employment overseas as a linguist.
He  was  born  in  Iraq, and  in  2009,  he  immigrated  to  the  U.S.  at  the  age  of 22  with  his
parents, three brothers and a sister. His father had been a driver for the United Nations,
and felt  threatened  by  local insurgents for speaking  with  a  U.S. member of  the  United
Nations.  Applicant  lives  with  his  parents,  sister,  and  two  brothers,  and  they  became
naturalized  U.S.  citizens  in  2014.  Applicant  is  a  dual  citizen  of  Iraq  and  the  U.S.  He
attended college in the U.S., and in 2016, he earned an associate’s degree in business
management. Applicant is not married and does not have any children. He is currently
employed  as  a  merchandiser  for  a  beverage  company.  His  government  contractor
employment as a linguist is contingent on obtaining a DOD security clearance. (Tr. 21-

The SOR raises the following foreign influence security concerns:
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  that  Applicant  maintains  contact  with  various  aunts,  uncles
and cousins who are citizens and residents of Iraq. In March 2016, Applicant returned to
Iraq  for  vacation.  He  used  his  Iraqi  passport  to  enter  Iraq,  and  he  renewed  his  Iraqi
identification card while visiting. He stayed in Iraq just under four weeks with extended
family  members.  He  has  five  uncles,  three  aunts,  and  three  cousins.  He  maintains
regular contact with these family members on approximately a monthly basis. Applicant
was  uncertain  if  his  uncles  were  employed  by  the  Iraqi  Government.  He  would  like  to
return  to  Iraq  in  the future for vacation.  His  Iraqi passport  expired  in  September 2016,
and Applicant stated he had no intentions of renewing this passport. (Tr. 26-31, 34, 50-
51, 53; GE 1, GE 2, GE 3; AE A, AE C)
The evidence in the record contained conflicting statements made by Applicant.
During his September 2017 background interview, Applicant stated that he had no plans
of renouncing his Iraqi citizenship. In September 2017, however, he presented a signed
statement  from  his  potential  DOD  employer  indicating  that  he  was  willing  to  renounce
his Iraqi citizenship. During his November 2017 security-screening interview, he stated
he would not renounce his Iraqi citizenship because he wanted to continue visits to Iraq.
(Tr. 35-42; GE 2, GE 3; AE D)
In November 2017, Applicant reportedly stated that he was uncertain if he would
stay  in  the  U.S.  since  Iraq  is  his  home  and  he  believes  Iraq  will  someday  be  a  better
place  to  live.  His  intentions  were  to  maintain  his  Iraqi  and  U.S.  citizenships,  but  he
eventually planned to live in Iraq in the next five to ten years. When initially asked which
country  he  is  more  loyal  to,  Applicant  responded  with  Iraq.  He  later  changed  his
response and stated that he is loyal to the U.S. first, but still considers himself loyal to
Iraq because that is the country where he was born and raised. (Tr. 35-42; GE 2, GE 3;
AE D)
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  denied  stating  in  November  2017  that  he  was  more
loyal to Iraq than the U.S. He believed the interviewer misunderstood his responses. He
told her to change some of his recorded responses that were incorrect, but she did not
do  so.  He  denied  stating  that  he  wanted  to  live  in  Iraq,  but  mentioned  instead  that  he
wanted  to  visit  Iraq  in  the  future  for  vacation.  Applicant  admitted  that  he  continued  to
maintain his dual citizenship. (Tr. 35-42; GE 2, GE 3; AE D)
Personal Conduct
SOR ¶ 2.a alleges that Applicant falsified his September 2017 SCA by failing to
report  his  foreign  relatives  in  Iraq,  as  required.  At  the  hearing  Applicant  denied
intentionally  omitting  this information  on  the  SCA.  He  misunderstood  the  question  and
thought he was only to report any connections to foreign organizations or governments
that  were  a  threat  to  the  U.S.  During  his  September  2017  background  interview,  the
interviewer asked Applicant if he had ongoing contact with any foreign nationals, and he
responded  “No.”  During  his  November  2017  security-screening  interview,  Applicant
provided detailed information about his extended family members in Iraq. (Tr. 31-33; GE
1, GE 2, GE 3)
SOR ¶ 2.b alleges that Applicant intentionally falsified his September 2017 SCA
by  failing  to  report  that  he  renewed  his  Iraqi  identification  card  in  2016.  In  September
2017,  Applicant  provided  the  investigator  his  Iraqi  identification  card  during  his
background interview. Applicant also provided a copy of his Iraqi identification card with
his SOR response. It was not his intent to intentionally omit this information on the SCA.

eroded  in  the  past  two  years. According  to estimates from  the  UN Assistance  Mission
for Iraq, acts of terrorism and violence killed more than 7,000 civilians and injured more
than 12,000 in 2016. By the end of 2017, Iraqi Security Forces had liberated all territory
from  ISIL,  drastically  reducing  ISIL’s  ability  to  commit  abuses  and  atrocities.  Human
rights violations continue to be a problem with allegations of unlawful killings and other
abuses being made against the Iraqi Security Forces and Popular Mobilization Forces.
In  its  annual  human  rights  report,  the  U.S.  Department  of  State  reported  that
severe  human  rights  problems  were  widespread.  Sectarian  hostility,  widespread
corruption, and lack of transparency at all levels of government and society weakened
the  government's  authority  and  worsened  effective  human  rights  protections.  Iraqi
Security Forces, members of the Federal Police, and the Peshmerga committed some
human  rights  violations,  and  there  continued  to  be  reports  of  Popular  Mobilization
Forces  killing,  torturing,  kidnapping,  and  extorting  civilians.  ISIL  committed  the
overwhelming  majority  of  serious  human  rights  abuses,  including  attacks  against:
civilians,  (particularly  Shia  but  also  Sunnis  who  opposed  ISIL);  members  of  other
religious and ethnic minorities; women; and children.
Observers  also  reported  other  significant  human  rights-related  problems:  harsh
and  life-threatening  conditions  in  detention  and  prison  facilities;  arbitrary  arrest  and
lengthy  pretrial  detention,  denial  of  fair  public  trial;  insufficient  judicial  institutional
capacity;  ineffective  implementation  of  civil  judicial  procedures  and  remedies;  arbitrary
interference  with  privacy  and  homes;  child  soldiers;  limits  on  freedom  of  expression,
including  press  freedoms;  violence  against  and  harassment  of  journalists;  undue
censorship; social, religious, and political restrictions in academic and cultural matters;
limits  on  freedoms  of  peaceful  assembly  and  association;  limits  on  religious  freedom
due to violence by extremist groups; restrictions on freedom of movement; refugee and
internally displaced persons (IDP) abuse; both forced IDP returns and preventing IDPs
from  returning  home;  discrimination  against  and  societal  abuse  of  women  and  ethnic,
religious,  and  racial  minorities,  including  exclusion  from  decision-making  roles;
trafficking  in  persons;  societal  discrimination  and  violence  against  lesbian,  gay,
bisexual,  transgender,  and  intersex  (LGBTI)  persons;  seizure  of  property  without  due
process; and limitations on worker rights.
The  United  States’  extraordinary  commitment  to  Iraq  is  balanced  against  the
inherent  dangers  of  the  ongoing  conflict  in  Iraq  to  its  citizens  and  residents  and  Iraq
government  problems  developing  and  complying  with  the  rule  of  law.  A  top  national
security goal of the United States is to establish relationships, cooperation, training, and
support of the Iraqi Government and military in the ongoing war against terrorism.

"Applicant  is  a  39-year-old  linguist  employed  by  a  Department  of  Defense
contractor  since  August  2017.  He  is  currently  stationed overseas. He  is applying  for a
security  clearance.  He  became  a  U.S.  citizen  in  May  2016.  He  was  born,  raised,  and
educated in Iraq. He received a college degree in Iraq. He is single and has no children.
(Gov 1; AE F) (Note: The facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment,
names of witnesses, or locations in order to protect Applicant and his family’s privacy.
The cited sources contain more specific information.)
Foreign Influence
Between April 2004 and February 2011, Applicant served as a local hire with the
U.S. government in Iraq. He started out as a security guard in the Green Zone. In 2007,
he  became  a  linguist.  From  December  2008  to  October  2009,  he  served  as  an
instructor. He worked with U.S. trainers who were training Iraqi police. From December
2009  to  February  2011,  he  worked  as  a  linguist.  Applicant  often  encountered  danger
while working in Iraq as a U.S. contractor. He testified that the base would experience
mortar  attacks  on  a  weekly  basis.  He  had  to  be  situationally  aware  when  he  left  the
base  because assassination  groups  were  watching any  vehicles  that  left  the  base.  He
took  security  precautions  such  as  keeping  his  badges  under  his  shoe  cushion  and
traveling different routes every day. He told his friends and family that he was working
as a security officer at the ministry of industry. In February 2011, he immigrated to the
United  States  with  the  help of  the  U.S.  government  and the  International Organization
for Migration, an organization that helps Iraqis who work for the U.S. government in Iraq
to immigrate to the United States in order to protect them from the risk of violence. (Tr.
50-54; Gov 1; AE B; AE D; AE E)
When he first arrived in the United States, Applicant worked for a temp agency.
In  November  2011,  he  found  a  full-time  job  working  for  a  large  on-line  retailer  in  a
warehouse.  In  December  2015,  he  was  promoted  to  supervisor.  In  August  2017,  he
became  a  linguist  overseas  with  a  U.S.  contractor.  He  initially  deployed  to  a  middle-
eastern  country  (not  Iraq)  with  the  U.S.  Army.    In  January  2019,  Applicant  was
transferred  to  a  linguist  position  in  another  middle-eastern  country  (not  Iraq).  He
decided to become an overseas linguist again out of gratitude to the United States for
allowing  him  to  become  a  U.S.  citizen.  He  saw  it  as  an  opportunity  to  serve  his  new
country. (Tr. 50-54; Gov 1; AE B; AE F)
The  SOR  raises  security  concerns  because Applicant  has family  members who
are  citizens  of  and  reside  in  Iraq.  Specifically,  Applicant’s  mother,  three  brothers  and
three sisters are citizens and residents in Iraq. (SOR ¶ 1.a and SOR ¶ 1.b). His oldest
brother also serves as a senior officer in the Iraqi military. (SOR ¶ 1.c) Applicant admits
the allegations. His mother is 74. She is a housewife. She lives in a house with one of
Applicant’s  sisters.  Applicant’s  oldest  sister  is  seven  years  older  than  him.  She  is  a
housewife. Another sister is a teacher. She is five years older than Applicant. His third
sister is three years older than him and is a housewife.  His sisters and his mother are
not connected to the Iraqi government. (Tr. 39-41, 47-48, 58)
Applicant  has  two  older brothers.  His  oldest  brother is 14  years older than  him.
Applicant’s younger brother is a sergeant in the Iraqi military. He is four years younger
than  Applicant.  His middle brother is a  radiologist  who  works at  a hospital.  Applicant’s
family members are not aware that he works for the U.S. government. He tells them that
he works for a private company. (Tr. 43-46; Gov 1; Gov 3, 4, 5)
Applicant  provided  information  about  his  family  members,  each  time  he
completed a counter-intelligence update when he was employed with DOD contractors
while he was a citizen of Iraq. His family members raised no issues at the time. (Tr. 60;
Gov 3, 4, 5)
Foreign Preference
Under the Foreign Preference concern, it is alleged that Applicant used his Iraqi
passport in  lieu  of  the  U.S.  passport to enter and  exit  the  United States  in  April 2017.
Applicant  testified  that  he  used  his  U.S.  passport  to  exit  and  enter  the  United  States
after becoming a U.S. citizen in May 2016.  He admits that he used his Iraqi passport to
enter  and  exit  Iraq  even  though  he  had  a  U.S.  passport.  He  used  the  Iraqi  passport
because he did not need a visa and it was easier to go through the security lines at the
Iraqi airport.  Since that trip, Applicant renounced his Iraqi citizenship and surrendered
his Iraqi passport to his facility security officer in April 2017. I find for Applicant under the
security  concern  under  Foreign  Preference,  because  he  no  longer  possesses  an  Iraqi
passport.  Under  the  new  guidelines  effective  on  June  8,  2017,  the  possession  of  a
foreign  passport  does  not  raise  security  concerns  as  long  as  Applicant  informed  his
facility security officer. (Tr. 66-69; AE H)
Whole-person Factors
Applicant’s dream was to become a U.S. citizen. He has established a life here.
His bank accounts are located in the United States. He owns stock. He bought a car in
the United States. He has friends in the United States. He saved up $83,000 in hopes of
eventually  purchasing  a  home  in  the  United  States.  He  attempted  to  sign  up  for  the
selective  service,  but  was  advised  he  was  not  required  to  because  of  his  age.  He  is
registered to vote in the United States. In September 2018, he received a performance
bonus based on his performance and conduct during the first year of his current linguist
contract.  (Tr. 55-57; AE A; AE C – AE F)
In  2010,  he  received  a  Longevity  Award,  for  his  exemplary  performance  and
dedication to duty while serving as a linguist. (AE E) Several of his co-workers provided
letters  attesting  to  his  trustworthiness  and  reliability.    A  former  co-worker,  who  has
known Applicant for 12 years, states Applicant is “very respectful and dedicated to his
work  and  the  people  that  worked  with  him.”  He  said  Applicant  described  the  United
States as “the best place on earth!” (AE G)

"Applicant admitted the allegations in the SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.c and denied 1.d
and  1.e.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  testimony,  and  exhibits
submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  52  years  old.  He  was  born  in  Iraq  and  graduated  from  high  school
there in 1989. He was conscripted into the Iraqi Army and went through basic training. He
had an option to work in a factory for ten years instead of military service. He chose to
work in the factory and did so until he fled to Jordan in 1998. He worked there for a year
before returning to Iraq in 1999. He testified that he paid a bribe to be released from his
factory contract. He was then self-employed.2
Applicant married in 2002. He has three children, ages 16, 14 and 11, who were
all born in Iraq. From 2003 to 2006, he worked for the United States Government in Iraq.
From 2007 to 2010, he worked as an interpreter for United States military forces in Iraq.
He served with the forces until there was a drawdown, and he was laid off.3
Applicant  provided  letters  of  recommendations  from  some  of  the  U.S.  military
personnel with whom he served in Iraq from 2007 to 2010. He was praised for his service
and  guidance  on  cultural  matters.  It  was  noted  he  was  dedicated  to  his  duty  and
completely devoted to the mission of securing and rebuilding Iraq. He was excellent at
his  job  and  a  consummate  professional.  The  letters  also  reflected  that  Applicant
participated in daily patrols in high threat areas  and combat operations, which put him
considerable risk to his safety and security. He was responsible for tactical questioning
of  suspected  insurgents  and  translation  of  confiscated  documents.  He  assisted
immeasurably in communication with the Iraqi local nationals and Iraqi Security Forces.

3 Tr. 18-22, 73-79.
Despite these  constant  threats, he  served  the  U.S. forces  with  distinction.4  One  of  the
letters stated the following:
[Applicant]  was  an  invaluable asset to 1st  Platoon  during  his three-month
tenure. He enabled the successful conduct of over 150 combat operations
in  [city]  and  [city]  Iraq.  His  mastery  of  the  English  language  and
understanding  of  the  local  dialect,  customs,  and  idioms  provided  a
seamless link between Coalition Forces and the local populace, supporting
both  combat  and  stability  operations.  Furthermore,  his  ability  to  translate
the United States Army’s technical jargon into terms Iraqi Security Forces
could understand was essential for rapid commands on the battlefield.
[Applicant] has an unparalleled work ethic. The difficult missions and long
hours  involved  in  translating  for  a  United  States  Army  Infantry  platoon
demand  only  strong,  skilled,  responsible  men.  [Applicant]  is  a  prime
example of such a man.5
In  2010,  Applicant  and  his  family  immigrated  to  the  United  States  as  refugees.
Applicant had applied for a Special Immigration Visa (SIV) because of his service to the
United  States  Government.  He  had  already  immigrated  and  was  living  in  the  United
States  with  his  family  when  an  SIV  was  approved,  so  he  chose  to  not  change  his
immigration  status.  He  attempted  to  enlist  in  the  American  military  because  he  liked
working with them. He was told he was too old. In July 2016, he became a naturalized
citizen of the United States. He testified that after he became a U.S. citizen, he applied to
work as a linguist Iraq.6
Applicant’s  father  passed  away  in  2006.  Applicant  returned  to  Iraq  to  visit  his
mother in 2012, 2014, and 2018. Applicant maintains close contact with his mother, and
speaks with her by phone regularly. He does not know her exact age, but she is at least
in her 90s. He has three sisters. His mother lives with two of his sisters and two nephews.
Applicant communicates with them when he calls his mother. One sister is single and the
other is a widow. His single sister works as a technician. His widowed sister works in a
factory. His mother and two sisters are citizens and residents of Iraq. His widowed sister
has two sons, one who is a severely handicapped teenager. They both live with her. His
nephew  contacts  Applicant  regularly  due  to  the  isolation  caused  by  his  disability.
Applicant’s third sister is also a widow who has six children. Applicant was unsure if any
of them live with her, but thought perhaps one did. She is a citizen and resident of Iraq
and  supports  herself  with  her  husband’s  pension.  He  last  saw  her  in  2014  and  has
occasional social media contact.7

Applicant has two brothers, one is a permanent resident of the United States and
the other is a citizen and resident of Iraq. Applicant sponsored his brother, his brother’s
wife and their one minor child for immigration to the United States. Their other children
were  over  18  years  old  and  remained  in  Iraq.  Applicant’s  brother’s  wife  is  also  a
permanent resident. Applicant’s other brother is married with children. He is a citizen and
resident of Iraq. He is a tailor. Applicant sometimes communicates with him through social
media. Applicant visited him during his last visit to Iraq in 2018, but had not seen him for
many years before that.8
Applicant’s  wife’s  parents  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Iraq.  She  contacts  them
regularly. She has returned to Iraq twice to visit, once with the children. She works in a
restaurant.  She  sends  her  parents  money.  Her father  is  not  employed.  In  about  2013,
Applicant’s wife’s brother died from an improvised explosive device. He was in the Iraqi
Army, but was not on duty at the time. Her father receives the brother’s pension. She also
has  another  brother  and  three  sisters  who  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Iraq.  His  wife
intends to visit her family in Iraq in the future.9
Applicant  testified  that  he has  a big  family  and most  of  his contact  with  them  is
through social media and consists of a casual greeting. He believes some of his relatives
are jealous that he is now an American citizen. He has told them to stop contacting him
on social media. He does not have anything in common with them anymore.  Applicant
has many nieces, nephews, and cousins. He disclosed that one of his nephews is a police
officer with the Iraqi National Police. Another nephew works with the Iraqi public works
department. He did not know his specific job. They are all citizens and residents of Iraq.
He  contacted  some  of  his  relatives  when  he  was  completing  the  security  clearance
documents so he could obtain accurate information. Some were aware he was applying
for a job with the United States Government, but not the specific job, or that he may be
returning to Iraq.10
In 2010, before Applicant immigrated to the United States, he sold a house that
was  co-owned  by  family  members.  The  proceeds  were  split  among  the  siblings.  His
mother  and  two  sisters  wanted  to  purchase  another  house.  Before  Applicant’s  father
passed away, he told Applicant to take care of his mother and sisters. Applicant took his
share of the profit he earned on the sale of the house, which was $22,000, and loaned
them $18,000, so they could purchase the new house. They put his name on the deed of
the house. They intended to repay him, but Applicant knows they are unable to repay him
and he considers it a gift to them. He asked them to sell the house so his name could be
removed  from  the  deed  or  to  take  his  name  off  the  deed,  so  it  would  not  cause
complication.  They  do  not  want  to  sell  the  house  because  they  need  stability  for  the
handicapped  teen.  Applicant  testified  that he  financially  helps his sisters and  mother if

they need it. He said that he has applied for his one sister and two nephews to immigrate
to the United States.11
In  2013,  Applicant  purchased  a  house  in  the  United  States,  which  cost  about
$94,000. He owns two vehicles. He has a checking and savings account in the United
States with assets of about $10,000. He had a bank account in Iraq, but it was dormant
for more than five years and was closed by the bank. He stated that his life is in the United
States. He considers the United States his country and is not loyal to any other.12
IRAQ
The United States Department of State warns that U.S. citizens in Iraq remain at
high risk for kidnapping and terrorist violence and to avoid all travel to Iraq. The ability of
the  U.S.  Embassy  to  provide  consular  services  to  U.S.  citizens  outside  Baghdad  is
extremely  limited  given  the  security  environment.  ISIS  controls  a  significant  portion  of
Iraq’s territory. Within areas under ISIS control, the Iraqi government has little or no ability
to control and ensure public safety.
Numerous terrorist and insurgent groups are active in Iraq, including ISIS. Such
groups regularly attack both Iraqi security forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias
may  also  threaten  U.S.  citizens  and  western  companies  throughout  Iraq.  U.S.
Government and western interests remain possible targets for attacks.
The  U.S.  Government  considers  the  potential  personal  security  threats  to  U.S.
government personnel in Iraq to be serious enough to require them to live and work under
strict security guidelines.
There are significant human rights problems in Iraq to include: sectarian hostility,
widespread corruption, lack of transparency at all levels of government and society that
have  weakened  the  government’s  authority  and  worsened  effective  human  rights
protections.  Iraqi  security  forces  and  members  of  the  Federal  Police  have  committed
human rights violations to include killing, kidnapping, and extorting civilians.  There are
also problems that include harsh and life-threatening conditions in detention and prison
facilities, arbitrary arrest and lengthy pretrial detainment, denial of fair public trial, limits
on freedom of expression, freedom of the press, censorship of religion, limits on peaceful
assembly,  and  societal  abuses  of  women.  ISIS  is  also  responsible  for  human  rights
abuses.

"Applicant  is 55  years old.  He  was  born  in Afghanistan  in  1963.  He  received his
education while living in Afghanistan. In 1981, Applicant graduated from high school, and
in 1988, he received a certificate from a government college. After his father was killed
by  the  Pakistani  army,  he  fled  to  Pakistan  in  1989  because  he  did  not  want  to  be
conscripted into the Afghan army. He remained in Pakistan until 1992, when he entered
the United States as a refugee, along with his mother and siblings. He married an Afghan
citizen in 2006 while visiting Afghanistan. They divorced in 2009 in Afghanistan. He does
not  have  any  children.  He  became  a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen  in  2006.  (Items  4,  7,  9)
Applicant’s five siblings are U.S. residents and naturalized citizens. (Item 7)
Applicant worked as a linguist for federal contractors in Afghanistan from March
2009  to  November  2009  and  March  2011  to  December  2012.  He  applied  for  another
linguist position in November 2017. He stated that he was granted a security clearance

States. He was also unemployed at times. (Items 3, 5, 8, 9)
Foreign Influence
Applicant admitted that his mother, age 86, is currently a citizen and resident of
Afghanistan. She has lived there since 2013. Prior to that, she lived in the United States
periodically after she immigrated in 1992. He contacts her twice a week. (Items 2, 9 at

is a citizen of Afghanistan. He stated that his brother-in-law recently moved to the United
States and lives with Applicant’s sister. He does not know his brother-in-law’s citizenship
status. There is no information regarding how often Applicant contacts him or confirmation
that his brother-in-law now lives in the U.S. (Item 2)
Applicant admitted in his Answer that he provides financial support for his mother,
extended  family,  and  friends.  He  sends  money  to  friends  to  maintain  his  family’s
residence in Afghanistan. His mother lives in that residence, which he estimated has a
value of $80,000. He denied that he supports his former wife, as he previously disclosed
in  his  2017  e-QIP.  (Items  2,  7,  9)  In  his  December  2017  Counterintelligence  Focused
Security  Screening  Questionnaire  (CFSSQ),  Applicant  stated  that  between  2009  and
2013,  he  sent  $500  to  his  cousin  and  also  to  a  friend  as  gifts.  He  sent  $6,300  to  his
brother-in-law  to  help  poor  citizens  and  pay  for  Applicant’s  father’s  medical  expenses
while he was alive. (Items 6, 8)
Personal Conduct
The SOR alleged that  Applicant has a history of arrests, falsifying his 2014 and
2017 e-QIPs, and engaging in misconduct related to his businesses. The allegations are
as follows:
(¶ 2.a) In 1995, Applicant was arrested and charged with soliciting a prostitute. He
disclosed this information  in his March 2009  Screening  Questionnaire  (SQ).  He  stated
that he talked to a prostitute for a cousin, who could not speak English. He was convicted
and placed on probation for one year. (Item 7 at 7) In his Answer, he denied the allegation
and said he did not recall the incident. (Item 2)
(¶  2.b)  Applicant  denied  that  he  was  arrested  and  charged  with  aggravated
harassment in November 2000. A state court record indicated that he pleaded guilty to
disorderly conduct and an order of protection was entered against him for one year. (Item
11)
(¶  2.c)  In  June  2002,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  aggravated
harassment, involving his previous girlfriend. He disclosed this information in his 2009 e-
QIP and noted that the charges were dismissed. He admitted this allegation in his Answer.
(Item 2, Item 3 at 39; Item 4 at 7)
(¶  2.d)  In  October  2008,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  assault.  He
disclosed this information in his 2009 e-QIP and stated that he was charged with hitting
his  12-year-old  niece  in  the  face.  The  case  was  subsequently  dismissed.  Applicant
admitted this allegation in his Answer. (Item 2, Item 3 at 38, Item 4 at 7)
(¶  2.e)  In  November  2009,  a  defense  contractor  terminated  Applicant’s
employment after they received an anonymous complaint that he was smoking hashish.
Applicant was working in the Middle East at that time. (Item 10) Applicant denied that he
was using hashish and said he was “framed” by others. (Item 2)
(¶  2.f)  In  December  2012,  another  defense  contractor  terminated  Applicant’s
employment after he tested positive for illegal drug use. (Item 10) Applicant denied that
he was terminated, but said he voluntarily left because his contract ended. (Item 7 at 20,
Item 8 at 3)
(¶ 2.g) In November 2013, Applicant was arrested and charged with obstructing
governmental  administration.  Applicant  denied  the  allegation.  A  court  document
confirmed that he was charged and the case was dismissed. (Item 11)
(¶ 2.h) In his Answer, Applicant stated he did not recall if he disclosed in his 2014
e-QIP his December 2012 termination for drug use, as alleged in SOR ¶ 2.f. He asserted
that  he  submitted  many  e-QIPs  and  other  documents  and  said  he  disclosed  that
information in some of them. He denied the allegation regarding his drug use. (Item 2) In
his 2014 CFSSQ, he explained that he had a conflict with another employee, who reported
him as using hashish. He said he was dismissed by his employer without being given a
drug test. (Item 6 at 2)
(¶  2.i)  Applicant  admitted  that  he  was  arrested  in  October  2008  and  November
2013, as alleged in SOR ¶¶ 2.d and 2.g. He said he did not disclose the arrests in his
2014 e-QIP because both cases were dismissed. He denied that he falsified his 2014 e-
QIP. (Item 2)
(¶  2.j)  During  his  January  2018  interview,  Applicant  stated  that  from  December
2014 until May 2016, he lived and worked in Afghanistan. He told the investigator that he
and  his  brother-in-law,  a  citizen  and  resident  of  Afghanistan,  started  a  business
partnership,  buying  gas  from  Iran  and  shipping  it  to  Afghanistan.  Applicant  said  he
registered the business in his brother-in-law’s name because  as a U.S. citizen he was
subject to U.S. sanctions and prohibited from doing business with Iran. (Item 9 at 18) In
his Answer, he denied any wrongdoing and asserted that he was unfamiliar with the U.S.
sanctions. (Item 2)
(¶  2.k)  In  his  2017  e-QIP,  Applicant  disclosed  that  he  was  self-employed  as  a
homebuilder  in  the  United  States  from  January  2014  through  November  2017,  part  of
which time he claimed he lived in Afghanistan. (Item 7 at 18) During his January 2018
interview, he stated that he did not register his U.S. business with the state or report any
income  to  the  state  or  IRS.  (Item  9  at  2,  18)  In  his  Answer,  Applicant  denied  these
allegations, claiming he performed construction work as a hobby and not as a business.
(Item 2)
(¶ 2.l) In his 2017 e-QIP, Applicant disclosed that for the past ten years he resided
in  the  United  States  from  October  2012  to  the  present  (December  2017).  He  failed  to
disclose that he had resided in Afghanistan from December 2014 through May 2016. In
his Answer, he denied that he falsified information about his residency. He said that either
he or the person interviewing him in 2018 did not correctly insert the information into the
e-QIP  or  other  documents.  (Item  2)  He  did  not  clarify  the  dates  of  his  residency  in
Afghanistan in his Answer.
(¶  2.m)  Applicant  admitted  that  he  did  not  disclose  in  his  2017  e-QIP  the  facts
alleged in SOR ¶ 2.f, relating to his job termination in December 2012 for using drugs. He
asserted  that  he  had  submitted  all  relevant  information  numerous  times  about  the
termination and his drug test, and stated that he did not falsify information in the e-QIP.
(Item 2)
(¶ 2.n) In his 2017 e-QIP, Applicant did not disclose that he had a business partner
or  associate  in  Afghanistan,  or  had  contacts  with  Iran  within  the  past  seven  years,  as
requested. He denied that he falsified his e-QIP because he claimed his brother-in-law
was not “an official business partner.” (Item 2)
(¶ 2.o) During the January 2018 interview, Applicant did not disclose that he had
an employment problem with his former employer in December 2012 and was terminated
for testing positive for drug use, as alleged in ¶ 2.f. He denied that he deliberately withheld
the information and asserted that he was confused by the interviewer’s questions. (Item

Afghanistan
I  have  taken  administrative  notice  of  facts  contained  in  U.S.  Government
pronouncements  concerning  the  state  of  Afghanistan.  Specifically,  Afghanistan  faces
many challenges fueled by sectarian and ethnic divisions. Numerous terrorist groups are
increasingly active throughout Afghanistan. Threats of kidnapping and violence are high,
and the Department of State warns U.S. citizens that all travel to Afghanistan should be
avoided.  Of  particular  significance  are  the  poor  human  rights  situation;  the  active  and
hostile presence of Al Qaida, the Taliban, the Haqqani Network; and other insurgent and
extremist groups that generate instability and openly attack police, security  and military
forces, the local populace, and U.S. persons and interests. (AE 1)

"Applicant  denied  all  of  the  allegations  in  the  SOR.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant is 59 years old. He was born in Afghanistan. He completed high school
and college there. He is married and has six children, four girls and two boys. He served
as an officer in the Afghan Army from 1980 to 1992. He served as an infantry instructor.
In 1992, the Afghan Army sent Applicant to Uzbekistan to attend law school. He moved
there with his wife and four children at the time. He earned a law degree. He does not
maintain contact with any members of the Afghan military.2
While  living  in  Uzbekistan,  Applicant  and  his  wife  had  two  more  children,
daughters.  During  that  period,  Afghanistan  was  invaded  by  the  Soviet  Union,  and
Applicant could not return to his home country. In 2005, he and his family were granted
asylum  by  the  United  States,  left  Uzbekistan,  and  immigrated  to  the  United  States.  In
2009, Applicant began working as a cultural affairs advisor and was employed by several
federal contractors until 2014, when he and many of the cultural advisors, were laid off.
In 2015, he opened a business with a friend. It was unsuccessful. In 2016, he went back
to work for the U.S. Government, and has since been working as a linguist. He speaks
four  languages.  He  was  deployed  to  Afghanistan  from  April  2018  to  January  2019.
Because of  his  duties with  the  U.S.  Government, he did not  visit his family  during  this
deployment.3
In  2011,  Applicant  became  a  U.S.  citizen.  Applicant’s  four  eldest  children,  who
were born in Afghanistan, also became U.S. citizens in 2011. His two youngest children
1 Source documents are attached to Hearing Exhibit I.

became U.S. citizens in 2015, and his wife became a U.S. citizen in 2016. All of them
have U.S. passports. None have retained foreign passports or Afghan citizenship.4
Applicant’s eldest son is mentally disabled. His other son works as a linguist for a
U.S. military contractor in Afghanistan. He lives on a U.S. military base. He is married to
an Afghan citizen, and they have one child.
In  2016,  Applicant’s  wife  moved  to  Afghanistan.  Two  adult  daughters  and  their
disabled son also moved back to Afghanistan with her. Because Applicant’s wife, son,
and two daughters had previously been citizens of Afghanistan, they were not required to
obtain  an  Afghan  visa,  which  is  normally  required.  They  do  not  possess  any  type  of
Afghan identification cards. Applicant testified that most people are unaware of his wife
and children’s citizenship status. However, some of her neighbors are aware that they
are U.S. citizens. One daughter, who accompanied her mother, suffers from depression
and was advised by her doctor to go with her mother to help improve her mental health.
Applicant testified that his wife moved back to Afghanistan for two reasons. First,
his elderly father needed care and secondly, their son and his wife lived there. His son’s
wife and child live in the same apartment as Applicant’s wife. Due to his job, his son is
required to live on base. Applicant’s son provides his wife and son financial support. His
paycheck is deposited directly into his bank account in the United States and then his
younger sisters, who have access to the account, wires money to his wife. Applicant’s
son’s wife is an Afghan citizen.5
Applicant’s  other  daughter  who  returned  to  Afghanistan,  married  in  2017.  Her
husband, an Afghan citizen, has worked for a U.S. contractor in Afghanistan for about five
years.  They  have  one  child.  Applicant  testified  that  this  daughter  has  applied  for  her
husband to come to the United States with her when she returns. It is unknown when she
intends to return.6
Applicant’s father died in October 2018. Applicant testified that his wife plans on
returning to the United States, along with their disabled son and daughter. They do not
yet  have  plane  tickets  to  return.  Applicant  is  their  sole  source  of  financial  support.
Applicant’s  two  youngest  daughters,  who  are  college  students  and  live  in  the  United
States, have access to their father’s account. They wire money to their mother from their
father’s account in the United States for her financial needs. Their mother retrieves the
money by going to the transfer office and showing her U.S. passport. Applicant has not
visited his wife since 2017. He was not permitted to visit her or his children when he was
deployed to Afghanistan in 2018. He maintains contact with her by telephone.7
4 Tr. 40-42, 98-100-101.
5 Tr. 68, 100-109, 130-131-136. Applicant testified that the Afghan Government changed the rule, waiving
the requirement of a visa for former citizens. Applicant testified that his son has a security clearance.

7 Tr. 21-29, 51-54, 68-77-78, 81-82, 125-127.
Applicant’s two youngest daughters share an apartment, and Applicant provides
them  financial  support.  They  both  intend  on  remaining  in  the  United  States  after  they
graduate from college. Applicant stays with them when he is the United States.8
Applicant’s mother predeceased his father many years earlier. Applicant did not
inherit any  property  from  his father. His father  had 10  children  with Applicant’s  mother
and  six  children  with  his  stepmother.  Seven  of  Applicant’s  siblings  are  citizens  and
residents of Afghanistan. The other three siblings live in Germany, India, and Australia.
All of his siblings living in Afghanistan are married and have children who also live there.
One  brother  is  employed  in  the  Afghan  ministry  of  agriculture.  The  last  time  Applicant
visited  this  brother  was  in  2016.  Applicant’s  wife  visits  Applicant’s  siblings  sometimes
because they live in the same city. Applicant does not have contact with his stepbrothers
and  stepsisters.  He  does  not  provide  support  to  any  of  his  siblings  or  step-siblings.
Applicant  has  a  brother-in-law  who  was  a  colonel  in  the  Afghan  military.  He  retired  a
couple of years ago and receives a military pension.9
Applicant traveled to Afghanistan with his family in 2014, 2015, and 2016 to visit
his father and family. In 2017 he traveled there with his youngest daughters to visit his
immediate and extended family. They stayed for about a month. While there he visited
some siblings. He does not have contact his siblings throughout the year, but does when
he is in the country and visits them.10
In about 2004, Applicant met an Afghan citizen when he lived in Uzbekistan. He
had  a  casual  social  acquaintance  with  him  because  they  were  both  Afghans.  They
greeted each other on three to four occasions, but they were not friends. In approximately
2015,  this  person  was  appointed  as  the  Afghan  ambassador  to  Uzbekistan.  When
Applicant  became  aware  of  this  person’s  appointment  to  ambassador,  he  sent  him  a
congratulatory note on Facebook. This was the extent of their contact.11
Applicant does not provide financial support to any family members in Afghanistan
except  his  immediate  family.  He  does  not  provide  financial  support  to  his  children’s
friends, who are citizens and residents in Afghanistan. In approximately 2016 or 2017, he
loaned $500 to a distant relative. The relative repaid him.12
Applicant does not own a home in Afghanistan or the United States. When in the
United States, he stays with his daughters in their rented apartment. He intends to retire

appreciation from a military commander for his service as a cultural advisor.13
Afghanistan14
The United States Department of State’s travel warning for Afghanistan remains in
effect and it warns U.S. citizens against travel there because of continued instability and
threats  by  terrorist  organizations  against  U.S.  citizens.  Travel  there  is  unsafe  due  to
ongoing risk of kidnapping, hostage-taking, military combat operations, and armed rivalry
between  political  and  tribal  groups,  militant  attacks,  suicide  bombings,  and  insurgent
attacks.  These  attacks  may  also  target  Afghan  and  U.S.  Government  convoys  and
compounds, foreign embassies, military installations, and other public areas.
As recently as December 2018, the U.S. Embassy in Kabul warned U.S. citizens
in Afghanistan of reports that militants plan to conduct attacks against hotels, compounds,
international organizations, universities, airports and other locations frequented by U.S.
citizens and other foreign nationals.
Afghanistan  continues  to  experience  aggressive  and  coordinated  attacks  by
different terrorist groups. These groups remain active and were able to conduct a number
of high-profile, mass-casualty attacks in Kabul against sectarian and Afghan government
targets. They continue to plan such attacks against U.S. and coalition forces and Afghan
interests. Border regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan remain safe havens for terrorists.
The Afghan government struggles to assert control over this remote region.
According  to  a  June  2017  U.S.  Department  of  Defense  report  on  Afghanistan,
Afghanistan faces a continuing threat from as many as 20 insurgent and terrorist networks
present  and  operating  in  the  Afghanistan-Pakistan  region,  in  what  is  the  highest
concentration of extremist and terrorist groups in the world.
The State Department’s report on human rights for Afghanistan notes there was
widespread violence, including indiscriminate attacks on civilians and killings of persons
affiliated with the government by armed insurgent groups, widespread disregard for the
rule of law and little accountability for those who committed human rights abuses. There
was also targeted violence and endemic societal discrimination against women and girls.

"Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  allegations  in  the  SOR,  except for SOR ¶¶  2.j  and
2.l. She also provided mitigating information in a written statement. Her admissions are
incorporated herein as findings of fact.
The Government has requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts
about Russia and the Ukraine. Therefore, I make the following findings of fact:
Russia  has  a  highly  centralized,  weak  multi-party  political system  dominated  by
the president. Russia has significant human-rights problems, marked by restrictions on
civil  liberties,  discrimination,  denial  of  due  process,  forced  confessions,  torture,  other
prisoner  mistreatment,  and  the  government’s  failure  to  prosecute  officials  who  commit
serious  violations.  Government  officials  also  engage  in  electronic  surveillance  without
proper  authorization.  Russia  is  one  of  the  most  aggressive  countries  conducting
espionage against the United States, focusing on obtaining proprietary information and
advance  weapons  technologies  beneficial  to  Russia’s  military  modernization  and
economic development. Russia’s intelligence services as well as private companies and
other  entities  frequently  seek  to  exploit  Russian  citizens  or  persons  with  family  ties  to
Russia  who  can  use  their  insider  access  to  corporate  networks  to  steal  secrets.  They
also  have  offered  financial  inducements  to  U.S.  government  officials  and  citizens  to
encourage them to compromise classified information. Russia’s attempts to collect U.S.
technological  and  economic  information  represent  a  growing  and  persistent  threat  to
U.S. security.
U.S.  intelligence  has  also  identified  the  Ukraine  as  an  active  perpetrator  of
industrial espionage against the United States, often targeting individuals with ties to the
country.  In  2014,  Russia  seized  and  occupied  Crimea  in  an  effort  to  annex  it,  which
caused  the  United  States  to  impose  sanctions  against  those  entities  and  individuals
responsible  for  the  aggression.  The  conflict  is  ongoing.  The  U.S.  State  Department
advises  U.S.  citizens  to  avoid  separatist-controlled  areas  of  Ukraine,  particularly  the
eastern  regions  of  Donetsk  and  Luhansk,  where  separatist  groups  have  detained  and
kidnapped  U.S.  citizens.  The  U.S.  State  Department  has  also  warned  U.S.  citizens  to
avoid all travel to Crimea due to the continued presence of Russian Federation military
forces occupying  the  region  as  a  de facto  government and  committing  abuses  against
the  local  population.  The  Ukrainian  Government  is  known  to  commit  human  rights
violations, including government intervention on personal freedoms. Separatist groups,
present in several regions, are known to target U.S. citizens.
Applicant is a 55-year-old linguist sponsored for a security clearance by  a DOD
contractor  since  August  2017.  Her  employment  as  a  linguist  is  contingent  on  her
obtaining  a  DOD  security  clearance.  In  1963,  she  was  born  and  raised  in  Ukraine.  In
1983, she was married in Ukraine, and in 1995, she obtained a divorce in Russia. She
has a daughter, age 34, and a grandchild, age 6, currently living in Russia. In 1998, she
graduated from Moscow State Mining University with a bachelor’s degree, and in 1999,
she earned a master’s degree in business administration. In 2004, she married a U.S.
citizen  in  Russia,  whom  she met  online,  and  she  emigrated from Russia  to  the  United
States  in  2006.  In  2011,  she  became  a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen.  She  is  currently
employed by a company working as a translator. Her workload is inconsistent, and her
monthly  income  averages  approximately  $1,200.  She  and  her  spouse  live  in  separate
households, and he does not support her financially. (Tr. 11-14, 52-53, 76, 80-81; GE 1)
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges that Applicant’s daughter is a citizen and resident of Russia.
Applicant  admitted  this  in  her  SOR  response.  Her  daughter  recently  divorced  her
husband. Applicant has asked her daughter to come to the U.S. on multiple occasions,
but her daughter is reluctant. Her daughter is employed as a purchaser for a privately-
owned  company.  Applicant  stated  that  she  tries  to  communicate  with  her  daughter  by
phone every week, but sometimes she is unsuccessful in getting ahold of her. She also
uses the app “WhatsApp” and Skype frequently to communicate with her daughter. (Tr.
59-63)
SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c. allege that Applicant’s sister and brother-in-law are citizens
and  residents  of  the  Ukraine.  Applicant  admitted  this  in  her  SOR  response.  At  the
hearing, she said that there was a time after their mother passed away, Applicant and
her  sister  did  not  communicate  for  nearly  two  years.  When  Applicant  was  sick  with
lymphoma last year, she contacted her sister. They now communicate on an app called
“Viber,”  and  they  talk  to  each  other  two-to-three  times  a  week.  Applicant  asked  her
sister and her husband to come to the U.S., and she indicated there is a possibility they
may come for a visit. Her sister is a regional manager for about 20 small grocery stores,
and  her  husband  is  a  security  guard.  Neither  of  their  jobs  are  connected  to  the
Ukrainian government. (Tr. 64-69)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges that Applicant’s friend is a citizen and resident of the Ukraine.
Applicant admitted this in her SOR response. At the hearing, she said her friend was a
neighbor  while  she  was  growing  up.  Her  friend  is  elderly  and  helped  take  care  of  her
mother after she suffered a stroke. Their contact now is infrequent. (Tr. 69-70)
SOR  ¶  1.e  alleges that  Applicant’s friend  is a  citizen of  Russian,  residing  in  the
Russian  Embassy  in  Washington  D.C.  The  friend’s  spouse  was  an  employee  of  the
Russian  Embassy.  Applicant  admitted  that  the  woman  used  to  be  her  friend,  but  they
terminated their friendship and they no longer have any contact. (Tr. 73)
Applicant  does  not  own  any  property  in  Russia  or  the  Ukraine,  and  she  has  no
plans to visit either country. She has never returned to either country since she arrived
in the U.S. in 2006. (Tr. 73-75)
Financial Considerations
The SOR also alleges unpaid financial obligations just under $20,000. Applicant
attributes  her financial  difficulties from  an  abusive  marriage,  which  required  her to  live
separate from her spouse. Her spouse was unemployed and he depleted their savings
account.  She  had  difficulty  obtaining  employment  despite  her  college  education,  and
was forced to accept jobs paying low wages, to include employment as a pizza delivery
driver,  a  house  cleaner,  and  a  home-healthcare  aide.  Applicant  also  suffered  from
medical issues with her spine and lymphoma. (Tr. 15, 45, 48-50, 58)
Applicant sent her mother $300 to $500 several times during 2010 and 2011. In
2012, she could no longer afford to send money to her mother. When Applicant started
working as a linguist in 2015, she resumed sending money to her mother, and she also
paid  back  a  loan  of  $1,500  she  borrowed  from  a  friend.  Applicant  admitted  she  was
delinquent  on  her  bills  during  the  time  she  was  sending  money.  She  sent  money
because  her  mother  was  in  poor  health,  and  the  money  was  needed  to  help  pay  for
medical care and medicine. Her mother passed away in August 2016. (Tr. 71-72)
SOR  ¶  2.a  alleges  a  personal  loan  account  was  referred  for  collection  in  the
amount  of  $8,480.  This  is  the  largest  debt  cited  in  the  SOR.  Applicant  took  out  a
personal loan to pay off some of the delinquent credit cards. Her last payment on this
account  was  in  about  2014.  She  has  been  unable  to  pay  on  this  account  since  her
wages are too low and her income is unstable. This debt is unresolved and unsatisfied.
(Tr.42-43)
The remaining SOR debts Applicant admitted in her SOR response, SOR ¶¶ 2.b-
2.i, 2.k, and 2.m, and 2.n, are debts that she plans to pay eventually, but at the present
time,  she  is unable  to make  payments  on  these accounts due  to  irregular income and
low  wages.  Applicant promised  to  pay  off  her delinquent  debts  once  she  obtained  her
DOD  security  clearance.  She  would  be  employed  with  a  higher  income,  and  able  to
afford  regular  payments  to  her  creditors.  Currently  these  debts  are  unresolved  and
unsatisfied.  (Tr. 44, 79)
SOR ¶ 2.j alleges that Applicant owes an apartment complex $581. She denied
this debt in her SOR response. Applicant was separated from her spouse and living in
an apartment. He became very ill, and she allowed him to move into her apartment. The
property  manager  noticed  that  she  had  an  unauthorized  resident,  and  three  dogs,
instead of two dogs, which was in violation of her lease agreement. She was asked to
vacate  the  apartment,  which  she  did.  Applicant  later  received  a  letter  from  the
apartment complex indicating she owed money due to pet stains and the odor of urine
coming from the carpet, which required the carpet to be replaced. She denied owing this
money,  and  refused  to  pay  this  disputed  debt.  After  the  hearing,  Applicant  provided
some documentation showing her ongoing dispute with this creditor. This debt has not
been resolved. (Tr. 44-47; AE C)
SOR ¶ 2.l alleges that Applicant owes a townhome complex $71, for a past due
debt. She denied this debt in her SOR response. After the hearing, Applicant provided
documentation showing  she paid this debt in 2015. This debt is fully satisfied. (Tr. 47-
48; AE B)
Other documentation Applicant submitted showed that she settled a debt with a
collection  agency  in  2016. The  delinquent  debt  totaled  $1,079.  The  creditor requested
Applicant  pay  $800,  and  they  would  close  the  account  as  settled.  Applicant  paid  this
amount in 2016. I researched the account number on her documentation, but I could not
find this particular debt pertained to any of the delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR.

"Applicant  partially  admitted  and  partially  denied,  or  she  fully  admitted  all  of  the
SOR allegations. (HE 3) She also provided mitigating information. (HE 3) Her admissions
are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the
evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 32 years old, and she is seeking a security clearance to improve her
employment  opportunities  as  a  translator.  (Tr.  5,  24;  GE  1)  For  the  last  five  years  and
currently,  she  has  been  a  freelance  translator.  (Tr.  23)  In  2004,  she  graduated  from  a
high school in the United States. (Tr. 5) In 2013, she received an associate’s degree in
business in the United States, and she is currently taking courses towards a bachelor’s
degree in accounting in the United States. (Tr. 6) In 2002, she married, and in 2005, she
divorced. (Tr. 6) In 2010 she married, and her three children are ages two, four, and six.
(Tr. 6-7) She has not served in the military of any country.
Applicant’s  spouse  and  three  children  are  U.S.  citizens,  and  they  reside  in  the
United States. (Tr. 7; GE 1) In 2000, Applicant immigrated to the United States when she
was  13  years  old.  (Tr.  20)  Applicant  obtained  U.S.  citizenship  because  of  her  father’s
status as a U.S. citizen. (Tr. 20) In 2006, her father passed away. (Tr. 20, 48) In 2011,
her mother passed away. (Tr. 52)
On  Applicant’s  security  clearance  application,  she  said  she  was  unwilling  to
renounce  her  Jordanian  citizenship;  however,  now  she  is  willing  to  renounce  her
Jordanian citizenship “[i]f it  is mandatory to grant [her a] security clearance.” (Tr. 21) In
response to the question whether she “consider[s] Jordan to be home,” she said “[t]hat’s
where  I  was  born.”  (Tr.  21)  In  her  counterintelligence  interview,  she  said  that  she  may
retire  in  Jordan  because  her father  retired  there.  (GE  3  at  4)  She  described  Jordan  as
“my country.” (GE 3 at 4) She retains a Jordanian passport, and she used it as recently
as three months before her hearing. (Tr. 21-22)
Applicant  lived  in  Jordan  from  April  2018  to  March  2019  (11  months).  (Tr.  22)
Applicant  and  her  spouse  and  children  went  to  Jordan  in  April  2018  because  her
husband was unemployed, and they believed they could stabilize their finances by living
in  Jordan.  (Tr.  22)  Her  husband  did  not  find  employment  in  Jordan,  and  they  were
financially supported by her husband’s brothers. (Tr. 54) Her husband has five brothers
in Jordan, and none of them work for the Jordanian government or military. (Tr. 54-55)
Her husband currently has employment in the United States in the private sector. (Tr. 22,
53)
The SOR raises the following foreign influence security concerns:
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges that three of Applicant’s sisters are citizens of and residents in
Jordan. (Tr. 25, 37-38) One sister does not work outside of her home, another sister is a
dentist,  and  the  third  sister  is  a  part-time,  semi-retired  engineer.  (Tr.  26,  29,  32)  Their
husbands  do  not  work  for  the  Jordanian  government  or  military.  (Tr.  52)  One  sister
residing  in  Jordan  is  a  dual  citizen  of  the  United  States  and  Jordan.  (Tr.  36-37)  She
communicates with her sisters by telephone on about a monthly basis. (Tr. 27, 33) One
of  her  sisters  is  aware  that  Applicant  is  seeking  a  security  clearance  and  that  she  is  a
linguist. (Tr. 28, 39)
SOR  ¶  1.b  alleges  one  of  Applicant’s  sisters  is  a  dual  citizen  of  Jordan  and  the
United States and a resident in Jordan. This sister has a green card and now lives in the
United States. (Tr. 34-35, 37)
SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d allege Applicant’s father-in-law and mother-in-law are citizens
and  residents  of  Jordan.  (Tr.  39-40)  Her  father-in-law  is  retired,  and  her  mother-in-law
does not work outside her home. (Tr. 40, 42) When she visited Jordan from April 2018 to
March  2019,  Applicant  and  her family  lived  in  an  apartment  above  her parents-in-law’s
residence.  (Tr.  40,  52)  Her  father-in-law  owns  the  whole  building  where  they  lived  in
Jordan. (Tr. 53) She has about weekly contact with her parents-in-law. (Tr. 41, 43)
SOR ¶ 1.e alleges Applicant’s brother holds an important position as an employee
of the Bahrain government, and he resides in that country. (Tr. 44) Applicant’s brother is
a  U.S.  citizen.  (Tr.  60-61)  He  received  a  Ph.D.  from  a  U.S.  university.  (Tr.  60-61)  He
owns an apartment in Jordan. (GE 3 at 12) Applicant believed her brother applied for a
position in the government of Bahrain; however, Applicant was not aware of whether he
actually  received  or  currently  occupies  the  position.  (Tr.  44-45)  She  is  not  close  to  her
brother,  and  she  had  infrequent  contact  with  him  on  holidays.  (Tr.  45-46)  She  has  not
had in-person contact with him for about three years. (Tr. 46) Applicant has refuted the
allegation that she has a connection to Bahrain, and connections to Bahrain will not be
further discussed in this decision.
SOR  ¶  1.f  alleges  that  Applicant  spent  about  70  months  in  Jordan  between
February 2005 and September 2016 after  she became a U.S. citizen. (Tr. 47) After her
divorce in 2005, she went to Jordan to receive support from her family. (Tr. 48) After her
father  died  in  2006,  she  went  to  Jordan  to  support  her mother.  (Tr.   48)  After  she  was
married the second time in 2010, she went to Jordan and United Arab Emirates because
of her husband’s employment. (Tr. 48)
Applicant  indicated  her  loyalty  was  split  50-50  between  the  United  States  and
Jordan. (Tr. 49; GE 4 at 1) She was never in a position where she needed to choose one
country over the other. (Tr. 49-50) She uses her Jordanian passport to enter Jordan and
her  U.S.  passport  to  enter  the  United  States.  (Tr.  57)  It  is  more  convenient  and  less
expensive to use her Jordanian passport to enter Jordan. (Tr. 57) If it was mandatory for
her to surrender her Jordanian passport to obtain a security clearance, she is willing to
do so. (Tr. 59)
Applicant  has  contact with  her family  through WhatsApp, a  computer application
that enables one to communicate with a group of people, including sending pictures and
videos  at  the  same  time.  (Tr.  46-47)  Someone  in  her  family  group,  which  includes  her
sisters, will normally send a message on WhatsApp about once a week. (Tr. 51)
Applicant has three sisters, two brothers, and eight nieces and nephews who live
in  the  United  States.  (Tr.  55-56)  She  has  a  bank  account  in  the  United  States  and  no
bank account in Jordan. (Tr. 57)
Applicant  emphasized  that  the  status  of her  relatives  was  outside  of her control.
(Tr.  14-15,  19,  59)  She  should  not  have  her  security  clearance  denied  because  of
decisions her relatives  made.  (Tr. 14, 19)  Applicant’s husband  prefers to  live  in  Jordan
because  he  misses  his  family  in  Jordan,  and  Applicant  prefers  to  live  in  the  United
States. (Tr. 48-50) She plans to return to Jordan for visits. (Tr. 50)
Jordan
In  2013  and  2014,  the  U.S.  provided  Jordan  $2.25  billion  in  loan  guarantees,
allowing  Jordan  access  to  affordable  financing  from  international  capital  markets.  The
U.S.-Jordan free trade agreement (FTA), the U.S.’s first FTA with an Arab country, has
expanded the trade relationship by reducing barriers for services, providing cutting-edge
protection  for  intellectual  property,  ensuring  regulatory  transparency,  and  requiring
effective labor and environmental enforcement. The United States and Jordan have an
“open  skies”  civil  aviation  agreement;  a  bilateral  investment  treaty;  a  science  and
technology  cooperation  agreement;  and  a  memorandum  of  understanding  on  nuclear
energy cooperation. Such agreements bolster efforts to help diversify Jordan’s economy
and  promote  growth.  Jordan  and  the  United  States  belong  to  a  number  of  the  same
international  organizations,  including  the  United  Nations,  International  Monetary  Fund,
World  Bank,  and  World  Trade  Organization.  Jordan  also  is  a  Partner  for  Cooperation
with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan (Jordan) is a constitutional monarchy ruled by
King Abdullah II bin Hussein.
The threat of terrorism remains high in Jordan. The U.S. Department of State has
assessed  Amman,  Jordan’s capital,  as  being  a  high-threat  location  for terrorist  activity
directed at or affecting official U.S. Government interests. Transnational and indigenous
terrorist  groups  in  Jordan  have  demonstrated  the  capability  to  plan  and  implement
attacks.  Violent  extremist  groups  in  Syria  and  Iraq,  including  the  Islamic  State  of  lraq
and  ash-Sham  (ISIS)  and  Jabhat  al-Nusra,  have  conducted  attacks  in  Jordan  and
continue  to  plot  against  local  security  forces,  U.S.  and  Western  interests,  and  soft
targets  such  as  high-profile  public  events,  hotels,  places  of  worship,  restaurants,
schools, and malls. Jordan’s prominent role in the effort to defeat ISIS, and its shared
borders with Iraq and Syria, increase the potential for future terrorist incidents.
Although  Jordan  remained  a  committed  partner  on  counterterrorism  and
countering  violent  extremism,  numerous  terrorist  incidents  reflect  the  current  security
situation  in  Jordan:  throughout  2017,  multiple  vehicle-borne  improvised  explosive
devices  detonated  in  and  around  a  refugee  camp  in  Syria  near  the  Jordanian  border;
and in October 2017, two homemade explosive devices were found in another refugee
camp in Jordan. Also in October 2017, the State Security Court prosecuted six people
for  sympathizing  with  ISIS,  after  they  created  social  media  accounts  to  find  Jordanian
supporters for ISIS and promote terrorist activity. In September 2017, the State Security
Court charged 16 people with a terrorist plot involving the use of automatic weapons to
carry  out  terrorist  attacks  against  public  security  services;  and  the  Jordanian  General
Intelligence  Directorate  arrested  a  10-person  ISIS  cell  that  was  planning  to  attack
security forces and tourist locations using explosive suicide belts. In 2017, the amount
of terrorist activity in Jordan was less than in previous years.
U.S. involvement in Iraq and Syria, and the U.S. Government’s policies on Israel,
have  fueled  anti-American feelings  in  Jordan.  Recent  surveys  reflect  that  over 80%  of
the  Jordanian  population  have  an  unfavorable  view  of  the  U.S.  Government.  In
December  2017,  protests  took  place  at  the  U.S.  Embassy  for  27  days  after  the
announcement that the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv would move to Jerusalem.
In  2017,  Jordan’s  most  significant  continuing  human  rights  issues  included
allegations of torture by security and government officials; arbitrary arrest and detention,
including  of  activists  and  journalists;  infringements  on  privacy  rights;  restrictions  on
freedom  of  expression;  and  restrictions  on  freedom  of  association  and  assembly.
Impunity  remained  widespread,  and  the  government  did  not  take  sufficiently  strong
steps to investigate, prosecute, or punish officials who committed abuses.
The Jordanian SSC took legal action against numerous individuals deemed to be
terrorists  under  local  law,  including  the  arrest  and  prosecution  of  men  accused  of
seeking to join Al-Nusra Front (ANF) and ISIS. Other arrests and prosecutions involved
supporting/recruiting for ISIS and attempted travel to/from Syria in  support of extremist
activities  and  also  for  “propagating  ISIL  ideology,”  a  charge  often  used  for  online
activity.

"Applicant  is  a  51-year-old  interpreter-translator  sponsored  for  a  security
clearance by a defense contractor. He was born in Afghanistan. Applicant came from a
family  of  ten  children  and  fled  Afghanistan  as  a  refugee  with  his  family  to  Pakistan  in
1988. (GX 4) He is single and has no children. He completed 12 years of education in
Afghanistan and earned a degree in information technology from a U.S. business school
in 2000. Applicant came to the United States in 1988, and became a naturalized citizen
in  1996.  (GX  2)  In  2011,  he  applied  for  a  position  as  a  subcontractor  to  mission
essential  personnel,  but  he  could  not  accept  the  position  because  his  mother  was  ill.
(GX 4) He has been working in Afghanistan as a linguist since 2017. (GX 4) Applicant
submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SCA) on January 25, 2018.
(GX 2) He has never held a security clearance.
Applicant’s  father,  who  is  now  deceased,  worked  in  Afghanistan  for  a  U.S.
government agency. Applicant’s father sent one of his sons to the United States in the
1960’s. (Tr. 27)
Applicant’s widowed mother and most of his ten siblings live in the United States
as naturalized U.S. citizens or in Canada. (Tr. 30) Applicant has limited contact with his
brother  S,  who  does  not  live  in  Afghanistan  as  alleged.  He  lives  in  the  United  States.
Applicant saw him at a wedding in the United States in 2008. None of his family live in
Afghanistan now and none are affiliated with the Afghanistan government, or any other
foreign  government.    They  do  not  know  anything  about  Applicant’s  application  for  a
security  clearance.  During  his  clearance  interview,  Applicant  stated  that  he  has  never
been  confronted  by  anyone  while  in  Afghanistan  who  seeks  information  about  his
employment.  Also,  he  has  no  sympathy,  preference  for,  or  alliance  with  foreign
nationals. He works on the Army base, working with soldiers, and is not allowed to leave
the  base.  (Tr.  37)  Applicant  had  never  returned  to  Afghanistan,  from  1988  until  his
current work, in 2017. (Tr. 38)
Applicant  disclosed  on  his  SCA  and  his  other  security  screening  questionnaire
that when his father died in  1987, property was left to the family, to be divided among
the  siblings  and  Applicant.  One  item  is  a  home  in  Afghanistan  with  an  approximate
value  of  $200,000  U.S.D.  (SOR  1.b)  The  second  item  is  a  factory  operated  in
Afghanistan with an approximate value of $1,500,000. (SOR 1.c)
Applicant explained that his one brother (S.) has taken charge of the properties
and will not sell them as he was required to do after the death of his father. The brother
S.  refuses  to  sell  the  property  and  the  rest  of  the  family  is  in  disagreement.
Relationships  have  broken  down  due  to  the  massive  disagreement.  Applicant  also
testified that he has no desire to have a part of the inheritance. If the issue were to be
resolved,  Applicant  would  give  his  share  to  his  mother.  (GX  4)  He  has  engaged  in
discussions with his brother S. as late as 2008, but his brother is managing the property
and Applicant has no authority to change the situation. (Tr. 22) He also believes that his
brother  S.  has  changed  his  name.  (Tr.  23)  Applicant  expressly  wrote  in  his  Answer  to
the  SOR  that  he  does  not  desire  ownership  of  the  properties,  and  he  considers  the
United  States  his  home.  He  also  believes  the  U.S.  dollar  amounts  are  inflated  after
being in Afghanistan.
Applicant’s other brother (D.)  also works as a linguist in Afghanistan. (Tr. 23) He
is a U.S. citizen and normally resides in the United States with his family. He spoke to
the other brother S, and confirms that he lives in the United States. (Tr. 36)
Applicant  denied  the  SOR  allegations  under  Guideline  B,  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  through
1.c, in his Answer to the SOR. He explained and answered all questions at the hearing
concerning the SOR allegations. His testimony was confirmed by his witness. Applicant
was  credible  and  assured  that  he  knew  what  to  do  if  approached  by  someone  asking
him to compromise information. He was clear that such occurrence would be reported to
security.
At the hearing, the witness testified that he has known Applicant since 2013. He
considers  himself  almost  a  brother.  The  witness  stated  that  applicant  has  given  him
good advice over the years and is always ready to help. The witness served in the U.S.
military  and  was  honorably  discharged  in  2015.  He  noted  that  Applicant  offered  the
witness a place to live when he left the service. (Tr. 54) The witness emphasized that he
trusts Applicant fully. Applicant has taken care of the witnesses’ special needs child at
certain times. (Tr. 56).
Applicant  currently  earns  about  $71,000  a  year  as  a  linguist.  (Tr.  39)  He  is
renting a home. He has a car. He is saving money for retirement. He has taken many
positions and worked hard to go to school and earn a living in the United States. In his
current position, he translates and advises the officers of the U.S. Government and the
Afghan government. He travels on missions and is sometimes in dangerous situations.
(Tr. 43)
Applicant  submitted  five  statements  from  character  references.  Three  U.S.
military officers who have worked with Applicant in Afghanistan in 2018 support him for
a  security  clearance.  They  each  describe  Applicant  as  among  the  best  of  29  linguists
working  with  the  battalion.  He  is  dedicated,  reliable,  and  works  well  with  sensitive
missions.  (AX  A)  Applicant  is  an  extremely  valuable  member  of  the  team  and  has
contributed significantly. He has a knowledge of both Dari and Pashtu. Under stressful
situations, he has remained composed, even under a high profile attack.
Applicant  conducted  280  missions  in  the  area  of  air  assault  assignments.
Applicant maintains an exceptional work ethic. He maintained a strong security posture.
He  is  adaptive  and  works  with  adjacent  units.  His  knowledge  of  culture,  history,  and
current  events  in  Afghanistan  have  shaped  the  operating  environment.  (AX  B,  C)
Applicant’s employer vouches for him and wrote that he has received nothing but praise
for Applicant. Applicant’s employer worked for 34 years in the military and recommends
Applicant for a  security  clearance.  Applicant  submitted  three  letters  of appreciation for
his dedication and sacrifice in 2018 and 2019.
",True
"Applicant is a 38-year-old linguist who has been serving in the same position for
about  two  years.  He  has  received  multiple  commendations  and  positive  certificates  of
performance  in  that  capacity,  and  recently  was  recommended  for  his  most  recent
assignment. He earned an engineering degree before coming to the United States.
In 2003, during the conflict between Iraq and the United States, Applicant saw a
group  of  fedayeen  soldiers  preparing  to  ambush  incoming  U.S.  forces.  He  stealthily
moved ahead about two miles to warn an incoming U.S. convoy of what was waiting for
them ahead. (Tr. 37-38) With Applicant’s help, the U.S. forces were able to  detain the
guerrilla  commandos.  Of  that  event,  Applicant  noted:  “I  was  thinking  if  all  the  Army
came  to  change  the  life  [in  Iraq],  so  we  can  speak,  we  can  vote,  we  can  have
democracy  in  Iraq.  [Do  I]  just  watch  and  wait  on  the  line  and  just  watch  and  wait  for
things  to happen  or help  these people  to  achieve  the .  .  .  noble  thing  they  came for?”
(Tr. 38) Shortly  thereafter, he  was  asked by  the  head  of  the  convoy  to  help them  with
their immediate mission. He continued to aid and support U.S. forces for some time.
In 2009, when United States troops prepared to return home from the conflict in
Iraq,  Applicant  wanted  to  follow  suit.  He  had  become  friends  with  many  of  the
Americans  he  had  met  and  wanted  to  live  in  the  United  States.  Also,  Applicant  was
unsure whether he would be safe remaining behind in Iraq. That year, Applicant and his
brother  moved  to  this  country  after  his  younger  brother  finished  college.  Applicant
secured a green card, then bought a house and found work, first in retail, then with an
association helping mentor children.
In  about  2013,  the  brothers  became  United  States  citizens.  In  2017,  Applicant
found  he  was  too  old  to  enter  the  military,  but  was  eligible  for  a  linguist  position
supporting the United States. To that end, he earned a competitive certificate for literary
language  (linguist)  from  a  leading  international  linguistics  entity  in  this  country.  It  is  in
that capacity he has worked ever since.
Both  of  Applicant’s  parents  are  deceased.  Applicant  has  essentially  raised  his
younger  brother  since  their  mother  died,  when  the  sibling  was  11  years  old.  Their
emigration from Iraq took place soon after the younger sibling graduated from college.
When they arrived in the United States in 2009, Applicant intentionally chose not to live
in an enclave of Iraqi immigrants. He noted: “if we are going to live [here], we are going
to  live  in  this country  like  any  people born  here. We don’t  have  to  create  a population
who accommodate you. . . . I wanted to . . . blend in, to feel the normal life here that we
don’t have . . . in Iraq.” (Tr. 28)
Today, Applicant’s brother is a commissioned officer in the United States military.
When he  is  in  the  United States,  he  lives  with  Applicant. Applicant’s spouse  was  born
and raised in the United States. They live in the same area as four of his wife’s siblings,
all of whom treat Applicant as part of their immediate family. None of them are aware of
what he does for work. (Tr. 19) The couple has no children.
Applicant’s  uncle  in  Iraq  is  or  was  an  assistant  to  an  intelligence  official  at  the
national level. (Tr. 58-59) In that capacity, he has worked closely with U.S. forces. (Tr.
59)  He  is  the  husband  of  one  of  Applicant’s  maternal  aunts.  At  one  point  before
Applicant  moved  to  the  United  States,  the  uncle  and  Applicant  worked  in  adjacent
buildings in Iraq, helping U.S. forces. (Tr. 61) Any personal interaction was incidental to
their  respective  work  duties.  Applicant  later  met  him  in  February  2017  in  the  United
States,  at  the  home  of  a  cousin  who  had  come  to  the  United  States  before  Applicant
(2007) seeking asylum. (Tr. 29)
While helping his cousin by running errands, Applicant returned to her residence
one day to find the uncle had come to visit. (Tr. 23) As he had been helping his cousin
for  several  hours  and  it  was  getting  late,  Applicant  had  to  head  home  after  15-20
minutes. It was Applicant’s first and only contact with this uncle since Applicant moved
to the United States. (Tr. 23-24) The two did not discuss Applicant’s work or aspirations.
Applicant  has  no  plan  or  intention  to  initiate  contact  with  his uncle  again.  (Tr.  24)  The
two  men  are  not  close.  Should,  for  whatever  reason,  the  uncle  initiate  contact  with
Applicant, Applicant will report the contact appropriately. (Tr. 25)
Also in Iraq and both a citizen and resident is Applicant’s aunt. She is in her mid-
60s,  retired from  a  private  sector career,  and  is  now  something  of  a  shut-in.  Applicant
knows very little about her. She is the mother of his American cousin, through whom he
had  seen  his  uncle  in  the  United  States.  Applicant  and  the  aunt  met  at  the  cousin’s
home in about 2016, a year before he met his uncle. Their meeting lasted less than 30
minutes. They also had limited social media contact in 2017. (Tr. 57) That was their last
contact.  This  aunt  is  not  a  spouse  of  the  uncle  at  issue.  She  knows  nothing  of
Applicant’s work. He is not close to this aunt and he has no intention of communicating
with her in the future. (Tr. 57)
Applicant is very happy living his present life, with his wife, brother, cousin, and
some dear neighbors nearby. He loves his home and neighborhood.  His closest friend
and next door neighbor is a native-born U.S. citizen, as is his wife. (Tr. 36) In rating his
family  on  a  1-10  scale,  with  10  being  the  most  feelings  of  affection  and  connection
possible, Applicant rates his brother and wife as “10,” his wife’s local siblings as “9,” a
cousin  (described  below)  as  a  “7  or 8,”  and  the  uncle  and  aunt  at  issue  in  this  matter
who  are  remaining  as citizens  and  residents of  Iraq as  “0.” (Tr. 21-22) Also  in  the mix
are  his  other neighbors,  children  he mentors  and peers,  with  whom he  has  developed
an affinity.
Applicant is almost half way toward paying off a mortgage on a home valued at
over $550,000. He has both a savings account and a 401(k) account here. He sends no
money to family or interests in Iraq, nor does he maintain contact with any individuals in
that country. (Tr. 62) Except for a week-long visit to Iraq in 2018, which he quietly took
without informing his family in order to visit his mother’s grave, he has not been to Iraq
since  2009.  He  has  no  property,  assets,  or  interests  in  Iraq,  and  his  Iraqi  passport
expired in 2009.
Applicant introduced three character witnesses. The first was a lieutenant colonel
with 26 years of U.S. military service who met Applicant on a deployment. The two hit it
off, and the officer selected Applicant as his interpreter. (Tr. 73) Thus began a lifelong
professional  and  personal  relationship  that  has  seen  them  collaborate  on  multiple
assignments. (Tr. 74) He has been impressed by Applicant’s professionalism, secrecy,
and American values, and highly recommends that he be granted a security clearance.
A U.S. military sergeant with 35 years of experience also highly recommends that
Applicant be granted a security clearance. The two have worked together off and on for
many years. Today, they communicate a couple of times a month socially. The witness
was most impressed by incidents in which Applicant helped thwart a kidnapping and a
robbery. (Tr. 89) In addition, this witness worked with Applicant’s uncle in Iraq during the
2003-4 and 2007-8 timeframes. He considers the uncle at issue trustworthy. (Tr. 91)
A  third  witness  met  and  became  friends  with  Applicant  during  the  period  after
Applicant came to the United States, but before he became a linguist. At the association
where  Applicant  mentored  children,
to  be  “very
dependable, reliable, and trustworthy as an employee, so [they] got to know each other
fairly  well.”  (Tr.  95)  As  a  former  Federal  Bureau  of  Investigation  agent  with  24  years
experience, and having held a Top Secret/SCI clearance, he recommends Applicant for
a security clearance. (Tr. 96) He finds Applicant to be reliable and very patriotic. (Tr. 97)

",True
"Applicant  admitted  each  of  the  allegations  in  the  SOR.    After  a  thorough  and
careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of
fact.
Applicant is 32 years old, and is not legally married, but has a cohabitant, and a
daughter.  He has also completed some college, and is currently applying for a positon
as a linguist.  A security clearance is required in connection with his employment with a
defense contractor.
Applicant was born in Bagdad, Iraq in July 1986.  He grew up in Iraq and left in
2005 to go to Syria, because it was safer for him.  He also had a job opportunity in Syria
working for a construction company.  In November 2010, Applicant came to the United
States  as  a  refugee  through  the  International  Organization  for  Migration.    He  traveled
from Iraq to Jordan, New York and Phoenix.  As an Iraqi national translator working with
the  United  States  Army,  his  life  was  threatened,  and  he  was  given  an  opportunity  to
come to the United States.  On August 18, 2016, Applicant became a naturalized U.S.
citizen.  (Government Exhibit 3.)
Applicant’s  mother  and  father  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Iraq.    His  father  is
retired  from  the  Iraqi  Ministry  of  Water  Resources.    He  was  a  well  driller.    His  is  no
longer  affiliated  with  the  foreign  government.    Applicant’s  mother  has  never  worked
outside of the home to his knowledge.   Applicant also has five brothers and one sister
who  are  citizens and  residents  of Iraq.   Two  of  his  brothers are employed  by  the  Iraqi
police.    One  of  his  brothers  is  employed  by  the  Iraqi  Counter-Terrorism  Service.
Another brother is a self-employed electrician, and another brother is unemployed.  His
sister  is  a  school  student.    From  November  2010  to  the  present,  Applicant  maintains
contact  with  is  family  in  Iraq  and  speaks  with  them  about  once  a  month.    In  2013,  he
traveled to Iraq to visit them.  (Government Exhibit 3.)
Applicant’s spouse/cohabitant was also born in Bagdad, Iraq. She is a citizen of
Iraq and a permanent resident of the United States.  She and Applicant were married in
a Muslim ceremony in the United States.  Since their marriage is not legal in the United
States, Applicant did not believe he had to list her on his security clearance application.
(Government Exhibit 4.)
Applicant’s mother and father-in-law are citizens of Iraq and permanent residents
of the United States.  Applicant maintains contact with his in-laws weekly by telephone
or in person.  He also has other relatives in Iraq that he maintains weekly contact with
including  an  aunt,  a  brother-in-law,  and  two  sister-in-laws  that  were  not  listed  on  his
security clearance application but developed during the security clearance investigation.
(Government Exhibit 4.)
I  have  taken  administrative  notice  of  the  information  provided  concerning  the
Federal Republic of Iraq.  Iraq is a federal parliamentary republic.  The President of Iraq
is indirectly elected by a Council of Representatives to serve a 4-year term (eligible for a
second).  Although Iraq is an ally of the United States, the U.S. Government considers
the  potential  personal  security  threats  to  U.S.  government  personnel  in  Iraq  to  be
serious  enough  to  require  them  to  live  and  work  under  strict  security  guidelines.    The
U.S. State Departments warns that U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high risk of violence and
kidnapping  and advises  U.S.  citizens  to  not  travel to  Iraq.    The  current  travel advisory
level is Level 4.  Do not travel.  Within areas under  the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria
(ISIS) control, the Iraqi government has little or no ability to exercise control and ensure
public safety.  Arbitrary or unlawful killings are rampant.   People belonging to religious
and  ethnic  minorities,  and  people  who  express  support  for  the  government  of  Iraq  or
Western  institutions,  are  at  grave  risk  in  these  areas  and  may  face  kidnapping,
imprisonment  or  execution.    Terrorist  groups  continue  to  mount  a  large  number  of
attacks throughout the country.  Iraq is likely to face a lengthy period of political turmoil
and conflict as it struggles to rebuild, reconstitute the Iraqi state, maintain pressure on
ISIS,  and  rein  in  the  Iranian-backed  Shia  militias  that  pose  an  enduring  threat  to  US
personnel.    ISIS  will  remain  a  terrorist  and  insurgent  threat  and  the  group  will  seek  to
exploit  Sunni  discontent  to  conduct  attacks  and  try  to  regain  Iraqi  territory.    Violence
continues largely fueled by the actions of ISIS.  (HE 1).
A  number  of  foreign  contacts  have  been  omitted  from  Applicant’s  security
clearance  application  because  Applicant  claims  that  he  either  overlooked  the  entry  by
mistake,  he  did  not  understand  the  question,  or  thought  he  did  not  have  to  list  them.

"Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  37  years  old  and  single.  He  has  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  electrical
engineering.  He  is  applying  for  national  security  eligibility  and  a  security  clearance  in
connection with his prospective employment with a defense contractor as a linguist.
Paragraph 1 – Guideline B (Foreign Influence)
Applicant  was  born  in  the  Kurdish  area  of  northern  Iraq  in  1982.  Beginning  in
2007,  after the  invasion  of  Iraq,  Applicant  worked  with  the  Multi-National Force  in  Iraq
as  a  linguist.  He  worked  with  various  American  units  in  Iraq  until  2012.  (Government
Exhibit 1 at Section 13A; Tr. 34-42.)
After immigrating to the United States in 2012, Applicant has worked primarily in
private  industry  outside  the  defense  field.  He  also  attended  college  to  advance  his
engineering  education,  with  the  hope  of  eventually  earning  a  master’s  degree  and
working  in  the  engineering  field  in  the  United  States.  As  of  the  date  of  the  hearing
Applicant  was  working  as  a  systems  engineer  for  a  large  American  city.  He  hoped  to
receive a security clearance and resume work as a linguist, which will put him in a better
financial  position  to  continue  his  education.  (Government  Exhibit  1  at  Section  13A,
Government Exhibit 3 at internal Exhibit E; Applicant Exhibit D at 1, 3; Tr. 8-9, 44-47.)
Applicant  became  a  naturalized  American  citizen  on  July  19,  2017.  Applicant
renounced his Iraqi citizenship  when  he  became  an American  citizen.  He has no  Iraqi
identification of any type. Applicant has no financial contacts with Iraq. His savings are
in the United States. (Government Exhibit 3 at internal Exhibits F, J, K, L, and M; Tr. 44,
75-79.)
Applicant’s  parents  live  in  the  Kurdish  area  of  northern  Iraq.  He  also  has  four
older  sisters  and  four  younger  brothers.  Three  of  his  sisters  and  three  of  his  brothers
are married. Applicant contacts his parents by telephone about once a week. He talks to
his brothers and sisters about once a year. Several of his relatives work for the Kurdish
regional government as teachers or minor bureaucrats. He traveled to Iraq in early 2019
to visit his family, with the knowledge and approval of his prospective employer. During
that trip he used his American passport. That was his first visit since he left to come to
the United States. He provides no financial support to any of his family members in Iraq.
None of his relatives have knowledge of Applicant’s job, or the fact that he is applying
for a security clearance. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section 18; Tr. 50-75.)
Applicant
filled  out  a
screening
questionnaire  in  2017.  (Government  Exhibit  2.)  He  was  also  interviewed  by  an
investigator from the Office of Personnel Management in 2017. (Government Exhibit 3
at 7-11.) The information provided by Applicant during these occasions  was consistent
with his testimony during the hearing.

Mitigation
Applicant  is  proud  to  be  an  American  citizen,  and  to  have  assisted  the  U.S.
military in Iraq. He feels no sense of loyalty to Iraq, stating, “[M]y only loyalty is going to
be to the United States of America.” (Tr. 79.)
Applicant  was  a  highly  respected  and  successful  linguist  while  working  in  Iraq.
This  is  shown  by  letters  of  appreciation  and  certificates  of  achievement  presented  to
him  with  regard  to  his  work  during  the  period  from  2007  through  2012.  He  was
described  as  a  person  of  “integrity,”  with  a  sense  of  allegiance  to  the  soldiers  and
civilians he worked with. (Applicant Exhibits A and D at 2, 4-5.)
Friends  of  Applicant  who  knew  him  both  in  Iraq,  and  since  he  moved  to  the
United  States,  also  supplied  letters of  recommendation. The  writers  describe him  as a
truthful and humble person. (Government Exhibit 3 at internal Exhibit C at 3-8, 10.)
Applicant is very aware of his  responsibilities if he obtains a security clearance,
particularly if advances are made toward him or his relatives. As stated, he informed his
prospective employer of his travel to Iraq this year. (Applicant Exhibit G; Tr. 54-55, 81-
82.)
Iraq
I take administrative notice of the following facts: In 2003, The United States led
a  coalition  to  remove  Saddam  Hussein  from  power  in  Iraq.  After  free  elections,  Iraq’s
new  government  took  office.  Despite  the  elections  and  new  government,  Iraq  remains
engulfed  in  violence,  perpetrated  by  Al  Qaeda  terrorists  and  other  insurgents.
Numerous attacks and kidnappings have targeted the U.S. Armed Forces, contractors,
and other civilians, as well as Iraqis. Even with aggressive governmental action against
terrorists,  the  threat  of  terrorism  in  Iraq  remains  high.  Terrorist  groups  conduct
intelligence activities as effectively as state intelligence services. (Government Exhibit 4:
Attachments.)

"Applicant is a 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his  current  employer  for  about  two  years.  He  has  a  bachelor’s  degree.  He  has  never
married, and he has no children.
Applicant  was  born  in  Iraq  to  Iraqi  parents.  When  he  was  young,  he  and  his
father would listen to Voice of America on the radio, and he would imagine what it would
be like to live in the United States. While in college in 2004 to 2005, he volunteered to
work for the U.S. military. He worked under dangerous conditions in Iraq as a linguist for
the  U.S.  military  during  summers  while  he  was  in  college  and  full  time  after  he
graduated from college. Like the U.S. military forces he was supporting, he came under
fire. Because of his work, he was eligible for a special immigrant visa. He immigrated to
the United States in 2010. He became a U.S. citizen in 2017.
Applicant’s  father  is  deceased.  His  mother  and  six  siblings  are  citizens  and
residents of Iraq. None of his family have visited him in the United States. Applicant has
not  seen  his  mother  and  siblings  since  2014.  He  has  worked  in  Iraq  for  a  defense
contractor  since  2017.  He  has  not  talked  to  any  of  his  family  in  Iraq  since  he  went  to
Iraq in 2017. One of Applicant’s brother worked for the U.S. military in Iraq as a linguist.
With the exception of one of his siblings who is a teacher, to his knowledge, none of his
family members have any current connection to the Iraqi government.
Applicant  had  an  interpreter friend  in  Iraq.  That  friend  immigrated  to  the  United
States  and  is  now  a  permanent  resident.  Applicant  credibly  testified  that  his  family  in
Iraq could not be used to coerce or intimidate him into revealing classified information.
Applicant  submitted  documents  and  letters  from  members  of  the  U.S.  military
attesting  to  his  outstanding  service  as  a  linguist  and  cultural  advisor  in  support  of
combat operations. One military officer wrote:
I  have  had  the  pleasure  of  working  with  [Applicant]  closely,  especially
during the trying times of a combat deployment. I have always witnessed

Another officer wrote:
Despite living in the most austere, remote location in our particular combat
theater,  [Applicant]  always  maintained  a  positive  attitude  and  willingness
to work around the clock to support our detachment’s operations.

"Applicant is 52 years old. She was born in Columbia. She attended high school
and one year of college there. She immigrated to the United  States in 1987  when she
was  21  years  old.  Upon  her  arrival,  she  studied  English.  She  married  her  husband  in
1991. She became a U.S. citizen in 1993. She graduated from a U.S. university in 1994
with a bachelor’s degree. She earned a master’s degree in 2008. She and her husband
have three daughters born in the United States. (Tr. 71-73, 47; GE 1) She is a dual citizen
of Columbia. (Tr. 63)
In 1995, Applicant started her current position with a defense contractor. She has
held a security clearance since 1995. This is her second security clearance investigation.
(Tr. 73, 79-80)
Applicant’s parents were born in Colombia and lived there until they died. She has
six siblings (three brothers and three sisters), all of whom were born in Columbia and are
naturalized U.S. citizens residing in the United States. (GE 1, 2) After her parents died,
Applicant and her siblings inherited their family home in Columbia. It is a four-flat building,
worth about $150,000. One of her sisters, who is retired, stays in one flat when she visits
Columbia. The other three flats are rented. The rental monies are used to maintain the
building. Applicant does not receive income from the property. (Tr. 85-88, 99)
1 Applicant waived her right to have 15-days’ notice of this hearing. (Tr. 9)
2 Although the SOR raises security concerns related to Applicant’s cousin and friend, who are citizens and
residents  of  Columbia,  and  Applicant’s  ownership  of  property  there,  the  Government  did  not  submit  a
Request for Administrative Notice for Columbia, relating to a heightened risk assessment.
Applicant has two living relatives who are citizens and residents of Columbia, an
elderly aunt and a cousin. She periodically sends her aunt $100 for medicine.  (Tr. 89)
She speaks to her cousin two or three times a year.  That cousin manages the family’s
apartment building in Columbia. Applicant also has a close friend from high school, who
is a citizen and resident of Columbia, with whom she maintains contact. Applicant speaks
to her high school girlfriend every month, and connects through the internet. She and her
girlfriend talk with other high school friends through online group chats. Applicant does
not discuss her employment with  her relatives or friends. Applicant visited Columbia in
1995 and in 2015, at which time she saw her girlfriend. (Tr. 101-105)
Applicant’s husband testified. He is 49 years old. He was born in Iraq, while his
family was working and living there. He and his family left Iraq when he was five years
old and returned to their home in Jordan. He immigrated to the United States after high
school and subsequently attended a U.S. university. He became a U.S. naturalized citizen
in 1998. (Tr. 21-22) He has worked for a state agency since 1991. (Tr. 17) He holds dual
citizenship with Jordan. (Tr. 52)
Applicant’s husband had five siblings, four are living. One brother is a retired major
with the Palestinian Authority (PA), where he had worked as a police officer from 1996 to
2018, while residing in Ramallah, West Bank. He no longer resides in Ramallah. He is a
resident and citizen of Jordan. Applicant’s husband speaks to him quarterly by telephone.
He saw him in June 2018, when Applicant’s other brother had heart surgery in Jordan.
That brother is a citizen and resident of Jordan. He retired from a public works’ position
with a Jordanian government department. (Tr. 43-44, 52-55, 61)
Applicant’s husband’s youngest sister works for a zoning department in Ramallah,
the city in which she and her husband live. She is a Jordanian citizen. Applicant’s husband
said he sends a couple hundred dollars a year to members of this sister’s family as gifts.
(Tr. 27-28) He has never discussed the security situation in the West Bank with this sister.
His oldest sister worked for a ministry of the Palestinian government in Ramallah. Since
retiring in 2016, that sister moved back to Jordan where her children live.3 (Tr. 56-61)
Applicant’s husband said he does not believe any of his siblings, who have lived
in or traveled to the West Bank, have visited Gaza in the past 15 years during which it
was taken over by Hamas, a U.S. designated terrorist organization. (Tr. 61; HE 1) His last
visit to Ramallah was in 2009, when his mother was there and became ill and died. (Tr.
26)
Applicant’s husband testified that his brother, the retired major, is aware that his
wife is seeking a security clearance because he asked that brother for his certificate of
training with the United States Security Coordinator when he worked for the PA. (AE D)
He said the other siblings do not know many details about Applicant’s job and have not

analyzing disqualifying conditions. It may be considered in analyzing mitigating conditions and the whole-
person concept.
discussed  it  with  him.  (Tr.  62)  Applicant’s  husband  testified  that  he  has  no  ties  to  the
Jordanian government or to the PA. (Tr. 48-49) He does not have plans to visit Jordan
unless there is another medical emergency with a family member. (Tr. 64)
Applicant’s husband and his four siblings inherited a three-floor building in Jordan
upon  his  father’s  death.  One  of  his  brothers  lives  in  it  and  manages  the  rental  units.
Applicant’s husband said he does not receive any income from the rental proceeds. (Tr.
30-32) The unit has an estimated value of $100,000. (Tr. 65)
Applicant traveled to Jordan once in 1998, to meet her husband’s family after they
married. She and her husband stayed for two weeks. While there, she met her husband’s
sisters and brothers. She informed her employer of the trip prior to leaving. (Tr. 76-78,
105) Applicant does not speak to her in-laws in Jordan or the West Bank. She said the
language barrier makes it difficult to communicate with one another. She has no plans to
visit Jordan the future. (Tr. 106)
Applicant and her husband have assets in the United States. They own a home
which  has  an  estimated  value  of  $300,000.  (Tr.  89)  She  has  about  $300,000  in  her
retirement account. She and her husband are providing financial support to their daughter
who is attending college. The two younger daughters live at home. (Tr. 108; GE 1) She
and her husband have no intention to move to Columbia or invest in the country. (Tr. 94)
Applicant expressed her love for the United States. She said she and her husband
have no sympathies with any terrorist organization. They have no intention of moving or
retiring to another country, such as Jordan. They intend to live in the United States. Her
children have no intention of visiting Columbia or the Middle East. (Tr. 49, 94-96, 105,

Applicant  submitted  her  2018-year-end  performance  review  from  her  employer.
Her supervisor gave her an over-all assessment as an “excellent performer.” (AE C)
Jordan
I  have  taken  administrative  notice  of  facts  contained  in  U.S.  Government
pronouncements  concerning  Jordan,  as  outlined  in  HE  1.  Jordan  is  a  small,  Middle
Eastern  country  governed  by  a  constitutional  monarchy.  Jordan  has  a  pro-Western
foreign  policy,  and  has  had  close  relations  with  the  United  States  for  more  than  forty
years.  Torture,  arbitrary  arrest,  prolonged  detention,  denial  of  due  process,  and
restrictions  on  freedom  of  speech  are  human  rights  problems  in  Jordan.  Despite
aggressive  governmental  action  against  terrorists,  the  threat  of  terrorism  in  Jordan
remains  high.  Terrorists  in  Jordan  target  U.S.  interests  to  exploit  and  undermine  U.S.
national security interests. Terrorist groups conduct intelligence activities as effectively as
state intelligence services. The U.S. State Department issues travel advisories for U. S.
citizens traveling to Jordan.
Israel: West Bank and Gaza
I  have  taken  administrative  notice  of  facts  contained  in  U.S.  Government
pronouncements concerning the West Bank and Gaza, as outlined in HE 2. As a result of
the 1967 Arab-Israel War, Israel occupied the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Golan Heights, and
East Jerusalem. In 1994, the Palestinians established the Palestinian Authority (PA) in
the  Gaza  Strip  and West  Bank,  whose  purpose  was  to  provide  police  and  security  for
civilians living in the areas. The PA lacked many of the powers and authorities of a full-
fledged nation state. In June 2007, Hamas, a U.S. designated terrorist organization, took
control  of  the  Gaza  Strip  after  a  brief  civil  war.  Hamas  exerts  significant  control  and
influence in the West Bank, and generally among Palestinians, due to its popularity for its
resistance to Israel. Several other groups operating in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza
have  been  designated  as  Foreign  Terrorist  Organizations  (FTOs)  by  the  State
Department.
Hamas engages in violent resistance to Israeli occupation of the West Bank and
the  Gaza  Strip.  Hamas  receives  assistance  from  Iran,  Syria,  and  the  Lebanese  Shiite
militant group Hezbollah. Several other foreign terrorist organizations operate in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. The State Department urges caution when traveling to the West
Bank.  U.S.  government  personnel  and  their  families  are  allowed  only  on  specifically
identified  routes,  and  all  other  personal  travel  in  the  West  Bank,  unless  specifically
authorized for mission-approved purposes, is prohibited. U.S. citizens have been injured,
killed, or kidnapped by terrorists in the West Bank.

"Applicant  denied  all  of  the  SOR  allegations.  He  also  provided  some  admissions
and  mitigating  information  in  his  response.  His  admissions  are  incorporated  herein  as
findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 43 years old, and he is seeking a security clearance to enable him to
become a linguist in Iraq employed by a DOD contractor. (Tr. 6, 29; GE 1) Applicant has
been  unemployed  since  April  2016,  except  for  some  part-time  employment  in  2019  for
about  three  months.  (Tr.  41-45).  He  lives  with  and  takes  care  of  his  mother,  who  is
disabled. (GE 3 at 4-6) From April 2009 to April 2016, he worked in the area of petroleum
as a senior technical editor. (Tr. 34) He has not served in the military of any country. (Tr.
8,  29;  GE  3  at  8)  He  was  married  from  2009  to  2014.  (Tr.  8-9)  His  “marriage”  was
actually a Muslim joining ceremony, and he did not consider it a legally-binding marriage.
(Tr. 35-36;  GE  3  at  5)  Because  he  did not have  a  legally-binding  marriage,  he has not
obtained a divorce. (GE 3 at 5) He does not have any children. In 1996, he was awarded
a bachelor’s degree in chemical engineering in Iraq. (Tr. 6, 29; GE 3 at 4) He attended
graduate school in Malaysia in environmental compliance engineering. (Tr. 7, 29-31; GE
3  at  4)  Unless  stated  otherwise,  the  information  in  this  paragraph  is  from  Applicant’s
SCA. (GE 1)
Financial Considerations
The credit reports and SOR list eight delinquent debts totaling $14,393 as follows:

¶ 1.h alleges a utility debt placed for collection for $238. (Tr. 87; GE 4-6)
In February 2016, Applicant visited UAE for about one month. (Tr. 62; GE 2 at 18)
From July to September 2016, he stayed in UAE for more than 30 days. (Tr. 63; GE 1;
GE  2  at  18-19)  From  August  to  September  2016,  he  visited  Bulgaria,  the  United
Kingdom,  Romania,  Kuwait,  and  Lebanon.  (GE  2  at  19)  In  October  2016,  he  visited
Egypt,  Oman,  and  UAE.  (GE  2  at  20)  In  April  2017,  he  visited  the  United  Kingdom,
Spain, and Turkey. (GE 2 at 5, 20) In May 2017, he visited Canada. (GE 2 at 20) From
June  to  July  2017,  he  stayed  in  UAE  for  more  than  30  days.  In  June  2017,  he  visited
Iraq. (Tr. 64-65; GE 2 at 21) In August 2017, he visited the country of Georgia and UAE.
(GE 2 at 22) In May 2018, he visited Canada. (Tr. 69) In March 2019, he visited Iceland
and  France.  (Tr.  69)  From  July  to  September  2019,  he  visited  the  United  Kingdom,
Germany,  and  Greece.  (Tr.  67-68)  He  said  he  funded  his  travel  with  money  from  his
mother  and  his  savings.  (Tr.  70)  He  said  he  did  not  use  his  travel  funds  to  pay  his
delinquent  debts  because  he  believed  a  debt  resolution  or  consolidation  company
(DRCC)  resolved  or paid  all  of  his delinquent  debts.  (Tr. 110)  Unless  stated otherwise,
the information in this paragraph is from Applicant’s SCA. (GE 1)
During  Applicant’s  November  2017  counterintelligence  screening  questionnaire,
he  was  advised  that  his  credit  report  contained  seven  unpaid  debts  totaling  about
$12,500.  (GE  2  at  9-12)  Applicant  said  he  could  not  afford  to  pay  the  debts,  and  he
believed a debt resolution or consolidation company (DRCC) either resolved his debts or
he was using DRCC to pay his debts. (GE 2 at 9-12) After he became unemployed, he
received food stamps, and his primary source of revenue has been from his mother. (GE
3 at 5)
In  his  February  26,  2018  Office  of  Personnel  Management  personal  subject
interview (OPM PSI), Applicant said he had a debt consolidation agreement from 2014 to
2015.  (GE  3  at  6) The  OPM  investigator  confronted  him  with  nine  delinquent  accounts
based  on  his  credit  report.  (GE  3  at  7)  In  October  2018,  Applicant  acknowledged  the
accuracy  of  the  summary  of  his  OPM  interview.  (GE  3  at  12)  Applicant  accepted
responsibility for the debts, and he said he made $400 monthly payments for 18 months
to  DRCC  to  resolve  his debts.  (GE  3 at  7) He  said  the  accounts became delinquent  in
2014 because he was providing financial support to a friend who was ill (Tr. 51-52, 89-
90);  however,  he  said  he  had  no  reason  to  believe  that  DRCC  had  not  resolved  his
debts. (GE 3 at 7)
Applicant  signed  a  contract  with  DRCC  in  October 2015.  (AE  B at  12)  Applicant
said he paid DRCC for about 12 or 18 months, and they promised to pay off his debts.
(Tr. 94-102, 105-106) Applicant agreed to pay  DRCC $445 monthly from October 2015
to September 2017 to address six debts including the four debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a
($3,900), 1.b ($3,744), 1.c ($3,676), and 1.d ($927), and two additional non-SOR debts
($11,155)  and  ($613).  (AE  B  at  8-10)  Applicant’s  DRCC  contract  specified  that  funds
paid  to  DRCC  are  not  paid  to  creditors,  and  those  funds  received  from  Applicant  are
used  to  pay  DRCC’s  fees.  (AE  B  at  6)  The  contract  states  that  DRCC  is  “not  a  debt
consolidation or debt settlement company,” and DRCC does not settle debts. (AE B at 6)
Applicant provided emails from DRCC from October 16, 2015, to August 2, 2016.
(AE A) These emails corroborate Applicant’s statement that he was paying DRCC’s fee
for about one year. DRCC provided information in the emails about how to avoid identity
theft and how he  could increase his income.  DRCC also sent correspondence to credit
reporting companies and creditors. (AE A) Applicant did not submit the correspondence
DRCC  sent  to  financial  entities  into  evidence  at  his  hearing.  (Tr.  101-104;  AE  A)
Applicant  did  not  provide  any  evidence  of  any  payments  or  of  any  efforts  to  initiate
payment plans with any of the SOR creditors by Applicant or DRCC.
Applicant expects to earn about $6,700 monthly if he is hired as a linguist. (Tr. 48)
If he is hired as a linguist he intends to pay his debts within a short time after beginning
this employment. (Tr. 88)
Foreign Influence
From 1996 to 2000, Applicant attended college in Malaysia. (GE 2 at 1, 4) From
2000 to 2004, he lived in the United Kingdom. (GE 2 at 1) From 2004 to 2010, he lived
in Iraq, and in 2010, he emigrated from Iraq to the United States  with his parents as a
refugee. (Tr. 37; GE 2 at 1, 3) He also brought his “wife” to the United States; several
months later, he lost contact with her; and he was unable to provide information about
his former wife. (Tr. 35-41) In 2015, Applicant was naturalized as a U.S. citizen. (GE 2
at 3)
Applicant repeatedly emphasized that he is loyal to the United States and had no
preference  for  any  other  foreign  country.  The  Naturalization  Oath  of  Allegiance  to  the
United States of America states:
I  hereby  declare,  on  oath,  that  I  absolutely  and  entirely  renounce  and
abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or
sovereignty, of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen;
that  I  will  support  and  defend  the  Constitution  and  laws  of  the  United
States  of  America  against  all  enemies,  foreign  and  domestic;  that  I  will
bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I will bear arms on behalf
of  the  United  States  when  required  by  the  law;  that  I  will  perform
noncombatant  service  in  the  Armed  Forces  of  the  United  States  when
required by the law; that I will perform work of national importance under
civilian  direction  when  required  by  the  law;  and  that  I  take  this obligation
freely,  without any  mental reservation  or purpose of evasion;  so  help me
God.
The  language  of  the  current  Oath  of  Allegiance  is  found  in  the  Code  of  Federal

oath-allegiance-united-states-america. I found Applicant’s statements about his loyalty to
the  United  States  to  be  sincere  and  credible.  I  am  convinced  that  Applicant  is  a  loyal
U.S. citizen.
The SOR alleges in ¶ 3.a that Applicant’s sister is a citizen of Iraq and a resident
of UAE, in ¶ 3.b that his brother-in-law is a resident of UAE, and in ¶ 3.c that his nephew
is a resident of UAE.
Applicant’s father was born in Iraq, and in 2016, he passed away. (Tr. 45; GE 1;
GE 2 at 14) Applicant’s mother is 70 years old, and she was born in Iraq. (Tr. 46-47; GE
1)  She  is  a  U.S.  citizen,  and  she  resides  in  the  United  States.  (GE  1)  She  is  disabled.
(Tr. 46-47; GE 3 at 6) Applicant’s mother is aware that Applicant is seeking employment
as a linguist and is seeking a security clearance. (GE 3 at 6) If he is hired as a linguist
and  deployed  to  Iraq,  he  plans  for  his  mother  to  live  with  his  sister-in-law  in  UAE  or  in
Iraq with another relative. (Tr. 48, 49, 108) He will have frequent contact with his mother,
and  he  will  provide  financial  support for  her while  she  is  in  UAE.  (Tr.  48-49)  The  SOR
does  not  allege  a  security  concern  relating  to  Applicant’s  mother.  Consideration  of
Applicant’s relationship with his mother, and his mother’s relationships with other family
members  is  limited  to  mitigation  and  whole-person  purposes.  His  family  in  UAE  is  not
aware that he has applied to become a linguist. (Tr. 52)
Applicant’s  sister is 55  years old;  she  was  born  in Iraq  and  has  lived  in  UAE for
about 20 years; she is an engineering teacher; and Applicant had monthly contact with
her before May 2018; and after May 2018, he did not have direct contact with her.  (Tr.
55-56, 84, 85; GE 2 at 14, 16) His sister’s spouse is 56 years old; he lives in UAE; he is
an Iraqi citizen; and he is an engineer. (Tr. 57-58; GE 3 at 9-10) They have four children.
(Tr. 58) Their 29-year-old son also lives in UAE, and is an engineer. (Tr. 59; GE 3 at 9-
10) Applicant did not know whether his nephew held UAE government employment. (Tr.
60) They hold Iraqi passports. (GE 3 at 9) Applicant did not want his mother to sponsor
them for U.S. residence because of their radical, anti-United States statements. (GE 3 at
9)  In  2017,  Applicant  was  watching  the  news  with  them  in  UAE,  and  a  hurricane  was
approaching  Florida.  (Tr. 75-77;  GE 3  at 9) They  started  saying  prayers asking  God  to
drown  the  infidels  of  America.  (Tr.  75-77;  GE  3  at  9)  When  they  remembered  that
Applicant  was  American,  they  stopped  their  anti-American  statements.  Applicant’s
brother-in-law  had  radical  anti-American  views  and  made  several  anti-American
statements  over  the  past  twenty  years.  (GE  3  at  10)  His  brother-in-law  and  nephew
attend a radical mosque in UAE. (Tr. 79, 84; GE 3 at 9-10) Applicant did not attend the
mosque  himself.  (Tr.  79)  Applicant  was  very  unhappy  about  their  anti-American
comments.  (Tr.  77)  Applicant  strenuously  objected  to  any  aspersions  cast  against  his
loyalty to the United States. (Tr. 17-19, 77-78, 111)
Applicant’s brother-in-law cried when Saddam Hussein was executed in 2006 by
Iraqi authorities, and his brother-in-law was aligned with the Baath Party before leaving
Iraq. (Tr. 82; GE 3 at 10) He hates the current government of Iraq. (Tr. 83) His brother-in-
law  made  numerous  statements  supporting  the  downfall  of  the  United  States.  (Tr.  82)
Applicant’s  sister has  changed  and  become  sympathetic  towards  her  husband’s  views.
(Tr. 80; GE 3 at 10) His sister and her spouse do not wish to return to Iraq. (GE 3 at 10)
Applicant reported the information about his sister and her spouse out of loyalty for the
United States. (GE 3 at 9-10) Applicant emphasized that he loves his sister. (Tr. 77, 80,
82, 111)
Applicant  said  he  ended  his  direct  contacts  with  his  sister  in  UAE  in  May  2018.
(Tr.  85-86)  Applicant’s  mother  contacts  his  sister  in  UAE  about  once  a  week.  (Tr.  86)
Applicant  has  indirect  contact  with  his  sister  in  UAE  through  his  mother.  (Tr.  85)  His
mother uses WhatsApp and Viper, which are computer applications that enable users to
communicate  with  individuals  and  groups  of  people,  including  sending  pictures  and
videos at the same time. (Tr. 85, 109; GE 3 at 5)
Iraq
The Federal Republic of Iraq (Iraq) is a constitutional parliamentary republic. The
outcome  of  the  2014  parliamentary  elections  generally  met  international  standards  of
free  and  fair  elections  and  led  to  the  peaceful  transition  of  power  from  former  prime
minister Nuri al-Maliki to Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi.
The U.S. Department of State travel advisory for Iraq is Level 4: “Do not travel to
Iraq  due  to  terrorism  and  armed  conflict.”  U.S.  citizens  in  Iraq  are  at  high  risk  for
violence and kidnapping. Numerous terrorist and insurgent groups are active in Iraq and
regularly attack both Iraqi security forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias may
also  threaten  U.S.  citizens  and  Western  companies  throughout  Iraq.  Attacks  by
improvised  explosive  devices  (IEDs)  occur  frequently  in  many  areas  of  the  country,
including  Baghdad.  The  U.S.  Government’s  ability  to  provide  routine  and  emergency
services to U.S. citizens in Iraq is extremely limited.
U.S.  citizens  in  Iraq  remain  at  critical  risk  for  kidnapping  and  terrorist  violence.
The  Islamic  State  in  Iraq  and  Syria  (ISIS)  is  a  designated  terrorist  organization
conducting  an  active  insurgency  in  Syria,  with  franchises  or  direct  links  to  terrorist
groups in Iraq and other parts of the world. It commits terrorist attacks, violent atrocities,
and  targets  U.S.  citizens.  ISIS  controls  some  areas  of  Syria  on  the  Iraqi  border.  The
Iraqi  government  declared  all  of  its  territory  liberated  from  ISIS  in  December  2017;
however,  despite  proved  government  control,  ISIS  remains  a  threat  to  public  safety  in
Iraq  through  the  indiscriminate  use  of  terrorist  and  asymmetrical  attacks.  Additionally,
criminal gangs and local militias pose a potential threat to U.S. citizens.
The  Department  of  State  has  assessed  Baghdad  as  being  a  critical-threat
location  for  terrorist  activity  directed  at  or  affecting  official  U.S.  Government  interests.
Since August 2014, ISIS has been responsible for the majority of terrorist incidents and
attacks  in  Iraq.  Although  the  Iraqi government  declared  victory  over ISIS  in  December
2017, it anticipates that remaining ISIS fighters will go underground and form insurgent
cells throughout Iraq. These cells are expected to conduct high profile attacks on Iraqi
Security  Forces  personnel,  Iraqi  government  installations,  and  other  soft  targets  in
major  Iraqi  population  centers  Anti-American/anti-western  sentiment  exists  throughout
Iraq.  The  threat  of  kidnapping,  rocket  attack,  or  the  use  of  lEDs  and  small-arms  fire
against official and private U.S. interests remains high and is subject to the influence of
domestic,  regional,  and  international  developments.  Iranian-backed  Shia  militias,  such
as  Asa’ib  Ahl  al-Haq,  Kata’ib  Hizballah,  and  Muqtada  al  Sadr’s  nationalistic  Peace
Brigades  Militia  have  targeted  U.S.  interests.  There  are  reports  of  Shia  militia  groups
kidnapping  locals,  foreign  workers,  and  members  of  international  organizations  and
demanding  ransoms  from  either  their  families  or  their  employers.  A  number  of  these
groups are hostile to U.S. interests and pose a considerable potential threat, as either
organized groups or individually as “rogue” elements that may take independent action.
The  U.S.  Government  considers  the  potential  personal  security  threats  to  U.S.
Government  personnel  in  Iraq  to  be  serious  enough  to  require  them  to  live  and  work
under  strict  security  guidelines.  In  December  2017,  the  U.S.  Embassy  in  Baghdad
expanded  its  temporary  movement  restriction  to  include  movements  both  inside  and
outside the international zone in response to the recent announcement that the United
States recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
In its 2017 Country Reports on Terrorism, the U.S. Department of State reported
that  by  the  end  of  2017,  Iraqi Security  Forces,  with  the  support of  the  U.S.-led  Global
Coalition to Defeat ISIS, had reclaimed all of the territory that ISIS had captured in 2014
and  2015.  As  ISIS  retreated  from  Mosul  and  other  cities,  its  fighters  used  IEDs,
homemade  mines,  and  mortars  to  booby  trap  homes,  public  spaces,  and  critical
infrastructure  to  impede  the  movement  of  Iraq’s  security  forces  and  terrorize  returning
residents. ISIS maintained the capability to conduct terrorist attacks. Kata’ib Hizballah, a
designated  foreign  terrorist  organization,  continued  to  operate  in  Iraq  during  2017,
exacerbating sectarian tensions.
According  to  the  United  Nations,  acts  of  terrorism,  violence,  and  armed  conflict
with  ISIS  killed more  than  3,000  civilians  and  injured more than  4,600  in  Iraq  in  2017.
ISIS’  continued  ability  to  use  captured  and  improved  military  equipment  allowed  it  to
employ  sophisticated  methods  including  the  use  of  armored  vehicle-borne  IEDs  and
chlorine  gas.  ISIS  continued  to  commit  atrocities  involving  the  use  of  child  soldiers,
mass murder, enslavement of ethnic and religious minorities, rape, forced marriage, and
executing  civilians,  including  women  and  children,  attempting  to  flee  its  rule.  ISIS
continued to carry out suicide and hit-and-run attacks throughout the country, the most
significant occurring on September 14, 2017, during a coordinated attack on a security
checkpoint and restaurant on the outskirts of Nasariyah that killed more than 80 Iraqis.
On  January  13,  2018,  a  suicide  vest  attack  was  conducted  against  an  Iraqi  Security
Forces  checkpoint  in  Baghdad,  resulting  in  over  12  casualties.  Two  days  later,  twin
suicide  vest  attacks  killed  over  36  civilians  in  central  Baghdad.  The  attacks  targeted
Iraqi day laborers as they gathered in search of work. ISIS claimed responsibility for the
attacks in the following days.
In  February  2018,  the  U.S.  Director  of  National  Intelligence  (DNI),  in  his
Statement  for  the  Record,  Worldwide  Threat  Assessment  of  the  U.S.  Intelligence
Community, provided the following assessment of the situation in Iraq:
international  attacks,  and  encouraging
Over the next year, we expect that ISIS is likely to focus on regrouping in
Iraq  and  Syria,  enhancing  its  global  presence,  championing  its  cause,
planning
its  members  and
sympathizers to attack in their home countries . . . ISIS core has started-
and probably will maintain-a robust insurgency in Iraq and Syria as part of
a long-term strategy to ultimately enable the reemergence of its so-called
caliphate.  This  activity  will  challenge  local  [counter-terrorism]  efforts
against the group and threaten US interests in the region.
Iran’s  support  for  the  Popular  Mobilization  Committee  (PMC)  and  Shia
militants  remains  the  primary  threat  to  US  personnel  in  Iraq.  We  assess
that  this  threat  will  increase  as  the  threat  from  ISIS  recedes,  especially
given  calls  from  some  Iranian  backed  groups  for  the  United  States  to
withdraw  [from  Iraq]  and  growing  tension  between  Iran  and  the  United
States.
Iraq  is  likely  to  face  a  lengthy  period  of  political  turmoil  and  conflict  as  it
struggles to rebuild, reconstitute the Iraqi state, maintain pressure on ISIS,
and rein in the Iranian-backed Shia militias that pose an enduring threat to
US personnel . . . ISIS will remain a terrorist and insurgent threat, and the
group  will  seek  to  exploit  Sunni  discontent  to  conduct  attacks  and  try  to
regain  Iraqi  territory  .  .  .  There  is  an  increasing  risk  that  some  Shi  a
militants  will  seek  to  attack  US  targets  in  Iraq  .  .  .  Despite  ISIS’  loss  of
territory,  the  social  and  political  challenges  that  gave  rise  to  the  group
remain and threaten the cohesion of the Iraqi state.
In  December 2015,  President  Obama  signed  into  law  the  Visa Waiver Program
Improvement and Terrorist  Travel Protection  Act  of  2015,  which  amended  the existing
Visa  Waiver  Program.  Under  the  2015  amendment,  citizens  of  lran,  Iraq,  Sudan,  and
Syria are ineligible to travel or be admitted to the United States under the Visa Waiver
the
Program.  The  exclusion  of

significant presence in the country; or that the county is a safe haven for terrorists.

In  its  2017  Human  Rights  Report,  the  U.S.  Department  of  State  reported  that
violence  continued  in  Iraq  throughout  2017,  largely fueled  by  the  actions  of  ISIS.  Iraqi
government  forces  successfully  fought  to  liberate  territory  taken  earlier  by  ISIS,
including Mosul, while ISIS sought to demonstrate its viability through targeted attacks.
Armed  clashes  between  ISIS  and  government  forces  caused  civilian  deaths  and
hardship. By the end of 2017, Iraqi Security Forces had liberated all territory from ISIS,
drastically reducing ISIS’s ability to commit abuses and atrocities.
During 2017, Iraq ‘s most significant human rights issues included allegations of
unlawful  killings  by  some  members  of  the  Iraqi  Security  Forces,  particularly  some
elements  of  the  Popular  Mobilization  Forces  (PMF);  disappearance  and  extortion  by
PMF  elements;  torture;  harsh  and  life-threatening  conditions  in  detention  and  prison
interference  with  privacy;
facilities;  arbitrary  arrest  and  detention;  arbitrary
criminalization  of  libel  and  other  limits  on  freedom  of  expression,  including  press
freedoms;  violence  against  journalists;  widespread  official  corruption;  greatly  reduced
penalties for so-called “honor killings”; coerced or forced abortions imposed by ISIS on
its  victims;  legal  restrictions  on  freedom  of  movement  of  women;  and  trafficking  in
persons.  Militant  groups  killed  LGBTI  persons.  There  were  also  limitations  on  worker
rights, including restrictions on formation of independent unions.
ISIS committed the majority of serious abuses and atrocities occurring in Iraq in
2017.  ISIS  members  committed  acts  of  violence  on  a  mass  scale,  including  killings
through  suicide  bombings  and  IEDs;  executions  including  shootings  and  public
beheadings;  use  of  civilians  as  human  shields;  as  well  as  use  of  chemical  weapons.
They  also  engaged  in  kidnapping,  rape,  enslavement,  forced  marriage,  and  sexual
violence,  committing  such  acts  against  civilians  from  a  wide  variety  of  religious  and
ethnic backgrounds, including Shia, Sunnis, Kurds, Christians, Yezidis, and members of
other religious and ethnic groups. Reports of ISIS perpetrating gender-based violence,
recruiting child soldiers, trafficking in persons, and destroying civilian infrastructure and
cultural  heritage  sites  were  credible  and  common.  On  August  15,  2017,  then-U.S.
Secretary of State Tillerson stated that, “ISIS is clearly responsible for genocide against
Yezidis, Christians, and Shia Muslims in areas it controls or has controlled. ISIS is also
responsible  for  crimes  against  humanity  and  ethnic  cleansing  directed  at  these  same
groups, and in some cases against Sunni Muslims, Kurds, and other minorities.”
United Arab Emirates (UAE)
The UAE is a federation of monarchies consisting of seven emirates - Abu Zaby
(Abu  Dhabi),  ‘Ajman,  Al  Fujayrah,  Ash  Shariqah  (Sharjah),  Dubayy  (Dubai),  Ra’s  al
Khaymah,  and  Umm  al  Qaywayn.  The  rulers  of  the  seven  emirates  constitute  the
Federal  Supreme  Council,  the  country’s  highest  legislative  and  executive  body.  The
emirates  are  under  patriarchal  rule  with  political  allegiance  defined  by  loyalty  to  tribal
leaders, leaders of the individual emirates, and leaders of the federation.
In its 2017 Country Reports on Terrorism, the U.S. Department of State reported
that during  2017,  the UAE  remained  a  regional and  global financial  and  transportation
hub,  and  terrorist  organizations  exploited  it  to  send  and  receive  financial  support.
Operational capability constraints and political considerations sometimes prevented the
UAE  government  from  immediately  freezing  and  confiscating  terrorist  assets,  absent
multilateral assistance. The  UAE  is a drug  transshipment  point for traffickers,  given  its
proximity  to  Southwest  Asian  drug-producing  countries,  and  its  position  as  a  major
financial  center  makes  it  vulnerable  to  money  laundering.  Anti-money  laundering
controls are improving, but informal banking remains unregulated.
Except for free trade zones specifically established for financial activities,  which
are well regulated, the UAE’s numerous free trade zones vary in their compliance with
and  supervision  of  anti-money  laundering  and  countering  the  financing  of  terrorism
international best practices. Exploitation by illicit actors of money transmitters, including
licensed  exchange  houses,  hawalas,  and  trading  firms  acting  as  money  transmitters,
remains a significant concern.
As  the  following  examples  demonstrate,  through  transshipment  and  diversion,
U.S. goods, dual use, military and electronic components, and internet technology have
passed  through  the  UAE  and  UAE-owned  businesses  on  their  way  to  Iran  and  Syria:
Between 2005 and 2007, U.S. companies were misled into shipping aircraft parts to the
UAE that were actually destined for customers in Iran. Between 2007 and 2008, at least
seven shipments of vacuum pumps and equipment related to uranium enrichment were
shipped to Iran through a free trade zone located in the UAE, in a manner that made it
appear  that  the  UAE  was  the  ultimate  destination.  In  2008,  U.S.  dual-use  and  military
components  were  funneled  through  the  UAE  to  Iran  and  were  used  in  improvised
explosive devices (IEDs) employed against coalition forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. In
2009, a U.S. company conspired to export a steel bar peeling machine to Iran, through
the UAE, in violation of the Iran embargo. In 2014, a UAE company violated its reseller
agreement  with  a  U.S.  software  company  and  illegally  diverted  internet  monitoring
technology  to  Syria.  In  2016,  high-tech  electronic  components  from  U.S.  companies
were illegally transshipped through the UAE on their way to Iran.
The  U.S.  Department  of  State  has  assessed  Abu  Dhabi  and  Dubai  as  being
medium-threat  locations  for  terrorist  activity  directed  at  or  affecting  official  U.S.
Government  interests.  The  Department  of  State  remains  concerned  about  the  global
threat  of  terrorism,  including  the  continuing  possibility  of  terrorist  attacks  against  U.S.
citizens  and  interests  in  the  Arabian  Gulf  and  Arabian  Peninsula.  Elevated  security
10
threats  have  the  potential  to  affect  security  in  the  UAE,  particularly  as  the  UAE
continues  taking  on  a  more  prominent  role  countering  extremism  in  the  region.  The
UAE’s participation in the anti ISIS coalition and the ongoing Yemen civil war has raised
the overall likelihood of terrorist attacks against Western interests.
The  UAE  is  a  member  of  a  Saudi-led  coalition  that  was  formed  to  counter  the
2014 overthrow of the legitimate government of Yemen by militias known colloquially as
“Houthis,”  and  forces  loyal  to  the  former  Yemeni  president  Ali  Abdullah  Saleh.  During
2018,  UAE  forces  continued  an  active  military  role  in  Yemen,  including  conducting
ground  operations  against  al-Qaida  in  the  Arabian  Peninsula  and  the  Islamic  State  in
southern Yemen. Iran’s support to the Houthis in Yemen has escalated the conflict and
poses a serious threat to U.S. partners and interests in the region. Such efforts include
an attempted December 3, 2017, cruise missile attack on an unfinished nuclear reactor
in Abu Dhabi.
On September 21, 2019, the Secretary of Defense announced that the President
had approved defensive deployment of some DOD forces to UAE and increased military
sales  in  response  to  the  September  2019  drone-missile  attack  on  Saudi  Arabian  oil
fields.  “U.S.  to  deploy  military  forces  to  Saudi  Arabia,  UAE  after  drone  attacks  on  oil
sites,”  NBC  News  website  (Sept.  21,  2019),  https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-
news/u-s-deploy-military-forces-saudi-arabia-after-drone-attacks-n1057216.
In  its  2017  Human  Rights  Report,  the  U.S.  Department  of  State  reported  that
civilian authorities in the UAE maintained effective control over the security forces. The
most  significant  human  rights  issues  included  allegations  of  torture  in  detention;
incommunicado  detention;  government
arbitrary  arrest  and  detention,
interference  with  privacy  rights,  including  criminalization  of  libel  and  arrests  and
detentions
internet  postings  or  commentary;  restrictions  on  assembly  and
association;  and  the  inability  of  citizens  to  choose  their  government  in  free  and  fair
elections.  Some  press  reports  and  human  rights  organizations  alleged  that  UAE  and
DAE-supported  local  Yemeni  forces  abducted,  arbitrarily  detained,  and  tortured
individuals as part of counterterrorism efforts in Southern Yemen.

"Applicant  admitted  to  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a.~1.d.,  and  1.f.  He  denied
SOR allegation ¶ 1.e. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and
testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  43-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed with the defense contractor since 2007. (TR at page 17 line 5 to page 23 line
24, and at page 27 line 3 to page 28 line 22.) Appellant served in the U.S. Army for five
years, achieving the rank of Staff Sergeant, and was deployed to Iraq. (TR at page 24
line 1 to page 27 line 2.) He has held a security clearance since 2002, since joining the
Army  after  “9/11.”  (Id.)  He  is  married  to  a  naturalized  American  citizen,  and  has  three
native-born American children. (TR at page 19 lines 16~20.)
Guideline B - Foreign Influence
1.a.  and  1.b.  Applicant’s  mother-in-law  and  father-in-law  are  citizens  of  China,
but reside in a retirement home in the United States. (TR at page 29 line 20 to page 31
line 11, and at page 34 line 25 to page 35 line 11.) They have “Green Card[s],” and are
seeking to become U.S. citizens. (Id.) All they know about Applicant’s work is that he is
“an  Engineer.”  (TR  at  page  30  line  21  to  page  31  line  1.)  They  never  worked  for  the
Chinese government, nor were members of the Chinese Communist Party. (TR at page
31 lines 2~8.)
1.c.  Applicant’s  brother-in-law  is  a  citizen  and  resident  of  China.  He  is  an
“Engineer,” working for a “power company.” (TR at page 31 line 12 to page 32 line 6.)
Applicant has little contact with his brother-in-law, perhaps “once a year . . . during the
holidays.” (Id.)
1.d.  Applicant’s  70-year-old  aunt  is  a  citizen  and  resident  of  China.  He  last
contacted her about “15/20 years ago.” (TR at page 32 lines 7~18.)
1.e. Applicant is unsure if he has a bank account in China. He visited China in
2000, and deposited about $3,500 in a bank account to cover his travel expenses. (TR
at  page  32  line  23  to  page  33  line  19.)  His  net  worth  in  the  United  States  is  about
$2,500,000. (TR at page 21 line 24 to page 23 line 19, and at page 35 line 12 to page
36 line 6.)
1.f.  Applicant’s  wife  once  had  a  company  that  partnered  with  a  Chinese
company. That partnership ceased in 2012, about seven years ago. (TR at page 33 line
20 to page 34 line 19, and at 36 lines 8~10.)
Notice
Department  Counsel  has  asked  me  to  take  administrative  notice  about  facts
regarding  China.  China  poses  a  great  espionage  and  cyber-attack  treat  to  the  United
States.  It  is  an  authoritarian  state,  in  which  the  Communist  Party  is  the  paramount
authority.

"Applicant is a 34-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his  current  employer  since  2013.  He  was  born  in  Afghanistan  to  Afghan  parents.  His
family fled to Pakistan in 1984 to avoid the war. They returned to Afghanistan in about
2004.  He  was  granted  asylum  in  the  United  States  in  2010  because  of  threats  made
against his family. He became a U.S. citizen in 2016.1
Applicant’s  father  is  deceased.  His  mother  is  a  citizen  of  Afghanistan,  currently
residing  in  the  United  States  with  Applicant.  He  used  to  send  her  money  through  a
friend  in  Afghanistan,  but  he  stopped  in  about  2017.  He  has  ten  brothers  and  sisters.
Eight of his siblings live in European countries. He has a brother and a sister who are
citizens and residents of Afghanistan. His sister is a widow who does not work outside
the home. His brother is in school. Applicant also still has a few friends in Afghanistan.
None  of  his  family  in  Afghanistan  have  any  direct  connection  to  the  Afghanistan
government or any terrorist organization.2
Applicant’s fiancée is a U.S. citizen originally from Afghanistan. She is pregnant
with their first child. He does not own any assets in Afghanistan. He and a partner invest
together in flipping houses in the United States.3

"The SOR alleges under Guideline B that Applicant’s mother is a citizen of Lebanon
(SOR ¶ 1.a); that his sister is a dual citizen of the United States and Lebanon currently
residing in Lebanon and working for a Lebanese company (SOR ¶ 1.b); that another sister
is a resident citizen of Lebanon employed by an international organization (SOR ¶ 1.c);
that a friend is a resident citizen of Lebanon (SOR ¶ 1.d); and that a friend is a dual citizen
of Lebanon and Mexico residing in Lebanon (SOR ¶ 1.e). Additionally, the SOR alleges
that Applicant owns an apartment valued at $80,000 (SOR ¶ 1.g) in Lebanon, and that he
co-owns two apartments valued at $95,000 and $50,000 (SOR ¶¶ 1.f and 1.j), an office

officer and his supervisors attest to his responsibility, reliability, trustworthiness, and his
loyalty to the United States. (Answer.)
After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact:
Applicant  is  a  24-year-old  systems  engineer,  who  has  worked  for  his  current
employer,  a  defense  contractor,  since  June  2017.  He  is  seeking  to  obtain  a  security
clearance for his duties. (GE 1; Tr. 33, 38.)
Applicant  was  born  to  Lebanese  citizens  in  the  United  States.  He  acquired
derivative Lebanese citizenship from his  father. (GEs 1-2.) He denies that he currently
holds Lebanese citizenship (Tr. 37-38), although there is no evidence that he has taken
steps to formally renounce his Lebanese citizenship. (GE 2.) Applicant held a Lebanese
passport, renewed in October 2013 for another five years, which he surrendered to his
employer with a request that it be destroyed. He signed a disposition certificate. (GE 1;
AE C.)
Applicant has two sisters, ages 28 (sister #1) and 27 (sister #2). Shortly after sister
#1 was born in Lebanon, Applicant’s parents came to the United States with the intention
of  joining  his father’s  relatives  in  their  business.  (Tr.  73.)  After  sister  #2  and  Applicant
were born in the United States, Applicant’s parents moved the family back to Lebanon for
a job opportunity for Applicant’s father. Lebanese Christians, they resided in a Christian-
dominated area of Lebanon. Applicant attended high school in Lebanon from September
2009 to June 2012. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 55.)
Applicant  planned  to  attend  college  in  the  United  States,  but  his  father  was
diagnosed with terminal cancer. (Tr. 41.) His father, who worked in real estate in Lebanon,
died  in  September  2012.  (GE  1;  Tr.  68.)  In  January  2013,  Applicant  enrolled  in  an
“American  systems  school”  in  Lebanon  in  January  2013.  Applicant  accelerated  his
coursework and earned his bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering in Lebanon in
December 2015. (AE H; Tr. 41.) In January 2016, Applicant, his mother, and sister #2
came  to  the  United  States.  Sister  #1,  who  was  already  employed  in  Lebanon  by  an
international humanitarian organization, came for a one-month vacation. (GE 1; Tr. 41-
43.) Applicant held both U.S. and Lebanese passports at that time. (GE 2.)
Applicant  pursued  his  master’s  degree  in  aerospace  engineering  in  the  United
States from January 2016 to May 2017. Sister #2 enrolled in college here, and at their
mother’s urging, sister #1 took a leave of absence from her employer  and came to the
United States for studies in her chosen field. (GE 1; Tr. 43-44.) Sister #1 had a degree
from a university in Lebanon. (Tr. 73-74.)
In February 2017, Applicant was offered a job with his current employer. (GE 2;
AE  C.)  On  March  12,  2017,  Applicant  completed  and  certified  to  the  accuracy  of  a
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). He disclosed that he was a dual
citizen of the United States and Lebanon, but he had surrendered his Lebanese passport
to  the  defense  contractor  and  requested  its  destruction.  He  had  taken  no  action  to
renounce his Lebanese citizenship. Among his foreign travel, he listed a trip to Lebanon
from May 2016 to August 2016. Applicant disclosed that sister #2 was a dual citizen of
the United States and Lebanon (SOR ¶ 1.b); that his mother and sister #1 were Lebanese
citizens (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c); and that his mother and sisters were residing with him in the
United States. Sister #1 and their mother had immigration petitions pending in the United
States since September 2016 and December 2016 under his sponsorship. Applicant also
disclosed that he had close and continuing contact with two foreign nationals within the
last seven years. He had occasional telephone contact to as recently as December 2016
with  a  Lebanese  resident  citizen  (SOR  ¶  1.d)  and  with  a  dual  citizen  of  Lebanon  and
Mexico residing in Lebanon (SOR ¶ 1.e). Concerning foreign financial interests, Applicant
listed his co-ownership with his mother and siblings of assets in Lebanon inherited on his
father’s death consisting of two apartments and an office valued at $95,000 (SOR ¶ 1.f),
$50,000  (SOR  ¶  1.j),  and  $17,000  (SOR  ¶  1.k),  and  two  bank  accounts  worth
approximately $83,000 (SOR ¶ 1.h) and $65,000 (SOR ¶ 1.i). Applicant was sole owner
of another apartment in Lebanon valued at $80,000 (SOR ¶ 1.g), which “was written to
[him] by [his] father when [he] was still a minor and prior to him passing away.” (GE 1.)
Applicant earned his master’s degree in May 2017 with a 4.0 grade point average
on a 4.0 scale. (AEs H, K.) He started working for his employer in June 2017. (GE 2.) On
December 4, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the Office
of  Personnel  Management  (OPM).  Applicant  indicated  that  he  initially  acquired  his
Lebanese passport through his parents, and that it had been destroyed by his employer’s
security office. He expressed that he had no intention of renewing it. He confirmed that
he holds dual citizenship with Lebanon and the United States, but he has no obligations
to Lebanon and did not maintain his foreign citizenship to protect any foreign interest. He
indicated  that  he  would  be  willing  to  renounce  his  Lebanese  citizenship  if  required.
Applicant indicated that his mother had acquired U.S. permanent residency, but also that
his mother and sisters had returned to Lebanon. About the two Lebanese citizens listed
as foreign contacts on his SF 86, Applicant stated that they did not have any affiliation
with a foreign government. He had no update to the information previously provided about
his assets in Lebanon. Applicant explained that he considered the financial assets to be
his parent’s property, and he added that he was in the process of trying to move money
from  Lebanon  to  the  United  States.  He  denied  any  intention  of  returning  to  Lebanon
permanently. (GE 2.)
Applicant obtained a U.S. passport in May 2012 with a scheduled expiration date
in May 2022. In January 2017, he had to obtain a new U.S. passport because he changed
his  name.  (GEs  1-2.)  On  January  12,  2018,  Applicant  was  re-interviewed  to  obtain
information about his passports and foreign travel. Applicant used his Lebanese passport
to travel to Turkey in 2014 and to Lebanon because he felt it was safer using it rather than
his U.S. passport, although he used his U.S. passport when entering the United States.
Applicant related that his allegiance is to the United States over other nations and that no
foreign associates know that he is under consideration for a security clearance. (GE 2.)
Applicant  traveled  to  Lebanon  in  August  2018  on  his  U.S.  passport  to  visit  his
mother and sisters and to divest himself of his inherited assets in Lebanon. On August
26, 2018, he irrevocably waived his interest in the assets inherited from the estate of his
father and his right to inherit from his mother on her death. On August 30, 2018, he gave
a general power of attorney to his mother to represent him in any legal matter in Lebanon,
including matters of real estate and banking, and to divest him of his ownership interests.
(AE A; Tr. 33-34, 54.) Applicant attested that his mother took action to have him removed
from all those foreign assets, but then stated, “I do hope that my mom actually completed
the documents.” (Tr. 58-59.) If he discovers that she has not done so, he plans to ask her
to take him off the bank accounts. (Tr. 59.)
Applicant’s mother has never worked outside the home. (GE 1; Tr. 62.) She lives
off the assets she inherited on her spouse’s death. (Tr. 56.) She does not rent out the
properties and is waiting for the economy to improve in Lebanon before selling them. (Tr.
67.)  Applicant  has  a  close  relationship  with  his  mother.  They  converse  by  telephone
frequently including as recently as the morning of Applicant’s security clearance hearing.
As of February 2019, Applicant’s mother and sister #2 were living together in Lebanon.
(Tr.  63.)  Applicant  testified  that  his  mother  intends  to  obtain  U.S.  citizenship  and  live
permanently in the United States, but that she plans to stay in Lebanon “at least [until]
one of [his sisters] actually comes back.” He testified that his mother does not want to
leave both of his sisters alone in Lebanon, and that there is no date set for his sisters’
employments  to  end  in  Lebanon.  (Tr.  50-51.)  Applicant  understands  that  there  are
security issues in Lebanon. In the event of any attempt to pressure him, such as through
his mother were she to be kidnapped, Applicant responded that his first reaction would
be to inform his security officer at work and seek guidance. (Tr. 61.)
According to Applicant, sister #1’s initial request for U.S. permanent residency has
been approved. (Tr. 46.) As an employee of an international humanitarian organization
since 2010 or 2011, sister # 1 has been posted in Lebanon, but she had traveled to other
countries for her work involving refugees. She is always escorted by security staff when
she leaves her work premises. (Tr. 34, 37, 46-47.) Applicant has occasional contact with
his sister #1, approximately once a month to once every two months by telephone. Sister
# 1 is married, and her spouse works in real estate. (Tr. 48-49.) Sister #1 and her spouse
live  above  Applicant’s  mother and  sister  #2  in  the  same  building  in  Lebanon.  (Tr. 63.)
Applicant was not asked about, and he provided no details, about his sister’s marriage,
to include when it occurred or how it affects her plan to immigrate to the United States.
Sister  #2  graduated  from  college  in  the  United  States.  (Tr.  35.)  She  is  a  civil
engineer and works for a U.S. company. She is presently assigned to duties in Lebanon
because she speaks Arabic. Sister #2 is considering applying for work with Applicant’s
employer in the United States. (Tr. 35-36.)
Applicant testified that when he completed his SF 86, he realized that his foreign
contacts could be a security concern, and he resolved to have no further contact with the
friends (SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e). (Tr. 52-53.) Applicant has friendly relations with his father’s
cousins who live nearby in the United States. They are like uncles to him. He visits them
occasionally and celebrates holidays with them. They have lived in the United States for
several decades and own several businesses, including a restaurant and nightclub. (Tr.
60, 69-71.) One of his relatives served on a city council in his community in the United
States. (Tr. 72.) Applicant has paternal aunts and uncles in Lebanon with whom he, his
mother, and his sisters are not on good terms. (Tr. 68.)
Applicant’s current annual salary with his defense-contractor employer is $80,000.
(AE  M;  Tr.  61.)  He  has  approximately  $29,786  in  banking  deposits  and  $7,720  in  a
retirement account in the United States. (AEs I-J.) He attends church services weekly and
contributes financially to his parish. (AE L; Tr. 60.) He belongs to a sports club, where he
plays soccer in a registered league with some co-workers. (AE O; Tr. 60.) He is also a
member of two professional organizations in his career field. (AE O.)
Work and Character References
Applicant, who has no had access to classified information, is tasked with ensuring
compliance with International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). (Tr. 39.) He has earned
several awards at work for his accountability, and his collaboration on projects. (AE G.) A
mechanical  engineering  manager,  who  has  held  a  Secret  clearance  since  April  2006,
manages all of Applicant’s work assignments, reviews a large amount of his work product,
and  mentors  him.  This  manager  is  aware  of  the  SOR  and  has  discussed  the  security
concerns with Applicant. He described Applicant as “a model of honesty and integrity.”
Applicant has always been attentive to detail, completely trustworthy and accurate in his
handling  of  controlled  technology,  and  transparent  with  information  relative  to  his
application for a clearance. This manager has not observed anything about Applicant’s
behavior to question his allegiance to the United States or his ability to protect classified
information. He believes Applicant is “first and foremost an American” and dedicated to
the warfighter. (AE F.)
A systems engineer who works on another project met Applicant when they were
in graduate school together. They worked together daily on classwork. In his experience,
Applicant was a “smart and effective college student” disciplined in his studies. Applicant
exhibits  respect  for  rules  in  all  environments,  and  he  has  protected  their  employer’s
proprietary and intellectual property. In his opinion, Applicant takes his U.S. citizenship
seriously. He has observed Applicant to honor U.S. war dead on Memorial Day and to
celebrate the U.S.’ Independence Day “in a truly American way.” Applicant has expressed
to  him  a  desire  to  help  the  United  States  further  its  technology  and  promote  scientific
achievements. (AE E.)
A principal systems engineer, who has worked for the defense contractor for some
35 years and has held a Secret clearance for 30 years, also recommends Applicant for a
DOD clearance. Applicant supports a program on which this engineer is the program lead
by  performing  hardware  systems  assessments  and  classifications.  This  engineer  has
reviewed  the  SOR.  He  has  experienced  Applicant  as  someone  who  has  always  been
reliable, responsible, and trustworthy. Applicant “shows up earlier than asked, works hard,
and carries himself in a polite, respectful manner.” (AE B.)
A senior security specialist at Applicant’s worksite has held Secret or Top Secret
security clearances since 1987. She attests that Applicant approached her with a request
to  have  his  Lebanese  passport  destroyed,  and  he  signed  a  disposition  certificate.
Applicant has been proactive in completing all security requirements ahead of schedule.
He has not given this security officer any reason to question his allegiance to the United
States or to believe that he has divided loyalties. Based on their professional interactions,
she  is  of  the  opinion  that  Applicant  will  not  be  manipulated,  coerced,  or  induced  into
helping a foreign power. (AE C.)
A cousin of Applicant’s father has worked in the United States since earning his
master’s degree in 1987. Employed as a senior program manager for a medical device
company  for  the  past  18  years,  this  relative  has  had  the  opportunity  to  interact  with
Applicant in the last three years. He was impressed by Applicant’s dedication in his desire
to earn highest grades in his master’s degree studies. Applicant has shown himself to be
very  honest  and  dependable,  passionate  about  his  work,  and  extremely  motivated  to
succeed in his job. He has no doubt that Applicant would put  the interest of the United
States ahead of any other country. (AE D.)
Administrative Notice
Lebanon is a parliamentary republic that, from gaining its independence in 1943,
apportions government authority among a Maronite Christian president, a Shia speaker
of  its  parliament,  and  a  Sunni  prime  minister.  After  more  than  two  years  of  political
deadlock, Lebanon’s parliament elected President Michel Aoun. Parliamentary elections
held  in  May  2018  were  peaceful  and  generally  considered  fair  and  free  from  regional
influence. As of the end of 2018, the process of forming a government under the direction
of  Prime  Minister  designate  Saad  Hariri  was  underway.  Neighboring  Syria  has  long
influenced  Lebanon’s  foreign  policy  and  internal  policies.  Hizballah’s  political  power  in
Lebanon makes consensus on any anti-Hizballah legislation impossible.
The United States seeks to maintain its traditionally close ties with Lebanon, and
to  help  preserve  its  independence,  sovereignty,  national  unity,  and  territorial  integrity.
Since  2006,  the  United  States  has  provided  more  than  $2  billion  in  bilateral  foreign
assistance to Lebanon to support strengthening state institutions and security agencies
after  years  of  Syrian  hegemony;  to  bolster  vital  public  services;  to  preserve  the  multi-
sectarian character of Lebanon; and to counter Hizballah’s influence and false narrative
for  retaining  its  arms  in  Lebanon.  Along  with  the  international  community,  the  United
States supports full implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1559,
1680, and 1701 for the disarming of all militias, delineation of the Lebanese-Syrian border,
and  the  deployment  of  the  Lebanese  Armed  Forces  throughout  Lebanon.  The  United
States is Lebanon’s primary security partner. U.S.-provided aircraft, munitions, vehicles,
and training have increased the capability of the Lebanese Armed Forces to fight violent
extremism. U.S. assistance has also bolstered the Lebanon’s Internal Security Forces in
its efforts to prevent, counter, and respond to criminal and terrorist threats; to secure and
safeguard Lebanon’s territory and people; to interdict items of proliferation concern; and
to extend the rule of law throughout the country.
Lebanon has a free-market economy that is largely service-oriented with growth in
the banking and tourism sectors. The United States and Lebanon have signed a Trade
and Investment Framework agreement to help promote an attractive investment climate,
expand trade relations, and removed obstacles to trade and investment between the two
countries.  Lebanon  and  the  United  States  belong  to  some  of  the  same  international
organizations,  including  the  United  Nations,  International  Monetary  Fund,  and  World
Bank.
Lebanon hosts the highest per capita number of refugees in the world, including
over one million from Syria, which further strained Lebanon’s already weak infrastructure
and ability to deliver social services in 2018. U.S. humanitarian assistance  in Lebanon
supports  the  needs  of  Syrian  refugees  and  host  communities,  including  food,  shelter,
medical  care,  clean  water  and  sanitation,  and  psychosocial  support.  Over  the  past
decade, the United States has invested over $170 million in basic education programs
and  over  $160  million  in  higher  education  programs  in  Lebanon  for  students  from
disadvantaged backgrounds to attend top-ranking universities in Lebanon.
In  2017,  Lebanon’s  most  significant  human  rights  issues  included  arbitrary  or
unlawful  killings,  including  by  government  forces  and  non-state  actors.  There  were  no
reports of government forces committing arbitrary or unlawful killings in 2018, however.
Allegations of torture by security forces; undue and increasing restrictions on freedom of
speech and the press, including laws criminalizing libel and forms of political expression;
and official corruption were issues in 2017 and 2018. Although the legal structure provides
for  prosecution  and  punishment  of  officials  for  human  rights  abuses,  enforcement
remained a problem in 2017 and 2018, and government officials enjoyed a measure of
impunity for human rights abuses.
In September 2018, the U.S. State Department issued a Level 3 travel advisory for
Lebanon, urging U.S. citizens to reconsider or avoid travel to certain areas of Lebanon
because of threats of terrorism, armed clashes, kidnapping, and outbreaks of violence,
particularly near Lebanon’s borders with Syria and Israel. U.S. citizens living and working
in Lebanon are advised that they accept the risk of remaining in the country.  Although
Lebanon was a committed ally in the fight to defeat ISIS in 2017 and its ground forces
were one of the most effective counterterrorism partners in the region, U.S. citizens have
been  targeted  by  terrorist  attacks  in  Lebanon  in  the  past.  The  threat  of  anti-Western
terrorist  activity  persists,  as  does  the  risk  of  death  or  injury  as  a  bystander.  Violent
extremist groups operate in Lebanon, including the U.S. government-designated terrorist
organizations  of  Hizballah,  ISIS,  Al-Nusrah  Front,  Hamas,  and  the  Abdullah  Azzam
Brigades.  Even  though  the  Lebanese  government  reaffirmed  its  official  policy  of
disassociation in 2017, Hizballah continued its military role in Syria in support of the Syrian
regime. Lebanon’s 12 Palestinian refugee camps, including the largest Ain el-Helweh, are
outside the jurisdiction of local security forces and pose a security threat due to potential
militant  recruitment and  terrorist  infiltration. U.S.  citizens  are  advised  to  avoid  travel to
refugee settlements.
Kidnapping, whether for ransom, political motives, or family disputes, is a problem
in  Lebanon.  The  U.S.  government’s  ability  to  help  U.S.  citizens  kidnapped  or  taken
hostage  is  limited.  U.S.  citizens  who  choose  to  travel to Lebanon  in  spite  of  the  travel
advisory are advised that consular officers from the U.S. Embassy are not always able to
travel to assist them. U.S. citizens who also hold Lebanese citizenship are subject to the
requirements and responsibilities of Lebanese citizenship under Lebanese law.

"The  SOR  alleged  Applicant’s  mother-in-law,  father-in-law,  and  extended  family
members are citizens and residents of China (PRC). It also alleged that Applicant has
one friend who is a citizen of Nigeria, but a resident of the PRC, and other friends who
are citizens and residents of the PRC.
In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  the  SOR  allegations,  with
explanations. The admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough
and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the  following
additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  27  years  old.  He  was  born  in  the  United  States.  He  went  to  high
school and college in the United States. He received his bachelor’s degree in chemistry
in 2013. He began working for a defense contractor  in information systems in  January
2017. (Tr. 24-25, 28-29; GE 1)
In September 2013, Applicant took a position teaching English at a university in
the PRC. He remained in the position until January 2016 when his contract ended. He
was  paid  by  the  university.  Applicant  learned  Mandarin  Chinese,  both  written  and
spoken, in high school and college. Applicant met his wife (W) in December 2013 while
in  the  PRC  working.  They  met  through  a  computer-dating-application. They  dated and
then in 2014 decided to marry. They married in February 2016 in the United States. W
was born in the PRC. She is a college graduate with a degree in economics from a PRC
university.  She  came  to  the  United  States  in  2016  on  a  fiancée  Visa  (K1)  and  has
recently  obtained  her  resident  alien  (green  card)  status.  She  intends  to  seek  U.S.
citizenship when she is eligible. She works two jobs as a server in two restaurants in the
United  States.  One  of  the  restaurants  is  owed  by  Applicant’s  parents.  W  testified  that
she  is  close  to her parents, but  closer to her in-laws  with  whom  she and her husband
live. (Tr. 29-31, 34-42; Answer; GE 1)
Applicant’s  father  and  mother  are  U.S.  citizens  and  residents.  W  has  several
family  members  who  are  citizens  of  and  reside  in  the  PRC.  Those  family  members
include:
W’s  father  (F)  and  mother  (M).  F  is  a  retired  music  teacher.  He  continues  to
teach  music.  M  is  retired  from  her  position  at  a  local  television  station.  According  to
Applicant, neither have any PRC government affiliations. Both F and M know Applicant
works in the IT field. Applicant sees F and M on a yearly basis, either by going to the
PRC  or  having  his  in-laws  come  to  the  United  States.  Applicant  intends  to  keep  this
schedule in the future. Applicant’s other contact with them is by video chats that W sets
up. His and W’s contact through this communication is approximately two to three times
a month. (Tr. 43-45, 67-69; 101-102; Ans.)
W’s sister (S). S is a piano teacher at a university in the PRC. Applicant stated
that he communicates with S monthly. W stated that she communicates with S “often”
using  social  media  platforms.  Both  Applicant  and W  acknowledged  that  S  is a  current
member of the Communist Party. W believes S joined the party to advance her career.
(Tr. 45, 69-70, 85, 105-106; GE 1)
W’s  other  relatives  in  the  PRC.  The  SOR  did  not  specifically  list  by  name  or
relationship any other of W’s relatives living in the PRC. The evidence does not support
that there is a sufficient connection between Applicant (through W) and these unnamed
relatives to cause a concern. (Tr. 45, 103-104; GE 1)
Applicant’s friend (F) living in the PRC, a citizen of Nigeria. Applicant met F
while  working  in  the  PRC  from  2013  to  2106.  He  invited  F  to  his  second  wedding
ceremony, which was held in the PRC in 2017. Applicant’s last contact with F was about
three months ago.  He  has  monthly  contact with  F through  social  media.  (Tr. at  47-48;
Ans.; GE 1)
Applicant’s other friends and associates who are citizens and residents of
the  PRC.  The  SOR  did  not  specifically  list  by  name  or  relationship  any  other  of
Applicant’s friends and associates living in the PRC. The evidence does not support that
there  is  a  sufficient  connection  between  Applicant  and  these  unnamed  relatives  to
cause a concern. (Tr. 52-53, 73-74; Ans.; GE1)
Job Performance, Financial, and Character Evidence
Applicant’s  2017  and  2018  job  appraisals  rated  him  as  “exceeds  expectations.”
He  received  two  promotions  in  approximately  two  years.  He  also  received  an
outstanding  achievement  award.  He  does  not  own  a  home,  but  lives  with  his  parents.
He  is  a  registered  voter  in  his  home  county  and  he  has  paid  into  Social  Security.  His
monthly budget shows a net remainder of approximately $1,196. He testified that he has
approximately $10,000 in a retirement account. Applicant’s mother testified that he is a
loyal  U.S.  citizen  and  a  wonderful  son.  Applicant  presented  sworn  declarations  by
supervisors, coworkers, and friends on both his and W’s behalf. They express faith that
Applicant  will  properly  handle  classified  information  and  recommended  that  he  be
granted a security clearance. (Tr. 125; Answer (attached exhibits A-K); AE A-F)
People’s Republic of China
The  PRC  has  an  authoritarian  government,  dominated  by
the  Chinese
Communist Party. The PRC has a poor record with respect to human rights, suppresses
political  dissent,  and  its  practices  include  arbitrary  arrest  and  detention,  forced
confessions,
torture,  and  mistreatment  of  prisoners.  Repression  and  coercion,
particularly against organizations and individuals involved in rights advocacy and public
interest issues, are routine.
The  PRC  is  one  of  the  most  aggressive  countries  in  targeting  sensitive  and
protected  U.S.  technology,  and  economic  intelligence.  It  has  targeted  the  U.S.  with
active intelligence gathering programs, both legal and illegal. In China, authorities have
monitored  telephone  conversations,  facsimile  transmissions,  e-mail,  text  messaging,
and  internet  communications.  Authorities  opened  and  censored  mail.  The  security
services  routinely  monitored  and  entered  residences  and  offices  to  gain  access  to
computers,  telephones,  and  fax  machines.  All  major  hotels  had  a  sizable  internal
security  presence,  and  hotel  guestrooms  were  sometimes  bugged  and  searched  for
sensitive  or  proprietary  materials.  As  recently  as  March  2017,  a  state  department
employee  was  charged  with  failing  to  report  repeated  contacts  with  PRC  foreign
intelligence agents who provided her and her family with thousands of  dollars’ worth of
gifts and benefits over five years. (HE III)

"The SOR alleged under Guideline B that (1.a) that Applicant’s father is a citizen
and  resident  of  Cuba;  and  (1.b)  that  his  sister  is  a  citizen  and  resident  of  Cuba.
Applicant  admitted  the  allegations,  and  provided  detailed  explanations  about  his

Applicant’s  biological  father  is  a  citizen  and  resident  of  Cuba.  (SOR  1.a)
However, Applicant does not know his address and states that his “relationship with his
father  is  estranged  and  mostly  non-existent.”  Applicant  decided  to  terminate  any
relationship with his father ten years ago. He elaborated in his answer to the SOR that it
was  not  an  easy  decision,  but  he  needed  to  cut  “ties”  due  to  his  father  abusing  his
mother.  Applicant  had  no  communication  with  his  biological  father  from  2006  until  he
received  a  birthday  email  from  him  in  August  2016.  Applicant  responded  to  the  email
and  gave  his  father  an  update  on  his  life.  Applicant  wrote  that  he  worked  for  the
Department of Defense. Applicant stated that he gave his father no details. He also did
not give his father his address and telephone number. Applicant has not corresponded
with  him  since  that  time.  (Answer  Item  3)  Applicant  sent  his  father  three  photos  of
himself.
Applicant’s half-sister, who is a citizen and resident of Cuba, also emailed him in
August 2016 to wish him a happy birthday. (SOR 1.b) She stated that she was unhappy
that Applicant had never visited her in Cuba and was not happy that Applicant had not
corresponded with her all these years. Applicant did not respond.
Applicant  has  not  travelled  to  Cuba  in  approximately  15  years  and  does  not
provide  any financial  support to  his  biological father or  half-sister. He  wants  no further
contact with his father or half-sister. (Item 3) He visited Cuba when he was a junior in
high  school  as  a  result  of  a  parental  arrangement.  He  stated  that  he  never  enjoyed  a

supervisors  note  that  Applicant  is  an  outstanding  individual  who  is  dedicated  to  each
project.  There  have  never  been  any  violations  or  disregard  for  his  duties  protecting
sensitive  information.  Another  supervisor  states  that  Applicant  has  shown  leadership,
maturity  and  team  work  in  multiple  areas.  Some  references  have  known  Applicant  for
over nine years. His co-workers admire and respect him. His future-in-laws praise him
for his judgment and dedication to his family in the United States. They are both aware

States has provided him with the opportunity to develop a career in something that he
loves and has allowed him to serve in the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force as a reservist.
He has worked for over ten years with the Department of Defense. (AX A, Item 4)

"In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a-g. These admissions
are  incorporated  in  my  findings  of  fact.  Applicant  provided  explanations  for  the  SOR
allegations.
Applicant  is  46  years  old  and  has  an  undergraduate  degree  in  botany  from  a
university in India, as well as two master’s degrees. He was born in India, came to the
United States in 2007, and was naturalized in 2016. His spouse is a naturalized citizen of
the United States. They have been married for 15 years and have two children who are
U.S.  citizens  by  birth.  He  has  renounced  his  Indian  citizenship  and  carries  a  U.S.
passport.  Since  2017,  he  has  been  employed  by  a  government  contractor.  However,
Applicant has been working as a scientist in the field for many years. (GX 1)
Applicant’s mother and father are  citizens and  residents of  India. (SOR  1.a and

for the Indian government or know the nature of Applicant’s work. Applicant has given his
parents about $15,000 in financial support over the years. They were gifts to his parents,
as they are both retired professionals and have pensions. (SOR 1.e)
In about 2015, Applicant and his wife purchased an apartment in India, which is
currently under construction, as a surprise gift for his parents. The approximate value is
$105,000.  The  property  is  financed  through  a  bank.  The  estimated  balance  of  the
mortgage is $70,000. (SOR 1.f) Applicant fully disclosed all possible financial interests in
India on his security clearance and responses to questions. (GX 2). The construction is
to  be  completed  in  2019.  (AX  E)  He  is  willing  to  sign  the  property  over  to  his  parents
before  end  of  construction  if  necessary.  The  value  of  the  property  constitutes  a  small
fraction of his net worth.
Applicant and his wife co-own a bank account in India to facilitate wire transfers
from his bank in the United States.  The account is used to pay for the apartment under
construction for his parents. SOR 1.g) He presented documentation that the account is
now closed. (AX D)
Applicant  and  his  wife  currently  own  a  house  in  the  United  States  that  is  worth
about  $359,000.  (Tr.  48)  His  current  salary  is  about  $155,000.  His  wife  earns  about
$120,000. He approximates that the value of the apartment property in India is about 10
or 20 percent of his total net worth.  His investments are about $650,000 to $ 700,000.
Applicant submitted documentation from his various savings accounts, pay stub, 401(k)
investment accounts, checking account and a personal financial statement. (AX C with
13 attachments). He and his wife want to settle in his current state as they want their two
children to receive a fine education. He was emphatic that the United States is home now
and forever. Both of their professional careers have flourished in the United States. (Tr.

When  questioned  about  a  possible  dilemma  between  protecting  classified
information versus loyalty to his family, Applicant recognizes his deep ties to his family,
but would not endanger national security. He would report any problem to his FSO. (Tr.
38)
Applicant presented two witnesses at the hearing. Each testified that Applicant is
a  man  of  his  word.  They  each  have  had  professional  dealings  with  Applicant  and
recommend  him  for  a  security  clearance.  (Tr.  59-62)  They  are  aware  of  the  SOR
allegations.  They  work  closely  with  Applicant  and  both  hold  security  clearances  and
recognize the Applicant has been extremely conscientious about classified or sensitive
information. (Tr. 64)
Applicant submitted six affidavits from people who have known him and his work
in the United States. (AX B, with 6 attachments) Each has had an opportunity to observe
Applicant and do not believe he would succumb to foreign pressure.
Administrative Notice (Republic of India)
In response to the Government’s request, to which Applicant did not object, I have
taken administrative notice of the following relevant facts about the Republic of India:
  The  2000  and  2008  Annual  Reports  to  Congress  on  Foreign  Economic
Collection  and  Industrial  Espionage  identified  India  as  being  involved  in
economic collection and industrial espionage.

In June 2013, a member of parliament in India and a close advisor to a now-
deceased chief minister was among those indicted by the U.S. Department of
Justice for allegedly soliciting bribes for himself and other government officials
in India in return for approving licenses to mine titanium minerals.
  As  of  March  2016,  India  continued  to  experience  terrorist  and  insurgent
activities. Anti-Western terrorist groups active in India, some of which are on
the  U.S.  government’s  list  of  foreign  terrorist  organizations,  include  Islamist
extremist  groups  Harkat-ul-Jihad,  Harakat  ul-Mujahidin,  Indian  Myjahideen,
Jaish-e-Mohammed, and Lashker-e Tayyiba.
  As  of  2015,  the  most  significant  human  rights  problems  involved  police  and
security  force  abuses,  including  extrajudicial  killings,  torture,  and  rape;
corruption  remained  widespread  and  contributed  to  ineffective  responses  to
crimes, including those against women, children, and members of scheduled
castes or tribes, and societal violence based on gender, religious affiliation, and
caste  or  tribe.  Other  human  rights  problems  included  disappearances,
hazardous prison conditions, arbitrary arrest and detention, and lengthy pretrial
detention. A lack of accountability for misconduct at all levels of government
persisted, contributing to widespread impunity.
Law and Policies
It is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.2 As noted
by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent standard
indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of
denials.”3  Under  Egan,  Executive  Order  10865,  and  the  Directive,  any  doubt  about
whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved
in favor of protecting national security.
2 Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (“it should be obvious that no one has a ‘right’ to
a security clearance”); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no right to a
security clearance).
3 484 U.S. at 531.
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a  security  clearance  for  access  to  confidential,  secret,  or  top-secret  information.4  An
unfavorable  clearance  decision  (1)  denies  any  application,  (2)  revokes  any  existing
security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.5
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information.6 The Government has the burden of presenting evidence
to  establish  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR  that  have  been  controverted.7  An  applicant  is
responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that
have  been  admitted  or  proven.8  In  addition,  an  applicant  has  the  ultimate  burden  of
persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.9
In  Egan,  the  Supreme  Court  stated  that  the  burden  of  proof  is  less  than  a
preponderance of evidence.10 The Appeal Board has followed the Court’s reasoning, and
a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.11
Guideline B (Foreign Influence)
Discussion
The security concern under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) is set out in AG ¶ 6,
as follows:
Foreign  contacts  and  interests,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  business,
financial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result
in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they
create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced
to  help  a    foreign  person,  group,  organization,  or  government  in  a  way
inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure
or  coercion  by  any  foreign  interest.  Assessment  of  foreign  contacts  and
interests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest
is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether it is

known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or
is associated with a risk of terrorism.
Four disqualifying conditions under this Guideline are relevant:
AG  ¶  7(a):  contact,  regardless  of  method,  with  a  foreign  family  member,
business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen
of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk
of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;
AG ¶ 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country
that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual’s obligation
to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual’s desire to
help  a foreign   person,  group,  or country  by  providing  that  information  or
technology;
AG  ¶  7(e)  shared  living  quarters  with  a  person  or  persons,  regardless  of
citizenship  status,  if  that  relationship  creates  a  heightened  risk  of  foreign
inducement , manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and
AG ¶ 7(f): substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign
country, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, that could
subject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation
or personal conflict of interest.
Applicant’s close family ties to his mother, father, brother and mother-in-law who
are  citizens and residents of India, and his financial interest in India establish AG ¶¶ 7(a),
7(b),  7(e),  and  7(f).    A  “heightened  risk”  is  associated  with  India,  given  the  significant
human rights and terrorism problems existent there, and its history of economic collection
and industrial espionage.
Application of Guideline B is not a comment on an applicant’s patriotism but merely
an acknowledgment that people may act in unpredictable ways when faced with choices
that could be important to a loved one, such as a family member.12 Family relationships
can involve matters of influence or obligation.13 Therefore, Applicant’s family ties with his
wife’s family, property ownership, and other financial interests in India raise concerns for
which he has the burden of persuasion to mitigate.14

14 ISCR Case No. 99-0532 at 7 (App. Bd. Dec. 15, 2000) (When an applicant’s ties in a foreign country raise
a prima facie security concern, the  applicant is required to present evidence  of rebuttal,  extenuation, or
mitigation sufficient to carry his burden of persuasion that it is “clearly consistent with the national interest”
to grant or continue a security clearance on his behalf).
The following mitigating conditions under this Guideline are potentially relevant:
AG ¶ 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country
in  which  these  persons  are  located,  or  the positions  or activities  of  those
persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed
in  a  position  of  having  to  choose  between  the  interests  of  a  foreign
individual,  group,  organization,  or  government  and  the  interests  of  the
United States;
AG  ¶  8(b):  there  is  no  conflict  of  interest,  either  because  the  individual’s
sense of loyalty or allegiance to the foreign person, group, government, or
country  is  so  minimal,  or  the  individual  has  such  deep  and  longstanding
relationships  and  loyalties  in  the  United  States  that  the  individual can  be
expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U. S. interest;
AG ¶ 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and
infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign
influence or exploitation; and
AG ¶ 8(f): the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or
property  interests  is  such  that  they  are  unlikely  to  result  in  a  conflict  and
could  not  be  used  effectively  to  influence,  manipulate,  or  pressure  the
individual.
For the reasons set out in the discussion of AG ¶¶ 7(a), 7(b), 7(e) and 7(f), above,
AG ¶ 8(a) is not established. Applicant has lived in the United States since 2007. He was
naturalized in 2016. His wife is a naturalized U.S. citizen. He has two children who are
U.S. citizens. Applicant speaks to his family members frequently. None of his family or in-
laws have connections to the Indian government.
Applicant has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.
that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.
There is little likelihood that Applicant’s communications with his family could create a risk
for foreign influence or exploitation. Applicant’s Indian bank account is closed. He will give
the  apartment  property  to  his  parents.  His  financial  status  in  the  United  States  far
outweighs the financial interests in India. His Indian property is not worth as much as his
liquid  assets  in  the  United  States.    Applicant  has  substantial  retirement  and  savings
accounts in the United States. He owns a home in the United States.  Applicant’s property
interest in India are such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be used
effectively  to  influence,  manipulate,  or  pressure  the  individual.  I  find  that  mitigating
conditions AG ¶¶ 8(b), 8(c), and 8(f) apply.
Conclusion
The  record  does  not  create  doubt  about  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,
good judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I
weighed the evidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed
the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due consideration to the whole-person
concept.15 Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant met his ultimate burden of persuasion
under the foreign influence guideline to show that it is clearly consistent with the national
interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.
As required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following
formal findings on the SOR allegations:
Paragraph 1, Guideline B:
For Applicant
Subparagraphs 1.a-1.g:                    For Applicant
Conclusion
In light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to
grant Applicant access to classified information.

Administrative Judge
15 AG ¶ 2(d)(1)-(9). In that consideration, I gave positive weight to the Applicant’s credibility, demeanor and
maturity.
",True
"The SOR alleges under Guideline B that Applicant’s parents-in law (SOR ¶ 1.a),
brother-in-law and his spouse (SOR ¶ 1.b), and spouse’s grandmother (SOR ¶ 1.c) are
resident  citizens  of  China.  In  a  detailed  response  to  the  SOR  allegations,  which  was
included in AE B, Applicant admitted that his spouse’s relatives are resident citizens of
China, but he indicated that his and his spouse’s contacts with her family in China are so
casual,  infrequent,  and  minimal  that  they  do  not  create  a  risk  of  foreign  exploitation,
inducement,  manipulation,  persuasion,  or  coercion.  After  considering  the  pleadings,
exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 32-year-old technical staff member at a federally-funded research
and  development  laboratory.  (GE  1;  AE  B.)  He  has  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  aerospace
engineering  awarded  in  June  2009,  and  a  master’s  degree  in  engineering  and
management awarded in June 2014 from the same university. (GE 1; AEs A-C, N-O; Tr.
29-30.) Applicant previously worked for his current employer from July 2009 to August
2013  (GE 1;  AE  A; Tr.  28-29,  92),  and he  was  granted  a Secret  clearance  in October
2009.  His  clearance  was  upgraded  to  Top  Secret  in  March  2010.  He  ended  his
employment  because  the  university  could  not  give  him  a  scholarship  while  he  was
working for the laboratory, and his clearance eligibility lapsed. After he returned to work
for the laboratory full time in April 2015, his security clearance eligibility was renewed at
the  Secret  level.  He  was  granted  an  interim  Top  Secret  clearance  in  June  2016.  He
currently holds a Secret clearance. (GE 1; AEs A-B, R; Tr. 32-33, 93.)
A  lifelong  resident  citizen  of  the  United  States  (GE  1;  AEs  A-D),  Applicant  was
raised with his only sibling in a small town by his U.S. native-citizen mother, who moved
back  home  after  her  divorce  when  Applicant  was  four  years  old.  His  maternal
grandparents, both U.S. native citizens, helped raised Applicant and his sister, and they
remained an important part of his life, even after his mother remarried. He lived with his
mother, stepfather, and sister during his youth, before his mother and stepfather divorced.
Applicant was raised with strong American values. He celebrated holidays with his family,
played hockey throughout his youth, and was a Boy Scout. After excelling in high school,
he received a scholarship from a prestigious university in the United States. He was active
in his fraternity in college, and he is still active in fundraising for capital improvements for
the local chapter of his fraternity. (GE 1; AEs A-D, N-Q; Tr. 19-26.)
Applicant met his spouse in October 2013 at a housewarming party of a mutual
acquaintance. He was in graduate school and did not have a security clearance at that
time. (Tr. 38.) A native of China with Chinese citizenship, his spouse was raised in China
with her twin brother. She graduated from a Chinese university in June 2007, having spent
the previous summer as an exchange student in the United States. In August 2007, she
came  to  the  United  States  on  an  F-1  student  visa  to  pursue  a  doctorate  degree  in
computational biology. While a graduate student, she traveled to China twice in 2008 to
visit her parents and grandparents. She traveled to China to renew her visa in April 2010.
Although  her  parents  disapproved,  she  elected  to  stay  in  the  United  States  after  she
earned her doctorate degree in May 2012 because of the high scientific standards in the
United States  and for the  career  opportunities  in her field.  She began  working,  initially
under her student visa, which was extended for training purposes. In 2013, she obtained
an H-1B visa under the sponsorship of her employer. (AEs B, X; Tr. 36-39, 94-95.) She
has  been  consistently  employed  by  the  same  parent  company  in  the  United  States,
working for different units after some corporate reorganizations. (GE 2; AE X; Tr. 41-42.)
Her current salary is $120,000 a year. (Tr. 95.)
Applicant  and  his  spouse  began  dating  in  late  2013.  Applicant  had  left  the
employment of the federally-funded research laboratory and had started his own business
in the energy sector. (GE 1; AE A; Tr. 30.) In December 2013, Applicant’s spouse traveled
to China to renew her H-1B visa. She visited her mother, father, and brother during her
19-day stay, and shared a photo of Applicant with them. In June 2014, Applicant and his
spouse began cohabiting. (GE 1; AEs A-B, X; Tr. 40.) Applicant made an effort to have
his spouse involved in gatherings of his family, who welcomed her. (AEs Q, Y.) He took
her to meet his family for the first time in 2014, and over time his spouse developed close
relationships with his mother and sister. (AE X.)
Applicant’s spouse traveled to China in September 2014 to give a presentation for
her  U.S.–based  employer  at  an  international  conference.  She  visited  her  parents  and
brother  during  that  trip  and  told  her  parents  that  she  and  Applicant  were  in  a  stable
relationship. Applicant returned to work for the laboratory in April 2015. (GE 1; AE A; Tr.
31.) In September 2015, he and his spouse traveled to China for him to meet her parents,
for  tourism,  and  for  her  to  renew  her  H-1B  visa.  (AEs  B,  X;  Tr.  69.)  He  informed  his
employer  about  his  trip  ahead  of  time.  (Tr.  69.)  During  his  three-week  stay  in  China,
Applicant and his spouse visited her parents, her grandparents, and her brother and his
fiancée. Applicant had limited communication with them because of the language barrier.
He had to rely on his spouse to translate. (Tr. 49.) When Applicant’s in-laws asked his
spouse about  Applicant’s  occupation,  she  told  them  that  he founded  a  start-up  energy
company.  He  was  still  pursuing  the  business  venture  while  working  for  his  defense
contractor employer, but she did not inform her parents of his employment in the U.S.
defense  industry.  Applicant’s  spouse  traveled  to  China  without  him  for  her  brother’s
wedding in December 2015. During her stay, her parents inquired about her relationship
with Applicant but not about his employment. (AEs B, X.)
Applicant and his spouse became engaged in May 2016. (Tr. 40, 96.) A few days
later, Applicant completed and certified to the accuracy of a Questionnaire for National
Security Positions (SF 86) for a clearance upgrade. (GE 1; AE A; Tr. 79.) He reported his
cohabitation since June 2014 with his spouse and indicated that she was born in China.
In response to an inquiry concerning whether he or an immediate family member had any
foreign  government  contacts  in  the  last  seven  years,  Applicant  reported  that  his
cohabitant  had  contact  with  the  Chinese  Consulate  in  December  2010  to  renew  her
Chinese passport. In response to a question concerning foreign travel in the last seven
years,  Applicant  disclosed  his  trip  to  China  from  September  2015  to  October 2015  for
tourism purposes. He answered negatively to inquiries concerning whether he had any
contacts or issues outside of routine border contacts. (GE 1; AE B.)
Applicant closed his start-up business in September 2016 due to a lack of funding
and customers. (GE 2; AE B; Tr. 30.) Applicant and his spouse traveled to China in April
2017 so that she could renew her H-1B visa. Applicant stayed in China for one week, and
he and his spouse visited her grandparents. (Tr. 70, 116.) Applicant’s spouse stayed in
China  for  a  few  weeks  after  Applicant  returned  to  the  United  States  because  her
grandfather was near death. (AE B.)
In July 2017, Applicant and his spouse married in the United States.  Several of
Applicant’s  family  members,  including  his  mother,  sister,  maternal  grandparents,  and
maternal uncles attended the wedding. (AEs B, N-P.) His spouse’s parents, brother, and
brother’s  wife  came  from  China  for  the  wedding  (AE  B,  Tr.  115),  even  though  they
disapproved of the marriage. (AEs E, J, N-P, Tr. 50, 52.) His spouse’s family stayed in a
hotel. (Tr. 52, 107, 115.) Applicant explained that they made the decision to attend only
a week before the wedding after his spouse convinced them it was the right thing to do.
(Tr. 115.)
Applicant updated his SF-86 to reflect that his cohabitant was now his spouse. (AE
B.) In August 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the Office
of Personnel Management (OPM). He disclosed that he had in-person contact with his
parents-in-law in September 2015 and July 2017. He did not know their occupations and
denied that they had any association with a foreign government, including its security or
intelligence  services,  or  its  defense  industry.  When  asked  about  developed  foreign
contacts, Applicant related that he had quarterly contact with his spouse’s brother, a self-
employed  web  designer  in  China,  and  with  her  brother’s  wife,  a  translator  in  China.
Applicant indicated that he had annual contact with his spouse’s grandmother. Applicant
denied that he could be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of
a  foreign  individual  or  government  and  the  United  States,  and  stated  that  if  a  conflict
arose, he would resolve the matter in the U.S. interests. He asserted he would abide by
reporting  requirements  and  added  that  these  foreign  contacts  do  not  know  that  he  is
undergoing consideration for a national security position. (GE 2; AE B.)
Applicant  was  re-interviewed  by  the  OPM  investigator  on  August  22,  2017,  for
details about the occupations of his spouse’s parents and grandparents. He related that
his  parents-in-law  are  professors  at  the  same  university  in  China.  His  spouse’s
grandmother and grandfather had worked for a telecommunications school, as a teacher
and  engineer,  respectively.  (GE  2;  AE  B.)  His  spouse’s  grandmother  retired
approximately 20 years ago. (AE B; Tr. 117.)
Applicant and his spouse traveled to China for five days in September 2017 after
spending their honeymoon elsewhere in Asia. They had an informal celebration of their
marriage for his spouse’s family and friends who were unable to attend their wedding in
the United States as a sign of respect for her family. (Tr. 70, 115.) Applicant’s spouse’s
family, including her grandmother and some extended family members, and some of her
college  friends  attended  the  informal  celebration.  (Tr.  125-126.)  To  Applicant’s
knowledge, his employment was not discussed during that trip. (AEs B, X.) As with his
previous trips to China, he reported his travel to his employer. (Tr. 69.)
Applicant’s spouse, who is age 34, received her U.S. permanent residence status
in July 2018. She intends to apply for U.S. citizenship when she becomes eligible in 2021
(Tr. 95-96), and she does not intend to travel to China in the future unless her parents or
brother becomes gravely ill or dies. His spouse is bilingual, but she now considers English
her primary language. She has not voted in a Chinese election since a 2002 local election,
and she does not intend to vote in a Chinese election in the future.  Applicant’s spouse
has adopted America as her home and become assimilated into American ways of life.
She  celebrates  American  holidays,  enjoys  and  plays  U.S.  sports,  and  participates  in
monthly meetings of her condominium association. She has close friendships with U.S.
citizens, and has a 401(k) account in the United States valued at $120,000. She co-owns
other assets  with  Applicant,  including  their  residence,  which  they  purchased  in  August
2017 (GE 2; AE B; Tr. 42-43), and a brokerage account valued at $64,000. They have
savings  and  checking  account  assets of approximately  $75,000.  (AE  X.)Their  total  net
worth  is  about  $750,000.  (Tr.  46.)  Applicant’s  spouse  has  a  dormant  bank  account  in
China  with  $100  on  deposit.  She  cannot  access  the  account  online.  Her  mother  can
access  the  account.  Applicant’s  spouse  plans  to  close  the  account  should  she  go  to
China. She has no investment assets in China and owns no property in China. (AE X.)
On  October  31,  2018,  Applicant  responded  to  DOHA  interrogatories  about  his
foreign  contacts.  Applicant  reported  that  his spouse  had  acquired  her  U.S.  permanent
residence card. He listed his parents-in-law’s employments as professors at a university
in China, but denied that they  were affiliated with a foreign government or military. He
described  the  frequency  of  his  contacts  with  them  as  quarterly,  with  his  most  recent
contacts occurring in April 2018 with his father-in-law and in June 2018 with his mother-
in-law.  He  indicated  that  his  spouse  has  weekly  contact  with  her  parents.  Concerning
contacts with his spouse’s brother, Applicant described the frequency of his contact as
quarterly to as recently as September 2018, and his spouse’s contact as weekly. As for
his brother-in-law’s wife, Applicant indicated that he did not know her current employment
because she had recently changed jobs. It had been since May 2018 that he had  any
contact  with  her,  but  his  spouse  had  monthly  contact  with  her  sister-in-law.  Applicant
reported that his spouse’s grandfather had died in May 2017. He denied any contact with
his  spouse’s  grandmother  beyond  the  in-person  contacts  in  China.  His  spouse  had
contact with her on a weekly basis. (GE 2.)
On November 20, 2018, the DOD CAF issued an SOR to Applicant because his
spouse’s  family  members  (parents,  brother  and  brother’s  wife,  and  grandmother)  are
resident citizens of China. Applicant decided at that time to cease any communications
with his spouse’s family in China. He did not want to jeopardize his security clearance
and career. (Tr. 50.)
In  his  response  to  the  SOR  dated  December  21,  2018,  Applicant  detailed  his
spouse’s  increased  ties  to  the  United  States  since  her  arrival  as  a  doctoral  student  in
August 2007. He explained that his spouse had planned in 2007 to return home to China
every six months because she thought she would have difficulty adjusting to life in the
United  States,  but  that  changed  after  two  years.  Since  obtaining  her  “green  card,”  his
spouse no longer needs to travel to China to renew her visa to stay in the United States,
and  she  has  no  intention  to  return  to  China. He  added  that because  she has  adopted
American ways and culture, she finds it more difficult to relate to her friends and family in
China, which has led to decreased frequency of her communications with them over the
years. Applicant described his relationship with his parents-in-law as “strained” and his
interactions with them as “the minimum necessary to be polite,” elaborating as follows:
Upon hearing of my proposal to [spouse’s name omitted], they told her they
would  not  approve  of  the  marriage  and  I  would  not  be  accepted  into  the
family because of the cultural differences between Americans and Chinese.
They continue to disapprove of me since I do not have a doctoral degree
and  I  have  no  intention  of  pursuing  additional  education  to  change  their
opinion. They don’t care to learn anything about me and I have no desire to
learn about or interact with them. When we are in the room together, there
are long periods of silence as my mother- and father-in-law do not speak to
me and I do not speak to them. Because of my detached relationship with
my mother- and father-in-law, it is extremely unlikely that I will be placed in
a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual,
group, organization, or government and the interests of the United States.
(AE B.)
Applicant  sees  no  reason  to  engage  with  his  spouse’s  family  members  in  the
future. He does not intend to travel to China in the future. (Tr. 52.) He testified that his
mother-in-law  “definitely  has  a  dislike  of  [him].”  (Tr.  54.)  Their  relationship  has  been
particularly  contentious  because  he  is  “a  person  of  some  color  and  American.  Not
Chinese.” (Tr. 57.) Applicant wants nothing to do with his spouse’s family in the future.
(Tr.  68.)  He  indicated  that  he  would  absolutely  keep  them  from  coming  to  the  United
States  if  he  could.  (Tr.  67.)  On  the  limited  occasions  where  he  had  sent  them  a  text
message for their birthdays and major holidays, they responded politely in Chinese. They
know little English and he knows little Chinese. They have not initiated any contact with
him, and he has had no email or telephone correspondence with his parents-in-law. (AE
B.)
Applicant’s spouse does not have any ongoing contact by telephone or email with
her family  in  China.  As  of  December 2018,  she  was  communicating  with  them  by  text
messaging every two weeks, to exchange greetings or comment about photos posted.
Applicant indicated that, in the past, his spouse had given her parents $1,000 each time
that she traveled to China to cover the expenses of her trips, but neither he nor his spouse
plan  on  giving  any  money  to  her  parents  in  the  future.  Applicant’s  spouse  was  given
$4,500 from her parents as a wedding gift, but she had not received any other money
from her parents in recent years. (AE B; Tr. 45-48.)
Applicant understands from his spouse that her mother and father currently work
part-time as auditors at a private college which has a partnership agreement with a state
university in China. They officially retired from their academic careers at the college as
professors of mathematics and engineering in 2010 and 2014, respectively. The college
has  its  own  funding.  (Tr.  97-98.)  His  parents-in-law  are  members  of  the  Chinese
Communist Party (CCP). His mother-in-law is currently serving a two-year term from 2017
to  2019  as  the  CCP’s  representative  to  the  college  on  retirement  issues.  She  is
responsible  for  organizing  meetings  of  university  teachers  and  professors  to  discuss
retirement  rulings  and  decisions  from  the  central  government.  (AE  B;  Tr.  98-100.)  His
spouse learned about her mother’s CCP position in the summer of 2018. (AE B; Tr. 102.)
His  parents-in-law’s  CCP  affiliation  was  another  motivation  for  Applicant  to  cease  all
communications with them. (AE B.)
Applicant  does  not  believe  that  his  spouse’s  family  members  know  about  his
defense-contractor employment. Applicant’s contact with his spouse’s parents has been
limited  to  his  in-person  contacts  during  his  trips  to  China  in  September  2015  and
September 2017  and his wedding  in  the  United States  in  July  2017,  and to a few  text
messages.  When  Applicant  informed  his  brother-in-law  about  his  engagement  to  his
spouse,  his  brother-in-law  told  him  the  relationship  would  not  work  out.  Applicant’s
relationship with his brother-in-law has been distant and strained since then. (AE B; Tr.
58-59.) Applicant’s spouse’s contact with her brother had decreased by December 2018
to once every two weeks. She gave her brother $1,000 for his wedding in 2015 and $1,000
in 2017 on the birth of his son. Neither Applicant nor his spouse intend to give any money
to her brother in the future. Applicant and his spouse have very limited contact with his
spouse’s  brother’s  wife,  and  they  are  not  aware  of  their  sister-in-law’s  current
employment, if any. She previously worked at a shipping logistics company. (AE B; Tr.
60.) To Applicant’s knowledge, neither his spouse’s brother nor brother’s wife is affiliated
with the Chinese government or military. (Tr. 112.)
Applicant has been the subject of racist comments from his spouse’s grandmother,
who continues to disapprove of him. (Tr. 118.) Applicant’s spouse’s grandmother has no
desire or interest to interact with him and the feeling is mutual. He has only interacted
with her during his trips to China. He has otherwise had no communication with her. In
December  2018,  Applicant  estimated  the  frequency  of  his  spouse’s  contacts  with  her
grandmother to be every two weeks. His spouse received $1,000 from her grandmother
as a wedding gift. (AE B; Tr. 63.)
Applicant’s spouse provided an affidavit dated May 4, 2019, in which she described
her connections to the United States, including employment, financial, friendships, familial
through  her  marriage,  legal  immigration,  activities,  and  interests.  Should  she  and
Applicant have children, they plan to raise them in the United States “learning American
culture  and  practicing  American  values.”  Regarding  her  family  members  in  China,
Applicant’s  spouse  asserts  that  she  does  not  have  close  relations  with  them.  Her
correspondence with her grandmother consists of one text message a month “to politely
require about her health.” She indicated that her mother has shown little interest in her
life  throughout  her  life,  and  their  relationship  has  become  only  more  distant  since  she
moved to the United States. She texts her mother once a month to wish her well. About
her  mother’s  position  as  the  CCP  representative  on  retirement  matters,  Applicant’s
spouse described it as “the lowest level position one can hold in the Communist Party.”
Her communication with her father consists of text messaging once a month on “logistical
topics”  and  nothing  personal.  She  considers  her  relationship  to  her  brother  to  be
superficial and with her brother’s wife to be distant but polite. She communicates with her
brother by text messaging once a month and with her sister-in-law three or four times a
year. Applicant’s spouse indicates that Applicant has “cut off all communications” with her
family members in China. Applicant’s spouse expressed no intention of traveling to China
unless her parents or brother becomes gravely ill or pass away. She indicated that should
she and Applicant have children, her parents and brother and his wife might travel to the
United States once every couple of years while the children are young. (AE X.) Applicant’s
spouse  reduced  the  frequency  of  her  contacts  with  her family  in  China  after Applicant
informed her that her communications with them was putting his job and career at risk,
and because of the way her family has treated him. (Tr. 105, 119.) Applicant testified that
since their marriage, her family has “really pushed [his spouse] away.” (Tr. 105, 110.)
Applicant credibly professes sole allegiance to the United States. He has voted in
every national election and most local elections since he became eligible to vote at age
18. (AEs B, V.) He registered for the U.S. Selective Service in August 2004. (AEs B, W.)
He is on the finance committee for his homeowner’s association. When he is not traveling
for work, he plays in an adult sports league. He has served as alumni president for the
local chapter of his fraternity for the past three years. His family members were all born
in the United States with the exception of his paternal grandmother, who was raised in
the United States and is a U.S. citizen. Applicant is not close to his paternal grandmother
because of his parents’ divorce. (AE B.) His financial assets are all in the United States.
(Tr. 46.) His current salary at his defense-contractor employment is $138,000 annually.
(Tr. 93.) He understands that he could be targeted for classified information. If anything
changes in terms of communication from his spouse’s family, he would immediately report
them.  (Tr.  73.)  He  would  not  hesitate  to  report  any  improper  contact  to  his  security
department, including if it came from his spouse. (Tr. 75.)
Employment and Character References
Applicant accesses classified information for his duties with his current employer
on a bi-weekly basis. He is required to maintain a minimum of a Secret clearance for his
employment. (AE B; Tr. 32.) He has stayed up-to-date on his security trainings and takes
his security responsibilities seriously. (AEs S-T; Tr. 72.) He considers it “the highest honor
to be able to hold a security clearance.” He has earned a reputation at work for performing
at a level higher than expected. (AE U.) The chief security officer at the laboratory attests
that  Applicant  has  not  had  any  security-related  incidents  on  the  job.  Applicant  was
“purposeful and timely” in reporting all required updates to his personal background, such
as his marriage to a Chinese national and her foreign relatives. He has been briefed about
foreign intelligence recruitment and counterintelligence awareness topics and about his
reporting  requirements.  The  security  officer  sees  no  reason  why  Applicant  would  not
continue to report any information as required. He has demonstrated an understanding
of his responsibilities and of the reporting requirements. (AE R.)
On  his  return  to  his  employment  with  the  federally-funded  research  and
development  laboratory  in  April  2015,  Applicant  made  a  major  but  seamless  transition
from a hardware engineer to a systems analysis role. His overall performance for 2015
was rated as very good, and excellent in the areas of technical breadth, productivity, and
teaming.  By  the  time  of  his  performance  rating  for  2016,  he  had  become  one  of  the
primary technical contributors to a DOD study and a U.S. military demonstration initiative.
He was an asset to his group in that he was able to support both systems analysis and
hardware development efforts. In 2017, Applicant traveled extensively to military sites and
briefed military officers and government officials as a key contributor in his area of growing
expertise. His overall performance for 2017 was rated as outstanding. In February 2018,
he was promoted to technical staff, where he is now responsible for technical and financial
oversight of his programs. (Tr. 32, 34.) He proved to be good at prioritizing program goals
and tasks, and paying attention to staffing needs and finances to make sure that program
goals were met on time. Applicant was given an outstanding performance rating for 2018.
(AE  U;  Tr.  35.)  Noting  Applicant’s  dedication  to  performing  above  time  and  above
expectations on projects, his rating supervisor advised him to find a sustainable work-life
balance to ensure that he does not get burned out. (AE U.)
Applicant’s direct supervisor provided a character reference letter (AE E) and also
testified for Applicant. He has known Applicant since April 2015, initially as an officemate
and colleague, and since October 2017 as his supervisor. He has had the opportunity to
observe Applicant’s work on a daily basis, and to travel with Applicant extensively to U.S.
military installations. They have a close relationship outside of work as well. He was best
man  at Applicant’s  wedding,  and  he  and  his  wife  have  had multiple  social  interactions
with Applicant and his spouse. He has met Applicant’s family, including extended family
members  who  attended  Applicant’s  wedding,  and  attests  to  the  close  relationship
Applicant has with his family. He also met Applicant’s spouse’s parents and brother at the
wedding  and  indicates  that  Applicant’s  in-laws  continue  to  be  “not  particularly  happy”
about the marriage. He believes that their racism about Applicant’s paternal heritage is
the  root  cause  of  their  disinterest  in  having  a  relationship  with  Applicant.  The
supervisor/friend  opined  that  Applicant’s  spouse  does  not  have  a  particularly  warm
relationship with her parents, and that her relationship with them has declined drastically
as  Applicant’s  spouse  has  become  “Americanized  in  her  thinking  and  actions.”  In  his
opinion, her parents are disappointed with her for staying in the United States and not
returning  to  China  to  help  them;  that  her  mother  feels  that  she  has  lost  control  of  her
daughter, “who is not displaying the appropriate thankfulness for the sacrifices that they
made for her education and who is not submissive enough to her parent’s wishes for who
she  should marry.”  Applicant’s  supervisor/friend  is aware  of  the  SOR,  but he  does not
share the concerns. Applicant is “one of the most fastidious and careful people [he knows]
of when it comes to handling classified information.” He explained that, because of the
nature  of  their  work,  there  is  no  good  security  classification  guidance.  Applicant  is
extremely concerned about the aggregation of information and does not discuss his work
outside  of  the  office.  He  has  no  concerns  about  Applicant’s  ability  to  handle  classified
10
information  appropriately.  (AE  E;  Tr.  129-140,  144-145.)  Applicant  has  “a  stellar
reputation” at work. (Tr. 134.) The supervisor/friend knows that Applicant’s mother-in-law
has some affiliation with the Chinese government. (Tr. 148.) In his opinion, Applicant does
not have a relationship with his spouse’s Chinese family to exploit. (Tr. 143.) Based on
his observations, the supervisor/friend believes that Applicant would probably choose the
U.S. interests over his spouse’s interests in the event of undue pressure. (Tr. 144-145.)
He elaborated that all Applicant has wanted to do in life is to help the government or make
it  better. He  expressed  confidence  that  Applicant  would  report any  attempts  at foreign
influence. (Tr. 149, 151.)
A work colleague of Applicant’s since July 2015 has partnered with Applicant on
several projects. She testified for him and provided a character reference letter (AE G).
She  attests  to  Applicant  being  “highly  detail  oriented  [and]  hyper-aware  of  operational
security.” They have developed a friendship, and in that regard, she knows Applicant to
be  dedicated  to  his  volunteer  activities,  including  presently  as  the  alumni  president
overseeing  a  massive  house  renovation  for  the  local  chapter  of  his  fraternity.  This
colleague/friend  knows  that  Applicant  “does  not  particularly  like  his  wife’s  family.”  (Tr.
175.) He made it clear to her that he considers his in-laws to be rude and insensitive; that
if he and his spouse have any children, they will be raised only in the United States; and
that he will limit his spouse’s family’s interactions with them. (Tr. 175-176.) Applicant has
not  given  his  colleague/friend  any  indication  to  doubt  his  loyalty.  He  has  been  vigilant
about  the  confidentiality  and  sensitivity  of  his  work.  He  does  not  take  work  home  and
chooses instead to spend late hours at the laboratory to ensure that deadlines are met.
He inspires his co-workers to care about their projects. (AE G; Tr. 171-.176.)
A  former  senior  advisor  for  the  U.S.  military,  who  is  an  attorney  in  the  U.S.
Reserves,  now  has  his  own  consulting  company.  (Tr.  81,  153-154.)  He  testified  for
Applicant and  also authored  a  character  reference  letter  (AE  F).  He  strongly  endorses
Applicant for continued security clearance eligibility. He met Applicant through their work
on  behalf  of  a  branch  of  the  U.S.  military  and  has  witnessed  Applicant’s  growth  “as  a
leader  and  innovator  in  increasingly  important  national  security  and  defense  issues.”
Applicant has always been focused on their mission and committed to operational security
practices.  He  believes  denying  Applicant’s  continued eligibility  for a  security  clearance
would be “a grave mistake and a significant setback to U.S. national security interests in
an  area  of emerging  importance.” (AE  F.)  Applicant  has  the  highest  reputation  among
their  very  broad  network  for  his  capabilities  and  contributions;  for  his  integrity  and
honesty; and for his ability to maintain a high level of security. (Tr. 160.) Applicant treats
his  work  “as  a  mission.”  (Tr.  162.)  He  does  not  believe  Applicant  would  be  subject  to
foreign influence. (Tr. 164-168.)
A friend of Applicant’s, who works as a subcontractor for Applicant’s employer, met
Applicant when they were both entrepreneurs. He has witnessed Applicant’s dedication
to his job and to America. In his experience, Applicant “firmly firewalls his professional
and  personal  lives.”  He  will  spend  nights  and  weekends  at  the  office  if  necessary.  He
attests that Applicant has expressed that he cannot and will not divulge information about
his work no matter the pressure. On travels together, Applicant has shared plenty about
11
his family with this friend, but nothing about his spouse’s family. This friend knows that
Applicant’s  in-laws  are  Chinese  and  that  it  is  “an  undeniable  fact  that  China  actively
engages  in  espionage  targeting  America  and  the  Department  of  Defense.”  Yet  he
wholeheartedly supports Applicant’s application for a security clearance. (AE H.)
A  consultant  in  national  security,  who  retired  in  October  2014  from  full-time
employment  as  president  and  chief  executive  officer  of  a  defense  contractor,  knows
Applicant through their fraternity. The consultant’s son was in the fraternity with Applicant,
and  the  consultant  was  an  active  alumnus.  Applicant  was  the  local  chapter’s  vice
president while an undergraduate, and he impressed the consultant with his leadership
ability. More recently, as president of the alumni house corporation, Applicant stepped up
to  help  the  chapter  recover  from  a  membership  crisis,  and  he  has  led  the  efforts  for
infrastructure improvements and renovations. Applicant has been “open and transparent
about [his spouse’s] Chinese heritage” and about her relatives. Based on his interactions
with  Applicant  and  knowledge  of  Applicant’s  background,  the  security  consultant  is
confident that Applicant is loyal to the United States and its security interests. (AE I.)
A  licensed  attorney,  who  attended  college  with  Applicant  and  joined  the  same
fraternity,  has  developed  a  close  friendship  with  Applicant  over  the  past  13  years.
Applicant discussed with him the possible effect that his marriage to a Chinese national
could have on his security clearance eligibility. This friend attests that Applicant married
“after  much  consideration  and  with  full  belief  that  he  could  undertake  both  without
adversely impairing either.” As a groomsman at Applicant’s wedding, this friend observed
Applicant  to  be  cordial  to  his  in-laws,  “who  strongly  considered  not  attending  the
wedding.” In  his observation,  Applicant  is extremely  close  to  his own  family,  and  he  is
“entrenched” in his community. This friend has no reservations about trusting Applicant
with the responsibilities of a security clearance. (AE J.)
Another of their fraternity brothers currently works as a mechanical engineer for a
defense  contractor.  This  friend  invested  in  Applicant’s  start-up  energy  company.  He
indicates that when Applicant closed the company, he paid back his investors because
he wanted to honor the trust that they had placed in him. He knows Applicant as someone
very conscious about his work and its sensitivity. He believes Applicant is a loyal citizen
of the United States who will place the interests of the United States first. (AE K.)
The president of the fraternity house corporation before Applicant has had limited
opportunities  to  interact  with  Applicant  and  his  spouse  socially.  In  his  contacts  with
Applicant through their fraternity, he has seen Applicant react calmly and thoughtfully in
stressful and sensitive situations. He does not believe that Applicant poses any threat to
the United States. (AE L.)
A  married  couple  with  whom  Applicant  and  his  spouse  share  a  friendship
“unequivocally pledge [their] support” of Applicant. He has given these friends no reason
to doubt his character or his loyalty. The female friend interacted with Applicant through
shared university alumni activities from 2005 to 2007.  Applicant became reacquainted
with her and met her husband in 2014, when he joined their weekly co-ed sports team.
The couple attended Applicant’s wedding and consider him to be a “loving husband and
a trustworthy friend.” (AE M.)
Applicant remains close to his family, although he has told them that if anything
improper were to occur involving them, all he could do is report it to the government. (Tr.
77.)  Applicant’s  mother,  sister,  maternal  grandparents,  and  maternal  uncles  favorably
endorse  his  character  and  reliability  and  confirm  Applicant’s  close  ties  to  the  United
States. Applicant’s mother, who works in the housekeeping business, indicates that her
son “does things by the book and doesn’t let anyone pressure him into decisions.” He has
high  morals,  and  she  has  no  doubt  that  he  is  a  loyal  U.S.  citizen.  She  knows  where
Applicant  is  employed  but  not  what  he  does  or  where  he  travels  for  work.  To  her
knowledge, Applicant has limited contact with his spouse’s family; his in-laws do not like
him; and they did not want the marriage. She regards Applicant’s spouse as a daughter
and part of their American family. (AE N.)
Applicant’s sister corroborates that Applicant’s spouse became part of their family
activities when she and Applicant were dating, and that his marriage has not changed his
core values of honesty and integrity. Applicant’s sister has always been able to trust him
to give her rational, helpful advice. She knows of no one more consistent and stable as
Applicant. He does not take his work lightly and has not shared the nature of his  work
with her. (AE Q.)
Applicant’s maternal grandparents expressed their pride in Applicant. They were
involved in raising him, including taking him to his sports games out of town. They knew
before  Applicant’s  wedding  that  there  was  some  tension  because  of  his  in-laws’
disapproval of the marriage, although “everyone got along fine during the wedding.” To
their  understanding,  Applicant’s  in-laws  play  “a  very  minor  role”  in  Applicant’s  and  his
spouse’s lives in the United States. (AE O.)
Applicant’s uncles have maintained a close relationship with Applicant even though
they live in another area of the country. In their experience, Applicant is  determined in
accomplishing his tasks and goals. Their family has adopted a policy of not asking him
about his work because he will not tell them. Applicant’s uncles found Applicant’s in-laws
to  be  courteous  and  polite  at  the  wedding,  despite  their  disapproval  of  the  marriage
because Applicant is not Chinese. Applicant’s uncles strongly doubt that there is anything
that Applicant’s in-laws could say to him that would dissuade him from doing what is right.
(AE P.)
Administrative Notice
After  reviewing  U.S.  government  publications  concerning  China  and  its  foreign
relations  and  mindful  of  my  obligation  to  consider  updated  information,  I  take
administrative notice of the facts requested by the Government as supplemented by the
following facts:
13
China is an authoritarian state with paramount authority vested in the CCP. CCP
members hold almost all top government and security apparatus positions. In all important
government, economic, and cultural institutions in China, the CCP ensures that party and
state policy guidance is followed. China considers the first 20 years of this century to be
a  window  of  strategic  opportunity  for  the  country  to  focus  on  economic  growth,
independent innovation, scientific and technical advancement, and growth in renewable
energy. China sees itself as a strategic competitor of the United States.
China  continues  to  pursue  a  long-term,  comprehensive  military  modernization
program, which it views as essential to achieving the “China Dream” of a powerful and
prosperous China. As of 2018, China was placing a growing emphasis on the importance
of  maritime  and  information  domains,  offensive  air  operations,  long-distance  mobility
operations,  and  space  and  cyber  operations.  China  is  one  of  the  most  aggressive
collectors  of  U.S.  economic  information  and  technology.  To  support  its  military
modernization, China fills the gaps in its defense and commercial research by engaging
in large-scale, state-sponsored theft of intellectual property and proprietary information.
In accord with its national security objective to leverage legally and illegally acquired dual-
use  and  military-related  technologies  to  its  advantage,  China  uses  its  intelligence
services, computer intrusions, and other illicit approaches to obtain national security and
export-controlled  technologies,  controlled  equipment,  and  other  materials.  China
leverages  foreign  investments,  commercial  joint  ventures,  academic  exchanges,  the
experience  of  Chinese  students  and  researchers,  and  state-sponsored  industrial  and
technical  espionage  to  increase  the  level  of  technologies  and  expertise  available  to
support its military research, development, and acquisition. China blends intelligence and
non-intelligence assets and frequently seeks to exploit Chinese citizens or persons with
family  ties  to  China  who  can  use  their  insider  access  to  steal  trade  secrets  from  U.S.
companies.
U.S.  corporations  and  cyber-security  specialists  continue  to  report  computer
network intrusions originating from Internet Protocol addresses in China. In March 2016,
a  Chinese  national plead  guilty  to  participating  in  a  conspiracy  between  approximately
October  2008  through  March  2014  to  hack  into  the  computer  networks  of  major  U.S.
defense contractors to steal sensitive military and export-controlled data for the benefit of
China. Some Chinese nationals in the United States have acted as procurement agents
or  intermediaries  to  obtain  key  national  security  and  export-restricted  technologies  or
controlled equipment for China in violation of U.S. laws and export controls. In June 2016,
a California resident was convicted of conspiring with a person in China to illegally acquire
and export to China fighter jet engines, an unmanned aerial vehicle, and related technical
data  to  China.  In  March  2017,  a  U.S.  State  Department  employee  with  a  Top  Secret
clearance  was  charged  with  making false  statements  to the  FBI for allegedly  failing  to
report her contacts with two Chinese foreign intelligence agents, who provided her with
thousands of dollars of gifts and benefits over a span of five years.
In June 2018, a former Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) officer, was arrested for
the  attempted  transmission  of  national  defense  information  to  China’s  intelligence
services and for acting as an unregistered foreign agent for China. Fluent in Mandarin
14
Chinese and Russian, he held a Top Secret clearance for several years. Between 2013
and  2017,  he  regularly  traveled  between  the  United  States  and  China  and  allegedly
provided information that he learned at military and intelligence conferences in the United
States to contacts in China associated with the country’s intelligence services. He also
allegedly  improperly  sold  export-controlled  technology  to  persons  in  China.  He  was
reportedly paid at least $800,000 for his activities on China’s behalf.
In another illustration of China targeting former and present U.S. security clearance
holders, in June 2018, a former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) case officer, who had
also worked for the DIA in the past, was convicted of espionage for transmitting classified
documents to an agent of the Chinese government. In September 2018, a Chinese citizen
living in Chicago was arrested for allegedly acting within the United States as an illegal
agent for China. According to the criminal complaint, the Chinese national came to the
United  States  on  a  student  visa  to  study  electrical  engineering  in  2013.  In  2016,  he
enlisted in the U.S. Army Reserves under a program authorizing the recruitment of legal
aliens with skills considered vital to the national interest, denying at that time that he had
any contact with a foreign government in the past seven years. He allegedly worked at
the direction of a high-level intelligence officer in a provincial department of the Ministry
of State Security for the PRC. In October 2018, a Chinese intelligence officer was charged
with economic espionage involving the theft of trade secrets from multiple U.S. aviation
and  aerospace  companies.  In  a  separate  case,  two  Chinese  intelligence  officers  who
worked for a provincial foreign intelligence arm of China’s Ministry of State Security and
their team of hackers were charged in October 2018 with conspiracy to steal technology
underlying a turbofan engine used in U.S. and European commercial airlines. The criminal
computer  intrusions  reportedly  targeted  several  private  companies  and  persisted
between January 2010 and May 2015. In reporting the charges, the FBI noted that “the
threat posed by Chinese government-sponsored hacking activity is real and relentless.”
China  has  a  poor  human  rights  record.  The  government  was  responsible  for
significant human rights issues in 2017, including arbitrary or unlawful deprivation of life
and  executions  without  due  process;  forced  disappearances;  torture  and  coerced
confessions  of  prisoners;  arbitrary  and  illegal  detentions;  restrictions  on  freedom  of
speech,  press,  assembly,  association,  religion,  and  travel;  harassment  of  journalists,
lawyers, writers, dissidents, and others; censorship and tight control of public discourse
on  the  Internet,  in  the  print,  and  other  media;  inability  of  citizens  to  choose  their
government; corruption; severe repression of human rights organizations and individuals;
severe  labor  restrictions;  and  a  coercive  birth-limitation  policy.  The  CCP  continued  to
dominate the judiciary and controlled the appointment of judges. In some cases, the CCP
directly dictated court rulings.
The U.S. State Department advises visitors to China to exercise increased caution
due to arbitrary enforcement of local laws as well as special restrictions on U.S.-Chinese
nationals. Chinese authorities have asserted broad authority to prohibit U.S. citizens from
leaving  China  by  using  exit  bans  coercively  to  compel  U.S.  citizens  to  participate  in
Chinese government investigations; to lure individuals back to China from abroad; and to
aid Chinese authorities in resolving civil disputes in favor of Chinese parties. The State
15
Department  warns  that  U.S.  citizens may  be  detained  in  China  without  access  to  U.S.
consular services, and they may be subjected to prolonged interrogation and extended
detention for reasons related to “state security.” China does not recognize dual nationality
and  U.S.-Chinese  citizens  and  U.S.  citizens  of  Chinese  heritage  may  be  subject  to
additional scrutiny and harassment. Visitors are required to register with the police within
24 hours of arrival in the country and failure to do so could result in fines and deportation.
Foreign visitors in China may be placed under surveillance by security personnel; their
hotel rooms, telephones, and facsimile machines may be monitored; and their personal
possessions, including computers, may be searched without their knowledge or consent.

"The  SOR  alleges  foreign  influence  by  Applicant  because  his  immediate  family
members are citizens and residents of Kenya (SOR 1.a-1.g). Applicant’s ownership of a
home in Kenya (SOR 1.f) and the financial support he has provided to family members
in Kenya, and will provide in the future (SOR 1.g), raises additional concerns under the
foreign influence guideline. Applicant admitted all allegations.
Applicant,  born  in  Kenya  in  1979,  is  40  years  old  and  has  been  married  since
September  2006.  He  has  five  children  whose  ages  are  13,  10,  8,  and  6  years  of  age
(twins). In May 2006, he received a bachelor’s degree in computer science from another
African  country.  In  December  2015,  he  earned  a  master’s  degree  in  information
technology  from  an  American  university.  Applicant  immigrated  to  the  United  States  in
December 2009. He was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in March 2015. His wife was born
in Kenya in 1981. She is also a naturalized U.S. citizen. (Item 4 at 4 at 7-18, 19-20, 26,
67; Item 5 at 5; item 6 at 4-5)
Applicant  is  a  dual  citizen  of  the  U.S.  and  Kenya.  He  has  both  a  U.S.  passport
and  a  Kenyan  passport  that  is  not  scheduled  to  expire  until  January  2022.  He  has
expressed  his  intention  to  renounce  his  Kenyan  citizenship,  but  is  waiting  for the  U.S.
Government or his security clearance sponsor to instruct him to carry out his intention.
He  is  unable  to  begin  working  as  a  linguist  until  his  security  clearance  is  approved.
Applicant is currently working as a part-time taxi driver. From 2010 to September 2017,
he was employed as a business analyst for a business process company. He has never
had a security clearance. He has owned his American home since June 2017. (Item 4 at
4 at 7-18, 19-20, 26, 67; Item 5 at 5; item 6 at 4-5)
Before immigrating to the United States in December 2009, Applicant lived with
his wife, a former Kenyan air force officer, on a Kenyan air force base from November
2007 to about June 2008. His wife resigned honorably from the military and they moved
to  a  location  near  the  base  until  they  immigrated  to  the  United  States  in  December
2009. There is no indication in the record of his wife’s military position or how long she
was  in  the  military,  or  whether  she  receives  a  military  pension.  She  currently  is
employed  as  a  para  professional  for  a  public  school  system.  (Though  the  wife  is
unalleged in the SOR, evidence regarding her status will be presented under the whole-
person concept below.) (Item 4 at 4 at 7-18, 26, 67; Item 5 at 5; item 6 at 4-5, 16)
Applicant  stated  that  he  and  his  wife  send  money  to  her  mother  (SOR  1.e)  to
help  pay  monthly  bills.  They  send  money  to  help  her  father  (SOR  1.e)  fix  his  farm
machines. (Item 5 at 7-8, 10)
SOR 1.a – Applicant has four brothers who are citizens and residents of Kenya.
His 39-year-old brother works in a hardware store. Applicant’s 34-year-old brother is a
Kenyan  government  police  officer,  and  guards  diplomatic  aircraft.  Neither  Applicant’s
23-year-old  brother  nor  his  19-year-old  brother  have  ever  worked.  The  34-year-old
brother  is  the  only  sibling  affiliated  with  the  Kenyan  government  or  military.  (Item  4  at
34-47)
SOR  1.b  –  Applicant  has  four  sisters  who  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Kenya.
His 36-year-old sister, his 32-year-old sister, and his 29-year-old sister are housewives.
Applicant’s 20-year-old sister is unemployed. None of his four sisters are affiliated with
the Kenyan government or military. (Item 4 at 37-41)
SOR  1.c  –  Applicant’s  fifth  brother,  26  years  old,  is  a  citizen  of  Kenya  and  a
resident  of  Saudi  Arabia  where  he  is  attending  school.  Applicant  contacts  all  siblings
about once or twice a week through a cell phone application. (Item 4 at 44; Item 5 at 5-
7)
SOR  1.d  –  Applicant’s  sister-in-law,  35  years  old,  is  a  citizen  and  resident  of
Kenya.  She  is  a  housewife  with  no  affiliation  with  the  Kenyan  government  or  military.
Applicant has monthly contact with her. The mode of contact is not identified.
Applicant’s brother-in-law, 44 years old, is a citizen and resident of Kenya. He is
a  project  officer  for  an  international  emergency  and  relief  organization.  Applicant  has
monthly contact with him. The type of contact is not identified. (Item 6 at 5)
SOR 1.e – Applicant’s mother-in-law, 67 years old and a citizen and resident of
Kenya,  is  a  housewife  with  no  affiliation  with  the  Kenyan  government  or  military.
Applicant’s  father-in-law,  72  years  old,  a  citizen  and  resident  of  Kenya,  is  a  self-
employed farmer with no ties to the Kenyan government or military. Applicant’s contact
with  both  in-laws  is  monthly,  though  the  kind  of  contact  is  not  identified.  (Item  6  at  4;
December 2018 answer to SOR)
SOR 1.f – Applicant owns a home in Kenya valued at approximately $30,000. His
parents, living with Applicant as permanent residents of the U.S. since September 2017,
did  not  want  to  own  the  Kenyan  home  because  of  potential  inheritance  issues  with
Applicant’s siblings on their death. Applicant, his parents, and his children use the home
instead  of  hotels  for  accommodations  when  they  are  in  Kenya  on  vacation  or  while
visiting relatives. (Item 5 at 9; item 6 at 12; December 2018 answer to SOR)
SOR  1.g  –  Between  2010  and  2017,  Applicant  provided approximately  $32,450
in financial support to his family who are citizen residents of Kenya. Applicant plans to
continue  with  financial  support  in  the  future  to  at  least  13  foreign  family  members.  He
provides  specific  amounts  of  money  to  them  to  pay  for  their  food,  rent,  medical  bills,
schooling, and emergencies. (Item 5 at 11-12; Item 6 at 10-12; December 2018 answer
to SOR)
Applicant
indicated  during  his  counterintelligence  screening  questionnaire
interview in November 2017 that he never served in a foreign military service. He never
provided  material  or  financial  support  to  any  organization  seeking  to  harm  the  United
States, and was never threatened with blackmail or pressure. He averred that he would
never betray the United States. (Item 6 at 5-15)
Since immigrating to the United States in  December 2009, Applicant traveled to
Kenya  on  five  occasions.  In  2015,  he  stayed  in  Kenya  for  four  months  visiting  his
parents who were ill. He made four shorter trips between February 2016 and September
2017 to visit them.
Administrative Notice - Kenya
The  Kenyan  republic  has  three  branches  of  government:  (1)  a  directly  elected
president; (2) a two-tier legislature consisting of a Senate and a National Assembly; and
(3) a  judiciary.  The  United  States  and  Kenya  have  been  partners in  the  global war on
terrorism.
The  U.S.  State  Department  advises  extreme  caution  when  traveling  throughout
Kenya  because  of  crime  and  terrorism.  Terrorist  acts  could  occur  by  assault,  suicide
operations, bomb and  grenade attacks,  or kidnappings.  On  March  29, 2018, the  State
Department provided an advisory not to travel in the Kenya-Somalia border region due
to  acts  of  terrorism  committed  by  the  al-Shabaab  terrorist  faction.  There  were  23
terrorist  attacks  in  the  country  in  2017,  resulting  in  80  fatalities.  The  U.S.  government
receives  ongoing  information  about  terrorism  threats  directed  at  U.S.,  Western,  and
Kenyan entities.
Human  rights  problems  continue  to  plague  Kenya.  These  issues  manifest
themselves  in  unlawful  and  politically  motivated  killings,  disappearances  occurring
under  force,  torture,  life-threatening  prison  conditions,  arbitrary  arrest  and  detention,
restrictions on freedom of the press and assembly, and violence against women.

"Applicant  admitted  the  SOR  allegations  in  ¶¶  1.b  and  1.c.  He  denied  the  SOR
allegations in ¶¶ 1.a and 2.a. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and
exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  34  years  old.  He  was  born  in  Afghanistan.  He  entered  the  United
States  in  2008.  He  became  a  naturalized  citizen  in  October  2013.  In  1998,  prior  to
immigrating to the United States, he moved with his father and brother from Afghanistan
to Uzbekistan because his father feared for his family’s safety. At that time, his mother
and sisters moved to Iran where his mother’s parents lived. Applicant lived in Uzbekistan
with his father and brothers until their refugee status was approved in 2008. He lived with
his mother in Iran for approximately six months while awaiting refugee status. Applicant
is unmarried and has no children. (Items 3, 4, 5)
From December 2011 to June 2012, Applicant worked as an interpreter with U.S.
forces in Afghanistan. Previous to this, he worked for federal contractors in the United
States, as a role player and cultural advisor with U.S. forces preparing for deployment to
the Middle East. From July 2012 to January 2018, he worked for a federal contractor as
an  interpreter.  Applicant  provided  several  certificates  of  appreciation  and  achievement
from the military units he supported. (Item 2)
At  the  time  Applicant  submitted  his  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  in
February 2018, his mother and two sisters were living in Iran. Applicant and his father
and brother were living in the United States. His mother has since moved to the United
States  and  obtained  a  permanent  resident  card  in  August  2018.  His  sisters,  who  are
citizens of Afghanistan, have married and live in Iran with their families. During his March
2018 background interview, Applicant stated that he had weekly telephone contact with
his sisters.
Applicant traveled to Iran in 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017, to visit his
family members living there. On each visit, Applicant obtained visas to enter Iran by the
use  of  his Afghanistan  passport.  He  traveled  back  to  the  United  States  using  his  U.S.
passport. He has a cousin with whom he maintains contact who is a citizen and resident
of Afghanistan. On several occasions, Applicant used his cousin as an intermediary to
send money to his mother when she lived in Iran. He would send his cousin the money,
and he would then transfer the money to Applicant’s mother in Iran. (Item 4)
In his February 2018 SCA, Applicant disclosed that in the past seven years, he
used marijuana. He stated: “I used it as a recreation purpose on occasions.” He noted he
used it from January 2012 to November 2017. He further stated that he used it: “Once
every three months on average for a total approximate use of 15 times.” Regarding his
future  intention  to  use  a  controlled  substance,  he  said:  “I  am  planning  to  work  as  a
Contract Linguist directly working with the US military. Therefore, I decided to never use
it again.” (Item 3)
In  Applicant’s  February  2018  Counterintelligence  Focused  Security  Screening
Questionnaire (CFSSQ), he was asked to describe his current and past drug usage. He
responded: “Marijuana I used three months ago. I’ve done it maybe 10 or 15 times in my
life.” Applicant told the interviewer that he used marijuana with various acquaintances and
co-workers. He said that he smoked marijuana with co-workers and role players in the
United  States  at  different  job  locations  when  he  was  a  role  player  or  interpreter.  The
marijuana  was  provided  by  other  role  players  or  acquaintances.  Applicant  told  the
interviewer that his last marijuana use was in approximately October 2017, and he did not
intend to use it again. (Item 4)
In Applicant’s March 2018 background interview, he disclosed to the investigator
that in 2015 he began to smoke marijuana. He estimated he used it about 16 times for
experimental purposes. He said he used it with two friends that he met through mutual
friends and people he met through rotations he had with an employer. He disclosed he
worked  for  this  employer  as  an  interpreter  from  July  2012  to  January  2018.  He  used
marijuana either at his friend’s house or at his own house. He told the investigator that he
did  not  intend  to  use  it  in  the  future  because  he  wanted  to  get  a  job  with  a  federal
contractor. (Items 3, 5)
In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  denied  ¶  2.a,  which  alleged:  “You  used
marijuana from approximately January 2012 to January 2018.” He stated in his response:
“I told the officer that was interviewing me that I have used marijuana only 3 times in my
life.” (Item 2)1
1  Any  derogatory  information  that  was  not  alleged  in  the  SOR  will  not  be  considered  for  disqualifying
purposes, but may be considered when making a credibility determination, in the application of mitigating
conditions, and in the whole-person analysis.
Afghanistan
The United States Department of State’s travel warning for Afghanistan remains in
effect and it warns U.S. citizens against travel there because of continued instability and
threats by terrorist organizations against U.S. citizens. Travel is unsafe due to ongoing
risks  of  kidnapping,  hostage-taking,  military  combat  operations,  and  armed  rivalry
between  political  and  tribal  groups,  militant  attacks,  suicide  bombings,  and  insurgent
attacks.  These  attacks  may  also  target  Afghan  and  U.S.  Government  convoys  and
compounds, foreign embassies, military installations, and other public areas.
Extremists associated with various Taliban networks, the Islamic State in Iraq and
Syria (ISIS), and members of other armed opposition groups are active throughout the
country.  These  terrorist  groups  routinely  attack  Afghan  and  coalition  forces,  and  U.S.
targets  with  little  regard  for  or  the  express  intent  to  cause  civilian  casualties.  Due  to
security concerns, unofficial travel to Afghanistan by U.S. Government employees and
their family members is restricted and requires prior approval from the State Department.
Afghanistan  continues  to  experience  aggressive  and  coordinated  attacks  by
different terrorist groups. These groups remain active and were able to conduct a number
of high-profile, mass-casualty attacks in Kabul against sectarian and Afghan government
targets. They continue to plan such attacks against U.S. and coalition forces and Afghan
interests. Border regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan remain safe havens for terrorists.
The Afghan government struggles to assert control over this remote region.
According  to  a  June  2017  U.S.  Department  of  Defense  report  on  Afghanistan,
Afghanistan faces a continuing threat from as many as 20 insurgent and terrorist networks
present  and  operating  in  the  Afghanistan-Pakistan  region,  in  what  is  the  highest
concentration of extremist and terrorist groups in the world.
The State Department’s report on human rights for Afghanistan notes there was
widespread violence, including indiscriminate attacks on civilians and killings of persons
affiliated with the government by armed insurgent groups, widespread disregard for the
rule of law and little accountability for those who committed human rights abuses. There
was also targeted violence and endemic societal discrimination against women and girls.
Afghanistan remains an important partner of the United States in the fight against
terrorism,  working  with  the  U.S.  to  eliminate  terrorist  groups.  The  U.S.  Government
continues  to  invest  resources  to  help  Afghanistan  improve  its  security,  governance,
institutions, and economy. The U.S. Government has a strong bilateral partnership with
the Afghan government. (Item 7)
Iran
Iran has been designated as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1984. It remains
the most prominent state sponsor of terrorism, providing financial aid, advanced weapons
and  tactics,  and  direction  to  militant  and  terrorist  groups  across  the  Middle  East.  It
cultivates  operatives  across  the  globe  as  a  contingency  to  enable  potential  terrorist
attacks.
Iran  uses  terrorist  groups  to  implement  foreign  policy  goals,  provide  cover  for
intelligence operations, and create instability in the Middle East. It remains an enduring
threat  to  the  U.S.  national  interests.  Iran  and  its  primary  terrorism  partners  pose  a
persistent threat to the United States and its allies worldwide. The U.S. Government does
not have diplomatic ties or consular relations with Iran. The Department of State warns
U.S. citizens not to travel to Iran due to the risk of arbitrary arrest and detention.
Iran continues to leverage cyber espionage, propaganda, and attacks to support
its  security  priorities,  influence  events  and  foreign  perceptions,  and  counter  threats,
including against U.S. allies in the region. The U.S. Director of National Intelligence (DNI)
has identified several countries, including Iran as posing a significant cyber threat against
the United States. The DNI specifically noted that Iran will continue to penetrate U.S. and
allied networks for espionage and to position itself for potential cyber-attacks. There is
also  concern  that  Iran  will  expand  its  influence  in  the  region  and  will  develop  military
capabilities that threaten U.S. forces.
In 2015, the Visa Waiver Program was amended. Under the amendment, citizens
of Iran, Iraq, Sudan, and Syria are ineligible to travel or be admitted to the United States.
The exclusion of these countries from waiver eligibility reflects: that the presence of an
individual from that country increases the likelihood that the individual is a credible threat
to  the  national security  of  the  United  States:  that  a foreign  terrorist  organization  has a
significant presence in the country; or that the country is a safe haven for terrorists.
Iran has a poor human rights record. There are severe restrictions on civil liberties,
including  freedom  of  assembly,  association,  speech,  religion,  and  the  press.  Other
problems include abuse of due process, combined with the use of capital punishment for
crimes  that  do  not  meet  requirements  for  due  process,  as  well  as  cruel,  inhuman,  or
degrading treatment and punishment; and disregard for the physical integrity of persons,
whom  authorities  arbitrarily  and  unlawfully  detained,  tortured,  or  killed.  There  are
numerous other human rights problems in Iran. (Item 6)

"Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.c through 1.e, and 2.a. He denied
the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 2.b. After a thorough and careful review of the
pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 39 years old. He was born in Iraq and earned a college degree there
in 2003. He married his wife, an Iraqi citizen, in 2012. They have five young children. It is
unknown  where  his  eldest  child  was  born.  His  four  younger  children  were  born  in  the
United States. He is presently seeking employment with a federal contractor.1
Applicant worked for a U.S. contractor in Iraq from 2003 to 2006. In January 2010,
he was granted a special immigration visa and immigrated to the United States. In his
September 2017 Questionnaire for National Security Position (SF 86), he disclosed that
he lived in the United States from 2010 to April 2016. He traveled back and forth to Iraq
numerous times during this period. Applicant became a naturalized citizen of the United
States in April 2016 and obtained a U.S. passport the same month. He then moved back
to Iraq in April 2016. Applicant also disclosed that he still held an Iraqi passport (which
will  expire  in  2022)  that  he  intended  to  relinquish  to  his  employer  after  his
counterintelligence screening interview (CSI). He stated in his SF 86: “After gaining my
U.S.  citizen[ship]  in  May  2016,  I  have  no  use  for  the  passport  and  will  relinquish  to
[prospective  employer]  as  I  have  renounced  the  Iraqi  citizenship  at  the  Naturalization
1 Item 3; AE A.
Ceremony.”2 In February 2018, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator.
Noted  in  the  report  was  Applicant’s  foreign  travel  and  date  stamps  in  both  his  U.S.
passport and Iraqi passport. His Iraqi passport has entrance to Iraq stamps on May 2016,
July 2016, February 2017; October 2017, and November 2017, subsequent to becoming
a U.S. citizen.3
Applicant returned to the United States for a week in September 2017, and again
in approximately October to November 2017, to process his wife and son’s immigration
paperwork and for an interview. He then returned to Iraq and lived there from November
2017 to February 2018.4
Applicant  disclosed  on  his  September  2017 SF  86  that his  wife  is  a  citizen  and
resident of Iraq. During Applicant’s February 2018 CSI interview, he told the interviewer
that  he  moved  back  to  Iraq  because  his  wife  and  son  wanted  to  because  the  cultural
changes were tough on them. He said he would move back to the U.S., but wanted to
give his wife some more time before making the move back. In his CSI documents, he
confirmed at that time that his wife was a citizen and resident of Iraq. Applicant indicated
in his November 2018 answer to the SOR that his wife is a permanent resident of the
United States, and that she resided in Iraq. He said his son was a U.S. citizen residing in
Iraq. Applicant said in his February 2019 FORM response that his wife was living in the
United States. It is unknown when she moved back, and what her intentions are regarding
remaining in the United States. Applicant did not provide information as to when his wife
became a permanent resident and when his son became a U.S. citizen. He did not provide
corroborating documents as to their status.5
Applicant’s mother and two brothers are citizens and residents of Iraq. In his CSI
documents, he disclosed his mother is a homemaker. One brother is an assistant teacher
and the other is self-employed and has a cosmetic store.6
Applicant disclosed during his February 2018 background interview that his family
in Iraq is very wealthy, and he receives approximately $20,000 every two to six months
for  living  expenses.  He  has  received  money  transfers  since  2012  when  he  married.
Applicant has a saving and checking account with a U.S. bank that has a balance of about
$5,500.  He  also  has  an  Iraqi  bank  account  that he uses to  transfer  money  to  his  U.S.
accounts.  He  told  the  investigator  that  he  had  transferred  $10,000  from  his  Iraqi  bank
account to his U.S. account when he was in Iraq. The funds were from rent payments
from the various rental properties he owns.7

he disclosed on his SF 86.

Applicant disclosed that he owns a residence in Iraq where his immediate family
resides, and it is paid for in full. He purchased it in 2013 for his family and intended on
keeping it for when he visits Iraq. When interviewed for his CSI, he estimated its value at
$120,000.  In  his  SOR  answer,  he  indicated  that  its  value  depends  on  the  real  estate
market, so it could be valued less.8
Applicant co-owns with his mother and brothers a commercial property that has 10
apartment units. The apartments are rented, and he receives approximately $800 a month
in revenue. He referred to this as residual income. He estimated the property is valued at
approximately  $500,000.  He  inherited  the  property  when  his  father  passed  away  in
January 2018.9
Applicant co-owns with his mother and brothers a three-building compound. His
mother and brothers live in one residence, and they rent the other two residences. They
receive  rental  income  of  approximately  $1,800  monthly.  The  compound  is  valued  at
approximately $2,500,000.10
Applicant disclosed that from 2007 to 2009, he was employed full time by an Iraqi
company. He told the government investigator that he was still employed by the same
employer, and he provides services at least once a quarter or as needed. He provided
his services both electronically and in person. He completes about five to six tasks for the
company per year and receives approximately $25,000 in cash compensation annually.11
Applicant disclosed that he was employed by a consulting company in Iraq from
April 2016 to the present on a part-time basis. He is compensated about $2,000 a month
for his services. He worked from April 2016 to August 2017 for the company while in Iraq.
From  August  2017  until  at  least  the  date  of  his  interview  in  February  2018,  he  was
employed by the company and provided services electronically and in-person. Applicant
disclosed that while living in the U.S., he was self-employed from January 2010 to April
2016.  He  had  various  commercial  jobs  and  a  business  where  he  purchased  and  sold
furniture. He completed these duties from home. He did not have a license or pay taxes
for his jobs in the U.S. He was paid in cash.12

person analysis.

12 Items 3, 4, 5.
Applicant also told the government investigator that he was unemployed from April
2012  to  April  2016.13  He  filed  past  federal  income  tax  returns  in  2015  and  learned  he
owed $20,000 in federal taxes. In his SOR answer, he admitted he failed to timely file his
2011,  2012,  2013,  and  2014  federal  income  tax  returns.  He  said  he  made  payment
arrangements with the IRS and had an installment agreement to pay $230 a month. He
was questioned as to why with his financial resources he did not pay the whole amount
owed. He told the investigator he preferred the settlement agreement.14
In his  answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  stated  that  the  $16,000 federal  income  tax
debt was reduced to $9,396. He provided copies of IRS transcripts from November 2018.
They confirm that he filed his 2014 federal income tax return in April 2015.15 He provided
a transcript for tax year 2010, which is not alleged.16 He also provided 2011 and 2012
transcripts that show he filed these tax year returns in August 2015. As of the date of the
transcripts, the balances owed were $420 for 2010; $4,589 for 2011, and $4,846 for 2012.
Applicant  did  not  provide  a  tax  transcript  for  2013.  The  transcripts  also  reflect  that
Applicant  entered  into  an  installment  agreement  with  the  IRS  in  2015,  and  he  made
inconsistent payments through 2018. His 2014 transcript reflects some payments were
redirect to his 2010 tax liability. The transcripts also reflect that tax years 2011 and 2012
were no longer in an installment agreement.17
In  his  FORM  response,  Applicant  provided  a  document  from  the  IRS  from
December  2018.  It  stated  that  the  IRS  had  accepted  an  installment  agreement  from
Applicant to pay $230 monthly. It reflected it included tax years 2010, 2011, 2012, and
2014. Also provided was proof of a payment made to the IRS in December 2018 for $230.
Applicant stated in his response that his tax-debt balance was now approximately $2,739
because he was owed a refund of $6,090 for tax year 2018 that was applied to his tax
balance.  Applicant  did  not  provide  corroborating  documents  to  show  his  current  tax
balance.18

The United States Department of State warns that U.S. citizens in Iraq remain at
high risk for kidnapping and terrorist violence and to avoid all travel to Iraq. The ability of
the  U.S.  Embassy  to  provide  consular  services  to  U.S.  citizens  outside  Baghdad  is

extremely  limited  given  the  security  environment.  The  Islamic  State  of  Iraq  and  Syria
(ISIS) controls a significant portion of Iraq’s territory. Within areas under ISIS control, the
Iraqi government has little or no ability to control and ensure public safety.
Numerous terrorist and insurgent groups are active in Iraq, including ISIS. Such
groups regularly attack both Iraqi security forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias
may  also  threaten  U.S.  citizens  and  western  companies  throughout  Iraq.  U.S.
Government and western interests remain possible targets for attacks.
The  U.S.  Government  considers  the  potential  personal  security  threats  to  U.S.
government personnel in Iraq to be serious enough to require them to live and work under
strict security guidelines.
There are significant human rights problems in Iraq to include: sectarian hostility,
widespread corruption, lack of transparency at all levels of government and society that
have  weakened  the  government’s  authority  and  worsened  effective  human  rights
protections.  Iraqi  security  forces  and  members  of  the  Federal  Police  have  committed
human rights violations to include killing, kidnapping, and extorting civilians. ISIS is also
responsible for human rights abuses. There are also problems that include harsh and life-
threatening  conditions  in  detention  and  prison  facilities,  arbitrary  arrest  and  lengthy
pretrial detainment, denial of fair public trial, limits on freedom of expression, freedom of
the  press,  censorship  of  religion,  limits  on  peaceful  assembly,  and  societal  abuses  of
women.

"Applicant  admitted  each  of  the  allegations  in  the  SOR.    After  a  thorough  and
careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of
fact.
Applicant  is  32  years  old  and  is  married  to  a  registered  foreign  national  from
Russia.    He  has  a  Bachelor’s  of  Science  degree  in  Mechanical  Engineering.
(Applicant’s  Exhibit  G.)    He  holds  the  position  of  Program  Manager  with  a  defense
contractor.  Applicant has never held a security clearance before.  He began working for
his current employer in 2016.
Applicant is a native-born U.S. citizen, who was born on a U.S. Air Force Base.
His parents, both his father and step-mother, are native-American citizens, who served
in the U.S. Air Force while Applicant was growing up.  As a “military brat”, Applicant has
traveled with his parents to a variety of duty stations around the world on military work
assignments.
Applicant’s  step-mother  served  in  the  U.S.  Air  Force  for  twenty-three  years
before  she  retired  in  2009.    Applicant’s  father  served  twenty  years  until  he  retired  in
2001.    Both his father and  step-mother currently  work for government  contractors and
hold SCI-level clearances.
Applicant  met  a  woman  in  Beijing,  China,  who  later  became  his  wife,  while
working as a traveling engineer for a U.S. company.  She was a Russian national who
was  in  China  working  on  her  Master’s  degree  in  Linguistics,  and  studying  Chinese.
Applicant  explained  that  they  really  hit  it  off,  spent  time  together  and  worked  on  their
relationship  after  that.    (Tr.  p.  33.)    Applicant  and  his  wife  were  married  in  February
2016, and they have known each other for seven years.  She will be applying for her full
U.S. citizenship by the end of May 2019.  Applicant’s wife works as a paralegal for a law
firm, where she has worked for the past two years.  (Tr. pp. 44-45).
Applicant’s  father-in-law  and  mother-law  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Russia.
His  father-in-law  served  as  a  Major  in  the  Russian  military.    His  job  centered  around
food  service,  and  he  stayed  in  longer  than  required  in  order  to  receive  educational
benefits.  (Tr. p. 37.)  He left the military in 2000 and he has not been involved with the
Russian  Government  in  any  capacity  since  then.    Applicant  has  met  him  on  two
occasions.  He does not speak English and Applicant does not speak Russian and so
communication is difficult.  Applicant has no future plans to return to Russia.  (Tr. p. 39.)
He  has  no  details  concerning  Applicant’s  employment  nor  has  he  even  shown  an
interest.
Applicant’s mother-in-law also served in the Russian military from 1990 to 1994
in  order  to  obtain  educational  benefits.    While  in  the  military,  she  served  as  an
administrative  assistant.    She  currently  works  as  an  Engineer.    Applicant  does  not
believe the company is associated with the Russian Government in in any capacity.  (Tr.
p. 41.)  Applicant’s mother in law does not speak English and is unable to communicate
with the Applicant.  She has no details concerning Applicant’s employment.
In June 2014, on a trip to Moscow to visit his wife, in a passing social situation,
Applicant  was  introduced  to  two  friends  of  Applicant’s  wife  who  are  citizens  and
residents of Russia.  They are not friends of the Applicant.  Applicant does not talk with
them  and  has  no  contact  with  them.    One  of  the  women  was  employed  as  an
administrative  assistance  for  the  Russian  Government  and  was  a  friend  of  Applicant’s
wife,  but  they  had  a  falling  out  and  are  no  longer  friends.    Applicant’s  wife  no  longer
speaks with her.  The other woman, a friend of Applicant’s wife, is currently studying in
China  for  her  own  Master’s  degree.    Applicant’s  wife  no  longer  has  contact  with  her.
(Tr. p. 44.)
Applicant testified that he understands his responsibility while holding a security

any circumstances.  Applicant further stated that if he were placed in a situation where a
foreign national was attempting to get information from him that he knew they were not
entitled to, or that he should not be sharing, he would immediately report the contact to
his security officer.  (Tr. p. 45.)
Applicant’s  father,  who  holds  a  security  clearance,  testified  that  Applicant  is
trustworthy and responsible, and will not let his relationship with his wife or in-laws ever
influence his dedication and loyalties to the United States.  His father also states that he
and his company security officer are cognizant of the Russian foreign contact concern in
his family, and regularly monitors the situation to ensure that no security risk exists.  (Tr.
pp. 22- 31.)
Letters  of  recommendation  from  professional  colleagues  and  friends  of  the
Applicant attest to his professional behavior, strong work ethics, leadership skills, good
moral character, honesty, trustworthiness and reliability.  He is considered to be a stellar
employee and a valuable team member.  (Applicant’s Exhibit A.)
Applicant’s  performance  review  for  the  period  from  2017  and  2018  reflects  that
he “exceeds” job requirements.  (Applicant’s Exhibit E).  While a student at a University,
Applicant’s technical paper was published online in 2011.  (Applicant’s Exhibit D.)
I  have  taken  administrative  notice  of  the  following  facts  about  the  Russian
Federation, also known as Russia.  Russia is one of the most aggressive, capable, and
active, high risk locations for crime that affects the U.S. government interests.  Russian
intelligence  works  diligently  as  collectors  of  sensitive  U.S.  technologies.    Not  all
countries seek unauthorized access to classified information in order to harm the United
States.  Some countries seek such unauthorized access in order to reap the benefits of
sensitive  U.S  technology  for  themselves.    Russia  uses  cyber  operations  as  an
instrument  of  intelligence  collection  to  inform  its  decision-making  and  benefit  its
economic interests and Russian intelligence services have conducted sophisticated and
large-scale  hacking  operations  to  collect  sensitive  U.S.  business  and  technology
information.    Other  methods  of  collection  include,  Russian  commercial  and  academic
enterprises interacting with the West; recruitment of Russian immigrants with advanced
technical  skills  by
intelligence
penetration of public and private enterprises, which enable the Russian government to
obtain  sensitive  technical  information  from  industry.    The  areas  of  highest  interest  to
Russian
include  energy/alternative  energy;  biotechnology;
defense technology; environmental protection; high-end manufacturing; and information
and communications technology.  (Government Exhibit 3.)
intelligence  services;  and  Russian

the  Russian
Russia’s recently reported efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. Presidential election
represent the most recent expression of Russia’s long standing desire to undermine the
U.S.  led  liberal  democratic  order  and  it  is  noted  that  “these  activities  demonstrated  a
significant  escalation  in  directness,  level  of  activity,  and  scope  of  effort  compared  to
previous  operations.”  The  2016  influence  campaign  reflected  Russian’s recognition  of
the  worldwide  effects  that  mass disclosure  of  U.S.  Government and  other  private data
has  achieved  in  recent  years.    Russia  is  continuing  to  develop  capabilities  to  provide
President Putin with options to use against the United States.  (Government Exhibit 3.)
Human  rights  issues  continue  to  be  a  significant  problem  including  extrajudicial
killings; enforced disappearance; torture that was systematic and sometimes resulted in
death  and  sometimes  included  punitive  psychiatric  incarcerations;  harsh  and  life-
threatening  conditions  in  prisons;  arbitrary  arrest  and  detention;  lack  of  judicial
independence;  political  prisoners;  severe  interference  with  privacy;  severe  restrictions
on freedom of expression and the media; increasingly severe restriction on freedom of
association, including laws on “foreign agents” and “undesirable foreign  organizations”;
and widespread corruption at all levels and in all branches of government.  The Russian
government  failed  to  take  adequate  steps  to  prosecute  or  punish  most  officials  who
committed abuses, resulting in a climate of impunity.  (Government Exhibit 3.)

"In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  denied  the  SOR  allegations.  After  a
thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the
following additional findings of fact.
The  SOR  alleged  Applicant’s  father  and  mother  are  citizens  and  residents  of
Russia. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.b).
Applicant is 46 years old. He was born in Russia in 1972. He immigrated to the
United States in February 1997.  He received permanent resident alien status and then
became a naturalized U.S. citizen in June 2006. He has worked for a federal contractor
since January 2008. He is married for the second time. His wife is a dual citizen of the
United States and Moldova. His former spouse was a dual citizen  of the United States
and Belarus. He has two minor children who are native-born U.S.  citizens. He owns  a
home in the United States, but no further details are included in the record.3

administrative notice).
3 Items 3, 5.
Applicant remains a dual citizen of the United States and Russia. He looked into
renouncing  his  Russian  citizenship,  but  declined  to  pursue  that  effort  because  of  the
amount  of  time  it  would  take  him  to  do  so.  He  offered  that  he  would  do  so  if  it  was
required  of  him.  He  previously  held  a  Russian  passport,  which  expired  in  2008.  He
currently possesses a U.S. passport issued in 2016. Because Applicant chose to have
his  case  decided  based  solely  on  the  written  record,  I  was  unable  to  judge  his
demeanor and credibility in reaching this decision.4
Foreign Influence
Applicant has the following relatives who are residents and citizens of Russia:
1.  His  mother.  His  mother  is  78  years  old.  She  is  retired  from  her  position  at  a
hospital. She is not affiliated with the government or the military. Applicant is very close
to his mother and tries to have weekly telephone contact with her.5
2.  His  father.  His  father  is  85  years  old.  He  is  retired  from  his  position  at  a
children’s  education  center.  He  is  not  affiliated  with  the  government  or  the  military.
Applicant  is  very  close  to  his  father  and  tries  to  have  weekly  telephone  contact  with
him.6
Character Evidence
Applicant presented letters and citations describing his outstanding work in 2001-
2003.  He  set  up  systems  networks  for  DOD  projects  and  was  recognized  for  his
initiative, professionalism, and effectiveness.7
Administrative Notice-Russia.
Russia  has  a  highly  centralized,  weak  multi-party  political  system  dominated  by
the president. Russia has significant human-rights problems, marked by restrictions on
civil  liberties,  discrimination,  denial  of  due  process,  forced  confessions,  torture,  other
prisoner  mistreatment,  and  the  government’s  failure  to  prosecute  officials  who  commit
serious  violations.  Government  officials  also  engage  in  electronic  surveillance  without
proper authorization.
Russia is one of the most aggressive countries conducting espionage against the
United  States,  focusing  on  obtaining  proprietary  information  and  advance  weapons
technologies  beneficial  to  Russia’s  military  modernization  and  economic  development.

Russia’s intelligence services as well as private companies and other entities frequently
seek to exploit Russian citizens or persons with family ties to Russia who can use their
insider access to corporate networks to steal secrets. They also have offered financial
inducements  to  U.S.  government  officials  and  citizens
to
compromise  classified  information.  Russia’s  attempts  to  collect  U.S.  technological  and

"Applicant is a 40-year-old prospective employee of a defense contractor. His job
is contingent upon him receiving a security clearance. He has a bachelor’s degree. He
is married with one child.1
Applicant  was  born  in  the  United  States  to  parents  who  had  emigrated  from
Taiwan. His two siblings were also born in the United States. One sibling works for the
U.S.  military.  His  parents  became  U.S.  citizens  while  retaining  their  Taiwanese
citizenships. Applicant’s parents and siblings live in the United States.2
Applicant  has  worked  for  a  U.S.  company  since  2002.  His  job  required  him  to
travel  throughout  the  world,  and  he  worked  for  the  company  in  Taiwan  from  2003  to

credibly testified that his in-laws in Taiwan could not be used to coerce or intimidate him
into revealing classified information, and that he would report any attempt to do so.6
Applicant  is  active  in  his  community.  He  submitted  documents  and  letters
attesting to his strong moral character and outstanding job performance. He is praised
for  his  honesty,  trustworthiness,  dependability,  dedication,  reliability,  work  ethic,
integrity, and loyalty to the United States.7
Taiwan
The  United  States  and  Taiwan  enjoy  a  robust  unofficial  relationship.  The  1979
U.S.-P.R.C.  Joint  Communique  switched  diplomatic  recognition  from  Taipei  to  Beijing.
In the Joint Communique, the United States recognized the Government of the People’s
Republic  of  China  as  the  sole  legal government  of  China,  acknowledging  the  Chinese
position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China. The Joint Communique
also stated that the people of the United States will maintain cultural, commercial, and
other  unofficial  relations  with  the  people  of  Taiwan.  The  American  Institute  in  Taiwan
(AIT) is responsible for implementing U.S. policy toward Taiwan.
The  United  States  does  not  support  Taiwan  independence.  Maintaining  strong,
unofficial relations with Taiwan is a major U.S. goal, in line with the U.S. desire to further
peace and stability in Asia. The 1979 Taiwan Relations Act provides the legal basis for
the  unofficial  relationship  between  the  United  States  and  Taiwan,  and  enshrines  the
U.S.  commitment  to  assist  Taiwan  in  maintaining  its  defensive  capability.  The  United
States  insists  on  the  peaceful  resolution  of  cross-Strait  differences,  opposes  unilateral
changes to the  status quo  by  either side,  and  encourages  both  sides  to  continue  their
constructive dialogue on the basis of dignity and respect.
The  United  States  faces  a  serious  threat  to  its  national  security  from  Chinese
intelligence  operations.  China  aggressively  targets  U.S.  sensitive  and  protected
information  and  Chinese  actors  are  the  world’s  most  active  perpetrators  of  economic
espionage. Taiwan has also been an active collector of U.S. economic technologies that
have  sensitive  military  applications.  Numerous  cases  have  arisen  involving  the  illegal
export or attempted export of sensitive, dual-use technology to Taiwan.

"The SOR alleges under Guideline B that Applicant’s sister is a citizen and resident
of Russia (SOR ¶ 1.a); that Applicant’s brother-in-law is a Russian resident citizen who
retired from a department of the Russian government (SOR ¶ 1.b); and that Applicant has
a close friend of 50 years who is a resident citizen of Russia (SOR ¶ 1.c). When Applicant
responded to the SOR allegations, he admitted the Russian citizenship and residency of
his  sister,  brother-in-law,  and  longtime  friend.  He  indicated  that  his  sister  works  as  a
lawyer in Russia, but not for the Russian government, and that he has only casual and
infrequent communication with her. Applicant explained that his brother-in-law is a retired
widower, who previously worked for a private stock company that provides electricity to a
local  community.  He  stated  that  his  brother-in-law  never  worked  for  the  Russian
government and that he has had no contact with him in the last five to ten years. Applicant
admitted that he maintained a friendship with his old schoolmate, but they communicate
only a few times a year. Applicant denied that these Russian resident citizens could be a
source of coercion or influence for him, citing his “extensive” loyalty and ties to the United
States since 1991.
After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant  is a  58-year-old  Russian-language  interpreter.  He  was  born  in  Russia
and has one sibling, a sister, who works as a private attorney in Russia. His father was
an  engineer  and  his  mother  was  a  high  school  foreign-language  teacher  before  their
deaths  in  1992  and  2002,  respectively.  Applicant  received  a  bachelor’s  degree  in
linguistics with honors from a Russian university in 1983. In December 1983, he and his
spouse married in Russia. Also a native of Russia, Applicant’s spouse was educated as
a physician in Russia. He and his spouse have two sons. Their older  son was born in
Russia  in  April  1985.  In  1987,  Applicant  earned  a  doctorate  degree  in  philosophy  in
Russia. (GEs 1-2; AEs B-C, F-G; Tr. 52-56.)
In September 1991, Applicant came to the United States as a short-term visiting
scholar at a public university. He came to the United States on a J-1 visa. He decided to
stay  in  the  United  States  because  of  the  better  opportunities  here  for  his  family.  He
converted his visa status to student (F-1), and in the fall of 1992, he began studies at the
public university toward a Master of Business Administration degree, which was awarded
to him in September 1994. (GE 2; AEs B-C, H; Tr. 41, 99.) In August 1992, Applicant’s
spouse and son joined him in the United States. (AE B; Tr. 57.) In 1995, Applicant was
hired  by  the  university  to  administer  a  U.S.-government  grant-funded  United  States-
Russia partnership program where he managed economic development and professional
training  toward  making  Russia’s  academic  institutions  and  political  system  more
democratic. (AE B; Tr. 44, 96.) The program lasted two years, and Applicant traveled to
Russia from March 1995 to May 1995, in October 1995, from January 1996 to February
1996, and from May 1996 to June 1996 in support of the program. His university employer
funded the trips. (GE 2; Tr. 43-44.) As part of a trade initiative, he went to Russia in August
1998  and  August  1999.  (GE  2.)  He  went  to  Russia  for  both  business  and  pleasure  in
August 2000. He traveled to Russia annually for “tourism” in August 2001, August 2002,
and September 2003. (GE 2.)
From 2000 to 2005, Applicant was employed in the United States as a program
director for a small non-profit institute involved in training international participants about
building  democratic  institutions  and  free-market  economies.  In  approximately  2000,
Applicant  began  working  as  an  independent  contractor  providing  Russian-language
interpreter  and  translation  services  to  private  and  public  clients,  including  federal  and
state government agencies and departments. (GE 1; AEs B-C.) He successfully passed
the U.S. State Department’s Russian aptitude test in 1992, seminar interpreting test in
2000, and conference interpreting test in 2004. As a federally-qualified and state-certified
court  interpreter,  Applicant  passed  several  background  checks  to  provide  linguistic
support in federal and state courts. (AE B; Tr. 42-43.) His then employer sponsored him
for U.S. permanent residence. He recalls receiving his “green card” in 2001. (Tr. 96.)
Applicant  has  provided  part-time  interpreter  services  or  linguist  support  on  a
contract basis for department X of the U.S. government from June 2000 to at least May
2019 (GEs 1-2; AEs A, Q); for department Y of the U.S. government from January 2005
to June 2015 (GEs 1-2); and for a national laboratory involved in nuclear security issues
from July 2007 to at least December 2017. (GEs 1, 3; AEs B-C; Tr. 63-65.) In 2004, and
again in 2009, department X of the U.S. government certified Applicant for a public trust
position after determining that he was a moderate risk. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 62-63.) Most of his
work for department X and all of his work for department Y of the U.S. government has
been in the United States. (Tr. 64, 66)
In October 2008, Applicant and his spouse’s younger son was born in the United
States. (GEs 1-2; AEs B, J; Tr. 56.) Applicant’s spouse and Russian-born son acquired
U.S.  citizenship  by  naturalization  in  March  2007.  (AEs  I,  K.)  In  April  2009,  Applicant
became a naturalized U.S. citizen. (GEs 1-2; AE L.) He was the main petitioner for U.S.
citizenship for him and his family members, and he has no explanation for the delay in
him obtaining his U.S. citizenship other than a huge backlog in processing petitions. (Tr.
55.) Applicant obtained a U.S. passport in May 2009 valid for ten years. (GEs 1-2.) He
testified that he assumed when he took the oath of naturalization in the United States that
he was renouncing his Russian citizenship. (GE 2; Tr. 59, 94.)
Applicant  traveled  to  Russia  on  business  for  the  national  laboratory  in  October
2009,  and  for  six  days  in  January  2010  as  an  interpreter  for  a  U.S.-government
delegation, under the sponsorship of the national laboratory. (GE 1; Tr. 71.) He indicates
that  he  traveled on his  U.S. passport in  October 2009,  but on his Russian  passport in
January 2010. (GE 2.) His U.S. passport issued in May 2009 bears a re-entry stamp for
the United States dated October 30, 2009, but no obvious entry stamp for Russia or visa
for Russia in that passport. He did not submit in evidence a Russian passport that would
cover  that  trip  or  the  trip  in  January  2010,  apparently  because  the  Russian  Consulate
retained it. (GE 2.) It may be that he took both U.S. and Russian passports on his trip in
2009  and  used  his  Russian  passport  to  enter  Russia,  although  it  is  unclear.  Applicant
testified that after he obtained his U.S. citizenship, he requested a visa from the Russian
Consulate to travel to Russia on his U.S. passport for his interpreter work. He was advised
that he could not obtain a visa and that he had to extend his Russian passport to travel
to Russia. (Tr. 58.) Applicant’s Russian passport was last renewed in June 2013 for five
years, but he then did not take the trip to Russia. He did not renew his Russian passport
when it expired in June 2018. (Tr. 58.) He regarded his renewed Russian passport as a
travel  document  only  if  needed  to  enter  Russia  and  not  as  an  indicia  of  Russian
citizenship. (Tr. 95.) Applicant does not expect to travel to Russia any time soon. (Tr. 62.)
Applicant has not traveled to Russia since the trip in January 2010. (Tr. 71-72.)
In recent years, Applicant  served as an interpreter for department X of the U.S.
government  on  such  topics  as  emergency  preparedness  and  crisis  response,
management  of  national  parks,  fundraising  self-sufficiency  for  non-governmental
organizations, combating violent extremism, civic activism, external trade practices, and
disability access involving Russia or Kazakhstan. (AE C.) He completed a job assignment
for department X as recently as April 2019. (Tr. 65.) Applicant had an opportunity to travel
with a state delegation to Russia in 2018, but his Russian passport had expired so he did
not take the job. (Tr. 58-59.)
In  December  2017,  Applicant  was  offered  a  full-time  Russian-language  linguist
position  with  a  defense  contractor  to  perform  interpreter  services  for  the  U.S.  military
during  a  one-year  deployment  to  Iraq  at  $100,000  in  annual  salary.  The  company
approached him. The job was contingent on him obtaining a security clearance.1 (GE 2;
Tr. 35, 67.) On December 6, 2017, Applicant completed and electronically certified to the
accuracy of a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86), which he then signed
on March 1, 2018. He disclosed his dual citizenship with Russia and the United States,
and his possession of passports from both countries. He disclosed his sister’s Russian
citizenship and residency and her self-employment as a lawyer. He indicated that he had
annual  contact  with  her  by  telephone  or  electronic  means.  Applicant  responded
affirmatively to an inquiry concerning whether he had close and/or continuing contact with
a foreign national within the last seven years with whom he or his spouse was bound by
affection,  influence,  common  interests,  or  obligation.  He  indicated  that  he  had  annual
contact by electronic means to as recently as July 2017 with his “best school friend” in
Russia. (GE 1.)
On January 18, 2018, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for
the  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM).  He  expressed  his  intention  to  renew  his
Russian passport because he would need it as a travel document to enter Russia should
he ever be required to travel to Russia for work. He also stated that he was prepared to
relinquish his Russian passport or have the company or agency hold his Russian passport
during the duration of his assignment if his job required him to do so. (Tr. 60-61.)
1 Applicant  testified  that  the  job  offer  “is  no  longer  kind  of  valid,  and  [he  is]  not  going  to  pursue  it.”  The
Government  confirmed  that  the  company  had  not  withdrawn  its  request  for  a  security  clearance  for
Applicant, and Applicant indicated that he would consider a short-term interpreter assignment. (Tr. 35-38.)
Adequate justification existed for the hearing and adjudication process to continue.
On March 1, 2018, Applicant had a counterintelligence-focused security screening
interview. He explained that he had taken no steps to renounce his Russian citizenship
because  he  does  not  consider  himself  to  be  a  citizen  of  Russia,  and  he  regards  his
Russian passport as a travel document to gain entry to Russia. He explained that he had
to renew his Russian passport because the Russian Consulate would not give him a visa
to enter Russia on his U.S. passport. He stated that he had no problem renouncing his
Russian citizenship, and that he considered the United States his home. He described
Russia as his “motherland” and indicated that he would like the United States and Russia
to  have  good  relations.  Applicant  denied  any  contact  with  any  representatives  of  the
Russian government apart from his visits to the Russian Consulate to renew his Russian
passport  over  the  years.  If  he  was  to  face  any  threat  or  blackmail  attempt,  Applicant
indicated that he would inform the appropriate authorities, although he indicated that he
had no concerns for the safety of family members, including those in Russia. In response
to a question about whether he had provided any assistance to foreign persons or entities,
he indicated that he had transferred about $1,000 to his sister in Russia to cover part of
their mother’s funeral costs in September 2002. When asked whether he could conceive
of a situation when it would be okay to betray his country (for him the United States since
1991),  he  responded,  “No,  other  than  when  it  comes  to  his  immediate  family.”  He
professed loyalty solely to the United States, and he demonstrated to the interviewer an
understanding of the need to protect U.S. missions and secrets. (GE 2.)
relationships,  Applicant
About  Russian  contacts  or
related  during  his
counterintelligence-screening  interview  that  he  had  annual  contact  with  three  resident
citizens of Russia: his sister, a self-employed attorney, who had no experience in Russia’s
government or military; his spouse’s brother, who had worked as an electrical technician
for a state-owned utility before he retired in 2013; and a school friend, who had taught
history  at  a  police  academy  before  his  retirement  in  2013.  Applicant  indicated  that  his
father-in-law had worked for a Russian state-owned utility until his death in 2006, and that
his  mother-in-law  had  been  a  physician  in  Russia  before  her death  in  2010.  Applicant
responded negatively to whether he, any relatives, or associates had ever been members
or supporters of terrorist entities or state intelligence or security agencies, including the
Glavnote  Razvedyvatelnoye  Upravlenie  (GRU--a  military  intelligence  agency  of  the
General Staff of Russia’s Armed Forces) and the Komitet Gosudarstvennoy Bezqpasnosti
for  business  and  pleasure.  For
(KGB).  He  detailed  extensive
counterintelligence purposes, the screener concluded that Applicant had the potential to
present a security risk because of his dual citizenship and his possession of both United
States and Russian passports. National intelligence agency checks and national agency
checks were incomplete as of the screening. (GE 2.)
foreign
travel
Applicant  and  his  spouse  have  lived  in  their  current  home  in  the  United  States
since June 2000. (GE 1; AE M.) They paid off their mortgage and do not intend to move
from their community. (Tr. 41, 87.) Their older son graduated from a prestigious private
university in the United States, and he currently works as a computer software engineer
in the United States. (GE 2; AE B.) Their younger son is now ten years old. Applicant’s
spouse does not currently work outside the home. (Tr. 41, 54.) Applicant has no foreign
assets. (Tr. 50.) He has bank, investment, and retirement account assets in the United
States of approximately $784,000. (GE 2; AE N.) He testified that his loyalty lies with the
United States. (Tr. 45.) He renewed his U.S. passport in October 2018 for another ten
years. (AE O.)
Applicant’s sister is a divorced 52-year-old private attorney in her native Russia.
She has two daughters and two grandchildren. Applicant’s last in-person contact with his
sister was in 2001, when he was in Russia. He has traveled to Russia since then, but not
to  her  area.  He  communicates  with  her  a  few  times  a  year  to  exchange  birthday  and
holiday greetings. Their last email contact was in 2013. They now communicate via social
media by a messaging application approximately two to three times per year to exchange
birthday  and  New  Year’s  greetings.  He  testified  that  he  loves  his  sister,  despite  the
infrequency of their contact. (Tr. 90.) Applicant does not know the names of his sister’s
grandchildren. He believes that one of his nieces works as a fashion designer. His sister
knows he works as an interpreter but not the details of his work. She does not know that
he has applied for a security clearance. She has never visited him in the United States.
(GEs 1-2; Tr. 45-47, 69-70, 72-75.)
Applicant’s spouse’s brother is a 62-year-old widower with two adult children and
several  grandchildren.  Applicant’s  brother-in-law  worked  until  his  retirement  for  an
electrical power distribution company that was privatized in the 1990s. Applicant has not
spoken to his brother-in-law since his spouse inherited approximately $10,000 from the
sale of her mother’s apartment on her mother’s death in 2010. Applicant’s spouse calls
her brother on his birthday each August. Applicant considers his contact with his spouse’s
brother  as  minimal.  His  brother-in-law  is  unaware  that  he  has  applied  for  a  security
clearance. Applicant might have seen his brother-in-law during his trip to Russia in 2001.
He has not had any in-person contact with him since then. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 47, 69, 76-81.)
Applicant has casual contact a few times a year to exchange birthday and holiday
greetings  by  Skype  or  Viber  with  a  longtime  friend  in  Russia  from  their  school  days
(grades 1-12 and university) together in Russia. This friend is a retired history professor
who previously worked at a Russian government-affiliated police academy. He does not
know  Applicant  has  applied  for  a  security  clearance.  This  friend  and  his  wife  visited
Applicant and his spouse in the United States in July 2011. They stayed in Applicant’s
home for one week. Applicant has not seen this friend since  then. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 47-48,
69, 81-85.) Applicant admitted at his hearing that he knows other people in Russia, such
as former classmates, but he has no ongoing communication with them. (Tr. 49.)
Applicant does not believe that his professional judgment can be influenced by the
fact that his sister and brother-in-law live in Russia. (Tr. 49.) Applicant does not foresee
that his communications with his sister, brother-in-law, and school friend in Russia will
increase in the future. (Tr. 50.) On January 4, 2019, Applicant submitted a statement of
his intention to continue to have minimal or no contact with foreign contacts outside of his
official duties and with his family. He indicated that any future communications “will remain
strictly casual and infrequent,” while acknowledging that any future communications that
went beyond causal and infrequent would be grounds for revocation of national security
eligibility. (AE P.) When asked how he would respond to any attempt at foreign influence
or  coercion  through  his  family  members  in  Russia,  Applicant  testified  that  if  he  is  in  a
position of trust, his first thought would be to inform the person who entrusted him with
the confidential information. (Tr. 90-91.)
Applicant  has  taken  his  work  seriously  over  the  years,  including  his  public  trust
work for the U.S. government. (AE A; Tr. 50.) The night following his security clearance
hearing, Applicant was scheduled to travel to a country formerly part of the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics for department X of the U.S. government. Department X obtained a
visa for him to travel on his U.S. passport after he advised them that he no longer had a
valid  Russian  passport.  (Tr.  91-92.)  Applicant  testified  that  if  granted  a  DOD  security
clearance, he would not renew his Russian passport. (Tr. 92-93.)
Character References
Applicant is reported to have provided reliable and unbiased translation services
over the years in the exchanges between Russian and American academics and political
leaders arranged by a voluntary association of persons interested in improving relations
and understanding between the United States and Russia. He became an indispensable

Applicant’s work. He indicates that he “cannot give a high enough recommendation that
would adequately reflect [Applicant’s] work.” (AE A.)
A  language  specialist  with  department  X  of  the  U.S.  government  indicates  that
Applicant  has  worked  with  Russian-speaking  international  visitors  participating  in
department X–sponsored programs since 2001. Applicant has proven to be among the
most experienced and reliable interpreters for his office, and he has earned appreciation
and praise from the office. The language specialist attests that the office plans to continue
offering Applicant interpreter assignments in the future. Applicant has been professional,
reliable,  and  trustworthy  in  fulfilling  his  assigned  tasks.  He  believes  Applicant  can  be
trusted. (AE A.)
An international trade specialist with department Y of the U.S. government worked
directly with Applicant from 2009 to 2015. She described Applicant’s interpreter skills as

future.  Applicant’s  mastery  of  both  Russian  and  English
professionalism  have  led  the  company  to  use  his  services  at  numerous  seminars  and
conferences in the United States and elsewhere for several years. Feedback from clients
has been positive for his knowledge and professionalism. (AE A.)
Administrative Notice
Russia  is  a  highly  centralized,  authoritarian  political  system  dominated  by
President  Vladimir  Putin.  Its  bicameral  federal  assembly  lacks  independence  from  the
executive  branch.  The  United  States  and  Russia  established  diplomatic  relations  in
December  1991  following  the  dissolution  of  the  Soviet  Union.  There  is  currently  a  low
level  of  trust  between  the  United  States  and  Russia  because  of  Russia’s  efforts  to
influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election and undermine U.S. democratic institutions
and because of Russia’s recent and ongoing aggressive economic espionage targeting
U.S. companies and trade secrets. Russian civilian and military intelligence services have
been implicated in a campaign of cyber operations directed at the U.S. government and
its citizens, which include spear-phishing campaigns targeting government organizations,
critical infrastructure,  think  tanks, universities,  political organizations, and  corporations;
theft of information; and public release of some of this information. Russia has recently
assumed  a  more  assertive  cyber  posture  based  on  its  willingness  to  target  critical
infrastructure  systems  and  conduct  espionage  operations.  In  addition  to  cyberspace,
Russia  uses  commercial  and  academic  enterprises  that  interact  with  the  West,
recruitment  of  Russian  immigrants  with  advanced  technical  skills,  and  Russian
intelligence  penetration  of  public  and  private  enterprises,  to  obtain  sensitive  technical
information from U.S. industries. (GE 4.)
In October 2015, three employees of a U.S. company were convicted of conspiring
to export and of illegally exporting sophisticated technology (controlled microelectronics)
to Russia between October 2008 and October 2012. In May 2016, an agent of Russia’s
foreign intelligence agency (SVR) working under non-official cover as a bank employee
in Manhattan was sentenced to 30 months in prison for attempting to collect economic
intelligence and recruit New York City residents as intelligence sources for Russia. He
conspired with a trade representative of the Russian government in New York from 2010
to 2014 and with an attaché to Russia’s Permanent Mission to the United Nations from
2012 to 2013. (GE 4.)
In  March  2017,  the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  obtained  indictments  of  two
Russian Federal Security Service officials and their Russian cybercriminal  conspirators
on computer hacking and conspiracy charges related to the collection of emails of U.S.
and European employees of transportation and financial services firms. In August 2017,
a  U.S.  citizen  pleaded  guilty  to  conspiring  to  smuggle  and  illegally  export  radiation-
hardened integrated circuits to Russia and China between June 2015 and March 2016.
In  September  2017,  the  U.S.  Department  of  Homeland  Security  directed  federal
departments and agencies to remove Kaspersky Lab products and services based on the
information security risks posed by the company and its links to Russia. In March 2018,
a  Florida  man  pleaded  guilty  to  conspiring  with  customers  in  Russia  to  illegally  export
night-vision rifle scopes and a thermal multi-purpose monocular to Russia in 2013. In July
2018, a resident citizen of Russia, who owns a privately-held Russian microelectronics
import/export  company,  was  indicted  in  a  U.S.  federal  district  court  for  conspiracy  to
commit money laundering, conspiracy to smuggle sensitive electronics to Russian military
and intelligence agencies, and conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Powers
Act. (GE 4.)
In early October 2018, seven officers of the GRU were indicted in a U.S. federal
district  court  for  computer  hacking,  wire  fraud,  aggravated  identity  theft,  and  money
laundering.  The  GRU  officers  are  alleged  to  have  conspired  between  December 2014
and  at  least  May  2018  in  conducting  persistent  and  sophisticated  computer  intrusions
affecting U.S. persons, corporate entities, international organizations, and their respective
employees based on their strategic interest to the Russian government. Two of the GRU
officials were charged with conspiring to gain unauthorized access to computers of U.S.
persons and entities involved in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, steal documents from
those  computers,  and  stage  releases  of  the  stolen  documents  to  interfere  with  the
election. In mid-October 2018, a Russian national was charged in the United States with
conspiring to interfere with the U.S. political system, including the 2018 midterm election.
While  serving  as  chief  accountant  of  a  Russian  umbrella  effort  funding  by  a  Russian
oligarch to spread distrust of U.S. candidates and the U.S. political system and to defraud
the  United  States,  she  allegedly  played  a  central  financial  management  role  in  a
disinformation  campaign  through  social  media  platforms  to  create  and  amplify  divisive
social and political content targeting U.S. audiences. In December 2018, the U.S. State
Department added 12 individuals and entities to the List of Specified Persons pursuant to
Section 231 of the Countering America’s Adversaries through Sanctions Act for being part
of,  or  operating  for  or  on  behalf  of,  the  defense  or  intelligence  sectors  of  the  Russian
government. The U.S. intelligence community believes Russia will remain a major threat
to U.S. government, military, diplomatic, commercial, and critical infrastructure. (GE 4.)
The  U.S.  State  Department  issued  a  Level  2  travel  advisory  for  Russia  in
December 2018, advising U.S. citizens to exercise increased caution due to terrorism,
harassment,  and  the  arbitrary  enforcement  of  local  laws  in  Russia.  U.S.  citizens  are
advised  that  terrorist  groups,  transnational  and  local  terrorist  organizations,  and
individuals inspired by extremist ideology continue plotting possible attacks in Russia and
that  terrorists  may  attack  with  little  or  no  warning  places  frequented  by  tourists.
Additionally, U.S. citizens visiting or residing in Russia have been arbitrarily interrogated
or detained by Russian officials and may become victims of harassment, mistreatment,
and  extortion.  Russia enforces  special  restrictions  on dual U.S.-Russian  nationals and
may  refuse  to  acknowledge  their  U.S.  citizenship,  including  denying  U.S.  consular
assistance to detained dual nationals and preventing their departure from Russia. The
U.S.  government  has  assessed  Moscow  as  being  a  high-threat  location  for  terrorism,
crime, and political violence directed at or affecting official U.S. government interests. (GE

Serious human rights abuses persisted in Russia in 2017 as Russia continues to
train, equip, lead, and fight alongside pro-Russian forces in regions of eastern Ukraine
since  the  occupation  and  “annexation”  of  Crimea  in  March  2014.  The  United  States
10
considers  Russia’s  actions  in  Crimea  to  be  unlawful  and  in  violation  of  Ukrainian  and
international  law,  and  has  suspended  most  bilateral  engagement  with  the  Russian
government  on  economic  issues.  Russian  authorities  conducted  politically  motivated
arrests,  detentions,  and  trials  of  Ukrainian  citizens  in  Russia.  Russian  authorities
continued to severely restrict the ability of Russia’s citizens to choose their government
through  free  and  fair  elections  and  to  exercise  freedoms  of  expression,  assembly,
association, and movement. Russian authorities blocked and filtered Internet content and
used  cyberattacks  to  disrupt  peaceful  Internet  discussion.  Widespread  corruption
persisted in all branches of government. Extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances,
torture,  lack  of  judicial  independence,  harsh  and  life-threatening  conditions  in  prisons,
and arbitrary arrest and detention, were among the most significant human rights abuses
in Russia in 2017. (GE 4.)

"Applicant is 34 years old. He was born in a small village in Somalia. He received
his primary education through a private school because his village did not have its own
school. He worked at the family-owned grocery shop in the village. His family in Somalia
includes his mother, a sister, one brother, and two half-brothers. Applicant is uncertain if
his other sister lives in Central or Southern Africa. His father passed away in 2006. (Tr.
18-26, 35; GE 1, GE 2, GE 3)
In  2009,  Applicant  left  Somalia  and  was  admitted  into  a  refugee  camp  in  the
Netherlands after he requested asylum. He said his country and the government were in
chaos. While residing in the Netherlands, he met a woman who was a naturalized U.S.
citizen,  and  they  were  married  in  a  religious  ceremony,  but  not  a  legally  recognized
ceremony in the U.S. She returned to the U.S. in early 2012, and Applicant’s son was
born in the United States in November 2012. (Tr. 18-26, 35; GE 1)
In  February  2014, Applicant  immigrated to  the  U.S. on a  fiancé  visa.  He  legally
married his wife about a week after his arrival. They had another son in November 2015.
Applicant worked as a truck driver, and his spouse worked in a warehouse. He became
a naturalized U.S. citizen in July 2017. He and his spouse separated in about September
2017. During their separation, his spouse gave birth to his daughter in 2018. As of the
date of the hearing, they were still separated, but Applicant and his wife were working to
repair  their  relationship  and  reunite.  Applicant  has  never returned to  Somalia  since he
entered the U.S. in 2014. All members of his family are U.S. citizens. He considers himself
an American and intends to raise his family in his adopted and beloved country. (Tr. 24-
32, 65)
Foreign Influence:
Applicant’s mother is approximately 74 years old. She is a citizen and resident of
Somalia. One of his sisters, also a citizen and resident of Somalia, lives with his mother
in their village home. They continue to operate the family’s grocery shop. His mother owns
a cell phone, and Applicant cannot speak with his mother while she is in the village due
to connectivity limitations. His mother calls Applicant whenever she visits the city where
she is able to obtain cell phone service. Applicant sometimes goes as long as three to
four months without hearing from his mother. There are times Applicant speaks briefly
with  his  sister  during  these  phone  calls.  He  sends  his  mother  financial  assistance  on
approximately a monthly basis. He sends the money through a registered money service
business, and his mother must pick up the funds at a bank in the city. Applicant described
his  mother  and  family  members  in  Somalia  as  simple  people  with  extremely  limited
income.  His  family  members  have  no  connections  with  the  Government  or  military  of
Somalia. (Tr. 34-42)
Applicant is not certain where his second sister is currently living, but believes she
may  be  in  South  or  Central  Africa.  They  last  spoke  in  2015  when  she  called  him
requesting money because she was sick. Since 2015, Applicant has not had any contact
with this sister. (Tr. 43-44, 66)
Applicant clarified at the hearing that he has one older brother and two younger
half-brothers.  Department  Counsel  requested  that  the  SOR  be  amended  to  properly
reflect this accurate information, which I granted without objection. Applicant did not grow
up with his older brother because he lived in the rural area of Somalia, and was possibly
raising goats. Applicant has not had any communication with his brother until about two
years ago, when his brother called him. His brother asked for financial help because his
wife  was  sick.  Applicant  sent  him  about $200, and  they  have  not communicated  since
2017. (Tr. 44-49)
Applicant does not have contact with his two younger half-brothers. They also live
in the rural area of Somalia, possibly raising goats. Applicant reported that the majority of
Somalians, approximately 60%, are nomads living in rural areas of Somalia. He reiterated
that his family is considered simple folk, and he does not have any assets in Somalia. (Tr.
50-51)
At the hearing, Applicant testified that the counter-intelligence security-screening
document  contained  inaccurate  information  that  he  wanted  to  correct.  There  was  a
reference to Applicant stating that he knew a Somalian army general and he spoke to him
on a weekly basis. This information supported an allegation alleged in the SOR. (¶ 1.c)
Applicant  explained  that  when  he  lived  in  the  village,  an  older man  visited  his family’s
grocery  shop  to  purchase  food.  He  believed  the  man  had  previously  served  in  the
Somalian army, and the people in the village nicknamed the elderly man “the General.”
Applicant  got  to  know  “the  General”  due  to  him  being  a  regular  customer.  In  addition,
Applicant attended private school with “the General’s” son, whom he considers his friend.
Applicant  has  had  infrequent  contact  with  his  friend  over  the  years.  When  the  U.S.
government  interviewer  asked  Applicant  if  he  knew  anyone  who  worked  for  the
Government  or military  of  Somalia,  he  disclosed  his  connection  to  “the  General”  in  an
effort to be completely forthright. Applicant denied ever stating that he communicated with
“the  General”  on  a  weekly  basis.  As  indicated  in  his  SOR  response,  Applicant  was
informed that “the General” passed away in early 2018. (Tr. 54-62; GE 2)
Applicant testified that the U.S. government interviewer also asked him to disclose
someone  who  could  verify  his  occupancy  at  the  refugee  camp  in  the  Netherlands.
Applicant provided the name of an individual from Somalia he met at the refugee camp,
who  now  resides  in  Germany.  Applicant  stated  that  this  individual  was  more  of  an
acquaintance, not a personal friend, and the last time they communicated was in early
2018 using social media. (Tr. 62-65; GE 2)
Applicant  submitted  character  reference  letters  from  two  co-workers,  who  both
praised Applicant’s diligence, efficiency, and honesty. They recommended Applicant be
granted a security clearance as he would be an excellent linguist. (AE B, AE C)

"The  SOR  alleges:  Applicant’s  mother,  father,  and  sister  are  citizens  of  Russia;
her sister is a resident of Russia and an employee of the Russian Government; and she
maintains contact with a friend who is a citizen and resident of Israel. (HE 2)  Applicant
admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations.  (HE  3)  She  also  provided  mitigating  information.
(HE 3) Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and
thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  31-year-old  logistics  and  procurement  specialist.  (Tr.  48-49)  Her
employment for the previous five years was as a buyer for a different company. (Tr. 48-

she  moved  to  Russia  in  2005.  She  obtained  Russian  citizenship  to  qualify  for  social
benefits,  such  as  medical  services  in  Russia.  (Tr.  53)  From  2005  to  2010,  she  lived  in
Russia, and in 2010, she immigrated to the United States. In 2015, she became a U.S.

immigrating  to  the  United  States  in  2010.  (Tr.  49)  Applicant  said  she  is  willing  to
renounce  her  Russian  citizenship; however, she has  not  taken  any  steps  to do  so.  (Tr.
53, 77) Applicant attended university in Russia; however, she does not owe any student
loan  debts  to  the  Russian  Government.  (Tr.  54)  She  is  currently  enrolled  in  a  U.S.

Applicant’s  parents  lived  in  Russia  for  many  years  before  visiting  the  United
States  for  six  months  in  2017.  (Tr.  59)  Applicant’s  father  was  a  mechanic  in  Russia
before  he  retired.  (Tr. 61)  Applicant  sponsored  her  parents  for  permanent  residence  in
the  United  States,  and  in  2018,  they  returned  to  the  United  States  and  received  their
green  cards.  (Tr.  59-80)  Her  parents  lived  with  Applicant  and  her  husband  when  they
were  in  the  United  States.  Applicant  speaks  excellent  English;  however,  her  parents
speak  little  English.  (Tr.  31-32)  Her  father  returned  to  Russia  in  2019  for  medical
treatment  because  it  was  less  expensive  than  in  the  United  States.  (Tr.  60)  Applicant
paid  her  father’s  expenses  to  return  to  Russia.  (Tr.  76)  Her  father  receives  a  $125
monthly  pension from the  Russian  Government,  and  these payments  will  end  when  he
becomes  a  U.S.  citizen.  (Tr. 77, 79)  She believes  he  will return  to the  United  States  in
August 2019. (Tr. 60-61) Her parents know she has applied for a security clearance. (Tr.
72)
Applicant has two siblings. (Tr. 50) One of her sisters emigrated from Uzbekistan
to Russia, and this sister is a citizen of Russia and has lived in Russia for 32 years. (Tr.
50) She is employed by the Russian government in a low-level position. (Tr. 50) She is
married  and  her  husband  works  in  retail.  (Tr.  51)  She  has  three  children.  (Tr.  51)

51-52,  74;  GE  1)  Applicant’s  mother  communicates  with  Applicant’s  sister  on  about  a
weekly  basis.  (Tr.  75)  Applicant’s  sister  has  not  visited  Applicant  in  the  United  States.
(Tr. 52)
Applicant’s other sister lives in the United States, and she has been a permanent
resident  of  the  United  States  since  2004.  (Tr.  62)  She  is  a  Russian  citizen,  and  she
intends  to  become  a  U.S.  citizen.  (Tr.  58)  She  is divorced,  and  she  has  one  child.  (Tr.
63)
Applicant traveled to Russia in 2012 and 2016, and she traveled to Israel in 2012
and 2017. (Tr. 64-65) In 2012, Applicant voted in a Russian election. (Tr. 69) She voted
in U.S. elections in 2016 and 2018. (Tr. 69) Applicant has a friend who lives in Israel, and
Applicant communicates with her about once a month and on holidays. (Tr. 62-63)

brilliantly.” (AE A; AE B) She received excellent employee evaluations. (AE C-AE E)
Russia
The USSR was the principal adversary of the United States during the Cold War
(1947-1991),  after  which  it  broke  into  Russia  and  14  independent  republics.  Following
economic and political turmoil during President Boris Yeltsin’s term (1991-1999), Russia
shifted  toward  a  centralized  authoritarian  state  under  the  leadership  of  President
Vladimir  Putin,  in  which  the  regime  seeks  to  legitimize  its  rule  through  managed
elections,  populist  appeals,  a  foreign  policy  focused  on  enhancing  the  country’s
geopolitical  influence,  and  commodity  based  economic  growth.  Russia  faces  a  largely
subdued  rebel  movement  in  Chechnya  and  other  surrounding  regions,  although
violence still occurs through the North Caucasus.
On July 26, 2018, the National Counterintelligence and Security Center released
its  2018  Foreign  Economic  Espionage  in  Cyberspace  Report,  in  which  it  reported  that
foreign  economic  and  industrial  espionage  against  the  United  States  continues  to
represent a significant threat to the United States’ prosperity, security, and competitive
advantage  and  identified  Russia  as  one  of  the  three  most  capable  and  active  cyber
actors  tied  to  economic  espionage  and  the  potential  theft  of  U.S.  trade  secrets  and
proprietary information. It reported that Russia uses cyber operations as an instrument
of intelligence collection to inform its decision-making and benefit its economic interests,
and  that  Russian  intelligence  services  have  conducted  sophisticated  and  large-scale
hacking operations to collect sensitive U.S. business and technology information.
The  report  noted  that,  “[a]n  aggressive  and  capable  collector  of  sensitive  U.S.
technologies,  Russia  uses  cyberspace  as  one  of  many  methods  for  obtaining  the
necessary  know-how  and  technology  to  grown  and  modernize  its  economy.”  Other
methods of collection include use of Russian commercial and academic enterprises that
interact with the West; recruitment of Russian immigrants with advanced technical skills
by the Russian intelligence services; and Russian intelligence penetration of public and
private enterprises, which enable the Russian government to obtain sensitive technical
information from industry.
On February 13, 2018, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI)
issued its Worldwide Threat Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community, Statement
for  the  Record,  in  which  it  assessed  that  Russia  will  employ  a  variety  of  aggressive
tactics  to  bolster  its  standing  as  a  great  power,  weaken  the  United  States,  and
undermine  Euro-Atlantic  unity;  and  that  Russia  will  use  a  range  of  relatively  low-cost
tools to advance its foreign policy objectives, including influence campaigns, economic
coercion, cyber operations, and measured military force. The ODNI also assessed that
President Putin will likely increase his use of repression and intimidation to contend with
domestic discontent over corruption, poor social services, and a sluggish economy; he
will continue to manipulate the media and is likely to expand the Russian government’s
legal basis for repression; and during 2018, Russia will continue to modernize, develop,
and field a wide range of advanced nuclear, conventional, and asymmetric capabilities
to  balance  its  perception  of  a  strategic  military  inferiority  vis-a-vis  the  United  States.
Russia will also seek to maintain, and where possible, expand its influence through the
former Soviet countries that it asserts are in its self-described sphere of influence.
The  ODNI  has  reported  that  areas  of  highest  interest  to  foreign  intelligence
collectors
technology;
include  energy/alternative  energy;  biotechnology;  defense
environmental protection; high-end manufacturing; and information and communications
technology.  In  March  2017,  the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  indicted  two  Russian
Federal  Security  Service  officials  and  their  Russian  cybercriminal  conspirators  on
computer hacking and conspiracy charges related to the collection of emails of U.S. and
European  employees  of  transportation  and  financial  services  firms.  The  charges
included conspiring to engage in economic espionage and theft of trade secrets.
The  ODNI  has  also  reported  that  Russian  efforts  to  influence  the  2016  U.S.
presidential  election  represent  the  most  recent  expression  of  Russia’s  long-standing
desire to undermine the U.S.-led liberal democratic order and noted that “these activities
demonstrated a significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort
compared  to  previous  operations.”  The  2016  influence  campaign  reflected  Russia’s
recognition of the worldwide effects that mass disclosure of U.S. Government and other
private  data  have  achieved  in  recent  years.  The  ODNI  assessed  that  Russian
intelligence services will continue to develop capabilities to provide President Putin with
options to use against the United States.
The  U.S.  Department  of  State  Travel  Advisory  for  Russia  is  Level  2  -  Exercise
Increased Caution, due to terrorism, harassment, and the arbitrary enforcement of local
laws.  The  advisory  directs  U.S.  citizens  not  to  travel  to  the  North  Caucasus,  including
Chechnya  and  Mount  Elbrus,  due  to  terrorism  and  civil  unrest;  or  to  Crimea  due  to
Russia’s  occupation  of  the  Ukrainian  territory  and  abuses  by  its  occupying  authorities.
Terrorist  groups  continue plotting  possible attacks  in  Russia, and may  attack  with  little
or  no  warning.  U.S.  citizens  have  been  arbitrarily  interrogated  or  detained  by  Russian
officials  and  may  become  victims  of  harassment,  mistreatment,  and  extortion.  Due  to
the Russian government-imposed reduction on U.S. diplomatic personnel in Russia, the
U.S. Government has reduced ability to provide services to U.S. citizens.
The Department of State has assessed Moscow as being a high-threat location
for terrorist activity directed at or affecting official U.S. Government interests. Although
Russia  continued  to  prioritize  counterterrorism  efforts  in  2017,  it  remained  a  target  of
international terrorist groups, particularly ISIS.
Russia  maintains  an  extensive  military  presence  in  Crimea  and  is  likely  to  take
further  military  actions  in  Crimea  as  part  of  its  occupation  of  this  part  of  Ukraine.  The
international  community,  including  the  United  States  and  Ukraine,  does  not  recognize
Russia’s  purported  annexation  of  Crimea.  In  response  to  Russia’s  violations  of
Ukraine’s  sovereignty,  and  other  acts,  the  United  States  suspended  most  bilateral
engagement with the Russian government on economic issues. Anti-American and anti-
Western rhetoric is widespread in both official media sources and on social media.
In its 2017 Human Rights Report, the Department of State reported that Russia’s
occupation  and  purported  annexation  of  Ukraine’s  Crimean  Peninsula  continued  to
affect  the  human  rights  situation  in  Russia  significantly  and  negatively.  Credible
observers  attributed  thousands  of  civilian  deaths  and  injuries,  as  well  as  widespread
abuses,  to  Russian-led  forces  in  Ukraine’s  Donbas  region  and  to  Russian  occupation
authorities  in  Crimea.  Human  rights  groups  asserted  that  numerous  Ukrainian  citizens
remained in Russia as political prisoners.
The most significant human rights issues in Russia included extrajudicial killings;
enforced  disappearance;  torture  that  was  systematic  and  sometimes  resulted  in  death
and  sometimes  included  punitive  psychiatric  incarceration;  harsh  and  life-threatening
conditions  in  prisons;  arbitrary  arrest  and  detention;  lack  of  judicial  independence;
political  prisoners;  severe  interference  with  privacy;  severe  restrictions  on  freedom  of
expression  and  the  media;  increasingly  severe  restriction  on  freedom  of  association,
including  laws  on  “foreign  agents”  and  “undesirable  foreign  organizations;”  and
widespread corruption at all levels and in all branches of government. The government
failed  to  take  adequate  steps  to  prosecute  or  punish  most  officials  who  committed
abuses, resulting in a climate of impunity.
Cybercrime  is  also  a  significant  problem  across  Russia.  The  risk  of  infection,
compromise,  and  theft  via  malware,  spam  email,  sophisticated  spear  phishing,  and
social engineering attacks is significant. Telephone and electronic communications are
subject  to  surveillance  at  any  time  without  advisory.  The  Russian  System  for
Operational-Investigative Activities permits authorities to monitor and record all data that
traverses Russia’s networks.
Department Counsel provided examples of Russian intelligence operations within
the United States including information about indictments and convictions. There is no
evidence that Applicant or her family are or were involved in any intelligence operations
against the United States or otherwise.
Israel
Israel is a multiparty parliamentary democracy. Israel is a close ally of the United
States.  The  two  countries  participate  in  joint  military  planning  and  training  and  have
collaborated  on  military  research  and  weapons  development.  There  have  been
incidents of illegal export, actual or attempted, of dual-use technology form the U.S. to
Israel. The United States has disagreed with Israel about its sale of United States and
Israeli  technologies  to  other  countries,  such  as  China  and  Russia.  Israel  has  been
subjected  to  numerous  attacks  from  the  Palestinians  from  the  Gaza  Strip.  There  is  a
significant risk of terrorism in Israel.

Applicant returned to Iran to visit her ill father once in 2008. She visited him two to
three times in 2012, before his death. He was not affiliated with the government. She and
her husband and children have visited both her husband’s and her families four or five
times since 2012, including in 2017. She did not go in 2018, but would like to return to
visit  her  family  in  Iran  in  the  future.  (Tr.  26,  45-48;  GE  2)  Applicant  uses  her  Iranian
passport to enter and exit Iran, as it is easier. She said she has never been questioned
by the Iranian government about her activities in the United States during her trips to Iran.
(Tr. 41; Answer)
Applicant’s mother is a citizen and resident of Iran. She is 63 years old. Applicant
generally speaks to her mother every day. She last saw her mother in 2017 when she
visited her in Iran. Her mother visited the United States in 2006 and 2010. Applicant does
not provide financial support to her mother. Her mother is supported through Applicant’s
deceased  father’s  estate.  (Tr.  32-33,  39)  Applicant  is  sponsoring  her  mother  for  U.S.
citizenship. She said her family members know that she works in research in the United
States, but they do not know the name of her employer. However, Applicant recently told
her mother the name because she needed that information for an interview that is part of
the U.S. citizenship process. (Tr. 29)
Applicant has three sisters. All of them are citizens and residents of Iran. The oldest
sister is 41 years old. She is married and has two children. She and her husband are both

her  in-laws,  but  does  visit  them  when  she  is  in  Iran.  She  thinks  her  husband
communicates with them about every two weeks. (Tr. 42-45)
Applicant  began  working  for  her  employer  in  2014.  She  has  an  extensive  and
impressive background in research. (AE B, AE E) Two of her supervisors strongly support
her request for a security clearance. They attest to her accomplishments, leadership, and
integrity. (AE C, AE D) She is active in several professional organizations. (Tr. 24, 28)
Applicant said that the United States is her home. She intends to live here with her
family the rest of her life. She is happy in the United States. (Tr. 42)
Iran
The following facts are based on the source documents in HE 2:
Iran has been designated as a State Sponsor of Terrorism since 1984. It remains
the most prominent state sponsor of terrorism, providing financial aid, advanced weapons
and  tactics,  and  direction  to  militant  and  terrorist  groups  across  the  Middle  East.  It
cultivates  operatives  across  the  globe  as  a  contingency  to  enable  potential  terrorist
attacks.
Iran  uses  terrorist  groups  to  implement  foreign  policy  goals,  provide  cover  for
intelligence operations, and create instability in the Middle East. It remains an enduring
threat  to  the  U.S.  national  interests.  Iran  and  its  primary  terrorism  partners  pose  a
persistent threat to the United States and its partners worldwide. The U.S. Government
does  not have  diplomatic  ties  or consular relations  with  Iran.  The Department  of  State
warns U.S. citizens not to travel to Iran due to the risk of arbitrary arrest and detention.
Iran continued to leverage cyber espionage, propaganda, and attacks to support
its  security  priorities,  influence  events  and  foreign  perceptions,  and  counter  threats
including against U.S. allies in the region. The U.S. Director of National Intelligence (DNI)
has identified several countries, including Iran, as posing a significant cyber threat against
the United States. The DNI specifically noted that Iran will continue to penetrate U.S. and
allied networks for espionage and to position itself for potential cyber-attacks. There is
also  concern  that  Iran  will  expand  its  influence  in  the  region  and  will  develop  military
capabilities that threaten U.S. forces.
In 2015, the Visa Waiver Program was amended. Under the amendment, citizens
of Iran, Iraq, Sudan, and Syria are ineligible to travel or be admitted to the United States.
The exclusion of these countries from waiver eligibility reflects that the presence of an
individual in that country increases the likelihood that the individual is a credible threat to
the  national  security  of  the  United  States,  that  a  foreign  terrorist  organization  has  a
significant presence in the country; or that the country is a safe haven for terrorists.
Iran has a poor human rights record. There are severe restrictions on civil liberties,
including  freedom  of  assembly,  association,  speech,  religion,  and  the  press.  Other
problems include abuse of due process combined with the use of capital punishment for
crimes  that  do  not  meet  requirements  for  due  process,  as  well  as  cruel,  inhuman,  or
degrading treatment and punishment; and disregard for the physical integrity of persons,
whom  authorities  arbitrarily  and  unlawfully  detained,  tortured,  or  killed.  There  are
numerous other human rights problems in Iran.
",False
"Applicant admitted the Guideline B allegations, without explanation. She is a 43-
year-old employed by a defense contractor most recently since June 2018 (Item 4). When
she  applied  for  a  security  clearance  in  June  2017  (Item  3),  she  was  unemployed.
Presumably, this was a pre-employment application, because, in July 2017, she went to
work  for  a  defense  contractor  for  whom  she  worked  until  September  2017,  when  she
enlisted in a reserve component of the U.S. military (Item 4).3  She previously served on
active duty in a different branch of the U.S. military from August 2002 to October 2008,
when  she  was  honorably  discharge  in  paygrade  E-4.  She  has  not  previously  held  an
industrial clearance, but held a clearance during her time in the military (Item 3).
Applicant was born in the Republic of the Philippines (RP) in January 1976. She
grew up and was educated there, obtaining her undergraduate degree in  April 1999. In
August 2000, she immigrated to the U.S., on an RP passport that would have expired in
May 2003, apparently on a fiancee visa.4  She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in August
2003,  at  which  time  she  surrendered  her RP  passport.  Her most recent  U.S.  passport
was issued in May 2012. She obtained an associate=s degree in a medical field in June
2017.
Applicant=s mother, a life-long homemaker, is a citizen of the RP, currently residing
in the U.S. She immigrated to the U.S. in June 2017, where Applicant is sponsoring her
for U.S. citizenship. Applicant=s retired father, two older brothers, one younger brother,
and one younger sister are resident citizens of the RP. Applicant has daily contact with
her mother, annual contact with her father and one older brother, monthly contact with
the other older brother, and quarterly contact with her younger brother and sister. She is
unaware of what her siblings do for a living.
Republic of the Philippines
The  Republic  of  the  Philippines  is  a  multi-party,  constitutional  republic  with  a
bicameral legislature. However, dynastic political families continue to monopolize elective
offices at the national and local level. There is widespread official corruption and abuse
of power. Authorities fail at times to maintain effective control over the security forces.
3I assume this was the original sponsor of her clearance. It appears likely that her application remained
active  after  she  left  this  employer  because  she  enlisted  in  a  reserve  component  of  the  U.S.  military.
Nevertheless,  her  current  defense  contractor  is  listed  as  her  sponsor  for  purposed  of  receiving  DOHA
communications.
4I infer this from the fact that Applicant listed her approximate date of entry into the U.S. as August 2000,
she was first married four days after arriving in the U.S., and was naturalized as a U.S. citizen exactly three
years laterCapproximately a year after enlisting on active duty in the U.S. military. She divorced her first
husband in October 2004.
Security forces commit human rights abuses to include extrajudicial killings and enforced
disappearances.
Other human rights problems include allegations of prisoner and detainee torture
and abuse by security forces; violence and harassment against human rights activists by
local  security  forces;  warrantless  arrests;  lengthy  pretrial  detentions;  overcrowded  and
inadequate  prison  conditions;  killings  and  harassment  of  journalists;  violence  against
women;  abuse  and  sexual  exploitation  of  children;  and  trafficking  in  persons.  The
government  continues  to  investigate  and  prosecute  only  a  limited  number  of  reported
human rights abuses, and concerns about impunity persist.
Long-running Muslim separatists and communist insurgencies continue to result in
the  displacement  of  civilians  and  the  killing  of  soldiers  and  police  in  armed  clashes.
Terrorist organizations such as Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), Jemaah Islamiya (JI), and the
New  People=s  Army  (NPA),  as  well  as  elements  associated  with  the  separatist  Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), continue to kill security forces, local government officials,
and other civilians. Although Philippines counterterrorism efforts sustained pressure on
terrorist  organizations,  its  members  are  suspected  to  have  carried  out  attacks  against
government,  public,  and  private  facilities,  primarily  in  the  central and  western  areas  of
Mindanao; others were linked to extortion operations in other parts of the country.
U.S. citizens contemplating travel to the Philippines should carefully consider the
risks to their safety and security while there, including the risk of terrorism.
None of the source documents submitted by the Government reflects that the RP
engages in economic or military intelligence activity directed toward the United States, or
that any of the terrorist groups operating in the RP seek protected U.S. information.
",True
"Applicant  is  62  years old,  and  he  was  born  in  Iraq.  In  1985,  Applicant  received
bachelor’s  degrees  in  medicine  and  surgery  from  a  Pakistani  university.  In  1989,  he
received a medical degree from an Iraqi university, and he received a master’s degree in
forensic medicine and pathology in 1991 from an Iraqi university. He married his wife in
1988, and they have two adult daughters. In 1997, he fled the Saddam Hussein regime
and  entered  the  United  States  through  Turkey.  Applicant,  his  wife,  and  children  were
naturalized in 2010. (Tr. 13-15, 22-26; GE 1; AE B)
Applicant has been working in Jordan for a defense contractor since approximately
February 2018 as a category I linguist and interpreter. He requires a clearance to become
a  category  II  linguist.  This  is  his  second  security  clearance  application.  He  previously
applied for a security clearance in 2011, but his sponsor lost the government contract,
and there was no final determination regarding his clearance eligibility. (Tr. 12-13, 27-30,
34; GE 1)
From  1985  until  1997,  Applicant  worked  for  the  Iraqi  Ministry  of  Health  as  a
forensic-medicine  and  general-practice  physician.  He  fled  Iraq  due  to  threats  from
Saddam Hussein’s government. Three months after he entered the United States illegally,
Applicant applied for political asylum. (Tr. 14, 22-26; GE 2 at 7; GE 3 at 1-2; GE 4 at 5)
Applicant  worked  on  behalf  of  defense  contractors  as  a  medical  advisor  and  a
medical translator in  Iraq  during  the  following  periods:  August  2006  to  February  2007;
March 2007 to November 2007; December 2007 to June 2008; February 2008 to May
2009; October 2010 to June 2011; and July 2011 to November 2011. While working in
Iraq he was in combat areas and subject to indirect fire. Applicant has not returned to Iraq
for personal reasons since he left in 1997, and he has not visited Iraq for any reason since
2011. (Tr. 29-33, 39; GE 4 at 33-41)
Three of Applicant’s four siblings are citizens and residents of Iraq. Additionally,
he has a brother who is a citizen of Iraq and a resident of Lebanon.  During his August
2017 interview, Applicant reported that he was estranged from his siblings because his
family does not accept his wife. While he was working in Iraq between 2006 and 2011,
he saw only one of his siblings (Brother A). (Tr. 34; GE 2 at 7; GE 3 at 2)
Brother A has been serving in the Iraqi military since 1983. He is a two-star general
responsible for coordinating the movement of Iraqi and U.S. forces. While Applicant was
working in Iraq, he worked with Brother A once every one or two months. Brother A is
aware  that  Applicant  has  been  a  linguist  and  translator  for  the  U.S.  military.  Applicant
testified  that  his  contact  with  Brother A,  while  he  was  in  Iraq,  was  only  related  to  their
military service and solely professional in nature. Applicant has not seen Brother A since
he left Iraq in 2011, and he has only communicated with him one time during a telephone
call in 2014. Applicant testified that he no longer gets along with Brother A to explain their
lack of communication for the past five years. (Tr. 39, 47-51, 62-63; GE 2 at 8; GE 4 at
14, 16-17, 45, 50)
Applicant’s Sister A and her husband are citizens and residents of Iraq. He last
saw her in 1997, and until 2014 he spoke to her two times a year via telephone. His last
contact with her was in 2014. Sister A is a housewife, her husband is a cargo shipper,
and neither she nor her husband have an affiliation with the Iraqi government. (Tr. 53-55;
GE 2 at 8-9; GE 4 at 47)
Applicant’s  Sister  B  and  her  husband  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Iraq.  She  is
employed by the Iraqi Ministry of Education as an art professor, and her husband is an
appliance dealer. Applicant last saw her in 1997, and he stopped communicating with her
in 2011. (Tr. 55-57; GE 2 at 9; GE 4 at 47)
Applicant’s Sister C is now a citizen and resident of the United States. Her husband
is a citizen of Iraq, and he moved from Lebanon to Iraq in 2017. He currently works with
Sister B’s husband in his appliance store. (Tr. 57-60; GE 2 at 9; GE 4 at 45, 47)
Applicant’s  wife,  daughters,  son-in-law,  and  two  granddaughters  are  all  citizens
and residents of the United States. His mother and two of his sisters are also residents of
the United States. Since 2017, Applicant has managed the eight rental properties that his
wife owns outright. Applicant and his wife have approximately 50% equity in their personal
home, which is worth about $700,000. He estimates that the collective equity in the rental
houses and their home is $1,000,000. They have approximately $45,000 in their savings
and checking accounts. Applicant testified that he is involved in his community, and he is
loyal to the United States. (Tr. 17-18, 26-27, 36-38, 41)
Applicant provided certificates of appreciation and letters of recommendation. He
is described as professional and dedicated. His level of medical and language expertise
was considered invaluable to the training of troops and the detection of detainee abuse.
Additionally, he submitted documents reflecting his completion of various DOD  training
in:  antiterrorism;  threat  awareness;  cyber  awareness;  information  assurance;  and  joint
staff operations security. (AE A; AE C; AE E)
Iraq
Iraq  is  a  constitutional  parliamentary  republic.  The  outcome  of  the  2014
parliamentary  elections  generally  met  international  standards  of  free  and  fair  elections
and led to the peaceful transition of power from former Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki to
Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi. (HE I)
The U.S. Department of State warns that travel within Iraq remains very dangerous
and  the  ability  of  the  U.S.  Embassy  to  assist  U.S.  citizens  is  extremely  limited.  U.S.
citizens in Iraq are at high risk for kidnapping and terrorist violence. Numerous terrorist
and insurgent groups are active in Iraq, including ISIS. Such groups regularly attack Iraqi
security forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias may also threaten U.S. citizens
and western companies throughout Iraq. (HE I)
Severe  human  rights  problems  are  widespread  in  Iraq.  Sectarian  hostility,
widespread corruption, and lack of transparency at all levels of government and society
weakened the government’s authority and worsened effective human rights protections.
Problems include harsh and life-threatening conditions in detention and prison facilities;
arbitrary arrests and lengthy pretrial detention; limits on freedom of expression to include
press,  social,  religious  and  political  restrictions  in  academic  and  cultural  matters;
discrimination  against  and  societal  abuse  of  women  and  ethnic,  religious,  and  racial
minorities; seizure of property without due process and limitations of worker rights. (HE I)

"The SOR alleges: in ¶ 1.a, that Applicant’s spouse is a citizen of China; in ¶ 1.b,
that Applicant’s father-in-law is a citizen and resident of China and owns a company in
China;  and  in  ¶  1.c,  that  Applicant’s  mother-in-law  is  a  citizen  and  resident  of  China.
Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations,  and  he  provided  some  clarifications,
extenuating,  and  mitigating  information.  His  admissions  are  incorporated  herein  as
findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make
the following findings of fact.
1  To  protect  Applicant  and  his  family’s  privacy,  the  facts  in  this  decision  do  not  specifically
describe  employment,  names  of  witnesses,  and  names  of  other  groups  or  locations.  The  cited  sources
contain more specific information.
Applicant  is  a  38-year-old  systems  engineer  employed  by  a  major  defense
contractor  since  December  2015.  (Tr.  6-7)  He  was  born,  raised,  and  educated  in  the
United States. (Tr. 25; GE 1) In 1999, he graduated from high school, and in  2003, he
received  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  aerospace  engineering.  (Tr.  6)  In  2006,  he  earned  a
in  aerospace  engineering.  (Tr.  6)  Defense  contractors  have
master’s  degree
sporadically employed him since 2006. (Tr. 25-28) He has not served in the military. (Tr.
7)
Applicant’s  31-year-old  spouse  was  born  in  China.  (Tr.  31)  She  received  a
bachelor’s degree in China. (Tr. 31) In 2010, she came to the United States to attend a
university and obtain a master’s degree in biology. (Tr. 32) She met Applicant in 2012,
and they married in 2013. (Tr. 7, 33) In 2013, she applied for U.S. permanent residence,
and in September 2018, she became a U.S. citizen. (Tr. 33-34; SOR response) When
she became a U.S. citizen, she took the Naturalization Oath of Allegiance to the United
States of America, which states:
I  hereby  declare,  on  oath,  that  I  absolutely  and  entirely  renounce  and
abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or
sovereignty, of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen;
that  I  will  support  and  defend  the  Constitution  and  laws  of  the  United
States  of  America  against  all  enemies,  foreign  and  domestic;  that  I  will
bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I will bear arms on behalf
of  the  United  States  when  required  by  the  law;  that  I  will  perform
noncombatant  service  in  the  Armed  Forces  of  the  United  States  when
required by the law; that I will perform work of national importance under
civilian  direction  when  required  by  the  law;  and  that  I  take  this obligation
freely,  without any  mental reservation  or purpose of evasion;  so  help me

spouse do not have any children. (Tr. 7, 33) She works in management for a  financial
company. (Tr. 29-30)
2  The  language  of  the  current  Oath  of  Allegiance  is  found  in  the  Code  of  Federal  Regulations
Section 337.1 and is closely based upon the statutory elements in Section 337(a) of the Immigration and
Nationality  Act.  U.S.  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Services,  8  U.S.C.  §  1448,  https://www.uscis.gov/us-

China
China  is  an  authoritarian  state  in  which  the Chinese  Communist  Party  (CCP) is
the  paramount  authority.  CCP  members  hold  almost  all  top  government  and  security
apparatus  positions.  Chinese  leaders  are  focused  on  developing  the  capabilities  they
deem necessary to deter or defeat adversary power projection and counter third-parties
including  the  United  States  in  conflicts.  China’s  military  modernization  is  producing
capabilities  that  have  the  potential  to  reduce  core  U.S.  military  technological
advantages.
The  National  Counterintelligence  Executive  has  identified  China  and  Russia  as
the  most  aggressive  collectors  of  U.S.  economic  information  and  technology.  China’s
intelligence services, as well as private companies and other entities, frequently seek to
exploit  Chinese  citizens  or persons  with family  ties  to  China  who  can  use  their  insider
access to steal secrets.
Agents  of  the  Chinese  Government  are  the  world’s  most  active  and  persistent
perpetrators of economic espionage. Chinese attempts to collect U.S. technological and
economic  information  continue  and  represent  a  persistent  threat  to  U.S.  economic
security. The nature of the cyber threat evolves with continuing technological advances
in the global information environment.
China  uses  its  intelligence  services  and  employs  other  illicit  approaches  that
violate  U.S.  laws  and  export  controls  to  obtain  national  security  and  export-restricted
technologies,  controlled  equipment,  and  other  materials  unobtainable  through  legal
means. Chinese agents have engaged in multiple criminal acts to obtain classified and
sensitive  information.  Chinese  agents  have  stolen  sensitive  military  information  and
violated  federal  export  control  laws  by  illegally  exporting  defense  equipment  to  China.
China  uses  its  cyber  capabilities  to  support  intelligence  collection  against  the  U.S.
diplomatic,  economic,  and  defense  industrial  base  sectors  that  support  U.S.  national
defense  programs.  The  information  targeted  benefits  China’s  defense  and  high-
technology industries and provides insights into U.S. leadership views on China issues.
Additionally, targeted information informs Chinese military planners about U.S. defense
networks, logistics, and related military capabilities.
China uses state-sponsored industrial and technical espionage to support military
research, development, and acquisition. The organizational network of China’s military-
industrial  complex  is  such  that  the  People’s  Liberation  Army  (PLA)  is  able  to  access
sensitive  and  dual-use  technologies  or  knowledgeable  experts  under  the  guise  of
civilian research and development.
In assessing the national security implications of the bilateral trade and economic
relationship  between  the  U.S.  and  China,  the  U.S.-China  Economic  and  Security
Review  Commission  has  reported  that  the  Chinese  government  has  conducted  large-
scale  cyber  espionage  against  the  United  States.  China  has  compromised  a  range  of
U.S.  networks,  including  those  of  DOD,  defense  contractors,  and  private  enterprises.
China’s  substantial  and  sustained  investment  in  defense  research  and  development
(R&D)  has  helped  China  improve  its  military-industrial  complex.  China’s  state-
sponsored theft of intellectual property and proprietary information has allowed China to
fill knowledge gaps in its domestic defense and commercial R&D.
Chinese  Government  repression  and  coercion  against  organizations  and
individuals involved in civil and political rights advocacy, and public interest and ethnic
minority issues occurs. Human rights concerns in China include: repression of speech,
religion,  association,  assembly,  the  press,  and  movement  for  certain  minorities;
extrajudicial killings; enforced disappearance and incommunicado detention; torture and
coerced  confessions  of  prisoners;  a  lack  of  due  process  in  judicial  proceedings;
searches  of  premises  without  warrants;  monitoring  of  communications  (including
telephone  conversations,  facsimile  transmissions,  e-mail,  text  messaging,  and  Internet
communications); and opening of domestic and international mail. Additionally, citizens
lacked the right to change their government and had limited forms of redress against the
government.
The  U.S.  Department  of  State  warns  visitors  to  China  that  they  may  be
interrogated  or  detained  without  information  about  their  alleged  crime.  Some  U.S.
citizens  have  been  held  in  China  based  on  an  “exit  ban”  for  years.  Hotel  rooms
(including  meeting  rooms),  offices,  cars,  taxis,  telephones,  Internet  usage,  and  fax
machines  may  be  monitored  onsite  or  remotely,  and  personal  possessions  in  hotel
rooms, including computers, may be searched without knowledge or consent.

"In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  she  admitted  all  the  allegations.  Her
admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  41-year-old  research  programmer  employed  by  a  defense
contractor since November 2016. She was employed in the private sector from August
2002  to  October  2011.  She  was  laid  off  and  unemployed  from  November  2011  to
October 2016. She has never held a security clearance.
Applicant was born in Russia. She came to the United States in November 1998.
She  attended  a  U.S.  university  from  September  2000  to  May  2002  and  received  a
bachelor’s  degree.  She  married  a  native  of  Russia  in  June  2005.  She  became  a  U.S.
citizen  in  April  2006.  Her  husband  is  a  dual  U.S.-Russian  citizen,  employed  as  an
information technology manager in the U.S. entertainment industry. (FORM Item 4 at 5.)
She and her husband have two children, who were born in the United States in March
2008 and February 2014 and are dual U.S.-Russian citizens.
Applicant’s  parents  and  sister  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Russia.  Applicant
maintains  dual  U.S.-Russian  citizenship  so  that  she  can  visit  her parents  and  sister  in
Russia  without  obtaining  a  visa.  (FORM  Item  4  at  1.)  Applicant  visited  her  family  in
Russian for 6-10 days in 2008; 21-30 days in 2009, 2010, and 2011; and more than 30
days in 2012, 2014, and 2015. (FORM Item 4 at 31-39.)
Applicant’s parents are both employed by a Russian building-material company.
Her  mother  is  a  manager  for  the  company  and  her father  is  a  director.  Her  sister  is  a
Russian  lawyer.  Applicant  has  daily  electronic  contact  with  her  mother,  weekly
electronic contact with her father, and weekly electronic contact with her sister. (FORM
Item 4 at 5-6.)
Applicant’s  mother-in-law  and  father-in-law  are  dual  U.S.-Russian  citizens  and
live in the United States. Her father-in-law previously worked as a scientist for a Russian
clean-water company. Her mother-in-law has not previously  worked outside the home,
except for work as a German translator. (FORM Item 4 at 6.) There is no evidence that
Applicant’s husband has any immediate family members or other persons with whom he
has ties of obligation or affection in Russia.
As  requested  by  Department  Counsel,  I  have  taken  administrative  notice  that
Russia is one of the top three most aggressive collectors of economic information and
technological  intelligence  from  U.S.  sources.  Russia  uses  cyber  operations  as  an
instrument  of  intelligence  collection,  using  sophisticated  and  large-scale  hacking  to
collect  sensitive  information,  influence  the  political  process  in  the  United  States,  and
undermine Euro-Atlantic unity. Russian also uses commercial and academic enterprises
that interact with the West, recruitment of Russian immigrants with advanced technical
skills,  and penetration  of public and  private enterprises  by  Russian  intelligence  agents
to  obtain  sensitive  technical  information.  The  areas  of  highest  interest  include
alternative  energy,  biotechnology,  defense  technology,  environmental  protection,  high-
end  manufacturing,  and  information  and  communications  technology.  Russian  agents
have been involved in intrusions affecting U.S. citizens, corporate entities, international
organizations, and political organizations in the United States. Significant human-rights
issues in Russia include extrajudicial killings; enforced disappearance; torture, including
punitive psychiatric incarceration; harsh prison conditions; arbitrary arrest and detention;
and lack of judicial independence. The Department of State has identified Moscow as a
high-threat location for terrorist activity directed at official U.S. Government interests.

"In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  some  of  the  allegations  with
explanations,  and  denied  others.  His  admissions  are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of
fact. After a thorough and careful review of the evidence, I make the following additional
findings of fact.
Applicant is 54 years old. He was born in Iraq in 1965. He earned two bachelor’s
degrees from Iraqi universities. He immigrated to the United States in 2008. He became
a U.S. citizen in 2014. His wife and children are U.S. citizens and residents. (Tr. 22, 29-
30; GE 1)
The SOR alleged that Applicant’s sister, brother, mother-in-law, and father-in-law
are  residents  and  citizens  of  Iraq.  It  also  alleged  Applicant  had  an  inappropriate
personal relationship with foreign military personnel while working  in Iraq in December
2017 and he had inappropriate contact with an Iraqi staff major general with whom he
served in the Iraqi Army.
Applicant  served  as  a  captain  in  the  Iraqi  Army  (mandatory)  from  1991  until  he
deserted  in  2003  just  before  the  start  of  Operation  Iraqi  Freedom  (OIF).  He  deserted
because he did not support the regime and refused to fight for it. After the war started,
he  volunteered  to  assist  U.S.  forces  as  a  linguist.  He  worked  with  various  units,
including  a  military  police  unit  at  a  forward  operating  base.  He  was  often  put  in
dangerous situations. When it became too dangerous for him and his family to remain in
the area, he left for Jordan in 2006. In 2008, with the help of a U.S. Army commander
who he had worked for, Applicant gained refugee status and immigrated to the United
States. In late 2008, he served as a linguist instructor for two months before deploying
to Iraq in January 2009 working as a contractor linguist for U.S. forces. He remained in
that  position  for  over  two  years  until  March  2011.  He  returned  to  the  United  States
because of his son’s medical needs. In 2016, he was hired to be a cultural role-player
for  the  Army  at  one  of  its  training  posts.  He  continued  with  that  position  until  he  was
hired  as  a  linguist  in  2017  for  a  position  in  Iraq.  He  remained  in  that  position  until
January  2019.  In  this  last  linguist  position,  he  served  for  over  a  year  as  the  primary
linguist  for  the  U.S.  general  (G1)  who  was  the  director  of  an  important  command
position. (23-25, 29-30; AE 1-2) G1 said this about Applicant:
[Applicant] readily accepted dangerous assignments accompanying me to
the  battlefield  on  multiple  occasions:  .  .  .  and  multiple  other  sites  where
accurate  communications,  physical  endurance,  and  bravery  were
prerequisites. . . . He had a place of trust on [my] staff in Baghdad and it
functioned more smoothly while he was there. (Ans.; AE B)
The successor general (G2) hand-picked Applicant to be his personal linguist. He
said this about Applicant:
[Applicant]  quickly  proved  to  be  a  trusted  advisor,  expertly  helping  me
navigate  the  minute  intricacies  of  Iraq’s  military  culture.  He  spent
numerous  long  nights  with  staff  Lieutenant  General  [A],  staff  Major
General [H] and myself providing superb translation as we discussed the
future  of  Iraqi  Security  Forces  and  the  combined  campaign  against  the
Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. (Ans.; AE D)
Applicant  denied  having  any  type  of  inappropriate  relationship  with  any  Iraqi
general  or  other  officer  as  alleged.  Applicant’s  denials  are  partially  corroborated  by
information  provided  by  G1  and  G2.  Applicant  pointed  out  that  he  communicated  with
the Iraqi generals often, but always at the direction of his U.S. general. He also denied
any other type of wrongdoing, such as taking unauthorized travel. The source of these
allegations comes from a U.S. Army counterintelligence memorandum from April 2018.
The conclusory memorandum does not state the source of the information. Additionally,
the  information  was  not  deemed  important  enough  to  open  an  investigation  into
Applicant’s  alleged  actions.  Applicant  theorized  that  the  source  of  the  damaging
counterintelligence  information  could  have  been  other  disgruntled  or  jealous  linguists.
(Tr. 33-35; 43; Ans.; GE 3-4; AE B, D)
G1  addressed  Applicant’s  working  relationship  with  the  Iraqi  generals  and  the
specter of co-worker jealousy in his letter of support:
His  relationship  with  me  and  other  superior  officers  in  the  [command
center]  due  to  his  consistent  superior  performance  caused  occasional
jealousy-driven friction in the interpreter pool. Because he earned the trust
of  both  the  Iraqi officers (he  himself  is a former officer of  the  Iraqi Army)
and  senior  coalition  officers,  he  had  access  to  both  and  occasionally
delivered messages from one to the other when we were most busy. To a
jealous  eye,  this  practice  may  have  appeared  to  be  an  inappropriate
relationship. The Iraqi Chief of staff, MG H, would ask [Applicant] to relay
to me his desire for a meeting, and I would do the same. In similar fashion,
MG  A,  my  close  counterpart  and  a  critical  figure  in  the  post  precarious
phases of the Iraqi defeat of ISIS, also trusted [Applicant] to interpret and
convey  precise,  timely,  and  sensitive  communication  at  the  highest
Coalition/Iraqi government levels. . . . I never witnessed any of the alleged
transgressions – unauthorized travel, misplaced loyalty, or condescending
behavior. (AE B)
When G2 assumed the command position after G1’s departure, he also had an
opportunity to work with and observe Applicant perform his linguist duties. He described
his dealings with Applicant as follows:
Throughout  his  tenue,  I  often  tasked  [Applicant]  to  converse  with
Lieutenant General A and staff Major General H on my behalf. He did so
with  utmost  distinction,  adhering  strictly  to  my  intent.  Never  once  did  he
falter  in  this  task,  and  he  always  provided  timely,  succinct  responses.  I
have  never  doubted  [Applicant’s]  dedication  to  the  United  States,  our
current  mission  in  Iraq,  or  his profession[alism].  Judging  him  solely  upon
the professional that he is, he has earned my utmost trust.
Applicant was wounded twice while performing his duties working for U.S. forces.
He  owns  no  property  in  Iraq.  His  wife  and  children  live  and  go  to school in  the  United
States.  Applicant  would  put  the  interests  of  the  United  States  first  regardless  of  the
circumstances. (Tr. 27-28, 35, 48)
The current status of Applicant’s relatives listed in the SOR is as follows:
1.  Applicant’s  brother and  sister.  Applicant  has  no  ongoing  relationship  with  his
siblings  who  are  citizens  and  reside  in  Iraq.  .  He  has  not  spoken  to  them  in  over  10
years. He does not know where they reside in Iraq. His estrangement is due to a family
dispute years ago. (Tr. 31, 47; Ans.)
2.  Applicant’s  mother-in-law  and  father-in-law.  Applicant’s  father-in-law  is
deceased.  His  mother-in-law  is  a  citizen  and  resident  of  Iraq.  She  is  in  her  70s  and
Applicant does not keep in touch with her. She is unaware of what Applicant does or the
nature of his work.  (Tr. 32; Ans.)
Character Evidence.
In addition to the letters from G1 and G2, Applicant supplied character references
from other military officers, a noncommissioned officer (NCO), and a fellow Iraqi civilian
linguist. All described Applicant’s linguistic skills and other positive character traits, such
as  honesty  and  being  a  team  player,  which  made  him  a  valuable  asset.  His  abilities
were  deemed  so  vital  that  he  was  denied  his  entitled  leave  during  a  critical  time.  G1
later  asked  that  his  leave  be  restored.  Several  noted  that  Applicant  was  disliked  by
some  of  his  peers  whose  complaints  about  him  were  meritless.  Several  officers
recommended that his clearance be restored. (AE A-J)
Administrative Notice.
The  U.S.  State  Department  warns  U.S.  citizens  against  travel  to  Iraq  as  travel
within the country remains dangerous. The U.S. Embassy warns that U.S. citizens are at
high  risk  for  kidnapping  and  violence  and  to  avoid  all  but  essential  travel  to  Iraq.  The
U.S. government considers the potential threat to U.S. government personnel in Iraq to
be serious enough to require them to live and work under strict security guidelines. The
Islamic  State  of  Iraq  and  Levant  (ISIL)  remained  the  greatest  terrorist  threat  globally,
maintaining a formidable force in Iraq and Syria. (HE II)

Guideline B – Foreign Influence
Applicant  was  born  in  Hong  Kong  in  1977.    He  grew  up  there  before  he,  his
mother, and brother came to the United States in 1995.  Applicant’s aunt and uncle, his
mother’s  siblings,  were  already  living  in  the  United  States  and  sponsored  Applicant’s
family to come to the U.S. Applicant went to live with his aunt, and his brother lived with
their uncle, while his parents were still situating.   Applicant became a naturalized U.S.
citizen  in  2001.    Applicant’s  father  was  a  retailer,  but  was  not  the  primary  financial
provider for their family.  He did not move to the United States until 1996, and became a
naturalized  U.S.  citizen  in  2001.    Applicant’s  mother,  who  worked  as  a  nurse  in  Hong
Kong, traveled back and forth from Hong Kong to the United States until she retired in
2000.   She  then moved  to  the  United  States  permanently.   She  became  a  naturalized
U.S.  citizen  in  2005.    She  also  worked  as  a  clinical  nurse  in  the  United  States  for ten
years before retiring here.
Applicant  mother  and  father  are  dual  citizens  of  the  United  States  and  Hong
Kong.    Each  year,  they  customarily  spend  about  six  months  in  the  United  States,  and
six  months  in  Hong  Kong.    Applicant’s  mother  will  be  74  years  old  this  year,  and  his
father  just  turned  81.    They  reside  in  Hong  Kong  part-time,  as  they  find  that  because
Hong  Kong  is  more  condensed,  they  are  able  to  be  more  independent.    They  do  not
need help, as they are able to take public transit to get to where they are going.  In the
United States they had to learn to drive, and they are not good at it.  At this point in their
lives, their health is beginning to deteriorate, and they will continue to stay longer in the
United States, especially with the political protesting in Hong Kong, as they do not feel
safe to go back there.  (Tr. p. 38.)  Applicant’s parents own a house in Hong Kong and a
house in the United States.  As his parents get older, they ultimately plan to live in the
United States full time.
Applicant became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 2001.  (Tr. p. 29.)
He obtained his college degree here.  He is married to a naturalized U.S. citizen and his
daughter was born in the United States.  Since then, he has traveled to Hong Kong or
China  about  three  times  for  vacation  and  on  each  occasion  he  stays  no  longer  than
three weeks.  (Tr. p. 30.)  His most recent trip to Hong Kong was in March 2018.  Before
Applicant  received  his  U.S.  passport,  he  used  his  ID  card  issued  by  the  Chinese
government  to  enter  Hong  Kong.    After  he  received  his  U.S.  passport  and  since
applying for a security clearance he only  uses his U.S. Passport.  He states that he is
willing to surrender his foreign ID card and renounce his Hong Kong citizenship.  (Tr. p.
51.)  When he travels to Hong Kong he stays at his in-laws house where his brother-in-
law  lives.    His  in-laws  reside  in the  United  States.    Applicant’s  mother-in-law  is a  U.S.
citizen and his father-in-law is a green card holder, or permanent legal resident.  (Tr. p.
31.)  Applicant has little or no contact with his brother-in-law in Hong Kong.
Applicant  also  has  two  long-time  friends,  he  considers  to  be  his  best  friends  in
Hong Kong that he maintains contact with through messaging and texting.  One he has
known since junior high school, the other is a childhood friend.  One works in the quality
control  department  for  a  barbeque  grill,  the  other  sells  water  filters.    Neither  of  them
have  any  connections  or  affiliation  with  the  Chinese  government.    They  know  that
Applicant  works  for  a  defense  contractor  and  that  he  is  an  Electrical  Engineer.
Applicant messages one of them weekly, the other less frequently.
Applicant  has  also  formed  close  friends  since  relocating  to  the  United  States.
Over the years, he has also established some wealth and purchased a house.
Applicant credibly testified that he cannot be coerced into divulging any national
security secrets.   He also stated that he believes that his limited relationships with any
of  his  family  members  or  friends  in  Hong  Kong  cannot  threaten  him  to  do  anything
against  the  interests  of  the  United  States.    Applicant  has  never  been  approached,
confronted,  or  contacted  by  any  foreign  entity  attempting  to  obtain  protected
information.  In the event that this ever occurs, Applicant stated that he will immediately
contact the DoD security officer and report the incident.  (Tr. pp. 53-54.)
Performance appraisals of the Applicant for the years 2016, 2017, 2018 and part
of 2019 reflect that he has consistently exceeded job requirements.  (Applicant’s Post-
Hearing Exhibits 1 through 5.)
Letters  of  reference  from  two  of  Applicant’s  managers  attest  to  his  honesty,
integrity,  hardworking  nature  and  trustworthiness.    He  is  considered  to  be  an  asset  to
their company and the United States.  (Applicant’s Post-Hearing Exhibits 6 and 7.)
Notice
foreign
technical
information  by
I  have  taken  administrative  notice  of  the  following  information  concerning  the
People’s Republic  of China  (China).     Targeting  and  collection  of  US  political, military,
intelligence  services  continues
economic,  and
unabated.  China is one of the most aggressive collectors of U.S. economic information
and technology.  China’s intelligence services, as well as private companies and other
entities, frequently seek to exploit Chinese citizens or persons with family ties to China
who can use their insider access to corporate networks to steal secrets using removable
media  devices  or  e-mail.    Chinese  actors  are  the  world’s  most  active  and  persistent
perpetrators  of  economic  espionage.    Chinese  attempts  to  collect  U.S.  technological
and economic information will continue at a high level and will represent a growing and
persistent threat to U.S. economic security.   The nature of the cyber threat will evolve
with continuing technological advances in the global information environment.  (HE 2)
I  have  also  taken  administrative  notice  of  the  following  information  concerning
Hong Kong.  Hong Kong is a presidential-limited democracy and special administrative
region of the People’s Republic of China with a population of over 7 million people.  As
a special administrative region, its foreign relations and defense are the responsibility of
China.   However, Hong Kong is a customs territory and economic entity separate from
China  and  is  able  to  enter  into  international  agreements  on  its  own  behalf  in
commercial,  economic,  and  certain  legal  matters.    The  United  States  and  Hong  Kong
have  enjoyed  a  robust  relationship,  as  stated  in  the  U.S.  –  Hong  Kong  Policy  Act  of
1992  and  grounded  in  the  determination  to  promote  Hong  Kong’s  prosperity,  freedom
and  way  of  life.    The  United  States  enjoys  substantial  economic  ties  with  Hong  Kong
and  U.S.  companies  generally  have  a  favorable  view  of  Hong  Kong’s  business
environment.    Hong  Kong  is  an  independent  body  from  China,  participates  as  a  full
member  of  several  international  economic  organizations  such  as  The  World  Trade
Organization,  Asian-Pacific  Economic  Cooperation  Forum  and  Financial  Action  Task
Force.      The  Government  of  Hong  Kong  generally  respects  human  rights  of  residents
and the law and judiciary generally provide an effective means of dealing with individual
instances  of  abuse.    The  basic  law  in  Hong  Kong  provides  for  the  protection  against
human  rights  abuses.    There  is  freedom  of  speech,  of  the  press,  and  of  publication.
Additionally,  Hong  Kong’s  basic  law  protects  the  citizen’s  freedom  of  expression,
freedom  of  peaceful  assembly,  freedom  of  religion,  and  freedom  of  movement.    Hong
Kong has also passed laws to combat discrimination and is clearly committed to liberty,
justice, and fair treatment, of their citizens through an effective government framework.
Hong  Kong  is  a  global  partner  to  the  United  States  and  shares  much  of  the  same
human rights and economic views.  There are more than 1,300 U.S. firms in Hong Kong
and approximately 85,000 American residents in Hong Kong.   (HE 1)

"Applicant  admitted  the  allegations  of  the  SOR.  He  is  a  73-year-old  linguist
employed by a defense contractor since July 2017. He was previously employed by this
same  company  from August  2011 to  September 2013,  when he had to  take extended
medical  leave  because  of  a  heart  attack.  He  has  not  previously  held  a  clearance,  but
underwent  counter-intelligence  screenings  in  approximately  August  2011  and  August
2017 (GE 2). During his first tenure with the company, he traveled to Afghanistan on U.S.
Government business from August 2011 to May 2012, May 2012 to May 2013, and May
to October 2013.
Applicant  was  born  in  Afghanistan  in  March  1946.  He  grew  up  there  and  was
educated there until September 1965, when he went to another university to undertake a
master=s degree, which he obtained in February 1972. He returned to the same university
in September 1974 to undertake a doctoral degree, which he obtained in March 1979.
From 1972 through 2000 and again from 2002 to 2005 he worked in the Afghan Ministry
of Education (SOR 1.c). Most of his time with the ministry was spent as a professor at a
Kabul university. Applicant and his family fled to Pakistan in 2000, when the Taliban took
over Afghanistan. They returned, at the invitation of the new Afghan government, After
the U.S. invasion to overthrow the Taliban after 9//11.
Applicant  and  his  wifeCa  dual  citizen  of  Afghanistan  and  the  U.S.  residing  with
ApplicantCmarried  in  Afghanistan  in  November  1979.  They  have  two  children  born  in
Afghanistan: a son born in 1980 and a daughter born in 1988. Both are naturalized U.S.
citizens residing in the U.S. Applicant=s parents are both deceased, as are his older and
younger brothers, and his in-laws. Applicant has a 20-month old grandson, born in the
U.S.
Applicant=s  spouse  worked  in  the  Afghan  diplomatic  corps.  From  2002  to  2005,
she served in the Afghan Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Then, she was posted as the Afghan
Ambassador to another country from 2005 to 2008 (SOR 1.a) During that time, Applicant
was  unemployed.  He  volunteered  to  provide  technical  support  to  his  wife=s  office
whenever there was an issue with their computer systems (SOR 1.c).
Rather than return to Afghanistan after his wife=s term as ambassador to another
country  ended  in  March  2008,  Applicant  and  his  wife  immigrated  to  the  U.S.,  on  their
Afghani  diplomatic  passports,  without  the  knowledge  or  permission  of  the  Afghan
government.. In April 2008, they applied for political asylum because of the political and
military  situation  in  Afghanistan.  Asylum  was  granted.  As  required  by  U.S.  and
international law, they maintained their Afghan passportsCno longer diplomatic. Applicant
applied for U.S. citizenship in June 2014, and became a naturalized citizen in December
2014 (GE 2). His U.S. passport was issued in January 2015, and expires in January 2025
(GE 1). All his Afghan passports have expired, the most recent one in June 2016, having
been issued in June 2011.
in  Applicant=s  August  2017  counter-intelligence
Sometime  between  2015  and  2017,  Applicant  was  contacted  by  a  named
individual who was then the Afghan Minister to the U.S. Applicant has been inexact at
best  about  when  that  contact  actually  occurred.  Applicant=s  issue  is  that  the  named
individual  who  Applicant  insists  made  the  contact  was  Ambassador  to  the  U.S.  from
February 2011 to February 2015 (independently verified), and the named Ambassador
that  appears
investigation  was
Ambassador  from  September  2015  to  August  2018  (independently  verified)  (GE  2).
Applicant  asserts  that  he  does  not  know  the  second  Ambassador,  and  that  the  first
Ambassador reached out because he had been Applicant=s student while in college. His
wife had also been friend=s in Afghanistan with the Ambassador=s family. Applicant and
his  wife  met  with  the  first  Ambassador  at  the  Afghan  embassy  to  have  tea  and
congratulate him on his appointment (SOR 1.d). Readily available information confirms
that the first Ambassador is closer in age to Applicant and also graduated from the same
university  in  Kabul  where  Applicant  taught,  while  the  second  Ambassador  is  much
younger than Applicant, and his educational history in Afghanistan is unknown. I conclude
that Applicant was referring to the first Ambassador when he discussed his and his wife=s
contact with the current Ambassador to the U.S. In any event, Applicant had no further
contact  with  this  Ambassador;  although  Applicant  later  correctly  learned  that  this
Ambassador later became the Afghan Ministry of Finance before stepping down in 2018
(independently verified).
Applicant and his wife have no financial interests in Afghanistan. Applicant has no
contacts in Afghanistan that are not part of his official U.S. Government business. When
he travels to Afghanistan he never leaves the U.S. base where he is posted, and his job
is  to  interview  prisoners  brought  in  for  questioning.  Applicant=s  wife  has  no  continuing
contacts in Afghanistan. She traveled to Afghanistan to visit some distant relatives on her
father=s side in 2015.
Afghanistan
The United States Department of State=s travel warning for Afghanistan remains in
effect and it warns U.S. citizens against travel there because of continued instability and
threats  by  terrorist  organizations  against  U.S.  citizens.  Travel  there  is  unsafe  due  to
ongoing risk of kidnapping, hostage-taking, military combat operations, and armed rivalry
between  political  and  tribal  groups,  militant  attacks,  suicide  bombings,  and  insurgent
attacks.  These  attacks  may  also  target  Afghan  and  U.S.  Government  convoys  and
compounds, foreign embassies, military installations, and other public areas.
As recently as December 2018, the U.S. Embassy in Kabul warned U.S. citizens
in Afghanistan of reports that militants plan to conduct attacks against hotels, compounds,
international organizations, universities, airports and other locations frequented by U.S.
citizens and other foreign nationals.
Extremists associated with various Taliban networks, the Islamic State in Iraq and
Syria (ISIS), and members of other armed opposition groups are active throughout the
country. These terrorist groups routinely attack Afghan, coalition forces, and U.S. targets
with  little  regard  for  or  the  express  intent  to  cause  civilian  casualties.  Due  to  security
concerns, unofficial travel to Afghanistan by U.S. Government employees and their family
members is restricted and requires prior approval from the State Department
.
Afghanistan  continues  to  experience  aggressive  and  coordinated  attacks  by
different terrorist groups. These groups remain active and were able to conduct a number
of high-profile, mass-casualty attacks in Kabul against sectarian and Afghan government
targets. They continue to plan such attacks against U.S. and coalition forces and Afghan
interests. Border regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan remain safe havens for terrorists.
The Afghan government struggles to assert control over this remote region.
According  to  a  June  2017  U.S.  Department  of  Defense  report  on  Afghanistan,
Afghanistan faces a continuing threat from as many as 20 insurgent and terrorist networks
present  and  operating  in  the  Afghanistan-Pakistan  region,  in  what  is  the  highest
concentration of extremist and terrorist groups in the world.
The State Department=s report on human rights for Afghanistan notes there was
widespread violence, including indiscriminate attacks on civilians and killings of persons
affiliated with the government by armed insurgent groups, widespread disregard for the
rule of law, and little accountability for those who committed human rights abuses. There
was also targeted violence and endemic societal discrimination against women and girls.
Afghanistan remains an important partner of the United States in the fight against
terrorism,  working  with  the  U.S.  to  eliminate  terrorist  groups.  The  U.S.  Government
continues  to  invest  resources  to  help  Afghanistan  improve  its  security,  governance,
institutions, and economy. The U.S. Government has a strong bilateral partnership with
the Afghan government.

Guideline B
Applicant’s  mother  (age  59)  and  father  (age  69)  are  Kenyan  citizens  and
residents  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b).  They  reside  in  Nairobi,  the  capital  and  largest  city  of
Kenya.  Her  father  is  a  retired  journalist  with  former  affiliations  with  the  Kenyan
parliament  and  magistrate  courts.  Her  mother  runs  a  non-government  organization
(NGO).  Without  specifying  which  entities  fund  the  NGO,  Applicant  claimed  that  her
mother  is  not  affiliated  with  any  foreign  government.  She  communicates  with  each  of
her parents weekly. (Item 3 at 25-28; Item 7 at 4)
Applicant has four siblings. Sister 1 (age 34) and Brother 1 (age 31) are Kenyan
citizens and residents (SOR ¶¶ 1.c and 1.d). They also reside in Nairobi. Sister 2 (age
31) and Brother 2 (age 27) are Kenyan citizens residing in the United States. Sister 1 is
a  legal  counsel  in  the  office  of  the  Attorney  General  of  Kenya.  Her  other  siblings  are
students. She communicates with Sister 1 and Brother 1 monthly. (Item 3 at 28-33; Item
7 at 4-5, 11)
Applicant  has  close  and  continuing  contact  with  three  friends  who  are  Kenyan
citizens  and  residents.  (SOR  ¶  1.e).  The  record  did  not  specify  in  which  city  these
friends reside. Friend 1 is employed as a manager by a British multinational investment
bank and financial services company. Friend 2 is a member of the clergy at a church in
Nairobi. Neither Friend 3’s employment status nor job title was specified in the record.
She communicates with her friends monthly. (Item 3 at 36-37, 41-42; Item 7 at 6-8)
Applicant travelled to visit family and friends in Kenya in 2011, 2012, and 2017.
She  reported  “in  person”  communications  with  her  parents,  Sister  1,  Brother  1,  and
Friend 1 but did not specify whether they occurred outside of Kenya. Her one in-person
visit with Friend 3 occurred in the United States in 2016. (Item 3 at 9, 25-31, 36-37, 47-
48; Item 7 at 8)
Applicant has owned a home in the United States since 2010. She is now renting
a home in another state, while Sister 2 and Brother 2 reside there.  The record did not
specify what, if  any, equity Applicant has in the home, or  whether she owns  any other
U.S. assets. She co-owns with her mother a dormant bank account, with a $0 balance,
in Kenya. She does not maintain any other foreign financial interests. (Item 3 at 10, 43-
44; Item 7 at 3, 10-11)
Applicant sent approximately $500 per month to her mother over an unspecified
number  of  years  for  her  financial  support  and  to  assist  in  paying  school  fees  for  her
siblings.  As  of  2017,  she  sent  a  total  amount  of  approximately  $10,000.  It  was
unspecified  in  the  record  whether,  in  what  amount,  and  for  how  long  she  intended  to
continue sending money to her mother. (Item 3 at 44-45; Item 7 at 11)
Guideline F
Applicant  has  nine  unresolved  delinquent  debts  totaling  approximately  $32,010
(SOR  ¶¶ 2.a  through 2.i).  She  denied all  but  one of  them  in  her  SOR  answer, without
explanation.  Applicant  claimed  that  her one admitted debt  (SOR  ¶  2.c/$461) would  be
settled by April 2019, without providing any documentary proof. While one debt (SOR ¶
2.g/$3,003) showed a $0 balance on her January 2019 credit report, it was not reported
therein as paid. (Item 5 and 6)
Applicant stated, without further explanation, that she fell behind on payments to
certain  creditors  during  an  unspecified  period  due  to  being  “overwhelmed  with  debt.”
She  also  stated  that  during  her last two  years of  college,  she fell  behind  on her home
mortgage payment and it went into collections. That mortgage is now in good standing
and  was  not  alleged  in  the  SOR.  In  November  2018,  Applicant  described  her  overall
financial situation as “okay” and averred that she was meeting her financial obligations
on time “for the most part.” (AE A; Item 7 at 11-12)
Administrative Notice (Kenya)
I  have  taken  administrative  notice  of  the  U.S.  Government’s  pronouncements
concerning Kenya, as outlined in its Request for Administrative Notice (Item 4) and the
documents appended thereto, including the following:
  Kenya  is  a  republic  with  three  branches  of  government:  an
executive  branch,  led  by  a  directly  elected  president;  a  bicameral
parliament  consisting  of  the  Senate  and  the  National  Assembly;
and a judiciary. (Item 4: Item I at 1)
  There  is  considerable  risk  from  terrorism  in  Nairobi.  Terrorism
remains a high priority concern. The U.S. government continues to
receive  information  regarding  potential  terrorist  threats  aimed  at
U.S.,  Western,  and  Kenyan  interests  in  the  Nairobi  area,  counties
bordering  Somalia,  and  in  the  coastal  areas  including  Mombasa
and Malindi. (HE I at 2)
  Kenya  is  a  strong  U.S.  partner  in  counterterrorism  investigation,
prosecution,  and  incident  response,  and  continued  to  play  an
important  role  in  regional  counterterrorism  cooperation.  Reports  of
human  rights  violations  by  security  forces  during  counterterrorism
operations  continued, including  allegations  of  extra-judicial killings,
disappearances,  and  torture.  Coordination  among  the  Kenyan
governmental  agencies  with  counterterrorism
functions  was
uneven,  with  improved  information  sharing  in  some  cases  and
failure  to  appropriately  pass  threat  information  in  others.  Overall,
resource  constraints,  insufficient  training,  corruption,  and  unclear
command  and  control  hindered  effectiveness.  (Item  4:  Item  IV  at
24-25, 26)
in
  Despite  public  progress
fighting  corruption,
the  Kenyan
government  does  not  implement  relevant  laws  effectively,  and
officials  frequently  engaged  in  alleged  corrupt  practices  with
impunity. Bribery is the most commonly reported type of corruption.
Police  corruption  remains  a  significant  problem.  (Item  4:  Item  I  at
29-30)
  Human rights issues with the Kenyan government include: unlawful
and  politically  motivated  killings;  forced  disappearances;  torture;
harsh  and  life-threatening  prison  conditions;  arbitrary  arrest  and
detention;  an  inefficient  judiciary;  arbitrary  infringement  of  citizens’
privacy  rights;  censorship;  lack  of  accountability  in  many  cases
involving  violence  against  women,  including  rape  and  female
genital  mutilation/cutting;  and  criminalization  of  same-sex  sexual
conduct. (Item 4: Item I at 1)
I  sua  sponte  admitted  to  the  record,  as  HE  I,  the  following  updated  source

"In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  denied  the  Guideline  E  allegation  and
admitted the Guideline H allegations with explanations. His admissions are incorporated
into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the evidence, I make the
following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 49 years old. He is a native-born U.S. citizen. His father was a major
in  the  U.S.  Army.  He  is  the  owner  and  chief  executive  officer  (CEO)  of  his  own
business.  He  has  a  bachelor’s  degree  from  a  U.S.  university.  He  has  never  held  a
security clearance. He married for the second time in 2016. He was married to his first
wife from 1998 to 2009. He has three children, ages 19, 17, and 16.  His ex-wife, wife,
and children are U.S. citizens and residents. (Tr. 6, 39; GE 1)
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant’s  ownership  and  control  over  an  information
systems  (IT)  company  located  in  India  create  a  conflict  of  interest  under  Guideline  B.
The SOR further alleged under Guideline H that Applicant used marijuana with varying
frequency  from  October  1988  to  February  2017,  and  that  Applicant  stated,  in  August
2018, his intent to continue using marijuana in the future.
Foreign Influence
In  2009,  Applicant  became  the  sole  owner  of  his  U.S.-based  IT  company  (C1),
which  has  customers  throughout  the  world.  C1  was  built  to  implement  out-of-the-box
packaged  software,  such  as  Oracle,  to  help  companies  improve  the  way  they  do
business.  Applicant,  through  C1,  also owns  an IT  company established  and  located  in
India (C2). Applicant describes C2 as merely a “tool” for his overall business to use to
reduce costs. Many large multinational companies such as Accenture, Deloitte, and IBM
use  the  same  business  structure.  C2  performs  technical  information  tasks  that  their
global  clients  require.  C2  is  a  virtual  company  which  has  no  servers  of  its  own  and
therefore  does  not  store  any  customer  data  itself.  The  Indian  government  has  no
regulatory control over C2. Applicant estimated the 2018 revenues for C1 at $18 million
and for C2 at $1.9 million. Applicant has never been to India. Applicant credibly  stated
that if C1 were to win a U.S. government contract with security implications, C2 would
be  excluded  from  any  participation  in  the  administration  of  that  contract.  C1  currently
has  such  contracts  with  other  U.S.  government  agencies  and  C2  is  excluded  from
participation in those contracts. (Tr. 22, 24-32, 34-36; Ans.; GE 2-3)
India
India  is  a  sovereign,  socialist,  secular,  democratic  republic.  It  is  a  multiparty,
federal  parliamentary  democracy  with  a  bicameral  parliament  and  a  population  of
approximately 1.1 billion.
The  Indian  government  generally  respects  the  rights  of  its  citizens,  but  serious
problems  remain.  Police  and  security  forces  have  engaged  in  extrajudicial  killings  of
persons  in  custody,  disappearance,  torture,  and  rape.  The  lack  of  accountability
permeated the government and security forces, creating an atmosphere in which human
rights violations went unpunished. A number of violent attacks were committed in recent
years  by  separatist  and  terrorist  groups.  In  November  2008,  terrorists  coordinated  an
attack at a hotel in Mumbai, frequented by westerners.
The  United  States  recognizes  India  as  key  to  strategic  interests  and  has
sought  to  strengthen  its  relationship  with  it.  The  two  countries  are  the  world’s
freedom  protected  by
largest  democracies,  both  are  committed

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions
in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 41-year-old systems analyst employed by a defense contractor since
March  2016.  He  was  born  and  educated  in  India.  He  entered  the  United  States  in
February  2008  to  accept  a  job  offer  from  a  U.S.-based  company.  He  became  a  U.S.
citizen  in  June  2015.  In  February  2011,  he  married  a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen,  who  is
employed as a business analyst and manager for a U.S.-based corporation. (Tr. 29.) He
and his wife have a five-year-old child. He has never held a security clearance.
Applicant testified that his immigration to the United States was the culmination of
a long-cherished dream that he held since childhood.  As a child, he was captivated by
books  and  television  programs  about  the  United  States.  As  he  grew  older,  he  was
“exposed  to  the  different  challenges  in  the  Indian  society,  widespread  poverty,  lack  of
education, superstitions, corruption in government and law enforcement, class systems,
general indifference towards human life, lack of respect for human life, bad infrastructure
[and] limited opportunities.”  (Tr. 20-21.) He and his wife have immersed themselves in
studying the history, culture, and government of the United States. (Tr. 24.) He grew up
in  a  lower  middle-class  family  in  India,  and  is  grateful  for the  quality  of  life  he  and  his
family now enjoy in the United States. (Tr. 24.)
Applicant’s mother and sister are citizens and residents of India. His mother has
never worked outside the home. (Tr. 33.) His father was a traffic controller for the Indian
railways,  and  he  passed  away  in  April  2019.  (Tr.  34.)  He  received  a  pension  upon
retirement, and Applicant’s mother now receives the pension. (Tr.38.)
Applicant  has  two  brothers.  One  is  a  citizen  and  resident  of  India  serving  as  a
colonel in the Indian Army as an infantry officer. This brother expects to retire from the
Indian Army in April 2020, when he qualifies for his pension. Applicant talks to him  by
telephone every other week. (Tr. 36-37.)
Applicant’s  other  brother  is  a  citizen  of  India  working  in  the  United  States  as  a
guest worker sponsored by a U.S. company. He has applied for a green card and intends
to remain in the United States. (Tr. 31.)
Applicant’s  sister  is  not  employed  outside  the  home.  She  is  married  to  a
pediatrician  in  private  practice  in  India.  (Tr.  26.)  She  and  her  husband  have  been
sponsored for immigration to the United States by Applicant’s brother-in-law. Applicant
talks to his sister by telephone weekly. (Tr. 32, 36-37.)
Applicant owns two condominiums and a parcel of undeveloped land in India. (Tr.
39.)  They  were  purchased  as  investment  properties.  (Tr. 44.) He signed  the  purchase
contracts for the two condominiums in 2007, purchasing one for about $30,000 and the
other  for  about  $25,000.  Both  were  under  construction  at  the  time.  He  completed  the
payments for both condominiums in October 2010, at which time he was given titles for
the property. The two condominiums are each rented for about $150 per month, which is
deposited directly into his mother’s bank account. (Tr. 40-43.) In April 2015, he purchased
a tract of undeveloped land in India for about $43,000. He testified that his only sources
of income for the past 11 years have been from the United States, except for the small
rental income from his investment properties, which is paid directly to his mother. (Tr. 25.)
Applicant and his siblings have an inheritance interest in their parents’ home, which is
worth about $100,000. (Tr. 44.)
In  a  post-hearing  submission  Applicant  stated  that  he  intends  to  sell  the  two
condominiums in India. The sales will require his presence in India, and he plans to travel
to India in November or December 2019 to complete the sales. (AX U.)
Applicant purchased his family home in the United States in December 2016 for
about $307,000. (AX H.) His balance on the mortgage loan is about $138,705. (AX I.) He
also  owns  two  condominiums  in  the  United  States  that  are  rental  properties.  He
purchased them in 2015 for $115,000 and $55,000. (AX J; AX L.) His net rental income
from  the  rental  properties  is  about  $800  per  month.  He  also  purchased  a  parcel  of
residential land in the United States for about $3,000, as an investment.  (AX K; AX P.)
There  are  no  unpaid  mortgage  loans  in  these  investment  properties.  (Tr.  45-46.)  In
September 2017, he purchased seven parcels of undeveloped land in the United States
for $245,000, borrowing $196,000 to make the purchase. (AX O.) He has about $70,700
in retirement accounts. (AX Q; AX R; AX S.) He owns one car worth about $15,000 on
which there is no loan. (AX T.) He estimates that he and his wife have about $100,000 in
cash and other assets. (Tr. 47.)
Applicant  is  highly  regarded  by  his  employer.  He  was  promoted  to  “systems
engineer”  after  14  years  of  experience,  instead  of  the  20  years  of  experience  that  is
usually required. (Tr. 19.) His performance is evaluated on a four-point system: (1) below
expectations;  (2)  meets  expectations;  (3)  exceeds  expectations;  and  (4)  far  exceeds
expectations.  His  evaluations  for  2016,  2017,  and  2018  rated  him  as  exceeding
expectations.  (AX  B;  AX  C;  AX  D.)  He  was  the  “Employee  of  the  Quarter”  for  the  4th
quarter of 2016, and the “Rookie of the Year for 2016. (AX E; AX F.)
The Republic of India is a federal parliamentary republic. Its government consists
of a president, prime minister, bicameral legislature, and a supreme court. Observers of
recent elections considered them fair and free despite isolated instances of violence. India
and the United States share interests in global security, stability, and economic prosperity.
The  United  States  supports  India’s  emergence  as  a  leading  global  power  and  a  vital
partner.  In  2018,  the  United  States  and  India  affirmed  India’s  designation  as  a  major
defense  partner  of  the  United  States  and  agreed  to  expand  defense  and  security
cooperation.  Indian  governmental  agencies,  private  companies,  and  individuals  are
frequently  involved  in  the  illegal  transfer  of  sensitive  data  and  dual-use  equipment  to
India. Several anti-Western terrorist groups are active in India. India experiences terrorist
attacks, including those by Pakistan-based terrorist organizations. Human-rights issues
include  widespread  corruption;  and  lack  of  criminal  investigations  or  accountability  for
rape, domestic violence, dowry-related deaths, and honor killings. A lack of accountability
at all levels of government contributes to widespread impunity and discrimination based
on religious affiliation, sexual orientation, gender identity, and caste or tribe.

SOR ¶ 1.a alleges and Applicant admits that his father is a citizen and resident of
Yemen, and the Yemen government employs or has recently employed him. (Tr. 44; HE
3) Applicant is unsure whether his father is currently working for the Yemen government

Yemen
The  Kingdom  of  Yemen  (colloquially  known  as  North  Yemen)  became
independent from the Ottoman Empire in 1918, and in 1962, became the Yemen Arab
Republic.  The  British  withdrew  in  1967  from  what  became  the  People’s  Republic  of
Southern  Yemen  (colloquially  known  as  South  Yemen).  The  massive  exodus  of
hundreds  of  thousands  of  Yemenis  from  the  south  to  the  north  contributed  to  two
decades of hostility between the states. The two countries were formally unified as the
Republic of Yemen in 1990.
Public  rallies  in  Sana’a  (Yemen’s  capital)  starting  in  late  January  2011  against
then  President  Ali  Abdallah  Salih,  inspired  by  similar  demonstrations  in  Tunisia  and
Egypt,  slowly  built  momentum.  In  November  2011,  Salih  signed  the  Gulf  Cooperation
Counsel  (GCC)  Initiative  to  step  down  and  to  transfer  some  of  his  powers  to  Vice
President Abd Rabuh Mansur Hadi.
Huthi  rebels  joined  forces  with  Salih,  culminating  in  a  major  offensive  against
military units and rival tribes and enabling their forces to overrun the capital. In January
2015, the Huthis surrounded the presidential palace. Hadi escaped to Oman, and then
moved  to  Saudi  Arabia  and  asked  the  GCC  to  intervene.  In  March,  Saudi  Arabia
assembled a coalition of Arab militaries and began airstrikes against the Huthis. Ground
fighting  between  Huthi-aligned  forces  and  resistance  groups  backed  by  the  Saudi-led
coalition continued.
Amid rising tensions between the Huthis and Salih, sporadic clashes erupted in
mid-2017, and escalated into open fighting that ended when Huthi forces killed Salih in
early  December  2017.  In  December  2018,  the  Huthis  and  Yemen  Government
participated  in  the  first  UN-brokered  peace  talks  since  2016.  In  April  2019,  Yemen’s
parliament convened for the first time since the conflict broke out.
The  United  States  Department  of  State  has  issued  a  Level  4:  Do  Not  Travel
Warning due to terrorism, civil unrest, health risks, kidnapping, and armed conflict. The
State  Department  reports  that  terrorist  groups  continue  to  plot  and  conduct  attacks  in
Yemen.  Terrorists  may  attack  with  little  or  no  warning,  targeting  public  sites,
transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and local government facilities.
Additionally,  there  is  a  continuing  threat  of  kidnapping/detention  by  terrorists,
criminal elements, and/or non-government actors. Employees of western organizations
may  be  targeted  for  attack  or  kidnapping.  No  part  of  Yemen  is  immune  to  violence.
Critical  levels  of  violence,  to  include  armed  conflict,  artillery  shelling,  and  air  strikes,
persist throughout the country. The U.S. Embassy in Sana’a suspended its operations
in  February  2015.  The  U.S.  government  is  unable  to  provide  emergency  services  to
U.S. citizens in Yemen.
In  December 2015,  President  Obama  signed  into  law  the  Visa Waiver Program
Improvement and Terrorist  Travel Protection  Act  of  2015,  which  amended  the existing
Visa Waiver Program. Under the 2015 amendment, citizens of  Yemen are ineligible to
travel  or  be  admitted  to  the  United  States  under  the  Visa  Waiver  Program.  The
exclusion of Yemen from waiver eligibility reflects the determination of the Secretary of
Homeland  Security  that  the  presence  of  an  individual  in  that  country  increases  the
likelihood  that  the  individual  is  a  credible  threat  to  the  national  security  of  the  United
States; that a foreign terrorist organization has a significant presence in the country; or
that the county is a safe haven for terrorists.
Throughout  2017,  al-Qa’ida  in  the  Arabian  Peninsula  (AQAP)  and  ISIS-Yemen
continued  to  exploit  the  political  and  security  vacuum  created  by  the  ongoing  conflict
between  the  Yemen  government  and  Houthi-forces.  AQAP’s  area  of  influence  has
increased since the onset of the civil war. A large security vacuum persists, which gives
AQAP and ISIS-Yemen more room to operate. Counterterrorism gains in 2017 removed
several key leaders and decreased AQAP’s freedom of movement, but AQAP and ISIS-
Yemen continue to carry out terrorist attacks throughout government-held territory. ISIS-
Yemen  remained  considerably  smaller  in  size  and  influence  compared  to  AQAP,  but
remained operationally active. ISIS-Yemen attacks increased in late 2017, exploiting the
tenuous  security  environment  in  Aden.  AQAP  and  ISIS-Yemen  terrorists  carried  out
hundreds  of  attacks  throughout  Yemen  in  2017.  Methods  included  suicide  bombers,
vehicle-borne  improvised  explosive  devices  (VBIEDs),  ambushes,  kidnappings,  and
targeted assassinations.
Yemen  does  not  have  comprehensive  counterterrorism  legislation  and  no
progress  was  made  due  to  the  state  of  unrest  and  the  fact  that  most  of  Yemen’s
government  remains  in  exile  outside  of  Yemen.  Due  to  a  lack  of  resources  and
organization, police forces throughout the country struggle to exert authority.
In  2018,  human  rights  issues  in  Yemen  included  unlawful  or  arbitrary  killings,
including  political  assassinations;  forced  disappearances;  torture;  arbitrary  arrest  and
detention;  harsh  and  life-threatening  prison  conditions;  political  prisoners;  arbitrary
infringements  on  privacy  rights;  criminalization  of  libel,  censorship,  and  site  blocking;
substantial  interference  with  freedom  of  assembly  and  association;  the  inability  of
citizens  to  choose  their  government  through  free  and  fair  elections;  pervasive
corruption;  recruitment  and  use  of  child  soldiers;  and  criminalization  of  consensual
same  sex-sexual  conduct.  Saudi-led  Coalition  airstrikes  resulted  in  civilian  casualties
and damage to infrastructure on multiple occasions. Non-state actors, including Houthis,
tribal  militias,  militant  secessionist  elements,  AQAP,  and  a  local  branch  of  lSIS,
reportedly committed significant abuses with impunity.

plans to obtain a PhD. His younger child is in high school and equally enthusiastic about
education. Applicant expressed his undivided allegiance to the United States, which he
considers his home. He credibly testified that his family and any property in India could
not be used to coerce or intimidate him into revealing classified information, and that he
would  report  any  attempt  to  do  so.  (Tr.  at  21,  31-37,  60-62;  Applicant’s  response  to

"Applicant, age 55, is married with two children, ages 18 and 16. He is a Chinese
citizen  by  birth.  He  entered  the  United  States  in  1993,  and  became  a  U.S.  citizen  in
2008.  His  wife  of  26  years,  also  born  in  China,  is  a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen.  Their
children  are  U.S.  citizens  by  birth.  He  received  bachelor’s  and  master’s  degrees  from
Chinese universities in 1985 and 1988, and his doctorate from a U.S. university in 1997.
Applicant  has  been  employed  as  an  engineer  by  a  U.S.  manufacturer  and  service
provider  for  jet  engines  since  2001.  This  is  his  first  application  for  a  DOD  security
clearance.
Applicant’s  father,  age  82,  is  a  resident  and  citizen  of  China  (SOR  ¶  1.a).  His
mother is deceased. She worked for a local government’s “clinic service” and his father,
who  retired  more  than  23  years ago,  worked  for  that  same  local government’s  “health
and family planning commission.” Neither their job positions nor the nature of their work
was  specified  in  the  record.  Applicant  communicates  with  his  father  weekly  by
telephone, and in person when he visits China. (Item 2 at 17-20, Item 3 at 6)
Applicant  has  one  sibling,  a  52-year-old  sister,  who  is  a  citizen  and  resident  of
China (SOR ¶ 1.b). She is employed as a researcher of Chinese medicine by a Chinese
university.  He  communicates  with  his  sister  telephonically  and  electronically  on  a
monthly basis, and in person when he visits China. Her marital  and family status were
not specified in the record. (Item 2 at 20-21; Item 3 at 6)
Applicant’s  mother-in-law  (MIL),  age  81,  and  father-in  law  (FIL),  age  85,  are
citizens  and  residents of  China  (SOR  ¶ 1.c).  His  MIL,  who  retired more than  24  years
ago, was employed by a Chinese commercial and industrial bank. His FIL, who retired
more than 23 years ago, was employed as a “vice chair” of a local government. Neither
his MIL’s job position nor the nature of her and her husband’s work was specified in the
record.  Applicant  communicates  with  them  telephonically  (and  also  electronically  with
his FIL) on a monthly basis, and in person when he visits China. (Item 2 at 21-24; Item 3
at 6-7)
After  becoming  a  naturalized  citizen,  Applicant  travelled  to  China  to  visit  his
family in 2009, 2011, 2013, 2016 (as of 2017). The record is silent as to how Applicant’s
father and parents-in-law are financially supported. Applicant reported that he gave both
sets of parents approximately $1,000 to $2,000 during each of his last four to five visits
to  China.  He  referred  to  those  sums  as  gifts,  which  he  provided  due  to  a  Chinese
tradition of supporting parents once a child reaches adulthood. (Item 2 at 27-28, 32-34,
41-42; Item 3 at 4 and 7)
Applicant’s wife’s brother (BIL) and his BIL’s wife (SIL) are citizens of China who
have  resided  in  the  United  Kingdom  (UK)  for  a  period  not  specified  in  the  record.
Applicant  communicates  with  them  in  person  approximately  every  five  years.  He  last
visited the UK in 2010, and his BIL last visited the United States in 2011 (as of 2017).
His SIL, age 51, is not employed outside the home. His BIL, age 52, is employed by a
British-Dutch  consumer  goods  company  with  no  government  affiliation.  Neither  his  job
position nor the nature of his work was specified in the record. Applicant averred that he
only communicates with them when he sees them in person. While the record indicated
that  they  have  one  or  more  children,  no  other  information  was  provided  about  them.
(Item 3 at 8 and 9)
Applicant  previously  maintained  contact  with  a  classmate  from  the  Chinese
university  where  he  obtained  his  bachelor’s  degree,  who  is  a  citizen  and  resident  of
China.  From  approximately  1982  or  1983  through  2009,  they  had  in-person  contact
approximately  once  every  few  years  during  his  visits  to  China.  They  have  not  had
contact since 2009 due to Applicant’s family members taking up all of his time when he
visits  China.  While  Applicant  stated  that  his  classmate’s  employer  was  unknown,  he
asserted  that  the  friend  had  no  affiliation  with  a  foreign  government,  military,  security,
defense industry, foreign movement, or intelligence service. (Item 3 at 5)
Applicant has owned his home since 2002. Neither he nor his wife and children
maintain  any  foreign  financial  interests.  Applicant  reported  that  none  of  his  family
members who reside in China have ties to the Chinese military or government agencies
which  involve  technologies  related  to  Applicant’s  employment.  The  record  did  not
specify how often or by what means Applicant’s wife has contact with her family. (Items
1 and 2)
In  his  SOR  answer,  Applicant  declared  that  he  wants  “to  make  contributions  to
this great nation I love so dearly, and for which I chose to live [sic] rest of my life and for
which  I  chose  to  raise  my  children  so  they  can  achieve  their  own  American  dreams.”
Without providing any specifics, he claimed that he had been “in good standing” during
all  the  years  that  he  has  lived  in  the  United  States.  He  also  argued  that  his  security
clearance  should  be  granted  because  “many”  of  his  work  colleagues  “with
background[s]  similar”  to  his  who  have  relatives  in  China  have  been  granted  one.  He
also  contended  that  his  case  is  “no  difference  [sic]”  to  theirs  and  that  he  should  be
“treated the same way as them.” He did not specify any other details about those cases.

"In  his Answer,  Applicant  admitted the  six  allegations  contained  in the  SOR.  His
admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact, below.
Applicant is 33 years old and unmarried. He was born in Iraq, graduated from high
school there in 2004, and then attended an Iraqi college for a short time. He lived in Iraq
until  September  2009,  when  he  immigrated  to  the  United  States  on  a  refugee  visa.  In
October  2013,  he  earned  an  associate’s  degree  at  a  junior  college.  He  became  a
naturalized U.S. citizen in February 2015. (Tr. 16-18; GE 1)
Prior to coming to the United States, Applicant worked for the British Army for a
year performing various tasks. He also worked as a technician for an Iraqi company. (Tr.
17, 24; GE 1)
Upon his arrival in the United States, Applicant was unemployed for six months
before obtaining a position as a cook in March 2010. In July 2010, he obtained his current
position as security guard for a private company. In May 2018, he applied for a linguist
position with a federal contractor. (Tr. 19-20, 24; GE 1)
Applicant lives with his brother and sister-in-law, and their four children. His brother
was born in Iraq and is a naturalized citizen and resident of the United States. He works
as  a  teacher.  Applicant  and  his  brother purchased  the  house  where  they  live  in  2014.
Applicant has a bank account in the United States. He does not have financial accounts
in Iraq. (Tr. 21-22, 27, 60)
Applicant’s elderly mother and father are citizens and residents of Iraq. His mother
has (or had) U.S. permanent residency. She periodically resided with Applicant and his
brother up to a year ago when she returned to live in Iraq and care for Applicant’s father,
who suffers from cancer. Applicant does not believe she will reside in the United States
in the future. (Tr. 30-31) Applicant speaks to his mother daily about her health and his
father’s  condition.  Applicant’s  father  is  a  retired  electrician.  He  worked  for  the  Iraqi
government  and  receives  a  pension.  Applicant  speaks  to  his  father  every  two  weeks,
sometimes  less  frequently  because  his  father  is  too  sick  to  talk  at  times.  (Tr.  36-38)
Applicant sends his parents about $200 quarterly to help with their medical expenses. He
sent some money a couple of weeks before the hearing. (Tr. 33-34, 37-38)
Applicant has five brothers, four of whom are citizens and residents of Iraq. These
four brothers are married and have children. One brother is employed as a police officer
with the Iraqi police department. Applicant communicates with this brother once a month.
(Tr. 39-42) One brother is a sergeant in the Iraqi army. Applicant speaks to him monthly.
(Tr. 44) Another brother, with whom his parents reside, works for a private IT company in
Iraq. This brother owns the home in which he and Applicant’s parents reside. Applicant
talks to him monthly. (Tr. 46-47) Applicant’s fourth brother works for a barbershop. His
brother was conscripted into the Iraqi army for a couple years. Applicant sent him $200 a
couple of months before the hearing because he was unemployed at that time. (Tr. 47-
50, 59)
Applicant has three sisters, who are citizens and residents of Iraq. One sister works
as an accountant for an Iraqi university. She is married and has children. Applicant speaks
to her monthly. His second sister is married and has children. She is a housewife and has
not worked outside of the home. He speaks to her monthly. His youngest sister is married
and has one daughter. She is a student and lives with her family. Applicant sent his niece
some money for school supplies. He speaks to his sister monthly. The occupations of his
sisters’ husbands are unknown. (Tr. 51-54)
Applicant’s cousin is a citizen and resident of Iraq. He is married and has children.
He is a police officer with Iraqi police department. Applicant speaks to him monthly. (Tr.
54-57)
All of Applicant’s siblings and cousin reside near Applicant’s parents. None of them
have visited him in the United States. When Applicant speaks to his family, they talk about
family matters and not personal things. None of these people are aware that Applicant is
applying for a linguist position. (Tr. 62-63)
Applicant has three friends who are citizens and residents of Iraq. None of them
are employed by the Iraqi government or military. He does not send them money. He talks
or texts them every couple months. They have never visited the United States. (Tr. 57-
58)
Applicant has returned to Iraq about six times since arriving in 2009. He went in
2011, 2013, 2015, 2016, and 2017. In April 2019, he visited his father whose illness is
progressing. Applicant generally stays for at least a month when he returns to Iraq. He
saw his siblings and one of his friends while there in April 2019. (Tr. 60-61, 66-68: GE 1)
In the spring of 2019, Applicant stopped communicating on a regular basis with his
girlfriend.  She  is  a  citizen  of  Iraq  and  Norway,  and  resident  of  Norway.  She  visited
Applicant in the United States in 2018. (Tr. 27-29) At that time, he told her that he was
applying for a linguist position and could return to Iraq to work. She does not want him to
do that. (Tr. 63-64)
Applicant said he would not tell his family or friends if he obtains a linguist position
and returns to Iraq. He said the area where his family lives is still not safe in terms of the
presence of terrorists. He does  not trust people living there. He stated that some Iraqi
people, who had assisted the British army in the past, were subsequently killed. Before
leaving for the United States in 2009, Applicant received a threatening letter for working
with the British army. He told his family about the letter. (Tr. 70-72)

"The SOR alleges under Guideline B that Applicant’s father is a U.S.-Egyptian dual
citizen,  who  resides  in  the  UAE  and  is  employed  as  a  civilian  contractor  for  the  UAE
military (SOR ¶ 1.a); that Applicant’s mother (SOR ¶ 1.b), one of his brothers (SOR ¶ 1.c),
and his grandmother (SOR ¶ 1.g) are U.S.-Egyptian dual citizens residing in Egypt; that
Applicant’s other brother (SOR ¶ 1.d) and  his sister (SOR ¶ 1.e) have dual citizenship
with Egypt and the U.S.; that Applicant’s cousin is a dual citizen of Egypt and Canada
residing in Canada (SOR ¶ 1.f); and that Applicant’s friend is an Egyptian citizen residing
in  the  UAE  (SOR  ¶  1.h).  Under  Guideline  C,  Applicant  is  alleged  to  have  expressed
divided loyalty between the U.S. and Egypt during his August 8, 2017 security interview
(SOR ¶ 2.a), and to have been employed by a foreign defense  company that supports
the UAE military from about May 2014 to November 2016 (SOR ¶ 2.b).
When Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, he admitted the Guideline B
allegations. In a detailed response, he explained that his father had retired two months
prior from his work as a pediatrician in the UAE and was  in the process of returning to
Egypt. He also indicated that his parents intend to move to the U.S., but currently have
family  obligations  in  Egypt  in  that  Applicant’s  mother  is  his  grandmother’s  caregiver.
Applicant  stated  that his siblings  in  the  U.S. show  no  interest  in moving  from  the  U.S.
Applicant  explained  that  his  friend  in  the  UAE  (SOR  ¶  1.h)  is  a  childhood  friend  from
Egypt, but they have no ongoing relationship and have had no direct communication in
over three years. As for the foreign preference concerns, Applicant denied that he has
divided allegiance. He admitted his previous employment for a defense contractor in the
UAE, but indicated that his work was not contrary to the interests of the U.S. (Answer.)
After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact:
Applicant  is  a  33-year-old  senior  software  engineer,  who  began  working  for  his
current  employer,  a  defense  contractor,  in  December  2016.  He  subsequently  left  the
employment of the company only to return (Tr. 62, 80), although the dates of his break in
employment are not in evidence.
Applicant was born into a well-educated, upper-middle-class Egyptian family. (Tr.
33-34.) His parents were both physicians then living in their native Egypt. As an officer in
Egypt’s military, Applicant’s maternal grandfather served a diplomatic posting in the U.S.
in the late 1970s, and Applicant’s mother attended graduate school in the U.S. (GEs 1-2;
Tr. 55-58.) Applicant’s mother may have acquired her U.S. permanent-residency status
around that time, although Applicant does not know for certain when she obtained her
“green card.” (Tr. 30.)
In early summer 1986, Applicant moved with his parents and his then only sibling,
a brother born in 1984, to the UAE for his father’s job at a UAE military hospital. (GE 2.)
On a date not clear in the record, his mother became employed at the same hospital. (Tr.
27.)  Within  a  few  years  of  their  move,  Applicant’s  parents  had  two  more  children:  a
daughter born in Egypt in 1988, and a son born in the UAE in 1990. (GE 1.)
Applicant  attended  private  school  in  the  UAE  where  the  instruction  was  in  the
German language. (Tr. 25.) In 1995, when Applicant was nine or ten years old, his mother
resigned from her employment in the UAE and moved with her children back to Egypt.
Applicant’s  father  stayed  in  the  UAE  working  as  a  pediatrician.  Applicant’s  mother
became a medical professor at an Egyptian university. (GE 2; Tr. 27.) Applicant’s friends
were of the same social and economic class as he in Egypt’s segmented society. (Tr. 33-
34.)
Applicant and his family  went to the UAE, about twice yearly during month-long
school breaks, to visit his father. During his childhood, Applicant also visited the U.S. a
few times. (GE 2.) After the terrorist attack of September 11, 2001, Applicant’s parents
became naturalized in the U.S. Applicant asserts that he and his siblings obtained U.S.
citizenship  as  minors  through  their  mother,  and  that  he  became  a  U.S.  citizen  in
December 2001. (Tr. 31-32.)
Applicant  attended  college  in  Egypt  from  September  2004  to  July  2009.  For  a
couple of weeks in summer 2009, Applicant visited his father in the UAE. His father was
employed by a company contracted to provide medical services for the UAE military. (AE
B.) In August 2009, Applicant came to the U.S. for graduate school. He was 23 years old
and  had  dual  citizenship  with  the  U.S.  and  Egypt.  He  did  not  register  with  the  U.S.
Selective  Service  because  he  was  unaware  of  the  requirement.  (GE  2;  Tr.  59-60.)  He
spent  the holiday  break from  December 2009  to  January  2010  and  the  summer break
from June 2010 to August 2010 in Egypt. He earned his master’s degree in December
2010  in  signals  processing  and  artificial  intelligence.  (GE  1;  Tr.  43.)  Applicant  went  to
Egypt  for  a  month  in  early  2011  and  then  returned  to  the  U.S.  to  seek  employment.
Applicant renewed his U.S. passport in January 2011 for another ten years. He used his
U.S. passport for foreign travel, including on several trips to Egypt. Applicant also held an
Egyptian passport until 2012. (GEs 1-2.)
From June 2011 to May 2014, Applicant was employed as a software-development
engineer for a small start-up communications company in the U.S. While in that job, he
submitted his Egyptian passport to his employer to obtain a clearance and was apparently
told his passport would be shredded. He does not know whether it was destroyed. (GE
2.) After over two years in the job, Applicant began a job search for financial and career
development reasons. He concentrated on jobs in the U.S., but after his father passed
around his resume in the UAE, he received and accepted a lucrative job offer in the UAE
at double his then salary and tax free. (Tr. 45).
In May 2014, Applicant moved to the UAE for a job as a network security engineer
with  a  UAE-based  contractor  that  provided  human  resources  services  for  the  UAE
military. To Applicant’s knowledge, the UAE government and not a corporate board made
the  decisions  for  the  company.  (Tr. 79-80.)  Applicant’s  duty  location  was  on  a  military
base in the UAE, and he worked on unclassified projects. Applicant lived with his father
rent free. Under the sponsorship of the UAE-based company, Applicant obtained a UAE
resident  permit  that  was  valid  from  May  2014  to  May  2016.  He  renewed  the  resident
permit in May 2018, but it was cancelled in November 2016, when he left the UAE for the
U.S. (GEs 1-2.) Applicant met an American woman in the UAE with whom he began a
relationship that led him, along with a desire to start a new life here, to return to the U.S.
They dated for awhile in the U.S. but eventually grew apart. (Tr. 45-47.)
In early December 2016, Applicant began working for his current employer in the
U.S. He was placed on a program that was understaffed, and according to Applicant, his
productivity saved the company “hundreds of thousands of dollars.” (Tr. 74.)
On  December  8,  2016,  Applicant  completed  and  certified  to  the  accuracy  of  a
Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). He disclosed  that he holds dual
citizenship  with  Egypt  and  the  U.S.,  and  explained  the  he  was  naturalized  in  the  U.S.
through his mother. He added that he obtained his U.S. passport in December 2001 and
that he currently held only his U.S. passport, having “submitted” his Egyptian passport to
a previous employer to obtain a security clearance in 2012. Under both the employment
and foreign military service sections, Applicant listed his employment with the UAE-based
contractor from May 2014 to November 2016 on a UAE military base. He explained that
he worked as a contractor in an information technology division of the UAE military where
he  “was  responsible for providing  Information  Security  recommendations  and Systems
architectures  to  maintain  confidentiality,  integrity,  and  availability  of  UAE  [military]
computer systems.” (GE 1.)
Applicant disclosed the Egyptian-U.S. dual citizenship of his parents and siblings.
He detailed that he had contact by telephone or electronic means (including online video
chat)  weekly  with  his  father  in  the  UAE  and  daily  with  his  mother  in  Egypt;  quarterly
contact with his brother in Egypt; and contact by telephone or electronic means (texting)
daily with his brother and weekly with his sister in the U.S. In response to an inquiry into
any close or continuing contacts with other foreign nationals in the last seven years with
whom  he  was  bound  by  affection,  influence,  common  interest,  or  obligation,  Applicant
reported  that  he  has  averaged  weekly  contact  by  telephone  or  text  with  a  cousin  with
Canadian-Egyptian dual citizenship residing in Canada. Applicant listed his foreign travel
in the last seven years, including to Egypt while he was living in the UAE to visit family or
friends in September 2014, May 2015, July 2015, July 2016, and October 2016. (GE 1.)
On August 8, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the
Office of Personnel Management (OPM). Applicant indicated that he acquired his  U.S.
citizenship and passport in 2001, even though he continued to live in Egypt until August
2009. Applicant stated that he has considered the U.S. his home since coming here in
2009  for  graduate  school.  Applicant  explained  that,  because  he  earned  his  bachelor’s
degree from an accredited  engineering program in Egypt he is eligible for an Egyptian
pension of less than $30 per month when he eventually retires. He denied ever voting in
an  Egyptian  election,  any  employment  in  Egypt,  and  any  service  in  Egypt’s  military,
explaining  that  his  status  as  a  dual  citizen  with  the  U.S.  disqualified  him  from  Egypt’s
military-service requirement. About his dual passports, Applicant could not recall whether
he had used his first U.S. passport issued in 2001, as he would have used his Egyptian
passport when  he  was  living  in  Egypt,  but  he  asserted  that  he used  his  U.S. passport
exclusively  since  August  2009.  He  denied  any  intention  to  reapply  for  an  Egyptian
passport. When asked where his ultimate loyalty lies, Applicant responded that his loyalty
is to his work, and because he studied in the U.S. and his career is here, his loyalty is to
the U.S., i.e., he finds value in his work, and he is loyal to his employer in performing his
job with quality. (Tr. 66-67.) He acknowledged that it was hard to say where his loyalty
lies, because he had not lived in any one place for a long time. However, he expressed a
sense  of  belonging  in  the  U.S.;  that  his  “concepts  and  work  ethic”  align  with  the  U.S.
Applicant  denied  any  sense  of  obligation  to  any  foreign  country,  including  Egypt,  but
admitted he is tied to his family in Egypt. (GE 2.)  He testified that he would not divulge
any sensitive information regarding his work for the U.S. military without proper approval.
(Tr. 67.)
About  his  work  as  a  contractor  for  the  UAE  military  on  a  UAE  military  base,
Applicant explained that he had “constant contact” with foreign government and military
employees, but his interactions with them were solely professional. He had both military
and  civilian  supervisors.  (Tr.  64-65.)  Although  the  UAE  government  investigated  his
background for an identity card to enter the military installation and to grant him the UAE
equivalent of a security clearance, he did not handle any classified information in his work.
He told the OPM investigator that he left the job in the UAE, which paid him $140,000 a
year, because he disliked the attitude among workers to take it easy and not work very
hard.  He  closed  a  bank  account  that  he  had  in  UAE  when  he  left  the  country  and
transferred $180,000 to $190,000 to the U.S. While Applicant was living in the UAE, he
mainly socialized with his father and with a group of friends from the U.S. whom he met
in  the  UAE,  including  his  then  girlfriend.  Applicant  updated  his  foreign  travel  since
completing  his  SF  86,  disclosing  that  he  had  traveled  with  his  girlfriend  to  Iceland  for
tourism in January 2017 and to Canada to visit his cousin in May 2017. Applicant denied
any unusual encounters during any of his international travels. (GE 2.)
Applicant  emailed  the  OPM  investigator  a  copy  of  all  of  the  pages  of  his  U.S.
passport issued in January 2011. The passport bore stamps that confirmed that he used
his U.S. passport for his international travel, including to enter and exit the UAE on various
dates  between  May  2014  and  December  2015.  As  of  August  2017,  his  U.S.  passport
contained  11  arrival  stamps  and  nine  departure  stamps  for  Egypt.  (GE  2.)  Applicant
traveled to Egypt most recently for three weeks in March 2019, using his U.S. passport.
(Tr. 72.)
Applicant’s father’s employment contract with the UAE-based company expired on
January  1,  2018,  but  his  residency  permit  in  the  UAE  was  renewed  to  maintain
continuation of service in the UAE through March 24, 2019. On February 27, 2019, the
UAE-based company reconfirmed the termination of his employment contract due to a
restructuring.  Applicant’s  father’s  “Labour  Card,”  which  was  issued  to  him  as  a  U.S.
passport holder and which authorized his employment in the UAE, was cancelled, and
his  employment  ended  on  March  24,  2019.  Applicant’s  father  currently  holds  a  U.S.
passport issued in December 2011 that is valid for ten years. (AE B.) Applicant’s father
moved back to Egypt sometime between late May 2019 and September 2019. (Tr. 36.)
Applicant has had weekly contact on average with his father, although their contact has
been less frequent lately. (Tr. 70.)
Applicant has daily contact with his mother, and monthly to once every two months
contact  with  his  grandmother,  who  “divides  her  time  up  on  22  cousins.”  (Tr.  71-72.)
Applicant testified that his parents intend to retire to the U.S., but his mother currently is
the primary caregiver for her mother in Egypt. (Answer; Tr. 37-38.) The record does not
indicate whether Applicant’s mother is retired from her position as a university professor.
Applicant’s parents, grandmother, and his mother’s sisters all live in the same building in
Egypt. (Tr. 33, 37-38.) Applicant’s mother spent two to three months in the U.S. in 2017,
approximately six months in 2018, and four to five months in 2019. (Tr. 39.) She stays
with Applicant when she is in the U.S. (Tr. 76.) His father came to the U.S. in 2018 for
about a month. (Tr. 40, 77.)
Applicant’s older brother attended an American high school in Egypt. He obtained
his college degree in Egypt and initially worked as a construction engineer. (Tr. 29, 35.)
He  quit  his  job  and  was  unemployed  for  about  two  years.  At  least  part  of  that  time,
Applicant’s  father  was  home  in  Egypt  and  not  working  overseas.  (Tr.  36.)  Applicant’s
brother  became  a  software  engineer.  As  of  September  2019,  Applicant’s  brother  was
working in the information-technology sector in Egypt and living with Applicant’s parents.
(Tr. 36.) Applicant is in contact with his brother a few times every couple of months. (Tr.
71.)
Applicant’s younger brother has resided in the U.S. continuously since 2009, and
he  works  in  the  financial  industry.  Applicant’s  sister  is  currently  employed  as  a  data
analyst for an insurance company in the U.S. She earned her master’s degree in statistical
modeling in the U.S. in 2018. Applicant visits his siblings in the U.S. whenever he can.
(GE 2; Tr. 34-35.)
Applicant’s  cousin  in  Canada  had  owned  an  electronics  shop,  but  as  of  August
2017, he was starting an online sales business. Applicant sees his cousin about twice a
year in person, and has averaged weekly contact with him by phone or text. (GE 2.)
Applicant’s childhood friend from Egypt has been a longtime resident of the UAE.
Applicant and his friend had regular contact in childhood but sporadic contact thereafter
until  Applicant  moved  to  the  UAE  in  2014.  This  friend,  who  worked  for  a  U.S.-based
company in the UAE, socialized with Applicant three or four times in the UAE. They have
had no contact other than a single text message since Applicant returned to the U.S. in
2016. (GE 2.)
After the  SOR  was  issued,  Applicant  was  removed from  his program at  work in
May  2019  and  transferred  to  unclassified  work.  (Tr.  75.)  On  May  30,  2019,  Applicant
executed a written statement of loyalty to the U.S. in which he renounced any allegiance
to a foreign state. (AE A.) He denied any loyalty to Egypt, although there is no evidence
that Applicant has notified Egyptian authorities of an intention to relinquish his Egyptian
citizenship.  In  response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  acknowledged  his  concern  for  his
immediate family, but indicated:
Respectfully, if the remote and speculative possibility of my being placed in
a  position  of  choosing  between  Egypt  and  the  U.S.  there  is  no  choice;  I
would have no loyalty to Egypt. I proudly admit I would have concern for my
close family and think that if I did not, well that might be the greater concern
with  respect  to  who  I  am.  But  short  of  even  more  remote  scenarios  of
kidnappings etc., I just don’t see how that would happen given who they are
and their lack of knowledge of my job responsibilities. If it did, I would rely
on the systems and process of the government I have sworn to protect to
do what must be done. (Answer.)
Applicant does not see a future for himself in Egypt, largely because of the rampant
corruption  there.  (Tr.  41-42.)  When  asked  at  his  hearing  whether  he  would  consider
moving to Egypt or the UAE for a job, Applicant responded, as follows:
Doubt it. . . . because I wouldn’t — I don’t need to. I, the job market’s great,
here, right now . . . it will just be another source of instability. And I wouldn’t
know where I would end up next in my life, but most likely, here. I wouldn’t
— unless i got another great job offer in the UAE that pays, somehow, but I
don’t see that happening. (Tr. 77-78.)
Applicant’s financial assets, including about $47,000 in banking deposits, $16,538
in  his  employer’s  investment  plan,  and  $213,000  in  other  retirement  and  investment
accounts,  are  solely  in  the  U.S.  (AE  C;  Tr. 50.)  Applicant  consulted  with  a  real  estate
professional  in  his  area  in  regard  to  purchasing  a  residence,  but  he  continues  to  rent
because of the uncertainty about his clearance and possible job loss. (AE C; Tr. 51-52.)
For  the  last  year,  he  has  assisted  his  sister  while  she  was  having  chemotherapy
treatments. Applicant has been dating a medical student for the past year-and-a half. (Tr.
53.)
Applicant submitted character reference letters on his behalf from a friend, two co-
workers, and a neighbor. The friend has known Applicant for the last five years. They first
became acquainted in November 2014, while she was employed as a special education
teacher in the UAE.  Applicant was someone she looked to for advice and guidance in
navigating in the UAE and its culture. She returned to the U.S. in August 2016. When
Applicant moved back to the U.S., he stayed in this friend’s guest room while apartment
hunting.  He  paid  his  bills  on  time.  This  friend  considers  Applicant  to  be  a  sincere,
thoughtful, and dependable friend. (AE D.)
A software engineer for Applicant’s employer met Applicant two years ago. They
did  not  work  on  the  same  projects,  but  they  share  similar  work  and  sports  (soccer)
interests. They have contact outside of work a couple of times per week. This friend/co-
worker  is  aware  that  Applicant’s  sister  underwent  chemotherapy  treatments;  that
Applicant assumed the responsibility of caring for her without hesitation or complaint; and
that  Applicant  provides  emotional  support  for  his  mother.  According  to  this  friend,
Applicant stands out for his empathy, responsibility, and reliability. He has no hesitation
in recommending Applicant for a position that requires integrity and reliability. (AE D.)
A  senior  software  engineer  with  a  secret  clearance  met  Applicant  in  November
2017 when the co-worker began working for Applicant’s employer. Applicant “went out of
his way to help [him] and make sure things went smoothly.” While they were assigned to
the same team, Applicant handled some of the most difficult problems professionally and
with  success. This co-worker described  Applicant as  an asset  to  their  work and  to  the
soccer team that they joined together in 2018. Applicant attended his wedding, and this
co-worker  and  his  wife  have  developed  a  close  friendship  with  Applicant.  They  have
learned through experience that Applicant is a thoughtful and sincere person. (AE D.)
A  neighbor  of  Applicant’s  attests  that  Applicant  has  been  a  consistently  polite,
thoughtful, and kind neighbor. The neighbor and  her spouse have had  the pleasure of
meeting  Applicant’s  sister  and  mother  when  they  have  visited  him,  although  their
interactions  with  them  have  been  limited  to  small,  polite  conversations.  The  neighbor
believes Applicant can be relied on to abide by his commitments. (AE D.)
Administrative Notice
After  reviewing  the  source  documents  relied  on  by  the  Government,  and
considering  Applicant’s  position  about  issues  in  Egypt,  including  that  known  terrorist
activity targeting tourists in Egypt “has less than nothing to do with this case” (Tr. 16), I
have taken administrative notice of the facts set forth in the Government’s July 25, 2019
requests and incorporate them by reference in this decision. For additional background
information regarding the two countries relationships with the U.S., I have reviewed the
U.S. State Department’s respective Bilateral Relations Fact Sheet, issued for Egypt on
September 20, 2019, and for the UAE on September 13, 2018. Of particular note are the
following salient facts.
Egypt is a constitutional republic governed by an elected president and unicameral
legislature.  Challengers  to  Egypt’s  incumbent  President  al-Sisi  withdrew  before  recent
presidential elections in March 2019, some citing political pressure or unfair competition.
Some  challengers  were  arrested  for  alleged  violations  of  candidacy  prohibitions  for
military  personnel.  Domestic  and  international  organizations  expressed  concern  that
government limitations on association, assembly, and expression severely constrained
broad  participation  in  the  political  process.  Egypt’s  parliament  approved  a  state  of
emergency  after an April 2017 terrorist  attack  on  Coptic  churches.  Egypt  was  under a
government-declared  state  of  emergency  for  all  of  2018.  Illegal  demonstrations  have
occurred  in  Egypt  which  have  turned  volatile.  The  U.S.  State  Department’s  Office  of
Diplomatic  Security’s  Egypt  2019  Crime  &  Safety  Report:  Cairo  indicates  that  illegal
demonstrations have been quashed by Egyptian authorities in a relatively short time, but
that, because of the volatility of past demonstrations, peaceful demonstrators and even
bystanders  may  be  subject  to  questioning,  detention,  arrest,  and  conviction  for
participating in or proximity to unauthorized demonstrations.
In 2018, Egypt’s most significant human rights issues included arbitrary or unlawful
killings,  including  by  government  forces  or  its  agents  and  non-state  terrorist  groups;
forced  disappearances;  torture,  arbitrary  arrest  and  detention;  arbitrary  or  unlawful
interference  with  privacy;  undue  restrictions  on  free  expression,  the  press,  and  the
Internet;  substantial  interference  with  the  rights  of  peaceful  assembly  and  freedom  of
association;  restrictions  on  political  participation;  and  arbitrary  arrest  and  targeting  of
LGBT  persons  and  other  minority  groups.  Government  officials  enjoyed  a  measure  of
impunity for human rights abuses.
In  2017  and  2018,  terrorist  organizations,  including  some  affiliates  of  the  self-
proclaimed Islamic State (ISIS) terrorist group, carried out deadly attacks on government,
civilian,  and  security  targets  in  Egypt,  including  on  places  of  worship.  While  Egyptian
authorities  investigated  terrorist  attacks  and  prosecuted  alleged  perpetrators,  the  U.S.
State  Department’s  current  travel  advisory  for  Egypt  is  Level  2  –  exercise  increased
caution – due to terrorism. U.S. citizens are advised against travel to the Sinai Peninsula
(with  the  exception  of  travel  to  Sharm  El-Sheikh  by  air)  or  the  Western  Desert  due  to
terrorism.  The  U.S.  warns  that  terrorist  groups  may  attack  with  little  or  no  warning,
targeting  tourist  locations,  transportation  hubs,  markets  or  shopping  malls,  and  local
government  facilities,  and  that  there  is a  considerable  risk  of  terrorist  attacks  in  urban
areas,  including  Cairo,  despite  a  heavy  security  presence.  On  May  20,  2019, the  U.S.
State Department issued a security alert on reports of a roadside bomb attack on a tourist
bus resulting in injuries in the area of the museum complex near the pyramids in Giza.
Cairo is reported to be at considerable risk of terrorism.
The  U.S.  seeks  to  maintain  its  traditionally  close  ties  with  Egypt.  Promoting  a
stable, prosperous Egypt, where the government protects the basic rights of its citizens,
continues to be a core objective of U.S. policy. Since 1980, the U.S. has provided Egypt
with  over  $40  billion  in  military  assistance  in  furthering  the  strategic  partnership  and
regional  stability,  and  $30  billion  in  economic  assistance.  Two-way  trade  in  goods
between the U.S. and Egypt totaled $7.5 billion in 2018. American firms are active in most
sectors of Egypt’s economy, including oil and gas exploration and production, financial
services, manufacturing, construction, telecommunications, information technology, and
the restaurant and hospitality industry. Egypt and the U.S. belong to some of the same
international  organizations,  such  as  the  United  Nations,  International  Monetary  Fund,
World Bank, and World Trade Organization.
The UAE is a federation of seven semi-autonomous emirates, six of which merged
to  form  the  UAE  in  1971.  A  seventh  emirate  joined  in  1972.  The  rulers  of  the  seven
emirates  constitute  the  Federal  Supreme  Council,  the  UAE’s  highest  legislative  and
executive body. The emirates are under patriarchal rule with political allegiance defined
by  loyalty  to  tribal  leaders,  leaders  of  the  individual  emirates,  and  leaders  of  the
federation. A limited, appointed electorate participates in periodic elections for a partially
elected Federal National Council, which has legislative review authority.
Significant human rights abuses in the UAE in 2018 included allegations of torture
in  detention,  arbitrary  arrest  and  detention  by  government  agents;  government
interference  with  privacy  rights;  undue  restrictions  on  free  expression  and  the  press,
including  censorship; substantial interference  with  the  rights  of  peaceful  assembly  and
freedom  of  association; and  the  inability  of citizens  to  choose  their government  in free
and fair elections. The government did not permit workers to join independent unions and
did not effectively prevent physical and sexual abuse of foreign domestic servants and
other domestic workers.
In  2015,  the  UAE  became  part  of  a  Saudi-led  coalition  to  counter  the  2014
overthrow of the legitimate government in Yemen by militias and other forces loyal to the
former Yemeni president. In 2018, UAE forces continued an active military role in Yemen
and  UAE  forces  allegedly  abducted,  detained,  and  tortured  individuals  as  part  of
counterterrorism efforts in southern Yemen.
The UAE is a vocal and active participant in counterterrorism efforts at both the
regional and international levels. Terrorist organizations exploited the UAE’s position as
a regional and global financial and transportation hub in 2017. Except for well-regulated
free trade zones specifically established for financial activities, free trade zones varied in
their  compliance  with  and  supervision  of  anti-money  laundering  and  countering  the
10
financing of terrorism international best practices. Exploitation by illicit actors of money
transmitters remained a significant concern. Between 2005 and 2016, several companies
and  individuals  have  shipped  restricted  U.S.  goods,  dual-use,  military  and  electronic
components  and  Internet  technology  through  the  UAE  and  UAE-owned  businesses  to
Iran and Syria in violation of U.S. export controls and sanctions regulations.
Law enforcement in the UAE has effectively demonstrated the capacity to detect,
deter,  and  prevent  terrorism  in  the  UAE.  The  U.S.  State  Department’s  current  travel
advisory for the UAE is Level 1 – exercise normal precautions, although U.S. citizens in
the  UAE  are  advised  to  exercise  a  high  level  of  security  awareness  because  of  the
possibility of terrorist attacks against U.S. citizens and interests in the Gulf and Arabian
Peninsula. Terrorist organizations continue to plan attacks against Western targets, using
a variety to tactics, including suicide operations, assassination, kidnapping, hijacking, and
bombing.  Rebel  groups  in  Yemen  have  expressed  an  intention  to  attack  neighboring
countries, including the UAE, using missiles and unmanned aerial systems (drones). U.S.
citizens are encouraged to maintain a high level of vigilance in the UAE.
The UAE plays an influential role in the Middle East and is  a key partner for the
U.S. in the region. The U.S. and the UAE enjoy strong bilateral cooperation on a full range
of  issues,  including  defense,  nuclear  non-proliferation,  trade,  law  enforcement,  energy
policy,  and  cultural  exchange.  The  UAE  hosts  more  U.S.  Navy  ships  than  any  other
foreign country, and the U.S. provides export and border security assistance to the UAE.
More than 1,000 U.S. firms operate in the UAE and many use the UAE as its regional
headquarters from which to conduct business throughout the Middle East, North Africa,
and  parts  of  Asia.  The  UAE  and  the  U.S.  belong  to  some  of  the  same  international
organizations,  including  the  United  Nations,  International  Monetary  Fund, World  Bank,
and World Trade Organization.

"Applicant is 53 years old. He is married with three children.  He has a Master’s
degree  in  Mechanical  Engineering,  and  a  Master’s  degree  in  Business  Administration,
as  well  as  several certifications.    (Applicant’s  Exhibit  D,  E,  F and G.)   He  is employed
with  a  defense  contractor  as  a  Manufacturing  Engineer  Manager.    He  is  seeking  to
retain a security clearance in connection with his employment.
Guideline B – Foreign Influence
Applicant  was  born  in  Hong  Kong  in  1965.    He  grew  up  there  and  came  to  the
United States as a teenager in February 1985.  He obtained his college education here
and  then  his  U.S.  citizenship  in  1991.    That  same  year  he  was  hired  by  his  current
employer  and  has  been  working  for  this  defense  contractor  for  the  past  29  years.
Applicant  has  received  numerous  awards  and  accolades  from  his  employer  for  his
dedicated  community  and  company  outreach.    (Applicant’s  Exhibit  H.)    He  has  an
impeccable work history, as he has progressed over the years from an Engineer to the
Manager  of  Manufacturing  Engineering.    Applicant  has  never  applied  for  a  security
clearance before.  (Tr. p. 54.)
Applicant is married to a naturalized American citizen and has three native-born
American children.  His only foreign contact  with anyone  in China is with his father-in-
law, who is a retired middle school teacher.  He is 80 years old and his health situation
is up and down.  Applicant’s father-in-law has no affiliation with the Chinese government
or military.  Applicant’s wife telephones her father in China about once a week to check
on him.  Applicant has almost zero contact with his father-in-law, as he only talks with
him when he travels to visit him in China.  Applicant last traveled to China in May 2019
and  returned  in  June  2019.    During  that  trip  he  took  his  family,  including  his  wife  and
children.  He has no plans for future travel to China.  (Tr. p. 57.)
Applicant’s father-in-law  knows  that he  works for  a  U.S.  company,  but does  not
know what kind of work Applicant does, and does not know that he works for a defense
contractor, or that he has applied for a security clearance.  (Tr. p. 58.)
Applicant credibly testified that he cannot be coerced into divulging any national
security  secrets.    Applicant  has  never  been  approached,  confronted,  or  contacted  by
any foreign entity attempting to obtain protected information.  He stated that if his father-
in-law or anyone else in China or Hong Kong was detained by the Chinese government
in  an  effort  to  extort  protected  information  from  the  Applicant,  he  would  immediately
report it to the U.S. authorities.  Applicant states that he is loyal to the U.S. and that his
limited  relationships  with  any  foreign  member  of  Hong  Kong  or  China  cannot  threaten
him to do anything against the interests of the United States.  (Tr. pp. 59 - 60.)
Three  witnesses  testified  on  behalf  of  the  Applicant.    Each  of  them  know  the
Applicant from work, and have either supervised him at some point, or worked with him
for  many  years,  or  both.    They  also  participate  with  him  in  several  professional  social
groups  within  the  company.    Applicant  is  described  as  “dynamic,”  “highly  respected,”
and  a  “leader.”    Besides  his  outstanding  work  product,  he  is  involved  with  the
Toastmasters Club, sponsored by the company, the Asian-Pacific Professional Network,
and  is  the  founder  of  a  community  Martial  Arts  Club.    Applicant  is  considered  to  be  a
loyal, responsible, and trustworthy individual.  He is highly recommended for a security
clearance.  (Tr. pp. 28 - 48.)
Letters  of  recommendation  from  five  professional  colleagues  of  the  Applicant
attest
that  demonstrates  high  morals,  hardwork,
to  his  outstanding  character
responsibility  and  trustworthiness  that  inspires  others  around  him.    He  is  said  to
embrace the diversity in the workplace with an ability to work effectively and efficiently
with sound moral integrity and ethical principles at all times.  He is considered to be an
exceptional  individual and  an  excellent  team  player.    He  is  said  to  be  a  fully  engaged
citizen  of  the  U.S.  and  a  strong  technical  leader  in  the  defense  industry.    (Applicant’s
Exhibit A.)
Notice
foreign
technical
information  by
I  have  taken  administrative  notice  of  the  following  information  concerning  the
People’s  Republic  of  China  (PRC).      Targeting  and  collection  of  US  political,  military,
economic,  and
intelligence  services  continues
unabated.  China is one of the most aggressive collectors of U.S. economic information
and technology.  China’s intelligence services, as well as private companies and other
entities, frequently seek to exploit Chinese citizens or persons with family  ties to China
who can use their insider access to corporate networks to steal secrets using removable
media  devices  or  e-mail.    Chinese  actors  are  the  world’s  most  active  and  persistent
perpetrators  of  economic  espionage.    Chinese  attempts  to  collect  U.S.  technological
and economic information will continue at a high level and will represent a growing and
persistent threat to U.S. economic security.   The nature of the cyber threat will evolve
with continuing technological advances in the global information environment.  (HE I)
",True
"Applicant admitted the two allegations contained in the SOR. Her admissions are
incorporated into these findings.
Applicant is 32 years old and was born in United States. She earned a bachelor’s
degree from an American university. She married her husband in 2009. He was born in
the  United  States.  They  have  three  young  children.  She  has  worked  for  a  defense
contractor since 2014. Prior to that, she stayed at home with her children for three to four
years. Applicant is active in community and school organizations. (Tr. 16-18, 21, 27-28;
AE A)
Applicant’s parents were born in Afghanistan. Her father immigrated to the United
States  in  1969  and  her  mother  in  the  early  1980s.  They  are  naturalized  U.S.  citizens.
They met in Afghanistan and married in the United States. Applicant has a sister and a
half-sister, both of whom were born in the United States.  Her parents do not have any
immediate family members who are citizens and residents of Afghanistan. All of them live
in the United States. Applicant’s mother has occasional contact with a distant relative in
Afghanistan.  Her parents  do  not  receive  any  money  from people  living  in  Afghanistan.
Applicant does not have contact with any family members in Afghanistan. She does not
send money to anyone residing there, nor does her husband. They do not receive money
from people residing in Afghanistan. (Tr. 19, 23, 29, 32, 35-36)
Applicant’s believes that her father returned to Afghanistan once after immigrating
to the United States. She was a young child at the time. Her mother returned once when
Applicant was in high school. Both parents know she is seeking a security clearance. (Tr.
33)
Applicant’s  mother-in-law  and  father-in-law  were  born  in  Afghanistan.  They
subsequently  immigrated  to  the  United  States.  After  her  father-in-law  divorced  her
mother-in-law,  he  returned  to  Afghanistan  in  1988  when  Applicant’s  husband  was  five
years old. Applicant remained with his mother in the United States. Applicant  said she
has never met her father-in-law, but spoke to him once after she and her husband were
married in the United States. She testified that her husband speaks to his father at most,
once a year. She said he played little or no role in her husband’s upbringing and life. Her
mother-in-law is a U.S. citizen and resident. She worked as a linguist for the U.S. Armed
Forces in Afghanistan for a couple years. She is aware that Applicant is seeking a security
clearance. (Tr. 24-25, 32-34, 36-37; GE 1, GE 2)
Applicant’s  father-in-law  served  as  a  minister  in  a  department  of  the  Afghan
government. Applicant said she did not know that information about her father-in-law until
she received the SOR. She does not think he currently works in any capacity related to
the Afghan government or its military. (Tr. 25-26: GE 2)
Applicant’s husband’s second cousin was a high-ranking member of the executive
branch of the Afghan government from 2004 to 2014. She has never met this cousin and
has no contact with him. Her husband does not have contact with him or any cousins in
Afghanistan. He has contact with cousins residing in the United States. (Tr. 34, 38)
Applicant  has  never  visited  Afghanistan.  (Tr.  21)  Her  husband  worked  for  a
defense contractor in Afghanistan as an interpreter for the U.S. Armed Forces for a year
between 2005 and 2006, which was prior to their marriage in 2009. At the time he worked
there, his father was a minister in the Afghan government and his second cousin was in
the executive branch. She believes her husband held a security clearance at that time.
Her husband returned to Afghanistan once to visit family years ago. (Tr. 21-22, 31-32; GE
1, GE 2)
Applicant  and  her  husband  purchased  a  $237,000  home  in  2015,  and  have  a
$150,000  mortgage  on  the  property.  They  have  bank  and  retirement  accounts  in  the
United States. They have no property or financial interests in Afghanistan. (Tr. 18-19, 30)
Applicant submitted letters of recommendation from her manager and immediate
family members. Her manager stated he has supervised Applicant since April 2014 and
has no knowledge that she maintains relationships or contacts with citizens or residents
of Afghanistan. Applicant’s mother and half-sister confirm that Applicant has never met
her husband’s second cousin and has no contact with him or her father-in-law. All authors
attest  to  her  loyalty  to  the  United  States.  (AE  A)  Throughout  the  hearing,  Applicant

I  have  taken  administrative  notice  of  facts  contained  in  U.S.  Government
pronouncements  concerning  the  state  of  Afghanistan.  Specifically,  Afghanistan  faces
many challenges fueled by sectarian and ethnic divisions. Numerous terrorist groups are
increasingly active throughout Afghanistan. Threats of kidnapping and violence are high,
and the Department of State warns U.S. citizens that all travel to Afghanistan should be
avoided.  Of  particular  significance  are  the  poor  human  rights  situation;  the  active  and
hostile presence of Al Qaida, the Taliban, the Haqqani Network; and other insurgent and
extremist groups that generate instability and openly attack police, security and military
forces, the local populace, and U.S. persons and interests. (HE 3)

"Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.b through 1.e and 1.g. He denied
the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a, 1.f, 1.h and 1.i.  After a thorough and careful review of the
pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 36 years old. He was born in Afghanistan. He is a high school graduate
and earned two vocational certificates. He was granted a special immigration visa in 2009
for his work with the United States Forces in Afghanistan. He immigrated to the United
States in 2009 and became a naturalized citizen in June 2014. Applicant married in 2004.
He has three children, ages 12, 10, and 4 years old. His wife is a citizen of Afghanistan
and a permanent resident of the United States. Applicant stated that his wife intends to
apply for U.S. citizenship. His two eldest sons became naturalized citizens of the United
States  in  2014, and his youngest  child  was  born  in  the  United  States  and  is a  citizen.
Applicant indicated in his answer to the SOR that his wife and children reside in the United
States and have no intention of returning to Afghanistan in the foreseeable future. (Items
1, 2; AE A)
Applicant  disclosed  in  his  answer  to  the  SOR  that  he  previously  worked  as  a
linguist in Afghanistan for the U.S. Government and military from 2003 to 2009. It was this
service  that  made  him  eligible  for  a  special  immigration  visa.  After  he  immigrated,  he
returned to Afghanistan and worked from 2010 to 2013 for the U.S. military as a linguist.
Applicant disclosed in his security clearance application (SCA) that he has been working
in Afghanistan as a linguist for a federal contractor  since January 2015 to the present.
(Items 1, 2; AE A)
Applicant’s  mother, father, three  brothers,  three  sisters,  and  two  brothers-in-law
are  citizens  and  residents  of  Afghanistan.  He  stated  that  in  2016,  he  applied  for  an
immigration visa to the United States for his mother, but because a request for information
was sent to his U.S. address and he was serving in Afghanistan, he never received it,
and  the  visa  was  denied.  His  mother  remains  in  Afghanistan.  She  is  a  housewife.  His
father  is  a  retired  laborer/farmer.  In  the  past,  Applicant  provided  his  parents  some
financial support. At that time, his mother had cancer, and has since recovered. He no
longer  provides  his  parents  financial  support,  but  does  give  them  gifts  for  special
occasions  and  holidays.  His  parents  are  now  financially  supported  by  Applicant’s
brothers. (Item 1; AE A)
One of Applicant’s brothers is a dentist, another owns a cell phone store, and the
youngest  is a  university  student.  At one  time,  Applicant provided  his  brothers financial
support.  He  no  longer  provides  support.  He  does  send  monetary  gifts  for  special
occasions and holidays. (Item 1; AE A)
Applicant’s three sisters are married and housewives. He does not provide them
financial  support  and  he  does  not  have  regular  contact  with  them  since  they  married.
(Item 1; AE A)
Applicant’s said that he does not have regular contact with one brother-in-law and
does  not  provide  him  any  financial  support.  The  other  brother-in-law,  who  previously
worked for the National Directorate of Intelligence, is now retired. Applicant indicated his
brother-in-law was a clerk. He stated that he has contact with him once or twice a year
and has not seen him in person for years. (Item 1; AE A)
Applicant stated that he has not had in-person contact with any family member in
Afghanistan  since  2013.  In  his February  2018  background  interview,  he  stated that he
maintains  contact  with  his parents.  He  also has  regular  contact  with his oldest brother
through Facebook and telephonically. He has contact once or twice a month with his other
brothers. He has not disclosed to his family in Afghanistan what he does or for whom he
works. None of his relatives are affiliated with the Afghan government. (Item 3; AE A)
Applicant  does  not  have  any  financial  interests  in  Afghanistan.  He  owns  two
houses in the United States. He lives in one and rents the other. Applicant indicated to
the government investigator that he follows all appropriate security procedures and those
related to contact with foreign nationals. He has not been threatened, put under duress,
or blackmailed because of his family in Afghanistan. There have been no threats to induce
Applicant to cooperate with foreign entities. His family is unaware that he is undergoing
consideration for obtaining a security clearance with the U.S. Government. He believes
they would be supportive if they knew. He stated: “all of my adult life I have been working
for the U.S. and I will continue to work with honesty and integrity for the U.S. Government.”
(Items 1, 3; AE A)
Afghanistan
The United States Department of State’s travel warning for Afghanistan remains in
effect and it warns U.S. citizens against travel there because of continued instability and
threats  by  terrorist  organizations  against  U.S.  citizens.  Travel  there  is  unsafe  due  to
ongoing risk of kidnapping, hostage-taking, military combat operations, and armed rivalry
between  political  and  tribal  groups,  militant  attacks,  suicide  bombings,  and  insurgent
attacks.  These  attacks  may  also  target  Afghan  and  U.S.  Government  convoys  and
compounds, foreign embassies, military installations, and other public areas.
Extremists associated with various Taliban networks, the Islamic State in Iraq and
Syria (ISIS), and members of other armed opposition groups are active throughout the
country. These terrorist groups routinely attack Afghan, coalition forces, and U.S. targets
with  little  regard  for  or  the  express  intent  to  cause  civilian  casualties.  Due  to  security
concerns, unofficial travel to Afghanistan by U.S. Government employees and their family
members is restricted and requires prior approval from the State Department.
Afghanistan  continues  to  experience  aggressive  and  coordinated  attacks  by
different terrorist groups. These groups remain active and were able to conduct a number
of high-profile, mass-casualty attacks in Kabul against sectarian and Afghan government
targets. They continue to plan such attacks against U.S. and coalition forces and Afghan
interests. Border regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan remain safe havens for terrorists.
The Afghan government struggles to assert control over this remote region.
The State Department’s report on human rights for Afghanistan notes there was
widespread violence, including indiscriminate attacks on civilians and killings of persons
affiliated with the government by armed insurgent groups, widespread disregard for the
rule of law and little accountability for those who committed human rights abuses. There
was also targeted violence and endemic societal discrimination against women and girls.
Afghanistan remains an important partner of the United States in the fight against
terrorism,  working  with  the  U.S.  to  eliminate  terrorist  groups.  The  U.S.  Government
continues  to  invest  resources  to  help  Afghanistan  improve  its  security,  governance,
institutions, and economy. The U.S. Government has a strong bilateral partnership with
the Afghan government.

"Applicant is a 54-year-old woman who was born and raised in China, where she
earned the equivalent of a medical degree. Married in 1992, she had a child about three
years later. Applicant and her child followed her husband to the United States in 1999
after  he  received  a  work visa.  Applicant became  a  naturalized  United States  citizen  in
2012. Shortly thereafter, she found a contractor position aiding in government medical
research.  Applicant  was  ultimately  vetted  and  awarded  clearance  for  a  public  trust
position. She has been a research associate at her present place of business for about
seven years.
Applicant has never owned real property in a foreign country. She  has received
no  form  of  social  security  or  government  aid  from  China  as  a  result  of  her  birth  or
periods of employment in China. Applicant visited China in 2018 and 2019. (Tr. 28)
The circumstances surrounding Applicant’s kin in China, for the most part, have
been the same for several years. Relatives remaining in China as citizens and residents
include her retired  public  school teacher mother,  who  receives  a government pension,
and  her  retired  private  school  teacher  father,  who  suffers  from  dementia.  (Tr.  32,  56)
Neither parent ever performed military service in China. Applicant also has two siblings
who work for private institutions. (Tr. 35) Her parents-in-law are retired from work in the
private  sector.  Applicant’s  niece  is  still  a  citizen  of  China,  but  is  currently  living  in  the
United  States  with  a  green  card  status.  (Tr.  41)  Overall,  Applicant  describes  these
individuals as “very normal people” with no interest in her work. (Tr. 55-56)
Applicant  sends  her  parents  nominal  amounts  of  money  to  encourage  them  to
take  and  enjoy  vacations.  Applicant  maintains  relations  with  her  parents  and  siblings
through  various  communicative  Internet-based  social  media,  which  permits  her  to
“connect, not really talk.” (Tr. 38) Annually, they speak by telephone to honor the New
Year.  Applicant and her husband maintain minimal contact with his parents. (Tr. 39)
A  scientist,  Applicant’s  husband  previously  worked  for  the  United  States
government. (Tr. 21) He has no criminal background. (Ex. A) In 2018, he began working
in senior management for a small company incorporated in  the United States. (Tr. 22)
This  has  added  to  the  foreign  influence  concerns  previously  examined  regarding
Applicant. (Tr. 58-59) The company’s owner lives in the United States, but Applicant is
unsure whether the owner is a U.S. citizen.  It is unknown whether the company has a
nexus  with  the  Chinese  government.  (Tr.  28)  In  June  2018,  Applicant’s  husband  was
sent to China to work for the company because: “they are bringing some work in China.
So,  they  need  their  people  to monitor the  work, so  that’s  why  he  was  sent  there.”  (Tr.
24-25) The work at issue appears to be medical in nature.
For  an  unknown  reason,  the  head  of  the  company  is  unable  to  come  and  go
freely  through  China.  Therefore,  the  owner  wants  Applicant’s  husband  to  act  on  his
behalf. (Tr. 25-26) Such work is in collaboration with a pharmaceutical lab that is at least
partly  Chinese.  (Tr.  26).  In  China,  the  husband  rents  a  dwelling  and  maintains  a
personal  bank  account.  Applicant  does  not  know  the  sum  maintained  in  this  foreign
account, but most or all of his regular pay check is deposited in their joint account in the
United States. At present, the company owner is looking for a collaborator from another
part  of  the  world.  (Tr.  29)  It  is  presently  unknown  whether  the  husband  will  remain  in
China, return to the United States, or follow the company elsewhere. (Tr. 29, 44)
In  the  United  States,  Applicant  and  her  husband  own  their  own  home.  It  was
bought for $540,000 and there is a mortgage balance currently of about $400,000. Their
child  is  enrolled  in  graduate  school  with  plans  to  pursue  a  doctoral  degree  in  this
country. Applicant personally maintains a retirement account and a bank account in the
United States, amounting to about $60,000; she has no other financial investments. (Tr.
45) Her husband also has a retirement account in this country. Applicant participates in
various community activities, including a local dance and exercise class.
Now  retired,  Applicant’s  former  supervisor  found  Applicant  to  be  a  stellar
performer,  quick  study,  and  popular  colleague.  (Tr.  49-51)  She  far  outperformed  the
supervisor’s initial expectations. She held a public trust position while working under him
without  adverse  incident  for  many  years.  Applicant’s  current  supervisor  is  eager  to
elevate  Applicant  and  better  utilize  her  many  talents  by  moving  her  from  a  research
associate to a principal investigator position. (Tr. 55)

Background
Applicant  is  a  U.S.  citizen  by  birth  and  a  naturalized  dual  citizen  from  Jordan.
She  became  a  naturalized  Jordanian  citizen  in  January  2006  through  her  husband’s
Jordanian citizenship and remains a dual citizen with Jordan. (GE 1; Tr. 163-165) She
received a Jordanian passport in 2006 and used it on six occasions to visit her husband
and  relatives  in  Jordan  between  May  2006  and  January  2010.  (GE  1)  Her  Jordanian
passport expired in 2011, and she has never renewed it. (Tr. 163) Should her retained
Jordanian citizenship pose problems with her security clearance eligibility, she is willing
to renounce it. (Tr. 165)
Applicant’s  parents  are  naturalized  U.S.  citizens  who  held  dual  citizenship  with
Jordan.  (GE  1)  Her  mother  became  a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen  in  1972  and  currently
resides with Applicant and her husband. (GE 1; Tr. 68-69) Her mother’s U.S. passport
expired  in  1985  and  has  not  been  renewed.  (GE  1  and  AE  A;  Tr.  68-69)  Applicant’s
father passed away in December 2014. (GE 1 and AE A; Tr. 67)
Applicant’s husband is a Jordanian citizen by birth who immigrated to the United
States from Jordan in 1985, applied for U.S. citizenship the same year, and became a
naturalized U.S. citizen in 1991. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 67) His parents became naturalized U.S.
citizens  in  the  early  1990s,  hold  dual  citizenship  with  Jordan,  and  have  resided  in  the
United States. (GE 1 and AE A) His father passed away in December 1993. (GE 1 and
AE  A;  Tr.  77,  158)  His  mother  recently  renewed  her  U.S.  passport  and  resides  with
Applicant and himself. (GE 2 and AE A; Tr. 68, 77)
Applicant married in August 1987 and has three children (ages 30, 29, and 15),
who  are  U.S.  residents  and  citizens  by  birth.  (GE  1;  Tr.  64.  150-152,  160-162)  She
earned bachelor’s and  master’s degrees with honors from a respected university in her
state of residence in December 1995 and December 2012, respectively, with excellent
software skills. (GE 1) and AE C. She reported no prior military service.
Since  March  2019,  Applicant  has  been  employed  by  her  current  defense
contractor. (GE 1; Tr. 140) She has been employed contemporaneously as a part-time
adjunct lecturer at a local university (her alma mater) since January 2016. (GE 1 and AE
A)  Between  August  2018  and  March  2019,  she  was  employed  as  a  litigation  financial
analyst  for  a  federal  agency.  (GE  1;  Tr.  140-141)  And,  between  May  December  2012
and  August  2018,  she  worked  for  a  local  municipal  government  agency  as  an
accounting and financial division chief. (GE 1 and AE A)
While  in  college  completing  her  master’s  degree  (2010-2012),  Applicant  held  a
temporary position for part of her academic tenure. (GE 1 and AE A) Applicant has not
previously held a security clearance. (Tr. 143-145)
Between March 1991 and August 2005, Applicant’s husband worked as a senior
transportation civil engineer (design manager) for a transportation agency in Applicant’s
state of residence. (AE E; Tr. 73-74) He took a leave of absence from his state agency
position from August 2005 to December 2007 to serve as a transportation engineer for
Iraq’s  reconstruction  ministry  and  transportation  attaché  to  the  U.S.  Department  of
State.  (AE  E; Tr. 72-74) While  serving  in  Iraq,  he possessed  a  security  clearance and
diplomatic  passport.  (Tr.  72)  Returning  to  the  United  States,  he  has  worked  for  the
same state transportation agency from January 2008 to the present. (AE E)
Family connections with Jordan, Israel, and Iraq
Applicant  has  two  sisters.  One  is  a  U.S.  citizen  who  has  resided  with  her
husband  and four children in Jordan since returning to the country in 2007. (GEs 1-2;
Tr.  50-51,  128-129)  The  other  sister  is  a  Jordanian  citizen  who  resides  in  the  United
States. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 50-51, 128)
Applicant  has  a  half-brother  who  is  a  dual  citizen  of  Israel  and  Jordan,  and  a
resident of Israel. (GEs 1-2 and AE A; Tr. 86-87, 146-147) Applicant last saw her half-
brother in  2011 at a  wedding  of  one  of  her nieces  in  Israel.  (GE 1;  Tr. 146-147) More
recently, she saw her half-brother in 2017, while traveling to Jordan for another niece’s
wedding. (Tr.148) Applicant has maintained infrequent contact with him since her return
to the United States from Jordan in 2010. (GE 1; Tr. 146-148)
Besides  her  half-brother,  Applicant  has  a  half-sister,  who  is  also  a  citizen  and
resident of  Israel.  (GE  1; Tr.  146-148) She saw  her  half-sister in  2010  while  attending
her niece’s wedding in Israel and saw her half-sister more recently in Jordan (in 2017)
at the wedding of another niece. (GE 1; Tr. 146-148)
Except for her two  visits  to  Jordan  in  2010  and 2017,  she has had  no personal
contact  with  either  her  half-brother  or  half-sister  and  maintains  infrequent  contact  with
both of them  since returning to the United States in 2010. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 148) Applicant
has no close bonds, ties, or connections with either of her half siblings.(Tr. 45, 146-148)
Altogether, Applicant has 38 family members, 35 of which are U.S. citizens. (GEs
1-2;  Tr.  128)  Her  three  family  members  who  are  not  U.S.  citizens  are  her  stepmother
and two of her stepmother’s three children. (Tr. 130-131)
Financial condition
Applicant  and  her  husband  own  real  estate  in  Iraq,  which  they  estimated  to
approximate $500,000 USD in value. (GE 2 and AEs A-B; Tr. 74-78) The Iraq property
consists  of  a  large  tract  (hundreds  of  acres)  of  undivided  land  originally  owned  by  his
grandfather. (Tr. 75) This property was later deeded to Applicant’s father and five other
siblings in six undivided interests years ago. (Tr.  75-76) After his father passed away in
1993, Applicant’s husband and his siblings inherited his father’s undivided interest in the
tract  of  land.  (Tr.  75-76)  Neither  Applicant’s  husband  nor  his  five  siblings  have  any
control over sale decisions, and in 2019, Applicant’s husband received $150,000 as his
share of the proceeds of a small section of the Iraqi tract of land. (AE B; Tr. 75-76, 81-
84) He has no say in future dispositions of all or part of the Iraqi property and, for this
reason,  he  cannot  make  any  safe  predictions  of  if  or  when  he  and  the  other  40
members of his extended family holding interests in the tract might elect to sell off some
or all of the remaining sections of the tract  that the latter deeded to his father and five
siblings. (Tr.  81, 119, 137)  With his cashing out of his share of the sale proceeds, he
estimates  to  have  approximately  $350,000  USD  worth  of  ownership  remaining  in  the
property. (Tr. 119)
The only other real estate owned by Applicant and her husband is a small tract of
property  in  Jordan  they  purchased  in  2007  for  investment  purposes  that  is  worth
approximately  $24,011  USD.  (GE  2  and  AE  B;  Tr.  119,  153-156)  Most  of  Applicant’s
personal and real estate assets are situated in the United States. (AE C; Tr.  133-138)
She  reports  ownership  in  her  U.S.  residence,  which  is  worth  $855,481  according  to  a
reliable real estate source, and carries a mortgage in the amount of $409,725. (AE C)
She reported personal assets as follows: U.S. bank deposits of $150,000 for herself and
$377,418  for  her  husband,  an  estimated  monthly  state  retirement  balance  for  her
husband  in  the  amount  of  $8,847,  projected  monthly  social  security  benefits  of  over
$2,900  for  her  husband  (based  on  an  assumed  retirement  age  of  67),  and  invested
funds exceeding $167,000. (AE C; Tr. 157) Applicant reported annual income for herself
of $122,468 and $162,439 for her husband. (AE C)
Applicant  has  excellent  credit  and  estimates  her  U.S.-based  net  worth  to  be
approximately  $1,313,000.  (AEs  C  and  H;  Tr.  133,  136)  She  neither  provides  nor
receives  any  financial  support  from  her  half  siblings  residing  in  Israel  and  does  not
“have any real dealings with them.”  (Tr. 131-132, 144-45)
Country status of Jordan
The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan (Jordan) is a constitutional monarchy ruled by
King  Abdullah  II  bin  Hussein.  See  Request  for  Administrative  Notice,  Hashemite
Kingdom of Jordan; Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2018: Jordan, U.S.
Department of State (2019).
Ever  since  it  established  diplomatic  relations  with  Jordan  in  1949,  the  United
States and Jordan have enjoyed a long history of cooperation and friendship. See U.S.
Relations with Jordan: Bilateral Relations Fact Sheet, (January 2020) The United States
and  Jordan  share  the  mutual  goals  of  comprehensive,  just,  and  lasting  peace  in  the
Middle East and an end to violent extremism that threatens the security of Jordan, the
region, and the entire globe. (id.)
From  1949  to  1967,  Jordan  administered  the  West  Bank.  Since  the  1967  war
between  Israel  and  several  Arab  states,  Israel  has  maintained  control  of  this  territory.
The  United  States  continues  to  believe  that  the  final  status  of  the  West  Bank  can  be
determined  only  through  negotiations  among  the  concerned  parties  based  on  UN
Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338. See id.
In  2017,  the  United  States  provided  Jordan  $1.7  billion  in  bilateral  foreign
assistance and over $200 million in DoD support. In addition to bilateral assistance, the
United  States  has  provided  nearly  $1.1  billion  in  humanitarian  assistance  to  support
Syrian  refugees  in  Jordan.  (id.)   In  2018,  the  United  States  and  Jordan  signed  a  non-
binding  Memorandum  of  Understanding  (MOU)  to  provide  $6.375  billion  in  bilateral
foreign  assistance  to  Jordan  over  a  five-year  period,  pending  the  availability  of  funds.
The  MOU  serves  to  reinforce  the  U.S.  commitment  to  broaden  cooperation  and
dialogue  between  the  two  countries  in  various  areas.  Examples  include  improving
health  indicators,  road  and  water  networks,  building  of  schools,  educating  Jordanians,
providing improved access to water, resource management and conservation, providing
energy  loan  guarantees,  and  allowing  Jordan  access  to  affordable  financing  from
international capital markets. See id.

The U.S.-Jordan free trade agreement (FTA), the United State’s first FTA with an
Arab  country,  has  expanded  the  trade  relationship  by  reducing  barriers  for  services,
providing  cutting-edge  protection
regulatory
transparency,  and  requiring  effective  labor  and  environmental  enforcement.  See  U.S.
Relations  with  Jordan:  Bilateral  Relations  Fact  Sheet,  supra.  The  United  States  and
Jordan  have  an  “open  skies”  civil  aviation  agreement;  a  bilateral  investment  treaty;  a
science and technology cooperation agreement; and a memorandum of understanding
on  nuclear  energy  cooperation.  Such  agreements  bolster  efforts  to  help  diversify
Jordan’s  economy  and  promote  growth.  Jordan  and  the  United  States  belong  to  a
number  of  the  same  international  organizations,  including  the  United  Nations,
International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and World Trade Organization. Jordan also is
a Partner for Cooperation with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
The U.S. Department of State assesses the threat of terrorism in Jordan as high;
with  the  capital  of  Amman  currently  assessed  as  a  high-threat  location  for  terrorist
activity  directed  at  or  affecting  official  U.S.  Government  interests.  See  Request  for
Administrative  Notice,  Hashemite  Kingdom  of  Jordan,  supra;  Jordan  2018  Crime  and
Safety Report, U.S. Department of State (April 2019).
Transnational and  indigenous  terrorist  groups  in  Jordan  have  demonstrated  the
capability  to  plan  and  implement  attacks.  Violent  extremist  groups  in  Syria  and  Iraq,
including the Islamic State of lraq and the Levant (ISIL) (also known as the Islamic State
of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS) and Jabhat al-Nusra, have conducted attacks in Jordan and
continue  to  plot  against  local  security  forces,  U.S.  and  Western  interests,  and  soft
targets  such  as  high-profile  public  events,  hotels,  places  of  worship,  restaurants,
schools, and malls.  Jordan’s prominent role in the effort to defeat ISIS, and its shared
borders with Iraq and Syria, increase the potential for future terrorist incidents. See id.
Although  Jordan  has  remained  a  committed  partner  on  counterterrorism  and
countering  violent  extremism,  numerous  terrorist  incidents  reflect  the  current  security
situation in Jordan: throughout 2017-2019, multiple vehicle-borne improvised explosive
devices  detonated  in  and  around  a  refugee  camp  in  Syria  near  the  Jordanian  border;
and in October 2017, two homemade explosive devices were found in another refugee
camp in Jordan. See Request for Administrative Notice, supra, at 2-3. Also in October
2017, the State Security Court (SSC) prosecuted six people for sympathizing with ISIS,
after  they  created  social  media  accounts  to  find  Jordanian  supporters  for  ISIS  and
promote  terrorist  activity.  (id.)  In  September  2017,  the  SSC  charged  16  people  with  a
terrorist plot involving the use of automatic weapons to carry out terrorist attacks against
public  security  services;  and  the  Jordanian General Intelligence  Directorate  arrested  a

U.S. involvement in Iraq and Syria, and the U.S. Government’s policies on Israel,
have  fueled  anti-American feelings  in  Jordan.  Recent  surveys  reflect  that  over 80%  of
the  Jordanian  population  has  an  unfavorable  view  of  the  U.S.  Government.  See
Request  for  Administrative  Notice,  Hashemite  Kingdom  of  Jordan,  supra.  The  U.S.
Department  of State has  assessed Amman as  being  a  high-threat  location for political
violence directed at or affecting official U.S. Government interests. In December 2017,
protests  took  place  at  the  U.S.  Embassy  for 27  days  after  the  announcement  that  the
U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv would move to Jerusalem.
As  a  regional  leader  in  the  Global  Coalition  to  Defeat  ISIS,  Jordan  played  an
important role in Coalition successes in degrading the terrorist group’s territorial control
and  operational  reach.  During  2016,  Jordanian  authorities  took  legal  action  against
numerous individuals accused of terrorism under Jordanian law.
On  July  13,  2016,  the  Jordanian  State  Security  Court  filed  charges  against  21
suspected  ISIS  affiliates  in  connection  with  the  pre-emptive  March  raid  on  an  alleged
ISIS  safe  house  in  lrbid.  The  Department  of  State  assesses  that  the  potential  for
terrorist  activity  is  heightened  as  Jordan  participates  in  the  coalition  against  ISIS.
Extremist  groups  have  carried  out  terrorist  activities  against  U.S.  and  Jordanian
government targets in Jordan.
Terrorist  groups  often  do  not  distinguish  between  U.S.  Government  personnel
and  private  U.S.  citizens,  and  may  target  areas  frequented  by  Westerners,  such  as
tourist  sites,  hotels,  restaurants,  shopping  malls,  and  transportation  hubs.  See  Jordan
International Travel Information, at 7-10, U.S. Department of State (Dec. 2018)
According to the Department of State 2018 Human Rights Report, Jordan’s most
significant  continuing  human  rights  problems  include  allegations  of  torture  by  security
and  government  officials;  arbitrary  arrest  and  detention,  including  of  activists  and
journalists;  infringements  on  privacy  rights;  restrictions  on  freedom  of  expression;  and
restrictions  on  freedom  of  association  and  assembly.  Impunity  remained  widespread,
and  the  government  did  not  take  sufficiently  strong  steps  to  investigate,  prosecute,  or
punish officials who committed abuses.   See  Country  Reports  on  Human  Rights
Practices for 2018: Jordan, supra.
The  Jordanian  State  Security  Court  (SSC)  took  legal  action  against  numerous
individuals deemed to be terrorists under local law, including the arrest and prosecution
of  men  accused  of  seeking  to  join  Al-Nusra  Front  (ANF)  and  ISIS.  Other  arrests  and
prosecutions involved supporting/recruiting for ISIS and attempted travel to/from Syria in
support  of  extremist  activities  and  also  for  “propagating  ISIL  ideology,”  a  charge  often
used for online activity. See Jordan 2018 Crime and Safety Report, supra, at 4-5)
Country Status of Israel
Israel is  a  multi-party  parliamentary  democracy.  See  Request for Administrative
Notice-Israel,  at  2  (April  2019)  and  Israel  and  the  Golan  Heights  2018  Human  Rights
Report,  U.S.  Department  of  State  (March  2019).  Israel  is  a  close  ally  of  the  United
States.  Although  it  has  no  constitution,  Israel’s  unicameral  120-member  Knesset,  has
enacted a series of “Basic Laws” that enumerate fundamental rights. Implementation of
certain fundamental laws, orders, and regulations legally depend on the existence of a
“state of emergency,” which has been in effect since 1948. Under the Basic Laws, the
Knesset  has  the  power  to  dissolve  the  government  and  mandate  elections.  The
nationwide Knesset elections in 2015, which were considered free and fair, resulted in a
coalition government  led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The Knesset voted on
December 26 to dissolve itself and set April 9, 2019, as the date for national elections.
See Request for Administrative Notice, Israel, supra.
The United States and Israel participate in joint military planning and training and
have  collaborated  on  military  research  and  weapons  development.  There  have  been
incidents of  illegal export,  actual or attempted,  of  dual-use  technology  from  the  United
States to Israel.
The  United  States  has  disagreed  with  Israel  about  its  sale  of  U.S.  and  Israeli
technologies to other countries, such as China and Russia. Israel has been subjected to
numerous attacks from the Palestinians operating from the Gaza strip. See Request for

Country Status of Iraq
The Federal Republic of Iraq (Iraq) is a constitutional parliamentary republic. The
outcome  of  the  2014  parliamentary  elections  generally  met  international  standards  of
free  and  fair  elections  and  led  to  the  peaceful  transition  of  power  from  former  prime
minister Nuri al-Maliki to prime minister Haider al-Abadi. See Request for Administrative
Notice-Federal Republic of Iraq (Iraq) at 2 and 2018 Crime and safety Report: Baghdad,
U.S. Department of State (Fen 2018).
In  2003,  a  U.S.-led  coalition  invaded  Iraq  and  succeeded  in  removing  Saddam
Hussein  and  his  Ba’athist  regime  from  military  and  political  power.  See  the  World
Factbook: Iraq, U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (Feb. 2018); Background Note, Iraq, at
3,  U.S.  Dept.  of  State  (Feb.  2008).After  two  years  of  operations  under  a  provisional
authority,  Iraq’s  new  government  assumed  office  in  March  2006  (with  the  approval  of
the U.S. government), following free elections. (id)
Since  March  2006,  the  government  of  Iraq  has  been  comprised  of  a  broad
coalition of political alliances representing the Shiite, Sunni, and Kurdish blocs. See the
World Factbook: Iraq, supra, at 2; Background Note, Iraq, supra, at 8.  While elections
have  been  held,  none  of  the  key  constituent  groups  have  been  able  to  form  a
government,  adopt  an  oil  law,  establish  and  maintain  effective  security  throughout  the
provinces, or neutralize sectarian divisions. In this still very fragile political environment
in  Iraq,  there  are  substantiated  reports  of  human  rights  abuses  that  continue  to
underscore a still pervasive climate of tension and violence.
Iraq’s economy continues to be dominated by the oil sector, as it has for the past
half century since the completion of new  pipelines to Lebanon in 1949, and to Syria in
1952. See the World Factbook: Iraq, supra; Background Note, Iraq, supra. As a result of
the U.S.-led invasion in 2003, much of Iraq’s oil-refining capabilities were shuttered. The
rebuilding of oil infrastructure and utilities infrastructure has continued to expand since
2004 with U.S. aid and support, despite setbacks from insurgent activity.
Proposed  oil  revenue-sharing  legislation  among  the  three  war-hardened  ethno-
sectarian  divisions  (Shia,  Sunni,  and  Kurds)  still  awaits  passage  after    four  years  of
stalled  negotiations,  and  at  the  moment,  there  are  no  good  estimates  of  when  such
legislation will be approved and implemented. See Statement of the Record, Worldwide
Threat  Assessment  of  the  U.S.  Intelligence  Community,  U.S.  Director  of  National
Intelligence  (Jan.  2019)    For  the  foreseeable  future,  the  national  government  can  be
expected to continue to seek the passage and implementation of a revenue sharing law
to strengthen and encourage the development of this important sector.
Despite Iraq’s producing 4.3 million barrels of oil per day, according to published
reports,  Iraq’s population  remains  poor.  See  Putting  Iraq-KRG’s  Oil Relations on Solid
Ground,  the Washington  Institute  on  Near  East  Policy  (July  2018)  Currently,  the  case
brought by the federal government of Iraq against the KRG in 2012 over the legality of
the  KRG’s  oil  contracts  and  independent  exports  remains  pending  with  no  predictable
outcome in the near future. See id.
Past  budget  laws  passed  by  Iraq’s  national  parliament  requiring  the  KRG  to
contribute  certain  export  earnings  in  the  country’s  overall  exports  (a  law  that  would
seem  to  legitimate  the  KRG’s  ownership  claims  to  Kirkuk  oil)  have  never  led  federal
authorities  to  export  Kirkuk-produced  oil.  In  so  doing,  Iraq’s  federal  authorities  have
severely limited Iraq’s northern export outlet via the Kurdish pipeline to Turkey. Breaking
the oil-stalemate that existed for years between the KRG and Iraq’s federal government
can  have  major  positive  ramifications  for  not  only  Iraq  and  its  oil  exports,  but  for  the
United States and other Western interests as well.
Terrorism and human rights issues
Despite  recent  developments  in  its  security  enforcement  efforts,  Iraq  remains  a
very  dangerous,  volatile,  and  unpredictable  country.  The  U.S.  State  Department
continues  to  strongly  warn  U.S.  citizens  against  traveling  to  Iraq.  See  Request  for
Administrative Notice, Iraq, at 3-4; Travel Advisory-Iraq, U.S. Department of State (May
2019) The State Department assessed Iraq as being a critical-threat location for crime
directed  at  or  affecting  official  U.S.  interests.  See  2019  Crime  and  Safety  Report:
Baghdad at 2-3, U.S. Department of State (Feb 2019). While crime statistics and crime
reporting mechanisms are incomplete and inconsistent, the vast majority of individuals
under contract with, or employed by, the U.S. Government in Iraq are required to travel
with  a  protective  security  detail,  so  as  to  limit  potential  criminal  threats  against  them.
(id.)
Attacks against military and civilian targets throughout Iraq continue and include
sites  and  facilities  where  foreign  tourists  frequently  visit:  hotels,  restaurants,  police
stations,  check  points,  foreign  diplomatic  missions,  international  organizations,  and
other  locations  with  expatriate  personnel.  See  Request  for  Administrative  Notice,  Iraq,
supra;  Travel  Advisory-Iraq,  supra.  The  U.S.  Embassy’s  ability  to  provide  consular
services  to  U.S.  citizens  outside  Baghdad  is  extremely  limited  under  the  security
environment that still exists in Iraq. See Request for Administrative Notice, Iraq, supra;
Country  Information:  Iraq:  Safety  and  Security,  U.S.  Dept.  of  State  (June  2018).The
U.S. Government considers the potential personal security threats to U.S. personnel in
Iraq  to  be  serious  enough  to  require  them  to  live  and  work  under  strict  security
guidelines.  To  deal  with  expanded  terrorist  attacks  against  U.S.  citizens  in  Iraq,
temporary movement restrictions on U.S. Embassy personnel (both inside and outside
the  international  zone)  have  been  imposed.  See  Iraq  2019  Crime  and  Safety  Report,
supra.
In  December 2015,  President  Obama  signed  into  law  the  Visa Waiver Program
Improvement and Terrorist  Travel Protection  Act  of  2015,  which  amended  the existing
Waiver Program. See Request for Administrative Notice, supra, at 4-5. Under the 2015
amendment,  citizens  of  Iran,  Iraq,  Sudan,  and  Syria  are  ineligible  to  travel  or  be
admitted to the United States under the Visa Waiver Program.
Iraq’s  human  rights  record  remains  a  poor  one.  Based  on  the  U.S.  State
Department’s  most  recent  annual  human  rights  report,  violence  continued  throughout
2017-2018, largely fueled by the actions of the Islamic state in Iraq (ISIS). See Request
for  Administrative  Notice,  Iraq,  supra,  at  3-4;  Statement  for  the  Record,  Worldwide
Threat  Assessment  of  the  U.S.  Intelligence  Community,  U.S.  Director  of  National
Intelligence  (Jan.  2019).  After  liberating  all  territory  taken  by  ISIS  by  the  end  of  2017,
Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) have continued to pursue and restrict ISIS forces still active
in Iraq.
Reports  of  human  rights  abuses  also  include  allegations  of  unlawful  killings  by
some  members  of  the  ISF  (particularly  by  some  members  of  the  Popular  Mobilization
10
forces),  torture,  harsh  and  life-threatening  conditions  in  detention  and  prison  facilities,
criminalization of libel and other limits on freedom of expression, widespread corruption,
greatly  reduced  penalties  for  so-called  honor  killings,  coerced  or  forced  abortions
imposed by ISIS on its victims, legal restrictions imposed on the freedom of movement
of  women,  and  trafficking  in  persons.  See  Request  for  Administrative  Notice,  Iraq,
supra; Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2018: Iraq, U.S. Department of
State (March 2019)
Current U.S. Relations with Iraq
The  U.S.  mission  in  Iraq  remains  dedicated  to  building  a  strategic  partnership
with Iraq and the Iraqi people. See U.S. Relations with Iraq at 1-2, U.S. Department of
State  (July  2018).  In  coordination  with  the  Global  Coalition  to  defeat  ISIS,  the  United
States  assisted  Iraq’s  efforts  to  achieve  the  long-sought  goal  of  liberating  all  of  Iraqi
territory  from  ISIS.  The  Strategic  Framework  Agreement  (SFA)  between  Iraq  and  the
United States provides the basis of the United States’ bilateral relationship with Iraq and
covers  a  wide  range  of  bilateral  issues,  including  political  relations  and  diplomacy,
defense  and  security,  trade  and  finance,  energy,  judicial  and  law  enforcement  issues,
services, science, culture, education, and environment. (id.)
U.S.  bilateral  assistance  to  Iraq  is  considerable  and  stresses  economic  reform,
assistance  to  vulnerable  groups,  and  democracy  and  governance.  See  U.S.  Relations
with  Iraq,  supra.  U.S.  security  assistance  supports  the  development  of  modern,
accountable,  fiscally  sustainable,  and  professional  Iraqi  military  resources  capable  of
defending Iraq and its borders. The United States has designated Iraq as a beneficiary
developing  country  under  the  Generalized  System  of  Preferences  Program  and  has
been proactive in the promotion of two-way  trade between the United States and Iraq.
(id., at 2)
Noteworthy,  Iraq’s  re-integration  into  the  international  community  has  been
marked  by  their  demonstrated  cooperation  with  international  institutions,  including  the
United  Nations,  International  Monetary  Fund,  World  Bank,  and  the  Arab  League.  (id.)
Based  on  a  consideration  of  the  developed  record,  heightened  risks  associated  with
Applicant’s husband’s ownership interest of land in Iraq are insubstantial.
Recent  attacks  by  Iranian  militia  groups  on  the  U.S.  Embassy  in  Baghdad
strongly  illustrate  the  threat  that  Iran  poses  to  U.S.  security  interests  in  Iraq.  See  R.
Burns & E. Knickmeyer, Attack on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad Demonstrates Tough
Choices for President Trump, Time (Jan. 2020) In a public statement, President Trump
held  Iran  fully  responsible  for  the  attack,  but  stopped  short  of  suggesting  any  military
retaliation  would  be  forthcoming.  (id.)    The  breach  of  the  U.S.  Embassy  compound  in
early January 2020, which prompted the United States to send military reinforcements,
but  caused  no  known  U.S.  casualties  or  evacuations,  also  revealed  growing  strains
between the United States and Iraq and raised questions and concerns about the future
of the U.S. military mission in the country. Currently, the United States has about 5,200
troops  in  Iraq,  whose  mission  lies  mainly  in  training  Iraqi  forces  and  helping  them
combat ISIS extremists in the region. (id.)
11
Tensions with Iran have escalated since the Embassy breach, with the directed
drone strike by President Trump that killed Iraq’s top general Quasem Soleimani and his
deputy (Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis), a leading Iraqi militia leader, along with eight people.
See  Wall  Street  Journal.  and  other  news  accounts  of  the  drone  strike.  Iran  has
responded  to  the  drone  strike  with  threats  of  harsh  revenge  on  U.S.  military
installations.
Anticipating  retaliatory  attacks  on  U.S.  diplomatic  and  military  personnel  in  the
region,  the  United  States  announced  its  intended  deployments  of  additional  troops  to
meet  whatever retaliatory  challenges  the  United  States  may  face from  Iran.   See Wall
Street  Journal  and  other  news  accounts.  Secretary  of  State  Pompeo  and  other  high-
ranking DoD officials have characterized the drone strike as defensive action to protect
U.S. diplomatic and military personnel abroad, and reaffirmed U.S. commitments to de-
escalation. See CNN and other news reports.
In a region still on edge from the killing of Iran’s most prominent military leader,
Iranian officials and President Trump traded threats of escalating military action. Other
accounts  from  Iraq  confirmed  that  the  killing  of  Soleimani  on  Iraqi  soil  and  the  earlier
U.S.  airstrikes that  killed 25  members of the  Kataib  Hezballah militia  have fueled  calls
for  the  expulsion  of  U.S.  troops  from  Iraq.  See  CNN  and  other  news  accounts  of
unfolding events in Iraq. Published suggestions of a U.S. troop withdrawal in response
to  a  previous  passage  of  a  non-binding  Iraq  resolution  calling  for  the  expelling  of  all
foreign  troops  from  Iraq  have  since  been  reversed  by  the  Pentagon.  See  Wall  Street
Journal. and CNN reports and other news sources. And, in Iran, reports have circulated
that  a  successor  to  General  Soleimani  as  Iran’s  Quds  force  commander  has  been
appointed. (id.)
Keeping with its threats to mount retaliatory attacks against U.S. military facilities,
Iran  struck  the  highly  fortified  U.S.-Iraq  Green  Zone  of  Baghdad  with  a  barrage  of
rockets  before  pulling  back.  See  Wall  Street  Journal  and  other  news  sources.  While
both the United States and Iran can claim strategic returns as they pulled back from the
brink  of  war,  the  longstanding  competing  goals  of  these  longstanding  adversaries
remain.  The  United  States  wants  Iran  to  return  to  the  table  to  renegotiate  the  Joint
Comprehensive  Plan  of  Action  (JCPOA)  regarding  Iran’s  nuclear  program  that  the
United  States,  its  allies,  and  Iran  agreed  to  in  April  2015.  Iran  and  its  proxies,  by
contrast, seek the expelling of U.S. forces from not only Iraq, but the entire Middle East
region.  See  Wall  Street  Journal  and  other  news  sources.  Their  stated  goals  are  not
easily  reconcilable  and  will  require  sustained  efforts  on  both  sides  to  revise  their
structures of conflict and diplomatic disconnects. Only time will tell what, when, and how
they  can  reconcile  their  differences  in  accordance  with  international  norms  of  state
conduct.

"In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with one brief comment, all of the
factual allegations pertaining to foreign influence (SOR ¶¶ 1.a. through 1.c.). Applicant’s
admissions  and  brief  comment  are  incorporated  herein  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a
complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration
of same, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Background
Applicant is a native-born U.S. citizen whose parents returned with him to Taiwan
when he was an infant. He returned to the United States sometime between 2003 and
2005. He is a 34-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a
senior electrical engineer with his current employer since June 2017. He was a systems
engineer  with  another  defense  contractor  from  July  2011  until  December  2015.  He
received  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2011,  and  a  master’s  degree  in  2017,  both  from  a
respected U.S. university. He has never served with the U.S. military or any other military.
He  has  never  held  a  security  clearance.  He  has  never  been  married,  and  he  has  no
children. (Item 3, at 5, 13-17; Item 4, at 3-4)
Foreign Influence
To protect his privacy, general source information pertaining to Applicant and his
family members discussed below can be found in the following exhibits: Item 3 (SF 86);
and Item 4 (Enhanced Subject Interview).
As noted above, Applicant is a native-born U.S. citizen. At the age of 18, because
he was born in the United States to a citizen of Taiwan, he made the choice to renounce
his Taiwanese citizenship and he declared himself a U.S. citizen. (Item 3, at 5-7; Item 4,
at  3)  Applicant’s  parents  divorced  in  approximately  2002,  with  his  mother  obtaining
custody  of  him.  His  mother,  in  her  60s,  is  a  native-born  citizen  of  Taiwan,  residing  in
Taiwan. Until she retired between July 2017 and April 2019, she was an employee in an
unspecified  position  of  a  local  private  technical  college  in  Taiwan.  She  never  had  any
affiliation  with  either  the  Taiwanese  or  PRC  governments,  military,  security,  defense
industry,  foreign  movement,  or  intelligence  services.    In  July  2017,  Applicant  reported
monthly telephone or e-mail contact with his mother. (Item 3, at 23-25; Item 2, at 1)
Applicant’s father, also in his 60s, is a native-born citizen of Taiwan, residing in
Taiwan. Because his relationship with his father is more distant, Applicant does not know
the identity of his father’s employer, and he has no knowledge of any affiliation with either
the  Taiwanese  or  PRC  governments,  military,  security,  defense  industry,  foreign
movement, or intelligence services. In July 2017, Applicant reported annual contact with
his father. (Item 3, at 24-26)
Applicant’s  sister,  in  her  20s,  is  a  native-born  citizen  of  Taiwan,  with  a  legal
residence in Taiwan, but currently residing in the United States where she is attending
the same university from which Applicant graduated. She never had any affiliation with
either the Taiwanese or  PRC governments, military, security, defense industry, foreign
movement, or intelligence services. In July 2017, Applicant reported weekly contacts with
his sister. (Item 3, at 26-27; Item 4, at 6-7)
Applicant  previously  received  an  inheritance,  through  his  parents,  from  his
grandparents in Taiwan that he used to finance his education in the United States. (Item
4, at 6) He has no foreign assets or foreign financial interests controlled by him or on his
behalf. (Item 3, at 66)
Taiwan
In 1949, a large number of Chinese refugees fled from the civil war in mainland
China and  immigrated  to  the off-shore  Island  of  Formosa, now  known  as Taiwan. The
Communists in mainland China, under the leadership of Mao Tse-tung, established the
PRC, and Chiang Kai-shek, the leader of the Kuomintang on mainland China, established
a provisional government and capital in Taipei, Taiwan. The PRC refuses to recognize
Taiwan’s  independence,  and  insists  that  there  is  only  “one  China.”  After  recognizing
Taiwan  for  nearly  30  years,  on  January  1,  1979,  under  the  1979  U.S.  –  PRC  Joint
Communique,  the  United  States  formally  switched  its  position  and  recognized  the
government of the PRC as the sole legitimate government of China. Although the United
States does not support independence for Taiwan and, under the Taiwan Relations Act
(TRA), signed into law on April 10, 1979, it is committed to a “one-China policy,” the U.S.
commitment to assist Taiwan in maintaining its defensive capability is enshrined in the
TRA.  Furthermore,  because  the  United  States  and  Taiwan  enjoy  a  robust  unofficial
relationship,  the  United  States  has  been  also  been  committed  to  maintaining  cultural,
commercial and other nonofficial relations with Taiwan, and continues to provide arms in
support of Taiwan’s security and region stability. The American Institute in Taiwan (AIT)
is  responsible  for  implementing  U.S.  policy  toward  Taiwan.  In  this  regard,  the  United
States  insists  on  the  peaceful  resolution  of  cross-Strait  differences,  opposes  unilateral
changes to the  status quo  by  either side,  and  encourages  both  sides  to  continue  their
constructive dialogue on the basis of dignity and respect.
Taiwan  is  a  multi-party  democracy  with  a  strong  economy,  with  significant
economic contacts with both the PRC and the United States. In fact, the PRC is Taiwan’s
largest trading partner, export market, and source of imports. The United States stands
in second place. Taiwan’s own national security remains under constant threat from the
PRC since the PRC has not renounced the use of force against Taiwan, and this has led
to  Taiwan’s  large  military  establishment.  Taiwan’s  armed  forces  are  equipped  with
weapons obtained primarily from the United States, but Taiwan has stressed military self-
reliance in recent years which has resulted in the growth of indigenous military production.
Following  the  election  of  Taiwan  President  Tsai  Ing-wen  of  the  Democratic
Progressive  Party  (DPP)  in  2016,  the  PRC  dramatically  increased  its  coercion  efforts
against  Taiwan.  The  major  reason  for  those  increased  coercive  efforts  was  the  DPP’s
unwillingness to explicitly endorse the exact verbiage of the “one China” formulation while
maintaining the status quo. In retaliation, the PRC has taken significant steps to disrupt
the  cross-Strait  diplomatic
truce;  suspend  or  cancel  official  and  semi-official
communication  and  meetings;  isolate  and  undermine  the  Taiwanese  President;
destabilize the Taiwan society itself though “United Front Work”; interfere in relationships
between  Taiwan  and  other  nations;  interfere  in  Taiwan’s  efforts  to  participate  in
international activities; pressure U.S. and foreign companies doing business in Taiwan;
and spreading disinformation through social media and other online tools.
Taiwan  is  believed  to  be  an  active  collector  of  U.S.  economic  intelligence  and
proprietary information. There is no evidence that Taiwan uses coercive measures to gain
access  to  such  information.  While  there  have  been  a  number  of  incidents  involving
individuals,  companies,  and  Taiwanese  intelligence  officers  improperly  acquiring  U.S.
economic intelligence and proprietary information, there is no direct or indirect connection
to, or involvement with, Applicant or his family members.
PRC
The PRC is an international bully without regard for democracy or civil rights. It
has  an  authoritarian  Communist  government,  with  powerful  military  forces,  including
strategic nuclear weapons and missiles. It is geographically vast and has a population of
over a billion people. It has significant resources and an economy that in recent years has
expanded substantially. In the PRC, reported human rights problems include suppression
of  political  dissent,  arbitrary  arrest  and  detention,  forced  confessions,  disappearance,
torture and mistreatment of prisoners, and “arbitrary or unlawful deprivation of life.” The
PRC  also  monitors  telephone  conversations,  facsimile  transmissions,  e-mail,  text
messaging, and internet communications, and sometimes nonconsensual monitoring with
listening devices and surreptitious searching of hotel guestrooms.
The  PRC  has  been  characterized  as  “the  most  aggressive  country  conducting
espionage  against  the  United  States,  focusing  on  obtaining  U.S.  information  and
to
the
[PRC’s]  military  modernization  and  economic
technologies  beneficial
development.” Those activities include economic espionage, theft of trade secrets, export
control  violations,  and  technology  transfer.  It  actively  collects  military,  economic  and
proprietary, industrial information about the United States of the following types, including:
information  and  communications  technology;  military  technologies,  particularly  marine
systems and aerospace and aeronautics; civilian and dual-use technologies, especially
clean  technologies,  advanced  materials  and  manufacturing  techniques,  healthcare,
pharmaceuticals,  and  related  technologies,  and  agricultural  technology;  and  business
information,  especially  energy  and  other  natural  resources  and  macroeconomic
information. Americans of Chinese ancestry are considered prime intelligence targets by
the PRC. “The crux of the [PRC] approach is not to try to exploit a perceived vulnerability
but  to  appeal  to  an  individual’s  desire  to  help  [the  PRC]  out  in  some  way  .  .  .  ethnic
targeting  to  arouse  feelings  of  obligation  is  the  single  most  distinctive  feature  of  [the
PRC’s]  intelligence  operations.”  The  PRC’s  pursuit  of  intellectual  property,  sensitive
research and development plans, and U.S. Person data, remains a significant threat to
the  U.S.  government  and  private  sector.  U.S.  Immigration  and  Customs  Enforcement
officials have characterized PRC’s espionage and industrial theft activities as the leading
threat to the security of U.S. technology.
While  there  have  been  a  number  of  criminal  incidents  involving  individuals,
companies,  and  PRC’s  intelligence  officers  improperly  acquiring  U.S.  economic
intelligence  and  proprietary  information,  there  is  no  direct  or  indirect  connection  to,  or
involvement with, Applicant or his family.

3-6)
When  Applicant’s  parents  died  in  1987,  he  inherited  land  which  is  usable
farmland  and  worth  approximately  USD  $250,000.  (Item  5)  The  land  is  maintained  by
Applicant’s brothers. (SOR 1.e) He stated that he is thinking of selling the properties in
the  future,  but  it  is  difficult  to  live  in  the  United  States  and  sell  property  in  a  country
where  he  has  renounced  his birth  citizenship.  He  will  enlist  the  help  of  his  brothers  to
sell the property at some time.
In  2009,  Applicant  and  his  family  were  issued  Overseas  Citizen  of  India  travel
cards  which  allows  individuals  of  Indian  origin  to  travel  to  and  within  India.  Applicant

brothers or sisters have asked him about his work. His family is not associated with any
terrorist  organizations  or  military  groups.  He  was  candid  in  that  he  stated  that  he  has
affection for  India because  that  is where  his  siblings  live.  (Item  6) He  was  also  candid
when he noted that there is always a security risk due to his family living in India, but he
thinks he would be okay. (Item 6)

almost 20 years. (Item 2)
Administrative Notice
India  is  a  multiparty,  federal,  parliamentary  democracy,  with  a  bicameral
parliament  and  a  population  of  approximately  1.1  billion.  Its  political  history  since  it
gained  independence  from  Great  Britain  in  1947  has  included  several  armed  conflicts
with  Pakistan,  assassinations  of  two  prime  ministers,  sporadic  outbreaks  of  religious
riots,  and  violent  attacks  by  several separatist  and  terrorist  groups  in  different  parts of
the country. There is a continuing threat from terrorism throughout the country, including
attacks on targets where U.S. citizens or Westerners are known to congregate or visit.
India’s  size,  population,  and  strategic  location  give  it  a  prominent  voice  in
international  affairs.  India  has  always  been  an  active  member  of  the  United  Nations.
Starting this year, it is a non-permanent member of the Security Council, and it seeks a
permanent seat on the Security Council.
The  United  States  and  India  have  differences  over  India’s  nuclear  weapons
programs,  the  pace  of  India’s  economic  reforms,  and  India’s  bilateral  strategic
partnership with Iran. Nevertheless, the United States recognizes that India is important
to  U.S.  strategic  interests.  The  strategic  partnership  between  the  United  States  and
India  is  based  on  shared  values  such  as  democracy,  pluralism,  and  the  rule  of  law.
Since  2002,  the  United  States  and  India  have  held  a  series  of  substantive  combined
exercises involving all military services.
The United States is India’s largest foreign investment partner. Since December
2006, direct civilian nuclear commerce with India has been permitted. The two countries
have a common interest in the free flow of commerce and resources, including through
the vital sea lanes of the Indian Ocean.
The United States and India share a common interest in fighting terrorism and in
creating  a  strategically  stable  Asia.  They  are  seeking  to  foster  bilateral  relations  by
establishing working groups to address (1) strategic cooperation; (2) energy and climate
change; (3) education and development; (4) economics, trade, and agriculture; and (5)
science and technology, health, and innovation.
In  the past,  India  had long-standing  military  supply  relationships  with  the  Soviet
Union, and Russia remains India’s largest supplier of military systems and spare parts.
India  is  one  of  many  countries  engaged  in  economic  intelligence  collection  and
industrial espionage directed at the United States. The United States has longstanding
economic issues with India regarding protection of intellectual property rights and trade

The Indian Government generally respects the rights of its citizens, but there are
serious  problems  involving  abuses  by  police  and  security  forces.  Corruption  in  the
police  force  is  pervasive,  and  police  officers  often  act  with  impunity.  Abuses  by  police
and  security  forces  have  occurred  primarily  in  criminal  investigations  and  efforts  to
suppress separatist and terrorist groups. There is no evidence that India uses torture or
abuse against its citizens to extract economic intelligence.

Syria
The  Syrian  Arab  Republic  is ruled  by  an  authoritarian  regime  dominated  by  the
Socialist Ba’ath Party which is currently engaged in a full-scale civil war with the armed
Syrian opposition. Sources estimate that the conflict has resulted in over 400,000 deaths
with many thousands more wounded. The Syrian conflict has resulted in over 5.1 million
registered  Syrian  refugees,  and  approximately  6.3  million  people  are  displaced  inside
Syria, while 4.53 million remain in hard-to-reach and besieged areas. Attacks from the
regime or other groups could happen with little or no warning, no part of Syria should be
considered  immune  from  violence,  and  the  potential  exists  throughout  the  country  for
unpredictable and hostile acts, including kidnappings, sniper assaults, terrorist attacks,
small arms fire, improvised explosives, artillery shelling, airstrikes, the use of chemical
weapons,  large-  and  small-scale  bombings,  as  well  as  arbitrary  arrest,  detention,  and
torture.
The Department of State has issued a Level 4: Do Not Travel Advisory regarding
Syria, stating: “Do not travel to Syria due to terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, and armed
conflict.” The  U.S.  Embassy  in  Damascus  suspended  its operations  in  February  2012.
The Czech Republic serves as the protecting power for U.S. citizens in Syria. The range
of consular services that the Czech Republic provides to U.S. citizens is extremely limited,
and  the  U.S.  government  is  unable  to  provide  emergency  services  to  U.S.  citizens  in
Syria.  There  is  an  ongoing  and  increased  risk  of  kidnapping  of  U.S.  citizens  and
Westerners throughout the country. U.S. citizens remain a target, and many abductions
having occurred since mid-2012.
Despite successes, the terrorist landscape grew more complex in 2017. ISIS, al-
Qaida (AQ), and their affiliates have proven to be resilient, determined, and adaptable,
and they have adjusted to heightened counterterrorism pressure in Syria and elsewhere.
The return or relocation of foreign terrorist fighters from the battlefield has contributed to
a growing cadre of experienced, sophisticated, and connected terrorist networks, which
can plan and execute terrorist attacks. ISIS, AQ, and its affiliates continued to maintain
safe havens amidst the fragile political and security climate across the region, particularly
in Yemen and Syria.
President  Bashar  Assad  has  ruled  the  Syrian  Arab  Republic  since  2000.  The
constitution mandates the primacy of Ba’ath Party leaders in state institutions and society,
and Assad and Ba’ath party leaders dominate all three branches of government as an
authoritarian regime. An uprising against the government that began in 2011 continued
throughout  the  year.  The  2014  presidential  election  and  the  April  2016  parliamentary
elections resulted in the election of Assad and 200 People’s Council (Syrian parliament)
seats  for  the  Ba’ath  Party-led  National  Progressive  Front,  respectively.  Both  elections
took  place  in  an  environment  of  widespread  government  coercion,  and  many  Syrians
residing in opposition-held territory did not participate in the elections. Observers did not
consider the elections free or fair.
Designated in 1979 as a State Sponsor of Terrorism, Syria continued its political
and  military  support  to  a  variety  of  terrorist  groups.  The  regime  continued  to  provide
weapons and political support to Lebanese Hezbollah (LH) and continued to allow Iran to
rearm the terrorist organization. The Assad regime’s relationship with LH and Iran grew
stronger in 2017 as the regime became more reliant on external actors to fight regime
opponents.  President Bashar  al-Assad  remained a  staunch defender of  lran’s  policies,
while Iran exhibited equally energetic support for the Syrian regime.
Over  the  past  decade,  the  Assad  regime’s  permissive  attitude  towards  AQ  and
other terrorist groups’ foreign terrorist fighter facilitation efforts during the Syria conflict in
turn fed the growth of AQ, ISIS, and affiliated terrorist networks inside Syria. The Syrian
government’s awareness and encouragement for many years of terrorists’ transit through
Syria to enter Syria for the purpose of fighting Coalition Forces is well documented. Those
networks were among the terrorist elements that brutalized the Syrian population in 2017.
Additionally,  Shia  militia  groups,  some  of  which  are  U.S.  designated  Foreign  Terrorist
Organizations aligned with Iran, continued to travel to Syria to fight on behalf of the Assad
regime.
During  2018,  government-linked  paramilitary  groups  reportedly  engaged  in
frequent violations and abuses, including massacres, indiscriminate killings, kidnapping
of civilians, arbitrary detentions, and rape as a war tactic. Government-affiliated militias,
including  LH,  supported  by  Iran,  repeatedly  targeted  civilians.  The  Syrian  government
took no steps to investigate, prosecute, or punish officials who committed human rights
violations or abuses. Impunity was pervasive and deeply embedded in the security forces
and elsewhere in the government.
In  December 2015,  President  Obama  signed  into  law  the  Visa Waiver Program
Improvement and Terrorist  Travel Protection  Act  of  2015,  which  amended  the  existing
Visa Waiver Program. Under the 2015 amendment, citizens of Iran, Syria, Sudan, and
Syria are ineligible to travel or be admitted to the United States under the Visa Waiver
Program. The exclusion of these countries from waiver eligibility reflects the determination
of the Secretary of Homeland Security that the presence of an individual in that country
increases the likelihood that the individual is a credible threat to the national security of
the United States; that a foreign terrorist organization has a significant presence in the
country; or that the county is a safe haven for terrorists.
On September 24, 2017, President Trump suspended the  “entry into the United
States  of  nationals  of  Syria  as  immigrants  and  nonimmigrants”  due  to  “significant
inadequacies  in  [Syria’s]  identity-management  protocols,  [its  failure]  to  share  public-
safety and terrorism information,” and the country’s status as “the source of significant
terrorist  threats.”  Subject  to  limited  exceptions  for  dual-nationals,  current  visa  holders,
other narrow categories, and the Department of Homeland Security’s authority to waive
the ban “in the national interest,” Syrian nationals are categorically banned from entering
the United States.

"Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations with explanations. After a thorough
and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  testimony,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant  is  33  years  old,  divorced,  and  has  one  child.  He  has  a  bachelor’s
degree, and an associate’s degree with high honors. He is applying for national security
eligibility  and  a  security  clearance  in  connection  with  his  employment  with  a  defense
contractor  as  a  linguist.  This  is  his first  application  for  a  security  clearance.  (Applicant
Exhibit D; Tr. 89-90.)
Paragraph 1 – Guideline B (Foreign Influence)
Applicant  lived  in  Iraq  until  2007,  when  he  moved  to  Syria  for  a  better  life.  He
next  moved  to  Lebanon,  where  he  applied  for  refugee  status  to  the  United  States.
Refugee  status  was  granted  and  the  Applicant  moved  to  the  United  States  in  2009.
(Government Exhibit 3.)
Applicant worked in private industry outside the defense field until 2017, when he
began work with his current employer. He hoped to receive a security clearance, which
would result in a promotion at work, allowing him to be of more assistance to the troops
he is supporting, and put him in a better financial position in the United States. As of the
date  of  the  hearing  he  had  been  living  in  two  overseas  locations  for  over  a  year,
assisting  American  military  units  acting  as  trainers  for  foreign  military  members.
(Government Exhibits 1 at Section 13A, 2, and 3; Tr. 8-9, 44-47, 85, 108.)
Applicant  became  a  naturalized  American  citizen  on  June  18,  2014.  Applicant
renounced his Iraqi citizenship  when  he  became  an American  citizen.  He has no  Iraqi
identification of any type. Applicant has no financial contacts with Iraq. His savings are
in  the  United  States,  and  his  financial  situation  is  stable.  (Government  Exhibit  1  at
Sections 9 and 10; Tr.79, 92-94, 97-98, 103-112.)
Applicant  married  his  first  cousin  in  2004.  It  was  an  arranged  marriage.  They
separated  after  six  months.  Applicant’s  daughter  was  born  in  2005.  Applicant  did  not
see or talk to his wife or daughter from 2005 until 2015. In 2015, before he began work
as  a  linguist,  Applicant  visited  Iraq  using  his  American  passport  and  attempted  a
reconciliation with his wife. It was unsuccessful.  After being separated for many years,
Applicant has legally divorced his wife in accordance with Iraqi law, as shown by legal
documents in the record. He provides about $300 every two or three months in support
for  his  minor  daughter.  He  has  very  little  communication  with  his  daughter,  and  none
with  his  now  ex-wife.  He  has  no  plans  to  move  his  daughter  to  the  United  States.
(Government Exhibit 3 at 10; Applicant Exhibit E; Tr. 59-74, 77-78, 80-83, 95, 103.)
Applicant’s  mother  lives  in  Iraq.  He  also  has  a  brother  and  two  sisters.  His
mother has dementia. Applicant has occasional telephonic contact with his mother and
siblings.  He  sends  his  mother  about  $300  every  two  or  three  months  in  support.
Applicant’s mother lived in the United States with Applicant in 2012-2013, but returned
to Iraq. He has no plans to sponsor his  mother or siblings for emigration to the United
States. (Government Exhibit 3 at 10; Tr. 74-77, 84, 92, 94-97.)
Applicant

questionnaire  in  2017.  (Government  Exhibit  3.)  He  was  also  interviewed  by  an
investigator from the Office of Personnel Management in 2017 and 2018. (Government
Exhibit 2.) The information provided by Applicant during these occasions was consistent
with his testimony during the hearing.

Mitigation
Applicant  is  proud  to  be  an  American  citizen,  and  to  have  assisted  the  U.S.
military in overseas locations. He feels no sense of loyalty to Iraq, stating that he views
himself  as  “American-American,”  as  opposed  to  an  Iraqi-  or  Arab-American.  He  has
gone  on  many  missions  with  the  US  military,  transporting  sensitive  material  from  one
base  to  another  in  foreign  locations.  He  was  proud  to  be  involved  in  such  missions,
which he expressed at the time to the soldiers he was working with. (Tr. 50, 91-92, 105-
106.)
Applicant  was  a  highly  respected  and  successful  linguist  while  working  in  the
overseas  locations.  This  is  shown  by  letters  of  appreciation  and  certificates  of
achievement  presented  to  him  with  regard  to  his  work  during  the  period  from  2018
through  2019.  He  was  described  as  a  linguist  of  “unique  value,”  helping  secure  the
“safety  and  security”  of  American  forces  during  operations.  Applicant  has  a  sense  of
allegiance to the soldiers and civilians he worked with. Several of the letters describe in
detail  how  Applicant’s  conduct  was  above  the  average  for  linguists.  He  has  been
recommended  for  a  civilian  service  award  by  the  unit  he  is  currently  supporting.
(Applicant Exhibits A, B, C, F, G, and H; Tr. 86-88.)
One  of  the  soldiers  Applicant  worked  with,  an  Army  National  Guard  sergeant,
testified  on  Applicant’s  behalf.  He has  a  security  clearance.  Applicant  and  the  witness
worked together for eight months at an overseas location and have become friends. He
worked often with Applicant and described in detail the reasons Applicant was the most
trusted  linguist  within  his  unit.  Applicant  was  diligent,  always  willing  to  do  the  most
difficult  missions,  and  would  never  talk  about  what  he  did  when  off  the  job.  Applicant
directly expressed to the witness his pride in being involved in sensitive and potentially
dangerous missions. (Tr. 18-45.)
Applicant is very aware of his  responsibilities if he obtains a security clearance,
particularly  if  advances  are  made  toward  him  or  his  relatives.  He  is  knowledgeable  of
his security responsibilities, and is more than willing to fulfill them. (Tr. 98-102.)
Iraq
I take administrative notice of the following facts: In 2003, The United States led
a  coalition  to  remove  Saddam  Hussein  from  power  in  Iraq.  After  free  elections,  Iraq’s
new  government  took  office.  Despite  the  elections  and  new  government,  Iraq  remains
engulfed  in  violence,  perpetrated  by  Al  Qaeda  terrorists  and  other  insurgents.
Numerous attacks and kidnappings have targeted the U.S. Armed Forces, contractors,
and other civilians, as well as Iraqis. Even with aggressive governmental action against
terrorists,  the  threat  of  terrorism  in  Iraq  remains  high.  Terrorist  groups  conduct
intelligence  activities  as  effectively  as  state  intelligence  services.  (Hearing  Exhibit  I:

"Afghanistan is an Islamic Republic with a directly elected president, a bicameral
legislative branch, and a judicial branch. Afghanistan remains an important partner with
the  United  States  against  terrorism.  Afghanistan  works  with  the  U.S.  to  eliminate  the
remnants of al-Qaeda and its affiliates. The U.S. continues to invest U.S. resources to
help  Afghanistan  improve  its  security,  governance,  institutions  and  economy.  The
United  States’  strong  bilateral  relationship  with  Afghanistan  is  guided  by  the  Enduring
Strategic  Partnership  Agreement  (SPA)  between  Afghanistan  and  the  United  States
signed in May 2012, which lays out economic and political commitments, as well as by
the 2014 Bilateral Security Agreement, which lays out mutual security understandings.
In July 2012, Afghanistan was designated a Major Non-NATO ally.
The  U.S.  has  engaged  in  on-going  conflicts  in  Afghanistan  since  2001.  While
there  has  been  a  drawdown  in  the  number  of  U.S.  troops  in  Afghanistan,  troops  now
train Afghan forces. U.S. forces continue to disrupt and degrade al-Qaeda and Islamic
State activities in Afghanistan through partnered operations with Afghanistan, as well as
unilateral operations. It is a U.S. priority to rid Afghanistan of terrorism.
The  U.S.  Department  of  State,  however,  issued  a  travel  advisory  warning  U.S.
citizens  not  to  travel  to  Afghanistan  because  of  continued  instability  and  threats  by
terrorist  organizations  against  U.S.  citizens.  Afghanistan  also  has  significant  human
rights problems to include extrajudicial killings by security forces, ineffective government
investigations  of  abuse  and  torture  by  local  security  forces,  poor  prison  conditions,
arbitrary arrest and detention, and judicial corruption. Widespread disregard for the rule
of law poses a serious problem. (Item 5)
Russia
Russia  has  a  highly  centralized,  authoritarian  political  system  led  by  President
Vladimir  Putin.  Although  “[t]he  United  States  has  long  sought  a  full  and  constructive
relationship  with  Russia,”  current  relations  between  the  two  old  war  allies  appear  to
have again turned adversarial. Of note, in August 2017, the President signed into U.S.
law  sanctions  targeting  Russia  for,  in  part,  Russian  interference  in  the  2016  U.S.
elections  and  Russia’s  aggression  in  Ukraine,  including  its  continuing  unlawful
annexation of Crimea. In 2015, the (former) Director of National Intelligence reported to
Congress that the leading state intelligence threats to the United States will continue to
come from two main countries, one of which is Russia.
A  recent  human  rights  report  from  the  U.S.  State  Department  reflects  the
commission  of  significant  human  rights  violations  in  Russia,  including  restrictions  on
political participation and freedom of expression. It also noted the lack of due process in
politically motivated cases (Item 6)
Applicant is 61-year-old senior linguist. He first worked for his present employer
in about 2014. After a brief period of unemployment to due to downsizing, he was again
employed  as  a  linguist  in  approximately  July  2016.  His  commander  noted  that  his
services within a specialized area have been “indispensible,” and he lauded Applicant’s
skills.  (Supplemental  Response  to  FORM)  Applicant  is  a  dedicated  and  self-sufficient
worker. He has received a letter of appreciation from a member of the highest ranks for
his  commendable  enthusiasm,  unwavering  willingness  to  perform  his  duties  with  such
high  caliber,  and  “selfless  generosity  and  commitment.”  (SOR  Response,  attachment)
Several other letters of appreciation, recommendations, and certificates of appreciation
were also submitted by Applicant, reflecting his excellent work performance.
Applicant  was  born  and  raised  in  Afghanistan.  There,  Applicant  earned  both  a
bachelor’s  and  a  master’s  degree  in  engineering  before  starting  a  career  in  general
construction. In 1993, due to the upheaval and danger in Afghanistan, Applicant moved
his  family  to  Russia  as  refugees.  There,  he  leased  an  electronics  store  and  “worked
very  hard”  to  raise  the  funds  to  emigrate  to  the  United  States  in  2004.  He  left  Russia
when he was in his late 40s, first returning the business to its landlord. (SOR Response
at  2)  Applicant  and  his  family,  including  his  wife  and  six  adult  children,  became
naturalized U.S. citizens in early 2010. Applicant honors his oath as a U.S. citizen and is
committed to defending this country.
In  Afghanistan,  Applicant  left  a  brother  who  was  a  citizen  and  resident  of  that
country. The brother passed away in November 2016. (FORM Response) The two had
not communicated for a few years before the brother died.
Applicant  has  one  daughter  who  came  to  the  United  States  after  he  did.  She
remains  a  citizen  of  Afghanistan,  is  currently  a  registered  alien  living  in  the  United
States,  and  has  applied  for  U.S.  citizenship.  In  2014,  she  began  to  suspect  that  her
husband,  a  citizen  of  Afghanistan,  was  using  her  and  their  marriage  to  obtain  U.S.
residency. (SOR Answer at 2) This son-in-law, a citizen of Afghanistan, was last known
to be a U.S. resident.2 The couple divorced in late 2015. Neither Applicant nor his family
members maintain contact with this former in-law. Applicant’s daughter, like four of her
other siblings, lives near or with Applicant and his wife in the United States.
Applicant’s sixth child, another daughter, has remained a citizen and resident of
Russia. She and her husband, who is also a citizen and resident of Russia, have three
young children. In March 2012, Applicant’s wife filed a sponsoring petition on behalf of
this  daughter,  son-in-law,  and  children  to  immigrate  to  the  United  States.  (FORM
Response) That petition is still being processed. Applicant maintains bi-weekly contact
with his daughter through an Internet program.
Applicant’s Russian kin do not know of Applicant’s work and “have no idea that
[he]  worked  [in  a  capacity  aiding  the  United  States].”  (FORM  Response)  Only
Applicant’s  wife  knows  of  Applicant’s  work  and  his  place  of  employment.  No  family
member is in fear due to his work. (FORM Response) Applicant emphatically conveyed
that his  “family  members  do  not  represent a  cause  of  divided  loyalty”  for  him,  nor  can
they be used to coerce him into assisting a foreign power. (FORM Response) None of
his  family  members  are  affiliated  with  any  foreign  military  or  organizations.  Applicant
sends  no  money  to  his  family  members  abroad  because  he  has  “his  own  family
members  .  .  .  in  the  U.S.  and  [he  is]  working  hard  to  support  them,  and  they  are  [his]

"In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with one relatively brief comment,
all  of  the factual  allegations  pertaining to  foreign  influence  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a.  through 1.e.).
Applicant’s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and
thorough  review  of  the  evidence  in  the  record,  and  upon due  consideration of  same, I
make the following additional findings of fact:
Background
Applicant is a PRC-born, naturalized U.S. citizen, whose parents are PRC citizen-
residents. He entered the United States in 1985, and he was naturalized in 2001. He is a
61-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a senior enterprise
software  architect  with  his  current  employer  since  November  2015.  He  received  his
primary  education  from  PRC  schools,  as  well  as  a  bachelor’s  degree  from  a  PRC
university  in  1982.  He  received  a  doctorate  in  1991  from  a  respected  university  in  the
United States. He has never served with the U.S. military or any other military. It is unclear
if he ever held a security clearance. He was married in the PRC in 1988 to a PRC-born
U.S. citizen. He has one child, born in the United States in 1994.
Foreign Influence
To protect his privacy, general source information pertaining to Applicant and his
family members discussed below can be found in the following exhibits: Item 3 (SF 86);
and Item 4 (Enhanced Subject Interview).
Applicant and his wife have lived in the United States for over three decades, and
his adult daughter has resided here her entire life. As noted above, Applicant’s parents
are PRC citizen-residents. His nearly 100-year-old father was, before his retirement in the
early 1980s, a PRC military officer; and his mother, also in her 90s, was an employee of
a provincial broadcasting bureau. Applicant has two brothers and a sister, all of whom are
PRC citizen-residents: one brother, in his 60s, is an employee of an electrical company;
his  other  brother,  nearly  in  his  60s,  is  an  employee  in  the  technical  department  of  the
provincial broadcasting bureau; and his sister, in her 60s, was, before her retirement, a
laboratory technician with an industrial institute. He also has a half-sister, in her 70s, who
is a PRC citizen-resident, and she was employed by a natural resource institute affiliated
with a state university. None of Applicant’s family members have had any affiliation with
the PRC government, military, security, defense industry, or intelligence services, except
as  described  above.  In  November  2015,  Applicant  reported  monthly  to  quarterly
telephone or e-mail contact with them. (Item 3, at 26-36; Item 2, at 2)
Over a decade ago, Applicant provided approximately $2,000 to his mother. (Item
3, at 38) He has no foreign assets or foreign financial interests controlled by him or on his
behalf. (Item 3, at 38)
Applicant has taken two trips to the PRC: In 2009, he visited his family for between
11 and 20 days, and in 2014, he did so again for the same purpose and duration. (Item
3, at 41-45) His sister visited the United States in 2016 to attend his daughter’s college
graduation.  (Item  4,  at  2)  In  describing  the  relationships  that  he  has  with  his  family,
Applicant stated the following:
The nature of my relationships with my family members in China are such
that it is unlikely that I will be in a position of having to choose between the
interests  of  my  family  members  in  China  and  the  interests  of  the  United
States.
There is no conflict of interest because my sense of loyalty and obligation
to  my family  members  in  China  is so minimal compared  to my  deep  and
longstanding  relationships  and  loyalties  to  my  immediate  family  in  the
United States that  I  can  be expected  to  resolve  any  conflict of  interest  in
favor of the United States.
My  contact  and  communication  with  my  family  members  in  China  are  so
casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk
for foreign influence or exploitation.
I  understand  the  current  US-China  relations,  and  I  am  completely  on  the
United States side. In fact, my political views have been so different from
the Chinese government’s standings for decades.

PRC
The PRC is an international bully without regard for democracy or civil rights. It
has  an  authoritarian  Communist  government,  with  powerful  military  forces,  including
strategic nuclear weapons and missiles. It is geographically vast and has a population of
over a billion people. It has significant resources and an economy that in recent years has
expanded substantially. In the PRC, reported human rights problems include suppression
of  political  dissent,  arbitrary  arrest  and  detention,  forced  confessions,  disappearance,
torture and mistreatment of  prisoners,  and arbitrary  or unlawful deprivation  of  life. The
PRC  also  monitors  telephone  conversations,  facsimile  transmissions,  e-mail,  text
messaging, and internet communications, and sometimes nonconsensual monitoring with
listening devices and surreptitious searching of hotel guestrooms.
to
the
The  PRC  has  been  characterized  as  “the  most  aggressive  country  conducting
espionage  against  the  United  States,  focusing  on  obtaining  U.S.  information  and
technologies  beneficial
[PRC’s]  military  modernization  and  economic
development.” Those activities include economic espionage, theft of trade secrets, export
control  violations,  and  technology  transfer.  It  actively  collects  military,  economic  and
proprietary industrial information about the United States of the following types, including:
information  and  communications  technology;  military  technologies,  particularly  marine
systems, aerospace and aeronautics; civilian and dual-use technologies, especially clean
techniques,  healthcare,
technologies,  advanced  materials  and  manufacturing
pharmaceuticals,  and  related  technologies,  and  agricultural  technology;  and  business
information,  especially  energy  and  other  natural  resources  and  macroeconomic
information. Americans of Chinese ancestry are considered prime intelligence targets by
the PRC. “The crux of the [PRC] approach is not to try to exploit a perceived vulnerability
but  to  appeal  to  an  individual’s  desire  to  help  [the  PRC]  out  in  some  way  .  .  .  ethnic
targeting  to  arouse  feelings  of  obligation  is  the  single  most  distinctive  feature  of  [the
PRC’s]  intelligence  operations.”  The  PRC’s  pursuit  of  intellectual  property,  sensitive
research and development plans, and U.S. Person data, remains a significant threat to
the  U.S.  government  and  private  sector.  U.S.  Immigration  and  Customs  Enforcement
officials have characterized PRC’s espionage and industrial theft activities as the leading
threat to the security of U.S. technology.
While  there  have  been  a  number  of  criminal  incidents  involving  individuals,
companies,  and  PRC’s  intelligence  officers  improperly  acquiring  U.S.  economic
intelligence  and  proprietary  information,  there  is  no  direct  or  indirect  connection  to,  or
involvement with, Applicant or his family.

Financial Considerations
The  SOR  alleges  financial  consideration  security  concerns  based  on  six
allegations. The status of each allegation is as follows:
SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b  allege  Applicant  failed  to  timely  file  his  federal  and  state
income tax returns for tax years 2014, 2016, and 2017. He has resided overseas since
2013.  (Tr.  42;  SOR  response  at  1-2)  According  to  Executive  Order  No.  12744,  the
overseas  country  where  he  has  lived  has  been  designated  as  a  combat  zone  since
January  17,  1991,  for  purposes  of  filing  deadlines  for  tax  returns.  See  IRS  website,
Combat Zones Approved for Tax Benefits, https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/combat-zones.

IRS  website,  Eligibility  for  Military  Tax  Benefits,
extent  as  military  personnel.
https://www.irs.gov/individuals/military/eligibility-for-military-tax-benefits. (AE G)
According to Applicant’s state of residence Department of Taxation and Revenue,
Applicant does not need to file for an extension to file his tax return in his state of reference
because the  state  “honors  [his] federal automatic  extension of  time  to  file.” (AE I at  2)
Applicant believed that he was entitled by IRS and state tax rules not to file his tax returns
until  he  returned  to  the  United  States  from  his  overseas  deployments.  (Tr.  43-45)
Notwithstanding Applicant’s right not to file federal income tax returns under IRS and state
tax  filing  rules,  he  elected  to  file  his  tax  returns  in  2018.  He  has  filed  all  required  tax
returns. (Tr. 44-45) He intends to timely file all future required tax returns. (Tr. 72)
to  File  a  State  Tax  Return
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges Applicant owes $479 in delinquent state taxes for tax year 2017.
Applicant indicated he was not required to file a state tax return, and thus, he did not owe
taxes. (SOR response at  3) He also believed he did  not have to file a state tax return
because he was no longer a resident of the state. (Tr. 45) He may be incorrect about not
needing  to  file  a  state  tax  return  because  he  retained  his  home  in  the  state  and  may
therefore continue to be subject to that state’s taxes. See U.S. Tax Help website, Am I

Applicant  said  he  was  overseas  when  his  credit  card  was  illegally  used  in  the  United
States. (SOR response at 3) He indicated this debt is not his debt, and he is the victim of
identity  theft.  (Id.)  Applicant’s  January  26,  2021  credit  report  indicates  he  disputed  his
responsibility for the debt with the credit reporting company. (Tr. 48; GE 7)
SOR ¶ 1.e alleges Applicant’s mortgage account is more than 120 days delinquent
in the approximate amount of $7,962 on a total balance of $253,178. In 2009, Applicant
purchased his residence for $290,000 in the state where he was filing his state tax returns.
(Tr. 50-51) He understood when he obtained the funds from the mortgage company that
he was assuming the responsibility to make his mortgage payments. (Tr. 67) He was on
active duty and stationed at a nearby Air Force base. (Tr. 50-51) He said activity at the
Air Force base was subsequently reduced. (Tr. 51) He did not provide any statistical or
other corroborative information showing the base was reduced in population or economic
activity. He  said  the nearest town is economically depended on the Air Force base. (Tr.

per month when he qualified for  the loan. (Tr. 52) He  received a pay raise after he retired
from  the Air Force and became employed by a DOD  contractor. (Tr. 62)
From 2009 until September 2013, Applicant lived in his home. (Tr. 53) He made
his mortgage payments until March 2019. (Tr. 55, 65) He chose to stop making payments
on his mortgage for five reasons: (1) his home has been on the market for six years; (2)
the missions at the nearby Air Force base changed; (3) in January 2019, the house was
vandalized, and items were stolen from it such as furniture and appliances; (4) real estate
values  in  the  area  of  his  residence  decreased;  and  (5)  the  fair  market  value  of  his
residence may be down to about $160,000 to $170,000. (Tr. 57-58, 68, 86; SOR response
at 4) In January 2019, two vehicles and other items were stolen from his residence. (SOR
response at 4) He filed a police report and insurance claim for $30,000 after the 2019
burglary because of damage to his residence; however, his insurance claim was not paid.
(Tr. 83, 87) He stopped having the house cleaned after February 2019. (Tr. 88) Around
June  2019,  he  ended  his  relationship  with  a  real  estate  agent  who  was  attempting  to
market his property. (Tr. 88) He did not employ another real estate agent. (Tr. 88) Then
in 2021, there was a second theft from his house where the house was basically cleaned
out including parts of the plumbing. (Tr. 84) He has not yet filed a police report concerning
the second theft. (Tr. 84)
A real estate agent told Applicant around August 2020 that there was an offer to
purchase his residence; however, the real estate agent said it was about $50,000 under
expectations. (Tr. 85) The real estate agent suggested he let the house go into foreclosure
because there was no interest from purchasers apparently at the listed price. (Tr. 58-59)
The mortgage was already delinquent at the time the real estate agent suggested he let
the property go into foreclosure. (Tr. 68) He had some contacts from potential buyers;
however, none of them resulted in offers acceptable to the mortgage company. (Tr. 89)
He  did  not  detail  the  amounts  of  offers  or  indicate  he  actually  provided  them  to  the
mortgage company. He did not indicate the mortgage company’s acceptable price or how
much he would have to pay to complete the sale.
Applicant believed the mortgage lender foreclosed on his house; however, he had
not heard for sure what happened. (Tr. 59) He did not have any idea about how much his
liability might be. (Tr. 60) He was essentially waiting to hear from the mortgage lender
about  whether  they  wanted  money  from  him.  (Tr.  59-61)  He  indicated  after  paying  his
monthly  child  support  of  $800,  and  his  $1,891  monthly  mortgage  payment,  that  his
monthly remainder was about $3,000. (Tr. 65-66, 78, 83) He was capable of continuing
to make his mortgage payments. (Tr. 66-67, 80) There was no outside event in March
2019 that caused him to stop making his mortgage payments aside from his decision that
he was losing money by making his payments and his recognition that his property was
valued less than the mortgage or “underwater.” (Tr. 72)
Applicant’s  January  26,  2021  credit  report  reflects:  the  Department  of  Veterans
Affairs  (VA)  guaranteed  repayment  of  his  mortgage;  the  date  of  last  payment  was
February 2019; the past due amount was $41,839; and the monthly payment was $1,880.
(GE 8) Applicant was unaware of the amount the VA guarantee. (Tr. 80) The last time
Applicant checked the value of his residence on the Internet, he learned the value was
about $210,000 to $215,000. (Tr. 81)
Under VA rules, “The  veteran’s basic entitlement amount is $36,000. If  the loan
amount  exceeds  $144,000,  an  additional  amount  of  entitlement  is  available,  for  a
maximum entitlement of 25 percent of the Freddie Mac conforming loan limit for a single-
family residence (currently $417,000 . . . ).” VA website, VA Guaranteed Home Loans at
8,  available  at  https://www.benefits.va.gov/homeloans/documents/docs/va101handout
.pdf . . . . The maximum potential guaranty is $104,250, if the veteran has full eligibility.”
(HE 8) Applicant will  not have  to repay the VA  unless the VA  finds “evidence of fraud,
misrepresentation, or bad faith on [his] part.” VA website, VA help to avoid foreclosure,

the VA after he stopped making payments to the mortgage lender.

The Philippines
The U.S. and the Philippines maintain a close relationship stemming from the U.S.
colonial period (1898-1946), the bilateral security alliance bound by the Mutual Defense
Treaty of 1951, and common strategic and economic interests. Relations are based on
strong historical and cultural links and a shared commitment to democracy and human
rights. In 1946, the United States recognized the Philippines as an independent state and
established diplomatic relations. The U.S. has since designated the Philippines as a Major
Non-NATO Ally. Former U.S. President Barack Obama visited the Philippines in 2014 to
reaffirm the United States' commitment to the security alliance, and to discuss the United
States'  strategic  vision  for  the  bilateral  relationship.  President  Obama  noted  the  two
nations'  strong  people-to-people  ties,  commitment  to  peace  and  stability  in  the  Asia-
Pacific region, and commitment to build prosperity for our people and the global economy.
Although  the  U.S.  closed  its  military  bases  in  the  Philippines  in  1992,  the  two
nations have maintained security cooperation ever since. The Manila Declaration, signed
in 2011, reaffirmed the 1951 U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty as the foundation
for a robust, balanced, and responsive security partnership. Since 2012, the Philippines
has  played  a  key  role  in  the  U.S.  goal  of  rebalancing  foreign  policy  priorities  to  Asia,
particularly  as  maritime  territorial  disputes  between  China  and  other  claimants  in  the
South China Sea have intensified.
In  2014,  the  two  countries  confirmed  agreement  of  an  Enhanced  Defense
Cooperation Agreement (EDCA), which helps promotes the peace and stability that has
underpinned Asia's remarkable economic growth over the past six decades. The EDCA
allows for the increased presence of U.S. military forces, ships, aircraft, and equipment
in the Philippines on a nonpermanent basis and greater U.S. access to Philippine military
bases. As part of the security alliance, Members of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps have
conducted  Cooperation  Afloat  Readiness  and  Training  (CARAT)  exercises  with  the
Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) since 1995. The training exercises develop strong
partnerships that contribute to the greater peace and stability of the region and allow both
nations to gain valuable experience and increase our interoperability. The U.S. and the
Philippines have the same mission, that is, to further strengthen the Philippines' security
operations and maritime domain awareness capabilities. The U.S. has begun to provide
$40  million  in  technical  expertise,  training,  and  equipment  through  the  Global  Security
Contingency  Fund.  The  U.S.  is  also  helping  to  construct  a  Philippine  National  Coast
Watch Center in Manila.
In the past decade, the Philippines has been one of the largest recipients of U.S.
foreign  assistance  in  Southeast  Asia,  including  over  $143  million  following  Typhoon
Yolanda  (Haiyan)  in  2013.  U.S.  assistance  in  the  Philippines  fosters  broad-based
economic growth; improves the health and education of Filipinos; promotes peace and
security;  advances  democratic  values,  good  governance,  and  human  rights;  and
strengthens regional and global partnerships. The U.S. and the Philippines have a strong
trade and investment relationship, with over $25 billion in goods and services traded. As
the Philippine's third-largest trading partner, the U.S. is one of the nation’s largest foreign
investors. The Philippines has been among the largest beneficiaries of the Generalized
System  of  Preferences  program  for  developing  countries,  which  provides  preferential
duty-free access to the U.S. market. In 1989, the two countries signed a bilateral Trade
and Investment Framework Agreement and a tax treaty.
An enhanced engagement of 15 U.S. government agencies is aiming to address
the  most  significant  constraints  to  growth  in  the  Philippines  and  to  stimulate  inclusive
economic expansion through a Partnership for Growth (PFG). USAID and the Millennium
Challenge Corporation account for the majority of PFG financial resources amounting to
more than $750 million. The two countries have made enormous strides in deepening the
economic linkages between them, including: Removal of the Philippines from the Special
301  Watch  List,  based  on  significant  advances  in  the  protection  and  enforcement  of
intellectual  property  rights  and  considerable  progress  on  worker  rights  issues  in  the
Philippines,  which  will  allow  the  U.S.  government  to  close  a  Generalized  System  of
Preferences (GSP) review of worker rights in the Philippines without any change to the
Philippines' GSP trade benefits.
The Philippines and the U.S. share extensive people-to-people ties. About 350,000
Americans  reside  in  the  Philippines,  and  approximately  600,000  U.S.  citizens  visit  the
country each year. There are approximately four million people of Philippine descent in
the U.S. The Philippines has the world's oldest continuous operating Fulbright program:
the Philippine-American Educational Foundation, established in 1948. The U.S. has had
a Peace Corps program in the Philippines for over 50 years.
The Philippines is a multiparty, constitutional republic with a bicameral legislature.
President Rodrigo Roa Duterte, elected in May 2016, began his constitutionally limited
six-year term in June 2016.
Since the 1980’s at least five Americans, including Leandro Aragoncillo, have been
convicted  of  espionage,  or  espionage-related  crimes,  involving  transmission  of
information to the Philippines. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, there have
been numerous criminal cases concerning export enforcement related to the Philippines.
As  of  September  2020,  the  U.S.  Department  of  State  travel  advisory  for  the
Philippines  is  Level  3:  Reconsider  Travel  Due  to  COVID-19.  Additionally,  Exercise
Increased  Caution  due  to  crime,  terrorism,  civil  unrest,  a  measles  outbreak,  and
kidnapping. It directed Americans: Do Not Travel to the Sulu Archipelago, including the
southern Sulu Sea, due to crime, terrorism, civil unrest, and kidnapping and to Marawi
City in  Mindanao due  to  terrorism  and  civil unrest. It suggested citizens reconsider travel
to other areas of  Mindanao due  to crime, terrorism, civil  unrest,  and kidnapping. It noted
that the  Philippine government has declared a State of National Emergency on Account
of  Lawless Violence in  Mindanao.  Philippine government law enforcement agencies are
engaged in a nationwide  counternarcotics campaign that has resulted in  a sharp increase
in  violence between  police  and  individuals suspected of involvement in  the drug trade. As
part of this  campaign, law enforcement is engaged in aggressive search and  buy-bust
operations   that   could  affect   foreigners.   The   U.S.  Department  of  State  has  assessed
Manila as being a  high-threat  location for  terrorism  directed at  or  affecting official  U.S.
government interests.  Terrorist violence  continues to affect primarily the Mindanao region,
in the country’s south.
At least eight terrorist groups operate in the Philippines. For more than a decade,
terrorists, insurgents, and criminal actors have carried out major attacks against civilians.
In 2018, four notable attacks resulted in the deaths of two to eleven people and numerous
additional  people  were  injured.  In  2019,  the  Philippines  made  the  list  of  the  top  10
countries with the most terrorist incidents and the most terrorist casualties. There were
351  incidents  in  the  Philippines,  with  1,192  casualties  (3  percent  of  the  global  total  of
casualties). This constitutes a small increase in incidents over 2018, as well as a seven
percent increase in casualties. The most deadly attack involved a bombing of a Mass at
the Jolo Cathedral in Sulu killing 23 people and wounding 102. Multiple suicide bombings
in  the  Philippines  were  a  new  phenomenon  for  the  region.  On  August  24,  2020,  dual
suicide bombings in Jolo, Sulu and Mindanao, killed 15 people and injured 77 others.
The  State  Department  designated  the  Philippines  a  major  money  laundering
jurisdiction in 2019. The Philippines’ growing economy and geographic location within key
trafficking routes place it at elevated risk of money laundering and terrorism financing.
Recent growth in the online gaming industry also presents increased risk. Corruption and
human trafficking constitute some of the principal sources of criminal proceeds. Insurgent
groups  operating  in  the  Philippines  derive  funding  from  kidnapping  for  ransom  and
narcotics and arms trafficking. Additionally, the large volume of remittances from Filipinos
living abroad increases the monitoring burden on anti-money laundering authorities.
In its most recent annual human rights report, the State Department reported that
significant  human  rights  issues  included:  unlawful  or  arbitrary  killings,  including
extrajudicial killings, by and on behalf of the government and non-state actors; reports of
forced disappearance by and on behalf of the government and non-state actors; torture
by and on behalf of the government and non-state actors; arbitrary detention by and on
behalf  of  the  government  and  non-state  actors;  harsh  and  life-threatening  prison
conditions; arbitrary and unlawful interference with privacy; significant problems with the
independence of the judiciary; the worst forms of restrictions on free expression and the
press, including violence, threats of violence, and unjustified arrests or prosecutions of
journalists, censorship, and the existence of criminal libel laws; corruption; and unlawful
recruitment  or  use  of  child  soldiers  by  terrorists  and  groups  in  rebellion  against  the
government.
10
Concerns  about  police  impunity  increased  significantly  following  the  sharp
increase in killings by police in 2016. Significant concerns also persisted about impunity
for  the  security  forces,  civilian  national  and  local  government  officials,  and  powerful
business  and  commercial  figures.  Slow  judicial  processes  remained  an  obstacle  to
bringing government officials allegedly involved in human rights abuses to justice.

"Applicant  is  a  65-year-old  employee  who  is  seeking  to  obtain  a  security
clearance for his job as linguist, translator, and interpreter (Arabic) for a company that
does business in the defense industry. He has worked for this company since 2017. His
work is in support of the U.S. armed forces in the country of Kuwait. Before his current
job,  he  was  unemployed  from  March  2017  to  about  September  2017.  Before  that,  he
worked as a security guard for different firms during 2011-2017. He also had a period of
unemployment from November 2010 to July 2011.
Applicant was born in Sudan to Sudanese parents. He completed high school in
Sudan  in  1980,  and  then  earned  a  diploma  in  Arabic  Language  and  Islamic  Studies
from  a  university  in  Sudan  in  1985.  He  continued  his  education  in  the  United  States
where he attended two different educational institutions.
Applicant  came  to  the  United  States  in  2001  as  a  refugee.  (Tr.  15-16)  He  felt
compelled  to  depart  Sudan  in  1990  because  he  believed  he  would  be  targeted  as  an
educated Sudanese African as the regime was Sudanese Islamic. (Tr. 36-37) He lived
in  Egypt  during  1990-1994,  in  Saudi  Arabia  during  1994-1999,  and  again  in  Egypt
during  1999-2001.  He  became  a naturalized U.S.  citizen in 2006,  and his  most  recent
U.S.  passport  was  issued  in   2017.   (Exhibit  1)  He   explained   that  it  was  his  “dream”   to
become  a  U.S.  citizen   and   he  is  very   proud  of  doing   so.  (Tr.  16)  He   has  no  family
members  in  the  United  States,  as  they  are  all  presently  living  in   Sudan  as  citizens  of
that country.
Applicant’s  parents are deceased. His father passed  away many years ago and
his mother remarried. His mother passed away more recently in January 2019. (Exhibits
D and R) His two brothers and sister are citizens of and residents in Sudan. The same
is true for his five half-brothers and two half-sisters. Applicant is also married to a citizen
of  Sudan,  and  she  along  with  her  mother  and  father  reside  in  Sudan.  He  traveled  to
Sudan from January 2010 to April 2010; from April 2011 to July 2011; from March 2017
to July 2017; and mostly recently from December 2019 to January 2020. (Exhibit 2; Tr.
30-31)
One brother was a senior police officer with the Sudanese Ministry of Interior but
retired several years ago. (Tr. 19-20) Applicant spoke with him by telephone in January
2019  when  their  mother  passed  away  to  express  his  condolences.  (Tr.  20)  He  also
spoke with his other brother at the same time. Before their mother’s passing, he spoke
with  the  latter  brother  twice  a  month  because  that  brother  was  taking  care  of  their
mother.  (Tr.  20-21)  He  has  not  spoken  with  his  two  brothers  since  January  2019.
Applicant’s  sister  was  a  member  of  the  Sudanese  Parliament  during  the  Bashir
government,  but  she  is  no  longer  a  member  after  the  regime  change.  (Tr.  21-22)  He
spoke with his sister when their mother passed, but otherwise had not spoken with her
in ten years. (Tr. 22) His sister is now a housewife. (Tr. 34)
Concerning   his  five  half-brothers,  Applicant   is  aware  that  one   is  employed  as  a
customs police  officer  with the Sudanese Ministry of  Interior. (Tr. 23)  He  is unaware of
the employment activities of the other half-brothers.  (Tr.  34-35) He  is also aware that his
two half-sisters are housewives as they have  husbands and  children of their own.  (Tr.
35) He has little to no communication or relationships with his half-siblings. (Tr. 23-24)
Applicant  married  a  Sudanese  woman  in  2014.  (Exhibit  1)  She  gave  birth  to  a
son in 2016, but the child passed away after a year due to malaria. (Tr. 29-30, 40-41)
He has no other children from the marriage. His spouse continues to live in Sudan as a
housewife  and  he  provides  her  financial  support  of  about  $200  monthly,  which  is
sufficient to meet her needs. He retained the services of an immigration lawyer who, as
of  October  2020,  anticipated  filing  an  immigration  petition  soon  despite  the  current
restriction of immigration from Sudan. (Exhibit E) In addition to his spouse, Applicant’s
mother-in-law and father-in-law are also citizens of and residents in Sudan.
Applicant  does  not  have  business,  financial,  or  property  interests  in  Sudan.  He
has checking and savings accounts with a U.S. financial institution but no other financial
accounts here. He does not own a home or other real estate in the United States. He is
a registered voter and has exercised that right. He also has a driver’s license issued by
his state of residence in the United States. He is using a friend’s address as his current
residential address in the United States. (Tr. 38-39)
Concerning   the  country  of  Sudan,  the   relevant  facts   are  outlined  in   Department
Counsel’s request for  administrative notice. (Exhibit 9) Of  particular note is that Sudan
was designated a State Sponsor of Terrorism in  1993 and  remained so until  its removal
from  the  State  Department’s  list  in   December  2020.  The   Sudanese  government  was
overthrown  in   April  2019,  and   the  transition  to  a  new   government  was  not  entirely
peaceful. Sudan’s removal   from that list represents a fundamental change in the U.S.-
Sudan  relationship and allows for  the United States to  provide  more robust support  for
Sudan. Sudan has also had a dismal human-rights record.
The  SOR  alleged  and  Applicant  admitted  a  history  of  financial  problems.  In
addition  to  his  admissions,  the  factual  allegations  in  the  SOR  are  established  by  the
documentary  evidence.  (Exhibits  5-7)  The  SOR  concerns  seven  delinquent  debts
(charged off or in collection) in amounts ranging from $85 to $6,137 for a total of about
$9,462. He attributed the delinquent accounts to the low income he earned working as a
security guard while at the same time paying for educational expenses. (Tr. 28-29) He
presented reliable documentation showing that he paid or settled the seven delinquent
accounts during 2019-2020. (Exhibits I, J, K, L, M, P, and Q). Those matters are found
to be resolved.
Law and Policies
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (E.O.)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of
Defense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review
Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  National  Security
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.
It  is  well-established  law  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.1  As
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side  of  denials.”2  Under  Egan,  Executive  Order  10865,  and  the  Directive,  any  doubt
about  whether  an  applicant  should  be  allowed  access  to  classified  information  will  be
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that
the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3  The Appeal Board has
followed  the  Court’s  reasoning,  and  a  judge’s  findings  of  fact  are  reviewed  under  the
substantial-evidence standard.4

There is no  presumption in  favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access  to  classified  information.5   Under  the   Directive,  the  parties  have   the  following
burdens:  (1)  Department  Counsel  has  the  burden  of   presenting   evidence   to  establish
facts alleged in  the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for
presenting  evidence   to  refute,  explain,  extenuate,  or   mitigate  facts  that  have   been
admitted or  proven; and  (3)  an applicant  has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain
a favorable clearance decision.6
Discussion
Under Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may
be  questioned  or  put  into  doubt  when  that  applicant  has  a  history  of  excessive
indebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG
¶ 18 as follows:
Failure  or  inability  to   live  within   one’s  means,  satisfy  debts,   and   meet
financial  obligations  may  indicate  poor  self-control,   lack  of   judgment,   or
unwillingness  to  abide  by  rules  and   regulations,  all  of  which   can  raise
questions  about  an  individual’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and   ability  to
protect classified or sensitive information. . . .
The  concern  is  broader  than  the  possibility  that  a  person  might  knowingly
compromise  classified  or  sensitive  information  to  obtain  money  or  something  else  of
value.  It  encompasses  concerns  about  a  person’s  self-control,  judgment,  and  other
important qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,
unconcerned,  or  negligent  in  handling  and  safeguarding  classified  or  sensitive
information.
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  disqualifying  and
mitigating conditions as most pertinent:
AG ¶ 19(a) inability to satisfy debts;
AG ¶ 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;
AG  ¶  20(b)  the  conditions  that  resulted  in  the  financial  problem  were
largely beyond the person’s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business
downturn,  unexpected  medical  emergency,  a  death,  divorce,  or
separation,  clear  victimization  by  predatory  lending  practices,  or  identity
theft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and
AG ¶ 20(d)  the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to
repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.
5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).
6 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶ E3.1.14 and E3.1.15.
The  evidence  supports  a  conclusion  that  Applicant  has  a  history  of  financial
problems  that  is  sufficient  to  raise  a  security  concern  under  Guideline  F.  The
disqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case.
Turning to the matters  in  mitigation, Applicant’s financial problems are related to
the low income he earned  working as a  security guard while  at the same  time  paying for
education expenses. He  did not deliberately  shirk his financial responsibilities.  Once he
started  earning  a  higher  income,  he   was  able  to   pay  or   settle  the   seven  delinquent
accounts at issue  in  the SOR. Given the circumstances, the mitigating conditions at AG
¶ 20(b) and AG ¶ 20(d) apply in Applicant’s  favor.  The  security concern under Guideline
F is decided in Applicant’s favor.
The  gravamen  of  the  SOR  under  Guideline  B  for  foreign  influence  is  whether
Applicant’s  ties  to  Sudan  should  disqualify  him  from  access  to  classified  information.
Under  Guideline  B  for  foreign  influence,  the  suitability  of  an  applicant  may  be
questioned or put into doubt due to foreign contacts and interests. The overall concern
is set forth in AG ¶ 6 as follows:
Foreign  contacts  and   interests,  including   but  not  limited  to  business,
financial,  and   property  interests,  are  a   national  security  concern   if   they
result in  divided allegiance. They may also be a national  security concern
if they create circumstances in  which  the individual may be manipulated or
induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in  a
way  inconsistent  with  U.S.  interests  or   otherwise   made  vulnerable  to
pressure  or  coercion   by  any  foreign   interest.  Assessment  of   foreign
contacts  and   interests  should  consider  the  country  in   which  the  foreign
contact  or  interest  is  located,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  considerations
such as whether  it  is known to  target  U.S.   citizens  to  obtain classified or
sensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism.
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise a security concern under
AG ¶ 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:
AG  ¶  7(a)  contact,  regardless  of  method,  with  a  foreign  family  member,
business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen
of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk
of  foreign  exploitation,  inducement,  manipulation,  pressure,  or  coercion;
and
AG ¶ 7(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country
that  create  a  potential  conflict  of  interest  between  the  individual's
obligation  to  protect  classified  or  sensitive  information  or  technology  and
the  individual's  desire  to  help  a  foreign  person,  group,  or  country  by
providing that information or technology.
The starting point for the analysis is the country of Sudan. In light of the facts and
circumstances described in Department Counsel’s request for administrative notice, the
heightened-risk element is satisfied. Accordingly, given Applicant’s family ties to Sudan,
chiefly  his  spouse,  the  Government  has  established  its  case  under  Guideline  B.  The
above disqualifying conditions are raised by the evidence.
The guideline provides that certain facts and circumstances may mitigate foreign
influence  concerns.  Given  the  evidence  here,  I  considered  the  following  mitigating
conditions:
AG ¶ 8(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country
in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those
persons  in  that  country  are  such  that  it  is  unlikely  the  individual  will  be
placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign
individual,  group,  organization,  or  government  and  the  interests  of  the
United States; and
AG  ¶  8(b)  there  is  no  conflict  of  interest,  either  because  the  individual’s
sense  of  loyalty  or  obligation  to  the  foreign  person,  or  allegiance  to  the
group,  government,  or  country  is  so  minimal,  or  the  individual  has  such
deep  and  longstanding  relationships  and  loyalties  in  the  United  States,
that  the  individual  can  be  expected  to  resolve  any  conflict  of  interest  in
favor of the U.S. interest.
Sudan’s  relationship  with  the  United  States  and  the  heightened  risk  it  presents
place  a  heavy  burden  on  Applicant  to  mitigate  the  security  concern.  With  that  said,
Applicant  has  indicators  of  a  mature,  stable,  responsible,  and  trustworthy  person.  He
has  a  long  record  of  employment  in  the  United  States.  He  is  not  wealthy,  but  his
financial  interests  are  in  the  United  States.  He  traveled  at  his  own  expense  from  his
overseas duty location for the hearing in the case.  He was serious at the hearing. He
appears  to  have  cooperated  fully  and  provided  truthful  information  during  the  security
clearance process.
I  have  considered  the  totality  of  Applicant’s  family  ties  to  Sudan,  chiefly  his
spouse  who  he  supports  financially,  in  light  of  the  heightened  risk  presented  by  the
country of Sudan, and I remain concerned. The entirety of his family ties are to Sudan
while he has no family ties to the United States. At the same time there appear to be no
circumstances regarding Applicant personally that give rise to doubt about his suitability
for a security clearance, but that by itself does not carry sufficient weight.
Given the totality of facts and circumstances, I cannot conclude that it is unlikely
Applicant  will be placed in a position of  having to  choose between the  interests  of the
United States and the interests of the Sudanese government or his family members who
are  citizens  of  and  residents  in  Sudan.  Likewise,  I  cannot  conclude  that  there  is  no
conflict of interest. AG ¶ 8(a) and AG ¶ 8(b) are not fully applicable.
Following  Egan  and  the  clearly  consistent  standard,  I  have  doubts  or  concerns
about  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  good  judgment,  and  ability  to  protect
classified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighted the evidence
as  a  whole  and  considered  if  the  favorable  evidence  outweighed  the  unfavorable
evidence  or  vice  versa.  I  also  considered  the  whole-person  concept.  Accordingly,  I
conclude that he did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly
consistent  with  the  national  interest  to  grant  him  eligibility  for  access  to  classified
information.

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, she admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d
and 2.a-2.d. She denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 3.a.  Her admissions in her
answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 52-year-old linguist who has been offered employment by a defense
contractor, contingent on her ability to obtain a security clearance. She has never held a
security clearance.
Guideline B, Foreign Influence
Applicant  was  born  in  Baghdad,  Iraq  in  July  1968.  She  lived  in  Syria  from
September 2006 to December 2008. She was granted refugee status and came to the
United States in December 2008. (Tr. 24.) She became a U.S. citizen in January 2014.
Applicant attended college in Iraq for three years in business-related studies, but
she  did  not  receive  a  degree.  She  took  college  courses  in  the  United  States  from
September 2009 to August 2014 and received an associate’s degree in marketing. (Tr.
25, 67.)
Applicant married an Iraqi citizen in September 1991. Her husband is 67 years old,
a naturalized U.S. citizen, and a retired engineer. He is currently employed as a cashier
in a grocery store in the United States. (Tr. 26.)
Applicant’s   mother   and  father   are  citizens  and   residents  of   Iraq.   They  are   both
retired  high-school   teachers.  They  live  in   Kurdistan,  one   of  the  safer  places  in   Iraq.
Applicant has three children, ages 28, 25, and  22, all citizens and residents of the United
States. Her oldest daughter  is a pharmacy technician. Her  middle daughter is a property
manager for a  rental company. Her youngest daughter was  unemployed  at the time  of the
hearing but  had  been offered a job as an apartment  leasing agent. (Tr. 25-26.) Her 53-
year-old brother is a  citizen  and  resident of the United States. He  was employed by a U.S.
government agency engaged in clinical research and  held a public trust  position. He  now
does clinical research in  the United States for COVID-19 vaccines. (Tr. 28-29.) Her 40-
year-old sister is  a citizen and  resident of Iraq, employed by a U.S.-based company that
operates a private Christian school  in  Iraq. (GX  2 at  3.) Applicant  speaks with her parents
about  once  a  week  and   with  her  sister  about  once   every  two  months.   (Tr.   32.)   Her
relationships with her parents and sister are alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a-1.c.
When  Applicant  and  her  husband  were  living  in  Iraq,  Applicant  owned  and
operated a construction company and worked as a subcontractor for a U.S. contractor for
three years. (Tr. 34-35, 68.) She was responsible for marketing, and her husband was
responsible for supervising construction. She did not review the contracts with the U.S.
contractor because of language issues, and her part of the contracting process amounted
to a “couple emails.” (Tr. 69.) Her parents and siblings did not know that she was working
for a U.S. contractor. (Tr. 41-42.)
Applicant’s husband was kidnapped in 2006. She believed it was because of their
support  for  the  U.S.  forces.  (Tr.  38.)  The  U.S.  contractor  for  whom  Applicant
subcontracted paid a $50,000 ransom to secure his release. (AX D at 1.) After Applicant’s
husband was released, he and their daughters moved to Syria. At the end of 2006, after
her family had moved to Syria and while she was still in Iraq, she was traveling with a
driver  when  they  were  stopped  by  local  militia,  who  demanded  her  identification.  She
showed them only her Iraqi identification and hid her passport because it reflected a visa
for travel to the United States. She was pulled from the vehicle and was beaten because
of the way she was dressed. (Tr. 39-40.)
After coming to the United States, Applicant worked as a part-time interpreter from
June 2009 to August 2010. She was unemployed from September 2010 to September
2011. She worked in the private sector from September 2011 to May 2015. She and her
husband  started  a  business  in  February  2012,  working  from  their  home  in  the  United
States  to  act  as  an  intermediary  for  providing  for  goods  and  services  to  U.S.-based
companies in Iraq, Iraqi companies, and the Iraqi government. Her husband made all the
contacts and managed the finances. (Tr. 72-73.) Applicant’s husband had some contacts
with the Iraqi government, but he refused to share the information about his contacts with
Applicant. His refusal to share information with Applicant and their disagreements about
the scope of the business caused marital stress to the extent that she was contemplating
divorce when she underwent a personal subject interview (PSI) by a security investigator
in  April  2018.  (GX  2  at  4.)The  company  was  unsuccessful,  and  Applicant  sought
employment  elsewhere  in August  2014,  although the  company was  not  dissolved until
2016. (GX 1 at 25; GX 2 at 2-3; Tr. 45.)
Applicant  returned  to  Iraq  with  one  of  her  daughters  in  2015,  because  she  was
having discipline problems with her daughter and wanted to show her daughter how much
better  their  life  was  in  the  United  States.  Applicant  intended  to  live  in  Iraq  with  her
daughter for one year. (Tr. 77.) She worked as a marketing manager for a U.S. company
in Iraq from June to December 2015. She returned to the United States about six months
sooner than she planned when one of her other daughters was involved in a serious car
accident. (Tr. 76.) She was unemployed from January to May 2016. She has worked for
various employers in the private sector since May 2016. She had started working as a
sales associate for an automobile dealership when she had her PSI in April 2018, but her
employer asked her to resign when she applied for a job as a linguist. (Tr. 114-15.) For
the past two years, she has been employed part time as a concierge in several apartment
buildings.
In 2018, Applicant was asked for help by an Iraqi woman who was in the United
States on green card, worked in the Iraqi Embassy in the United States, was pregnant,
and whose husband was in Iraq. The record does not reflect that nature of the woman’s
work  in  the  Iraqi  Embassy.  Applicant  testified  that  when  they  met,  the  woman  was  a
student  at  a  local  university  and  was  not  working  in  the  embassy.  (Tr.  116.)  Applicant
testified  that  her  relationship  with  the  woman  was  not  a  “friendship,”  but  a  helping
relationship  because  the  woman  was  experiencing  emotional  and  physical  problems
related to her pregnancy. Their relationship ended at the end of 2018, and they had no
further contact. (Tr. 43-45.) Their relationship is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d.
Applicant last visited her family in Iraq in 2019 to attend a funeral for her aunt. At
that time, she complied with the Iraqi cultural requirement to obtain her parents’ approval
for her daughter’s marriage in the United States. (Tr. 42.)
Applicant’s  mother  owns  two  properties  in  Iraq  that  are  worth  about  $50,000.
Applicant and her brother have decided that they will give their share of their inheritance
to their sister in Iraq in recognition of the fact that their sister has been the sole caregiver
for  their  parents.  At  the  hearing,  Applicant  did  not  know  if  their  agreement  had  been
formalized in writing. (Tr. 32-33.) Applicant’s potential inheritance is alleged in SOR ¶ 1.e.
Iraq is a constitutional parliamentary republic. The 2018 parliamentary elections
generally met international standards for free and fair elections and led to the peaceful
transfer of power from Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to Adil Abd al-Mahdi. In December
2019, Prime Minister Abd al-Mahdi submitted his resignation in  response to protester’s
demand  for  changes  to  the  political  system,  and  the  Iraq  Council  of  Representatives
accepted his resignation. In May 2020, Iraq’s parliament confirmed Mustafa al-Kadhimi
as  prime  minister,  and  in  June  2020,  the  parliament  confirmed  his  cabinet  members,
ending the deadlock in government leadership. Prime Minister al-Kadhami declared that
his government would serve in a transitional capacity while preparing for elections in June
2021.
The United States is committed to building a strategic partnership with Iraq. Iraq is
a key partner for the United States in the region and a voice of moderation and democracy
in the Middle East. It has a functioning government and is playing a constructive role in
the  region.  The  United  States  maintains  vigorous  and  broad  engagement  with  Iraq  on
diplomatic,  political,  economic,  and  security  issues.  None  of  the  administrative  notice
documents  indicate  that  government  of  Iraq  targets  the  United  States  for  economic  or
military intelligence, although it is likely that various terrorist and insurgent groups seek
military intelligence regarding U.S. military units operating in Iraq.
Numerous terrorist and insurgent  groups are active in  Iraq, including ISIS and  anti-
U.S. sectarian militias. Rocket and  improvised  explosive  device (IED) attacks  against U.S.
and   Iraqi   facilities  and  convoys  are  common.  U.S.  citizens  in   Iraq   are  at  high  risk  for
violence  and  kidnapping.  Numerous  terrorist  and   insurgent  groups  are  active  and
regularly attack Iraqi security forces and  civilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias are directed
at  U.S.  citizens  and   Western  companies  throughout  Iraq.  Militia   groups  kidnap   local
residents,   foreign   workers,   and   members  of  international   organizations  and  demand
ransoms  from  their   families  or  their  employers.   The   U.S.  Department   of   State   travel
advisory  for   Iraq   is  Level   4  (“do  not   travel”),  due   to   terrorism,  kidnapping,  and   armed
conflict.
An  overwhelming  number  of  human-rights  abuses  were  committed  by  ISIS,
including attacks on civilians. However, human-rights abuses by Iraqi civilian authorities
and  other  state-sponsored  organizations  also  have  occurred.  They
included
disappearances; cruel and degrading treatment or punishment; hard and life-threatening
conditions  in  detention  and  prison  facilities;  insufficient  judicial  institutional  capacity;
ineffective  implementation  of  civil  judicial  procedures  and  remedies;  limitations  on
freedom of expression; social, religious, and political restrictions in academic and cultural
matters; and abuse of women and ethnic, religious and racial minorities.
The U.S. State Department has substantiated reports of human rights abuses in
Iraq, including a climate of violence; misappropriation of authority by sectarian, criminal,
and  insurgent  groups;  arbitrary  killings;  torture;  and  other  cruel,  inhuman  or  degrading
treatment or punishment. The Iraqi government’s effectiveness in adhering to the rule of
law is hampered by ongoing violence, corruption, sectarian bias, and lack of oversight
and  accountability.  Treatment  of  detainees  has  been  generally  poor.  The  judiciary  is
weak,  and  judicial  independence  is  impaired  by  threats  and  killings  by  insurgent,
sectarian,  tribal,  and  criminal  elements.  Security  threats  hinder  civilians’  access  to  the
courts, and witness intimidation is common.
In  January  2020,  the  U.S.  military  executed  a  drone  strike  that  killed  a  Iranian
general who  was in Iraq.  The Iraqi government condemned the strike as a violation of
Iraqi  sovereignty,  and  the  Iraqi  legislature  directed  the  Iraqi  government  to  remove  all
foreign forces from Iraq and end the use of Iraqi territory, waters, and airspace by foreign
military  forces.  In  response,  the  U.S.  Embassy  in  Iraq  urged  all  American  citizens  to
depart Iraq immediately.
Guideline F, Financial Considerations.
The SOR alleges four delinquent debts reflected in the credit reports from March
2018, April 2019, and October 2020 (GX 5, 6, and 7.) During the PSI in April 2018, she
told  an  investigator  that  she  had  been  unable  to  resolve  the  debts  while  she  was
unemployed, but she had just begun working as a sales associate for a car dealer and
intended to pay them. (GX 2 at 6.) She lost her job shortly after the interview, when her
employer learned that she had applied for a job as a linguist.
Applicant testified that she has about $250 in her bank account, but no retirement
account,  savings, or investments.  She does  not own a car,  but her husband  owns a 15-
year-old compact car.  (Tr. 80.) Her daughters help her financially.  (Tr. 59) Her husband
refuses to assist with paying the family bills.  Applicant  testified that her husband  told her
that he had  taken care  of the family for  25 years and  now  it was her turn to  take care of
everything. (Tr.  119.)  Applicant tried using  a  debt-resolution company to assist her, but
she terminated the contract after  three months because  the company made no progress.
(Tr. 119-20.)
The evidence concerning the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR is summarized
below:
SOR ¶ 2.a:  retail-store charge account charged off for $5,615.  This account
was  charged  off  in  May  2016.  (GX  5  at  2.)  Applicant  testified  that  she  contacted  this
creditor in December 2020, but the creditor insisted on full payment and would not make
a payment agreement. (Tr. 96.) She decided to make minimum payments until she could
make  a  payment  agreement  or  pay  the  amount  due  in  full.  (Tr.  96.)  She  made  $15
payments on December 7, 2020, and January 4, 2021. (AX C.)
SOR  ¶  2.b:   credit-card  account  charged  off  for  $3,000.  This  account  was
charged  off  in  January  2016.  (GX  6  at  2.)  In  November  or  December  2020,  Applicant
made  a  payment  agreement  providing  for  payments  of  $375,  and  she  made  her  final
payment in January 2021. (AX A.) This debt is resolved.
SOR  ¶  2.c:   department-store  charge  account  charged  off  for  $2,508.  This
account  was  charged  off  in  January  2016.  (GX  5  at  3.)  Applicant  testified  that  she
contacted this creditor  in December  2020,  but  the  creditor  would  not  make a payment
agreement. (Tr. 96.)  She decided to make minimum payments until she could make a
payment agreement or pay the amount due in full. (Tr. 96.) She made $15 payments in
December 2020 and January 2021. (AX C; AX E.)
SOR  ¶  2.d:   credit-card  account  charged  off  for  $2,100.  This  account  was
charged off in February 2016. (GX 6 at 2.) She made a $50 payment in December 2020.
(AX  C.)  In  January  2021,  she  made  an  agreement  providing  for  monthly  payments  of
$137. (AX B; Tr. 98-99.) She made the required $137 payment in February 2021. (AX F;
AX G.)
Applicant told an investigator during the April 2018 PSI that she believed that the
four  debts  alleged  in  the  SOR  were  cancelled.  She  realized  her  debts  had  not  been
cancelled after she was questioned about them during the PSI. She told the investigator
that  she  was  unemployed  and  unable  to  make  any  payments  on  them,  but  that  she
intended  to  start  making  payments  when  she  started  receiving  the  commissions  she
earned from selling cars. She was unable to keep that promise because the automobile
dealer terminated her when he learned that she had applied for a job as a linguist.
Guideline E, Personal Conduct
The SOR alleges that Applicant deliberately falsified her SCA by answering “No”
to the questions about financial delinquencies and failing to disclose the debts alleged in
the SOR. The investigator’s summary of the April 2018 PSI includes the statement, “She
was not sure why she did not list this required information.” (GX 2 at 6.) At the hearing,
she testified that at the time of the PSI, she was not sure if she still had delinquent debts.
(Tr. 63.) In her answer to the SOR, she stated that she thought “charged off” meant that
the debt was cancelled.
Character Evidence
A retired federal employee, who is working as a full-time volunteer for a charitable
organization for Iraqi orphans, met Applicant in 2016 and considers her creative, reliable,
loyal, and trustworthy. (AX D at 2.)
Applicant’s  25-year-old  daughter  remembers  vividly  how  strong  her  mother  was
when their father was kidnapped and how her mother became the family provider when
their father had difficulty finding employment in the United States. She admires her mother
for her courage and commitment. (AX D at 3.)
Applicant’s 28-year-old daughter describes Applicant as a role model and “a great
example of the American dream.” She admires Applicant for many reasons, “but mainly
for  her  ability  to  continue  pushing  forward  through  every  obstacle  she  faces.”  She
considers Applicant “a positive and ambitious individual who only knows love and loyalty
for this country.” (AX I.)
A tenant who has observed Applicant working as a “concierge” for their apartment
complex admires her for her trustworthiness, hard work, attention to detail, and proactive
approach to her job. (AX D at 4.)
Applicant’s  sister  describes  Applicant  as  the  family  protector  who  has  an
“appreciation for the American democracy and way of life” and who wants her children to
“have a life where liberty and freedom is a right—not a privilege.” She considers Applicant
to be “a determined woman who has found her home and comfort in the United States.”
(AX H.)

"Applicant is a 47-year-old male of Lebanese descent and citizenship. He entered
the  United  States  on  a  business  visa  in  February  1999.  Applicant  is  divorced  with  no
children. In 2002, he left the United States to work as a linguist in support of U.S. forces
in  Iraq.  He  returned  to  the  United  States  in  2005,  and  left  again  in  March  2005  until
September 2010 to again work as a linguist in Iraq for the U.S. military. (Items 4, 5) In
2010, Applicant left Iraq without authorization to go to Lebanon to visit his mother who

expects his annual  income as a linguist to increase from $74,000 to $86,000. (Tr. 23)
Personal Conduct and Financial Considerations
SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 2.a allege that in March 2015, Applicant submitted an application
for food stamps in which he falsely indicated he had less than $100 in cash or in the bank.
He  traveled  to  the  Middle  East  three  times:  (1)  in  May  2015;  (2)  from  November  to
December 2015; and (3) from January to February 2016.
Applicant   admitted  that  he  completed  a  food  stamp  application   in  March  2015,
which   asked   the  following  financial  and   employment-related  questions:  (1)   “Will  your
household income be more than $150 this month?”;  (2) “Do you have  more than $100 in
cash or in  the bank?”;  (3)  “Is your income and ready cash this month more than your rent
and   utilities?”; (4)  “What will   be your total   income this month?”;  (5) “How   much do you
have  in  cash  or  the  bank?”;  (6) “What did you pay for housing (rent/utilities) this month?”;
(7) “In the past two (2) months, did anyone stop working or cut back on their hours?”; (8)
“Are you or  anyone in  your house working?”; and  (9) “Did  anyone sell, trade, or give away
anything worth  more than $1,000 during the last three (3) years?”. (GE  5 at 2-4) Applicant
responded “no” to questions (1), (2),  (3), (7), (8), and  (9). He  responded “0”  to questions
(4) and (5) and “$150” to question (6). (Tr. 56, 62; GE 5 at 2-4)
Applicant’s food stamp application also asked: “Does anyone own a car, truck or
van? If yes, list Make, Model and Year below.” (GE 5 at 4) Applicant answered “no.” (Id.)
He purchased a car in 2011 for about $25,000. (Tr. 46-47, 94-95) He owned this vehicle
from 2011 to June 2016, and he used it for part-time taxi services. (Tr. 47)
In 2014, Applicant and a friend went to Europe and purchased two trucks, which
they sold in 2014 in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). (Tr. 64-66, 75-76) Applicant said he
did not recall how much he contributed toward the purchase of the trucks, and he did not
remember the sales prices. (Tr. 66-67) He could not remember whether they were sold
for more or less than $1,000. (Tr. 67, 77)
Applicant said in March 2015, he was told by his “representative” or government
caseworker that he was entitled to food stamps and Medicaid because he “did not have
a job at  the time.” (HE 3 at  2) He “inadvertently overlooked the question regarding  the
amount of money [he] currently had. [He] did not intend to lie or commit fraud. . . . This
incident was a simple mistake.” (Id.) At his hearing, he said “It’s a mistake because I didn't
know the question was like as in my -- like right as of now I had in my pocket a hundred
dollars or not. So that's kind of confuse at that time. . . . I didn't know because maybe I
was in a rush to just fill that form or I didn’t understand what it was in there.” (Tr. 21-22,
56-57)  He  said  “I  don't  remember  but  maybe  could  be  a  language  barrier,  maybe.  I
understand at that time what was written in there.” (Tr. 59) He said he could not remember
what he was thinking at the time he completed the document in March 2015. (Tr. 60)
Applicant disclosed on his food stamp application that his mortgage payment was
$867 and his taxes were $110; however, he wrote that his mortgage was in “default.” (GE
5 at 5) He was unsure when his mortgage was in default. (Tr. 104-105) He indicated on
the food stamp application that he usually speaks English, and he wants services to be
provided in English. (GE 5 at 8) He disclosed his employment as a linguist from 2007 to
2010 on his food stamp application; however, he did not disclose any employment from
2011 to 2015. (Id. at 12)

Iraq. (Tr. 43-44) He said he could not remember how much money he had in his savings
account when he left his linguist employment in 2010. (Tr. 44) He could not remember
whether  it  was  more  than  $100,000,  between  $100,000  and  $50,000,  or  less  than
$50,000. (Tr. 45-46) From 2012 to 2016, he worked on call as a medical translator and
earned $25 an hour. (Tr. 48-50; AE D) He could not remember how much he worked as
a medical translator. (Tr. 51) He was unsure if he put the income from being a medical
translator on his income tax return. (Tr. 51) From May 2012 to January 2015, Applicant
worked for a part-time taxi service. (Tr. 52) He did not remember how much he worked or
how much he earned in his part-time taxi service employment. (Tr. 52-53)
As to the trips to the Middle East, he said he visited his sister who was ill, and she
died in 2019, and his son who was in the UAE. (Tr. 22; HE 3 at 2) He paid for the trips
using  a  credit  card.  (Tr.  73;  HE  3  at  2)  He  said  he  did  not  remember  whether  he  had
money in the bank when he traveled overseas from November 2014 to January 2015. (Tr.
74)
From  2009  to  April  9,  2017,  Applicant  traveled  outside  the  United  States  to  50
foreign countries mostly in the Middle East. (GE 1 at 35-101) The overseas trips from May
2014 to February 2016 are as follows. From May to June 2014, Applicant traveled to the
UAE for 21 to 30 days. (Id. at 68) From August to September 2014, he traveled to the
UAE for 21 to 30 days. (Id. at 69) In November 2014, he traveled to the UAE for one to
five days. (Id. at 71) From November to December 2014, he traveled to Sudan for more

for one to five days. (Id. at 78) From December 2015 to January 2016, he traveled to the
UAE for one to five days. (Id. at 80) From January to February 2016, he traveled to Saudi
Arabia for one to five days. (Id. at 81) In February 2016, he traveled to the UAE for one
to five days. (Id. at 82)
From  August  2014  to  November  2016,  Applicant  received  from  $189  to  $194
monthly  from  the  food  stamp  program.  (Tr.  69-70;  GE  6  at  4-5)  He  did  not  remember
whether  the  payments  continued  after  November  2016.  (Tr.  70)  He  did  not  remember
telling  the  government  to  stop  making  the  payments.  (Tr.  70-71)  The  food  stamp
application indicates Applicant will need to “recertify” for benefits. (GE 5 at 2) There is no
evidence  that  Applicant  submitted a mid-certification or recertification for benefits.  See
Department  of  Human  Services  website,  https://dhs.dc.gov/service/recertification-
benefits.
Applicant’s  May  8,  2021 personal  financial  statement  indicates his total monthly
income is $4,200, and his net monthly remainder is $1,500. (AE A) His primary debts are
his mortgage ($165,000), two credit cards ($4,800 and $4,500), and a personal loan from
a bank ($20,000). (Id.)
At  most  Applicant  admitted  that  he  made  a  mistake  when  he  answered  the
question in the food stamp application when he said he did not have $100 in cash or in
his  bank  account.  He  did  not  admit  that  he  had  $100  or  more  in  cash  or  in  his  bank
account. There is no admissible evidence about how much Applicant had in cash or in his
bank account when he completed his food stamp application. The SOR did not allege,
and there was no evidence that Applicant has any currently delinquent accounts or debts.
Foreign Influence
SOR ¶¶ 3.a, 3.b, and 3.c allege Applicant’s four brothers, two sisters, and son are
citizens  and  residents  of  Sudan.  Applicant’s  son  was  born  in  1995  in  Sudan,  and  he
continues  to  reside  in  Sudan.  (GE  1  at  23)  On  April  9,  2017,  Applicant  said  he
communicated with his son on a monthly basis; however, his most recent communication
was in February 2015. (GE 1 at 24) On May 7, 2017, he indicated he contacted his son
10 times a year. (GE 3 at 2) At his hearing, Applicant said he does not have any contact
or relationship with his son, who is now 26 years old. (Tr. 15, 26-27) The last time he met
with his son was in 2015 when Applicant went to the UAE. (Tr. 87)

with two of his brothers 12 times  a year. (GE  3 at  1)  For the other two brothers,  he did not
indicate frequency of contact.  (Id. at 2) At his hearing, he  said  he talked to one  brother
about a year ago  but not to the others.  (Tr. 26) He  said he does not communicate with
them because: “Just due  [to] my job, you know, concerns I don't  talk to them anymore.
And I'm kind of busy and they're busy too. So then I told them now I have a different job
requirement to stay away so I don't want to get in talk to them.” (Tr. 25) He talked to one
brother possibly in 2016, because he needed help arranging his divorce. (Tr. 79, 81-82)
In  Applicant’s  April  9,  2017  SCA,   Applicant   said   he  communicated  with  his  two
sisters  quarterly with his most  recent communications  in December 2014.  (GE 1 at 30-

and  (6)  for three weeks in  2019. (Tr.  37-38;  GE 1 at 42-43, 47-48,  55-56, 72-73, and  90-
91)
SOR  ¶¶  3.d,  3.e,  and  3.f  allege:  he  provided  about  $7,000  yearly  from  2009  to

marriage to his employer. (AE S) He said he renounced his Sudan citizenship; however,
he  was  unsure  about  how  he  renounced  his  citizenship.  (Tr.  97-98)  Sudan  does  not
recognize dual citizenship, and Applicant’s Sudan citizenship may have been involuntarily

Sudan
On April 11, 2019, following months of protests, civil unrest, and a national state
of  emergency,  the  Sudanese  army  announced  the  overthrow  of  the  government  of
President Omar Hassan al Bashir and the establishment of a transitional military council.
Previous  to  this,  Sudan  was  a  republic  with  power  concentrated  in  the  hands  of
authoritarian President al-Bashir and the National Congress Party, which had maintained
nearly absolute political authority in Sudan for three decades.
The transition to a new government was not entirely peaceful. On June 3, 2019,
security forces violently dispersed protesters at a sit-in, killing and injuring hundreds. On
June 5, 2019, the U.S. Department of State released the following: ""The United States
condemns the recent attacks on protesters in Sudan . . . We call on Sudan's Transitional
Military  Council  and  the  Rapid  Support  Forces  to  desist  from  violence  and  we  call  for
resumed contact with the Forces for Freedom and Change with the aim of a civilian-led
transition that leads to timely elections and free expression of the will of the Sudanese
people.” U.S. Dept. of State, Press Statement: Situation in Sudan (June 5, 2019).
On June 6, 2019, the U.S. Embassy cited violence and civil unrest continuing in
Khartoum  and  in  cities  across  Sudan,  resulting  in  local  travel  by  U.S.  government
personnel being limited to minimal, officially approved movements only.
In September 2019, Sudan officially formed the civilian-led transitional government
(CLTG). The CLTG is composed of a Sovereign Council, a Council of Ministers headed
by  the  prime  minister,  and  a  Legislative  Council.  The  11-person  Sovereign  Council  is
composed of six civilians and five military officers. On August 20, Dr. Abdalla Hamdok
was sworn in as prime minister. Under the constitutional declaration, general elections
are to be held in 2022. The country last held national elections (presidential and National
Assembly)  in  2015.  Since  the  formation  of  the  CLTG,  large-scale  protests  have  died
down. Smaller, localized protests have continued with a focus on injustices committed by
the Bashir regime and violence that took place during the protest period leading to the
creation of the CLTG. Most of the protests have been nonviolent, but they often led to
road closures by security  forces and the  protesters.  At  times, the  security  forces  have
used tear gas to disperse protestors.
Since 1993, the U.S. Secretary of State has designated Sudan as a State Sponsor
of  Terrorism  for  supporting  international  terrorist  groups,  including  the  Abu  Nidal
Organization, Palestine Islamic Jihad, Hamas, and Hizballah. The CLTG asserted it does
not support terrorist organizations that were tolerated under the Bashir regime. The CLTG
has  taken  steps  to  limit  the  activities  of  these  terrorism  organizations  and  worked  to
disrupt  foreign  fighters’  use  of  the  country  as  a  logistics  base  and  transit  point.  The
Department of State assesses Khartoum as being a HIGH-threat location for terrorism
directed at or affecting official U.S. government interests. Elements of ISIS, al-Qa’ida, and
many other terrorist organizations recruit in Sudan. As of August 2020, the Department
of State's travel advisory for Sudan was Level 3: Reconsider travel to Sudan due to crime,
terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, and armed conflict.
Terrorist  groups  are  still  active  in  Sudan  and  have  stated  their  intent  to  harm
Westerners and Western interests through suicide operations, bombings, shootings, and
kidnappings.
Despite  the  absence  of  high-profile  terrorist  attacks,  ISIS  facilitation  networks
appear to be active within Sudan. The newly appointed Minister of Religious Affairs and
Endowments under the CLTG denied the existence of an official ISIS entity in Sudan but
acknowledged that there were “extremists” linked to ISIS in the country. The Minister of
Religious  Affairs  and  Endowments  also  emphasized  that  his  ministry  would  work  on
combating  extremism,  fighting  terrorism  and  renewing  school  curricula  to  promote
tolerance.
In 2003, non-Arabs in the western region of Darfur, who since 1990 have accused
the government of systematic discrimination, marginalization, and oppression, rebelled
against  the  government,  protesting  decades  of  political  and  economic  neglect.  The
government  responded  with  brutal  force,  including  the  use  of  Arab  militias  known  as
Janjaweed. In the ensuing conflict, more than 300,000 people were killed. To date, the
conflict  in  Darfur  has  affected  4.7  million  people,  including  more  than  1.76  million
internally displaced persons (IDPs) in need of humanitarian assistance. The United States
characterized  the  government  and  affiliated  militia  attacks  on  civilians  in  2004  as
genocide.
In mid-2011, following South Sudan's independence, conflict broke out between
the  government  and  the  Sudan  People's  Liberation  Movement-North  in  Southern
Kordofan and Blue Nile states. The conflict has severely affected or displaced more than
1.1 million people within  the two  areas and  caused  more than 300,000 people  to flee to
neighboring  countries.  The   government   of   Sudan   announced  in   January  2019  that  it
would continue  indefinitely its unilateral cease fire,  in  effect since 2016, with armed rebels
throughout  the  Blue  Nile  region   and   Southern  Kordofan   region.   The   Sudan  People's
Liberation  Movement-North  has  also  maintained   its  unilateral   cessation  of  hostilities
without a commensurate announcement.
Significant human rights issues under the Bashir government included: unlawful or
arbitrary killings; forced disappearances; torture; and arbitrary detentions, all by security
forces;  harsh  and  life-threatening  prison  conditions;  political  prisoners;  arrests  and
intimidation  of  journalists,  censorships,  newspaper  seizures,  and  site  blockings;
substantial interference with the rights of peaceful assembly and freedom of association,
such  as  overly  restrictive  nongovernmental  organization  (NGO)  laws;  restrictions  on
religious  liberty;  restrictions  on  political  participation;  widespread  corruption;  lack  of
accountability in cases involving violence against women; trafficking in persons; outlawing
of  independent  trade  unions;  and  child  labor.  Respect  for  human  rights,  in  particular
fundamental freedoms of expression, assembly, and religion, greatly improved after the
CLTG took power.
Bashir  government  authorities  did  not  investigate  human  rights  violations  by  its
security services or any other branch of the security services. However, the CLTG has
launched a human rights investigation into the June 3, 2019 security force violations. In
addition, the attorney general and security forces had agreed on a temporary process to
remove  immunity  from  security  forces  and  government  institutions  involved  in  human
rights violations.

"In Applicant’s SOR response, he denied all of the SOR allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a
through 1.d and ¶ 2.e. (HE 3) He admitted SOR ¶¶ 2.a through 2.d, ¶ 2.f, and ¶ 3.a. (Id.)
He also provided mitigating information. (Id.)
Applicant is a 44-year-old  Iraqi  and United States dual citizen who seeks a security
clearance to enable him  to regain employment as  a  linguist.  (Tr. 7) In 1995,  he graduated
from  high school  in  Iraq, and  in  1998, he graduated from a technical institute in  Iraq.  (Tr.
7) From 2005 to 2008, he served as a linguist with U.S. armed forces in Iraq. From 2009
to 2010, Applicant  worked as a  part-time role player for the U.S. Army  in  the United States.
(November 7,  2017, Office of  Personnel  Management (OPM)  report of  investigation (ROI)
at 6)  In 2010, he married, and  in  2013, he  divorced. (Tr. 7-8)  His son is  a nine-year-old
citizen  of Iraq  who resides in  Jordan. (Tr. 8)  In 2013, Applicant  became a U.S. citizen,
and in 2014, he received a U.S. passport. (SCA)
Financial Considerations
From 2011 to 2014, Applicant repaired six used cars damaged in accidents and
then he sent them to Iraq where they were sold. (Tr. 85-87, 92) He received $11,500 for
one car and $18,000 for another of the cars. (OPM ROI at 11) After paying expenses, he
said he did not make a profit on the sale of the vehicles. (AE B) Some of the cars were
used for a time by his relatives living in Iraq. (Tr. 83-84) He may have given one of the
cars to his father, and then his father received the proceeds from the sale of this car. (Tr.
85-87) He did not declare any income from the sale of the cars on his federal or state tax
returns. (Tr. 85-86) There was no evidence presented that contradicted his statement that
he received no income or profit after paying expenses from the sale of the six cars.
In 2012 or 2013, Applicant sold a house in the United States for about $260,000,
and he made a profit of around $100,000. (Tr. 80-82; OPM ROI at 11) In July 2017, he
loaned $90,000 to an uncle who lived in the United States to pay off his uncle’s house.
(Tr. 62; OPM ROI at 11) As of November 2017, his uncle had repaid $37,000; however,
the remainder was not repaid. (Id.; AE C at 1)
According  to  the  Internal  Revenue  Service  (IRS),  the  gain  on  the  sale  of  a
residence of up to $250,000 is excluded from income for federal income tax purposes if
“owned and used [by the taxpayer as his or her] main home for a period aggregating at
least two years out of the five years prior to its date of sale.” Internal Revenue Service
website,  Topic  No.  701  Sale  of  Your  Home,  available  at  https://www.irs.gov/
taxtopics/tc701.  An  information  return  is  not  required  unless  the  seller  receives  an
“income-reporting  document  such  as  Form  1099-S,  Proceeds  From  Real  Estate
Transactions,” or has a non-excludable gain. (Id.) Applicant used the profits from the sale
of his residence for living expenses when he was unemployed or underemployed, and to
purchase or repair the six cars that he hoped to sell for a profit in Iraq. (Tr. 83-87) The
SOR did not allege that Applicant failed to disclose income on his tax returns. Applicant
did not disclose the profit on the sale of his residence on his tax returns, and he was not
asked to indicate how he qualified for the IRS homeowner’s exclusion. It was clear from
his overall testimony that he had very limited knowledge of IRS rules on exclusions from
income and inclusions to income.
The SOR alleges in ¶¶ 1.a through 1.d that Applicant failed to timely file federal
and state tax income returns for tax years 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2016. On
November  7,  2017,  Applicant  told an OPM  investigator  that  he did  not  file federal and
state tax returns for tax years 2015 and 2016 because he did not make enough money to
file. (OPM ROI at 10) The OPM ROI does not indicate how much income Applicant made
in 2015 and 2016. (Id.)
When Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories, he left the lines blank in the
table for listing the filing dates for his state and federal income tax returns for tax years
2010, 2011, and 2012. (GE 2 at 2) He  indicated that he  filed his federal and state tax
returns as follows: for tax year 2013 on April 14, 2014; for tax year 2014 on April 13, 2016
(one year late); for tax year 2015 and 2016, he said he did not make enough income to
necessitate filing a tax return; for tax year 2017, he filed on March 3, 2018; and for tax
year 2018 he filed on March 13, 2018. (GE 2 at 2-4) He did not indicate his income that
he presumably reported on his state and federal income tax returns for tax year 2014.
Applicant  provided  some  IRS  tax  transcripts.  His  IRS  tax  transcripts  issued  in
March 2021 indicate: (1) His tax transcripts were unavailable for tax years 2010 through
2014; (2) For tax year 2015, his income was $0, and no federal income tax return was
filed; and (3) For tax year 2016, his income was $11. (AE B)
Applicant said his federal and state tax returns for tax year 2010 were filed in March
or April 2011. (Tr. 68-69) For tax year 2010, his Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) was $5,799;
his filing status was married filing jointly; and he received a $1,601 refund. (SOR response
at 38) His state tax return indicated he was supposed to receive an $830 refund. (Id. at
40-41) The copies of his state and federal income tax returns that he provided are not
signed or dated. (Id. at 38-46)
Applicant said his federal and state tax returns for tax year 2011 were timely filed.
(Tr.  70-72)  For  tax  year  2011,  his  AGI  was  $11,152;  his  status  was  married  filing
separately or single; and he owed $1,479 when he filed his tax return. (SOR response at
47-48) He said he paid the IRS with a check. (Tr. 69-72) His reported income from an
auto  body  business  was  on  an  IRS  Form  1099-MISC.  (SOR  response  at  49-53)  He
received an $811 refund from the state tax authority. (Id. at 63) The copies of his state
and federal tax returns that he provided are not signed or dated. (Id. at 47-63)
For tax  year 2012, his AGI was $12,268; his status was  married filing separately
or single; and  he owed $1,742  when he filed his tax  return. (SOR response at 68-69) He
owed the state tax  authority $401  when he filed his state tax  return. (Id. at 78-79) The
copes of his state and federal tax returns he provided  are not signed or dated. (Id. at 68-
83)  His federal income tax  return was electronically accepted by the IRS on February 4,
2013. (Id. at 66) He paid his federal taxes when due. (Tr. 70-73)
For tax year 2013, Applicant’s IRS federal income tax account transcript indicated
his AGI was $29,831; his status was single; and he owed $4,206 when he filed his tax
return. (GE 2 at 7) He paid the $4,206 federal income tax debt when he filed his tax return.
(Id.) The IRS received his payment on April 19, 2014. (Id.)
In  November  2013,  Applicant  was  in  a  serious  vehicle  accident.  (Tr.  74-78)  His
shoulder was injured, and he was unable to work or was underemployed from 2014 to
June 2016. (Tr. 76; SOR response at 4-36; OPM ROI at 5) His employment in auto sales
for several years was limited because of lack of business. (Tr. 78)
In 2015 and 2016, the IRS income thresholds for the requirement to file a federal
income  tax  return  for  a  single  person  under  age  65  were  $10,300  and  $10,350,
respectively.  See  IRS  Publication  501,  Exemptions,  Standard  Deduction,  and  Filing
Information  For  use  in  preparing  2015  and  2016  Returns,  tbl.  1,  pg.  2,  available  at
https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/p501--2015.pdf  and  https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/
p501--2016.pdf. In 2015 and 2016, the Applicant’s income thresholds for the requirement
to file a state tax return for a single person under age 65 was $4,000 for both years. See
2015 and 2016 Individual Income Tax Forms and Instructions, MI-1040, at 3, available at
https://www.michigan.gov/documents/taxes/1040  Book  with  forms  508951  7.pdf  and
https://www.michigan.gov/documents/taxes/MI-1040  Instruction  Book  - Instruction
Only 545985  7.pdf.
For tax year 2017, Applicant’s IRS federal income tax account transcript indicated
his AGI was $2,206; his status was single; and he received a $5 refund after receiving a
$170 earned income credit. (GE 2 at 9)  For tax year 2018, Applicant’s IRS federal income
tax  account  transcript  indicated  his  AGI  was  $11,369;  his  status  was  single;  and  he
received a $265 refund after receiving a $201 earned income credit. (Id. at 11)
On  July  9,  2019,  the  state  tax  authority  wrote  that  Applicant  filed  his  state  tax
returns for tax years 2009-2013 and 2017-2018, and there were no outstanding liabilities.
(GE 2 at 13) The state did not indicate when the state tax returns were filed.
In sum, Applicant admitted that he failed to timely file his federal and state income
tax returns for tax year 2014. He filed these two tax returns on April 13, 2016 (one year
late). Applicant denied that he had sufficient income in tax years 2015 and 2016 to require
him to file state or federal income tax returns, and there was no evidence to contradict his
statement.
Personal Conduct
SOR ¶ 3.a alleges that Applicant’s August 2, 2017 SCA, in Section 26, “Financial
Record – Taxes, asks “In the past seven (7) years have you failed to file or pay Federal,
state, or other taxes when required by law or ordnance?”  Applicant answered “no”  and
allegedly did not report his failure to timely file federal and state tax returns in tax years
2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, and/or 2016.
Applicant explained why he indicated “no” as follows:
I made a mistake actually back then because I thought -- I know, every year,
like, I’m doing my taxes. That’s what I know. Like, I’m doing it. Every year I
go and file my taxes and do all the proper paperwork and pay the check and
pay how much I owe. I get refund. That’s all I know about. In 2015 and 2016,
just before the economy was, like, not good here in, like, [Applicant’s state
of  residency].  And  the  business  is  not  really  helped.  So  plus  I  was
unemployed, like, most of the time from here to there. I don’t know why I
said no because I thought that I’m paying my taxes and then I . . . I don’t
know how to do it basically to be honest. I went to the IRS. And I requested
the 2010, and I requested the taxes. But actually, they didn’t give me or they
didn’t put me in a situation to pay it. Like, I’m willing to pay it if I can pay it
right now if I owe any money. I’m not trying to hide anything. I thought this
is the honest answer. I spoke my heart at that second when I answered the
question. [Tr. 88-89]
Applicant indicated he did not think he had to file a tax return because of his lack of income
in  2015  and  2016.  (Tr.  87-89)  In  regard  to  preparation  of  tax  returns,  he  went  to  a
professional tax preparer, and he filed whatever he believed he was supposed to file. (Tr.
87-89) Applicant indicated he did the best he could to answer the question about filing tax
returns honestly and in good faith. (Tr. 95)
Foreign Influence
The SOR alleges that Applicant had the following connections to Iraq and Jordan:
in SOR ¶ 2.a, his son is a citizen of Iraq and a resident of Jordan; in SOR ¶¶ 2.b and 2.c,
his brother and five sisters are citizens and residents of Iraq; in SOR ¶ 2.d, he has 14
foreign  contacts  or  connections  to  persons  who  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Iraq;  in
¶  2.e,  as  of  September  2017,  he  provided  about  $10,500  in  financial  support  to  his
relatives in Iraq; and in SOR ¶ 2.f, he provides $1,800 annually in financial support to his
sister in Iraq.
Applicant was born in Iraq. (Tr. 23) He was educated through the technical school
level  in  Iraq.  He  was  in  Iraq  from  September  2015  to  April  2016  to  assist  his  mother
because she was ill, and she required two serious surgeries. (Tr. 63-65) He also went to
Iraq to initiate the documents to enable his parents to leave Iraq to go to the United States.
(Tr. 63-65) In February of 2017, he was in Iraq for about two weeks to bring his parents
to the United States. (Tr. 63-64) He has not returned to Iraq since 2017. (Tr. 64) He does
not intend to return to Iraq unless it is for employment as a linguist or to bring his siblings
to the United States. (Tr. 66) He wants to bring all of his siblings to the United States. (Tr.
66)
Applicant has five sisters and  one brother who are citizens and  residents of Iraq.
(Tr. 24) He  has monthly contact with his brother. (Tr. 35) In  2016  or  2017, he sent $1,800
to his sister,  and  she sent his brother $600  out of the $1,800. (Tr. 37, 43-44; OPM ROI at
7) From  2007 to 2009,  Applicant’s brother worked for the United States as a  gate guard
and  linguist  in  Iraq. (Tr. 38-41)  Applicant  has monthly contact with his five sisters and  four
out of five of his brothers-in-law. (Tr. 45, 50-53) He  ended his contacts with his father-in-
law when he got divorced. (Tr. 53-54) His contacts with three aunts and two cousins has
been reduced to annually or less  frequently than annually. (Tr. 53-55)  He  has monthly
contact  with  one   friend  and   quarterly  contact  with  another  friend  who  are   citizens   and
residents  of Iraq.  (Tr. 59, 61) He  has reduced or ended  his contacts for  about two years
or more with  several friends who are citizens and  residents of Iraq.  (Tr. 59-60) The  Iraqi
government does not  employ any of  his siblings. (Tr. 35) There is  no evidence  the Iraqi
government employs any of his contacts in Iraq.
Applicant’s son lives in Jordan with his mother. (Tr. 45-46) She filed for divorce in
Jordan in 2014. (Tr. 48) When Applicant went to Jordan in 2011 to visit his wife and son,
he was delayed in Jordan until he paid a child support settlement of about $1,500. (Tr.
48-50; OPM ROI at 7, 9) Under Jordanian law, he is not required to pay any more child
support. (Tr. 50) He communicates with his son every three to four months. (Tr. 50) He is
estranged from his former spouse, and he has not spoken to her since 2012. (Tr. 48-50;
OPM ROI at 7)
Applicant had a friend in Iraq with a car dealership. (Tr. 57) Applicant ended his
business  relationship  with  him  in  2017.  (Tr.  57)  Applicant  sent  him  a  one-time  wire
transaction for $18,000 in connection with the car business. (Tr. 57)
On  March 1,  2017,  Applicant   sponsored  his  parents   to   obtain  a  U.S.  Visa;   they
moved from Iraq to the United States;  and  now  they live with him.  (Tr. 35; OPM ROI at 7)
Applicant  plans  to  help  his  parents  apply  for  naturalization  to  become  U.S.  citizens  in
December 2021. (Tr. 20) His parents know that he has applied to be a linguist; however,
they do not know  anything else  about his employment plans. (OPM ROI at  6) Applicant
has not disclosed to family living  in  Iraq that he is seeking a security clearance. (Tr. 62-
63)  He   acknowledged   that  if  Iranian  elements  in   Iraq  learn  of  his   support   for   the  U.S.
Government, his  family living in  Iraq  is at  risk of  being harmed. (Tr. 62-63)  He offered  to
renounce  his Iraqi  citizenship; however,  he has never been asked to renounce  it. (OPM
ROI at 4)
In 2005, the U.S. Army recruited Applicant as a linguist. (Tr. 24-26) First he worked
at  a  gate  helping  to  screen  persons  seeking  access  to  the  base;  then  he worked  with
education and training of personnel involved in counterterrorism; and then from January
2007 to August 2008, he worked with U.S. Army Special Forces. (26-30) In August 2008,
he immigrated to the United States. (Tr. 31)
In  Iraq,  Applicant’s  mission  from  January  2007  to  August  2008  was  to  help  to
collect information from intelligence sources and then accompany the military to arrest
criminals and terrorists. (Tr. 32) Applicant was in danger on missions up to three times a
week.  (Tr.  32)  He  was  close  to  the  detonation  of  three  improvised  explosive  devices
(IEDs) and one vehicle borne IED. (Tr. 33-34) His injuries during these incidents were
minor,  and  he  was  able  to  resume  his  linguist  duties  after  a  short  period  of  rest  and
recuperation. (Tr. 34)
On July 3, 2008, a Special Forces Assistant Detachment Commander (ADC) wrote
that  Applicant  had  been  an  interpreter  for  U.S.  Army  Special  Operations  Forces  since
January 2007. (AE A at 14) Applicant previously served with the U.S. Army for two years.
(Id.) He “is available whenever he is needed, no matter what the hour or the mission calls
for.” He “is trustworthy and completely devoted to the success of the Coalition Forces in
Iraq.”  The  Special  Forces  ADC  attested  to  the  risks  Applicant  faced  because  of  his
contributions to the U.S. military, stating:
[He] has accompanied the team on at least 280 combat missions in hostile
territory . . . . He has taken enemy fire with the team and has been part of
an ODA convoy when it was struck by an IED. Besides the danger he faces
in operations with the ODA, is the danger he faces when he returns home
to [his] province. Many members of his community discourage cooperation
with  Coalition  Forces,  and  would  likely  punish  [Applicant]  and  his  family
severely if they found out about his work. . . . I would highly recommend
[Applicant] receive an immigration Visa to protect his family from the harsh
consequences that are sure to follow his cooperation with the United States.
In my opinion he has earned his place among Americans, as he has risked
his life to serve and protect them. (AE A at 14)
In 2008, another member of  the Counter-Terror Coalition Forces in  Iraq  indicated
Applicant  completed  “over  250   missions”  and   he  described  Applicant  as  “dedicated,
honest,  and  trustworthy –   a tremendous asset.”  He  said:  “Despite numerous threats to
his personal  and  family safety,  [Applicant] has remained steadfast in  his support  of the
United States  Armed Forces in   Iraq,  working long hours, maintaining an unpredictable
schedule, and  volunteering to support the  SFODA’s most  sensitive missions.” (AE A at
13)
In  2010,  an  Army  lieutenant  colonel,  who  is  a  battalion  commander  in  an  Army
combat division, praised Applicant for his reliability, professionalism, and contributions to
training his unit before their deployment. (AE A at 15) Applicant received 12 certificates
and letters of appreciation from various Army units. (AE A at 16-27)
Iraq
The Federal Republic of Iraq (Iraq) is a constitutional parliamentary republic. Iraq’s
2018  parliamentary  elections  generally  met  international  standards  of  free  and  fair
elections and led to the peaceful transition of power from Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi
to  Adil  Abd  al-Mahdi.  On  December  1,  2019,  in  response  to  protesters’  demands  for
significant changes to the political system, Abd al-Mahdi submitted his resignation, which
the Iraqi Council of Representatives (COR) accepted. Prime Minister Abd al-Mahdi has
continued to serve in a caretaker capacity while the COR works to identify a replacement
in accordance with the Iraqi constitution.
The  U.S.  Department  of  State  (DOS)  travel  advisory  for  Iraq  is  Level  4:  Do  not
travel to Iraq due to terrorism, kidnapping, armed conflict, the Global Health Advisory, and
Iraq’s limited capacity to provide support to U.S. citizens. U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high
risk for violence and kidnapping. Numerous terrorist and insurgent groups are active in
Iraq  and  regularly  attack  both  Iraqi  security  forces  and  civilians.  Anti-U.S.  sectarian
militias threaten U.S. citizens and Western companies throughout Iraq. Attacks by IEDs
occur in many areas of the country, including Baghdad.
On  May  15,  2019,  the  DOS  ordered  the  departure  of  non-emergency  U.S.
Government  employees  from  the  U.S.  Embassy  in  Baghdad  because  of  heightened
tension with Iran. On September 24, 2019, the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad again reported
heightened tensions, noting that attacks in major cities may occur without warning and
reiterating the DOS guidance to not travel to Iraq.
Beginning in early October 2019, the country experienced large-scale protests in
Baghdad and several Shia-majority governorates. Demonstrators gathered in the streets
to reinforce their demands for an end to corruption and a restructuring of the government.
Civilian  authorities  quickly  lost  control  of  the  situation.  Security  and  armed  groups,
including Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), responded with live ammunition, tear gas
canisters  shot  as  projectiles,  and  concussion  grenades,  in  an  attempt  to  suppress  the
demonstrations. By official accounts, as of December 17, 2019, more than 479 civilians
were killed and at least 20,000 were injured.
On  December  27,  2019,  a  rocket  attack  on  a  base  near  Kirkuk  in  northern  Iraq
killed a U.S. contractor and wounded four U.S. and two Iraqi servicemembers. Two days
later, the United States launched retaliatory airstrikes on five facilities (three in Iraq) used
by the Iran-backed Iraqi armed group Kata’ib Hezbollah (KH), to which the United States
attributed the December 27 attack and other attacks. On December 31, 2019, supporters
of  KH  and  other  Iran-backed  Iraqi  militias  surrounded  the  U.S.  Embassy  in  Baghdad,
forcing their way into the compound and setting some outer buildings on fire. Iraqi officials
and security forces reestablished order outside the embassy, but tensions remained high,
with KH supporters and other pro-Iran figures threatening further action and vowing to
expel the United States from Iraq by force if necessary.
On  January  2,  2020,  the  U.S.  Department  of  Defense  announced  that  the  U.S.
military  had  killed  the  Islamic  Revolutionary  Guards  Corps-Qods  Force  (IRGC-QF)
Commander, Major General Qasem Soleimani, in a defensive action. The statement cited
Soleimani’s  responsibility  for  the  deaths  of  hundreds  of  Americans  and  coalition
servicemembers and his approval of the  embassy blockade in Baghdad, and asserted
that he was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and servicemembers
in  Iraq  and  throughout  the  region.  According  to  subsequent  media  reports  and  United
States  statements,  Soleimani  was  killed  in  a  U.S.  drone  strike  while  leaving  Baghdad
International Airport early on the morning of January 3, 2020. In response, Prime Minister
Adel Abd al Mahdi and President Barham Salih condemned the strike as a violation of
lraqi  sovereignty.  On  January  3,  2020,  the  U.S.  Embassy  issued  an  alert  that  cited
heightened tensions in Iraq and the region and urged American citizens to depart Iraq
immediately.  On  March  26,  2020,  due  to  a  combination  of  security  conditions  and
restricted travel options as a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic, the DOS ordered
the  departure  of  designated  U.S.  Government  employees  at  the  U.S.  Embassy  in
Baghdad and associated offices elsewhere in Iraq.
The  Islamic  State  in  Iraq  and  Syria  (ISIS)  is  a  designated  terrorist  organization
conducting an active insurgency in Syria, with direct links to terrorist groups in Iraq and
other parts of the world. It commits terrorist attacks, violent atrocities, and targets U.S.
citizens. The Iraqi government declared all of its territory liberated from ISIS in December
2017;  however,  despite  improved  government  control,  ISIS  remains  a  threat  to  public
safety in Iraq through the indiscriminate use of terrorist and asymmetrical attacks.
In  January  2019,  the  U.S.  Director  of  National  Intelligence  (DNI),  delivered  the
Worldwide Threat Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community. In his Statement for
the Record, the DNI provided the following assessment of the situation in Iraq: ISIS still
commands thousands of fighters in Iraq and Syria, and it maintains eight branches, more
than a dozen networks, and thousands of dispersed supporters around the world, despite
significant leadership and territorial losses. ISIS very likely will continue to pursue external
attacks  from  Iraq  and  Syria  against  regional  and  Western  adversaries,  including  the
United  States.  In  Iraq,  Iran-supported  Popular  Mobilization  Committee  (PMF)-affiliated
Shia militias remain the primary threat to U.S. personnel, and the DNI expected that threat
to increase as the threat ISIS poses to the militias recedes, Iraqi Government formation
concludes, some Iran-backed groups call for the United States to withdraw, and tension
between Iran and the United States grows. The DNI continued to watch for signs that the
Iranian regime might direct its proxies and partners in Iraq to attack US interests. Iraq is
facing an increasingly disenchanted public. The underlying political and economic factors
10
that facilitated the rise of ISIS persist, and Iraqi Shia militias’ attempts to further entrench
their role in the state increase the threat to US personnel. Iraqi Shia militants conducted
several attacks against US diplomatic facilities in Iraq in September and December 2018.
There is a serious risk from terrorism in Baghdad and Basra. ISIS fighters have
gone underground and formed cells that still pose a danger throughout Iraq. These cells
will continue with their attempts to carry out high-profile attacks on Iraqi Security Force
personnel, government installations, and other soft targets in major population centers.
Iranian-backed  Shia  militias  have  previously  targeted  U.S.  interests  in  Iraq.  There  are
reports  of  Shia  militia  groups  kidnapping  locals,  foreign  workers,  and  members  of
international  organizations  and  demanding  ransoms  from  either  their  families  or  their
employers. A number of militia groups remain hostile to U.S. interests and continue to
pose a considerable potential threat, as either organized groups or individually as rogue
elements that may take independent action.
According  to  the  United  Nations,  ISIS  has  killed  more  than  3,000  civilians  and
injured more than 4,600 people since 2017. In its 2019 Human Rights Report, the U.S.
DOS noted that Iraq’s most significant human rights issues included: reports of unlawful
or  arbitrary  killings,  including  extra-judicial  killings;  forced  disappearances;  torture;
arbitrary  detention;  harsh  and  life-threatening  prison  and  detention  center  conditions;
arbitrary  or  unlawful  interference  with  privacy;  the  worst  forms  of  restrictions  on  free
expression, the press, and the internet, including violence against journalists, censorship,
site  blocking,  and  criminal  libel;  significant  interference  with  the  rights  of  peaceful
assembly;  legal  restrictions  on  freedom  of  movement  of  women;  threats  of  violence
against internally displaced persons (IDPs) and returnee populations perceived to have
been affiliated with ISIS; and widespread official corruption.
Iraq’s  government,  including  the  Office  of  the  Prime  Minister,  investigated
allegations of abuses and atrocities perpetrated by the Iraqi Security Forces, including an
investigation  of  the  October  protests,  but  the  Iraqi  government  rarely  punished  those
responsible  for  perpetrating  or  authorizing  human  rights  abuses.  Moreover,  despite  a
reduction in numbers, ISIS continued to commit serious abuses and atrocities, including
killings  through  suicide  bombings  and  IEDs.  Some  allegations  of  ISIS  abuses  and
atrocities  were  prosecuted,  including  suspected  ISIS  members  under  the  2005
counterterrorism law.
The 2015 Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Protection Act
of 2015 makes citizens of lraq ineligible to travel or be admitted to the United States under
the Visa Waiver Program. This exclusion reflects the determination of the Secretary of
Homeland Security that Iraqi citizens are more likely to be a credible threat to the national
security  of the  United  States;  and  that  a foreign terrorist  organization has a significant
presence in Iraq; or that Iraq is a safe haven for terrorists.
The U.S. Mission in Iraq is dedicated to our enduring strategic partnership with the
Government  of  Iraq  and  the  Iraqi  people.  In  coordination  with  the  Global  Coalition  to
Defeat  ISIS,  the  United  States  assisted  Iraq’s  efforts  to  achieve  the  December  2017
milestone of liberating the country from ISIS. Following the territorial defeat of ISIS in Iraq,
11
the  United   States  increased  efforts  to  stabilize   liberated  areas  as  Iraq   continues  to
develop as a sovereign, stable, and self-reliant country. Iraq is  now  a key partner  for the
United States in  the  region  as well as a  voice  of  moderation and  democracy in  the Middle
East.   Iraq   benefits  from  functioning  government  institutions,  including   an  active
legislature, and  plays an increasingly constructive  role in  the region. The  United States
maintains vigorous and  broad engagement  with Iraq on diplomatic, political, economic,
and   security  issues  in  accordance  with  the  U.S.-Iraq  Strategic  Framework  Agreement
(SFA).  The  SFA  between Iraq and  the United States provides the foundation for  the U.S.-
Iraq  bilateral   relationship.  Covering  a  wide  range  of  bilateral   issues,   including  political
relations and diplomacy, defense and  security, trade  and  finance, energy, judicial and law
enforcement
it
emphasizes the  important relationship and  common goals the  two  countries share. Efforts
to implement the SFA  are overseen by the Higher Coordinating Committee and several
Joint Coordination Committees.
issues,  services,  science,  culture,  education,   and   environment,
U.S.  bilateral   assistance   to  Iraq  focuses  on  economic  reform,  assistance  to
vulnerable  groups,  and   democracy  and   governance.  The   U.S.  continues   to  help
strengthen the capacity of Iraq’s civil society  organizations and  elected representatives.
U.S. bilateral  assistance  aims not  only to  bolster  Iraq’s democratic institutions,  but  also to
preserve the strategic, political, and  economic importance of  the U.S.-Iraq  partnership in
a changing  Middle East  region. Since 2014, the United States has contributed  billions of
dollars in  humanitarian,  demining, and  stabilization aid  to conflict-affected and displaced
Iraqis in the region, including support for communities recovering from genocide.
Jordan
The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan (Jordan) is a constitutional monarchy ruled by
King Abdullah II bin Hussein. In 2013 and 2014, the U.S. provided Jordan $2.25 billion in
loan guarantees, allowing Jordan access to affordable financing from international capital
markets. The U.S.-Jordan free trade agreement (FTA), the U.S.’s first FTA with an Arab
country, has expanded the trade relationship by reducing barriers for services, providing
cutting-edge  protection  for  intellectual  property,  ensuring  regulatory  transparency,  and
requiring effective labor and environmental enforcement. The United States and Jordan
have an “open skies” civil aviation agreement; a bilateral investment treaty; a science and
technology  cooperation  agreement;  and  a  memorandum  of  understanding  on  nuclear
energy cooperation. Such agreements bolster efforts to help diversify Jordan’s economy
and  promote  growth.  Jordan  and  the  United  States  belong  to  a  number  of  the  same
international  organizations,  including  the  United  Nations,  International  Monetary  Fund,
World Bank, and World Trade Organization. Jordan also is a Partner for Cooperation with
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
The U.S. DOS assesses the threat of terrorism in Jordan as high; with the capital
of Amman currently assessed as a high-threat location for terrorist activity directed at or
affecting  official  U.S.  Government  interests.  Transnational  and  indigenous  terrorist
groups in Jordan have demonstrated the capability to plan and implement attacks. Violent
extremist groups in Syria and Iraq, including the Islamic State of lraq and the Levant (ISIL)
(also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS) and Jabhat al-Nusra, have
conducted attacks in Jordan and continue to plot against local security forces, U.S. and
Western interests, and soft targets such as high-profile public events, hotels, places of
worship, restaurants, schools, and malls. Jordan’s prominent role in the effort to defeat
ISIS, and its shared borders with Iraq and Syria, increase the potential for future terrorist
incidents.
Although  Jordan  remained  a  committed  partner  on  counterterrorism  and
countering  violent  extremism  in  2016,  numerous  terrorist  incidents  reflect  the  current
security situation in Jordan: throughout 2017, multiple vehicle-borne improvised explosive
devices detonated in and around a refugee camp in Syria near the Jordanian border; and
in October 2017, two homemade explosive devices were found in another refugee camp
in Jordan. Also in October 2017, the State Security Court (SSC) prosecuted six people
for sympathizing with ISIS, after they created social media accounts to recruit Jordanian
supporters for ISIS and promoted terrorist activity. In September 2017, the SSC charged
16 people with a terrorist plot involving the use of automatic weapons to carry out terrorist
attacks  against  public  security  services;  and  the  Jordanian  General  Intelligence
Directorate arrested a 10-person ISIS cell that was planning to attack security forces and
tourist  locations using  explosive suicide belts.  Throughout  2017, there  were numerous
instances of extremists posting pro-ISIS videos or statements on social media.
U.S. involvement in  Iraq  and  Syria  and the U.S. Government’s policies on Israel,
have  fueled anti-American feelings in  Jordan. Recent surveys reflect that over 80%  of  the
Jordanian population has an unfavorable view  of the U.S. Government. The  U.S. DOS
has assessed  Amman as being a  high-threat  location for  political  violence directed at  or
affecting official  U.S. Government interests. In December 2017, protests took place at the
U.S.  Embassy  for   27 days  after  the  announcement  that  the  U.S.  Embassy  in  Tel   Aviv
would move to Jerusalem.
As  a  regional  leader  in   the  Global   Coalition  to  Defeat  ISIS,  Jordan  played  an
important role  in  Coalition successes in  degrading the terrorist group’s territorial  control
and   operational  reach.  During  2016,  Jordanian  authorities  took  legal   action  against
numerous individuals accused  of  terrorism under Jordanian law. On July 13, 2016, the
Jordanian  State  Security  Court  filed  charges  against  21  suspected  ISIS  affiliates  in
connection  with the pre-emptive March raid on an alleged ISIS safe house in  lrbid. The
DOS  assesses that the potential for terrorist activity is heightened as Jordan participates
in  the coalition against  ISIS. Extremist groups have  carried out terrorist activities against
U.S.  and   Jordanian  government  targets  in  Jordan.   Terrorist  groups  often  do  not
distinguish between U.S. Government personnel and private U.S. citizens, and  may target
areas  frequented  by  Westerners,  such   as  tourist  sites,  hotels,   restaurants,  shopping
malls, and transportation hubs.
According  to  the  DOS  2017  Human  Rights  Report,  Jordan’s  most  significant
continuing  human  rights  problems  include  allegations  of  torture  by  security  and
government officials; arbitrary arrest and detention, including of activists and journalists;
infringements on privacy rights; restrictions on freedom of expression; and restrictions on
freedom  of  association  and  assembly.  Impunity  remained  widespread,  and  the
13
government  did  not  take  sufficiently  strong  steps  to  investigate,  prosecute,  or  punish
officials who committed abuses.
The Jordanian SSC took legal action against numerous individuals deemed to be
terrorists under local law, including the arrest and prosecution of men accused of seeking
to  join  Al-Nusra  Front  (ANF)  and  ISIS.  Other  arrests  and  prosecutions  involved
supporting/recruiting for ISIS and attempted travel to/from Syria in  support of extremist
activities and also for “propagating ISIL ideology,” a charge often used for online activity.
",True
"Applicant denied all four SOR allegations. After a thorough  and  careful review  of
the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  47-year-old  employee  of   a  defense  contractor.  (GX  1  at  page  5.)
He   has  been  employed  with  the   defense  contractor   since   2019.  He   does  not   hold   a
security  clearance.  (TR at page 26 lines 7~21.)  He  is married  to  a U.S.  citizen, and  has
one  child, age  nine. (TR at page  24 line 22 to page 25 line 12, and at page 29 line 23 to
page 30 line 4.)
Applicant left  Iran in  1994. (TR at page 13 lines 11~14.)  He  first went to Turkey,
then  to  Germany,  and  finally  to   the  United   States  in   2003.  (TR  at  page  16   line  19  to
page  17   line  18.)  He   later   received   a  bachelor’s  degree  from  an  American  university.
(TR  at   page  17  lines  14~21.)   He   is  a   Christian;  and   as  such,   was  treated  like  a  “third
class citizen” in Iran. (TR at page 14 line 6 to page 15 line 4.)
Guideline B - Foreign Influence
1.a.  Applicant’s  mother  is  a  citizen   and   resident  of  Iran.  She  is  “a  housewife.”
Applicant  contacts  her  a  couple   of  times  a  year,  the  last  time  being  seven  to  eight
months prior to his hearing. (TR at page 21 line 23 to page 22 line 13.)
1.b. Applicant’s father is a citizen and  resident  of Iran. He  is a retired legal clerk.
Applicant has little  contact with his father, the last time  being three to  four years prior  to
his hearing. (TR at page 20 line  19 to page 21 line 22.)
1.c.   Applicant’s  brother  is  a  citizen  and   resident  of  Iran.  “He  works  in   a  bank.”

She  “used   to  work”   in   the  field   of  agriculture,  and   he  is  retired  from  a  company  that
made cement.  Applicant  has not contacted his in-laws in  four or five years. (TR at page
23 line 6 to page 24 line 21.)
Notice
I  take  administrative  notice  of  the  following:  Iran  is  an  authoritarian  theocratic
republic  with  a  Shia  Islamic  political  system.  Iran  has  been  designated  as  a  State
Sponsor  of  Terrorism  since  1984.  In  the  past,  the  Iranian  government  has  spent  as
much  as  $700  million  per  year  to  support  terrorist  groups.  Subject  to  certain  limited
exceptions, citizens of Iran are currently barred from entry into the United States.

"Note:  In describing Applicant’s employment history, I use the phrases “diplomatic
post”  and   “diplomatic   facility”   (DF)   so  as   not   to   specifically  identify  them   more  than
necessary,  as  this  decision  is  to  be  posted  publically  on  the  DOHA   website.   (Tr.  122-
123) The facilities are identified in the record.
Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  allegations  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.e)  and  included  a
narrative  statement  with  her  Answer.  (Answer  Encl.  3)  Her  admissions  and  other
comments are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 42 years old. She was born and raised in Thailand. She earned her
bachelor’s degree in 2000 from a Thai university. She then came to the United States to
further  her  education.  She  studied  for  two  years  at  a  state  university  in  the  United
States, earning a master’s degree in May 2003. (GE 1; AE A; Tr. 22, 70, 74-75).
From  November  2003  to  January  2009,  Applicant  worked  at  a  Thai  diplomatic
facility (Thai DF 1) in the United States. She worked in consular affairs and then as an
assistant  to  a  senior  Thai  diplomat.  (GE  1;  Tr.  22,  32,  83-84)(SOR  ¶  1.e)  She  is  no
longer in touch with anyone she worked with there. (Tr. 84, 96-97)
Applicant  then  returned  to  Thailand.  After  a  brief  period  of  unemployment,  she
began working in August 2009 as a local employee at a U.S. diplomatic post in Thailand
as  an  immigrant  visa  assistant.  (GE  1;  Tr.  22-23,  33,  71)  She  testified  that  the  work
involved “very sensitive” personal information and she knew not to discuss it. (Tr. 72)
Applicant  remained  in  that  job  until  February  2012,  when  she  moved  to  the
United  States  to  marry  her  husband.  They  met  in  2010  when  he  was  a  U.S.  Foreign
Service officer serving in Thailand. They married in February 2012. They have lived in
the  United  States  ever  since,  with  her  husband’s  three  children  from  a  prior  marriage.
(GE 1; Tr. 74; AE E-F)
After immigrating to the United States, Applicant was unemployed while awaiting
a green card (November 2012) and work visa (November 2013, est.). She then worked
as  an  assistant  at  another  Thai  diplomatic  facility  in  the  United  States.  (Thai  DF  2).
Applicant  testified  that  she  was  considered  a  “local  employee,”  and  was  not  an
employee of the Thai Foreign Service. (Tr. 34-36) She was involved in visa applications
and protocol. (GE 1; Tr. 83-85, 102-103) She said she applied for the job because she
thought  she  might  get  hired  due  to  her  prior  work  at  Thai  DF  1.  (Tr.  100-101)  She
worked there from November 2013 to January 2018. (SOR ¶ 1.e)
Applicant  became  a  U.S.  citizen   in  July  2016.  (GE   1;   Tr.   73)   She  holds  a  valid
U.S. passport, issued a month later.  Since then, she has only used a U.S. passport  to
travel.  (Tr. 76)  Her Thai  passport  expired in  2019. (GE  1) She accepts no benefits from
being a Thai citizen and has no plans to return to Thailand permanently. (Tr. 76)
Applicant submitted her SCA in November 2017, in connection with a job offer for
a  cleared  position  with  a  State  Department  contractor.  She  worked  in  a  passport
issuance office at the State Department for about 18 months until her interim clearance
was  withdrawn  (likely  due  to  the  SOR).  Applicant  described  herself  as  a  hard  worker.
She  never  discusses  the  sensitive  or  classified  information  she  handled.  She  remains
sponsored for the position. (GE 1; Tr. 37-38, 70-71, 89-90, 107)
Applicant  also  testified  that  her  earlier  job  as  a  local  employee  at  the  U.S.
diplomatic post in Thailand required a background check. She was also briefed on what
to do if she was approached by someone outside the facility, and she was to report any
such contacts to the diplomatic security office. (Tr. 118-121)
Applicant’s  parents are citizens and  residents of Thailand. (SOR ¶  1.a) Her father
is  89   and   has  been  retired  for   many  years.  Applicant’s  mother   is  75.  She  worked  for
many years as a secretary for a car dealer.  Her longtime boss is elderly and retired, and
Applicant’s   mother  is   his  caregiver   and   financial  manager.  (Tr.  77-78)  Applicant   has
regular phone  calls  with  her parents and  frequent text  messages  with her  mother. (Tr.
23-24, 78)  Her conversations with her father are  brief because he is in  mental decline.
Her parents do  not  really know  or understand what Applicant  does for a  living. (Tr. 78-
80) Applicant and her husband do not provide her parents financial support. (Tr. 78, 92)
Applicant’s  two  brothers  also  remain  in  Thailand.  (SOR  ¶  1.b)  One  brother  is  a
former professor. He owns a small resort. They are in contact several times a year. The
other brother is unemployed. Applicant has little contact with him. They are not aware of
what she does for a living. (Tr. 80-82, 101) Applicant has returned to Thailand for family
visits five times since 2012, most recently in 2019. (Tr. 76, 92-96)
SOR  ¶  1.d  alleges  that  Applicant  maintains  contact  with  “friends  and  former
coworkers who are citizens and residents of Thailand.” This includes former co-workers
at the U.S. diplomatic facility in Thailand, whom she sees on return visits there. (Tr. 27,
38-42) She is friends with one local person in the United States. that she worked with at
Thai DF 2. They share an interest in food and do not discuss work or politics. (Tr.  38,
82-83, 85, 98, 105-106) She remains friends with one Thai diplomat she knew from that
job,  a  person  who  is  now  posted  overseas.  They  are  in  regular,  frequent  contact.  (Tr.
104-105) Applicant maintains no other regular, ongoing contact with any Thai diplomats
she has worked with in the past. (Tr. 96-100, 105-106)
Applicant  testified,  “The  U.S.  is  my  home.  I  love  this  country.  And  my  family  is
here.  In  total,  I  have  lived  here  for  17  years  of  my  life.  And  the  day  I  became  a  U.S.
citizen was one of the proudest days of my life.” (Tr. 85, 91) Her dream job is to work for
the U.S. Government. (Tr. 85-86) She has not voted in Thailand since becoming a U.S.
citizen. (Tr. 86) Applicant testified that she would report to authorities if she were ever
approached for information. (Tr. 87)
Applicant’s  husband  testified  as  a  character  witness.  They  met  in  early  2010
when  he  was  posted  to  Thailand  as  a  cleared  U.S.  Foreign  Service  officer,  while  on
sabbatical from law practice. They did not work together but he was aware of her duties.
(Tr. 17-18) He returned to the United States later that year. They kept in touch and their
romance  blossomed.  Applicant  came  to  the  United  States  on  a  fiancée  visa  (K-1)  in
February 2012, and they married soon after. (Tr. 19-21, 31; AE D)
Applicant’s husband is now counsel at a large law firm. (Tr. 27-28) Applicant is a
loving  and  caring  stepmother  to  his  three  teenage  children.  (Tr.  21,  30,  74;  AE  E)  He
and Applicant have significant financial assets in the United States, including their home
and  his  private  practice  income.  (Tr.  24-25,  86-88,  108;  AE  F)  Applicant  has  many
friends in the United States and in her local community. (Tr. 24, 88)
Applicant’s  husband  testified  that  the  day  Applicant  became  a  U.S.  citizen  was
one of the proudest days of her life, as well as his own. He also noted her pride and joy
in  voting  in  the  United  States  for  the  first  time.  He  said  she  is  a  proud  and  loyal  U.S.
citizen.  (Tr. 25-26)
Three other character witnesses (W1, W2, W3) testified by phone. W1 is a reti
red
U.S. Foreign Service  officer who retired to  Thailand. He  met  and  hired Applicant at the
U.S. diplomatic post  there and  was one  of  her  supervisors.  He  noted that consular and
visa  work  involves  sensitive   and  personal   information,   including  medical   information.
Applicant  was  very  reliable  in   handling  that  information.  He   trusted  her  judgment  and
discretion,  and   said   she  was  very  dedicated  to  her  job.  He   is  aware  of  her  prior  and
subsequent  work  at  the  Thai  DFs  in   the  U.S.  He   also  noted  that  many  Thai  citizens
have   married  U.S.  diplomats  and  become  U.S.  citizens   as  well  as  cleared  State
Department employees to do consular and visa work. (Tr. 45-51; AE D)
An example of such a person is W2. She was born in Thailand. She came to the
United  States  in  2000  and  has been  a  U.S.  citizen  since  2003.  She  has  been  a  State
Department employee since 2004. She works in human resources and has a clearance.
She  met  Applicant’s  husband  when  they  were  both  posted  to  Thailand,  and  met
Applicant in 2018. She and Applicant are close friends and socialized often (before the
pandemic).  W2  described  Applicant  as  a  “rule  follower,”  (Tr.  55-56)  and  a  loyal  U.S.
citizen who is worthy of holding a clearance. (Tr. 53-60; AE D)
W3  is  a  cleared  State  Department  contractor.  He  met  Applicant  when  they
worked  in  the  same  office,  in  about  2018.  They  bonded  because  W3  had  travelled  to
Thailand.  They  would  socialize  in  the  same  group  of  friends  at  work.  He  described
Applicant as dedicated, honest, hardworking, punctual, and “above average” in terms of
clearance suitability.  (Tr. 62-68)
I also considered the reference letters of the character witnesses who testified at
the hearing, as well as the letters from those who did not. They all offered similar, and
strong,  endorsements  of  Applicant’s  character,  value  to  the  United  States,  judgment,
trustworthiness, reliability, and overall suitability to hold a clearance. (AE D)
Kingdom of Thailand (Thailand)(AN I)
Thailand is a constitutional monarchy, with the king as head of state. King Rama
X was crowned in 2019, three years after the death of his father, who ruled for 70 years,
from 1946 until 2016. Thailand is also a parliamentary democracy, with a prime minister
as head of government.
From  May  2014  to  July  2019,  Thailand  was  governed  by  a  military  junta,  the
National Council for Peace and Order. Following the coup, the United States suspended
military  aid  to  Thailand.  This  period  saw  increased  cooperation  between  Thailand  and
the People’s Republic of China (PRC), and complicated U.S.-Thai relations.
Thailand has extensive trade and investment relations across the pacific region.
Historically, Thailand has close ties with the PRC, and trade has burgeoned under the
2010  China-ASEAN  Free  Trade  Agreement.  Unlike  several  of  its  neighbors,  Thailand
has no territorial disputes with the PRC in the South China Sea and has been loath to
take  an assertive stance against  China's actions there.  As a member  of the China-led
Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Thailand is involved in a high-speed railway project that
would connect southern China with several Southeast Asian nations.
Following democratic elections in Thailand in 2019, U.S. military assistance has
resumed,  and  military  cooperation  has  increased.  The  2020  Cobra  Gold  military
exercise was the largest ever of that annual event.
Thailand has indicated it wants to reset its relationship with the United States.  As
one  of  Southeast  Asia's  most  developed  nations  and  a  long-time  U.S.  partner  on  a
range  of  issues,  Thailand  has  the  potential  to  support  U.S.  initiatives  such  as
broadening regional defense cooperation. However, U.S. policymakers face challenges
in  rekindling  the  relationship  while  encouraging  Thailand  to  fully  return  to  democratic
norms. Among U.S. concerns are the Thai government's continued efforts to suppress
criticism,  including  muzzling  journalists  and  banning  one  of  the  largest  opposition
parties, as well as other human rights issues.
While  AN  I  details  instances  of  domestic  terrorism,  Thailand  experienced  no
attacks attributed to  transnational  terrorist  groups in 2019,  and violence was  restricted
to  attacks  attributed  to  ethno-nationalist  insurgents  in  the  country's  restive  southern
region.
According to a March 1, 2021 travel advisory, the State Department urges U.S.
citizens to reconsider travel to Thailand (Level 3) due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The
same advisory notes that Thai borders currently remain closed for all foreign nationals,
with few exceptions.

"The SOR alleges under Guideline B that Applicant’s spouse is a citizen of Taiwan
with U.S. permanent residency currently residing in the United States (SOR ¶ 1.a); that
his mother-in-law (SOR ¶ 1.b), brother-in-law (SOR ¶ 1.c), sister-in-law (SOR ¶ 1.d), and
three friends (SOR ¶ 1.e) are resident citizens of Taiwan; and that Applicant maintains
contact with two Taiwanese citizens currently serving in Taiwan’s Air Force (SOR ¶ 1.f).
Applicant  admitted  the  allegations,  but  he  also  stated  that  he  reported  his  initial
relationship with his spouse  as well as their engagement, and   marriage   to his employer’s
security office; that he has limited casual  contact and  correspondence with his brother-in-
law in  Taiwan and  has no ability to  communicate with his mother-in-law and  sister-in-law
in   Taiwan   because  they  do  not  speak  English,  and   he  does  not   speak  Chinese.  He
explained   that the three friends referenced in   the SOR are his spouse’s friends, whom he
casually  met  in   Taiwan.  He   denied  any  current  contact  with  them.   As   for  the  two
Taiwanese   citizens  currently  serving  in  Taiwan’s  military,  Applicant  indicated  that  he
communicates with them only on business for his defense-contractor employer.
After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  60-year-old  electrical  engineer.  A  lifelong  resident  citizen  of  the
United States, he has worked for the same defense contractor since October 1984 and
seeks  to  retain  security  clearance  eligibility,  which  he  has  held  throughout  his
employment. In approximately June 1995, he was granted a Top Secret clearance. He
has  held  a  Secret  clearance  since  approximately  March  2011.  His  uncontroverted
testimony is that he has never committed a security violation. Applicant has a bachelor’s
degree  earned  in  about  July  1993  and  a  master’s  degree  in  business  administration,
which he earned in April 2004.  He has two sons, ages 30 and 25, from his first marriage.
His sons are serving in the  National Guard  and the U.S. Reserve forces, respectively.
(GE 1; Tr. 43, 47-48.) Applicant’s parents, who are deceased, were native-born citizens
of the United States. Applicant’s four siblings are U.S. resident citizens. (GE 1.)
Applicant has traveled frequently to Taiwan on business for his defense-contractor
employer since at least April 2014. Some of those business trips between 2015 and 2017
required extended stays of over 30 days in Taiwan. (GE 1; Tr. 71.) More recent trips to
Taiwan  in  April  2018,  June  2018,  January  2019,  late  February  2019,  April  2019,  and
October  2019,  were  for  less  than  30  days  each.  (GE  2;  Tr.  45,  73.)  Applicant  went  to
Taiwan for his work in September 2020 for what he thought would be a brief stay. He
remained in Taiwan for his employer until December 2020. (Tr. 45, 72.)
Applicant met his current spouse through an online dating site. He joined the site
in the United States but viewed her profile for the first time while he was in Taiwan on
business in July 2015. They began dating shortly thereafter, and he eventually shared
with her that he was in Taiwan for his employer. He testified that he held off telling his
spouse what he does for a living for as long as he possibly could. (Tr. 75.) A native of
Taiwan,  his  spouse  was  educated  through  college  in  Taiwan  and  worked  as  an
accountant for a car manufacturer in Taiwan. Applicant and his spouse became engaged
in March 2016 and cohabited from January 2017 to April 2017, when he was on business
in Taiwan. (Tr. 49-51, 72-75.) After they were engaged, he informed his spouse that he
holds a security clearance. (Tr. 77.) In February 2017, Applicant and his spouse had a
dinner  reception  in  Taiwan  to  celebrate  their  upcoming  nuptials  with  her  family  and
friends.  (Tr.  36,  51,  80.)  Applicant  informed  security  personnel  at  work  about  his
relationship  with  his  spouse  on  his  return  from  his  trip  to  Taiwan  in  2015,  and  as  it
progressed from dating to engagement to marriage. (Tr. 75-76.)
Applicant’s spouse entered the United States on a K-1 fiancée visa in April 2017
under Applicant’s sponsorship, and they married in May 2017. (GE 1; Tr. 52.) Applicant’s
spouse acquired U.S. permanent-residency status on October 27, 2017. (GE 2; AE A.)
Required to leave the United States to renew her U.S. permanent residency, Applicant’s
spouse joined Applicant on a business trip to Taiwan. She stayed with her family during
their two weeks in Taiwan, and he went to the southern part of the country for his work.
(Tr. 52.) Her U.S. permanent residency status was renewed and is now set to expire on
February 18, 2031. (AE A.) She intends to become a U.S. citizen. She applied for U.S.
naturalization  in  June  2020,  and  has  her  citizenship  interview  scheduled  for  April  20,
2021. (AE B; Tr. 54-55.) Applicant states that his spouse will relinquish her Taiwanese
passport when she becomes a U.S. citizen. (Tr. 55.)
Applicant’s spouse worked as an accountant in the United States before taking her
present position as a full-time financial controller. (Tr. 52.) She and Applicant are in the
process of jointly purchasing a condominium in the United States. They do not intend to
move to Taiwan when Applicant retires. (Tr. 70.) Applicant owns their current home, which
had been his residence during much of his first marriage. He retained the house in his
divorce from his first wife. (GE 1.) Neither Applicant nor his spouse owns any financial or
property  interests  in  Taiwan.  (Tr.  68-69.)  Applicant  testified  that  if  his  spouse  were  to
inherit any asset in Taiwan, she would give it to her brother. (Tr. 84.)
Applicant’s spouse has close relationships with her mother, her brother, and her
brother’s wife, who are resident citizens of Taiwan. Her father is deceased. Her mother
works part time as a seamstress in Taiwan. She speaks no English. Applicant’s spouse
“misses” her mother, with whom she speaks via “a FaceTime type of thing” three or four
times a week. (Tr. 55-56.) After immigrating to the United States, Applicant’s spouse sent
her mother financial support at $500 monthly until early 2020, when her brother and his
wife  moved  in  with  their  mother,  who  owns  her  home  in  Taiwan.  (Tr.  83.)  Applicant’s
spouse has sent her mother $500 every three months or so since early 2020. (Tr. 81-82.)
Applicant’s spouse also gives her mother small items that can fit in Applicant’s suitcase
when  he  travels  to  Taiwan  on  business.  Applicant  understands  that  it  is  culturally
important to his spouse to provide for her mother, and he does not have an issue with the
amount of financial support or the gifts his spouse sends her mother. (Tr. 56-57, 83.) To
Applicant’s  knowledge,  his  mother-in-law  has  no  connection  to  Taiwan’s  or  China’s
government. (Tr. 57.) He does not think that his mother-in-law knows what he does for a
living. (Tr. 61.)
Applicant’s  spouse’s brother works for a cement company in Taiwan. He served
two  years  of  compulsory  military  service  in  Taiwan’s  Navy,  but  has  no  other  military
service.  Applicant  does  not  know  the  dates  of  his  brother-in-law’s  service  in  Taiwan’s
Navy. (Tr. 58-59.) Applicant does not believe his brother-in-law has any current ties to
Taiwan’s government. His brother-in-law speaks a little English and his brother-in-law’s
wife speaks even less English. (Tr. 45, 74.) Applicant’s facility with the Chinese language
is limited to only basic pleasantries, so he converses with his brother-in-law in  English.
(Tr. 74.) As  for  his brother-in-law’s wife,   Applicant believes her work in   Taiwan involves
paperwork for   vehicle  imports. (Tr.  62-63.) Applicant’s   spouse    has a close relationship
with  her  brother,  but  she  is  not  particularly   close  to  his  wife.  She   contacts  her  brother
“maybe a   couple   times a   week or less.” (Tr.   63.)   She speaks with her sister-in-law when
she is on a call  with her brother.  Applicant  does not believe his spouse contacts her sister-
in-law directly. (Tr. 63.) Applicant first met his brother-in-law and  sister-in-law in  August
2015. (GE 1.)  On almost every business trip that he has to Taiwan since his marriage  in
May 2017, Applicant has met  with his brother-in-law and sister-in-law for  lunch or dinner
on his arrival in  Taiwan to exchange   personal   items (“shoes, clothes, and   stuff”) between
Applicant’s spouse   and her family. (Tr. 44-45, 73-74.)  During his latest stay in Taiwan for
work from  September 2020 through  December 2020, Applicant met  with his brother-in-
law and  sister-in-law twice. The  second  time was so tha
t they could give Applicant some
items that they had   purchased for   Applicant’s spouse   at her request.   (Tr. 45.)   Applicant
does not stay with his spouse’s family when he is in Taiwan. (Tr. 60.)   Applicant listed his
brother-in-law as a foreign contact on his August 2017  SCA because of their in-person
contact when Applicant is in  Taiwan.  (GE 1.) Applicant has limited contact with his brother-
in-law otherwise. As for his contacts with his sister-in-law, Applicant stated on his SCA,
“There is no regular frequency of contact   for me   or my wife.   We would only see her with
family during trips back to Taiwan.” (GE 1.)
Applicant’s brother-in-law is aware of Applicant’s defense-contractor employment.
Applicant  does  not  believe  his  mother-in-law  or  sister-in-law  know  the  identity  of  his
employer. Applicant’s mother-in-law, brother-in-law, and sister-in-law are aware that he
travels  to  Taiwan  to  support  a  defense  program,  but  Applicant  does  not  discuss  the
technical aspects of his work with them. Applicant is “not sure” whether they know that he
holds a security clearance. He has not told them. (Tr. 61.)
Applicant’s spouse’s mother, brother, and sister-in-law came to the United States
for the first time in July 2019. They spent two weeks and stayed with Applicant and his
spouse, who took them to restaurants, tourist sites, and a ball park. (Tr. 59.) Applicant
considers his in-laws to be family. They have been “very kind” to  him. Applicant states
that his in-laws support the U.S.-Taiwan relationship and are not sympathetic to China.
(Tr. 44-45.)
On his August 2017 SCA, Applicant included as foreign contacts three friends of
his spouse who are resident citizens of Taiwan: a close female friend whom his spouse
contacted  weekly  by  text  message  and  an  occasional  call;  that  friend’s  husband,  with
whom Applicant had occasional contact between August 2015 and April 2017 while on
trips to Taiwan; and another female friend with whom his spouse had ongoing contact by
text messages and calls. Applicant first met this friend of his spouse in May 2016. That
friend visited Applicant and his spouse in the United States for two weeks in July 2017.
(GE 1; Tr. 65-67.) It was this friend’s first time in the United States. (Tr. 67.) During the
three  months  that  he  and  his  spouse  lived  together  in  Taiwan  in  early  2017,  they
socialized with these friends a few times. Applicant does not have any contact with his
spouse’s friends on his own. He is aware that his spouse still has contact with her friends,
but  he  does  not  think   it  is  very  frequent.  (Tr.   64.)   His  spouse’s  close  female    friend  in
Taiwan  is  unemployed.   Her  spouse   works  in   sales   for   a  U.S.-based  personal-care
products  company  in  Taiwan.  (Tr.  65.)  The  other  female  friend  works  in  business
development for a European car company in Taiwan. (Tr. 66.) To Applicant’s knowledge,
none of these Taiwanese nationals knows about his employment or that he has  a security
clearance.   (Tr.  67.)   Applicant  regards  these  three  friends  of  his  spouse   as  casual
acquaintances of his. (Tr. 45.)
On  his  August  2017  SCA,  Applicant  also  reported  that  he  had  a  business
relationship  with  a  member  of  Taiwan’s  Air  Force  because  of  his  work  for  the  U.S.
government in Taiwan. (GE 1.) At his hearing, he testified that he had contact with two
Taiwanese Air Force officers for his work in Taiwan, but one of them has since moved on
from  the  contract.  His  relations  with  these  Taiwanese  resident  citizens  were  purely
professional. (Tr. 44, 67-68.)
Character Reference
A friend of Applicant’s  since 1974 considers Applicant  “a true American patriot.”
This friend retired from the U.S. military at the rank of lieutenant colonel and held high-
level security clearances during his military career. He considers Applicant to be honest
and trustworthy, and recommends him for the highest level of clearance eligibility. He has
not  known  Applicant  to  talk  about  his  work  with  the  defense  contractor.  This  friend
attended  the  dinner  in  Taiwan  to  celebrate  Applicant’s  and  his  spouse’s  upcoming
wedding  in  2017.  He  met  Applicant’s  in-laws  at  the  dinner,  but  he  did  not  have  much
communication with them because of the language barrier. He is aware that Applicant’s
brother-in-law had served in Taiwan’s Navy. (Tr. 34-39.)
Administrative Notice
After reviewing U.S. government publications concerning Taiwan and China and
their foreign relations and mindful of my obligation to consider updated information, I take
administrative notice of the facts requested by the Government as supplemented by the
following facts:
Taiwan  is  a  multi-party  democracy  established  as  a  separate,  independent
government  by  refugees  from  mainland  China  in  1949.  The  United  States  recognized
Taiwan as an independent government until January 1979, when a Joint Communique
switched formal diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing. In the Joint Communique,
the United States acknowledged China’s position that there is but one China and Taiwan
is  part  of  China,  while  asserting  that  the  United  States  would  maintain  cultural,
commercial,  and  other  unofficial  relations  with  the  people  of  Taiwan.  While  the  United
States does not support  Taiwan’s independence, the United States remains committed
to assisting Taiwan in maintaining its defensive capabilities, and the two countries share
a robust unofficial relationship. Taiwan has historically been an active collector of U.S.
economic  intelligence  and  technology,  but  recent  cases  involving  the  illegal  export  or
attempted  export  of  U.S.  restricted,  dual-use  or  military  technology  by  Taiwanese
nationals have been for the benefit of China or Chinese entities.  In November 2018, a
Chinese government-owned integrated-circuits company established in July 2016 for the
sole  purpose  of  designing,  developing,  and  manufacturing  a  dynamic  random-access
memory  device;  a  semiconductor  foundry  headquartered  in  Taiwan  with  offices
worldwide; and three Taiwanese nationals; were indicted for conspiring to steal for China
and  the  Taiwanese  foundry  the  trade  secrets  of  a  U.S.-based  leader  in  the  global
semiconductor industry.
Since the election of President Tsai Ing-wen of the Democratic Progressive Party
in 2016, China has taken significant coercive measures against Taiwan, despite Taiwan
wanting to maintain the status quo. China has suspended  cross-strait communications
and meetings; pressured countries with whom Taiwan has unofficial relations to terminate
their relations with Taiwan; collaborated with individuals and organizations in Taiwan that
support  cross-Strait  unification;  spread  disinformation  through  social  media  and  other
online  tools;  and  expanded  and  intensified  Chinese  military  training  activities  near
Taiwan. China’s ongoing military, diplomatic, and economic pressure against Taiwan led
the  United  States  to  urge  Beijing  in  January  2021  to  cease  its  efforts  at  intimidation
against Taiwan and other countries in the Indo-Pacific region. To counter China’s efforts,
Taiwan is looking to strengthen its partnership with the United States. Because China is
Taiwan’s  largest  trading  partner,  China  continues  to  have  an  outsized  influence  on
Taiwan’s economy.
China’s overall strategy toward Taiwan continues to incorporate elements of both
persuasion and coercion to hinder the development of political attitudes in Taiwan that
favor independence. China has not renounced the use of military force against Taiwan,
and  its  aggressive  intelligence  activities  against  Taiwan  include  employing  intelligence
operatives based in Taiwan. Among U.S. allies and partners, Taiwan is a prominent target
of Chinese espionage. Its economic espionage poses a threat to Taiwan’s security and
to the security of U.S. military information and equipment to which Taiwan has access.
China  is  an  authoritarian  state  with  paramount  authority  vested  in  the  Chinese
Communist Party (CCP). In all important government, economic, and cultural institutions
in China, the CCP ensures that party and state policy guidance is followed. President Xi
has very few checks on his power as Beijing continues to restrict the personal freedoms
of its citizens. China presents a persistent espionage and cyber-attack threat to the United
States  as  China  seeks  to  support  its  strategic  development  goals  in  science  and
technology  advancement,  military  modernization,  and  economic  policy.  To  support  its
military  modernization,  China  fills  the  gaps  in  its  defense  and  commercial  research  by
engaging  in  large-scale,  state-sponsored  theft  of  intellectual  property  and  proprietary
information. In accord with its national security objective to leverage legally and illegally
acquired  dual-use  and  military-related  technologies  to  its  advantage,  China  uses  its
intelligence services, computer intrusions, and other illicit approaches to obtain national
security and export-controlled technologies, controlled  equipment,  and other materials.
China leverages foreign investments, commercial joint ventures, academic exchanges,
the experience of Chinese students and researchers, and state-sponsored industrial and
technical  espionage  to  increase  the  level  of  technologies  and  expertise  available  to
support its military research, development, and acquisition. China blends intelligence and
non-intelligence assets and frequently seeks to exploit Chinese citizens or persons with
family  ties  to  China  who  can  use  their  insider  access  to  steal  trade  secrets  from  U.S.
companies. Reports of Chinese espionage have increased significantly in recent years.
In June 2019, a Chinese electrical engineer with part-time residency in the United
States was found guilty of multiple federal charges, including engaging in a scheme to
illegally  obtain  integrated  semiconductor  chips  with  military  applications  that  were
exported to China without the required export license. China also targets U.S. security-
clearance holders. In May 2019, a former U.S. intelligence officer, who held a Top Secret
clearance until he left government service in October 2012, was sentenced to 20 years in
prison  for  conspiring  with  a  Chinese  intelligence  officer  to  transmit  national  defense
information to China. In July 2019, a former employee of the U.S. State Department with
a  Top  Secret  clearance  received  a  40-month  prison  sentence  for  conspiring  with  two
Chinese  intelligence  agents  to  defraud  the  United  States.  She  failed  to  report  her
repeated  contacts  with  the  foreign  intelligence  agents  who  provided  her  with  tens  of
thousands of dollars in gifts and benefits over five years in return for her providing internal
State Department documents on topics ranging from economics to visits by dignitaries
between the two countries. In December 2020, the U.S. State Department issued a level
3 travel advisory for China due to China’s arbitrary enforcement of local laws, including
carrying  out  unlawful  detentions  and  using  bans  on  U.S.  citizens  and  those  of  other
countries without due process of law.

¶¶ 1.d-1.f, admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.h and 1.i in part, admitted SOR ¶ 2.a with an explanation,
and denied SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 1.g. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing
are incorporated in my findings of fact.
From October 2006 to April 2017, Applicant was a partner and the chief operating
officer of a company in Jordan, importing and selling goods in Jordan. The company was
not profitable, and he left it in April 2017 and began working for his current employer. (GX
2 at 14-15.) Since May 2017, he has been employed by a defense contractor as a linguist
in  support  of  a  U.S.  Marine  Corps  team  in  Jordan.  He  has  received  numerous  unit
patches,  challenge  coins,  and  a  letter  of  appreciation  from  the  team  leader,  a  Marine
Corps lieutenant colonel. (AX Y.) He has never held a security clearance. (Tr. 14.)
From May 2005 to March 2017, Applicant resided in Jordan in an apartment that
he owned jointly with his daughter. He gave his interest in the apartment to his daughter,
who is now the sole owner. She is now living in the United States. (GX 3.) His daughter
has no plans to return to Jordan. She intends to stay in the United States, graduate from
college, and attend medical school. (Tr. 55.)
Applicant and his aunt jointly own a home in the United States. They received the
home as a gift from Applicant’s father in June 2015. In his SCA, Applicant listed the home
as his permanent residence since March 2017. His aunt and his daughter currently live in
his U.S. home. (Tr. 47-48; AX L.)
While Applicant previously resided in Jordan, he employed a live-in housekeeper
who was a citizen of Indonesia with a work permit in Jordan. He hired his housekeeper
through  a  local  agency.  She  stopped  working  for  Applicant  about  a  year  ago.  (Tr.  20)
Although Applicant has returned to Jordan, he does not employ a housekeeper.
Applicant was born in Iraq, but he is a U.S. citizen by birth. (AX P.) His mother is
a native-born citizen of the United States and is a dual citizen of the United States and
the United Kingdom. His mother resides in the United States but spends summers in the
United Kingdom. (GX 8 at 11.) Applicant acquired Iraqi citizenship by virtue of his birth in
Iraq and the Iraqi citizenship of his father. His father was born in Iraq and is now a citizen
of the United Kingdom. His parents met while his father was attending a university in the
United States. After they married in July 1961, they lived in Iraq, where Applicant’s father
and  grandfather  owned  and  operated  an  aluminum  factory,  and  Applicant’s  mother
worked  for  the  American  Embassy  in  Bagdad.  His  parents  then  moved  to  the  United
Kingdom,  where  Applicant  attended  a  boarding  school  and  high  school.  Applicant
attended some college in the United States but completed his college education in the
United Kingdom. He obtained a bachelor’s degree from American International University,
located in the United Kingdom, in July 1989. He was a dual citizen of the United States
and Iraq until he renounced his Iraqi citizenship in July 1997. (GX 8 at 10.)
Applicant’s brother is a dual citizen of the United States and the United Kingdom.
He lives and works in the United States. Applicant’s sister is a dual citizen and resident
of the United States and the United Kingdom. She lives and works in the United Kingdom.
(GX 2 at 23-26.)
After graduating from college, Applicant worked for his father in a construction and
land-development  business.  At  some  time  in  1997,  he  returned  to  Iraq  to  work  for  his
father. While in Iraq, he met his first wife, a citizen and resident of Iraq. They married in
November  1997  in  Iraq.  Their  only  child  was  born  in  April  2001.  Applicant’s  wife  was
employed by the United Nations and was assigned to work in Jordan in 2003. (GX 6 at
5.) Applicant remained in Iraq, working as a liaison officer and coordinator for the United
States Agency for International Development (USAID), until he moved to Jordan in 2004,
when his wife became ill. (Answer to SOR at 6.) His wife passed away in June 2005. (AX
R.) He has not been in Iraq since 2010. (Tr. 28.)
Applicant testified that he remarried in December 2019. (Tr. 22.) However, when
he updated his personal information with his employer in February 2019, he informed his
supervisor that he married in December 2018, not 2019. He also reported that his wife
holds  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  microbiology,  and  a  master’s  degree  in  business
administration, and that she was working at the United Nations Educational, Scientific,
and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in Amman, Jordan. (AX V.) Applicant and his wife
currently live in his daughter’s apartment in Jordan. (Tr. 41.)
Applicant sponsored his wife for a spouse’s green card. (Tr. 38.) She submitted
her application in July 2019. Her application reflects that she is 32 years old; that she is
a native of Iraq; that her city and country of last residence is Amman, Jordan; that her
occupation  is  business,  management,  and  marketing;  and  her  address  in  the  United
States is Applicant’s home in the United States. (AX T.) She received her spouse visa in
October 2019. (AX DD at 1.) She has a permanent resident card reflecting her residence
in the United States since November 2019. (AX DD at 2.) She also holds a U.S. Social
Security Card. (AX S.) Applicant testified that his wife has applied for U.S. citizenship, but
he submitted no documentation reflecting a citizenship application. (Tr. 76-77.)
Applicant’s wife had been employed by UNESCO as a human resources specialist
for six or seven years when they met, but she is no longer employed outside the home.
(Tr. 37-38.) They knew each other for about a year before they married. (Tr. 36.) Before
Applicant’s wife moved to Jordan, she lived in the UAE and was involved in a real estate
business.
Applicant’s wife’s father is deceased. Her mother was a teacher in a private school
in Iraq and is now retired. Her uncle is a shopkeeper in Iraq. The record does not reflect
whether she has siblings. (Tr. 38-39.)
Applicant’s father owns a one-fourth share of an aluminum factory in Iraq. It was
worth  about  $6  million  many  years  ago  but  it  has  been  vacant  for  about  20  years,  is
dilapidated,  and is now worth about $2 million.  (Tr. 26; AX W.) His father also owns a
one-thirteenth  share  of  an  apartment  building  in  Iraq.  Applicant  estimates  that  the
apartment building is worth about $700,000, (Tr. 28.) Applicant has a potential inheritance
from his father that he would share with his brother, sister, and mother.
Applicant’s 20-year-old daughter was born in Jordan. She is a U.S. citizen by virtue
of Applicant’s U.S. citizenship and has resided in the United States for about three years.
(Tr. 18.). She completed high school in Jordan and is currently attending college in the
United States. (GX 8 at 12; AX F.) Applicant’s brother was born in the United Kingdom
and is a citizen and resident of the United States. (AX G.) His sister was born in Iraq, is a
dual  citizen  of  the  United  Kingdom  and  the  United  States,  and  resides  in  the  United
Kingdom. (AX M.)
Applicant testified that he does not consider his first wife’s parents or siblings as
in-laws, because she passed away in June 2005, more than 15 years ago. (Tr. 24.) His
former  mother-in-law  is  a  citizen  and  resident  of  Iraq,  who  was  the  headmistress  of  a
school, employed by the Iraq Ministry of Education, until she retired more than 25 years
ago. (GX 7 at 1; GX 8 at 13.) Applicant’s last contact with his former mother-in-law was
three or four years ago. (Tr. 22.)
Applicant’s former father-in-law was a citizen and resident of Iraq who worked as
a  lawyer  for  the  Iraq  Ministry  of  Oil,  the  Iraq  Ministry  of  Health,  and  for  the  Kurdish
government in Iraq until he retired about 15 years ago. (GX 7 at 1; GX 8 at 13.) He is
deceased. (Tr. 21.)
Applicant’s former brother-in-law and two sisters-in-law are citizens of Iraq residing
in the UAE. (The SOR alleges only one sister but does not identify which one.) His former
brother-in-law is a chemical engineer employed by a utility company. (GX 6 at 4.) One of
his former sisters-in-law is a dentist in the UAE. Applicant believes that she is a citizen of
Canada.  (GX  8  at  18.)  The  other  former  sister-in-law  works  for  a  U.S.-based  federal
contractor. (GX 6 at 4; GX 7 at 1; GX 8 at 18.) Applicant’s last contact with his former
brother-in-law and sisters-in-law was three or four years ago. (Tr. 22.)
When Applicant submitted his SCA, he had a bank account in Jordan worth about
$10,000. He closed the account about two years ago. (Tr. 25; AX K.) He has two bank
accounts  in the  United States  totaling about  $128,000  and a retirement  account  worth
about $4,000. (Tr. 52-53; AX X.)
When Applicant began working in Jordan for his current employer, he obtained a
Jordanian residence card so that he would not overstay his visa. It expired in November
2019. (AX I.) He now has a Jordanian work visa. (Tr. 28-29.) He also obtained a Jordanian
driver’s  license,  which  he  has  retained  so  that  he  can  legally  drive  in  Jordan.  He  will
surrender his residence card when he stops working in Jordan. (Tr. 29.)
Administrative Notice—Iraq
Iraq is a constitutional parliamentary republic. The 2014 parliamentary elections
generally  met  international  standards  for  free  and  fair  elections.  Iraq’s  security  forces
include the regular armed forces and domestic law enforcement agencies; the Popular
Mobilization Forces (PMF), a state-sponsored military organization composed of nearly
60  predominantly  Shia  components;  and  the  Peshmerga,  the  Iraqi  Kurdistan  Regional
Government’s principal military force. Civilian authorities are not always able to maintain
effective control of all security forces.
The United States is committed to building a strategic partnership with Iraq. Iraq is
a key partner for the United States in the region and a voice of moderation and democracy
in the Middle East. It has a functioning government, is playing a constructive role in the
region, and has a bright economic future. The United States maintains vigorous and broad
engagement with Iraq on diplomatic, political, economic, and security issues. None of the
administrative  notice  documents  indicate  that  government  of  Iraq  targets  the  United
States for economic or military intelligence, although it is likely that various terrorist and
insurgent groups seek military intelligence regarding U.S. military units operating in Iraq.
Numerous terrorist and insurgent  groups are active in  Iraq, including ISIS and  anti-
U.S. sectarian militias.  The  U.S. government considers the potential  security threats to
U.S. personnel sufficiently serious to require them  to  live and  work under strict  security
conditions. The  U.S. Department of States warns U.S. citizens against all travel  to Iraq
because it is extremely dangerous.
The U.S. Department of State has substantiated reports of human rights abuses
in Iraq, including a climate of violence; misappropriation of authority by sectarian, criminal,
and  insurgent  groups;  arbitrary  killings;  torture;  and  other  cruel,  inhuman  or  degrading
treatment or punishment. The Iraqi government’s effectiveness in adhering to the rule of
law is hampered by ongoing violence, corruption, sectarian bias, and lack of oversight
and  accountability.  Treatment  of  detainees  has  been  generally  poor.  The  judiciary  is
weak,  and  judicial  independence  is  impaired  by  threats  and  killings  by  insurgent,
sectarian, tribal, and criminal elements. Impunity is widespread. Security threats hinder
civilians’ access to the courts, and witness intimidation is common.
The  Visa  Waiver  Program  Improvement  and  Terrorist  Travel  Prevention  Act  of
2015  amended  the  existing  Visa  Waiver  Program,  which  permitted  citizens  of  certain
countries to travel to the United States for business or tourism for up to 90 days without
a visa. (Public Law 114-113, attached as Item X in HX I.) The amendment made citizens
of Iraq ineligible to travel to or be admitted to the United States under the Visa Waiver
Program.
EO 13769, issued on January 27, 2017, directed a comprehensive review of the
process of issuing entry visas, suspended entry into the United States by aliens of certain
countries, including Iraq, for 90 days, suspended refugee visas for 120 days, and directed
the Secretary of Homeland Security, in consultation with the Secretary of State, to compile
a list of countries for inclusion in a Presidential proclamation that would prohibit entry into
the United States by aliens from those countries.
EO  13780,  issued  on  March  6,  2017,  revoked  EO  13769  and  reviewed  the
information  about  seven  countries  whose  nationals  were  previously  identified  as
presenting  heightened  risks  to  the  security  of  the  United  States:  Iran,  Libya,  Somalia,
Sudan, Syria, Yemen, and Iran. EO 13769 recognized that Iraq presented a special case
that justified different treatment, based on the close cooperative relationship between the
United States and the democratically elected Iraqi government, the strong United States
diplomatic presence in Iraq, the significant presence of United States forces in Iraq, and
Iraq’s  commitment  to  combat  ISS.  EO  13769  requires  additional  inquiries  for  an
application by any Iraqi for a visa, including consultation with a designee of the Secretary
of Defense and use of additional information about Iraq that has been obtained since the
issuance of EO 13769. The additional inquiry must include whether an application has
connections  with  ISIS  or  other  terrorist  organizations  and  individuals  coming  from
territories  controlled  or  formerly  controlled  by  ISIS  as  well  as  any  other  information
bearing on whether the applicant may be a threat to commit acts of terrorism or otherwise
threaten the national security or public safety of the United States.
Administrative Notice—Jordan
The Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan (Jordan) is a constitutional monarchy ruled by
King Abdullah II bin Hussein. In 2013 and 2014, the United States provided Jordan $2.25
billion  in  loan  guarantees,  allowing  Jordan  access  to  affordable  financing  from
international  capital  markets.  The  U.S.-Jordan  free  trade  agreement  (FTA),  the  United
States’ first FTA with an Arab country, has expanded the trade relationship by reducing
barriers for services, providing cutting-edge protection for intellectual property, ensuring
regulatory  transparency,  and  requiring  effective  labor  and  environmental  enforcement.
The United States and Jordan have an “open skies” civil aviation agreement; a bilateral
investment treaty; a science and technology cooperation agreement; and a memorandum
of understanding on nuclear energy cooperation. Such agreements bolster efforts to help
diversify Jordan’s economy and promote growth. Jordan and the United States belong to
a  number  of  the  same  international  organizations,  including  the  United  Nations,
International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and World Trade Organization. Jordan also is
a Partner for Cooperation with the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
The United States deeply values its long history of cooperation and friendship with
Jordan,  with  which  it  established  diplomatic  relations  in  1949.  The  United  States
appreciates the leadership role that Jordan plays in advancing peace and moderation in
the region. The United States and Jordan share the mutual goals of a comprehensive,
just,  and  lasting  peace  between  Israel  and  the  Palestinians,  and  an  end  to  violent
extremism  that  threatens  the  security  of  Jordan,  the  region,  and  the  entire  globe.  The
peace  process  and  Jordan’s  opposition  to  terrorism  parallel  and  assist  wider  U.S.
interests.  U.S.  policy  seeks  to  reinforce  Jordan’s  commitment  to  peace,  stability,  and
moderation. In light of ongoing regional unrest, as well as global disruptions stemming
from the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States has helped Jordan maintain its stability
and  prosperity  through  economic  and  military  assistance  and  through  close  political
cooperation.
The  U.S.  Department  of  State  travel  advisory  for  Jordan  is  Level  2  (“Exercise
Increased  Caution  due  to  Terrorism).  The  capital  of  Amman  is  currently  assessed  as
being at considerable risk from terrorism. Transnational and indigenous terrorist groups
in  Jordan  have  demonstrated  the  capability  to  plan  and  implement  attacks.  Violent
extremist groups in Syria and Iraq have conducted attacks in Jordan and continue to plot
against local security forces, U.S. and Western interests, and soft targets such as high-
profile public events, hotels, places of worship, restaurants, schools, and malls. Jordan’s
prominent  role  in  the  effort  to  defeat  ISIS,  and  its  shared  borders  with  Iraq  and  Syria,
increase the potential for future terrorist incidents.
Administrative Notice—United Arab Emirates (UAE)
The UAE is a federation of monarchies consisting of seven emirates. The rulers of
the emirates constitute the Federal Supreme Council, the country’s highest legislative and
executive body. The emirates are under patriarchal rule with political allegiance defined
by loyalty to tribal leaders, leaders of individual emirates, and leaders of the federation.
The United States has had friendly relations with the UAE since its formation in 1971. The
UAE has an influential role in the Middle East and is a key partner for the United States.
The two countries enjoy strong bilateral cooperation on many issues, including defense.
UAE ports host more U.S. Navy ships than anywhere else outside the United States.
The  UAE  is  a  regional  and  global  financial  and  transportation  hub,  and  terrorist
organizations exploit it send and receive financial support. It is a drug-transshipment point
for  illegal  traffickers  and  its  position  as  a  major  financial  center  makes  it  vulnerable  to
money  laundering.  There  have  been  numerous  instances  in  which  U.S.  dual-use  and
military components have been shipped to Iran, Iraq, and Afghanistan through the UAE,
using methods making it appear that UAE was the final destination.
The  U.S.  Department  of  State  regards  two  emirates,  Abu  Dhabi  and  Dubai,  as
medium-threat  locations  for  terrorist  activity  directed  at  or  affecting  U.S.  Government
interests. The UAE’s participation in the anti-ISIS coalition and the Yemen civil war has
increased the likelihood of terrorist attacks against Western interests.
The  UAE  vigorously  monitors  suspected  terrorists,  prosecutes  individuals  for
terrorism-related  offenses,  collaborates  with  U.S.  law  enforcement  on counterterrorism
cases, and has foiled terrorist attacks within its borders.
The UAE maintains effective control over its security forces. The most significant
human-rights issues have involved allegations of torture in detention, arbitrary arrest and
detention,  government  interference  with  privacy  rights,  restrictions  on  assembly  and
association,  and  the  inability  of  citizens  to  choose  their  government  in  free  and  fair
elections.
Administrative Notice, Presidential Memorandum
The Presidential Memorandum outlines the President’s commitment to revitalizing
our  national  security  and  foreign  policy  workforce  and  institutions  and  renewal  of  the
commitment of our institutions to the American public. It creates an Interagency Working
Group  on  the  National  Security  Workforce,  chaired  by  the  Principal  Deputy  National
Security Advisor. It requires a survey of all hiring authorities that exist to recruit individuals
with  critical  skills,  including  critical  language  skills  and  regional  expertise,  and  seeks
recommendations for legislative or executive action to enhance recruitment of experts.
",True
"Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  Guideline  B  allegations  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.e)  and
included  a  narrative  statement  with  his  Answer.  His  admissions  and  other  comments
are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  now  53  years  old.  He  was  born  in  India.  He  graduated  from  high
school in India in 1987, and attended two years of college there, earning an associate’s
degree. (Tr. 42, 56-57; GE 1) He and his wife have three grown children. His wife and
children are now U.S. citizens and residents.
From  1986  until  2008,  Applicant  was  employed  at  a  United  States  consulate  in
India  as  a  local  employee.  He  started  working  in  the  mailroom  and  later  became  a
contracting agent. (Tr. 51) He was not a U.S. State Department employee, and does not
receive  a  State  Department  pension  for  this  work.  He  receives  a  minimal  pension  of
about $20 a month through an Indian insurance company. (Tr. 42-43, 45, 54-55, 59-61,
111-112)  This  was  confirmed  by  Mr.  H,  Applicant’s  character  witness,  a  retired  State
Department employee. (Tr. 117-118)
In  2008,  Applicant  was  granted  a  Special  Immigrant  (SI)  Visa  by  the  U.S.
Ambassador to India. Several witnesses testified that granting of such a visa is rare and
is  a  testament  to  Applicant’s  character  and  value  to  the  United  States.  (Tr.  42-43,  45,
54,  123-124)  SI  Visas  are  granted  to  those  who  have  been  “exceptionally  loyal  and
[who] would have provided exceptional service to the U.S. Government.” (Tr. 120)
Applicant and his wife married in India in 1991. (Tr. 58) Their three children are
all in their 20s. They were all born in India. (GE 1) They immigrated to the United States
in 2008. Applicant testified that he came to the United States “for the betterment of my
children.” (Tr. 62) His children all live at home. His son works in information technology.
One  daughter  recently  graduated  from  college  and  is  now  a  teacher.  His  younger
daughter is in college. (Tr. 46-48, 58-59; GE 1)
Applicant  became  a  U.S.  citizen  in  2013.  He  is  not  a  dual  citizen,  though  as  a
native of India, he maintains an Indian overseas identification card. (Tr. 62-65).
From  2008  until  2011,  Applicant  worked  at  a  large  retailer  and  later  at  a
pharmacy in the U.S. Since 2011, he has worked for State Department contractors as a
project  manager.  (Tr.  65-67,  102-104;  GE  1)  In  2015,  he  was  granted  eligibility  for  a
position  of  public  trust  and  eligibility  for  access  to  sensitive  U.S.  Government
information, as Department Counsel confirmed after the hearing. (Answer, Tr. 67, 102;
HE 3) Applicant now seeks a security clearance. (GE 1)
Applicant’s  father  worked  for  35  years  (1951-1986)  as  a  local  employee  at  the
same U.S. consulate in India where Applicant later worked. (AE A) Applicant’s father is
now  deceased.  Applicant’s  widowed  mother,  age  84,  lives  in  India.  (SOR  ¶  1.a)  She
never worked outside the home. She receives a pension from the U.S. Government due
to her husband’s career at the consulate as a State Department employee. (Tr. 35-43,
45,  49,  52-53,  56,  73-74,  110-112)  (Mr.  H  testified  that  State  Department  regulations
changed  in  the  1980s,  which  is  why  Applicant’s  father  was  considered  a  retired  State
Department  employee  entitled  to  a  U.S.  Government  pension,  while  Applicant  is  not).
Applicant  testified  that  he  talks  to  his  mother  by  phone  about  once  a  week.  He  sends
her about $500 a year. (GE 1; Answer; Tr. 74-75)
SOR  ¶  1.b  concerns  two  of  Applicant’s  brothers  (B1  and  B2)  and  three  of  his
sisters (S1, S4, and S5). All of these siblings are Indian citizens, and all but one of them
reside there.
B1 is a citizen and resident of India. He works for an oil company. He is married
and has children. Applicant talks to B1 about once or twice a month. (Tr. 75-76; GE 1)
B2 is an Indian citizen, but he lives in Dubai, where he works as a mechanic. Applicant
speaks with B2 a few times a year, on religious holidays. (Tr. 77, 107-108; GE 1)
S1 (born in 1960) lives in a large city in India. She is widowed. Applicant speaks
with her on about a quarterly basis. (Tr. 77-78; GE 1)
S4 is a citizen and resident of India. In 1965, when S4 was born, her mother was
travelling in Pakistan, and was unable to return to India, as the two countries were then
briefly  at  war.  S4  is  not  a  citizen  of  Pakistan.  S4  is  widowed.  Applicant  speaks  to  her
quarterly. (Tr. 78-80, 107)
S5  is  a  housewife  in  a  large  city  in  India.  Her  husband  works  in  construction.
Applicant speaks to S5 about every few months. (Tr. 80-81; GE 1)
Applicant  has  two  other  sisters,  both  of  whom  are  citizens  and  residents  of
Pakistan. (SOR ¶ 1.c) S2 (born in 1962) and S3 (born in 1964) were born in India, but
are now citizens and residents of Pakistan because they married two Pakistani brothers
who  were  friends  of  the  family  of  Applicant’s  father  in  Pakistan.  Applicant  contacts  S2
and  S3  about  every  six  months.  One  of  their  husbands  works  as  contractor  at  a
shipyard.  The  husband  of  the  other  sister  is  deceased.  (Tr.  82-87,  107-108;  GE  1)
There is no indication in the record that Applicant has ever travelled to Pakistan to visit
them. (Tr. 94)
SOR  ¶  1.e  alleges  that  Applicant  provides  about  $1,600  in  annual  financial
support to some of his family members in India and Pakistan. Applicant testified that he
has  also  sent  some  money  to  his  wife’s  family  members  when  they  have  been  out  of
work in the past. (Tr. 87-93)
SOR  ¶  1.d  alleges  that  Applicant  has  “several  friends  and  associates  who  are
citizens  of  India.”  SOR  ¶  1.d  does  not  describe  or  suggest  any specific  person  or  any
bond of affection or obligation (or even a level of contact Applicant might have with such
a person that might suggest such a bond). Nor is it alleged that any of these unspecified
persons are currently residing in India. Applicant “admitted” SOR ¶ 1.d in his Answer but
did not specifically address any such “friends and associates” either in his Answer or in
his testimony other than to note that he has Indian friends who worked with him at the
consulate. (Tr. 50-51)
Since coming to the United States in 2008, Applicant has returned to India twice.
In  2014,  he  travelled  there  with  his  wife  and  children  after  his  mother-in-law  passed
away.  He  also  travelled  to  India  with  his  family  in  2019.  He  saw  (and  stayed  with)  his
mother and his siblings in India. He did not travel to Pakistan. (Tr. 93-94, 98-100)
During  the  period  when  he  worked  as  a  local  employee  at  the  U.S.  consulate,
Applicant  was  subject  to  routine  background  investigations.  On  occasion,  like  other
such employees, he was harassed by local entities. At the time, the Indian state where
the consulate was located was subject to Communist influence. According to Mr. H, this
is  no  longer  the  case.  (Tr.  95-98,  108-109)  Applicant  disclosed  these  incidents  of
harassment and attempts at exploitation and duress to embassy authorities, as he had
been  trained  to  do.  (Answer;  Tr.  97-98)  Mr.  H  testified  the  consulate  had  a  system  in
place to protect its local employees from local harassment. (Tr. 126)
Applicant has a $73,000 annual salary. (Tr. 104; AE E) He and his wife own their
home, which they purchased in 2017, and they have ample financial assets in the U.S.
(Tr. 69-72) He holds no assets in India. (Tr. 67) His wife owns two undeveloped parcels
of property outside of the city in India where she grew up. They have little value. (Tr. 68-
69, 105-106; GE 1; AE E)
Applicant’s  character  witnesses  included  a  current  United  States  ambassador
and two former U.S. consul generals, as well as several other current and former U.S.
Foreign Service officers and State Department employees. All of them knew or worked
with  Applicant  at  the  U.S.  Consulate  in  India  when  Applicant  worked  there  as  a  local
employee. Some of them have maintained more recent contact with Applicant.
Mr. H is retired from the State Department after 42 years of service. He is now a
State Department contractor. (Tr. 115-116; AE B) Mr. H worked at the consulate in India
from the early 1990s to 2001 and supervised Applicant there.  He attested that  he and
the  Applicant’s  character  witnesses  were  “without  exception”  impressed  by  his  loyalty
and  integrity  and  that  Applicant  was  universally  held  in  high  regard,  and  was  highly
trusted. (Tr. 119-125)
Mr. H also testified that any local employee is subject to a background check with
local  police  forces  and  through  U.S.  intelligence.  There  are  also  stringent  reporting
requirements,  as  well  as  a  “zero  tolerance”  policy  for  all  local  embassy  employees.
Applicant  followed  all  reporting  rules  appropriately  when  he  was  at  the  consulate.  (Tr.
127)  Mr.  H.  closed  his  testimony  by  affirming  that,  “If  I  did  not  believe  absolutely  in
[Applicant’s]  judgment,  trustworthiness,  and  reliability,  I  wouldn’t  be  here  today.”  (Tr.
128)
W1  is  a  current  State  Department  employee.  She  knew  Applicant  at  the
consulate  (2005-2008).  She  has  had  some  contact  with  him  at  State  Department
headquarters  in  more  recent  times.  She  offered  a  strong  endorsement  of  Applicant’s
character and loyalty, while recognizing that Applicant cares for his family in India. (Tr.
131-138; AE B)
W2 is retired from both the State Department and the U.S. Navy. He worked with
Applicant  at  the  consulate  from  2002  to  2005.  (AE  B)  He  attested  to  Applicant’s
attention  to  detail  and  dedication  to  the  United  States.  He  said  Applicant’s  “overall
performance  and  his  overall  attitude  was  one  that  I  wish  others  would  emulate.  .  .  .  I
don’t  think you  could  ask  for  a  more  trusted  person to  be  doing  what  he’s  doing.”  (Tr.
138-143)
W3  was  the  consul  general  at  the  consulate  in  India  (the  senior  U.S.  foreign-
service  officer  on  post)  during  a  period  when  Applicant  was  there.  She  attested  to
Applicant’s  diligence,  competence,  and  trustworthiness  under  difficult  circumstances.
Applicant provided valuable service to the U.S. mission in India in getting information on
threats  in  the  region  at  the  time.  W3  stated  that  “there  are  few  persons  in  the  greater
universe of the U.S. Mission throughout India who deserved a Special Immigrant Visa”
and she strongly endorsed Applicant’s eligibility for a clearance. (Tr. 143-147; AE B)
W4  was  also  a consul  general  at  the  consulate  in  India  during the period  when
Applicant was there. W4 remains employed by the State Department as a “Diplomat in
Residence.” He testified that Applicant was one of the best employees at the consulate.
He  maintained  a  positive  attitude,  and  was  always  thorough  and  diligent.  He  was  a
leader  among  the  Muslim  employees  at  the  consulate  and  worked  to  ensure  a
harmonious  relationship  among  local  religious  groups  there  (Christian,  Hindu,  and
Muslim).  Applicant  is  a  dedicated  family  man,  and  his  family  connections  in  India  and
Pakistan do not detract from his loyalty to the United States. (Tr. 148-153; AE B)
Applicant’s  final  witness,  W5,  is  a  current  U.S.  Ambassador.  He  testified  by
phone from his post overseas. He is a career State Department foreign-service officer.
He knew Applicant at the consulate, and they have kept in casual touch since their time
there.  W5  noted  that  Applicant’s  judgment,  conduct,  and  suitability  were  never  in
question  during  the  time  they  worked  together.  He  offered  a  strong  recommendation.
(Tr. 169-174; AE B)
I also considered the reference letters of the character witnesses who testified at
the hearing, as well as the letters from those who did not. They all offered similar, and
strong,  endorsements  of  Applicant’s  character,  value  to  the  United  States,  judgment,
trustworthiness, reliability, and overall suitability to hold a clearance. (AE B)
Republic of India (India): (AN I)
The  Republic  of  India  (India)  is  a  multiparty,  federal,  parliamentary  democracy
with a bicameral legislature. The president is the head of state, and the prime minister is
the  head  of  government.  India  has  a  history  of  economic  and  industrial  espionage
against  the  United  States.  In  its  administrative  notice  filing,  the  Government  provided
several examples of criminal cases brought in recent years by the U.S. Department of
Justice concerning export enforcement relating to India.
The  State  Department  has issued  a  “Do Not  Travel”  warning  (Level  4)  for  India
due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and a warning that travelers to India should “Exercise
Increased Caution” (Level 2) due to “crime and terrorism.”
India  continues  to  experience  terrorist  and  insurgent  activities  that  may  affect
U.S.  citizens  directly  or  indirectly.  Anti-Western  terrorist  groups,  some  on  the  U.S.
government's list of foreign terrorist organizations, are active in India, including Islamist
extremist  groups  such  as  Harkat-ul-Jihad-i-Islami,  Harakat  ul-Mujahidin,
Indian
Mujahideen,  Jaish-e-Mohammed,  and  Lashkar-e  Tayyiba.  Past  attacks  have  targeted
public  places,  including  some  frequented  by  Westerners,  such  as  luxury  and  other
hotels, trains, train stations, markets, cinemas, mosques, and restaurants in large urban
areas.  Attacks  have  taken  place  during  the  busy  evening  hours  in  markets  and  other
crowded places, but could occur at any time. Attacks are usually more frequent around
major holidays. The Maoists (also known as “Naxalites”) are the most active insurgent
group in India. The Naxalites typically attack Indian government officials, but have also
derailed  trains,  targeted  government  buildings,  such  as police  stations, and  conducted
other criminal activity.
According  to  the  U.S.  Department  of  State,  the  most  significant  human  rights
problems  in  India  during  2019  included  unlawful  and  arbitrary  killings,  extrajudicial
killings perpetrated by police; torture by prison officials; arbitrary arrest and detention by
government  authorities;  harsh  and  life-threatening  prison  conditions;  political  prisoners
in certain states; restrictions on freedom of expression and the press; frequent reports
of  widespread  corruption  at  all  levels  of  government;  violence  and  discrimination
targeting  minorities  based  on  religious  affiliation  or  social  status;  and  forced  and
compulsory labor including bonded labor. A lack of accountability for official misconduct
persisted at all levels of government, contributing to widespread impunity. Corruption is
present at all levels of government.

The Islamic Republic of Pakistan (Pakistan): (AN II)
Pakistan  is  a  federal  parliamentary  republic.  The  prime  minister  is  head  of
government, and the president is head of state. The country has endured direct military
rule  for  nearly  half  of  its  time  as  an  independent  nation.  The  United  States  has  had
diplomatic  relations  with  Pakistan  since  Pakistan’s  creation  in  1947.  Their  relationship
has  been  guided  by  their  common  interests  in  a  peaceful,  stable,  and  prosperous
region.
The  U.S.  State  Department  advises  American  citizens  to  reconsider  travel  to
Pakistan (Level 3) due to COVID-19, the risk of terrorism, and sectarian violence. The
United  States  remains  concerned  about  the  continued  presence  of  terrorist  and  other
extremist  groups  in  Pakistan.  Terrorist  groups  continue  plotting  attacks  in  Pakistan.  A
local  history  of  terrorism  and  ongoing  ideological  aspirations  of  violence  by  extremist
elements  have  led  to  indiscriminate  attacks  on  civilian  as  well  as  local  military  and
police  targets.  Terrorists  may  attack  with  little  or  no  warning,  targeting  transportation
hubs,  markets,  shopping  malls,  military  installations,  airports,  universities,  tourist
locations,  schools,  hospitals,  places  of  worship,  and  government  facilities.  Terrorists
have targeted U.S. diplomats and diplomatic facilities in the past.
The State Department’s most recent human-rights report on Pakistan reflects the
reported  commission  of  human  rights  violations  by  elements  within  Pakistan  and  the
Pakistani  government.  The  most  serious  human-rights  problems  in  Pakistan  include
extrajudicial  and  targeted  killings,  disappearances,  torture,  the  lack  of  rule  of  law,  and
sectarian  violence.  Government  corruption  is  a  serious  problem,  and  the  lack  of
accountability and failure to prosecute these abuses has led to a culture of impunity.

"Applicant  is  36  years  old  and  is  married  with  children.  He  has  an  Associate
degree in Criminal Justice.  He is employed with a defense contractor as a linguist.  He
is seeking to retain a security clearance in connection with his employment.
Guideline B –  Foreign Influence
Applicant  was  born  in  Kabul,  Afghanistan.  At  the  age  of  six,  he  moved  to
Pakistan  where  he  lived  for  about  ten  years.  He  then  moved  to  the  United  States  in
2001, where he lived with his brother and grandfather.  He went to college and obtained
a degree.  In 2011, Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen.  He married in 2005.
His wife is a naturalized U.S. citizen.  They have three native-born American children.
Applicant began working for the Defense Department, and served two successful
tours  as  a  linguist  alongside  U.S.  forces  in combat  zones  in  2011  and  2013.  He  was
also deployed overseas for a period in 2019.  He has outstanding references from his
previous  mission  assignment  demonstrating  outstanding  competence  on  all  levels.
Applicant was hired by his current employer in April 2019, and is currently applying for
an upgraded linguist position, requiring a security clearance.
In 2011, Applicant’s   mother, father and sister all resided in and were citizens of
Afghanistan.  Applicant  denies  these  allegations  in  response  to  the  SOR  under  this
guideline,  as  situations  have  changed.  Applicant’s   parents  are  now   both  naturalized
U.S.  citizens,  and  they  live  in  the  United  States.  Applicant’s  mother   became  a
naturalized  U.S.  citizen  in  March  2019.  Applicant  provided  a  copy  of  her  valid  U.S.
passport.  (Applicant’s  Exhibit  A.)  Since  December  2019,  Applicant’s  father  is  also  a
naturalized  U.S.  citizen.  Prior  to  moving  to  the  United  States,  Applicant’s   father   was
employed  as a Police Officer in Afghanistan.  He is now retired.  Applicant  provided a
copy of his father’s certificate of U.S. naturalization.  (Applicant’s Exhibit A.)  Applicant’s
sister, who at one time was a resident and citizen of Afghanistan, is now a citizen of the
Netherlands, where she currently resides.  Applicant provided a copy of her Netherlands
passport.  (Applicant’s Exhibit A.)
During  his  security  clearance  background  investigation,  Applicant  was  asked  if
he will inherit any property in Afghanistan.  (Government Exhibit 5.)  Applicant testified
that  he  no  longer  stands  to  inherit  property  owned  by  his  father  or  anyone  else  in
Afghanistan.  His  father  is  currently  in  good  health.  Applicant  further  testified  that  the
value  of  any  property  owned  by  his  father  in  Afghanistan  is  insignificant  compared  to
what Applicant owns in the United States.  Applicant states that he will not lay claim to
any  property  in  any  foreign  country.  Furthermore,  Applicant  has  no  interest  in  ever
moving back to Afghanistan to live or retire.  (Tr. p. 47.)
Guideline F –  Financial Considerations
Applicant  is  indebted  to  ten  creditors  listed  in  the  SOR,  totaling  approximately
$100,000. He admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this guideline,
except  allegations  1.a,  and  1.j.  His  financial  distress  began  in  about  November  or
December 2015.  At that time he was not earning sufficient monies to pay his bills.  His
wife  owned  a  rental  property  in  a  location  that  encountered  a  gas  leak  and  ultimately
caused  the  tenants  to  move.  Applicant’s  wife  was  pregnant  with  their  second  child.
Applicant  had  just  started  renovating  their  primary  residence.  The  snowball  effect  of
this  situation  caused  many  of  his  financial  troubles.  Credit  reports  of  the  Applicant
dated  October  13,  2018;  August  21,  2019;  March  10,  2020;  and  November  11,  2020,
confirm this indebtedness.  (Government Exhibits 7, 8, 9, and 11.)
The following debts became delinquent and are of security significance:  2.a.  A
mortgage  account  was  past  due  in  the  amount  of  $34,683  with  a  total  balance  of
$325,940.  2.b.  A  debt  owed  to  a  creditor  in  the  amount  of  $36,244  was  also
delinquent.  2.c.  A debt owed to a creditor was charged off in the amount of $18,810.
2.d.  A debt owed to a creditor was charged off in the amount of $16,553.  2.e.  A debt
owed  to  a  creditor  was  placed  for  collection  in  the  amount  of  $14,375.  Applicant
believes  the  debt  has  been  settled  but  provides  no  documentary  evidence  to  support
this assertion.  (Tr. p. 61.)  2.f.  A debt owed to a creditor was placed for collection in the
amount of $9,967.  2.g.  A debt was owed to a creditor was charged off in the amount of
$3,181.  2.h.  A debt owed to a creditor was charged off in the amount of $2,132.  2.i.  A
debt owed to a creditor was charged off in the amount of $1,087.  2.j.  A judgment was
entered against the Applicant in 2018 in the amount of $3,168.  This debt has been paid
in full.  (Applicant’s Exhibit C, and Government Exhibits 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11.)
Applicant  explained  that  his  mortgage  fell  in  arrears,  and  a  number  of  credit
cards became delinquent.  Since then, Applicant has brought his mortgage to a current
status,  and  he  is  steadily  reducing  his  HOA  indebtedness.  (Applicant’s  Exhibit  B.)  In
January  2017,  to  avoid  foreclosure,  Applicant  hired  a  credit  repair  company  to  assist
him in resolving his delinquent debt.  (Applicant’s Exhibit B.)  At that time, they set up a
financial  plan  that  illuminated  non-necessary  expenditures  and  focused  on  his  most
important  debts  first.  Applicant  started  the  plan,  and  he  believes  that  he  made
significant headway, but was unable to complete it due to another unexpected financial
hit.
Since April 2019, Applicant has been gainfully employed.  (Applicant’s Exhibit F.)
He  states  that  he  has  tried  to  resolve  his  delinquent  debt,  but  has  encountered
difficulties.  To  avoid  bankruptcy,  in  November  2019,  Applicant  hired  another  debt
management company.  (Applicant’s Exhibit D.)  He states that this company has been
helpful.  He believes that they are negotiating with the creditors to reduce the amount of
the  debts  owed.  (Tr.  p.  59.)  He  also  stated  that  they  have  been  placed  him  on  a
payment plan to avoid Bankruptcy.  (Applicant’s Response  to SOR.)  However, due to
the  pandemic,  from  March  through  July  2020,  as  Applicant  has  been  on  leave  from
work,  awaiting  his  security  clearance  hearing,  he  has  not  had  the  money  to  pay  his
past-due debts.  He states that he received a salary from his employer until July 2020.
Given the circumstances, Applicant has been unable to resolve his debts.
Applicant states that he intends to resolve each of the delinquent debts listed in
the  SOR.  Applicant  contends  that  some  of  the  debts  listed  in  the  SOR  are  no  longer
owing,  as  they  are  old  debts,  and  were  incurred  before  he  worked  for  the  Defense
Department,  and  are  no  longer  showing  delinquent  on  his  credit  report.  (Applicant’s
Exhibit  G.)  Other  debts  listed  in  the  SOR  are  still  owing,  and  he  plans  to  pay  them
when he has the money to do so.
Letters  of  recommendation  from  military  and  professional  associates  of  the
Applicant  indicate  that  he  is  considered  to  be  an  outstanding  linguist.  He  has
consistently  demonstrated  “exceptional  linguist  skills  and  cultural  expertise,  as  well  as
loyalty  and  dedication  to  the  U.S.  and  their  missions  in  his  position,  both  on  and  off
duty.”  Applicant’s  linguist  capabilities  and  cultural  expertise  have  allowed  military
missions to achieve great headway with Afghan partners.  Moreover, Applicant is said to
have  been  resilient  despite  the  tragedies  of  war  he  has  experienced.  He  is  highly
recommended for a security clearance.  (Applicant’s Exhibit E.)
I  have  taken  administrative  notice  of  the  following  information  concerning  the
country  of  Afghanistan,  which  include  the  Government’s  briefs  and   supportive
documents on the country of Afghanistan. In 2001, the United States led a coalition to
remove  the  Taliban  from  power  in  Afghanistan.  Afghanistan  remains  an  important
partner with the United States in the fight against terrorism, and has been designated a
Major Non-NATO Ally. However, numerous attacks and kidnappings have targeted the
U.S.  Armed  Forces,  contractors,  and  other  civilians,  as  well  as  Afghans.  Even  with
aggressive governmental action against terrorists, the threat of terrorism in Afghanistan
remains  high.  Terrorist  groups  conduct  intelligence  activities  as  effectively  as  state
intelligence  services.  In  summary,  Afghanistan  provides  a  significant  and  heightened
security risk to the United States.

"Applicant admitted the three SOR allegations: ¶ 1.a (that his wife is a citizen of
Thailand);  and  ¶¶  1.b  and  1.c  (that  her  parents  are  citizen-residents  of  Thailand).  He
denied; however, that this case presents a credible Guideline B concern. Applicant’s SOR
admissions and those at his hearing are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a
thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant, 41, was born and raised in Albania. He immigrated to the United States
in November 1999, at age 20, and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in November 2006.
His parents also immigrated to the United States and became naturalized U.S. citizens.
His father passed away, but his mother resides in the United States.  He has a brother
who is a citizen-resident of Albania.
Applicant  graduated  from  high  school  and  completed  some  college  courses  in
Albania. He received  an associate’s degree in  2013, and a bachelor’s degree in  2015,
both from U.S. academic institutions.  He worked while attending  college to pay for his
education, and at some point, opened his own business. After receiving his bachelor’s
degree  in  2015,  he started  working for  his  current  employer  and  clearance  sponsor,  a
federal contractor. (GE 1, Tr. 43-44, 85)
Applicant has done well in his position, and has been promoted several times. He
is the  team lead developer  for  an important project, and has received commendations
from his employer and clients for his excellent performance. He is currently a senior data
analyst and supervises two other employees. He is scheduled to become a manager in
the near future.
Applicant  married  his  first  wife  in  2003,  and  divorced  in  2008.  She  was  a
naturalized U.S. citizen born in Vietnam. He married his second wife, a Thai citizen, in
2008 and divorced in 2012. He sponsored his second wife to become a naturalized U.S.
citizen.  (Tr.  115)  He  has  a  13-year-old  daughter,  born  in  the  United  States,  of  this
relationship. He shares custody of his daughter with his ex-wife.
Applicant’s  wife  was  born  in  Thailand  and  has  been  in  the  United  States  since
2007, under a student visa. They met in 2013 and married in 2015. She has applied for
naturalization as a U.S. citizen and is pending an interview that is scheduled for March
2021. She completed two master’s degrees in the United States and is in the process of
completing her doctorate degree.
At  the  time  Applicant  submitted  his  2017  SCA,  his  spouse  was  working  as  an
independent  contractor  at  the  Thai  embassy.  After  becoming  aware  of  the  security
concerns raised by her employment, his wife resigned her position at the Thai embassy
and is currently unemployed. She is dedicating her time to raising their son and finishing
her doctorate degree. (Tr. 36)
Applicant visited the Thai embassy several times during public functions. He also
met with his wife’s colleagues at the embassy for social functions and at restaurants. They
have had no contact with any Thai embassy personnel after she resigned her position.
Applicant’s  parents-in-law are citizens and residents of Thailand. He is 77 years
old and she is 68 years old. His father-in-law worked for the Thai Ministry of Commerce.
He retired from his job about 14 years ago and receives a government pension.  In his
2017 SCA, Applicant claimed to have contact with his father-in-law quarterly and monthly
with his mother-in-law. He does not speak Thai, and his communication with his in-laws
is exclusively through his wife. Applicant’s brother-in-law is in the United States under a
student  visa.  He  completed  a  master’s  degree  in  a  U.S.  university  and  his  current
employer  is  sponsoring  his  permanent  resident  application.  Applicant  provides  no
financial support for his in-laws. (Tr. 103-104) His in-laws own a home in Thailand. They
have travelled frequently (yearly or every other year) to the United States for family events
such  as  his  wedding,  his  brother-in-law’s  college  graduation,  his  son’s  birth,  and  for
regular family visits.
Applicant repeatedly testified that he cannot be successfully blackmailed because
he would never agree to it. He noted that if he were to give away anything, no matter how
small, that would be a source of blackmail in the future, and it would jeopardize everything
that he has worked for so hard in the United States. He promised to immediately report
any blackmail attempt or request for information, including from his wife, to his facility's
security officer and the FBI.
Applicant described his immigration to the United States as a dream come true.
His  parents  were  some  of  the  first  Albanians  to  receive  a  visa  to  travel  to  the  United
States. They told Applicant about the freedom and opportunities that the United States
offers, and it became part of his dream to come to the United States. He wanted to come
to the United States to have a better life and to obtain the opportunities that he was not
able to have in Albania.
Since the first time that he arrived in the United States, Applicant’s dream was to
be an American and to be a U.S. citizen. He believes that the United States is a country
of opportunities, where all your dreams can be accomplished if you work hard, follow the
law, and obey all the rules. He believes that he has been able to make his dreams come
true. He is proud of the success he has achieved in the United States.
Applicant  strongly  believes  that  there  are  no  opportunities  for  him  or  his  wife  in
Thailand. Once she gets her Ph.D., her career and opportunities will be so much better
in the United States. They have never thought about or even considered the possibility of
her going back to Thailand. Her dream job is to someday work for NASA. She shares his
dream of becoming a U.S. citizen.
Applicant and his wife visited Thailand twice before 2017. After Applicant submitted
his 2017 SCA, he and his wife visited Thailand twice. (Tr. 101-102) He does not intend to
travel to Thailand ever again. He noted that his in-laws have 10-year U.S. travel visas.
He anticipates that they will travel to the United States to see his wife and their grandchild.
All  of  Applicant’s  and  his  wife’s  property  and  financial  assets  are  in  the  United
States,  including  his  salary,  savings,  retirement  accounts,  and  a  home.  He  has  no
financial or property interests in any foreign country. At the time he completed his 2017
SCA,  Applicant  had  an  investment  property.  When  his  wife  quit  her  job  at  the  Thai
embassy, Applicant sold the investment property to avoid any possible financial issues
resulting from their reduced income. (Tr. 99)
Applicant presented the testimony of two witnesses. His supervisor of about three
and one-half years described Applicant as one of his superstars - trustworthy, reliable,
proficient, and well-liked by his clients. The second witness has known Applicant for less
than three years. They have worked in several projects together. She considers Applicant
to be a reliable, trustworthy, and ethical. She testified that Applicant has been involved in
his  community  mentoring  high  school  students,  helping  them  to  prepare  their  college
applications,  and supporting nonprofit  organizations and patriotic events.  Both  of them
endorsed Applicant for a clearance.

been  awaiting  the  court  ratification  of  a  settlement  agreement  they  executed  in  March
2020. (Tr. 22; AE E)
Applicant  was  born  and  raised  in  Egypt.  He  attended  school  in  Egypt  through
college. After fulfilling a compulsory term of service in the Egyptian military, he immigrated
to the United States in 1987 and has been a naturalized U.S. citizen since 1989. (GE 1

government contractor as an information technology consultant. (Tr. 24)
Applicant’s mother-in-law is a citizen and resident of Egypt. (Answer at 1) Applicant
last saw her in 2017 when he returned to Egypt for his father’s funeral. (Tr. 24) He seldom
talked to her when he and his wife were living together, and has no intention of staying in
touch now that he and his wife will be getting divorced. (Tr. 83)
Applicant’s half-sister is a citizen and resident of Egypt. They are not close, as they
were not raised together and are more than 20 years apart in age. She works at a bank.
The only times they encountered each other was when Applicant traveled to Egypt to visit
his father, and ran into her at their father’s house. (Tr. 84)  Applicant last saw her at his
father’s funeral in 2017. He has not spoken with her since October 2018. (Answer at 1)
Applicant’s  remaining contacts with Egyptian citizens and residents were friends
of his soon-to-be ex-wife. Now that they are separated, he no longer plans to stay in touch
with them.
Applicant’s  mother is a naturalized U.S. citizen. She splits her time between the
United States and Egypt. Applicant’s adult children are U.S. citizens who live here. (Tr.
37)
Applicant maintains bank account in Egypt. (GE 2 at 3) He uses it to support his
mother’s medical and living expenses when she is living in Egypt. (Tr. 26) Also, he used
it to purchase and maintain a coffee shop in Egypt, and to make mortgage payments for
two apartments that he owned in Egypt. (GE 2 at 3) He opened the bank account to avoid
incurring international financial transfer fees that he would have incurred if he had used
a U.S. bank for his financial transactions. (Tr. 27)
Applicant purchased the aforementioned coffee shop for $2,700 USD in 2016. (GE
1 at 40). He co-owned it with a married couple who were Egyptian citizens and residents,
and with his son. He used the Egyptian bank account to support the shop. He was never
involved in its daily operations. (Tr. 26)  Later, he sold his ownership interest in the shop.
(Tr. 26)
In  2018,  Applicant  and  his  wife  purchased  an  apartment  in  Egypt  worth
approximately  $80,000.  (Answer  at  1)  They  never  made  it  available  for  rent.  They
renovated it with the intent of one day returning to Egypt to live there during retirement.
As part of their separation agreement, Applicant transferred his ownership interest to his
wife. (AE C, AE E) Applicant is no longer interested in moving to Egypt when he retires.
Applicant owned another apartment with his wife in Egypt. (Answer at 2) Per the
separation  agreement,  his  wife  transferred  her  ownership  interest  to  him.  (Ex.  E)
Applicant uses it as a vacation home. He travelled to Egypt three times between 2012
and 2014, and twice between 2017 and 2018.  He has not travelled to Egypt since April
2018. He is currently attempting to sell the apartment. It is worth approximately $30,000.
Recently, Applicant purchased a home in the United States with his daughter. It is worth
$185,000. (Tr. at 37)
Applicant  has  approximately  $90,000  deposited  in  U.S  checking  and  savings
accounts,  $20,000  invested  in  a  retirement  account,  and  $1,000  invested  in  stock
accounts. Applicant has no banking accounts or investment accounts in Egypt other than

Although  Egypt  is  ostensibly  a  federal  republic,  domestic  and  international
organizations  have  expressed  concern  about  government  limitations  on  association,
assembly, and expression.(HE I at 1) Moreover, in 2017, Egypt’s president consolidated
power  through  a  series  of  constitutional  amendments  that  were  approved  through  a
national referendum, which international observers concluded was corrupt. (HE I at 1)
The  U.S.  Department  of  State  has  assessed  Cairo  as  being  a  critical-threat

Multiple terrorist groups operate in Egypt. In 2019, the Egyptian parliament amended its
anti-terrorism law, increasing punishment from ten years of incarceration for those who
promote  extremist  ideology,  to  15  years  of  incarceration.  (HE  II  at  2)  In  2019,  Egypt
started an academy to train imams and preachers worldwide on how to promote pluralism
and  counter  extremist  narratives.  Egypt  also  works  closely  with  the  Arab  League  to
organize conferences focused on countering terrorist radicalization and recruitment. (HE

"Applicant admitted all six SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 56 years old and married with two children. Applicant has a Master’s
degree in Engineering. She has been employed by the same defense contractor since
1997, with a three-year break in service to care for her two sons between January 2015
and November 2017. At that point she returned to work. She held a security clearance
during her earlier period of employment without incident. She is attempting to reacquire
national  security  eligibility.  (Government  Exhibit  4  at  Sections  12,  13A,  17,  and  18;
Applicant’s Exhibit B.)
Paragraph 1 –  Guideline B (Foreign Influence)
The  Government  alleges  in  this  paragraph  that  Applicant  is  ineligible  for
clearance because she has foreign contacts that could possibly lead to divided loyalties.
Applicant  was  born  in  China  in  1964.  After  finishing  undergraduate  school  in  China
Applicant moved to the United States in 1990 to attend graduate school. As stated, she
first began working for her present employer in 1997. She became an American citizen
in  2000.  Her  husband,  who  was  also  born  in  China,  is  a  naturalized  American  citizen.
Her two children were born in the United States. (Government Exhibit 4 at Sections 9,
17, 18; Tr. 25-26.)
1.a. Applicant’s mother is 83 years old. Before she retired in  approximately 2000
she was a professor at a university in China.
1.b.  Applicant’s  father  is   85  years  old.  He  retired   in   1998  as  a  professor  at   a
university in China.
Applicant’s  parents  were  caught  up  in  the  Cultural  Revolution  period  in  China.
Applicant describes what happened to her family on page 2 of Applicant Exhibit A. (See
Tr. 22-23.)
1.f.  Applicant   sponsored  her   mother  and  father  to   live  full-time  in   the  United
States  as   lawful  permanent  residents  from  2000  to   2014.  From   2004  to   2014  her
parents  would  visit  the  United  States  every  year  of  so  for   three  months  to  retain  their
status as lawful permanent residents. They have not returned to the United States since
2014  and   no  longer  have   permanent  resident  status.   They  continue  to  live   in   China.
Applicant has regular contact with her parents to talk about their health. (Tr. 26-33.)
1.c.   Applicant’s  brother  is  a  citizen   and   resident  of  China.  He   is  49  years  old.
Applicant  does  not  know   the  exact  nature  of  his  business  activities  in   China.  At  one
point her brother  was a lawful permanent resident of the United States and  would visit
the United  States on a regular basis, the last time being  in  2018. According  to Applicant,
“We  had   very  little   in  common  and   we   hardly  can  understand   each   other’s  situations.
Over  the years, our only point of communication is around   our parent’s health and   our
children.” (Government Exhibit 5 at 3; Applicant Exhibit A at 1; Tr. 33-35.)
1.d.  Applicant   has  two  brothers-in-law  who   are  citizens  and   residents  of  China.
One is a farmer. The  other brother-in-law is a road engineer.  (Government Exhibit 4 at
3-4; Applicant  Exhibit A at 1-2;  Tr. 35-36, 39-40.)
1.e. Applicant  has three sisters-in-law. One is married to her brother. That sister-
in-law is a teacher.  She is also a lawful permanent resident of the United States.   The
second   is  married  to   the  farmer,  discussed  above.  She  is  a   homemaker.   The  third  is
married to the road engineer,  discussed above. She is also a homemaker. (Government
Exhibit 4 at 4, Exhibit 5 at 3; Applicant Exhibit A at 1-2; Tr.  37-40.)
All  of  these  in-laws,  except  her  brother’s  wife,  are  from  a  province  hundreds  of
miles  away  from  where  Applicant  grew  up.  She  has  had  very  little  contact  with  them
over  the  years.  Their  dialect  is  dramatically  different  from  Mandarin,  which  Applicant
speaks. She testified, “I  had  hard  time to understand  and  communicate with them. So,
for all those years, only the [sic] way to contact them is to send seasonal greetings at
the Chinese New Year.” (Tr. 20-21.)
Mitigation
Applicant has lived in the United States over 30 years. She states:
I was lucky to have  a  chance to study abroad for  my Master’s Degree in
the United States. And I really appreciated the opportunity that the United
States has offered  me. And I’m  determined  to contribute through my hard
work and   my technical skills. In my heart, I strong  (sic) believe the ideas
that this country holds dear, and  I hope that I am  able to provide  my skills
and   expertise  to  the  Government  programs.  Also,  I  would  stand  for   the
benefit of this country which  give  my husband, two sons and  I a wonderful
life. And I wouldn’t do anything to hurt this country. (Tr. 23.)
Applicant  owns  no  property  in  China.  Nor  does  she  have  any  bank  accounts  in
China.  Applicant  has substantial  monetary and property  interests in the  United States.
(Tr. 42-47.)
Applicant’s  department manager  submitted  a letter  on  her behalf.  This man  has
been  her  supervisor   since  she  originally   went  to  work  for  her  defense  contractor
employer  in   1997.  He   recommended  her  to   receive  her  initial  clearance,  and   further
recommends that she  receive national  security eligibility at this time. He  states,  “During
the  time  that  [Applicant]  held  a  DOD  secret  clearance,  there  were   never  any  security
violations  and   she  followed  all  the  rules   to  safeguard  classified  and  proprietary
information.” (Applicant Exhibit B.)
China
I  take  administrative  notice  of  the  facts  set  forth  in  the  Administrative  Notice
documents concerning China, which are incorporated herein by reference.
China  is  a  large  and  economically  powerful  country,  with  a  population  of  more
than  billion  people  and  an  economy  growing  at  about  10%  per  year.  China  has  an
authoritarian  government,  dominated  by  the  Chinese  Communist  Party.  It  has  a  poor
record  with  respect  to  human  rights,  suppresses  political  dissent,  and  engages  in
arbitrary  arrests  and  detentions,  forced  confessions,  torture,  and  mistreatment  of
prisoners.
China is one of the most aggressive countries in  seeking sensitive and  protected
U.S.  technology  and   economic   intelligence.   It  targets  the  United  States  with  active
intelligence  gathering  programs,  both legal and  illegal.  As a result,  it is a growing threat
to U.S. national security.
",True
"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.f,
with  explanations,  and  he  denied  the  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  1.g.  His  admissions  are
incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 28-year-old linguist sponsored by a defense contractor for a position
in Ukraine. He was born and educated in the United States. His parents and sister are
native-born U.S. citizens and residents.
Applicant lives in  Ukraine with his  wife,  a Ukrainian citizen, and  her  son. Until the
recent COVID travel  restrictions were imposed, he regularly returned  to the United States
to visit family and  friends. He  maintains close contact with a college friend and  roommate
in the United States, who  has visited him and his wife in Ukraine.
Applicant  lived in  Russia  from  June to December 2014 to participate in  a  Critical
Language  Scholarship  Program,  funded  by  the  U.S.   Department  of   State.  During  this
time,  he studied Russian language and  literature in  a study-abroad program organized by
the Council  on International Educational Exchange (CIEE)  and  funded  by U.S. sources.
He  was paired with Russian “partners” during his classes, some of  whom became friends.
Applicant  graduated from college  in  May 2015, with bachelor’s degrees in  Spanish
and  Russian.  He   served as a U.S. Peace Corps volunteer in  Ukraine from September
2016 to November 2018. The  Peace Corps is an independent agency in  the executive
branch of the U.S. Government,  and  Applicant’s participation in  the Peace Corps activities
in   Ukraine   was  U.S.  Government  business.  He   has  been  employed   by  a  defense
contractor  since  December  2018,  awaiting   an  assignment  as  a   linguist  in  Ukraine   in
support of a U.S. Armed Forces multilateral  training mission.
Applicant  married  a  citizen   and  resident  of  Ukraine   in   January  2019.  In  his
response to the  FORM, he stated that he married in  June 2019,  which  apparently is a
mistake,  because   it  is inconsistent  with  his   SCA and  the  counterintelligence screening
interview report, which  reflect a  January 2019 marriage. (FORM Item 4  at  34;  Item 5  at  1-
2.)  He  has a 14-year-old stepson, born during his wife’s previous  marriage   to a citizen
and  resident  of Ukraine. His wife divorced her first  husband  when her son was an infant.
She and  her son have  no contact with her son’s biological father. (Answer at 8.) His wife’s
parents, also citizens and  residents of Ukraine, live across the street from them.  (FORM
Item 4 at 37-40.)
Applicant’s  wife owns an  apartment in  Ukraine where Applicant and she  live, and
she  has  several  Ukrainian  bank  accounts  worth  about  $7,500.  Her  apartment  is  a  45-
square meter,  one-story, one-bedroom apartment worth  about $16,000. (FORM Item  5  at
12.) She  has never visited the United States. Although she intends to apply for a U.S.
visa, Applicant stated in his SCA that it will be “some years from now.”
Applicant’s  wife  works  as  a  freelance  translator  and  is  not  associated  with  any
Ukrainian business. She has never worked for the Ukrainian government or any foreign
intelligence entities. (Answer to SOR at 3.) Before Applicant became acquainted with her,
she voluntarily provided translation services for the Peace Corps and received a letter of
appreciation for her support. (Answer to SOR at 15-16.)
Applicant’s  father-in-law and mother-in-law have directed a children’s folk dance
ensemble for 24 years. (FORM Item 4 at 39-40.) They have never been employed by the
Ukrainian government, any other foreign government, or any foreign intelligence entities.
(Answer to SOR at 5-6.)
Applicant’s prospective supervisor has informed him that if he receives a clearance
and  is  hired,  he  will  be  required  to  move  to  another  region  in  Ukraine.  Anticipating  a
favorable  clearance  decision,  he  and  his  wife  are  in  the  process  of  selling  his  wife’s
apartment  and  renting  another  apartment  in  the  region  where  he  will  be  assigned.
(Answer at 7.)
During  a  counterintelligence  screening  interview  in  February  2019,  Applicant
stated that he would like to work for the U.S. Government in Ukraine for about ten years.
(Item 5 at 5.) He also told the interviewer that his financial situation was “a perilous one,”
because  he  was  unemployed  and  dependent  on  his  parents  and  his  savings  for  living
expenses and student loan payments. (FORM Item 5 at 12.) He has improved his financial
situation since the screening interview by working as a freelance translator. As of October
16,  2020,  when  he  responded  to  the  FORM,  he  had  worked  as  a  freelance  translator
since January 2017 and been paid $5,451 since November 1, 2019; $3,032 since May 1,
2020; $2,376 since August 1, 2020; and $1,685 since October 1, 2020. (FORM Response
at  5.)  He  also  had  contracted  with  a  U.S.-based  museum  to  work  on  a  project  for  an
honorarium of $2,019. (Attachments to FORM Response.
In Applicant’s SCA, he disclosed that he received a job offer in January 2019 from
a Ukrainian company. The job involved customer support and consulting in “virtual data
rooms.” He stated that he was never “technically offered” a position, but was invited for a
final  candidacy  interview.  He  declined  the  interview  because  he  was  pursuing
employment  with  a  defense  contractor.  (FORM  Item  4  at  77.)  In  his  response  to  the
FORM, he stated that the Ukrainian company offered him an annual salary of $27,600,
which he states is “astronomical” by Ukrainian standards. He stated that he rejected the
offer in order to accept his current position with a defense contractor, realizing that there
was no guarantee that he would be granted a security clearance. (FORM Response at
4.)  During  the  counterintelligence  screening  interview  in  February  2019,  he  told  the
interviewer that he had been interviewed by the Ukrainian company and had declined a
second interview in order to attend the screening interview. He also told the interviewer
that if the Ukrainian company called him again, he would accept its offer. (FORM Item 5
at 9.)
When  Applicant  submitted  his  SCA,  he  listed  several  citizens  of  Ukraine  and
Russia  in  the  section  asking,  “Do  you  have,  or  have  you  had,  close  and/or  continuing
contact  with  a  foreign  national  within  the  last  seven  (7)  years  with  whom  you  or  your
spouse . . . are bound by affection influence, common interest, and/or obligation?” In his
response  to  the  FORM,  he  described  his  current  relationships  with  his  Ukrainian  and
Russian contacts. Except for his wife, stepson, and in-laws, all of his Ukrainian contacts
were  related  to  his  service  in  the  Peace  Corps  and  employed  by  a  Ukrainian  state
university.  As  such,  they  were  employees  of  the  Ukrainian  Minister  of  Education  and
Science. After learning that they raised security concerns, he has cut off contact with all
of his Russian contacts and all but two Ukrainian contacts. (FORM Response at 6-9). One
of these two Ukrainian contacts is now a freelance web developer and the other is a self-
employed  illustrator.  (FORM  Item  4  at  44,  49.)  The  information  about  Applicant’s
Ukrainian and Russian contacts is summarized in Appendix A, attached to this decision.
His two Ukrainian friends with whom he maintains contact are identified as AO and LK in
Appendix A.
Two of Applicant’s former colleagues in the Peace Corps submitted letters lauding
him for his loyalty, integrity, sincerity, enthusiasm, and his passionate attitude about his
service to the United States and the mission of the Peace Corps in Ukraine. One of his
colleagues  was  impressed  by  the  way  Applicant  handled  a  situation  reflecting  the
endemic corruption in the Ukrainian education system. Applicant and several other Peace
Corps  volunteers  had  offered  to  serve  as  judges  in  a  yearly  Olympiad  for  Ukrainian
students.  When  Ukrainian  officials  refused  to  correct  a  mistake  in  scoring,  Applicant
pulled all the Peace Corps volunteers out of judging the competition and did so in a way
that did not damage the relations between the Peace Corps and the Ukrainian Ministry of
Education and Science. (Attachments to FORM Response.)
At the request of Department Counsel and without objection by Applicant, I have
taken  administrative  notice  of  relevant  facts  about  Ukraine.  I  also  have  taken
administrative notice on my own motion, without objection from either party, of the facts
set out in the U.S. Department of State document, “U.S. Relations with Ukraine, Bilateral
Relations  Fact  Sheet,  dated  December  18,  2020  (www.state.gov/u-s-relations-with-
ukraine). The facts administratively noticed are set out below.
The United States established diplomatic relations with Ukraine in 1991, following
its independence from the Soviet Union. The United States attaches great importance to
the success of Ukraine as a free and democratic state with a flourishing market economy.
The  U.S.-Ukraine  Charter  on  Strategic  Partnership  highlights  the  importance  of  the
bilateral relationship and continue commitment of the United States to support enhanced
engagement between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Ukraine.
Ukraine has had a parliamentary-presidential type of government since becoming
independent of the Soviet Union in 1991. It is undergoing profound political and economic
change as it  moves  toward  a market  economy  and multiparty  democracy.  Presidential
elections in December 1991 were marred by government intimidation and electoral fraud.
The presidential election in 2005 and local elections in March 2006 were markedly fairer.
The presidential election in April 2018 and the parliamentary elections in July 2018 were
considered free and fair by international and domestic observers.
The  Department  of  State  has  issued  a  Level  2  Travel  Advisory  for  Ukraine
(exercise increased caution) due to crime and civil unrest. Crime targeted at foreigners is
common, due to their perceived wealth. Ukraine has deployed a new professional and
well-trained  police  force,  but  police  corruption  is  a  significant  issue.  Demonstrations
regularly  occur  through  Ukraine  and  are  sometimes  violent.  Politically  targeted
assassinations, bombings, and attacks on minority groups and police have occurred.
Ukraine  has  significant  human  rights  problems.  Torture,  arbitrary  detention  of
persons critical of the government, and warrantless violations of  privacy are illegal but
common. Ukraine has substantial problems with the independence of the judiciary and
widespread  government  corruption.  The  Ukrainian  government  generally  fails  to
adequately investigate or take steps to prosecute or punish officials who commit human
rights abuses, resulting in a climate of impunity.
The Department of State has issued a “do not travel” warning for areas in Ukraine
occupied  by  Russian  authorities.  The  U.S.  government  prohibits  its  employees  from
traveling to Crimea or regions controlled by the Russians.
U.S.  Government  assistance   to  Ukraine  aims  to  support  the  development  of  a
secure, democratic, prosperous, and  free Ukraine, fully integrated into the Euro-Atlantic
community.  The   United  States  has  granted  Ukraine  market-economy  status  and   given
Ukraine permanent normal-trade-relations status. The United States and Ukraine have a
bilateral   investment  treaty.   The   U.S-Ukraine  Council  on  Trade  and   Investment  has
worked  to increase commercial  and  investment opportunities by identifying and removing
impediments to bilateral and investment flows.
Ukraine  and  the  United  States  belong  to  a  number  of  the  same  international
organizations, including the United Nations, Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, International Monetary Fund, World Bank, World Trade Organization, and Euro-
Atlantic Partnership Council. There is no indication in the administrative notice documents
indicating that Ukraine targets the United States for military or economic espionage.

"The SOR alleges under Guideline B that Applicant’s parents, brother, and in-laws
are citizens and residents of Taiwan and that Applicant provides financial support to his
mother. Applicant admits each of these allegations. His admissions are incorporated in
my findings of fact.
Applicant, 43, is being sponsored for  a security clearance for  a systems engineer
position with  a defense contractor since August 2018. His interim clearance was denied.
He  currently works as a regulatory compliance  engineer for a non-government contractor.
He  was born in  Taiwan. In compliance  with Taiwan’s mandatory two-year military-service
requirement,  he enlisted in  the Army in  1997 and  served until  1999. In 2000, Applicant
came  to the United States on a student visa. He received his associate’s degree in 2003
and  his bachelor’s degree in  2005. Applicant and  his wife married in Taiwan in 2006, and
they  have   two  children  ages  10  and   8.  Applicant  became  a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen   in
2009. Applicant’s wife became a naturalized  U.S. citizen  in  2003. This is Applicant’s first
application for  a security clearance. (GX 2.)
At the time that Applicant completed his e-QIP in August 2018, both he and his
wife were dual citizens of Taiwan and the United States. However, Applicant stated that
he and his  wife  had submitted  the required  paperwork  for  renouncing their  Taiwanese
citizenships. He possessed a then-valid U.S. passport that expired in November 2019.
During  his  November  2018  personal  subject  interview  (PSI),  Applicant  presented  an
official  document  to  the  investigator  that  showed  that  Applicant  had  renounced  his
Taiwanese  citizenship  in  September  2018.  Applicant  remains  in  possession  of  a
Taiwanese passport that expired in 2015 and was functionally destroyed when Applicant
renounced his Taiwanese citizenship. During his PSI, Applicant also stated that his wife
completed the same renunciation process. (GX 2; GX 3.)
Applicant  has  daily  telephonic  contact  with  his  mother,  father,  and   brother.
Applicant  provides  $200  a  month  in   support   to  his  mother.   None  of  Applicant’s  family
members in  Taiwan,  to include his in-laws, has any government or  military affiliation. He
has traveled to Taiwan to visit his family numerous times. Applicant’s mother-in-law has
a U.S. permanent resident card and  travels  from Taiwan to the United States every six
months.  She lives with  Applicant  and  his wife while in  the United States. (GX 2; GX 3.) It
is unclear from the record what,  if any, contact Applicant  and/or  his wife have with her
family members or friends in Taiwan.
Applicant purchased a house in the United States in 2009. He stated during his
PSI that he and his wife are solely U.S. citizens with loyalty and allegiance only to the
United States.
The United States and Taiwan enjoy a robust unofficial relationship. The 1979 U.S.
- P.R.C. Joint Communique switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing. In the
Joint  Communique,  the  United  States  recognized  the  Government  of  the  People’s
Republic  of  China  as  the  sole  legal  government  of  China,  acknowledging  the  Chinese
position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China. The Joint Communique
also stated that the people of the United States will maintain cultural, commercial, and
other unofficial relations with the people of Taiwan. The United States does not support
Taiwan independence.
The 2019 U.S. Department of State report on human rights in Taiwan noted that
there  were  no  reports  of  significant  human  rights  abuses.  However,  throughout  2019,
Beijing adopted a more coercive policy toward Taiwan, seeking to isolate and intimidate
Taipei into unification on Beijing’s terms. In January 2019, General Secretary Xi delivered
a  major  speech  wherein  he  claimed  that  Taiwan’s  unification  with  the  P.R.C  was
inevitable  and  indicated  that  the  “one  country,  two  systems”  model  was  the  only
acceptable arrangement for unification. That model has been consistently rejected by the
Taiwanese  public  and  presidential  administrations,  prompting  Beijing  to  intensify  its
multipronged campaign to coerce and isolate Taiwan. In implementing this policy, Beijing
sharply  escalated  its  military,  diplomatic,  and  economic  pressure  against  Taiwan,
including interfering in Taiwan’s media to shape public opinion on China and cross-Strait
relations.  The  deliberate  crossing  of  the  Taiwan  Strait  median  line  by  Chinese  fighter
aircraft  in  March  2019  was  the  first  such  crossing  in  20  years  and  marked  a  sharp
escalation in the military pressure Beijing has increasingly applied against Taipei. China
signaled that its intensifying campaign of military coercion had become official in a key
policy document released in July 2019.
The  United  States  faces  a  serious  threat  to  its  national  security  from  Chinese
intelligence  operations.  China  aggressively  targets  U.S.  sensitive  and  protected
information  and  Chinese  actors  are  the  world’s  most  active  perpetrators  of  economic
espionage. Taiwan has also been an active collector of U.S. economic technologies that
have sensitive military applications. There have been multiple cases involving the illegal
export, or attempted illegal export, of U.S. restricted, dual-use, or military technology to
Taiwan or by Taiwanese nationals. The dual-use of military technologies that have been
targeted  include,  but  are  not  limited  to,  classified  materials,  trade  secrets,  weapons
technologies, and high-tech microelectronics.
",False
"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions
are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  55-year-old  software  engineer  employed  by  a  defense  contractor
since May 2006. He received a security clearance in October 2006.
Applicant was born in China, and in 1989 he participated in the Tiananmen Square
protest against the government of China. After that experience, he decided to “chase [his]
freedom” in the United States. He was accepted at a prestigious U.S. university in 1993
and  came  to  the  United  States  on  a  student  visa.  He  received  a  doctorate  degree  in
February 1999. He became a U.S. citizen in September 2005.
Applicant married a citizen and resident of China in July 1992. His wife is now a
naturalized U.S. citizen and works as a financial analyst for a local transportation authority
in the United States. (GX 3 at 4.) Applicant has two children, ages 18 and 20, who are
native-born U.S. citizens.
Applicant’s mother was a retired accountant before she passed away in 2006. His
84-year-old father is a citizen and resident of China and is a retired hotel manager. His
father married a citizen  and  resident of  China in  2007. His father’s 78-year-old second
wife is a retired nurse. Applicant’s 58-year-old sister is a citizen and resident of China and
is a retired technical school teacher.
Applicant and his father have set boundaries on interaction between them. When
Applicant’s father decided to remarry, Applicant asked him to postpone the wedding until
he could attend. His father responded:
Son, I always love you  and  your mother no matter what happens. However,
as both of us are adults,  I’m not in the same family with you anymore. We
have  [our] own separate families and make independent decisions for [our]
own families. Yours is in  USA, mine is in  China. . . We respect each  other
but never make decisions for each other since you were over 18. . . .
(AX A at 10.)
Applicant and his wife have also set boundaries at home regarding discussion of
Applicant’s work. His wife and daughters know that he is involved in sensitive work, but
the “family rule” prohibits asking  him about  his job or his long and sometimes unusual
working hours. Applicant’s father is aware of the “family rule” and respects it. (AX P.)
Applicant’s  82-year-old  father-in-law  is  a  citizen  and  resident  of  China  and  is  a
retired senior engineer who worked for a Chinese ship designer. Applicant’s 77-year-old
mother-in-law is a citizen of China who is a retired researcher who worked at a Chinese
observatory. She came to the United States in September 2015 to be closer to Applicant’s
family, and she is now a permanent resident of the United States. (GX 2 at 30; GX 3 at
5.)
Applicant has visited his family members and in-laws in China two times during the
last  ten  years.  He  maintains  telephonic  contact  with  his  parents.  He  has  occasional
telephonic contact with his sister, about one or two times a year. He rarely talks to his in-
laws.
Applicant  and  his  wife  have  a  combined  annual  income  of  about  $200,000.
Applicant’s  parents, sister,  and mother-in-law receive pensions and are financially self-
sufficient. In accordance with Chinese tradition of “red envelope” gifts, Applicant and his
wife  send  money  to  their  parents  on  holidays  such  as  the  Chinese  New  Year.  In  the
Chinese  culture,  the  gifts  are  expressions  of  affection  and  respect,  and  they  are  not
intended as financial support.
During the past ten years, Applicant and his wife have sent the following monetary
gifts, which are listed in Applicant’s answer to the SOR:
   $1,000 to Applicant’s father on December 16, 2009
   $1,500 to Applicant’s father on February 2, 2011
   $1,500 to Applicant’s mother-in-law on June 15, 2011
   $2,000 to Applicant’s father on January 2, 2012
   $3,000 to Applicant’s father on July 1, 2012
   $1,800 to Applicant’s mother-in-law on October 12, 2015
  $800 to Applicant’s mother-in-law on February 3, 2015
   $1,500 to Applicant’s father on February 3, 2015
   $2,000 to Applicant’s father on March 23, 2017
I  have  taken  administrative  notice  that  China  has  an  authoritarian  government
dominated by the Communist Party. The government aggressively targets sensitive and
protected  U.S.  technology  and  military  information,  using  worldwide  intelligence
operations. It is one of the world’s most aggressive practitioners of economic espionage
and  one  of  the  greatest  espionage  and  cyber-attack  threats  to  the  United  States  It
presents a persistent cyber-espionage threat to the U.S. military and critical infrastructure
systems.
The Chinese government  uses its intelligence and  influence  apparatus to shape
international  views and  gain advantages over its  competitors, including the United States.
It   uses  multiple  government  entities  to  acquire  restricted  U.S.  technologies  and   it
encourages  and   rewards  private   individuals   who  obtain  technology  on  its  behalf.  Most
Chinese  cyber operations against U.S. private industry are focused on cleared defense
contractors  and  information-technology and communications companies. It  is one  of the
leading  destinations  for   illegal  exports  of  restricted  U.S.  technology.  The  government
frequently gathers intelligence  by appealing to an individual’s desire to help  the country.
U.S. citizens of Chinese ancestry with family ties to China are prime intelligence targets.
It   uses  a   variety  of   methods  to   acquire  foreign  military   and   dual-use  technologies,
including  access  to  knowledgeable  experts  under  the   guise  of  civilian  research,  cyber
activity,  and   exploitation  of  the  access  of  Chinese  nationals,  such  as  students  or
researchers, to act as agents or intermediaries.
Despite  political  disagreements,  the  United  States  and  the  China  are  major
economic  and  trading  partners.  As  of  August  2018,  China  was  the  third-largest  export
market  for U.S.  goods  (after Canada and Mexico),  and  the  United  States  was  China’s
largest export market.
I also have taken administrative notice that China has a poor human rights record.
It  suppresses  political  dissent,  and  it  practices  arbitrary  arrest  and  detention,  forced
confessions, torture, and mistreatment of prisoners. Repression and coercion is focused
primarily on organizations and individuals involved in rights advocacy and public interest
issues. Efforts to silence and intimidate political activists are common. Travelers to China
can expect to be placed under surveillance, with their hotel rooms, telephones, and fax
machines monitored and personal possessions, including computers, searched without
their knowledge or consent.
The Chinese government does not recognize dual nationality. Chinese nationals
who  have  settled  abroad  and  been  naturalized  as  foreign  citizens  lose  their  Chinese
citizenship.
Applicant’s software engineering senior manager, who has worked for Applicant’s
employer  for  24  years,  submitted  a  letter  that  includes  the  following  comments:  “The
characteristic I value most highly is integrity . . . . I can honestly say that, from everything
I’ve seen from him and heard from his colleagues, [Applicant] has always demonstrated
the highest level of integrity.” (AX B.) Applicant’s engineering manager considers him as
honest,  loyal,  and  dependable,  and  a  person  who  sets  a  high  bar  of  integrity  and
professionalism for himself. (AX C.)
The   U.S.  Government   representative  overseeing   defense-related  contracts

Applicant  was  born  in  Afghanistan  to  Afghan  parents.  He  worked  under
dangerous  conditions  in  Afghanistan  as  a  linguist  in  support  of  the  U.S.  mission  from
2008  to  2012.  Because  of  his  work,  he  was  eligible  for  a  special  immigrant  visa.  He
immigrated  to  the  United  States  in  2012,  and  he  became  a  U.S.  citizen  in  2018.  He
married his wife in Afghanistan in 2014. She immigrated to the United States and is a
U.S. permanent resident. (Tr. at 26, 29, 37; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2)
Applicant’s parents, six siblings, and parents-in-law are citizens and residents of
Afghanistan. Applicant’s parents have been approved to immigrate to the United States.
He provides them  about $700 to $800 per month in  support. He hopes they will arrive
within  the  next  few  months.  One  of  his  brothers  also  worked  in  support  of  the  U.S.
mission  in  Afghanistan  and  has  applied  to  immigrate  to  the  United  States.  The  rest  of
Applicant’s  siblings  hope  to  eventually  immigrate  to  the  United  States.  (Tr.  at  26-32;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 3, 4; AE 1, 2)
Applicant’s father-in-law is a retired senior officer in the Afghan military. Applicant
has  not  had  any  contact  with  his  father-in-law  since  2018.  His  wife  maintains  contact
with her parents, but Applicant asked her not to tell them that he is back in Afghanistan
working  for a  U.S  defense  contractor.  (Tr.  at  27,  33-35;  Applicant’s  response  to  SOR;

Applicant  has  extended  family  members  in  the  United  States,  including  uncles
and his wife’s sister. He returned to Afghanistan in 2019 to work in support of the U.S.
mission,  and  he  is  currently  working  there.  He  expressed  his  undivided  loyalty  to  the
United  States.  He  credibly testified  that  his family in  Afghanistan  could  not  be  used  to
coerce  or intimidate him  into  revealing classified  information, and  that he  would  report
any attempt to do so (Tr. at 39-43)
Applicant  called   two   witnesses,  and   he   submitted   documents   and   letters  from
U.S.  personnel  attesting   to   his  outstanding   service  as  a   linguist  in   support  of   combat
missions, both  from 2008  to  2012,  as well as during his current time  in Afghanistan. One
witness  worked   with   Applicant   in   Afghanistan   in   the   2008   to   2012   period,   maintained
contact with him  through Facebook, and is again working  with him in Afghanistan. (Tr. at

He  has  shown  exemplary  support  by  his  willingness  to  put  the  safety  of
others and the mission first . . . . He has been placed in unique situations
that  required  decision  making  in  a  stressful environment,  allowing  him  to

"In  Applicant’s  SOR  response,  he  admitted  the  SOR  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a
through 1.f and 1.h through 1.n. (HE 3) He denied the SOR allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.g,
1.o, 1.p, and 1.q. (Id.) He also provided mitigating information. (Id.)
Applicant  is  a 50-year-old  Egyptian  and  United  States dual citizen  who  seeks  a
security clearance.  (GE  1)  He  has been  employed  as  a  senior engineer  for a  defense
contractor since 2017. (Tr. 18; GE 1 at 13) He has previously held a public trust position.
He has also been employed as a consultant from 2010 to the present. (Id. at 14) He has
exceptional  experience  as  an  engineer  and  held  important  professional  positions  with
multiple  companies  in  the  United  States.  (AE  A)  His  current  annual  salary  is  about
$160,000 plus bonuses. (Tr. 18) In 1995, he married, and his three children were born in
the United States in 1997, 2001, and 2006. (Tr. 21; GE 1 at 26-29)
Foreign Influence
In  1970, Applicant was born in Egypt.  (GE 1  at 9) From  1987  to  1995, he  attended
a  university  in Egypt;  he  received  a  bachelor’s degree  in  1992;  and a  master’s degree  in
1995. (Id. at 12) In  1995, he  immigrated  to  the  United  States. (Tr. 44) From  1995  to  2001,
he  attended  a  university  in the  United  States.  (SCA at 12)  In  1997,  he  received  a  master’s
degree  in the  United  States,  and  in 2001,  he  received  a  Ph.D.  in the  United  States. (Id. at
13)  In  2008, Applicant became  a  U.S. citizen.  (Tr. 48; SCA  at 8; GE  2  at 1)  He has not
taken  any  action  to  renounce  his Egyptian  citizenship.  (Id. at 9) From  2004  to  present,  he
has lived in the same residence in the United  States. (Id. at 10)
SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c allege and Applicant admitted his spouse, daughter, and
two  sons  are  dual citizens  of  Egypt  and  the United  States.  (Tr. 29) They reside  in  the
United States, and most recently went to Egypt in 2019. (Tr. 29, 32, 58) One son and one
daughter  have  Egyptian  birth  certificates  because  “it  was  natural  to  get  them  birth
certificates where we are citizens, but they never basically used it.” (Tr. 30, 49-50; GE 2
at 7) He did not intend to apply for a birth certificate for his third child. (Tr. 50; GE 2 at 7)
SOR  ¶¶   1.d   and   1.e   allege   and   Applicant  admitted   his   mother  and   two   sisters
(sister one  and  sister two) are citizens and  residents of  Egypt,  and  in  2019  as of  the  date
of  his SOR response, all  three  were  employed, either active  or semi-retired,  by  an  entity
that may  have  a  connection  to  the Egyptian  government.  (Tr.  30-32;  GE  1; GE  2) He  did
not  provide details  about the  importance  of their  positions or their  likelihood  of coming to
the   government’s  attention.   (GE  2)  At  his  hearing,  he   said  he   is  unsure   about  the
employment status of his mother and sisters  one and two, and he  did not explain why he
was no  longer aware of their  employment  status. (Tr. 31-33, 50) He  did not know  whether
sisters one  and  two  currently  work for  the  same  entity  as indicated  in the  SOR. (Tr. 33)
He said because  of  his “infrequent”  contact with  sisters  one  and  two, he  cannot be  sure
about their  current employment situation. (Tr. 53-54)  In  2017, Applicant communicated
with  his sisters and his  father-in-law  on  a  monthly  basis. (GE 1  at 29-34; GE  2  at 7). He
sporadically  communicates with  his mother every  week or every  other week, and  with  his
sisters every  two  to  three  months.  (Tr. 31-32,  51-56; GE  2  at 6)  His mother is aware of
his  profession   as  an   engineer;  however,  she   is  unaware  that  he   is   seeking   a   security
clearance. (Tr. 31)  SOR ¶  1.f  alleges  Applicant’s sister  three  is a  citizen  of Egypt and  a
resident of  Kuwait; however, after he  completed  his SCA,  she  moved  to  Egypt.  (Tr. 32-
33;  SOR  response)  Two   of   his  sisters  are   married,  and   he   does   not  know   what  their
husbands currently  do  for a living. (Tr. 33)
SOR  ¶¶  1.g,  1.h,  and  1.i,  allege  Applicant’s  mother-in-law,  father-in-law,  and
brother-in-law  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Egypt,  and  all  three  are  or  were  recently
employed by the same entity as his two sisters. His mother-in-law passed away, and SOR
¶  1.g  is  mitigated.  (Tr.  34)  His  father-in-law  is  a  citizen  and  resident  of  Egypt,  and  as
recently as 2019, he was in a semi-retired position with the entity. (Tr. 34; SOR response)
He may be receiving a pension from the Egyptian government or the entity that employed
him.  Applicant  said  at  his  hearing  that  he  is  unaware  of  his  father-in-law’s  current
employment. (Tr. 34) He most recently spoke to his father-in-law about three months ago,
and he usually speaks to his father-in-law about every six months. (Tr. 34-35, 56) Several
years ago, Applicant’s father-in-law visited Applicant in the United States. (Tr. 35) One of
Applicant’s  brothers-in-law  is  married  to  Applicant’s  sister,  and  his  brother-in-law  is  a
citizen and resident of Egypt. (Tr. 35) He was employed by the same entity that employed
his Applicant’s sister; however, Applicant said he did not know his brother-in-law’s current
employment.  (Tr. 35, 55;  GE  2  at  11)  He  speaks  to  his  brother-in-law  about  every six
months when he talks to his sister. (Tr. 36, 55) Applicant’s third sister who formerly lived
in  Kuwait  is  a  stay-at-home  mother.  (Tr.  55)  He  did  not  know  about  her  husband’s
employment. (Tr. 56)
SOR  ¶¶  1.j  and  1.k  allege  and  Applicant  admits  he  has  five  nieces  and  four
nephews who are citizens and residents of Egypt. (Tr. 36-37) About the only time he has
contact with them is when he visits Egypt. (Tr. 36) His nieces and nephews are children,
teenagers, and/or students. (Tr. 37)
Applicant  visited  Egypt  as  follows:  2009  (one  visit  for  11-20  days);  2010  (11-20
days); 2011 (three visits for 11-20 days, 6-10 days, and 11-20 days); 2012 (one visit for
11-20 days); 2013 (two visits for 6-10 days and 11-20 days); 2014 (one visit for 11-20
days); 2015 (one visit for 11-20 days); 2016 (one visit for 11-20 days); 2017 (one visit for
17 days), and 2019 (one visit for 11-20 days). (Tr. 52, 68; SCA at 43-60; GE 2 at 13) For
all of his trips to Egypt, he traveled with his wife and children, except for his trips in 2011
(twice) and 2013 (once). (Tr. 32, 58; GE 2 at 10) During his visits to Egypt, he usually
visited his mother, sisters, father-in-law, brother-in-law, and nieces. (Tr. 32, 35-36, 57)
Applicant said he travels to Egypt about every two years. (Tr. 57)
Applicant’s spouse  was born in Egypt in 1971.  (GE 1  at 22) Applicant met  her  in
Egypt.  (Tr. 47) She  became  a  U.S. citizen  around  2007. (Tr. 49) He and  his spouse’s total
U.S.  annual  income   is   about   $290,000.  (Tr.  25)  His  spouse   has  resided   in   the   United
States for 26  years. (Tr. 20) In  response  to  a  question  about his spouse’s contacts with
her father,   Applicant said,  “Probably   she  calls him,   but I don’t know.” (Tr. 56)  She  is a
successful professional who  owns her own  business.  (Tr. 19) Her equity  in the  building
where her office  is located  is $210,000. (Tr. 19, 25) Their  equity  in their  home  is  about
$780,000, and they have about $1,500,000 in U.S. investments and retirement accounts
for a total net worth in the United States of $2,490,000. (Tr. 25-27, 64)
Financial Connections to Egypt
SOR ¶ 1.l alleges Applicant owns an apartment in Egypt valued at about $80,000.
His mother lives in it, and he said he did not “actually control it or own it.” (Tr. 37, 51, 67)
His mother controls the property. (Tr. 68) He said the estimated value could be $1,000,
$50,000, or $80,000 and the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator just put
the highest number they heard in their report. (Tr. 37)
SOR  ¶¶  1.m  and  1.n  allege  and  Applicant  admits  he  has  two  bank  accounts  in
Egypt with a total of about $87,000 in them. (Tr. 38-40, 68-69; SCA at 37) The amounts
in  the  accounts  vary  depending  on  his  visits  to  Egypt  and  his  investments.  He  has
transferred funds through his Egyptian accounts to the United States. (Tr. 39)
SOR ¶ 1.o alleges and Applicant admits he inherited a share of a building in Egypt
valued at about $330,000. (Tr. 41, 69-70; GE 2 at 9) Applicant disputed the valuation of
the building, and said he only had a one-eighth share. He explained that because of old
rental laws that prevent him from selling the building, the value is actually zero. (Tr. 41)
The cost to maintain the property exceeds the rent received from the tenants. (Tr. 41) He
did not even know the location of the building, and it is not in his name. (Tr. 70-71)
SOR  ¶  1.p  alleges  Applicant  is  eligible  to  receive  retirement  benefits  from  an
Egyptian  employer  valued  at  about  $10,000.  Applicant  worked  for  the  same  Egyptian
entity from 1992 to 1995 that employs or employed his sisters. (Tr. 42-43) He was on a
leave of absence from this Egyptian employment from 1995 until 2014. (SCA at 42) He
previously  indicated  he  expected  to  receive  retirement  from  this  Egyptian  employer  of
about $10,000. (SCA at 39; GE 2 at 8) He would be eligible for the retirement benefit at
age 60. (Tr. 73) At his hearing, he said he expects not to apply for any Egyptian retirement
because the amount received would be too low for him to make an effort to collect. (Tr.
42-43, 72)
SOR ¶ 1.q alleges that from 2015 to 2017, Applicant contributed about 25 percent
of  the total investment or about $8,000 to purchase an apartment in Egypt. (HE  2) He
agreed that he made the investment; however, he sold his share in 2017 or 2018. (Tr. 43,
63; HE 3; SCA at 38, 40-41)
In   sum   at  most,   Applicant’s  investments  in  Egypt  total  $80,000   (SOR  ¶   1.l)  +
$87,000 (SOR ¶¶ 1.m  & 1.n) +  $41,625  (SOR ¶  1.o (1/8 X $333,000)) + $10,000 (SOR ¶
1.p) =  $218,625. Applicant disputed  the  SOR’s valuation  of  several of  these  investments,
and  he  concluded  his  Egyptian  investments  are less  than  ten  percent  and  possibly  less
than  five  percent of  the  net worth  for all  of his investments  in  the  United  States.  (Tr.  28,
39) He does not intend to retire in Egypt. (Tr. 28)
Applicant  said  he  does  not  vote  in  Egyptian  elections,  and  he  votes  in  U.S.
elections. (Tr. 44-45, 76) However, his July 10, 2017 OPM interview indicates he most
recently  voted  in  an  Egyptian  election  in  2014,  several  years  after  he  became  a  U.S.
citizen. (GE 2 at 2) He was not aware of any instance where the Egyptian government
approached his family members asking for information about Applicant. (Tr. 60) He was
unaware  of  financial  connections  between  the  Egyptian  government  and  the  entity
employing his sisters in 2019 when he completed his response to the SOR. (Tr. 62; SOR
response) Applicant was previously employed by the same entity in Egypt that employed
his sisters. (GE 2) He and his spouse do not have any siblings or close relatives living in
the United States other than those previously discussed. (Tr. 74-75) Applicant is willing
to  renounce  his  Egyptian  citizenship.  (Tr.  78;  GE  2  at  11)  If  his  family  in  Egypt  were
threatened  by  terrorists  or  criminals  to  obtain  classified  information  from  Applicant,  he
would report to security any attempt to coerce him for information. (Tr. 79) The United
States is his home, and he promised to continue to faithfully serve the United States. (Tr.

Egypt
Egypt  and  the  United  States  belong  to  a  number  of  the  same  international
organizations,  including  the  United  Nations, International  Monetary Fund, World  Bank,
and World Trade Organization. Egypt is a Partner for Cooperation with the Organization
for  Security  and  Cooperation  in  Europe,  an  observer  to  the  Organization  of  American
States,  a  partner  in  the  NATO  Mediterranean  Dialogue,  and  a  non-party  state  to  the
International Criminal Court. Cairo hosts the headquarters of the League of Arab States.
The United States established diplomatic relations with Egypt in 1922, following its
independence from protectorate status under the United Kingdom. The United States and
Egypt  share  a  strong  partnership  based  on  mutual  interest  in  Middle  East  peace  and
stability,  economic  opportunity,  and  regional  security.  Promoting  a  stable,  prosperous
Egypt,  where  the  government  protects  the  basic  rights  of  its  citizens  and  fulfills  the
aspirations of the Egyptian people, will continue to be a core objective of U.S. policy.
U.S. assistance  to  Egypt has long  played  a  central role  in Egypt's economic and
military   development  and   in  furthering   the   strategic  partnership   and   regional  stability.
Since  1978,  the  United  States  has  provided  Egypt with  what now  totals over $50  billion  in
military and $30  billion  in economic assistance.
Egypt  and  the  United  States  signed  a  Bilateral  Investment  Treaty  in  1982  to
promote and facilitate investment between the two countries. Egypt and the United States
have signed a trade and investment framework agreement, a step toward creating freer
trade and increasing investment flows. American firms are active in most sectors of the
Egyptian economy, including oil and gas exploration and production, financial services,
manufacturing,  construction,  telecommunications  technology,  information  technology,
and the restaurant and hospitality industry. Flows of U.S. direct investment to Egypt were
$1.37  billion  in  2019,  bringing  the  accumulated  long-term  stock  of  U.S.  foreign  direct
investment to nearly $24 billion.
The U.S. has been largely involved in the Multinational Force & Observers (MFO)
operation  since  1982.  The  MFO  is  a  peacekeeping  operation  that  supervises  and
monitors the implementation of the security provisions of the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli Treaty
of Peace.
Examples  of  recent  cooperation  between  the  United  States  and  Egypt  are  as
follows: On March 14, 2021, Egyptian ENS SHARM EL-SHEIKH and USS SOMERSET
perform passing exercise; On February 23, 2021, Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken's
call  with  Egyptian  Foreign  Minister  Sameh  Shoukry  occurred;  on  December  17,  2020,
USTDA  supported  major  refinery  upgrades  in  Egypt;  on  August  24,  2020,  the  Texas
National Guard and Egyptian military began a long-term military partnership; on August
17,  2020,  Secretary  of  State  Michael  R.  Pompeo  certified  that  Egypt  is  sustaining  the
strategic relationship with the United States and meeting its obligations under the 1979
Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty; and on January 8, 2019, an agreement was signed in Cairo
regarding defense  cooperation  between  the United  States  and  Egypt  and  entered  into
force.
Egypt is a republic governed by an elected president and unicameral legislature.
Presidential elections were held in March 2018. Prior to the elections, challengers to the
incumbent  President  Abdel  Fattah  al-Sisi  withdrew  their  candidacy,  citing  personal
decisions,  political  pressure,  legal  troubles,  and  unfair  competition.  Domestic  and
international  organizations  expressed  concern
limitations  on
association,  assembly,  and  expression  severely  constrained  broad  participation  in  the
political process. Egypt was under a government declared State of Emergency for all of
2019, and has been since the April 2017 terrorist attacks on Coptic Churches.
that  government
The   U.S.  Department   of   State   travel  advisory   for  Egypt  is  Level  3:  Exercise
increased  caution  due  to  terrorism  and  the  Embassy's limited  ability  to  assist  dual  national
U.S.  Egyptian  citizens who are arrested or detained. Do not travel to the Sinai Peninsula
(with   the   exception   of   travel  to   Sharm   El-Sheikh  by   air)  or  the   Western  Desert  due   to
terrorism,  and  to  the  Egyptian  border  areas due  to  military  zones.  The  U.S.  Government
has limited  ability  to  provide  emergency  services to  U.S.  citizens anywhere in the  Sinai
Peninsula,  as  U.S. Government employees are not authorized  to  travel to  these  areas
(with  the  exception  of  the  beach  resort  of Sharm  El-Sheikh;  travel to  Sharm  El-Sheikh is
permitted  only by air).
Egypt's borders are under military control; movement of non-military persons and
vehicles  is  substantially  restricted,  and  in  some  cases  prohibited  within  these  areas.
Terrorist groups continue plotting attacks in Egypt. Terrorists may attack with little or no
warning, and terrorists have targeted diplomatic facilities, tourist locations, transportation
hubs,  markets,  shopping  malls,  western  businesses,  restaurants,  resorts,  and  local
government  facilities.  Terrorists  have  conducted  attacks  in  urban  areas,  including  in
Cairo,  despite  the  heavy  security  presence.  Terrorists  have  targeted  religious  sites,  to
include mosques, churches, monasteries, and buses traveling to these locations.
The  U.S.  Department  of  State  has  assessed  Cairo  as  being  a  critical-threat
location for terrorism directed at or affecting official U.S. Government interests. Several
terrorist organizations operate in Egypt. The Islamic State-Sinai Province terrorist group
(also known as Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis (ABM), an ISIS affiliate) is the most active terrorist
group in Egypt; it pledged allegiance to ISIS in 2014.
Most terrorist attacks in  Egypt occur in the Sinai Peninsula and largely targeted
security forces, but terrorist attacks targeting civilians, tourists, and security personnel in
mainland Egypt remained a concern. Though early 2019 witnessed a series of improvised
explosive device (IED) incidents in greater Cairo, those incidents became more infrequent
as the year progressed. ISIS-Sinai Province (ISIS-SP) carried out the majority of the total
attacks in 2019, though it claimed no attacks in mainland Egypt and no attacks against
Western  interests.  ISIS-SP  responded  to  ISIS's  call  to  increase  attacks  to  avenge  the
terrorist group's territorial defeat in Syria in March. There were at least 151 IED-related
attacks in Egypt in 2019, of which ISIS-SP conducted at least 137 in northern and central
Sinai,  along  with  near-weekly  complex  assaults  on  government-fortified  positions,
demonstrating  the  terrorist  group's  freedom  to  maneuver  during  daytime  hours  and
geographic expansion of attacks westward, toward the Suez Canal Zone, and southward.
In addition, Harakat Sawa'd Misr (HASM) and al-Qa'ida allied groups such as Ansar al-
Islam are believed to be behind the spate of anti-western attacks in mainland Egypt in
2019, and  they also posed a continued threat.  A number of terrorism-related  incidents
were  reported  on  Egyptian  news  and  on  Egyptian  social  media  in  2019,  and  included
small arms attacks, IEDs, vehicle borne IEDs, kidnappings, executions, complex assaults,
ambushes, and targeted assassinations.
According  to  the  most  recent  U.S.  Department  of  State  Human  Rights  Report,
human rights issues in Egypt during 2019 included arbitrary or unlawful killings, including
incidents  that  occurred  while  making  arrests  or  holding  persons  in  custody  or  during
disputes with civilians. There were also reports of civilians killed during military operations
in Sinai. Impunity was a problem. There were instances of persons tortured to death and
other allegations of killings in prisons and detention centers. The government charged,
prosecuted,  and  convicted  perpetrators  in  some  cases.  A  local  human  rights
nongovernmental organization (NGO) reported 302 unlawful killings by the government
from January through June.

would then purchase the car and arrange for its shipment to Nigeria. (Tr. 43; GE 3 at 6).
Between October 2012 and January 2013, there were multiple electronic transactions to

Nigeria  is  a  federal republic composed  of  36  states.  (HE I at  1)  Authorities do  not
always  hold  the   police,  military,  or  other  security   force  personnel   accountable  for  the
use of  excessive or deadly force for the death of people in custody. (HE I at 2).  Although
the   Nigerian   government  has  taken   steps  to   root   out  public  corruption,   it  remains
endemic to all levels of government in Nigeria. (HE I at 1-2)
Terrorism  and  banditry are major  problems  in  parts of  Nigeria. There  have  been
episodes   of   hostage   taking   and   kidnappings  for  ransom   targeting   dual  nationals  who
have  returned  to  Nigeria  for a  visit,  or U.S. citizens  with  perceived  wealth. (HE  II  at 2)

"Applicant  admitted  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.c,  2.a,  and  2.b  with  brief
explanations. His admissions and explanations are incorporated into the findings of fact.
After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the
following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is now 44 years old. He was born in Nigeria. He earned his bachelor’s
degree in Nigeria in 2000. (Tr. 91-92) He came to the United States in 2001, at age 24,
on a student visa, to pursue a master’s degree, which he earned in 2003. (GE 1 at 9; Tr.
47-48,  92-93)  He  has  worked  for  his  current  employer,  a  defense  contractor,  for  15
years, since 2005. (Tr. 48) He is a software engineer, and has an annual salary of about
$130,000.  (Tr.  71,  73)  Applicant  became  a  U.S.  citizen  in  2015.  Later  in  2015,  he
applied for access  to  sensitive  information.  (GE  6,  GE  7;  Tr. 49) That  application  was
granted, and he now seeks a security clearance. (GE 1; Tr. 17)
Applicant  has been married  twice.  He  was  first  married from  2002 to  2009. (Tr.
49, 106) He and his second wife have been married since 2010. (GE 1; Tr. 49, 98) She
is  a  Nigerian  citizen  and  has  permanent  United  States  resident  status  until  July 2023.
(SOR  ¶  1.b)  She  has  applied  for  U.S.  citizenship.  (Tr.  45-46,  99-100,  229-231)  They
have  three  children,  now  ages  16,  8,  and  5;  all  of  them  are  native-born  U.S.  citizens.
(GE  1;  Tr.  50,  105-107)  Applicant’s  wife  works  at  a  local  university,  where  she  also
earned her degree. (Tr. 100-102) They own their current home and a former residence,
both in the United States. (Tr. 110-113)
Applicant’s mother and  father are citizens and  residents of Nigeria. (SOR ¶ 1.a)
(GE  1)  They  are  in  their  eighties  and  are  retired.  His  father  owned  a  restaurant.  His
mother was an accountant. Applicant talks to his parents about once a month.  (Tr. 64,
69,  78-81,  260-261;  GE  2  at  3)  He  testified  that  he  does  not  provide  them  financial
support.  (Tr. 82)  Applicant’s  two  siblings  reside  in  the  United  Kingdom  (UK).  They are
dual UK-Nigerian citizens. (Tr. 83)
After  coming   to   the   United   States,   Applicant   returned   to   Nigeria   in   2007   to   see
his family  and  to  attend  a friend’s wedding. (Tr. 67) He most  recently  travelled  to  Nigeria
in January  2020  before traveling  with  family  to  the  UK  for his mother’s 80th  birthday. (Tr.
64-68,  81,  225; GE  1)  Applicant used  his  U.S. passport for this trip, though  he  testified
that  he   has  since   renewed   his  Nigerian   passport.  (Tr.  96-98,  225-226;  GE   2   at  2)
Applicant also went to  the  UK  in 2017  for his father’s 80th  birthday. (Tr. 81)  His parents
have also visited the  United  States  in the past. (Tr. 119)
Applicant’s  mother-in-law   was  a   naturalized   U.S.  citizen   from   Nigeria.  She   lived
in the  United  States  for many  years, until passing  away  earlier this year. (Tr. 70-71; GE
1)   His  father-in-law   is   deceased.  (GE  1;   GE   2)   Applicant’s  wife   has  other  family   in
Nigeria   but  Applicant  and   his  wife   do   not  own   property   or  have   any   financial  interests
there.  (Tr.  107-109) Applicant  has  two  old  friends  in Nigeria  that he  keeps in touch  with.
(Tr. 93-95)
In about 2015, Applicant and his wife started a company (H) in the United States.
They  hoped  to  use  the  business  to  export  consumer  products,  such  as  baby  food,  to
Nigeria and other foreign countries where they saw a commercial need. They sought a
business  partnership  with  large  U.S.  retailers  but  this  pursuit  was  unsuccessful.  The
company remains in business. (Tr. 74, 208-213, 237-238; GE 4; GE 5)
In  late  2016,  Applicant’s wife  received  a phone  call from  a man  in Nigeria.  She
told Applicant that the man, Mr. E, was a distant cousin of hers who needed help with
his  business,  and  put  Applicant  on  the  phone  with  him.  When  they  spoke,  Mr.  E  told
Applicant  that  he  was  a  foreign-exchange  broker,  and  that  Mr.  E  wanted  to  use
Applicant’s  bank  accounts  in  the  United  States  to  transfer  money  between  unknown
individuals in the U.S. and one of Mr. E’s clients, a travel agency in South Africa. (GE 2
at 9; Tr. 50-60, 69)
Applicant agreed to help Mr. E. Between October and December 2016, Applicant
and  Mr.  E  arranged  and  confirmed  numerous  bank  transactions  through  a  text
messaging  application  (app).  (Tr.  50-54;  120;  GE  4;  GE  2  at  9)  The  transcript  of  their
text  conversations  is  detailed  in  GE  4,  a  document  provided  by  Applicant  during  his
background interview and discussed in the hearing at Tr. 124-205. (The pages in GE 4
are in quadrants, and require a magnifying glass to read; see Tr. 77).
Applicant  gave  Mr.  E  his  bank  routing  number  and  account  information  to
facilitate  the  money  transfers. When  Mr.  E  or  his  associates  in  the  United  States  had
made a deposit into Applicant’s bank account, Mr. E would text Applicant a photo of the
deposit slip, and then Applicant would message his confirmation of the deposited funds.
(Tr. 126-127)
Applicant  utilized  several  of  his  accounts  at  multiple  U.S.  banks  for  these
transactions. (Tr. 159, 170-171; GE 2 at 3, 9) He mostly used an account at Bank A, an
account  that  was  largely  a  business  bank  account  for  his  and  his  wife’s  company,
Company  H.  (Tr.  114,  123,  208-213;  GE  5)  Applicant  also  testified  that  he  used  the
Bank A account for his own personal and household expenses. (Tr. 235-236)
Applicant  testified  that  he  would  wire  funds  for  Mr.  E  to  various  foreign  bank
accounts,  in  South  Africa,  China,  and  Turkey,  as  well  as  Nigeria.  (Tr.  129-130,  160,
175-176,  184,  243-244;  GE  2  at  9)  Applicant  did  not  know  any  of  the  people  he
transacted  with.  (Tr.  130)  The  deposits  often  involved  large  sums  of  money,  almost
always well over $10,000 and at times over $100,000. (Tr. 130-131, 156-158, 173, 202)
Applicant would then wire the  deposited  funds to  Mr. E’s client,  the  travel company, or
to other foreign accounts. (GE 4 at 2) Most of the finds were in U.S. dollars but some of
the funds were in “naira,” a Nigerian currency. (Tr. 143-146)
Applicant testified  that  he  kept his wife  informed  about the  transactions with  Mr.
E. (Tr. 148-153) The  app  transcript confirms this. (GE 4  at 1, GE  4  at 5) (“Please  talk to
[Applicant’s wife]  about it.”)  By  mid-November 2016, Applicant appears to  have  wanted
Company  H to  be more formally  involved  with  the money  transfers.  As he  told Mr. E  in a
text on  November 9, 2016, however, he recognized  that Company  H  was not “licensed
to  deal  in  currency. Otherwise any  account  will eventually  be  flagged  if funds  (especially
large   amounts)  are  consistently   wired   out  of  the   country.  This  will   need   to   be   sorted
properly to ensure this is sustainable.” (GE 4  at 5)
A week later, that is exactly what happened, as Applicant reported to Mr E that
the  bank  had  closed  the  account  and  refunded  him  the  balance  by  check.  (Tr.  56-60,
189-194; GE 2 at 9; GE 4 at 5) Applicant said in his background interview that he  told
Mr. E to stop arranging the deposits, but they continued for a time. (GE 2 at 9)
As  late  as  December  15,  2016,  though,  Applicant  was  still  pursuing  a  role  for
Company H in the process. (“The document still  doesn’t state what [Company H’s] role
is  in  this  process;  when  [Company  H’s]  role  is  established,  there’s  still  the  issue  of
licensing to deal in / distribute currency here in the U.S.”) (GE 4 at 5)
Applicant said he  had  one  more phone  call  with  Mr. E  after December 2016, but
has had  no  contact  with  him  since  then.  Applicant’s wife  no  longer has contact  with  Mr
E. (Tr. 205-207) Applicant and Mr. E never met. (Tr. 225)
Applicant  was  interviewed  by  the  FBI  in  2017,  and  cooperated  with  their
investigation.  He  said  in  his  background  interview  that  the  FBI  told  him  that  the
transactions suggested possible money laundering or a scam. Neither Applicant nor his
wife were charged or arrested. (GE 2 at 9; Tr. 205, 229)
Applicant  testified  that  at  the  time  he  began  the  transactions  with  Mr.  E,  he
“thought nothing of it” because it “seemed like something legitimate” (50-51) He said he
“just thought I was doing my wife’s family a favor. And then it turned into a nightmare.”
(Tr. 75) Applicant also testified that while he was engaged in the transactions with Mr.
E, he became concerned about them. He testified that he “didn’t want to have anything
to  do  with  any kind  of  fraud.  I  told  him  this on  numerous occasions.” He  said  the  only
reason he did it was because his wife recommended it. (Tr. 241, 242)
Applicant did not list Mr. E as a foreign contact on his SCA, nor did he list any of
the large financial transactions they had. (GE 1) In particular, Applicant did not disclose
his relationship with Mr. E in answering questions on his SCA such as “Have you EVER
provided financial support for any foreign national?”; and “Have you in the last seven (7)
years provided advice or support to any individual associated with a foreign business or
other  foreign  organization  that  you  have  not  previously  listed  as  a  former  employer?”
and “Has any foreign national in the last seven (7) years offered you a job, asked you to
work  as  a  consultant  or  consider  employment  with  them?”  and  “Have  you  in  the  last
seven  (7)  years  been  involved  in  any  other  type  of  business  venture  with  a  foreign
national  not  described  above  (own,  co-own,  serve  as  business  consultant,  provide
financial  support,  etc.)”  (GE  1  at  29-30)  Applicant  answered  “No”  to  all  of  these
questions. Falsification of Applicant’s SCA is not alleged in the SOR under Guideline E,
but this evidence can be considered in weighing mitigation and under the whole-person
concept.
Applicant also did not disclose the transactions with Mr. E during his background
interviews and did not discuss them until he was confronted about them.  (Tr. 147-148,
207;  GE  1,  GE  2,  GE  3)  Applicant  indicated  that  he  did  not  initially  disclose  the
transactions  because  he  assumed  the  government  already  knew  about  them.  He  was
also embarrassed about them and wanted to be done with the issue. (GE 2 at 8-9)
Applicant has a cousin in Nigeria (Mr. O) to whom he is particularly close. (SOR ¶
1.c) Mr. O  is “like a  brother”  to  him. (Tr. 241)  Mr. O was born  in Nigeria. He  lived  in the
United  States from   1990   to  about 2017. He is a   dual U.S.-Nigerian   citizen.  (Tr.  46-47,
89)  (In  addressing  the  admissibility  of  GE  2  and  GE  3, Applicant’s background  interview
summaries,  Applicant  adopted  them  as accurate  except  where they  describe  Mr. O  as  a
Nigerian   citizen   only.)   (Tr.  38-40)   In   fact,   the   summaries  indicate   that  Applicant
described Mr. O as a dual citizen. (See, e.g., GE 2 at 6))
Applicant  saw  Mr.  O  on  his  trip  to  Nigeria  in  2020.  He  said  the  cousin  owns  a
farm. (Tr. 68-69, 215, 225) Applicant acknowledged that they are close and they remain
in quarterly contact. (Tr. 90-91)
In early January 2019, Applicant made several deposits into U.S. bank accounts,
using funds from his cousin Mr. O. The deposits totaled about $72,000. Applicant used
the money to purchase a luxury vehicle for Mr. O in the U.S., and to ship the vehicle to
him  in  Nigeria.  (SOR  ¶  2.b)  (Tr.  60-62;  214-218,  227-229;  GE  2  at  6)  Applicant
acknowledged  that  “there  are  probably  only  two  or  three  people  that  I  would  even
entertain  buying  a  car  for  now  in  hindsight.  And  [Mr.  O]  is  one  of  them.”  (Tr.  240)
Applicant otherwise denied that he had ever wired money to Mr. O, and denied that Mr
O was involved with the transactions Applicant had with Mr. E. (Tr. 219)
Applicant  had  engaged  in  similar  conduct  previously.  As  addressed  in  the
summary of Applicant’s April 5, 2019 background interview, Applicant has made similar
purchases on his father’s behalf  about three times in recent years, with funds his father
deposited in Applicant’s bank account. (Tr. 219-223; GE 2 at 10-11) Those transactions
were not alleged in the SOR.
Applicant also bought a sport utility vehicle for a friend in Nigeria in 2009 or 2010,
and shipped the vehicle to him there, using about $58,000 in funds the friend deposited,
in multiple deposits, in  Applicant’s U.S. bank account.  (Tr. 86-89; GE 2 at 7) Applicant
testified that he has made no  other wire transfers to any foreign companies or people.
(Tr. 223-224) These transactions are not alleged in the SOR.
Applicant denied  doing  anything  illegal. (Tr. 64) He never suspected  his  actions
might  be   problematic  until  he   was  contacted   by   the   FBI.  (GE  2   at  9)  Applicant  also
testified   that  there  was  “no   chance   in  hell”  that  he   would  again   engage   in  financial
transactions  like   he   did   in  2016   with   Mr.  E,   because   “I’m   living   [in]  hell   already.”  (Tr.
239)  “I would never do  that again. Never,” he  said. (Tr. 241)
Applicant testified that his allegiance is to the United States, and it “wouldn’t even
be a hard decision for me.” (Tr. 262) He has spent his adult life here. He has returned to
Nigeria only three times since emigrating to the U.S. He recognizes his poor judgment
in hindsight and said he would not engage in that conduct again. (Tr. 261-266)
Applicant  provided  reference  letters  from  several  personal  friends  and  work
colleagues. They have all known him for 12-15 years, and attest to his trustworthiness,
discipline,  and  dedication  to  his  work;  as  well  as  his  honesty  and  ability  to  protect
sensitive information. (AE A)
Nigeria
Nigeria is a federal republic located in Western Africa. Its current president took
office in 2015, following the first democratic transfer of power in the country’s history. He

sectarian conflicts, crime, kidnapping, and widespread mistrust of the government.
The  U.S. State  Department  advises  U.S.  citizens  to  reconsider travel to  Nigeria
due to COVID-19, crime, terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, and maritime crimes.  Boko
Haram and ISIS-West Africa, both U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations, are
active  in  Nigeria,  and  seek  to  replace  the  Nigerian  government  with  an  Islamic  state.

Scammers  almost  always  pose  as  U.S.  citizens  who  have  no  one  else  to  turn to for
help.  Common  scams  include:  romance/online  dating;  money  transfers;  contracts  with
promises of large commissions; and inheritance notices. The fact that money transfers
are prevalent scams in Nigeria is of particular relevance in this case.
Human-rights  issues  in  Nigeria  in  recent  years  have  included  unlawful  and
arbitrary  killings,  forced  disappearances,  torture  by  both  government  and  non-state
actors,  and  arbitrary  detention,  often  based  on  little  evidence.  Nigeria  has  one  of  the
world’s lowest per capita social spending levels, resulting in sixty-five percent of its 186
million  citizens  living  in  extreme  poverty.  These  conditions  breed disaffection  in  youth,
provide an entry point for Islamic extremism, entice corruption, and promote ineffective
governance.
",False
"Applicant  admitted  both  of  the  SOR  allegations  with  explanations.  After  a
thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  testimony,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant is 38 years old, divorced, and has one child. He is applying for national
security  eligibility  and  a  security  clearance  in  connection  with  his  proposed  overseas
employment  with  a  defense  contractor.  This  is  his  first  application  for  a  security
clearance. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, 17, and 18; Tr. 37-38, 42-43.)
Paragraph 1 – Guideline B (Foreign Influence)
Applicant was born in Iraq in 1983. He has two brothers, who currently live in the
United  States  and  are  naturalized  American  citizens.  His  parents,  sister,  ex-wife,  and
eight-year-old  son  are  all  citizens  and  residents  of  Iraq.  (Government  Exhibit  1  at
Sections 17 and 18; Applicant Exhibit I.)
Applicant  went  to  college  in  Iraq,  graduating  with  a  degree  in  engineering  in
2005.  From  2006  through  early  2012  Applicant  worked  for  various  private  contractors
supporting  American forces  in  Iraq.  Applicant  primarily  worked  in  the  Green  Zone  and
on other bases. Occasionally he came under mortar fire during his time working for the
American forces. Applicant immigrated to the United States in 2012 under a special visa
program  for  Iraqis  who  had  worked  with  American  forces.  Applicant  became  an
American  citizen  on  April  20,  2017.  (Government  Exhibit  1  at  Section  13A;  Applicant
Exhibits C, E, and H; Tr. 18-19, 32-36.)
Applicant  received  a  Master’s  degree  in  Engineering  from  a  major  American
university in 2015. He has worked as a civil engineer in the Public Works Department of
a mid-size American city since 2018. He makes a good salary at his job, enabling him to
pay all of his bills in a timely fashion.  (Government Exhibit 1 at Section 13A; Applicant
Exhibits A, B, F, G, J, and K; Tr. 19-21, 31, 36.)
As stated, Applicant’s parents, son and sister are citizens and residents of Iraq.
None of them have connections to the Iraqi government. Applicant has been working for
several  years  to  have  these  people  immigrate  to  the  United  States.  None  of  them
currently  have  permission  to  relocate  to  the  United  States.  Processing  of  the  petitions
for the immigration of his family stopped in 2017, pursuant to the actions of the United
States  Government.  Just  recently  the  processing  may  have  begun  again.  (Applicant
Exhibits L, M, R, S, and T; Tr. 17-18, 22, 25, 38-39, 50-51.)
Applicant was in regular contact with his parents and son before he was issued
the  SOR  in  September  2020.  Since  that  time  he  has  cut  off  communication  with  his
family. Applicant has no contact with his ex-wife. (Government Exhibit 2; Tr. 26-29, 31.)
Applicant  has  both  an  active  American  passport  and  active  Iraqi  passport.  He
used his Iraqi passport in preference to his American passport when he traveled to Iraq
in 2017, 2018, and 2019. Applicant inadvertently left off of his e-QIP the fact that he had
traveled to Iraq in 2019. Applicant stated on the e-QIP, “I only used the Iraqi passport
when  I  enter  my  country  to  avoid  the  visa  fee.”  (Government  Exhibit  1  at  Sections  10
and 20C, Government Exhibit 2; Applicant Exhibit C; Tr. 23-25, 38-42.)
Applicant  testified  that  he  would  not  do  anything  to  harm  the  United  States.  He
further stated that his loyalty lies, “Absolutely America.” (Tr. 30.)
Mitigation
Applicant has been a successful employee at his current employment. His annual
evaluations  show  him  to  be  a  talented  and  diligent  engineer.  (Applicant  Exhibits  A,  F,
and G.)
Applicant  submitted  several  letters  of  recommendation  from  people  who  know
him on a personal and professional level. Applicant Exhibit D contains three letters. The
first  two  are  from  friends.  The  third  is  from  a  colleague  who  worked  with  Applicant  in
Iraq. The Applicant is described as “an excellent, intelligent and articulate Engineer.”
Applicant Exhibit P contains an additional letter of recommendation from another
work  colleague  of  Applicant  in  Iraq,  who  worked  for  the  U.S.  military  for  many  years.
The  letter  writer  states,  “[My]  sincere  opinion  that  there  was  no  better  former  Iraqi
Engineer to support and trust with a US Security Clearance, and to entrust with further
missions in his former region.”
Iraq
I take administrative notice of the following facts: In 2003, The United States led
a  coalition  to  remove  Saddam  Hussein  from  power  in  Iraq.  After  free  elections,  Iraq’s
new  government  took  office.  Despite  the  elections  and  new  government,  Iraq  remains
engulfed  in  violence,  perpetrated  by  Al  Qaeda  terrorists  and  other  insurgents.
Numerous attacks and kidnappings have targeted the U.S. Armed Forces, contractors,
and other civilians, as well as Iraqis. Even with aggressive governmental action against
terrorists,  the  threat  of  terrorism  in  Iraq  remains  high.  Terrorist  groups  conduct
intelligence  activities  as  effectively  as  state  intelligence  services.  (Hearing  Exhibit  I:
Attachments.)
",True
"Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  his  e-QIP  unless  otherwise
indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of
the  pleadings,  including  Applicant’s  admissions  in  his  Answer,  his  testimony,  and  the
documentary evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 40 years old. He was adopted at the age of four and grew up in poverty.
He has married and divorced twice (2000 to 2005 and 2005 to 2013). He remarried for a
third  time  in  2013  and  has  one  child,  age  11,  with  his  current  wife.  He  has  four  other
children, ages 19 to 27, from prior marriages and other relationships. Applicant works as
a  training  coordinator  instructing  hospital  personnel  on  the  use  of  new  health-care
software. He began this job about seven months ago. He served in the U.S. Navy Reserve
on active duty from 2000 to 2004 and again in 2012 to 2014. He was on Inactive Reserve
duty from 2004 to 2008. He received an honorable discharge from active duty in 2004. In
2014, he was suffering from several stressful circumstances and failed to report for duty.
He  was  subsequently  discharged  and  received  a  general  discharge  under  honorable
conditions. Applicant attended an online university from July 2008 to 2013. He received
an  associate’s degree. The university subsequently lost its accreditation.  (Tr. at 25-36,
72; GE 2 at 1, 2.)
Following  his  discharge  from  the  Navy  in  2004,  Applicant  did  not  have  any
significant  employment  opportunities.  He  experienced  periods  of  unemployment  and
homelessness, starting in 2007. He also met his current wife in 2007 while still married to
his second wife. He and his current wife were homeless together for about three years,
including  living  on  the  streets  for  about  eight  months.  When  the  couple  had  a  child  in
2010, he was able to afford a home for his family. Over the years preceding 2012, he
incurred  a financial  obligation  for arrearages  in  his  child-support  payments  for his four
oldest children totaling about $70,000. He is presently paying down the arrearage every
month. He currently owes about $65,000. For many years, he was unsuccessful finding
good-paying jobs because of his child-support delinquency, which appeared on his credit
report and was checked by prospective employers. (Tr. at 73-79.)
For  ease  of  discussion,  the  SOR  allegations  will  not  be  discussed  in  the  order
alleged in the SOR.
Paragraph 2, Guideline E, Personal Conduct
The Illegal Alien Status of Applicant’s Wife
In  his  Answer,  Applicant  admitted  the  single  allegation  under  Guideline  E.  The
allegation is as follows:
a.  You are married to and living with your wife, who has illegally remained
in the U.S. since the expiration of her visa in 2007.
The factual background regarding this allegation is the following. Applicant married
his second wife in 2005 after his first discharge from the Navy Reserve. She was a citizen
of Uzbekistan. Applicant testified that “she  was pretty hot,” and he did not want to  lose
her. He sponsored her to obtain resident alien status in the United States. As soon as she
received her permanent resident card, she left him to be with a man who was Russian.
Applicant felt used by her. (Tr. at 43-55.)
In  2007,  Applicant  met  his  current  wife,  a  Russian  citizen.  She  did  not  have  a
permanent resident card and her visa was about to expire. He was reluctant to take on
the responsibility of helping another woman from the former U.S.S.R. obtain legal status
to  remain  in  the  United  States  and  risk  being  used  again.  Eventually,  the  relationship
developed, and he came to realize that she was not with him so that he could help her
obtain a green card and U.S. citizenship. He was, however, experiencing serious financial
and employment problems and could not afford to help her change her immigration status.
Over the  subsequent years, she  was  ineligible  to  work in  the  United States and never
tried to do so. They began looking for help on her status in 2012, two years after the birth
of their child. But even then, Applicant still had debts he could not pay, including the large
child-support arrearage. They looked at her immigration status again in 2017 and hired
an attorney. Applicant’s financial problems prevented them from taking any further steps.
They began exploring the necessary steps to change her status a month or two prior to
the hearing. He testified that he was “100% positive” that he would be filing the necessary
papers to start the process during the following four weeks. He was given until June 18,
2021, to produce evidence of his filing. He did not include any immigration documents
with his June 14, 2021 submission. (Tr. at 43-55, 70-74, 121.)
Paragraph 1, Guideline B, Foreign Influence
Applicant’s Wife and her Russian Family Members
In  his  Answer,  Applicant  admitted  the  four  allegations  under  Guideline  B.  The
allegations are as follows:
a.  Applicant’s  wife  is a  Russian  citizen. As noted, she  resides  illegally  in the  United
States. She  is an  ethnic minority  from  Siberia  and  is ethnically  Asian  rather than  Russian.
Her  ethnic  group   is  the   subject  of  significant  societal   prejudice  and   mistreatment  in
Russia. One  reason  she  left Russia  and  has  stayed  away despite  multiple  hardships of
living in the United States without a valid visa is that she believes the alternative of living
in Russia  would be  worse.  She  strongly  supports  the  United  States  and  is  opposed  to  the
Russian   Government.  Her  only   significant   connection   to   Russia   is through   her  mother
because  her mother lives there. By  way  of  background, she  grew  up  in a  Siberian  village
of  300  to  400  people.  She  graduated  from  high  school and  went to  university in Moscow,
earning  a  master’s  degree  in history. She  also  served  in the  Russian  military. At age  21,
she  traveled  to  the  United  States for the  first  time  on  a  four-month  summer work  visa. She
returned   to   Russia   on   time   as  required.  Two   years   later,  in  2007,   she   traveled   to   the
United  States  again on  a  similar summer work visa. Then  she  met Applicant and  decided
to  stay  with  him, even  though  he  was homeless at that time. She  overstayed  her visa two
months after meeting  Applicant.  She  was seeking  to  escape  from  an  abusive   personal
relationship  in  Russia.  Three  years later,  she  and  Applicant had  a  child. She  was 27  at
the  time. She  has not  returned  to  Russia  in the  last  14  years. She  is now  37  years old.
She  suffers from  rheumatoid arthritis and  is confined  to  a  wheelchair. (Tr. at 36-50, 59-
60, 66-67, 71-72.)
b.
Applicant’s  mother-in-law  (MIL)  is  a  citizen  and  resident  of  Russia.  Like  her
daughter, she  is  part of  an  ethnic minority living in  Siberia.  Her husband,  the father of
Applicant’s wife, is deceased. In addition to Applicant’s wife, MIL has two other children,
a  son  and  another  daughter.  MIL  is  72  years  old  and  is  a  retired  school  teacher.  Her
husband was also a school teacher. Neither Applicant nor his wife have ever sent money
to help support her mother or either of  her  two  siblings.  MIL  has never worked  for the
Russian Government. She and Applicant’s wife have a strained relationship because of
her daughter’s decision to leave Russia and marry a U.S. citizen who was homeless and
unable to support his wife. In the last 14 years, they have talked on the phone about 12
times.  The  have  communicated  a  little  more  frequently  through  the  Internet.  MIL  has
never met her grandchild in person, though she has seen the child on computer or phone
screens.  MIL  does  not  speak  English  and  Applicant  does  not  speak  Russian  or  MIL’s
native ethnic language. (Tr. at 51-59, 65.)
c.
Applicant’s brother-in-law (BIL) is a citizen and resident of Russia. Applicant has
seen him three times over video screens around the holidays. He works as an engineer,
to the best of Applicant’s knowledge. He has never worked for the Russian Government.
BIL rarely communicates with Applicant’s wife because they have a difficult relationship.
BIL and Applicant’s sister-in-law (SIL) helped pay for their sister’s education, and they are
upset with her that she left Russia and her family behind to live in a country where she
cannot  even  work  legally.  BIL  and  SIL  have  told  her  to  come  home  and  have  asked
Applicant’s wife why she is still living in the United States. In the past 14 years, Applicant’s
wife has talked with her siblings on the phone only 12 to 14 times. These conversations
typically end poorly with Applicant’s wife feeling badly. (Tr. at 60.)
d.  SIL is a citizen and resident of Russia. Applicant has seen her two times over
video screens around the holidays. The last Applicant knew, SIL worked as an accountant
for the business of a family friend. She has never worked for the Russian Government.
Applicant’s wife has not spoken with her sister in three years. (Tr. at 61.)
Administrative Notice
Russia  has  a  highly  centralized,  authoritarian  political  system  dominated  by  its
President.  Russian  intelligence  services  target  the  United  States  seeking  to  collect
intelligence,  erode  U.S.  democracy,  undermine  U.S.  national  policies  and  foreign
relationships, and increase Russia’s global position and influence. The U.S. Government
assesses Russia as posing a cyber espionage, influence, and attack threat to the United
States  and  as  having  interfered  in  the  integrity  of  U.S.  elections.  Russia  continues  to
occupy  and  purports  to  have  annexed  Ukraine’s  Crimean  Peninsula.  The  Russian
Government has engaged in significant human rights abuses of its citizens.
Paragraph 3, Guideline F, Financial Considerations
SOR Debts
The SOR alleges that Applicant is delinquent on debts owed to 17 creditors in the
total amount of about $29,000. In his Answer, Applicant admitted ten of the SOR debts
and totaling about $24,000. The SOR debts, Applicant’s response to each allegation in
his Answer, and the record evidence regarding each debt are described below.
3.a.  Admitted medical  account  in the  amount  of  $105.  Applicant has not  paid  this debt.
He wrote  in AE  I,  his June  14, 2021  email,  that he  has been  unable  to  learn more about
his medical bills. See  3.n,  below, for further information. This  debt  is  not  resolved.  (Tr.
at  80-81; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 2; GE 6 at 6; AE I.)
3.b.  Denied  medical-account  in  the  amount  of  $425.  Applicant  has not  paid  this debt.
At  the   hearing,  he   was  unable   to  explain   why   he   disputed   this   debt  in his Answer.   He
wrote  in  his  June  14,  2021  email  that he  has  been  unable  to  learn  more about  his  medical
bills. See  3.n, below, for further information. This  debt  is  not  resolved.  (Tr. at 81-85; GE
4 at 2;  GE 6 at 6; AE I.)
3.c.   Admitted  education  loan   account   in  the   amount   of   $1,737.   Applicant’s  six
education  loans that  are  the  subject of  SOR subparagraphs 3.c  through  3.h  were opened
during  the  period  November 2011  through  January  2013.  He  repaid  the  student loans  for
about four months and  then  stopped. They  became  delinquent in 2015. In  his Answer, he
admitted  he was delinquent on  this debt and  his other student loans. (Answer at 1, 2; Tr.
at 88-93; GE  2 at 5; GE 3 at 3; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 2; GE 6 at 8.)
A class-action lawsuit was filed against the university attended by Applicant, and
he is a member of the class. Applicant wrote in his Answer that his university has “been
ordered to eliminate debt owed [by its students] as part of the [lawsuit].” The basis of the
litigation was that the university had engaged in fraudulent student recruitment activity.
Applicant testified that he is hoping to have these student loan debts removed from his
credit. Applicant attached a document to his Answer that states that the university has
agreed  in the  settlement “to write to request deletion of any negative credit events it
reported about you [Applicant] from January 1, 2008 to December 15, 2016.” (Emphasis
added.)  Applicant  actually  paid  his  tuition  using  the  GI  Bill.  Separately,  the  funds  he
borrowed were paid to him, not to the university. There is nothing in the record to suggest
that Applicant  borrowed  any funds from  or through  the university or  that the university
reported any negative credit events about Applicant to a credit bureau. The credit reports
in the record state that the loans have been assigned to U.S. Department of Education
(DOE) for collection and that they were originally “Direct Loans,” which are Federal loans.
(Answer at 2, 11; Tr. at 88-93; GE 2 at 5.)
Applicant has been trying to figure out how he can take advantage of the settlement
of  the class-action lawsuit to extinguish his student-loan debt owed to  DOE, assuming
that is even possible. The document he attached to his Answer specifically states that the
settlement does  not  “affect your ability to  claim debt forgiveness  or submit a Borrower
Defense  to  Repayment  claim”  based  upon  the  legal  theories  alleged  in  the  litigation.
Applicant presented no evidence suggesting that he has taken any such actions. (Answer
at 11.)
There  is  also  no  documentary evidence  in  the  record  that  the  settlement  would
result in the extinguishment of any student loans incurred by Settlement Class Members
from any sources or the removal of those debts from the credit reports of the members.
Applicant  has  not  shown  that  he  made  a  demand  on  the  university  that  it  request  the
deletion  of  any  negative  information  it  may  have  reported  to  the  credit  bureaus.  In  his
post-hearing email, Applicant asserts that he has been advised by a representative of the
university that it will submit at a later date a request to the credit bureaus to remove the
student-loan debts. (AE A.)
In his post-hearing submission, Applicant provided a copy of a court order, dated
October 8, 2020, approving the settlement of the class-action lawsuit. The order does not
include  the  actual  Settlement  Agreement  of  the  litigation,  which  provides  the  specific
terms of the relief or payments to be awarded to each “Settlement Class Member.” The
order does note at paragraph 20 that checks sent to Settlement Class Members that were
not  cashed  within  90  days  would  be  forfeited,  which  suggests  that  the  relief  from  the
settlement fund of about $45,000,000 would be in the form of payments to the members.
There is no evidence, documentary or otherwise, in the record as to whether Applicant
timely submitted the required Claim Form to receive a payment, whether he received that
class-action settlement payment, and whether he timely cashed the check. (AE A.)
Applicant is not prioritizing  the  repayment of  his delinquent student  loans at this
time.  He is  saving  the  available funds to  help  pay  for his wife’s naturalization  as a  U.S.
citizen. In  his background  interview, Applicant claimed  that  he  was waiting  to  repay  these
loans until  after the  U.S. Department of Veteran’s Affairs pays its portion  of his education
expenses. This statement is inconsistent with  his hearing  testimony  about the  class-action
litigation.  Based  upon  the  record  evidence,  Applicant  remains  liable  on  this  student  loan
and  the  others. This  debt  has  not  been resolved.  (Answer at 11; Tr. at 88-93; GE  2  at
5; AE A.; AE  I.)
3.d-3.h.  Admitted education loan accounts  in the  amount  of  $4,005;  $2,001;  $2,917;
$1,951;  and $9,055, respectively.  Applicant has not paid these  debts. See  3.c, above.
These  debts  have  not  been  resolved.  (GE 3 at 3-4; GE 4 at 2; GE 5 at 2; GE 6 at 9.)
3.i.  Admitted Credit  Account  in the  amount  of  $144.  Applicant  wrote  in his Answer that
he  intends to  pay  this  debt  when  he  receives his next paycheck, and  in  any  event,  prior
to  his  hearing. In  his October 2018  background  interview, he  reported  that  this  debt was
paid  in  2014   and   that   he   had   an   account  with   this  bank,  which  was  in  current  status.
Applicant testified  that  he  paid  off  this debt and  would  provide  evidence  of the  payment
in a  post-hearing  submission. In  his post-hearing  email, Applicant again asserted  that this
debt  has been  paid, though  he  did  not say  when  he  made  the  payment.  He  wrote  that the
creditor advised  him  that it could not  provide  evidence  of the  payment in a  timely  manner.
The  Government’s February  12, 2021  Equifax  credit report in the  record (GE 3) continues
to  list this debt as unpaid.  Applicant has  not provided  sufficient  evidence  of  payment,  such
as a  copy  of  a  check or a  credit-card  statement.  Applicant  has  not documented that
this  debt  has  been resolved.  (Answer at 2; Tr. at 93-94; GE  2  at 4; GE  3  at 2; GE  4  at
4; GE 6  at 9; AE I.)
3.j.   Denied  utility   account   in  the   amount   of   $347.   Applicant  disputes   this  debt  as
fraudulent.  In  his Answer, he  claimed  that his roommate  at the  time  put this electric bill in
Applicant’s  name   without  his  permission   after  Applicant   left  the   premises.   Applicant
testified  that he  and  his wife  never had  an  account with  this creditor.  He also said that he
confronted   his  former  roommate  and  determined   that the   roommate   had   nothing  to   do
with  this debt.  He  testified  that  he  has  disputed  the  bill with  the  credit  bureaus,  but  he  has
not  contacted  the  creditor and  asked  for a  record of this bill  or otherwise disputed  the  debt
directly   with   the   creditor.  The   Government’s   most   recent  credit  report,   GE   3,   does   not
reflect that this bill is disputed. Applicant wrote  in his post-hearing  email  that he  recently
called  the  utility  company  and  disputed  the  debt.  He was advised  that  it would be  removed
from  his credit in  30  to  60  days. This  debt  is  being  resolved.  (Answer at 2;  Tr. at 94-97;
GE 3  at 6; GE 4  at 5-6; GE 5 at 2; GE 6 at 8.; AE B; AE C; AE D; AE  I.)
3.k.  Denied fitness  center account  in the  amount  of  $406.  Applicant disputes this debt
for monthly   membership  fees  at   a   fitness  center for months   after  he  had   canceled   his
membership  and relocated to another  state.  He claims that the center’s manager agreed
that  the   bill  was  an   error.  The   debt   has  since   been   eliminated   from   the   Government’s
most  recent credit reports, i.e., GE  3, 4  and  5. This  debt  has  been  resolved.  (Answer at
2; Tr. at 98-99; GE 6 at 6.)
3.l.  Admitted communications  account  in the  amount  of  $235. This debt is for internet
and  cable equipment that Applicant failed  to  return after moving  out of  an  apartment. After
learning  that  this  debt  was on  his credit  report, he  returned  the  equipment  and  paid  $100.
The  debt does not appear on  the  Government’s more recent credit report, GE  3. This
debt has been resolved.  (Answer at 2; Tr. at 99-100; GE 6  at 6.)
3.m.  Denied medical account in the amount of $423. Applicant has not paid this debt.
At  the   hearing,  he   was  unable  to   explain   why   he   disputed   the   debt  in  his  Answer.   He
wrote  in  his  June  14,  2021  email  that he  has  been  unable  to  learn  more about  his  medical
bills. See  3.n, below, for further information.  This  debt  is  not  resolved.  (Tr. at  81-85; GE

3.n.  Admitted medical account  in the  amount  of  $1,988.  Applicant testified  that this
debt or one  of  the  other large  medical debts was not actually  incurred  for medical services.
He entered  this  debt into  the  hospital’s  records as part of  his training  on  how  to  use  the
hospital billing  system  software,  and  he  failed  to  delete  the  debt when  the  training  was
completed. He has not  taken  any  steps, however, to  correct the  bill. In  his background
interview, he  reported  that  he  has  high  blood  pressure  and  has sought care  at  hospital
emergency   rooms  on   several  occasions.  He   acknowledged   that  he   had   some   unpaid
medical  bills  due   to   his  condition   and   emergency   treatment.   This   debt   has   not   been
resolved.  (Tr. at 83-88; GE  2 at 5; GE 6 at 7.)
3.o.  Denied medical  account  in the  amount  of  $958.  At the  hearing, he  was unable to
explain  why  he  disputed  the  debt  in his Answer.  He wrote  in his June  14, 2021  email  that
he   has  been   unable  to   learn  more   about  his  medical  bills.  See   3.n,  above,  for  further
information.  This debt is not resolved.  (Tr. at 81-85; GE 6  at 7; AE  I.)
3.p.  Denied medical account  in  the  amount  of  $1,106. At the  hearing, he  was unable
to  explain  why  he  disputed  the  debt in  his Answer. He wrote  in his June  14, 2021  email
that he  has been  unable  to  learn more about his medical bills. See  3.n, above, for further
information.  This debt is not resolved.  (Tr. at 81-85; GE 6  at 7.)
3.q.   Denied  residential  rental  account   in  the   amount   of   $1,125.  Applicant  and   his
family   lived   in  this  apartment  complex   starting   in  2010   after  about  three   years  of
homelessness. This debt is for cleaning  fees  at the  end  of  the  rental  term. The  landlord
claimed   that  Applicant   left  the   apartment   in   poor  condition.   Applicant  claims  that   the
landlord  or the  apartment complex  manager engaged  in  predatory  leasing  practices.  He
hired  a  debt-resolution  law  firm  to  assist  him  with  this debt.  He does not  know  what the
firm  did  to  resolve  this debt. The  debt  has  since  been  eliminated  from  the  Government’s
most recent credit reports.  In his October 2018 background interview, he reported that
the debt was no longer enforceable because it was more than seven years old. Applicant
has not produced any evidence to show that he has taken steps to pay or resolve this
debt.  Moreover,  he  has  not  produced  any  documents  substantiating  the  basis  of  this
dispute. This debt is not resolved. (Answer at 2; Tr. at 101-105; GE 2 at 4; GE 6 at 9.)
Applicant is current with his ongoing bills today. He earns about $75,000 per year.
He  pays  his  car  loan  and  child-support  arrearage  every  month.  He  is  budgeting  his
expenses and saving money to pay for his wife’s visa and U.S. citizenship. He plans to
go through that process without legal help to save money. He is hopeful that his wife will
be successful even though she has overstayed her visa since 2007. (Tr.at 105-109.)

"The  amended  SOR  alleges  under  Guideline  B,  foreign  influence,  that  Applicant
maintains  contact  with  an  intelligence  officer  serving  in  the  IDF  (SOR  ¶  1.a)  and  that
Applicant’s sister is a dual citizen of Israel and the United States residing in Israel (SOR
¶  1.b).  Applicant  admitted  the  allegations,  but  she  also  stated  that  she  believes  the
Israeli military officer’s service had ended by the time the March 2020 SOR was issued
or will end in 2020; and she completed her initial security clearance application before
her  sister  had  moved  to  Israel.  Applicant’s  admissions  to  having  had  foreign  contact
with  the  IDF  officer  and  to  the  Israeli  citizenship  and  residency  of  her  sister  are
incorporated as findings of fact. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript,
I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  26-year-old  U.S.  native-born  citizen  with  a  bachelor’s  degree
earned in December 2016 from a prestigious private university in the United States. She
has  been  employed  by  her  current  employer,  a  U.S.-based  defense  contractor,  since
late  January  2017.  She  completed  an  internal  three-year  engineering  leadership
development program (ELDP) with her employer, and during that program, she earned
her master’s degree  in  chemical and aerospace engineering. She currently works as a
senior systems engineer and seeks a top secret clearance. (GE 1; Tr. 19-21.) Because
of  the  time  it  has  taken  to  adjudicate  her  security-clearance  eligibility,  Applicant  has
taken  on  a  general  systems  engineering  management  role,  which  can  be  done  at  the
unclassified level. (Tr. 21.)
Applicant’s  parents  are  U.S.  native-born  citizens  and  residents  of  the  United
States.  Applicant  was  raised  in  the  United  States  with  her  two  sisters,  who  are  now
ages 24 and 29. In 2017, Applicant’s older sister moved to Israel for a summer job as a
gymnastics instructor. (GE 1; Tr. 19, 32.) At the end of that summer, she was offered a
full-time job, and she elected to remain in Israel. (Tr. 32-33.) She subsequently obtained
Israeli  citizenship  and  is  a  dual  citizen  of  Israel  and  the  United  States.  (GE  1.)
Applicant’s  sister  is  employed  as  a  medical  writer  for  a  technology  company  in  Israel.
She is dating her current roommate,  who is a dual U.S.-Israeli citizen employed as an
engineer by a U.S.-based corporation in Israel. (Tr. 21-22.) Applicant states that she is
not particularly close  to  her older sister  (Tr. 19), explaining  that  “childhood  resentment
evolved into just a long-distance tolerance of each other.” (Tr. 28.) Applicant’s sister did
not share with Applicant that she had become a dual citizen. When asked by the DOD
about  her  sister’s  citizenship  status,  Applicant  made  an  inquiry  of  her  parents  and
learned  that  her  sister  had  acquired  her  Israeli  citizenship.  (Tr.  20.)  Applicant  has
weekly contact with her sister in Israel during family “teleconference” calls in which their
parents  and  sister  also  participate.  Monthly  to  once  every  few  months,  Applicant  has
additional contact  with  her sister by social  media.  (Tr.  23-24.)  Applicant  had  in-person
contact  with  her  older  sister  during  family  vacations  to  Europe  in  July  2018  and  July
2019. She has not seen her sister since the July 2019 trip. (Tr. 24-25.) Applicant plans
to continue to participate in the weekly family video gatherings with her sister because it
makes her mother happy. Applicant sees no reason to change her current relationship
with her sister. (Tr. 31-32.)
Applicant  went  to  Israel for a few weeks  from  December 2016  to January 2017
on  a  “Birthright  [Israel] organized  trip,”  which  was  designed  to  introduce  young Jewish
adults to Israel. Applicant and the other Americans on the program were joined by six or
seven college-age Israelis, including some off-duty members of the IDF. For a week to
ten days, the participants rode a bus together across Israel to various tourist sites and
went to a chemical forensics laboratory on an IDF base. (GE 1; Tr. 28-29.) After the trip
ended, Applicant maintained contact with some of the program’s participants, including
an intelligence officer in the IDF. She and the IDF officer had some common interests,
and  she  contacted  him  monthly  by  text  messaging  and  social  media  through  August
2019.  (Tr.  26-27,  30.)  She  reported  her  contacts  with  the  Israeli  national  when  she
completed a March 2017 SF 86 for a secret clearance (Tr. 31) and on an August 2019
SF  86  for  a  top  secret  clearance.  (GE  1;  Tr.  18-19.)  She  made  him  aware  that  she
reported him as a foreign contact on her SF 86  forms. By the time she completed her
August  2019  SF  86,  he  had  shared  with  her  that  he  was  leaving  the  IDF  to  pursue  a
master’s degree and possibly a doctorate degree. She does not know for certain that he
is no longer serving in the IDF. Applicant has had no contact with him since “sometime
in 2019.” (Tr. 26-27). They “grew apart” and stopped communicating. (Tr. 30.) Applicant
does not currently have any contact with any member of the IDF. (Tr. 33.)
Neither  Applicant  nor  her  family  members  living  in  the  United  States  own  any
financial  assets,  including  any  property,  in  Israel.  (Tr.  27.)  Applicant  has  no  current
plans to travel to Israel in the future. (Tr. 24.)
Administrative Notice
Administrative notice is not taken of the source documents in their entirety, but of
specific facts properly noticed and relevant and material to the issues.  Concerning the
facts submitted for administrative notice in GE 2, I take administrative notice of the facts
requested by the Government, as supplemented by the following facts:
Israel is a vibrant parliamentary democracy with a modern economy. Despite the
instability and armed conflict that have marked Israel’s relations within the region since
it  came  into  existence,  Israel  has  developed  a  robust,  diversified,  and  technologically
advanced  market  economy.  Nationwide  elections  in  April  2019,  September  2019,  and
March 2020 were considered free and fair but failed to form a coalition government. The
political stalemate was resolved in April 2020 with the current Prime Minister, Benjamin
Netanyahu,  to  remain  in  office  until  October  2021,  when  Blue  and  White  party  leader
Benny Gantz is scheduled to succeed him.
The   relationship  between   Israel  and   the   United   States   is  friendly   and   yet
complex.  Since   1948,   the   United   States   and   Israel   have   had   a   close   friendship   based
on   common   democratic  values,  religious  affinities,  and   security   interests.   Successive
U.S.  Administrations   and   Congress  have   demonstrated   a   commitment   to   Israel’s
security   and   to   maintaining   close   bilateral  ties.   Israel  is  considered   a   critical  ally   and
friend  of  the  United  States. The  United  States recognized  Jerusalem  as Israel’s capital
in  December  2017   without  taking   a   position   on   Israel’s  sovereign   boundaries.  The
relocation  of  the  U.S. Embassy  to  Jerusalem  in May  2018  was greeted  warmly  by  Israel
but  rejected   by   Palestinians  and   many   other   international actors.  The   United   States  is
Israel’s largest single-country  trading  partner. Israel is a  leading  recipient  of U.S.  foreign
aid and is a  frequent purchaser  of  major U.S. weapons systems.
Israel and  the  United  States do  not have  a  mutual defense  agreement,  although
the  United  States remains committed  to  Israel’s security   and  well-being, predicated  on
Israel maintaining   a   “qualitative  military  edge” over other countries in its region.   Strong
U.S.  congressional  support  for  Israel  resulted   in  the   country   being   designated   as  a
“major non-NATO  ally” in  1989  and   receiving   preferential treatment   in  bidding   for U.S.
defense   contracts   and   access   to   expanded   weapons   systems  at   lower  prices.
Significant cooperation  exists in military  aid,  arms sales,  joint  exercises,  and  information
sharing.  Legislation   in   the   U.S.  Congress  frequently   includes  proposals  to   strengthen
U.S.-Israeli   cooperation,  such   as   the   U.S.-Israel  Security   Assistance   Authorization   Act
of 2018.
Yet,  the  interests of  the  two  countries are not always aligned.  The  sales of U.S.
defense   articles  or  services  to   Israel  and   other  foreign   countries  is  subject  to   the
provisions  of   the   Arms  Export  Control   Act,   which  predicates   eligibility   for  purchase   on
agreements  not  to   use   purchased   items  or  training   for  purposes  other  than   those
permitted   by   the   act  or  to   transfer  them   to   third-party   countries  (except  under  certain
conditions) without the  prior consent of the  U.S. President.  The  United  States has acted
to   restrict  aid  and/or  rebuked   Israel  in  the   past   for  possible   improper  use   of   U.S.-
supplied   military   equipment.   Israeli-U.S.  relations  were  strained   between   Israeli   Prime
Minister Netanyahu’s second  administration  and  the  Obama  Administration, particularly
over  Israeli   settlements  in  the   West  Bank   and   the   Iran   Nuclear   Deal.   Negotiations
between  Israel and  the  Palestinians  have  been  complicated  by  Israeli  actions,  including
a   July   2018   law   by   the   Knesset  which  defined   Israel  as   the   national  homeland   of   the
Jewish  people  and  by   Israeli   settlement activity   in  the  West  Bank. Israel  is threatened
by   Iran;   Iranian-sponsored   non-state   actors,  such   as  the   Lebanese   Shiite   group
Hizb’allah; and  violent jihadist  terrorist groups in the  region,  such  as the  Islamic State.
Israel’s  concerns  about  a   nuclear-weapons-capable   Iran   as  an   imminent  threat  to   its
security   have   led   Israel  to   criticize   the   international  agreement   on   Iran’s   nuclear
program   when   it  was  negotiated   in  2015   and   to   welcome  the   Trump   Administration’s
withdrawal of the United States from  that agreement in May 2018.
The  United  States  has also  expressed  concern  about  Israel’s  sales  of  sensitive
security  equipment  and  technology,  especially  to  China.  Since  the  1980s,  there  have
been  at  least  three  cases  in  which  U.S.  government  employees  were  convicted  of
disclosing classified information to Israel or of conspiracy to act as an Israeli agent (e.g.,
Jonathan  Pollard  in  1985,  who  Israel  has  acknowledged  acted  as  its  agent).  U.S.
government contractors have also been implicated in providing classified and sensitive
information to Israel.
The  security  situation  remains  complex  in Israel, the  West Bank,  and  Gaza.  The
U.S.  recognition   of  Jerusalem   as   Israel’s  capital   in   December  2017   and   of   Israel’s
sovereignty  over the  Golan  Heights  in March 2019,  and  the  U.S.  failure to  condemn  as
illegal  Israeli   settlements  in  the   West  Bank,  have   led   to   a   recent  rise   in  anti-U.S.
sentiment,  especially   in  the   West   Bank.   Throughout  2019,  hostile  organizations
associated   with   designated   terrorist  groups  (Hizb’allah,  the   Popular  Front  for  the
Liberation  of Palestine (PFLP), Hamas,  and  the  Palestinian Islamic Jihad  (PIJ))  and  Iran
launched  mortars, rockets,   and   incendiary   devices  into   Israel.  In   September 2020,  the
U.S.  State   Department  raised   the   travel  advisory   for  Israel,  the   West   Bank  and   Gaza
from   Level  2   to   Level  3.  Travelers  are   advised   to   reconsider  travel  to   Israel  and   the
West  Bank  and  to  avoid all  travel to  Gaza  due  to  COVID-19, terrorism  and  civil  unrest,
and   with   respect  to   Gaza   also  armed   conflict.   Terrorist  groups  and   known   lone-wolf
terrorists continue plotting possible attacks in  Israel, the  West Bank, and Gaza, and  they
target  tourist  locations,  markets,   transportation   hubs,  and   local  government  facilities.
Gaza   is  under  the   control  of   Hamas,  a   U.S.-designated   foreign   terrorist  organization.
During   2019,  Palestinian   militant  groups  launched   1,340   rockets  and   mortars from   the
Gaza  Strip  toward arbitrary  or civilian  targets in  Israel, killing  six  and  injuring  more  than
150. Jerusalem  and  Tel Aviv  are considered  high-threat locations for terrorism  directed
at or affecting official U.S.-government interests.
Persons seeking to enter or depart Israel, the West Bank, or Gaza are reminded
as of January 2021 that they are subject to immigration and security screening, possibly
including  prolonged  questioning  and  physical  searches,  and  that  they  may  be  denied
entry  or  exit.  Israeli  security  officials  have  on  occasion  requested  access  to  travelers’
personal  email  accounts  or  other  social  media  accounts  as  a  condition  of  entry.
Travelers  are  advised  that  they  should  have  no  expectation  of  privacy  for  any  data
stored on their devices or in their accounts under those circumstances.
Civilian authorities in Israel maintained effective control over security services in
Israel  in  2019.  Significant  human  rights  issues  in  Israel  in  2019  included  reports  of
unlawful  or  arbitrary  killings  by  Palestinian  terrorist  groups  in  Israel.  The  Israeli
intelligence  community  reported  having  thwarted  more  than  500  attempted  terrorist
attacks in 2019. Israeli forces killed Palestinians in the West Bank who were attempting
or  allegedly  attempting  to  attack  Israelis,  but  reportedly  some  of  those  killed  did  not
pose a lethal threat at the time. Human rights groups alleged that the Israeli government
sometimes used excessive force resulting in the deaths of  several Palestinians. Israeli
security personnel reportedly used  “special interrogation methods” (beatings, threats of
rape  and  physical  harm,  pressure  from  restraints,  and  sleep  deprivation)  against
Palestinian  security  detainees  in  the  West  Bank.  However,  Israel’s  government  took
steps to prosecute and punish officials who committed abuses within Israel regardless
of rank or seniority.
",True
"The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  provides  approximately $300  per  month  to  two
resident citizens of the Philippines (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.b) and $200 a month to another resident
citizen  of  the  country  (SOR  ¶  1.c).  Applicant  admitted  that  he  continues  to  provide
financial support for the Phillippe women in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b, whom he met online ten
years  ago.  He  described  them  as  “extremely  poor”  and  indicated  that  his  “targeted
humanitarian aid” for them is “just enough for food assistance and minimal shelter so they
do not live on the streets.” He stated that if he suspected they were being exploited in an
effort to leverage him, he would contact security immediately.  He admitted that he had
previously provided financial support for a third Philippine woman (SOR ¶ 1.c), whom he
met online seven years ago. He has not provided her any financial assistance in over a
year, and they no longer communicate.
Applicant’s admissions to having befriended and provided financial support to the
three  Philippine  women  are  accepted  and  incorporated  in  my  factual  findings.  After
considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following additional findings
of fact.
Applicant  is  a   48-year-old  senior electrical  engineer.  He  has  never  married   and
has no  children. A  college  graduate  with  a  bachelor’s degree  in electrical and  computer
engineering  earned  in  May  1997,  he  took  a  hiatus from  his  career and  was unemployed
from  July  2004  to  May 2008  while  focusing  on  attaining  a  more healthy weight.  Applicant
has worked  for his current employer, a  defense  contractor, since  September 2016. (GE
1.)
On November 10, 2016, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for National Security
Positions  (SF  86)  for  security  clearance  eligibility.  In  response  to  an  SF  86  inquiry
concerning any close or continuing contacts with a foreign national in the last seven years,
Applicant listed three women in the Philippines. He also answered affirmatively to an SF
86  inquiry  concerning  whether  he  had  ever  provided  financial  support  for  any  foreign
national.  His  SF  86  disclosures  about  these  women,  including  about  his  contacts  with
them, and his financial support for them, follow.
Foreign contact #1 (SOR ¶ 1.a)
Applicant met this woman online in a chatroom October 2009 when he was looking
for a new relationship. (GE 1; Tr. 32.) Their contacts quickly turned from the chatroom to
texts on the phone. (Tr. 33, 40.) She is a single mother and a resident citizen of her native
Philippines. As of November 2016, she was selling mostly perfume at a boutique for her
employment. Applicant indicated on his SF 86 that he had a romantic interest in her at
one time (See also Tr. 46), but their  relationship had  evolved  into  “online  friends of [a]
semi-romantic nature” as of November 2016.  (GE 1.) He now asserts that he “was just
looking for people to talk with.” (Tr. 33.) He had sent her photos of himself at one time.
(Tr. 46.) Applicant indicated on his SF 86 that he was helping her out “periodically due to
her poor economic condition” and that he had contact with her by text messaging two or
three times a month “to catch up on what’s happening in [their] personal lives.” Applicant
estimated on his SF 86 that he had provided her with some financial support on a monthly
basis and had given her about $10,000 total over the years he has known her. (GE 1.)
His support for her started early on with $50 to purchase some food after she lost her
employment. By 2012 or 2013, he was sending her $300 a month, usually in response to
a request for rent money. (Tr. 35, 54.) Previously, she would contact him randomly and
ask for money for food. (Tr. 53-55.)
Foreign contact #2 (SOR ¶ 1.b)
Applicant met this resident citizen of the Philippines online in the same chatroom
in October 2009 when he was looking for a romantic interest. As with female friend #1,
his contacts with female friend #2 went quickly to text messaging. (Tr. 44.) He reported
on his SF 86 that his romantic interest in her quickly waned, but he also described their
relationship as “online friends of [a] semi-romantic nature.” As with female friend #1, he
provided  her  some  photos  of  himself.  (Tr.  46.)  They  stayed  in  touch  over  the  years,
primarily by electronic means, about a couple times a month. A single mother, she was
cleaning houses in her town as of November 2016. Applicant “helped her through some
rough times financially with food/medical bills when needed.” (GE 1.) His support started
with small amounts but after a few years, it  became $300 a month. (Tr. 46.)  Applicant
estimated on his SF 86 that he had provided her with some financial support on a monthly
basis and had given her about $6,000 total over the years he has known her. (GE 1.)
Foreign contact #3 (SOR ¶ 1.c)
As of November 2016, Applicant had what he describes as “a romantic interest” in
a resident citizen of the Philippines whom he met online through a chatroom in November
2012. (GE 1; Tr. 48-49.) They were in contact almost daily by texting, primarily about food
and entertainment. Now age 28, she was unemployed and living with a family friend. By
November  2016,  he  had  given  her  monthly  support  totaling  $8,000  because  she  was
struggling financially due to her lack of education and her mother’s death. (GE 1.)
Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the Office of Personnel
Management  (OPM)  on  June  29,  2018,  partially  about  his  listed  foreign  contacts.
Applicant reported that he was still in contact by electronic means with the three women
in the Philippines; with female friends #1 and #2 weekly and with female friend #3 monthly.
He indicated about the foreign female friends that #1 was currently a full-time student;
that  #2  was cleaning  residences under “more  of a  handshake  agreement;” and  that #3
was  unemployed.  He  reported  sending  friends  #1  and  #2  each  $300  a  month  for
estimated  total  support  of  $15,700  to  friend  #1  and  $11,700  to  friend  #2,  and  $200  a
month to friend #3  for a  total of  $11,800  over the years. Applicant  related  that he had
never met these women in person. (GE 2.)
On July 3, 2018, Applicant was contacted telephonically by the OPM investigator
about possible foreign influence concerns. Applicant provided the birthdates, birthplaces,
and  current  addresses  in  the  Philippines  for  the  three  women.  (GE  2;  Tr.  34.)  The
addresses for female friends #2 and #3 were in cities in Mindanao, but not those reported
by the U.S. State Department as being at highest risk for terrorist activity. He denied he
could be blackmailed because his relationships with them are discrete, and because the
assistance he provides them is for food, shelter, and basic necessities to make their lives
easier.  He  views  his  support  as  aiding  the  less  fortunate  and  explained  that  he  is
continuing a  tradition of  helping others that  was  started  by his  grandmother.  Applicant
related  that  none  of  the  foreign  women  know  his  income  or  anything  about  his
employment other than that he works with computers. He admitted that no one is aware
of his contacts with these Philippine women because he texts the women on his private
phone. (GE 2.)
Applicant  did  not  cease  his  communication  with  or  support  for  the  Philippine
women  after he  started  working  for  the  defense  contractor because  he  did  not  think  it
appropriate to do so. He  testified that  he has  not witnessed any inconsistencies  in his
contacts  with  them  over  the  years.  (Tr.  30.)  He  has  continued  to  provide  both  of  the
Philippine female friends #1 and #2 $300 each month in financial support. (Tr. 57-58.) He
transfers  the  funds  through  a  website  that  uses  banks  as  payout  locations  in  the
Philippines. (Tr. 35-36, 46, 48.) He has tried to ensure that the money he sent over the
years was used for housing, food, and other items, such as a rice cooker, and he asked
for and was sent some photographs and receipts of some of the items purchased. (AE I;
Tr.  29-30,  37-38.)  He  helped  female  friend  #1  with  her  education  by  providing  some
money for class  materials  and  some  placement  test fees.  (Tr. 42-43.)  Apparently,  she
completed her degree and was then able to find employment, but only for a month or two
before the pandemic hit and she lost her job. (Tr. 62-63.) Some of the financial support
for female friend #2 went to medical care for her and dental care for her daughter. (AE I.)
There have been occasions when the Philippine women have asked him for money to
purchase something but there was a limit on how much he was willing to give. (Tr. 55.)
Applicant communicates with Philippine female friend #1 weekly, usually about her
situation and the weather. (Tr. 33, 46.) She is not employed currently. She had a job doing
secretarial work for a small company and took some college courses before she lost her
job in the pandemic and moved with her son near her parents in a small house in the
mountains. (AE I; Tr. 36-37.) She does not pay rent but is billed for electricity and water,
which together costs her $50 to $100 a month. Applicant understands that her small home
is “gifted by the town.” (Tr. 38.) Several years ago, female friend #1 asked him for money
to purchase “a motorcycle or something or a bike to get around,” and he refused her. (Tr.
55-56.)
Applicant communicates with Philippine female friend #2 weekly. (Tr. 45.) She has
a daughter who lives with her. (AE I; Tr. 46.) Due to the pandemic, female friend #2 is not
currently employed. She has not completed high school and has found her job prospects
limited to cleaning or laundry duties. Her rent costs her “roughly $100” per month. (Tr. 47-
48.)
Applicant  has  not  had  any  communication  with,  or  provided  any  money  to,  the
Philippine  woman  #3  since  sometime  in  2019.  (AE  B;  Tr.  51-52.)  She  is  romantically
involved with someone else. (AE B.) Applicant took that as her needs were being met,
and she no longer needed his assistance. (Tr. 52.)
Applicant has not tried to provide any financial support for the women through a
charitable organization for the following reasons:
I wasn’t aware of  any  that I trusted. Charities,  I don’t, it’s hit or miss on  how
effective  specific charities are,  [and]  they  tend  to  capture all  of the  proceeds
for their  own  management.  And  so, there’s very  few  charities that I would
trust.  . . Especially in that area of the world, you know, [it’s]  more likely that
they  would embezzle or, you  know, to  capture [those]  proceeds themselves.
(Tr. 41.)
Applicant cannot  recall  any  specific instance  where he  has  told  anyone  about his
financial  support  for  the  Philippine  women, although  he  had  perhaps  mentioned  it to  a  co-
worker who  runs a  charity  in the  United  States. He asked  his friend  how  he  deals with
donations, but it wasn’t applicable  to  the  Philippines. (Tr. 58-59.) Applicant testified  that
the  $600  in monthly  financial support is “not that great of  a  burden” for him. (Tr. 63.) He
has mentioned  to  both  of  them  that he  would  like  them  to  become  more  self-sufficient.
(Tr. 64.) He has not  proposed  a  cut-off  date  for his financial support.  If  able,  he  intends to
continue  to  provide the  financial support  for female  friends #1 and #2  for the  foreseeable
future. (Tr. 65.)
Applicant  testified  that  he  would  report  any  suspicious  activity  immediately.  (Tr.
67.) Because of the difficulties living in the Philippines, he has advised his female friends
there to stay off the streets and only go to the market when it is necessary. To the extent
that there is a security risk because of his foreign contacts in the Philippines, he considers
them mitigated in part because of the security protocols at his workplace. He understands
that travel to the Philippines is ill-advised and has no plans to travel there. (AE H.)
Work Performance
Applicant  held  an  interim  security  clearance  from  March  2017  until  it  was
withdrawn because of the April 2020 SOR. (Tr. 31.) During that time, he worked on a few
classified programs but his work did not routinely require classified access. (Tr. 28.) He
had to decline an April 2021 request for subject matter expert support at a facility located
in another part of the United States because he does not currently hold a clearance. (AE
G; Tr. 28-29.) He estimates that only about 10 to 20 percent of his work would require
classified access. (Tr. 32.)
Applicant’s performance evaluations for 2017 through 2019 show that he has been
a  highly  effective  contributor  since  he  started  his  employment.  He  is  a  subject  matter
expert  in  boundary  scan  tests.  Dedicated  and  detailed  in  his  work,  he  has  become  a
valuable member of the organization. He has been eager to learn and willing to help his
teammates. (AEs D-F.)
Administrative Notice
Administrative notice is not taken of the source documents in their entirety, but of
specific facts properly noticed and relevant and material to the issues. After reviewing the
source documents relied on by the Government, I have taken administrative notice of the
facts set forth in the  Government’s October 26, 2020  request and  incorporate  them  by
reference  in  this  decision,  as  updated  and  supplemented  by  more  recent  State
Department  reports.  For  additional  background  investigation  regarding  the  Philippines
relationship  with  the  United  States,  I  reviewed  the  U.S.  State  Department’s  website,
including  its  Bilateral  Relations  Fact  Sheet,  issued  for  the  Philippines  on  January  21,
2020. Of note, some of the source documentation relied on by the Government has been
updated. On March 30, 2021, the State Department issued its 2020 Country Reports on
Human Rights Practices: Philippines, and on April 20, 2021, the State Department issued
a Philippines Travel Advisory. On April 7, 2021, the State Department commented in a
press briefing about recent moves by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in the South
China Sea and their impact on the Philippine-U.S.  relationship. Salient facts about the
Philippines include the following.
The Philippines is a multiparty, constitutional republic with a bicameral legislature.
Midterm  elections  in  May  2019  were  generally  seen  as  free  and  fair.  U.S.-Philippine
relations are based on strong historical and cultural links and a shared commitment to
democracy and human rights. The U.S. has designated the Philippines as a major Non-
NATO ally, and there are close and abiding security ties between the two nations. The
Manila Declaration signed in 2011 reaffirmed the 1951 U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense
Treaty as the foundation for a robust, balanced, and responsive security partnership. The
U.S.-Philippine  Bilateral  Strategic  Dialogue  advances  discussion  and  cooperation  on
bilateral,  regional,  and  global  issues.  The  United  States  has  provided  considerable
assistance to the Philippines toward the goals of strengthening democratic governance
and  supporting  Philippine  government  efforts  to  promote  inclusive  development  and
contribute  to  security  and  development  cooperation  in  the  Indo-Pacific.  There  are  an
estimated  four  million  U.S.  citizens  of  Philippine  ancestry  in  the  U.S.,  and  more  than
220,000 U.S. citizens in the Philippines, including a large presence of U.S. veterans.
The  United  States  continues  to  provide  disaster  relief  and  recovery  to  the
Philippines. The two countries have a strong trade and investment relationship, and are
members of many of the same international organizations, including the United Nations.
In response to the PRC recently amassing militia in the South China Sea, the U.S. shares
the concerns of its Philippine ally. On April 7, 2021, the United States reiterated its strong
support for the Philippines. The Biden Administration would consider any armed attack
against  the  Philippines  as  a  trigger for the  U.S.’  obligations  under the  U.S.-Philippines
Mutual Defense Treaty.
Since the 1980s, several individuals or entities, including some American citizens
of  Philippine  birth,  have  engaged  in  criminal  espionage  of  classified  information  or
sensitive technologies (economic espionage) to the Philippines. An intelligence analyst
with the Federal Bureau of Investigation was convicted in 2006 of conspiracy to transmit
national  defense  information,  transmission  of  national  defense  information,  unlawful
retention  of  national  defense  information,  and  unauthorized  use  of  a  computer,  for
unlawfully  obtaining  and  passing  classified  documents  and  information  to  Philippine
government officials starting in August 2000. He had been recruited, and he committed
the crimes out of a sense of loyalty to his native Philippines. More recent illegal activity
involved  the  unlawful  export  of  firearms,  including  some  high  powered  military-grade
weapons and assault weapon components, to the Philippines. There is no report in the
record of any economic espionage activity involving the Philippines since October 2013.
For  more  than  a  decade,  terrorists,  insurgents,  and  criminal  actors  carried  out
major attacks against civilians, primarily in southern Mindanao and the islands of Basilan
and Sulu. In 2019, the Philippines was one of the top ten countries with the most terrorist
incidents  and  casualties.  Since  January  2019,  there  have  been  multiple  bombings  in
Mindanao resulting in injuries and deaths, including dual suicide bombings on August 24,
2020.  In  March 2020, the  State  Department’s  Bureau  of  Diplomatic  Security  assessed
Manila as being at medium threat for crime and a high threat for terrorism directed at or
affecting official U.S. interests. Terrorist groups, such as the New People’s Army (NPA),
the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG), and Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), and elements within the two
main insurgent groups, the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) and the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF), continued to pose a security threat. On April 24, 2021, the United
States raised the threat level for travel to the Philippines from Level 3 to Level 4-do not
travel, due to COVID-19. The travel advisory for the Sulu Archipelago and to Marawi City
in Mindanao remained at Level 4 due to crime, terrorism, civil unrest, and kidnapping in
the Archipelago and terrorism and civil unrest in Marawi City. Terrorists and armed groups
continue  to  conduct  kidnappings  on  land  and  at  sea  for  ransom,  bombings,  and  other
attacks  targeting  U.S.  citizens,  foreigners,  civilians,  local  government  institutions,  and
security  forces  in  the  Archipelago.  Conflicts  between  remnants  of  terrorist  groups  and
Philippine security forces in Marawi present a risk of death or injury to civilians. The State
Department also advises that travel be reconsidered to other parts of Mindanao, where
the Philippine government maintains a state of emergency and greater police presence
due to kidnappings, bombings, and other attacks by terrorist and armed groups.

the  country,  shares  responsibility
The  State  Department  designated  the  Philippines  as  a  major  money-laundering
jurisdiction in 2019. Insurgents operating in the country derive funding from kidnapping
for  ransom  and  narcotics  and  arms  trafficking.  The  Philippine  National  Police,  which

maintains
counterterrorism  and  counterinsurgency  operations  with  the  Armed  Forces  of  the
Philippines. The Armed Forces has some domestic security functions in regions of high
conflict,  such  as  Mindanao.  There  were  numerous  reports  that  government  security
agencies  and  their  informal  allies  committed  arbitrary  or  unlawful  killings  in  2020  in
connection  with  the  government-directed  campaign  against  illegal  drugs.  Killings  of
activists, judicial officials, local government leaders, and journalists by government allies,
antigovernment insurgents, and unknown assailants continued in 2020. Police impunity
for killings was widely suspected. Other significant human rights issues in 2020 included
reported forced disappearance by and on behalf of the government and non-state actors;
harsh  and  life-threatening  prison  conditions;  arbitrary  detention  by  the  government;
prosecutions  of  journalists  and  censorship;  and  corruption.  The  police  investigated  a
limited number of complaints of human rights abuses. Slow judicial processes remained
an obstacle to bringing to justice government officials alleged to have committed human
rights abuses.

Post-hearing, Applicant submitted  a  base  newspaper article profiling  his work as
a   linguist  in   Iraq.  Applicant  is   quoted   in   the   article,   “.   .  .  the   United   States   saved   Iraq

2009   letter  of   recommendation   from   his  former  defense   contractor  program   manager.
These   letters  of   recommendation   were  positive   and   are  best  summed   up   by   his  base
contracting  officer, “In  reading  all  the  past  documentation,  I can  confidently  state  that  all

Guideline B – Foreign Influence
Applicant  was  born  in  Afghanistan   in  1986.    He  moved   between   Iran,  Pakistan,
and   Afghanistan   until he  emigrated   to   the   U.S.  in   March 2011.   Applicant   came  to  the
U.S.  on   a   K-1   fiance   visa.     He  was  married   to   this  wife   from   March  2011   until  they
divorced in April 2015.  Applicant became a U.S. citizen in September 2017.  He has not
taken   any   action   to   renounce   his  Afghan   citizenship.     Applicant’s   parents,  seven
brothers,  and   four  sisters  are  citizens  and   residents  of   Afghanistan.    Applicant  stated
that he  sent money  to  his family  in Afghanistan  four or five  times, totaling  about $5,000
until  about  2017,
During   his  April  2019
Counterintelligence   screening   with   the   U.S  Army,  Applicant  reported   speaking   with   his
mother  on   a   weekly   basis,  his  father  on   a   monthly   basis,  and   his  siblings  anywhere
between   monthly   and   annually.    In   his  answer  to   the   SOR   dated   January   2020,
Applicant stated that he is “not in contact with his family members at any level.”
to   help  provide
their   support.
In about November 2017 Applicant and his girlfriend, a citizen of China, moved in
together.  Applicant’s  girlfriend  was  pregnant  with  another  man’s  child.  About  five
months after her child was born, Applicant’s girlfriend sent her baby son to live with her
parents  in  China.  Applicant’s  close  relationship  and  cohabitation  with  his  girlfriend
made her aware of his background investigation and the fact that he was applying for a
job  with  the  U.S.  government.  Applicant  underwent  a  Counterintelligence  screening
with  the  U.S.  Army  on  April  2019.  During  that  screening,  which  asked  him  about
contact with any foreign national, he disclosed his Chinese-national landlords, but failed
to  mention  his  girlfriend.
(Government  Exhibit  5.)  Applicant  also  failed  to  list  his
girlfriend  as  a  foreign  contact  or  a  cohabitant  on  his  April  2019  security  clearance
application.  (Government  Exhibit  4.)
It  was  not  until  May  2019  during  his  personal
subject interview that he admitted to living with a Chinese citizen since November 2017.
(Government Exhibit 8.)  It was about this time that Applicant’s girlfriend’s parents came
to  visit  their daughter along with  her young son.  Applicant  met  his  girlfriend’s parents
but never revealed the relationship to his own family and friend because he did not want
them  to  know  he  was  dating  a  Chinese  woman  who  was  pregnant  when  they  met.
Applicant’s  Answer  to  the  SOR  indicates  that  he  ended  the  relationship  with  his
girlfriend  in  July  2019,  when  he  deployed  to  Afghanistan  to  work  as  a  linguist.
(Government Exhibit 2.)
Guideline F – Financial Considerations
Applicant  is  indebted  to  five  creditors  listed  in  the  SOR,  totaling  in  excess  of
$53,000.  He  admits  each  of  the  allegations  set  forth  in  the  SOR  under  this  guideline.
Applicant’s  credit  reports  dated  April  27,  2019,  and  May  27,  2020,  confirm  this
indebtedness.  (Government Exhibits 6 and 7.)
In October or November 2017, after becoming a U.S. citizen, Applicant started a
food  truck  business  with  a  friend.  To  fund  the  project,  Applicant  took  out  a  personal
loan  in  the  amount  of  $30,000 from  one  lender, and  a  personal  loan  in  the  amount  of
$15,000 from another lender.  (Government Exhibit 8.)  The business failed within a few
months.  Applicant’s  business  partner,  his  friend,  returned  to  Afghanistan.  Shortly
thereafter, Applicant defaulted on both personal loans.  He was also unable to pay his
credit  card  bills.  Since  then,  Applicant  has  been  unable  to  resolve  his  delinquent
accounts.  He  believes  that  his  job  as  a  linguist  will  allow  him  to  pay  his  debts.
(Government Exhibit 2.)
Applicant’s  financial  distress  became  apparent  after  his  failed  business.  The
debt became  overwhelming, and he stopped making payments on his debts.  He tried
calling  a  debt  relief  company,  but  thought  it  was  a  scam  and  never  followed  through.
He  has  made  no  attempt  to  repay  the  debt.  He  states  that  he  plans  to  pay  his  debt
when he starts earning more money.
The following debts set forth in the SOR became delinquent and are of security
significance:  2.a.  A credit card account was charged off in the amount of approximately
$4,323.  2.b.  A debt owed to a creditor was charged off in the amount of approximately
$750.  2.c.  A debt owed to a creditor was charged off in the amount of  approximately
$3,648.  2.d.  A debt owed to a creditor was charged off in the amount of approximately
$16,553.  2.e.  A  debt  owed  to  a  creditor  was  charged  off  in  the  amount  of
approximately $30,000.  2.e.  A debt owed to a creditor was charged off in the amount
of approximately $14,987.

country   of   Afghanistan,   which  includes   the   Government’s  briefs  and   supportive
documents on  the  country  of  Afghanistan.   In  2001,  the  United  States led  a  coalition  to
remove   the   Taliban   from   power  in  Afghanistan.  Afghanistan   remains  an   important
partner with  the  United  States in the  fight against  terrorism, and  has  been  designated  a
Major Non-NATO Ally. However, numerous attacks and  kidnappings have  targeted  the
U.S.  Armed   Forces,  contractors,  and   other  civilians,  as  well   as  Afghans.  Even   with
aggressive  governmental action  against  terrorists,  the  threat of  terrorism  in  Afghanistan
remains   high.   Terrorist  groups   conduct  intelligence   activities  as   effectively   as  state
intelligence   services.   In   summary,  Afghanistan   provides  a   significant  and   heightened
security risk to the United States.
I have also taken administrative notice of the following information concerning the
country of the People’s Republic of China, which includes the Government’s briefs and
supportive  documents.  The  United  States  faces  a  continuing  threat  to  its  national
security  from  Chinese  intelligence  collections  operations.  More  than  90  percent  of  its
state-backed  economic  espionage  cases  and  two–thirds  of  its  theft  of  trade  secret
cases involve China.  China presents a persistent cyber espionage threat and a growing
attack threat to our core military and critical infrastructure systems, and China remains
the  most  active  strategic  competitor  responsible  for  cyber  espionage  against  the  U.S.
Government, corporations, and allies.

"Applicant is 48 years old. He was born in Somalia. In 1991, a civil war broke out in
Somalia, and Applicant’s mother and  younger brother were killed. He, along with other
family members, escaped on a fishing boat in 1992. They were taken to a refugee camp
in  Kenya.  In  May  1996,  when  he  was  about  23  years-old,  he  and his family  members
were brought to the United States as Somalian refugees. (Tr. 20-21, 82-83; GE 1, GE 2,

Applicant  attended  college  in  the  U.S.  from  1998  to  2004,  and  earned  an
associate’s degree and a bachelor’s degree in marketing. He became a naturalized U.S.
citizen in 2003, and he married his wife, who is a dual citizen of Kenya and the U.S., in
2004. He has two children, ages six and eight. His children are U.S. citizens. He currently
works for two different companies doing translations. In 2019, he earned approximately
$51,000  from  his  two  employers,  and  his  wife  earned  about  $105,000  as  a  registered
nurse.  In  2020,  he  only  earned  $28,000  due  to  the  lack  of  translation  work  from  the
immigration  courts  closure  from  the  Covid-19  pandemic,  and  his  wife  earned  about
$89,000. He is applying for a linguist position with a DOD contractor. His employment is
contingent on him obtaining a DOD security clearance. (Tr. 20-22, 47, 75-77; GE 1, GE

Foreign Influence:
Applicant has three sisters. Two of his sisters are naturalized citizens and residents
of the United States, and the third sister is a citizen of Sweden currently residing in the
United Kingdom. He also has four brothers. Three of his brothers are naturalized citizens
and  residents  of  the  United  States,  and  his  fourth  brother  is  a  citizen  and  resident  of
Somalia.  This  brother  had  previously  been  incarcerated  in  the  United  States  for  drug-
related offenses, but in the Fall of 2020, he was deported to Somalia. Applicant saw his
brother during his trip to Somalia in late 2020, after the death of his father. Applicant does
not have a good relationship with this brother, and he does not want anything to do with
him, to include continuing contacts or providing financial support. Applicant’s two sisters
and three brothers residing in the United States intend to remain in the United States, and
they have no future intentions to visit Somalia. (Tr. 32-34, 53-56, 79-80; GE 1, GE 2, GE

Applicant  has  numerous  cousins  who  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Somalia.
Approximately  four  of  these  cousins  receive  financial  support  from  Applicant  and  his
family members about two or three times a year. It is usually related to a relief effort, and
they have collectively sent much more money than $3,650 since 2013, as alleged in SOR
¶ 1.c. The two or three times a year Applicant contributes money for his cousins usually
range between  $100  and  $200  per occurrence. It is only  on  an  “as needed” basis and
Applicant does not maintain regular contact with these cousins. (Tr. 27-28, 35-36, 56-59,
80-81; GE 1, GE 2, GE 3)
Applicant  has  two  friends  who  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Somalia.  He
communicates with them on a casual, infrequent basis. For example, seven months may
go by without any communication, and then all of a sudden, they may talk two-to-three
times, followed by several months of no contact. Both of these friends are unaware that
he is in the process of applying for a DOD security clearance, and neither of them are
employed by the Somalian government. (Tr. 36-37, 59-62, 81-82; GE 1, GE 2, GE 3)
Applicant’s friend’s father became President of a federal state in Somalia in 2017.
This  individual  is  no  longer  in  this  political  position.  On  one  occasion  in  2017,  while
Applicant was staying  with his friend during a trip to Somalia, his  friend’s father asked
Applicant  to  come  with  him  and  visit  two  foreign  embassies.  He  wanted  Applicant’s
assistance in the event he needed English translation while conducting business at the
embassies. This was not an offer of employment, but a one-time request for assistance.
Applicant did not provide any translation service for his father’s friend on that particular
day.  He  was  never  asked  to  provide  his  assistance  again,  and  he  does  not  maintain
contact with this individual. (Tr. 37-43, 63-64, 82; GE 1, GE 2, GE 3)
The final SOR allegation under Guideline B alleges that Applicant’s mother-in-law
and  father-in-law  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Kenya.  Since  2011,  he  and  his  spouse
have provided approximately $25,000 in financial support to them. Applicant testified that
his mother-in-law is in the U.S. as a permanent resident. She is currently employed in a
childcare facility. Applicant and his spouse do not always need to provide financial support
to her because of her employment. Applicant’s father-in-law is a citizen and remains a
resident in Kenya. He intended to relocate to the U.S. a few years ago, but he had back
surgery  which  required  a  recovery period,  and  then  the  Covid-19  pandemic prevented
him from coming into the U.S. At the current time, Applicant and his spouse continue to
provide monthly financial support to him, between $100 and $200 on an approximately
monthly  basis.  His  father-in-law  still  plans  to  relocate  to  the  U.S.  at  some  point  in  the
future. (Tr. 28-29, 43-44, 64-66; GE 1, GE 2, GE 3)
In 2014, Applicant was approached by an associate to open a Somalian restaurant
in Ethiopia. Applicant saw this as a promising business opportunity and invested $3,500.
He  eventually lost  his investment money as the restaurant never opened. In 2016,  his
friend’s  father,  mentioned  above,  had  a  mining  business  in  Kenya  that  needed  to  be
reopened.  Applicant  and  his  friend  were  offered  employment  to  resurrect  the  mining
business.  Applicant  looked  into  this  business  prospect  and  was  willing  to  relocate  his
family to Kenya if the business venture looked profitable. After evaluating the business,
he realized that it did not have a favorable outlook and discarded the offer of employment.
(Tr. 23-24, 44-46, 67-70, 82, 84; GE 1, GE 2, GE 3)
Applicant traveled to the United Kingdom, Somalia, and  to Kenya twice in 2012.
He traveled to Sweden for four months to visit his sister, the United Kingdom, Somalia,
and to Kenya twice in 2013. In 2016, he traveled to Somalia and made two trips to Kenya,
and in 2017 he traveled to Somalia and made two trips to Kenya  once again. Some of
Applicant’s visits to Somalia and Kenya were extended stays. Applicant testified that he
travelled to Somalia and Kenya in 2019 and in late 2020. He does not have any plans to
visit Somalia in the future. He personally funded all of his trips overseas. (Tr. 24-27, 31;
GE 1, GE 2, GE 3)
Financial Considerations
Applicant  has  approximately  $44,000  in  student  loans  that  were  referred  for
collection. He testified that he attended college in the U.S. from 1998 to 2004, and took
out these loans to pay for his education.  He received an associate’s degree in 2000, and
earned  his  bachelor’s  degree  in  2004.  He  began  repaying  his  student  loans  after
graduation, but stopped all payments  in about 2007 after he lost his job. He called his
student loan creditor and requested a loan forbearance due to unemployment, which was
granted. (Tr. 46-49, 70-75; GE 1, GE 2, GE 3)
After Applicant found employment again,  he made a request to the student loan
creditor that his monthly payments be reduced due to limited income. This request was
denied, and eventually his student loans were referred for collection. Years passed and
in  about  2010,  Applicant  was  told  by  the  student  loan  creditor  that  he  needed  to
rehabilitate his defaulted student loans by paying about $470 a month for six months, and
then  his  monthly  payment  would  be  reduced.  He  made  approximately  three  monthly
payments on his delinquent student loans, but then he was contacted by the student loan
creditor and informed that he needed to increase his monthly payment as another student
loan  had  been  included  in  the  student  loan  rehabilitation  payment  plan.  Thereafter,
Applicant  stopped  making  all  loan  payments,  and  he  has  not  made  any  student  loan
payments in the last decade. He admitted sending monetary support over the years to
foreign  family  members,  investing  $3,500  in  a  failed  business  venture,  and  travelling
extensively overseas since defaulting on his student loans. (Tr. 46-51, 70-73; GE 1, GE
2, GE 3)
Applicant admitted that he had been contacted several times by different collection
companies requesting payment over the years. He denied, however, any recent contacts
from a creditor requesting payment for his defaulted student loans. Currently, Applicant
stated that he is unable to determine who holds his defaulted student loans after a recent
attempt to re-establish communication. He had a tax refund intercepted by the Federal
government in about 2010, but after that time, he has received all of his tax refunds when
eligible. Applicant stated that it is his intention to repay his defaulted student loans, but
he  did  not  provide  details  of  his  future  plan  of  action,  or  when  he  anticipated  making
payments.  He  did  not  provide  any  documentation  of  his  recent  communications  with
student loan creditors. He does not have any other delinquent debts. (Tr. 46-51, 70-74;
GE 1, GE 2, GE 3)

perform his work duties. He has been employed by his current employer since 2014 as
an Information Developer. (Item 3 at Sections 12, 13A, 17, and 18.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline B – Foreign Influence)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for  access
to sensitive information because he has foreign contacts or interests that might result in
divided  allegiance,  or  make  Applicant  vulnerable  to  pressure  or  coercion.  Applicant
admitted all allegations under this paragraph with explanations.
Applicant  was  born  in  Iran  in  1961.  He  received  his  Bachelor’s  degree  from  a
university  in  Iran  in  1987.  He  married  his wife  in  1993.  Applicant  moved  to  the  United

naturalized  American  citizen  in  2010.  Applicant’s  wife  and  son  are  also  American
citizens. (Item 3 at Sections 10, 12, 17, and 18.)
Applicant’s  mother,  sister,  and  four  brothers  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Iran.
One of his brothers is a dual-citizen of France and Iran, and splits his time between the
two countries. Applicant talks to his mother on a weekly basis and talks to his siblings
on approximately a quarterly basis. (Item 2.)
Applicant  was  interviewed  by  an  investigator  from  the  Office  of  Personnel
Management  (OPM)  on  May  2  and  3,  2019.  A  Report  of  Investigation  was  prepared.
Applicant  stated  to  the  investigator  that  he  owned  an  apartment  in  Iran  worth
approximately  $50,000.  Applicant’s  mother  lived  in  the  apartment  with  one  of  his
brothers  and  Applicant  intended  to  continue  owning  the  apartment  until  his  mother
passed  away  so  that  she  had  a  place  to  live.  In  Applicant  Exhibit  A  he  updated  the
information  to  state  that  his  mother  has  left  his  brother’s  home  and  is  now  living  with
Applicant’s  sister.  Applicant  stated,  “I  asked  my  brother  to  move  out  from  my  house
because  taking care  of  my mother was  our deal and  was  broken  by  them  [Applicant’s
brother and his wife]. I informed him that I intended to sell my house and he needed to
move out.” Applicant has stated that once the house is sold he will transfer the money to
the  United  States  and  use  it  for  a  down  payment  on  a  home  here.  (Item  4,  Applicant
Exhibit A.)
Applicant  also  stated  to  the  investigator  that  he  had  an  Iranian  passport  and
intended to renew it so that he could travel to Iran to see his mother. He also needed an
Iranian  passport  in  order  to  own  and  transfer  property.  Applicant  also  updated  this
information in his response to the FORM. He stated:
I  returned  my  Iranian  passport  to  the  Interests  Section  of  I.R.  [Islamic
Republic]  of  Iran  (Embassy  of  Pakistan  –  Washington  D.C.)  because  I
intended  to  renounce  my  Iranian  citizenship.  Per  their  officials,  this
process  might  take  2  years  or  even  more  that  is  expected  from  an
abnormal regime. They were supposed to send me confirmation letter but
they  have  not  yet.  Currently,  I  have  no  document  except  the  post  office
receipt. Hopefully, I would have enough time to sell my house and transfer
the money. (Item 3 at Section 10, Item 4; Applicant Exhibit A.)
Applicant’s mother-in-law is also a citizen and resident of Iran. Applicant obtained
lawful  permanent  resident  status  for  her  and  she  moved  to  the  United  States  at  one
point. However, she subsequently returned to Iran and currently lives there. (Item 4.)
Applicant  did  not  submit  any  evidence  concerning  the  quality  of  his  job
performance.  He  submitted  no  character  references  or  other  evidence  tending  to
establish  good  judgment,  trustworthiness,  or  reliability.  Applicant  did  not  supply  any
information  as  to  his  financial  situation  here  in  the  United  States.  I  was  unable  to
evaluate his credibility,  demeanor, or character in person  since he elected to have  his

Iran
I take administrative notice of the following facts about Iran:
Iran is an authoritarian theocratic republic. The U.S. Department of State advises
American  citizens  not  to  visit  Iran  due  to  the  very  high  risk  of  kidnapping,  arrest  and
detention of U.S. citizens in Iran, particularly dual national Iranian-Americans. Iran has
been  designated  a  state  sponsor  of  terrorism  since  1984.  Iran  continues  to  present  a
cyber-espionage  and  attack  threat.  The  Iranian  government’s  human-rights  record  is
extremely poor. There are numerous reports of unlawful killings, forced disappearances,
and torture. (Request for Administrative Notice: Attachments.)

"Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  his  SCA  unless  otherwise
indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings and the documentary evidence in the record, I make the following findings
of fact.
Applicant was born in the People’s Republic of China (China) and is 25 years old.
He has never married and has no children. His parents are divorced and he immigrated
to the United States in 2001 with his mother. His mother remarried a U.S.-born citizen of
the United States. Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in September 2014 at the
age of 18 and changed his last name to that of his stepfather, who had adopted him. He
was educated in the United States, graduating from high school in May 2014 and college
in December 2018. He was hired by a defense contractor and sponsored for a security
clearance  in  January  2019.  He  works  for  that  contractor  as  an  aeronautical  engineer.
(FORM Item 3.)
Applicant’s  birth  father is  a  citizen  and  resident  of  China.  Applicant  has  had  no
contact with his father since July 2000, when Applicant was four years old. He does not
know anything about his father’s work, relationship with the Chinese Government, if any,
or his personal life, including his address. (FORM Item 4 at 12, 15.)
Applicant’s maternal grandmother is a  citizen  and  resident of  China. He speaks
with her by phone every month. He visited her in China on three or four short trips during
the period 2012 through 2017. He noted in his SCA that the trips were for the purpose of
visiting family and friends. She is retired. The record is silent as to her prior employment.
(FORM Item 3 at 29; FORM Item 4 at 12, 15-16.)
In 2017, Applicant worked as a paid research intern for  the Chinese Automotive
Research Institute (Chinese Institute) for about three months that summer. This research
center  tests  the  durability  of  automotive  parts.  A  family  friend  was  a  manager  at  the
Chinese Institute and arranged Applicant’s summer internship. This person was referred
to  by Applicant as “uncle” even  though  he  is not actually related  to Applicant’s mother.
During his internship, Applicant had daily contact with the manager. In his background
interview, he claimed that he has had no contact with this person before his internship or
since the end of his internship in 2017. (FORM Item 4 at 14-15.)
Applicant omitted his employment with the Chinese Institute  in  his responses to
the question in Section 13A of his SCA titled “Employment Activities” and the question in
Section 20 B titled “Foreign Business, Professional Activities, and Foreign Government
Contacts.” He did not believe that he was required to list paid internships. He also failed
to mention this employment in his initial background interview. He reported to the second
government  investigator  who  conducted  a  follow-up  background  interview  that  the
omission  in  his  SCA  was  not  deliberate.  He  claimed  in  his  Answer  that  he  listed  the
internship  with  the  Chinese  Institute  on  his  employment  application  with  his  current
employer. Also, Applicant discussed in his initial background interview his short trips to
China  and  reported  they  were  with  his  family  for  the  purpose  of  visiting  his  maternal
grandmother. He failed to mention in his SCA or his initial background interview that his
trip to China in 2017 was for the entire summer when he worked at the Chinese Institute.

under this guideline. The allegations list Applicant’s birth father and maternal grandmother
as  citizens  and  residents  of  China.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b)  The  SOR  also  alleges
Applicant’s employment at the Chinese Institute during the summer of 2017. (SOR ¶ 1.c.)
Lastly, the SOR alleges that Applicant failed to disclose his employment with the Chinese
Institute in both his SCA (Section 20B) and in his initial background interview on March
18, 2019. (SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e.) In SOR ¶1.e, the Government alleges that it was not until
Applicant  was  confronted  with  the  information  about  his employment  with  the  Chinese
Institute, that he disclosed his foreign employment.
Under Guideline E, the SOR cross alleges as falsifications the information set forth
in subparagraphs 1.d and 1.e of the SOR.

I  take  administrative  notice  of  the  following  facts  about  China  as  set  forth  in
Department Counsel’s request and supported by the U.S. Government documents cited
in  and  attached  to  the  request.  China  is  an  authoritarian  state  in  which  the  Chinese
Communist Party (CCP) is the paramount authority. China poses the greatest national
threat to the United States. It is the most active strategic competitor of the United States
the  U.S
responsible
Government,  corporations,  and  allies.  The  Chinese  National  Intelligence  Law  of  2017
requires all Chinese entities to support, assist, and cooperate with Chinese intelligence
services. Chinese intelligence services, as well as private companies and other entities,
frequently seek to exploit Chinese citizens or persons with family ties to China who can
use their insider access to corporate networks to steal secrets. The Chinese Government
for  both  general  espionage  and  cyberespionage  against
is  responsible  for  significant  human  rights  abuses  of  its  citizens,  including  unlawful
killings, forced disappearances, and torture.

incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 28-year-old linguist sponsored by a defense contractor for a position
in Ukraine. He was born and educated in the United States. His parents and sister are
native-born U.S. citizens and residents.
Until  the  recent  COVID  travel  restrictions  were  imposed,  Applicant  regularly
returned to the United States to visit family and friends. He maintains close contact with
a college friend and former roommate in the United States, who has visited him and his
wife in Ukraine.
Applicant lived in Russia from June to December 2014 to participate in a Critical
Language  Scholarship  Program,  funded  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  State.  During  this
time, he studied Russian language and literature in a study-abroad program organized by
the Council on International Educational Exchange (CIEE) and funded by U.S. sources.
He was paired with Russian “partners” during his classes, some of whom became friends.
Applicant graduated from a U.S. college in May 2015, with bachelor’s degrees in
Spanish  and  Russian.  He  served  as  a  U.S.  Peace  Corps  volunteer  in  Ukraine  from
September 2016 to November 2018. The Peace Corps is an independent agency in the
executive  branch  of  the  U.S.  Government,  and  Applicant’s  participation  in  the  Peace
Corps activities in Ukraine was U.S. Government business. He has been employed by a
defense contractor since December 2018, awaiting an assignment as a linguist in Ukraine
in support of a U.S. Armed Forces multilateral training mission.
Applicant married a citizen and resident of Ukraine in January 2019.  He lives in
Ukraine with his wife and her 14-year-old son. In his response to the FORM, he stated
that he married in June 2019, which apparently is a mistake, because it is inconsistent
with  his  SCA  and  the  counterintelligence  screening  interview  report,  which  reflect  a
January 2019  marriage.  (FORM  Item  4  at  34;  Item  5  at  1-2.)  His  wife’s  son  was  born
during his wife’s previous marriage to a citizen and resident of Ukraine. His wife divorced
her first husband when her son was an infant. She and her son have no contact with her
son’s biological  father.  (Answer  at  8.)  His  wife’s  mother,  also  a  citizen  and  resident  of
Ukraine, lives across the street from them. (FORM Item 4 at 37-40.) Applicant’s father-in-
law passed away on April 16, 2021.
Applicant’s wife  owns an  apartment  in Ukraine  where Applicant and  she  live, and
she   has  several  Ukrainian   bank   accounts   worth   about  $7,500.   Her  apartment  is  a   45-
square meter, one-story, one-bedroom  apartment worth  about $16,000. (FORM  Item  5  at
12.) She  intends to  dispose  of  it if  Applicant receives a  security  clearance  and  is eligible
to assume his new position.
Applicant’s wife has never visited the United States. Although she intends to apply
for a U.S. visa, Applicant stated in his SCA that it will be “some years from now.”
Applicant’s  wife  works  as  a  freelance  translator  and  is  not  associated  with  any
Ukrainian business. She has never worked for the Ukrainian government or any foreign
intelligence entities. (Answer to SOR at 3.) Before Applicant became acquainted with her,
she voluntarily provided translation services for the Peace Corps and received a letter of
appreciation for her support. (Answer to SOR at 15-16.)
Applicant’s  father-in-law  and  mother-in-law  directed  a  children’s  folk  dance
ensemble  for  24  years.  (FORM  Item  4  at  39-40.)  They  were  never  employed  by  the
Ukrainian government, any other foreign government, or any foreign intelligence entities.
(Answer to SOR at 5-6.)
Applicant’s prospective supervisor has informed him that if he receives a clearance
and  is  hired,  he  will  be  required  to  move  to  another  region  in  Ukraine.  Anticipating  a
favorable clearance decision, he and his wife intend to sell his wife’s apartment and rent
another apartment in the region where he will be assigned. (Answer at 7.)
During  a  counterintelligence  screening  interview  in  February  2019,  Applicant
stated that he would like to work for the U.S. Government in Ukraine for about ten years.
(Item 5 at 5.) He also told the interviewer that his financial situation was “a perilous one,”
because  he  was  unemployed  and  dependent  on  his parents  and his savings  for living
expenses and student loan payments. (FORM Item 5 at 12.) He has improved his financial
situation since the screening interview by working as a freelance translator. As of October
16,  2020,  when  he  responded  to  the  FORM,  he  had  worked  as  a  freelance  translator
since January 2017 and been paid $5,451 since November 1, 2019; $3,032 since May 1,
2020; $2,376 since August 1, 2020; and $1,685 since October 1, 2020. (FORM Response
at  5.)  He  also  had  contracted  with  a  U.S.-based  museum  to  work  on  a  project  for  an
honorarium of $2,019. (Attachments to FORM Response.) In his response to the remand,
he provided evidence that he had paid off a student loan and increased his assets in the
United States by about $8,000. (RX I, Appendices III and IV.)
In Applicant’s SCA, he disclosed that he received a job offer in January 2019 from
a Ukrainian company. The job involved customer support and consulting in “virtual data
rooms.” He stated that he was never “technically offered” a position, but was invited for a
final  candidacy  interview.  He  declined  the  interview  because  he  was  pursuing
employment  with  a  defense  contractor.  (FORM  Item  4  at  77.)  In  his  response  to  the
FORM, he stated that the Ukrainian company offered him an annual salary of $27,600,
which he states is “astronomical” by Ukrainian standards. He stated that he rejected the
offer in order to accept his current position with a defense contractor, realizing that there
was no guarantee that he would be granted a security clearance. (FORM Response at
4.)  During  the  counterintelligence  screening  interview  in  February  2019,  he  told  the
interviewer that he had been interviewed by the Ukrainian company and had declined a
second interview in order to attend the screening interview. He also told the interviewer
that if the Ukrainian company called him again, he would accept its offer. (FORM Item 5
at 9.)
When  Applicant  submitted  his  SCA,  he  listed  several  citizens  of  Ukraine  and
Russia  in  the  section  asking,  “Do  you  have,  or  have  you  had,  close  and/or  continuing
contact  with  a  foreign  national  within  the  last  seven  (7)  years  with  whom  you  or  your
spouse . . . are bound by affection influence, common interest, and/or obligation?” In his
response  to  the  FORM,  he  described  his  current  relationships  with  his  Ukrainian  and
Russian contacts. Except for his wife, stepson, and in-laws, all of his Ukrainian contacts
were  related  to  his  service  in  the  Peace  Corps  and  employed  by  a  Ukrainian  state
university.  As  such,  they  were  employees  of  the  Ukrainian  Minister  of  Education  and
Science. After learning that they raised security concerns, he cut off contact with all of his
Russian contacts and all but two Ukrainian contacts. (FORM Response at 6-9). One of
these two Ukrainian contacts is now a freelance web developer and the other is a self-
employed  illustrator.  (FORM  Item  4  at  44,  49.)  The  information  about  Applicant’s
Ukrainian  and  Russian  contacts is summarized  in Appendix  A, attached  to  my  previous
decision. Two of Applicant’s Ukrainian contacts who are former Peace Corps colleagues
(identified  in  Appendix  A  of my  March 2021  decision  as “AO” and  “LK”)  left  Ukraine  and
now  reside  in  Germany. They  are  unable  to  leave  Germany  due  to  COVID restrictions.
Applicant  believes  that  they   intend   to   seek  Canadian   citizenship  and   do   not  intend   to
return to Ukraine.
Two of Applicant’s former colleagues in the Peace Corps submitted letters lauding
him for his loyalty, integrity, sincerity, enthusiasm, and his passionate attitude about his
service to the United States and the mission of the Peace Corps in Ukraine. One of his
colleagues  was  impressed  by  the  way  Applicant  handled  a  situation  reflecting  the
endemic corruption in the Ukrainian education system. Applicant and several other Peace
Corps  volunteers  had  offered  to  serve  as  judges  in  a  yearly  Olympiad  for  Ukrainian
students.  When  Ukrainian  officials  refused  to  correct  a  mistake  in  scoring,  Applicant
pulled all the Peace Corps volunteers out of judging the competition and did so in a way
that did not damage the relations between the Peace Corps and the Ukrainian Ministry of
Education and Science. (Attachments to FORM Response.)
At the request of Department Counsel and without objection by Applicant, I have
taken  administrative  notice  of  relevant  facts  about  Ukraine.  I  also  have  taken
administrative notice on my own motion, without objection from either party, of the facts
set out in the U.S. Department of State document, “U.S. Relations with Ukraine, Bilateral
Relations  Fact  Sheet,  dated  December  18,  2020  (www.state.gov/u-s-relations-with-
ukraine). The facts administratively noticed are set out below.
The United States established diplomatic relations with Ukraine in 1991, following
its independence from the Soviet Union. The United States attaches great importance to
the success of Ukraine as a free and democratic state with a flourishing market economy.
The  U.S.-Ukraine  Charter  on  Strategic  Partnership  highlights  the  importance  of  the
bilateral relationship and continue commitment of the United States to support enhanced
engagement between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Ukraine.
Ukraine has had a parliamentary-presidential type of government since becoming
independent of the Soviet Union in 1991. It is undergoing profound political and economic
change as  it moves  toward  a  market  economy and multiparty democracy.  Presidential
elections in December 1991 were marred by government intimidation and electoral fraud.
The presidential election in 2005 and local elections in March 2006 were markedly fairer.
The presidential election in April 2018 and the parliamentary elections in July 2018 were
considered free and fair by international and domestic observers.
Ukraine  has  significant  human  rights  problems.  Torture,  arbitrary  detention  of
persons critical of  the government, and warrantless violations of  privacy are  illegal but
common. Ukraine has substantial problems with the independence  of the judiciary and
widespread  government  corruption.  The  Ukrainian  government  generally  fails  to
adequately investigate or take steps to prosecute or punish officials who commit human
rights abuses, resulting in a climate of impunity.
U.S.  Government   assistance   to   Ukraine   aims  to   support  the   development   of   a
secure, democratic, prosperous, and  free  Ukraine, fully  integrated  into  the  Euro-Atlantic
community.  The   United   States  has  granted  Ukraine   market-economy   status  and   given
Ukraine permanent normal-trade-relations status. The United  States and Ukraine  have a
bilateral  investment   treaty.  The   U.S-Ukraine   Council   on   Trade   and   Investment  has
worked  to  increase  commercial and  investment opportunities by  identifying  and  removing
impediments to bilateral and  investment flows.
Ukraine  and  the  United  States  belong  to  a  number  of  the  same  international
organizations, including the United Nations, Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, International Monetary Fund, World Bank, World Trade Organization, and Euro-
Atlantic Partnership Council. There is no indication in the administrative notice documents
indicating that Ukraine targets the United States for military or economic espionage.
In  my  original  decision  I  took  administrative  notice  of  the  facts  in  the  U.S.
Department of State Travel Advisory dated August 24, 2020, which was included in the
FORM. The Department of State issued a Level 3 Travel Advisory for Ukraine (reconsider
travel)  due  to  COVID,  crime,  and  civil  unrest.  The  travel  advisory  noted  that  crime
targeting  foreigners  and  property is  common;  that  demonstrations,  which  have  turned
violent  at
targeted
assassinations  and  bombings  have  occurred;  and  that  there  were  reports  of  violent
attacks  on  minority  groups  and  police by radical groups.  The  same  travel  advisory
published  Level  4  (“do  not  travel”)  warning  for  areas  in  Ukraine  occupied  by  Russian
authorities.  The  U.S.  government  prohibits  its  employees  from  traveling  to  Crimea  or
regions controlled by the Russians.
times,  regularly  occur
throughout  Ukraine;
that  politically
In this remand decision, I have also taken administrative notice of the facts set out
in the U.S. Department of State Travel Advisory dated July 26, 2021, which was cited by
Department Counsel RX II at 3 and Item II. The July 2021 travel advisory superseded the
August 2020 Level 3 travel advisory (“reconsider travel”), which was applicable when my
March  2021  decision  was  issued.  The  July  2021  travel  advisory  published  a  Level  2
advisory  (exercise  caution)  for  Ukraine,  based  on  COVID,  crime,  and  civil  unrest,  and
published  a  separate  Level  4  advisory  (“do  not  travel”)  for  Crimea  and  the  Russian-
occupied areas in eastern Ukraine.
Applicant is an active alumnus of the U.S. university from which he graduated in
May 2015. He has been active in the university’s alumni mentor program. In August 2021,
he  was  nominated  for  “Mentor  Spotlight”  recognition  for  his  “incredible  work”  with  the
mentor program. (RX I, Appendix II.)
Applicant  maintains  close   relationships  with   his family   and   friends  in  the   United
States.  He  has  purchased   an   airline   ticket  to   attend   his  sister’s  wedding   in  the   United
States in  May  2022, to  visit a  close  friend  who  was the  best man  at  his wedding, and  to
spend two weeks with  his parent. (RX I, Appendix I.)

"In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations.  His
admissions  are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings
of fact.
Applicant  is  47  years old.  He  was  born  in  Egypt  in  1973.  He  lived  in  Egypt  for
approximately  30  years  before  immigrating  to  the  United  States  in  2005  through  the
use of a spousal visa. He married his first wife (W1) in 2000, and he has three children
from this marriage. His son is (S) 19, his oldest daughter (D1) is 17, and his youngest
daughter (D2) is 16. He divorced W1 in September 2003 and married his second wife
(W2) in October 2003. W2 is a native-born U.S. citizen. Applicant and W2 were married
in  Egypt  and  lived  there  for two  years  until  they  moved  to  the  United  States  in  2005.
W2 sponsored  Applicant  for  his  spousal  visa  to  become  a  resident  alien  in  2005.  He
attained U.S. citizenship in 2008. He divorced W2 in 2013. He remarried W1 in 2016.
W1 currently  resides  in  Egypt  with  D1  and D2.  S  is  currently  attending  college  in  the
United  States.  Applicant  graduated  from  high  school  in  Egypt,  but  also  successfully
completed  the  general  educational  development  (GED)  test  in  2013.  He  received  a
bachelor’s degree in engineering in May 2018. He has worked for a defense contractor
since June 2019. (Tr. 36-37, 39, 58-61; GE 1)
Under Guideline B, the SOR alleged that W1, Applicant’s father (F), brother (B),
and two sisters (S1 and S2) are all citizens and residents of Egypt; that S is a citizen of
Egypt  residing  in  the  United  States;  that  D1  and  D2  are  dual  U.S.-Egyptian  citizens
residing in Egypt; that Applicant provides $500 monthly to his children living in Egypt;
and that he owns property in Egypt where W1, D1, and D2 reside. Under Guideline F,
SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  had  nine  delinquent  collection  and  charged-off  debts
totaling  approximately  $28,520.  (SOR  ¶¶  2.a-2.i)  The  debts  are  established  by
Applicant’s admissions and entries on credit reports. (GE 3-4; Answer to SOR)
Foreign Relatives
W1 (SOR 1.a, 1.d, 1.h): As related above, Applicant remarried W1 in 2016. She
is a native-born Egyptian who currently resides there. She holds an Egyptian passport,
which expires in December 2027. She has never visited the United States. She has a
law degree, but has never practiced law. She is a full-time mother. She lives in Egypt
with D1 and D2 in an apartment purchased by Applicant for approximately $20,000 in
2013. Applicant provides the sole financial support for W1 and their daughters. He has
daily contact with W1 either by telephone or internet messaging.  W1 has no affiliation
with the Egyptian government or military. She applied for U.S. resident-alien status in
June 2021. Applicant believes the application process could take as long as one year.
(Tr. 36, 42-46, 48, 50, 97-98; AE B1, B12-B14)
S (SOR 1.b): S is a native-born Egyptian citizen who acquired U.S. citizenship
through  Applicant’s sponsorship  in  2011, when S was still a minor. He currently holds
dual  citizenship  from  both  countries.  He  resides  in  the  United  States,  where  he  is
attending college. S has no intention to return to Egypt after he completes college. He
has  no  affiliation  with  the  Egyptian  government  or  military.  (Tr.  47-48,  50;  69-70;  AE
B4-B7)
D1  and  D2  (SOR  1.c):  D1  and  D2  are  native-born  Egyptian  citizens  who
acquired  U.S. citizenship through  Applicant’s  sponsorship in 2011, when they were still
minors. They  both  currently  reside  in  Egypt  with  their  mother, W1  and  are  supported
financially by Applicant. They attend an American school in Egypt to prepare them for
college  in  the  United  States.  Applicant  is  fearful  for  their  safety  in  Egypt,  not
necessarily from the government or terrorism, but because of the prevalent street crime
that exists there. He hired a driver to take them to and from school for safety reasons.
D1  is  now  a  senior  in  high  school.  Applicant  intends  for  them  to  come  to  the  United
States  with  W1  when  her  immigration  application  is  approved,  or  he  will  bring  them
both  to  the  United  States even  if W1’s application  is  not finalized.  They both visited the
United States this summer and stayed with Applicant for about two months.  Applicant
has daily contact with D1 and D2 either by telephone or internet messaging. Neither D1
nor D2 have affiliations with the Egyptian government or military. (Tr. 43, 46-48, 50, 69-
70, 72-75, 97-98; AE B8-B11)
F (SOR 1.e): F is a native-born Egyptian who also resides there. He is 84 years
old and  is retired  from  the  oil  industry  and  living  on  a  “good” pension.  Applicant does
not provide any financial support to F. According to Applicant, F is “very sick” and lives
with  B.  Applicant  has  frequent  contact  with  his  father  because  of  his  health  through
telephone  calls  or  messages.  After  his  mandatory  military  service  in  1973,  F  had  no
further affiliation with the Egyptian government or military. (Tr. 49-51, 75-76; GE 1)
B (SOR 1.f): B is a native-born Egyptian who also resides there. He is 34 years
old.  He works for the same private  sector oil company for whom F worked.  Applicant
does  not  provide  any  financial  support  for  B.  Since  F  lives  with  B,  Applicant  has
frequent  contact  with  B  acting  as  a  conduit  to  communicate  with  F.  Otherwise,
Applicant’s  substantive   contact   with   B   is  less  than   twice  a   month.   B   has   no   affiliation
with the Egyptian government or military. (Tr. 50-51, 75-76; GE 1)
S1  and  S2  (SOR  1.g):  S1  and  S2  are  native-born  Egyptians  who  also  reside
there.  S1  is  52  years  old  and  S2  is  41  years  old.  Neither  work  outside  the  home.
Applicant does not provide any financial support to either of them. He has contact with
his sisters less frequently than with F or B, probably twice a year. S1 and S2 have no
affiliation with the Egyptian government or military. (Tr. 50-52, 78; GE 1)
Applicant testified that he never voted in an Egyptian election the entire time he
resided there. Upon gaining U.S. citizenship, he voted in the 2008 Presidential election,
which was the last time he voted. He also stated that after he divorced W2 in 2010 he
went through some difficult times until he obtained his college degree in 2018. Those
difficult  times  contributed  to  his  financial  problems  discussed  below.  To  continue  to
support  his family  living  in  Egypt  while  he  was  in  college,  he  worked  low-paying  jobs
and  lived  in  his  car  for  several  months.  He  is  now  in  a  much  more  stable  financial
position, with an annual salary of approximately $190,000. This has allowed him to pay
his delinquent debts, purchase a home, and establish some savings. He believes once
all  of  his  children  come  to  the  United  States,  they  will  permanently  reside  here.  He
intends to sell his apartment in Egypt once his family comes to the United States. He
last visited Egypt from September 2018 to January 2019.  He stayed with his family in
their  apartment.  He  returned  to  help  tutor  his  son  in  preparation  to  take  his  college
scholastic aptitude test (SAT). (Tr. 41, 49, 53, 63, 65, 67, 70, 79, 81)
Egypt
Several  terrorist  organizations  operate  in  Egypt.  In  2014,  the  most  active
terrorist group operating there pledged its allegiance to ISIS. The U.S.  Department of
State  has  assessed  Cairo  as  a  critical-threat  location  for  terrorism  directed  at  U.S.
Government  interests.  It also has been  given  a Level 3 travel advisory.  The Egyptian
Government does not respect the full spectrum of human rights.
Financial
Applicant recently resolved his remaining debts. He explained that he did not act
sooner  to  resolve  them  because  he  did  not  obtain  his  current  well-paying  job  until
2019. He also did not understand the security significance or implications of having bad
debts until after he began seeking a security clearance. He recently purchased a home
and his most recent credit report shows all his debts are current. (Tr. 82, 84; GE 5; AE
C1 – C5)

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, she admitted the factual allegation in SOR ¶ 1.a
but denied that there was any reason to question her allegiance to the United States. At
the hearing,  Department  Counsel moved  to withdraw the  Guideline  A  allegation, and  I
granted the motion. (Tr. 8.)
Applicant  admitted  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  2.b  and  2.c.  She  denied  the
allegations in SOR ¶¶ 2.a, 2.d, and 2.e. Her admissions in her answer and at the hearing
are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 34-year-old Russian linguist hired by a defense contractor in January
2018.  She  has  never  held  a  security  clearance.  Her  employment  is  contingent  on  her
ability to obtain a security clearance.
While  attending  college  in  Russia,  Applicant  applied  for  a  program  that  offered
positions abroad for students or recent graduates. She testified that she lived in a very
cold region in Siberia, found it boring, and wanted to explore other opportunities. She was
accepted in the program and came to the United States in June 2009 on a work visa. She
worked as an office manager from June 2009 until March 2010.
Applicant testified that she chose to come to the United States because she spoke
English but did not speak the languages of other countries involved in the program. She
was required to learn English in the Russian elementary school and high school, and she
enrolled in additional English classes in college. (Tr. 42-43.) She also testified that the
United  States  was  her  first  choice  for  a  position  abroad,  because  when  she  watched
movies  growing up,  the  United  States  seemed  like  a  “great  place  to  be.”  (Tr.  43.) She
testified that she has become immersed in American life and culture, to the extent that
she now thinks in English instead of Russian. (Tr. 17.)
Applicant married a U.S. citizen in September 2010 and became a permanent U.S.
resident. She became a U.S. citizen in August 2014. (GX 3 at 15.) She has never formally
renounced  her  Russian  citizenship,  but  she allowed  her  Russian  passport to  expire  in
January 2014.
Applicant  and  her  husband  separated  in  December  2015  and  divorced  in  May
2018. (Tr. 30.) She testified that they divorced because her husband was dominated by
his  mother  and  preferred  to  stay  home  and  watch  television  instead  of  going  out  and
“doing  things.”  (Tr.  29-30.)  They  do  not  have  much  contact  with  each  other,  but  they
maintain an amicable relationship when they talk. (Tr.17.) They have no children.
Applicant’s  ex-husband  served  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  Marine Corps  for four
years and has been employed by DOD for 24 years. Her ex-husband submitted a letter
supporting her application for a security clearance. In his letter he states, “During her time
in the United States of America, she developed a deep love for this country. I was at her
citizenship ceremony; it was easy to see the pride and emotion of that day.”
In May 2009, Applicant obtained  the  equivalent of a  master’s degree  in taxation
from the Siberian State Aerospace University in Russia. She received a bachelor’s degree
from  a  U.S.  university  in  May  2017  and  has  been  taking  post-graduate  courses  since
September  2017.  She  obtained  a  graduate  certificate  in  cyber  security  from  a  U.S.
university in August 2018. (Tr. 19; GX 3 at 13.)
The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant’s  father,  mother,  and  brother  are  citizens  and
residents of Russia. (SOR ¶¶ 2.a-2.c) It also alleges that her father formerly served as a
“security inspector” and “district inspector” for the Russian government (SOR ¶¶ 2.d), and
that he had provided Applicant with financial assistance of about $1,900 per month for a
total of about $53,000 since December 2015 (SOR ¶ 2.e).
Applicant’s mother lives in an apartment that she owns, worth about $16,130. Her
father,  now deceased,  owned  an  apartment  that  was  also  worth  about  $16,130  and  a
dacha (vacation house) worth about $5,645. Applicant and her brother expect to inherit
their parents’ property, but she intends to give her share to her brother, because she has
no  intention  of  living  in  Russia.  (Tr.  37;  GX  3  at  11.)  During  her  counterintelligence
screening  interview,  she  commented,  “Russia  is  a  wonderful  country  with  a  horrible
government.” (GX 3 at 3.)
Applicant’s  father  passed  away  in  July  2018.  (AX  A.)  He  had  worked  for  the
Russian government from 1980 to1995, and he received a pension for his service. (GX 3
at 16.) He provided financial assistance to Applicant in the amounts alleged in the SOR
so  that she  could obtain her bachelor’s degree. Applicant’s relationship with  her father
was strained  before his death  because  he  was involved  with  a  woman  who  resented  his
family.  She  received  about $5,000  from  her father’s estate  when  he  passed  away. She
did not  receive  any  benefits  from  the  Russian  government for her father’s former  service.
(Tr. 33-34.)
In  Applicant’s  SCA,  she  stated  that  she  has  daily  telephone  contact  with  her
mother. Her mother has been employed for about 15 years by a sportsmanship institute
that  trains  and  educates  athletes.  (Tr.  35.)  She  is  not  affiliated  with  the  Russian
government, military security, defense industry, or intelligence service. (GX 1 at 28.) In
her answer to the SOR, she stated that she has “very little” verbal contact with her mother,
about five times a year. However, at the hearing, she testified that they text “every week,
two times a week, sometimes every day of the week depending on [her] mom’s mood and
situation.” (Tr. 21.)
In  Applicant’s  SCA,  she  stated  that  she  had  weekly  telephone  contact  with  her
brother. Her brother is employed by as an electrical engineer for a construction company.
(Tr. 36.) He has no affiliation with the Russian government, military, security,  defense-
related  industry,  or  intelligence  service.  (GX  1  at  30-31.)  In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the
SOR, she stated that she has little contact with her brother and has not seen him for about
five years. However, at the hearing, she testified that she and her brother send texts every
two or three months and talk on the telephone once every two or three months. (Tr. 21.)
Applicant’s  SCA  reflects  that  she  visited  her  family  in  Russia  in  October  2011,
December 2013, and March 2015. (GX 1 at 36-41.) Since 2016, she has been sending
her mother $100 for Christmas or her birthday. (GX 3 at 10.) At the hearing, she testified
that she and her mother vacationed together in Europe in November 2019, but she has
not seen her brother since she went to Russia in 2015. (Tr. 22-23.)
Applicant  testified  that  her  brother  approves  of  her  decision  to  become  a  U.S.
citizen  and  live  in  the  United  States.  However,  her  mother  disapproves  because  she
believes that a daughter should stay at home and support her parents. (Tr. 25.)
Applicant was unemployed and supported by her husband during their marriage,
except for employment as a waitress in a bar from December 2011 to January 2012. She
was self-employed as an artist from January to December 2017, when she was offered a
position as a Russian linguist, contingent on obtaining a security clearance.
In July 2018, Applicant accepted an invitation from an acquaintance to invest in a
used-car dealership. She borrowed money from her credit union and used credit cards to
invest about $100,000 in a 50% interest in the business. She owes about $32,000 on the
loan. She lived in a home owned by her husband during their marriage, but she currently
does not own a home or any other investment interests. (Tr. 39.)
Applicant testified that the used-car business is doing well in spite of COVID-19.
Last year, she earned about $45,000. She actively works in the business six days a week,
selling cars, dealing with banks, dealing with clients, and every aspect of the business.
(Tr. 20-21, 40.) If she is hired as a linguist for one year, she will retain her financial interest
in the business. If her application for a clearance is denied, she will stay in the United
States and sell cars. (Tr. 41.)
A  business  owner,  who  is also  an  ordained  minister,  trusts and  respects Applicant.
He describes her as dedicated, hardworking,  and  a  “woman  of  refreshing  candor.”  (AX  E
at 2.) Two  longtime  friends admire  her for her candor, honesty, reliability, and  kindness.
(AX E at 3, 4.)
I  have  taken  administrative  notice  that  Russia  is  one  of  the  top  three  most
aggressive  collectors of  economic information  and  technological  intelligence from  U.S.
sources. Russia uses cyber operations as an instrument of intelligence collection, using
sophisticated  and  large-scale  hacking  to  collect  sensitive  information,  influence  the
political process in the United States, and undermine Euro-Atlantic unity.
Russia also uses commercial and academic enterprises that interact with the West,
recruitment  of  Russian  immigrants  with  advanced  technical  skills,  and  penetration  of
public and private enterprises by Russian intelligence agents to obtain sensitive technical
information.  The  areas  of  highest  interest  include  alternative  energy,  biotechnology,
defense technology, environmental protection, high-end manufacturing, and information
and  communications  technology.  Russian  agents  have  been  involved  in  intrusions
affecting  U.S.  citizens,  corporate  entities,  international  organizations,  and  political
organizations in the United States.
Significant  human-rights  issues  in  Russia  include  extrajudicial  killings;  enforced
disappearance;  torture,  including  punitive  psychiatric  incarceration;  harsh  prison
conditions;  arbitrary  arrest  and  detention;  and  lack  of  judicial  independence.  The
Department of State has identified Moscow as a high-threat location for terrorist activity
directed at official U.S. Government interests.

"Applicant is 39-year-old vice president of a defense contractor company. She has
been  employed  by  her  company  since  March  2016  and  is  required  to  hold  security
clearance to fulfill her responsibilities within her company. (Tr. 15-17; GE 1; AE F)
Applicant was born in Russia in 1982, and acquired Russian citizenship by birth.
Her parents divorced when she was eight years old, and both of her parents remarried.
Applicant  immigrated  to  the  United  States  in  1994  at  age  12,  with  her  mother,
stepfather, and sister. (GE 1, GE 2; Tr. 21-22, 39-40, 50-51) She currently holds a U.S.
passport  issued  to  her  in  August  2013,  and  expires  in  August  2023.  She  has  held  a
Russian passport since she was in the U.S. Air Force, discussed below. She attempted
to renounce her Russian citizenship around 2008, but became frustrated with the costly
and cumbersome requirements to do so. (Tr. 41-43; GE 1; AE A, AE I)
She attended middle school and high school in the United States, and received
her high school diploma in 2000. She served in the U.S. Air Force from 2001 to 2004,
and  was  separated  with  a  general  discharge  under  honorable  conditions.  Applicant
became  a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen  in  2001,  shortly  after  enlisting  in  the  Air  Force.  (Tr.
17-19,  22-25,  40;  GE1,  GE  2)  One  of  her  assignments  in  the  Air  Force  was  at  Dover
AFB  working  in  the  mortuary  identifying  the  remains  of  9/11  victims  and  service
members killed in theater through dental records. Applicant was awarded an associate’s
degree  in  2005,  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  2007,  and  an  MBA  degree  in  2011.  (SOR

Applicant’s  father  is  a  resident  citizen  of  Russia,  and  served  as  a  career
uniformed  officer  in  the  Russian  Air  Force,  and  was  assigned  to  a  Russian  state-
sponsored  institute.  After  retiring  from  the  Russian  Air  Force,  he  worked  in  that  same
institute as a civilian employee. He retired “several years ago” from that institute and no
longer works. Applicant’s stepmother is also a resident citizen of Russia. (GE 1; SOR;
Tr. 30-32)
Applicant  was granted and  maintained  a  secret security  clearance  while  in the  Air
Force  from  2001   to  2004. In  2009,   she   was  again  granted   a   secret  security   clearance
and  maintained  it until  it was suspended  in 2018  as a  result of  these  proceedings. (GE
1,  GE   2;  Tr.  28-29)  She   was  granted   those   clearances  after  disclosing   her  father  and
stepmother  were  resident  citizens  of   Russia,   her  father’s   military   and   post-military
assignment  at   a   Russian   institute,   and   of  her  marriage   to   her  Iranian-born   husband   in
2014.  Applicant has  worked  primarily  in the  defense  industry  post active  duty  Air  Force,
estimating  her defense  industry  service to  be   “about 12” years  to  date.  (Tr. 28-30, 42-

Applicant met her third husband, an Iranian citizen in the United States, in 2011,
and  married  him  in  2014.  She  was  previously  married  from  2001  to  2003,  and  from
2005 to 2007, to U.S.-born citizens. Both of those marriages ended by divorce. She has
three U.S.-born children with her current husband, ages five, three, and one. (Tr. 20, 23,
25,  49-50;  GE  1)  Applicant’s  father-in-law  and  mother-in-law  are  resident  citizens  of
Iran. (GE 1; SOR)
Applicant’s father and  stepmother have  three-year tourist visas and  travel to  the
United   States   “every  few   years  or  so”   to   visit  Applicant,   her  sister,  and   their
grandchildren.  Applicant  and   her  sister  each   have   three   children.  (Tr.  30,  32-33)
Applicant’s  mother and   stepfather are naturalized   U.S.  citizens.  Her stepfather worked
as  a   DOD  employee   and   held  a   secret   security   clearance.  (SOR  Answer)   Applicant’s
sister is a  naturalized  U.S. citizen  and  her brother-in-law, nephew, and  two  nieces are
U.S.-born  citizens.  Her  sister  is  an   active   duty   U.S.  Air   Force  lieutenant   colonel,  her

Applicant  and  her  children  frequently  participate  in  a  group  chat  and  exchange
photographs  on  social  media  with  her  father  and  stepmother  in  Russia.  (Tr.  32-33)
Applicant’s  father  is 74  years  old  and  has  been  diagnosed  with  prostate  and  stomach
cancer  as  well  as  having  a  heart  condition.  He  remains  in  Russia  to  receive  medical
care as a veteran. (AE A)
As noted, Applicant’s father-in-law and mother-in-law are resident citizens of Iran.
Before  her  father-in-law  retired  “five  or  seven  years”  ago,  he  “sold  textiles  and  things
like  that.”  Her  mother-in-law  was  a  “stay-at-home  mom”  and  raised  four  children.
Applicant’s  in-laws  were  not  employed  by  nor  are  they  associated  with  the  Iranian
government.  Applicant’s in-laws own  their  own  home  and  she  has  “no  idea” what their
net worth is. Her in-laws in Iran also participate in the same social media group chat as
her  father  and  mother-in-law  to  exchange  photographs  and  stay  current  with  their
grandchildren. (Tr. 33-37; AE A)
Applicant’s mother-in-law is 69 years old, and was diagnosed with ovarian cancer
approximately five years ago. Her father-in-law is 74 years old. Her in-laws in Iran are
financially  stable.  (AE  A)  Applicant’s  husband  has  two  sisters  and  one  brother.  All  of
those siblings are married, have children, live in the United States, and are employed in
technical fields. The siblings of Applicant’s husband all have “green cards” and intend to
file for U.S, citizenship when eligible. They periodically visit their elderly parents in Iran
to provide emotional and physical support. (SOR Answer; AE A)
As  noted,  Applicant’s  husband  was  born  in  in  1976  in  Iran  and  as  such  is  an
Iranian citizen. He came to the United States in 1999 on a student visa and received a
scholarship to attend a prestigious university. He went on to earn a bachelor of science
degree  in  electrical  engineering,  a  master’s  degree  in  electrical  engineering,  and
completed his coursework for a Ph.D. in electrical engineering. Applicant’s husband is a
lawful permanent resident in the United States and is currently employed as director of
engineering for a start-up company. (Tr. 36-37; AE A, AE J) Applicant’s husband  does
not have any assets in Iran nor does he participate in any political process in Iran such
as voting. (Tr. 39, 53-55)
In  November  2020,  Applicant’s  husband  retained  an  immigration  attorney  to
assist  him  with  the process  to become  a  U.S.  citizen.  In  November 2020,  his  attorney
filed  his  completed  application  for  citizenship  with  all  required  application  fees.
Applicant’s husband  receives periodic updates from  his immigration attorney regarding
the  status  of  his  pending  application.  As  of  May  4,  2021,  the  immigration  attorney’s
office  advised  Applicant’s  husband  that  “USCIS  is  processing  applications  filed  on
12/20/2019  (sic)  with  an  estimated  processing  time  of  13.5  to  16.5  months.  As  your
case was received on 11/16/2021, it is within normal processing times.” (AE A, AE J, AE
K, AE L)
The  last  concern  centers  on  Applicant  obtaining  a  Russian  passport  after
obtaining a secret security clearance in 2009, and using that Russian passport to travel
to  Iran  and  Russia  in 2013.  (SOR  ¶  2.a)  Applicant  stated  that  she is a  dual citizen  by
birth that she had a Russian passport going back to when she was in the Air Force, and
that holding a Russian passport was the only way she could visit her father in Russia,
who was very ill at the time. (Amended SOR Answer; Tr. 40-41; AE A)
Applicant further stated that her then boyfriend, now husband, arranged the trips
to  Iran  and  Russia  in  2013  as  a  surprise  to  her  so  they  could  meet  their  respective
parents before marrying in 2014. Applicant informed her facility security officer (FSO) at
the time that she would be traveling, but did not know where. She did inform her FSO of
where  she  had  traveled  on  her  return.  A  later  FSO  reported  Applicant’s  use  of  a
Russian  passport to travel to  Iran and  Russia  by Joint  Personnel Adjudication System
(JPAS)  in  2016,  some  three  years  later,  when  Applicant  disclosed  such  facts  on  her
August 2, 2016 SF-86 when renewing her clearance. Applicant affirmatively stated that
she  had  never  attempted  to  hide  anything  regarding  her  travel  or  use  of  her  Russian
passport.  Any  misstep  regarding  any  passport  or  travel  issues  was  due  to  her  lack  of
knowledge  of  the  process.  (Amended  SOR  Answer;  Tr.  44-46;  GE  2  (July  26,  2018
Office  of  Personnel Management  Personal Subject Interview (OPM PSI);  AE A,  AE  F)
After  2016,  and  becoming  fully  aware  of  travel  requirements,  she  only  used  her  U.S.
passport  to  travel  abroad.  Applicant  has  reported  all  subsequent  foreign  travel  to  her
FSO. (Tr. 48-50, 65; GE 2; AE A, AE I, AE J)
In   2016,  Applicant  turned   her  Russian   passport   in,  now   expired,   to   her  FSO.
However,  in  2019,   her  FSO   returned   her   passport   to   her  “per  SEAD”   after  the   “US
Government changed  their  rules and  she  was able  to  keep  her Russian  passport.”  On
June   3,   2021,   Applicant  returned   her  expired   Russian   passport   to   her  FSO  where  it
remains  today. Applicant kept her Russian  passport for the  sole purpose  of  being  able
to  visit her father. She  explained  that because  she  is not a  permanent citizen  in Russia,
she   does  not   have   a   “full”  Russian   passport  that   would  allow   her  to   work  in  Russia.
Applicant related  that as she  understands the  rules, she  is allowed  to  hold her Russian
passport, but cannot  travel using  her Russian  passport. (Amended SOR Answer; Tr. 44-
45; GE 2; AE  A  - AE G)
Applicant  has  no   assets  in  Russia,   nor  does  her  husband   have   any   assets   in
Iran. She  and  her husband  own  their  home  in the  United  States valued  at approximately
$1.5  million.  Her annual salary  is “around  $175,000.” Her husband’s annual salary  is “a
little over $200,000” and  he  has “stocks   and   bonuses that come   in.” Their   joint annual
income   is  “usually   around   $350,000   to   $400,000.”  Applicant  and   her  husband   have
checking  and  savings accounts in  the  United  States  and  own  four automobiles. (Tr. 51-

clothes  on  an  annual basis  to  a  local woman’s shelter. For the  most  part,  she  spends
her time between work and her family. (Tr. 60-61)
Post-hearing,  Applicant  submitted  a  reference  letter  from  the  president,  chief
executive  officer,  and  owner  of  her  company.  The  company  president  provided  very
favorable  substantive  comments  about  Applicant’s  dedication  and  commitment  to  the
mission  of the  company and  the  company’s mission to national security. The company
president  added  that  Applicant  has  made  significant  contributions  establishing  and
growing  their  company  capabilities  through  capture  and  awareness  of  new  contracts,
successful execution of  their Government and commercial programs and in supporting
the  company’s  growth,  organizational  structure  and  culture.  The  company  president
lauded  Applicant’s loyalty to  the  United States, her work ethic, values her contributions
in  supporting  U.S.  national  security,  and  fully  supports  reinstatement  of  Applicant’s
security  clearance.  (AE  H)  The  FSO  also  submitted  a  reference  letter  noting  that
Applicant demonstrates outstanding ethical behavior and noted her loyalty to the United
States. (AE F)

Applicant was born in the  United  States in 1999, and  is a  U.S. citizen  by  birth. He
received  all  of  his education  in  the  United  States and  has  known  no  other country  other
than  the  United  States.  He has two  younger sisters, who  were also born in the  United
States   in  2003   and   2010,   and   are  U.S.  citizens  by   birth.   Applicant   and   his  two   sisters
live   with  their  parents.  (GE 1; Tr. 17-18, 24) Applicant holds a  U.S. passport issued  in
December 2015, and  expiring in December 2025. (GE 1; Tr. 29-30)
Both  of Applicant’s  parents are Mexican citizens and are  residing illegally in the
United States. His father came to the United States when he was 17 years old and his
mother came to the United States when she was 19 years old.  Both parents  did so to
seek better opportunities.  His parents met after they arrived in the United States  while
working at a fast food restaurant and have been married for 22 years. Applicant’s father
has “worked every day since he first came here.” He owns two businesses. Applicant’s
father has never been arrested nor has he ever filed for any type of public assistance.
(GE 1; Tr. 19-21, 30-32) Applicant’s mother also owns her own business. (Tr. 29)
Applicant  self-reported  his  parents’  immigration  status  on  his  October  30,  2019
SF-86  and  was  forthright  and  candid  about  their  status  during  his  December  5,  2019
Office of Personnel Management Personal Subject Interview (OPM PSI). (GE 1, GE 2)
Furthermore, he was forthright and candid about his parents and their status during his
hearing.
Applicant’s parents  have been attempting to  change their immigration status for
many  years.  Approximately  20  years  ago,  they  began  the  process  by  hiring  an
immigration attorney to bring them into compliance with existing immigration laws. Post-
hearing,  Applicant  submitted  a  May  21,  2021  letter  from  his  parents’  immigration
attorney. Their attorney stated:
We   are   currently   processing   adjustment   of   status  applications  for
[Applicant’s parents]  via the  portion  of  the  Immigration  and  Nationality  Act
(INA)  known   as  “245(i).”   You   will   find   accompanying   this  letter  copies  of
the   initial  receipts   for   our  clients’  respective   applications.  We   anticipate
favorable results  from  both   of  our clients’ applications,   which will   result in
them  both  obtaining  legal permanent resident status in  the  United  States  if
approved.  (AE B)
Attached   to   the   attorney’s  letter  were  copies  of   The   U.S.  Citizenship  and
Immigration   Services  receipts  for  their   applications  both   dated   March  29,  2021.
Applicant submitted  the  same  documents at his hearing.  (AE  A, AE  B, AE  C, AE  D; Tr.
22-25, 32-34)
Applicant stated  that his parents have  lived  in the  United  States  their  entire adult
working   lives.  Their   three   children   were  born   in   the   United   States,  all   of  their   real and
personal property  are in the  United  States,  and  they  earn their  livelihood  in the   United
States.  Applicant’s  parents have   owned  their   own   home   since  about  2014.   Applicant’s
parents   pay   their   state   and   federal  taxes  every   year,   and   their   first  loyalty   is  to   the
United   States.  As   a   business  owner,  Applicant’s  father  provides  employment   to   local
residents.  Applicant stated that his parents’ intent is to pursue U.S. citizenship assuming
their “green cards”  are granted.  (Tr. 22-23,  27-29)
Applicant  earns  approximately   $30,000   a   year  from  his  business  installing   real
estate   signs.  He   currently   lives  with   his  parents   rent-free.   (Tr.  25)  He   owns  an
automobile  and  is current on  his car payments and  insurance. (Tr. 25-26) If  Applicant is
hired by his prospective defense contractor, his goal is to move out from his parents and
own  his own  home. (Tr. 27) If  hired  by  his prospective  defense  contractor, he  would not
discuss any  classified  aspect  of his job  with  his parents  or  anyone  who  was not  cleared
and  did not have a  need to know. (Tr. 27-28)
As noted, Department Counsel did not request that I take administrative notice of
facts about Mexico nor did he submit any documents pertaining to Mexico. There is no
evidence to suggest that Mexico is hostile to the United States, is an authoritarian state,

The Government cross-alleged the foreign influence concern raised in SOR ¶ 1.a
as a personal conduct concern in SOR ¶ 2.a. No additional facts were developed as a
personal conduct concern that were not already discussed under foreign influence.
Law and Policies
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (EO)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive
5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security  Clearance  Review Program  (January 2,
1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  adjudicative  guidelines  (AG),  which  became
effective on June 8, 2017.
When  evaluating  an  applicant’s  suitability
the
administrative  judge  must  consider  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  In  addition  to  brief
introductory  explanations  for  each  guideline,  the  adjudicative  guidelines  list  potentially
disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an
applicant’s eligibility for access to classified information.
for  a  security  clearance,
These  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.  Instead,  recognizing  the
complexities  of  human  behavior,  administrative  judges  apply  the  guidelines  in
conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge’s
overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According
to  AG  ¶  2(c),  the  entire  process  is  a  conscientious  scrutiny  of  a  number  of  variables
known  as  the  “whole-person  concept.”  The  administrative  judge  must  consider  all
available,  reliable  information  about  the  person,  past  and  present,  favorable  and
unfavorable, in making a decision.
The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG ¶ 2(b)
requires  that  “[a]ny  doubt  concerning  personnel  being  considered  for  national  security
eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.”
Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.14,  the  Government  must  present  evidence  to  establish
controverted  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR.  Under  Directive  ¶  E3.1.15,  the  applicant  is
responsible  for presenting  “witnesses  and  other  evidence  to  rebut,  explain,  extenuate,
or  mitigate  facts  admitted  by  the  applicant  or  proven  by  Department  Counsel.”  The
applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.
A  person  who  seeks  access  to  classified  information  enters  into  a  fiduciary
relationship  with
trust  and  confidence.  This
relationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The
Government  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  individuals  to  whom  it
the  Government  predicated  upon
grants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of
the  possible  risk  the  applicant  may  deliberately  or  inadvertently  fail  to  safeguard
classified  information.  Such  decisions  entail  a  certain  degree  of  legally  permissible
extrapolation  of  potential,  rather  than  actual,  risk  of  compromise  of  classified
information.
Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be  “in  terms of the
national  interest  and  shall  in  no  sense  be  a  determination  as  to  the  loyalty  of  the
applicant concerned.” See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites
for access to classified or sensitive information).

to  her cousin  or  her mother’s  side  of the  family. She  has  a  friend  from  her youth  who  is
an  Iranian  citizen. He  was a  resident  of  Iran,  but he  moved  to  the  United  Arab  Emirates.
She  has not seen  her friend  since  he  visited  the  United  States  about  ten  years ago. She
has electronic contact with  him  a  few  times a  year. (Tr. at 32, 46-48, 67-69, 76-78, 82-

Applicant erred on the side of caution when she reported her foreign contacts on
her  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86).  She  reported  an  Iranian
citizen  and  resident  who  was  her  tutor  in  Iran  in  2003.  Applicant  has  minimal  contact
with him, usually on holidays, but she has not seen him since the last time she was in
Iran  more  than  15  years  ago.  One  of  Applicant’s  cousins  moved  to  Russia  from  the
United States for a business opportunity. Applicant visited Russia in about 2015. While
she  was  there  she  stopped  and  visited  her  cousin.  Applicant  has  had  minimal contact
with  her  cousin  before  and  after  the  trip  to  Russia.  Applicant  reported  her  tour  guides

"The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant’s  mother  is  a  citizen  of  Iraq  and  resides  in  the
United Kingdom (U.K.) (SOR 1.a), and that his father is a citizen and resident of Iraq (SOR
1.b). The SOR also alleged that Applicant’s two brothers are Iraqi citizens residing in the
United States (SOR 1.c), and that his sister is an Iraqi citizen living in the Czech Republic
(SOR 1.d).
Additionally, it was alleged that Applicant’s father-in-law is an Iraqi citizen living in
Iraq and working as an Iraqi government official (SOR 1.e); that one of his four sisters-in-
law  is  an  Iraqi  citizen  who  works  as  an  Iraqi  government  official  assigned  to  the  Iraqi
Embassy in the United States (SOR 1.f); that one of Applicant’s brothers-in-law is an Iraqi
citizen living in Iraq and serving as an officer in the Iraqi Ministry of Interior (SOR 1.g);
and  that  another  brother-in-law  is  an  Iraqi  citizen  living  in  Iraq  and  serving  as  a  non-
commissioned officer (NCO) in an Iraqi counterterrorism unit (SOR 1.h).
Finally, the  SOR alleged  that Applicant’s friend  is a  citizen  of  Yemen and is the
Yemeni ambassador to  the  United  States (SOR 1.i); that Applicant’s cousin is an  Iraqi
citizen living in Oman, and that he once was an Iraqi Army chief executive officer (SOR
1.j); and that Applicant has three other sisters-in-law are Iraqi citizens living in Iraq, the
United Arab Emirates (UAE), and the Netherlands (SOR 1.k).
In response to each of the SOR allegations, Applicant denied that any of the facts
alleged  would  affect  his  ability  to  protect  sensitive  information  and  the  interests  of  the
United States. Nonetheless, the explanations he provided with each response confirmed
the facts alleged and I have entered each of his responses as an admission. (Tr. 9 – 10)
In  addition  to  the  facts  established  by  Applicant’s  admissions,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant  is   40   years  old.   He   was  born  and   raised   in   Iraq,  where   he   lived   and
worked   until  coming   to   the   United   States   at   age   39   with   his  wife   and   twin  children   on
special immigrant  visas  (SIV) in  January  2011. He, along  with  his wife  and  children, also
native-born Iraqi citizens, became  naturalized  U.S. citizens  in May  2016. (Answer; GX  1
–  3; AX D; AX E; Tr. 24)
In Iraq, Applicant earned a bachelor’s degree in an information technology field in
2003. Between 2004 and 2011, he was employed by a series of U.S. companies and non-
governmental  organizations  (NGOs)  working  in  Iraq  in  support  of  U.S.  post-invasion
efforts  there.  Between  January  2009  and  his  departure  from  Iraq  in  January  2011,
Applicant worked for U.S. contractors doing business in support of the U.S. Agency for
International  Development  (USAID).  During  that  time,  he  was  screened  on  multiple
occasions by U.S. counterintelligence personnel for access to the International Zone (IZ)
in Baghdad. His work in support of USAID and other American interests qualified him to
apply for SIVs for him and his family. He began the application process in 2008. (Answer;
GX 1 – 3; AX K; AX L; Tr. 22 – 26, 39)
After  arriving  in  the  United  States,  Applicant  found  work  as  a  linguist,  cultural
advisor, and role player with federal contractors supporting U.S. military training efforts
for the ongoing mission in Iraq. His work has frequently required that he have access to
military  facilities  across  the  United  States.  In  March  2017,  Applicant  was  hired  by  his
current employer, who is sponsoring his request for a security clearance. It is anticipated
that  Applicant  will  work  overseas  in  this  position.  In  May  2017,  Applicant  completed  a
military  counter-intelligence  screening  process  in  preparation  for  his  work  overseas.
During that process, Applicant submitted a detailed list of all of his foreign contacts, most
of whom are immediate and extended family members living in Iraq, the United States,
and elsewhere. That list included the nature of his relationship with those people, their
occupations,  the  frequency  of  his  contact  with  those  people  and  the  last  time  he  had
contact with any of them. In response to government interrogatories in 2019, he submitted
an updated version of that list. (GX 1 – 3; AX K)
Applicant’s parents are citizens of Iraq; however, they are now living in the UK. His
mother is a naturalized British citizen and his father is a permanent resident alien in the
UK. Applicant is in regular contact with them because both are elderly and have medical
challenges. Applicant has not seen either of his parents in person since 2018, when they
visited him in the United States. (GX 1 – 3; AX R – T; Tr. 29 – 30, 58 – 59)
As alleged in SOR 1.c, Applicant has two brothers. One of his brothers lives in the
United States as a naturalized U.S. citizen. Another brother lives in Canada. He is married
to  an  Iraqi  citizen,  Applicant’s  sister-in-law  referenced  in  SOR  1.f.  Until  recently,  she
worked  as  an  Iraqi  diplomatic  official  at  Iraq’s  embassy  in  Washington  D.C.  Both
Applicant’s  brother  and  sister-in-law  are  living  in  Canada,  where  they  were  recently
granted political asylum. (GX 1 – 3; AX P; AX Q; Tr. 30, 45 – 47, 59)
Applicant has one sister. As alleged in SOR 1.d, she is still an Iraqi citizen, but now
lives in the Czech Republic as a permanent resident alien there. Applicant last saw his
sister in 2011. (GX 1 – 3; Tr. 31)
As alleged in SOR 1.e, Applicant’s wife’s father is an Iraqi citizen and still lives in
Iraq. He is an Iraqi government official working in the transportation ministry. Applicant’s
wife’s two brothers are both Iraqi citizens living and working in Iraq. One is an officer in
the Iraqi interior ministry (SOR 1.g) and one is an NCO in an Iraqi counterterrorism unit
(SOR  1.h).  Applicant  has  had  no  direct  contact  with  his  father-in-law  or  either  of  his
brothers-in-law since 2018. Applicant’s wife also has three sisters who are Iraqi citizens
(SOR 1.k). One still lives in Iraq, one lives in the Netherlands, and one lives in the United
Arab Emirates. Applicant last had direct contact with his sisters-in-law in 2011. Applicant’s
wife has occasional contact with her father and siblings; however, Applicant does not ask
about those conversations. (Answer; GX 1 – 3; Tr. 31 – 35, 47 – 48, 57)
Applicant also has a cousin who is an Iraqi citizen living in Oman. When Applicant
disclosed  this  contact  in  2017,  his  cousin  was  a  senior  Iraqi  Army  officer;  however,
Applicant does not know if his cousin is still in the military and, if so, what his current rank
is. Applicant has not had any contact with his cousin since  2016. Before 2016, contact
with his cousin was limited, at most. (GX 1 – 3; Tr. 36, 48)
Applicant has a friend who is a citizen of Yemen and, until December 2020, served
as the Yemeni ambassador to the United States. He is currently Yemen’s foreign minister.
Before becoming an ambassador, he was active in government reform efforts; however,
in the early days of protests underlying the current civil war, he was kidnapped by anti-
government  forces  seeking  leverage  in  negotiations  with  the  Yemen  government.
Applicant first met this person in the 1990s, when the future ambassador and a friend of
Applicant’s  sister  started  dating  while  in college.  Applicant last was  in  contact  with  the
ambassador in 2018 in connection with a visit to the United States by Applicant’s parents.
Before that visit, Applicant had not had any contact with the ambassador since the late
1990s or early 2000s. In 2018, the ambassador hosted a social event at his residence for
Applicant’s parents on the occasion of their visit to see Applicant. Applicant also saw the
ambassador during his parents’ visit when he took his father to visit the ambassador at
the Yemeni embassy. He has not had any contact with the ambassador since then. (GX
1 – 3; GX 6; Tr. 33 – 34, 37 – 39, 48)
Before  Applicant  emigrated  from  Iraq,  and  while  he  was  working  in  support  of
USAID and other American interests, Applicant was threatened with physical violence by
anti-U.S. insurgents.  In  2004,  he  was seen  witnessing  acts  of violence  directed  at Iraqis
who  had  voted  in  the  country’s first democratic election. Insurgents approached him  and
threatened  to  kill him  if  he  continued  to  watch  what was happening.  On  another  occasion,
Applicant became aware that he was on a list for possible  assassination simply because
he  had  been  observed  entering  the  IZ using  U.S.-issued  credentials.  (GX  2; GX  3; Tr. 27
–  28, 44  –  40, 52  –  56)
Applicant has no financial or other interests in Iraq or anywhere else outside the
United States. He still works occasionally as a role player as requested by other defense
contractors. When he is not working as a role player, he drives for Uber or Lyft or delivery
services. Applicant does not discuss the substance of his work as a role player with his
wife;  however,  she  knows  that  he  works  with  the  U.S.  military  and  that  he  may  work
overseas  should  he  receive  a  security  clearance.  Applicant  has  not  discussed  his
defense-related work with anyone else in his family or his wife’s family. As far as they are
concerned, he is a taxi driver in the United States. (GX 3; AX H; Tr. 52 – 55)
Since 2018, Applicant has had no contact with any Iraqi relatives  other than his
parents. Because of their advanced age and health concerns, Applicant contacts them by
phone or social media every week. Because of the counter-intelligence screening, and
after receiving the SOR, Applicant decided to cut off contact with the rest of his relatives
and  his  wife’s  relatives.  For  that  reason,  Applicant  was  unable  to  provide  current
information about his foreign relatives and associates in response to questioning at the
hearing. (Tr. 57 – 59, 61 – 62)
To properly assess the security significance of these facts within the adjudicative
guideline at issue, I have taken administrative notice of certain facts regarding Iraq and
Yemen as presented in GX 4 and 5. As to Iraq, of particular note is the continued inability
of its freely elected government to quell the violence and instability that persist in parts of
Iraq.  These  conditions are  fueled and  perpetrated by  terrorist  groups  affiliated  with  Al-
Qaeda and ISIS, as well as by Sunni insurgents and Iranian-backed Shiite militias. As a
result, some parts of Iraq remain wholly unstable. Even the city of Baghdad is still subject
to random acts of terrorist violence. (GX 4)
U.S. citizens and interests in Iraq remain at high risk for kidnapping and terrorist
violence. The U.S. State Department has advised against all individual travel to Iraq. The
ability of the U.S. Embassy to provide consular services to U.S. citizens outside Baghdad
and the southern city of Basra is extremely limited given the security environment. ISIS
again  controls  significant  portions  of  Iraq’s  territory,  and  numerous  other  terrorist  and
insurgent groups are active in Iraq. Such groups regularly attack both Iraqi security forces
and  civilians.  Anti-U.S.  sectarian  militias  may  also  threaten  U.S.  citizens  and  western
companies  throughout  Iraq.  U.S.  Government  and  western  interests  remain  possible
targets  for  attacks.  Additionally,  there  are  significant  human-rights  problems  in  Iraq.
Widespread corruption, as well as abuses by Iraqi security forces in response to acts of
violence by terrorists and others, have undermined confidence in the Iraqi government
and its judiciary. Human-rights violations by Iraqi law enforcement are not uncommon and
are not being addressed when identified. Those include killing, kidnapping, and extorting
civilians, as well as inhumane conditions in detention and prison facilities, arbitrary arrest
and lengthy pretrial detainment, denial of fair public trial, limits on freedom of expression,
freedom of  the press, censorship of  religion, limits on peaceful assembly,  and societal
abuses of women. The various terrorist and militia organizations are also responsible for
significant human rights abuses in Iraq. (GX 4)
Yemen  achieved  total  independence  in  1990  through  the  unification  of  North
Yemen, a 1918 vestige of the Ottoman Empire that became the Yemen Arab Republic in
1962, and South Yemen, previously the People’s Republic of Southern Yemen until 1967,
when the British withdrew. As to risk assessment, the Government’s information shows
that Yemen has been in a state of civil war since 2015 between the Yemen government
and Houthi rebels. Much of the fighting is supported by a U.S. – Saudi coalition on the
side of government forces, and by Iran on the side of the Houthis. The results have been
catastrophic for Yemen. Iranian-backed terror organizations – notably, Al-Quaida on the
Arabian  Peninsula  (AQAP),  ISIS  –  Yemen  Hezbollah  (IYH),  and  Islamic  Revolutionary
Guard  Force  –  Qods  Force  (IRGC-QF)  –  have  taken  advantage  of  the  inability  of  the
Yemen government to maintain order or provide basic government services to embark on
numerous terror campaigns in much of the country. Famine and a complete lack of human
rights are the norm in much of Yemen. The U.S. State Department has issued a Level 4
(Do Not Travel) warning advising Americans not to travel to Yemen. Because Yemen’s
government  cannot  satisfactorily  screen  persons  traveling  from  Yemen  to  the  United
States, Yemenis are not eligible for the U.S. Visa Waiver Program, an  indication of the
U.S.  government’s  concerns  about  the  possible  export  of  international  terrorism  from
Yemen to the United States. (GX 5)
Applicant is loyal to the United States and expressed pride in the work he has done
for the U.S. military and in support of U.S. interests in Iraq. Persons with whom Applicant
has worked in both capacities recommend him for access to sensitive information based
on their observations of his hard work, honesty, reliability, and trustworthiness in sensitive
circumstances. All of his personal and financial assets are in this country. Applicant does
not provide financial support to anyone outside of the United States. He is registered to
vote  in  the  United  States  and  he  meets  all  of  his  income  tax  reporting  obligations  as

foreclosure  in  2007.  Applicant  stated  that  the  bankruptcies  resulted  from  back  injuries
and extended time off from work. He asserted that his wife at the time did not make their
mortgage  payments  while  he  was  working  overseas  as  a  linguist.  (Tr.  at  36-38;

concerns were mitigated.
Applicant  had  additional  financial  problems  within  a  few  years  of  the  favorable
decision.  The  SOR  alleges  the  two  bankruptcy  cases  and  seven  delinquent  debts
totaling  about  $17,080.  The  debts  are  established  by  credit  reports  and  Applicant’s
admissions. The credit reports indicate that the debts became delinquent between 2012

Applicant  has  settled  and  paid  all  of  the  SOR  debts.  The  $5,002  and  $2,379
debts  to  the  same  credit  card  company  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.e)  were  settled  through
payments  in  2018  for  one  account  and  payments  from  2019  to  2020  for  the  other
account. The creditor issued an IRS Form 1099-C (Cancellation of Debt) in August 2020
cancelling  $3,752,  which  is  the  difference  between  the  amount  that  was  owed  the
creditor and what the creditor received from Applicant in settlement of the debt. (AE D)
Applicant  made  his  final  payment  of  $1,846  in  December  2019  to  settle  the
$3,075  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.b.  (AE  F)  He  paid  a  total  of  $2,900,  with  the  last
payment  in  March  2019,  to  settle  the  $3,006  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.c.  (AE  U)  He
settled the  $2,600 debt  alleged  in SOR ¶  1.d for an undisclosed amount  in  November
2019  (AE  E).  He  settled  the  $1,016  debt  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.f  for  $609,  which  he
completed through payments in September and October 2019. (AE C, T) He paid $280
in October 2019 to resolve the $455 debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g. (AE V)
Applicant’s current finances are sound. He has not accrued  any new delinquent
debts since 2014. He has not remarried. He handles his own finances now. He stated
that online access and payments to accounts are easier than they  used to be, and he
does  not  have  to  rely  on  a  stateside  spouse  to  pay  his  bills  while  he  is  working
overseas. (Tr. at 46-47; GE 7; AE P)

"Through his explanations, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b
(in part), 1.c, 1.d, 1.e (in part), and 1.f. The portions of the allegations that Applicant did
not clearly admit, I consider that he denied. In answering the Amendment to the SOR,
Applicant admitted SOR ¶ 2.a and denied SOR ¶¶ 2.b and 2.c, again with explanations.
His  admissions  and  explanations  are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a
thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony submitted, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 63 years old. Both he and his wife were born, raised, and educated
in  the  former  Soviet  Union,  in  a  Siberian  city,  in  what  is  now  Russia.  They  married  in
1979.  (GE  1  at  26)  Applicant  earned  a  master’s  degree  in  1980  (age  22)  and  a
doctorate in 1983 (age 25) at a prestigious university or academic institution in Siberia.
(GE 1 at 13; Tr. 36-37, 40, 76-77) He has published three books in his field and many
professional and scientific articles. Three times, he was named the best scientist at the
Siberian  academy  or  institute  where  he  worked  until  coming  to  the  United  States.  (Tr.
36-37)
Applicant  and  his  wife  have  three  grown  children  (and  another  son,  who  is
deceased). (Tr. 93) Applicant and his family came to the United States in 1999 when he
was granted entry under an H1B Visa. (Tr. 79-80) Applicant became a naturalized U.S.
citizen in August 2008. (GE 1 at 10)
From 2005 to 2011, Applicant worked for a large defense contractor as a senior
software engineer. He worked for most of 2012 with a large insurance company. From
2013 to early 2016, he was employed by federal contractors. (GE 1 at 18-21) Between
early 2016 and mid-2018, he worked either for federal contractors or independently as a
consultant.  Since  July  2018,  he  has  worked  as  a  cyber-security  specialist  or  software
developer for a federal contractor. (GE 1 at 14-17; GE 2 at 12; Tr. 33, 70-75)
Applicant was granted eligibility for a position of public trust in June 2013 for work
as  a  contractor  with  the  another  government  agency.  He  was  also  granted  a  secret
clearance in October 2016 for similar work with  another government agency. (GE 1 at
55; 2 at 11; Tr. 14, 19, 49, 72)
Applicant and his wife own their home in the United States. (AE B, AE C) He has
a  six-figure  annual salary and  a  net  worth  estimated  in  the mid-six figures.  (Tr. 75-76,
120-121; GE 2 at 8. In Russia, Applicant’s wife worked as a geophysicist. As such, like
Applicant, she was a government employee. She is now a housewife and grandmother.
(GE 2 at 13; Tr. 91-92, 164-165)
Applicant and  his wife  are both  dual U.S.-Russian  citizens. (GE 1  at 25, GE  2  at
13) (SOR ¶¶  1.a, 1.f) They  both  hold valid  Russian  passports. (GE 2  at 13) He declared
on   his SCA  that  “I  want  to   remain   Russian.”   (GE  1   at  9) In   his background   interviews
and   in  his  hearing   testimony,  he   stated   that  he   declined   to   relinquish  his  Russian
citizenship  because   it  is  extremely   difficult  to   do   so,  and   because   keeping   a   Russian
passport allows for easier travel to  Russia  without the  need  for a  visa. (GE 2  at 13, 15;
Tr. 32-36) His parents  and  a  son  are buried  in Russia,  and  he  wants to  be  able to  visit
their gravesites. (GE 2  at 12; Tr. 195)
Applicant testified  that he  uses a  Russian  passport only  to  enter Russia.  He uses
his U.S.   passport   when   he  exits  Russia. When  entering   and  exiting   the   United   States,
he  said he  shows both  passports so  as  to  be  fully  transparent  with  U.S. authorities. He
anticipates that he  will renew  his Russian passport when  it expires in 2025. (Tr. 35,  116-
117)
Applicant  noted   in  his  background   interview   that  he   has  dual  loyalty   and
allegiance,  to   both   Russia  and   the   United   States.   (GE  2   at  13)   He   said   if   the   United
States  and  Russia were to  enter into  conflict,  he  would not  fight for either side.  (GE  2  at
17) He later said if there were a  conflict,  he  would fight against  the  people  causing  the
conflict,   no   matter  who   they   were.  He  said  he   feels  allegiance   to   both   countries,  and
also said he  has no  preference  for either the  U.S. or the  Russian  government.  (GE 2  at
18) This “dual allegiance”  is alleged  in the  SOR as a  personal conduct security  concern.
(SOR ¶ 2.a)
Applicant  testified  that  he  participated  in  compulsory  military  training  while  in
university,  but  never  served  in  either  the  Soviet  or  Russian  military.  (Tr.  77)  When  he
worked  in  Russia  as  a  mathematician  and  scientist,  he  was  considered  a  government
employee.  (Tr.  78)  (Later  in  his  testimony,  he  disputed  that  the  academy  where  he
worked  was  a  government  institution;  he  said  it  was  “independent.”)  (Tr.  195)  He  was
never involved in political organizations or the Communist Party. “All my heart is here,”
he  said.  All  of  his  family  are  in  the  U.S.  but  for  his  father-in-law.  (Tr.  33,  67)  He
reiterated these sentiments in closing, and said he would never “be  a  spy against  [his]
grandkids” from  here  (the  United  States.  (Tr.  194-195)  He  is proud  of  his professional
recognition in Russia, but he said, “I came here to make this country better.” (Tr. 195)
Applicant’s three grown children, all born in the 1980s, now live in the U.S., near
Applicant and his wife, and are all naturalized U.S. citizens. (GE 1 at 28-31; GE 2 at 13;
Tr. 66) One son is an engineer; another son works in investments; and their daughter is
a housewife, married to an American. Their daughter has two young children, both born
in the United States. (Tr. 65-67, 93, GE 2 at 16)
SOR  ¶  1.b  alleges  that  all  three  of  Applicant’s  children  are  dual  U.S.-Russian
citizens. In his SOR Answer, Applicant said only his daughter is a dual citizen. His two
sons have lived in the U.S. for 20 years,  have not had active Russian passports since
2012, and have not travelled to Russia for several years before then. (Answer; Tr. 65).
His  daughter  travelled  to  Russia  once  for  medical  treatment  a  few years  ago.  (Tr. 66)
There  is  no  indication  that  Applicant’s  two  sons  have  renounced  their  Russian
citizenship (something which Applicant testified is very difficult to do).
Applicant’s parents are deceased, as is his mother-in-law. (GE 1 at 27-28, 33) He
has one sister, who lives in Germany. (Tr. 108, GE 2 at 6)
Applicant’s  father-in-law,  age  89,  is  a  citizen  and  resident  of  Russia.  (Tr.  93)
(SOR  ¶  1.c)  He  is  a  retired  scientist  and  engineer.  As  such,  he  was  considered  a
government  employee.  His  father-in-law  is  blind,  an  invalid  and  has  been  in  a  nursing
home  since  June  2020.  He  was  moved  there  with  the  help  of  a  neighbor,  A,  and  a
daughter from his second marriage. (GE 2 at 14-16; Tr. 96-97, 149, 166-168))
Applicant and his wife see her father in person when they visit Russia. (GE 1 at
31-32; Tr. 95) He rarely speaks to his father-in-law by phone, but his wife speaks to her
father briefly about once a week. (GE 2 at 15; Tr. 95, 149-151) She is very close to her
father. She helped care for him and her brother after her mother died after a long illness
when  Applicant’s wife  was a teenager. (Tr. 151-152) Applicant’s wife  provides financial
support to her father, as discussed below. His wife’s father has four children from  later
marriages.  Applicant’s  wife  has  little  contact  with  them  because  of  the  age  difference.
(Tr. 167-170) They are not alleged in the SOR.
Applicant’s brother-in-law is a citizen and resident of Russia. He lives in Siberia.
He is a scientist and Russian government employee. Applicant has no contact with him.
(Tr. 109) He was not alleged in the SOR.
Applicant  and  his  wife  travelled  to  Russia  for  vacations  and  family  visits  in  the
summers of 2009, 2015, 2017, and 2019. (GE 1 at 37, 46, 49; GE 2 at 9). Applicant has
not been back to Russia since July 2019. (Tr. 135)
While  studying  and  working  at  the  institute  in  Siberia,  Applicant  and  his  family
lived for several years in a dormitory. In about 1995, because of his excellent work, he
was allowed to move to a small, university-owned apartment. The apartment was only a
few  hundred  square  feet.  (Answer;  Tr.  36-37,  78-79;  AE  A)  Applicant  and  his  family
were  granted  ownership  of  the  apartment  through  privatization  of  state  property  in  the
mid-1990s,  after  the  collapse  of  the  Soviet  Union.  They  were  granted  ownership  but
could not sell it. (Tr. 152-153; AE A)
They maintained ownership of the unit after they emigrated to the United States,
and continue to own the unit now. The apartment is owned jointly by Applicant, his wife,
and their children (not solely by his wife, as alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d). The alleged value of
the unit (about $30,000 US) is noted in the record (GE 2 at 12; Tr. 80) but the true value
is not documented. Applicant and his wife have had renters in the past, and they used
the rental income (of about $250 a month, as alleged) to support Applicant’s father. (GE
2  at 13) The unit  is currently vacant,  because  of the pandemic.  (Answer; Tr.  68) They
last  had  renters  about  a  year  ago.  (Tr.  81)  Applicant  had  no  direct  contact  with  any
renters. (GE 2 at 17; Tr. 63-64, 81-82)
Applicant indicated during his background interview that he may want to keep the
apartment and live there in retirement, in part, he said, because it is expensive to retire
in the United States. (See GE 2 at 17-18) Applicant declined at hearing to confirm this
as  he  made  that  statement  during  his  background  interview  (though  he  adopted  the
interview  summaries  in  GE  2  as  accurate  without  making  changes).  Regarding  his
present intent, he testified that he has not decided where to retire. (Tr. 84-91)
Applicant noted that he has to pay taxes and utilities (energy and water)  for the
Russian  apartment  “even  if  we  don’t  use  it.”  (Tr.  62-63)  He  said  his  wife  is  more
involved  with  that  process  than  he  is.  (Tr.  83-84)  He  also  stated  that  he  and  his  wife
stay  at  the  apartment  when  they  visit  Russia.  (Tr.  80,  84,  112-116)  Applicant
acknowledged that he still owned the property, still used it, and was technically allowed
to sell it. (Tr. 132) However, he said that selling the unit is difficult, as it would require all
of the family members to travel to Russia, and his children do not want to do that. (Tr.
37-42, 153-155) Applicant said the apartment is in disrepair. He would like to “get rid of
it.”  (Tr.  37-38)  In  a  post-hearing  letter,  Applicant  expressed  a  willingness  to  relinquish
his ownership of the apartment to his granddaughter. (AE H)
Both Applicant and his wife were born in 1958. When his wife turned 55 (in 2013)
and  when  he  turned  60  (in  2018),  they  both  became  eligible  to  receive  a  monthly
financial  benefit  from  the  Russian  government.  She  did  not  learn  of  her  eligibility  until
later. (Tr. 159-163) Applicant’s wife  said  she  has been receiving the benefit money for
about five years. (Tr. 175)
The  amount  of  the  benefits  Applicant  and  his  wife  both  receive  is  equivalent  to
about  $120  US  per  month  (not  $200  per  month,  as  alleged).  (SOR  ¶¶  1.d,  1.e)  The
benefit is available to any Russian citizen and does not appear to be based on the fact
that both Applicant and his wife are former Russian government employees. At various
times,  Applicant  described  the  benefit  as  a  “pension,”  (GE  2)  and  at  other  times  he
disputed that term. (Tr. 60, 63) Regardless, the money seems to be the equivalent of a
social  security  payment  or  benefit  from  the  Russian  government,  available  to  Russian
citizens above a certain age.
Applicant’s  wife   uses  her   monthly   benefit   to   support  her  elderly   father.  (SOR  ¶
1.e)   She   uses  the   money   for  her  father’s  medical  care,  which  costs  the   equivalent  of
about $500  US  per  month. (Tr. 46-47,  117) She  noted  that her father, being  in  his 80s,
also receives a  financial benefit from  the  Russian  government,  and  that  money, too, is
used  for his nursing care. (Tr. 156-159)
The primary caregiver for Applicant’s father-in-law is a neighbor, A, who is herself
retired  and  in  her  80s.  A  is  a  long-time,  trusted  acquaintance  of  the  family.  Applicant
and  his  wife  have  given  A  authority  to  withdraw  funds  from  his  wife’s  Russian  bank
account  (like  a  power  of  attorney)  for  the  father’s  care.  A  also  manages  Applicant’s
apartment  in  Siberia  and  sees  to  it  that  the  taxes  and  utility  bills  are  paid.  (Tr.  82-83,
143-144, 172-173) Applicant has contact with A about once a year. However, Applicant
and  his wife  are  “very  close”  to A. A is retired from a job as a technician at a Russian
academic institute. (Tr. 110-111) Other than A and his father-in-law, Applicant maintains
contact with no other Russian citizens. (Tr. 108)
Applicant’s $120 monthly benefit is deposited into an account at Russian Bank S
set up for that purpose. (GE 2 at 7, 16) (SOR ¶ 1.e) Applicant has never withdrawn the
money, which accumulates in that account. (Tr. 45. 117, 159, AE E) He said that for him
to do so, he would have to travel to Russia, which would cost more money than is in the
account.  (Tr.  42-43,  80,  104)  He  said  he  was  not  contacted  about  the  account,  but  it
was widely publicized in the media when the benefit system was established. (Tr. 105)
He  has  taken  no  active  steps  to  close  the  Russian  bank  account  or  to  renounce  the
pension.  (Tr.  105-107)  After  the  hearing,  Applicant  provided  a  letter  for  the  record
indicating  that  the  account  contains  the  equivalent  of  $3,419  US.  He  is  willing  to
relinquish ownership of it and transfer it to his wife. (AE I)
When  he  submitted  his  August  2018  SCA,  Applicant  did  not  disclose  the
apartment in Russia, the Russian bank accounts, or the benefits he and his wife receive
from the Russian government. These omissions are alleged as deliberate falsifications
under Guideline E (SOR ¶¶ 2.b, 2.c)
Section 20A of Applicant’s August 2018 SCA (Foreign Financial Interests – Real
legally  recognized  domestic  civil
Estate)  asks,  “Have  you,  your  spouse,  or
union/domestic  partner,  cohabitant,  or  dependent  children  EVER  owed,  or  do  you
anticipate  owning,  or  plan  to  purchase  real  estate  in  a  foreign  country?”  Applicant
answered “No.” (GE 1 at 34)
SOR ¶ 2.b alleges that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose that his wife owns
an  apartment  in  Russia  and  receives  about  $250  in  monthly  rental  income  from  it  (as
alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d). Applicant denied SOR ¶ 2.b, asserting that he had answered the
question correctly on his SCA because he was receiving no financial benefit or rent at
that time, and also because he was not able to sell it. (Answer, Tr. 64)
At his hearing, Applicant asserted that he misunderstood the question because it
was not stated clearly. (Tr. 62, 139-140) He stated he did not want to lie and intended to
be truthful. (Tr. 140) He asserted that the question asked about property being used for
“commercial  purposes.”  (Tr.  62)  (The  question  does  not  actually  refer  to  “commercial
purposes.) (GE 1 at 34) Applicant also testified that he  answered  “no” because  he  did
not pay attention to the full question on the SCA, and focused more on the portion of the
question asking about plans to purchase real estate in the future. (Tr. 124-126)
Section  20A  of  Applicant’s  August  2018  SCA  (Foreign  Financial  Interests  –
Foreign Benefit) asks, “As a  U.S.  citizen, have  you,  your spouse, or legally recognized
domestic civil union/domestic partner, cohabitant, or dependent children received in the
last  seven  (7)  years,  or  are  eligible  to  receive  in  the  future,  any  educational,  medical,
retirement,  social  welfare,  or  other  such  benefit  from  a  foreign  country?”  Applicant
answered “No.” (GE at 34)
SOR  ¶  2.c  alleges  that  Applicant  deliberately  failed  to  disclose  that  he  and  his
wife  receive  monthly  pensions  from  Russia  (SOR  ¶¶  1.e  and  1.f)  in  answer  to  that
question.  Applicant  denied  SOR  ¶  2.c.  He  stated  that,  he  learned  during  the  family’s
2017 trip to Russia that he may be eligible for a pension (since he was soon to turn 60).
He went to the pension office but they were not able to provide confirmation.  (Answer;
Tr.  99-103)  In  2019,  when  they  again  visited  Russia,  Applicant  learned  that  he  was
eligible and that the equivalent of  about $100 a month in benefits  had been deposited
into  an  account at  Russian  bank  S, beginning on  May 15,  2018.  However, he  said  he
did  not  know  about  the  deposits  when  he  prepared  his  SCA  in  August  2018,  so  his
answer was truthful. (Answer) (Tr. 50-61; AE E) Applicant testified that he learned from
his wife that she had money in  her Russian account that she was using for her father.
She then suggested that he might have an account as well. (Tr. 141)
Applicant’s wife  testified  that Applicant  was not aware that the money had been
deposited  into  the  account until 2019,  because  “we  had  no  connection  to  it.” (Tr. 162)
She also said they went to the bank in 2017, before he turned 60. (Tr. 176)
Applicant’s first background  interview  occurred  in November 2018.  He reviewed
his  SCA  with  the  interviewing  agent,  and  discussed  his  family  members,  including  his
father-in-law,  his  employment  history  and  his  dual  citizenship.  He  also  discussed  the
apartment in Russia, and the fact that his wife had used the rental income from the unit
to  support her father-in-law.  There  was  no  discussion  of  the  issue  of  monthly benefits
from the Russian government. (GE 2 at 11-13)
Applicant  testified  that  he  did  not  learn  about  the  bank  account  in  Russia  until
2019. (Tr. 45, 117) He testified, “I don’t care about this pension,” and “I never saw these
statements before I arrived [in] Russia in August 2019.” (Tr. 136-137, 141-142) He and
his wife travelled to Russia in July and August 2019. (GE 2 at 9) Yet he discussed the
bank  accounts  and  the  financial  benefits  in  his  second  background  interview,  which
occurred in June 2019, before that trip. (GE 2 at 14)
During  that  June  2019  interview,  Applicant  disclosed  both  his  and  his  wife’s
Russian bank accounts, and the fact that they both received monthly benefits from the
Russian   government.  He  also  disclosed   that   his   wife   used   her  monthly   benefits   to
support her father. (GE  2  at 16)  He said in the  interview  that he  did  not list the  accounts
because  of the  small  amounts of  money  involved. (GE 2  at  16)  He  testified  that he  did
not  hide   the   apartment  or  the   money   that  had   accumulated   in  the   accounts.   (Tr.  140,
142) He disclosed  the  assets during  his interview  when  he  was asked  about  them. (Tr.
143)
Applicant’s  discussion  of  the  accounts  and  the  benefits  during  his  second
interview calls into question the veracity of his testimony and explanation in his Answer
that he learned of the accounts and the deposits during his 2019 trip to Russia – since
that  trip  occurred  a  month  after his  second background  interview.  (Tr.  128-131)  At  his
hearing, Applicant acknowledged that he knew in 2017 that he might be eligible for such
benefits, when the pension office told him about them. (Tr. 127-128)
Section  20  of  Applicant’s  SCA  also  includes  a  question  asking,  “Have  you  ever
provided  financial  support  to  any  individual?”  Applicant  answered,  “No.”  (GE  1  at  34)
Applicant explained during his testimony that his answer was truthful because it was his
wife who provided financial support to her father, using her money. However, they also
used money collected as rental income from their jointly owned apartment in Russia. He
also said it was possible that his wife supported her father using money Applicant had
earned in the United States. (Tr. 133-135) Falsification of this question is not alleged in
the SOR.
Applicant  testified  that he  loves  his job and his work and  has  provided  value  to
his  federal  agency.  (Tr.  47-48)  He  testified  that  he  is  an  honest  man,  not  involved  in
politics, doing good work that improves or provides value to his job. Loss of his job will
damage his family. He does not intend to switch jobs at his age, and expects to retire in
three to five years. (Tr. 69, 74)
Applicant’s wife testified that her husband is “the most hard-working person.” He
is very knowledgeable and effective at work. His company appreciates him and the help
he provides them. (Tr. 183-184)
Five co-workers of Applicant’s, including a supervisor, provided recommendation
letters  attesting  to  his  character.  He  has  excellent  professional  skills  and  is  very
knowledgeable. He is well respected and appreciated. He has an excellent work ethic.
He is mission-oriented, reliable, and responsible. (AE F) Two long-time personal friends
of  Applicant’s  provided  reference  letters.  They  both  regard  Applicant  as  reliable,
responsible, honest, and compassionate. (AE G)
Russia
The  Russian  Federation  has  a  highly  centralized,  authoritarian  political  system
dominated by President Vladimir Putin. (AN Item I) The Office of the Director of National
Intelligence  (ODNI)  has  determined  that  Russia  is  a  highly  capable  and  effective
adversary,  integrating  ongoing  cyber-espionage,  attack,  and  influence  operations  to
achieve  its political and  military  objectives. The  ODNI expects that Russia’s intelligence

In  its  2018  Foreign  Economic  Espionage  in  Cyberspace  Report,  the  National

The  ODNI  has  reported  that  Russian  efforts  to  influence  the  2016  U.S.
presidential election demonstrated a significant escalation in directness, level of activity,
and scope of effort compared to previous operations.  The ODNI assessed that Russia
would again attempt to influence the 2020 U.S. elections.  Russia’s persistent objective
is to weaken the United States and diminish its global role. (AN Items IV and V)
The  United  States  imposes  sanctions  on  Russian  persons  and  entities  in

According   to   the   U.S.  State   Department’s  website,  the   State   Department’s
current  Travel  Advisory   for  Russia   is  Level  4:  Do   Not   Travel,  due   to   COVID-19   and
related   entry   restrictions,  terrorism,   harassment  by   Russian   government  security
officials,  the   U.S.  Embassy’s  limited   ability   to   assist   U.S.   citizens  in  Russia,   and   the
arbitrary enforcement of local law. The current travel advisory, dated November 2, 2021,
is  substantially   similar   to   AN  Item   XXI,   the   State   Department’s  Travel  Advisory  for
Russia  from August 2020.
U.S.  citizens,  including   former  and   current  U.S.  government   and   military
personnel  and   private   citizens  engaged   in   business,  who   are  visiting   or  residing   in
Russia  have  been  interrogated  without cause,  threatened  by  Russian  officials,  and  may
become   victims  of   harassment,   mistreatment,   and   extortion.  All   U.S.  government
personnel should carefully consider their need to  travel to Russia.  (AN Item XXI)
Russian  security  services  have  arrested  U.S.  citizens  on  spurious  charges,
denied  them  fair  and  transparent  treatment,  and  have  convicted  them  in  secret  trials
without  presenting  evidence.  Russian  officials  may  unreasonably  delay  U.S.  consular
assistance  to  detained  U.S.  citizens.  Russian  authorities  arbitrarily  enforce  local  laws
10
against   U.S.  citizen   religious  workers  and   open   questionable  criminal  investigations
against  such  individuals. Russian  security  services are increasingly arbitrarily  enforcing
local laws targeting  foreign  and  international organizations they  consider “undesirable,”
and   U.S.  citizens  should  avoid  travel  to   Russia   to   perform   work  for  or  volunteer  with
non-governmental organizations.  (AN Item XXI)
Russia  enforces  special  restrictions  on  dual  U.S.-Russian  nationals  and  may
refuse to acknowledge dual nationals’ U.S. citizenship, including denying access to U.S.
consular assistance and preventing their departure from Russia. (AN Item XXI)
Terrorist  groups,  transnational  and  local  terrorist  organizations,  and  individuals
inspired  by  extremist  ideology  continue  plotting  possible  attacks  in  Russia.  Terrorists
may  attack  with  little  or  no  warning,  targeting  tourist  locations,  transportation  hubs,
markets,  shopping  malls,  local  government  facilities,  hotels,  clubs,  restaurants,  places
of  worship,  parks, major sporting and  cultural events,  educational institutions,  airports,
and other public areas. (AN Item XXI)
Telephone and electronic communications in Russia are subject to surveillance,
which  can  potentially  compromise  sensitive  information.  The  Russian  System  for
Operational-Investigative  Activities  permits  authorities  to  monitor  and  record  all  data
lawfully that traverses Russia’s networks. (AN Item XXIII)

",True
"Applicant  admitted  each  of  the  allegations  in  the  SOR.  After  a  thorough  and
careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of
fact.
Applicant is 40 years old and married.  She has a Master’s degree in Mechanical
Engineering.  She  currently  holds  the  position  of  Manufacturing  Engineer.  She  is
applying  for  a  security  clearance  in  connection  with  her  employment  with  a  defense
contractor.  Applicant began working for her current employer in July 2018.
Applicant was born in Turkey and grew up there.  She entered the United States
in  1997,  with  her  family,  on  a  green  card,  and  became  a  permanent  legal  resident.
Applicant attended one semester at a university in the United States  and changed her
major.  She  then  applied  to  and  attended  another  university  more  fitting  for  her  new
major.  Applicant  completed  her  Master’s  degree  program  in  2004.  That  same  year,
she  became  a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen.  After  graduating  from  college,  Applicant
returned to Turkey.  She explained that it was customary for her to return to Turkey for
several months during the summer breaks while in college to visit her family and friends
It  is  noted  that  Applicant  was  financially  supported  by  her  father  in  Turkey
there.
throughout her college education.  Applicant stated that she did not get along with her
mother, and wanted to stay away from her.  (Tr. pp. 35-40.)
From 2004 to 2009, Applicant worked off and on in the United States, and did not
find a job that fulfilled her.  She was laid off from her last job in the United  States after
two  and  a  half  years  of  employment.  Due  to  parental  pressures,  concern  about  her
father’s health, and lack of employment, she chose to relocate back to Turkey in August
2009. (Tr. pp. 40-45, and Applicant’s Answer to SOR.)
Once  in  Turkey,  Applicant  established  her  roots  there.  In  2011,  she  married  a
Turkish  man,  who  was  a  dentist.  Applicant  states  that  when  she  married  him  she
wanted  to  relocate  to  the  United  States,  but  she  never  discussed  the  issue  with  him
before they married.  He had no interest in coming to the United States.  They divorced
in March 2017.  (Tr. pp. 67-60.)
From November 2009 to July 2018, Applicant worked for the Turkish Aerospace
Industries (TAI), manufacturing and providing various forms of military aircraft,  drones,
unmanned  surveillance  and  other  aerospace  equipment  exclusively  for  the  Turkish
Government.  Over the nine years she worked there, she advanced from a tool design
engineer  to  a  manufacturing  engineer,  and  program  leader,  a  position  she  enjoyed.
While  in Turkey,  working for TAI, Applicant  developed many engineering contacts and
met  employees  who  worked  for  her  current  employer  in  the  U.S.  Some  of  them  had
long-term  contracts  working  for  Applicant’s  current  employer  and  were  assigned  to
Turkey.  Applicant  established  communications  with  these  individuals  while  they  were
working  in  Turkey.  Over  time  they  became  good  friends  and  Applicant  ultimately
learned about her current job position in the U.S. from one of these individuals.  (Tr. p.
53.)
In  2018,  Applicant,  from  Turkey,  applied  for  the  position  with  her  current
employer.  She  was  interviewed  over  the  telephone  and  hired.  (Tr.  p.  91.)  Applicant
moved to the United States in July 2018, and began working for her current employer.
In  2019,  she  met  her  current  husband,  a  Turkish  national.  They  were  married  in
November 2020.  (Tr. p. 62.)  He has an extension on his green card, and recently filed
an  application  for  a  new  green  card  based  on  his  marriage  to  the  Applicant.  He  is
currently unemployed.  (Tr. p. 64.)
Applicant maintains contact with friends and former colleagues who are currently
employed  by  the  TAI  in  various  roles  working  on  projects  with  and  for  the  Turkish
military.  (Tr. p. 102.)
Applicant’s  has  a  number  of  family  members  who  are  citizens  and  residents  of
Turkey.  These family members include Applicant’s father, mother, husband, mother-in-
law, and a cousin.  Applicant’s two  brothers are dual-citizens of Turkey and the United
States.  Her older brother resides  in the United States.  He has a Ph.D  in Mechanical
Engineering,  is  a  professor  at  a  University  here,  and  owns  his  own  company.  As  a
professor,  he  is  involved  in  a  rotational  teaching  program  allowing  him  to  travel  to
various universities within the United States to teach or conduct research.  He has not
traveled to Turkey for about eight or nine years.  Applicant testified that she maintains
regular  contact  with  her  older  brother  who  resides  in  the  United  States.  She  speaks
with him about twice a week.  They discuss matters pertaining their parents health and
well-being.
Applicant’s younger brother was born in the United States, but returned to Turkey
as  an  infant.
In  2014,  he  moved  from  Turkey  to  the  U.S,  to  attend  college.  He  has
recently moved to Texas, and working for a company there.  Applicant has not had any
contact with him for several years.
The  evidence  about  her  foreign  connections  was  conflicting  and  mixed.
Applicant stated that, “I hated living in Turkey, especially as a woman, so I was looking
(Tr.  p.  50.)  However,  despite  becoming  a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen,
for  ways  out.”
Applicant  exercises  Turkish  residency.  Applicant  maintains  a  bank  account  in  Turkey
that has about $200 U.S. dollars in it.  She keeps this account open to help her mother if
she  needs  money.  She  also  does  not  want  to  ask  her  parents  for  money  when  she
visits  Turkey.  Applicant  voted  in  two  elections  in  Turkey,  including  the  most  recent
Presidential election that occurred in July 2018 because she did not like the President in
Turkey.  Applicant is also eligible to receive a pension from Turkey when she meets the
age  requirement.  She  believes  it  will  amount  to  about  $300  a  month  when  she  is  50
years  old.  Applicant  also  has  a  valid  Turkish  passport  and  uses  it  in  lieu  of  her  U.S.
passport  to  reenter  Turkey  for  convenience  purposes  when  she  travels  there.  (Tr.  p.
69.)
In  assessing  the  heightened  risk  created  as  a  result  of  Applicant  holding  a
security  clearance,  the  Applicant’s  ties  to  a  hostile  country  are  important.  However,
even countries friendly to the United States have attempted to gain unauthorized access
to  classified  information.  Under  the  particular  facts  of  this  case,  I  have  taken
administrative  notice  of  the  information  provided  concerning  the  Country  of  Turkey.
Turkey  is  a  constitutional  republic  with  an  executive  presidential  system  and  a
unicameral  600  seat  parliament  (the  Grand  National  Assembly).  The  U.S.-Turkey
relationship dates back to 1831, when the Unites States established diplomatic relations
with the Ottomar Empire.  Over the years, the U.S. has been committed to emphasizing
the importance of the Turkish government’s adherence to policies and actions that build
public  trust  in  the  country’s  democractic  institutions  and  the  rule  of  law,  as  well  as
upholding  human  rights  commitments.
In  recent  years,  democracy  in  Turkey  has
continued  to  deteriorate.  President  Erdogan has  ruled Turkey since  2003,  and  during
that time has expanded his control over Turkey and its institutions.  U.S. and European
Union  officials  have  expressed  a  number  of  concerns  about  authoritarian  governance
and erosion of rule of law and civil liberties in Turkey.  Turkey is a member of the UN,
NATO,  and  the  Global  Coalition  to  Defeat  ISIS.  However,  due  to  Turkey’s  regional
ambitions and  a  distrust of  the  United  States, the  growing  authoritarianism  of Turkey’s
leaders  are  complicating  the  bilateral  relationship  and  make  Turkey  more  willing  to
challenge  U.S.  regional  goals.  Besides  Covid  restrictions,  travelers  are  to  exercise
increased  caution  due  to  terrorism  and  arbitrary  detentions.  There  are  high-threat
locations for terrorism in Turkey directed at affecting official U.S. Government interests,
western  tourists  and  expatriates.  Turkey  is  a  source  of  transit  for  foreign  terrorist
fighters seeking  to  join  ISIS  and  other  terrorist  groups  fighting  in Syria  and  Iraq.  ISIS
and ISIS offshoot organizations have a significant presence in northern Syria, and along
portions  of  the  Turkish/Syrian  border.  The  Kurdistan  People’s Congress  (also  Kongra
Gel,  KGK;  and  Kurdistand  Worker’s  Party,  PKK)  has  been  the  most  active  terrorist
organization  in  Turkey,  targeting  Turkish  government  facilities  and  infrastructure.
Human Rights and fundamental freedoms violations and a compromised rule of law has
resulted  in  many  arbitrary  killings,  torture,  detention  of  tens  of  thousands  of  persons
including former opposition members of parliament, lawyers, journalists, foreign citizens,
elected officials, and employees of the U.S. Mission.  There are severe restrictions on
freedom  of  expression,  threats  and  violence  toward  judicial  independence,  the  press,
unjustified arrests or criminal prosecutions for criticizing government policies or officials.

"Applicant  admitted   both   of   the   SOR   allegations.  He   is  40   years  old.  He  was   a
Pakistani  citizen  born  in the  UAE. His parents, both  Pakistani-born citizens, lived  in the
UAE  because  his father started  working  as an  electrician  there in the  1970s. Applicant,
along  with  his mother and  siblings,  moved  to  Pakistan  when he  was in the  10th  grade  of
high  school; his  father  continued  to  live  and  work in the  UAE.  He  graduated  from  high
school in Pakistan  in 1999. In  2000, at age  19, Applicant emigrated  from  Pakistan  to  the
United  States on a  student visa. He earned  a  bachelor’s degree  in computer information
systems in 2007. He married  a  native-born U.S. citizen, who  he  met in college, in  2009,
and   they   have   three   minor  children,  all   of  whom   were  born  in  the   United   States.  He
became  a  naturalized  U.S. citizen  and  was issued  a  U.S. passport  in November 2012.
Applicant  is  a   cyber-engineer,   and   he   has   worked   for  his  current  employer,  a   DOD
contractor, since  2018.  He has never held a  security  clearance.  (Answer; Tr. at  7-8, 61-

Applicant’s siblings are Pakistani citizens. As of  the   date  of  the  hearing, his 35-
year-old brother resided  in the  UAE; two  of  his sisters, ages 38  and  34,  who  previously
resided  in  the  UAE, resided  in Pakistan;  and  his 29-year-old  sister  resided  in  the  United
States.  Applicant’s brother works for a  U.S.-based  insurance  company  in the  UAE.  His
38-year-old  sister lives with her second spouse  in Pakistan. His 34-year-old  sister, along
with   her  spouse   and   children,  moved   to   Pakistan   in   late   2020.  As  of   the   date   of   the
hearing, both  sisters were  unemployed; they  previously  worked  as project coordinators
for  private  companies.  Applicant’s  29-year-old  sister,  who  became  a  permanent  U.S.
resident  in  early  2021,  lives  with  her husband,  and  they  own  and operate  several  gas
stations in their state. (Tr. at 61-142; GE 1, 2; AE B, C, D, E)
Applicant maintains quarterly telephonic and electronic contact with his siblings.
He gave wedding gifts of approximately $500 to his 34-year-old sister in 2009, $400 to
his  29-year-old  sister  in  2017,  and  $400  each  to  his  brother  and  38-year-old  sister  in
2021.  He  has  never  financially  supported  his  siblings.  Applicant  petitioned  to  the  U.S.
Department  of  Homeland  Security,  U.S.  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Services,  for  his
brother in the UAE and sisters in Pakistan  to move to the United States in 2015; as of
the date of the hearing, his petitions were pending. (Tr. at 61-142; GE 1, 2; AE B, C, D,
E)
Applicant testified that his 38-year-old sister’s husband works for an oil company
in  Pakistan;  Applicant  spoke  to  him  once,  which  was  before  he  married  Applicant’s
sister in 2021. Applicant was unaware who his 34-year-old sister’s husband’s employer
was  in  Pakistan,  but  stated  that  he  previously  worked  for  a  U.S.-based  shipping
company in the UAE. Applicant was unaware of any family members in Pakistan having
worked for the Pakistani government or military. (Tr. at 61-142; GE 1)
Applicant’s 67-year-old parents, who he sponsored to move to the United States,
are permanent U.S. residents, who have lived with him since approximately 2016. They
intend to apply for U.S. citizenship once they are eligible to do so. His father is retired,
although he recently began delivering pizzas to stay active. His mother has always been
a stay-at-home wife and mother. Since moving to the United States, they have traveled
to  Pakistan  twice  and  the  UAE  once,  all  without  Applicant.  In  2017,  they  traveled  to
Pakistan  to  attend  Applicant’s  29-year-old  sister’s  wedding;  they  also  provided  her
approximately  $5,000  to  help  her  pay  for  her  wedding.  In  early  2021,  they  traveled  to
the UAE to attend Applicant’s  brother’s wedding, and  they  also traveled  to  Pakistan  to
attend Applicant’s 38-year-old sister’s wedding. They provided $1,000 to his brother and
$2,000 to this sister to help pay for their respective 2021 weddings. Applicant chose not
to travel to the UAE or Pakistan in 2021 to attend these siblings’ weddings, because he
had already been notified that his connection with his siblings could potentially affect his
ability to obtain a security clearance. Applicant’s parents stay with Applicant’s aunt and
uncle  during  their  trips  to  Pakistan.  His  uncle  is  a  cloth  weaver  and  the  women  in  his
family have never worked outside the home. (Tr. at 61-142; GE 1, 2; AE F)
Prior to becoming a U.S. citizen, Applicant traveled to Pakistan twice--in 2004 to
visit  his  family,  and  in  2009,  with  his  wife,  to  attend  his  34-year-old  sister’s  wedding.
Since becoming a U.S. citizen, he has traveled to the UAE twice and to Pakistan once,
all  on  his  U.S.  passport.  He  relinquished  his  previous  Pakistani  passports  to  his
previous  employer  for destruction  in  2015.  He  traveled  to  the  UAE  in  2012  to  visit  his
parents, who lived there at the time. He again traveled to the UAE in 2016. Initially, he
planned this UAE trip to attend his brother’s wedding; he chose to proceed with this trip
because  he  only  received  notice,  two  days  before  he  was  scheduled  to  depart  the
United States, that his brother’s wedding was postponed. In 2019, he joined his father in
Pakistan  to  visit  his  ill  grandmother  and  attend  his  cousin’s  wedding;  he  reported  this
trip to his employer. Like his parents, he also stayed with his aunt and uncle during his
trips to Pakistan. (Tr. at 61-142; GE 1, 2)
Between 2018 to 2019, while Applicant was assigned to a work project in Saudi
Arabia,  he  returned  home  to  the  United  States  three  times;  during  each  trip  home,  he
had  a  six  to  seven-hour  layover  in  the  UAE,  and  he  met  his  brother  and  one  of  his
sisters,  who  lived  there  at  the  time,  for  dinner.  After  he  completed  the  project,  he
deliberately  did  not  meet  with  his  brother  or  sister  in  the  UAE  on  his  return  home,
because he had already been notified that they presented a potential security concern.
While in Saudi Arabia, between 2018 and December 2020, he briefly met a cousin, who
works for a Saudi oil or gas company, for lunch. He had not seen this cousin in years
and he has not since had further contact with this cousin.  (Tr. at 16-142; GE 2)
Applicant stated  that his wife, children, and  career in the  United  States are most
important  to  him.  He stated  that  his  parents  are aware that  he  works in the  IT field  for  a
DOD contractor, and  he  has talked  with  them  about not discussing  his employment with
anyone.  His siblings are  only  aware that  he  works in the  IT field.  He  stated  that he  has
undergone   annual   security   training   with   his  employment,   and   he   has  been   trained   to
report  to   the   proper  authorities   any   attempt   by   anyone   to   use   his  siblings  in  the   UAE
and  Pakistan  to  exert any  influence  on  him. He stated,  “I would never compromise  the
U.S. security  for anything,”  and:
And   [the   United   States]  has  given   me   so   much   .  .  .  I  was  born   in  Abu
Dhabi, never a  citizen. . . . even  though  I  went to  Pakistan, I never felt like
I  belonged   there  because   it  was  never  my   country.  I  got  it  through   my
parents, but I never really  basically  lived  there. Or the  only  reason  I  had  to
go  was because  that’s  the  passport I had  at that time  . . . . So  [the  United
States] is where I  came  and basically  accepted me.  Basically  when  I came
here in  the  U.S.,  in  the  country, and  I grew  -- I grew  here. I learned  here. I
was  --  I  became   independent.  And   I  mean   all   my   hard  work,  I  studied.  I
mean  this is where I basically  -- as far as I remember, this is where I see
myself and  my  roots and  all  that.  And  I  have  no  intention  ever to  go  back
to any country.

Applicant purchased his home in the United States for approximately $515,000 in
2016. As of January 2021, he paid  his $400,000 mortgage in full, and the value of his
home, as of the date of the hearing, was approximately $600,000. He owns three cars
that  have  a  combined  value  of  approximately  $20,000.  He  earns  a  base  salary  of
approximately  $192,000  annually,  which  can  increase  to  approximately  $300,000
annually when he is assigned overseas for work. He has $60,000 in his bank accounts,
and  he  has  around  $190,000  in  his  retirement  savings  accounts.  He  also  sets  aside
money  in  a  529  college  savings  plan  for  his  children.  He  does  not  own  any  foreign
property  or  maintain  any  foreign  bank  accounts.  He  has  never  served  in  any  foreign
military  or  voted  in  any  foreign  election.  He  has  voted  in  every  general  election  since
becoming  a  U.S.  citizen,  and  he  has  also  voted  in  primary  elections.  He  and  his  wife
have  been  members  of  their  neighborhood  civic  association  since  they  bought  their
home, and his wife  served as its vice-president as of  the date of the hearing. His wife
also  serves  as  the  leader  of  his  daughter’s  Girl  Scout  troop  and  is  also  a  member  of
their children’s parent teacher association. (Tr. at 16-142; GE 1; AE A, G, H, I).
Prior to Applicant’s parents moving in with him in 2016, Applicant provided them
a total of approximately $130,000 in financial support over the course of 10 to 15 years.
He sent them money “every now and then,” and then he gave them $100,000 that they
used to buy land and build a home in Pakistan, with the intention that they would retire
there. As of the date of the hearing, Applicant’s parents still owned their home and land
in  Pakistan,  and  Applicant  estimated  their  value  was  $100,000  USD  each.  He  stated
that his parents were renting their home in Pakistan, the income from which is used by
his aunt and uncle in Pakistan to maintain the home and land. Applicant stated that his
parents  have  decided  to  remain  in  the  United  States,  and  they  are  in  the  process  of
selling their home and land in Pakistan. He stated that he has no standing to inherit his
parents’ home or land in Pakistan since his life is in the United States, and his parents
intend  to pass it  on to his siblings  in  Pakistan.  He  stated  that his parents do not have
any further foreign assets or investments. (Tr. at 16-142; GE 1, 2)
Applicant’s three character witnesses attested to his loyalty to the United States,
trustworthiness,  and  integrity.  Two  witnesses,  who  have  been  friends  with  Applicant
since  approximately  2000,  described  Applicant  as  a  straightforward  and  honest
individual. The third witness, an individual who previously served honorably in the U.S.
military  for  over  11  years  and  helped  hire  Applicant  in  2018,  has  held  a  Top
Secret/Sensitive  Compartmented  Information  clearance  since  2006.  This  witness
testified that he and Applicant lived and worked closely together in Saudi Arabia for 8 to
10 months, during the 2.5 year-long project discussed above, and after 8 to 10 months,
the witness returned to the United States and entrusted Applicant as his lead engineer
to complete the project. This witness described Applicant as an outstanding employee
and consistently his top performer.
Letters of support from a number of individuals, to include a retired U.S. Air Force
lieutenant  colonel  who  was  an  executive  director  for  Applicant’s  employer  and  held  a
Top Secret security clearance, as well as another individual who  has been Applicant’s
supervisor  since  2018  and  also  a  retired  U.S.  military  officer  of  “over  21  years,”  and
three  other individuals who  have  had  20-year-long friendships  with  Applicant,  attest  to
his  integrity,  tireless  work  ethic,  leadership,  and  humility.  The  supervisor,  who  also
worked with Applicant on the overseas work project, wrote, I have no reason to question
his patriotism, loyalty,  character, or witnessed any personal conditions that would lead
me to suspect any questionable intent or risk.” (Answer; Tr. at 16-61; AE A).

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions
are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 56-year-old native of Yemen. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 1989
from a university in Yemen. He came to the United States in August 1983 under a cultural
exchange  scholarship and attended a U.S.  university.  (FORM Item 4 at 3.)  He  earned
three master’s degrees and a doctorate from a U.S. university in 2005.
Applicant  married  in 2000, divorced  in 2006, and  remarried  in 2014. He became  a
U.S. citizen  in 2011. His wife  is a  citizen  of  Yemen  and  a  permanent resident of  the  United
States. (FORM  Item  4, Subject  Interview  at  8.)  He has two  adult  children  from  his first
marriage   and   a   two-year-old  daughter   from   his  current  marriage,  who   is  a   native-born
U.S. citizen.  His two  adult children  were born  in  the  United  Arab  Emirates and  are  citizens
and  residents  of the  United  States.  He  was employed  by  a  state  university  with  federal
contracts  from  October  2011  to  November  2015.  He  was  employed  by  a  federal
contractor  as  a  senior  translator  November  2016  to  December  2018.  He  worked  for
federal contractors from March 2005 to September 2010 as an Arabic instructor. (FORM
Item 3 at 19-26.) He is currently a self-employed freelance translator.
Applicant applied for a security clearance in 2011, but his application was denied.
During his counterintelligence-focused screening interview, he told the interviewer that he
believed his application was denied because of money he sent to his brother and nephew
in Yemen. (FORM Item 4 at 10.)
Applicant’s mother and father are deceased. (FORM Item 3 at 32-33.) His older
brother,  one  half-sister,  two  stepmothers,  mother-in-law,  and  father-in-law  are  citizens
and  residents  of  Yemen.  Another  half-sister  is  a  citizen  and  resident  of  Djibouti.  His
younger brother is deceased. (FORM Item 3 at 35-36, 41-42; FORM Item 6.)
Applicant has regular contact with his older brother about twice a week. (FORM
Item 4, subject interview at 6.) He had occasional contact with his stepmother while his
father was alive, but virtually no contact since his father passed away in 2017. (FORM
Item  3  at  35.)  He  has  contact  with  his  other  stepmother  only  when  he  visits  Yemen.
(FORM Item 3 at 40.) He has weekly contact with his two half-sisters. (FORM Item 3 at
42-43.) He has telephonic contact with his father-in-law three or four times a year. (FORM
Item 3 at 45.) He has no contact with his mother-in-law, except through his wife. (FORM
Item 3 at 46.)
Applicant’s financial interests in Yemen, alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.e-1.j, are as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.e: partial ownership in four apartments worth about $50,000;
SOR ¶  1.f: 33% interest in four store spaces worth about $50,000, rented for about
$1,000 to $1,500 per month and managed by his brother;
SOR  ¶   1.g:  50%  interest  in  a  warehouse  and  surrounding  lot  worth  between
$100,000 and $150,000, which is rented for between $5,000 and $10,000 per year;
SOR ¶ 1.h: 33% interest in a vacant lot worth between $5,000 and $10,000;
SOR ¶ 1.i: ownership of a farm worth between $5,000 and $10,000;
SOR  ¶   1.j:  33%  interest  in  a  three-story  house  worth  between  $30,000  and
$35,000; and
SOR ¶  1.k: monthly rental income of about $1,000 to $1,500 from the properties
in SOR ¶¶ 1.e and 1.f, which are managed by his brother.
Applicant  and his brother inherited property in  SOR  ¶ 1.g from their father. The
property  was  sold  for  about  $800,000  and  the  proceeds  were  distributed  Applicant’s
father’s children, and Applicant received about $50,000.
Applicant has owned his home in the United States since June 2006. (FORM Item
3  at  15.)  During  his  counterintelligence-focused  screening  interview,  he  described  his
financial  status  as  “stable,”  and  told  the  interviewer  that  he  was  “doing  very  well.”  His
credit report reflected no derogatory information. (FORM Item 5 at 14.) He provided no
other information about his financial assets.
I have taken administrative notice that the United States has had a long on-and-
off  relationship  with  Yemen,  due  to  internal struggles  for power  in  Yemen.  The  United
States established diplomatic representation in North Yemen in 1959 and in South Yemen
in  1967.  Military leaders in  North  Yemen  overthrew the  monarchy and  established  the
Yemen  Arab  Republic,  which  the  United  States  recognized  in  1962.  The  Yemen  Arab
Republic severed relations with the United States in 1967 in the wake of the Arab-Israeli
conflict. Diplomatic relations with the Yemen Arab Republic were reestablished in 1972.
North  Yemen  and  South  Yemen  temporarily  reunified  in  1990,  and  the  United  States
established relations with the united country.
A  civil  war  broke  out  in  1994  over  reunification  issues.  After  reunification,  Ali
Abdullah Saleh, the former president of the Yemen Arab Republic, was elected president
of  the  unified  Yemen.  President  Saleh  stepped  down  in  early  2011,  and  Abdo  Rabo
Mansour Hadi was elected president for a two-year transition period in February 2012,
Yemen’s peaceful political transition ended in 2014, when the Houthis seized control of
the  government  and  forced  the  established  government  into  exile  The country remains
deeply divided, with pockets of ongoing violent conflict. The Houthis continue to control much
of the northwest, including Yemen’s capital city, Sana’a. Meanwhile, the legitimate Republic
of Yemen Government (ROYG) re-established a presence in southern Yemen, including the
port city of Aden. Amid rising tensions between the Houthis and ex-President Saleh, sporadic
clashes  erupted  in  mid-2017,  and  Houthi  forces  killed  Saleh  in  early  December  2017.
Beginning in June 2018, ROYG forces, supported by their coalition partners, have sought to
wrest control from Houthi forces occupying the port of Hudaydah on the Red Sea. Houthi
forces  have  launched  multiple  rocket  and  ballistic  missile  attacks  into  the  territory  of  the
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and toward Red Sea shipping lanes, further increasing tensions in
the region.
The ongoing conflict has exacerbated already high levels of need in Yemen, pushing
the country to a humanitarian crisis. The UN estimates that more than 24 million people,
or nearly 80 percent of the entire population, are in need of humanitarian assistance, more
than any other single country today. The U.S. government provided more than $630 million
in humanitarian assistance to Yemen in fiscal year 2020 and supports a small number of
health, education, and recovery assistance activities to help households and social service
delivery  systems  cope  with  the  effects  of  the  conflict  and  prepare  for  the  post-conflict
recovery.  However,  the  insecure  operating  environment  and  ongoing  bureaucratic
impediments continue to limit development programming.
Yemen  has  significant  human  rights  issues.  Impunity  of  security  officials  is  a
problem, in part because the government exercised limited authority and in part due to
lack  of  effective  mechanisms  to  investigate  and  prosecute  abuse  and  corruption.  The
United States suspended diplomatic operations in Yemen in February 2015, and the U.S.
Ambassador to Yemen maintains diplomatic engagement with Yemen from Riyadh, Saudi
Arabia. Yemen maintains an embassy in the United States. The U.S. State Department
has issued a Level 4 (Do not Travel) warning for Yemen, due to terrorism, civil unrest,
health risks, kidnapping, armed conflict, and landmines.
",False
"The SOR alleged that Applicant’s mother (SOR 1.a) and three sisters (SOR 1.b)
are  citizens  and  residents  of  Iraq.  The  SOR  also  alleged  that  three  of  Applicant’s four
brothers  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Iraq  serving  in  the  Kurdish  military  forces  there
(SOR 1.c); and that his fourth brother is a citizen and resident of Iraq working for Kurdish
security  forces  there  (SOR  1.d).  Lastly,  the  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  “maintain[s]
contact  with  several  Iraqi  citizens  on  a  continual  basis”  (SOR  1.e).  Applicant  admitted
without  explanation  all  of  the  SOR  allegations.  In  addition  to  the  facts  established  by
Applicant’s admissions, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 40 years old. He is one of seven children, all of whom were born and
raised in Iraq. Only one of his siblings is younger than him.  Applicant immigrated to the
United States in April 2012, and he became a naturalized U.S. citizen in November 2017.
He and his wife, a native-born U.S. citizen, have been married since June 2014. They
have two children under age 10, both of whom were born in the United States. (GX 1; Tr.
50 – 51)
Between  June  2007  and  January  2012,  Applicant  worked  in  Iraq  for  U.S.
contractors doing business in support of  U.S. military missions  there. Most of his work
involved translator and linguist duties in support of U.S.-led training of new Iraqi police
officers. None of his work required a security clearance and there is no indication in the
record that he was ever vetted for access to sensitive information. Between January and
April 2012, Applicant also worked as a paramedic in his native province in Iraq.  Before
the  U.S.  invasion  of  Iraq  in  2003,  Applicant  had  studied  for  three  years  to  become  a
mathematics teacher there. (GX 1; Tr. 7, 27 – 32)
In April 2018, the sponsor of his request for clearance extended to Applicant a job
offer for  work as  a  linguist  in  Iraq.  That  job offer is still pending and  contingent  on  his
eligibility for a security clearance. After arriving in the United States and holding a variety
of jobs, he obtained his commercial driver’s license (CDL) in March 2014 and found work
as a delivery driver sufficient to support his family while waiting for his clearance to be
adjudicated. (GX 1; Tr. 28, 52)
Applicant and his wife bought a house in the United States in February 2016. In
May 2021, Applicant sold the house and relocated with his family to his hometown in Iraq.
He relies on a cousin in the United States to forward his mail to him. Applicant deposited
the proceeds from  the sale  of  his home  in a U.S.  bank  because he  does  not  trust  the
banking system in Iraq. He has been living off those funds while he waits for his clearance.
Applicant’s  wife  now  works  in  Iraq  as  a  teacher,  and  he  is  seeking  non-governmental
employment in Iraq while he continues to wait for his clearance. He expressed a general
intent to return to the United States, but he has no immediate plans to do so. It may be
that Applicant’s wife and children will return to the United States; however, he expects to
stay and work in Iraq if he receives a clearance. (GX 1; Tr. 45, 55, 65)
Applicant,  his  wife,  and  their  children  lived  with  family  members when  they first
emigrated to Iraq in 2021. He is still in regular contact with his elderly mother and with his
sisters who live in the same region of Iraq as Applicant. His mother is elderly and Applicant
visits her when he can. In so doing, he also sees his sisters, who live in the same area
as his mother. (Tr. 33 – 35)
Three  of  Applicant’s  brothers  are  on  active  military  duty  in  a  provincial  militia
fighting  Islamic  State  and  other  insurgents.  The  fourth  brother  works  for  a  provincial
security and intelligence force supporting the same mission. Before Applicant returned to
Iraq, he had at least monthly contact with them. He still is in regular contact with them
except when their duties take them away from the area where Applicant and his family
now live. Applicant’s mother and sisters have never worked outside the home, and they
live in the same region as Applicant. Before he returned to Iraq, Applicant had at least
monthly contact with his mother and one sister, and weekly contact with his other sister.
He now talks with his mother and sisters at least weekly. After living with one of his sisters
when  he  returned to  Iraq,  Applicant  now visits  his mother whenever he  can.  Applicant
also has extended family, such as cousins, aunts and uncles, as well as some friends in
Iraq with whom he has kept in touch through social media. In-person contact with them is
rare. (GX 1; Tr. 38 – 44)
Before Applicant left Iraq in 2012, he worked closely with U.S. Army personnel at
a forward operating base (FOB) in Iraq. Most of his work supported U.S. military police
units involved in training Iraqi security forces. For his work with the U.S. military, he did
not receive a fully adjudicated security clearance; rather, he was briefed on an ad hoc
basis  by  unit  leaders  if  the  need  for  accessing  sensitive  information  arose.  Applicant
expressed  pride  in  the  work  he  has  done  for  the  U.S.  military  and  in  support  of  U.S.
interests in Iraq. His immediate family is aware that he worked for the U.S. military, and
some of them know that he now is awaiting employment with a U.S. company for work in
Iraq. (AX A; Tr. 29 – 32, 51 – 52)
To properly assess the security significance of these facts within the adjudicative
guideline at  issue, I have  taken administrative  notice of  certain facts  regarding  Iraq as
presented  in  HX  2.  Of  particular  note  is  the  continued  inability  of  its  freely  elected
government  to  quell  the  violence  and  instability  that  persist  in  parts  of  Iraq.  These
conditions  are  fueled  and  perpetrated  by  terrorist  groups  affiliated  with  Al-Qaeda  and
ISIS, as well as by Sunni insurgents and Iranian-backed Shiite militias. As a result, some
parts of Iraq remain wholly unstable. Even the city of Baghdad is still subject to random
acts of terrorist violence. (GX 4)
U.S. citizens and interests in Iraq remain at high risk for kidnapping and terrorist
violence. The U.S. State Department has advised against all individual travel to Iraq. The
ability of the U.S. Embassy to provide consular services to U.S. citizens outside Baghdad
and the southern city of Basra is extremely limited given the security environment. ISIS
again  controls  significant  portions  of  Iraq’s  territory,  and  numerous  other  terrorist  and
insurgent groups are active in Iraq. Such groups regularly attack both Iraqi security forces
and  civilians.  Anti-U.S.  sectarian  militias  may  also  threaten  U.S.  citizens  and  western
companies  throughout  Iraq.  U.S.  Government  and  western  interests  remain  possible
targets  for  attacks.  Additionally,  there  are  significant  human-rights  problems  in  Iraq.
Widespread corruption, as well as abuses by Iraqi security forces in response to acts of
violence by terrorists and others, have undermined confidence in the Iraqi government
and its judiciary. Human-rights violations by Iraqi law enforcement are not uncommon and
are not being addressed when identified. Those include killing, kidnapping, and extorting
civilians, as well as inhumane conditions in detention and prison facilities, arbitrary arrest
and lengthy pretrial detainment, denial of fair public trial, limits on freedom of expression,
freedom of  the press, censorship of  religion,  limits on peaceful assembly,  and societal
abuses of women. The various terrorist and militia organizations are also responsible for
significant human rights abuses in Iraq. (GX 4)
",False
"Applicant denied all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 44  years old. He was born in Hong  Kong  and  immigrated  to  the  United
States  in 1997. He became  a  naturalized  citizen  in 2003. He  never married  and  has  no
children. He earned  a  high  school equivalency  diploma  and  an  associate’s degree.  He
has worked  for his state’s prison  system  from  2006  to  2013  and  again from 2015  to  the
present. Applicant is a  prospective  government contract employee. (Transcript (Tr.)  17-
19; 69-72, 75; GE 1;  AE E, F)
Applicant served in the Army Reserve from 2005 to 2013. He deployed to Iraq from
2007  to  2008,  in  a  support  role.  He  was  on  active  duty  from  2013  to  2014.  Applicant
completed a security clearance application (SCA) in May 2018. Section 15 asked if in the
past seven years he had been subject to a court-martial or other disciplinary procedure
under  the  Uniform  Code  of  Military  Justice  (UCMJ)  such  as  an  Article  15.  Applicant
answered  “no.”  In  2013,  Applicant  received  a  UCMJ  Article  15  from  his  command  for
sexual harassment  and  violating the  fraternization  policy.  He  was  reduced  in  rank.  He
was discharged from the Army for unsatisfactory performance. He received an honorable
discharge. (Tr. 17-24, 28-32, 71, 97-103; GE 5; AE B, H)
Any derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will not be considered
for disqualifying purposes. It may be considered when making a credibility determination,
in the application of mitigating conditions, and in a whole-person analysis.
Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator in June 2018. During the
interview he disclosed Ms. M as a foreign contact. He had received an unsolicited email
from her in 2013, and he disclosed to the investigator that they were in a romantic online
relationship until 2014. They never met in person or had video chats. They exchanged
photographs. After a few months, she told him her father had been killed and her uncle
was trying to kill her to get an inheritance. She said she was hiding in a refugee camp
under  the  local  ministries  protection.  She  had  a  lawyer  who  was  helping  her  with  her
refugee  status,  but  needed  money  so  she  could  leave  the  country  (Togo).  Applicant
agreed to help her and took out two loans. He told the investigator that he sent her money
via MoneyGrams. He said that he never sent less than $300 or more than $5,000 in one
transaction. All of the money was sent to her lawyer in Togo. He sent money until he was
no  longer  able  to  do  so  and  told  her  she  would  have  to  find  another  way.  After  that,
Applicant did not hear from Ms. M for several months. When she did contact  him, she
said she had moved to Dubai, United Arab Emirates, with a man she did not want to be
with, and her online access was being restricted. Applicant said he had not had further
contact with her since that last email. (Tr. 105-120; GE 2
Applicant completed government interrogatories in November 2020. In them, he
stated that after checking his email, he confirmed his last contact with Ms. M was in March
2017. He said she was a refugee, but did not know her country of citizenship. He stated
that between 2015 and 2017, he provided her money to help her. During his hearing, he
stated  he  could  not  recall how many times he  sent  Ms.  M money.  He  said  the  largest
amount he sent her was a couple of hundred dollars, but also confirmed he took two loans
out for $3,000 and $1,500 and sent all of this money to her. He confirmed the approximate
total  he  sent  to  her  was  $7,000  and  when  he  could  not  afford  to  send  anymore,  she
ceased contact. He testified that he became a “little suspicious” after she moved to Dubai,
but he believed that she had been a target so she had to maintain a low profile so she
would not get killed. He initially stated that he expected to receive $500,000 from her as
a reward for helping, later he contradicted himself, saying he did not expect to receive the
reward from her. He testified this scenario made him more skeptical and aware that he
had to confirm information about someone who contacted him in the future. He no longer
believes her story. Applicant provided contradictory testimony and was not credible. (Tr.
31-38, 105-120; GE 2)
In early 2018, Applicant received another unsolicited email from a woman, Ms. H.
He describes her as his girlfriend. She sent him nude photos numerous times. He sent
her nude photos about six times. He also sent her videos of him nude and performing
sexual acts. He said he sent between 10 and 20 videos. She did not send him videos.
They have never met in person. Applicant was not concerned about sending this type of
content to her then or now. (Tr. 38-42, 121-128)
Ms. H told Applicant that she  needed  to  send  him  money  because  she  was having
difficulty   getting   her   inheritance. She   said   she   would  send   him  money  from her clients
and   asked   him   to   open   bank   accounts,   deposit  the   money,  and   then   he   should   send
money  orders to  two  people he  did  not know. When  asked  if  he  thought Ms. H was using
him  for money  laundering,  he  wavered  back and  forth  in his response. (Tr. 47-56, 129-
140)
Applicant testified that he used two accounts for her money. He was blocked by
MoneyGram and Western Union, so the money was sent through Bitcoin. He testified that
sometimes he deposited money from an unknown source. He sent her this money and
sometimes he sent his own money. He said he did numerous transactions. He estimated
he deposited and then transferred back to Ms. H about a total of $10,000 of her funds.
He sent her about $2,000 of his own money. At the time he completed his interrogatories
in November 2020, he was still sending her funds to cover her living expenses. He sent
this money by Bitcoin. When asked when was the last time he sent money to Ms. H, he
said he sent her $1,500 the preceding week, on January 5, 2022, days before his hearing.
His  last  contact  was  on  January  7,  2022.  This  money  was  in  addition  to  the  previous
$2,000 he sent to her. He said he sent her money to help her with immigration issues. He
was  not  initially  suspicious  of  her  activity  and  believed  her  requests  were  legitimate.
However, after his repeated requests to her to provide him with documents and her failure
to do so, he now believes her actions were not legitimate.  He said he has now cut off
communication with her, by deleting her account. (Tr. 39-40, 46-56, 129)
Applicant testified that when Ms. H first contacted him, she lived in a neighboring
state, but they did not visit each other because he did not have the time to take off from
work, or the money to travel, and his vehicle was unreliable. The money he sent went to
her lawyer, who is in Nigeria. When asked if he was aware that MoneyGram and Western
Union  likely  blocked  his  transactions  because  they  suspected  fraud,  he  said  he
understood, but he had the names of the people he was to send money to and believed
them to be legitimate at the time. He took precautions and requested Ms. H provide him
a copy of her passport, which she did, so he believed she was real. He also requested
they have a video chat. They had one, and he was able to verify the photo on the passport
was the same person in the video chat. He said Ms. H is now living in Nigeria and she
told Applicant that she acquired a new passport because her original one was confiscated
by the hotel where she was living. Applicant provided maps of the location of the hotel.
(Tr. 41-56, 144-148; GE 2)
Applicant  provided  a  copy  of  the  passport  Ms.  H  gave  him.  He  wanted  her  to
provide him a copy to prove she was who she claimed. A review of the passport clearly
shows it is fraudulent. The name at the top of the passport is different than the name at
the bottom. It also has two different passport numbers. Its expiration date does not reflect
the correct ten-year period. Most glaring is that the “United States of America” is spelled
wrong (State is used vice States). Applicant did not seem to understand that the scenarios
he participated in with Ms. M and Ms. H were scams.  He did not believe he had been
manipulated. He testified that in the future he will be more skeptical, and he no longer will
accept unsolicited emails. He did not believe he could be exploited in the future because
he  is  concerned  about  the  criminal  consequences.  (Tr.  56-57,  68-69,  148-153;  GE  2;
Answer to SOR)
In  February 2020, at the  request of  the  Government, Applicant participated in a
psychological evaluation. During the interview process, Applicant related the information
noted above about Ms. M and Ms. H to the licensed psychologist. The psychologist noted
that  when  she  asked  Applicant  whether  his  association  with  unknown  individuals  in
foreign countries who have asked for financial support could be problematic or a security
risk, he stated “no.” The psychologist opined: “He did not demonstrate any real insight or
recognition that these random contacts could compromise the safety and security of him
personally and also his work and more global security issues.” (GE 4, 6)
During  the  interview  with  the  psychologist,  Applicant  described  an  incident  where
he   inappropriately   obtained   derogatory   information   about   a   supervisor,  confronted   her
with  the  information,  and  shared  it with  a  colleague. He did not think any  of  his actions
were  questionable  or   that  his  judgment   and   decision-making   were  potentially   flawed.
When   asked   at  his  hearing   about  this  incident,   he   explained   that  he   learned   that  his
supervisor  had   been   charged   with   a   misdemeanor  as   a   juvenile.  He   retrieved   the
documents from  a  copy  machine,  viewed  them,  and  shared  them.  Applicant justified  his
conduct stating  that he  expected  his supervisor to  be  “clear  of  everything.”  (Tr. 161) He
said  he   did  it   because   he   has   high   expectations  and   standards  for  his  supervisor.  He
admitted  he  did not have  the  authority  to  view  the  documents or to  disclose  the  information
to  anyone, which he  did. He did  it because  he  wanted  to  know  what his supervisor had
done. He  had  concerns about  her being  selected  to  supervise the  team.  (Tr. 58-67, 154-
166; GE  4)
Applicant also told the psychologist that if Ms. H had a driver’s license he would
access his state’s database  for his personal  use  to  check  her status.  Through  his job,
Applicant has access to the state’s database for driver’s licenses, but he is not authorized
to use it for personal use. (Tr. 166-168; GE 4)
The psychologist noted that Applicant stated that he was likely taken advantage of
by Ms. M, but did check that the photo she sent him had not been altered so he could see
it was legitimate. This made him more skeptical when he was dealing with Ms. H. The
psychologist noted that Applicant did not see the similarities between the two incidents.
He  saw the  incident  with  Ms.  M as  an  isolated  occurrence and  the  one  with  Ms.  H as
different.  The  psychologist  is  concerned  “about  a  pattern  of  behavior  involving  poor
judgment and decision-making and equally if not more concerning is his apparent social
naiveté and lack of insight. His perceptions of reality appear rather skewed.” (GE 4)
Applicant  testified  he  does  not  believe  he  was  manipulated  or  that  he  could  be
exploited. He said he stopped his contact with Ms. M because he questioned her identity,
which is inconsistent with other testimony he provided. Regarding Ms. H he said that he
gathered  evidence  about  her  and  because  he  could  not  determine  her  location,  he
stopped all communication. It was during cross-examination that it was learned his last
contact was three days before his hearing. Applicant repeatedly contradicted himself and
his prior statements. In addition, he repeatedly minimized, justified, and rationalized his
conduct. I did not find his testimony credible. (Tr. 144-172)
Applicant’s mother is a  citizen  of  China  and  a  permanent resident  of  the  United
States. She immigrated in 1999 and is 73 years old. She worked in the United States and
is retired. He visits his mother about once or twice in a three-month period and talks to
her  every  other  week  by  phone.  She  has  not  applied  for  U.S.  citizenship  due  to  her
language skills. She maintains a Chinese passport and has contact with her relatives in
China. His mother returns to China about every two years to visit family. She stays with
Applicant’s brother while there or if her sisters are traveling to Hong Kong, they will stay
together.  They  visit  their  mother,  Applicant’s  grandmother.  Applicant’s  father  is  a
naturalized citizen of the United States.  Applicant’s  parents reside together in the U.S.
Both are aware that Applicant has applied for a security clearance. Tr. 24-29, 79-88; AE
A, C)
Applicant’s brother and sister-in-law are residents and citizens of China. They have
one  child.  His  brother  chose  to  remain  in  China  when  his  parents  and  Applicant
immigrated.  His  brother  is  a  technical  officer  for  the  Chinese  government.  He  is  an
engineer and does safely inspections on buildings. Applicant’s brother came to the U.S.
for a visit in 2003. Prior to then Applicant visited him in China in 2000 or 2001. Applicant
does  not  know  his  sister-in-law’s  occupation  or  where  she  works.  He  has  telephone
contact with his brother about every six months. Throughout Applicant’s testimony, I had
concerns and doubts about his veracity and candor. (Tr. 91-96)
Applicant  provided  a  certificate  of  recognition  for  his  ten  years  of  service  to  his
state and a copy of his resume. (AE C, D)

"Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  28  years  old.  He  earned  an  associate’s  degree  in  2015  and  a
bachelor’s  degree  in  2017.  Applicant  has  worked  for  his  current  employer,  a  federal
contractor, since August 2018. Prior to then he was self-employed full-time. The nature
of his business was to assist foreign students with the admissions process for attending
college in the United States. In his January 2019 security clearance application (SCA),
he disclosed nine foreign contacts, all Chinese nationals, for whom he provided services
in 2018. Since becoming employed full-time with his present employer, he indicated he
only works part-time in this business. (Items 4, 6)
Applicant married  a  Chinese  national in  2018. She  was on  an  F-1  student visa at
the  time  of  their  marriage. He is sponsoring  her for legal permanent resident status in the
U.S.  They   have   no   children.   No  information   was  provided   about  Applicant’s   wife’s
background,   contacts,   or  affiliations  with   government   entities   in  China.  No   information
was provided regarding her current employment, if any.
Applicant’s  wife’s  mother  is  a  resident  and  citizen  of  China.  No  background
information  or  details  were  provided  about  her.  No  information  was  provided  about
Applicant’s contacts  and  associations within China,  including  his and  his wife’s contact
with her mother, and any other family members. Applicant noted that he visited China in
December 2018 to January 2019, presumably with his wife and presumably to see her
mother. (Item 6)
Applicant used marijuana from about March 2017 to at least February 2020 with
varying  frequency.  During  his  May  2019  background  interview  with  a  government
investigator, he said he used marijuana on average about twice a week. In response to
May 2020 government interrogatories, he stated his last use was February 2020. He said
he  uses  marijuana  for  medicinal  purposes  for  migraines,  anxiety  and  tremors  due  to
Torrents syndrome. Medicinal marijuana is legal in the state where Applicant resides. He
has a valid medical marijuana card from the state. (Items 3, 6)
In  his  background  interview,  Applicant  stated  that  for  career  purposes  he  was
attempting to find an alternative to marijuana use. In his government interrogatories, he
responded that his employer has a drug use policy, but does not require him to undergo
random or periodic tests. He further indicated he understood that marijuana use remains
illegal under Federal law and any future use of marijuana may affect his security clearance
eligibility. In response to the question, do you intend to illegally use drugs or a controlled
substance in the future, he responded yes, he would use medical marijuana. (Items 3 6)

Applicant’s bank account and home are in the United States. (Tr. 37-38, 55; AE A
at 20) He has a limited right to property in Palestine because he and his siblings inherited
land and a home from his father. (Tr. 38-39)
Applicant has never been arrested, and he pays taxes to the U.S. Government.
(Tr. 62) He votes in U.S. elections. He describes himself as a reliable and responsible

trustworthy, reliable, professional, diligent, conscientious, loyal, intelligent, compliant with
rules, and honest.
West Bank, Palestine
There have been no national elections in the West Bank since 2006. Palestinian
Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas has remained in office despite expiration of his
term in 2009. The Palestinian Legislative Council has not functioned since 2007. As of
September 23, 2020, the U.S. Department of State Travel Advisory for the West Bank
was Level 3, because of COVID-19 restrictions, terrorism, and civil unrest. Terrorists may
attack with little or no warning  targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets,
shopping  malls,  and  local  government  facilities.  Multiple  terrorist  organizations  have  a
presence in the West Bank. These groups often express anti-U.S. sentiments. The PA
engages in numerous human rights violations. The PA has taken some steps to address
abuses and impunity.

Applicant  is  a  native-born  U.S.  citizen.  He  had  several  girlfriends  from  China
before he met his wife, who is also a Chinese citizen. He had two girlfriends from China
when he was in graduate school. He had a third girlfriend that he met during a visit to
China. He moved to China in 2009 to teach at a university and to be closer to his third
girlfriend. That relationship did not last. His future wife was one of his students. His wife
came  to  the  United  States  on  a  student  visa  in  2012.  He  moved  back  to  the  United
States  in  2013.  They  married  in  2017,  and  she  is  now  a  permanent  resident  of  the
United States (green card holder). Their children were born in the United States. (Tr. at
28, 34-43, 56, 66-88, 94-97; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE L, M)
Applicant’s wife’s mother suffered from some form of mental illness. His parents-
in-law divorced, and his mother-in-law passed away when his wife was young. His wife
was  primarily  raised  by  her  grandmother,  who  comes  from  a  rural  area  and  has  no
direct connection to the Chinese government or the Communist Party. Her grandmother
visited them in the United States in about 2017 and stayed through his wife’s pregnancy
and the birth of their child in 2018. She visited again for a few months in about 2019. His
wife’s aunt visited them in the United States twice for a few months each time. His wife’s
grandmother and aunt do not  speak  English,  and  Applicant does not  speak Mandarin,
so  their  only  real  communication  was  through  his  wife.  (Tr.  at  43-48,  99-105,  111;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2)
Applicant’s  wife  is  not  close  to  her  father.  She  blames  him  for  not  helping  her
mother more. Applicant has never met nor spoken to him. Applicant also mentioned that
he does not believe his father-in-law approved of the marriage. His father-in-law owns a
small  business  and  has  no  direct  connection  to  the  Chinese  government  or  the
Communist  Party.  Applicant  stated  that  his  father-in-law  did  not  have  to  pay  for  his
daughter’s education in the United States. Out of a sense of  obligation, his wife’s father
gifted  his  daughter  about  $87,000  to  be  used  as  a  down  payment  on  the  purchase  of
Applicant’s  and  his  wife’s  home,  which  they  bought  for  about  $540,000.  (Tr.  at  47-51,
106-109; GE 1, 2)
Applicant’s  and  his  wife’s  second  child  was  born  in  2020.  They  had  no  visitors
from China for the birth because of the pandemic. Future visitors are less likely because
China  has  made  it  more  difficult  for  their  citizens  to  travel  overseas.  (Tr.  at  52;
Applicant’s response to SOR; AE J, K)
Applicant has not been to China since he left in 2013. His wife went to China in
about  2017  to  travel  with  her  grandmother  to  the  United  States.  Her  last  trip  to  China
was  in  2019  to  update  her  national  identification  card.  China  would  not  renew  the
document  at  their  consulates,  and  required  their  citizens  to  return  to  China  to  do  so.
Applicant and his wife have decided that unless the political situation changes in China,
she will not return. She has applied for U.S. citizenship. (Tr. at 53-54, 57; AE L, M)
The  PRC  is a  large  and  economically  powerful country, with  a  population  of over
1.4   billion   people.   The   PRC   has   an   authoritarian   government,  dominated   by   the
Chinese   Communist  Party.  The   PRC   has   a   poor  record   with   respect  to   human   rights
and suppresses political dissent.  Its practices  include  official repression  of  the  freedoms
of  speech, religion, movement, association, and  assembly; forced  confessions; torture;
mistreatment of prisoners; and  arbitrary arrest, detention, and killings.
The PRC engages in espionage against the United States and is one of the two
most  active  collectors  of  U.S.  economic  intelligence  and  technology.  The  PRC  also
sometimes  uses  coercion  or  blackmail  to  manipulate  its  citizens  overseas  to  conduct
influence operations on behalf of the PRC, such as threatening ethnic Uyghurs living in
the United States with imprisonment of their family members in China. Additionally, the
PRC  targets  individuals  in  other  countries  to  support  its  acquisition  of  foreign
technology.  The  PRC’s  “Thousand  Talents  Program”  seeks  to  recruit  individuals
primarily, but not exclusively, from relevant diaspora populations and recent emigrants
from the PRC, as well as foreign national experts whose recruitment the PRC views as
necessary to its scientific and technical modernization, especially with regard to defense
technology.
Applicant does not disagree with the nature of the PRC’s government. He agrees
that  China  is  a  hostile  power  and  a  dangerous  country  that  is  becoming  more
dangerous.  His  position  is  that  the  Government’s  theory  of  coercion  does  not  make
sense;  that  force  of  threats  against  loved  ones  is  too  risky  for  a  rational  adversary  to
consider;  and  that  “secrecy  creates  a  shield  against  coercion.”  He  did  an  expansive
research of reported spying and espionage cases and found that coercion against loved
ones is extremely rare. A  study concluded  that “[p]eople coerced  into  espionage rarely
make ideal agents.” (Tr. at 13-15, 26-27, 121-138; AE A-K)
Applicant  also   asserted   that   in   the   extremely   unlikely   event  that  the   PRC
attempts  to   use   his  wife   or  his  wife’s  family  to   coerce  him   into   revealing   classified
information, he   will immediately   report it  to   the   FBI.  His  wife   agrees  that  would  be   the
only way to protect their  children’s future,  and  it  is  also  the  best chance to resolve the
situation without any harm to their family or national security. (Tr. at 111-112)
Applicant  submitted  letters  and  documents  attesting  to  his  excellent  job

China  (PRC)
The PRC is an authoritarian state in which the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)
is the paramount authority. China is the world’s most active and persistent perpetrator of
economic espionage. China presents a persistent cyber-espionage threat to the United
States. China is the most aggressive country conducting espionage against the United
States,   and   U.S   corporations.  China  has  expansive   programs  in  place   to   acquire   U.S.
technology, including  sensitive  trade  secrets  and  proprietary  information  to  enhance  its
global  strategic,  military,  diplomatic,  and   economic  influence.   China’s  focus  is  on
obtaining  U.S.  information  and  technologies beneficial to  China’s military  modernization
and  economic development.  China’s intelligence  services,  as well  as private  companies
and   entities,  frequently   seek  to   exploit  Chinese   citizens  or  persons  with   family   ties  to
China  who  can  use  their  insider information  to  access intellectual property  and  sensitive
trade  secrets.  About  80  percent of  all  economic espionage  prosecutions brought  by  the
U.S.  Department  of   Justice   allege   conduct  that  would  benefit  China   and   at  least  60
percent  of   all   trade   secret   theft  cases  have   at  least  some   nexus  to   China.  Recent
criminal  cases  that  were   prosecuted   and   involve   actual  or  attempted   espionage   and
illegal export of  sensitive  military  technology  to  China. In  addition, China  has significant
human   rights  problems,  including   the   repression   of   freedom   of   speech,  religion,  and
association.  (AN I)
Hong Kong
In  1997,  after  centuries  in  the  British  Empire,  Hong  Kong  became  the  Hong
Kong  Special  Administrative  Region  of  the  PRC.  Under  the  PRC’s  “one  country,  two
systems”  formula,  Hong  Kong  was  to  enjoy  a  “high  degree  of  autonomy  in  all  maters
except foreign and defense affairs for the next 50 years. The people of have traditionally
enjoyed  substantial  civil  liberties  and  the  rule  of  law  under  their  local  constitution.
However,  those  freedoms  have  come  under  threat  in  recent  years  as  the  Chinese
government  has  exerted  increased  control  over  the  government  and  people  of  Hong
Kong.  (AN II)
In June 2020, the Chinese government announced a sweeping national security
law  that  brought  Hong  Kong’s  7.5  million  residents  under  the  direct  authority  of  the
CCP.  Since  the  law’s  imposition,  the  PRC  has  unilaterally  and  arbitrarily  exercised
police  and  security  power  in  Hong  Kong.  The  PRC  has  demonstrated  an  intention  to
use  this  authority  to  target  a  broad  range  of  activities  it  defines  as  acts  of  secession,
subversion,  terrorism,  and  collusion  with  foreign  entities,  including  participation  in
demonstrations.  The  National  Security  Law  also  covers  offenses  committed  by  non-
Hong Kong residents or organizations outside of Hong Kong, which could subject U.S.
citizens  who  have  been  publicly  critical  of  the  PRC  to  a  heightened  risk  of  arrest,
detention,  expulsion,  or  prosecution.  (See  U.S.  State  Department  Travel  Advisory  for
China:  https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories/china-
travel-advisory.html (updated January 19, 2022))
Taiwan
Taiwan  is  a  democracy  with  a  democratically  elected  president  and  parliament.
The  PRC  is  a  large  economic  trading  partner.  Since  1979,  the  United  States  has
recognized  the  government  of  the  PRC  as  the  sole  legal  government  of  China,  and
acknowledges  the  PRC’s  position  that  there  is  one  China  and  that  Taiwan  is  part  of
China.  The  U.S.  maintains  robust  cultural,  commercial,  and  other  unofficial  relations
with Taiwan, but the U.S. does not support Taiwanese independence.
In  recent  years,  the  PRC  has  adopted  a  more  coercive  policy  towards  Taiwan,
seeking  to  isolate  and  intimidate  Taiwan  into  unification  with  the  PRC  on  their  terms.
The  PRC  has  sharply  escalated  its  military,  diplomatic,  and  economic  pressure  on
Taiwan. The United States has noted this shift with concern, and has urged the PRC to
engage in meaningful dialogue with Taiwan’s democratically elected representatives. In
recent  years, there have  been multiple  cases  involving the  illegal export,  or attempted
legal  export,  of  U.S.  restricted,  dual  use,  or  military  technology  to  Taiwan,  or  by
Taiwanese companies or nationals. (AN III)
",False
"Applicant  is 27  years old.  He  has  been  employed  by a  defense  contractor as a
technical support engineer since May 2020. He was married in Pakistan in January 2017,
and provided financial support for his spouse until she could relocate to the U.S. He has
no children. He earned a bachelor’s degree in May 2017. He has never held a security
clearance.
The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant’s  spouse  is  a  Pakistani  citizen  residing  in  the
United States, and his grandmother and in-laws are citizens and residents of Pakistan.
Applicant admitted the SOR allegations with explanations.
Applicant was born in  Pakistan  and  his parents,  who  are naturalized  U.S. citizens,
brought him  to  the U.S. in 2012, just before his 18th  birthday. He automatically  became  a
U.S. citizen  by law  since he resided with his parents.  He is also  a citizen of Pakistan.
In 2016, Applicant applied for and obtained a Pakistani National Identity Card for
Overseas  Pakistanis  (NICOP).  He  used  his Pakistani  passport  to  travel  to  Pakistan  in
2009 and 2015 to visit family, and to apply for a marriage certificate in Pakistan. He used
his U.S. passport and his NICOP card to travel to Pakistan in 2017 to marry, and in 2018
and  2019.  When  traveling  to  Pakistan,  he  visited  with  his  grandmother  and  since
marrying,  his  in-laws.  In  2019,  he  also  traveled  to  Turkey  and  to  Saudi  Arabia  for  a
religious pilgrimage with his parents, sister, and spouse.
Applicant’s  spouse  became  a  naturalized  U.S. citizen  on  March 1,  2022  and  they
reside  together in the  U.S.  It  is unclear how  he  met his spouse. His grandmother is an
unemployed  citizen  and  resident of  Lahore, Pakistan. Applicant visited  with  her when  he
traveled  to  Pakistan. He  noted  in his answer to  the  SOR, that his contact with  her is “very
casual  and   limited   to   greetings,  asking   how  she   is  doing,  and   in  return  she   does  the
same.” She   is unfamiliar with  his job  and   has not asked   about his  employment.   His in-
laws are also  citizens and  residents  of Lahore, Pakistan.  He interacts with  his father-in-
law   quarterly,  or  about   three   to   four  times  per  year.  He  listed   his  interactions  with   his
grandmother and  mother-in-law  in his SCA as monthly. He claims his grandmother and
in-laws have  not inquired about  his employment,  and he  is unaware of their  employment
history,  including  contacts,  service,  or  previous  employment  with  the  Pakistani
government.  His  father-in-law  is  currently  self-employed  in  the  clothing  wholesale
business.
Applicant did not provide documentary evidence of his financial status, community
involvement, employment performance, or personal and professional character, nor was
I able to make relevant inquiries that I would have made in a hearing environment.
",False
"Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  his  SCA  unless  otherwise
indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings, Applicant’s testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 23 years old and was born in the United States. He has never married
and has no children. His parents were born in Egypt, immigrated to the United States,
and became naturalized U.S. citizens. Both of his parents have earned doctorate degrees
in the United States. Applicant is a dual U.S.-Egyptian citizen due to his parents’ Egyptian
citizenships. Applicant attended college in the United States and earned his bachelor’s
degree in August 2020. Since then, he has worked for a U.S. defense contractor as an
engineer.  His  employer  is  sponsoring  him  for  a  security  clearance.  He  is  a  first-time
clearance  applicant.  In  March  2020,  Applicant  and  two  classmates  co-founded  a
technology business (Business). He works on his start-up venture part time as the “Team
Lead.”  (Tr. at 22, 24-29.)
Applicant has several aunts, uncles, and cousins who are citizens and residents
of Egypt. He is closest to one cousin (Cousin) who is 24 years old, has an undergraduate
degree in computer science, and is a software engineer. In about September 2020, the
Cousin began assisting the Business by developing a software application for use with
certain types of cellphones. Applicant regards his Cousin as a friend as well as a relative.
They text frequently about the Cousin’s work on the application and other matters. They
talk on the phone weekly. Applicant last visited Egypt in September and October 2021
with his family. He met with his Cousin during that trip. (Tr. at 30-36, 42, 51.)
SOR Allegation  and Applicant’s  Answer
Paragraph 1, Guideline B - The SOR sets forth a single allegation regarding the
potential for foreign influence resulting from Applicant’s relationship with his Cousin, who
is  a  citizen  and  resident  of  Egypt.  More  specifically,  the  CAF  alleged  that  Applicant  is
“involved  in  a  business  venture  with  [his]  cousin,  who  .  .  .  is  currently  serving  in  the
Egyptian  military.”  In  his  Answer,  Applicant  admitted  that  his  Cousin  is  a  citizen  and
resident of Egypt. He represented that as of the date of the SOR, his Cousin had finished
his mandatory one year of service in the Egyptian army. Accordingly, Applicant denied
this part of the SOR allegation. He explained further that the Cousin’s military service is
followed  by  a  mandatory  nine-year  period  in  the  army  reserves.  Applicant  further
explained the role the Cousin has in the Business. The Business is owned by Applicant
and two of his university classmates. Applicant specifically denied in the Answer that his
cousin has ever been an owner of the Business or that he ever had any financial ties to
the Business. (SOR at 1; Answer at 1.)
In the summary of his December 2020 background interview, the investigator wrote
that Applicant:
claimed  that he  has partnered  with  his cousin . . .,  a  citizen  of  Egypt,  as a
self-employed start up  business in  03/2020. This business was founded by
[Applicant]  and this cousin.  (GE 2 at 15-16)
In  his  June  2021  responses  to  DOHA’s  Interrogatories,  Applicant  affirmed  that  the
investigator’s report accurately reflected the information he provided during the interview
without  any  changes.  In  response  to  a  different  interrogatory,  Applicant  wrote  that  the
Cousin was “in charge of app development,” that the Cousin “was not an initial member
when  the  business  was  founded,”  and  that  the  cousin  “joined  the Team  a few months
later in 2020.” He also wrote that the Cousin “is not currently an owner in the business.”
He further noted that “we do not conduct business outside of the U.S.” (GE 2 at 4-5.)
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  clarified  the  role  of  his  Cousin  in  the  Business  and
discussed  certain  misunderstandings  due  to  his  prior  choice  of  words.  He  wanted  to
describe the Cousin’s role more accurately. He credibly testified that his Cousin was  not
a partner in the Business and that his role was better described as an unpaid intern or
helper. The quote above from his background interview in which he is reported as using
the word “partnered” is a misinterpretation of what he told the investigator. Applicant and
his two partners considered the Cousin to be part of the “Team” because he was helping
them, but he was not a “founder” or partner. (Tr. at 22, 32-40, 46-61.)
Applicant also testified about the origins of the Business. It began as a class project
in  2017,  when  Applicant  was  in  college.  He  and  his  two  classmates  submitted  their
classwork in a competition sponsored by a foundation. Their project won the competition
and  $5,000  of  prize  money.  They formally  organized  a  legal  entity for  the  Business  in
March 2020. Applicant and the two classmates are the sole owners of the entity. At the
early stages of the Business, Applicant and his co-founders discussed the possibility of
having the Cousin become a part of the Business, but they decided against that because
it was not practical and was not important to the Cousin. (Tr. at 22, 32-40, 46-61; AE B at
2, 4.)
The  Cousin,  however,  became  involved  in  the  Business  to  a  limited  extent  in
September 2020. At that time, he was serving on active duty in the Egyptian army. His
involvement in the Business was to develop part of the software required for the Business.
The Cousin was happy to help the Business so that he could gain experience and build
his  resume  as  a  recent  college  graduate.  He  was  discharged  from  active  duty  in  the
Egyptian  army  in  June  2021.  He  now  works  full  time  in  the  Egyptian  office  of  an
international business as a software developer. He is also pursuing his studies to earn a
master’s degree. (Tr. at 22, 32-35, 38, 40; AE A at 4.)
The  Cousin’s contributions to  the  Business  on  the  software application  has been
his only  work for the  Business. Applicant has  no  plans  for his Cousin to  provide  any  future
services  on  new  projects for the  Business. The  Cousin  was not paid for this work, and  he
has no  expectation  of receiving  any  compensation  in  the  future. The  Cousin never asked
for anything  in return for the  help he  provided. The  Business applied  for a  patent  on  the
Business’s  product,   and   the   Cousin  was   not  listed   as  a   co-inventor.   If  the   Business
needed   software  expertise   and   the   Cousin   was  not  available  to   help  the   Business,
Applicant and  his partners could  write  the  software themselves or hire  someone  to  do  it.
(Tr. at  36-40, 50, 56, 59.)
Administrative Notice
Based  upon  the  official  U.S.  government  documents  attached  to  Department
Counsel’s Request for Administrative Notice, I take administrative notice of the following
facts regarding the country conditions in Egypt:
Although the United States and Egypt have certain strategic ties, Egypt and agents
acting on behalf of Egypt have engaged in efforts to illegally purchase sophisticated U.S.
weaponry and to conduct espionage. Terrorist organizations operate in Egypt and attack
both  Egyptian  governmental  assets  and  western  assets,  including  those  of  the  United
States.  In  2020,  terrorist  groups  claimed  responsibility  for  killing  hundreds  of  civilians
throughout  the  country.  There  are  significant  human  rights  issues  in  Egypt,  including
unlawful  killings,  extrajudicial  killings  by  the  government  or  its  agents,  forced
disappearances, torture, life-threatening conditions in prisons, and serious restrictions on
free expression, the press, and the Internet.
",True
"The  amended  SOR  alleges  under  Guideline  B  that  Applicant’s  father  and
stepmother (SOR ¶ 1.a), two stepbrothers (SOR ¶ 1.b), and a cousin (SOR ¶ 1.d) are
resident citizens of Pakistan; that Applicant’s father transferred  property to him  in  2016
(SOR ¶ 1.e); that Applicant has two bank accounts in Pakistan with about $16,000 on
deposit (all values in US dollars unless specified as rupees) (SOR ¶ 1.f); that Applicant’s
spouse owns two properties in Pakistan valued at approximately $160,000 (SOR ¶ 1.g);
that  Applicant’s  spouse  has  a  bank  account  in  Pakistan  with  about  $2,000  on  deposit
(SOR ¶ 1.h); and that Applicant possesses an overseas Pakistan identification (ID) card
to conduct monetary transactions in Pakistan (SOR ¶  1.i).
When Applicant responded to the SOR, he explained that his father died in 2018.
He  admitted  that his stepmother,  two  stepbrothers, and  cousin  are resident citizens  of
Pakistan,  but  he  denied  any  current  contact  with  his  stepmother  or  stepbrothers.  He
stated that he has infrequent interactions with his cousin “as she takes care of  a house
that [he] inherited from [his] father.” Applicant admitted the allegations concerning his and
his  spouse’s  financial  and  property  interests  in  Pakistan.  He  also  admitted  that  he
possesses  an  Overseas  Pakistan  ID  card  because  it  is  required  to  conduct  monetary
transactions in Pakistan. He asked that he be allowed to retain the security clearance he
has held for almost 15 years.
After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant  is  67  years  old.  He  was  born  and  raised  in  Pakistan  as  were  his  two
sisters.  Applicant’s  parents  were  born  in  what  was  then  India,  but  became  resident
citizens of Pakistan after the country gained its independence. His mother died in March
1972. (GE 1.) His father was a high-ranking member of Pakistan’s military (the equivalent
of a three-star general) before a military coup in 1977, when the new president brought
him into Pakistan’s civilian government. He represented a branch of Pakistan’s military in
a  civilian  capacity  and  served  as  a  cabinet  minister  for  a  succession  of  different
departments  in  Pakistan’s  government  before  leaving  government  service  in  1984  or
1985. (Tr. 45-48, 60.)
Applicant  graduated  from  high  school  in  Pakistan  in  1972.  From  1972  to  1973,
Applicant studied on a scholarship at a technical university in the Middle East. (AE B.) In
June  1974,  he  enlisted  in  Pakistan’s  military  so  that  he  could  attend  an  aeronautical
engineering  college  funded  in  part  by  the  U.S.  military  in  Pakistan.  (GE  1;  Tr.  44.)
Applicant’s instructor for three electrical engineering courses was a captain in the United
States  Air  Force.  He  provided  a  positive  reference  for  Applicant  in  November  1977,
attesting that Applicant was a top student, able to think clearly and independently, and
motivated to excel in the classroom and in his research activities. He opined that Applicant
would be very successful in graduate school. (AE A.)
After  Applicant  earned  his  bachelor’s  degree  in  January  1977,  he  continued
serving as an officer in Pakistan’s military until March 1980. He had become disillusioned
after  new  military  leadership  downplayed  the  importance  of  engineering  within  the
military, and two years after obtaining a transfer out of maintenance engineering, he was
discharged from his military obligation. (GE 1; Tr. 43-45.)
In August 1980, Applicant came to the United States on a student visa to pursue
his master’s degree. (GE 1; Tr. 43.)  While he was in college in the United States, his
father married a Pakistani resident citizen with three sons. (GE 1; Tr. 34.) Applicant did
not  develop  much  of  a  personal  relationship  with  his  stepmother  or  stepbrothers.  He
visited with them “once in a while” when he was in Pakistan. (Tr. 34.)
In September 1981, Applicant earned his master’s degree from a public university
in the United States. (GE 1; Tr. 50.) Early in September 1981, he married a resident citizen
of Pakistan in Pakistan. Applicant and his spouse decided to make their home and raise
a family in the United States. Their three children, a son age 37 and daughters ages 35
and  26,  are  U.S.  resident  citizens  from  birth.  Applicant  became  a  U.S.  citizen  by
naturalization in August 1992. His acquisition of U.S. citizenship served to automatically
revoke his citizenship with Pakistan. Applicant’s spouse has U.S. citizenship. The date of
her naturalization is not in evidence. In July 1996, Applicant and his spouse purchased
their current residence in the United States. (GE 1.)
Applicant  obtained  his  first  U.S.  passport  in  November  1992.  He  traveled  to
Pakistan on his U.S. passport, annually or every other year, to visit his father before his
father’s death in 2018. (GE 1; Tr. 34.) During some of his trips to Pakistan, he visited his
parents-in-law before  their deaths,  and  some extended family members (uncles  and a
cousin) who lived in the same city as his in-laws. (Tr. 51.)
Since  1985,  Applicant  has  operated  his  own  business  as  a  self-employed
consultant  in  the  United  States.  During  his  early  career,  he  was  involved  in  industrial
product  development  that  was  not  defense-related.  In  June  2004,  Applicant  became
involved  in  DOD-applied  research  as  a  consultant  to  a  federally-funded  development
laboratory. He was granted a secret clearance for his duties in July 2005. In August 2012,
Applicant  ended  his consultancy because  the  laboratory wanted  him  to  become a full-
time employee rather than pay him as a business. (GE1.)
In  August  2012,  Applicant  began  working  as  a  contractor  for  another  federally-
funded laboratory. On August 31, 2015, Applicant completed and certified as accurate a
Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  to  renew  his  clearance  eligibility.  He
disclosed that, as a U.S. citizen, he holds an identification card issued by the Pakistan
government  to  “people  of  Pakistani  origin  living  in  the  US,”  so  that  he  can  conduct
monetary transactions in Pakistan. He indicated that he had in-person contact with his
father  in  Pakistan  to  as  recently  as  May  2014.  Applicant’s  siblings  had  acquired  U.S.
citizenship and were living in the United States as of August 2015, while his stepmother
and two of his three stepbrothers were resident citizens of Pakistan. Applicant indicated
that he had monthly contact by telephone or electronic means with his stepmother. He
had in-person contact with one stepbrother when he was in Pakistan  to as recently as
April 2012. He had annual contact with the other stepbrother in Pakistan to as recently as
August  2014.  His  third stepbrother had acquired  U.S.  citizenship and  was  living in  the
United States as of August 2015. (GE 1.)
In  response  to  an  SF  86  inquiry  concerning  whether  he  or  his  spouse  had  any
foreign financial interests, Applicant reported that he had received his share of agricultural
land inherited from his mother. The land was worth about $200,000 when it was sold. He
disclosed that he had deposited $15,000 in a bank account in Pakistan from the sale of
land, and there was $7,000 in the account as of August 2015. He reported on his SF 86
that his spouse had $2,000 in a bank account in Pakistan from the sale of land. She sold
a plot of land in Pakistan worth about $20,000 in March 2010 and used the proceeds to
purchase two plots of land in Pakistan for $60,000 in May 2010. The value of those plots
had  appreciated  to  $100,000.  Applicant  listed  among  his  foreign  travels  six  trips  to
Pakistan between April 2008 and September 2014 to visit family or friends. (GE 1.)
Regarding  the  sale  of  the  agricultural  land  that  Applicant  and  his  sisters  co-
inherited from their mother, his sisters gave him power of attorney to sell the land. He
sold the land around May 2011 and deposited $130,000 to $140,000 from the sale into
his bank account in Pakistan. After transferring his sisters’ shares to them, he transferred
about  $80,000  of  his  share  to  his  bank  account  in  the  United  States  to  pay  college
expenses for his son and older daughter and private high school expenses for his younger
daughter. (Tr. 35.) He kept about $15,000 in his U.S. dollar account in the Pakistani bank.
(Tr. 52-53.)
Applicant’s father transferred ownership of one of his three properties in Pakistan
to Applicant in 2016. (Answer.) His father deposited $10,000 to $15,000 into Applicant’s
bank account in Pakistan to pay for renovations to the property. (Tr. 53.) Applicant rents
out  two  units,  and  his  cousin  in  Pakistan,  who  is  in  her  70s  and  “real  estate  savvy,”
handles the issues involving the property for him. He needs someone in Pakistan to sign
contracts  on  his  behalf,  and  she  lives  in  the  same  sector  as  the  property,  so  it  is
convenient  for  her  to  oversee  the  property.  Applicant’s  cousin  is  not  affiliated  with
Pakistan’s government. (Tr. 36-40.) Applicant indicated in response to the SOR that his
interactions  with  his  cousin  were  “infrequent.”  (Answer.)  He  testified  that  he  currently
contacts  his  cousin  only  when  repairs  are  needed  to  the  property  or  when  tenancy
changes. (Tr. 55.) Applicant contacted his cousin in mid-to-late November 2021 regarding
repairs being made to the premises. (Tr. 56.)
In the fall of 2021, Applicant  listed his property in Pakistan for sale at an asking
price of over $2 million. He is willing to accept its current market value of $2 million. (Tr.
55.) He believes it will take some time to sell, given it “is a pricey land” in an older sector
of the city. (Tr. 40.) He has three real estate agents trying to sell the property. (AE L.) Due
to the current exchange rate of rupees to dollars, continuing to rent it out does not make
economic sense, and he has little reason to keep the property, given his immediate family
and  siblings  live  in  the  United  States.  (Tr.  40-41.)  Two  of  Applicant’s  children  are
physicians while the third works as an architect. (Tr. 50.)
Applicant  continues  to   maintain  two   bank  accounts  in  Pakistan:   an   account  in
dollars and an account in Pakistan rupees. Under Pakistan’s laws, rent is required  to  be
paid in rupees, even  by  non-Pakistani tenants.  For a  short time, his cousin was a  signatory
on  the  rupee  account while  he  was having  the  premises renovated. He  took  her off  his
rupee   account  in   Pakistan   because   she   had   to   disclose   the   assets  on   her  income   tax
returns,  and  it affected  her tax  rate.  (Tr. 54.)  Applicant  is currently  the  only  signatory  to
his bank accounts in Pakistan. He  maintains the  dollars account for the  ease of currency
transfers out of  Pakistan. (Tr. 36.)  The  balance  of  that account is currently  around  $3,000.
(Tr. 53.) He  has  about  600,000  rupees  (almost $3,400) in  the  rupees account.  (Tr. 53-
54.) Applicant retains  his ID card issued  by  Pakistan’s  government  to  its former  citizens
so that he can  conduct currency transactions in Pakistan. It is not a travel card. (GE 1.)
Applicant’s spouse still owns two plots of land in Pakistan. Their aggregate value
has  appreciated  to  approximately $250,000  to  $300,000.  His  spouse  does  not  have  a
present intention to divest herself of those assets. She continues to have a bank account
in Pakistan, but the account has largely been inactive so the amount on deposit has not
changed significantly from 2015. (Tr. 57-58.)
Applicant  denies  that  he  could  be  pressured  because  of  his  and  his  spouse’s
financial assets in Pakistan, which he considers as “not important to their overall financial
situation.” Applicant and  his spouse’s home in the  United States is valued  around $1.5
million, and their equity in the house is about $1 million. Applicant has $100,000 in an
individual retirement account in the United States. (Tr. 41.)
Applicant traveled to Pakistan in 2018 on the death of his father. He returned to
Pakistan  in  early  2019,  to  settle  matters  related  to  his  father’s  estate.  (Tr.  34,  52.)  He
asserts that his settlement of his father’s estate was acrimonious and left no chance of
him having any interactions with his stepmother or stepbrothers in the future. (Answer.)
Applicant sees little reason for him to travel to Pakistan in the future. (Tr. 35.)
Applicant  wants  to  continue  to  contribute  to  the  U.S.  interests.  He  is  currently
contributing to three projects for three different defense organizations. (AE L.)

issues,
Pakistan is a federal parliamentary republic. Prime Minister Imran Khan assumed
office in 2018 after the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) party took a plurality of seats in
the  July  2018  general  elections.  The  United  States  has  had  diplomatic  relations  with
Pakistan since the country’s independence in 1947. The United States and Pakistan work
to  stabilize  Afghanistan,
closely  on  a  wide  array  of
counterterrorism, energy,  trade, and  investment.  Pakistan has been  designated by the
United  States  as  a  major  non-NATO  ally.  (AE  C.)  The  United  States,  Pakistani,  and
German  navies  conducted  a  tri-lateral  passing  exercise  on  September  6,  2021,  to
strengthen cooperation and advance a common vision to ensure peace and stability. On
September  7,  2021,  the  United  States  and  Pakistan  engaged  in  bilateral  training  to
continue  the  substantive  collaboration  between  the  two  countries.  (AE  D.)  The  United
States has been one of the largest sources of foreign direct investment in Pakistan, and
remains  Pakistan’s largest export market.  Over the past few years, Pakistan has been
strengthening its trade and investment ties with other European countries, including the
including  efforts
United  Kingdom.  (AEs  F-G.) Net  foreign  direct investment  in  Pakistan  jumped  to  an  11-
month  high at $236  million in September 2021. (AE  E.)
Pakistan has been engaged in a decades-long armed conflict with militant groups
that target government institutions and civilians, including the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan
(TTP) and other militant networks. Pakistan has taken actions against externally-focused
militant groups and United Nations-designated terrorist organizations operating within its
territory in accord with the country’s National Action Plan against terrorism. However, due
to  Pakistan’s  failure  to  take  decisive  and  irreversible  action  against  these  groups,  the
United States suspended security assistance to Pakistan in January 2018, with narrow
exceptions  in  U.S.  national  security  interests.  In  January  2019,  the  U.S.  Director  of
National Intelligence told a Senate panel that Pakistan is recalcitrant to deal with militant
groups.  It  remains  a  safe  haven  for  numerous  Islamist  extremist  and  terrorist  groups.
Although the Pakistani government voiced support for political reconciliation between the
Afghan  government  and  the  Afghan Taliban,  it  did  not  restrict  the  Afghan  Taliban  and
Haqqani Network from operating in Pakistan and Afghanistan using Pakistan-based safe
havens.
Pakistan’s security environment has improved since 2014. Yet Pakistan remains
at  high  risk  for  terrorism.  Militants  and  terrorist  groups,  including  the  TTP,  Lashkar-e-
Jhangvi,  and  the  Islamic  State  Khorasan  Province  targeted  civilians,  journalists,
community leaders, security forces, law enforcement  officers, and schools, killing and
injuring hundreds with  bombs, suicide attacks, and other forms of violence in 2020. On
November 15, 2021, the U.S. State Department issued a Level 3 – Reconsider Travel to
Pakistan  due  to  terrorism  and  sectarian  violence.  Terrorist  groups  continue  plotting
attacks  in  Pakistan.  A  local  history  of  terrorism  and  ongoing  ideological  aspirations  of
violence by extremist elements have led to indiscriminate attacks on civilian as well as
local  military and police targets. The State Department advises that terrorists may attack
with  little  or  no  warning,  targeting  transportation  hubs,  shopping  malls,  military
installations, airports, universities, tourist locations, schools, hospitals, places of worship,
and government facilities. While rare in the capital Islamabad, terrorist acts continue in
other  areas  of  Pakistan.  Large-scale  terrorist  attacks  have  resulted  in  numerous
casualties,  with  most  of  the  attacks  occurring  in  the  Balochistan  and  the  Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) provinces, including the former Federally Administered Tribal Areas
(FATA).  The  current  travel  warning  to  these  areas  is  Level  4  –  Do  Not  Travel  due  to
terrorism  and  kidnapping.  The  United  States  has  limited  ability  to  provide  emergency
services  to  U.S.  citizens  in  Pakistan  due  to  the  security  environment.  Travel  by  U.S.
government personnel within Pakistan is restricted.
Police have primary domestic security responsibility for most of the country with
local  police  being  under  the  jurisdiction  of  provincial  governments.  Paramilitary
organizations,  including  the  Frontier  Corps  which  operates  in  Balochistan  and  KPK
provinces,  including  the  former  FATA,  and  the  Rangers,  which  operate  in  Sindh  and
Punjab, provide security services under the authority of the Ministry of Interior. Pakistan’s
military is the lead security agency in many areas of the former FATA. The military and
intelligence  services  operate  independently  and  without  effective  civilian  oversight.
Members of the security forces committed numerous abuses in 2020.
Significant human rights issues in Pakistan included unlawful or arbitrary killings
by the government or its agents, including extrajudicial killings; forced disappearance by
the  government  or  its  agents;  torture  and  cases  of  cruel,  inhuman,  and  degrading
treatment or punishment by the government or its agents; arbitrary detention; harsh and
life-threatening prison conditions; and political prisoners and politically-motivated reprisal.
A prominent tribal figure and Pashtun rights leader, who had been recently released from
jail for speeches critical of the Pakistani military establishment, died after being shot by
identified actors outside his home on May 1, 2020.  There were numerous reports of fatal
attacks against police and security forces in Pakistan in 2020. Kidnappings and forced
disappearances  of  persons  took  place  in  nearly  all  areas  of  the  country.  There  were
reports  of  police  making  arrests  to  extract  bribes.  While  the  law  provides  for  an
independent judiciary, the judiciary was often subject to external influences, such as fear
of  reprisal  from  extremist  elements  in  terrorism  or  blasphemy  cases  and  public
politicization of high-profile cases.
journalists,  censorship,  and
Other human rights abuses included arbitrary or unlawful government interference
with privacy; serious restrictions on free expression, the press, and the Internet, including
violence  against
Internet-site  blocking;  government
interference with the rights of peaceable assembly and freedom of association, including
of workers; severe restrictions on religious freedom; restrictions on freedom of movement;
corruption  within  the  bureaucracy;  lack  of  accountability  for  gender  violence;  unlawful
recruitment of child soldiers; and the use of the worst forms of child labor. In 2018, 2019,
and 2020, the U.S. Department of State designated Pakistan as a Country of Particular
Concern under the 1998 International Freedom Act, as amended, for having engaged in
or tolerated severe violations of religious freedom.
There  was  a  lack  of  government  accountability,  and  abuses  often  went
unpunished,  fostering  a  culture  of  impunity  among  perpetrators,  whether  official  or
unofficial. Authorities seldom punished government officials for human rights abuses in
2020.  Corruption  was  pervasive  in  politics  and  government  in  2020.  Terrorist  violence
and  human  rights  abuses  by  non-state  actors  contributed  to  human  rights  problems,
although to a lesser extent than in previous years due to the overall decline in terrorist
activity and military, police, and law enforcement campaigns against militant and terrorist
groups. Political, sectarian, criminal, and ethnic violence continued in Karachi in 2020.

"The  SOR  identifies  six  allegations  under  Guideline  B  (foreign  influence).
Applicant  admitted  all  allegations.  He  noted  that  his  potential  inheritance  of  a  house
located  on  a  parcel  of  land  was  less  than  $400,000.  (SOR  1.f)  All  references  to  the
government  exhibits  shall  be  to  the  typed  page  numbers  that  are  in  the  upper  right
corner or at the bottom of the page.
Applicant,  40  years  old,  was  born  in  Iraq  in  1981.  He  received  his  Iraqi
high  school  diploma  in  July  2000,  and  an  electrician’s  certificate  that  allowed  him  to
avoid  compulsory  service  in  the  Iraqi  military.  (GE  1  at  13;  GE  2  at  4)  He  assumed
financial  responsibility  for  his  mother  and  two  sisters  after  his  father  died  in  a  train
accident in 2004. (Answer to SOR at 3) As shall be discussed below, from 2004 to late
2013,  Applicant  was  an  Iraqi  police  officer.  He  married  his  wife,  an  Iraqi  citizen,  in
2010. (GE 1 at 26) Their ceremony took place in Iraq.  They immigrated to the United
States after he received death threats in 2012. After his wife’s cousin,  an  Iraqi linguist
employed by the U.S. military, was assassinated by terrorists in September 2013, they
immigrated to the United  States  later in  the same month.  (GE 2 at 5)  Applicant’s  two
children,  seven  and  five  years  old,  were  born  in  the  United  States.  His  wife  is  also
pregnant. He and his wife became U.S. citizens in 2019. She has been employed by a
department store as a salesperson since 2017. (GE 1 at 30; Tr. 6, 16-21, 45)
Background
In 2003, the coalition forces began to hire Iraqis into linguist and police officer
positions.  A  commander  in  the  Iraqi  police  force,  recognizing  Applicant’s  language
skills, hired him and sent him to a neighboring middle eastern country for a six-month
training course at the country’s police academy. (Answer to SOR at 3; GE 2 at 1, 8; AE
B2)
For  the  first  five  years  of  employment  as  a  patrol  officer,  Applicant  went  on
patrols  with  United  States  Army  (USA),  helping  them  remove  improvised  explosive
devices (IEDs) from the roads. He also worked with them as a secondary linguist when
their  primary  linguist  was  absent.  (Tr.  32-33)  In  2008,  he  was  promoted  to  internal
affairs  of  the  Ministry of  Interior,  and  ultimately promoted  to  detective  in  that  division.
He was assigned to the director’s office where one of his responsibilities was to gather
and  marshal  documents  for  the  prime  minister’s  review.  In  addition  to  resigning  from
the ministry because of his wife’s cousin’s assassination, he resigned from the ministry
after  receiving  repeated  death  threats  in  2012  from  Iran  proxies  to  leave  his  position
because of his affiliation to the wrong religious faith. (Answer to SOR at 3; GE 2 at 4;
(Tr. 32-37)
Applicant  considered  his  collaborative  Iraqi  police  work  with  the  coalition
forces and his cousin’s assassination as two important factors that could qualify him for
refugee  status  to  increase  his  chances  of  immigrating  to  the  United  States.  So  he
applied for that status through the International Organization for Migration (IOM).  After
many  interviews  at  the  United  States  (U.S.)  Embassy  in  Iraq  in  2013,  Applicant’s
refugee status was approved, and he immigrated to United States in the same year. In
2014, he received U.S. permanent resident status. Applicant has not been back to Iraq
since 2013, and has no intention of  returning in the future.  (GE 3 at 5; GE 4 at 2; Tr.
36, 46)
Between  2013  and  March 2018, Applicant worked  in the  United  States at three
armed  security  positions and  was a  security  manager at a  reputable  department  store.
He was fired  from  one  of those  positions  for an  arrest made  without sufficient  probable
cause.   The   termination   does  not   tarnish   his  employment  history   because   he   was
immediately  hired  by  a  competitive  department store’s security  team. (GE 1  at 17; GE
3   at  5)  In   August  2018,  Applicant   established   a   military   supply   business  that  designs
and  sells clothing  and  accessories  to   police  and  military  personnel. (GE 2  at  2)  For a
period   of   time   in  2019   that  is  not  clear from   Applicant’s  testimony,  after  receiving   his
U.S. citizenship  in April 2019,  and  applying  for his current  linguist position, he  applied
for  another  linguist  position   and   received   an   interim   security   clearance.  Following
training,  he   was  sent  to   another  U.S.  state   for  supplemental  training   and   then   to   Iraq
under  a   six-month   contract.  However,  the   then-president  of   the   United   States
downsized   the   unit  Applicant  was  working   for,  and   he   was  sent  back  to   the   United
States   in   late   2019.  (Tr.  47-48)  Though   he   indicated   he   was  scheduled   to   begin
security  training  with  the  Department of  State  in  early  2020, there  is no  indication  from
the  record that his training  was initiated  or completed. Since  June  2020, Applicant  has
been  working  as a  security  officer for a federal agency.  (GE  1  at 15; GE  2  at 2, 3; GE  3
at 5;  Tr. 21; answer to SOR at 3-4)
SOR  1.a  –  Applicant’s  mother  is  69  years  old  and  has  three  children,  two
daughters and Applicant. She is a permanent U.S. resident, but still is an Iraqi citizen.
She  has  been  living  with  Applicant  for  the  past  four  months.  He  has  continued  to
provide  her  financial  support  since  2013,  both  in  Iraq  and  the  United  States.  She  is
retired  from  a  clerk’s  position  in  the  Iraqi  Ministry  of  Agriculture  where  she  worked
about  10  years.  Applicant  testified  that  she  receives  no  pension  because  she  did  not
work  there  15  years  and  did  not  have  three  children.  (Applicant  must  not  have  been
considered  one  of  her  children  because  of  his  immigration  to  the  United  States  in
2013.) She has cardiovascular problems. She intends to stay in this country. (GE 1 at
28; GE 2 at 14; GE 3 at 1; Tr. 22-24, 53-55)
SOR  1.b  –  Applicant’s  oldest  sister was  born  in Iraq  in  1986  and is 35 years
old.  Her  job  as  a  bookkeeper  at  a  courthouse  connects  her  to  a  branch  of  the  Iraqi
government.  She  is  not  affiliated  with  any  foreign  military  service.  Her  husband  is  a
financial analyst with the court. She has two children. Applicant talks with her every 10
days, exchanging pleasantries and making inquiries about the kids. She knows he is a
security  guard,  but  does  not  know  he  is  applying  for  a  security  clearance.  Applicant
offered to sponsor her U.S immigration. He saw this sister in 2013, the last time he was
in Iraq before he immigrated to the United States. (GE 1 at 25-27, 33-34, 56; GE 3 at 2;
Tr. 56-58)
SOR 1.c – Applicant’s younger sister was born in Iraq in 1989, and is 32 years
old. She moved to the United States in 2014 and became a permanent resident. She is
a  married-housewife  with  two  children.  She  never  had  any  affiliation  with  any
government  or  military.  All  her  family  members  are  now  U.S.  citizens.  Her  husband
sells  medical  insurance.  She  is  a  housewife  who  never  had  an  affiliation  with  any
foreign government or military. (GE 3 at 2; Tr. 29-30, 58-59)
SOR  1.d  –  Applicant  was  a  security  officer  in  Iraq  from  April  2004  to
September 2013. See discussion above. (GE 1 at 20-21; GE 2 at 4; GE 3 at 5; GE 4 at
2; answer to SOR at 3; Tr. 32-37)
SOR  1.e   –   Applicant’s  friend,  an  Iraqi  resident  citizen,  joined   the   Iraqi
police   department   when   Applicant  did  in   2004.  They   completed   the   same   police
academy  training  program  after they  joined  the  police. He  has  not seen  his friend  since
he  left the  police  in 2013. Except for monthly  contact with  his friend, Applicant has no
contact  with   any   other  individuals  he   worked   with   in  the   Iraqi  police   force.  In   their
telephone   conversations,  the   topics  of   discussion   are   the   welfare   of   each   other  and
their  families.  Applicant loaned  his friend  $300  in January  2019. Applicant testified  that
at  his  request,   the   friend   returned   the   money   to   Applicant’s  mother  (SOR  1.a).  The
friend   does  not  know   that  Applicant  is  applying   for  a   security   clearance.  To   reduce
potential  security   concerns,   after   he   received   the   SOR   in  January   2021,  Applicant
discontinued  contact with  his friend  altogether.  (GE  2  at 14; GE  3  at 6; Tr. 36-41, 64-
68)
SOR  1.f  –  Before  immigrating  to  the  United  States  in  2013,  Applicant
contributed about $60,000 to help his mother purchase a house in Iraq. Her investment
in  the  house  came  from  a  monetary  inheritance  from  Applicant’s  father.  Applicant  is
eligible  to  inherit  twice  his  two  sisters’  share  of  the  house  that  had  an  approximate
value  of  $400,000  in April 2019. Based on his subjective  belief  in an overall negative
change  in  the  surrounding  neighborhood,  Applicant  surmised  that  the  value  of  the
house has reduced to about $150,000. He intended to use his property inheritance to
invest  in  his  clothing supply business and  a down  payment  toward  the  purchase of  a
house in the United States. As mentioned in the background discussion above, he has
no intention of returning to Iraq. The house is empty at the present time. (GE 2 at 15;
Tr. 42-46, 68-74, 76-77)
Other  than  the  house,  Applicant  has  no  other  financial  interests  in  Iraq.
Though he did not respond to inquiries regarding ownership of U.S. stock investments,
he did have a retirement account valued at about $10,000, but he used the money to
purchase a car. His wife has $6,000 in her savings account. Their combined checking
accounts  total  $5,000.  He  has  a  mental  budget  that  he  and  his  wife  apply  to  bills  as
they become due. Applicant voted in the last federal and gubernatorial election in 2021.
(Tr. 77-81)
Applicant’s  allegiance  and  loyalty  is  only  to  the  United  States.  He  believes
these  are  key  factors  in  protecting  his  family.  He  signed  an  unofficial  memorandum
renouncing Iraqi citizenship. (GE 2 at 14-16; Tr. 46-49)
Character Evidence
On  June  1,  2020,  the  employee  relations  department  of  one  of  Applicant’s
previous  Iraqi  employers,  indicated  by  letter  that  Applicant’s  employment  was  his
position was terminated as a result of a reduction. He was eligible for rehire. (AE B1)
A former senior law enforcement advisor indicated in letters of July 2020 and
January 2014,  that  he  was  assigned  to  head  of  police  recruitment  in  2004,  where  he
met  Applicant.  The  law  advisor  extoled  Applicant’s  work  ethic  and  his  practical
approach  to  getting  problems  solved.  He  believes  Applicant  warrants  a  security
position (AE B2, B6)
On October 24, 2019, one of the commanding officers of the coalition forces,
commended Applicant for his linguist services from July-November 2019. For the four-
month  period,  Applicant  helped  the  coalition  forces  reinstate  advisor  operations  in
northwest Iraq. The author of this recommendation stated that he would take Applicant
anywhere.  Applicant  received  a  certificate  of  appreciation  on  November  1,  2019.  (AE
B3, E1)
In  an  undated  endorsement,  another  linguist  reported  that  she  met
Applicant  in  2019.  She  observed  how he  strived  to  support the  USA  in  every way he
could.  He  always  performed  his  work  in  a  timely  fashion  and  would  voluntarily  make
himself available for jobs that other linguists declined. (AE B4)
In  an  undated  letter,  another linguist  indicated  he  worked  with  Applicant
for  an  unidentified  period  with  in  an  Iraqi  location.  Applicant  always  showed
professionalism  in  carrying  out  his  assignments.  His  positive  attitude  at  work  justified
his application for security clearance eligibility. (AE B5)
On  October  19,  2021,  Applicant  received  a  certificate  for  completing  a
supervision and management course. (AE E2)
Administrative Notice  –  Republic of Iraq
Iraq is a parliamentary republic that continues to evolve into a stable country.
The  outcome  of  the  2014  parliamentary  elections  met  international  standards  of  fair
elections  and  led  to  the  peaceful  transition  of  leadership  from  former  Prime  Minister
Nouri al-Maliki to Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi.
In  December  2019  because  of  the  constant  demand  for  changes  in  the  Iraq
political system, Prime Minister Adil Abd al-Mahdi resigned. A new prime minister was
confirmed by the Iraq cabinet in May 2020. He promised to improve security and fight
corruption.  Several  assassinations  later  in  2020  of  protest  leaders  and  a  well-known
researcher caused  serious  doubt  in whether the new prime minister would  be able to
accomplish his objective.
The U.S. State Department warns U.S. citizens living in Iraq are at a high risk
for  kidnapping  and  terrorist  violence.  The  U.S.  Government  considers  the  potential
threats to U.S. government personnel in Iraq to be serious enough to require them to
live and work under strict security guidelines.
A 2019 human rights report indicated that serious human rights problems are
still  widespread  in  Iraq.  Sectarian  hostility  and  corruption  at  all  levels  of  government
have  diluted  the  Iraqi  government’s  human  rights  protections.  Other  human  rights-
related  problems  include:  dangerous  conditions  in  prisons  and  detention  facilities;
arbitrary  arrest  and  pretrial  detention;  limits  on  freedom  of  expression  and  assembly;
and discrimination based on gender, race, and religion.
",True
"Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR, with explanations and updates. After a
thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  testimony,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and is a Captain in
the Air Force Reserve. (TR at page 15 line 14 to page19 line 24, and GX 1 at pages 7
and 18.) He has held a security clearance since 2011 (GX 1 at page 90). He is married,
has one child, and he and his family live in the United States. (TR at page 17 line 14 to
page 18 line 1). From 2016~2018, Applicant attended National Taiwan University. This
is  where  he  met  his  wife,  and  all  his  other  acquaintances  noted  in  subparagraphs
1.d~1.j., which will be discussed further, below. (TR at page 16 line 21 to page 17 line
14.)
Guideline B - Foreign Influence
1.a.  Applicant’s  wife   is  a   citizen   of   China,  whom   he   met  in  graduate   school  in
Taiwan. (TR at page  17  lines  15~23,  and  at page  29  line  15  to  page  30  line  2.)   His wife
is the  “Executive  Assistant for the  CEO  of  a  [U.S.]  company  . . . which  handles traveling
nurses.” (TR at page 36 line  24 to page 37 line 3.)
1.b.  Applicant’s  mother-in-law   and   father-in-law   are  citizens  and   residents  of
China. He  has  little,  if any, relationship  with  his in-laws. “They  don’t speak English,” and
he   does   not  speak   their   “local  dialect.”  (TR  at  page   20   line   11   to   page   21   line   2.)
Applicant’s father-in-law  “was a  public-school  teacher,”  and  his mother-in-law  a  “retired  .
. . accountant.” (TR at page 36 at line 24 to page 37 line 3.)
1.c. Applicant’s wife has three uncles, five aunts, two cousins, two grandmothers,
and  a  grandfather  who  are  citizens  and  residents  of  China.  Only  her  uncle,  who  is  a
building inspector, arguably has any connection with the Chinese government. Applicant
“never met him,” and does not “even know his name.” (TR at page 33 line 13 to page 34

Notice
I  take administrative  notice  of  the following facts  regarding Taiwan:  Taiwan  is a
democracy led by a president and parliament selected in multiparty elections. In 1979,
the  United  States  switched  diplomatic  recognition  from  Taiwan  to  Chine.  Taiwanese
espionage  against  the  United  States  has  not  been  limited  to  industrial  espionage,  but
also to dual-use or military technology. (HX I.)
I take administrative notice of the following facts regarding the People’s Republic
of China (China). China is an authoritarian state in which the Chinese Communist Party
is  the  paramount  authority.  China  has  expansive  efforts  in  place  to  acquire  U.S.
technology  to  include  secrets  and  proprietary  information.  About  80  percent  of  all
economic espionage  prosecutions  brought  by the  U.S.  Department of  Justice  relate to
the Chinese state. (HX II.)

"In her response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations contained in the
SOR without further elaboration, evidence, or explanation. These allegations involved the
fact  that  her mother, father, sister, and  brother  are  all  resident  citizens  of  Poland.  Her
admissions are incorporated into these findings of fact.
Applicant is 40 years old. She earned a bachelor’s degree in Poland in May 2003,
and a master’s degree from a U.S. university in May 2008. She has never served in the
military or worked for the governments of either Poland or the United States. This is her
first  application  for  national  security  eligibility,  which  she  seeks  in  connection  with  her
defense contractor position as a linguist in Poland that she obtained in February 2020.
(Item 3; Item 4.)
Applicant  was  born  and  raised  in  Poland.  In  June  2003,  after  completing  her
education  there,  she  was  accepted  into  a  one-year  au  pair  program  and  came  to  the
United States to travel and further improve her English language skills. While here on that
J1  visa  she  applied  for  an  F1  student  visa,  which  was  granted.  She  remained  while
pursuing her master’s degree at a U.S. university from September 2004 until May 2008.
She married a native U.S. citizen in March 2008, becoming a permanent resident until
her naturalization as U.S. citizen in January 2012. Shortly thereafter, her divorce from her
husband  was  finalized  in  June  2012.  She  has  retained  her  Polish  citizenship  and  has
active passports from both nations. She claimed to have “equal allegiance  to  the  U.S.,
Poland, and [her] family in Poland.” (Item 3; Item 4.)
After her divorce,  Applicant lived  in a home owned by her aunt and uncle when
she was in the United States. She held full-time U.S. jobs from October 2018 to December
2019 and from August 2015 to September 2018, as well as part-time jobs from February
2016 to September 2018, and from April 2018 to June 2018. She also worked in two full-
time administrative positions in the medical field from April 2012 to October 2013, and as
a part-time caregiver for a U.S. home nursing company from July 2005 to February 2014.
(Item 3; Item 4.)
During that time she returned to Poland on numerous occasions to visit family and
look for employment there so she could move back. She was unsuccessful in finding a
job  in  Poland  until  obtaining  her  current  job  in  February  2020.  Since  her  U.S.
naturalization and divorce were final, she visited Poland from February 2014 to July 2015,
from  December  2017  to  January  2018,  from  June  2018  to  August  2018,  and  from
December 2019 to present. She lived with her parents from December 2019 to February
2020,  then  moved  into  military housing  on  a  Polish  Army  base  where  she  works.  She
wanted to return and live in Poland to be close to her family. (Item 3; Item 4.)
As Applicant admitted in her Answer, her mother, father, sister, and brother are
native citizens and residents of Poland. Her mother and brother are dentists, her father is
a retired provincial commander of the State Fire Service, and her sister is an ENT doctor.
Her mother and father are in their late sixties, and her siblings are 42 and 39 years old.
(Item 2, Item 4.)
The  record  contains  no  other  significant  evidence  concerning  Applicant’s  job
performance,  trustworthiness,  character  in  a  professional  setting,  or  track  record  with
respect to handling sensitive information and observation of security procedures. I was
unable to evaluate her credibility, demeanor, or character in person, since she elected to
have her case decided without a hearing.
As noted above, I take administrative notice of the facts about Poland that were
set  forth  in  the  official  U.S.  Government  publication  that  was  attached  to  Department
Counsel’s request for administrative notice. These include that Poland is a stalwart ally
of the United States, who is a NATO member, and with whom a strong relationship and
a shared commitment to freedom date back to the American Revolution.

"Applicant is 57 years old.  He is married and has four young-adult children.  He
has a Bachelor’s degree.  He is self-employed as an Arabic Linguist Consultant.  He is
seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.
Guideline E  –  Personal Conduct
Applicant was born in Saudi Arabia in June 1964.  He entered the United States
in  December  1984.  He  became  a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen  in  April  1989.  From
November 2015 to the present, Applicant has been an independent contractor working
as an Arabic linguist.
In  2003,  Applicant  served  as  a  linguist  in  Iraq  during  Operation  Iraqi  Freedom.
He states that he worked under some of the most dangerous conditions, and provided
linguistic support to our Army under bombing and shelling.  In spite of the risks involved,
the  harsh  living  conditions,  and  constant  fear  for  his  life,  he  states  that  he  stood  his
ground, and contributed his best to help our mission.  (Applicant’s Exhibit A.)
1.b.  While working as an interpreter in Iraq alongside our U.S. Army, Applicant states
that he defended the U.S. Army against any accusations brought forward by local Iraqis.
When the Abu Ghraib events were made public, Applicant was devastated.  He states
that  he felt  cheated and  let  down  by the  U.S.  Army’s conduct.  Out  of  pure frustration
and disappointment, he forwarded pictures (contained in an e-mail that he received from
a  high  school  friend),  without  reading  the  Arabic  text  contained  in  it,  to  his  coworkers
and  colleagues,  who  were  U.S.  citizens.  The  e-mail  contained  pictures  of  prisoners
being tortured by their captors.  The pictures were upsetting to the Applicant.  Applicant
also  added  some  written  comments  and  sent  them  along  with  the  pictures  that  said
something  to  the  effect,  “This  is  not  the  freedom  we  came  to  deliver.  Our  tax  money
should  not  be  used  this  way.  Shame  on  you  George  Bush.”  Applicant  states  that  in
May 2004, he was removed from the project and told to return to the United States.  He
refused  to  do  so  without  explanation  as  to  why  he  was  being  removed.  Applicant  did
not understand why he was being removed.  He states that upon his return to the United
States, he was able to read the e-mail in its entirety for the first time, and realized that
the  text  was  written  in  Arabic  in  a  very  hateful,  resentful  and  threatening  language
toward the United States, its Army, and its citizens.  Applicant was terminated from an
Intelligence  Agency  contractor  for  forwarding  this  e-mail  containing  hateful  and
threatening language toward the U.S. and its citizens.  (Applicant’s Exhibit A.)
1.a.  From  October  2013  to  November  2015,  Applicant  worked  as  a  Healthcare
Interpreter for a clinic.  While working for this employer, Applicant was investigated for
sending inappropriate images and texts to other Arabic-speaking employees.  The text
stated,  “This  prayer  to  Allah  to  take  revenge  on  each  and  everyone  (sic)  of  Islam’s
enemies  and  wishing the most  severe  torture  and  punishment  on them  in  this life  and
also the other life hereafter.”  Applicant was investigated for this misconduct and found
culpable.  Applicant stated that the content of the text also included a picture of an adult
standing  on  the  neck  and  private  area  of  an  infant.  The  caption  above  it  stated  in
Arabic…“the  Muslim  children  of  Burma,  their  only  guilt  is  that  they  are  Muslims”.  The
Applicant then added his personal comments, stating in Arabic, (sic) “ ALLh/God is our
savior and upon him we depend, to ALLh we belong and to Him we shall return, and no
might  nor  power  except  that  by  ALLh,  Dear  God  Who  Is  ALL  Powerful,  Mighty,
Vengeful,  Great,  Just,  True  and  the  One  and  Only,  we  ask  You  by  Your  Glourious
name, to make us witness your amazing power and fierce torment against all those who
are the enemies of Islam, soon not later, in this life and the Hereafter.  And to give glory
to Islam and Muslims, Amen.”  (Applicant’s Exhibit A.)
Applicant  does  not  believe  that  his  comments  targeted  anyone  specifically,  nor
did it express hate, harm or a threat to anyone.  He believes that the text was taken out
of context and given the wrong and unintended meaning.  (Applicant’s Exhibit A.)
While  working  for  the  same  employer,  Applicant  was  also  investigated  for
misusing  the  time  clock.  On  a  number  of  occasions,  Applicant  would  clock  into  work
and then leave to park his car.  Applicant was either suspended or terminated in about
November 2015, for time card fraud.  (Government Exhibits 3 and 4.)  Applicant states
that  his  corrective  action  for  his  time  card  fraud  was  a  suspension  from  work  from
November 4, 2015 to November 9, 2015.  (Government Exhibit 5.)  He believes that his
employment ended from the company for violating company policy, namely for working
off the clock.  Applicant stated that after working his regular scheduled hours, he would
at  times,  clock  out  and  continue  working,  to  complete  pending  work  and  urgent
transactions, which he found was against company policy.  Applicant states that he was
not  compensated  for  this  work.  He  states  that  he  did  not  know  that  he  was  doing
anything wrong.  He  states that  the  reason he  was  working off  the  clock  was  to avoid
putting in for over-time  and to help his department keep expenses  down.  (Applicant’s
Exhibit  A.)
regulations and was terminated from the job.
In  either  case,  Applicant  was  not  following  the  company  rules  and
1.c.  During his interview with the OPM investigator on March 2019, Applicant admitted
to  using  fictitious  dates  of  birth  when  using  various  dating  websites  like  Match.com.,
despite being married.  His wife is unaware of his propensity for visiting dating websites.
(Government Exhibit 4.)
Guideline B –  Foreign Influence
Applicant has close ties with several family members who reside in Saudi Arabia.
Applicant’s brother is a citizen of Jordan and a resident of Saudi Arabia.  His sister is a
citizen  and  resident  of  Saudi  Arabia.  His  mother-in-law  was  a  citizen  of  Egypt  and  a
resident  of  Saudi  Arabia.  His  brother-on-law  is  a  citizen  of  Canada  and  a  resident  of
Saudi Arabia.
Applicant  states  that  he  is  loyal  and  dedicated  to  the  United  States.  He  states
that his relatives  in  Saudi Arabia  are normal middle-class  citizens  with  no  government
affiliations.  He states that he has no communication of any sort with one of his brother
since 2003, as they are no longer on good terms due to financial disputes.  (Applicant’s
Exhibit A.)  However, Applicant has another brother, who used to live in Jordan, but now
lives in Saudi Arabia.  Applicant has weekly communication with him via text message
using  the  social  media  application,  What’s  App.  This  brother  works  as  a  computer
software consultant.  (Government Exhibit 4.)  Applicant also maintains regular contact
with  his  sister  in  Saudi  Arabia,  via  text  message  by  using  What’s  App.  (Government
Exhibit  4.)  Applicant’s  mother-in-law  is  deceased  and  does  not  pose  a  security  risk.
(Applicant’s Exhibit A.)
Since  Applicant  still  maintains  regular  contact  with  his  sister,  a  brother, and  his
brother-in-law,  who  reside  in  Saudi  Arabia,  it  is  assumed  that  he  has  feelings  of
affection and obligation to them.  The conditions in Saudi Arabia are unpredictable and
often volatile and dangerous.  Given Applicant’s past behavior, where his character has
battled  some  conflict  with  what  is  going  on  in  Saudi  Arabia  and  the  reaction  of  the
United States, these foreign contacts may pose a risk to the national security.
Notice
I  have  taken  administrative  notice  of  the  following  information  concerning  the
country  of  Saudi  Arabia.  The  Kingdom  of  Saudi  Arabia  is  a  monarchy  ruled  by  King
Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, who is both head of state and head of government.  The
1992 Basic Law sets out the system of governance, rights of citizens, and powers and
duties of the government, and it provides that the Quran and Sunna (the traditions of the
Prophet Muhammad) serve as the country’s constitution.  The U.S. Department of State
has issued a Level 4 Travel advisory to warn travelers not to travel to Saudi Arabia due
to  the  threat  of  missile  and  drone  attacks  on  civilian  facilities  perpetrated  by  Iran  and
Iran-supported  militant  groups.  Many  terrorist  groups  continue  to  plot  attacks  in  Saudi
Arabia,  including  arbitrary  detentions  and  other  significant  human  rights  issues.

"Applicant  admitted  the  SOR  allegations  in  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b  and  denied  the
allegations in 1.c and 1.d. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony,
and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  64  years old.  He  was  married  once from  2003  to  2006  and has no
children.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in 1990.  He  was  self-employed  from  2004  to
2015  and  was  unemployed  from  approximately December 2015  to February 2017.  He
was underemployed until he began working for his present employer in May 2020. His
current annual salary is approximately $90,000. (Transcript (Tr.) 22-27)
Applicant  attributed  his  delinquent  debts  to  his  period  of  unemployment  and
underemployment. In 2015, he lost a contract with the federal government. He attributed
it  to  a  cut  in  the  defense  budget  at  the  time.  Prior  to  then,  he  had  met  his  financial
obligations. He worked at different jobs and slowly increased his annual income. In 2019,
he  decided  to  begin  collecting  Social Security  benefits.  Applicant provided  a  copy  of  his
Social  Security   earning   statement,   which  showed   his  annual   earnings:  2014-$23,000;
2015-$20,000;  2016-$13,600;  2017-$25,000;  2018-$32,000;  2019-$47,000;  2020-
$55,000 and 2021-$88,000. (Tr.  49-55;  AE I)
Applicant inherited a house from his parents that is paid for and has no mortgage.
His  car  is  paid.  Since  he  began  his  current  employment  he  has  saved  approximately
$6,000 and contributed a combined amount of about $11,000 in his Individual Retirement
Account  and  his  401K  pension  plan.  He  also  invested  about  $1,400  in  stocks.  Post-
hearing,  Applicant  provided  information  that  after  receiving  Social  Security  benefits  he
changed his mind and he has repaid the Social Security Administration $17,000 that he
received. He also provided an August 2009 credit report to show at that time his credit
score was 745. (Tr. 27- 32, 56-58; AE C, D, E, F, H)
The  debts  alleged  in  the  SOR  are  corroborated  by  Applicant’s  admissions,
statements, and credit reports from March 2018, April 2019, February 2021, and March
2022. (GE 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
Applicant purchased a boat when he was employed and owned it for a couple of
years.  In  2016,  when  he  was  no  longer  employed  he  was  unable  to  make  the  loan
payments.  He  voluntarily  returned  the  boat  to  the  creditor.  (SOR  ¶  1.a-$22,876)  He
disclosed this debt on his February 2018 security clearance application (SCA) and stated
it  was  resolved.  In  December  2018,  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  government
investigator.  He  told  the  investigator  that  after  he  returned  the  boat  to  the  creditor  he
believed the issue was resolved. He could not explain how he believed it was resolved.
He testified that he contacted the bank that gave him the loan for the boat in 2016, 2017
and  2018.  The  bank  also  contacted  him  wanting  to  collect  the  debt  and  offered  him  a
settlement  of  $8,000.  He  could  not  afford  the  settlement  because he  did  not  have  the
money at the time. Applicant testified that he is near retirement and does not intend to
pay  this  debt.  Post-hearing,  he  stated  that  the  debt  was  charged  off  in  2016  and  the
account was closed in April 2021. It is unresolved. (Tr. 37-40, 55-56)
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.b ($15,252) was a signature loan that Applicant obtained. He
stopped  paying  the  loan  when  he  was  unemployed  and  could  not  afford  to  pay.  He
disclosed  this  debt  on  his  SCA  and  said  he  could  not  afford  to  pay  it.  He  told  the
government investigator that he reached out to the creditor in December 2017  after he
got  a  job  and  was  told  the  loan  was  in  collection,  and  he  would  be  contacted  by  the
creditor’s attorneys. He testified that he was waiting to hear from the attorney and never
did. At that time, he made no other attempts to resolve the debt. At his hearing, he testified
that he did not intend to pay the debt. After his hearing, he contacted the attorney of the
creditor and was advised it could not locate the account. The debt is unresolved. (Tr. 34-
37, 55-56)
The debt in SOR ¶ 1.c ($5,704) was for a credit card that became delinquent in
2016.  In  2018,  Applicant  reached  a  settlement  with  the  creditor  and  made  monthly
payments to resolve  the  debt.  It is listed on his credit  report as  settled. This debt  was
resolved in February 2021. (Tr. 32, 40-43, 48-49; Answer to SOR; GE 4, 6)
Applicant testified that he could not identify the medical debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d
($264). He attempted to contact the creditor and was told the company no longer existed.
He thought it could possibly be for a laboratory expense. He provided a letter from the
laboratory  service  noting  he  had  a  zero  balance.  He  has  made  a  reasonable  effort  to
resolve this debt. I find in his favor for this debt. (Tr. 43-47)
Applicant testified that in June 2020, he met a woman from the Philippines through
an Internet site. They text or talk a couple of times a day. They may have a video chat
once or twice a day. She told him she had lost her accounting job and was unemployed.
In February 2021, Applicant began sending her $400 a month  and continues to do so.
Applicant stated she is now employed, but it is not enough to support herself. He does
not know who her employer is, but believes it is a private company. He is unaware if she
or her family have government contacts, but believes her parents are retired and live in
the country. In March 2022, he traveled to the Philippines to visit her for two weeks. He
refers to her as his girlfriend and confirmed he has a romantic relationship with her. He
told his facility security officer (FSO) about 18 months ago that he intended to travel to
the Philippines in the future. He did not tell his FSO about the actual trip until his return.
He could not recall if he told the FSO that he was visiting his girlfriend in the Philippines.
His estimated that his trip cost about $3,000 to $3,500. He provided documents to show
he  received  a  foreign  travel  debrief  upon  his return  from  the  Philippines  in  late  March
2022. His foreign travel debriefing document asked if during his foreign travel he made
any  acquaintances  with  any  foreign  nationals.  He  answered  “no.”  He  provided  a
document  to  show  he  enrolled  in  United  States  Department  of  State  Smart  Traveler
Enrollment Program indicating he was traveling to the Philippines. (Tr. 58-81; AE G)

"Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR and they are incorporated in
the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and
exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 56 years old. He was born in Iraq. In 1988, he earned a bachelor’s of
law degree from a university in Iraq. He married in 1996. His eldest child was born in Iraq.
In  1999,  Applicant  refused  to  join  the  Bathe  party  in  Iraq,  subjecting  him  to  possible
imprisonment or death by the Saddam Hussein regime.  That same year Applicant, his
wife  who  was  pregnant  at  the  time,  and  their  child  fled  Iraq  to  Syria  where  they  were
refugees. His second child was born in Syria. In March 2001, through a United Nations
program, he and his family immigrated to the United States. He has worked for different
federal contractors, as a teacher of Arabic languages, since 2009, and has worked for his
current employer, also a defense contractor, since 2017. (Transcript (Tr.) 20-26)
Applicant  and  his  family  became  naturalized  U.S.  citizens  in  March  2001.  He
disclosed  on  his  October  2015  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  that  he  does  not
possess  an  Iraqi  passport  because  of  his  escape  to  Syria.  He  does  possess  a  U.S.
passport. During his background interview with a government investigator he stated that
he maintains dual citizenship with the United States and Iraq. At his hearing, he confirmed
he is a dual citizen and he intends to maintain his Iraqi citizenship so he can retain his
right  to  inherit  family  property  that  was  left  to  him  and  his  siblings  by  their  father  who
passed away about 20 years ago. His brother currently lives in the house rent-free. Under
Shi’a  law  the  men  are  entitled  to  an  equal share  and  the  women  are  entitled  to  a  half
share of the proceeds of the house. He estimated the house was worth about $500,000.
(Tr. 44-54)
Applicant has three sisters and a brother who are citizens and residents of Iraq.
He has asked his brother to sell the house so they can split the proceeds in accordance
with the law. His sisters also want the brother to sell the house, so they can receive their
inheritance. Applicant stated  that he has asked  his brother to complete the sale in the
next one to two years. He told him if he has financial difficulty after selling the house, he
will help him out, but it is not fair he has lived in the house for so long and deprived the
siblings of their  inheritance.  If his brother refuses, he  will have  to  take  him  to  court.  He
would  prefer  not  to   have   to   go   to   court.  Applicant   testified   that   he   will  maintain   his
citizenship ties to  Iraq  until after his brother resolves the house  issue. He does  not know
what he  will do  regarding  his citizenship  when  the  house  issue  is resolved. (Tr.  26-30,  44-
54;  GE 1)
Applicant’s  brother  is  a  retired  port  employee.  His  eldest  sister  is  a  widow  with
grown children, who works for a university library. His middle sister is a principal of a high
school, and his youngest sister is a homemaker. His siblings all have families. Applicant
helps  his  siblings  financially  when  they  need  it.  He  explained  that  their  income  is
significantly less than he earns. He helps his eldest sister the most. Her husband was
assassinated  by  terrorists  in  2005.  None  of  his  family  have  visited  him  in  the  United
States. The  SOR alleged  that Applicant’s father-in-law is a citizen and resident of Iraq.
He passed away about two years ago. (Tr. 26-32)
Applicant returned to Iraq with his family in 2004 so they could visit both his and
his wife’s family. He again took his family to Iraq in 2009 to visit family. He went back on
his own in 2013, 2017, 2019, and December of 2021. His purpose was to visit his family
and friends. He also stays in regular contact with his family by phone. He has friends and
colleagues that work in the legal system, including attorneys and judges, with whom he
worked for ten years. He also visits them while he is in Iraq. (Tr. 27-34)
Applicant testified that his siblings do not know what his job is in the United States.
He intentionally shields them from this knowledge to keep them safe. He tells them he is
a teacher at a school. He does not disclose to any of his Iraqi friends that he works as a
teacher for a defense contractor. He believes his family and friends are now safe in Iraq,
but he wants to ensure their continued safety. He stated there is still a concern from rogue
militia, so the best way to keep his family safe is to not tell them anything about his job.
(Tr. 60-63)
Applicant  was  asked  if  he  has  a  concern  about  people  in  Iraq  knowing  how he
escaped to Syria. He stated he does not share his story with anyone there. His family
knows how he left, but no one else. When he visits Iraq, the people in the neighborhood
where he used to live no longer recognize him. His colleagues at the court  and friends
recognize him and he engages with them when he is visiting the country. (Tr. 60-63)
Applicant was a lawyer in Iraq. When Saddam Hussein was in power, Applicant’s
name was removed from the active lawyer rolls. In 2009, when he returned to Iraq, he
petitioned to be reinstated. His petition was granted and since then Applicant has paid
the annual membership fees to maintain his law license there. He sends the money to his
sister, who then gives it to his friends who then pay the dues. He intends to maintain his
law license in the future. (Tr. 34-38)
In  2008,  Applicant  and  his  family  were  provided  with  a  house  from  Habitat  for
Humanity.  He  is  required  to  pay  the  interest-free  mortgage  on  the  home  for  20  years.
Once he completes this period of payments he will own the house outright. He stated the
value of  the house is about $230,000 and he owes about $40,000.  He currently earns
about $47,000 and his wife, who is a school secretary, earns about $23,000. His older
child graduated from college and lives at home. His younger child is attending college,
and also lives at home. They received scholarships to fund their education.  (Tr. 38-41,
48-49)
Applicant plans to retire in the United States. He is grateful and loyal to the United
States for accepting his family as immigrants. In 2005, he was asked by a representative
of  the  United  Nations to  help  Iraqis living in  the  United  States  participate  in  the  voting
process in their country’s election. He was a paid full-time worker and helped in various
capacities. He voted in this election and was not yet a citizen of the United States.  He
again voted in the Iraqi elections in 2014, while living in the United States, and subsequent
to becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen, in hopes of improving the country. (Tr. 54-59)

"The  SOR  identifies  five  allegations  under  Guideline  B  (foreign  influence)
applying  to  Applicant’s  foreign  family  members  and  friends,  who  are  citizens  and
residents  of  Iraq.  He  admitted  all  allegations.  References  to  the  government  exhibits
shall be to the typed page numbers located in the upper right corner of the page.
Applicant,  34  years  old,  was  born  in  Iraq  in  1987.  He  received  his  Iraqi  high
school  diploma  in  July 2008.  He  entered  the  United  States  in  May  2012,  and  tried  to
renounce  his  Iraqi  citizenship  when  he  became  a  U.S.  citizen  in  June  2017.  He  was
informed that that the policy had changed allowing him to retain his Iraqi passport but
not to use it. He has not used his Iraqi passport since becoming a U.S. citizen in June
2017. (GE 2 at 5) He earned some college credits in 2014 at a U.S. community college,
but  received  no  degree.  Before  he  began  attending  a  university  in  the  fall  of  2020,
where  he  intends  to  complete  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  May  2022,  he  attended  a
community college. To pay for his education, he receives financial aid, a  scholarship,
and  a  monthly  check  from  a  friend.  Applicant  has  never  been  married.  He  seeks  his
initial security clearance. (GE 1 at 9-10, 16, 28, 73, 76-80, 89-90)
In  May  2018,  Applicant  was  working  in  the  United  States  as  a  mechanic.  In
April  2018,  he  was  hired  as  a  linguist,  and  anticipates  deployment  once  his  security
clearance  application  is  granted.  His  security  clearance  application  shows  a  gap  in
employment  activity  from  January  2018  to  April  2018.  He  was  unemployed  between
October  2014  and  December  2017.  During  the  period,  he  traveled  to  six  foreign
countries. Four of those trips were to Iraq, and each lasted more than 30 days. (GE 1
at 61-69) Between August 2013 and September 2014, Applicant was a security officer.
In  his  last  linguist  position  from  May  to  July  2013,  he  also  had  role  playing
responsibilities.  He  was  unemployed  in  the  previous  five  months.  For  a  two  month-
period  in  2012, he  worked for a  cleaning company.  From December 2008 to October
2011,  Applicant  was  employed  by  a  defense  contractor  as  a  linguist  in  Iraq.  His
supervisor during the period wrote a statement about Applicant’s good performance as
a linguist between 2009 and 2010. (GE 1 at 24; AE B). Before working as a linguist, he
was unemployed from January 2007 to November 2008. (GE 1 at 16-25)
SOR 1.a – Applicant’s mother is 52 years old. She is a resident citizen of Iraq.
She is  a housewife and  cares for the  family children. She  used to work on  the family
farm  until  it  was  destroyed  by  the  Islamic  State  of  Iraq  and  Syria  (ISIS)  in  2014.
Applicant  has  weekly  contact  with  her  by  telephone  and  social  media.  He  sent  her
money from 2014 through 2020, but has sent no money in 2021. The mother has never
had  contact  with  any  government  or  military.  Living  with  his  mother  are  two  of
Applicant’s  sisters and  one  brother.  Applicant’s  mother does not  have  an  inheritance.
Instead,  she  obtains  assistance  from  non-government  organizations  (NGOs)  and  the
resources  provided  by  the  United  Nations.  Applicant’s  father  passed  away  in  2014  in
the ISIS attack. GE 1 at 29-34; Tr. 26-30, 45-46)
SOR 1.b – Applicant has a 15-year-old brother who is a citizen and resident of
Iraq. He attends an Iraqi high school. As noted in the preceding paragraph he lives with
Applicant’s mother. In  Applicant’s weekly  phone  calls with  his mother, he speaks with
his  younger  brother.  The  brother  is  unemployed  and  has  no  affiliation  with  a  foreign
government or military. (GE 1 at 30; Tr. 31, 46)
SOR  1.c  –  Four  of  Applicant’s  sisters  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Iraq.  The
32-year-old  sister  is  a  married  housewife.  Her  husband  is  an  unemployed  crane
operator. She has no affiliation with a foreign government or military. Applicant speaks
with her weekly by phone or social media. (GE 1 at 31; Tr. 48) Applicant’s 31-year-old
sister  is  a  married  housewife  with  no  affiliation  to  a  foreign  government  or  military.
Applicant has weekly contact with her by phone or social media. (GE 1 at 31; Tr. 49)
Applicant’s 20-year-old sister and his eight-year-old sister live with  Applicant’s mother.
In  his  weekly  contact  with  his  mother,  he  speaks  with  his  sisters  and  15-year-old
brother. (GE 1 at 29-34; Tr. 50-52)
SOR  1.d  –  Applicant’s  30-year-old  sister  is  married  and  lives  in  a  European
country  that  granted  her  refugee  status  because  she  survived  an  ISIS  attack.  She
stays  at  home  taking  care  of  her  newly  born  child.  Applicant  does  not  know  whether
her  husband  is  employed.  He  speaks  with  her  weekly,  probably by  phone  and  social
media  as  he  does  with  his  other  relatives.  This  sister  has  no  connection  to  a  foreign
government or military. (GE 1 at 34; Tr. 31, 49-50)
SOR  1.e  –  The  individuals  identified  below  include  friends  and  relatives  by
marriage. Those individuals will be identified here.
One  of  Applicant’s  close  friends  who  is  a  citizen  and  resident  of  Iraq,  is  his
brother-in-law (A). He is married  to  one  of Applicant’s sisters identified  at  GE  1  at 32.
(SOR  1.c)  He  has  occasional  employment  as  an  interpreter  with  a  NGO.  Applicant
contacts  him  monthly  by  phone  and  social  media.  This  person  has  no  connection  to
any government or military. (GE 1 at 41-42; Tr. 52-53)
Applicant’s  second  brother-in-law  (B)  is  the  crane  operator  married  to
Applicant’s 32-year-old sister. See SOR 1.c. Applicant speaks with him monthly when
he talks with his sister. He has no connection with any foreign government or military.
(GE 1 at 42-44; Tr. 53-54)
The  third  listed  foreign  contact  is  a  lifelong  friend  (C)  from  Applicant’s  Iraqi
childhood.  This  person,  a  citizen  of  Iraq,  currently  lives  in  a  European  country.
Applicant has not had contact with him in over a year. This friend is not associated with
a foreign government or military. (GE 1 at 44-45; Tr. 54-55)
Applicant  has  weekly  contact  with  his  cousin  (D),  the  fourth  listed  contact.
Their interaction occurs by phone and social media. This individual is a police officer,
but Applicant does not know his work location. He is considered an agent of the  Iraqi
state or local government. As discussed below, Applicant provided financial support to
this cousin and other family members and friends. (GE 1 at 55-56; Tr. 45-46)
Applicant  has  known  another  childhood  friend  (E)  since  approximately  2005.
He is employed by the Iraq army in the ministry of defense. The two persons converse
weekly or monthly over the phone or social media. Applicant provided financial support
to this person. (GE 1 at 46-47; Tr. 56-57)
The sixth foreign contact is the brother (F) of Applicant’s aunt. He owns a car-
parts store. Applicant contacts him about four times a year. He has no connection to a
foreign government or military. Applicant provided financial support to this person. (GE
48-49; Tr. 57-58)
The  seventh  foreign  contact  is  the  nephew  (G)  of  Applicant’s  other  aunt.  His
only  contact  with  this  nephew  occurred  when  Applicant  had  to  transfer  money  to  his
aunt. He provided financial support to this person. (GE 49-50)
The   eighth   contact  is  Applicant’s  uncle  (H)  who   is  married   to   his  aunt.
Applicant  contacts  him   quarterly.  This person   is unemployed.  (GE   1   at  50-51; Tr. 59-
60)
The  ninth  listed  contact  is  Applicant’s  cousin  (I).  This  person  works  in  the
residency office, and keeps track of foreigners who travel to and from an autonomous
region of northern Iraq. Applicant speaks with him monthly. Applicant provided financial
support to this individual. (GE 1 at 52-53; Tr. 60-61)
The   tenth   contact  is  another  uncle   (J)   who   Applicant  contacts  quarterly   by
phone  or social media.  This person  is a  farmer. Applicant  provided  financial  support  to
this uncle.  The  11th  contact  is an  aunt  (K)  who  Applicant spoke  with  quarterly  by  phone
or social media, but has not had  contact with  her  in over a  year. (GE  1  at 53-55; Tr. 61-
62)
Applicant  provided financial  support to  some  of  his relatives  and friends  from
his  Iraqi  hometown.  Except  where  noted,  most  these  individuals  are  citizens  and
residents of Iraq. The reason for the support was that these individuals lost everything
following  an  attack  by  ISIS  in  2014.  (Tr.  43-44)  It  is  surprising  that  Applicant  never
mentioned  this  attack  in  his  August  2018  PSI.  Instead,  he  only  explained  the  family
members  that  lived  in  tents  and  the  gifting  was  based  on  a  family  custom  motivating
family members to work together and share financial burdens. See GE 2 at 7.
Applicant  has  given  about  $18,000  to  his  cousin  D for  transfer  to  Applicant’s
mother  and  sisters;  he  provides  about  $10,000  annually  in  financial  support  for  his
mother (SOR 1.a). (GE 2 at 7; Tr. 62-63, 66)
Applicant  sent  cousin  (L),  a  citizen  of  Iraq  living  in  a  European  country,
approximately $2,500. He indicated he sent the money because, like some of the other
recipients,  this  cousin  he  had  lost  everything  in  the  2014  ISIS  attack.  Applicant  sent
friend  E  $5,000  and  another  cousin  I  $300  for  the  same  reason.  He  sent  his  uncle  J
about $4,000 to help pay his child’s medical expenses that the uncle could not afford.
He sent friend E $1,500 to help get back on his feet after the 2014 attack. (Tr. 63-64)
Applicant sent uncle J, referenced earlier, another $2,000. Applicant described
the  frequency  of  his  support  to  this  recipient  as  “twist.”  See  GE  1  at  57,  58.  (No
additional information was provided.)  He sent friend I $200 to give to his aunt  (K). He
sent  friend  E  about  $200.  Applicant  sent  cousin  I  $700  to  transfer  to  Applicant’s
mother. Applicant provided $2,500 to uncle J a couple of times. (Tr. 64-65) According
to  Applicant’s August 2018  PSI,  he  provided  at least $34,200 to relatives and friends.
(GE 2 at 7) Part of the money Applicant gifted to his relatives and friends in Iraq came
from his savings and from his friends in the United States. (Tr. 62-65, 80-83)
Applicant’s  most  recent  trip  to  Iraq  was  in  December 2020.  He  arrived  in  the
country on December 10, 2020 and returned to the United States on January 7, 2021.
He went to the country on several occasions in 2016 to determine whether any of the
victims in the 2014 hometown attack were members of his family. He indicated he lost
four family members in the 2014 attack. However, as noted earlier, he did not mention
this horrific event in his August 2018 PSI. Because of the unstable security situation in
his hometown, Applicant applied in 2018 to the International Organization for Migration
(IOM) for his family members to immigrate to the United States. (Tr. 67-70)
Applicant  has  no  foreign  property  or  financial  interests.  (GE  1  at  56)  Though
he owned a home in the United States in August 2017 (GE 1 at 12), he testified that he
owns no home or property in this country at the present time. He has about $20,000 in
savings, but no retirement account. He hopes to establish an account after he receives
his bachelor’s degree.  He initially testified that he had no close relatives in the United
States.  Then  he  testified  that  he  had  no  relatives  in  the  United  States.  When  asked
whether he was involved in his community, he testified “what is that,” then he indicated
that he was not involved in a religious or community organization. (Tr. 78-80)
If  a  terrorist  group  tried  to  exert  pressure  on  and  through  one  or  more  of
Applicant’s  foreign  family  members  to  get  Applicant  to  divulge  or  disclose  classified
information, he would not yield to that pressure. (Tr. 75)
Character Evidence
Applicant’s witness  (W) testified that he met Applicant while stationed in Iraq in
February or March 2009. W was part of an advisory and assistance team that traveled
around  to  train  local  Iraqi  border  enforcement  agents  (border  agents)  in  logistics  and
security. Applicant was introduced as the team’s interpreter for the next 12 months. He
supported the team on patrols through villages and forts. If the team had information to
exchange  with  local  border  agents,  Applicant  would  translate  that  information.  He
frequently  proposed  ideas  to  enhance  communication  and  interaction  between  the
coalition forces and the Iraqi locals. He taught the team different dialects of the Arabic
language. (Tr. 12-15, 20)
W explained that during his Iraqi deployment, about 70% of the time was spent
on  missions  away  from  the  military  base,  and  30%  of  the  time  they  were  inside  the
base to rest and replenish. W was armed during these missions, with body armor and
protective  equipment.  He  recalled  no  combat  incidents.  Though  W  could  not  recall
meeting  any  of  Applicant’s  family  members,  he  remembered  that  Applicant’s  family
prepared a meal and Applicant brought the meal to the team. (Tr. 16-20)
On March 3, 2009, the team chief  (TC) from December 2008 to March 2009,
indicated that Applicant was a level one interpreter with a commendable performance
record in executing interpreter duties with the border patrol officers and coalition forces.
Applicant displayed a promising future as an interpreter. In January 2009, he received
a certificate of appreciation for his service. (AE A)
On December 31 2009, a major (MA) wrote a recommendation for Applicant’s
admission  into  the  Special  Immigrant  Visa program  (SIV) based  on  his stellar linguist
service  between  December  2008  and  the  end  of  December  2009.  He  excelled  at
translating  discussions,  manuals,  and  other  documents.  He  provided  effective
assistance
the  maintenance  of  equipment  and  before  and  after  mission
responsibilities.  During  the  period  of  conflict,  because  Applicant  and  his  family  faced
threats  from  insurgents  hostile  to  the  Iraqi  government,  Applicant  constantly  wore
protective gear and concealed his identity to minimize the risk he and his family could
be kidnapped or executed. Applicant received a certificate of appreciation from MA for
his service to the coalition forces. (AE B)
in
On  February  2,  2010,  the  interpreter  manager  (IM)  wrote  a  recommendation
for  Applicant’s  enrollment  into  the  SIV  program.  As  MA  had  indicated,  Applicant
participated in over 400 combat missions and other mission-related activities with Iraqi
leadership and other prominent Iraqi locals. The remainder of this endorsement mirrors
M’s endorsement. (AE C)
On August 3, 2010, the commandant (CO) of the continuing education center,
wrote  that  Applicant  risked  his  life  on  numerous  occasions  in  patrols  and  forays  with
coalition forces. Applicant also trained Iraqi security forces so they could achieve more
effective security objectives. CO has no reason to believe that Applicant represents a
threat  to  the  national  security  of  the  United  States.  On  August  3,  2010,  CO  provided
Applicant a certificate or his support at the education center. (AE D)
On  October  10,  2011,  a  captain  (CP)  wrote  a  recommendation  based  on
Applicant’s  service  in  A’s  unit  for  three  months  in  2011,  and  his  service  by  MA  since
December  2008.  He  carried  out  linguistic  and  cultural  liaison  responsibilities  in  a
productive  manner.  He  demonstrated  loyalty  and  honesty.  (AE  E)  On  October  10,
2011,  Applicant  was  commended  for  his  honorable  linguist  service,  but  informed  his
assistance would no longer be needed. (AE F)
In an undated and unsigned recommendation, a squad leader (SL) wrote that
he was deployed to Iraq and Applicant was an interpreter who participated in about 400
combat missions and deserves significant credit for training the Iraqi police and army.
In  an  undated  unsigned  recommendation,  a  retired  police  detective  (PD)
indicated  that  he  held  positions  in  the  U.S.  government  at  some  time.  He  supervised
Applicant  for  a  two-year  period  between  2009  and  2011.  As  his  most  trusted
interpreter,  PD  helped  Applicant  apply  for  a  visa  through  the  SIV  program.  PD
recommends Applicant for a security clearance. (AE H)
In an undated, unsigned letter of recommendation, the assistant director (AD)
of  the  international  studies  program  commented  on  his  affiliation  with  Applicant.  AD
assisted  Applicant  in  the  selection  of  a  university  to  obtain  a  bachelor’s  degree.  AD
was involved in courses Applicant selected. He also taught two of Applicant’s courses.
Applicant  has shown  a  strong commitment  to  developing a  career in  the  international
community. (AE I)
In an unsigned and undated recommendation, a sergeant (SE) explained that
he  served  with  Applicant  in  Iraq  from  2009  to  2010,  when  SE  returned  to  the  United
States. After Applicant returned to United States in 2012, they resumed their contact.
SE  believes  Applicant  is  continuing  his  education  so  he  can  be  a  productive  and
dedicated member of the United States. (AE J)
On  July  15,  2021,  Applicant’s  point-of-contact  (POC)  handling  pay  and
personnel issues in late 2009, became close friends with Applicant and escorted him to
his interview to obtain a special immigrant visa (SIV). POC considers him a trustworthy
friend. (AE K)
On December 13, 2021, an Army National Guardsman (NG), who served with
Applicant in Iraq in 2009 and 2010, commented on his experiences with Applicant. For
the  entire  period,  Applicant  provided  effective  participation  in  the  success  of  the
coalition mission. (AE L)
In an undated recommendation, a former civilian police advisor (PA) contractor
was detailed to train local police forces, and relied heavily on the linguist assigned to
the  PA’s  team.  PA  and  Applicant  worked  together  for  months.  Applicant  listened
closely to the local Iraqis in meetings. During these meetings, he occasionally alerted
PA’s  team  when  he  believed  other  unfamiliar  linguists  were  experiencing  difficulty
translating  a  dialect.  He  also  took  extra  time  to  ensure  that  the  audiences  at  these
village meetings understood the issues for discussion as completely as possible.
Administrative Notice  –  Republic of Iraq
Iraq is a parliamentary republic that continues to evolve into a stable country.
The  outcome  of  the  2014  parliamentary  elections  met  international  standards  of  fair
elections  and  led  to  the  peaceful  transition  of  leadership  from  former  Prime  Minister
Nouri al-Maliki to Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi.
In  December  2019  because  of  the  constant  demand  for  changes  in  the  Iraq
political system, Prime Minister Adil Abd al-Mahdi resigned. A new prime minister was
confirmed by the Iraq cabinet in May 2020. He promised to improve security and fight
corruption.  Several  assassinations  later  in  2020  of  protest  leaders  and  a  well-known
researcher caused  serious  doubt  in whether the new prime minister would  be able to
accomplish his objective.
The U.S. State Department warns U.S. citizens living in Iraq are at a high risk
for  kidnapping  and  terrorist  violence.  The  U.S.  Government  considers  the  potential
threats to U.S. government personnel in Iraq to be serious enough to require them to
live and work under strict security guidelines.
A 2019 human rights report indicated that serious human rights problems are
still  widespread  in  Iraq.  Sectarian  hostility  and  corruption  at  all  levels  of  government
have  diluted  the  Iraqi  government’s  human  rights  protections.  Other  human  rights-
related  problems  include:  dangerous  conditions  in  prisons  and  detention  facilities;
arbitrary  arrest  and  pretrial  detention;  limits  on  freedom  of  expression  and  assembly;
and discrimination based on gender, race, and religion.

"Applicant  is  a  36-year-old  employee  of  a  federal  contractor.  He  is  seeking
eligibility for a clearance to work in contracts with federal agencies. Applicant was born
and  raised  in  Nigeria  to  Nigerian  parents.  He  was  raised  Catholic  and  attended  a
Catholic  primary school.  He  completed  high  school and  the  equivalent  of  a  bachelor’s
degree  in  Nigeria  in  2009.  He  stated  that  he  had  difficulty  finding  a  job  after  college
because neither he nor his family had any connections to people in the government. He
worked  for  a  construction  firm  as  a  supervisor  between  college  and  2014  when  he
immigrated to the United States. (Tr. 28)
Applicant met his U.S.-born wife in a social media dating website  in 2012. They
dated online for over a year. She visited him in Nigeria  in late 2013 or early 2014, but
returned to the United States because she missed her family. She sponsored him into
the United States, and Applicant entered  the United States  on  November 28, 2014, at
age 28. They were married in the United States in December 2014. They separated in
December 2018, because she was spending their income quicker than they could earn
it.  The  divorce  was  final  in  January  2021.  His  son,  age  four,  was  born  in  the  United
States.  He  shares  custody  of  his  son  with  his  son’s mother.  Applicant  and  his  ex-wife
have  a  friendly,  amicable  relationship.  She  testified  favorably  at  his  hearing  and
provided corroborating evidence to his prior statements and testimony. (Tr. 89-95)
Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen on June 11, 2019. He renounced his
Nigerian  citizenship  on  February  8,  2021.  He  also  relinquished  his  Nigerian  passport.
Applicant’s  parents  and  five  sisters  are  citizens  and  resident  of  Nigeria,  except  for  an
older sister who is currently residing in Scotland attending school for a master’s degree.
They all live in the house where Applicant grew up. His father, a retired yam and casaba
farmer, is 74 years old. His mother is 55 years old, and she is a retired hairdresser and
has  a  small  store  where  she  sells  hair  products.  (Tr.  53)  Another  sister  has  a  store
where she sells produce, and the remaining three sisters are attending school  and live
at home during school breaks. (Tr. 62-63) There is no evidence to show that Applicant
or any of his family members have any connection to the Nigerian government, military,
or  police.  Applicant  testified  that  he  and  his  family  are  Christians.  Applicant’s  family
members in Nigeria receive no benefits or pensions from the Nigerian government.  His
parents earn money from renting part of their home. (Tr. 86)
Since  immigrating  to  the  United  States  in  2014,  Applicant  provided  financial
assistance to his parents about four times for a total of about $300. He stated the last
time he provided financial assistance to his parents was in 2017. He traveled to Nigeria
in 2016 and 2018 to visit his family. He has frequent telephone contact with his family in
Nigeria,  but  their  conversations  are  limited  to  family  matters  and  health  related
questions.
Applicant has no property or financial interests in Nigeria, other than a small bank
account  with  about  $2.00  on  it  that  he  cannot  close.  To  close  the  account,  he  would
have  to  travel  to  Nigeria  and  obtain  a  Nigerian  identification  card,  which  he  does  not
want to do. Applicant bought a home in the United States in 2021 for $365,000. He and
his son  reside  in  their home during the weeks  he has  custody of  him. Applicant has a
$21,000 retirement account, and two bank accounts with about $5,000.
Applicant  considers  the  United  States  his  home.  He  expressed  his  undivided
loyalty to the United States. He is loyal to this country, and he is a patriotic person. He is
grateful to be here and for the opportunities the United States provides for him and his
son.  His  sisters  in  Nigeria  would  also  like  the  opportunity  to  immigrate  to  the  United
States.  He  credibly  testified  that  his  family  in  Nigeria  could  not  be  used  to  coerce  or
intimidate him into revealing classified information, and that he would report any attempt
to do so.
Applicant called four witnesses, and he submitted letters attesting to his excellent
job performance and strong moral character. He is praised for his professionalism, work
ethic, reliability, honesty, dependability, and trustworthiness. (AE 1 Tabs B-G and K-Z)

"Applicant  is  a  55-year-old  employee  who  is  seeking  to  obtain  a  security
clearance  in  conjunction  with  her  job  as  a  proposal  manager  for  a  company  doing
business in the defense industry. She is a dual citizen of the United States and Israel,
and  she  holds  passports  from  each  country.  She  was  born  in  the  United  States  and
moved  to  Israel  as  a  minor  child  with  her  parents.  She  acquired  Israel  citizenship  in
1975, at about the age of 8. She then  lived in Israel until 2014, when she came to the
United States.
Applicant  performed  military  service  in  the  Israeli  Defense  Forces  (IDF)  during
1985-1989.  She  was  trained  in  and  worked  in  the  field  of  military  intelligence.  She
attained the rank of staff sergeant. She then earned a bachelor’s degree from an Israeli
university  in  1992.  Her  employment  history  in  Israel  includes  working  for  software
companies between 1992 and 2011, as a programmer, team leader, and only later as a
product  manager,  starting  around  2008.  (Answer  to  SOR)  She  voted  in  an  Israeli
election in 2013, but has voted only in U.S. elections thereafter.
Applicant  married  for  the  first  time  in  1993  and  divorced  in  2001.  Her  first
husband  was  also  a  dual  citizen  of  the  United  States  and  Israel.  She  married  for  the
second time in 2001. They married at a location in the United States. Her husband is a
citizen of the United States, Israel, and Germany. She has three adult children and an
adult stepchild.
Applicant  and  her  husband  have  resided  together  in  the  United  States  since
2014. She described her husband as an eminent scientist who is employed by the U.S.
Government  and  a  holder  of  a  public  trust  clearance  (which  is  typically  for  a  non-
national security position). She stated that her U.S. citizenship is important to her, and
she  took  pains  to  have  her  three  children  obtain  U.S.  citizenship  through  the
naturalization process. She has sponsored her stepdaughter to obtain a green card, as
her stepdaughter intends to come to the United States and live here upon completion of
her studies in Israel. Her two sons are living with her and her husband. Her third child, a
26-year-old daughter, has chosen to reside in Israel.
Applicant  has  a  number  of  family  ties  or  connections  to  Israel.  (Exhibit  4,
Appendix A) Her daughter, sister, and brother are dual citizens of the United States and
Israel, and they reside in Israel. Her stepdaughter and sister-in-law are citizens of and
residents  in  Israel.  Her  brother-in-law  is  a  dual  citizen  of  Germany  and  Israel,  and  he
resides  in  Israel.  In  the  past  she  maintained  contact  with  a  person  with  whom  she
served with in the IDF, but she is no longer in contact with him.
Several  of  Applicant’s  family  members  have  served  in  the  IDF.  (Exhibit  4,
Appendix A) Her spouse served as an officer and aerial navigator. Her sister served as
an  intelligence  officer.  Her  brother  served  as  a  target  instructor.  Her  son  served  in
logistics. Her daughter served in operations. And her stepdaughter served as a military
reporter.
Applicant, individually or jointly with her husband, has financial interests in Israel.
(Exhibit  4,  Appendix  B)  She  noted  that  she  and  her  husband  sold  all  of  their  Israeli
securities  and  mutual  funds,  as  she  understood  doing  so  was  required  by  U.S.  law.
They  also  sold  their  former  residence  in  Israel  in  2016,  and  they  no  longer  own  real
estate in Israel. She described their current financial accounts in Israel as consisting of
a  checking  account,  two  educational  funds,  a  life  insurance  policy,  a  life  insurance
pension  fund,  and  two  provident  funds  (which  I  understand  are  long-term  savings  to
support  an  employee  upon  retirement).  She  estimated  the  U.S.  dollar  value  of  these
financial  holdings  at  about  $1  million  in  total.  Concerning  foreign-based  income,  her
husband  receives  a  pension  from  an  Israeli  university  in  the  amount  of  about  U.S.
$8,600 monthly.
In  addition  to  their  Israeli  financial  interests,  Applicant  noted  that  she  and  her
husband  own  their  U.S.  home,  which  has  an  estimated  market  value  of  more  than  $1
million. She also noted that they have more than $1.5 million in  U.S. mutual funds and
accounts. Their current net worth is approximately $3 million. (Exhibit 4 at 9)
Applicant  travels  frequently  to  Israel.  For  example,  she  made  ten  trips  to  Israel
during  November  2014  and  November  2019.  (Exhibit  4,  Appendix  C)  She  uses  her
Israeli passport to enter and depart Israel, as required by Israeli law. Likewise, she uses
her U.S. passport to enter and depart the United States, as required by U.S. law.
I have taken administrative notice of the following facts concerning the country of
Israel. (Exhibit 6) Israel is a nation in the Middle East, and it is governed by a multiparty
parliamentary  democracy. Israel  and  the  United  States have  historically  strong  bilateral
relations  and ties, including cooperation  on defense  and security  matters. With  that said,
U.S.  officials  remain   concerned   about  the   potential  for  Israeli   espionage.  The   most
notable example  is perhaps the  case  of Jonathan  Pollard,  a  former intelligence  analyst
for  the   U.S.  Government.   He  pleaded   guilty   in  1987,  as  part  of   a   plea   agreement,   to
spying   for  and   providing   top-secret   classified   information   to   Israel,  for  which  he   was
sentenced  to  life  in prison. The  current State  Department travel advisory  for Israel is do
not travel there due  to  COVID-19, and  the  advisory  warns to  exercise  increased  caution
in Israel due  to terrorism and civil unrest.
Law and Policies
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (E.O.)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of
Defense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review
Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  National  Security
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.
It  is  well-established  law  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.1  As
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side  of  denials.”2  Under  Egan,  Executive  Order  10865,  and  the  Directive,  any  doubt
about  whether  an  applicant  should  be  allowed  access  to  classified  information  will  be
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that
the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3
The   DOHA  Appeal  Board  has  followed   the   Court’s  reasoning,  and   a   judge’s
findings  of   fact  are  reviewed   under  the   substantial-evidence   standard.4  Substantial
evidence  means “evidence  that  a  reasonable  mind  could accept as adequate  to  support
a conclusion; evidence beyond a scintilla.”5 Substantial evidence is a lesser burden than
both  clear  and  convincing  evidence  and  preponderance  of  the  evidence,  the  latter  of
which  is  the  standard  applied  in  most  civil  trials.  It  is  also  a  far  lesser  burden  than
evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, the norm for criminal trials.

‘right’ to a security clearance”); Duane v. Department  of Defense, 275 F.3d  988,  994 (10th  Cir. 2002)  (no

There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access  to  classified  information.6  Under  the  Directive,  the  parties  have  the  following
burdens:  (1)  Department  Counsel  has  the  burden  of  presenting  evidence  to  establish
facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for
presenting  evidence  to  refute,  explain,  extenuate,  or  mitigate  facts  that  have  been
admitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain
a favorable clearance decision.7
Discussion
Concerning  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶  2,  the  issue  under  Guideline  B  for foreign
influence is whether Applicant’s ties and connections to Israel should disqualify her from
eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information.  Under  Guideline  B  for  foreign  influence,
the  suitability  of  an  applicant  may  be  questioned  or  put  into  doubt  due  to  foreign
contacts and interests. The overall concern is set forth in AG ¶ 6 as follows:
Foreign  contacts  and  interests,  including  but  not  limited  to  business,
financial,  and  property  interests,  are  a  national  security  concern  if  they
result in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern
if they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or
induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a
way  inconsistent  with  U.S.  interests  or  otherwise  made  vulnerable  to
pressure  or  coercion  by  any  foreign  interest.  Assessment  of  foreign
contacts  and  interests  should  consider  the  country  in  which  the  foreign
contact  or  interest  is  located,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  considerations
such  as  whether it  is known  to  target  U.S. citizens  to  obtain  classified  or
sensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism.
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise a security concern under
AG ¶ 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:
AG  ¶   7(a)  contact,  regardless  of  method,  with  a  foreign  family  member,
business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen
of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk
of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;
AG ¶  7(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country
that  create  a  potential  conflict  of  interest  between  the  individual's
obligation  to  protect  classified  or  sensitive  information  or  technology  and
the  individual's  desire  to  help  a  foreign  person,  group,  or  country  by
providing that information or technology; and
6 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).
7 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶¶ E3.1.14 and E3.1.15.
AG ¶  7(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign
country,  or  in  any  foreign-owned  or  foreign-operated  business  that  could
subject  the  individual  to  a  heightened  risk  of  foreign  influence  or
exploitation or personal conflict of interest.
The  starting  point  for  the  analysis  is  the  country  of  Israel.  The  heightened-risk
element  is  satisfied  given  the  risk  of  terrorism  in  Israel  as  well  as  concerns  about  the
potential  for  Israeli  espionage  against  the  United  States.  Israel  stands  in  contrast  to
countries that pose a low national security risk; for example, Canada, United Kingdom,
Australia,  and  New  Zealand,  all  of  which  belong  to  (with  the  United  States)  the  Five
Eyes intelligence alliance for joint cooperation in signals intelligence. Given  Applicant’s
family  ties  to  Israel  and  financial  interests  in  Israel,  the  above  disqualifying  conditions
are raised by substantial evidence.
The guideline provides that certain facts and circumstances may mitigate foreign
influence  concerns.  Given  the  evidence  here,  I  considered  the  following  mitigating
conditions:
AG ¶  8(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country
in  which  these persons  are located, or the positions or activities  of  those
persons  in  that  country  are  such  that  it  is  unlikely  the  individual  will  be
placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign
individual,  group,  organization,  or  government  and  the  interests  of  the
United States;
AG  ¶   8(b)  there   is  no   conflict  of   interest,  either  because   the   individual’s
sense   of   loyalty   or  obligation   to   the   foreign   person,   or  allegiance   to   the
group,  government,   or   country   is  so   minimal,  or  the   individual  has   such
deep   and   longstanding   relationships   and   loyalties  in  the   United   States,
that   the   individual  can   be   expected   to   resolve   any   conflict   of  interest   in
favor of the U.S. interest; and
AG ¶  8(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or
property interests  is such  that  they  are  unlikely to  result  in  a  conflict  and
could  not  be  used  effectively  to  influence,  manipulate,  or  pressure  the
individual.
Israel  presents  a  heightened  risk  and  places  a  heavy  burden  on  Applicant  to
mitigate  the  security  concern.  With  that  said,  Applicant  has  various  indicators  of  a
mature, stable, responsible, and trustworthy person. She has an employment history in
both Israel and the United States. She and her husband are both financially responsible
and successful. They have been homeowners, past and present. She appears to have
cooperated fully and provided truthful information during the security clearance process.
Her  responses  in  her  SF  86  and  her  responses  to  written  interrogatories  were
meticulous and professional.
I  have   considered   the   totality   of   Applicant’s  ties  and   connections  to   Israel.  She
was  born  in  the   United   States  and  departed   the   country   as  a   minor  child   with   her
parents. The  majority  of  her upbringing, her education, and  her adult life  were in Israel,
where she  lived  for about 40  years. She  has  lived   in the  United  States as an  adult for
less  than   ten   years. Understandably,  she   maintains ongoing   relationships  with   various
family   members   in  Israel,  including   an   adult   daughter  and   an   adult  stepdaughter.  She
travels frequently   to   Israel for vacation  as  well   as  to  maintain those   relationships.   She
along  with  her husband  have  substantial financial  interests in Israel, estimated  at about
U.S. $1  million. Their Israeli  financial interests are less than their  U.S. financial interests,
but they  are not minor or trivial  to  say  the  least.  On  balance, I cannot conclude  that her
ties and  connections  to  the  United  States are far stronger than  her  ties  and  connections
to  Israel. My  overall  assessment is  that they  are about the  same, with  Applicant having
one  foot in the United  States and  one  foot in the country of  her foreign citizenship.
Given the totality of facts and circumstances, I cannot conclude that it is unlikely
Applicant  will be  placed  in a  position of  having to  choose  between the interests of  the
United  States  and  the  interests  of  the  Israeli  government  or  her  family  members  who
have  Israeli  citizenship,  reside  in  Israel,  or  both.  I  also  cannot  conclude  there  is  no
conflict of interest within the meaning of AG ¶ 8(b). The substantial financial interests in
Israel  are  also  worrisome.  The  three  mitigating  conditions  noted  above,  in  light  of  the
evidence as a whole, do not apply to mitigate the foreign influence security concern.
Concerning   the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶  1,  the   issue   under Guideline  C for foreign
preference   is  whether   Applicant’s  actions  are  such   as  to   indicate   a   preference   for  a
foreign  country  over the  United  States.  Note,  Department  Counsel did not  address  the
foreign   preference   matters  in   the   argument  section   of  his   written   brief.   The   overall
concern is set forth in  AG ¶  9 as follows:
When   an   individual  acts  in   such   a   way   as  to   indicate   a   preference   for  a
foreign country over the United States, then  [they] may provide information
or  make   decisions  that  are  harmful  to   the   interests  of   the   United   States.
Foreign   involvement  raises  concerns   about  an   individual’s  judgment,
reliability,  and   trustworthiness  when   it  is  in  conflict  with   U.S.  national
interests or when  the  individual acts to  conceal it. By itself;  the  fact that a
U.S. citizen  is also a  citizen  of  another country is not disqualifying  without
an   objective   showing   of   such   conflict  or  attempt   at  concealment.   The
same  is true  for a  U.S.  citizen’s exercise  of any  right or privilege  of foreign
citizenship  and   any   action   to   acquire   or obtained   recognition  of   a  foreign
citizenship.
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise a security concern under
AG ¶ 10. The following are potentially applicable in this case:
AG ¶  10(a) applying for and/or acquiring citizenship in any other country;
and
AG ¶  10(d) participation in foreign activities, including but not limited to: (1)
assuming  or  attempting  to  assume  any  type  of  employment,  position,  or
political  office  in  a  foreign  government  or  military  organization;  and  (2)
otherwise  acting  to  serve  the  interests  of  a  foreign  person,  group,
organization,  or  government  in  any  way  that  conflicts  with  U.S.  national
security interests.
Of the four allegations made in SOR ¶ 1, only Applicant’s military service in the
IDF raises a concern. It falls squarely within the meaning of the disqualifying condition
at AG ¶ 10(d)(1). The remaining three SOR allegations are addressed below.
First, while it’s undisputed that Applicant acquired Israeli citizen as a native-born
citizen,  she  did  so  when  she  was  a  minor child  under the  control and  influence  of  her
parents.  It  was  a  matter  wholly  beyond  her  control.  Given  these  circumstances,  her
acquisition of Israeli citizenship cannot reasonably qualify as an intentional, deliberate,
or purposeful act on her part; she was a passive participate in the process. Accordingly,
the disqualifying condition at AG ¶ 10(a) does not apply here.
Second, Applicant’s employment history in Israel working for software companies
between  1992  and  2011,  as  a  programmer,  team  leader,  and  only  later  as  a  product
manager,  starting  around  2008,  does  not  raise  a  concern.  It  does  not  fall  within  the
meaning of AG ¶ 10(d)(1), because it was not employment with or a position in a foreign
government or military organization.
Third,  Applicant’s  voting  in  an  Israeli  election  in  about  January  2013  does  not
raise  a  concern.  Voting  in  a  foreign  election  does  not  fall  within  the  meaning  of  AG  ¶
10(d).  Note,  the  previous  August  2006  version  of  Guideline  C  specifically  included
voting in a foreign election as a disqualifying condition. But voting in a foreign election
was not included in the list of disqualifying conditions when the most recent version of
Guideline C was issued in December 2016.
The guideline provides that certain facts and circumstances may mitigate foreign
preference  concerns.  Given  the  evidence  here,  I  considered  the  following  mitigating
conditions:
AG  ¶   11(d) the exercise  of  the  rights, privileges,  or obligations or foreign
citizenship occurred before the individual because a U.S. citizen; and
AG ¶  11(g) civil employment or military service was authorized under U.S.
law, or the employment or service was otherwise consented to as required
by U.S. law.
The mitigating condition at AG  ¶  11(d)  does  not  apply  because  Applicant’s
military service in the IDF, a mandatory obligation in Israel, occurred while she was an
adult dual citizen of the United States and Israel. Likewise, there is no evidence  in the
written record to support application of AG ¶ 11(g). I also note that Applicant served in
the  IDF  for  four  years,  and  she  was  trained  and  worked  in  the  field  of  military
intelligence. She also has several family members, including her husband, her son, her
daughter, and her stepdaughter who have served in the IDF, which is probably common
for  Israeli  families  given  the  mandatory  obligation  to  perform  military  service.  Her
military  service  occurred  more  than  30  years  ago  during  1985-1989,  when  she  was  a
young  adult,  and  there  has  been  substantial  passage  of  time.  Still,  when  viewing  her
military service not in isolation but as part of the whole of this case, I cannot conclude
that Applicant has met her burden of proof to establish mitigation.
One  final  matter.  Applicant  has  argued  that  none  of  the  reasons  in  the  SOR
indicate  anything  beyond  expected  behavior  and  circumstances  of  any  person
immigrating to the United States from another country, and that she has no reason for
disloyalty to the country of her birth. (Answer to SOR) As to the first point, which is a fair
point to make, that does not mean the U.S. Government may not consider the expected
behavior  and  circumstances  of  such  a  person  when  deciding  whether  to  grant  such  a
person the privilege of a security clearance. As to the second point, it is a long-standing
rule that security clearance decisions are not a loyalty determination or test. Section 7 of
the  1960  Eisenhower  Executive  Order  (E.O.  10865)  provides  that  an  unfavorable
clearance  decision  “shall  be  a  determination  in  the  terms  of  the  national  interest  and
shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”
Following Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns
about  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  good  judgment,  and  ability  to  protect
classified  or  sensitive  information.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  I  weighed  the  evidence
as  a  whole  and  considered  if  the  favorable  evidence  outweighed  the  unfavorable
evidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that she
has not met her ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with
the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information.
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are:

"The SOR alleges that Applicant’s parents and her siblings (three sisters and three
brothers) are resident citizens of Iran (SOR ¶ 1.a) and that her three brothers had served in
the Iranian Army (SOR ¶ 1.b). Applicant admitted the allegations, but explained that her
brothers were conscripted into mandatory military service in Iran some 18, 15, and 10
years ago, respectively. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the
following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 41-year-old dual citizen of her native Iran and of the United States
since her naturalization in September 2017. She renewed her Iranian passport in June
2017 for another five years. In September 2017, she obtained her U.S. passport. She has
never married  and  has  no  children.  She has been in a cohabitant relationship with an
Iranian citizen since July 2016. Her cohabitant, who has U.S. permanent residency status
valid to July 2028, plans on applying for U.S. citizenship when he is eligible in 2023. (GE 1;
Tr. 39-40.)
Applicant earned her bachelor’s degree in Iran in July 2002. After two years of study
at  an  Iranian  university  of  science  and  technology, she  earned  her master’s degree  in
December 2004. (GE 1.) Applicant did not have to pay for her education. Top-tier Iranian
universities  are  free  to  individuals  who  meet  the  academic  entry  standards  tested  by
examination. (Tr. 29-30.)
Applicant applied to pursue a doctorate degree in Canada and the United States.
She received an offer of admission from a university in Canada first, but funding for her
doctorate  was  delayed  a  semester.  Applicant  accepted  an  offer  of  admission,  which
included funding, to a doctorate program at a private university in the United States. After
traveling to Cyprus in the summer of 2006 for a visa, she came to the United States in
September 2006. She obtained her academic documentation from the Iranian university,
which she needed for her student visa for the United States. To her knowledge, she had no
obligation to inform the Iranian government of her intention to study in the United States,
and she did not do so. (Tr. 30-32.) At the time, she intended to earn her doctorate degree,
“explore  the  world  and  see, maybe  get back to  [her] family.” (Tr. 49.) After a  couple of
years, with the situation in Iran worsening, she decided to remain in the United States and
bring her family to the United States. (Tr. 49.)
In  September  2010,  Applicant  earned  her  doctorate  degree  in  the  field  of
electromagnetics. (GE 1.) After about three months as a post-doctorate research fellow,
Applicant volunteered with her research team at the U.S. university from December 2010 to
April 2011. She then worked as a senior systems engineer for a U.S. company from June
2011 to June 2013, when she was laid off. After several months of  unemployment, she
relocated  in  February  2014  for  a  job  as  a  principal  scientist  with  a  large  U.S.  energy
company. In June 2016, she resigned from that employment and returned to her previous
locale for a new job as a system engineer in the U.S. office of a French company. In June
2019, she commenced her present employment as a senior member of the technical staff
for  a  laboratory  that  contracts  with  the  DOD.  (GE  1.)  The  laboratory  hired  Applicant
knowing that she holds dual citizenship. (Tr. 33.)
Seeking  her  first  DOD  security  clearance,  Applicant  completed  and  certified  as
accurate a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) on May 28, 2019. She
disclosed her dual citizenship; her possession of U.S. and Iranian passports; her use of her
Iranian passport to enter Iran to see family members annually  from 2012 to 2017; her
cohabitation with an Iranian citizen; her foreign travel, including that she had an upcoming
trip to Iran in June 2019 to see her family before starting her new job; her bank accounts in
Iran, which she closed in 2008; and her voting in Iran’s 2017 presidential election before
her  U.S.  naturalization.  She  listed  her  parents’  and  siblings’  Iranian  residency  and
citizenship;  her siblings’  employers  in  Iran;  and  the  frequency of  her contacts with her
family members in Iran. In response to an SF 86 inquiry concerning any sponsorship of a
foreign national in the last seven years, she commented that she wanted to sponsor her
parents and siblings for U.S. permanent residency in the future. (GE 1.)
On July 10, 2019, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the
Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM).  Applicant  indicated  that  she  was  willing  to
renounce her Iranian citizenship if required, but that she did not think it possible because
“once born in Iran you are always a citizen of Iran.” Applicant’s current U.S. passport (valid
to  September  28,  2029),  current  Iranian  passport  (valid  to  June  26,  2022),  and  two
previous Iranian passports were reviewed. Her current Iranian passport reflected trips to
Iran from March 31, 2018 to April 18, 2018; December 14, 2018 to January 1, 2019, which
was  with  her  cohabitant  (Tr.  37-38);  and  June  3,  2019  to  June  20,  2019.  Applicant
explained that she had to renew her Iranian passport to travel to Iran to see her family, and
so  she  intends  to  continue  renewing  her  Iranian  passport.  About  her  relatives  in  Iran,
Applicant clarified that her three brothers had served 18 months of mandatory service in
Iran’s  Army  but  are  no  longer  affiliated  with  a  foreign  government,  military,  security,
defense, or intelligence service. She had not experienced any requests for information or
threats from a foreign entity and had no issues when traveling to Iran. She volunteered that
she had voted in an Iranian election in June 2013, which she had forgotten about when she
completed her SF 86. (GE 2.)
On August 1, 2019, Applicant was contacted by telephone for additional information,
including about the nature of her relationship with her cohabitant; her contacts with her
family members in  Iran;  and  her reason for voting  in Iran’s election  in 2017. Applicant
described her relations with her foreign cohabitant as a domestic partnership, and she
indicated that she had informed her employer of this relationship. She explained that she is
very close to her parents and siblings in Iran. She contacted her parents weekly and her
siblings monthly to quarterly. She had notified her employer’s security department about
her foreign contacts. (GE 2.)
Salient details about Applicant’s relatives in Iran, as disclosed on her SF 86 (GE 1)
and during her hearing (Tr. 25-27, 40-48, 50-55), are reflected in the following table.

In 2019, Applicant sponsored her parents and siblings to immigrate to the United
States.  (Tr.  25.)  The  U.S.  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Service  (USCIS)  received  their
petitions on December 28, 2019. (AE A.) On May 11, 2020, the USCIS approved Brother
2’s petition. Her father’s petition was approved on November 30, 2020. (AE B.) Applicant is
awaiting notification from U.S. visa processing authorities as to when she can submit the
necessary  paperwork  for  Brother  2’s  visa.  (Tr.  25-26.)  The  process  of  review  for  her
relatives  was  delayed  because  of  COVID-19,  but  her  mother’s  petition  is under active
review. (Tr. 26.) If  her mother is approved for immigration  within the next few months,
Applicant plans to apply for visas for her parents to come to the United States together. (Tr.
26, 48.) If she does not obtain approval for her mother’s immigration by that time, Applicant
plans to apply for a visa for her father to come alone because of his elderly age. (Tr. 49.)
Applicant’s  cohabitant’s  immediate  family  (mother  and  one  brother)  are  U.S.
resident citizens. He has extended family in Iran, and they live in the same city as Sister 2.
Applicant went directly to see her parents and had no contact with any of her cohabitant’s
family when they traveled together to Iran in December 2018. He shared his time between
his extended family and her family. (Tr. 40.)
Regarding her brothers’ former military service in Iran, Applicant explained that they
had to complete that service to work, get married, and obtain a passport in Iran. (Tr. 28.)
With the exception of Sister 2, her siblings as well as her parents live in the same city in
Iran.  (GE  1.)  Applicant  usually  travels  annually  to  her  hometown  in  Iran  to  see  her
immediate family, including Sister 2 who comes from her city in Iran so they can all be
together. (Tr. 34.) Applicant has not been asked any unusual questions by Iranian officials
on her entry, during her stay, or on her exit from Iran. (Tr. 34.) Applicant traveled to Iran in
October 2020, when her mother was ill with COVID-19, and most recently in August 2021,
when her father was seriously ill with COVID-19. He was hospitalized in an intensive care
unit  for  three  weeks.  (Tr.  35-36.)  Applicant  notified  her  employer  of  her  trips  prior  to
departing and was interviewed about her trips by security personnel at work on her return.
She uses her U.S. passport whenever she enters or exits the United States. She uses her
Iranian  passport  to  enter  and  exit  Iran.  She  uses  her  U.S.  passport  when  traveling  to
countries other than Iran. (Tr. 35.) As to whether she intends to renew her Iranian passport,
which is scheduled to expire in June 2022, Applicant testified at her hearing, “I guess so.”
She further testified that she could travel to Iran on her U.S. passport but it would not be
easy to get a visa. Additionally, she testified that, instead of traveling to Iran, she might
meet her family in Turkey. She  would not need a visa on her Iranian passport but she
would need a visa on her U.S. passport to enter Turkey. (Tr. 55-57.)
Applicant considers herself to be an American. She has no ties to Iran apart from
her family. (Tr. 26.) Applicant purchased her first home in the United States in September
2016. (GE 1.) She and her cohabitant purchased their current residence in January 2021.
(Tr.  51,  59.)  Applicant  has  a  401K  and  retirement  assets  in  her  employer-sponsored
program.  (Tr.  51.)  Her  cohabitant  has  his  own  pension  plan  through  his  work  as  an
electrical engineer with a U.S. manufacturer of audio equipment. (Tr. 39, 51-52.)
Applicant’s manager has been able to find work for Applicant that does not require
access  to  classified  information.  Applicant  has  been  led  to  believe  she  will  not  be
terminated if she is not granted clearance eligibility. However, there have been programs
that could have benefitted from her expertise if she had a clearance. (Tr. 33.)
Administrative Notice
Those  facts  set  forth  in  the  Government’s  requests  for  Administrative  Notice
concerning  Iran  are  adopted  and  incorporated  in  this  decision.  In  addition,  I  have
considered the salient facts set forth in the U.S. State Department’s human rights report for
2021  concerning  Iran,  which  was  not  included  in  the  Government’s  request.  A  short
summary of relevant facts for administrative notice follows:
Iran is an authoritarian theocratic republic with a Shia Islamic political system. Shia
clergy,  most  notably the  supreme  leader Ayatollah  Ali Khamenei,  and  political leaders
vetted by the clergy, dominate key power structures in Iran. The supreme leader holds
constitutional authority over the judiciary, government-run media, and other key institutions,
including all security agencies. The United States has imposed restrictions on activities with
Iran since 1979, following the seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. Iran was designated
by the United States as a state sponsor of terrorism in 1984. In 2019, the United States
Secretary of State designated the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) as a foreign
terrorist  organization.  Iran  uses  the  IRGC  Qods  Force  to  provide  support  to  terrorist
organizations, provide cover for covert operations, and create instability in the region. In
2020, Iran supported various Iraqi Shia terrorist groups, including the  Kata’ib  Hizballah
Harakat al-Nujaba whose March 2020 rocket attack killed three members of Defeat-ISIS
Coalition  forces,  including  two  U.S.  service  members.  Through  financial  or  residency
entitlements, Iran has facilitated and coerced Shia fighters from Afghanistan and Pakistan
to participate in the Assad regime’s brutal crackdown in Syria. Iran also provided support to
Hamas and other designated Palestinian terrorist groups that were behind deadly attacks
in Gaza and the West Bank. Iran has continued to provide weapons, support, and training
to  militant  groups  in  Bahrain  and  Yemen.  In  December  2021,  the  U.S.  Navy  seized
approximately 1,400 AK-47 assault rifles and ammunition from a vessel bound from Iran to
the Houthis in Yemen.
As of April 2021, the U.S. intelligence community’s assessment was that Iran will
present a continuing threat to U.S. and allied interests in the region as it tries to erode U.S.
influence and support Shia populations abroad; entrench its influence and project power in
neighboring states; deflect international pressure; and minimize threats to regime stability.
Despite  Iran’s  deteriorating  economy  due  in  part  to  U.S.-imposed  nuclear-related
sanctions, the intelligence community expects that Iran will take risks that could escalate
tensions and threaten U.S. and allied interests.
Iran’s expertise and  willingness to  conduct aggressive  cyber operations make it a
significant threat to  the  security  of  U.S. and  allied  networks and  data. Iran  has the  ability  to
conduct attacks on  critical infrastructure and  conduct influence  and  espionage  activities.  In
February  2019, a  former U.S. counterintelligence  agent was charged  with  espionage  for
allegedly   disclosing   the   code   name   and   classified   mission   of   a   DOD  special  access
program  to  representatives of  Iran’s government.  In  September  2020,  two  Iranian  nationals
with  political motivations or acting  at the  behest of  Iran  were charged  with  a  coordinated
cyber  intrusion   campaign   in  the   theft  of   hundreds  of   terabytes  of   data   which  included
confidential communications pertaining  to  national  security,  foreign  policy  intelligence,  non-
military   nuclear  information,  aerospace   data,  and   human   rights  activist  information.  In
November 2020, the United States seized 27 domain names that Iran’s IRGC unlawfully
used  to  further a  global covert influence  campaign.  Iranian  cyber actors in  December  2020
disseminated   misinformation   about  U.S.  election   officials  in  an   attempt  to   undermine
confidence in the U.S. election.
Significant human rights issues in Iran in 2020 and 2021 included credible reports
of: unlawful or arbitrary killings, including extrajudicial killings by the government and its
agents, including executions for crimes not meeting in international legal standards for
most  serious  crimes  and
forced
disappearances by the government; torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment
or punishment by the government; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; arbitrary
arrest  and  detention;  politically  motivated  imprisonment  and  reprisals;  illegal  killings,
kidnappings, or violence; and lack of judicial independence, particularly in the revolutionary
for  crimes  committed  by  juvenile  offenders;
courts.  Iran  also  abused  the  rights of  its citizens by  unlawful interference with privacy;
serious restrictions on free expression and media, including violence or threats of violence
and  unjustified  arrests  and  prosecutions  against  journalists;  censorship  and  serious
restrictions  on  Internet  freedom;  substantial  interference  with  the  freedom  of  peaceful
assembly and freedom of association; severe restrictions on religious freedom; inability of
citizens  to  change  the  government  through  fee  and  fair  elections;  serious  and
unreasonable restrictions on political participation; serious government corruption; serious
government  restrictions  on  or  harassment  of  human  rights  organizations;  lack  of
accountability for violence against women; trafficking in persons; unlawful recruitment of
child soldiers; and violence against ethnic minorities. The Iranian government took few
steps to identify, investigate, prosecute, and punish officials who committed human rights
abuses or corruption. Impunity remained pervasive throughout all levels of government and
security forces.
The U.S. government does not have diplomatic or consular relations with Iran. In
March  2021,  U.S.  President  Biden  continued  for another year the  national emergency
declared in March 1995 with respect to Iran as the country continues to pose an unusual
and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United
States. The U.S. State Department currently warns against any travel to Iran due to the risk
of kidnapping and the arbitrary arrest and detention of U.S. citizens. Iranian authorities
continue to unjustly detain and imprison U.S. citizens, particularly dual national Iranian-
Americans, including students, journalists, business travelers, and academics, on spurious
charges including espionage and posing a threat to national security. Iranian authorities
routinely delay consular access to detained U.S. citizens and consistently deny consular
access to dual U.S.-Iranian citizens.

"The  SOR  alleged  Applicant’s  mother  is  a  resident  and  citizen  of  the  PRC,  that
she served in the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) from 1981 to 1983 as a colonel, and
that she is still employed by the PLA as a doctor. The SOR also alleged that her father
is a resident and citizen of the PRC. The SOR further alleged that one unnamed friend
is  a  resident  and  citizen  of  the  PRC  and  that  six  unnamed  friends  are  citizens  of  the
PRC. (SOR)
In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, she admitted SOR allegation SOR ¶ 1.b. She
denied the allegations in  SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.c, and 1.d. Her admission is incorporated into
the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits
submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  33   years  old.   She   was  born  in  the   PRC   in  1988.  She   went  to   high
school  and  college  in  the  PRC, but  she  attended  graduate  school in  the  United  States.
She  relocated  to  the  United  States upon  her undergraduate  college  graduation  in 2011.
She   received   her  master’s  degree   in  engineering   in  2013.  She   became   a   naturalized
U.S.  citizen   in   2016.   She   has   worked   for  her  government-contractor  employer  since
2017. She is single,  never married. (Tr. 36; GE 1-2)
Applicant  served  in the  U.S. Army  for approximately  nine  months  from  2015  and
into   2016,   before   she   was  discharged   and   medically   retired   for  having   a   medical
condition   that  was  incompatible   with   further   military   service.   She   was  diagnosed   with
paranoid schizophrenia. She currently receives treatment for this condition in  the  form of
monthly   therapy   sessions  with   a   psychologist  and   quarterly   appointments  with   a
psychiatrist.   She   is   prescribed   Aripiprazole  for  her  condition.   (this   condition   was  not
alleged  in the  SOR  as  a  Guideline  I, psychological conditions concern, and  I therefore
will   not  consider   this  evidence   for  disqualification   purposes,  but   I   may   consider  it   as   it
relates to  Applicant’s credibility, the applicability of any mitigating conditions, and as part
of   a   whole-person   assessment).   Applicant   receives  both   a   disability   pension   and
medical care from  the  Department  of  Veterans Affairs (VA). (Tr. 36-37, 61-63; AE  A, K,
pp. 2, 3 of  211)
Applicant’s mother is 58 years old and is a resident and citizen of the PRC. From
1981 to 2006, she served as an attending physician in the civilian cadre of the PLA. She
achieved the rank of a colonel-equivalent. She retired from that position and receives a
government pension. She continues to work at a PLA hospital. Applicant has video chat
contact with her mother at least once a week. Her parents sent her at least $50,000 to
help her make a down payment on her U.S. home. (Tr. 39, 45-46, 50-51, 66-67; GE 1-2;
AE J)
Applicant’s  father  is  58  years  old  and  is  a  resident  and  citizen  of  the  PRC.  He
works in an administrative role for a government-owned airline. He plans to retire from
his  position  in  approximately  two  and  a  half  years.  When  he  retires  he  will  receive  a
government  pension.  Applicant  has  video  chat  contact  with  her  father  at  least  once  a
week. Once her father retires, Applicant’s parent’s intent is to move to the United States
to live with Applicant. (Tr. 48-51, 66-67; GE 1-2)
Department   Counsel   acknowledged   that   the   gravamen   of   this  case   was
Applicant’s  relationship   with   her  parents   who   live   in  the   PRC,  not  with   the   seven
unnamed  friends alleged in the SOR. Applicant testified that she had lost contact with all
her friends years ago.  She  only  has  once-a-year contact  with  a  cousin.  Based  upon  the
lack  of   specificity   regarding   the   friends  in   question,   and   the   paucity   of   evidence
regarding  Applicant’s contact with  these  friends, I  find  for Applicant on  SOR ¶¶  1.c and
1.d.  (Tr. 14, 40, 53)
Applicant  wanted   to   come   to   the   United   States  as  a   young   child.  Her  father
shared   in  her  dream   to   immigrate   to   the   United   States.  She   believes  the   PRC   is  a
corrupt  government   that  prevents  freedom   of  speech.  The   reason   she   enlisted   in   the
Army  in 2015, even  though  she  held  a  master’s degree  in  engineering,  is because  she
was  told  by   a   friend   that   enlisting   could   lead   to   earlier  citizenship   for   her   through   the
Military   Accessions  Vital  to   the   National  Interest   (MAVNI)  program.  (MAVNI  allows
certain  non-citizens  to   join   the   U.S.  military   and   apply   for  immediate   citizenship.   See
stilt.com/blog/2021/06/mavni-program/)  She  used  this  program to  gain early  citizenship.
She  also wanted to become a  doctor. (Tr. 36-38, 41)
Applicant  owns  a  home  outright  in  the  United  States  that  is  valued  at
approximately  $450,000.  She  has  cash
the  amount  of
approximately  $100,000.  Her  retirement  account  contains  approximately  $36,000.  Her
current  salary  is  approximately  $107,000.  Her  VA  disability  payment  is  approximately
$3,000 monthly. Since coming to the United States, she has traveled back to the PRC
only  once  in  2018  to  visit  family.  She  has  no  intentions  to  return  to  the  PRC  in  the
future. Applicant  owns no  property in  the  PRC.  She  is involved  in  her community.  (Tr.
38, 40, 54-55, 57-59; AE B-E, G)
in  bank  accounts
in
Applicant presented the testimony of a coworker who has known Applicant since
2017.  In addition to  knowing her through  work, she has  socialized  with  Applicant on a
few occasions. She believes Applicant is straight forward and friendly. She also believes
Applicant is a hard worker and a good employee. She believes Applicant is trustworthy
and would place the interests of the United States above any other interests. Applicant
also presented 11 awards she received from her employer for being a key contributor to
the mission. (Tr. 30-34; AE F)
People’s Republic of China
The  PRC  has  an  authoritarian  government,  dominated  by  the  Chinese
Communist Party. The PRC has a poor record with respect to human rights, suppresses
political  dissent,  and  its  practices  include  arbitrary  arrest  and  detention,  forced
confessions,
torture,  and  mistreatment  of  prisoners.  Repression  and  coercion,
particularly against organizations and individuals involved in rights advocacy and public
interest issues, are routine. (HE III)
Along with Russia, the PRC is the most aggressive country in targeting sensitive
and protected U.S. technology, and economic intelligence. It has targeted the U.S. with
active intelligence gathering programs, both legal and illegal. In China, authorities have
monitored  telephone  conversations,  facsimile  transmissions,  e-mail,  text  messaging,
and  internet  communications.  Authorities  opened  and  censored  mail.  The  security
services  routinely  monitored  and  entered  residences  and  offices  to  gain  access  to
computers,  telephones,  and  fax  machines.  All  major  hotels  had  a  sizable  internal
security  presence,  and  hotel  guestrooms  were  sometimes  bugged  and  searched  for
sensitive or proprietary materials. (HE III)
As recently  as July  2020, PRC  consulate  employees helped  PLA  officers evade
and  obstruct U.S. law  enforcement activities to  conceal  their  military  affiliations. Multiple
U.S. criminal indictments since  2015  involve  PRC  nationals, naturalized  U.S. citizens, or
permanent   resident  aliens  from   the   PRC,  and   U.S.   citizens,  procuring   and   exporting
controlled items to China. (HE III)

"Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a through 1.d, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.i. She denied
SOR  allegations  1.e,  1.h,  1.j,  and  1.k  with  explanations.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 41 years old and married with two children. She received a doctorate
degree in 2008. She is applying for national security eligibility and a security clearance
in connection with her employment with a defense contractor as a senior executive and
facility  security  officer  (FSO).  (Government  Exhibit  1  at  Sections  12,  13A,  17,  and  18;
Tr. One at 45-47.)
Paragraph 1  –  Guideline B (Foreign Influence)
SOR allegations 1.a, and 1.b concern Applicant’s relatives who are dual citizens
of Taiwan and Canada.
Applicant is a native-born American citizen. Her family lived in the United States,
Canada, and Taiwan when she was young. She returned to the United States in 1998 to
attend  college.  She  has  lived  in  the  United  States  ever  since.  Applicant’s  husband  is
also a native-born American citizen. They were married in 2012 and have two U.S.-born
children. (Tr. One at 60.)
Applicant’s mother  and father are citizens of Taiwan and Canada, and reside in
Taiwan.  Neither  of  her  parents  have  any  connection  to  the  Taiwanese  or  Chinese
governments. Canadian influence was not alleged as a concern. (Tr. One at 60, 62.)
Applicant  has  been  estranged  from  her  mother  for  many  years.  The  reason  is
unknown, but appears to center around her choice of husband, who is not Taiwanese.
She  stated, “My mother, the  relationship is pretty much  non-existent from  her side. It’s
very binary. After I got married, she stopped talking to me pretty much unless she has to
because there are other people there.”  Applicant last saw her mother in 2018 in Taiwan
in connection with her brother’s wedding. (Tr. One 62-65, 67-68.)
Applicant’s father runs a company with his brothers. Applicant has no ownership
interest  in  the  company  and  cannot  inherit  any  interest  in  it  because  she  is a  woman.
The  factory  does  no  business  with  the  Taiwanese  or  Chinese  governments.  She  has
never received any financial benefit from the company. (Tr. One at 60-61.)
With   regard  to   her  relationship  with   her  father,   Applicant  testified   that  it  was
growing  more distant  over the  years. She  stated, “And,  then,  with  my  father, it’s  better.
We  still  talk to  each  other on  the  phone.  It  was more frequent when  I was in school.  It
was  pretty   much   weekly.  Now,  it’s not  so   much.  My   life   is busy,  his life   is busy.  So,  if
we’re  lucky, maybe  every  other week,   we  call   and   chitchat.”  She  last saw  her father in
2019 in  her state  of residence  when he was there on a  business trip. (Tr. One at 63-65.)
Applicant has two brothers. Her older brother was born in the United States and
resides here. He submitted a statement in support of his sister. However, he admits in
that  statement,  “Over  the  years,  my  relationship  with  [Applicant]  has  become  distant.”
(Applicant Exhibit G.)
Her  other brother  is  a  citizen  of  Taiwan  and  Canada.  He  is  a  Permanent  Legal
Resident of  the  United States and  has  resided  in  the  United  States  for over 20  years.
Applicant  has  little  contact  with  this  brother,  which  he  confirmed  in  his  testimony.  Her
brother  stated  that  the  relationship  is  “cordial,”  and  that  he  last  saw  her  in  2018.
Applicant  believes  that  her  fraught  relationship  with  her  mother  is  the  cause  of  the
distant relationship with both of her brothers. (Tr. One at 23-36, 65-67.)
SOR  allegation   1.c   concerns  Applicant’s  alleged   relationship  with   a   Taiwanese
citizen/resident.   In   her  e-QIP   Applicant  disclosed   quarterly   contact   with   a   Taiwanese
doctor.  This doctor had  provided  medical care to   Applicant’s   spouse  for several years.
In   addition,  this  person   introduced   Applicant  and   her  spouse   to   a   Taiwanese   builder
who  helped  them  buy  some  property  and   construct a  building, further described  under
SOR allegation  1.d, below. Applicant stated  that the  relationship is cordial but not close.
Applicant’s spouse  confirmed  that  the  relationship  is related  primarily  to  his  health  care,
and  the  property  located  in  Taiwan. (Government Exhibit 1  at Section  19;  Tr. One  at  69-
71; Tr. Two  at 46-47, 52-53.)
SOR  allegations  1.d  through  1.k  involve  Applicant’s  husband’s  foreign  financial
connections. Several general statements are  applicable  to these particular allegations.
First, Applicant and her spouse confirmed that she has no ownership interest in any of
the  foreign  financial  accounts  and  investments  of  her  husband.  Out  of  a  surplus  of
caution, Applicant reported these accounts on her e-QIP, even though the accounts are
not in her name and she has no ownership interest in them.  Second, these investment
vehicles and bank accounts  are used  by Applicant’s spouse  to  diversify his portfolio, a
common investment strategy. As further described below, with the exception of a small
bank account in China, all of his foreign bank accounts and other financial interests are
in  nations  that  are  friendly to  the  United  States,  or  allies  of  the  United  States.  Finally,
Applicant’s spouse  has consistently  reported  to  the  Federal  Government  the  existence
of his foreign bank accounts and the amounts in them. (Answer at page 5; Government
Exhibit 1 at Section 20A, Government Exhibit 2; Applicant Exhibit H; Tr. One at 77; Tr.
Two at 54, 58-62.)
As  stated,  Applicant  has  been  employed  by  her  husband’s  closely-held
corporation (The Company) since their marriage in 2012. She has no ownership interest
in  The  Company.  Applicant’s  husband  is  a  very  successful  scientist  and  entrepreneur
who began The Company in 1998. His net worth in the United States is between 35 and
40  million  dollars.  He  supplied  extensive  documentary  evidence  to  support  that
statement. (Applicant Exhibit J; Tr. One at 44-47; Tr. Two at 63-66.)
With that background, we move to a discussion of the specific allegations.
1.d. Applicant’s  spouse  purchased   property  in Taiwan.  He  subsequently  built  on
that  location   with   an   expectation   of  creating   some   kind   of   hospitality   business.  Those
plans have  not come  to  fruition. The  building   is vacant and  Applicant’s spouse  has no
current  plans  to   finish   the   building   or  have   it  occupied.  He   believes  the   property   and
building   to   be   worth   approximately   $1,000,000.   He  owes  about  $400,000   on   the
property. This property  is part of his  diversification  investment  strategy.  (Tr. One  at  71-
76; Tr. Two at 46-50.)
With  regard  to  the  specific  bank  accounts  described  below,  the  figures  in  them
are derived from the most recent Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts reports (FBAR),
which  are  for  2020.  The  FBARs  also  confirm  that  Applicant’s  spouse  is  the  individual
account holder on all of them. Finally, a review of the FBARs reveals that the accounts
are  static  holdings.  In  other  words,  there  has  been  no  appreciable  increase  in  the
amounts held in the various bank accounts. (Applicant Exhibit H.)
1.e. Applicant’s spouse has two bank accounts in Foreign Country (FC) A. Their
combined value in 2020 was $713,278. (Applicant Exhibit H at 70-71.)
1.f. Applicant’s spouse has one bank account in FC B. The value of this account
in 2020 was $495,127. (Applicant Exhibit H at 70; Tr. Two at 56.)
1.g.  Applicant’s spouse has one bank account in FC C. The value of this account
in 2020 was $387. (Applicant Exhibit H at 70; Tr. Two at 56.)
1.h. Applicant’s spouse has one bank account in FC D. The value of this account
in 2020 was $6,915. (Applicant Exhibit H at 69; Tr. Two at 56-57.)
1.i. Applicant’s spouse  has three  bank accounts in Taiwan. One of them has no
money,  according  to  the  2020  FBAR.  The  other  two  have  a  combined  value  of
$115,893. (Applicant Exhibit H at 69, 71; Tr. Two at 53-54.)
1.j. Applicant’s spouse has one bank account in China. The value of this account
in 2020 was $77. (Applicant Exhibit H at 69; Tr. 57-58.)
The  total  value  of  Applicant’s  spouse’s  foreign  bank  accounts  is  $1,331,677.
When  one  includes  the  property  and  building,  his  foreign  holdings  amount  to  about
$2,000,000.  This  figure  is  approximately  7%  of  his  stateside  net  worth,  which  is
estimated between 35 and 40 million dollars.
1.k. Applicant’s spouse established a company in Taiwan  in approximately 2014.
This company has no assets and does no business. Applicant’s spouse established the
company  with  the  hope  that  it  might  improve  relations  with  his  in-laws.  It  did  not
succeed and has no current value. (Tr. One at 75-76; Tr. Two at 43-46, 68-71.)
Applicant  stated   that   she   does  not  rely   on   any   of   the   foreign   accounts  or
investments   to   cover  their   daily   living,  personal   or  family   expenses.   These   foreign
accounts “don’t  affect  our day  to  day  life.” In  addition, she  stated  that she  does not  own
any   real  property   or  other  assets  outside   the   United   States.  She   has  personal  bank
accounts in the United  States with a value of approximately $75,000.  (Tr. One  at 78-79.)
Mitigation
Applicant submitted a written statement from a counterintelligence (CI) agent for
the  Defense  Counterintelligence  and  Security  Service.  He  has  worked  with  the
Applicant since 2017 in her role as FSO of The Company. (Tr. One at 58-59.)
The CI agent stated in Applicant Exhibit F:
[Applicant]   has been   my   primary   point   of   contact  when   I  need   to   provide
CI  information   to   [The   Company].   As  an   FSO,   [Applicant]  has  been   very
open  and  easy  to  work  with, and  under her stewardship,  her company  has
consistently   reported   more  suspicious   incidents  than   any   other  company
in  [the   state   where  The   Corporation   is located].  The   information   reported
has  been   valuable  to   the   Intelligence   Community.  .  ..   I  can   always   count
on [Applicant] to be proactive and do the right thing.
His statement goes on:
Especially   given   my   position,  I  appreciate   and   respect  the   seriousness
and   gravity   of  the   security   clearance   application   process.  While   my
interaction   with   [Applicant]   has  been   limited   as  described   above,  it   is  my
opinion  [Applicant]  has  been  open  and  honest in her interactions  with  me.
[Applicant]   has  been   proactive   in  ensuring   her  company   is  reporting   a
wide  variety of  suspicious incidents.  I often  use  [Applicant]  as an  example
of  the  importance  of the  FSO  in identifying  suspicious incidents when  I am
working  with other companies.
Applicant  testified  that  she  would  contact  the  CI  Agent  if  there  were  any
questions or concerns about foreign contacts. She has taken classes as FSO on items
to be aware of in the counterintelligence area. (Tr. 79-80, 87.)
A   former  supervisor  of   Applicant  testified   and   supplied   a   written   statement.   He
worked   with   Applicant  before  her  marriage.  He  described   Applicant’s  work  as,
“exceptional, very  thorough, very  well  organized  and  thought out.” The  witness went on
to  describe  her character as, “Unquestionable from my  perspective. I trust her implicitly.
She   is  very   honest,   very   straightforward.  Never  a   questionable  moment  in  our
interaction.  I   certainly   have   a   high   regard  for  her  character.”   (Applicant  Exhibit  D;   Tr.
One  at 48-52.)
Taiwan
Applicant  has  contacts  with  Taiwan.  Accordingly,  it  is  appropriate  to  look  at  the
current  situation  concerning  Taiwan.  Taiwan  is  a  multiparty  democracy  whose
authorities  generally  respect  the  human  rights  of  its  citizens.  Taiwan  is  an  active
collector of industrial information and engages in industrial espionage, as shown by the
administrative  notice  documents  in  the  record.  However,  the  record  does  not
demonstrate that the Taiwanese government seeks to exert pressure on U.S. citizens to
collect information from family members residing in country or abroad. Finally, it is worth
noting  that  the  U.S.  Government,  and  the  Defense  Department  in  particular,  have  a
close  and  continuing  relationship  with  Taiwan  and  its  military,  in  accordance  with  the
Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, which has governed policy in the absence of diplomatic
relations or a defense treaty with Taiwan. In 2018 the Secretary of Defense stated, “The
Department  of  Defense  remains  steadfastly  committed  to  working  with  Taiwan  to
provide the defense articles and services necessary to maintain sufficient self-defense
consistent  with  our  obligation  set  out  in  our  Taiwan  Relations  Act.  We  oppose  all
unilateral  efforts  to  alter  the  status  quo,  and  will  continue  to  insist  any  resolution  of
differences  accord  with  the  will  of  the  people  on  both  sides  of  the  Taiwan  Strait.”
(Department  of  Defense,  Remarks  by  Secretary  Mattis  at  Plenary  Session  of  the
2018  Shangri-La  Dialogue,  https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Transcripts/Transcript/

China
I  take  administrative  notice  of  the  facts  set  forth  in  the  Administrative  Notice
documents  concerning  China,  which  are  incorporated  herein  by  reference.  China  is  a
large and economically powerful country, with a population of more than a billion people
and  an  economy  growing  at  about  10%  per  year.  China  has  an  authoritarian
government,  dominated  by  the  Chinese  Communist  Party.  It  has  a  poor  record  with
respect  to human  rights,  suppresses  political dissent,  and  engages  in  arbitrary arrests
and detentions, forced confessions, torture, and mistreatment of prisoners. China is one
of  the  most  aggressive  countries  in  seeking  sensitive  and  protected  U.S.  technology
and economic intelligence. It targets the United States with active intelligence gathering
programs,  both  legal  and  illegal.  As  a  result,  it  is  a  growing  threat  to  U.S.  national
security. In addition, China views Taiwan as part of China. China has engaged in many
different  coercive  diplomatic  and  military  activities,  seeking  to  isolate  and  intimidate
Taiwan into unification on China’s terms.
",True
"Applicant is 50 years old. He was born in Jordan. He came to the United States on
a tourist visa in 1990. He became a naturalized citizen in 2000. In 1992, he married his
former wife. She is a U.S. citizen. They divorced in 2002. He has three adult children from
the  marriage.  He  has  owned  a  home  since  coming  to  the  United  States.  He  attended
colleges in the United States and earned an associate’s degree.  (GE 1)
Applicant was employed as a linguist for federal contractors at various times from
June 2003 to May 2010. He worked in combat areas in the Middle East more than once.
His  last  assignment  ended  in  May  2010.  After  returning  to  the  United  States,  he  was
unemployed until August 2012, when he started a business in auto sales and repairs. (Tr.
33-36,  123) He  maintained  that  business  until  May  2017,  when  he  closed  it  to  pursue
another  linguist  position  with  a  federal  contractor.  He  is  currently  being  sponsored  for
national security eligibility by that contractor. (Tr. 42-42; GE 2 at 6) He worked for [Name
of  Government  Agency  redacted  due  to  privacy  reasons.]  from  September  2018  to
January 2019. (Tr. 98)
Guideline B:  Foreign Influence
In  his  November  18,  2020  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  in  part  and
denied in part the allegations in SOR ¶ 1.a. He stated that his father was deceased, his
mother  is  a  U.S.  permanent  resident,  and  his  brother  is  a  dual  citizen  of  Jordan  and
Germany, and resides in Germany. He said one of his sisters is married and lives in Qatar.
In response to the allegation in SOR ¶ 1.b, he said one sister resides in the United Arab
Emirates (UAE).
Applicant’s father was born in Jordan. He is deceased. He was a school teacher
in  Jordan. His mother was  born  in  Jordan. She  is a U.S. permanent  resident, but now
resides in Jordan. Sometimes he communicates with her every other day and sometimes
not for a couple months. He uses social media and the telephone to contact her. The last
time he saw his mother was in November 2017, when he flew to Jordan for his father’s
funeral. He stayed there about a month. He has no plans to return. (Tr. 44-46; GE 1)
Applicant has two brothers. Both were born in Jordan. His brother R resides in the
United States. He is married to a U.S. citizen. He thinks R may be a U.S. citizen now. His
other brother F married a German woman and now resides in Germany. The last time he
had contact with F was when they attended his father’s funeral in 2017. (Tr. 47-48; GE 1)
Applicant has two sisters. Both were born in Jordan. His sister RE is a Jordanian
citizen and resident. She is a hair stylist. Sometimes he speaks to RE if she is visiting his
mother when he calls. He spoke to her about three weeks before his hearing. (Tr. 51-51)
Applicant’s sister RA is a  Jordanian  citizen  and  resident.  She previously resided in the
UAE, but now lives with their mother in Jordan and takes care of her. She worked in a
school system in the UAE. He communicates with her by email and speaks to her when
he calls his mother. She would like to obtain a visa to visit him in the United States. He
stayed with her in the UAE when he visited  periodically. He does not provide financial
support to any family member residing in  Jordan.  (Tr. 49-54) He  stayed  at his  father’s
house  with  his  mother  and  the  brother  from  the  United  States  when  he  visited  for  his
father’s funeral. (Tr. 56) Applicant reported that between 2002 and 2017, he frequently
visited his family in Jordan and his sister RA in the UAE. (Ex. 3)
I take administrative notice of the facts about Jordan that are set forth on pages 2
through 4 of GE 4, which are drawn from official U.S. Government publications. These
include that Jordan is a constitutional monarchy ruled by King Abdullah II bin Hussein,
who appoints members of their House of Representatives and Senate. Jordan continues
to  encounter  terrorism  due  to  its  borders’  proximity  to  Lebanon  and  Syria,  where
numerous  groups  have  conducted  attacks  into  it.  Jordan’s  participation  in  the  global
coalition to defeat ISIS increases its potential for terrorist incidents. Certain regions in the
country hold anti-Western sentiments and  protest the  United  States’ policies on  Israel.
Significant human rights violations are prevalent in the country, many of which are not
prosecuted.  In  April  2021,  the  U.S.  State  Department  issued  travel  advisories  due  to
COVID and the presence of crime in tourist or crowded areas.
Applicant’s sister RA no longer lives in the UAE; hence, SOR ¶ 1.b concerns are
mitigated with respect to that country. It is unnecessary to take administrative notice of
facts pertinent to the UAE.
Guideline E:  Personal Conduct
Throughout  this  investigation,  Applicant  asserted  that  he  had  been  unofficially
working  with  [another  U.S.  government  agency]  through  someone  he  came  in  contact
with in 2015, and will be referred to as [Mr.] N. He claims he started that relationship after
his brother F (who now resides in Germany), related information to him about issues in
the Middle East that Applicant thought would be of interest to the [U.S. agency]. (Tr. 65,
71-72)
Applicant admits that between July 2016 and January 2017, he had a relationship
with [a woman], a Russian citizen, whom he met in [redacted] while he was on vacation.
They were staying at the same hotel. He was on his way to see his sister RA in the UAE,
when his flight had a 24-hour layover. He stayed with RA a few times over the next several
months as he traveled between Amman, Jordan, and the United States. He spent time
with  [the  woman  who  is  a  Russian  citizen]  over  those  months.  In  January  2017,  [the
woman  who  is a  Russian  citizen]  flew to  the United  States and  stayed  with  him  at  his
home. Months later she obtained a position with a U.S. university. (Tr. 58-62)
Applicant explained that [the woman who is a Russian citizen] worked for a U.S.
company in Russia on a project at a Russian academy. She has advanced degrees in
science. She was a “person of interest” to Applicant. (Answer) He told [Mr.] N about [the
woman who is a Russian citizen] after meeting her. He said that [Mr.] N became interested
in [the woman who is a Russian citizen] and the “scientists she works with in Russia.” (Tr.
103; AE E) Applicant said [the woman who is a Russian citizen] bragged about her work
in Russia. (Tr. 61) Applicant admitted that he had an intimate relationship with [the woman
who is a Russian citizen]. However, he considered her a “subject” from whom to gather
information for [Mr.] N. (Tr. 68)
Applicant’s last communication with [the woman who is a Russian citizen] was in
January 2017, when she visited him in the United States. (Tr. 58-62,102; GE 2 at 13) He
said that while she was staying with him, he broke into her email without her authorization
and  forwarded  some  emails  to  [Mr.]  N.  He  claimed  he  took  pictures  of  some  of  her
information and sent it to [Mr.] N. (Tr. 90)
In his November 18, 2020 Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted that he had a
relationship with [the woman who is a Russian citizen], as alleged in SOR ¶ 2.a. He denied
that he intentionally withheld information about it to the government, as alleged in ¶ 2.b,
and stated he did not report it because he did  not have  a  “continuing” relationship with
[the woman who is a Russian citizen]. (Tr. 104) He admitted that during his June 2017
interview he failed to disclose to an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator
that  he  had  made  lasting  contacts  with  a  non-U.S.  citizen  while  traveling  out  of  the
country, as alleged in ¶ 2.c. He said he was precluded from disclosing it because he was
working with a [redacted], who told him not to share that information.
Applicant  testified  that  the  OPM  investigator  became  aware  of  Applicant’s
relationship  with  [the  woman  who  is  a  Russian  citizen]  because  a  friend,  with  whom
Applicant had worked in 2003, stole his iPad and subsequently informed the OPM of the
matter. He was upset that his friend told the OPM investigator about his Russian girlfriend.
(Tr. 76-80)
When asked by an OPM investigator during his second background interview in
July 2017, why he did not disclose information about [the woman who is a Russian citizen]
in his security forms, Applicant said he initially disclosed her name to a U.S. Embassy in
the Middle East in July 2016. He said he also met with a second U.S. government agency
in a large city and was told not to disclose his relationship with anyone else, including in
his security clearance forms. (GE 2 at 13)
Applicant  submitted  exhibits  of  emails  to  and  from  [Mr.]  N  as  proof  of  his
relationship with [Mr.] N. (AE B) He did not present evidence from [Mr.] N or the second
U.S. government agency with whom he allegedly he met to corroborate his claims that he
was instructed not to disclose his contacts with [the woman who is a Russian citizen]. He
maintained that his briefings and communications with [Mr. N] were obvious proof of the
relationship. (Tr. 87-88)
Although  [the  woman]  is  a  Russian  citizen,  I  find  that  the  specific  identity  and
characteristics of the foreign country involved in this case are not relevant to evaluating
Applicant’s intentional concealment of their relationship. I find that his intense interest in
working with a U.S. [redacted] agency was his motivation for deceiving the government.
Hence, the information in the Administrative Notice Request for The Federation of Russia
(GE 6) is not material to resolving the Guideline E security allegations.
Guideline J:  Criminal Conduct
Applicant  admitted  the  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  3.a,  pertinent  to  his  2019  criminal
conviction. (AE F)
In May 2014, Applicant became embroiled in a violent physical altercation with his
daughter and  her boyfriend  at his daughter’s apartment.  Applicant said his ex-wife told
him  that  the  boyfriend  was  dangerous  and was  involved  in  drugs.  During  the  fight,  he
seriously injured the boyfriend. At some point Applicant left the apartment. Subsequently,
a warrant for his arrest was issued. (Answer) Applicant denied that he was the aggressor
in the fight, despite multiple witnesses’ statements. (Tr. 95)
Applicant said he did not know about the warrant until January 2019, when he was
stopped by the police for a traffic violation. At that time, he had been working for the TSA
since September 2018. He was subsequently fired by the agency. (Tr. 95-97; Answer)
On October 22, 2019, Applicant was convicted by a jury of three felony counts of
aggravated assault in connection with  the  May 2014 incident.  On January 9,  2020, he
was sentenced to 120 days of incarceration and four years of supervised probation. He
was ordered to complete 100 hours of community service, pay restitution, and complete
anger management counseling. He was also ordered not to have contact with his ex-wife,
his  daughter,  or  her  boyfriend.  (Tr.  101;  GE  7)  He  remains  on  probation  until  2023  or
2024, according to the court order. (GE 7) He asserted in his closing argument that he
completed the anger management course and community hours. (Tr. 168)
Applicant  submitted  letters  of  recommendation,  awards,  and  certificates  of
appreciation that he has received over the years. Several people with whom Applicant
worked while he was a linguist in the 2000’s commented on his strengths and abilities.
(AE G)
",False
"The  SOR alleges under Guideline  B  that  Applicant’s  parents-in-law, five  sisters-in-
law, and  four brothers-in-law  are resident citizens of China  (SOR  ¶  1.a). The  SOR also
alleges  that   of   his  sisters-in-law   with   citizenship  and   residency   in  China,   one   had
previously   worked   as  a   radar  engineer  with   a   missile  institute   in  China   (SOR  ¶   1.b);
another is employed  as a  software engineer for the  Chinese  government (SOR  ¶  1.c),
and  a third is employed as a civil servant for a  forestry bureau in China (SOR ¶  1.d).
When Applicant responded to the SOR, he admitted  the Chinese residency and
citizenships of his spouse’s family members and the alleged employment information for
the  three  sister-in-laws  (SOR  ¶¶  1.b  through  1.d).  Yet,  he  explained  that  his  spouse’s
relatives all speak only Mandarin so his spouse has to translate for him. Consequently,
his conversations with her family members are “brief and infrequent.”
After  considering  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  transcript,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant is a 34-year-old senior systems engineer. He, his parents, and his two
siblings (an older sister and a younger brother) are all native U.S. resident citizens. (GEs
1, 3.) Applicant earned a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering in May 2009 and a
master’s degree in electrical and computer engineering in May 2011. While Applicant was
an  undergraduate,  he  worked  as  an  intern  in  the  semiconductor  industry  during  the
summers  of  2006,  2007,  and  2008.  He  did  not  hold  a  DOD  security  clearance  during
those times. (GEs 1, 3; AE H.)
On  earning  his  bachelor’s  degree,  Applicant  worked  as  an  intern  for  a  defense
contractor (company X) in the summer of 2009. That fall, he started his graduate studies,
and  the  following  summer  again  worked  for  the  company  as  an  intern.  In  early  2011,
Applicant and his future  spouse were introduced to each other by a mutual friend.  (Tr.
45.)  A native citizen of China (GE 3; Tr. 39), she was pursuing her master’s degree in
statistics at the same university as Applicant. (Tr. 44, 50.) She began her studies in 2010.
(Tr. 44.) Applicant and his spouse began dating in May 2011. (Tr. 46.)
Applicant  became a  full-time  employee  of  company  X  in  June 2011.  On  July 7,
2011, Applicant completed and certified as accurate a Questionnaire for National Security
Positions (SF 86) for a security clearance for company X, having no prior experience with
the form. (Tr. 55.) He responded negatively to an SF 86 inquiry concerning whether he
had any close or continuing contact with any foreign nationals within the last seven years.
(GE 1.) He was dating his spouse, then a Chinese national, but it did not occur to him to
report her as a foreign contact. He does not now recall the specifics of any training that
he had to take while at company X, including any about reporting foreign contacts. (Tr.
56.) Applicant was granted a DOD secret clearance in August 2011. (GE 3.) The majority
of his work for company X from June 2011 to December 2015 was unclassified. (Tr. 13,
32.)
Applicant and his spouse traveled together to China on July 24, 2012. She wanted
him to meet her parents and other members of her immediate family. Applicant returned
from China on August 10, 2012, while his spouse stayed in China for two months. (Tr.
46.) Applicant did not report his trip to China to company X because he did not then know
that it was required. (Tr. 57.)
Applicant and his spouse married in the United States in August 2015. (GE 3.) Her
parents, two sisters, and one brother came from China for the wedding. (Tr. 51.) Applicant
did not report his marriage to a Chinese citizen to company X because he did not realize
that it  was  required. Some of  his co-workers at  company X attended  the wedding  and
voiced no concern to Applicant about his spouse having family in China. (Tr. 63.)
Applicant  traveled  to  China  with  his  spouse  in  mid-May  2016  for  her  cousin’s
wedding. Applicant stayed in China for two weeks. He visited with his parents-in-law and
other  members  of  his  spouse’s  family  during  that  time.  (Tr.  46-47.)  Applicant  told  his
immediate manager that he was going to China as he had to obtain his approval for leave.
(Tr. 63.)
Applicant’s  spouse  pursued  a  doctorate  degree  in  computational  statistics  and
measurement  at  a  public  university  in  another  U.S.  state.  (Tr.  50.)  She  attended  the
graduation ceremony for her doctorate degree in 2016, and her parents came from China
for  the  ceremony.  However,  she  delayed  her  institutional  defense  for  three  semesters
because she and Applicant were expecting their first child, a daughter who was born in
the United States in January 2018. (GE 3; Tr. 48, 52.) She finished all the requirements
and earned her doctorate degree in 2018. (Tr. 45.)
In September 2017, Applicant resigned from company X and began working as a
senior systems engineer for his current employer, another defense contractor. (GE 3, AE
H.) He took the job for reasons of career advancement and less travel. (Tr. 64.)
During the on-boarding process for his current employment, Applicant took some
security training (AE E), including about the requirement to report foreign contacts. (Tr.
57.) On October 24, 2017, Applicant self-reported to his current employer’s security office
that he was married to a Chinese citizen who holds U.S. permanent residency status (a
“green card”); that this personal relationship began in 2011; and that he had traveled to
China for two weeks in 2012 and 2016 to visit his in-laws, with whom he had contact since
2012.  Applicant  informed  his  new  employer  that  he  had  not  reported  his  spouse  as  a
close contact on his SF 86 completed in 2011 for his previous employer, and that he had
not told his previous employer about his marriage to a Chinese citizen or about his two
trips to China. Applicant provided his new employer with the names of his parents-in-law,
his spouse’s three  sisters, and  her two  brothers, all  resident citizens of  China.  (GE 2.)
Applicant offered no explanation for waiting until October 24, 2017, to inform his current
employer about his foreign contacts. He is not sure what prompted him to tell his security
office on that date other than it “just occurred to him” that it was important.” (Tr. 58.) On
November 14, 2017, Applicant’s employer filed an adverse information report to the DOD
about Applicant’s foreign contacts and his failure to report them to his previous employer.
(GE 2.)
On  February  9,  2018,  Applicant  completed  an  SF  86  on  which  he  reported  his
August  2015  marriage  to  a  Chinese  citizen  who  was  subsequently  granted  U.S.
permanent residency. He included as family members his parents-in-law, both resident
citizens of China, and stated that he had in-person contact with them during his two trips
to China, at his wedding to their daughter in the United States, and “last year.” Applicant
reported that they came to the United States to help with his first child on her birth. He
explained  that  his  in-laws  speak  only  Mandarin,  so  his  spouse  has  to  translate  their
conversations. In response to an SF 86 inquiry into foreign contacts, he listed his spouse’s
three sisters, two brothers, and their spouses; their occupations; and his contacts with
them,  which  were  solely in-person  because they speak only Mandarin  and  his spouse
has to translate for him. (GE 3.)
On  his  February  2018  SF  86,  Applicant  disclosed  that  he  had  sponsored  his
spouse for U.S. permanent residency. He included as reportable foreign travel his trips to
China  in  July  2012  and  May  2016.  He  responded  negatively  to  inquiries  concerning
whether he had been detailed by local customs or security service officials; whether he
had  any  encounters  with  the  police;  whether  he  had  been  in  contact  with  any  person
suspected of being involved or associated with any foreign intelligence, terrorist, security
or  military  organizations;  whether  he  had  been  involved  in  any  counterintelligence  or
security issues; whether he had been in contact with anyone showing undue interest in
his job or attempting to obtain classified or sensitive information from him; and whether
he had been coerced, threatened, or pressured in any way to cooperate with a foreign
government official or foreign intelligence or security service. (GE 3.)
On January 16, 2019, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for
the  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  in  part  about  his  foreign  contacts.  He
indicated that he and his spouse were in the process of renewing her U.S. permanent
residency status (which was scheduled to expire on January 19, 2019,  see GE 3) and
removing the conditions on her U.S. permanent residency. She completed the biometrics
requirements  on  January 3,  2019.  Applicant stated  that  he  and  his spouse  planned  to
continue to  reside in  the  United States, but he  was  uncertain whether she  intended  to
acquire  U.S.  citizenship.  Applicant  indicated  that  with  respect  to  his  spouse’s  family
members in China, he planned to maintain “minimal contact” with them in the future. (GE
4.)
On February 12, 2019, Applicant reported through his employer’s computer-based
Security Contact Reporting and International Protection Travel System that he planned
personal travel to China from March 30, 2019 to April 13, 2019, to visit a sister-in-law and
her family and his parents-in-law. (AE I.) His U.S. passport shows the travel occurred from
April 3, 2019, to April 13, 2019. (Tr.  47.) Applicant was accompanied by his spouse and
their daughter, who remained in China for two months. (Tr. 47.) Applicant has not been
to  China  since  that  trip.  (Tr.  60.)  His  spouse  and  daughter  again  traveled  to  China  in
October  2019  as  her  mother  was  in  ill  health.  They  stayed  in  China  for  “nearly  two
months.” (Tr. 48.)
In response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant indicated on May 29, 2020, that he
and his spouse had discussed her intentions about acquiring U.S. citizenship  and that
she believed it would be beneficial for her career. (GE 4.) She became a naturalized U.S.
citizen  on  April  29,  2021.  (Tr.  37-38.)  While  she  retains  her  Chinese  passport,  she
understands that it is invalid and that she is no longer a citizen of China. China does not
recognize dual citizenship, and when she entered her passport number into the computer,
there was no record of her holding a Chinese passport. (Tr. 49.)
Applicant has owned his home in the United States since December 2015. (GE 3.)
There is no evidence that he has any foreign assets. His spouse does not currently work
outside the home. (Tr. 50.) She and Applicant had their second child, a son, in October
2020. Their two children are both citizens solely of the United States. (Tr. 49.)
Relevant  details  about  Applicant’s  and  his  spouse’s  contacts  with  her  family
members in China and the occupations of these foreign family members follow.
Applicant’s father-in-law is now retired. (Tr. 51.) As of January 16, 2019, he was
employed  as  a  manager  for  a  family-owned  business  in  construction  and  property
management. Applicant’s mother-in-law did not work outside the home. Applicant had in-
person contact with his parents-in-law  during  Applicant’s trips to  China  in July  2012  to
meet  them;  in May 2016 for his  spouse’s cousin’s  wedding;  and  in April 2019  with  his
spouse so her family could see their daughter. Applicant had in-person contact with his
parents-in-law  in  the  United  States  at  his  wedding  to  their  daughter,  and  for  about  six
weeks in early 2018 when they came to help care for his newborn daughter. (GEs 3-4.)
Applicant has not had any contact with his parents-in-law since his trip to China in April
2019. (Tr. 60.) Since they do not speak English (Tr. 36), and he does not speak Mandarin
Chinese (Tr. 60), he does not converse with them when his spouse calls them. (Tr. 60.)
Applicant’s spouse contacts her parents weekly or every other week. (Tr. 35.)
Applicant’s spouse’s sister #1 is 50 years old. As of his February 2018, sister #1
was employed as a professor at a university of science and technology in China. She was
no  longer  working  outside  the  home  as  of  Applicant’s  January  2019  OPM  interview.
Applicant does not know anything about the occupation of this sister-in-law’s husband.
(GEs 3-4.) Applicant had in-person contact with this sister-in-law during his trip to China
in  July  2012  and  in  the  United  States  in  August  2015  when  she  came  for  his  and  his
spouse’s  marriage  ceremony.  Applicant  does  not  have  any  ongoing  contact  with  this
sister-in-law or her spouse. (Tr. 61.) Applicant’s spouse contacts her sister on  Chinese
holidays, such as Chinese New Year and Autumn Festival. (Tr. 35-36, 41.)
Applicant’s spouse’s sister #2 (SOR ¶ 1.d) is 46 years old. Applicant met her in
China during his July 2012 trip and visited with her during his second trip to China in May
2016. This sister-in-law did not come to the United States for his wedding to her sister.
As of Applicant’s January 2019 OPM interview, she was employed as a civil servant for
a forestry bureau in China. Applicant did not know whether it was a government position.
(GEs 3-4.) As of March 2022, she was caring for her spouse who has medical issues. (Tr.
36.) Applicant’s spouse is not sure whether her sister is on a leave of absence from her
job  or  whether  she  has  resigned  from  her  employment.  (Tr.  36-37.)  Applicant  has  no
ongoing  contact  with  this  sister-in-law  or  her  husband.  (Tr.  61.)  They  speak  only
Mandarin. (GEs 3-4; Tr. 36.) Applicant’s spouse contacts her sister on Chinese holidays.
(Tr. 35-36, 41.)
Applicant’s spouse’s sister #3 is 43 years old. Applicant met this sister-in-law and
her spouse during his July 2012 trip to China. She attended his and his spouse’s wedding
in  the  United  States,  and  Applicant  visited  her  and  her  spouse  when  in  China  in  May
2016. She is employed as a professor at a university of science and technology in China.
Her spouse works for an electronics company in China. Applicant does not speak to this
sister-in-law  or  her  husband  because  of  the  language  barrier.  (GEs  3-4;  Tr.  61.)
Applicant’s spouse contacts her sister on Chinese holidays. (Tr. 35-36, 41.)
Applicant’s spouse’s brother #1 is age 42. (GE 3.) He is a physician on staff of a
hospital in China. (Tr. 50.) As of Applicant’s February 2018 SF 86, his wife was a radar
engineer employed by a Chinese military university in China. By the time of Applicant’s
January 2019 OPM interview, she had left that employment and was a faculty member at
a university of law and politics in China. (Tr. 36, 40.) Applicant had in-person contact with
his brother-in-law and brother-in-law’s wife in China in July 2012 and May 2016. Applicant
has  had  very  little  contact  with  his  brother-in-law  or  this  sister-in-law  because  of  the
language  barrier.  (GEs  3-4,  Tr. 36.) When  Applicant’s  spouse  contacts  her brother  on
Chinese holidays, she does not speak to his wife. She does not know what subject her
sister-in-law teaches. During her stays in China, Applicant’s spouse shared some meals
with her sister-in-law. (Tr. 40-41.)
Applicant’s spouse’s brother #2 is her twin. (GE 3; Tr. 43.) He is on the faculty of
a college of communications technology in China. He is a Chinese language instructor.
(Tr. 43-44.) His wife previously worked as a software engineer at a military or government-
related satellite control center in China. (GEs 3-4.) She is currently pursuing a master’s
degree at a university in China.  (Tr. 37, 42.)  Applicant had in-person contact with this
brother-in-law and brother-in-law’s wife  in  China  in  July 2012  and  May 2016.  Spouse’s
brother #2 came to the United States for the wedding in August 2015 without his wife.
Applicant  has had  very little  contact  with  this brother-in-law or his wife  because of  the
language barrier. Like the other members of his spouse’s family in China, they speak only
Mandarin. (GEs 3-4; Tr. 36.) When Applicant’s spouse contacts her brother on Chinese
holidays, she speaks with him but not with his wife. However, she visited with both her
brother and sister-in-law during her trips to China. (Tr. 41-42.) Applicant’s spouse does
not know what her sister-in-law is studying. (Tr. 42.)
Applicant’s  spouse  intends  to  travel  to  China  to  visit  her family  members  in  the
future, hopefully within the next year, if she is able to get a visa and China’s COVID-19
pandemic travel restrictions are lifted. (Tr. 48.) She does not believe that any of her family
in  China  are  members  of  the  Chinese  Communist  Party,  but  she  does  not  know  for
certain. (Tr. 51.) To Applicant’s knowledge, none of his spouse’s family members in China
know that he works for a defense contractor. Applicant’s spouse is aware that he holds a
DOD security clearance. (Tr. 62.)
Character and Work References
Applicant’s  academic and  professional accomplishments  show  dedication  to  his
studies, internships, and then his duties as a full-time employee for his former and current
defense contractors. (AE H.) In his current position, Applicant has served as a custodian
of  material classified  as  “Secret/NOFORN.” (AE  G.) There is no  indication that he has
violated any security requirements. A former co-worker, who has known Applicant for the
past  three  years,  is  aware  that  Applicant  has  worked  on  two  jobs  involving  sensitive
information. This co-worker attests  that Applicant  “is  always  very  respectful of  privacy,
classified  information, rules and  restrictions.”  Applicant gave  him  no  reason  to  doubt or
question his handling of security information. (AE A.)
A systems engineering lead who began interacting with Applicant on a daily basis
for their work on a specific program in 2019 indicates that Applicant quickly assumed the
responsibility of being the systems integration lead on the program. (AE B.) Their work
together included the transfer of classified information onto an information system prior
to destruction. (Tr. 28.) Applicant “worked diligently on classified requirements and was
always very attentive.” This systems engineering lead came to admire Applicant’s work
ethic  and  his  coaching  of  other  team  members  on  the  careful  handling  of  classified
material. He described Applicant’s character “as a model for many to follow.” (AE B.)
Applicant’s former functional manager for about two years witnessed Applicant’s
“dedication and determination to succeed.” Applicant is required to maintain a secret-level
clearance for his employment, and to this manager’s knowledge, Applicant is up-to-date
on  all  security  training.  He  has  found  Applicant  to  be  enthusiastic,  well-tempered,  and
diligent,  and  well-liked  and  respected  by  his  peers.  The  manager  recommends  that
Applicant retain his clearance eligibility. (AE C.)
Applicant’s  current  functional  manager  since  approximately  September  2021
indicates that it has been her pleasure to mentor Applicant. He is a high performer and
conscientious engineer. In their interactions, Applicant has been “always open and honest
and  willing  to  speak  up  if  something  doesn’t  feel  right.”  She  describes  Applicant  as
“hardworking, dependable,  trustworthy, and security  conscious,  and  concludes, “I have
no doubt that this case was an honest oversight, which he understands the seriousness
of,  and  recommend  that  [Applicant]  maintain  his  clearance  status.”  (AE  D.)  When  she
rated  Applicant  for  his  performance  in  2021,  she  commented  that  Applicant  “always
displays ethical behavior in his everyday work activities.” Applicant had an “outstanding
year”  and  was  given  an  overall  performance  rating  of  high  performance  in  that  his
contributions exceeded expectations. (AE F.)
Applicant’s transcript of his training for his current employer since September 11,
2017, reflects the numerous training courses Applicant has completed, some online and
some  in  the  classroom.  Applicant  took  his  initial  annual  security  training  online  on
September 13, 2017, and closed area briefing and classified container custodian training
online on September 14, 2017, with perfect scores. (AE E.)
Administrative Notice
After  reviewing  U.S.  government  publications  concerning  China  and  its  foreign
relations  and  mindful  of  my  obligation  to  consider  updated  information,  I  take
administrative notice of the facts requested by the Government as supplemented by the
following facts:
China  is  an  authoritarian  state  with  paramount  authority  vested  in  the  Chinese
Communist Party (CCP). In all important government, economic, and cultural institutions
in China, the CCP ensures that party and state policy guidance is followed. President Xi
has very few checks on his power as Beijing continues to restrict the personal freedoms
of its citizens. China is the only competitor potentially capable of mounting a sustained
challenge to a stable and open international system. Along with Russia, China presents
a persistent cyber espionage and cyber-attack threat to the U.S. core military and critical
infrastructure  systems.  The  country  has  expansive  efforts  in  place  to  acquire  U.S.
technology,  to  include  trade  secrets  and  propriety  information.  To  support  its  military
modernization, China fills the gaps in its defense and commercial research by engaging
in large-scale, state-sponsored theft of intellectual property and proprietary information.
In accord with its national security objective to leverage legally and illegally acquired dual-
use  and  military-related  technologies  to  its  advantage,  China  uses  its  intelligence
services, computer intrusions, and other illicit approaches to obtain national security and
export-controlled  technologies,  controlled  equipment,  and  other  materials.  China’s
influence operations are coordinated at a high level within the party-state.
China  leverages  foreign  investments,  commercial  joint  ventures,  academic
exchanges, the experience of Chinese students and researchers, and state-sponsored
industrial  and  technical  espionage  to  increase  the  level  of  technologies  and  expertise
available  to  support  its  military  research,  development,  and  acquisition.  China  blends
intelligence and non-intelligence assets and frequently seeks to exploit Chinese citizens
or persons with family ties to China who can use their insider access to steal trade secrets
from U.S. companies. China’s “Thousand Talents Program” seeks to  recruit individuals
from  diaspora  populations  and  recent  emigrants  to  obtain  scientific  and  technical
information  necessary  for  modernization  of  its  defense  technology.  China’s  National
Intelligence Law of 2017 compels all Chinese firms and entities to support, assist, and
cooperate with Chinese intelligence services, and to turn over any data collected abroad
or  domestically  to  the  Chinese  government.  The  law  provides  for  incentives  for
compliance and penalties for noncompliance.
About  80%  of  all  economic  espionage  prosecutions  brought  by  the  U.S.
Department of Justice have involved allegations of trade secret theft that would benefit
China.  About  60%  of  all  trade  secret  theft  cases  had  some  nexus  to  China.  It  led  the
United States to launch a China initiative within the Department aimed at identifying and
prosecuting  those  engaged  in  trade  secret  theft,  computer  hacking,  and  economic
espionage with a dual focus of protecting the U.S. critical infrastructure against external
threats through foreign direct investment and supply chain compromises, and combating
covert  efforts  to  influence  the  American  public  and  policymakers  without  proper
transparency.
In  June  2020,  a  Chinese  citizen  was  convicted  of  economic espionage,  theft  of
trade secrets, and conspiracy to commit theft from two U.S. companies of semiconductor
technology for China. He plotted with a Chinese university to steal the trade secrets for
the benefit of China’s government.
On  July 23,  2020,  the  United  States  closed  the  Chinese  Consulate  in  Houston,
Texas,  as  the  consulate  was  particularly  aggressive  in  illegal  spying  and  influence
10
operations and  directly  involved  in fraud  and  theft  of intellectual  property  from  research
institutions and  companies in Texas. Chinese  Communist Party  agents working  out of  the
consulate   helped   People’s  Liberation   Army   (PLA)  officers  “evade   and   obstruct”  law
enforcement to illegally conceal their military affiliations.
In  November  2020,  a  Chinese  national  naturalized  in  the  United  States  and
employed for ten years by a defense contractor,  was sentenced for exporting sensitive
military  technology  to  China.  During  a  personal  trip  to  China  from  December  2018  to
January  2019,  he  brought  unclassified  technical  information  in  his  company-issued
computer, in knowing violation of the Arms Export Control Act and the International Traffic
in Arms Regulations.
In  January  2021,  a  Chinese  national  was  charged  with  criminal  conspiracy  to
export U.S. power amplifiers to China from 2012 to 2015. He is alleged to have caused
at least 18 shipments of export-controlled goods from the United States to Hong Kong,
knowing that the goods would be then shipped to China.
In  February  2021, a  Chinese  businessman  residing  in Hong  Kong  was indicted  for
conspiring to steal a U.S. company’s trade secrets involving a silicon carbide technology
worth   millions  with   the   intent  of   producing   the   technology   in  China.   His  co-conspirator
allegedly  was an engineer for the victimized company.
In April 2021, a Chinese national living in the United States, who had been admitted
to the United States through the EB-5  Immigrant Investor Visa Program in 2014, pled
guilty to conspiracy to unlawfully exporting hydrophones used for anti-submarine warfare
from  the  United  States  to  a  Chinese  military  university  without  the  required  export
licenses;  visa fraud; making false  statements to  law enforcement agents  regarding his
customers  and  types  of  parts  exported  to  China;  money  laundering;  and  smuggling
hydrophones  to  the  Chinese  military  university.  The  university  has  been  on  the  U.S.
Department of Commerce’s Entity List for national security reasons since 2001.
In May 2021, a university researcher in the United States with strong ties to China
was sentenced to 37 months in prison for making false statements to federal authorities
as  part  of  an  immunology  research  fraud  scheme.  He  had  lied  on  applications  to  use
approximately  $4.1  million  in  grants  from  the  National  Institutes  of  Health  to  develop
China’s  expertise  in  rheumatology  and  immunology.  For  years,  he  concealed  his
participation in Chinese government talent recruitment programs and his affiliations with
at least five research institutions in China.
In  June  2021, the  U.S.  State  Department  issued  a  level 3  travel advisory  for China
due   to   China’s  arbitrary   enforcement  of  local  laws,  including   carrying   out  unlawful
detentions   and   using   bans   on   U.S.  citizens   and   those   of   other  countries   without   due
process of  law  to  compel individuals to  participate  in Chinese  government investigations;
pressure family  members to  return to  China  from  abroad; influence  Chinese  authorities
to  resolve  civil disputes in favor of  Chinese  citizens; and  gain bargaining  leverage  over
foreign  governments.  U.S. citizens traveling  or residing  in  China  may  be  detained  without
11
access to U.S. consular services or information about their alleged crime, and may be
subjected to prolonged interrogations and extended detention without due process of law.
China  has  a  record  of  human  rights  abuses.  Members  of  the  security  forces  in
China committed serious and pervasive abuses in 2020. Genocide and crimes against
humanity  occurred  against  the  predominantly  Muslim  Uyghurs  and  other  ethic  and
religious minority groups in Xinjiang. Arbitrary detention by the government included the
mass detention of more than one million Uyghurs and other members of  predominantly
Muslim minority groups in extrajudicial internment camps and subjected two million more
to daytime-only  “re-education” training. Other significant human  rights abuses included
arbitrary or unlawful killings, forced disappearances, and torture by the government; harsh
and  life-threatening  prison  conditions;  political  prisoners;  the  lack  of  an  independent
judiciary  and  Communist  Party  control  over  the  judicial  and  legal  system;  arbitrary
interference with privacy; pervasive and intrusive technical surveillance and monitoring;
serious restrictions on free expression of the press and Internet with censorship and site
blocking;  interference  with  the  rights  of  peaceful  assembly,  freedom  of  movement,
assembly,  and  association;  the  inability  of  citizens  to  choose  their  government  and
restrictions on political participation; serious corruption; forced sterilization and abortion;
forced labor and trafficking in person; several restrictions on labor rights; and child labor.
Government  officials  and  security  services  often  committed  human  rights  abuses  with
impunity.
",False
"Applicant  admitted  SOR  allegations1.a  through  1.c,  1.e,  1.f,  1.h,  and  1.j.  He
denied SOR allegations 1.d, 1.g, and 1.i with explanations. After a thorough and careful
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 53 years old and married with two children. He received a doctorate
degree in 1997. He is applying for national security eligibility and a security clearance in
connection  with  his  employment  as  a  senior  executive  with  a  defense  contractor  he
founded. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, 17, and 18; Tr. Two at 26-29, 32.)
Paragraph 1 – Guideline B (Foreign Influence)
SOR allegations 1.a, and 1.b concern Applicant’s  in-laws, who are dual citizens
of Taiwan and Canada.
Applicant  is  a  native-born  American  citizen.  His  wife  is  also  a  native-born
American citizen. Her family lived in the United States, Canada, and Taiwan when she
was  young.  She  returned  to  the  United  States  in  1998,  at  the  age  of  17,  to  attend
college. She has lived in the United States ever since. They were married in 2012 and
have two native-born children. She works for her husband’s company. One of her duties
is as the facility security officer (FSO). (Tr. Two at 26, 31-32.)
Applicant’s  mother-in-law  and  father-in-law  are  citizens  of  Taiwan  and  Canada,
and  reside  in Taiwan. Neither of  his in-laws  have  any connection to  the Taiwanese  or
Chinese governments. (Tr. One at 60, 62; Tr. Two at 39-42.)
Applicant’s  spouse   has  been   estranged   from   her  mother  for  many   years.  The
reason   is  unknown,  but  appears  to   center  around   her  choice  of   Applicant  as  her
husband. She  stated, “My  mother, the  relationship is pretty  much  non-existent from  her
side. It’s very  binary. After I got  married,  she  stopped  talking  to  me  pretty  much  unless
she  has to  because  there are other people  there.”  Applicant last saw  his  mother-in-law
in 2018  in  Taiwan  in  connection  with  his  brother-in-law’s   wedding. (Tr. One  62-65, 67-
68.)
Applicant described his own relationship with his mother-in-law as follows:
I have seen her. I don’t talk with her at all. Her English is apparently good.
But, I see her on formal occasions like our wedding, [Applicant’s spouse’s]
brothers’ weddings or engagement ceremonies. . .. And she’ll be basically
acting as the hostess, and she would treat us with the courtesy one would
give a guest that you don’t know.  (Tr. Two 40-41.) (See Tr. Two at 73-74.)
Applicant’s  father-in-law  runs  a  company  with  his  brothers.  Applicant  has  no
ownership interest in the company and cannot inherit any interest in it because he is not
Taiwanese.  The  company  does  no  business  with  the  Taiwanese  or  Chinese
governments. He has never received any financial benefit from the company. (Tr. One
at 60-61; Tr. Two at 42, 44-45.)
With regard to Applicant’s spouse’s relationship with her father, she testified that
it was growing  more distant over the  years. She  stated, “And, then, with  my father, it’s
better.  We  still  talk  to  each  other  on  the  phone.  It  was  more  frequent  when  I  was  in
school. It was pretty much weekly. Now, it’s not so much. My life is busy, his life is busy.
So,  if  we’re  lucky,  maybe  every  other  week,  we  call  and  chitchat.”  She  last  saw  her
father in 2019 in her state of residence when he was there on a business trip. (Tr. One
at 63-65.)
Applicant  stated  that  he  liked  his  father-in-law,  but  their  interactions  are  very
limited, due to the actions of the mother-in-law. Also, there is a severe language barrier
as Applicant does not speak Chinese and his father-in-law knows very little English. (Tr.
Two at 40.)
Applicant  has  two  brothers-in-law.  The  older  brother-in-law  was  born  in  the
United  States  and  resides  here.  He  submitted  a  statement  in  support  of  Applicant.
However, he  admits in  that statement,  “My relationship with [Applicant] is more distant
than  my  relationship  with  [Applicant’s  spouse].  We  only  speak  when  [Applicant’s
spouse]  is  also  involved.  I  understand  [Applicant]  and  my  father  communicate
occasionally,  but  their  conversations  are  limited,  at  least  partially  because  my  father
does not speak much English.” (Applicant Exhibit G.)
Applicant’s   other  brother-in-law   is  a   citizen   of   Taiwan   and   Canada.  He   is  a
Permanent Legal Resident  of the  United  States and  has resided  in the  United  States for
over 20  years. Applicant has little contact with  this brother-in-law, which the brother-in-
law   confirmed   in  his  testimony   in  the   spouse’s  case   20-01739.   He  testified   about   his
relationship  with  Applicant  as follows, “I view  him [Applicant]  as  her husband,  and  I  don’t
go  out of my  way  to  talk to  him. There is no  reason for me  to talk to  him.” He also stated
that the last time  he spoke to Applicant was in 2017. (Tr. One at 30.)
Applicant  testified  about  his  relationship  with  this  brother-in-law,  stating  it  is,
“Non-existent. Again, we don’t talk on the phone. There is no animosity, but there is no
relationship.” (Tr. 41.)
SOR allegations 1.c through 1.j involve Applicant’s foreign financial connections.
Several  general  statements  are  applicable  to  these  particular  allegations.  First,
Applicant  and  his  spouse  confirmed  that  she  has  no  ownership  interest  in  any  of  the
foreign  financial  accounts  and  investments  of  Applicant.  Second,  these  investment
vehicles and bank accounts are used by Applicant  to diversify his portfolio, a common
investment  strategy.  As  further  described  below,  with  the  exception  of  a  small  bank
account  in  China,  all  of  his  foreign  bank  accounts  and  other  financial  interests  are  in
nations  that  are  friendly  to  the  United  States,  or  allies  of  the  United  States.  Finally,
Applicant  has  consistently  reported  to  the  Federal  Government  the  existence  of  his
foreign  bank  accounts  and  the  amounts  in  them.  (Answer  at  pages  4-5;  Government
Exhibit 1 at Section 20A, Government Exhibit 2; Applicant Exhibit H; Tr. One at 77; Tr.
Two at 54-55, 58-63.)
As  stated,  Applicant  started  a  closely-held  corporation  (The  Company)  in  1998
when  he  was  30  years  old.  Applicant’s  spouse  has  no  ownership  interest  in  The
Company.  Applicant  has  been  a  very  successful  scientist  and  entrepreneur  since  he
began The Company. His net worth  in the United States  is between 35 and 40 million
dollars.  He  supplied  extensive  documentary  evidence  to  support  that  statement.
(Applicant Exhibit J; Tr. One at 44-47; Tr. Two at 34-36, 63-66.)
With that background, we move to a discussion of the specific allegations.
1.c.  Applicant  purchased  property  in  Taiwan.  He  subsequently  built  on  that
location with an expectation of creating some kind of hospitality business. Those plans
have not come to fruition. The building is vacant and Applicant has no current plans to
finish the building or have it occupied. He believes the property and building to be worth
approximately  $1,000,000.  He  owes  about  $400,000  on  the  property.  This  property  is
part of his diversification investment strategy. (Tr. One at 71-76; Tr. Two at 46-50.)
With  regard  to  the  specific  bank  accounts  described  below,  the  figures  in  them
are derived from the most recent Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts reports (FBAR),
which are for 2020. Applicant stated that the bank accounts have been funded from his
personal savings. The FBARs also confirm that he is the individual account holder on all
of them. Finally, a review of earlier FBARs reveals that the accounts are static holdings.
In  other  words,  there  has  been  no  appreciable  increase  in  the  amounts  held  in  the
various bank accounts. Applicant further stated that with the exception of the company
in Taiwan described in SOR allegation 1.j, below, he has no plans to do business in any
other foreign country. (Applicant Exhibit H; Tr. Two at 61-62.)
1.d.  Applicant has two bank accounts in Foreign Country (FC) A. Their combined
value in 2020 was $713,278. (Applicant Exhibit H at 70-71.)
1.e.  Applicant has one bank account in FC B. The value of this account in 2020
was $495,127. (Applicant Exhibit H at 70; Tr. Two at 56.)
1.f.  Applicant has one bank account in FC C. The value of this account in 2020
was $387. (Applicant Exhibit H at 70; Tr. Two at 56.)
1.g. Applicant has one bank account in FC D. The value of this account in 2020
was $6,915. (Applicant Exhibit H at 69; Tr. Two at 56-57.)
1.h.  Applicant  has  three  bank accounts  in Taiwan.  One  of  them has  no money,
according  to  the  2020  FBAR.  The  other  two  have  a  combined  value  of  $115,893.
(Applicant Exhibit H at 69, 71; Tr. Two at 53-54.)
1.i.  Applicant has one bank account in China. The value of this account in 2020
was $77. (Applicant Exhibit H at 69; Tr. 57-58.)
The  total  value  of  Applicant’s  foreign  bank  accounts  is  $1,331,677.  When  one
includes  the  property  and  building,  his  foreign  holdings  amount  to  about  $2,000,000.
This figure is approximately 7% of his stateside net worth, which  is estimated between
35 and 40 million dollars. (Tr. Two at 66-67.)
1.j.  Applicant  established  a  company  in  Taiwan  in  approximately  2014.  This
company has no assets and does no business. Applicant established the company with
the hope that it might improve relations with his in-laws. It did not succeed in doing so
and has no current value. (Tr. One at 75-76; Tr. Two at 43-46, 68-71.)
Applicant  stated  that  he  does  not  rely  on  any  of  the  foreign  accounts  or
investments  to  cover  any  of  his  daily  living,  personal  or  family  expenses.  He  has  an
annual  income  in  the  United  States  of  between  $200,000  and  $600,000.  He  testified
that  the  possible  loss  of  the  foreign  bank  accounts  would  have  minimal  impact  on  his
day-to-day life. (Tr. Two at 30, 59-60, 67.)
Mitigation
Applicant submitted a written statement from a counterintelligence (CI) agent for
the  Defense  Counterintelligence  and  Security  Service.  He  has  worked  with  the
Applicant since 2017 in his role as founder of The Company.
The CI agent stated in Applicant Exhibit E:
At  my request, [Applicant] has offered himself  as  a  subject matter expert
regarding  a  variety  of  subjects  he  is  well  versed  in.  Anytime  [Applicant]
has a question regarding counterintelligence issues, he reaches out to me
for  advice  and  assistance  regarding  how  to  handle  the  situation.
[Applicant] has been one of the best reporters of suspicious information in
[the state where The Company is located].
The agent’s statement goes on:
Especially  given  my  position,  I  appreciate  and  respect  the  seriousness
and  gravity  of  the  security  clearance  application  process.  While  my
interaction  with  [Applicant]  has  been  limited  as  described  above,  it  is  my
opinion [Applicant] has been open and honest in his interactions with me. .
..  I  often  use  [Applicant’s]  dedication  to  reporting  CI  concerns  as  an
example  of  what  a  superior  CI  awareness  program  looks  like  and
encourage other companies to do the same.
Applicant testified that he would contact the CI Agent if there were any questions
or concerns about foreign contacts. (Tr. Two at 36-38.)
A business associate and friend of Applicant testified on his behalf and provided
a written statement. The witness is currently a senior intelligence analyst working for the
scientific  and  technical  intelligence  branch  of  an  American  armed  force  intelligence
activity. He has known Applicant for over twenty years on a personal and professional
basis. (Applicant Exhibit C; Tr. 17-24.)
The witness stated in Applicant Exhibit C:
Based on my interactions with [Applicant], I believe he is someone with a
strong  moral  compass  who  is  loyal  to  our  country.  .  ..  in  my  opinion,
[Applicant]  is  deserving  of  trust  and  he  would  be  a  valuable  asset  in
continuing  to  support  our  classified  national  defense  work.  In  my  many
years  of  professional and  personal  interaction  with  [Applicant],  I  have  no
reason to doubt his patriotism or commitment to national defense.
As  an   individual  operating   in   the   national   security   space   for  more   than
three  decades, I appreciate  and  respect the  seriousness and  gravity of the
security   clearance   application   process.  Because   of   my   respect  for  that
process,   I  can   confidently   lend   my   support  to   [Applicant’s]  application   to
be   granted   a   security   clearance   as  clearly   consistent  with   the   nation’s
interests.
Taiwan
Applicant  has  contacts  with  Taiwan.  Accordingly,  it  is  appropriate  to  look  at  the
current  situation  concerning  Taiwan.  Taiwan  is  a  multiparty  democracy;  whose
authorities  generally  respect  the  human  rights  of  its  citizens.  Taiwan  is  an  active
collector of industrial information and engages in industrial espionage, as shown by the
administrative  notice  documents  in  the  record.  However,  the  record  does  not
demonstrate that the Taiwanese government seeks to exert pressure on U.S. citizens to
collect information from family members residing in country or abroad. Finally, it is worth
noting  that  the  U.S.  Government,  and  the  Defense  Department  in  particular,  have  a
close  and  continuing  relationship  with  Taiwan  and  its  military,  in  accordance  with  the
Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, which has  governed policy in the absence of diplomatic
relations or a defense treaty with Taiwan. In 2018 the Secretary of Defense stated, “The
Department  of  Defense  remains  steadfastly  committed  to  working  with  Taiwan  to
provide the defense articles and services necessary to maintain sufficient self-defense
consistent  with  our  obligation  set  out  in  our  Taiwan  Relations  Act.  We  oppose  all
unilateral  efforts  to  alter  the  status  quo,  and  will  continue  to  insist  any  resolution  of
differences  accord  with  the  will  of  the  people  on  both  sides  of  the  Taiwan  Strait.”
(Department  of   Defense,  Remarks  by  Secretary  Mattis  at  Plenary  Session   of  the
2018   Shangri-La   Dialogue,   https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Transcripts/Transcript/
Article/1538599/remarks-by-secretary-mattis-at-plenary-session-of-the-2018-shangri-la-
dialogue/  (June  2, 2018).)
China
I  take  administrative  notice  of  the  facts  set  forth  in  the  Administrative  Notice
documents  concerning  China,  which  are  incorporated  herein  by  reference.  China  is  a
large and economically powerful country,  with a population of more than billion people
and  an  economy  growing  at  about  10%  per  year.  China  has  an  authoritarian
government,  dominated  by  the  Chinese  Communist  Party.  It  has  a  poor  record  with
respect  to human  rights,  suppresses  political dissent,  and  engages  in  arbitrary arrests
and detentions, forced confessions, torture, and mistreatment of prisoners. China is one
of  the  most  aggressive  countries  in  seeking  sensitive  and  protected  U.S.  technology
and economic intelligence. It targets the United States with active intelligence gathering
programs,  both  legal  and  illegal.  As  a  result,  it  is  a  growing  threat  to  U.S.  national
security. In addition, China views Taiwan as part of China. China has engaged in many
different  coercive  diplomatic  and  military  activities,  seeking  to  isolate  and  intimidate
Taiwan into unification on China’s terms.
",True
"Applicant is a 35-year-old prospective employee of a defense contractor, applying for
a position as an interpreter/translator. He was born in Kabul, Afghanistan, and graduated
from high school in 2008  in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. He completed some college
coursework. He married in Kabul, Afghanistan, in  June 2013, and has two children; ages
four and seven. He has been employed as a semi-truck driver since February 2021.
After the Soviet Union invasion of Afghanistan and civil war, Applicant was smuggled
out of Afghanistan via Pakistan in about 1999, to work with his uncle in a tailor shop in Iran.
He lived in Iran for about one year when he fell ill and returned to Afghanistan in 2000 to live
with  his  parents,  and  then  as  a  refugee  in  the  United  Nations  Refugee  Resettlement
program. From 2008 to 2011, Applicant worked at a joint U.S./UK base in Lashkar Gah, the
capital  of  Helmand  Province,  Afghanistan.  First  he  worked  for  the  British  Foreign
Commonwealth  Office  as  a  management  assistant  where  he  supervised  maintenance
workers, then in 2011, he worked for the U.S. Marine Corps and another government agency
(OGA) as a political advisor and translator/interpreter. He often accompanied U.S. personnel
in  dangerous  meetings  with  tribal  leaders.  He  lived  in  town  with  his  family  until  he  was
recognized and threatened by a village elder and Taliban supporter. Because of the threat
to his life, he was moved to on-base housing for his safety. The joint base closed in 2013,
and the Marines and OGA personnel at the base strongly supported his immigration to the
U.S.
In December 2013, Applicant and his spouse relocated to the United States under a
Special  Immigrant  Visa  (SIV)  program  for  persons  employed  in  Afghanistan  by  U.S.
government or by the International Security Assistance Forces (ISAF). An SIV under this
program is available to those who have provided documented faithful and valuable service
to  the  U.S.  government  or  ISAF,  and  have  experienced  or  are  experiencing  an  ongoing
serious  threat  as  a  consequence  of  their  employment.  (https://travel.state.gov/content/
travel/en/us-visas/immigrate/special-immg-visa-afghans-employed-us-gov.html)  Applicant
became a naturalized U.S. citizen in August 2019, and his spouse became a citizen in May
or  June,  2019.  They  renounced  their  Afghan  citizenship  and  enthusiastically  swore
allegiance to the United States.
The   SOR  alleges  Applicant   has   seventeen   foreign   contacts   and   interests  in
Afghanistan. It alleges  his mother, father, six  sisters, two  brothers, and  mother and  father-
in-law  are citizens and  residents  of Afghanistan.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a  to  1.f)  It  also  alleges his father,
brother, four uncles,  and  father-in-law  have  significant military  and  intelligence  ties to  the
former Afghan  military and government.  (SOR ¶¶ 1.g to  1.l)  Finally, it alleges that Applicant
owns property  in Afghanistan, and  provided  financial support demanded  by  his father,  and
to  his  brother,  father-in-law, and  brother-in-law, all  citizens of  Afghanistan.  (SOR ¶¶  1.m  to
1.q)  Applicant  admitted   all   of  the   allegations  except  for  owning   property   and   providing
financial  support  to   his  father   under  demand,  however  he   does   not   deny   financially
supporting his father. (SOR ¶¶  1.m and  1.n)
Applicant’s mother, father, three sisters, and his youngest brother are citizens of and
live in Kabul, Afghanistan. His father, a former colonel and intelligence officer in the Afghan
Army,  is  retired  and  sick  at  home  with  deep  shrapnel  wounds.  He  learned  of  Applicant’s
work with the Marines because they lived together. Applicant testified that his father worked
for the Taliban at one time, but he refused to fight the Northern Alliance and “snuck out of
Kabul.”
Three weeks before the hearing, the Taliban searched his family’s home for uniforms
or other signs of military involvement. This was part of a Taliban sweep of homes in Kabul
after the U.S. withdrawal. His father told them he retired from the government three years
ago, and was not well. Applicant kept daily telephonic contact with his family during the most
turbulent times, and now talks with them about weekly or bi-weekly. His spouse spoke to
her family  in  Afghanistan  weekly,  and  she  traveled  to  Afghanistan  with  her  children  from
March to September 2019, to visit family. About two weeks before the hearing, his in-laws
were forced to move to Pakistan for survival from the Taliban. His father-in-law previously
worked for the Afghan army.
Since no one in his parents’  household is able to work since the fall of the Afghan
government, Applicant has provided financial support to his family since 2013 out of loyalty
and familial obligation. In the last five years, he sent about $4,000 to $5,000 per year to his
immediate family. Since 2021, he sent about $10,000. Currently, he sends monthly support
to his father of about $300 to $1,000, and at one time sent $4,000 to help them move to
Kabul. He sent about $8,000 to his father-in-law over the past eight years. He testified that
if  his  family  is  caught  receiving  money  from  an  American  citizen,  “there  will  be
consequences.”
Applicant has a  brother that  was a  former Afghan  intelligence  officer who  worked  with
U.S.  forces   and   was  evacuated   to   Abu   Dhabi,  UAE,   when   the   Taliban   took  control.   His
brother does not work or leave  his hotel. He speaks to  his brother in Abu  Dhabi  regularly.
He has two  uncles who  served  as officers in  the  Afghan  military  (one  in intelligence), but
they  retired  and  may  still  live  in Afghanistan. Applicant does not have  regular contact with
them.  He  has  another  uncle  who   was  a   colonel  in  Afghan   intelligence.  His  current  work
status  is unclear.  Applicant’s spouse  visited  with  him  when  she  went to  Afghanistan. Another
uncle  was  a  former  brigadier   general in   the  Afghan  army   special  forces,   who   is in   hiding
from the  Taliban. Applicant does not have regular contact with him.
Applicant has six sisters, all of whom live in Afghanistan. Three were in high school
and  college  before  the  Taliban  took  control,  but  they  now  live  with  his  parents  in  Kabul.
Another is a stay-at-home mother of four children, one is married to a U.S. cab driver in an
arranged  marriage,  and  one  is a  housewife. He  speaks  to  his oldest  sister about  once  a
month, but has limited contact with his other sisters. One sister, not alleged in the SOR, lived
in Iran when Applicant lived there, but now works as a nurse in Afghanistan and has worked
for a U.S. relief organization.
Applicant has no assets overseas, and rents an apartment in the U.S.  In 2009, he
and his friends purchased property in Afghanistan to build on. He paid about $5,000. He
transferred  the  property to  his father before  leaving Afghanistan,  and  no  longer holds  an
interest in it. Applicant earns about $72,000 - $90,000 per year as a truck driver, and has
put a deposit down to purchase his own a semi-truck. Applicant stated that he owes his life
to the U.S. Marines that he worked with and loves them more than his brothers. He stated
that the Marines treated him with respect and trusted him. His testimony at the hearing was
sincere and credible.
Applicant  provided  several  strong  letters  of  recommendation  for  his  SIV  and
immigration to the U.S. from American military and civilian government officials he worked
with in Afghanistan. He also received a Certificate of Commendation from the U.S. Marine
Corps.
Afghanistan
Afghanistan is a country in Southwestern Asia that is approximately the size of Texas
(249,935 square miles). Pakistan borders it on the east and the south. Iran borders it on the
west and Russia to the north. It is a rugged and mountainous country which has been fought
over by powerful nations for centuries.
Afghanistan  has  an  unstable  government  led  by  the  Taliban;  a  brutal,  oppressive,
militia  group  with  longstanding  animosity  to  the  United  States;  and  is  a  haven  for  other
terrorist groups such as Al-Qaeda, AQIS, and ISIS-K. The Taliban took control of the Afghan
capital after the U.S. and NATO forces precipitously withdrew from the country, ending on
August 30, 2021. Following the effective collapse of the government of the Islamic Republic
of  Afghanistan during  the  2021  Taliban  offensive,  the  Taliban  declared  the  country  an
Islamic Emirate. A new caretaker government was announced on September 7, 2021. The
Taliban and terrorist organizations within Afghanistan have a history of extreme violence,
human  rights  abuses,  oppression  against  minorities  and  women,  lawlessness,  and
corruption. With a strong anti-western bias, all western individuals and Afghans associated
with the U.S. or NATO governments are at critical risk of becoming targets for terror groups
and/or the Taliban. Afghanistan is considered an exceptionally dangerous country.
Afghanistan has had a turbulent political history, including an invasion by the Soviet
Union in 1979. After an accord was reached in 1989, and the Soviet Union withdrew from
Afghanistan, fighting continued among the various ethnic, clan, and religious militias. By the
end  of  1998,  the  Taliban  rose  to  power  and  controlled  90%  of  the  country,  imposing
aggressive and repressive policies.
In  October  2001,  U.S.  forces  and  coalition  partners  led  military  operations  in  the
country,  forcing  the  Taliban  out  of  power  by  November  2001.  The  new  democratic
government took power in 2004 after a popular election.
On  14  April  2021,  the  NATO  Secretary  General  and  President  Biden  agreed  to
withdraw military troops from Afghanistan by September 11, 2021. Soon after the withdrawal
started  in  May  2021,  the  Taliban  launched  an  offensive  against  the  Afghan  government,
quickly advancing in front of collapsing Afghan government forces. On August 15, 2021, as
the Taliban once again controlled a vast majority of Afghan territory, they re-captured the
capital city of  Kabul, and many civilians, government officials and foreign diplomats were
evacuated. Afghan President Ghani fled Afghanistan that day.
Western nations have suspended most humanitarian aid to Afghanistan following the
Taliban's  takeover  of  the  country  in  August  2021  and  the  World  Bank  and  International
Monetary Fund also halted payments. In October 2021, more than half of Afghanistan's 39
million people faced an acute food shortage. On November 11, 2021, Human Rights Watch
reported that Afghanistan was facing widespread famine due to an economic and banking
crisis.
A  U.S.  State  Department  Level  “4”  Travel  Advisory  remains  in  effect.  The  State
Department  warns  U.S.  citizens  against  travel  to  Afghanistan  because  of  continued
instability and threats by terrorist organizations against U.S. citizens.
Law and Policies
“[N]o one  has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy  v. Egan, 484
U.S. 518, 528  (1988). As Commander in Chief, the  President has the  authority  to  “control
access to  information  bearing  on  national security  and  to  determine  whether an  individual is
sufficiently  trustworthy to  have  access to  such  information.” Id. at 527. The  President has
authorized  the  Secretary  of  Defense  or his designee  to  grant applicants eligibility  for access
to   classified   information   “only   upon   a   finding   that   it  is  clearly   consistent  with   the   national
interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865 §  2.
National  security  eligibility  is  predicated  upon  the  applicant  meeting  the  criteria
contained  in  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  These  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.
Instead, recognizing the complexities of  human behavior, an administrative judge applies
these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of  the whole person. An administrative
judge’s  overarching  adjudicative  goal  is  a  fair,  impartial,  and  commonsense  decision.  An
administrative judge must consider a person’s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, discretion,
character, honesty, and judgment. AG ¶ 1(b).
The  Government  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  persons  with
access  to  classified  information.  This  relationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and
endures  throughout  off-duty  hours.  Decisions  include,  by  necessity,  consideration  of  the
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about
potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.
Clearance  decisions must be  made  “in  terms of  the  national interest  and  shall  in no
sense  be  a  determination  as to  the  loyalty  of the  applicant concerned.” Exec. Or.  10865  §  7.
Thus, a  decision  to  deny  a  security  clearance  is merely  an  indication  the  applicant  has not
met  the  strict guidelines the  President  and  the  Secretary  of Defense  have  established  for
issuing a clearance.
Initially,  the  Government must   establish,   by   substantial evidence,  conditions  in   the
personal or  professional history  of the  applicant that  may  disqualify  the  applicant from  being
eligible  for access to  classified  information. The  Government has the  burden  of  establishing
controverted  facts alleged  in the  SOR. See  Egan, 484  U.S. at 531. “Substantial evidence”

"Applicant admitted to the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 1.g. He denied SOR
allegations  ¶¶  1.c~1.f.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,
and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  78-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed with the defense contractor, in a “casual on call . . . status” since 2016. He is
not married. (TR at page 20 lines 1~15, and GX 1 at page 5.)
Guideline B - Foreign Influence
1.a.  and  1.g. Applicant  has  lived  in South  Korea  since  1979, working  for various
U.S. Government organizations and  U.S. defense  contractors. (TR at page  18  line  2  to
page   20   line   7,   and   AppX   G.)   Applicant’s   “live-in  girlfriend” is a   citizen   and   resident  of

after having  worked  for the U.S. Government.  (TR at page  44 lines 10~20, and AppX A.)
1.b.  Applicant  has  one   friend   who   is  a   citizen   and   resident  of   South   Korea.  He
works for the  United States  Forces Korea  (USFK). Applicant  had  another friend  who  is a
citizen   and   resident   of   South   Korea.  This  past-friend   got  involved   in  receiving
“kickbacks”  from   contractors,  but  Applicant   has  had   no   contact  with   this  past-friend
since  about 2013, for nearly  a  decade. (TR at  page  35  line 13  to page  38  line  9, at page

I take administrative notice of certain facts re South Korea:
Notice
South  Korea  is  a  constitutional  democracy  governed  by  a  president  and  a
unicameral  legislature.  South  Korean  government  espionage  and  collection  activities
have  resulted  in  U.S.  criminal  prosecutions.  South  Korea  has  also  been  the
unauthorized  recipient  of  technology  controlled  under  U.S.  export  laws.  Finally,
industrial espionage remains a high-profile concern relating to South Korea and South
Korean companies. (GX I.)
",True
"The SOR alleges foreign influence security concerns based on Applicant’s mother-
in-law (SOR ¶ 1.a.), sister-in-law, and four brothers-in-law (who are citizens and residents
of Iraq). (SOR ¶ 1.b.) In his response to SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations
under  Guideline  B.  His  admissions  are  incorporated  herein  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a
careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  hearing  transcript,  and  exhibits,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact:
Applicant  is  48  years  old.  He  was  born  in  Mosul,  Iraq,  and  he  obtained  his
bachelor’s  degree  in  that  country  in  1997.  He  entered  the  United  States  illegally  in
December  2001,  and  he  was  held  in  a  detention  center  by  U.S.  immigration  until  his
hearing in May 2002. He requested political asylum at his hearing due to threats and three
detainments by members of the Ba’ath Party, of which he was not a member. His asylum
was granted. Beginning in March 2007, he served in the U.S. Army National Guard as a
military translator with the rank of Specialist (E-4). He deployed to Iraq in October 2008,
and  returned  to  the  U.S.  in  June  2009.  He  received  an  honorable  discharge  in  March
2010. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2009. His current translator employment
offer  with  a  federal  contractor  is  contingent  based  on  his  eligibility  for  a  DOD  security
clearance. (GE 1, GE 2, GE 3; Tr. 18-23, 30-31, 52-53)
Applicant was hired by a federal contractor for a linguist position in August 2006
and was terminated in February 2007. He told his supervisor that he needed to be moved
to  another  military  base  in  Iraq  because  the  current  base  was  too  dangerous.  His
supervisor told him he was needed at that base, but Applicant told him he could not stay
there. Applicant was fired by his employer and sent home. He was also hired by another
federal  contractor  in  March  2010  to  work  in  Iraq  as  a  translator.  He  was  fired  by  his
employer in August 2010, for violation of company policy and creating a hostile workplace.
Applicant admitted he was aware that he was not to have any type of relationship with
any foreign nationals in Iraq, but he became romantically involved with an Iraqi woman.
They  discussed  becoming  engaged  and  eventually  married.  He  failed  to  report  his
relationship to his employer. (Tr. 53-59; GE 2, GE 3)
In September 2010, he travelled to Damascus, Syria after his family arranged a
marriage for him with an Iraqi woman. He married his new wife in Syria and sponsored
her  for  a  Visa  to  the  U.S.,  which  she  entered  in  June  2011.  When  questioned  by
Department Counsel as to why he chose to travel to Syria to arrange a marriage with an
Iraqi woman rather than marry a U.S. citizen, Applicant stated “in our culture, you have to
marry [someone from the same tribe].” His wife is now a naturalized U.S. citizen, and they
have two daughters, ages seven and ten months. His wife returned to Iraq to visit family
in 2012 and 2015. He and his wife returned to Iraq in 2017 to attend the marriage of his
brother-in-law. They stayed at his mother-in-law’s house. (Tr. 18-19, 24-29, 31-32, 43-44,
58-59)
Applicant’s mother-in-law is a citizen and resident of Iraq. During his background
interview in October 2017, he told the authorized DOD investigator that he had contact
with her two times per week via telephone. He and his spouse regularly send her financial
assistance,  about  $250  every  three  or  four  months.  She  occasionally  works  as  a
housekeeper and is not affiliated with the Iraqi government or military. (Tr. 28, 36-37, 42,
50-51)
Applicant’s  spouse’s  two   older  brothers   (B-in-law  1  and  2)  are  citizens  and
residents of Iraq. During his background interview in October 2017, he told the authorized
DOD investigator that he and his wife have contact with them about every two or three
months. One of her brothers is employed as a soldier with the Nineveh Protection Unit
(NPU), which is affiliated with the Iraqi military. One  of his wife’s  younger brothers (B-in-
law 3) moved to Canada and married in 2019. He is an Iraqi citizen currently residing in
Canada. Her other younger brother (B-in-law 4) and her sister (S-in-law) are citizens and
residents of Iraq. Applicant reported to the investigator that he and his wife have contact
with these family members weekly, and they are not affiliated with any foreign government
or  military.  The   investigator  questioned   Applicant  as  to   why   he   failed   to   list  his  wife’s
siblings on the security clearance application (SCA) or during his counterintelligence (CI)
interview  in  August  2017.  Applicant  stated  that  he  intentionally  failed  to  report  these
individuals because he did not want his security clearance investigation to take any longer
than necessary. (GE 1, GE 2, GE 3; Tr. 37-41)

Applicant  was  interviewed  again  by  two  DOD  authorized  investigators  in  June
2018. There were discrepant facts reported in his previous background investigations that
required  additional  information.  During  the  course  of  the  interview,  the  reporting
investigator  noticed  that  Applicant  was  getting  irritable  with  their  questions.  Applicant
repeatedly stated that the investigators were asking too many questions. Also, on a few
occasions, he extended his arm and pointed his finger very close to an investigator’s face,
stating  in  a  very  loud  voice,  “You’re  asking  too  many  questions.”  At  one  point  during
questioning, the investigator abruptly stopped the interview after Applicant got up from
his chair shouting and displaying aggressive behavior. Applicant was told that if he did
not calm down, he would be escorted out of the facility. He was also given a ten-minute
break to get his emotions under control before the interview continued. Applicant received
the investigative reports from both background interviews. He certified with his signature
that the investigative records were reported accurately. (GE 2; Tr. 46-50)
Administrative Notice
I have taken administrative notice of the following facts concerning Iraq:
The Federal Republic of Iraq (Iraq) is a constitutional parliamentary republic. The
U.S. Department of State warns U.S. citizens not to travel to Iraq due to terrorism and
armed conflict. U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high risk for violence and kidnapping. Numerous
terrorist and insurgent groups are active in Iraq and regularly attack both Iraqi security
forces  and  civilians.  The  Islamic  State  in  Iraq  and  Syria  (ISIS),  a  designated  terrorist
organization,  remains a  threat to public safety in  Iraq.  Additionally,  criminal gangs and
local militia pose a potential threat to U.S. citizens. In February 2018, the U.S. Director of
National Intelligence (DNI) concluded that, given the ongoing presence of ISIS and Iran-
supported militants, Iraq will likely face a lengthy period of political turmoil and conflict.
(AN I)
Iraq’s  most  significant  human  rights  abuses  are  largely  fueled  by  the  terrorist
activities of ISIS; however, some Iraqi security forces were alleged to have engaged in
unlawful  killings,  disappearances  and  extortion,  torture,  life-threatening  conditions  in
detention and prison facilities, and arbitrary arrest and detention. (AN I)
The United States’ commitment to Iraq is balanced against the inherent dangers
of the ongoing conflict in Iraq to its citizens and residents from terrorists and significant
human rights issues. (AN 1)

"The SOR alleges foreign influence security concerns based on Applicant’s brother
(SOR ¶ 1.a.), two half-brothers (SOR ¶ 1.b.), two sisters (SOR ¶ 1.c.), six sisters-in-law
(SOR  ¶  1.d.),  and  his  mother-in-law (SOR  ¶  1.h.),  who  are  citizens  and  residents  of
Djibouti. The SOR alleges additional foreign influence concerns based on his six brothers-
in-law,  also  citizens  and  residents  of  Djibouti,  with  two  of  them  serving  in  the  Djibouti
military,  and  one  serving  in  the  Djibouti  Republican  Guard.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.e-1.g.)  In  his
response  to  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  allegations  under  Guideline  B.  His
admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.
The SOR also alleges foreign preference security concerns based on Applicant’s
intent  to  permanently  relocate  his  family  to  Djibouti  (SOR  ¶  2.a.)  and  his  active
membership in the Movement of Democratic Renewal (MRD), a Djibouti opposition party
(SOR ¶ 2.b.). Applicant denied both Guideline C allegations. After a careful review of the
pleadings, hearing transcript, and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant is 43 years old. He was born in Djibouti. He married his spouse in Djibouti
in 2006. He entered the U.S. in 2013, and both he and his wife became naturalized U.S.
citizens in 2019. They have three children, one a naturalized U.S. citizen, and the other
two U.S. citizens by virtue of their birth in the United States. His employment offer for a
linguist position with a federal contractor is contingent on his eligibility for a DOD security
clearance. (GE 1, GE 2, GE 3; Tr. 23, 73)
Applicant has regular contact with some of his family members in Djibouti, and he
talks with his sister approximately twice monthly. His spouse has frequent, almost daily,
contact with her mother and some of her siblings. Over the years he has been contacted
by several nieces, nephews, siblings, and his spouse’s siblings for financial support. He
has  provided  occasional  financial  assistance  to  these  family  members,  and  he  has
provided regular financial support ($200-$300 monthly) to his mother-in-law since 2013.
Several family members are civil servants employed by the government of Djibouti, two
serve in the Djibouti military, and one serves for the Republican Guard. (GE 1, GE 2, GE
3; Tr. 23-46)
In approximately 2002, while Applicant worked in Djibouti as a teacher, he joined
the  MRD,  a  political  party  opposed  to  the  current  Djibouti  government.  The  MRD  was
declared illegal by the Djibouti government. In 2010, Applicant was arrested for being an
activist in the MRD. He was held in prison awaiting trial. After being incarcerated for about
a month in inhumane conditions, his family was able to have Applicant released while his
trial was pending. He immediately fled the country and illegally entered Ethiopia to escape
his pending criminal trial and possible imprisonment. After about two months, he illegally
re-entered Djibouti, and hid himself from police while waiting to hear the status of his wife
and daughter, who had left Djibouti, and applied for asylum in the United States. In April
2012, he secretly left Djibouti and illegally crossed over to Ethiopia with the help of drug
smugglers. For approximately one year he worked with the U.S. Embassy in Ethiopia until
he was eventually provided travel documents to enter the U.S. based on a spousal visa.
(Tr. 47-62, 66-67; GE 2, GE 3)
In September 2010, Applicant’s wife and  their two-year-old daughter entered the
United States on a tourist visa. His wife was about two months pregnant at the time. She
applied for asylum due to political persecution in Djibouti, which was granted by the U.S.
She  remained  in  the  United  States  while  Applicant  was  a  fugitive,  secretly  hiding  and
traveling between Ethiopia and Djibouti to avoid police detection. His spouse sponsored
Applicant to come to the U.S. In March 2013, Applicant arrived in the U.S. and rejoined
his family. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in September 2019. (Tr. 63-71; GE 2,
GE 3)
Applicant  did not go  to  trial for his pending  criminal charge  in Djibouti. Since  April
2012, he has never returned  to  that country. It  is his belief that if he did return to  Djibouti
in the  future  he  would  no  longer be  considered  a  fugitive  by  the Djibouti government  since
he  was not an  important or high-ranking  leader in the  MRD.  The  mission  of  MRD  is to
promote  democratic values. In  Djibouti  there  are restrictive  voter-registration  laws,  and
the  elections  are not fair. He continued  to  participate  in  the  MRD  upon  his arrival in the
U.S.   in  2013,  but he   stopped  all   participation   in  the   MRD   in  2018.  It   is his intention   to
continue  to  promote democratic values,  not only  to  the  people  of Djibouti, but also to  the
people in  Africa  living  in countries  that are not democratic.  He  believed  his status as a
U.S. citizen  also  bolstered  his  conviction  to  make  all  governments fair  through  the  means
of democracy. (Tr. 58-63; GE 2; AE A)
During  Applicant’s  January  2020  background  interview,  he  told  the  DOD
authorized investigator that after his 2010 arrest, he went into hiding for about ten days,
but he was picked up by the police again. He was fingerprinted and released. He told the
investigator that the reason he was smuggled by drug dealers out of Djibouti was due to
him  being  a  teacher,  since  it  was  illegal  for  teachers  to  leave  the  country.  During  the
hearing Department Counsel questioned Applicant about why he failed to mention to the
investigator  that  he  illegally  fled  the  country  due  to  a  pending  criminal  trial  for  his
participation in an illegal opposition political party and his fear of imprisonment in Djibouti.
Applicant responded that he did not recall that information at the time he participated in
his background interview. (Tr. 72-76; GE 3)
Applicant also told the investigator during his January 2020 background interview
that he  did  not  want  to  renounce his Djibouti  citizenship  because  possibly one  day he
would like to return to Djibouti, perhaps even retire there. His loyalty was equally divided
between Djibouti and the United States.  During another interview Applicant stated  that
renouncing his foreign citizenship would prevent him from being an effective advocate for
the  Djibouti  people.  In  his  June  2021  response  to  DOHA  interrogatories,  Applicant
reported that Djibouti is currently unsafe for him and his family. The only way he would
live in this country again depended on the establishment of a new democratic government
in Djibouti free from dictatorship. (GE 3; Tr. 82-89)
In November 2020, Applicant participated in a counterintelligence (CI) interview by
the U.S. Army. During the interview Applicant told the investigator that his wife applied for
asylum in the U.S. due to her being a woman educator (not due to political persecution).
Applicant was asked if he had ever been in any country illegally; if he had ever served in
any foreign political party; had he ever been held against his will by a foreign government;
and whether he had ever been arrested, held, detained, or imprisoned in any country?
Applicant responded  “NO” to  all of  the  questions listed  above. He failed to disclose his
2010 arrest in Djibouti; being held in a severely over-crowded jail for approximately one
month before he was released; and his fleeing from the country to avoid prosecution in a
pending criminal trial with possible imprisonment. (GE 2)
During  the  hearing,  Applicant  stated  that  if  the  U.S.  government  wanted  him  to
renounce his Djibouti citizenship in order to receive a DOD security clearance, he would
be willing to do so. He also stated his loyalty was to the U.S. only. Department Counsel
questioned  Applicant  about  his  significant  change  of  heart  concerning  his  earlier
statements  provided  during  his  background  investigation.  Applicant  testified  that  he
changed his mind about his previous beliefs after he received the SOR. (Tr. 82-89)
Administrative Notice
I have taken administrative notice of the following facts concerning Djibouti:
The  2020  Humans  Rights  report  identified  Djibouti  as  a  republic  with  a  strong
elected  president  and  a  weak  legislature.  Djibouti  has  a  multiparty  political  system  in
which  parties  must  be  registered  and  recognized  by  the  ruling  authorities.  There  are
restrictive voter registration laws, voter intimidation, inadequate ballot security, and lack
of opposition observers. Most opposition groups did not characterize the past presidential
elections as free and fair. Political power is shared by Djibouti’s two largest ethnic groups,
the Somali-Issas and Afars.
Significant  human  rights  issues  included:  unlawful  or  arbitrary  killings  including
extrajudicial killings; cases of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment by
the government; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; arbitrary arrest or detention;
arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy; serious restrictions on free expression, the
press,  and  the  internet,  including violence, threats of  violence, or unjustified  arrests or
prosecutions against journalists, censorship, site blocking, and the existence of criminal
libel laws; substantial interference with the freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of
association; and the worst forms of child labor committed throughout the country.
The  United  States’ extraordinary commitment to Djibouti is balanced against the
inherent  dangers  of  the  ongoing  conflict  in  Djibouti  to  its  citizens  and  residents  and
significant human rights issues. (AN 1)

"The  SOR  alleges  that:  Applicant’s  immediate  family  relatives  are  citizens  and
residents of South  Korea  (SOR 1.a  through 1.c); Applicant’s  extended family members
are  residents  and  citizens  of  South  Korea  (SOR  1.d);  Applicant  assisted  his  cousin,  a
citizen of South Korea, with his business matters (SOR 1.e); and 14  persons (SOR 1.f
through  1.t),  citizens  (not  residents)  of  South  Korea,  are  Applicant’s  friends  holding

(emphasis added)
In  his  February  19,  2021  answer  to  the  February  5,  2021  SOR,  Applicant
admitted SOR 1.a through 1.o, 1.q, and 1.t. He denied SOR 1.p, 1.r, and 1.s.
In  his  May  2021  amended  answer  to  the  undated  amended  SOR,  Applicant
changed  several  of  his  original  answers.  He  admitted  SOR  1.a,  1.b,  1.d,  and  1.e.
However,  unlike  his  February  2021  answer,  he  denied  SOR  1.c  (brothers-in-law  and
sister-in-law), stating that “several sisters-in-law have either passed away or are citizens
or  residents  of  the  United  States.”  Though  admitting  1.f  through  1.s,  and  1.q,  he
objected  to  the  terminology  in  each  of  the  allegations  describing  these  persons  as
“friends”  in  the  February  2021  SOR.  He  denied  SOR  1.p,  1.r,  and  1.s.  Unlike  his
February  2021  answer  to  SOR  1.t,  he  denied  SOR  1.t  in  his  May  2021  amended
answer,  claiming  that  the  account  is  in  his  name  and  confirming  (without  supporting
documentation) there is less than $300 in that account. He noted that “we  do not have
any  substantial  interests  in  Korea,  or  in  any  foreign  business…”  (May  2021  answer  to
the SOR)
In  his  May  2021  amended  answer,  Applicant  denied  SOR  1.u,  explaining  his
rights to the annuity and indicating the retirement contributions are too small to create a
conflict  of  interest.  In  his  response  to  SOR  1.v,  Applicant  emphasized  that  he  never
provided any services for any foreign government. In working for previous law firms, he
provided  legal  services  for  firm  clients  located  in  foreign  countries,  and  not  foreign
countries.  He  no  longer  works  for  these  firms.  In  examining  the  record  in  this  case,  I
observed  Applicant’s demeanor as  I  listened  to  his  testimony.  I  found his testimony to
be generally credible. The discrepancies between his testimony and the information that
he  provided  on  the  same  person  during  the  background  investigation  are  reduced  in
significance by the volume and short relationship of most of the contacts (more than 50)
that  Applicant  reported  in  his  October  2017  security  clearance  application  and  his
interrogatory answers in June 2020. See GE 1 and GE 2.
In  1972,  Applicant  was  born  in  the  United  States  to  Korean  parents  who  are
naturalized U.S. citizens, and who have lived in this country for 40 years. He does not
regard  himself  as  a  dual  citizen  of  another  country.  He  has  a  U.S.  passport  and  has
never  been  issued  a  passport  by  another  country;  his  wife  has  a  South  Korean
passport, but as a homemaker she does not travel. He received his bachelor’s degree in
1994  and  his  juris doctor’s degree  in  1997.  He passed two bars in two states and  has
been a practicing attorney for at least 22 years.  He married his wife in June 1999. His
21-year-old  daughter  was  born  in  the  United  States.  His  19-year-old  son  was  born  in
South Korea, but is a naturalized U.S. citizen. Applicant’s family lives in a home that he
purchased in 2007. (GE 1 at 5-10, 18-23 133; Tr. 16, 35-36; February 2021 answer to
SOR)
Applicant  has  practiced  law  as  a  sole  practitioner  since  2014.  From  August
2009  to  December  2013,  he  was  an  attorney  working  for  a  U.S.  law  firm.  From  June
2001 to June 2006 he lived and taught courses in South Korea. From July 2006 to May
2008, and May 2009 to December 2013, he conducted remote lectures from the United
States  while  a  member  of  a  U.S.  law  firm.  Applicant  has  never  been  investigated  or
possessed  a  security  clearance.  The  reason  why  he  is  seeking  eligibility  is  that  he
wants to spend less time traveling and transition to a new job in information technology
(IT) that contributes to the stability of the United States in some fashion. His sponsor is
a  defense  contractor  dedicated  to  research  and  information  systems.  (GE  1  at  11-15,
133-134; GE 2 at 6-9; Tr. 37-38, 72-74)
SOR  1.a  –  Applicant’s  wife  was  born  in  South  Korea  in  1972.  She  is  still
registered as a permanent resident of the United States because she is fearful of taking
the naturalization test. In 1999, she married Applicant in the United States. She became
a  permanent  resident  of  this  country  in  2000  and  began  living  with  Applicant  and
working as a computer art designer in the same year. Next, she found a job as a rater
for a social media company. She discontinued employment in the early 2000s to devote
complete attention to raising their two children. Applicant’s wife intends to remain in the
United States. (GE 1 at 18-20; Tr. 41-43)
SOR 1.b – Applicant’s mother-in-law is 86 years old and a citizen and resident
of  South Korea. His father-in-law passed away in 2013. The mother-in-law is 86  years
old and lives in an assisted living facility which Applicant’s wife’s oldest brother pays for.
Neither Applicant nor his wife  provide financial  assistance  to his mother-in-law.  She  is
retired  from  employment  at  a  Korean  publishing  company.  Applicant  has  not  spoken
with  her for three  or four years. His  wife’s last  communication  with  her was  during  the
winter holidays in 2021, and was sporadic before that time because her mother had her
cell  phone  confiscated.  Applicant’s  wife  has  visited  her  mother  twice  since  2005.  The
mother-in-law has no affiliation with a foreign government or military. (GE 1 at 25-28; Tr.
44-47)
SOR 1.c – Applicant admitted the allegation in his February 2021 answer to the
SOR, but he provided little information about his three brothers-in-law, and two sisters-
in-law. He stated only that he had not communicated with most of them for a long time.
In  his  May  2021  answer,  he  denied  the  allegation,  claiming  that  several  sisters-in-law
had  died  or  become U.S.  citizens.  He  did  not  identify  the  sisters-in-law who  had  died,
and those who were still living.
Applicant’s oldest brother-in-law is a citizen and resident of South Korea. He is
65  years old and  chief  operating officer (CEO)  of  a  South  Korean company.  He  is not
affiliated with any foreign government or military. He pays the costs of the assisted living
facility of  his mother. (SOR  1.b)  His  wife is 60  years old and also a  resident  citizen of
South  Korea.  The  record  does  not  reveal  her  occupation.  Applicant  has  quarterly
contact  with  these  persons  by  phone  and  in  person.  As  noted  above,  he  provided
negligible  additional  information  about  two  of  his  other  two  brothers-in-law  and  two
sisters-in-law. He indicated he has no contact with them because they are not fluent in
the English language and they generally do not correspond. (GE 1 at 30-33; Tr. 47)
SOR 1.d  –  Applicant has two  cousins who  are resident citizens of  South  Korea.
The  first  cousin  is  president  of an  international school of  law  (SOR 1.e) where Applicant
worked  from  2001  through  2006.  The  second  cousin  (unalleged) is  employed  at another
South   Korean   law   school.  Neither   cousin  is   affiliated   with   any   foreign   government   or
military.  Except  for  the   two   cousins  described   above,  all   of  Applicant’s  other  aunts,
uncles,  and  cousins on  his mother’s side  live  in the  United  States.   Reference  D and  E,
U.S.  citizens,  are  first cousins of  Applicant.  (GE  1  at  35-38; Tr.  17-18; Applicant’s May
2021 answer to  the SOR)
Applicant’s wife’s niece, the  daughter of Applicant’s oldest  brother-in-law, is 34
years old,  and  a  citizen  and  resident on  South  Korea. Applicant contacts her when  he  is
visiting  the  country. There is no  information  about her occupation  or her marital status,
but she  is not affiliated  with  a  foreign  government or military. Applicant’s wife’s  31-year-
old niece  is also a  citizen  and  resident of South  Korea. She  works for a  pension  fund,
but  Applicant   does  not  know   if   she   is   connected   to   a   foreign   government   or  military.
Applicant interacts with  them  during  his visits on  special  occasions  to  South  Korea. (GE
1   at  32-35)  Applicant  does   not  know   how   many   cousins  his  wife   has  in  South   Korea,
and  is not close  with  any  of  them. He was fairly  certain that his wife  was not close  with
any of them either. Applicant did not identify any of the cousins.  (Tr. 48-49)
SOR 1.e – In his February 2021 answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted that he
assisted  his  cousin  (referred  to  in  SOR  1.d  above),  a  resident  citizen  of  South  Korea
and president of an international school of law, with his business matters. Applicant also
taught U.S. law in the English language between 2001 and 2006, and has not provided
teaching assistance since then, but was still providing legal advice until October 2017.
He contacts his cousin on a quarterly basis, by phone, in person, or social media. (GE 1
at 35-38, 108; Tr. 18, 49-50)
Applicant’s  other  cousin  (referenced  above  in  SOR  1.d  and  unalleged),  a
resident  of  South  Korea,  is  a  professor  employed  by  a  South  Korean  law  school.
Applicant  has  never  had  any  business  relationship  with  this  cousin.  Their  contact  with
each  other  occurs  when  they  are  visiting  each  other’s  country.  This  cousin  has  no
affiliation with a foreign government or military. (GE 1 at 35-38; Tr. 49-50)
SOR  1.f  –  In  Applicant’s  February  2021  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  viewed  the
former South Korean prosecutor as an acquaintance  while  in the United States. In his
May 2021 answer, Applicant objected to the former prosecutor described as a “friend” in
the allegation. They met at Applicant’s U.S. church in the same way Applicant met most
of  the  other  persons  listed  in  SOR  1.f  through  1.s.  Applicant’s  last  contact  with  the
individual was  in 2017, five  years ago  at  Applicant’s former church. Applicant believes
the  former  prosecutor  has  returned  to  South  Korea.  (Tr.  50-52;  Applicant’s  May  2021
answer to the SOR)
SOR  1.g  –  Applicant  initially  met  the  South  Korean  citizen  employed  by  the
country’s  communications  commission  while  Applicant  was  employed  at  the  U.S.  law
firm  (2009-2013).  The  firm  arranged  seminars  in  intellectual  property.  This  person,  a
resident  citizen  of  South  Korea,  attended  a  seminar  where  the  two  had  contact.
Applicant  does  not  know  whether  the  communications  commission  is  a  government
entity. He has had no contact with this person since 2014. (Tr. 53-57)
SOR 1.h –  Applicant’s first contact with the South Korean citizen employed by
the  ministry  of  finance  began  in  2010  or  2011  at  Applicant’s  church  when  the  person
was temporarily living in the United States for two years.  Applicant communicates with
this individual whenever he visits South Korea. With their families living two blocks from
one  another  and  having  their  children  attend  the  same  schools  in  their  U.S
neighborhood,  I  find  that  their  relationship  was  more  than  at  an  acquaintance  level,
even  though  the  close  relationship  ended  in  about  2013,  when  Applicant  believes  this
person returned to South Korea. Applicant’s wife has never interacted with  the minister
of finance. Applicant does not know whether the individual still has the government job.
In  October  2017,  Applicant  considered  his  phone  and  face-to-face  contact  with  this
person as quarterly. (GE 1 at 59; Tr. 55-57)
Applicant  has  had  contact  with  a  second  South  Korean  citizen  working  as  a
manager for the South Korean ministry of finance (unalleged). His interaction occurred
between  2014  and  2017,  when  this  person  returned  to  South  Korea.  Applicant  has
never participated in business ventures with this person. (GE 1 at 69-70; Tr. 56-57)
SOR  1.i  –  Applicant’s  relationship  with  the  South  Korean  citizen  employed  by
the ministry of land, infrastructure, and transportation, lasted about the same length of
time as SOR 1.h. Applicant had no further connection to the individual after he returned
to South Korea in 2017. (GE 1 at 59-60; Tr. 57-58)
SOR  1.j  –  In  his  February  2021  answer  that  the  South  Korean  citizen  was
employed  by  the  Korean  intellectual  office.  However,  in  his  May  2021  answer,  he
claimed  without  explanation,  that  the  South  Korean  citizen  was  an  employee  in  the
Korean  patent  office.  Applicant’s  association  with  the  person  identified  in  SOR  1.j
initially began  at his U.S.  church  and  occurred  in the  same manner as his  association
with  the  persons  described  in  SOR  1.h  and  1.i.  He  described  his  contact  with  this
person occurs annually when one visits the other’s country. (GE 1 at 67-68; Tr. 58)
SOR 1.k – Applicant met the South Korean citizen, an employee of the Korean
ministry  of  foreign  affairs,  at  his  U.S.  church  in  2012  or  2013.  In  2016,  this  person
returned  to  South  Korea.  The  only  occasions  of  additional  contact  occur  sporadically
when  Applicant  is  visiting  Korea.  Applicant  indicated  that  he  had  never  had  financial
contact with this individual. (GE 1 at 73-74; Tr. 58-59)
SOR  1.l  –  Applicant  met  the  South  Korean  citizen,  a  reporter  working  for  a
Korean daily publication, at his U.S. church in 2010. There has been no further contact
with this person since 2011. (GE 1 at 71-72; Tr. 59-60)
SOR. 1.m  –  In about 2012,  a South Korean citizen,  a former major general in
the  country’s  military,  met  at  the  same  U.S.  church  where  Applicant  met  the  previous
South  Koreans,  except  for the  person  identified  at  SOR  1.g.  Applicant  saw the former
major  general  regularly  until  the  former  military  person  returned  to  South  Korea  in
approximately 2017. Applicant does not know whether this person worked in a position
for  the  South  Korean  Embassy.  He  speculated  that  this  individual  was  working  for  a
think tank. (GE 1 at 76-77; Tr. 60-62)
SOR  1.n  –  This  individual,  a  South  Korean  citizen,  served  in  the  Korean  Air
Force  and  currently  works  for  the  Korean  government  defense  acquisition  program.
Applicant apparently met him about 2011 in the U.S. church, and the last time he spoke
with this person was in 2012, with no communication after this person returned to South
Korea in 2017. Based on the number of foreign contacts that Applicant reported in his e-
QIP and his June 2020 interrogatory answers, I find Applicant was mistaken about the
last time he had contact with this individual. (GE 1 at 82-83; GE 2; Tr. 62)
SOR 1.o  –  This individual,  a  citizen  of South  Korea,  worked  for the  ministry  of
information   and   technology.  Applicant   surmised   that  he   remembered   this  person   from
the church, but was not sure. Applicant’s recollection of this individual was hazy.  (Tr. 62-
63)
SOR 1.p – This person, a citizen of South Korea, worked as the South Korean
Ambassador  to  the  United  States.  Applicant  met  him  in  2014  at  the  U.S.  church,  but
could not recall when this person returned to South Korea. Applicant never had financial
dealings or a professional relationship with this person, but knows that he is no longer
the Ambassador. (GE 1 at 115; Tr. 63-64; May 2021 answer to SOR)
SOR  1.q –  This person, a  citizen of  South Korea,  was  employed  as  a military
priest  in  the  country.  After  meeting  at  Applicant’s  U.S.  church,  the  priest  conducted
religious  ceremonies  at  Applicant’s  church.  Applicant  saw  him  weekly  at  church
between  2014  and  2017,  and  sees  him  occasionally  during  his  visits  to  South  Korea.
Applicant  could  not  recall  whether  this  person  was  still  in  the  military.  I  find  that
Applicant  was  mistaken  when  he  testified  seeing  the  priest  only  once  in  South  Korea.
Based  on  the  regularity  of  contacts  in  the  United  States  and  sporadic  interactions  in
South Korea, I find that Applicant’s relationship with the priest was more than simply an
acquaintance. (GE 74-76; Tr. 64-65)
SOR  1.r  –  Friends,  citizens  of  South  Korea,  work  for  the  South  Korean
federation  of  fisheries.  In  both  answers  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  denied  the  allegation
because  his  contacts retired  from  the  organization  between  2016 and  2018.  Applicant
explained  that  he  met  them  through  a  client  who  wanted  to  organize  an  office  in  the
United States. His contact with them began in February 2017 and ended in September
of  the  same  year.  Applicant  is  unsure  what  type  of  office  they  wanted  to  establish.
Applicant does not believe the fisheries is an agency of the South Korean government,
but rather a co-operative. (Tr. 65-67)
SOR 1.s – The allegation reads that Applicant’s South Korean friends, who are
citizens  of  the  country,  currently  work  for  a Korean  trade  promotion  agency.  Applicant
denied  this  allegation.  He  met  these  individuals  through  his  church  and  not  through
professional interaction. They were not potential clients. Except for SOR 1.q, Applicant’s
frequency  of  contact  was  minimal  during  the  time  these  listed  individuals  lived  in  the
United States. (Tr. 67-68) See also, Applicant’s May 2021 answer to SOR 1.s.
SOR 1.t – Applicant opened two or three bank accounts in 2001 to deposit his
wages.  The  only  account  still  open  is  described  in  his  October  2017  e-QIP.  Since  he
moved back to the United States in 2006, he has maintained no more than $1,000 in the
South  Korean  account  which  he  uses  to  pay  for  transportation  in  trips  around  the
country. (GE 1 at 101-102; GE 2 at 18; Tr. 68-69)
SOR  1.u  –  Applicant  denied  that  he  will  receive  an  annuity  from  the  South
Korea  university  based  on  his  employment at  the  university  from  2001  to  2006.  In  his
May 2021 answer, he averred that the retirement pension does not show a preference
for South Korea over the United States. He pointed out that the future pension was not
substantial  and  would  not  cause  a  conflict  of  interest.  Applicant  provided  more  focus
about  the  pension  in  his  testimony  asserting  his  right  to  the  money  (less  than  one
percent  of  his  earnings  while  employed  in  South  Korea)  once  he  retires  as  a  U.S.
citizen. (May 2021 answer to the SOR; GE 1 at 20-22; Tr. 24-25, 28-30, 69-71)
SOR 1.v  –  Applicant denied  he served as a consultant,  or that he  provided legal
or intellectual property  services for foreign  countries,  including  South  Korea  and  Japan,
from   2010   to   the   present.   In   his  May   2021   answer  to   the   SOR,  Applicant  stated   that
while employed at previous law firms, he provided legal services for firm clients based in
foreign   countries,  rather  than   foreign   countries.  In   2016,  a   Korean   organization
responsible   for  sponsoring   startups   through   education   and   training,  sponsored   an
American  company  not affiliated  with  the  Korean  government.  The  American  company
hired   Applicant  to   provide   lectures  in  intellectual  property   law   over  a   six-week  period.
Ultimately,  Applicant   was  hired   by   four  Korean   startup   companies  to   do   trademark
registration   for  them,  and   was  paid   on   a   flat  fee   basis   about  $1,000   per  company.
Without explaining  the  basis for his conclusion, he  determined  there was no  conflict of
interest   because   none   of   the   startup   companies  were  controlled   by   the   organization
providing   the   training   and   education   for  the   startup   companies  or  the   Korean
government.  See   GE   1   at  109;  GE   2   at  18-19.   Considering   the   lack  of   evidence
demonstrating   that   Applicant   performed   legal  services  for  a   foreign   country,  I   find   no
potential  conflict  of   interest   to   Applicant’s  potential  security   responsibilities   that  would
increase  the  risk of  a  compromise of  classified  or sensitive  information. Therefore, SOR
1.v is resolved in Applicant’s favor under both the  foreign influence and outside  activities
guidelines.
In  addition  to  his  South  Korean  bank  account  (Tr.  68),  Applicant’s  family  was
eligible  for  medical  benefits  (unalleged)  provided  by  the  Korean  health  care  system
based  on  his  South  Korean  employment  between  2001  and  2006.  Those  medical
benefits expired in December 2018. (GE 1 at 103)
Applicant’s net U.S. earnings for 2019 and 2020 were about $200,000. His U.S.
financial  assets  include  a  home  worth  about $1,000,000,  with  approximately $320,000
remaining  on  the  mortgage.  His  U.S.  checking  and  savings  accounts  total  about
$150,000.  He  has  $80,000  to  $100,000  in  his  retirement  income  accounts.  He  began
accruing  his  bank  and  retirement  accounts  in  1999  when  he  moved  to  the  United
States. Applicant and his wife have two cars. Since he ended his teaching job in 2006,
Applicant has returned to South Korea about every two years for professional reasons,
for conferences and seminars, or to visit family and friends. (GE 1 at 115-130; Tr. 31-40,

Reference  C  is  an  attorney  with  prior  military  service,  having  served  the  U.S
military for 12 years. Reference C has known Applicant since 2009 and worked with him
on legal matters involving Korean clients. As a practicing attorney, Applicant has always
complying  with  professional  responsibility  rules.  Reference  C  vouches  for  Applicant’s
responsible and trustworthy behavior. (AE C)
Reference  D,  a  U.S.  citizen  by  birth,  is  Applicant’s  first  cousin.  They  have
known one another since early childhood and were roommates in college. Reference D
indicated that he and Applicant have six aunts and uncles living in the United States. No
additional  information  was  provided  identifying  their  residency  status.  According  to
reference  D,  18 of  the children  of  the  six aunts  and  uncles  are  U.S.  citizens  (cousins)
living in the Eastern part of the United States, and most are married. (The description of
the 18 cousins implies that there are remaining cousins who are not U.S citizens, or are
living in a foreign country.) Reference  D considers Applicant a trustworthy person who
demonstrates that he cares about the future of his children. (AE D)
Reference  E,  Applicant’s  first  cousin  and  a  U.S  citizen,  has  known  him  since
childhood. Their mothers are sisters who have lived in a city in the eastern part of the
United States for approximately 40 years. They attended college together. Reference E
lives in the same U.S. county as Applicant and interacts with him at social and sporting
events. (AE E)
Reference  F,  a  U.S.  citizen  and  priest  of  a  U.S.  church,  has  known  Applicant
since 2008 when reference F was the priest of  another U.S. church (Church X) where
Applicant  met  most  of  the  individuals  identified  in  SOR  1f.  through  1.s.  Church  X
conducts religious services in four different languages.
Church  X  had  Korean  members  from  the  Korean  Embassy,  Korean  news
organizations,  and  Korean  companies.  Generally,  these  Korean  members  would  cycle
through the local area for two or three years before returning to Korea. As members of
Church  X,  according  to  the  reference  F,  Applicant  and  his  wife  were  active  in  church
activities,  like  hosting  prayers  and  fundraising.  Applicant  has  established  no  fresh
contacts  with  persons  affiliated  with  the  Korean  government  since  he  applied  for  a
security  clearance.  Based  on  his  dependability  and  integrity,  reference  F  attests  to
Applicant’s security clearance eligibility. (AE F)
Reference G is the director of a federal records agency, with 45 years of U.S.
military and civilian service. He has possessed several security clearances in that time.
He  has  known  Applicant  since  2000.  Their  wives  are  sisters.  Before  reference  G
received higher level security clearances, his background investigation included scrutiny
of  his immediate  and extended family members, as  well as Applicant’s  immediate  and

Administrative Notice  –  Republic of Korea
The Republic of South Korea is a stable constitutional democracy, governed by
a  president  and  a  unicameral  legislature.  The  country  has  been  close  allies  with  the
United States since 1950. Currently, thousands of U.S. service persons are stationed in
South Korea, and the two countries have periodically conducted military exercises.
Although South Korea has strong bilateral relations with the United States, the
country  has  been  involved  in  multiple  incidents  of  government  espionage  and
intelligence  collection  activities  that  have  resulted  in  U.S  criminal  proceedings.  South
Korea is one of the most active countries involved in industrial espionage directed at the
United States.
The South Korean Government generally respects human rights and the rule of
law.  Though  persistent  problems  with  discrimination  against  women,  persons  with
disabilities,  and  minorities,  percolate  occasionally,  the  country’s  record  demonstrates
that it values the importance of human rights.

"Applicant  is  a  67-year-old  part-time  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has
worked for that employer since 2019. He is married with two children. (Item 4-6)
Applicant graduated from a military academy in 1979. He then served on active
duty in the U.S. military until he retired with an honorable discharge as an O-6 in 2005.
From 2005 to 2013, he worked for a U.S. company that provided consulting services to
a defense contractor from Country A. In 2013, he accepted a position as senior director
of marketing for the same Country A defense contractor’s U.S.-based affiliate company,
which  is  owned  by  the  parent  company  in  Country  A.  The  U.S.-based  affiliate  is  a
limited liability company (LLC) that is registered in the United States. Applicant’s duties
have  included  providing  unclassified  briefings  to  the  United  States  and  other  allied
nations  on  the  capabilities  of  the  company’s  weapons  systems.  He  also  traveled  to
other countries for trade shows and briefings. (Items 3-6)
Applicant  held  a  security  clearance  throughout  his  time  in  the  U.S.  military  and
while  working  for  the  U.S.  company  from  2005  to  2013.  It  lapsed  when  he  left  that
employment. He applied for a security clearance with Country A in 2013 and 2015, but it
was denied in 2017. (Items 3-6)
In   2019,  Applicant   accepted   a   part-time   position   with   a   U.S.  defense   contractor
while   continuing   to   hold  his  position   with   the   Country   A   company’s  U.S.  affiliate.   The
U.S.  defense   contractor   has   a   contract  with   Country   A   to   integrate   the   Country   A
company’s  weapons  system   into   the   U.S.-built  F-35   aircraft.   (Items   3-5)   The   F-35   is a
family  of fighter jets.  It  is made  in the  United  States,  but  some  parts and  weapons  are
made by  various NATO and other allied countries who have bought the jets.
Applicant stated that for him to properly address the U.S. DOD requirements for
the  Country  A  company’s  product,  he  occasionally  will  need  to  attend  classified
meetings.  He  is  supporting  the  U.S.  defense  company  as  a  weapons  subject  matter
expert  for  their  contract  with  Country A.  A  security  clearance  will  enable  him  to  better
serve  the  U.S.  company  in  addressing  U.S.  Government  requirements  for  integration
and operation of a weapon from Country A into the F-35 aircraft. (Items 3-5)

electronic  wire  transfers  totaling  $1,000.  When  the  Scammer  refused  to  destroy  the
compromising  data  unless  Applicant  sent  him  even  more  money,  Applicant  refused  to
send  additional  funds  and  blocked  the  Scammer  from  communicating  with  him.
Applicant  also  made  his  profile  and  friends  lists  on  social  media  private.  In  February
2019,  Applicant  self-reported  this  extortion  to  his  security  officer  at  his  place  of
employment. Applicant’s employer created an incident report, but took no further  action
against  Applicant  related  to  this  incident.  Applicant’s  family,  his  roommate,  and  his
employer  are  aware  of  this  incident.  Applicant  claims  that  he  has  learned  a  valuable
lesson from being extorted online and claims that he takes more precaution with whom
he decides to correspond when he uses dating websites. He also claims that he has not
been the subject of additional instances of online scams or extortion. (Items 1, 2, 4, 5)
In July 2016, Applicant met a Chinese national, Ms. A, on an online dating site.
Ms. A was temporarily in the United States working at a theme park. Applicant and Ms.
relationship  and
A  dated,  communicating
communication with Ms. A ended in August 2016. (Items 1-3)
in-person  and  online.  Applicant’s
In December 2016, Applicant met a Chinese national, Ms. B, on an online dating
site. Applicant believes Ms. B was in the United States on a work visa, and was working
for a theme park. They went on two dates together and then only communicated online
after those two dates. Applicant believes that Ms.  B moved back to China in February
2017. Applicant has not communicated with Ms. B since February 2017. (Items 1-4)
In June 2017, Applicant met a Chinese national, Ms. C, on an online dating site.
Ms. C was temporarily in the United States working at a theme park. Applicant and Ms.
C  dated,  communicating  in-person  and  online  from  June  2017  until  September  2018,
when  Ms.  C  moved  back  to  China.  Once  Ms.  C  moved  back  to  China,  they  only
communicated  online  until  they  ended  their  relationship  later  in  September  2018
because of  the difficulty of  a long distance relationship.  Applicant broke up with Ms. C
over e-mail and received a response from Ms. C that he has not read. Applicant claimed
he  did  not  read  the  letter  from  Ms.  C  to  avoid  getting  back  together  with  her,  but
admitted that he still has this e-mail and may read it in the future. (Items 1-4)
In January 2017, Applicant met a Chinese national, Ms. D, on a social media site.
They  met  in  person  for  three  consecutive  days  and  then  only  communicated  online
afterwards. Their last communication was online in October 2017 when Ms. D asked for
Applicant’s  Netflix   account   information   so   that  she   could  watch   online   programming.
While  it   is  not  clear   whether  Applicant   provided   Ms.  D  with   his  Netflix   account
information,   it   can   be   reasonably   deduced   that   he   did  because   he   indicated   that  he
looked  to  see  if  there  was evidence  of Ms. D  using  his Netflix  account,  but he  could  not
find  any. It  is logical that he  would have  only  suspected  that she  would use  his  Netflix
account information if he provided it to her. (Items 1-4)
In  April  2017,  Applicant  met  a  Vietnamese  national,  Ms.  E,  on  an  online  dating
site.  They  met  in  person  once  and  then  only  communicated  online.  Applicant  last
communicated with Ms. E in September 2017. (Items 1-4)
In March 2017, Applicant met a Thai national, Ms. F, on an online dating site. He
met her in person when he went on two dates with her and then communicated with her
electronically. Applicant last communicated with Ms. F in April 2017. (Items 1-4)
Applicant  continued  to  use  social  media  to  communicate  with  foreign  nationals
after his 2019  incident where  he  was  scammed and  extorted.  In June 2019,  Applicant
met a Japanese national, Ms. G, on an online dating site. Ms. G was temporarily in the
United States working at a theme park. Applicant and Ms. G dated, communicating in-
person  and  online.  Applicant  and  Ms.  G  maintained  a  romantic  relationship  until  early
2020  when  they  stopped  dating,  but  maintained  a  platonic  relationship.  The  latest
evidence  provided  that  Applicant  and  Ms.  G  communicate  electronically  “nearly  daily.”
(Items 1, 2, 4)
In April 2019, Applicant met a Japanese national, Ms. H on an online dating site.
He developed a platonic online friendship with Ms. H and maintains contact via text and
telephone on a weekly to monthly basis. Applicant believes that Ms. H is a resident of
Tokyo. (Items 1, 2, 4)
Applicant  does  not  believe  that  any  of  the  foreign  nationals  with  whom  he  has
contact  are  members  of  a  foreign  military  or  government.  He  claims  that  he  does  not
feel  vulnerable  to  coercion  or  duress  to  divulge  secured  or  protected  information  as  a
result of his aforementioned foreign contacts. He claims that he could not be coerced or
blackmailed into acting against the interests of the United States and that none of these
foreign contacts are aware that he has access to secured information as he has never
discussed  the  topic  with  them.  He  claims  that  he  has  not  developed  a  preference  for
any foreign country or foreign individuals but that he has simply developed a romantic
preference for women of Asian descent. With the exception of his romantic and platonic
relationships  with  the  aforementioned  women,  there  is  no  record  evidence  that
Applicant has any foreign involvement.

"The  SOR  alleged,  under  Guideline  B,  that  Applicant,  a  U.S.  citizen  by  birth,  is
maintaining dual U.S - Turkish citizenship and residing in Turkey with his wife and children
(SOR ¶ 1.a); voted in a local Turkish election (SOR ¶ 1.b); has ties to resident citizens of
Turkey (SOR ¶¶ 1.c through 1.f); and has assets in Turkey (SOR ¶¶ 1.g. and 1.h). Under
Guideline C, the SOR cross-alleged the same facts alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a (SOR ¶ 2.a) and
also alleged that Applicant used his Turkish citizenship to: purchase a home in Turkey
with funds borrowed from a Turkish financial institution (SOR ¶ 2.b); obtain employment
with a Turkish company in Turkey (SOR ¶ 2.c); qualify his children to attend a special
school in Turkey (SOR ¶ 2.d); and access the Turkish healthcare system (SOR ¶  2.e).
Under Guideline C, it also alleged that Applicant pays about 65% of his earned income in
taxes to Turkey (SOR ¶ 2.c).
In  his  Answer,  Applicant  admitted  each  Guideline  B  allegation.  However,
I
construed his response to SOR ¶ 1.g as a denial (as discussed below). With respect to
Guideline C, he denied the general concern and admitted all but one of the  allegations
(SOR  ¶  2.e).  However,  I  also  construed  his  response  to  SOR  ¶  2.b  as  a  denial  (as
discussed below).
Applicant, age 43, is a U.S. citizen by birth. He obtained his Turkish citizenship in
September 2013, which he continues to maintain as a dual U.S - Turkish citizen. His wife
is a Turkish  citizen by birth  and a  lawful permanent resident of  the  United  States.  Her
application for that  status  was  sponsored  by  Applicant  in  2003.  Applicant  and  his  wife
were married in Turkey in December 2001. Their three children, ages 9, 17, and 19, are
dual U.S - Turkish citizens. The 17-year-old was born in the United States (in May 2005),
and the other two  children  in Turkey. His wife’s  and  children’s resident  and citizenship
statuses  were  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.c.  In  his  Answer,  he  admitted  the  allegation  and
asserted that all three of his children plan to attend college in the United States. (GE 1,
2, 4)
Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Air Force upon his  graduation from high school in
December 1997. He served on active duty until he medically retired in April 2005, due to
service-related  injuries.  While  on  active  duty,  he  was  stationed  in  Turkey  from  2000
through  2005  (he  was  in  England  from  1997  through  2000).  Applicant  earned  his
bachelor’s  degree  in  2011  from  an  online  U.S.  university  he  attended  from  May  2009
through  May  2011.  His  current  U.S.  defense  contractor  employer  is  sponsoring  his
pending application for a trustworthiness determination. (GE 1, 2, 4)
Applicant has lived and worked in Turkey since 2000, except for the period from
March  2005  until  May  2008,  when  he  lived  and  worked  in  the  United  States.  He  has
resided with his wife and children in Turkey since May 2008. Besides referencing the birth
of their child in the United States in May 2005, the  record did not address whether his
wife and children resided with him in the United States between  March 2005 and May
2008,  or whether he  resided  with  his wife  and  children  in Turkey prior to  March  2005.
SOR ¶ 1.a and ¶ 2.a alleged: “You applied for citizenship in Turkey and became a dual
citizen of Turkey and the United States in about September 2013. You have resided in
Turkey with your spouse and three children since about 2008.” In his Answer, he admitted
SOR ¶ 1.a and asserted: “My mother-in-law is very ill and my wife takes care of her, as
a[n]  at  home  care  giver.”  He  admitted  SOR  ¶  2.a  and  asserted  that  he  has  returned
“home”  to  the  United  States  “on  leave”  every  year,  except  in  2020  due  to  COVID-19
restrictions and health issues that have put him at higher risk for COVID-19 complications.
(GE 1, 2, 4)
Applicant returned to the United States in March 2005 and expended his terminal
leave before processing out of the Air Force. He volunteered for five months beginning in
April 2005 for a U.S. healthcare company and then worked as its director of sales and
marketing  until  May  2007,  when  he  left  to  find  a  job  closer  to  his  residence.  He  then
worked as a quality control dispatcher for a U.S. delivery carrier from May 2007 through
May 2008, when he left to pursue a job opening at his former duty station in Turkey. Upon
his return to Turkey in May 2008, he was unemployed until January 2009 while waiting
for his contract to begin with the Turkish contractor for whom he worked as an assistant
bulk  storage  superintendent  until  January  2014,  when  his  contract  ended.  The  record
indicated  that,  although  the  contractor  for  whom  he  worked  was  a  Turkish  entity,  his
contract  supported  the  U.S.  Air  Force  base.  He  was  unemployed  again  from  January
2014 until March 2014 while waiting for his contract, also in support of the U.S. Air Force
base,  to  begin  with  his  current  U.S.  defense  contractor  employer.  During  those  two
periods  of  unemployment,  he  was  financially  supported  by  his  U.S.  Department  of
Veterans Affairs (VA) disability income. (GE 1, 2, 4)
When asked on his 2014 and 2016 SF86s how he acquired his Turkish citizenship,
Applicant answered:
My   wife   is Turkish   and   I   have   lived   and   worked   in   Turkey   for   approx.  10
years.  During   my   last   DOD  contract  I   was  told  [by   a   person   or entity   not
indicated   in   the   record]  to   get   a   Turkish   citizenship  because   it   would  be
easier than  always applying for a work permit.
He also stated that he planned to renounce his Turkish citizenship when he returned to
the United States after completing “all [of his] work overseas.” He further explained: “With
children in Turkish school and getting credit for buying house/car I need to have a Turkish
ID number.” (GE 1, 2)
Applicant  was  interviewed  twice  (in  May and  June  2019) in  connection  with  the
background investigation apparently prompted by his 2016 SF86. During his May 2019
interview, he stated that he obtained his Turkish citizenship so that he could get a job in
Turkey  to  supplement  his  VA  disability  income,  which  was  insufficient  to  meet  his
expenses; and to allow him to work in Turkey without having to obtain work permits. He
maintained that he had only one obligation associated with his Turkish citizenship: to pay
65% of his earned income in Turkish taxes. With respect to the rights and privileges of
his Turkish  citizenship,  he  stated  that  it afforded him  access  to  the Turkish  healthcare
system and the ability to own land in Turkey; and that, without it, his children would not
be able to attend the special Turkish school in which they were enrolled. He asserted that,
while  his  loyalty  is  to  the  United  States,  he  was  unwilling  to  renounce  his  Turkish
citizenship because doing so would preclude him from being able to work as a disabled
veteran in Turkey. He also stated that he would not renounce his citizenship because he
would not be able to own any land there. He explained that he had a house that he had
been paying for that was in his brother-in-law’s name, but would soon be in Applicant’s
name. (GE 4 at 5)
Later during Applicant’s May 2019 interview, he acknowledged that he owned his
home in Turkey, which he bought from his brother-in-law for US $85,000 in late 2018. He
explained that he was waiting for his brother-in-law, who then resided outside of Turkey,
to return to Turkey to switch the house over to Applicant’s name. During his June 2019
interview, he stated that even though he paid for it, his house is not in Applicant’s name.
He explained that in Turkey, because you build on top of other houses, he built his house
on  top  of  his  brother-in-law’s  house.  He  also  stated  that  even  though,  technically,  his
brother-in-law owns the land, his brother-in-law would not be able to sell Applicant’s home
without Applicant’s signature. SOR ¶ 1.g alleged: “You purchased a home in Turkey for
about $85,000 USD in about 2018. You used money borrowed from a Turkish financial
institution to purchase your home.” Although he admitted that allegation, he also asserted
in the accompanying explanation that: “I did not purchase/buy my house I built and added
to the upstairs of my brother-in-law’s house.  The  house  belongs to  my  brother-in-law.”
Thus, as previously indicated, I construed his answer to SOR ¶ 1.g as a denial. (GE 4 at
5, 9)
SOR  ¶   2.b   alleged:  “You   used   your  Turkish   citizenship  to   purchase   a   home   in
Turkey  in about 2018. You  used  your Turkish  citizenship to  borrow  money  from a  Turkish
financial   institution   to   enable  you   to   purchase   your  home.”  Although   he   admitted   that
allegation, the  accompanying  explanation  concerned   solely  the  facts alleged  in SOR ¶
2.c and  was not  responsive  to  the  facts  in  SOR ¶  2.b. Thus, as  previously  indicated, I
construed   his answer  to   SOR  ¶   2.b   as  a   denial,  particularly   in  light  of   the   explanation
accompanying  his response  to SOR ¶  1.g.
On  Applicant’s  2014  and  2016  SF86s,  he  reported  that  he  has  been  eligible  to
receive  medical  benefits  in  Turkey  since  January  2009.  He  explained  “I  worked  for  a
Turkish contractor and I paid into the SSK system, my family and I are eligible to use the
Turkish government hospitals . . . I still receive it and I will receive it in my next job.” SOR
¶  2.e  alleged:  “You  used  your  Turkish  citizenship  to  obtain  access  to  the  Turkish
healthcare system for you and your family.” In his Answer, he denied the allegation and
asserted:
[Y]es I do  have  Turkish  socialized  health  care  [sic] that comes with  paying
taxes in Turkey. I would not have  socialized  healthcare if  I did not have  a
job and pay taxes. I do not use this healthcare as I have TRICARE and  my
family  I are seen  at a  Network Facility  in . .  . Turkey. If  I were to  go  to  a
Turkish  Government Hospital, then  yes I would have  insurance  because  I
pay taxes. (GE  1  at 38-39; GE  2  at 37-38)
SOR ¶ 2.c alleged: “You used your Turkish citizenship to obtain employment with
a  Turkish  company  in  Turkey.  You  pay  the  government  of  Turkey  about  64%  of  your
earned  income  for  your  Turkish  employment  income  taxes.”  In  his  Answer,  Applicant
explained  that  his  current  employer  pays  his  salary,  but  does  so  by  paying  a  Turkish
company who direct deposits his paycheck into a Turkish bank. He also stated  that his
employer pays a Turkish company “for [him] to pay a progressive tax that ends up being
65% at the end of the year.”  He stated that he maintains a U.S. bank account, but  the
record  did  not  indicate  its  balance.  He  was  not  sure  why  his  employer  did  not  direct
deposit his paycheck into his U.S. bank account, but suspected that it may relate to his
obligation to pay taxes in order to live and work in Turkey. (GE 4 at 6)
During Applicant’s May 2019 interview, he disclosed that he maintains a loan, bank
account,  and  credit  cards  in  Turkey  because  he  lives  there.  During  his  June  2019
interview, he stated that he had maintained only one bank account in Turkey since about
2014, with a balance of approximately US $15,000. SOR ¶ 1.h alleged: “You maintain a
bank account in Turkey valued  at about $15,000 USD.  You have  credit  card accounts
issued by a Turkish bank.” In his Answer, he admitted the allegation and explained: “I do
have  a  bank  account  and  it  is  where  I  receive  my  check  for  the  job  I  need  this
[trustworthiness determination] for.” (GE 4 at 5, 9)
On Applicant’s 2016 SF86, he reported that he had owned a car in Turkey since
January 2014 with an estimated value of  US $20,179. He indicated that he was still in
possession of that car during his May 2019 interview. Because this car was not alleged
in the SOR, I will consider it only to evaluate mitigation and the whole person. During his
June 2019 interview, he indicated that he no longer owns a car in the United States as he
gave  it  to  his  grandparents  before  he  returned  to  Turkey  in  2008.  His  U.S.  car  was
eventually repossessed after his grandparents failed to make the payments, as promised,
on the loan for the car. (GE 1 at 37-38; GE 4 at 5, 8)
On  Applicant’s  2014  and 2016 SF86s, he reported  that his U.S. income  tax return
was audited  by  the  IRS  in 2013. He stated  that he  learned  from  the  IRS  that he  was not
entitled  to  the  earned  income  tax  credit because  he works overseas. He also stated  that
he  set up  a  payment  plan  with  the  IRS  and  his  U.S. state  tax  authority  to  repay  the  earned
income  credit  through  his “future  taxes.” He estimated  the  amount  owed  as US $5,000.
He explained  that the  reason  he  applied  the  earned  income  credit  on  his tax  return  was
because  he  was “told” to do  so  (by  a  person or entity  not  indicated  in  the  record).  During
his May  2019  interview,  in reference  to  the  2013  IRS  audit, he  stated  that  his employer
wrote  a  letter on  his behalf  to  the  IRS  and his U.S. state  tax  authority  stating  that he  has
Turkish taxes taken from  his paycheck. He  stated  that he  had not  heard any  more about
the  issue  since  his employer sent the  letter. Then  he  asserted  that he  does not pay  U.S.
taxes because he pays taxes to Turkey. The  SOR did not allege  facts with respect to his
U.S. tax  obligations;  therefore,  they  will be  considered  only  to  evaluate  mitigation  and  the
whole person.  (GE 1 at 44-45; GE 2  at 46-48;  GE 4  at 6)
During  Applicant’s  May  2019  interview,  he  stated  that  he  voted  in  a  mayoral
election  in  Turkey  in  March  2019  and  did  so  because  he  has  the  right  to  vote.  He
maintained that he had no plans to vote in any future elections. SOR ¶ 1.b alleged: “You
exercised  your  right  to  vote  as  a  Turkish  citizen  by  voting  in  a  local  Turkish  mayoral
election in about March 2019.” In his Answer, he admitted the allegation and explained:
“I was asked [by a person or entity not indicated in the record] to vote in the local mayoral
election.” (GE 4 at 5-6)
SOR  ¶ 2.d  alleged:  “You  used  your Turkish  citizenship  as a  basis for qualifying
your children to attend special school in Turkey.” In Applicant’s Answer, he admitted the
allegation  and  explained:  “My  wife  and  I  are  not  teachers  so  we  would  not  be  able  to
homeschool our children.”
Applicant’s parents, stepfather, and two siblings are citizens of the United States
by birth. His stepmother is a Brazilian citizen by birth and a naturalized U.S. citizen. They
all reside in the United States. His father-in-law is deceased. As alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d,
which Applicant admitted, Applicant’s mother-in-law is a resident citizen of Turkey. She is
78 years old and a citizen of Turkey by birth. She lives in Turkey next door to Applicant.
He has daily contact with her. Since 2008, he has provided her with financial support of
about US $400 per month by paying all of her bills. Because she is unable to pay her own
bills, he intends to continue providing this support. Applicant reported no employer for his
mother-in-law on his 2014 and 2016 SF86s and stated that she was not “affiliated with a
foreign government, military, security, defense industry, foreign movement, or intelligence
service.” (GE 1 at 34-35; GE 2 at 35-36; GE 4 at 5)
SOR ¶ 1.e, which Applicant admitted, alleged that his brother-in-law is a resident
citizen of Turkey. The record otherwise contains scant details about his brother-in-law,
including  to  whom  he  is  married,  his  employment,  and  any  affiliation  with  a  foreign
government,  military,  security,  defense  industry,  foreign  movement,  or  intelligence
service. Despite having indicated that his brother-in-law lived outside of Turkey for at least
some period of time, he admitted the allegation without explanation in his Answer.
On  Applicant’s 2014  and  2016  SF86s, he reported  that neither he  nor his wife  had,
within the  prior seven  years, close  or continuing  contacts with  any  other foreign  nationals.
However, on  his 2014  SF86, he  listed  a  friend  (A),  who  resided  in Turkey,  as one  of  his
four  references.  He  also  referred   to   this  friend   as  a   neighbor.  A   was  not  otherwise
discussed  in the  record  so  his citizenship status,  employment,  and  possible  connection
to  a  foreign  government are unknown. During  his May  2019  interview, Applicant reported
two  foreign  contacts that he  described  as coworkers who  were resident citizens  of  Turkey.
He had  known  one  coworker (B), who  is also the  godfather to  one  of  his children,  since
2015. He  had  known  the  other coworker (C) since  2018. He  reported  daily  contact  with  B
and  C,  and  that both  were employed  by  the  U.S.  Air  Force with  no  foreign  government
affiliations. Another name  (D) was  mentioned during  a follow up call  with the investigator
after   his  May   2019   interview.  However,  the   record   was  not  clear   as   to   whether  the
referenced  name  was an  inadvertent  misspelling  of one  of  the  aforementioned  persons
or another foreign  contact.  SOR ¶  1.f  alleged: “Your two  friends are citizens and  residents
of   Turkey.  One   friend   is  Godfather  to   one   of   your  children.”  In   his  Answer,  Applicant
admitted  the  allegation  and  reiterated  that both  work for  the  U.S.  Air  Force.  (GE  1  at 19-
20, 36; GE 2 at 20, 37; GE 4 at 4, 7)
In Applicant’s Answer, he expressed the following with respect to the Guideline B
and Guideline C concerns:
I would never or have  never indicated  a  preference  to  a  foreign  country  over
the United States. I live here for my job and  my  wife is here for her mother.
My   children   live   here   because   they   are  our  children   and   I   believe   that
children   should   grow   up   with   their   parents  not  guardians  or  wards  of   the
state  because  I work overseas . . .I  am  a  very  proud  American, I served  in
the  United  States Air  Force from  which I am  medically  retired  due  to  injuries
that  I   obtained   during   my   service.   I  love   working   with   the   [U.S.  Air   Force
base   in  Turkey]  population   .  .   .   I  would  never  nor  have   ever  put  another
country  above  America, nor has  my  family. I would like  for it to  be  on  record
that  I am  deeply  offended  that  my  love  and  loyalty  to  the  country  I served  is
in   question,  but  I  also   understand   that  you   are  just   doing   your  job   and
protecting   American   from   people  that  do   not  have   the   best  interests  of
America  at heart.
Turkey
Turkey  is  a  constitutional  republic  with  an  executive  presidential  system  and  a
unicameral  600  seat  parliament  (the  Grand  National  Assembly).  In  presidential  and
parliamentary  elections  in  2018,  Organization  for  Security  and  Cooperation  in  Europe
observers expressed concern regarding restrictions on media reporting and the campaign
environment, including the jailing of a presidential candidate that restricted the ability of
opposition candidates to compete on an equal basis and campaign freely.
The  friendship  between  the  United  States and  Turkey  dates back to  1831,  when
the  United  States established  diplomatic  relations with  the  Ottoman  Empire. The  United
States  condemned  the  July  15, 2016  coup  attempt  in  Turkey, and  continues  to  emphasize
the  importance  of the  Turkish  government’s adherence  to  policies and  actions  that build
public trust in the  country’s democratic institutions and  the  rule  of  law, as well  as upholding
human  rights commitments.  Turkey  is an  important U.S. security  partner, and  has been
a valued North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) ally since 1952.
On  December 14, 2020, the  United  States imposed  sanctions on  the  Republic of
Turkey’s  Presidency   of   Defense   Industries   (SSB)  pursuant   to   Section   231   of  the
Countering   America’s   Adversaries  Through   Sanctions  Act  (CAATSA)  for  knowingly
engaging  in a  significant transaction  with  Russia’s main arms export entity  by procuring
the  S-400  surface-to-air  missile system. The  United  States made  clear to  Turkey  at the
highest levels and  on  numerous  occasions  that  its purchase  of  the  S-400  system  would
endanger the  security  of  U.S.  military  technology  and  personnel and  provide  substantial
funds to  Russia’s defense  sector, as well  as Russian  access to  the  Turkish  armed  forces
and  defense  industry. Turkey  nevertheless decided  to  move  ahead  with  the  procurement
and   testing   of   the   S-400,  despite   the   availability   of   alternative,  NATO-interoperable
systems to  meet its defense  requirements. This decision  resulted  in Turkey’s suspension
and  pending removal from  the global F-35 Joint Strike Fighter partnership.
Turkey  continues its  efforts to  defeat terrorist organizations both  inside  and  outside
its  borders,  including   the   Kurdistan   Workers’   Party   (PKK),  the   Revolutionary   People’s
Liberation   Party/Front,  and   ISIS.  Turkey   is  an   active   contributor  in  international
counterterrorism  fora,  including  the  GCTF  and  the  Defeat-ISIS  Coalition.  However,
Turkey is a source and transit country for foreign terrorist fighters (FTFs) seeking to join
ISIS and other terrorist groups fighting in Syria and Iraq, as well as for FTFs who seek to
depart Syria and Iraq. Moreover, the PKK continues to conduct terrorist attacks in Turkey
and against Turkish interests outside of Turkey including by taking hostages. In 2020, the
PKK and its affiliates claimed responsibility for a rocket attack on a the Gurbulak customs
gate  with Iran  that  killed  two  Turkish  Customs  officials,  a  suicide  bomber  that  struck  a
natural gas pipeline near the Turkish-Iranian border, taking the pipeline offline for months,
and a  bombing in Mardin province  that temporarily disabled an oil pipeline  running from
Iraq to Turkey.  Turkey has a broad definition of terrorism that includes so-called crimes
against  constitutional  order  and internal  and  external  security  of  the  state,  which  the
government  regularly  used  to criminalize  the  exercise  of  freedom  of  expression  and
peaceful assembly.
Significant  human  rights  issues  exist  in  Turkey  including  credible  reports  of:
arbitrary killings; suspicious deaths of persons in custody; forced disappearances; torture;
arbitrary  arrest  and  continued  detention  of  tens  of  thousands  of  persons,  including
opposition  politicians  and  former  members  of  parliament,  lawyers,  journalists,  human
rights activists, and employees of the U.S. Mission, for purported ties to “terrorist” groups
or  peaceful  legitimate  speech;  political  prisoners,  including  elected  officials;  politically
motivated reprisal against individuals located outside the country, including kidnappings
and transfers without due process of alleged members of the Gulen movement; significant
problems  with  judicial  independence;  support  for  Syrian  opposition  groups  that
perpetrated serious abuses in conflict, including the recruitment and use of child soldiers;
severe  restrictions  on  freedom  of  expression,  the  press,  and  the  internet,  including
violence and threats of violence against journalists, closure of media outlets, and arrests
or  criminal  prosecution  of  journalists  and  others  for  criticizing  government  policies  or
officials, censorship, site blocking, and criminal libel laws; severe restriction of freedoms
of  assembly,  association,  and  movement,  including  overly  restrictive  laws  regarding
government oversight of nongovernmental organizations and civil society organizations;
some  cases  of  refoulement  of  refugees;  serious  government  harassment  of  domestic
human rights organizations; gender-based violence; crimes involving violence targeting
members of national/racial/ethnic minority groups; and crimes involving violence against
lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex persons.
The Turkish government took limited steps to investigate, prosecute, and punish
members of the security forces and other officials accused of human rights abuses; and
impunity  remained  a  problem.  The  government  took  limited  steps  to  investigate
allegations of high-level corruption. Clashes between security forces and the Kurdistan
Workers’ Party terrorist organization and its affiliates continued and resulted in the injury
or  death  of  security  forces,  terrorists,  and  civilians.  The  government  did  not  release
information on efforts to investigate or prosecute personnel for wrongful or inadvertent
deaths of civilians linked to counterterrorism operations.
The U.S. State Department warns U.S. citizens to exercise increased caution when
traveling to Turkey due to terrorism and arbitrary detentions. Terrorist groups continue
plotting possible attacks in Turkey. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting
tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, local government facilities,
hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, parks, major sporting and cultural events,
educational institutions, airports, and other public areas.  Security forces have detained
tens  of  thousands  of  individuals,  including  U.S.  citizens,  for  alleged  affiliations  with
terrorist organizations based on scant or secret evidence and grounds that appear to be
politically motivated. U.S. citizens have also been subject to travel bans that prevent them
from departing Turkey.

"The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant’s  mother  (SOR  1.a),  father  (SOR  1.b),  four
brothers (SOR 1.c), and three sisters (SOR 1.f) are citizens and residents of Iraq. The
SOR also alleged that one of his four brothers serves as a colonel in the Kurdish Forces
in Iraq (SOR 1.d), and that another brother works for Iraqi Transportation Security Agency
(ITSA) at an airport in northern Iraq (SOR 1.e). Applicant admitted with explanations all
of  the  SOR  allegations.  (Answer)  In  addition  to  the  facts  established  by  Applicant’s
admissions, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 53 years old, single, and works as an electronics testing technician in
a non-defense industry job. He is one of eight children (five boys, three girls), all of whom
were born and raised in the Iraqi Kurdistan Region (IKR) of northern Iraq. He attended an
Iraqi university  where he  earned  a  bachelor’s degree  in electronic  engineering  in 1989.
After a  U.S.-led  coalition  defeated  Iraq  in the  first Gulf  War in 1991, Kurdish  militias staged
an  uprising  against  the  regime  of  Saddam  Hussein.  The  uprising  was brutally  repressed
by  Iraqi forces.  At that  time,  Applicant  was serving  a  mandatory  enlistment  in the  Iraqi
army   as  required   under  the   Hussein   regime.   Rather  than   participate   in  the   Iraqi
suppression   of   Kurdish  forces,  Applicant  deserted   from   the   Iraqi army   and   returned   to
Kurdistan   at  the   outset  of  the   uprising.  After  the   subsequent  establishment  of  a   no-fly
zone   during   NATO’s  Operation   Northern   Watch,   he   worked   for  one   of  several  non-
governmental organizations (NGO)  that  went to Iraq to build housing  and provide shelter
for Kurds and  other  ethnic minorities  displaced  by  the  uprising. However, between  1994
and  1997,  civil  war broke  out among  the  Kurds. Military  responses by  the  Iraqi army, as
well   as  aggressions  by   Iranian-backed   militia   and   terrorist  organizations   resulted   in
widespread loss of life  throughout the region.  (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; GX 3; Tr.  35  –  39)
In  March  1997,  Applicant  was  evacuated  from  Kurdistan  as  part  of  an  airlift  of
Kurds  who  were  at  risk  of  harm  from  the  Hussein  regime  because  of  their  work  with
NGOs.  As part of  Operation Pacific Haven, he  was  transported  via Turkey to the  U.S.
territory of Guam. In December 1997, he was relocated to the continental United States
and was  granted refugee  status. He became  a naturalized  U.S.  citizen  in  2007. When
Applicant was evacuated from the IKR, he was told he could bring his parents and those
of his siblings who were younger than 21 years old. Rather than break up the family any
further,  Applicant’s  father  decided  that  only  Applicant  would  leave  and  the  rest  of  the
family would stay together. Applicant testified that he would like to have sponsored his
siblings to come to the United States after 2007, but he has mistakenly believed that they
are still barred from emigrating from Iraq. Currently, his parents are too old  and, in his
father’s case, too frail to move. His siblings all have families and careers of their own, so
he now feels it does not make sense for them to move. Applicant also believes that the
northern area of Iraq in which his family lives – Kurdistan – is stable and safe enough for
them to remain there. (Answer; GX 1 – 4; GX 6; Tr. 40 – 42, 58 – 59)
In  March  2004,  Applicant  was  hired  by a  U.S.  defense  contractor for work as  a
linguist in support of U.S. military missions in Iraq following the 2003 U.S. invasion.  He
submitted an SF-85P application for a position of trust and his background was vetted by
military  counterintelligence  personnel  before  he  could  be  assigned  to  work  with  those
units. For the next seven years, he worked closely with combat units assigned to a variety
of missions in northern Iraq. He was not allowed to see his family when he was in Iraq,
and he  has  always  been  aware  of  the  risks involved  should  terrorist  and other groups
learn of his work with the U.S. military. He understands that if he were to return to Iraq for
work in support of U.S. interests there, he again would not be able to visit his family there.
(Answer; GX 2 – 6; Tr. 43 – 44, 61 – 62, 66)
Between  2004  and  2011,  Applicant  established  an  excellent  reputation  as  an
interpreter and cultural advisor as he assisted units at forward operating bases in regular
contact with the enemy. His work also required him to interact with senior U.S. and Iraqi
officials, assist in training of Iraqi security forces, and support U.S. and coalition efforts to
secure Iraq’s borders with Turkey and Syria. Applicant often worked with units that came
under enemy fire, and on at least two occasions, he was with units that sustained attacks
using  improvised  explosive  devices  (IED).  His  work  in  support  of  U.S.  interests  was
consistently and effusively characterized as professional, dedicated, and trustworthy in
all respects. The certificates of appreciation and his receipt of challenge coins from units
with whom he worked in combat zones reflect the appreciation of those commanders for
Applicant’s service. (GX 2 – 6; AX A; Tr. 43 – 46, 64 – 66)
Information  about Applicant’s relatives in the IKR has not changed since he first
started working as a linguist for the U.S. military in 2004. All of  them still reside in  the
same areas of northern Iraq which is governed by the Kurdistan Regional Government
(KRG). One brother is a colonel in the Kurdish military forces, known as the Peshmerga,
with whom U.S. and coalition forces started operating after the U.S. invasion of Iraq in
2003. Applicant thinks this brother will retire soon. Another brother works at an airport in
the IKR for the Iraqi equivalent of the Transportation Security Agency (TSA). Employees
of that agency are trained by their U.S. counterparts and the airport is considered a high-
value target of terrorists. His two other brothers are teachers at a university in northern
Iraq. Applicant’s sister is a doctor in a hospital in northern Iraq; another is a teacher at a
high school in northern Iraq; and the third is a stay-at-home mother who also cares for
their parents. (Answer; GX 1 – 4; GX 6; GX 7; 33 – 35, 48 – 55)
Applicant speaks as often as he can with his parents because he is concerned for
their  health.  His  contact  with  his  other  siblings  is  less  frequent,  occurring  by  phone  or
email  a  few  times  each  year.  He  has  traveled  back  to  Iraq  and  Kurdistan  on  several
occasions  to  visit  his  parents  since  2011.  Applicant  visited  his  parents  in  early  2022
because his father has been ill  and he had been unable to visit for almost three years
during the pandemic. When he visits, he stays with his parents and with his sister who
lives  with  and  cares  for  them.  While  there,  he  also  visits  with  his  siblings  if  they  are
available. He testified that after his parents die, he would have no interest in returning to
Iraq. (Answer; GX 1; GX 6; Tr. 48 – 50, 56 – 57)
Applicant has lived in the same place in the United States since arriving from Guam
almost 25 years ago. After working in support of U.S. interests in Iraq for long stretches
between  2004  and  2011,  Applicant’s  employer’s  contract  ended  and  he  returned
permanently to the United States. Thereafter, he lived off his savings until January 2012,
when he found employment in the electronics field. In June 2013, he purchased a home
here, and all of his financial and property interests have always been in the United States
as long as he has lived here. (GX 1; GX 6; Tr. 46 – 47)
To properly assess the security significance of these facts within the adjudicative
guideline at  issue, I have  taken administrative  notice of  certain facts  regarding  Iraq as
presented in GX 7. Additionally, much of the factual information presented in GX 1 – 6,
AX A, and Applicant’s Answer and testimony make clear that Applicant’s family ties are
located  in  the  largely  autonomous  Kurdistan  province  of  Iraq.  Therefore,  I  sua  sponte
have  taken  notice  of  information  about  that  region  and  its  relationship  with  the  central
government  of  Iraq  that  is  available  on  the  U.S.  Department  of  State  website
(https://www.state.gov).
As to  Iraq  in general, of  particular note  is the  continued  inability  of  its freely-elected
government to  quell  the  violence  and  instability  that persist  in  some  parts of  that country.
These  conditions are  fueled  and  perpetrated  by  terrorist groups affiliated  with  Al-Qaeda
and  ISIS,  as  well  as by  Sunni insurgents  and  Iranian-backed  Shiite  militias.  As  a  result,
some  parts of   Iraq,  mainly   in  areas  south   of  Baghdad,  such   as  Basrah,   remain   wholly
unstable.  Even  the  city  of  Baghdad  is still  subject to  random  acts of  terrorist  violence. U.S.
citizens and  interests in Iraq  remain at high  risk for kidnapping  and  terrorist violence. The
U.S.  State  Department  has  advised  against  all  individual travel to  Iraq. The  ability  of the
U.S. Embassy  to  provide  consular services at the  U.S. consulate  in  Basrah  is extremely
limited given  the security environment, while the U.S. embassy in the IKR capital of Erbil
remains  open. While  ISIS  insurgent  groups  remain  active  in Iraq, their  control over large
swaths of Iraq  has been  diminished  by  U.S. and  coalition  efforts. Such  groups regularly
attack   both   Iraqi  security   forces   and   civilians.   Anti-U.S.   sectarian   militias  may   also
threaten   U.S.   citizens  and   western  companies  throughout  Iraq.  U.S.  Government  and
western interests remain possible targets for attacks.
Additionally,  there  are  significant  human-rights  problems  in  Iraq.  Widespread
corruption, as well as abuses by Iraqi security forces in response to acts of violence by
terrorists and others, have undermined confidence in the Iraqi central government and its
judiciary. Human-rights violations by Iraqi law enforcement are not uncommon and are
not  being  addressed  when  identified.  Those  include  killing,  kidnapping,  and  extorting
civilians, as well as inhumane conditions in detention and prison facilities, arbitrary arrest
and lengthy pretrial detainment, denial of fair public trial, limits on freedom of expression,
freedom of  the press, censorship of  religion, limits on peaceful assembly,  and societal
abuses of women. The various terrorist and militia organizations are also responsible for
significant human rights abuses in Iraq.
As witnessed during the repression of Kurds by Saddam Hussein’s regime in the
late 1980s and early 1990s, the people of the IKR and the KRG itself have long been at
odds  with  the  Iraqi  government.  The  KRG  is  largely  autonomous  and  has  established
some measure of stability. The KRG employs the Peshmerga, in concert with U.S. military
units, as its self-defense force against terrorist groups from Syria and (by proxy) Iran, as
well as against aggressions from Turkey intended to counter what that government views
as  Kurdish  terrorist  activities.  During  Operation  Iraqi  Freedom,  and  in  response  to
instabilities wrought by the Syrian civil war, U.S. and coalition forces have maintained a
significant presence in Kurdistan, working with Peshmerga and other elements to control
the influx of ISIS and like-minded entities from both Syria and Turkey. One observation
by  the  State  Department  tends  to  support Applicant’s  claim  that  Kurdistan  is relatively
safer and more stable than the rest of Iraq; that is, that religious persecution and acts of
violence  are  more  prevalent  in  areas  of  Iraq  outside  the  IKR,  and  the  KRG  does  not
enforce  Iraqi  laws  enacted  by  the  central  Iraqi  government  aimed  at  prosecuting  the
practice  of  religions  other  than  those  recognized  by  the  central  government.  The  U.S.
continues to train and equip Kurdish and Iraqi forces to counter terrorist activities in the
region.  (GX  7,

"Applicant is a  64-year-old  prospective  employee  of  a  defense  contractor, applying  for
a  position  as a  linguist  interpreter/translator. He is currently  unemployed.  He was born in
Nablus,  Jordan  (now  a  city  in the  West Bank, Palestinian  territory),  studied  in Egypt  from
1975   to   1977,  graduated   from   high   school,   and   entered   the   United   States  in   1979   on   a
student visa. In  1983, he  studied  toward a  certificate  in  airframe  power-plant mechanics and
he completed  some  college  coursework,  but  did  not  graduate.  Applicant  married  in  1980  (Tr.
12)  and  divorced  in 1985. He  naturalized  as a  U.S. citizen  in 1985.  He remarried  in  1990
and   has  four  adult  children,  all   of   whom   are   U.S.  citizens.   He   has  never  held  a   security
clearance, however he testified that he  previously held a  public trust position. (Tr. 61)
The  SOR alleges Applicant’s spouse  is a  citizen  and  resident of  Jordan  (SOR ¶  1.a);
his  three   sons  and   daughter  are  residents  of   Jordan   (SOR  ¶¶   1.b   and   1.c);  and   his  two
sisters, two  brothers and  mother-in-law  are citizens and  residents of Jordan  (SOR ¶¶  1.d-
1.f). The  SOR also  alleges Applicant  maintains close  and  continuing  contact with  various
relatives residing  in  Jordan  (SOR ¶  1.g),  and  a  friend  who  is a  citizen  and  resident of  Qatar,
is  employed  as a  minister delegate  with  the  Qatari  Ministry  of  Foreign  Affairs.  (SOR ¶  1.h)
In  his Answer to  the  SOR, Applicant admitted  that his spouse, sisters, and  mother-in-law  are
citizens and residents  of Jordan, but denied the remaining allegations with explanations.
After attaining U.S. citizenship in 1985, he returned to Jordan in 1986 and opened a
restaurant that he operated from 1987 to 1990, until he sold it to his brother. (Tr. 13) From
1991 to 2000, Applicant worked for the Saudi Arabian embassy in Germany as a translator,
passport document filer (GE 3) and occasional medical patient transporter (Tr. 14). Of note,
he stated in his personal subject interview (PSI) with a Government investigator conducted
in December 2017 and January 2018, that he moved to Jordan in 1986 or 1987 after his
divorce from his first spouse, and re-established contact with his current spouse, whom he
knew from childhood and married in 1990. Despite his contrary testimony, he stated that he
moved  to  Germany  in  1992,  and  worked  as  a  hotel  cook  and  eventually  as  a  “hospital
translator”  until  he  left  Germany  in  2000.  (GE  2)  He  said  in  his  November  2017
Counterintelligence  Screening  Questionnaire  (counterintelligence  screening)  that  he  was
not an official contract employee of the embassy, but was paid in cash. (GE 3 at p.7) When
pressed  in  his  PSI  about  who  paid  him,  he  stated  that  he  was  contracted  by  the  Saudi
embassy as a translator, but not employed  by them directly. He was paid  by “clients” whom
he  transported  between  the  airport, hospital, and  their  hotels. He  said he  left  Germany  in
2000 and “did not maintain any contact with the Saudi embassy or his  “clients” after he left.
(GE 2  at p.39)  Contrary  to  Applicant’s statement in his PSI, he  did in  fact maintain  at least
one relationship with a  “client”  he  met in Germany.
While working for the Saudi embassy, Applicant met Sheikh K, a Qatari citizen, who
had  a  relationship  with  Saudi  Arabia  and  was  in  Germany  for  medical  care.  (Tr.  48,  52)
Sheikh K employed Applicant for about six months while in Germany. Sheikh K is a member
of  the  Qatari  royal  family.  According  to  Applicant,  Sheikh  K  was  appointed  as  a  Minister
Delegate to the Qatari Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (GE 2 at p. 20; Tr. 49) The record does
not indicate the Sheikh’s current status.
Applicant returned to the U.S. in 2000 and worked at a restaurant. From 2006 to 2011,
Applicant  lived  and  worked  in  Iraq  as  a  U.S.  military  contract  translator/linguist  for  Multi-
National  Forces-Iraq,  including  at  Iraq’s  largest  theater  internment  facility  and  for  U.S.
special operations forces in Iraq. (GE 3, AE A) In 2011, he moved back to Jordan for a few
months.
After Sheikh K returned to Qatar, he asked Applicant to move there and work in a
United Arab Emirates (UAE)-based construction company in Qatar, owned by Sheikh K’s
brother, Sultan H, also a member of the Qatari royal family. (Tr. 48-51; GE 2 at pp. 19-20)
Through this association, Applicant also met another of the  Sultan’s brothers  (landlord) in
2013. (GE 2, p. 27-28)
Although Applicant testified that he lived and worked in Qatar from 2011 until 2013,
he stated in his PSI that he lived in Qatar from 2013 to 2017, and in his counterintelligence
screening,  he  listed that  he  lived  in  Qatar from 2014  to  2016,  and was  employed by two
companies in Qatar from October 2013 to June 2017. (Tr. 20-21; GE 2; and GE 3)
While in Qatar, Applicant worked as a general supervisor for a construction company
based out of the UAE and related to Sultan H, Sheikh K’s brother, whom he met in Germany.
(Tr. 21; GE 3 at p. 2) In about 2016, he then changed employment to another company in
Qatar for better pay, owned by Mr. F, a Qatari citizen and good friend of Sultan H. (GE 1;
GE 1 at pp. 21-23; GE 2 at p. 14) In his PSI, Applicant stated that Mr. F is a member of a
Qatari  law  firm  and  owner  of  a  construction  company  where  Applicant  was  a  general
supervisor. (GE 1; GE 2 at p. 28; GE 3 at p. 3) Applicant described his construction company
positions in various ways throughout the investigation to include advisor, advisor consultant,
public relations, general supervisor, and general management. (GEs 1 – 3; Tr. 20, 51)
Applicant stated in his PSI that he maintained quarterly contact with Sheikh K from
1998 to 2016, however, in testimony, he said he has not had contact with him in the past 10
years. In his Answer to the SOR, he said that they were never close friends and has not had
contact with him since 2010. (Ans.; Tr. 56) He testified that he had no relationship with
Sheikh K, and spoke to him only about a job opportunity. He said “I wasn’t really infatuated
to talk to this guy.” He said he stopped talking to Sheikh K after a ten-year relationship “most
of the time, yes.” (Tr. 56) In his PSI, Applicant stated that his last contact with Sheikh K was
April  2016,  however,  according  to  his  November  2017  counterintelligence  screening,  he
maintained  “monthly” contact with  Sheikh K.  (GE 2 at p. 19; GE 3 at p. 8) Applicant also
testified that he saw Sheikh K’s brother, Sultan H, “only once or twice.” (Tr. 57) However, in
his PSI, he noted that he maintained  “monthly”  contact with Sultan H from 2009 to 2017,
essentially to the date of the  interview, and that he vacationed with him and did personal
errands for him, as noted below.
In  2013,  Applicant  testified  that  he  returned  to  Jordan  to  live  with  his  spouse  until
2017 (Tr. 23), although he stated in his counterintelligence screening that he also worked in
Qatar and Saudi Arabia in 2013 and 2014, and that he worked in Doha, Qatar, from 2014 to
2016 for a company that paid him although he did not perform work. (GE 3)
Applicant also stated that his friend, Sheikh K, applied for his visa in 2014 to travel
with the Sheikh to Saudi Arabia for vacation, at Sheikh K’s expense. (GE 3 at p.8) He did
not  discuss  this  employment  or  vacation  in  testimony.  In  Applicant’s  PSI,  he  detailed  his
foreign travel, including:
-  June  2011, traveled to Qatar to visit his friend Sheikh K.
-  June  2011, traveled to Thailand for a 26-day vacation with Sheikh K, who paid for all
of their expenses.
-  September to  October  2011, traveled to Qatar to “see business or job opportunities
there.”
-  September  2012,  traveled  to  UAE  to  “probably”  look  for  work  opportunities  as  a
linguist.
-  February  2014  to  May  2014, traveled to Saudi Arabia with Sheikh K and Sultan H for
vacation. Applicant’s expenses were paid by Sheikh K and Sultan H.
-  December 2014, January 2015, and March 2015,
traveled to the UAE for Sultan H’s
company.
-  July  2015, traveled with Sultan H, the Sultan’s brother Mr. S, and others, to France.
They began in Nice, and took an eight-day cruise. Mr. S is married to a relative of the
Prince of Qatar.
-  October 2015, traveled to the United Kingdom (UK) to “take care of personal stuff for
Sultan H” pertaining to the Sultan’s investment property.
-  December 2015, traveled to the UK to “do personal errands for Sultan H,” including
to pick up the Sultan’s purchases.
-  February 2017, traveled to the UK to do personal errands for Mr. F, including to fix a
bank account issue for Mr. F.

Sultan  H’s  participation),

While living in Jordan from 2013 to 2017, he was not employed, but lived off of his
savings. (Tr. 19-23) Applicant’s spouse, a Jordanian citizen, lives in Jordan where she owns
an apartment. She is also unemployed. His father is deceased. One of their sons lives with
her  and  attends  nursing  school.  Applicant  testified  that  his  spouse  is  awaiting  a  U.S.
permanent resident (green) card that she applied for in February or March 2022. Applicant
is  sponsoring  her.  His  spouse  visited  the  U.S.  for  ten  days  in  2007,  but  had  to  return  to
Jordan for an emergency, which led to her loss of a green card. (Ans.) From 2013 to at least
2017, he sent about $1,500 to $2,000 per month to his spouse in Jordan. (GE 2) He testified
that in 2021, he sent her about $800 to $900 per month, and has sent his son about $200
to $300 (the record is not clear whether that is a monthly or total amount). (Tr. p. 40)
From about 2017 to 2021, Applicant worked as a contract linguist for the U.S. military
in  Kuwait  for  a  few  months,  and  then  in  Jordan  as  part  of  the  Jordan  Operational
Engagement Program (JOEP), a joint U.S./Jordan military training program. Since 2021, he
has  lived  in  the  U.S.  He  currently  lives  with  his  daughter  and  receives  unemployment
benefits. Applicant relinquished his Jordanian passport in 2018, and has not renewed it. He
travels on his U.S. passport or military issued identification.
Applicant has an adult daughter and three adult sons. They are all U.S. citizens based
on his U.S. citizenship. His daughter and two sons now live in the U.S., and his third son
lives in Jordan, attending nursing school. His daughter and three sons were living in Jordan
(but one son was in school in Germany) when he completed his SCA and PSI in 2017. As
of at about 2021, his daughter and two sons are now residing in the United States. (Ans.)
Applicant has five brothers. Two brothers  (A and D)  live in Germany, one of which is
a  dual Jordanian/German  citizen  while  the  other is a  Jordanian  citizen.  (Tr. 30-32, SCA, GE
2)  A  third  brother lives in Jordan  (M). He  was not  mentioned  in  testimony, but  confirmed  in
Applicant’s   SCA  and   PSI.   (GE   2;  GE   3;  SCA)  However,  in  his  SCA,  Applicant   listed   two
brothers  as residing in  Jordan, and  one living  in Germany.  He confirmed the SCA entries in
his PSI,  and  noted  that  two  other brothers are  deceased.  He  testified  that he  speaks to  his
brothers  intermittently,  about  annually   or  longer.   (Tr.  30-31)   However,  in  his  Answer,  he
stated  that  he  has  not spoken  to  either of  his brothers  in  Germany  in  over 10  years. (Ans.)
It   appears from   testimony   that  he   does  not have   a   close   relationship  with   his brothers in
Germany, and one brother is infirm. (Tr. 30-33)
Applicant’s two sisters are citizens and residents of Jordan. In his Answer, he noted
that he speaks to them once or twice a year, and in testimony, he said he last spoke with
them in 2020, but also said he speaks to them twice a year. (Tr. 33) His mother-in-law is a
citizen and resident of Jordan. In his Answer, he stated he spoke to her three years ago, but
in his SCA, he stated he has annual in-person or telephone contact with her. In testimony,
he downplayed the frequency or last contact he has had with family members in Jordan, and
denied any continuing contact with extended relatives living in Jordan. (Tr. 29-35)
In a post-hearing submission, Applicant provided numerous positive character letters
from  U.S.  military  officers  with  whom  he  worked  in  Iraq,  certificates  of  appreciation,
challenge  coins,  excellent  performance  evaluations,  letters  of  recommendation  for
employment, and  training certificates.  Applicant  does  not  currently work, does  not  own  a
car,  property,  or  investments,  and  has  about  $4,000  in  a  U.S.  bank  account.  I  found
Applicant’s testimony to be at times confusing, evasive, incomplete, less than forthcoming,
and contrary to documentary evidence in the record.
JORDAN
The  Hashemite  Kingdom  of  Jordan  (Jordan) is  a  constitutional  monarchy  ruled  by
King Abdullah II bin Hussein. The King has ultimate executive and legislative authority. The
Jordanian security services underwent a significant reorganization in December 2019 when
the  King  combined  the  previously  separate  Public  Security  Directorate  (police),  the
Gendarmerie,  and  the  Civil  Defense  Directorate  into  one  organization  named  the  Public
Security  Directorate.  The  Public  Security  Directorate  and  the  General  Intelligence
Directorate  share responsibility for maintaining internal security.  The General Intelligence
Directorate reports directly to the King. The armed forces report to the Minister of Defense
and  are  responsible  for  external  security,  although  they  also  have  a  support  function  for
internal security. Members of the security forces have reportedly committed abuses. (HE 1,
Item 1  - U.S. Department of  State,  Country reports on Human Rights Practices for 2020:
Jordan, March 30, 2021)
In  2013  and  2014, the  United  States  provided  Jordan  $2.25  billion  in  loan  guarantees,
allowing  Jordan  access to  affordable  financing  from  international capital markets. The  U.S.-
Jordan  free  trade  agreement (FTA), the  United  States’ first FTA  with  an  Arab  country, has
expanded   the   trade   relationship   by   reducing   barriers  for  services,   providing   cutting-edge
protection  for intellectual property, ensuring  regulatory  transparency, and  requiring  effective
labor and  environmental enforcement.  The  United  States  and  Jordan  have  an  “open  skies”
civil aviation  agreement;  a  bilateral investment  treaty; a  science  and  technology  cooperation
agreement;   and   a   memorandum   of   understanding   on   nuclear  energy   cooperation.  Such
agreements bolster efforts to  help  diversify  Jordan’s economy  and promote  growth. Jordan
and  the  United  States  belong  to  a  number of the  same  international organizations, including
the   United   Nations,   International  Monetary   Fund,  World   Bank,  and   World   Trade
Organization.  Jordan  also  is a  Partner for Cooperation   with   the   Organization   for Security
and Cooperation in Europe.
The United States deeply values its long history of  cooperation and friendship with
Jordan with which it established diplomatic relations in 1949. The United States and Jordan
share the mutual goals of a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace between Israel and the
Palestinians,  and  an  end  to  violent  extremism  that  threatens  the  security  of  Jordan,  the
region, and the entire globe. The peace process and Jordan’s opposition to terrorism parallel
and  assist  wider  U.S.  interests.  U.S.  policy  seeks  to  reinforce  Jordan’s  commitment  to
peace,  stability,  and  moderation.  In  light  of  ongoing  regional  unrest,  as  well  as  global
disruptions stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States has helped Jordan
maintain its stability and prosperity through economic and military assistance and through
close political cooperation.
As of August 8, 2022, the U.S. Department of State travel advisories for Jordan range
from  Level  2  (Exercise  Increased  Caution)  due  to  terrorism,  to  Level  4  (Do  Not  Travel),
depending on the area of the country visited. The capital of Amman is currently assessed
as being at considerable risk from terrorism directed at or affecting official U.S. Government
interests. The threat of terrorism across Jordan remains high. Transnational and indigenous
terrorist groups in Jordan have demonstrated the capability to plan and implement attacks.
Violent extremist groups in Syria and Iraq have conducted attacks in Jordan and continue
to  plot  against  local  security  forces,  U.S.  and  Western interests, and  soft  targets  such  as
high   profile   public  events,   hotels,   places  of  worship,  restaurants,  schools,   and   malls.
Jordan’s   prominent   role   in   the   effort  to   defeat  ISIS,   and   its  shared   borders   with   Iraq   and
Syria, increase the potential for future terrorist incidents.
Additionally, violence  in the  West Bank  and  Gaza  has led  to  demonstrations and  anti-
Government/anti-U.S.  sentiment  in   Jordan.  Regional  issues  can   inflame   anti-U.S./anti-
Western sentiment.  U.S. involvement in  Iraq  and  Syria  as well  as U.S. Government  policies
on   Israel  have   fueled   anti-U.S.  sentiment.   Jordan’s  most  significant  human   rights  issues
include:  cases  of cruel,  inhumane,  and  derogatory  treatment or  punishment;  arbitrary  arrest
and  detention,  including  of activists and  journalists;  infringement  on  citizens’ privacy  rights;
serious  restrictions  on   free   expression   and   the   press,   including   criminalization   of   libel,
censorship, and  internet site  blocking; substantial restrictions on  freedom  of  association  and
freedom   of   peaceful  assembly;  serious  incidents  of   official  corruption;  “honor”   killings  of
women; trafficking  in persons; and  violence  against  lesbian, gay,  bisexual, and  transgender
persons.   Impunity   remained   widespread,   although   the   Jordanian   government  took  some
limited steps to investigate, prosecute, and  punish officials who committed abuses.
Law and Policies
“[N]o one  has a ‘right’ to a security clearance.” Department of the Navy  v. Egan, 484
U.S. 518, 528  (1988). As Commander in Chief, the  President has the  authority  to  “control
access to  information  bearing  on  national security  and  to  determine  whether an  individual is
sufficiently  trustworthy to  have  access to  such  information.” Id. at 527. The  President has
authorized  the  Secretary  of  Defense  or his designee  to  grant applicants eligibility  for access
to   classified   information   “only   upon   a   finding   that   it  is  clearly   consistent  with   the   national
interest to do so.” Exec. Or. 10865 §  2.
National  security  eligibility  is  predicated  upon  the  applicant  meeting  the  criteria
contained  in  the  adjudicative  guidelines.  These  guidelines  are  not  inflexible  rules  of  law.
Instead, recognizing the complexities of  human behavior, an administrative judge applies
these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative
judge’s  overarching  adjudicative  goal  is  a  fair,  impartial,  and  commonsense  decision.  An
administrative judge must consider a person’s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, discretion,
character, honesty, and judgment. AG ¶ 1(b).
The  Government  reposes  a  high  degree  of  trust  and  confidence  in  persons  with
access  to  classified  information.  This  relationship  transcends  normal  duty  hours  and
endures  throughout  off-duty  hours.  Decisions  include,  by  necessity,  consideration  of  the
possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified
information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about
potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.
Clearance decisions must be made “in terms of the national interest and shall in no
sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.” Exec. Or. 10865 § 7.
Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has not
met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for
issuing a clearance.
Initially,  the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions  in the
personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from being
eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of establishing
controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. “Substantial evidence”
is “more than  a   scintilla   but  less   than   a  preponderance.” See   v. Washington   Metro.   Area
Transit Auth., 36 F.3d  375, 380  (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume  a  nexus or rational
connection   between   proven   conduct  under  any   of   the   criteria   listed   therein   and   an
applicant’s  security   suitability.  See   ISCR   Case   No.   92-1106   at   3,  1993  WL   545051   at   *3
(App. Bd. Oct.  7, 1993).
Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence,
the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive
¶ E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of
disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02- 31154 at 5 (App. Bd.
Sep. 22, 2005).
An   applicant  “has the   ultimate   burden   of  demonstrating   that  it  is clearly   consistent
with  the  national interest  to  grant or continue  his security   clearance.” ISCR   Case  No.  01-
20700  at 3  (App. Bd.  Dec.  19, 2002). “[S]ecurity  clearance  determinations should  err, if  they
must, on the side of  denials.” Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see  AG ¶ 1(d).
Guideline B, Foreign Influence
",False
"The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for national
security eligibility because he has foreign connections that may create circumstances in
which  the  individual  may  be  manipulated  or  induced  to  help  a  foreign  person,  group,
organization, or government in a way inconsistent with U.S. interests.
Applicant admitted all four SOR allegations with explanations. After a thorough and
careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is 60  years old.  He  was  born  in  Pakistan  in  1962,  entered  the  United
States in 1990, and became a naturalized American citizen in 2009. He is married to his
second  wife,  who  is a Legal Permanent Resident. He  has  two  American-born  children
from  his  first  wife.  He  has  a  bachelor’s  degree  and  a  master’s  degree,  and  has  been
employed  by  a  defense  contractor  as  an  engineer  since  2018.  He  wishes  to  obtain
national  security  eligibility  in  connection  with  his  employment.  Applicant  has  not
previously applied for national security eligibility. (Item 2 at 43-44; Item 4 at Sections 12,
13A, 17, 18, and 25.)
1.a  and  1.b.  Applicant  has one  brother  and  four sisters. His parents are deceased.
All   of   his  siblings  live   in  Pakistan.  Two   of   his  sisters  are  married.  His  brother,  who   is
disabled, lives with  the  other two  sisters  in the  house  that  belonged  to  his parents.  (Item
2 at 1-18.)
Applicant speaks with his brother, and the two sisters the brother lives with, on a
weekly basis. He communicates with his other two sisters on a monthly basis. In Applicant
Exhibit  A  he  stated,  “[W]hat  is  wrong  if  I  am  close  to  my  family  (Sibling)?”  (Item  4  at
Section 18.)
Applicant has visited Pakistan several times since becoming an American citizen.
The last trip of which the Government has knowledge occurred in 2017. (Item 4 at Section
20C; Item 5 at 4.)
1.c and 1.d. Applicant admitted that he has been sending money to Pakistan for
the support of his handicapped brother and the sisters he lives with since approximately
2004. None of the three of them are employed. He sent the money to one of his brothers-
in-law  until  he  passed  away  in  2018.  Applicant  then  began  sending  the  money  to  his
nephew. Applicant provided financial records showing he sent approximately $3,600 to
Pakistan in 2020. In Applicant Exhibit A he stated, “{W}hat is wrong if I am sending money
to my family for medical reason?” He also stated, “I am the primary provider for my family
that  still  resides  in  Pakistan,  and  this  is  an  important  role  that  my  family  needs  me  to
continue in order for them to sustain a proper livelihood.” (Item 2 at 21-39; Item 5 at 3-4.)
Pakistan
I  take  administrative  notice  of  the  facts  set  forth  in  Item  6.  Pakistan  is  a
parliamentary federal republic, created in 1947 after British India was partitioned when
the  British  government  granted  India  its  independence.  Pakistan  was  created  for  the
Moslem population of the Indian sub-continent. Its population is about 170 million. After
September 11, 2001, Pakistan reassessed its relations with the Taliban and supported
the U.S. and international coalition in its efforts to remove the Taliban from power. Many
Islamic  extremists  and  terrorists  are  known  to  inhabit  parts  of  Pakistan,  leading  to  a
growth of their insurgency. Although Pakistan has intensified its efforts to deal with the
violence and terrorists, the country continues to experience serious problems. The U.S.
Department  of  State  confirms  that  many  border  cities  are  known  as  safe  havens  for
terrorists.  Numerous  suicide  bombings  and  kidnappings  have  taken  place  over  many
years. Human rights violations continue to be a significant problem, as killings, torture,
and  disappearances  remain  prevalent.  The  Pakistani  government  maintains  domestic
intelligence surveillance activities. The U.S. government warns Americans against travel
to Pakistan, including specific concerns about travel to the city where Applicant’s family
lives. (Item 6 at Attachment VIII.)
Applicant Exhibit A contains several photographs and accompanying descriptions
from the press office of the United States Embassy in Pakistan dating from September 7,
2021,  through  December  2,  2021.  Applicant  argues  that  these  documents  show  that
Pakistan  is  a  safe  place  to  visit  and  live.  The  subjects  involve  such  normal diplomatic
activities as military-to-military relations, support for law enforcement, and improvement
of  economic  and  cultural  ties  between  the  two  countries.  All  of  the  press  releases

Applicant stated the following in Applicant Exhibit A:
I have  been  in this country  for more than  30  years. During  this time,  I  worked
very  hard to  get complete  my  education  and  earn prominent employment in
US.
Any   background   review   of  mine   will  show   you   that  I  have   been   a   [sic]
upright, model, law abiding citizen of the US.
My  Pakistani origin does not  and  should not automatically  disqualify  my  [sic]
in any way and include me as being associated with any illegal activities.
Applicant has received letters of commendation and appreciation for his volunteer
work in his community. (Item 2 at 40-42.)
",False
"The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant’s  wife  (SOR  1.a),  children  (SOR  1.b),  parents
(SOR 1.c), and siblings (SOR 1.f) are citizens and residents of Kosovo. The SOR also
alleged that Applicant’s best friend and his friend’s wife (SOR 1.g), a sister-in-law (SOR
1.h), two childhood friends (SOR 1.i), and a niece (SOR 1.j) are all citizens and residents
of Kosovo.
Further,  the  SOR  alleged  that  between  October  2007  and  November  2015,
Applicant resided at a U.S. military installation in Kosovo as part of his employment with
a  U.S.  defense  contractor,  and  that  he  maintained  regular  contact  with  his  wife  and
children and other family members who were living  in Kosovo during that period (SOR
1.d). Additionally, the SOR alleged that Applicant, his wife and his children, have lived in
Kosovo with his parents since November 2015 (SOR 1.e).
Finally, the SOR alleged that Applicant’s wife maintains a bank account in Kosovo
with a balance of about $12,000, which Applicant provided (SOR 1.k); and that Applicant
owns three properties in Kosovo with an approximate total value of $180,000 (SOR 1.l).
Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. In addition to the facts established
by Applicant’s admissions, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 41 years old. When he was born, Serbia, formerly a part of the now-
dissolved Yugoslavia, controlled the Yugoslavian province of Kosovo, where he and his
family  and  friends  all  lived.  When  Kosovo  declared  independence  in  2008,  Applicant
became a citizen of the newly-formed nation of Kosovo; however, he was always a citizen
of  Kosovo  as  it  existed  before  the  Kosovo  War  of  1998  –  1999  and  subsequent
independence  from  Serbia.  He  was  raised  and  educated  in  Kosovo  through  his  high
school graduation in 1999. Between June and December 2002, he worked as a linguist
for  a  U.S.  defense  contractor  in  support  of  U.S.  forces  operating  as  part  of  a  NATO
coalition put in place after the Kosovo War ended in 1999. (GX 2; GX 3; Tr. 27 – 28)
In December 2002, at age 21, Applicant traveled to the United States on a tourist
visa. During that visit, he met a woman who was a U.S. citizen and they decided to get
married. They arranged to be married in June 2003 before his tourist visa expired and he
would be forced to return to Kosovo, and either obtain a new tourist visa or apply for entry
to  the  United  States  for  different  reasons.  After  his  marriage,  he  obtained  permanent
resident status in the United States by virtue of his marriage to a U.S. citizen. (GX 1; GX
2; GX 3; Tr. 28 – 29)
Applicant joined the U.S. Army on January 13, 2004. The following day, he and his
American wife finalized  their divorce. Applicant claims she did not want to move to his
duty station in another state or to be married to someone who would have to move a lot
for military assignments. He served as an airborne infantryman and deployed on multiple
combat  missions  in  the  Middle  East.  By  serving  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  military,
Applicant was able to become a naturalized U.S. citizen, which he did in October 2004.
He  received  a  security  clearance in  March 2007, and  he  was  honorably discharged  in
September 2007. (GX 1; GX 3; Tr. 11 – 12, 29 – 32)
Two months after his discharge, Applicant returned to Kosovo. In 2007, he found
employment there for the next eight years as a linguist with two U.S. defense contractors
supporting the ongoing U.S. military mission. He later was promoted to a management
position  involving  physical  security  requirements  for  the  U.S.  military  installation  in
Kosovo that was his job site. He worked in that capacity in Kosovo until 2015, when the
contract ended.  During his employment, Applicant  had access to classified information
based  on  the  security  clearance  he  held  in  the  Army.  The  record  does  not  contain  a
reapplication  for  clearance  between  his  2007  discharge  and  the  February  2019
application that is being sponsored by his new employer. (GX 1; GX 2; GX 3)
Applicant remarried in April 2006 and has two children. His current wife is a citizen
resident of Kosovo. She has since been granted permanent resident status in the United
States. Except for visits to Applicant’s duty station in the United States, she has stayed in
Kosovo  since  2006,  including  while  Applicant  completed  the  last  of  his  combat
deployments to the Middle East before his discharge in 2007. His two children, now ages
8 and 13, were born in Kosovo after Applicant was discharged from the Army. (Answer;
GX 1; GX 2; GX 3; Tr. 33 – 35)
Because Applicant’s children were born abroad to a U.S. citizen, they were eligible
for U.S. citizenship at birth, their status being derived from Applicant’s U.S. citizenship.
However, they could not immediately receive U.S. citizenship because Applicant had not
been physically present in the United States for five years before they were born. Thus,
he was required first to establish their Kosovo citizenship (he obtained Kosovo passports
for them), then obtain immigrant visas for each child and apply for their naturalization after
the family returned to the United States, which they did in August 2020. The children are
now dual citizens of the United States and Kosovo. (GX 1; Tr. 38 – 39; see also 8 U.S.C.
§ 1401(g))
Between 2007 and 2015, Applicant lived at the military facility in Kosovo that was
his job site. His family remained at their home in Kosovo and Applicant was able to see
them  periodically  during  scheduled  time  off.  This  was  required  by  the  terms  of  his
employment  because  he  was  on  call  at  all  times.  In  January  2019,  he  was  hired  by
another U.S. defense contractor for work as a linguist at the same facility in Kosovo. His
employment is contingent on his renewed eligibility for a security clearance. He testified
that if he does not qualify for employment as a contractor in Kosovo, he will take his family
back to the United States to find work. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; GX 3; Tr. 11 – 12, 53 – 54)
After  leaving   his  job   in   2015,  Applicant  remained   in   Kosovo   with   his  wife   and
children. He did not seek further work, choosing  instead  to  be  a  stay-at-home  father  in
Kosovo between  2015  and 2020  while his wife completed her college studies in  Kosovo.
In August 2020, after he had received the  SOR and  became  uncertain about whether he
would be  able work as a  linguist in Kosovo, Applicant and  his family  moved  back to  the
United States where they  rented a  place to live so his children could attend school in the
U.S.  for  the   2021   –   2022   school  year.  During   the   summers  of   2021   and   2022,   they
returned  to  Kosovo. He appeared  for his hearing  virtually  from  Kosovo. While  he  wants
his children  to  experience  their  heritage  in Kosovo, he  does not want them  to  attend  the
public  schools  there.  However,  he   cannot   afford  private   Kosovo   schools  without   the
income  from  his potential employment as a  linguist there. Pending  the  outcome  of  this
adjudication, he  planned to return with  his family to the United States so his children can
attend  school here.  It  is assumed  that he  has  returned  to  the  United  States  for  the  2022
–  2023  school year. Applicant will bring  his family  back to  Kosovo  if  he  gets his clearance,
and  he  eventually wants to retire there. (GX 1;  Tr. 4, 25  –  27, 39, 50  –  52)
Applicant  also  owns  three  properties  in  Kosovo,  which  he  purchased  between
2014 and 2018. During his background investigation and counterintelligence screening
for his linguist position, he estimated those properties were worth about $180,000 total.
At  his hearing,  he  testified  their  value  has  likely increased  significantly. When  he  is  in
Kosovo, Applicant and his family live in an apartment he owns. He leases the other two
properties to a friend who uses one as a bar and restaurant business, and the other as
storage for that business. (GX 1 – GX 3; Tr. 44 – 47)
Applicant  does  most  of  his  banking  through  U.S.-based  financial  institutions.
During his previous employment as a linguist, he opened a bank account in Kosovo for
his wife to use while he resided at the U.S. military facility. At one point, he had deposited
about  $12,000  USD  in  that  account,  but  he  now  estimates  there  is  about  $3,500
remaining. In his other U.S. accounts, Applicant has about $50,000 in retirement savings
and  investment  funds.  He  has  been  able  to  support  his  family  through  non-defense
industry jobs while in the United States, proceeds from the two properties he leases in
Kosovo, and a monthly disability benefit from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).
When they are in Kosovo, his wife works as a teacher. When they were last in the United
States, he worked as a delivery driver between November 2021 and May 2022. (GX 1 –
3; Tr. 54 – 58)
Applicant’s  parents  are  both  retired  teachers.  When  he  and  his  family  are  in
Kosovo, he visits or calls them almost every day. When he  is in the United States, he
calls them several times weekly. The same is true for his contact with his brothers and
sisters, a sister-in-law, and a niece who are resident citizens of Kosovo. Applicant also
has continuing contact with his best friend and his wife, and with two childhood friends
when he is in Kosovo, but their interactions are less frequent when he and his wife and
children are in the United States. None of Applicant’s family members or his friends are
employed  by  the  Kosovo  government;  nor  do  they  have  any  other  connection  to  the
government of Kosovo or any other foreign country. (GX 2; Tr. 40 – 43)
To properly assess the security significance of foregoing within the adjudicative
guideline at issue, I have taken administrative notice of certain facts regarding Kosovo as
presented  in  GX  4.  Additionally,  some  of  the  information  about  Kosovo  requires
examination  of  the  breakup  of  Yugoslavia  and  the  ensuing  Balkans  War  and  Kosovo
Conflict. To that end, I sua sponte have taken notice of information about that region and
current U.S. involvement there that is available on the U.S. Department of State website
(https://www.state.gov) and the CIA Factbook (https://www.cia.gov).
Since separating from Serbia and Yugoslavia, Kosovo has generally modeled its
system of governance on western democracies. Since the end of the Kosovo War in 1999,
the United States has been actively involved in helping Kosovo establish an independent
judiciary  and  to  provide  for  its  own  security.  The  U.S.  and  NATO  have  maintained  a
military presence in Kosovo as part of the Kosovo Force (KFOR) made up of troops from
28 countries. KFOR is still required in Kosovo to help counter instability caused by the
influx from foreign fighters, such as ISIS, and large numbers of migrants displaced by the
civil  war  in  Syria  and  ongoing  violence  in  Iraq  and  Kurdistan.  Additionally,  the  U.S.
Department  of  State  has  issued  travel  advisories  for  travel  in  certain  parts  of  Kosovo
where ethnic tensions and civil unrest continue to flare up and act as catalysts for terrorist
activities.
Kosovo’s political system  is premised  on  open  representation  of its citizens and
the  emphasis  on  individual  liberties  and  the  rule  of  law.  Nonetheless,  human  rights
violations are not uncommon, mostly affecting under-represented ethnic minorities. The
State Department’s 2021 Human Rights Executive Summary stated the following:
Significant  human  rights  issues  included  credible  reports  of:  serious
restrictions on free expression and media, including violence or threats of
violence  against  journalists;  serious  government  corruption  and  impunity;
and  crimes  involving  violence  or  threats  of  violence  targeting  ethnic
minorities or other marginalized communities. The government took steps
to  identify,  investigate,  prosecute,  and  punish  officials  who  committed
human  rights  abuses,  but  at  times  lacked  consistency.  Many  in  the
government, the opposition, civil society, and the media reported instances
of  senior  officials  engaging  in  corruption  or  acting  with  impunity.  The
government  sometimes  suspended,  removed  offenders  from  office,  or
transferred  the  accused,  and  the  justice  sector  sometimes  took  steps  to
prosecute and punish those officials who committed abuses, offenses, and
crimes. Many corrupt officials, however, continued to occupy public sector
positions.
Based  on  the  foregoing,  it  is  clear  that  Kosovo  strives  to  be  a  stable,
democratically-governed country,  with interests consistent with  those of  the European
Union  and  NATO.  Nonetheless,  there  is  a  continuing  need  for  a  U.S.-led  security
presence. Persistent ethnic strife, terrorist activities, an uneven human rights record, and
other  conditions  on  which  the  State  Department  has  based  its  travel  advisories  for
Kosovo,  all  support  a  finding  that  there  is  a  heightened  risk  associated  with  having
personal and financial ties there.
",False
"In response to the original SOR, Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c, and he
denied  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.d,  all  with  explanations.  He  included  a  narrative  statement
with his Answer. Applicant’s admissions and other statements are incorporated into the
findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits
submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 39  years old.  He was born in  Pakistan.  He spent part of his childhood
in  the   United   Kingdom   while   his  father  was  pursuing   a   graduate   degree   there.  After
returning  to  Pakistan,  Applicant graduated  from  an  international high  school in  Pakistan.
He then  earned  his bachelor’s degree  at a  university  in Europe.  (Answer; AE  C;  Tr. 37-
40)
Applicant  studied  hospitality  and  business  management,  and  that  was  his  first
career  after  college.  He  began  working  at  a  hotel  in  Europe  and  then  moved  to  the
United  States  in  2007  at  age  23  for  a  management  training  program  with  a  major
American hotel brand. (Answer; AE C; Tr. 39-40)
In 2012, Applicant changed careers and began a career in banking. He joined a
major U.S.  bank,  initially  in  the  sales  and  service  field.  In  2016,  he  earned  a  master’s
degree in business administration (MBA) through an executive program. Between 2012
and 2017, he held two jobs, one with a bank, and one with a resort.  In early 2020, he
transitioned to investment banking. Since March 2021, he has worked for another bank
as  a  licensed  investment  advisor.  He  has  applied  for  a  clearance  through  conditional
employment with a large accounting firm. He has not had a clearance before. (Answer;
AE C, AE E; GE 1; Tr. 8, 20, 34, 81-84)
Applicant  married  in  Pakistan  in  2008.  He  and  his  wife,  a  U.S.  citizen,  later
moved to the United States. He obtained permanent U.S. residency through his wife in
2009.  They  separated  in  2013.  Applicant  applied  for  U.S.  citizenship  in  2014,  and
became a U.S. citizen in January 2015. He and his wife divorced in 2018. They had no
children. (GE 1 at 9-10, 25-26; Tr. 41-43; AE A)
Applicant’s mother is a  citizen  of  Pakistan  residing  in the  United  States.  (SOR ¶
1.a.1)   She   has  been   a   permanent  U.S.  resident   since   2020,  and   she   lives  with
Applicant.  He described  their  relationship as “very  close.” (Answer; AE  D, AE  F; Tr. 19,
24, 46-47, 50)
Applicant’s mother went to  Pakistan  about  three  months before the  hearing, with
Applicant. She   still   owns a   home  in  Pakistan. Applicant’s   sister lives  in the  home  also.
Applicant  estimated   that  the   home   in  Pakistan   is  valued   at  several  hundred   thousand
U.S. dollars. He said if  he inherits the  home  after his mother dies, he  would sell it or give
the   home   to   his  sister.  Applicant  and   his  mother  opened   a   bank  account  in  Pakistan
after   his  father  died.   They   closed   the   account   a   year  later.   (Tr.  45-49,   51-52,  85,   89)
(The  date  of Applicant’s father’s death  is  either 9/19/2014  (GE  1  at 27) or  2017  (Tr.  48),
but whichever is correct it was several years ago).
Applicant  owns  his  own  home  in  the  U.S.  He  estimated  the  value  at  several
hundred thousand dollars. He has significant equity in the home, and knows how much
he owes on the mortgage. He owns no property in Pakistan. (Tr. 43-44; AE I)
SOR ¶ 1.a.2 alleges that Applicant has a cousin, C1, who is a citizen of Pakistan
residing in the United States. Applicant stated that his cousin is now a U.S. citizen, and
he lives in a large U.S. city with his family. Applicant speaks to this cousin a few times a
year. C1’s parents  live  in Pakistan  and  he  goes to  Pakistan  to  visit them.  (Answer; AE
H; Tr. 24, 54-57)
Applicant’s sister, age 37, lives in Pakistan. (SOR ¶ 1.b.1) She is not married and
has no children. (Tr. 85) She is a dress designer. She has visited the U.S. in the past,
but not recently, due to COVD-19 travel restrictions. (Tr. 25) Applicant speaks with her
several  times  a  month,  and  considers  them  to  be  close.  His  sister  came  to  live  with
Applicant  in  the  U.S.  for  a  time  but  preferred  what  Applicant  called  the  “luxurious”
lifestyle she leads in Pakistan, with drivers and maids. (AE G, Tr. 57-62)
Applicant has numerous aunts in Pakistan. (SOR ¶ 1.b.3) He has three maternal
aunts in Pakistan. He has contact with one of them a few times a year. He has not seen
or spoken to the other two aunts in several years. He has one paternal aunt in Pakistan
but they have no contact. One more maternal aunt is now a citizen and resident of the
United States, as are her children, Applicant’s cousins. (AE G; Tr. 38, 67-68)
Applicant has ten  maternal cousins. Five of them are citizens and residents of the
U.S. Five  of them  live  in Pakistan.  (SOR ¶  1.b.4) He  is close  to  one  of his U.S.  cousins
but  has  little  contact with   any   of   the  others.   They   have   some   contact for holiday   good
wishes. (AE G; Tr. 68-76)
Applicant also has Pakistani friends. (SOR ¶ 1.b.5) Most of them live in the U.S.
His interaction with them is brief, and often only on birthdays. (Tr. 25) He testified about
one friend in Pakistan, S, who has a construction business, and another friend, A, who
owns a restaurant. He saw both of them on his recent visit to Pakistan. (Tr. 76-78)
SOR ¶  1.c concerns an  uncle  (U1) (also  SOR ¶  1.b.2), who  is a retired  officer in
the   Pakistan   military.  (GE  1   at   34)   Applicant  has  limited   contact  with   him,   mostly   on
holidays and  birthdays. (AE  G)  Applicant said  U1,  his late  father’s brother, does not get
along   with   Applicant’s  mother.  He   retired   in   2005.  He  now   lives  in   the   family’s  village,
and  manages his farm. Applicant sees U1 at  family  events in Pakistan. (Tr. 26-27, 53-
54, 78-79, 86-87)
Applicant has other uncles in Pakistan, but he has little to no contact with them.
(Tr.  26,  64-66,  88)  If  one  of  these  uncles  is  referenced  in  SOR  ¶  1.b.2  instead  of  the
retired military officer, this is not sufficiently clear.
On  his  SCA,  Applicant  disclosed  yearly  travel  to  Pakistan  between  2012  and
2019.  (GE  1  at  61-62)  He  most  recently  visited  Pakistan  with  his  mother  in  February
2022 for about three weeks. He stayed with his sister at her home, which their mother
still  owns.  He  briefly  saw  one  of  his  uncles  once  (his  father’s  younger  brother)  and
briefly saw the cousin with whom he is close and who is a U.S. citizen who was visiting
Pakistan at the time. He did not see his other cousins. (Tr. 62-64)
Applicant  testified  that  in  his  current  job,  he  has  reporting  and  debriefing
requirements when he travels overseas. He has been through training and understands
the importance of doing so. (Tr. 20-21, 33-34)
SOR ¶ 1.d concerns a friend of Applicant’s, an Iraqi citizen residing in the United
States. Applicant disclosed her on his SCA because she was a bank client at the time,
and he wanted to be as honest as possible. They have not been in touch in “a very long
time.” (Tr. 28) They were never in a romantic relationship. He knows that she is married
and lives in the U.S. He did not want to discuss their professional banking relationship
out  of  respect  for  her  privacy.  She  contacted  him  three  months  before  the  hearing
seeking a copy of her recent bank statement. (Tr. 28, 29, 79-81)
Applicant testified that he is a proud American. He loves “to show that he comes
from  the  greatest country  in the  world.” He “would not  think twice”  about giving  his life
for the United States. He would not compromise its sovereignty or integrity. In working
for  a  financial  institution,  he  understands  the  importance  of  confidentiality,  as  well  as
adherence to rules and regulations, including “providing no favors to anyone under any
circumstances.” (Tr. 29-32, 35-37) He is a registered voter in his state. (AE A)
Applicant is well-regarded at work and is considered a “top performer.” (AE J) Mr.
B,  an  employee  of  his  prospective  employer,  also  a  personal  friend,  attested  to
Applicant’s  loyalty  to  the  U.S.,  as  well  as  to  his  professional  skills.  Mr.  B  recruited
Applicant to his prospective position. (AE J)
Applicant’s  former  supervisor,  F,  has  known  him  since  2014.  F  attested  to
Applicant’s  “tremendous  growth”  both  professionally  and  as  a  human  being.  He  is  a
team  player,  well-informed,  a  star  performer,  and  is  always  willing  to  assist  his  peers
and mentors. F has an enduring respect for Applicant’s work ethic and problem-solving
skills. (AE J)
A  personal  reference,  Dr.  H,  regards  Applicant  as  honest,  dependable,  and
respectful.  He  is  helpful,  supportive,  cheerful,  reliable,  and  trustworthy.  Applicant  has
always been grateful for the opportunity to build his life and future in the United States.
(AE J)
The Islamic Republic  of Pakistan (Pakistan): (AN I)
Pakistan  is  a  federal  parliamentary  republic.  The  prime  minister  is  head  of
government, and the president is head of state. The country has endured direct military
rule  for  nearly  half  of  its  time  as  an  independent  nation.  The  United  States  has  had
diplomatic  relations  with  Pakistan  since  Pakistan’s  creation  in  1947.  Their  relationship
has  been  guided  by  their  common  interests  in  a  peaceful,  stable,  and  prosperous
region.
The  U.S.  State  Department  currently  advises  American  citizens  to  reconsider
travel  to  Pakistan  (Level  3)  due  to  COVID-19,  the  risk  of  terrorism,  and  sectarian
violence.  The  United  States  remains  concerned  about  the  continued  presence  of
terrorist  and  other  extremist  groups  in  Pakistan.  Terrorist  groups  continue  plotting
attacks  in  Pakistan.  A  local  history  of  terrorism  and  ongoing  ideological  aspirations  of
violence by extremist elements have led to indiscriminate attacks on civilian as well as
local military and police targets. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting
transportation hubs, markets, shopping malls, military installations, airports, universities,
tourist  locations,  schools,  hospitals,  places  of  worship,  and  government  facilities.
Terrorists have targeted U.S. diplomats and diplomatic facilities in the past.
The State Department’s most recent human-rights report on Pakistan reflects the
reported  commission  of  human  rights  violations  by  elements  within  Pakistan  and  the
Pakistani  government.  The  most  serious  human-rights  problems  in  Pakistan  include
extrajudicial  and  targeted  killings,  disappearances,  torture,  the  lack  of  rule  of  law,  and
sectarian  violence.  Government  corruption  is  a  serious  problem,  and  the  lack  of
accountability and failure to prosecute these abuses has led to a culture of impunity.
Iraq: (AN II)
I have read and considered the facts set forth in AN II, concerning Iraq. The only
allegation  concerning Applicant’s connections to  Iraq  which makes those facts relevant
here is SOR ¶ 1.d. SOR ¶ 1.d concerns a  banking  client  of Applicant’s who  is an  Iraqi
citizen  and  U.S.  resident,  a  woman  who  Applicant  disclosed  on  his  SCA  out  of  the
abundance  of  caution.  As  addressed  in  the  Analysis  section,  below,  their  contact  is
largely professional and infrequent, and not an ongoing security concern. I therefore see
little reason to discuss the facts in AN II about Iraq any further.
",True
"The  SOR  alleged  under  foreign  influence  that  Applicant’s  wife  is  a  citizen  of
Tunisia,  his  mother-in-law  and  father-in  law  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Tunisia;  his
sister-in-law is a citizen and resident of Tunisia; his brother in-law is a citizen of Tunisia
and resident of Kuwait; and Applicant provided about $500 a month to his mother-in-law
who  is  a  citizen  and  resident  of  Tunisia.  (SOR  ¶¶1.a  through  1.e.)  Applicant  admitted
SOR allegations ¶¶1.a through 1.d with explanations, but he denied 1.e. (Item 2)
In  his  response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  denied,  with  brief  comments,  the  SOR
allegations pertaining to financial considerations  (SOR ¶¶ 2.a. through 2.n.) as well as
SOR ¶ 1.e.  The SOR  alleges 11 delinquent  financial accounts totaling approximately
$53,382, garnishment of  wages in 2019, and indebtedness to the federal and state tax
agencies for delinquent  taxes.  Applicant’s  admissions and  comments  are  incorporated
herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due
consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact:
Background
Applicant is a 41-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving
as  an  aircraft  mechanic  with  his  current  employer  since  February  15,  2022.  He  was
previously  employed  by  other  employers  as  a  contractor  since  2015.  Applicant  is
divorced, but he remarried in October 2019. He has two children from his first marriage,
and a third child born in 2020 with his current wife. Applicant served on active duty in the
United States Marine Corps (USMC) from 1997 to 2004, in the Air National Guard from
2004 to 2005, and returned to active duty in the USMC from 2005 to  2014. He retired
from  service  in  2014.  He  received  his  undergraduate  degree  in  April  2022.  He  was
granted a security clearance in 2007. (Item 3)
Financial Considerations
General source information pertaining to the financial accounts discussed below
can be found in the following exhibits: Item 2 (Answer to the SOR, dated November 13,
2021);  Item  3  (SF  86,  dated  October  10,  2019);  Item  4  (Equifax  Credit  Report,  dated
December 1, 2021; Item 5 (Credit Report, dated January 7, 2020).
In his SF 86, Applicant acknowledged having several financial issues. He reported
federal and state tax debt of $8,000, a vehicle repossession and a 2019, $600 bi-weekly
wage garnishment. (Item 3)
In February and March 2020, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator with the
U.S.  Office  of  Personnel  Management.  During  that  interview,  he  verified  the  financial
issues he had previously reported in his SF 86, but stated that the federal and state tax
returns were filed and that he owes about $11,000 for both. At one point, he stated that
no  wages  were  garnished.  He  either  disputed  the  other  accounts  or  stated  that  the
accounts  had  been  removed  from  his  credit  report.  Applicant  was  confronted  with  the
alleged accounts on the SOR by the investigator. (Item 6)
A  review of  Applicant’s  credit  reports from 2020 –  2021 indicates that there  are
several delinquent accounts. In his Answer to the SOR, he denied delinquent accounts.
He offered no documentation, such as repayment agreements, statements from creditors,
receipts, or cancelled checks, to reflect any resolution efforts even though he has been
employed since 2015.
The SOR alleged 11 still-delinquent accounts totaling approximately $53,982, as
set forth below:
SOR  ¶  2.a.  is  an  automobile  loan  with  an  unpaid  balance  of  $46,790  that  was
placed for collection and charged off. (Item 5 at 1) Applicant denied the allegation,  and
stated that he is looking into possible fraud on this account by his ex-wife. (Item 6) The
account has not been resolved.
SOR ¶ 2.b. is a medical account in the amount of $1,961. Applicant denied this
account  and  stated  that  his family never incurred  any medical  expenses.  (Item  2) The
account has not been resolved.
SOR ¶ 2.c. is a military collection account with an unpaid balance of $1,635 that
was placed for collection  and charged off. Initially, Applicant did not recall the account
and then stated that he paid the account in full in 2014.  (Item 6) The account has not
been resolved.
SOR ¶ 2.d. is a collection account in the amount of $931. Applicant disagrees with
this account although he remembers living in the apartment complex. He stated that he
would investigate the account and pay by December 2021.  The account has not been
resolved.
SOR ¶ 2.e is a cable account in collection for $550. Applicant stated that he was
unaware of the account and claimed that he has never received a collection notice. He
also explained that his ex-wife has the cable equipment and perhaps did not return it. The
account is unresolved.
SOR ¶ 2.f  is a collection  account in the amount of $484 for a wireless account.
Applicant  denied  this account  and stated that  he  was  unaware  of  it.  He  stated that  he
would investigate the account and provide information within five days.  He did not submit
any information.
SOR ¶ 2. g is another medical account in collection in the amount of $322. He is
unaware of the account and stated he would provide information within five days. He did
not submit any information. The account is still unresolved.
SOR ¶ 2. h is a collection account in the amount of $241. Applicant stated that he
never had an account with this company. He stated that he would investigate the account.
SOR  ¶  2.  i  is  a  collection  account  in  the  amount  of  $191.  He  does  not  know
anything about the account. He believes that it is a school account for his children.
SOR ¶ 2.j is another medical account in collection in the amount of $160. He has
no knowledge of this account but will investigate. The account is still not resolved.
SOR ¶ 2.k is a collection account for a phone  in the amount of $117. Applicant
does not recall this account and believes he never had this phone service.
SOR  ¶  2.l  concerns  Applicant’s  indebtedness  to  the  Federal  government  for
delinquent taxes in the amount of $7,000 for tax years 2017 and 2018. In his Answer to
the SOR, he stated that he owed nothing on his 2018 taxes and is trying to file his 2017
tax returns but his ex-wife will not disclose her earnings to him. However, in his 2019 SF
86, Applicant disclosed that he owed about $8,000. He also disclosed that he failed to file
his federal and state tax returns from 2017. (Item 3)
SOR ¶ 2.m is for delinquent state taxes for tax years 2017 and 2018 in the amount
of $5,500. In his answer to the SOR, he stated that he did not owe anything.  In his subject
interview Applicant  admitted  owing  the  $5,500.  (Item  3) In  Applicant’s  response  to  the
FORM, he stated that he had been mistaken about owing state taxes. (Item 7)
SOR ¶ 2.n concerns a wage garnishment in November 2019 in the approximate
amount of $600 bi-weekly. He denies that he ever worked for this company and that there
was no garnishment.
In  Applicant’s response  to  the  FORM, Applicant admitted that he did not keep a
“close eye” on his credit report. He stated that he was somewhat negligent in this area
and  did  not  understand  the  process  for  clearing  up  or  disputing  items  effectively.  He
believes he has a total of $31,000, credit card debt on three small car loans and a few
credit  cards  totaling  $13,000  He  blames  his  ex-wife  for  some  collection  accounts  and
wants to investigate possible fraud.  (Item 7)
Applicant, in that response to FORM, said that he was mistaken about owing state
taxes for any previous years. He believes that he does not owe anything.  He does owe
back taxes for 2017 for Federal taxes, but is waiting for a total amount from the IRS and
he  hired  a  legal  tax  defense  firm  to  file  his  taxes  for  2017.  He  had  no  intention  of
withholding tax from the government. Also, he explained he was working in Kuwait that
entire year and was told that  he  was in a  “Tax Free  Zone.” He wants to  pay his taxes.
(Item 7)
Applicant’s net monthly  salary  is $4,200. He receives $4,500 from his GI bill for
attending college. He stated that his total monthly income is $7,500 net. He reports his
total  monthly  debt  as  $4,530.  His  net  remainder  is  $3,145.  He  has  no  other  overdue
accounts. He does not gamble or drink.
Applicant submitted a property order attachment to his divorce judgement. He also
submitted his April 2022 pay slip which showed no further garnishment.
Foreign Influence
Applicant is a U.S. citizen by birth. In October 2019, Applicant married his second
wife who is a citizen of Tunisia. Applicant met her when he was working in Kuwait. She
now resides with her husband in their U.S. home. She is a legal resident of the United
States, and received her resident alien card on July 27, 2021. Applicant’s wife has been
in the United States since 2019. She wants to build a future in the United States with her
husband.  At  the  time  of  his  subject  interview,  Applicant  stated  that  his  wife  was
unemployed, but had been self-employed in Tunisia. (Item 6) Applicant and his wife have
a new born son. (Item 2) She is a Christian and she and Applicant attend church together.
(Item 2) Applicant’s wife speaks to her family, but the record did not specify the frequency.
(SOR ¶ 1.a)
Applicant’s mother-in-law and father-in-law are citizens and residents of Tunisia.
Applicant does not talk to them and has not for about one year. In his SF 86, he noted
that  he  had  weekly  contact  with  his  mother-in-law,  but  Applicant  states  that  he  had  a
disagreement with his mother-in-law and does not speak to her. His father-in-law does
not communicate frequently with Applicant due to the language barrier. SOR ¶1.b  (Item
2) Applicant did see him in person in 2019, and he sometimes texts him  using a translator.
(Item 3) Applicant’s parents-in-law have no connections with the Tunisian government.
Applicant’s sister-in-law is a citizen and resident of Tunisia. In his answer to the
SOR, Applicant stated that he has no relation with her at all. He stated that he met her
twice in Tunisia on vacation. She has no connection to the government of Tunisia. She is
an agricultural engineer. (Item 6) SOR ¶1.c
Applicant’s brother-in-law is a citizen of Tunisia, but Applicant states that he is not
a resident of Kuwait. Also, in his answer, Applicant states that he now lives in the U.S. He
lived with Applicant in Kuwait for a few months. (Item 2) Applicant states that he also lived
with him in the U.S. He has no connection with the Tunisian government. (Item 6) SOR
¶1.d
Applicant, in his answer, denied that he provides support to his mother-in-law, but
he  admitted  that  he  sends  her  about  $500  each  month  to  cover  some  of  his  wife’s
expenses.  His  wife bought  a  car before he met her and she has a  car loan. Applicant
stated that he does not provide support to his mother-in-law, but sends her money to pay

Administrative Notice
Tunisia  is  a  constitutional  republic  with  a  multiparty,  unicameral  parliamentary
system and a president with powers specified in the constitution. In 2019 the country held
parliamentary  and  presidential  elections  in  the  first  transition  of  power  since  its  first
democratic elections in 2014. In October 2019 the country held free and fair parliamentary
elections that resulted in the Nahada Party winning a plurality of the votes, granting the
party the opportunity to form a new government.
Significant  human  rights  issues  exist  in Tunisia  including reports of  unlawful or
arbitrary killings, primarily by terrorist groups; allegations of torture by government agents;
arbitrary  arrests  and  detentions  of  suspects  under  antiterrorism  or  emergency  laws;
undue restrictions on freedom of expression and the press, including criminalization of
libel; widespread corruption, although the government took steps to combat it; societal
violence  and  threats  of  violence  targeting  lesbian,  gay,  bisexual,  transgender,  and
intersex persons; criminalization of consensual same-sex sexual conduct that resulted in
arrests and abuse by security forces; and the worst forms of child labor.
The U.S. Department of State continues to assess Tunisia at Level 4 (out of 4),
which indicates that travelers should not travel to the country due to crime, civil unrest,
poor health infrastructure, kidnapping, and arbitrary arrest and detention of U.S. citizens.

The People’s Republic of China  (PRC)
The  PRC  is a  large  and  economically  powerful country, with  a  population  of over
1.4   billion   people.   The   PRC   has   an   authoritarian   government,  dominated   by   the
Chinese   Communist  Party.  The   PRC   has   a   poor  record  with   respect  to   human   rights
and  suppresses political dissent.  Its practices  include  official repression  of  the  freedoms
of  speech, religion, movement, association, and  assembly; forced  confessions; torture;
mistreatment of prisoners; and  arbitrary arrest, detention, and killings.
The PRC engages in espionage against the United States and is one of the two
most  active  collectors  of  U.S.  economic  intelligence  and  technology.  The  PRC  also
sometimes  uses  coercion  or  blackmail  to  manipulate  its  citizens  overseas  to  conduct
influence operations on behalf of the PRC, such as threatening ethnic Uyghurs living in
the United States with imprisonment of their family members in China. Additionally, the
PRC  targets  individuals  in  other  countries  to  support  its  acquisition  of  foreign
technology.  The  PRC’s  “Thousand  Talents  Program”  seeks  to  recruit  individuals
primarily, but not exclusively, from relevant diaspora populations and recent emigrants
from the PRC, as well as foreign national experts whose recruitment the PRC views as
necessary to its scientific and technical modernization, especially with regard to defense
technology.

Applicant’s  wife  obtained  one,  but  has  been  unable  to  return  to  the  PRC  since  the
COVID crisis. (Tr. 39) While the sales process has been pending, Applicant’s wife has
been  renting  it.  Applicant  does  not  know  how  much  his  wife  is  receiving  in  rental
payments. (Tr. 36)
Applicant’s  wife  intends  to  become  a  United  States  citizen,  but  is  waiting  until
after  she  sells  the  condominium.  Per  Applicant,  if  she  became  a  U.S.  citizen,  it  would
complicate the sales process because PRC law discourages foreigners from engaging
in PRC real estate transactions. (Tr. 38)
Applicant’s  stepson  is  in  his  mid-twenties.  (GE  1  at  34)  He  is  a  citizen  of  the

Applicant’s  parents-in-law  are  citizens  and  residents  of  the  PRC.  Applicant’s
father-in-law  worked  for  the  PRC’s  department  of  agriculture.  (Tr.  30)  He  is  retired.
Applicant  is  not  sure  what  his  mother-in-law  did  for  a  living.  Applicant’s  parents-in-law
are in extremely poor health. His wife talks to them approximately every other day and
uses her Chinese pension to pay their medical expenses. (Tr. 41, 43)
Applicant’s  wife  maintains  a  bank  account  in  PRC  to  help  her  parents.  (Tr.  31)
The  account  has  a  balance  of  approximately  $24,000.  (Tr.  31)  Her  PRC  pension  is

Administrative Notice
The PRC is an authoritarian state in which the Chinese Communist Party. (HE I
at 1) is the paramount authority. (HE I at 1) The PRC is one of the most active collectors
of illicitly gained technology in the world. (HE 1 at 1) The PRC National Intelligence law
of 2017 forms the baseline of the modern data collection regime and compels all PRC
firms and entities to support, assist, and cooperate with the PRC intelligence services,
creating  a  legal  obligation  for  those  entities  to  turn  over  data  collected  abroad  and
domestically to the PRC. (HE IV at 6) The PRC government has the legal and physical
capability to compel any Chinese citizen to turn over information. (HE IV at 1) The PRC
has  expansive  efforts in  place to  acquire  U.S.  technology,  and  continues  to use  cyber
espionage to support its strategic development goals. (HE V at 1) Most cyber operations
against  U.S. private  industry that have  been  detected  are focused  on  cleared defense
contractors or information technology firms. (HE V at 40)

Under Guideline B, the SOR alleges that Applicant’s mother, father, sisters, and
mother-in-law are citizens and residents of China, and that she provides her mother with
approximately  $1,000  in  financial  support  annually.  Applicant  admitted  all  SOR

(Item 3 at 34-38; Item 4 at 3)
The PRC is an authoritarian state in which the  Chinese Communist Party is the
paramount authority. China is one of two countries that pose the greatest espionage and
cyber-attack threats to the United States. China is the most active strategic competitor
responsible for cyber espionage against the U.S.  Government, corporations and allies.
The PRC has expansive efforts in place to acquire U.S. technology, including sensitive
trade  secrets  and  proprietary  information  to  enhance  its  global  strategic,  military,
diplomatic, and economic influence. China’s focus is on obtaining U.S. information and
technologies beneficial to  its military modernization and economic development.  About
80 percent of all economic espionage prosecutions brought by the U.S. Department of
Justice allege conduct that would benefit the  PRC, and at least 60 percent of all trade
secret theft cases have at least some nexus to China. (HE I)
China’s intelligence services, as well as private companies and entities, frequently
seek to exploit Chinese citizens or persons with family ties to China who can use their
insider  access  to  steal  secrets.  The  PRC  sometimes  uses  coercion  or  blackmail  to
manipulate  its  citizens  overseas  to  conduct  influence  operations  on  behalf  of  China.
Additionally,  the  PRC targets  individuals in  other countries  to  support its  acquisition of
foreign technology; seeks to recruit individuals primarily, but not exclusively, from relevant
diaspora  populations  and  recent  emigrants  from  the  PRC,  as  well  as  foreign  national
experts  whose  recruitment  the  PRC  views  as  necessary  to  its  scientific  and  technical
modernization,  especially  with  regard  to  defense  technology.  The  PRC  also  has
significant human rights issues including pervasive and intrusive technical surveillance,
arbitrary  detention,  forced  labor,  trafficking  in  persons,  and  has  been  found  to  have
committed  crimes  against  humanity  against  members  of  ethnic  and  religious  minority
groups in the China. (HE I)

spouse there in 2004, through a mutual friend. They married in Kyrgyzstan in 2009. She
became a naturalized U.S. citizen and  was issued a U.S. passport in May 2010.  They
married  in  the  United  States  in  2013,  because  the  foreign  country  in  which  Applicant

Misuse of Information Technology and Personal Conduct
In  June  2016,  Applicant  downloaded  and  viewed  pornographic  material  on  his
corporate laptop in violation of  company policy. He had been working  overseas for his
then-employer, as a federal systems technologist, since approximately January 2015. At
the time of the incident, he was away from his spouse; his personal laptop was broken;
and  he  used  his  work  laptop  to  download  and  view  pornography  at  his  spouse’s
suggestion while she was on the phone with him. Although he had previously used his
work  laptop  for  personal  reasons,  this  was  the  only  instance  in  which  he  did  so  for
pornography.  He  did  not  engage  in  this  activity  over  a  U.S.  Government  network.  His
supervisor  notified  him  in  November  2016  that  he  violated  company  policy  by
downloading  inappropriate  material  on  his  company  computer,  and  he  accepted  his
supervisor’s offer to  resign  in lieu of termination. His employer kept him on board until

October  2017  background  interview.  Although  he  used  his  work  laptop  and  personal
laptop  interchangeably,  he acknowledged  that  he  exercised bad  judgment  in using his
work laptop to download and view pornography and he should have known better since
he  works  in  information  technology.  He  did  not  have  any  previous  incidents  of
unauthorized use of  information technology,  and  as of  the date of the hearing,  he had
not  had  any  subsequent  such  incidents.  He  received  bi-annual  training  from  his

"In  his  Answer,  Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations  (¶¶  1.a-1.e).  His
admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 61 years old.  He is a citizen of Jordan, but was  born in Kuwait and
grew up there. He came to the United States in 1979 on a student visa. He married a U.S.
citizen in 1982, and they divorced in 1984. He became a U.S. citizen in August 1989. The
following month, he moved back to Kuwait for a year. After the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in
1990, he returned to the United States but traveled to Jordan to marry his current wife in
1991. She is now a dual U.S. and Jordanian citizen. They have three adult children who
are dual U.S. and Jordanian citizens. He earned a bachelor’s degree in 1997, a master’s
degree in 2000, and in 2015 a doctoral degree through an online institution. In 2002, he
and his family moved back to Kuwait, and lived there until 2017. (Item 4, 5, 6)
While  living  in  Kuwait  from  2002  –  2017,  Applicant  worked  for  several  different
foreign companies. In this employment, he provided advice and support to several Kuwaiti
ministries and to a Kuwaiti scientific research institute. He is currently employed by a U.S.
government contractor as an Arabic interpreter and linguist. (Item 4, 5, 6)
In a background  interview,  Applicant stated that he does not have allegiance to
any country over the United States and that he would not betray this country. (Item 5, 6)
The SOR alleges:
SOR ¶ 1.a: One of Applicant’s sisters is a Jordanian citizen residing in Kuwait. He
admits the allegation. He reported having weekly contact with her by phone. (GE 5, 6)
SOR ¶  1.b: One of Applicant’s sisters is a citizen and resident of Jordan. He admits
the allegation. He reported having weekly contact with her by phone. (GE 5, 6)
SOR ¶  1.c:  Applicant maintains contact with  a friend who is a Lebanese citizen,
and  who  resides  in  Kuwait.  He  admits  the  allegation.  He  reported  having  occasional
contact with him by phone and in person. (GE 5, 6)
SOR ¶  1.d: Applicant maintains contact with a friend who is a dual citizen of Turkey
and  Lebanon,  and  who  resides  in  Kuwait.  This  friend  also  works  for  the  Turkish
Ambassador at the Turkish  Embassy in  Kuwait.  He  admits  the  allegation.  He  reported
having occasional contact with him by phone and in person. He stated that he has been
his friend for many years. (GE 5, 6)
SOR ¶  1.e: After becoming a U.S. citizen in August 1989, Applicant returned to live
in Kuwait from September 1989 – October 1990, and from March 2002 – June 2017. He
admits the allegation. He stated that he moved because his father was sick in 1989, and
in 2002, he was offered a job. (GE 5, 6)
Jordan
In AN 1, the Government included information from the U.S. Department of State
as  of  January  2022,  about  the  United  States’  relations  with  Jordan  and  the  current
conditions in that country. I take administrative notice of the following facts:
The  U.S.  Department  of  State  has  assessed  Amman  as  being  a  high  threat
location  for  terrorism  directed  at  or  affecting  official  U.S.  government  interests.  Local,
regional, and transnational terrorist groups and individual extremists have demonstrated
a willingness and capacity to plan and execute attacks in Jordan.
Jordan continues to face a threat of persistent terrorist activity, both domestically
and along it borders. Part of the threat is due to its proximity to the conflicts in Syria and
Iraq, as well as its rejection of the Salafi-Jihadi interpretations of Islam.
Violent  extremist  groups  in  Syria  and  Iraq,  including  ISIS,  have  conducted  or
supported attacks in Jordan, and continue to plot against local security forces, U.S. and
western interests, and soft public targets.
Jordan has taken a prominent role in the coalition to defeat ISIS. However, regional
issues  and  U.S  involvement  in  the  region  can  inflame  anti-U.S./western  sentiment.
Recent surveys show that more than 80% of the population holds an unfavorable view of
the U.S. government.
There have been significant human rights issues in Jordan. The government has
taken some limited steps to investigate, prosecute, and punish officials who committed
abuses.
Lebanon
In AN 2, the Government included information from the U.S. Department of State
as  of  January  2022,  about  the  United  States’  relations  with  Lebanon  and  the  current
conditions in county. I take administrative notice of the following facts:
The  U.S.  Department  of  State  has  urged  U.S.  citizens  to  reconsider  travel  to
Lebanon  due  to  crime,  terrorism,  armed  conflict,  civil  unrest,  kidnapping,  and  our
embassy’s limited capacity to provide support to U.S. citizens. It advises a “Do Not Travel”
warning to the border and refugee areas due to the potential for armed conflict.
The  Syrian  conflict has affected  the  county  economically  and  socially. More than
a   million  Syrian   refugees  have   strained  the   country’s weak  infrastructure  and  ability   to
deliver social services.
Terrorist groups operating in Lebanon include ISIS, and Hizballah, which is closely
allied with Iran. Hizballah has a strong influence in the country and actively participates
in the political system and runs social programs.
Hizballah has been responsible for terrorist attacks that have killed U.S. citizens
and  military  personnel.  Its  presence  continues  to  impede  effective  government  action
against terrorist incidents.
The  U.S.  has  recently  prosecuted  several  persons  connected  to  Lebanon  and
Hizballah for espionage, terrorism, and export violations.
There  have  been  significant  human  rights  issues  in  Lebanon,  although  the
government  structure  exists  to  prosecute  and  punish  officials  who  committed  abuses,
government officials enjoyed a measure of impunity.
Turkey
In AN 3, the Government included information from the U.S. Department of State
as  of  January  2022,  about  the  United  States’  relations  with  Turkey  and  the  current
conditions in county. I take administrative notice of the following facts:
Turkey  is a  NATO ally, a  regional  partner, and  an  important security  partner. The
U.S. has committed to  improving its  relationship with Turkey.
The U.S. Department of State urges travelers to exercise increased caution due to
terrorism and arbitrary detentions. Parts of Turkey have increased risk, including areas
near the Syrian border. Terrorist attacks have occurred in Turkey over the last several
years.
Terror  groups  continue   plotting   possible   attacks  in  Turkey.  Terrorists   have
previously attacked  U.S. interests in Turkey, including  the  U.S. Embassy  in Ankara, the
U.S. Consulate General in Istanbul, and the  U.S. Consulate in Adana.
The  U.S. has sanctioned  Turkey’s defense  industry  for engaging   in transactions
with a Russian arms export entity.
Turkey is a member of the coalition to defeat ISIS. It has provided air space and
facilities for coalition operations in Iraq and Syria.
There have been significant human rights issues in Turkey. The government has
used  anti-terror  legislation  to  restrict  freedoms  and  compromise  the  rule  of  law.  There
have  been  politically  motivated  reprisals,  including  violence  and  threats  of  violence
against persons in opposition to or critical of the government.
Kuwait
In AN 4, the Government included information from the U.S. Department of State
as  of  January  2022,  about  the  United  States’  relations  with  Kuwait  and  the  current
conditions in county. I take administrative notice of the following facts:
The U.S. and Kuwait have a long history of friendship and cooperation. In 1991,
the  U.S.  led  a multinational coalition  to  liberate  Kuwait  from  Iraqi occupation.  In  2003,
Kuwait provided a platform for operations in Iraq, and has played a similar role in the fight
to defeat ISIS. Kuwait is also a partner in U.S counterterrorism efforts.
In  the  2021  Country  Reports  on  Human  Rights  Practices  issued  by  the  U.S.
Department of State, it identified human rights concerns in Kuwait. The concerns included
credible  reports  of  torture  or  cruel,  inhuman,  or  degrading  treatment  or  punishment  by
government agents; arbitrary arrest; serious restrictions on free expression, the internet, and
the media; and substantial interference with the freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom
of association.

first  visit  to  the  Philippines  and  met  her  father  and  children.  He  has  had  no  contact
(physical or verbal) with her father after the 2018 visit. Between 2013 and 2016, Applicant
provided  financial  assistance  (about  $250  per  month)  to  his  stepdaughters  in  the
Philippines. The money was to assist them with their expenses while in school. Applicant
has  not  provided  any  financial  assistance  to  his  stepdaughters  since  2016,  except  for
small presents during special occasions. He has provided limited financial assistance to
his  stepson  who  has  been  living  with  Applicant’s  son  while  in  college.  Two  of  his
stepchildren  are  currently  U.S.  residents.  He  does  not  know  whether  any  of  his
stepchildren are naturalized U.S. citizens.
Applicant testified that in 2019, he and his wife determined that their marriage was
not working out and they are considering a divorce. They stopped living together in April
2022 when their house rental contract ended. He is waiting for the statutory separation
period to lapse to file for divorce. (Tr. 32)
As amended, the SOR alleges that Applicant: is indebted to the IRS for $11,617
for tax year (TY) 2015 (SOR ¶ 1.a); failed to timely file his federal and state income tax
returns for TYs 2016, 2017, and 2018 (SOR ¶ 1.b); owed a bank $55,136 for a delinquent
2014  loan  (SOR  ¶  1.c);  and  owed  another  bank  $2,446  for  a  delinquent  credit-card
account (SOR ¶ 1.d). Under Guideline B, it alleges that his father-in-law (SOR ¶ 2.a) and
two stepchildren are citizens and residents of the Philippines, and that he provides $250
monthly in financial support to his stepchildren (SOR ¶ 2.b). He denied all of the financial
allegations and admitted the foreign influence allegations with explanations.
Applicant blames his wife for his financial problems and for him not filing his income
tax returns on time. He explained that while unemployed after his retirement, she would
withdraw $1,000 from their joint checking account without giving him prior notice. (Tr. 37
-38)  He  testified  that  she  refused  to  provide  him  with  documents  and  information  he
required to file his income tax returns, and refused to file income tax returns with him. (Tr.
83 – 84)
Concerning his TY 2015 debt to the IRS, Applicant explained his wife refused to
sign the income tax return as a joint return and he had to file as married filing separate.
The  change  in  filing  status  caused  an  increase  in  his  tax  liability.  In  March  2021,  he
convinced his wife to file amended income tax returns for TYs 2015 and 2017 as married
filing jointly, and he filed them both. He believes that when the IRS approves the amended
tax returns, his tax liability will be reduced.
According to Applicant and his accountant, he owes the IRS $1,456 for TY 2015;
he received a refund of $2,028 for TY 2017; he owes $2,190 for TY 2018; $6,978 for TY
2019;  and  $10,034  for  TY  2020;  for  a  total  balance  of  past  due  Federal  taxes  of
$18,639.00. (AE 5) For state A, Applicant owes $1,094 in income taxes for TY 2015; and
$1,525 for TY 2017. For state B, he owes $6,015 in income taxes for TY 2018; $3,254 for
TY 2019;  and  $1,850 for TY 2020.  (AE  5) Most  of  these facts  were  not alleged  in  the
SOR. As such, I will only consider these facts to determine the possible applicability of
the mitigating conditions.
Applicant  claimed  he  verified  the  balances  he  owes  per  TY  with  an  IRS
representative in August 2022. He stated he entered into a payment plan with the IRS
promising to pay a minimum of $500.00 each month. His intent is to pay $1,000.00 each
month to resolve his tax debt in the shortest period possible. As of his August 12, 2022
email, he had not received the approved IRS payment plan in the mail. He did not present
documentary evidence to corroborate the IRS accepted his TY 2015 amended income
tax return or that he has an IRS approved payment plan for his outstanding tax debt.
Applicant claimed that he timely filed his TYs 2018 and 2019 income tax returns
and the IRS rejected them because of problems with his TYs 2015 and 2017 income tax
returns. I note that the IRS Wage and Income Transcript for TY 2018 shows that as of
April 15, 2019, he had not filed his TY 2018 income tax return. Applicant’s documentary
evidence shows that his accountant filed his TYs 2018 and 2019 income tax returns in
March 2021. (See Answer to the SOR; Tr. 80 – 81; AE 5)
Applicant submitted an August 2022 letter from his accountant indicating that he
had just prepared Applicant’s income tax return for TY 2021. Applicant testified he did not
apply  for  or  receive  an  extension  to  file,  so  his  filing  would  be  late.  (Tr.  79  - 80)  The
accountant stated Applicant would owe the IRS $6,000 and his state $1,600 for TY 2021.
Applicant claimed he had saved $22,000 to pay his delinquent income taxes. He intended
to use $7,600 to pay his TY 2021 taxes, and reserved $14,400 to pay delinquent taxes
for  prior  years.  Applicant  presented  no  documentary  evidence  to  show  he  had  saved
$22,000 or that he paid his TY 2021 income taxes. (AE 5)
When  asked  why  it  took  him  so  long  to  address  his  delinquent  income  taxes,
Applicant claimed he had been addressing other delinquent debts first and did not have
the resources to pay all the debts at the same time. (Tr. 62) His current income is $94,000
a year. He has been earning over $90,000 a year since 2016. (Tr. 25 - 26) Additionally,
he  receives  $2,000  per  month  from  his  retired  pension  and  $1,200  per  month  from
disability pay. (Tr. 28)
SOR  ¶  1.c  alleged  that  Applicant  owed  a  bank  $55,136  for  a  delinquent  2014
consolidation loan. Applicant took the loan to consolidate debts that accumulated during
his  service.  He  retired  from  the  military  in  October  2014  and  was  not  able  to  find
employment until February 2015, which caused him to default on the loan. The creditor
obtained  a  judgment  against  Applicant  that  was  later  placed  for  collection  and  then
charged off. He settled the debt for $25,000 on May 13, 2021, after he received the SOR
in June 2020. (Tr. 54, 58; SOR Answer)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleged that Applicant owed a bank $2,446 for a delinquent joint credit-
card  account  he  opened  in  2012.  The  account  became  delinquent  in  2015,  and  was
charged off. Applicant contacted the creditor in May 2021, established a payment plan,
and paid it off in February 2022. (SOR Answer)
Applicant  stated  that  he  received  training  during  his  military  career  to  prevent
financial problems. Throughout his entire military career, Applicant knew how important it
was  to  maintain  good  credit  and  establish  a  track  record  of  financial  responsibility  to
maintain security clearance eligibility. (Tr. 23)
Applicant highlighted his military service and expressed his undivided loyalty to the
United States. He was deployed eight times with most of those deployments to combat
or dangerous zones in the Middle East. (Tr. 27) He credibly testified that his in-laws and
stepchildren in the Philippines could not be used to coerce or intimidate him into revealing
classified information, and that he would report any attempt to do so. (Tr. at 35, 40, 50-
51)
Applicant’s witness testified that he met Applicant six year ago at a cigar lounge
while smoking a cigar. He considers Applicant to be  a very close confidant and friend,
and he trusts him implicitly. He trusts Applicant with his life. He believes Applicant is a
patriot that he is loyal to the United States, and he would never betray the security of the
United States. (Tr. 92 – 93)

"Applicant  admitted  to  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a.~1.e.,  and  1.i.  and  1.j.  He
denied  SOR  allegation  ¶  1.f.~1.h.,  1.k.  and  2.a.  and  2.b.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 69-year-old Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of a defense contractor.
He has been CEO since November of 2015. He does not have a security clearance. He
is divorced, and has three adult children. (TR at page 5 lines 15~24, and at page 24 line
1 to page 26 line 5.) Applicant is a dual-national with Finland. (TR at page 16 lines 4~7,
and at page 23 lines 8~10.)
Guideline B - Foreign Influence
1.a.  Applicant  admits  that  his  sister  is  a  citizen  and  resident  of  Finland.  She  is
retired  from  working  with  an  “oil  company.”  He  communicates  with  her  through  social
media  on a  weekly basis, and  physically speaks to  her “maybe four times a  year.” (TR
at page 34 line 6 to page 38 line 15.)
1.b.  Applicant  admits that his one  brother is a  citizen  and  resident  of  Finland.  “He
is employed  . . . [by] a  Swedish industrial manufacturer.”   His communications with  this
brother are  similar to that with his sister, noted above. (TR at page 38 line 16 to page 41
line 21.)
1.c. Applicant admits that his other brother is a citizen of Finland, but is a resident
of France. He “runs a business with a business partner.” This second brother’s business
is  “in  industrial  equipment  used  by  the  pharmaceutical  industry.”  Applicant  has  little
contact with this brother, “maybe once in two years.” (TR at page 41 line 23 to page 45
line 17.)
1.d.  and   1.i.  Applicant   admits  that  he   has  a   very   close   female  friend   who   is  a
citizen  of  Finland,  but  who  resides with  Applicant  much  of the  time  in the  United  States.
“She’s a  correspondent  for a  Finnish  newspaper.”  They  are  romantically  involved,  and
they also co-own an apartment in Finland valued at about $357,000. (TR at page 45 line
18 to page 52 line 15, at page 63 line 3 to page 64 line 12, and at page 68 line 24 to
page 70 line 15.)
1.e. Applicant has been an Honorary Counsel for Finland from about January of
2019 to the present. “It’s completely pro bono. . . . no budget, no money, no payment.”
He  dedicates  “two  or  three  hours  per  month,”  to  this  honorary  service  to  the  Finnish
government. (TR at page 53 line 9 to page 55 line 2.)
1.f.  Applicant  denies  that  he   maintains  a   Finnish  bank  account  with   a   value   of
over $800,000. He avers that it’s value varies between $10,000~$50,000.  (TR at page
55 line 3 to page 56 line 17.)
1.g.  Applicant  denies  that   he   maintains  bank  accounts  and   business  interests,
with  his three  children,  in Finland  valued  at nearly  $2,000,000.  He avers that the  bank
accounts are  about  $30,000,  and  the  business investment  about  $700,000.  (TR at page
58 line 11  to  page 62 line 6.)
1.h.   and   1.k.  Applicant  denies  that   he   maintains   joint   bank   accounts   with   an
individual and  with  two  businesses  in  Finland,  in the  Netherlands, and  in  England. He  is,
in  fact,   CEO  and   co-owner  of  a   U.S.   business   worth   between   $6,000,000   and
$20,000,000. (TR at page  13  line  8  to  page  21  line  25, at page  26  line  14  to  page  29
line 10, at page  64 lines 16~24, at page  70 line 16 to  page 71 line 12,  and AppX A.)
1.j.  Applicant   admits   that   he   co-owns  investments   in  Finland   valued   at   about
$2,750.  This amount is diminutive in light of Applicant’s other foreign assets.
Guideline C - Foreign Preference
2.a.   As   a   dual-national,  Applicant  voted   in   the   Finnish   Presidential  election   in
about January of  2018. (TR at page  79 line 13 to page 82 line  6.)

his retirement. (TR at page 82 line 7  to  page 84 line  1.)
Notice
I  take  administrative  notice  of  the  following  facts  about  Finland:  The  United
States  established  diplomatic  relations  with  Finland  in  1919,  following  its  1917
declaration  of  independence from  the  Russian  Empire.  The  United  States and  Finland
have  enjoyed  decades  of  close  and  cordial  relations.  Finland  and  the  United  States
belong to a number of the same international organizations. Finland has most recently
applied for admission into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).

"In  his  Answer,  Applicant  admitted  SOR  allegations  ¶¶  1.c,  3.a-d,  and  3.f-h.  He
denied allegations ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 2.a, and 3.e. His admissions are incorporated into the
findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  evidence
submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 46 years old. He served in the Army National Guard from 1994-2000,
and received an honorable discharge. He has taken some college courses, but has not
earned  a degree. He has held a security clearance since 2001, and his  last clearance
application was granted in 2011. He was married in 2005 and divorced in 2015. He has
worked in IT for a large defense contractor since 2014. (Item 3)
After  Applicants  divorce,  he  pursued  relationships  with  women  he  met  through
online dating sites. Some of these women were foreign nationals living in other countries.
He  would  communicate  with  these  women  through  email  and  video  calls.  There  were
occasions where he would use his work email address to correspond with them. He did
not report his contacts with foreign women through the appropriate security channels at
work. (Item 3, 4, 5, 6)
Although Applicant attempted to meet these women in person, there is no evidence
in the record that he was successful. In his most substantial online dating relationship,
the woman repeatedly withdrew right before the meetings were scheduled to take place.
In  a  four-month  period  in  2016,  he  submitted  about  twelve  vacation  notices,  which  he
canceled shortly before or after the start of his scheduled leave. This unusual behavior
was  noticed  at  work.  He  also  shared  details  of  these  relationships  with  co-workers,
including that he had met a Russian woman online. They notified security personnel out
of concern for Applicant, and because of the potential security risk posed by his online
activities. (Item 4, 5, 6)
After receiving reports about Applicant’s contact with foreign women, his employer
launched  an  investigation.  It  found  that  he  failed  to  report  his  contact  with  foreign
nationals, and that he was deliberately deceptive with investigators. Co-workers reported
that he told them that he was talking to two Russian women, a women from Colombia,
and  a  woman  from  Costa  Rica.  Security  personnel  were  concerned  that  he  may  be
divulging too much information to these women, and that he may be targeted. They did
an  analysis  of  his  work  computer,  and  found  that  he  used  his  work  email  account  to
correspond with two women, one who was a Russian national, the other was located in
South  Africa.  Although  he  claimed  that  the  Russian  woman  was  like  a  pen  pal,  the
investigation found correspondence stating that Applicant wanted  her to come live with
him, and discussed the potential of marriage. They also found blank immigration forms
on his computer. (Item 3, 4, 5, 6)
Applicant asserted that the woman in South Africa was a U.S. citizen because she
showed him her passport on a video call. He claimed that she was a fashion designer
from Beverly Hills, who resided in South Africa for work. He claimed that she was unable
to return to the U.S. because of passport and visa issues. In 2016, he took out personal
loans to send her money for living expenses and to support her clothing design business.
He sent her money orders about 8-10 times, for a total amount sent between $10,000 to
$20,000. He later learned that she had been deceiving him, and claims to have ended
the relationship in 2016. (Item 4, 6)
In 2016, Applicant told security officials that he would stop all communications if
he  discovered  the  women  he  met  online  were  foreign  nationals.  However,  the  record
shows  that  he  continued  to  contact  foreign  women  until  at  least  2018.  After  the
investigation concluded in June 2016, he was suspended for two days without pay. He
was fired in 2018 for mischarging time. (Item 3, 4, 5, 6)
In his 2019 background interview with a government investigator, Applicant did not
report that he was fired from his job. He told the investigator that he resigned so that he
could take another job, and left on good terms. After the interview concluded, he sent an
email later that day to the investigator and admitted that he had not been truthful about
leaving his employment, and informed them that he had been terminated because of a
time charging audit. (Item 4)
Applicant  has  about  $72,000  in  charged-off  debt.  He  stated  that  his  financial
problems started in late 2015, after meeting a woman online. The record shows that he
is referring to the woman in South Africa. He reported that he took out personal loans to
send her money for living expenses and materials to design clothes. He asserted that she
was supposed to pay him back, but did not. (Answer; Item 4)
Applicant stated that he made mistakes that were neither in his best interest, nor
that of  his employer or  the  government.  He asserted that  it  was  not  his intent  to meet
foreign women online, and it was not his intent to use his email for personal use outside
of  work.  He  claimed  that  he  did  not  receive  training  from  his  employer  about  meeting
foreign nationals on dating websites, and that he had no experience with foreign nationals
prior to this time. He asserted that he did not discuss classified information with anyone
outside of his job. He claimed that when he was terminated in 2018, he was told that it
was an internal incident and could not be reported to the government. He stated that since
the investigator did not  discuss his termination  in his background interview,  he  did not
mention it first. He claims that he had no intent to deceive the government. He stated that
for 27 years he has been in either the military or working as a contractor supporting the
military, and he will do whatever it takes to continue to serve in this role. He reports that
he has been married since November 2020, and has learned from his past indiscretions
(Answer; Response)
The SOR allegations are as follows:
SOR ¶  1.a: Applicant was the subject of an investigation by his employer in 2016,
which confirmed that he used his work email address to correspond with foreign nationals
that he encountered on dating websites, including two women who identified themselves
as Russian nationals. He denied the allegation. In his Answer, he stated that the allegation
is not entirely accurate. He admitted his lack of judgment using his work email address,
and  claimed  that  he  was  having  trouble  using  his  personal  email  address  to  send  the
messages. He claimed that he did not continue to correspond with either of the Russian
women, because they did not reply to him. (Item 4, 5, 6)
SOR  ¶   1.b:   Applicant  took  out  eight  personal  loans  (listed  in  ¶¶  3.a-h)  to  send
money  to  a  woman  that  he  met  on  a  dating  website,  who  resided  in  South  Africa.  He
denied the allegation. In his Answer, he claimed that the woman was a U.S. citizen who
was living in California when they met. He claimed that although she did some work in
South Africa, her permanent address was in California. He admitted taking out personal
loans to assist her clothing design business. He claimed that some of the money from the
loans was wired to her, and the rest he used for his personal expenses. He reported that
they dated in 2016, but he terminated the relationship after finding out she was a liar and
dishonest about her business practices. He claimed that he is working on paying his debt.
(Item 4, 6)
SOR ¶  1.c: Applicant was fired from his job in about 2018 for time mischarging. He
admitted the allegation. (Item 4)
SOR  ¶   1.d:  Applicant  falsified  material  facts  in  his  January  2019  background
interview with a government investigator by stating that he resigned his job on good terms
to accept another offer, and deliberately sought to conceal that he was fired in 2018 for
time mischarging. He denied the allegation. In his Answer, he claimed that it was not his
intent  to  conceal  his  termination.  He  thought  that  the  government  would  have  already
known about his termination, since it occurred five months prior. He claimed that he was
embarrassed and ashamed, but he should have been truthful. He claims that he wrote a
letter of amendment immediately afterwards and sent it to the investigator, to inform them
of his misinformation. (Item 4)
SOR  ¶  2.a  cross-alleged  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b  as  a  foreign  influence  security
concern. He denied the allegation. In his Answer, he stated that he was not aware of the
reporting policies regarding online dating and reporting foreign contacts. He claimed that
he had no experience with foreign nationals prior to this time. (Item 4, 6)
SOR ¶ 3.a is a charged-off account for $10,352. He admitted the allegation, and
claimed that he is working with the creditor to pay the debt. He did not provide sufficient
evidence to support his claim. (Item 4, 7, 8, 9)
SOR ¶ 3.b is a charged-off  account for $8,033.  He admitted the allegation, and
claimed that he is working with the creditor to pay the debt. He did not provide sufficient
evidence to support his claim. (Item 4, 7, 8, 9)
SOR ¶ 3.c is a charged-off account for $11,823. He admitted the allegation, and

evidence to support his claim. (Item 4, 7, 8, 9)
SOR  ¶ 3.e is a  charged-off  account for $4,465.  He denied the allegation.  In his
Answer, he claimed that this debt was satisfied on February 25, 2021. He submitted an
account statement with his Answer, dated March 6, 2021, which showed that this account
had a zero balance. (Item 4, 7, 8, 9)
SOR  ¶  3.f  is  a  charged-off  account  for  $6,633.  He  admitted  the  allegation,  and
claimed that he is working with the creditor to pay the debt. He did not provide sufficient

"Applicant  is  a  43-year-old  employee  of  a  federal  contractor.  He  is  an  American
citizen by birth and comes from a long-line of American citizens. He noted his parents are
proud Americans that taught him about the privileges of being an American citizen, and
the importance of the rights that we enjoy as American citizens. (Tr. 30) He grew up and
was educated in the United States, graduating from college with a double major in 2001.
After  college,  he  held  a  couple  of  jobs  that  allowed  him  to  display  his
professionalism, skills, and knowledge. A federal contractor hired Applicant in 2007, and
he held a position of trust for 10 years. (Tr. 34) A large federal contractor hired him in
2017, and it is currently sponsoring his security clearance. His current income is $165,000
a year.
The SOR  alleges  that Applicant’s  cohabitant  is a  dual  citizen  of  Russia  and  the
United States who previously held a government job in Russia (SOR ¶ 1.a) and that his
in-laws (father, mother, and sister) are citizens and residents of Russia. (SOR ¶¶ 2.b, 2.c,
and 2.d). He admitted all of the foreign influence allegations with explanations.
Applicant met his  cohabitant  and  domestic partner  (DP)  in  2011. She  was born  in
Russia  to  Russian  parents  in 1984.  She  grew up  and  was educated  in  Russia,  graduating
from  college  in 2005. (Tr. 126) She  met her first husband, an  American  working  with  a
U.S. agency  in Moscow, in 2004. They  married,  and  she became pregnant.  She entered
the  United  States in 2008  while  pregnant  so  that her  daughter could  be  born  in the  United
States. She  received  her green  card in 2009, and  became  a  naturalized  U.S. citizen  in
2011. (Tr. 79) Her ex-husband filed for divorce in 2011,  which was finalized  in 2016.  (Tr.
131)
Applicant and his DP started a romantic relationship in January 2012. Since then,
he  has  been  providing  financial  support for her and  her child.  Applicant  and  his father
visited  Russia  in  June  2012,  where  they  met  and  stayed  with  her  Russian  immediate
family during their two-week visit. He has traveled with her to Russia almost every year,
including  2013,  2015,  2016,  2017,  and  2019.  They  stayed  with  her  family  for  about  a
month on each visit. The purpose of their visits is for his DP to visit with her family and
friends. (Tr. 71)
Applicant  and  his  DP  are  friends  with  a  couple  from  Kazakhstan  who  were
assigned to  Kazakhstan’s embassy in the United States. During their visit to Russia in
2016, they travelled to Kazakhstan to visit with their friends who were in their country at
the  time.  She  maintains  contact  with  her  friends  from  Kazakhstan  via  messaging
applications. Her friends are currently assigned to the Kazakhstan embassy in England.
(Tr. 119)
Applicant purchased an apartment in 2014 and they moved in together in October
2014. In 2016, they entered into a domestic partnership because he wanted to provide
medical insurance to his DP and her daughter. She receives child support from her ex-
husband, performs some modeling work, and is developing a small business from their
home.  Applicant  noted  that  she  is  very  independent  and  takes  pride  in  being  able  to
provide for herself. He feels that they are in a committed relationship. They have children
together, and he intends to continue their relationship like a husband and wife. (Tr. 82)
Applicant and  his DP have  three  children, ages 14, 7, and  6; all  of  them  were born
in  the   United   States.  The   oldest  is  Applicant’s  stepdaughter  who   was  born  of   a   prior
marriage  of  his DP with  an  American. He  and  his DP have  no  interest  in their  children
having   dual citizenship   with   Russia  or having   a   Russian   passport.   She   is teaching   the
children  to  speak Russian, and they  travel to Russia with  Applicant and his DP. She  has
tutors for her children  to help them learn the  Russian language. (Tr. 47, 118)
Applicant’s DP has three savings accounts and a checking account in a Russian
bank,  and  she  owns  some  shares  on  a  Russian  bank  that  she  purchased  as  an
investment in 2020. Some of these accounts the DP has held since she began working
in  Russia.  Others  she  opened  to  facilitate  her  transferring  money  to  her  family  when
needed or to pay expenses during their visits to Russia. She uses her bank accounts to
pay her children’s tutors in Russia.
Applicant and  his DP denied  having  any  financial or property  interest  in Russia. He
also  denied   providing   financial  assistance   to   his  DP’s  relatives  in   Russia,  other  than
buying  food  and  giving  small  presents during  their  visits.  (Tr. 43) He  considers the  current
political  regime   in   Russia  to   be   extremely   disturbing   and   disappointing.  (Tr.  44)   He
believes he  was  naive  about Russia  when  he  first started  visiting.  He  was  not aware of
the   levels of   violence, intimidation,   and  the   lack  of  protection   of human   rights  that any
person, and  especially the  citizens, have  to  endure.  He  believes Russia  is an extremely
corrupt  country, almost  like  a  large  organized  crime  organization  where even  the  judicial
system is corrupt. (Tr. 44)
Applicant noted that his DP was the first person that brought to his attention that
journalists  are  routinely threatened, beaten, and murdered  in  Russia,  and  that  citizens
cannot count on having any rights. He agrees with the evidence admitted at his hearing
identifying  Russia  as  a  hostile  country.  Russian  people  who  express  dissent  to  be
threatened,  beaten,  jailed  and  murdered.  Russia  is  engaging  in  an  aggressive  war  in
Ukraine in which many civilians have died. (Tr. 46, 53, 143)
The DP possesses a U.S. passport and a valid Russian passport. She exclusively
uses  her  Russian  passport  to  travel  to  Russia.  She  has  considered  renouncing  her
Russian citizenship, but she is concerned the Russian government may interfere with her
ability to travel to Russia. Visiting her Russian family is very important to her, and she
does not want to risk her ability to do so. She is concerned about having to request visas
and not being assured of her right to travel and to be with her family. Her grandmother is
92 years old, and her parents are aging. The DP has a very close-knit, loving, and caring
relationship  with  her  Russian  family.  (Tr. 72)  The  DP  speaks  with  her  mother  and  her
sister  daily  through  the  telephone  or  messaging  applications,  and  she  has  a  close
relationship with her father. They speak or communicate with each other at least once a
week.  (Tr.  73)  She  asked  her  family  to  immigrate  to  the  United  States,  but  his
grandmother  is  too  old  and  her  parents  are  not  interested  in  leaving  their  relatives  in
Russia. Russia refuses to honor United States citizenship for any Russian citizens. (Tr.
48, 137)
The  Russia  government  paid  for  the  DP’s  education.  She  graduated  with  a
business  administration  degree.  Applicant  believes  that  she  has  never  worked  in  any
capacity for the Russian Federation or the Russian government. She worked for a Middle
Eastern country embassy in Moscow in 2005 in an administrative position. From October
2005 to June of 2009, she worked for foreign industry business developing firm in Moscow
as a secretary to the assistant to the head of the representative of that office. (Tr. 75 - 77)
The  DP  is  afraid  to  travel  to  Russia.  She  testified  she  has  been  quite  vocal  on
social media against the Russian government and against the war in Ukraine. She also
protested in the United States in front of a Russian embassy when an opposition leader
was imprisoned. (Tr. 158 – 159) She is worried that she will be arrested when she travels
to Russia again. She currently does not feel safe about travelling to Russia. (Tr. 137) She
testified that for the last 16 years, she has been decrying the political situation in Russia,
the  numerous  human  rights  violations,  the  imprisonments  and  assassinations  of
journalists,  opposition  leaders,  and  political  activists.  She  does  not  see  herself  ever
wanting to or agreeing to cooperate with or assist the Russian government in any way for
any reason, including possible pressure on my family members. (Tr. 148 - 149)
The  DP’s parents are citizen  and  residents of Russia.  Her mother graduated from
a  Russian  university  in  1986. (Tr. 87)  Between  1986  and  1987, she  worked  for an   all-
Russian   scientific   research   institute   of   Ukraine   lands.   (Tr.   87)   She   receives  a  Russian
government pension  of  8,755.00  rubles a  year (about $250  a  month),  that started  in 2012.
(Tr.  90, 165)  She  frequently  visited  the  United  States  to  help the  DP  with  her first child.
Both  of  her parents  understand  English  well,  and  her mother  can  speak it  at the  same
level   that  Applicant  can   speak  Russian.  He  met  his  mother-in-law   in  2012   when   she
visited  his  DP in the  US.  She  visited  for six  months between  August 2014  and  February
2015,  and  stayed  with  her boyfriend  in another state.  (Tr. 170)  She  also visited  Applicant
and  his family  from  March 2015  to  June  2015, from  September 2015  to  March 2016, in
2017  for about  three  months, and in 2019  for about five months  (Tr.  96  - 99)
Applicant’s father-in-law served  in the  Soviet  army from 1979 to 1981, and was
transferred  to  the  reserve.  He  was  a  graphics  designer  working  for a  newspaper,  and
began collecting his retired pension of about 17,000 rubles (about $6,000) in 2016. (Tr.
101 – 103)
The  DP’s sister works in sales  in an office supply and furniture store in Russia.
She is married and has a child. Her husband works in a book-printing factory in Russia.
(Tr. 106, 182) The DP and her sister have a very close relationship; they have contact
with each other every day or at least every other day.
Applicant’s  references  attest  to  his  work  ethic,  integrity,  honesty,  ability  to  work
under pressure, and his leadership. His evaluation reports corroborate these personality
traits  and  attributes.  His  employer  and  references  praised  his  performance,  diligence,
trustworthiness,  professionalism,  and  contributions  to  mission  accomplishment.  They
identify him as a valuable and productive employee. (AE O – S)

"Applicant  is  59   years  old   and   was  born  in  South   Korea.  He  was  adopted   by
relatives in the  United  States  when  he  was four years old and  became  a  naturalized  U.S.
citizen  at age  eight.  His adoptive  father was a  member  of the  U.S. Army,  and  Applicant
moved  with  his family  to  various locations around the  world. He received  his high  school
diploma  in  1981  at  an  American  high  school  in Germany.  Applicant  enlisted  in  the  U.S.
Army  in 1984  at  the  age  of 21. He  honorably  retired  in  2006  with  the  rank of sergeant first

Applicant married in 1984, but that marriage ended in divorce in 2007. Later the
same year he married his current wife. Both wives were born in South Korea. His first wife
became a naturalized U.S. citizen. Applicant and his first wife had one child, who is now
27 years old. His second wife is a citizen of South Korea. Applicant asserts that his wife
is in the process of obtaining resident alien status in the U.S., though as of the hearing
date, she has not completed the process. Applicant has two children with his second wife,
ages 12 and 14. All three of his children were born in South Korea and are U.S. citizens.
His two youngest children are also South Korean citizens by operation of South Korean
law. They reside with their parents  in South Korea, and they attend DOD schools. His
oldest child received a college degree in the United States and presently lives and works
in the U.S. Applicant intends on having his two youngest children attend college in the
United States, specifically in the State of Texas. He and his wife plan to retire in Texas
as  well.  He  is also  considering  moving  to  Texas  earlier  and  working  at  his  current  job
remotely from Texas. (Answer at 3; Tr. at 17-23, 43-44; GE 1 at 1-2, 17-20, 21-25, 43;

Applicant  first  received  a  Secret  security  clearance  in 1984  in connection  with  his
military   service.   His  most  recent   reinvestigation   was   in   2011.  He   has  worked   in   South
Korea  for  two  U.S.  defense  contractors  since  his discharge  from  the  Army   (2006-2017
and  2017  to  present). He is currently  working  as a  manager.  He  seeks to  receive  eligibility
for a  Top  Secret security  clearance  in connection  with  his employment.  He has resided  in
South Korea since at least 2006. (Tr. at 29-31; GE  1  at 12-13; GE 2 at 10-11; GE 3 at 8-
9.)
Paragraph 1  (Guideline B,  Foreign Influence)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because he has foreign connections that may create a security concern. The SOR alleges
in three subparagraphs that Applicant’s wife and her parents are citizens and residents
of South Korea. In his Answer Applicant admitted these factual allegations, denied that
the facts raise security concerns, and provided detailed explanations.
Applicant’s wife was born in South Korea in 1975. Her father and mother were born
in South Korea in 1945. Her father served  in the South Korean Army for 25 years and
retired  with  the  rank  of  lieutenant  colonel.  He  then  worked  for  the  Korean  Institute  for
Defense  Analysis,  or  KIDA,  for  about  ten  years  until  his  retirement  in  2006.  Applicant
described the KIDA as a think tank for the South Korean Army. Applicant’s father-in-law
is presently 77  years old.  His mother-in-law  is a  retired  nurse.  For a  period  during the
Vietnam War, she  served  as  a  nurse  in  the  South  Korean  Army  and  was  deployed  to
Vietnam. She later worked as a nurse in a civilian hospital in South Korea. Applicant has
regular contact with  his wife’s parents  over the phone, and his family visits his in-laws
every couple of months and during Korean holidays. His parents-in-law live about three
hours from Applicant’s residence in South Korea. (Answer at 6; Tr. at 23-29, 58-59; GE 3
at 11.)
Applicant owns no property in South Korea and has no expectation that his wife
will inherit anything from her parents. Applicant’s sole  sources of income are his salary
from his U.S. DOD contractor, his U.S. military retirement payments, and his Veteran’s
Administration  disability  benefits.  He  is  financially  secure.  His  parents-in-law  are
financially independent. He provides no financial support to them. (Tr. at 27-32.)
South Korea
Applicant has contacts with South Korea. Accordingly, it is appropriate to look at
the current conditions in that country. South Korea is a constitutional democracy; whose
authorities generally respect the human rights of its citizens. Human rights concerns exist,
particularly  in  the  areas  of  restrictions  of  freedom  of  expression  and  the  government’s
responses to violence against women. Civilian authorities maintain effective control over
the  country’s  security  forces,  and  the  government  utilizes  effective  mechanisms  to
investigate and punish any abuses of power. South Korea and companies in South Korea
are active collectors of U.S. industrial information and engage in industrial espionage, as
shown by the administrative notice documents in the record. However, the record does
not  demonstrate  that  the  South  Korean  government  seeks  to  exert  pressure  on  U.S.
citizens to collect sensitive information. Finally, a U.S. Government website describes the
close  and  continuing  relationship  between  the  U.S.  military  and  South  Korea  and  its
military. Large numbers of U.S. ground, air, sea, and special operations forces cooperate
jointly with the South Korean military under a common command to protect the security
of South Korea. (AN-I; www.usfk.mil.)
Paragraph 2 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations)
The SOR alleges that Applicant failed to file his Federal income tax returns for tax
years  (TY)  2017,  2018,  and  2019,  as  required.  In  his  Answer  Applicant  denies  the
allegations  though  he  admits  that  he  failed  to  request  extensions  of  time  to  file.  He
provided IRS tax account transcripts for the three years in dispute. The evidence reflects
that  Applicant  filed  his  TY  2017  tax  return  on  April  22,  2019,  over  one  year  late.  The
Government issued a refund of $4,200 to Applicant. In October 2020 the IRS prepared a
substitute  tax  return  due  to  Applicant’s  failure  to  file  his  TY  2018  return  on  time.  He
ultimately  filed  a  return  in  about  February  2021.  Applicant  had  a  negative  balance  of
$1,416 for this tax year, indicating that he owed no additional taxes. Applicant also filed
his TY 2019 tax return late. The account transcript reflects a filing date of June 2021. The
IRS issued a refund to Applicant for that tax year in the amount of $2,468. (AE A through
AE C.)
At the hearing Applicant blamed his untimely filing of his Federal tax returns on his
ignorance and neglect. He also said that he experienced difficulties receiving the requisite
paperwork from his employer after he changed employers in 2017 and with his wife’s tax
identification  number  (TIN),  which  had  expired.  The  renewal  of  her  TIN  required
documentation and he had difficulty communicating with the IRS. Also, his job change
required  that he  relocate  his family  within  South Korea,  and  he  had  to  withdraw funds
from his 401k account to finance the relocation. That withdrawal further complicated his
tax returns and delayed his preparation of the returns. Based upon his past experience
with his taxes, he knew that he did not owe the IRS any additional taxes, so he did not
believe a delay in filing would be a problem. He admitted that he was ignorant of the legal
requirements relating to the timely filing of tax returns. He had no intention not to file his
returns, and in fact, he did file his returns. (Tr. at 33-39, 62.)
In  late  Spring  2022,  Applicant  retained  counsel  in  connection  with  the  instant
security clearance proceeding. His counsel advised him of the importance of timely filing
of  his  tax  returns,  especially  as  a  holder  of  a  security  clearance.  Applicant  now  fully
appreciates the importance of timely filing his tax returns. He intends to file his future tax
returns as required by law. As of the close of the record, Applicant had filed all the required
Federal income tax returns and did not owe any Federal taxes. (Tr. at 49-57, 59-60.)

"Applicant  admitted  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.e.  He  denied  the
allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.b  through  1.d,  1.f  through  1.i,  and  2.a.  After  a  thorough  and
careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of
fact.
Applicant is 52 years old. He is a high school graduate and earned some college
credits, but not a degree. He served in the military from January 1989 to March 1990 and
received an honorable discharge. Applicant married in Turkey in 2000. His wife is a dual
citizen of Turkey and the United States. They have two children, ages 21 and  19 years
old. (Item 2)
In his March 2021 security clearance application (SCA), Applicant did not disclose
any periods of unemployment. He worked for a federal contractor from 2009 to 2018. He
left his job for a new opportunity. He worked for a different federal contractor from January
2019  to  September  2019,  and  was  laid  off  when  his  department  was  eliminated.  He
worked  for  different  employers  from  September  2019,  including  a  period  of  self-
employment from March 2020 to June 2020, until his present employment in December
2020. (Item 2)
In Applicant’s SCA, he disclosed that he had not filed his 2018 federal income tax
return because his accountant was amending his return. He stated he owed $4,000, but
the amendment would show he did not owe a balance. He said he was working with his
accountant. He also disclosed in his SCA that he had not filed his 2019 federal tax return
and was working with his accountant to file that tax return. He stated, “We have currently
hired [CE] and they are in the process of submitting our 2019 tax return and also will be
amending  my  2018  tax  return.”  He  provided  no explanation for his failure to timely file
either return. (Item 2)
Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator in April 2021. He told the
investigator that he had been late filing his federal income tax returns for tax years 2018
and 2019. He said he contacted the IRS and had been granted extensions for both tax
years. He said he did not owe taxes for either year and would receive a refund. (Item 3)
In Applicant’s April 2022 answer to the SOR, he said, “all taxes are being filed to
date, currently 2020 and 2021 and are expected to be completed by our CPA by June 1,
2022.” (Item 1) He said he had requested extensions at the appropriate time, and he was
waiting for his accountant to complete his paperwork to file the tax returns. He said he did
not owe taxes. He said  his accountant informed him  that there was a backlog of  2020
filings and his tax returns would be completed by June 1, 2022. He said he was told his
2020 tax returns would be filed by then and his 2021 return would follow shortly thereafter.
He  believed  he  would  receive  a  refund.  He  said  he  would  continue  to  work  with  his
accountant to ensure timely filing. (Item 1)
In the FORM, Applicant was put on notice as to what documents were required to
substantiate his claims about his tax returns. In  Applicant’s response  to  the  FORM,  he
did not say anything about his delinquent tax returns. Applicant did not provide a copy of
his 2018 federal tax return that he said was being amended,  which  presumably  would
have been filed if he was requesting it be amended. He did not provide documentation to
show he  had  timely filed  for extensions for tax  years  2018,  2019, or  2020.  He  did  not
provide copies of filed tax returns for 2018, 2019, and 2020, or any documentation from
his accountant. He did not provide an explanation for his failure to timely file for the three
tax years. (AE A)
The   SOR  alleges  eight   delinquent  debts  (SOR   ¶¶  1.b   through   1.i).  They   are
corroborated   by   Applicant’s  admissions   in  his  SCA,   statements  to   the   government
investigator,  and   a   March  2021   credit  bureau   report.  Applicant  provided   proof  that  the
collection   account  in  SOR  ¶  1.b   ($2,424)  was  settled   for  $1,940   in  February   2022.
Applicant  provided   a   copy   of  the   page   from   his  credit  report  showing   this  debt.   The
complete credit report was not provided. (AE  B, C)
In  Applicant’s  SCA,  he  disclosed  the  debts  alleged  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.e  ($4,735),  1.f
($7,389),  1.g  ($4,431), 1.h  ($3,654), and  1.i  ($3,532).  He  stated  they  were  credit  card
debts that he fell behind on paying. The same collection company holds the debts in SOR
¶¶ 1.g, 1.h and 1.f. He said he contacted the collection company and it was unwilling to
accept a reduced payment. He was going to contact an attorney to assist him.  He also
disclosed the debt in SOR ¶ 1.e ($4,735) and said it was a credit card debt now owned
by a collection company. He had contacted the company to settle the debt. He said the
debt owed in SOR ¶ 1.i ($3,532), also a credit card debt held by a collection company,
was  not  owed  to  the  creditor  and  would  be  dismissed  in  court.  No  documentation
regarding any of the debts was provided. (Item 2)
In his April 2021 background interview, Applicant explained that he incurred credit
card debts for moving expenses in 2015, when he moved to a different state and his wife
was not working. He acknowledged to the investigator that he owed the debts in SOR ¶¶
1.f, 1.g and 1.h and they were not being paid. He stated  that in 2019, he purchased a
boat for $35,000 and as he was driving it to his residence the engine failed. He sold the
boat later in 2019 for $13,000. He also stated that during this time he was building a new
home. He told the investigator that he would not pay certain debts owed to the collection
company as alleged in SOR until they accepted his offer to pay a lesser amount.
Applicant stated in his SOR answer that he paid the debts in SOR ¶¶1.c ($65), 1.d
($319),  1.f,  1.g,  1.h  and  1.i,  and  they  were  removed  from  his credit  report.  He  did  not
provide documents to show he paid these debts and they were removed from his credit
report.  Regarding  the  debt  in  SOR  ¶  1.e,  he  stated  that  he  had  reached  a  payment
arrangement with the creditor and the debt would be resolved by May 2022. He did not
provide proof the debt was paid. (Item 1)
Applicant  disclosed  in  his  SCA  that  he  and  his  family  took  cruises  in  2017  and
2018.  He  stated,  “We  may  have  outstanding  debt  but  I  have  more  than  $300,000  in
investments waiting for them to mature and previous debt to be settled.” Applicant did not
elaborate on his investments. (Item 1)
Applicant  stated  in his SOR answer “All  noted  previous collections will  be  paid and
satisfied  by  May  2022.  (Item  1)  He  further stated,  “All  taxes are being  filed  to  date  and
currently  2020  and  2021  are expected  to  be  completed  by  our CPA  by  June  1st ,  2022.”
(Item 1)  He stated  he had put measures  such  as budgeting, investing  and  savings plans
in place  to  prevent any  future problems. He had  investments that provided  a  significant
cushion. He  stated,  “Regardless money  is no  longer a  concern considering  the  available
funds  to  date  and  [incoming] capital from  the  sale  of our house  that will provide  $160K
over what is owed  on  the  mortgage.”  No substantiating  documents were provided. (Item
1)
Applicant stated in his response to the FORM, “During 2019 and into 2020, we had
some unexpected expenses and life events, while the debts added up to an unsustainable
amount.” He further stated that he had always planned  to pay his debts sooner, but he
had extra expenses for his daughter who was attending college and his move. He said
the pandemic also affected him. He said he was investing and saving money.
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant’s  mother-in-law  is  a  dual  citizen  of  the  United
States and Turkey and resides in Turkey. Applicant stated in his SOR answer that his
mother-in-law is a permanent resident of the United States and holds a green card. She

Applicant was born in India to Indian parents.  She married her husband in India
in 2003. He was an Indian citizen living in the United States as a permanent resident at
the  time.  She  came  to  the  United  States  in  2003  after  they  married.  She  and  her
husband became U.S. citizens in 2018. India does not permit dual citizenship, and they
renounced their Indian citizenships when they became U.S. citizens. Their children were
born in the United States. (Tr. at 14-15, 22, 30; GE 1; AE B)

"Applicant  admitted  each  of  the  allegations  in  the  SOR.  After  a  thorough  and
careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of
fact.
Applicant is 58 years old, married, and has two adult children.  He has a Master’s
in  Business  Administration.  He  holds  the  position  of  Senior  Chief  Engineer  with  a
defense  contractor.  He  is  applying  for  a  security  clearance  in  connection  with  this
employment.
Applicant was born in Calcutta, India in 1964.  He came to the United States in
1982,  and  became  a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen  in  2013.  He  married  a  woman  from
Vietnam, and she is a naturalized U.S. citizen.  They have two children who were born
in  the  U.S.  Applicant  began  working  for  his  current  employer  in  1987,  and  has  been
with the company for the past thirty-five years.  He has never held a security clearance.
1.a.  Applicant owns a portfolio of investments in India that he estimates to be valued
at  approximately  2  million  dollars.  (Answer  to  SOR.)  Those  foreign  investments  are
discussed below:
1.b.   Applicant co-owns an apartment in Mumbai, India, with his brother and sister.  He
estimates  that  his  one-third  ownership  share  of  the  apartment  is  worth  approximately
$500,000.  Applicant explained that his father originally purchased the apartment for his
mother to live in.  Applicant’s mother has passed away.  In recent years, the apartment
was  used  to  house  his  aging  aunt  and  uncle  who  needed  care,  since  there  were  a
couple of staff there who could help care for them.  The house is not rented.  (Tr. p. 38.)
Applicant’s brother also uses the apartment when he visits India, as the business they
own also has an office in Mumbai.  (Tr. pp. 38-39.)
1.c.  Applicant  is  co-owner,  of  a  large  company  in  India  that  does  business  with  the
Government in India.  The business is a consulting engineering company that was once
owned  by  Applicant’s  father.  Applicant’s  father  passed,  and  Applicant  and  his  two
siblings inherited the business.  The company provides independent assessments and
guidance  to  owners  and  operators  of  steel  mills  in  India.  They  also  do  studies  for
entities  such  as  the  World  Bank  or  other  organizations  to  establish  feasibility  of  the
projects that they are considering.  This engineering company provides services related
to  various  engineering  civil  projects  with  an  expertise  in  the  ferrous  metals  industry.
There are also some projects in aluminum plants and other things due to the skill sets of
the  engineers.  This  business  does  work  with  the  Indian  Government  since  the  steel
plants are owned by the  Government.  (Tr. p. 33.)  The  company is comprised of 800
employees.  The  total  revenue  of  the  company  last  year  was  11.8  million  dollars.
(Applicant’s Post-Hearing Exhibit C.)
Applicant’s brother is the Chief Executive Officer who operates and manages the
company.  He  is  domiciled  in  New  York,  and  is  a  permanent  resident  of  the  U.S.
Applicant is a Director of the company.  He is involved in the company Board meetings
about three times a year, and handles other miscellaneous matters.
Applicant  also  maintains  about  six  foreign  bank  accounts  in  India,  valued  at  a
total  of  $247,000.  (Applicant’s  Post-Hearing  Exhibit  A.)  Applicant  has  implied  that
there was more money than this at some point as some of the money was repatriated to
the  U.S.,  and  is  part  of  the  holdings  he  has  in  the  U.S.  Applicant  holds  a  significant
amount of stock in this company, namely 13,334 of a total 80,000 shares issued, which
is  about  16.7  percent  of  the  stock.  The  monetary  amount  of  this  stock  is  unknown.
(Applicant’s Post-Hearing Exhibit B.)
Applicant  has  about  24  million  dollars  in  assets  in  the  U.S.,  that  include  an
investment account, two real properties, he and his wife’s retirement savings accounts
and his life insurance policy.  (Applicant’s Post-Hearing Exhibit D.)
I have taken administrative notice of the information set forth in the Government’s
briefs  and  supportive documents  on  the  country  of  India.  (HE1.) India  is  a multiparty,
federal, parliamentary democracy with a bicameral legislature.  The U.S. Department of
State has issued a Level 2 travel advisory for India, advising U.S. nationals to exercise
increased  caution  due  to  crime  and  terrorism.  Indian  authorities  report  rape  is  one  of
the fastest growing crimes in India.  Violent crime, such as sexual assault, has occurred
at  tourist  sites  and  in  other  locations.  Terrorists  may  attack  with  little  or  no  warning,
targeting
transportation  hubs,  markets/shopping  malls,  and
government facilities.  India continues to experienced terrorists and insurgent activities
which  may  affect  U.S.  citizens  directly  or  indirectly.  Anti-Western  terrorists  groups,
locations,
tourist
some on the U.S. government’s list of foreign terrorist organizations, are active in Indian
including Islamist extremist groups.  Past attacks have targeted public places, including
some frequented by Westerners, such as luxury and other hotels, trains, train stations,
markets,  cinemas,  mosques,  and  restaurants  in  large  urban  areas.  There  are
significant  human  rights  issues  in  India  including  unlawful  and  arbitrary  killings,
extrajudicial  killings  by  the  government  or  its  agents;  torture  and  cases  of  cruel,
inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment by police and prison officials; harsh and
life-threatening  prison  conditions;  arbitrary  arrest  and  detention  by  government
authorities;  political  prisoners,  or  detainees;  arbitrary  or  unlawful  interference  with
privacy;  restrictions  on  free  expression  and  media,  including  violence,  threats  of
violence  or  unjustified  arrests  or  prosecution  against  journalists;  use  of  criminal  libel
laws  to  prosecute  social  media  speech;  restrictions  on  internet  freedom;  overly
restrictive
funding,  or  operations  of  nongovernment
organizations  and  civil  society  organizations;  serious  government  corruption;
government harassment of domestic and international human rights organizations; lack
of  investigation  of  and  accountability  for  gender-based  violence;  crimes  involving
violence  and  discrimination  targeting  members  of  minority  groups  based  on  religious
affiliation,  social  status  or  sexual  orientation  or  gender  identity;  and  forced  and

"Applicant  is  34  years  old.  He  has  a  high  school  diploma  and  he  has  attended
trade  school.  He  is  employed  with  a  defense  contractor  as  a  Structures  Aircraft
Mechanic.  He  is  seeking  to  obtain  a  security  clearance  in  connection  with  his
employment.
The Government alleges that Applicant’s foreign influence could pose a security
risk;  he  has  engaged  in  illegal  substance  abuse;  that  he  is  excessively  indebted;  and
that  he  falsified  his  security  clearance  application.  Applicant  admits  each  of  the
allegations  set  forth  in  the  SOR.  Applicant  began  working  for  his  current  employer  in
December 2019.
Guideline B- Foreign Influence
Applicant’s spouse  is a  citizen  of Mexico.  She  crossed the border and came to
the  United  States  illegally.  Applicant  met  her  at  a  previous  job,  where  they  worked
together.  They dated for several years, and were married in 2009, in Las Vegas.  After
they were married, Applicant hired an attorney to assist them with immigration services.
Applicant’s  wife’s  immigration  application  was  initially  denied.  Applicant  believes  that
she was denied because the paperwork indicated that she crossed the border with her
two  children  in  hand,  subjecting  them  to  danger.  Applicant  explained  that  her  two
children  crossed  the border,  in  an  earlier date,  and  they  did  not  come  with  her.  They
came before she did.  Applicant stated that he is still in the process of getting his wife
legal  status  in  the  U.S.  He  stated  that  his  wife  currently  has  a  work  permit  that  was
granted about six months ago.  He did not provide a copy of her work permit.  She has a
son and a daughter from a previous relationship, and two children with the Applicant.
Guideline H  –  Drug  Involvement  and Substance Misuse
Applicant  used  the  prescription  drug  Norco,  without  a  prescription,  off  and  on
from  about  2007/2008  to  at  least  August  2019.  He  explained  that  in  2007/2008,  his
father  was  in  an  accident  at  work,  and  Norco  was  prescribed  to  him.  At  some  point,
Applicant suffered back pain and complained to his father about it.  His father gave him
some Norco, and over time, Applicant became addicted to it.  Applicant would obtain the
drug from a  friend at work.  The  cost of the drug was $10 per pill.  At times  he  would
spend  $40  a  day  on  the  pills.  Applicant’s  wife  noticed  that  Applicant  was  spending
money not accounted for.  Applicant realized his addiction and in 2016/2017, he entered
an  out-patient  drug  rehabilitation  program.  The  program  lasted  one  year.  Applicant
completed  the program and  was able to  completely abstain  from drug use  for about 2
and a  half  years.  In 2020, Applicant relapsed  and  started using  Norco  again.  At that
time, Applicant was working for his current employer and he used Norco for about a six-
month period.  (Tr. p. 52.)  Applicant believes that the loss of his brother in 1999, that he
never really addressed, and the stress he experienced at home, caused him to relapse.
In 2020, Applicant then entered a second treatment center for his Norco addiction.  This
time,  Applicant’s  drug  rehabilitation  was  a  ten-day  in-patient  treatment  program.  He
completed the program and has been drug free for the past two and a half years.
Applicant  was  terminated  from  his  previous  employment  for  hitting  an  airplane.
Applicant underwent a drug test that was positive for Norco, and he admits that he was
under the influence of Norco at the time of the accident.  Applicant does not believe he
disclosed this information to his current employer.
Guideline  F –  Financial Considerations
Applicant  is  indebted  to  five  creditors  listed  in  the  SOR,  totaling  $24,489.  He
admits  each  of  the  allegations  set  forth  in  the  SOR  under  this  guideline.  Applicant’s
credit  reports  dated  May  24,  2019;  March  23,  2020;  and  August  5,  2022,  confirm  this
indebtedness.  (Government Exhibits 4, 5 and 6.)  The following delinquent debts are of
security concern:
1.    A   debt  is  owed   to   a   bank  for  a   credit  card   account  that  was   charged   off   in   the
approximate  amount of  $5,540.   Applicant  has made  no  payments  towards  the  account.
He recently received court documents regarding  the  matter.  The debt remains owing.
2.  A  debt is owed  to  a  creditor  for an  account that was charged  off in the  approximate
amount   of   $413   with   a   total  balance   of   $4,235.     Applicant   stated   that   he   has  paid  the
debt off, however he has not provided  documentary evidence to support this.
3.    A   debt  is  owed   to   a   creditor  for  a   credit   card   account  that  was   charged   off   in  the
approximate   amount  of  $2,834.     Applicant  has  made   no   payments  towards  the   debt.
The  debt remains owing.
4.    A   debt  is  owed   to   a   creditor  for  a   cellular   account  that  was   charged   off  in  the
approximate  amount  of $1,199.     The  debt  remains owing.
5.  A  debt is owed  to  a  creditor for an  account that was charged  off in the  approximate
amount  of  $10,681.     Applicant  does  not  recall   the   debt  and   has  not  looked   into   it.    It
appears  to   be   a   personal  loan   opened   in  2015.    (Government  Exhibit  4.)     The   debt
remains owing.
Guideline E  –  Personal Conduct
Applicant  completed  a  security  clearance  application  dated  May  7,  2019.
Section 23, asked him, “In the past seven years have you intentionally engaged in the
misuse of prescription drugs, regardless of whether or not the drugs were prescribed for
you or someone else?”  Applicant answered, “NO.”  (Government Exhibit 1.)  Applicant
deliberately  failed  to  list  the  prescription  drug  use  discussed  above.  Applicant  stated
that he was embarrassed about his past drug addiction and did not list it.
Section 26 of the same application, asked the Applicant, “In the last seven years,
have you had bills or debts turned over to a collection agency? In the last seven years,
have you had any account or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing
to pay as agreed?”  Applicant answered, “NO,” to both questions.  (Government Exhibit
1.)  Applicant deliberately failed to disclose his delinquent debts discussed above.

"Applicant  admitted  allegations  1.a.,  1.b.,  1.c.,  1.e.,  and  2.b.  He  denied
allegations 1.d., 2.a., and 3.a.  He failed to admit or deny allegation 4.a. set forth in the
SOR.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  testimony,  I
make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  31  years  old  and  unmarried.  He  has  four  Master’s  degrees;
Business  Administration  and  Supply  Chain  Management;  Science;  Supply  Chain
Management; and Business Administration.  He is currently applying for a position as a
Linguist II with a defense contractor.  A security clearance in needed in connection with
this employment.
Foreign  Influence  –  Guideline B
Applicant’s  was  born  in  Alexandria,  Egypt  in  1989.  He  came  from  a  well-off
Egyptian  Coptic  orthodox  family.  He  grew  up  in  Egypt,  attended  and  completed  his
elementary school through university level education there, and then immigrated to the
United  States  in  June  2009,  seeking  better  employment  opportunities.  He  became  a
naturalized U.S. citizen in 2015.  He is currently a dual citizen of Egypt and the United
States.
1.a., 1.c., and  1.d.   Applicant’s   mother  and   father  are  citizens  and   residents   of   Egypt.
They are  currently both  retired.   Prior to  his  retirement,  Applicant’s  father served  in the
Egyptian   Air   Force  from   1975   to   1979.  He  was  a   2nd   Lieutenant  and   a  sharp   shooter.
Applicant communicates with  his father by telephone, text,  and  social media on  a  daily
basis.  (Government  Exhibit 3.)  Applicant also  communicates  with  his mother in  Egypt
by  telephone, text,  and   social  media  two   or three   times a   week.    (Government  Exhibit
3.)    His  parents  reside   in  Egypt,   but  have   green   cards  and   come   to   the   U.S.  to   visit
about  every  six  months  or  so.     Applicant’s   father  owns  four  properties  in  Egypt.
Applicant estimates  that his father’s property  in Egypt is worth  about  $200,000  in  U.S.
dollars, rather than $450,000 that he previously told the investigator.  Upon his father’s
death, Applicant stands to inherit an interest in these properties in Egypt.
Applicant’s  Exhibit  C  is  a  letter  to  the  Administrative  Judge,  undated,  which
indicates  that  since  1992,  Applicant’s  father  has  known  the  Director  of  Business
Development  and  Chief  Executive  Saudi  Arabia  for  a  U.S.  Defense  contractor.  (This
individual also submitted a letter of recommendation for Applicant.)  From 1995 to 2007,
Applicant’s  father  was  employed  as  the  General  Manager  of  a  Construction  Company
based in Cairo, Egypt.  The company was owed by the sister of the Director of Business
Development and Chief Executive Saudi Arabia for a U.S. defense contractor.  It is not
clear  whether  this  information  was  disclosed  during  the  investigation  of  the  Applicant.
(See Government Exhibits 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.)
1.b.   Applicant’s   sister  is  a   citizen   of   Egypt  who   now  resides  in  the   U.S.    She   has
obtained   her   permanent  resident  green   card,   and   intends  to   apply  for  her  U.S.
citizenship  next year.  (Tr. p. 33.)
1.e.   Applicant maintains  two  bank  accounts  in  Egypt.   One of  the  accounts he opened
in February 2008, the  other he  opened  in  May 2019.  He  states  that each  account  has
about  $200   in   it.     Applicant  also  has   a   credit   card   that  he   maintains  in  Egypt  and   has
invested   $2,400   in  an   Egyptian   bank  in  order  to   maintain  it.     He  uses  the   credit  card
when  he goes there, and his parents make the payments on it for him.   (Tr. p. 43-44.)
Foreign Preference  –  Guideline C
2.a. and 2.b.  After  becoming  a  naturalized  citizen  of  the  U.S.  in  January  2015,
Applicant primarily resided in and worked in Egypt from about April 2015 to about May
2019.  During  this  period  he  also  voted  in  Egyptian  elections  in  2014  and  2018.
Applicant  stated  that  he  is  encouraged  by  the  Egyptian  Church  Bishops  to  vote  in  the
Egyptian election, especially for the current president because he helped to rebuild the
churches for free after they were burned down  in  the 2011  revolution  in Egypt.  While
living in Egypt, Applicant enrolled as a student for an on-line Master’s program  offered
by  a  U.S.  University.  He  traveled  back  to  the  U.S.  every  six  months  or  so,  when
needed,  in  order  to  finish  his  Master’s  degree.  Applicant  stated  that  he  was
discriminated against by the U.S. University because  they deleted 13 classes  from his
transcript that he believes he should have received credit for.  He was  also placed on
academic probation in 2015.  The complete details of this situation were not presented.
(See Applicant’s Answer to SOR.)
Guideline K –  Handling Protected Information
Since  coming to the  United States,  Applicant has worked various  jobs.  He has
found it difficult to find stable and satisfying employment that will sustain his lifestyle.  In
the  past,  on  several  occasions,  he  has  returned  to  Egypt  to  live  with  his  parents
because of his financial struggles  in the U.S.  From 2013 through 2014, while living in
the U.S., Applicant was financially supported by his parents in Egypt.  During periods of
unemployment, his parents in Egypt have financially supported him.  For several years,
they  have  sent  him  approximately  $1,500  monthly  to pay  his monthly living  expenses.
Applicant explained that on this occasion,  he  returned to Egypt because  he  wanted to
enjoy his family and church practices in Egypt.  He also stated, “In simple terms, if there
was  no  church  in  Egypt,  I  won’t  have  any  motive  to  visit  my  home  country.”
(See
Applicant’s Answer to SOR.)
3.a.    In   March  2020,  while  employed   for  a   defense   contractor,  Applicant   was  fired   for
possessing   a   personal  device  and   taking   unauthorized   pictures  with   that  device  in  a
classified  area.   (Government Exhibit 4, and  Tr. pp. 59-70.)   In  August 2020, working  as
a   security   guard,  he   was  disciplined   for   starting   work  without  wearing   the   required
security officer uniform.
From  2011  to  the  present,  Applicant  has  worked  at  multiple  places  of
employment  in  the  U.S.  He  has  a  less  than  stellar  work  history.  On  a  number  of
occasions, he has either been released from his employment or fired for not fulfilling the
job requirements, or disciplined for misconduct of some sort.  In January 2011, working
as a store clerk, he was fired from his employment for a mistake he made working on
the register.  In May 2011, working as a business  development representative, he was
fired for not meeting the sales targets.  In December 2012, he was fired for sleeping on
the job.  (See Tr. pp. 71-73.)
Personal Conduct –  Guideline E
4.a.  (See discussion above  under 1.d.,  2.a.,  2.b., and 3.a.)
Mitigation
Letters  of  recommendation  from  various  individuals  who  know  the  Applicant
describe  his  favorable  character,  strong  work  ethic,  and  desire  to  obtain  employment.
(Applicant’s Exhibits E, E, F, G, H, I, and J.)
A  letter  from  a  retired  Lieutenant  Colonel,  who  is  currently  a  Director  of
International Business for a defense contractor, states that Applicant  would be a good
candidate for the U.S. military.  (Applicant’s Exhibit D.)  Another letter also indicates that
Applicant’s skills would be  helpful as a  military leader.  (Applicant’s Exhibits E.)  Other
letters recognize Applicant’s good  character and  excellent  technical skills.  (Applicant’s
Exhibits F through J.)
A  letter  from  a  priest affiliated  with  Applicant’s  church back  in  Egypt  states  that
Applicant was born and raised in the Egyptian Orthodox  Church in Egypt.  Applicant is
said  to  be  knowledgeable  in  multiple  languages,  and  has  an  expertise  in  the  Arabic
language  different  dialects.  He  is  described  as  honest,  intelligent,  dependable,  highly
educated and hardworking.  (Applicant’s Exhibit O.)
In  assessing  the  heightened  risk  created  as  a  result  of  Applicant  holding  a
security  clearance,  the  Applicant’s  ties  to  a  potentially  hostile  country  are  important.
Under  the  particular  facts  of  this  case,  I  have  taken  administrative  notice  of  the
information  provided  concerning  the  Country  of  Egypt.   Egypt  is a  republic governed  by
an elected president and bicameral legislature.   Although  China,  Russia,  and Iran,  stand
out  as  three   of  the   most  capable  and   active   cyber  actors  tied   to   economic  espionage
and  the  potential theft  of U.S. trade  secrets and  proprietary information, countries with
closer  ties  to   the   United   States   have   conducted   cyber  espionage   and   other  forms  of
intelligence  collection  to  obtain U.S, technology, intellectual property, trade  secrets, and
proprietary   information.    In   2019,   a   black-market   arms   dealer,   an   Egyptian,  who   was

"Applicant  is  48-year-old  senior  associate  network  engineer,  who  has  been
employed  by  her  defense  contractor  employer  since  March  2021.  She  seeks  a  Secret
security  clearance  as  a  first-time  applicant.  A  clearance  is  a  requirement  of  her
continued employment. (Tr. 24-27; GE 1)
Applicant was born in Iran in 1974 and acquired Iranian citizenship by birth. She
graduated from an Iranian high school before immigrating to the United States in August
1990, at age 18. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in July 1999. As such, she is a
dual citizen of Iran and the United States. She holds a valid Iranian passport issued to
her in May 2021, and holds a valid U.S. passport issued to her in December 2018. (Tr.
32-34, 60; GE 1; AE I, AE J)
Applicant  initially  came  to the United States  in the summer of 1978 on a tourist
visa accompanied by her father, mother, and sister. While Applicant and her family were
visiting  the  United  States,  the  very  first  reports  of  pre-revolution  chaos  and  street
demonstrations  were  being  reported  from  Iran.  It  was  during  this  visit  that  Applicant’s
parents decided to start the application process for the entire family to immigrate to the
United  States.  Applicant  and  her  family  returned  to  Iran  and  witnessed  the  Islamic
Revolution  of  Iran  unfold  in  1979  followed  by  the  hostage  crisis  and  the  Iran/Iraq  war
which began in 1980 and lasted for about eight years. (SOR Answer; Tr. 59-60)
Following  the  Iranian  revolution,  the  Shah  of  Iran  was  overthrown,  and  the
Ayatollah  Khomeini  and  an  Iranian  government  hostile  to  the  United  States  assumed
power. (Tr.  29-31, 59-60)  Applicant’s parents explained  to  her  later  in  her  adult life that
the theme of the rhetoric for uprisings in  1978  resonated quickly  in  their minds as both
Marxist  Populist,   and  Fanatic  Shi’ite   Islamic;  neither  of  which   ideologies   they   nor
likewise,  the  Applicant,  could  ever  subscribe  to.   These  events  in   Iran  shattered  Iran-
U.S.  diplomatic  relations   and   the  immigration   quota  for   Iranian  nationals  was
dramatically  reduced.  As  a  result,  their  immigration  process  took  about  12  years  to
complete. It was not  until 1990  that Applicant and  her  family were finally admitted to the
United States. They have lived here ever since.  (SOR Answer; Tr. 60)
Applicant’s mother is an interior designer who was educated in the U.S., and her
father  was an electrical engineer,  educated in Germany.  Applicant’s  mother and sister
became U.S. citizens, and her father passed away in September 2015 before he could
attain U.S. citizenship. (SOR Answer; Tr. 32, 59; GE 2) Applicant’s father worked in the
private sector in Iran before moving to the United States. Her mother continued working
as an interior designer after she arrived in the United States until she retired. (Tr. 61-62)
Applicant’s mother lives with her in her residence. (Tr. 39) Applicant’s sister is married
to a U.S.-born chemical engineer and employed as a university professor in the field of
environmental  science.  (Tr.  45, 62)  Applicant  has no close or  continuing contacts  with
anyone in Iran. (Tr. 45; AE K) Applicant and her sister live relatively close to each other

Applicant  completed  all  of  her  post-high  school  education  in  the  United  States.
She was awarded a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering in September
1997,  and  a  Master  of  Science  degree  in  electrical  engineering  in  January  1999.  She

Foreign Influence
The   sole   allegation  under  this   concern  alleges  that   Applicant  has  personal
property  in   Iran   valued  at  approximately  $600,000.  (SOR  ¶  1.a)   The   Government
became aware of these holdings when she self-reported them  in  her  October  6, 2019,
SF-86,  and  in  her March 3, 2020,  Office of Personnel  Management  interview. In  her SF-
86,  she  reported  acquiring  these  holdings  in   October   1974.   (GE  1,  GE2)  In   her  SOR
Answer,   Applicant   admitted   this  allegation   with  clarification.  Her  reported   foreign
financial  interests  are   her  share   of  personal   property  assets   that  she   and   her  sister
inherited   directly   from   their   maternal  grandparents   when   they  passed   away.  Applicant
and  her  sister received  an equal  interest in the inheritance.  The personal  property held
in   Iran   consists  of   hand-crafted  silver  and  glass  objects  and  original  paintings
(heirlooms)   that  have   been  in   the  family  a  “[h]undred  and   eighty   years  or   so”  and   are
stored at  a  secure “vault-like”  commercial  storage  facility in  Iran. (SOR Answer; Tr. 35-
36,  52-55,  65,  GE  1,   GE   2;  AE   C)   Post-hearing,  Applicant’s  counsel   submitted
explanatory   family  photos  with  some  of  the   artwork  in   storage   highlighted  in  red.  (AE
BB)
Applicant and her sister intend to  keep these heirlooms  in  storage with the hope
that in  the future relations between the United States and  Iran will  improve and they will
be able to bring  these heirlooms  to the  United States legally.  The current  Iranian export
restrictions did not exist until the Iranian revolution. (Tr. 36-37) Having  been born in  Iran,
Applicant   maintains  her  Iranian  passport   because  she  would   not  be  allowed  to  enter
Iran  with  a  U.S.  passport.  Furthermore,  it  would  be  difficult  if  not  impossible  for
Applicant to  dispose of or sell  any of  the heirlooms  unless she has an Iranian  passport.
Applicant is  willing to give up her Iranian passport  when  this issue is resolved. (Tr.  37-
38, 40)
Iranian customs prohibit the export of antiques and  original artwork, which  is the
reason that Applicant’s family was unable to  export any of those items at the time they
immigrated  to the United States. Hence, she  opted to place  them in  a storage  facility in
the hopes that Iran  would ease  their  export regulations  in  the future. Additionally, as a
U.S. citizen, and  because Iran is presently  a sanctioned country,  Applicant is prohibited
from  engaging  in  any  business   dealings  to  sell   or  send  proceeds  back  to   the  United
States without  an OFAC  license.  Based on  Applicant’s research,  it  appears that OFAC
grants  permission   to  U.S.  persons  to  sell   inherited   real   or  personal   properties   in   Iran.
(SOR Answer; AE C, AE D)
However, Applicant stated since there is no direct banking relationship between
the United States and Iran, bringing the sale proceeds to the United States still remains
complex and risky. It is well known that the foreign exchange houses in Iran charge a
premium  on  top  of  the  exchange  rate  to  transfer  funds  through  a  third  country  to  the
United  States.  These  exchange  houses  make  no  guarantees  whether  the  funds  will
arrive  safely  in  the  United  States  as  the  intermediary  banks  can  also  block  the  funds
based  on  their  own  governing  rules  and  regulations  beyond  OFAC.  (SOR Answer;  Tr.
38-39; GE 2; AE C)
Applicant  pays  the  storage  facility  annual  cash  payments  of  120  Iranian  Rial
(IRR)  in-person  on  behalf  of  her  sister  and  herself.  When  Applicant  paid  the  120  IRR
two years ago, this amount equated to $11 under the then current exchange rate. The
$600,000  valuation  was  done  in  1978,  forty  plus  years  ago  when  Applicant’s
grandparents passed away. The collection has not been appraised since then. Applicant
concedes that it is generally true that art and antiques maintain or appreciate value over
time.  However,  the  Iranian  currency  has  dramatically  lost  its  value  since  the  1979
revolution.  As  a  reference,  at  the  time  of  the  revolution  one  U.S.  dollar  was  being
exchanged for around 70 IRR and today it is being exchanged for around 280,000 IRR,
about 4,000 times reduction in value. Given this severe depreciation of the Iranian Rial,
it is very likely that today’s reappraised value of the collection, in U.S. dollars, would be
much less than the original appraised value. In short, Applicant stated, “[s]o I honestly
cannot  say  is  it  a  greater  value,  lower  value,  where  it  is.  It’s  just  I  don’t  know.”  (SOR
Answer; Tr. 51-52, 56, 58-59, 63-64) Post-hearing, Applicant’s counsel submitted a brief
history  of  the  exchange  rate  in  Iran,  and  articles  that  discussed  the  substantial
devaluation of the IRR from 1980 to 2016 and from 2018 to 2022. (AE CC, AE DD, AE
EE)
Because Applicant does not intend to sell the heirlooms, she has not had a more
recent  appraisal.  If  the  assets  were  forcibly  seized,  the  loss  of  the  assets  would  not
place Applicant in a position for influence or coercion because of her income, real estate
holdings,  and  continuing  employment  in  the  United  States.  The  heirlooms  have  great
sentimental  significance,  and  it  is  Applicant’s  intent  to  maintain  control  of  them.  It
symbolizes her Persian cultural heritage, and she would very much prefer to eventually
have the heirlooms displayed in her own home in the United States. She has opted to
preserve  and  store  the  heirlooms  in  Iran  in  the  hopes  of  being  able  to  legally  export
them from Iran. It was and remains her mother’s wish that Applicant and her sister have
these  family  heirlooms.  (SOR  Answer;  Tr.  40)  Applicant  has  not  given  any  thought  to
the  disposition  of  the  heirlooms  in  Iran  should  the  import  restrictions  still  be  in  effect
after she and her  sister  pass away.  (Tr. 55-56)  If the  Iranian regime  should  change  in
the future, Applicant has no intention of ever moving back to Iran. Her whole career, life,
family, and friends are in the United States. She stated, “I have no reason to go back.”
(Tr. 56-57)
Applicant assured that if for any unforeseen reason, her heirlooms were forcefully
seized  by  the  Iranian  government  she  will  forego  her  financial  interests.  The  financial
loss  of  the  heirlooms  would  not  place  her  in  any  possible  position  for  influence  or
coercion.  She  has  a  strong  sense  of  ethics,  earns  a  substantial  income,  owns  the
property  she  lives  in,  personally  manages  her  mother’s  three  rental  investment
properties valued at “close to $3 million,” and owns a stock investment portfolio valued
at a much greater value then the assets in question. (SOR Answer; Tr. 42, 57; GE 2) If
she was ever approached by any foreign government official attempting to put pressure
on her to reveal classified information, she would report them to the authorities. (Tr. 43)
Applicant travels to Iran “[p]robably once a year, if I have to.” She most recently
accompanied her then 77-year-old mother for a three-week visit to Iran in 2022 to have
some specialized dental work done. Covid restrictions were in place and Applicant and
her  mother  did  not  visit  anyone.  During  this  visit,  Applicant  paid  the  storage  facility
where  her  family  heirlooms  are  being  stored  their  fee  in  IRR  cash.  She  typically  pays
her storage fees “for multiple years” at a time. When making storage fee payments, she
tries to give herself a cushion because of the yearly inflation rate, which recently was at
“46,  47  percent.”  (Tr.  43-50)  She  visited  Iran  in  2021  to  renew  her  Iranian  passport,
which she must do every five years. As of her hearing date, she had no immediate visits
to Iran planned. The frequency of her visits to Iran have varied. For example, the year
her father died she visited Iran three times. And there have been periods of time where
she has not visited Iran for two or three years. (Tr. 48, 50-51)
During  her  hearing,  Applicant  stated  that  her  Iranian  passport  was  stored  in  a
bank  safe  deposit  box.  She  stated  that  if  required  she  would  surrender  her  Iranian
passport  to  her  facility  security  officer  (FSO).  (Tr.  65-66,  68-71)  Post-hearing,
Applicant’s  counsel  submitted  an  Industrial  Security  Letter  dated  January  15,  2019.  In
summary,  that  letter  stated  that  cleared  contractors  who  have  retained  a  cleared
foreign  passport,  based  on  DoD  directions  or  personnel  security
employee’s
adjudicative  decisions,  should  immediately  return  the  foreign  passport,  or  identity  card
to the cleared employee. Upon return the foreign passport to the cleared employee, the
FSO will remind the cleared employee of their responsibility to enter and exit the United
States using their U.S. passport. The cleared contractor would submit an incident report
if  any  cleared  employees  report  uses  of  a  foreign  passport  to  enter  or  exit  the  United
States. (AE AA)
Applicant submitted a notarized statement of intent dated July 12, 2022, in which
she  stated  that  she  would  never  use  her  Iranian  passport  for  any  other  reason  other
than to maintain the safety of family heirlooms, that she has in her possession a valid
Iranian  passport,  that  the  only  reason  she  has  an  Iranian  passport  is  to  secure  and
maintain  the  safety  of  her  family  heirlooms,  and  that  she  will  not  use  her  Iranian
passport  for  any  other  purpose  except  to  maintain  the  safety  of  her  family  heirlooms.
When not in use, she will secure her Iranian passport in her safe deposit box. She will
notify her FSO of the date she removes her Iranian passport from her safe deposit box
and of the date she returns it to the safe deposit box. Lastly, her FSO informed her that
he will no longer take custody of foreign passports of employees. (AE X, AE Z)
Except  for Applicant’s  immediate family  residing in the  United States,  no one is
aware of this heirlooms collection. Even the managers of the commercial storage facility
in  Iran  are  not  fully  aware  of  the  contents  in  the  storage  container.  This  property  is
unlike  real  estate  or  a  bank  account,  which  would  be  registered  under  her  name  and
easily  traced  back  to  her.  (SOR  Answer)  Applicant  has  no  reason  to  believe  that  the
Iranian government has any knowledge of these items. (Tr. 57-58) She opines that the
storage  company  in  Iran  would  contact  her  if  an  issue  ever  developed  regarding
payment,  especially  because  her  family  has  stored  their  goods  at  the  facility  for  three
generations. (Tr. 66-67)
Character Evidence
Applicant’s witness is currently the vice president (VP) of a defense contractor, a
role he previously held with another defense contractor. He has held clearances since
1988 at various levels and currently holds a top secret clearance. Before beginning his
career  as  a  defense  contractor,  he  previously  served  as  a  nuclear  trained  submariner
for 14 years. (Tr. 18-20)
VP  also  submitted  a  reference  letter  on  behalf  of  the  Applicant  in  which  he
stated:
I interviewed, hired, and  managed [Applicant]  at  [defense contractor]  and
during that time  I initiated the process to  get her  approved for  a SECRET
clearance. .  ..  In my time spent  with [Applicant] I believe she cares deeply
for this country and  realizes the deep  impact  the work we  do everyday  has
on maintaining our freedoms and the American way of life. . ..  Today you
have  the ability  to make a difference in  that equation by granting a security
clearance  and   allowing  a  great  mind  to  do  important  technical  and
scientific  work that matters.
VP  testified  that  he  is  familiar  with  the  SOR  allegation  against  Applicant  and
stated that he does not have any concerns about her being granted a security clearance
based on his first-hand knowledge of her character. VP added that Applicant will be able
to contribute to the national defense, and that she will resolve any conflict in favor of the
United States. (Tr. 21-25; AE E)
Applicant  submitted  two  additional  letters:  (1)  from  the  director  of  business
development  of  a  defense  contractor;  and  (2)  the  chief  executive  officer  of  a  cable
company.  Both  individuals  know  Applicant  well  from  their  interactions  with  her  while
employed  with  previous  employers.  They  described  her  as  having  “unparalleled
integrity,” “work ethic beyond reproach,”  and said she was a “dedicated, hard-working,
and  highly  ethical  employee.”  All  three  references  have  extensive  security  clearance
experience  and  strongly  recommend  that  Applicant  be  granted  a  clearance.  (AE  E)

"Applicant was born in Iraq and is 43 years old. He has never married and has no
children.  He  received  a  high  school  diploma  in  Iraq  in  1997  and  earned  a  bachelor’s
degree in Iraq in 2002. In 2003, he was drafted into the Iraqi army. The Iraq War started
shortly thereafter, and he served for 22 days before the war ended with the defeat of the
Iraqi army and the overthrow of the Saddam Hussein government (Hussein Regime). He
worked as a linguist for the U.S. military in Iraq in 2008-2009. In 2010, at the age of 35,
he left his family behind and immigrated by himself to the United States. He had only one
relative in the U.S., a cousin of his mother, and no friends. He became a naturalized U.S.
citizen in 2015. He relinquished his Iraqi citizenship in 2016. He then worked as a linguist
for the  U.S. military in Jordan  in  2016-2017. He presently has  a  job  opportunity  to  work
for  the   U.S.  Army  in  Kuwait  as  a   linguist.  He  is  seeking   national  security  eligibility  in
connection  with  this employment.  He is  a  first-time  applicant  for  a  clearance.  (Tr. at 13-
16, 22, 24,  29, 43-45, 49; GE 1, Sections  2, 9, 12, 17,  18.)
The   SOR  alleged   that   Applicant  has   five   family  members  who   are  citizens   and
residents of Iraq:  his mother (SOR ¶ 1.a), a  brother (SOR ¶ 1.b), a  sister (SOR ¶ 1.c), a
sister-in-law (SOR ¶ 1.d), and  an  uncle  (SOR ¶ 1.e). The  SOR alleged  that  his brother
works for the  Iraqi Ministry of Oil as a  mechanical engineer.  (SOR ¶ 1.b.) His  sister is
alleged  to  work for the  Iraqi Ministry of Construction  as a  Chief Engineer Assistant.  (SOR
¶ 1.c.) His  sister-in-law is alleged  to  work for the  Ministry of Oil  as a  Chief Engineer.  (SOR
¶ 1.d.)  The  SOR further alleged  that his uncle  served  in the  Iraqi Ministry of Defense  as
a  colonel.  (SOR ¶ 1.e.)  The  Government also alleged  that Applicant will  inherit properties
in Iraq.  One  of  the  properties has a  value  of  approximately  U.S. $500,000.  (SOR ¶ 1.e.)
In his Answer, Applicant admitted  each of the SOR allegations.
As noted, the  Government amended  the  SOR before the  hearing  date  to  add  an
allegation  under Guideline  E.  In  SOR ¶  2.a, the  Amendment  alleged  that  Applicant  was
terminated  by Company A  in about  January 2018  “for being  rude  and  abusive  to  locally
hired  support staff  and  other  employees.” The  Amendment further alleged  that  he  refused
to  sign  termination  paperwork, went  Absent  without  Leave,  and  failed  to  demobilize at a
U.S. Army base  in the  United  States  in  accordance  with  company policy. Applicant  denied
the  allegation in the Amendment Answer.
Paragraph 1  - Guideline B,  Foreign Influence
The  Government  alleged  in  this  paragraph  that  Applicant  is  ineligible  for  a
clearance  because  he  has  contacts  and  property  interests  in  Iraq  that  may  create  a
divided allegiance or a conflict of interest, and be a national security concern. His contacts
and property interests also potentially create a risk that Applicant may be manipulated or
induced  to  help  a  foreign  person,  group,  organization,  or  government  in  a  way
inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure or coercion by
a foreign interest.
At the hearing, Applicant described his relationships with the five family members
and the family properties identified in the SOR.
1.a: At the time of the hearing, Applicant was in Iraq taking care of his mother, who
had recently had a foot amputated due to illness. His siblings were unable to take care of
her because they have full-time jobs and families, and have no free time to do so. None
of Applicant’s family members, including his mother, know that he is applying for a DoD
security  clearance.  After  becoming  a  U.S.  Citizen  in  2015,  Applicant  sponsored  his
mother  to  become  a  resident  alien,  which  status  was  granted  in  February  2017.  If
Applicant  returns to the  United States  without a  clearance, he testified  that his mother
would return with him once she is able to travel. If Applicant is granted a clearance and
deploys to Kuwait, he is uncertain whether his mother would relocate to the United States
at that point because she would be alone. (Tr. at 13-14, 17, 18-19, 21, 25-27, 47; AE J;
AE K; AE K.)
1.b:  Applicant and his brother do not have a close relationship. When Applicant is
outside of Iraq, he only speaks with his brother once every six months. His brother does
not know what Applicant does as a linguist. During his current stay in Iraq, Applicant sees
his brother occasionally when Applicant needs help taking their mother to see her doctor.
He does not see his brother otherwise.  His brother has been working as a mechanical
engineer  for  the  Iraqi  Ministry  of  Oil  since  before  2003,  when  the  U.S.  and  its  allies
deposed  Hussein  Regime.  His  brother has  never been  a  member of  the  Ba’ath  Party.
Applicant does not see his brother on holidays when he is in Iraq. (Tr. at 17-18, 26-27,
49-50.)
1.c: The above description of Applicant’s relationship with his brother applies to his
relationship with his sister, except she works for the Ministry of Construction as a chief
engineer assistant. Applicant sees his sister less frequently than he sees his brother. (Tr.
at 18-19, 26-27.)
1.d:   Applicant’s  sister-in-law  is  the  wife  of  his  brother.  Applicant  has  no  contact
with her. She works as a civil engineer for the Iraqi Ministry of Oil. (Tr. at 19, 28.)
1.e:  Applicant’s uncle was a colonel in the Iraqi Ministry of Defense and retired in
1989.  Applicant  has  no  contact  with  him.  He  last  saw  his  uncle  in  2013-2014  when
Applicant’s father was sick. His uncle served in the Iraqi Air Force. (Tr. at 19-20, 30-31.)
1.f:   When  Applicant’s  father  died  in  2015,  Applicant’s  mother  inherited  her
husband’s property, which includes a building with four apartments. She also inherited
the family home. The apartment building has an estimated value of about U.S. $500,000;
and the home is worth about U.S. $300,000. Applicant and his two siblings will inherit the
mother’s  properties  when  she dies. Applicant  is unwilling  to go  through the paperwork
involved  in  claiming  his share of his mother’s estate. He  has no  intention  of asking  his
brother and sister to share one third of their inheritance with him. He explained that when
he immigrated to the United States in 2010, he cut all of his ties to Iraq and now wants
nothing to do with the country, his siblings, or the family property there, even though the
family properties have a significant value. His attorney suggested that there are serious
Iraqi governmental restrictions on removing funds from  that country that would impede
Applicant, as a U.S. citizen, from transfering funds out of Iraq if he were to liquidate his
one-third share of the properties. (Tr. at 20, 22-23, 31-33, 48.)
Paragraph 2  –  Guideline E, Personal Conduct
Applicant  denies  the  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  2.a.  The  allegation  is  based  upon  a
termination letter from Company A addressed to Applicant (GE 4) in which Company A
accused Applicant of being rude and abusive to the local workers in Country X during his
deployment  there  in  2016-2017.  He  claimed  that  this  was  just  an  excuse  used  by  his
employer to  remove  him  from  his job.  He  explained  that  his problem  with  Company  A
began  at  a  staff  meeting  with  a  U.S.  Army  officer  who  distributed  a  form  regarding
Company A’s ethics and treatment of its linguists to be answered anonymously. One of
the linguists spoke openly and praised Company A and his supervisor. Applicant raised
his hand and said that he and others do not share that opinion. He then had a private
conversation  with  the  officer  and  spoke  negatively  about  how  Company  A  treated  its
linguists. (Tr. at 36-37; Amendment Answer.)
Later  in  December  2017,  Applicant’s  supervisor  received  a  call  from  Applicant
about his comments to the Army officer and sent Applicant an email stating that the U.S.
Army asked for his removal for being rude to  local staff members. Applicant discussed
his removal with his Army point of contact. The contact was surprised and denied that this
came  from  Army.  Applicant  was  subsequently  advised  that  his  removal  order  came
directly from his employer and that the Army could do nothing to help him. He was advised
that he would be transferred to Kuwait in three days. He arrived at the airport in Kuwait
and no one was there to meet him. He had no directions as to where to go. After six hours
of waiting in the airport, he reached a supervisor by email and the supervisor told him to
take a bus to a U.S. base in Kuwait and wait for instructions. He had sent his bags to
Company  A’s  offices  in  Kuwait,  and  they  were  never  delivered  to  him  at  the  transient
housing at the base. He kept asking representatives of Company A what they planned to
do  with  him,  and  he  was  told  that  they  would  let  him  know.  (Tr.  37-41;  Amendment
Answer.)
While he was in Kuwait, Applicant’s brother called him and told him he needed to
come to Iraq because their mother required immediate surgery and no one in the family
could  take  care  of  her.  When  he  spoke  to  Company  A  about  his  need  for  a  four-day
emergency leave, he was told that a U.S. Army officer would need to approve his request.
Time passed without a response. Applicant felt that it was important for his mother that
he be in Iraq for a few days to help with her care. He advised his employer that he was
leaving for Iraq for a brief trip to care for his mother and would return. When he got to
Iraq, he received a text message from his employer asking where he was. He responded
that he was in Iraq as he had advised. He received a reply stating that he was fired, and
he was instructed to turn in his badge. He sent his CAC to his employer. His mother’s
health worsened, and he stayed with her in Iraq. When she recovered from her surgery
in 2018, Applicant and his mother returned to the United States.  His mother eventually
travelled back to Iraq and Applicant joined her in December 2021, when her health again
required his assistance. (Tr. at 41-44; Amendment Answer.)
Mitigation and Whole-Person Evidence
Applicant testified with sincerity that at the start of the coalition’s war to overthrow
the Hussein Regime in 2003, he felt that he was seeing the beginning of an important
historical change, or in his words “the light at the end of the tunnel.” Prior to that war, the
future  of  the  Iraqi  people  was  uncertain.  After  the  war,  he  was  pleased  to  have  the
opportunity to work as a linguist for the U.S. Army in 2008, to help his country transition
from  dictatorship  to democracy and a  better life  for its  citizens.  Over time, he became
disillusioned that the Iraqi people themselves were creating new problems both against
the  U.S.  Government’s  efforts  to  create  a  functioning  government  and  society,  and
against  each  other  in  religious  strife.  He  felt  unsafe  and  unhappy.  His  disillusionment
ultimately led him to leave his family and the country of his birth to emigrate to the United
States in 2010. (Tr. at 34-35; AE Q.)
Before  immigrating,  Applicant  worked  for  Company  A  as  a  linguist  for  the  U.S.
Army  in  Iraq  during  the  period  August  2008  through  September  2009.  In  that  role,  he
would accompany U.S. troops on missions outside of their compound and risk his life as
an unarmed linguist. He also translated sensitive military and police records for U.S. and
Iraqi officials, and acted as an interpreter for military transition teams. (Tr. at 23-24; AE
D; AE G.)
After immigrating, he worked in the United States in at least three jobs in the period
2012  to  2015.  Applicant  worked  for  Company  A  in  a  second  deployment,  this  time  in
Country X, during the period September 2016 to January 2018. In that position, he worked
with  U.S.  Army  training  teams  as  part  of  an  operational  engagement  program  training
Country X police. His duties included translation work with the trainees and keeping local
civilians out of harm’s way during live-fire operations. The commanding officer wrote, in
a  Memorandum  for  Record,  that  Applicant  “performed  exceptionally  well  as  a  linguist
during  Entry  Control  Point  training”  and  “contributed  to  [building  a]  strong  relationship
between the [Country X’s forces] and the U.S. forces.” (AE E, AE F.)
Applicant  was issued a  badge to enter his base  in  Iraq and a  CAC to enter the
base in Country X where he lived and worked. He never had any security issues. During
his  work  for  the  U.S.  Army  in  Iraq  and  Country  X,  or  at  any  time  thereafter,  he  never
discussed his work as a contract linguist for the U.S. Army with any family members. No
one in his family knows that he is seeking a DoD security clearance. (Tr. at 18, 23-24,
31.)
Iraq
Applicant has significant contacts with Iraq. Accordingly, it is appropriate to look at
the current conditions in that country.  Iraq is a constitutional parliamentary republic. Its
most  recent  parliamentary  elections  were  in  October  2021.  They  were  generally
considered free and fair, and an improvement over the prior elections in 2018.
U.S. citizens in Iraq  are  at high  risk of violence  directed  against  them. The  U.S.
Department  of  State’s  Travel Advisory for Iraq  urges U.S.  citizens not to  travel  to  Iraq  due
to  terrorism, kidnapping, armed  conflict, and  civil unrest. According  to  a  February 2022
assessment  by  the   Office  of  the   Director  of  National  Intelligence,  Iranian-supported
proxies  are  capable  of   launching   attacks   against   U.S.  forces   and   persons   in  Iraq   and
Syria. Iran  remains a  problematic  actor across the  region  with  its backing  of  Iraqi Shia
militias, which are the primary threat to U.S. personnel in Iraq. Islamic State in Iraq and
Syria (ISIS) is a designated terrorist organization and is active in Syria and near the Iraq
border. Also, ISIS leaders remain committed to their vision of building a self-styled global
caliphate headquartered in Iraq and Syria and are working to rebuild its capabilities.
ISIS and its associated terrorist groups indiscriminately commit attacks and violent
atrocities in Iraq despite improved Iraqi government control. Although ISIS maintained its
capability  to  conduct  deadly  terrorist  attacks  in  Iraq,  these  attacks  resulted  in  fewer
casualties in 2020 than in previous recent years.
Significant  human  rights  issues  exist  in  Iraq.  They  range  from  unlawful  and
arbitrary  killings,  including  extrajudicial  killings  by  the  Iraqi  government  and  forced
disappearances  by  the  government,  to  serious  restrictions  on  free  expression  and  the
media and serious government corruption.
The  United  States  maintains  vigorous  and  broad  engagement  with  Iraq  on
diplomatic,  political,  economic,  and  security  issues  in  accordance  with  the  U.S.-Iraq
Strategic Framework Agreement. The Agreement reflects the important relationship and
common goals the two countries share.
",True
"In  Applicant’s SOR response,  he denied SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, 3.a, and 3.b.  He
admitted SOR ¶ 2.a. Applicant’s admission is accepted as a finding of fact. (Item 1)
Applicant is 56 years old. He enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in 1985, and he received
an honorable discharge in 1996. He was married and divorced twice. He was married a
third time to a Filipino national in 2000, and the marriage was annulled in 2013. In August
2020, he met a female citizen of Thailand online, with whom he maintains a long-distance
romantic  relationship.  Since  January  2021,  Applicant  has  worked  for  a  government
contractor, and his job title is fuel-systems employee. (Items 1, 3 and 4)
Personal Conduct
The SOR alleges personal conduct security concerns under Guideline E. On April
25, 2013, Applicant’s employment with a government contractor was terminated following
an investigation into computer misuse. His United Arab Emirates (UAE) base privileges
were  revoked,  and  he  was  barred  from  the  UAE  worksite.  (SOR  ¶  1.a.)  When  he
completed  the  security  clearance  application  in  January  2021,  he  deliberately
misrepresented his 2013 employment termination. He listed that his employment with the
government  contractor  began  in  March  2005  continuing  through  March  2014,  and  his
employment concluded at that time due to “end of contract.” (SOR ¶ 1.b.) Applicant denied
these allegations. (Items 1 and 2)
In his SOR response, Applicant claimed that he was released from employment
“due to other issues and slots closing.” He stated that he inadvertently misdated the end
date (March 2014) of his employment “by a few months.”  He provided a letter from the
government  contractor as  supporting  evidence.  The  letter  dated  April 25,  2013,  stated
that  Applicant  was  being  terminated  effective  the  date  of  the  letter  “due  to  customer
restrictions in [his] current position.” It did not mention that his employment ended after
fulfillment  of  a  contract,  as  listed  on  the  2021  SCA.  The  Government  submitted  an
adverse incident report and a current email communication from the human resources
(HR) department  of  this  former  employer.  Both  documents  showed that  Applicant  was
terminated in 2013 as follows: (Items 1, 2, 4 and 5)
“Subject’s employment  with  [DOD contractor] has  been  terminated  due  to
ongoing   investigation   into   computer  misuse.   Base   pass  was  revoked   by
UAE   and   he   was  barred   from   the   UAE   site.  Investigation   was   being
conducted by the  Emirates.”  (Item 5)
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges that Applicant falsified his January 2021 SCA by deliberately
omitting information about his close and continuing contact with a citizen of Thailand, with
whom he had a romantic relationship and to whom he was providing financial support at
the time. In his February 2022 SOR response, he denied this allegation, but admitted that
he is very close with the foreign national and he had recently asked her to marry him.
Since she is his fiancée, he expected that if she requested monetary assistance  in the
future, he would provide it to her. (Items 1, 2, 3 and 4)
Foreign Influence
The  SOR  alleges  a  Guideline  B  security  concern  that  Applicant  has  maintained
close and continuing contact with a citizen of Thailand, whom he met online in August
2020, and to whom he has provided financial support. (SOR ¶ 2.a.) In his February 2022
SOR response, he admitted this information and explained that they are  now engaged
but they have not set a wedding date. During his background interview in March 2021, he
freely disclosed, without confrontation by the investigator, that they met online in August
2020, after she was introduced to him by mutual friends. She is independently wealthy
and does not need to work. They communicate with each other almost daily. She has a
bachelor’s degree in hotel management. In February 2021, she requested that he send
her $200, and he did so without requiring an explanation. She is unaware of this job and
his current DOD security clearance. She is not affiliated with Thailand’s government, and
he  made  an  inadvertent  mistake  by  not  listing  her  on  his  SCA.  He  stated  that  he  has
served honorably in the U.S. military for over a decade, he is an American first, and he
would never betray his country. (Items 1, 2, 3 and 4)
Financial Considerations
The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant has an outstanding state tax
lien  filed  against  him  in  the  amount  of  approximately  $6,000,  and  he  has  a  consumer
credit account that was charged off in 2020 for $11,232. (SOR ¶¶ 3.a and 3.b.) Applicant
denied these allegations. He claimed that he never resided in the state that filed a tax lien
against him, and he was considering hiring a company or firm to dispute this lien. During
Applicant’s  2012  clearance  investigation,  a  February  2012  credit  report  listed  this
September  2010  state  tax  lien.  Court  records  dated  October  2021  also  report  this
outstanding state tax lien. (Items 1, 2, 6 and 8)
Applicant’s  February  2021  credit  report  lists  the  delinquent  credit  account.
Applicant claimed in his SOR response that his delinquent consumer account was paid
following  his  March  2021  background  interview.  He  had  opened  this  account  to  make
repairs  on  his  home.  He  did  not  submit  any  documentary  evidence  to  corroborate  his
claim. (Items 1, 2, 3, 6 and 7)

"Applicant was born in the United States in 1956. His parents, now deceased, were
Iranian citizens working in the U.S. as part of a technology-exchange program between
the  Iranian  Government  and  the  United  States  before  the  1979  Islamic  Revolution.
Applicant is a dual citizen of the U.S. and Iran due to his birth in the United States and his
parents’ Iranian citizenships. He lived in the U.S. until age six, when his family moved
back to Iran in 1962. He lived there until he graduated from high school. He returned to
the  United  States  for  his  higher  education  and  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  1979,  a
master’s degree in 1980, and a doctoral degree in 1986. As a young man, he received a
medical exemption from performing mandatory military service in Iran. He has worked for
40 years in the United States and Europe and asserts that his professional “reputation is
very well established.” Applicant held a DoD secret clearance in the 1980s. He presently
works for a  DoD  contractor as  an  engineer and  is seeking eligibility  for a  clearance  in
relation to his employment. (Tr. at 9-10, 17, 19-27, 39-40, 57-58; GE 1, Sections 2, 9, 12,
17, 18, 25.)
Applicant’s parents became naturalized U.S. citizens before they returned to Iran
with Applicant and his three sisters in 1962. His father was a railroad locomotive expert.
He  came  to  the  United  States  in  1952  as  an  employee  of  the  Iranian  Ministry  of
Transportation and Railroads to research ways to improve  the Iranian railroad system.
He and his family returned to Iran because he was laid off at his job at a U.S. research
facility. Applicant’s parents returned to live in the United States in 1978, one year before
the revolution in Iran. They lived in the U.S. the remainder of their lives. His three sisters
also continued their adult lives in the United States. (Tr. at 19-27.)
Applicant  has  been  married  twice.  In  1987,  he  married  an  Iranian-born  woman,
who is a dual citizen of the United States and Iran. They divorced in 2018. They have two
adult children. Applicant remarried another Iranian-born woman in 2019. She is a citizen
of  Iran  and  lives  with  Applicant  in  the  United  States.  She  is  a  U.S.  lawful  permanent
resident (LPR). She intends to apply for U.S. citizenship when she has met the residency
requirement in 2024. Her father is deceased. At the time Applicant submitted the e-QIP,
his mother-in-law was alive, but she passed away in September 2022. His wife has three
brothers and a sister who are Iranian citizens and residents. Her family are part of a small,
minority religious group in Iran. She speaks with her sister and one of her brothers by
phone with some frequency. Applicant’s wife works in the United States as a mathematics
teacher at a private school. (Tr. at 33-39, 41-43; GE 1 at Sections 17, 18; AE A.)
Applicant  has  travelled  to  Iran  several  times  during  his  adult  life,  including  a
number of  times  after the  Iranian  Revolution.  He  traveled  frequently  to  Iran to  visit  his
future second wife before they married in 2019 and until she received her visa to enter
the United States as his wife in 2021. He uses his Iranian passport to enter Iran because
that is a requirement of the Iranian Government. Now that his mother-in-law has died, he
no  longer  has  any  reason  to  return  to  Iran.  If  his  wife  returns  to  Iran  to  visit  with  her
siblings, Applicant claims that he has no reason to travel with her. Applicant’s last trip to
Iran was in April 2021 to escort his second wife to the United States following her receipt
of her LPR status. He did not travel to Iran to attend the funeral services for his mother-
in-law in 2022. Applicant stated that, from his prior experience as a clearance holder, he
understands the foreign travel procedures and the importance of compliance with those
security procedures in the event he travels anywhere outside the United States.  (Tr. at
29-33, 44-45, 55.)
Guideline B,  Foreign Influence
At the hearing, Applicant responded to the following allegations in the SOR:
1.a:   Applicant’s   Wife.   Applicant’s  wife  is  a  citizen  of  Iran.  As  of  2021,  she  has
relocated to be with Applicant in the United States and is a lawful permanent resident in
the U.S. She intends to apply for U.S. citizenship when she Is eligible to do so in 2024.
1.b:  Applicant’s  Mother-in-Law. Applicant’s mother-in-law died a few months prior
to the hearing. Her death makes the alleged security concern under this subparagraph
moot.
Iran
Through  his  wife’s  citizenship  in  Iran,  Applicant  has  contact  with  that  country.
Accordingly, it is appropriate to look at the current conditions in Iran.
Iran is an authoritarian theocratic republic with a Shia Islamic political system. Shia
clergy  and  political  leaders  vetted  by  the  clergy  dominate  key  power  structures  in  the
country.  Iran’s  Supreme  Leader  is  the  head  of  state  and  holds  constitutional  authority
over the judiciary, government-run media, and other important institutions.
The U.S. Department of State advises U.S. citizens not to travel to Iran due to the
risk of kidnapping and the arbitrary arrest and detention of U.S. citizens. Since 1984, Iran
has been designated by the United States as a state sponsor of terrorism. Its support of
terrorist  organizations throughout  the  Middle East  creates  instability  in  the  region.  Iran
threatens U.S. persons directly and through proxy attacks, particularly in the Middle East.
Iran’s growing  expertise  and  willingness to  conduct aggressive  cyber operations
make it a major threat to U.S. and allied networks and data. As of 2018, all previously
suspended  sanctions  imposed  on  Iran  were  reinstated  with  the  goals  of  permanently
preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, ceasing Iran’s development of ballistic
missiles, and ending Iran’s broad range of malign activities.
The U.S. Department of State has identified significant human rights issues in Iran.
The  issues  include  the  unlawful and  arbitrary  killings  by  the  Iranian  Government  or  its
agents;  forced  disappearances  attributed  to  the  government;  torture  and  inhumane
treatment  by  the  government  and  its  agents;  the  imprisonment  of  political  opponents;
severe  restrictions  on  free  expression  and  the  media;  serious  restrictions  on  political
participation; and government corruption.

"The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant’s  wife  (SOR  1.a),  children  (SOR  1.b),  parents
(SOR 1.c), and siblings (SOR 1.f) are citizens and residents of Kosovo. The SOR also
alleged that Applicant’s best friend and his friend’s wife (SOR 1.g), a sister-in-law (SOR
1.h), two childhood friends (SOR 1.i), and a niece (SOR 1.j) are all citizens and residents
of Kosovo.
Further,  the  SOR  alleged  that  between  October  2007  and  November  2015,
Applicant resided at a U.S. military installation in Kosovo as part of his employment with
a  U.S.  defense  contractor,  and  that  he  maintained  regular  contact  with  his  wife  and
children and other family members who were living in Kosovo  during that period (SOR
1.d). Additionally, the SOR alleged that Applicant, his wife and his children, have lived in
Kosovo with his parents since November 2015 (SOR 1.e).
Finally, the SOR alleged that Applicant’s wife maintains a bank account in Kosovo
with a balance of about $12,000, which Applicant provided (SOR 1.k); and that Applicant
owns three properties in Kosovo with an approximate total value of $180,000 (SOR 1.l).
Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. In addition to the facts established
by Applicant’s admissions, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 41 years old. When he was born, Serbia, formerly a part of the now-
dissolved Yugoslavia, controlled the Yugoslavian province of Kosovo, where he and his
family  and  friends  all  lived.  When  Kosovo  declared  independence  in  2008,  Applicant
became a citizen of the newly-formed nation of Kosovo; however, he was always a citizen
of  Kosovo  as  it  existed  before  the  Kosovo  War  of  1998  –  1999  and  subsequent
independence  from  Serbia.  He  was  raised  and  educated  in  Kosovo  through  his  high
school graduation in 1999. Between June and December 2002, he worked as a linguist
for  a  U.S.  defense  contractor  in  support  of  U.S.  forces  operating  as  part  of  a  NATO
coalition put in place after the Kosovo War ended in 1999. (GX 2; GX 3; Tr. 27 – 28)
In December 2002, at age 21, Applicant traveled to the United States on a tourist
visa. During that visit, he met a woman who was a U.S. citizen and they decided to get
married. They arranged to be married in June 2003 before his tourist visa expired and he
would be forced to return to Kosovo, and either obtain a new tourist visa or apply for entry
to  the  United  States  for  different  reasons.  After  his  marriage,  he  obtained  permanent
resident status in the United States by virtue of his marriage to a U.S. citizen. (GX 1; GX
2; GX 3; Tr. 28 – 29)
Applicant joined the U.S. Army on January 13, 2004. The following day, he and his
American wife finalized their divorce. Applicant claims she did not want to move to his
duty station in another state or to be married to someone who would have to move a lot
for military assignments. He served as an airborne infantryman and deployed on multiple
combat  missions  in  the  Middle  East.  By  serving  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  military,
Applicant was able to become a naturalized U.S. citizen, which he did in October 2004.
He  received a  security  clearance in  March 2007, and  he  was  honorably discharged in
September 2007. (GX 1; GX 3; Tr. 11 – 12, 29 – 32)
Two months after his discharge, Applicant returned to Kosovo. In 2007, he found
employment there for the next eight years as a linguist with two U.S. defense contractors
supporting the ongoing U.S. military mission. He later was promoted to a management
position  involving  physical  security  requirements  for  the  U.S.  military  installation  in
Kosovo that was his job site. He worked in that capacity in Kosovo until 2015, when the
contract ended.  During his employment, Applicant  had access to classified information
based  on  the  security  clearance  he  held  in  the  Army.  The  record  does  not  contain  a
reapplication  for  clearance  between  his  2007  discharge  and  the  February  2019
application that is being sponsored by his new employer. (GX 1; GX 2; GX 3)
Applicant remarried in April 2006 and has two children. His current wife is a citizen
resident of Kosovo. She has since been granted permanent resident status in the United
States. Except for visits to Applicant’s duty station in the United States, she has stayed in
Kosovo  since  2006,  including  while  Applicant  completed  the  last  of  his  combat
deployments to the Middle East before his discharge in 2007. His two children, now ages
8 and 13, were born in Kosovo after Applicant was discharged from the Army. (Answer;
GX 1; GX 2; GX 3; Tr. 33 – 35)
Because Applicant’s children were born abroad to a U.S. citizen, they were eligible
for U.S. citizenship at birth, their status being derived from Applicant’s U.S. citizenship.
However, Applicant testified they could not immediately receive U.S. citizenship because
he had not been physically present in the United States for five years before they were
born.  Thus,  he  was  required  first  to  establish  their  Kosovo  citizenship  (he  obtained
Kosovo passports for them), then obtain immigrant visas for each child and apply for their
naturalization after the family returned to the United States, which they did in August 2020.
The children are now dual citizens of the United States and Kosovo. (GX 1; Tr. 38 – 39;
see also 8 U.S.C. § 1401(g))
Between 2007 and 2015, Applicant lived at the military facility in Kosovo that was
his job site. His family remained at their home in Kosovo and Applicant was able to see
them  periodically  during  scheduled  time  off.  This  was  required  by  the  terms  of  his
employment  because  he  was  on  call  at  all  times.  In  January  2019,  he  was  hired  by
another U.S. defense contractor for work as a linguist at the same facility in Kosovo. His
employment is contingent on his renewed eligibility for a security clearance. He testified
that if he does not qualify for employment as a contractor in Kosovo, he will take his family
back to the United States to find work. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; GX 3; Tr. 11 – 12, 53 – 54)
After  leaving   his  job   in   2015,  Applicant  remained   in   Kosovo   with   his  wife   and
children. He did not seek further work, choosing  instead  to  be  a  stay-at-home  father  in
Kosovo  between  2015  and 2020  while his wife completed her college studies in  Kosovo.
In August 2020, after he had received the  SOR and  became  uncertain about whether he
would be  able work as  a  linguist in Kosovo, Applicant and  his family moved  back to  the
United States where they rented a  place to live so his children could attend school in the
U.S.  for  the   2021   –   2022   school  year.  During   the   summers  of  2021   and   2022,   they
returned  to  Kosovo. He  appeared  for his hearing  virtually from  Kosovo. While  he  wants
his children  to  experience  their  heritage  in Kosovo, he  does not want them  to  attend  the
public  schools  there.  However,  he   cannot   afford  private   Kosovo   schools  without   the
income  from  his potential employment as a  linguist there. Pending  the  outcome  of this
adjudication, he  planned to return with  his family to the United States so his children can
attend  school here.  It  is assumed  that he  has  returned  to  the  United  States  for  the  2022
–  2023  school year. Applicant will  bring  his family back to  Kosovo  if he  gets his clearance,
and  he  eventually wants to retire there. (GX  1;  Tr. 4, 25  –  27, 39, 50  –  52)
Applicant  also  owns  three  properties  in  Kosovo,  which  he  purchased  between
2014 and 2018. During his background investigation and counterintelligence screening
for his linguist position, he estimated those properties were worth about $180,000 total.
At  his hearing,  he  testified  their  value  has  likely  increased  significantly.  When  he  is  in
Kosovo, Applicant and his family live in an apartment he owns. He leases the other two
properties to a friend who uses one as a bar and restaurant business, and the other as
storage for that business. (GX 1 – GX 3; Tr. 44 – 47)
Applicant  does  most  of  his  banking  through  U.S.-based  financial  institutions.
During his previous employment as a linguist, he opened a bank account in Kosovo for
his wife to use while he resided at the U.S. military facility. At one point, he had deposited
about  $12,000  USD  in  that  account,  but  he  now  estimates  there  is  about  $3,500
remaining. In his other U.S. accounts, Applicant has about $50,000 in retirement savings
and  investment  funds.  He  has  been  able  to  support  his  family  through  non-defense
industry jobs while in the United States, proceeds from the two properties he leases in
Kosovo, and a monthly disability benefit from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).
When they are in Kosovo, his wife works as a teacher. When they were last in the United
States, he worked as a delivery driver between November 2021 and May 2022. (GX 1 –
3; Tr. 54 – 58)
Applicant’s  parents  are  both  retired  teachers.  When  he  and  his  family  are  in
Kosovo, he visits or calls them almost every day. When he is in the United States, he
calls them several times weekly. The same is true for his contact with his brothers and
sisters, a sister-in-law, and a niece who are resident citizens of Kosovo. Applicant also
has continuing contact with his best friend and his wife, and with two childhood friends
when he is in Kosovo, but their interactions are less frequent when he and his wife and
children are in the United States. None of Applicant’s family members or his friends are
employed  by  the  Kosovo  government;  nor  do  they  have  any  other  connection  to  the
government of Kosovo or any other foreign country. (GX 2; Tr. 40 – 43)
To properly assess the security significance of foregoing within the adjudicative
guideline at issue, I have taken administrative notice of certain facts regarding Kosovo as
presented  in  GX  4.  Additionally,  some  of  the  information  about  Kosovo  requires
examination  of  the  breakup  of  Yugoslavia  and  the  ensuing  Balkans  War  and  Kosovo
Conflict. To that end, I sua sponte have taken notice of information about that region and
current U.S. involvement there that is available on the U.S. Department of State website.
Specifically,  I  have  relied  on  the  following  documents:  U.S.  State  Department  Travel
Advisory for Kosovo, dated October 4, 2020(3 pages) (HX 3, Enclosure 1), and Kosovo
2021  Human  Rights  Report  (41  pages)  (HX  3,  Enclosure  2).1  As  indicated,  supra,  on
remand I provided the parties copies of these documents and they had an opportunity to
object, provide comments, and submit additional information. Neither party objected or
submitted any additional information.
1 Online URLs for both Enclosure 1 and Enclosure 2 were provided at page 3, supra.
Since separating from Serbia and Yugoslavia, Kosovo has generally modeled its
system of governance on western democracies. Since the end of the Kosovo War in 1999,
the United States has been actively involved in helping Kosovo establish an independent
judiciary  and  to  provide  for  its  own  security.  The  U.S.  and  NATO  have  maintained  a
military presence in Kosovo as part of the Kosovo Force (KFOR) made up of troops from
28 countries. KFOR is still required in Kosovo to help counter instability caused by the
influx from foreign fighters, such as ISIS, and large numbers of migrants displaced by the
civil  war  in  Syria  and  ongoing  violence  in  Iraq  and  Kurdistan.  Additionally,  the  U.S.
Department  of  State  has  issued  travel  advisories  for  travel  in  certain  parts  of  Kosovo
where ethnic tensions and civil unrest continue to flare up and act as catalysts for terrorist
activities.
Kosovo’s political system  is premised  on  open  representation  of its citizens and
the   emphasis  on   individual  liberties  and   the   rule   of   law.   Nonetheless,   human   rights
violations  are  not  uncommon,  mostly affecting  under-represented  ethnic minorities. The
State  Department’s Kosovo  2021  Human  Rights Executive  Summary  stated  the  following:
Significant  human   rights  issues  included   credible   reports  of:   serious
restrictions on  free  expression  and  media,  including  violence  or threats of
violence   against   journalists;   serious   government  corruption   and   impunity;
and   crimes  involving   violence   or  threats   of  violence   targeting   ethnic
minorities or other marginalized  communities.  The  government took  steps
to   identify,   investigate,  prosecute,  and   punish   officials  who   committed
human   rights  abuses,  but   at   times  lacked   consistency.   Many   in  the
government,  the  opposition, civil society, and  the  media reported  instances
of  senior  officials  engaging   in  corruption   or  acting   with   impunity.   The
government  sometimes  suspended,   removed   offenders  from   office,  or
transferred   the   accused,  and   the   justice  sector  sometimes  took  steps  to
prosecute and punish those officials who committed abuses, offenses, and
crimes.  Many corrupt officials, however, continued  to  occupy public  sector
positions.  (HX  3, Enclosure 2)
Based  on  the  foregoing,  it  is  clear  that  Kosovo  strives  to  be  a  stable,
democratically-governed country,  with interests consistent with  those of  the European
Union  and  NATO.  Nonetheless,  persistent  ethnic  strife,  terrorist  activities,  an  uneven
human rights record, and other conditions on which the State Department has based its
travel  advisories  for  Kosovo,  all  support  a  finding  that  there  is  a  heightened  risk
associated with having personal and financial ties there.
",False
"In  his  Answer, Applicant admitted  the  following  allegations:  SOR ¶¶  1.a, 1.c,  1.d,
1.e, 1.g, 1.i, 1.k,  1.l, 1.m, and  1.n. He denied the  allegations in SOR  ¶¶ 1.b, 1.f, 1.h,  and
1. j. He  admitted  the  allegations in SOR ¶¶  2.a  and  2.c; he  denied  the  allegations in SOR
¶¶ 2.b  and  2.d. His admissions  are  incorporated  into  these  findings of fact.  He  did  not
answer the  allegations in SOR ¶ 3.a,  and  in  SOR ¶ 4.a; hence,  they will be construed as
denials.  (Item   1)  After  a   thorough   and   careful  review  of  the   pleadings  and   exhibits
submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 41 years old and has been married three times. From 2006 to 2008,
he was married to Wife 1. They resided in the United States. From 2015 to 2017, he was
married  to  Wife  2.  They  resided  in  South  Korea.  In  2018,  he  married  Wife  3  in  the
Philippines. She, his two children, and a stepchild reside there. At the time he completed
his SCA, he was residing in South Korea (Item 2)
Applicant graduated from high school in 2000. He served in the Army from 2001
to 2018, when he was honorably discharged. In November 2011, he received a security
clearance with a warning that if he failed to resolve his delinquent debts, his clearance
could be suspended. (Item 2, Item 7)
In  January  2020,  Applicant  began  a  position  with  a  defense  contractor.  In  July
2020,  he  submitted  a  security  clearance  application  (SCA).  Prior  to  this  position,  he
worked for two other defense contractors during 2019. He reported that he has been living
in South Korea since January 2020. (Item 2)
In  February,  March,  and  May  2021,  a  government  investigator  interviewed
Applicant  about  background  information.  Subsequently,  the  Government  sent  him
interrogatories,  which  included  a  report  of  his  enhanced  subject  interview.  Applicant
verified that the information contained in the report was accurate. (Item 3)
Financial Considerations
Based on Applicant’s admissions and credit bureau reports (CBR) from September
2022, July 2021, and July 2020, the SOR alleged 12 delinquent debts totaling $57,815,
which became delinquent between 2015 and 2022. (Items 4, 5, and 6) The status of those
debts is as follows:
Applicant  admitted  owing  the  debts  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  ($25,016);  1.c  ($2,494);  1.d
($1,336); 1.e ($1,260); 1.g ($463); 1.i ($337); 1.k ($3,759); and 1.l ($13,694). They total
$48,359. Applicant did not submit evidence to prove they are paid or being paid.
Applicant denied owing the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b ($7,456); 1.f ($1,228); 1.h ($436);
and 1.j ($336). He presented proof that he resolved the $7,456 debt in SOR ¶ 1.b. (Item
at 7). He did not provide documentation that he resolved the other three, which total $772.
During a February 2021 interview, Applicant did not recognize all of the debts that
the government investigator asked him about but said he would pay those that are legally
his obligation. He said he did not have money to pay his debts because his former wife,
Wife 2, created a financial hardship for him and spent all his money. He also disclosed
that he  was paying  the  Defense  Finance and  Accounting  Services  (DFAS)  15%  of his
salary through a garnishment. He owed $13,694 for a part of the reenlistment bonus he
received but was not entitled to because he left the Army before the end of the enlistment
period. (Item 2 at 50, Item 3 at 5, 8, 10)
Under  Guideline  F,  the  SOR  alleged  in  ¶  1.m  that  in  October  2018,  Applicant
received  nonjudicial  punishment  (NJP)  for  violations  of  the  Uniform  Code  of  Military
Justice  (UCMJ)  Article  92,  for  wrongfully  borrowing  money  from  two  junior  enlisted
soldiers,  and  Article  134,  for  dishonorably  failing  to  repay  another  junior  soldier  from
whom he borrowed money for personal expenses. He was subsequently reduced in rank,
forfeited pay, and received an oral reprimand. Applicant disclosed this information during
his February 2021 interview. (Item 1, Item 3 at 3-4)
The SOR alleged in ¶ 1.n that in November 2016, Applicant received NJP for a
violation  of  the  UCMJ,  Article  107,  for  making  multiple  false  statements  that  he  was
obtaining funds to help him pay his rent, and a  violation of Article 134 for dishonorably
failing to then pay his rent. He received an oral reprimand, 45 days of extra duty, and a
reduction in rank. At the time he made the false statements, he was in Belgium and told
the soldier that he would obtain the money from his wife, who was in a different country,
to repay the money he borrowed. (Item 2, Item 3 at 3-4)
Foreign Influence
As noted above, I take administrative notice of the facts about the Philippines that
were  set  forth  in  the  official  U.S.  Government  publications  that  were  attached  to
include  that  the
Department  Counsel’s  request  for  administrative  notice.  These
Philippines  are  a  constitutional  republic  with  a  bicameral  legislature.  Its  citizens  and
foreigners have been targeted by domestic and transnational terrorist groups for many
years.  The  U.S.  State  Department  warns  U.S.  citizens  to  reconsider  travel  to  the
Philippines due to the presence of terrorism, crime, civil unrest, and rampant kidnappings.
There  are  significant  human  rights  abuses  with  respect  to  detainees  and  personal
freedoms. (Item 8)
In  response  to  SOR  ¶  2.a,  Applicant  admitted  that  his  wife,  two  children,  his
stepchild, father-in-law, and mother-in-law are citizens and residents of the Philippines.
In his July 2020 SCA, he reported that  the last time he saw his family was in January
2020 when he visited them. He sees his in-laws whenever he visits his children. He said
his family does not have connections to the Philippines’ government or military. (Item 2
at 6-7, 31-39) During his interview in February 2021, he reported that he visited his family
in  the  Philippines  from  November  2018  to  March  2019,  and  in  September  2019  for
fourteen days. He also traveled there in 2015 to see his former spouse, Wife 2. (Item 3 at
7)
During  his  February  2021  interview,  Applicant  stated  that  he  and  his  current
spouse, Wife 3, own a residence in the Philippines, which his wife purchased in 2019.
The property has a value of about US $3,000. His relatives are aware of their ownership
of the property. (Item 3 at 6) In his Answer to SOR ¶  2.b, Applicant denied owning the
property, but offered no explanation for his denial.
During his February 2021 interview, Applicant admitted that since November 2020,
he had been having an affair with a woman who is a Moroccan citizen. He said that he
had daily contact with her since then. He was living in South Korea at the time. (Item 3 at
7)
In his Answer to SOR ¶ 2.c, which alleged that he failed to report that affair to his
employer, Applicant admitted that he did not report it because he was starting to divorce
Wife 3. He did not think his wife was aware of his infidelity. (Item 3 at 7)
In his Answer to SOR ¶ 2.d, which alleged that Applicant had been conducting an
extramarital affair with a foreign person since November 2020, while residing outside of
the United States, Applicant denied the allegation. He provided no information explaining
the discrepancy between his admission during his interview and his denial in his Answer.
Sexual Behavior
In SOR ¶ 3.a, the Government cross-alleged under this guideline the allegations
in SOR ¶ 2.c and SOR ¶ 2.d. Applicant admitted the allegation in SOR ¶ 2.c, and denied
the allegation in SOR ¶ 2.d, which is inconsistent with his previous admission.
Personal Conduct
In SOR ¶ 4.a, the Government cross-alleged under this guideline the allegations
in  SOR  ¶¶  1.m,  1.n,  2.c,  and  2.d.  As  noted  above,  Applicant  admitted  all  allegations,
except SOR ¶ 2.d, to which he gave an answer inconsistent with a previous admission,
and without an explanation.
",False
"Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.c,  and  she  denied  SOR  ¶¶  2.a-2.k.  She  is  34
years  old,  married,  and  has  three  minor  children.  She  was  born  in  Russia  and
immigrated to the United States in 2008, at age 18, with her mother. She was educated
in the United States, earning an associate degree in 2012, a bachelor’s degree in 2014,
and  a  Master  of  Business  Administration  degree  in  2018.  She  has  worked  in  financial
management for her employer, a DOD contractor, since April 2019. She has never held
a security clearance. (Items 1-2, 4, 15)
Applicant  is  a  dual  citizen  of  Russia  and  the  United  States.  She  became  a
naturalized  U.S.  citizen  in  March  2014.  She  was  issued  a  Russian  passport  in
December 2018, and it is not scheduled to expire until December 2023. She was issued
a  U.S.  passport  in  July  2020,  and  it  is  not  scheduled  to  expire  until  July  2030.  Her
spouse, born in Mexico, is a citizen of Mexico and a permanent resident of the United
States.  Their  three  children  are  native-born  U.S.  citizens  residing  with  them.  She  and
her spouse purchased their first home in the United States in February 2017. They sold
it  in  July  2019  and  purchased  their  current  home.  She  does  not  have  any  financial
interests in Russia. (Items 2, 4, 15)
Applicant’s father is a citizen and resident of Russia, and she provided him with
quarterly financial support as of the date of the SOR. (SOR ¶ 1.a) Her stepmother and
three  half-sisters  are  also  citizens  and  residents  of  Russia.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.b-1.c)  Her  59-
year-old  father  is  a  factory  worker,  and  her  40-year-old  stepmother  does  not  work
outside  of  the  home.  Two  of  her  half-sisters,  ages  11  and  9,  are  students,  and  her
youngest  half-sister  is  4  years  old.  She  has  weekly  telephonic  and  electronic  contact
with her father and stepmother and monthly electronic contact with her half-sisters. She
saw her family in Russia when she traveled there in 2008, 2009, and 2011. Her father
and stepmother are aware that she is seeking a national security position. (Items 2, 4,
15)
Applicant  used  Western  Union  to  send  her  father  $3,500  between  2020  and
2021, so that he could financially support his family. She stated in her Answer that she
previously sent her father quarterly financial support, and money for birthdays, holidays,
and  other  special  occasions.  She  stated  that  she  no  longer  sends  him  money,  as  he
supports  himself  with  his  job  and  his  pension,  their  communication  decreased,  and
Western Union services are lacking. She also stated that her father “doesn’t fully know
about my employment or exact company name that I work for.” (Items 2, 4, 15)
Although not alleged in the SOR, Applicant’s 60-year-old mother, born in Russia,
is a dual citizen of Russia and the United States, residing in the United States. She was
married to a native-born U.S. citizen, Applicant’s stepfather, who is recently deceased.
She has never worked in the United States. Applicant has daily to weekly in-person and
telephonic  contact  with  her  mother.  While  in  Russia  in  2017,  Applicant’s  mother
renewed her Russian passport, and it is not scheduled to expire until 2027. Applicant’s
mother  also  had  yearly  contact  with  the  Russian  consulate  in  the  United  States  from
2017  to  2020,  concerning  her  request  that  she  receive  her  pension  from  the  Russian
government in the United States. Applicant’s mother is aware that Applicant is seeking a
national security position. (Items 4, 15)
The SOR also alleged that Applicant had six delinquent consumer debts totaling
$24,212  (SOR  ¶¶  2.a-2.f),  and  five  delinquent  medical  debts  totaling  $1,463  (SOR  ¶¶
2.g-2.k). She listed her delinquent debts in her July 2021 security clearance application
(SCA),  and  she  discussed  them  during  her  August  2021  interview  with  a  background
investigator.  The  debts  in  SOR  ¶¶  2.a  through  2.j  are  reported  on  the  August  2021
credit  bureau  report  (CBR),  and  all  the  SOR  debts  are  reported  on  the  March  2022
CBR.  An  incident  report  regarding  Applicant’s  self-reported  debts  was  filed  in  the
Defense  Information  System  for  Security  (DISS)  in  June  2022,  before  the  SOR  was
issued, and the report reflected that she provided payoff letters for five unalleged debts.
She stated in her Answer that she settled and resolved all the SOR debts in June and
July  2022.  She  provided  documentation  reflecting  that  she  paid  SOR  ¶¶  2.a,  2.b,  2.d,
2.e,  and  2.f  in  June  2022.  None  of  the  SOR  debts  are  reported  on  the  October  2022
credit bureau report. (Items 2, 4-15)
Applicant  attributed  her  delinquent  debts  to  their  home  purchase  in  July  2019,
which  proved  to  be  more  expensive  than  they  originally  budgeted.  In  addition,  her
spouse experienced a reduction in hours at work, at a date not in the record, and they
incurred legal expenses related to his April 2020 charge for driving under the influence.
She also cited to the following circumstances that occurred in the several years prior to
her Answer:
I  didn’t   have   the   money  to   pay  them   on   time   due   to   some   medical
reasons,   financial  issues  due   to   my  pregnancies,   low[-]income   jobs,  high
deductible  insurance  plans with  high  co-pays  plans, mortgage, COVID-19
pandemic, and  other family circumstances that prevented  me  from  paying.
(Items 2, 4, 15)
Applicant  indicated  in  her  August  2021  background  interview  that  she  earned
$72,000  annually,  and  her  spouse  earned  $83,000  annually.  They  worked  closely
together to address their expenses, and she does not have any other delinquent debts.
There is no evidence in the record that she received credit counseling. Two individuals,
one of whom is a friend of a decade, and the other a former co-worker, attested to her
trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment. (Items 2, 15)
Russia
Russia  has  a  highly  centralized,  authoritarian  political  system  dominated  by
President Vladimir Putin. The bicameral federal assembly lacks independence from the
executive.  The  2018  presidential  election  and  the  2021  lower-house  elections  were
marked  by  accusations  of  government  interference  and  manipulation  of  the  electoral
process.  A  July  2020  referendum  on  constitutional  amendments  did  not  meet
internationally recognized standards, and the new constitutional amendments  provide
President Putin the opportunity to remain in power until 2036.
The  U.S.  Government  has  escalated  sanctions  on  Russia  since  2014,  in
response  to  Russia’s  incursions  into  Ukraine,  cyberattacks,  malign  influence,  use  of
chemical  weapons,  and  election  meddling.  In  its  February  2022  Annual  Threat
Assessment,  the  Office  of  the  Director  of  National  Intelligence  (ODNI)  reported  that
Russia presents one of the most serious foreign influence threats to the United States,
using its intelligence services, proxies, and wide-ranging influence tools to try to divide
Western  alliances  and  increase  its  sway  around  the  world,  while  attempting  to
undermine  U.S.  global  standing,  amplify  discord  inside  the  United  States,  and
influence  U.S.  voters  and  decision  making.  ODNI  also  assessed  that  Russia  will
remain a top cyber threat as it refines and employs its espionage, influence, and attack
capabilities.
In July 2018, the National Counterintelligence and Security Center reported that
besides  cyberspace,  other  methods  of  collecting  sensitive  U.S.  technologies  include
use  of  Russian  commercial  and  academic  enterprises  that  interact  with  the  West;
recruitment  of  Russian  immigrants  with  advanced  technical  skills  by  the  Russian
intelligence  services;  and  Russian  intelligence  penetration  of  public  and  private
enterprises.  Under  Russian  law,  the  Federal  Security  Service  (FSB)  can  compel
Russian  firms  doing  business  in  the  United  States,  or  Russians  working  with  U.S.
firms,  to  comply  with  FSB  information  sharing  and  operational  mandates,  presenting
additional routes for cyber espionage.
The   U.S.  Department   of  State   issued   a   Level  4   travel  advisory  for  Russia,
advising   U.S.  persons  not  to   travel  to   Russia  due   to   unprovoked   and   unjustified
invasion   of  Ukraine   by  Russian   military  forces;  the   potential  for  harassment   against
U.S. citizens by Russian  government security officials;  the  singling  out of U.S. citizens
in Russia by Russian government security officials, including for detention;  the arbitrary
enforcement   of   local  law;   limited   flights   into   and   out   of  Russia;   the   U.S.   Embassy’s
limited  ability to  assist U.S. citizens in Russia; COVID-19  and  related  entry restrictions;
and  terrorism. U.S. citizens residing  or traveling in Russia should depart immediately.
U.S.  citizens,  including  former  and  current  U.S.  Government  and  military
personnel  and  private  citizens  engaged  in  business,  who  are  visiting  or  residing  in
Russia have been interrogated without cause and threatened by Russian officials, and
may become victims of harassment, mistreatment, and extortion. All U.S. Government
personnel  should  carefully  consider  their  need  to  travel  to  Russia.  Russian  security
services have arrested U.S. citizens on spurious  charges, singled out U.S. citizens in
Russia  for  detention  and/or  harassment,  denied  them  fair  and  transparent  treatment,
and  convicted  them  in  secret  trials  and/or  without  presenting  credible  evidence.
Russian  officials  may  unreasonably  delay  U.S.  consular  assistance  to  detained  U.S.
citizens.  Russia  enforces  special  restrictions  on  dual  U.S-Russian  nationals  and  may
refuse  to  acknowledge  dual  nationals’  U.S.  citizenship,  deny  their  access  to  U.S.
consular assistance, prevent their departure from Russia, and conscript dual nationals
for military service.
Russia has used counterterrorism and  “extremism” as pretexts to suppress the
exercise  of  human  rights,  or  for  other  objectives  in  both  domestic  and  foreign  policy.
The  formal  counterterrorism  dialogue  framework  between  the  United  States  and
Russia  remained  on  hold  because  of  public,  unfounded  statements  by  Russian
security officials alleging U.S. support for ISIS.
In  its  2020  Human  Rights  Report,  the  U.S.  Department  of  State  reported  that
significant human rights issues in Russia included: extrajudicial killings and attempted
extrajudicial  killings;  enforced  disappearances;  pervasive  torture  by  law  enforcement
officers;  harsh  and  life-threatening  conditions  prisons;  arbitrary  arrest  and  detention;
political  and  religious  prisoners  and  detainees;  politically  motivated  reprisals  against
individuals  located  outside  the  country;  severe  arbitrary  interference  with  privacy;
severe suppression of freedom of expression and media; violence against journalists;
blacking  and  filtering  of  internet  content  and  banning  of  online  anonymity;  severe
suppression  of  the  right  of  peaceful  assembly  and  freedom  of  association;  severe
restrictions of religious freedom; refoulement of refugees; inability of citizens to change
their  government  peacefully  through  free  and  fair  elections;  severe  limits  on
participation  in  the  political  process;  widespread  corruption  at  all  levels  and  in  all
branches of government; lack of investigation of and accountability for violence against
women;  coerced  abortion  and  forced  sterilization;  trafficking  in  persons;  and  crimes
involving violence or threats of violence  against persons with disabilities, members of
ethnic  minorities,  and  lesbian,  gay,  bisexual,  transgender,  and  intersex  persons.  The
government failed to take adequate steps to identify, investigate, prosecute, or punish
most officials who committed abuses, resulting in a climate of impunity.
In March 2022, President Putin signed into law a bill criminalizing the spread of
information  in  Russia  that  authorities  deem  as  “false  information”  that  contradicts  the
Russian  narrative  of  its  military  actions  in  Ukraine.  The  Russian  government
censorship agency blocked access to social media platforms, and restricted access in
Russia  to  international  news  outlets.  In  September  2022,  the  Russian  government
began  a  mobilization  of  its  citizens  to  the  armed  forces  in  support  of  its  invasion  of
Ukraine.

"Applicant is 52 years old. He was born in Israel on the West Bank, and was not a
citizen of Israel, but was at the time considered a citizen of Jordan. He immigrated to the
United States in 1989 to attend college.  In 1997, he married his ex-wife  in Israel, they
separated in 2015, and their divorce was finalized in 2017. She was born in Canada to
American citizens and is a dual citizen of both countries. They have two sons, who are
10 and 11 years old. They were both born in Qatar but are American citizens. In 1996, he
received a Bachelor of Science in electrical engineering from a U.S. university. This is his
first  application  for  a  security  clearance;  however,  in  2007,  he  underwent  a  National
Agency  Check  with  Inquiries  (NACI).  At  the  time  of  the  hearing,  Applicant  was  not
employed, but he was sponsored by a company who intends to hire him as a translator.
(Tr. 12, 20-21; GE 1-3)
After the  September 11th  attacks,  Applicant and  his  ex-wife  moved  to  Jordan  to  live
with  his family for approximately one  year  due  to  fears of anti-Muslim  retaliation. They
then  moved  to  Qatar for her work. While  living  in Qatar, his wife  was the  primary wage-
earner for their  family.  He  became  a  naturalized  U.S. citizen  in 2003, as a  result of his
marriage   to   his  ex-wife.  Between   2007   and   January  2015,   he  worked   for  defense
contractors  as  a  security escort  and  then  as  a  security  manager  at  an  Air  Force  base,
which required him to  hold a NACI. (Tr. 22-30, 38, 56-57, 68-69, 81; GE  1-4)
According to Applicant’s  divorce paperwork, he and his wife separated in March
2016,  when  he  left  Qatar.  He  testified  that  he  went  to  Jordan  to  receive  financial
assistance  from  his  family.  His  father  gifted  him  a  piece  of  property  in  Jordan  worth
approximately $200,000, which he sold, and used, in part, to pay for his divorce attorneys.
He  then  returned  to  the  United  States  to  start  the  divorce  proceedings.  He  was
unemployed from January 2015 to July 2016. (Tr. 22-30, 38, 56-57, 68-69, 81; GE 1-4)
As noted above, Applicant’s wife is a dual citizen of the United States and Canada,
and  when  she  left  Qatar,  she  filed  for  divorce  in  Canada.  Based  upon  the
recommendations of Applicant’s attorney, he found a job in State A in July 2016, rented
a two-bedroom apartment there, and purchased a vehicle. Between his March 2016 and
July  2016,  he  supported  himself  with  the  money  left  over  from  selling  the  Jordanian
property gifted to him from his father. As stated above, Applicant has been unemployed
since January 2017. In October 2017, he returned to Jordan to reside with his father, who
currently provides him approximately $2,500 a month to pay his expenses. (Tr. 29-37; GE
1-4)
Applicant has not resided in the United States since October 2017. He returned to
the U.S. one time, in 2019, to be interviewed for his security clearance. (He listed on the
2019 SCA his sister’s address in State  B  as his permanent address, but he has never
resided there.) For his SCA he provided his sister’s address in State B as his permanent
address, but he has never resided there. He resided in Jordan with his father from October
2017 to January 2021. He then moved to Israel with his father, where he lived as of the
hearing date. His father has continued to financially support him since 2017. Applicant
does not have a bank account or a credit card,  and when he needs money, his father
gives him cash. (Tr. 38-41; GE 1; GE 3)
In Applicant’s 2019 SCA, he disclosed the following visits to his family in Jordan
during the previous seven years: 3/12-4/12; 6/13; 5/14-6/14; 7/15; 1/16; 3/16; and 6/16.
During  Applicant’s  May  2019  interview,  the  government  investigator  reviewed  his  U.S.
passport (valid from October 2008 to October 2018) and noted the following stamps from
Jordan: 10/09; 6/10; 7/10; 9/10; 11/10; 3/11; 6/11; 7/11; 11/11; 12/11; 6/13; 3/16; 4/16;
5/16; and 10/17. (GE 1; GE 3)
When  Applicant  completed  his  2019  SCA,  he  anticipated  he  would  inherit
$1,000,000 in assets from his father’s estate in Jordan and Israel. At one time his father
owned the only insurance company in Israel and owned an extensive real estate portfolio.
“I know my dad is rich, but my dad is secretive. [H]e likes to help his kids,
but  he  doesn’t mention  what he’s got.  [W]hen I went to Jordan, I realized
he’s richer than what I thought. And when I came to Israel I  … now know
he’s … richer than what I thought in Jordan even.”
At  the  time  of  the  hearing,  Applicant  estimated  he  would  inherit  assets  in  Jordan  and
Israel worth approximately $1.5 million. (Tr. 42-43; GE 3)
When Applicant was born in Israel, he was issued a Jordanian passport. Because
he was born on the West Bank in Israel and he is not Jewish, he cannot be a citizen of
Israel. His Jordanian passport or travel document (he has made inconsistent statements
regarding the document) expired in 2018. His Israel identification card does not have an
expiration  date.  He  cannot  live  in  Israel  without  it,  and  he  must  show  it  with  his  U.S.
passport when he enters and exits Israel. (Tr. 44-46, 72-74; GE 1; GE 3)
Applicant’s  parents,  brother,  and  sisters  reside  in  both  Jordan  and  Israel.  His
parents own land in both countries, and his brother lives in part of their parents’ home in
Israel.  Their homes  in the  two  countries  are approximately one  hour apart.  Two of  his
sisters  reside  in  Jordan  and  Israel.  None  of  his  family  members  work  for  either  the
Jordanian or the Israeli governments. (Tr. 48-54, 72)
At the  hearing, Applicant denied  having  close  ties to  his family residing  in Jordan
and   Israel,  including   his  parents  who   provide   him   complete   financial   support  and   with
whom  he  resides.  However, due  to  living  with  his parents,  he  does speak to  his siblings
when   they   call   his  parents,   and   his  brother  resides  in   the   same   building.   Additionally,
Applicant  provides hourly care to  his father and  is essentially his caretaker.  “I’m  by myself
24/7  except my dad. I’m  helping  my dad. I don’t go  anywhere. I don’t go  out.  I don’t talk
to anybody because  the place is dangerous anyways.” He  testified that  he has  no ties or
affection  to  Jordan  and  Israel  and  his allegiance  is to  the  United  States. (Tr. 55-56, 60-
62, 75)
Applicant has one sister who resides in the United States with her family; however,
she  also  owns  property  in  Israel.  He  has  an  uncle  and  cousins  who  live  in  the  United
States. His sons are U.S. citizens, but he does not know where they are currently residing.
According to Applicant, they could be living in the U.S, Canada, or Australia. He does not
pay his ex-wife child support, and the last time he saw his sons was in 2015. According
to their 2016 divorce paperwork, his children were residing in Canada  at that time. His
only asset in the U.S. is a bank account with a $100 balance. (Tr. 58, 61, 65-68; GE 4)
Jordan
Jordan  is  a  nation  in  the  Middle  East,  and  it  is  governed  by  a  constitutional
monarchy ruled by a king who has ultimate executive and legislative authority. The United
States has a long history of cooperation and friendship with Jordan and appreciates the
leadership role Jordan plays in advancing peace and moderation in the region.
Jordan remains at high risk for terrorism. Local, regional, and transnational groups
and extremists have demonstrated a willingness and capacity to plan and execute attacks
in  Jordan.  The  current  travel  advisory  from  the  U.S.  State  Department  is  Level  3  –
reconsider travel due to COVID-19. The U.S. involvement in Iraq and Syria and the U.S.
government’s  policies  regarding  Israel  led  more  than  80%  of  Jordanians  to  hold  an
unfavorable opinion of the U.S. government, although the anti-Western sentiment did not
extend  to  U.S.  citizens  or  culture  generally.  Significant  human  rights  issues  occur  in
Jordan as well.
Israel
Israel  is  a   nation   in   the   Middle   East,   and   it   is  governed   by   a   multiparty
parliamentary democracy.  Israel and  the  United  States have  historically strong  bilateral
relations and ties, including cooperation  on defense  and security matters. With  that said,
U.S. officials remain concerned about the potential for Israeli espionage.
There is a significant level of terrorism threat directed at or affecting official U.S.
Government interests in Israel. Numerous terrorist attacks or incidents involving foreign
terrorist organizations have occurred over the last several years.
The State Department advises not to travel to Israel due to COVID-19; and it warns
to exercise increased caution due to terrorism and civil unrest. Additionally, all persons
entering  and  departing  Israel,  the  West  Bank,  Gaza  are  subject  to  immigration  and
security screening, which may include search of their personal devices and data.

"In  Applicant’s  answer,  he  admitted  some  of  the  Guideline  G  allegations  in  the
SOR  and  denied  others.  He  failed  to  either admit  or  deny  the  Guideline  J  allegations.
Since the underlying allegations are the same under both Guidelines, he is deemed to
have  admitted  and  denied  the  same  allegations  under  Guideline  J  as  he  did  for
Guideline G. He admitted the Guideline B allegation, with explanations. His admissions
are  adopted  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  testimony,
pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  63  years  old.  He  is  divorced  and  has  two  adult  children.  He  is
currently  employed  by  a  government  contractor.  He  has  worked  for  different
government  or  defense  contractors  as  a  power  plant  technician  on  various  contracts
over the years, dating back to 2010.  Many of these contracts required his presence in
combat  zones,  such  as  Iraq  and  Afghanistan.  He  was  honorably  discharged  from  the
Marine  Corps  after  serving  from  1979  to  1985.  He  has  three  associate’s  degrees.  He
held a security clearance while in the Marine Corps and at various times  while serving
as a government-contractor employee. (Tr. 7, 32-34, 39, 41; GE 1; AE A)
The SOR alleged Applicant was charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI) on
eight  occasions:  May 1986;  January 1989; April 1990;  April 1993;  January  2000; April
2001;  February  2002;  and  November  2019.  (SOR  ¶¶  1.a-1.h)  Department  Counsel
moved to withdraw the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.c, 1.e, and 1.f. That motion was granted
and  those  withdrawals  will  be  reflected  in  my  formal  findings.  This  conduct  was  also
alleged as criminal conduct under Guideline J in the SOR. (SOR ¶ 2.a) Finally, the SOR
alleged that Applicant had a girlfriend who is a resident and citizen of Ethiopia, and for
whom he provided financial support. (SOR ¶ 3.a)
Applicant began drinking alcohol approximately two  times a week when he was
18 or 19 years old after he joined the Marine Corps. In his early 20s to 30s, his alcohol
consumption  increased  to  about  three  to  four  times  a  week.  He  stated  that  during  the
last 10 to 15 years, his alcohol consumption has decreased. He admitted that he would
often drink and become  “buzzed.”  He would drive while  he was ‘buzzed.”  He admitted
driving while drunk more times than when he was arrested. He claimed that he did not
drink  to  intoxication  between  2002  and  2019.  He  also  claimed  the  last  time  he  drank
alcohol was when he was arrested for DWI in November 2019. (Tr. 43-50)
The details of his arrests follow:
May  1986  DWI  (SOR  ¶  1.a)-Applicant  testified  that  he  and  friends  were  at  the
beach where he  had four to five beers. He  drove back home from the beach and was
stopped by law enforcement  for a traffic violation. He admitted this arrest  for DWI and
he  claimed  the  charge  was  later  reduced  to  reckless  driving.  He  was  drinking  alcohol
about four times a week at that time in his life. (Tr. 51-52; GE 3-4; SOR answer)
January  1989  DWI  (SOR  ¶  1.b)-Applicant  testified  that  he  had  been  at  a party
until  about  4:00  am  and  then  drove  home.  He  was  stopped  by  law  enforcement  for
speeding  and  weaving.  He  was  administered  field  sobriety  tests,  which  he  failed.  He
was  arrested  for  DWI  and  refused  to  take  a  breath  test.  Applicant  admitted  pleading
guilty to a misdemeanor DWI and was sentenced to two years’ probation and fined. (Tr.
53-54; GE 3-5 (pp. 6-7); SOR answer)
April  1993  DWI  (SOR  ¶  1.d)-Applicant  denied  this  arrest  in  his  answer  but
admitted  it  during  his  hearing  testimony.  Applicant  was  stopped  by  law  enforcement
after nearly colliding with a police vehicle when entering a service road. Applicant was
observed  by officers to  stagger,  lean on his  vehicle  for  support,  wobble  while  walking,
exhibit  slow  depressed  reflexes,  and  have  “thick”  speech.  Applicant  also  became
belligerent toward the responding officers, which resulted in him being handcuffed. After
transportation  to  the  station,  Applicant  was  administered  field  sobriety  tests.  He
admitted drinking two beers at home. A breath test determined his blood alcohol content
at 0.11, over the legal limit of 0.08. All Applicant’s actions at the police station related to
this arrest were videotaped. He was arrested for DWI. He pleaded not guilty in court but
was convicted of a DWI first offense in September 1993 and received a sentence of two
years’ probation and a fine. (Tr. 59-65; GE 5 (pp.- 1-3); SOR answer)
February 2002  DWI  (SOR  ¶  1.g)-Applicant denied  this arrest  in his  answer  but
admitted it during his hearing testimony. He did not recall the details of this arrest. Court
documents reveal that he pleaded guilty and was convicted of DWI in September 2002.
(Tr. 71-72; GE 3 (pp. 10-11); SOR answer)
November  2019   DWI  (SOR  ¶  1.h)-Applicant   admitted   this  arrest  in   both  his
answer  and   his  hearing   testimony.  Applicant  testified   that  he   had   just   returned   from
Afghanistan   and   went   to   a   sports   bar  where   he   had   one   beer.  In   his  SOR  answer   he
admitted  drinking  two  beers. He  was arrested  and  changed  with  DWI-3rd, a  third  degree
felony.   No  police   reports  or  court   disposition   documents  are   in  the   record.  Applicant
claimed   he   pleaded   guilty  to   a   misdemeanor  DWI  charge   and   received   a   sentence   of
probation.  Applicant  presented   documentation   from   his  probation   officer  that  he
complied  with  all  the  conditions of his probation, had  no  probation  violations, and  paid
all   of  his  financial  obligations.  His  probation   terminated   with   him   in   good   standing   in
June  2022. (Tr.  72-76;  GE 3  (p 12); SOR Answer; AE B, E)
Applicant listed in his 2020 security clearance application (SCA) attending court-
ordered alcohol counseling in 1990 and 2001, but he did not supply any documentation
about  either  program  or  detail  what  was  involved  with  these  programs,  in  terms  of
diagnoses, prognoses, or treatment plans. (GE 1)
Applicant  testified  that  he  does  not  consider  himself  an  alcoholic,  rather  he  is
“just a person that had bad luck.” He claims to attend Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) about
once a month, but he admitted that he does not have sponsor, nor does he work the AA
12-step  program  recommended  for  recovering  alcoholics.  He  also  claims  he  has  no
further interest in consuming alcohol. As an example, he cited that he recently attended
a family gathering where alcohol was present, but he did not consume any. (Tr. 78-81,
90)
The Guideline B allegation concerns Applicant’s relationship with a woman who
is a citizen and resident of Ethiopia. He admitted having a relationship with this woman
and providing her financial support. He was in contact with her from approximately 2017
to  2019.  He  met  her  when  he  was  in  Ethiopia,  and  she  was  a  receptionist  at  a  hotel.
From 2017  to 2019, he  provided her with approximately $1,000 per month to help  her
and her family. During this time, he was in contact with her on a weekly basis. He visited
her in Ethiopia on several occasions. The last time he was in Ethiopia was in 2019. He
ended  his  relationship  with  this  woman  in  approximately  June  2019,  when  he  came
back to the United States after his job in  Southwest Asia ended. The last contact with
her  was  in  June 2019. The  last  financial support he provided  was  in  August  2019. He
has  no  intentions  of  contacting  her,  seeing  her,  or  providing  any  additional  financial
assistance to her in the future. (Tr. 81-88)
Applicant  presented  six  character  letters  from  friends  and  colleagues.  They
describe  Applicant  as  responsible  and  someone  who  is  dedicated,  hard-working,  and
who  has  high  character.  Several  recommend  continuation  of  his  security  clearance.
Applicant  also  presented  several  awards,  certificates,  and  pictures  demonstrating  his
service to the country over the years. (AE C-D)

"Applicant  admitted  to  all  the  allegations  in  SOR.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  36-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  was  born  in
Saudi  Arabia  to  Pakistani  nationals.  Applicant  has  been  employed  with  the  defense
contractor since March 2019. He is married to an American citizen and has no children.
(GX 1 at pages 5, 14 and 28~29.)  Applicant came to the United States in about 2014,
and obtained a Master’s Degree from an American university. (TR at page 15 line 7 to
page 17 line 3.)
Guideline B - Foreign Influence
1.a.  Applicant’s  mother  and  father  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Pakistan.  His
mother’s family lives in the United States, and she “has a Green Card.” She has “always
been a housewife.”  Applicant’s father has an open visa for entry to the United States.
He’s  a  retired 75-year-old  “Human  Resources  Manager.”  He worked  for a  government
agency  for  about  “two  years  before  he  retired.  Before  that,  Applicant’s  father  was  a
banker, and before that he worked for “a construction company.” (TR at page 17 line 6
to page 19 line 11.)
1.b. Applicant’s “much older” brother is a citizen and resident of Pakistan. He is a
Lieutenant Colonel in the Infantry. Their contact is limited to about once a year. (TR at
page 19 line 20 to page 20 line 23, and Answer at pages 6~7.)
1.c.   Applicant  has  two  other  brothers  and  one  sister  who  are  citizens  and
residents of Pakistan. One brother “works in real-estate,” and the other is unemployed.
His sister “is a homemaker.”  TR at page 20 line 24 to page 22 line 21.)  Applicant has
little contact with his brothers. (Answer.)
1.d.  Applicant  has  two  sisters  who  are  citizens  of  Pakistan  but  reside  in  Abu
Dhabi. They are both schoolteachers.  (TR at page 22 line 22 to 23 line 13.) Applicant
has little contact with his sisters. (Answer at page 7.)
1.e.~1.g.  In  an  “abundance  of  caution,”  Applicant  listed  six  cousins  on  his
security  clearance  application  (e-QIP), who  are  all  citizens  of  Pakistan,  but  two  reside
outside of Pakistan, one in the United Arab Emirates, and the other in Qatar. Applicant
has little or no contact with his cousins.  (TR at page  25 line 9 to page 35 line 20, and
Answer at pages 7~8.)
Notice
I take administrative notice of the following facts regarding Pakistan: Pakistan is
an Islamic Republic. The Department of State has assessed parts of the country to be
MEDIUM  or  HIGH-threat  locations.  During  2021,  there  was  a  lack  of  government
accountability, and abuses, including corruption, that often went unpunished, fostering a
culture of impunity among perpetrators, whether official or unofficial.

"Under Guideline B, the SOR alleged that Applicant’s parents (SOR 1.a) and two
brothers (SOR 1.b) are citizens and residents of Iraq. It also alleged that his sister is a
citizen and resident of Iraq who is employed by the Iraqi government (SOR 1.c). It was
further alleged that Applicant’s father-in-law is a citizen and resident of Iraq (SOR 1.d);
that  Applicant’s  two  children  are  citizens  of  Iraq  (SOR  1.e);  and  that  Applicant  owns
residential property in Iraq (SOR 1.f). (FORM, Item 1)
In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted with explanations and comment all of
the SOR allegations. (FORM, Item 2) In addition to the facts established by Applicant’s
admissions, and based on my review of the information presented in the FORM, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  41-year-old  employee  of  a  federal  contractor,  for  whom  he  has
worked since July 2021. He was born and raised in Iraq, where he completed his college
education  in  June  2004.  He  and  his  wife,  who  also  was  born  and  raised  in  Iraq,  were
married in July 2006. They have two children, ages 15 and 10. Applicant, his wife, and
their children are naturalized U.S. citizens. They have lived together in the United States
since immigrating from Iraq in 2014. SOR 1.e alleges that his children are Iraqi citizens.
(FORM, Item 3; RTF)
Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in July 2020. In his e-QIP, he did not
provide naturalization information about his wife and children. In response to the FORM,
he  provided  copies of their U.S. passports that  were  issued  in August  and  September
2020,  respectively.  The  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant’s  children  are  Iraqi  citizens,
something he acknowledged may still be the case; however, it also is clear that they and
their  parents  are  U.S.  citizens  who  have  been  living  together  and  continuously  in  the
United States for over eight years. SOR 1.e is resolved for Applicant. (FORM, Items 3
and 4; RTF)
Between  April  2007  and  November  2014,  Applicant  worked  for  an  Iraqi  bank.
Starting in 2008, he was vetted for work at the bank’s branch inside the U.S. Embassy in
Baghdad’s Green  Zone.  Applicant disclosed in his e-QIP that he was investigated and
approved for access to the embassy. He also provided copies of U.S. government-issued
identification cards he used for access to the Green Zone and the embassy itself. In June
2011, the embassy’s Senior Financial Management Officer provided a memorandum in
which he roundly praised Applicant’s work as a point of contact between his staff and the
Iraqi  bank  in  the  conduct  of  essential  financial  transactions  and  in  working  with  Iraqi
vendors  in  support  of  U.S.  military  requirements  in  Iraq.  Applicant  left  his  embassy
position  (it  appears  he  remained  with  the  bank  until  2014)  that  same  month  after  the
contract  between  the  bank  and  the  U.S.  Department  of  State  was  modified.  When
Applicant left the embassy, the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq presented him with a certificate
of appreciation for his dedication to and support of the U.S. mission in Iraq. (FORM, Item
3; RTF)
Applicant  immigrated to  the  United States on  what  Department Counsel termed
“an unspecified visa” and “received Government financial support for refugees.” (FORM
at 2-3.) In response to the FORM, Applicant stated that he “came to the U.S. through the
IOM program due to my job as a contractor with the U.S. government.” (RTF) The IOM
program
for  Migration
(https://mena.iom.int/iraq), a non-governmental organization (NGO) whose mission is to
assist persons who must relocate after being displaced by conflict. It is likely that Applicant

immigration to the United States.

After  he  arrived  in  the  United  States,  and  after  a  three-month  period  of
unemployment, Applicant started working in the computer and information technology (IT)
industry. From February 2015 to the present, he has been steadily employed in such jobs.
In addition to his full-time jobs, between May 2015 and February 2019, he supplemented
his income by working part-time in ridesharing jobs. In 2016, Applicant bought the house
in  the  Unites  States  where  he  and  his  family  still  live.  All  of  his  personal,  community,
professional,  and  financial  interests  are  in  the  neighborhood  where  he  is  raising  his
children. (FORM, Items 2 - 4; RTF)
Applicant’s parents,  two  brothers, a  sister, and  his father-in-law reside  in Iraq  as
Iraqi  citizens.  His  father  is  a   retired   government  employee,  and   his  mother  has  never
worked  outside  the  home.  Applicant speaks with  them  as often  as daily. His sister is an
employee  of  an  Iraqi  government agency. He speaks with  her monthly or in person  during
visits  to   see   his   parents  (Applicant   has   traveled   to   Iraq   in  2016   and   2021).    Applicant
averred   that  his  sister’s  work  does  not  relate   to   any  military,  security,   intelligence,  or
foreign  relations interests by the  Iraqi government.  Applicant’s brothers and  his father-in-
law,  who   is  a   physician,  have   no   apparent   connection   to   the   Iraqi  government.   One
brother  works for a  trade  association,  the  other a  car dealer.  The  record does  not reflect
what level of contact  Applicant has with  his brothers or with  his father-in-law, either directly
or through  his wife.  Applicant  averred  that none  of  his  relatives  in  Iraq  know  that he  is
applying  for a  security clearance. They only know that he  works in the  IT field.  (FORM,
Items 2  –  4; RTF)
Prior to  his departure  from  Iraq  in  2014, Applicant started  building  a  new house  for
his family; however,  it was not completed  until  2017. Applicant’s parents moved  into  the
house   because   theirs  had   been   demolished,   and   they  needed   a   place   to   live   pending
completion of construction  of a new house. Applicant’s parents and  his brothers now live
in the  house. Applicant  wants to  bring  his parents to  live  in the  U.S. with  him. To  that end,
his house  in  Iraq  is now on  the  market. Applicant does  not receive rent for the  house  and
there is no indication in this record about its value.  (FORM, Items 2  –  4; RTF)
To properly assess the security significance of these facts within the adjudicative
guideline at  issue, I have taken administrative  notice of certain  facts  regarding Iraq as
presented  in  HX  1.  Iraq  is  a  constitutional  republic,  and  its  most  recent  parliamentary
elections in 2021 were assessed by European Union and United Nations observers to be
free  and  fair.  Nonetheless,  as  to  Iraq  in  general,  concerns  remain  over  the  continued
inability of that freely-elected government to quell the violence and instability that persist
in some parts of that country. These conditions are  fueled and perpetrated by  terrorist
groups  affiliated  with  Al-Qaeda  and  ISIS,  as  well  as  by  Sunni  insurgents  and  Iranian-
backed Shiite militias. As a result, some parts of Iraq, mainly in areas south of Baghdad,
such  as  Basrah,  remain  wholly  unstable.  Even  the  city  of  Baghdad  is  still  subject  to
random acts of terrorist violence. U.S. citizens and interests in Iraq remain at high risk for
kidnapping  and  terrorist  violence.  The  U.S.  State  Department  has  advised  against  all
individual travel to Iraq. The ability of the U.S. Embassy to provide consular services at
the U.S. consulate in Basrah is extremely limited given the security environment, while
the U.S. embassy in the IKR capital of Erbil remains open. While ISIS insurgent groups
remain active in Iraq, their control over large swaths of Iraq has been diminished by U.S.
and coalition efforts. Such groups regularly attack both Iraqi security forces and civilians.
Anti-U.S.  sectarian  militias  may  also  threaten  U.S.  citizens  and  western  companies
throughout  Iraq.  U.S.  Government  and  western  interests  remain  possible  targets  for
attacks.
Additionally,  there  are  significant  human-rights  problems  in  Iraq.  Widespread
corruption, as well as abuses by Iraqi security forces in response to acts of violence by
terrorists and others, have undermined confidence in the Iraqi central government and its
judiciary. Human-rights violations by Iraqi law enforcement are not uncommon and are
not  being  addressed  when  identified.  Those  include  killing,  kidnapping,  and  extorting
civilians, as well as inhumane conditions in detention and prison facilities, arbitrary arrest
and lengthy pretrial detainment, denial of fair public trial, limits on freedom of expression,
freedom of the press, censorship of  religion, limits on peaceful assembly, and societal
abuses of women. The various terrorist and militia organizations are also responsible for
significant human rights abuses in Iraq.
",True
"Applicant admitted all of the allegations contained in the SOR. His admissions are
incorporated into the findings of fact below.
Applicant is 42 years old. He married in 2011, and he has three children, ages 10,
8 and 5. He was born in Nigeria, and he immigrated to the United States in 2009, at the
age of 28. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2014, and his wife recently became a
naturalized U.S. citizen too. He does not consider himself to be a dual citizen of Nigeria
and  the  U.S.  because  he  renounced  his  Nigerian  citizenship  after  he  became  a  U.S.
citizen.  He  traveled  to  Nigeria  one  time  in  2018.  He  has  been  employed  by  a  federal
contractor since April 2015 as a database administrator. This is his first application for a
DOD security clearance. (Tr. 16-18; GE 1)
Personal Conduct
The SOR alleges that Applicant allowed multiple business entities and individuals
to  deposit  over  $500,000  into  his  U.S.  bank  account(s),  between  February  2015  and
September 2016. He did this at the request of his nephew, a dual citizen of Nigeria and
Norway (also referenced by Applicant as his “cousin” because they are about the same
age.) His nephew requested that Applicant transfer over $500,000 from his bank accounts
to his nephew and to persons unknown to Applicant, and to business entities in Nigeria.
(SOR ¶ 1.a.) Applicant admitted this allegation. (SOR response; Tr. 20-29, 62-65; GE 2)
During  Applicant’s  background  interview in  July 2019,  he  was  confronted by  an
authorized  DOD  investigator  about  his  unusual  financial  activities.  Applicant  explained
that  his  nephew  and  his  half-brother  told  Applicant  the  money  deposited  into  his  U.S.
bank accounts was going to be used to build renovations to the palace in his Nigerian
hometown. His nephew owned the construction company, and he would be managing the
construction work on the palace. His nephew wanted to deposit money into Applicant’s
bank  accounts  and  then  transfer  the  money  to  Nigeria  in  order  to  get  a  better  foreign
exchange rate. Applicant gave his nephew his personal financial bank account numbers
and  routing  numbers,  which  were  then  used  by  various  unknown  individuals  and/or
business entities. When Applicant’s bank accounts were closed by the U.S. banks due to
this disconcerting activity, Applicant questioned his nephew and asked him to be honest
about the money transfers. His nephew admitted that he had lied and there was never a
plan to renovate the palace; the money transfers were all for the purpose of buying and
selling money and exchanging foreign currency for profit. Applicant later learned that his
nephew  set  up  a  Nigerian  company,  not  for  the  purpose  of  construction,  but  for  the
business of buying and selling foreign currency. (SOR response; TR. 20-38, 62-65; SOR
response)
…my nephew sent the  money to  me  because  he’s going  to  get a  better rate,
transfer rate.  You know, the  exchange rate just in dollar. If you  get  dollar in
Nigeria, you  get a  better exchange  rate  compared  to  when  you  send  a  Great
Britain pound  to  Nigeria. So, the  better rate, the  dollars.  That was the  reason
why he  transferred  it  through  me  to  send  to  Nigeria, I thought at that time.
(Tr. 29)
Applicant admitted during cross examination that he does not have a license as a
foreign currency trader. He did not make any profit or charge an exchange fee for allowing
his  nephew  and  others  to  use  his  U.S.  bank  accounts.  Some  of  the  individuals  who
deposited  money  into  his  bank  accounts  were  from  multiple  states  in  the  U.S.  He
discovered  that  his  nephew  was  buying  the  dollars  from  a  third  party  who  knew  the
depositors.  Applicant  never  considered  that  his  nephew  was  engaged  in  any  form  of
criminal  activity  or  money  laundering.  In  about  September  2016,  Applicant  and  his
nephew had to respond to inquiries by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission
(EFCC) during the investigation of these financial transactions. This Nigerian commission
is charged with the responsibility of investigation and enforcement of all economic and
financial crimes laws in Nigeria. Applicant has not received any additional communication
from  the  EFCC.  He  had  completely  forgotten  about  this  information  during  his  first
background interview. (Tr. 29-38, 64; SOR response; GE 2)
SOR ¶ 1.b  alleges  that on  January 26,  2018,  Applicant  allowed  an  unknown person
to  deposit a  total of $10,000  in two  separate  transactions into  his bank account the  same
day.  In   his  SOR  response,  Applicant   admitted   he   had   transferred   this  money   at  the
request of his nephew   into   his nephew’s  foreign   entity  created   for   the   sole   purpose  of
exchanging   currency  for  profit.   At  the   hearing,  Applicant  stated   that  his  mother  had
passed  away in 2009.  In  2018, he  and  his family decided  to  create  a  memorial for his
mother. Applicant had  the  money deposited  into  his bank account  from  unknown sources,
and   then   he  transferred  the   money   to  pay   for his mother’s memorial.  Applicant  did not
provide  corroborating  documentation  to  support his later inconsistent statement. (Tr. 38-
41; SOR Response; GE 2)
Foreign Influence
Under Guideline B, SOR ¶ 2.a repeated the allegation as set forth in SOR ¶ 1.a,
but  this  allegation  also  alleged  that  in  February  2018,  Applicant  loaned  his  nephew
approximately $1,551. Applicant previously addressed the first part of this allegation, cited
above.
Applicant testified that after discovering his nephew had lied to him about raising
money to renovate the palace and ultimately using his bank accounts for making a profit
on the currency exchange rate, Applicant received a request from his nephew to loan him
some money  by  transferring  $1,500  into  his nephew’s  ex-spouse’s  bank  account.  She
was a resident of the U.S. Applicant did this because his nephew did not have money at
the time, and his nephew’s ex-spouse needed money to care for a sick child. (SOR ¶ 2.d)
(Tr. 41-44; SOR response)
SOR  ¶¶  2.b  and  2.c  allege  that  in  2016  Applicant  transferred  (an  unspecified
amount of) money to one business entity, and he transferred $74,000 to another business
entity, both located in Nigeria. Applicant testified that one of these entities is a gas station
owned  by  his  nephew.  I  assumed  the  other  entity  is  the  false  construction  entity  his
nephew  used  for  the  exchange  of  foreign  currency.  SOR  ¶  2.e  alleged  that  Applicant
maintains a bank account in Nigeria. At the hearing  Applicant estimated that he had a
total of $75 in this bank account. He disclosed this information on his security clearance
application (SCA). (Tr. 44-45; GE 2; SOR response)
SOR ¶ 2.g alleges that Applicant has three sisters, two brothers, and a stepbrother
who  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Nigeria.  SOR  ¶  2.h  alleges  that  Applicant  has  a
stepbrother  who  resides  elsewhere.  Applicant  admitted  the  information  at  the  hearing,
and he also stated that he has a total of six half-brothers. His father had three wives, so
basically, they are his half-brothers instead of stepbrothers, as alleged in the SOR and
likewise listed on his SCA. After his father passed away in late December 2022, Applicant
claimed  he  has not  spoken  with  any of his family members.  One  sister works as  a  mid-
wife, and he  was not certain if his other two  sisters were  employed. One  brother sells food
provisions,   another  brother   is  a   farmer,  and   his  oldest  half-brother   is  a   professor   at   a
university in South  Africa.  He has occasionally sent money to  these  family members at
their  request.  The  last time he provided  money occurred  in  February 2022  when  he  sent
$125   to   help  pay  for  a   family  member’s   hospital  bill.   None   of  his   family  members  are
associated  with  the  Nigerian  military or government.  (Tr. 47-59,  64-66; GE  1, GE  2; SOR
response)
SOR  ¶  2.i  alleges  Applicant  has  two  friends  who  are  citizens  and  residents  of
Nigeria. He testified that he occasionally receives texts from these friends, but not on a
regular basis. They both sent their condolences to Applicant after his father passed away
in  December  2022.  He  does  not  believe  his  friends  are  associated  with  the  Nigerian
military or government. (Tr. 54-59; GE 2; SOR response)
Foreign Preference
The SOR also alleges Guideline C security concerns based on Applicant’s banking
transactions,  as  set  forth  in  subparagraph  1.a,  above,  were  conducted  to  finance  the
renovation  of  a  palace  in  his  hometown  in  Nigeria.  (SOR  ¶  3.a)  In  Applicant’s  SOR
response  he  admitted  this  information  but  denied  he  had  personally  contributed  any
money for the renovation of the palace. (SOR response)
",True
"In his Answer to the original SOR, Applicant admitted the Guideline B allegations
at SOR ¶¶ 1.a - 1.d and denied SOR ¶ 1.e, all with explanations. He denied all of the
Guideline  F  allegations  (SOR  ¶¶  2.a  - 2.n,  all  with  explanations.  I  construe  his
statements in FORM Response 2, to include denials of the amended allegations at SOR
¶¶ 1.e and 2.a. Applicant’s admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a
thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the
following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  43  years  old.  He  married  his  first  wife  in  2002.  They  separated  in
2014  and  divorced  in  September  2019.  (AE  A)  He  has  a  son  and  a  daughter,  both
teenagers, with his first wife. (Item 3) He states several times that he and his first wife
had  a  difficult  relationship.  He  asserts  that  she  was  addicted  to  drugs,  that  he  had  a
restraining order against her, and that she impacted his finances negatively during their
separation. Applicant remarried in October 2019. His two children live with him and his
second wife. He currently works at an overseas location. (Items 2, 3; FORM Responses
1 and 2)
Applicant earned a bachelor’s degree in April 2022. (FORM Responses 1 and 2)
Between 1997 and 2014, he served in the Marine Corps on active duty, and in reserve
status  in  the  Air  National  Guard.  He  retired  from  the  Marine  Corps  in  2014  and  was
discharged  honorably. (Item 3) After leaving the military in September 2014, Applicant
worked for several years in a variety of jobs in the defense industry, both in the United
States  and  overseas.  (Item  3;  FORM  Response  1)  He  resigned  from  his  job  with  a
defense contractor at a naval air station in the western United States in February 2023.
(FORM Response).
As  noted  in  the  procedural  history  of  this  case,  above,  Applicant  has  now
relocated to the Persian Gulf, where he has taken a job outside the defense industry, a
job for which he needs neither access to classified nor sensitive information. Since this
case  was  remanded  by  the  Appeal Board  for a  new decision, however, DOHA  retains
jurisdiction  over  the  case  even  if  Applicant  is  no  longer  sponsored  for  classified  or
sensitive access, as also discussed above.
Few details about Applicant’s current employment situation are known. He does
not identify his employer, except to say that “I work overseas representing US interests.”
(FORM Response 2). He provided no details of his income or salary, or other terms of
his new employment.
Guideline B
The  foreign  influence  allegations  under  Guideline  B  concern  Applicant’s
connections to Tunisia through his wife and her family.
Applicant’s wife is a Tunisian citizen. (SOR ¶ 1.a) At the time he submitted his e-
QIP  (October  2019)  she  was  applying  for  a  U.S.  immigrant  visa.  (Item  3  at  30)  More
recently,  Applicant  indicates  in  FORM  Response  2  that  she  is  a  legal  permanent
resident  of  the  United  States,  and  she  now  qualifies  for  expedited  citizenship  through
his  status  as  a  spouse  regularly  employed  abroad.  She  has  relocated  to  the  United
States,  and  he  says  she  will  join  him  in  his  overseas  location  once  she  obtains  U.S.
citizenship  in  an  estimated  6-12  months.  (FORM  Response  2)  He  noted  in  FORM
Response 1 that his wife operated a physical therapy clinic in Tunisia until 2016.
Applicant  asserts  that  his  wife’s  loyalty  to  Tunisia  extends  only  to  food  and
sports.  She  loves  America  and  the  American  way  of  life  and  embodies  the  sacred
national values of “life, liberty and the pursuit of freedom.” She is willing to renounce her
Tunisian  citizenship  once  she  obtains  U.S.  citizenship.  Applicant  himself  has  no
allegiance  or  loyalty  to  Tunisia  except  for  his  wife’s  family,  who  are  “would-be
Americans” born with the wrong passports. He asserts, essentially, that Tunisia is not a
security concern because it is a small country that does not often make world news and
will never be able to recover economically from its historical status as a French colony.
He notes that the murder rate in Tunisia is less than in the U.S., and much less than in
Mexico  (where  he  says,  “no  one  is  denied  a  clearance  for having  close  ties.”)  (FORM
Responses 1 and 2; Answer) (This last statement is not necessarily true, but since the
consideration  of  Applicant’s  eligibility  here  is  not  a  comparative  exercise,  it  is  also  not
something that needs to be addressed further.)
Applicant’s  mother-in-law and  father-in-law are citizens  and  residents of  Tunisia.
(SOR ¶  1.b) He  disclosed  them  both  on  his e-QIP  and  noted  that  he  and  his mother-in-
law do  not  speak the  same  language, so  communication  was through  his  wife. (Item  3
at  37)  He   and   his  mother-in-law  later  had   a   falling   out,   and   he   says  they   no   longer
communicate.   (Answer)   He  said  his   father-in-law   is  a   “decent   guy,”   but  they  do   not
understand   each   other,  so   communication   is  difficult.   (Answer)  He   provides  no
indication  in the FORM Responses  about any more recent  interactions.
Applicant’s sister-in-law is a citizen and resident of Tunisia. (SOR ¶ 1.c) He says
in his Answer that they met twice on vacations to Tunisia a number of years ago, and
that  “[I]  don’t  much  care  for  her.”  (Answer)  He  provides  no  indication  in  the  FORM
Responses about more recent interactions.
Applicant’s brother-in-law is a  Tunisian  citizen, allegedly  living  in  Kuwait. (SOR ¶
1.d)  On  his e-QIP,  Applicant reported that his brother-in-law lived  there and worked for a
commercial  airliner.   He   said   they   were   friends.   (Item   3  at  39-40)  In   his  Answer,
Applicant  said   his  brother-in-law  had   relocated   to   the   United   States.  Applicant   let  his
brother-in-law  live   with   him   (and   his  wife)   but  asked   him   to   move   out  for  being   a
“freeloader.”  The  brother-in-law chose  to  remain in the  United  States rather than  return
to   Tunisia,   where   he   says  job   opportunities   are   few.   Applicant  does  little   more   than
exchange   “pleasantries”   with   him.   (Answer)   He  provides   no   indication   in   the   FORM
Responses  about more  recent interactions.
In  SOR  ¶  1.e,  the  Government  alleges  that  Applicant  sends  $500  a  month  to
support  his  mother-in-law  in  Tunisia.  As  amended,  SOR  ¶  1.e  now  includes  the
allegation  that  this  money  is  “to  pay  your  wife’s  expenses  so  that  the  Tunisian
government  does  not  take  legal  action  against  her  or  her  parents.”  This  is  based  on
Applicant’s Answer, in which he explained that the money concerns a car loan that his
wife took out in Tunisia before they met, as well as “back taxes”  on her failed physical
therapy business that she closed in 2016. (Answer) He explained further that he made
the  payments  on  his  wife’s  behalf  essentially  to  avoid  legal  trouble  that  might  result  if
they did not pay the debt. He asserted in  FORM Response 1 that he would no  longer
send  money  to  Tunisia  since  it  suggested  a  security  concern.  (FORM  Response  1)
Applicant reaffirmed in FORM Response to that his wife no longer has  debt in Tunisia
and that he no longer sends money there. (FORM Response 2)
Applicant gives no indication in FORM Response 2 of any recent travel to Tunisia
by either himself or his wife. He asserts that if he were the subject of coercion or threats
by his Tunisian family (or, one presumes, someone else), he would “break contact and
alert authorities.” He took the job overseas to provide for his family. He loves his country
and  is  proud  of  his  Marine  Corps  service.  He  loves  God,  his  mother  and  family,  and
American values, and would never betray the country. (FORM Response 2)
Guideline F
The  financial  portion  of  the  SOR  concerns  13  delinquent  debts,  initially  totaling
about  $65,000  (SOR  ¶¶  2.a-2.m),  plus  a  wage  garnishment  (SOR  ¶  2.n).  Applicant
denied  all  of  the  debts  in  the  original  SOR,  with  brief  explanations.  (Items  1,  2)  He
provided some documents with his two FORM Responses, to be addressed below.
The existence of the SOR debts is established by the credit reports in the record,
from January 2020 (Item 5) and December 2021. (Item 4) The Government included a
current  credit  report,  from  February  2023,  with  FORM  2.  (Item  7)  The  specific  SOR
debts are addressed below.
SOR ¶ 2.a is a debt that has been charged off by auto financing creditor C. The
Government amended the amount owed from $46,000 to $29,100. (FORM Response 2)
The account is listed as charged off (for $29,186) in October 2014 on the January 2020
credit  report.  (Item  5  at  8)  Applicant  denied  the  debt,  asserting  that  it  was  the
responsibility of his former wife through their divorce settlement. (Item 2)
On  his  2019,  e-QIP,  Applicant  disclosed  two  repossessed  autos,  both  financed
by creditor C. One was his car, a 2014 leased German auto. It was repossessed after
the separation because he could not afford to support two households. Another was his
ex-wife’s 2014 sport utility vehicle (SUV) that was in his name but which was assigned
to her in the divorce. (Item 3 at 64-65)
AE  A  is  a  “Property  Order  Attachment  to  Judgment”  relating  to  Applicant’s
divorce.  It  notes  that  he  and  his  first  wife  married  in  May  2002  and  separated  in
February 2014. AE A references a sport utility vehicle (SUV), the debt for which is fully
assigned  to  the  respondent  (his  ex-wife).  The  “Judgment”  to  which  AE  A  refers  as  an
“Attachment” is likely the Judgment of Divorce (from 2019), but it is not included in the
record here. No other related documents are included. It is not entirely clear that this is
the same debt referenced in the SOR, but it is likely so, since Applicant’s other 2014 car
was a leased vehicle.
SOR  ¶  2.b  ($1,961)  is  a  debt  owed  to  an  unidentified  medical  creditor,  a  debt
listed as past due as of January 2020. The date of last activity is June 2014, and it was
assigned  to  collections  in  August  2015.  (Item  5)  Applicant  denied  the  debt,  asserting
that no member of his family had incurred a $1,900 medical debt.
SOR  ¶¶  2.g  ($322)  and  2.j  ($160)  are  medical  accounts  placed  for  collection.
(Item 5) The (same) collection agency is identified, but in each case the medical creditor
is  not.  Applicant  asserted  that  his  ex-wife  had  incurred  the  debts  in  his  name,  without
his  knowledge  or  approval  after  they  divorced,  in  violation  of  an  order  relating  to  the
divorce settlement.
SOR  ¶  2.c  ($1,635)  is  an  account  placed  for  collection  by  a  military  retailer  or
creditor.  It  was  assigned  in  May  2011  and  reported  for  collection  in  December  2019
(Item 5) Applicant asserts in his answer that he paid it in full in May 2021, though this is
not documented. It is not listed on his most recent CBR. (Item 7)
SOR ¶ 2.d ($931) is an  account placed for collection by an apartment complex,
probably  for  unpaid  rent  or  other  related  fees.  It  was  placed  for  collection  in  January
2020.  (Item  5)  Applicant  asserted  in  his  Answer  that  he  disputed  the  debt  and  said  it
was removed from his credit report. It is not listed on later CBRs.
SOR  ¶  2.e  ($550)  is  an  account  placed  for  collection  by  a  cable  or  internet
company. (Items 4, 5) Applicant asserted in his Answer that he disputed the debt, and it
was removed from his credit report. It is not listed on his most recent CBR. (Item 7)
SOR ¶  2.f ($484)  is an  account  placed  for collection  by  a  phone  company. (Item
5) Applicant asserted  in  his Answer that he  disputed  the  debt,  and  it was  removed  from
his credit report.  It is not listed on  his most recent CBR.  (Item  7)
SOR ¶  2.h  ($241) is an  account  placed  for  collection  by a  cable company. (Item
5)  Applicant   denied   the   debt,   and   said  he   had   never  heard   of  the   company.  It   is  not
listed on  his most recent CBR.  (Item  7)
SOR ¶ 2.i ($191) is an account placed for collection in 2019 by a school district.
(Item  5)  Applicant  asserted  that  this debt  is his  ex-wife’s  responsibility,  as  it  relates  to
school  supplies  for  their  children,  supplies  that  she  lost.  It  is  not  listed  on  his  most
recent CBR. (Item 7)
SOR ¶  2.k ($117) is an  account  placed  for collection  by a  phone  company.  (Item
5)  Applicant   denied   this  debt,   asserting   that  he   has   never  had   an   account   with   this
phone  company.  It is not listed on  his most recent CBR.  (Item  7)
SOR ¶ 2.l ($7,000) concerns delinquent federal income taxes for tax years (TY)
2017  and  2018.  Applicant  denied  owing  any  past-due  federal  taxes  for  TY  2018.  He
acknowledged  in  his  Answer  that  his  2017  federal  income  tax  return  remained  unfiled
because his ex-wife “won’t  disclose  her earnings  in  the hopes of getting me in trouble
with the IRS.” (Item 2)
Applicant disclosed  on his 2019  e-QIP  that he had failed  to file  his  2017  state  and
federal  tax  returns, and  he  reported  that  he  owed  about  $7,000  or $8,000  combined. He
asserted  that he was  having  issues with  his ex-wife  (they were still  married  in  TY 2017)
because  she “was  refusing  to  let me  claim  both  of my kids”  as dependents.  He said he
worked  in  a  tax-free  zone  at  the  time  and  did  not expect to  have  to  pay taxes.  He  filed
his  taxes  and   began   a   payment   plan   of  about  $1,000   a   month   for  eight  months   to
resolve  the  debt.  He  also  said  he  had  gained  full custody of his children. (Item  3  at  61-
63)
In  FORM  Response  1,  Applicant  says  “I  still  owe  back  taxes  for  2017  but  I’m
waiting  for  a  total  and  a  settlement  agreement.”  He  has  hired  a  “tax  defense”  firm  to
assist him. He says again that he worked in a tax-free zone in the Persian Gulf region
during  all  of  2017  as  a  defense  contractor.  He  asserts  ignorance  with  the  process  of
fixing  this  problem,  which  is  why he  sought professional  assistance.  He  notes  that  his
wages are no longer being garnished. (FORM Response 1; AE B, AE C)
With  FORM  Response  2,  Applicant  provides  a  May  2021  letter  from  the  U.S.
Treasury Department. It appears to concern a payment  made (or owed) by the IRS to
Applicant and his wife on May 19, 2021. It is probably a tax refund. The amount of the
payment is $4,360. The letter also says that “we applied your payment to debt that you
owe to the following agency . . .” The “agency” listed is a military exchange service. The
debt owed is unclear, but $2,014 (of Applicant’s tax payment, or refund) was applied to
it, as a “Non-Tax Federal Debt.” (AE D) (This “Non-Tax Federal Debt” is not discussed
elsewhere  in  the  record,  and  it  is  not  alleged  in  the  SOR.).  Further,  AE  D  does  not
indicate that any portion of the $4,360 payment was redirected to pay any other federal
debt, such as past-due taxes from a prior tax year (such as 2017 or 2018, as alleged).
Applicant  also  attached  to  FORM  Response  2  a  screen  shot  to  show  a  $3,065
refund on his 2022 federal taxes. (AE E) A subsequent deposit into his bank account is
not reflected.
SOR ¶ 2.m ($5,500) concerns delinquent state income taxes for the same years.
Applicant denied owing state income taxes to his home state, both in his Answer and in
FORM  Response  1.  He  says  he  was  mistaken  about  owing  state  income  taxes.  The
support for the $5,500 figure alleged in SOR ¶ 2.m is not clearly established. Applicant
disclosed  owing  state  and  federal  taxes  on  his  e-QIP  of  a  combined  total  of  about
$7,000 or $8,000. (Item 3) He now asserts that he does not owe anything to the state.
While it is possible that he owes state taxes for 2017 (since his federal return is unfiled)
this is not clearly established.
Further,  with  FORM  Response  2,  Applicant  provided  a  screenshot  from  his
phone  reflecting  that  a  2022  state  tax  refund  of  $1,435,  had  been  deposited  into  his
bank  account.  From  this,  it  can  be  inferred  that  he  does  not  owe  (or  no  longer  owes)
any  past-due  state  tax  debt,  since  if  he  did,  the  refund  would  have  been  captured  to
address it. (AE F)
SOR  ¶  2.n  alleges  that  Applicant’s  wages  at  his  employer,  company  A,  at  the
naval air station “were garnished in about November 2019, in the approximate amount
of  $600,  bi-weekly.  As  of  the  date  of  this  Statement  of  Reasons,  the  garnishment  has
not been completed.” (Item 1) The creditor related to the garnishment is not identified in
the  record.  In  his  Answer,  Applicant  denies  SOR  ¶  2.n,  noting  that  “I  neither  work  for
[company A] nor have any wages garnished.”  (Item 2) AE B and AE C are Applicant’s
paystubs from a subsequent employer, Company P, from April 8, 2022 and March 2021,
respectively.  No  garnishment  is  indicated.  This  allegation  is  not  established  in  the
record evidence before me, and even if so, the garnishment is resolved.
Applicant’s  most  recent  credit  report  in  the  record  is  from  late  February  2023.
(Item 7) It shows one credit account that has been charged off in the amount of $1,168.
The account was opened in May 2021, last payment in September 2021, and reported
in February 2023. (Item 7 at 4) Another account was charged off for $679 in February
2023. (Item 7 at 5) The other 10 accounts listed are all in “pays as agreed” status. (Item
7)
In FORM Response 2, Applicant addresses the question, “Can you explain your
debt  and  unpaid  taxes?”  He  was  employed  from  2019  to  2022,  but  also  attending
school.  Some  months  he  earned  about  $8,000,  others  about  $5,000,  with  impacts  of
school,  illness,  injury,  and  quarantining  for  COVID  (three  times,  for  two  weeks  each
time. His injuries resulted from his Marine Corps service or his later job as a mechanic
at the naval air station. (FORM Response 2)
Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  “racked  up  debt  on  multiple  credit  cards.”  He
was  making  only  minimum  payments  on  one  account.  He  could  not  afford  to  pay  the
others (about $1,600). He hoped to build his credit but got behind and could not afford
to pay them. He used one card (about $5,000) for utilities and living expenses and could
not  afford  to  pay  the  minimum  balance.  He  ran  out  of  GI  Bill  money.  His  income  was
also cut in half, making it difficult to feed and shelter his family. (FORM Response 2)
Applicant’s finances have improved now that he has begun his job overseas. He
says  he earns  about $5,000  every two  weeks  (about $10,000  per month).  His  rent for
the home where his wife and children live in the U.S. is $1,925 per month. He has $640
a month in car payments. He is beginning to get caught up on addressing his debt. He
still is settling his federal tax debt with the IRS, and he does not intend to contest what
he is told he owes. (FORM Response)

",True
"Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR except for ¶ 1.f, which he denied. After
a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant is 37 years old. He served in the National Guard from 2008 to 2014 and
was  honorably  discharged.  He  attended  community  college  from  2010  to  2011  and
another college  for one  semester in  2017.  He  married  in 2015.  His wife  is a  citizen  of
Kyrgyzstan  and  is  pending  naturalization  as  a  U.S.  citizen.  She  does  not  yet  have  a
permanent resident card. Applicant  has a stepchild and two children. All three children
were  born  in  Kyrgyzstan.  His  two  biological  children  are  citizens  of  the  United  States.
Applicant is employed overseas, and he and his family live with him there. (Item 3; AE A)
Applicant  has  been  employed  by  a  federal  contractor  since  July  2018.  On  his
September 2018 security clearance application (SCA), he disclosed he was unemployed
from May 2014 to November 2014 and November 2014 to February 2015. (Item 3)
In his 2018 SCA, Applicant disclosed the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.d,
1.e, and 1.f. The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a ($462) and 1.b ($878) are to the same creditor.
Applicant  said  he  was  in  the  process  of  repaying  both  of  these  debts.  During  his
December 2018 interview with a government investigator, he said he intended to address
his financial issues aggressively with excess pay he was earning. He acknowledged the
debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.e and 1.f. In Applicant’s March 2022 answer to the SOR,
he admitted the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.e and denied the debt in 1.f. Regarding
the  debts  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  1.b,  he  said  once  he  contacts  the  creditor  to  get  the
necessary information to access pay options, he will pay the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a and make
a partial payment for the debt in SOR ¶ 1.b. In his response to the FORM, Applicant did
not provide any evidence that he has taken action to resolve these debts. SOR ¶¶ 1.a
and 1.b are unresolved. (Items 2, 3, 4)
The debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.d ($6,719) and 1.e ($9,595) are to the same creditor. SOR
¶¶ 1.d is a credit card debt. It appears that SOR ¶ 1.e is a loan. In his SCA, Applicant
stated for SOR ¶ 1.d that he was unable to make the payments on the account. He said,
“repayment is ongoing to correct this debt.” (Item 3) The delinquency began in 2017. He
stated the action he was taking was as follows: “I am  working  with  [creditor] to  resolve
this issue and hopefully have the card reinstated.” (Item 3) For SOR ¶ 1.e he said, “I am
planning  to  make  payments  for  this  after  repaying  the  credit  card  debt.”  (Item  3)  He
acknowledged the debts with the government investigator and said he was aggressively
addressing them with his excess pay. In his SOR answer, he said he will work with the
creditor to resolve both debts as soon as possible after he completes paying the debts in
SOR ¶¶ 1.a through 1.c. He said it may take time, but he will bring the accounts into good
standing. In Applicant’s response to the FORM, he said he had contacted the creditor and
made  payment  arrangements  whereby  monthly  payments  would  be  automatically
deducted  from  his  account.  No  evidence  was  provided  to  show  the  payment
arrangements or other actions to resolve the debts. SOR ¶¶ 1.d and 1.e are unresolved.
(Items 2, 3, 4, 5; AE A)
In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted the debt in SOR ¶ 1.c ($1,720) and said he
will pay it off after he has paid the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b. No evidence was provided
to show he has been paying any of his delinquent debts.
Applicant reported the debt in SOR ¶ 1.f ($13,047) in his SCA. This debt was for a
repossessed car in 2014 during a time when he was laid off from his job, and unable to
make payments on the car and then his son was born. He said the car was sold and the
debt resolved. During his December 2018 background interview, he acknowledged the
debt. In his answer to the SOR, he said the debt should not be on his credit report because
the  creditor  recouped  the  money  owed.  He  said,  “I  am  opening  a  dispute  to  have  it
removed.”  The  debt  is  reported  on  his  April  2021  credit  report  as  “charged  off”  and
“account  paid  for less than  full  balance.”  He said he received a  letter that the car was
sold, and the debt recovered. He assumed he did not have to repay any amount.  This
debt is resolved. (Items 2, 3, 4, 5; AE A)
In  his  response  to  the  FORM,  Applicant  said  “I  am  working  to  resolve  my  debt
issues  but  right  now I am trying  to get my wife  a green  card  so that  we  can have two
incomes which will help with repayments as well.” (AE A)
Applicant’s mother-in-law, two sisters-in-law and a brother-in-law are all citizens
and residents of Kyrgyzstan. His wife speaks to her mother and sisters almost daily and
her brother often. Applicant provides monthly financial support to his wife’s mother  and
sisters. His mother-in-law is not employed. In his SCA, he reported his sisters-in-law were
not employed. He reported his brother-in-law has a logistics company. In his answer to
the SOR, he said his sisters-in-law own and operate a restaurant. In his response to the
FORM,  he  acknowledged  that  Kyrgyzstan  is  a  hostile  place  to  him  and  his  children
because  of  their  race.  He  said  his  wife’s family  is not  affiliated  with the government  of
Kyrgyzstan. (Items 2, 3, 4; AE A)
",False
"Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶  1.d,  with  explanations,  but  he  denied  the  remaining
allegations (SOR ¶¶ 1.a–1.c, 1.e–1.g, and 2.a–2.b). His admission is incorporated into
these findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following
additional findings of fact.
Applicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor.  He began working
at  his  present  job  in  August  2020.  He  has  worked  for  U.S.  defense  contractors  since
2007,  except  for  two  periods  of  unemployment  (March-July  2018  and  January-March
2016); and when he worked for a  foreign contractor that had a contract with the  UAE,
discussed  below  (May  2014-January  2016).  He  served  in  the  U.S.  Air  Force  for  10
years,  and  he  was  honorably  discharged  in  2007.  He  holds  a  Ph.D.  He  has  been
married over 24 years and has four children, ages 22, 21, 19, and 17. (Tr. 6, 23, 34, 27;
GE 1)
Under  Guideline  F,  the  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  had  a  past-due  mortgage
account  in  the  amount  of  approximately  $29,400  (SOR  ¶  1.a)  and  two  charged-off
accounts  in  the  approximate amounts of $1,300  and $2,398 (SOR  ¶¶ 1.b-1.c); that he
was  delinquent  on  a  loan  to  a  foreign  bank  in  the  approximate  amount  of  $103,000
(SOR  ¶  1.g);  that  he  had  an  IRS  tax  lien  filed  against  him  in  April  2017,  for
approximately  $31,000  (SOR  ¶  1.d);  that  he  owed  delinquent  federal  income  taxes  to
the IRS for tax years 2014 and 2018, in the amount of approximately $54,000; and that
he failed to file federal income tax returns for tax years 2014 through 2018, as required.
Under Guideline B,  the  SOR  cross-alleged SOR  ¶  1.g  (SOR  ¶ 2.a)  and  that  Applicant
had approximately $42,000 frozen by the foreign bank servicing his account because of
his  delinquent  loan.  (SOR  ¶  2.b)  Applicant’s admissions  and documentation  contained
in  his  undated  answers  to  interrogatories  and  credit  reports,  establish  the  SOR
allegations under Guideline F. (GE 3-4)
Financial  Considerations
Applicant  credibly  explained  that  there  were  several  reasons  for  his  financial
difficulties that began in approximately 2013. First, he took on the responsibility for his
father’s nursing-home care after his mother passed away in 2013. His father was 100%
disabled  due  to  a  stroke  he  suffered.  Applicant  became  financially  responsible  for  his
father’s  nursing home costs  and medical  expenses not covered  by insurance.  He  was
not  prepared  for  the  extent  of  those  expenses.  He  ended  up  taking  money  out  of  his
retirement plan, which resulted in penalties and led to his large federal tax debt in 2014.
(Tr. 61-63; SOR answer)
The  second  contributing  reason  for  Applicant’s  financial  difficulties  occurred  in
December  2015,  when  he  lost  his  employment  in  the  UAE  due  to  his  company  losing
the contract with the UAE government. He had accepted a position with a contractor in
May  2014.  The  contractor  had  a  four-year  contract  with  the  UAE  government,  which
was  the  contract  for  which  Applicant  was  hired.  After  about  18  months,  in  December
2015, the UAE rescinded the contract and Applicant was out of a job. His yearly salary
at the time was approximately $250,000. He also had relocated his whole family to the
UAE and was required to leave the country within 30 days because he was no longer on
a  work  visa.  He  moved  back  to  the  United  States,  but  remained  unemployed  for
approximately  four  months,  resulting  in  an  income  loss  over  the  period  of  about
$80,000. This is when his monthly debts started becoming delinquent. (Tr. 24-25; SOR
answer)
The  third  reason  for  his  financial  problems  came  about  because  of  a  second
period of extended unemployment beginning in March 2018, due to an unexpected job
loss. Applicant was let go by his employer over a misunderstanding about being able to
charge for labor under the contract when he was working remotely. He had not sought
approval  beforehand  to  do  so  and  was  relieved  of  his  duties.  His  resulting
unemployment  lasted  six  months.  He  received  unemployment  benefits,  but  his  overall
loss  of  income  during  this  period  was  approximately  $60,000.  He  was  forced  to  use
savings to keep up with his bills, but he kept getting further behind. (Tr. 26; GE 1; SOR
answer)
The status of Applicant’s debts and federal tax return issues is as follows:
Past-Due  Mortgage-$29,466  (SOR ¶  1.a). Applicant explained that his mortgage
became delinquent in late 2019 or early 2020. He missed some payments because he
had  children  starting  college.  In  February  2020,  he  sent  the  bank  two  catch-up
payments, but it refused to accept them. The bank told Applicant that he had to apply
for a  mortgage  modification.  After ignoring  two  requests  by Applicant,  the  bank  began
processing  his  loan  modification  request  in  the  fall  of  2021.  The  process  was  delayed
because of Covid-19. After extended delays by the bank, Applicant decided to sell the
home. The home sold in November 2021, and Applicant documented that the mortgage
was  paid  in  December  2021.  This  debt  is  resolved.  (Tr.  33-39;  AE  A  (Atch  A);  SOR
answer (Encl 2))
Consumer  Debt-$1,307   (SOR  ¶   1.b).  This  account  was  charged  off  and
assigned  for  collection  in  May  2017.  Applicant  set  up  a  payment  plan  and  completed
making payments in September 2019, settling the debt before the issuance of the SOR.
This debt is resolved. (Tr. 40; GE 4; AE A (Atch B))
Consumer  Debt-$2,398   (SOR  ¶   1.c).  This  account  was  charged  off  and
assigned  for  collection  in  February  2017.  Applicant  set  up  a  payment  plan  and
completed making payments in March 2019 settling the debt before the issuance of the
SOR.  He  received  an  IRS  1099-C,  cancellation  of  debt  form  for  the  remainder  of  the
debt. He claimed this amount on his 2019 tax return. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 4; GE 4;
AE A (Atch C))
Bank   Loan-$103,781   (SOR  ¶   1.g).  This  debt  originated  when  Applicant  took  a
job in the UAE in 2014. He took out a $200,000 loan to establish his family’s household
in the UAE and pay for private schooling for his children. The terms of the loan provided
for  a  four-year  payback  period.  When  Applicant’s  company’s  contract  was  cancelled
after approximately 18 months and Applicant was required to leave the UAE within 30
days,  this loan  became  immediately due.  Applicant  received  approximately $42,000  in
severance pay when he was terminated because of the lost contract. The bank applied
this amount against the loan balance. This is what SOR ¶ 2.b erroneously referred to as
an  amount  “frozen”  by  the  bank  due  to  the  delinquent  loan.  Initially  the  bank  was
unwilling to accept a payment plan and demanded payment in full. Thereafter, Applicant
communicated with the bank, and it agreed to accept a payment plan for the loan. He
documented making monthly payments  from  June through September 2021. When he
sold his home in 2021, he used some of the sale proceeds to pay off this bank loan in
the UAE. He provided documentation showing the payoff. Once the loan was paid, he
closed all bank accounts in the UAE. He no longer has any bank accounts in the UAE.
This debt is resolved. (Tr. 32, 55-60, 69; AE A (Atch F); SOR answer (Encls 8-11)
IRS  Tax  Lien-$31,015  (SOR ¶  1.d).  This tax lien is an enforcement mechanism
for  the  taxes  owed  as  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.e  and  is  therefore  a  duplicitous  pleading
alleging the same underlying conduct. I find for Applicant on this allegation.
Federal  Taxes   Owed  for  2014   and  2018-$54,236   (SOR  ¶  1.e).  Applicant
incurred  a  large  tax  debt  in  2014  because  he  withdrew  funds  from  his  retirement
account  to pay  for his father’s  care,  which  resulted  in  an  early  withdrawal  penalty and
capital gains taxes. He was unable to pay the taxes when due because he had recently
lost his job in the UAE. He worked out a payment plan with the IRS and began making
payments  in  May  2021.  The  establishment  of  the  plan  was  delayed  because  of
difficulties  reaching  the  IRS  during  Covid-19.  When  he  sold  his  home  in  December
2021, he used some of the proceeds to pay all his remaining IRS debt. He documented
that  he  owes  no  further  federal  tax  debt,  and  the  tax  lien  was  released.  This  debt  is
resolved. (Tr. 36, 43-46, 61-63; AE A (Atch D), AE B, D; SOR answer)
Unfiled Federal Tax  Returns  for 2014-2019: Applicant documented that for his
2014 tax return, he requested an extension, and that return was timely filed within the
extended time frame. For the remaining tax returns in question, he filed as follows:
TY 2014-filed October 2015
TY 2015-filed February 2021
TY 2016-filed August 2019
TY 2017-filed July 2019
TY 2018-filed October 2020
TY 2019-filed February 2021 (AE A (Atch E))
Applicant  explained  that  his  2015  tax  return  was  very  complicated  because  of  his
overseas  employment  and  subsequent  termination.  He  did  not  receive  timely  tax
information from his former employer, which further delayed being able to file his 2015
return.  He  initially  sent  in  his  2015  tax  return  only  to  have  it  returned  because  of  a

snowball effect on the subsequent years’  filings and they were also delayed. Applicant
also accepted responsibility for putting the burden of handling the family’s finances and
doing their taxes on his wife. He realizes this was unfair and he now shares the financial
responsibilities  with  her.  They  timely  filed  their  2021  federal  tax  returns.  He  does  not

Foreign Influence
As explained above, Applicant’s sole connection with the UAE arose because of
his 18-month employment within the country. That employment ended in late 2015 and
Applicant has never returned. When he was employed there, he took out a loan from a
local bank to fund his family’s move to the country, establish a home there, and fund his
children’s schooling. He defaulted on the loan when he lost his job. His severance pay
was  applied  to  the  loan  balance  and  he  paid  the  remaining  amount,  initially  through
monthly  payments,  and  finally  by  using  some  of  the  proceeds  from  his  home  sale  in
December 2021. He closed all bank accounts in the UAE. He has no current financial or
family connection to the UAE. (Tr. 56: AE A (Atch F))

"In  his  answer, Applicant admitted  SOR allegations  ¶¶  1.a-1.g, and  denied  SOR ¶
1.h.  His  admissions are incorporated  into  the  findings of  fact. Based  on my review of the
pleadings, evidence  submitted, and testimony, I make the following additional findings of
fact:
Applicant   is  40   years  old.   He   has  never  been   married   and   has  no   children.  He
earned   a   bachelor’s  degree   in  2005.   Since   2021   he   has   worked   overseas   as   a   civil
engineer and  functional manager for a  government contractor. (Tr. 13-15; GE 1)
Applicant was born in Iraq and lived there until he was about 30 years old.  After
completing college in Iraq in 2005, he worked for an Iraqi company in the construction
industry. In 2008, he started working for a construction company that serviced coalition
military bases in Iraq. In 2010, he was threatened twice by unknown persons for working
on coalition bases, and had to take safety precautions. In 2012, he was granted a special
immigrant  visa  (SIV)  for  his  work  on  coalition  bases,  and  he  immigrated  to  the  United
States. He was granted U.S. citizenship in 2019. (Tr. 15-77; Answer; GE 1)
From 2012 – 2018, Applicant worked for construction companies that sent him on
assignments in various overseas locations, including Iraq, for varying amounts of time.
He  reported  that  these  assignments  usually  lasted  less  than  six months  at  a  time.  He
worked in the U.S. from about 2018 – 2021, and then took a job overseas in the Middle
East, where he continues to live and work. (Tr. 15-77; Answer; GE 1)
Applicant does not own a home or have a lease for a rental property in the United
States. He asserted that he thinks of  U.S. State A as home and has a driver’s license
from there. The license lists the address of a friend from whom Applicant claims to rent a
room  on  occasion,  when  visiting  the  United  States.  However,  in  his  testimony  at  the
hearing, Applicant did not know the last name of this friend. Applicant does not have many
persons in the United States with whom he maintains close and continuing contact. He
has a U.S. bank account and a 401K retirement account, neither of which contains more
than $20,000. (Tr. 15-77; Answer; GE 1)
Applicant’s mother and six siblings, and their immediate families, are citizens and
residents of Iraq. Four siblings have jobs that are connected to the Iraqi government. In
his  SCA,  Applicant  reported  regular  and  frequent  contact  with  almost  all  of  these
immediate family members. In his testimony, he stated that he limited his communications
with almost all of his family members after applying for a security clearance, because he
thought it would assist him in obtaining  one. He claimed not to know what jobs certain
family  members  had,  or  the  jobs  of  their  adult  children,  and  he  does  not  know  if  their
employers are affiliated with the Iraqi government or military services. (Tr. 15-77; GE 1,

In his answer, Applicant included four character letters which state that he is a

Iraq
In  AN  1,  the  Government  included  information  from  the  U.S. Department of State
as  of  September   2022,  about   the   United   States’   relations  with   Iraq   and   the   current
conditions in that country. I take  administrative notice of the  following facts:
The U.S. Department of State has assessed Iraq as being a high threat, “Level 4:
Do not travel” location due to terrorism, kidnapping, armed conflict, civil unrest, and limited
ability to assist U.S. citizens in country. U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high risk for violence
and kidnapping. Terrorist and insurgent groups regularly attack both Iraqi security forces
and civilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias threaten U.S. citizens and Western companies
throughout Iraq. Attacks using improvised explosive devices (IEDs) occur in many areas
of the country, including Baghdad. Demonstrations, protests, and strikes occur frequently.
These  events  can  develop  quickly  without  prior  notification,  often  interrupting  traffic,
transportation,  and  other  services;  such  events  have  the  potential  to  turn  violent.  The
travel warning as of the date of this decision remains the same.
The  country  experienced  large-scale  protests  in  Baghdad  and  several  Shia-
majority provinces beginning in 2019 and lasting through mid-2020, with reports of more
than 500 civilians killed and 20,000 or more injured. During the year sporadic protests
continued amid a campaign of targeted violence against activists. The government took
minimal steps to bring to justice those responsible for the violence.
Terrorist groups  and  those  inspired  by such  organizations are  intent  on  attacking
U.S.  citizens abroad.  Primary terrorist  threats  within   Iraq   included  Islamic State   in Iraq
and   Syria   (ISIS)  and   Iran-aligned   militia  groups.  ISIS   is  a   designated   terrorist
organization, which is active  in Syria  and  near the  Iraq  border. ISIS  and  its  associated
terrorist  groups  indiscriminately   commit   attacks  and   violent   atrocities  in   Iraq   despite
improved  Iraqi government control. ISIS, militia groups, and  criminal gangs target U.S.
citizens for attacks and hostage-taking.
There have been significant human rights issues in Iraq, including: credible reports
of  unlawful  or  arbitrary  killings;  extrajudicial  killings  and  forced  disappearances  by  the
government; torture and cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment by the government;
and arbitrary arrest and detention.

"Applicant  admitted  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.b,  through  1.g.  He  denied  SOR
allegation  ¶  1.a.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and
testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  48  years  old  and  is  employed  by  a  defense  contractor,  as  “a
Physicist.”  He  has  worked  for  the  defense  contractor  since  October  of  2017.  He  is
divorced and has twine boys by his former marriage. He also has one female child, by
his cohabitant. (TR at page 16 line 4 to page 19 line 4, at page 38 line 7 to page 39 line

evidenced by a naturalization certificate. (TR at page 19 line 5 to page 20 line 18, and
AppX E.) A graduate from an American law school, she has been practicing law since
2021.  (AppX  N.)  Applicant’s  cohabitant  owns  a  studio  apartment  on  the  outskirts  of
Moscow worth about $90,000, which she is trying to sell. Her annual salary is between
$80,000~$90,000. She is not reliant on Applicant for financial support. (TR at page  24
line 23 to page 28 line 4, at page 34 line 18 to page 35 line 15, at page 39 lines 19~24,
and AppX N.)
1.e.   Applicant’s 17-year-old twin boys are dual national of Russia and the United
States,  and  live  in  New  Jersey  with  their  mother,  Applicant’s  former  spouse.  He  sees
them “at least once a month,” except in the summer, when they “spend a month or two”
with their father. (TR at page 37 lines 9~21, at page 40 line 23 to page 41 line 2, and
GX 1 at pages 37~38.)  His five-year-old American daughter lives with Applicant and his
cohabitant. (TR at page 13 lines 13~22, and AppX N.)
1.b.~  1.d. Applicant’s elderly, retired parents are citizens and residents of Russia.
They are actively trying to emigrate to  Israel, to be close to Applicants’  sister who is a
citizen  and  resident  of  Israel,  not  of  Russia  as  is  alleged.  Her  husband  works  “for  a
U.S.-based  company.”  They  have  no  connection  with  the  Israeli  government.  (TR  at

Administrative  Notice
I  take  Administrative  Notice  of  the  following  facts  about  Russia:  The  Russian
Federation  has  a  highly  centralized  authoritarian  political  system  dominated  by
President Vladimir Putin. Russia violated Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity in
2014 and 2022. Russia  presents one of the most serious foreign threats to the United
States.
I take Administrative Notice of the following facts about Israel: The State of Israel
is  a  multi-parliamentary  democracy.  The  U.S.  Department  of  State  has  issued  travel
advisories  for  Israel.  Jerusalem  and  Tel  Aviv  have  been  assessed  as  HIGH-threat
locations  for  terrorism.  However,  Israel  has  been  the  United  States’  closest  ally  in  the
Middle East since it was founded in 1948.

"The  two  allegations  in  the  SOR  concern  Applicant’s  family  members  in  Jordan
(SOR  ¶  1.a)  and  his  financial  support  for  them  (SOR  ¶  1.b).  In  his  Answer,  Applicant
largely  admitted  both  allegations,  with  explanations.  His  admissions  are  incorporated
into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and
evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant  is  40  years  old.  He  was  born  in  Kuwait  but  was  granted  Jordanian
citizenship  at  birth  as  both  of  his  parents  are  citizens  of  Jordan.  The  record  does  not
reflect when his family moved back to Jordan.  However, in 2005, Applicant earned his
undergraduate degree at a university in Jordan. He came to the United States in 2007,
at  the  age  of  25,  and  began  working  in  the  banking  industry.  In  2012,  he  became  a
naturalized  United  States  citizen,  based on his own  application.  He  earned  a  master’s
degree  in  2017  from  a  university  in  the  United  States.  He  has  worked  for  his  current
employer since 2019 and is a senior analytics consultant. (GX 2-3)
Applicant married in 2013. At the time, his wife was a citizen of Syria. In 2014, he
sponsored her immigration to the United States. She later became a naturalized United
States  citizen.  They  have  two  young  children,  both  native-born  United  States  citizens.
(GX 2-3; Answer)
On  his  January  2020  e-QIP  and  during  his  March  2020  background  interview,
Applicant  disclosed  several family  members who  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Jordan.
He  described  his  family  as  “very  close”  and  that  he  maintained  regular  and  frequent
contact with them. He also provided some financial support to them when needed. None
of his family members is affiliated with a foreign government or foreign military. (GX 2-3)
Applicant also disclosed that he travelled to Jordan three times in 2013 and twice
in  2018.  He visited his family  on each of his trips.  There is no record  evidence of  any
more recent travel to Jordan. (GX 2)
Applicant’s  mother  and  father  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Jordan.  They  are  in
their  late  70s  and  retired.  His  father  owned  a  small  business  and  his  mother  was  a
homemaker. Applicant has weekly contact with his parents, primarily by phone. He has
provided them financial support over the years, usually in $200 increments and totaling
about $3,000. (GX 2-3; Answer)
Applicant  also  has  two  sisters  (S1  and  S2)  who  are  citizens  and  residents  of
Jordan. Both are married, have children and are homemakers. Applicant communicates
with  them  daily,  primarily  through  a  digital  messaging  application.  He  estimated  that,
over  several  years,  he  provided  about  $600  in  financial  support  to  one  of  his  sisters.
(GX 2-3; Answer)
Applicant  has  one  brother  (B1)  who  is  a  citizen  and  resident  of  Jordan.  This
brother  works  in  a  drugstore.  Applicant  communicates  with  B1  every  few  months,
primarily through a digital messaging application. (GX 2-3; Answer)
Another  of  Applicant’s  brothers  (B2)  is  a  Jordanian  citizen  who  lives  in  Saudi
Arabia (and not in Jordan, as alleged). B2 is married and has two children. He works in
a  trade  organization.  Applicant  communicates  with  B2  daily,  primarily through  a digital
messaging application. (GX 2-3; Answer)
Applicant  also  has  a  brother  (B3)  and  sister  (S3)  who  are  dual  U.S.-Jordanian
citizens  who  live  in  the  United  States.  B3  lives  near Applicant.  S3  is married,  has  five
children and lives in another state. (GX 2-3; Answer)
In his Answer, Applicant stated  he  maintained  a  “balanced  relationship” with  his
family  in  Jordan  and  was  committed  to  being  a  “model U.S.  citizen.”  He  described his
financial  support  to  his  family  in  Jordan  as  a  “gesture  of  love”  that  came  with  no
obligations or commitments. (Answer)
Applicant  also  included  in  his  Answer  two  reference  letters  from  character
witnesses  who  stated  that  he  is  a  reliable,  valued  and  trustworthy  associate.  In  his
FORM  Response,  Applicant  summarized  his  professional  achievements  and
responsibilities as  a  team  leader within  his company. He  cited  his conduct,  ethics and
dedication to the DOD mission he was working. (AX A; FORM Response)
Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan (Jordan)
Jordan  is  a  constitutional  monarchy  ruled  by  King  Abdullah  II  bin  Hussein.  The
king has ultimate executive and legislative authority. The multiparty parliament consists
of  a  popularly  elected  House  of  Representatives  and  a  Senate  appointed  by  the  king.
The Public Security Directorate has responsibility for law enforcement and reports to the
Ministry  of  Interior.  The  Public  Security  Directorate  and  the  General  Intelligence

for  maintaining
Directorate  share  responsibility
Intelligence  Directorate  reports  directly  to  the  king.  The  armed  forces  have  a  support
role for internal security.  Civilian authorities maintain effective control over the security
forces.  There  were  credible  reports  that  members  of  the  security  forces  committed
some abuses.
The  State  Department  updated  its  Country  Report  on  Terrorism  for  Jordan  in
February  2023.  The  information  is  substantially  similar  to  the  prior  report,  included  as
part  of  AN  I.  I  refer  to  the  more  recent  report  available  as  it  reflects  the  most  current
information  available.  Jordan  remained  a  committed  partner  on  counterterrorism  and
countering violent extremism. As a regional leader in the Defeat-ISIS Global Coalition,
Jordan played an important role in coalition successes in degrading the terrorist group’s
territorial  control  and  operational  reach.  Although  Jordan  did  not  experience  a
successful  terrorist  attack  in  2021,  the  country  faced  a  continued  threat  from  terrorist

groups.
https://www.state.gov/reports/country-reports-on-terrorism-2021/ (February 27, 2023))
However, the U.S Department of State travel advisories for Jordan, last updated
in October 2022,  range from Level 2 (Exercise Increased Caution) due to terrorism, to
Level  4  (Do  Not  Travel),  depending  on  the  area  of  the  country  visited.  The  capital  of
Amman is currently assessed as being a high-threat location for terrorism directed at or
affecting  official  U.S.  Government  interests.  Transnational  and  indigenous  terrorist
groups  have  demonstrated  the  capability  to  plan  and  implement  attacks  in  Jordan.
Violent extremist groups in Syria and  Iraq, including the Islamic State of Iraq and ash-
Sham (ISIS), and al-Qaida, directly or indirectly have conducted or supported attacks in
Jordan  and  continue  to  plot  against  local  security  forces,  U.S.  Western  interests  and
“soft” targets, such as high-profile public events, hotels, places of worship, restaurants,
schools and malls. Jordan's prominent role in the Global Coalition to defeat ISIS and its
shared borders with Iraq and Syria increase the potential for future terrorist incidents.
The most recent State Department Human Rights Report for Jordan was issued
in  March  2023.  Significant  human  rights  issues  in  Jordan  included  credible  reports  of:
torture  and  other  cruel,  inhuman,  and  degrading  treatment  or  punishment  by
government  authorities;  arbitrary  arrest  and  detention;  political  prisoners  or  detainees;
arbitrary  or  unlawful  interference  with  privacy;  serious  restrictions  on  freedom  of
expression  and  media,  including  harassment  and  intimidation  of  journalists,  unjustified
arrests  or  prosecutions  of  journalists,  censorship,  and  enforcement  of  and  threat  to
enforce  criminal  libel  laws;  serious  restrictions  on  internet  freedom;  substantial
interference  with  the  freedom  of  peaceful  assembly  and  freedom  of  association,
including  overly  restrictive
funding,  or  operation  of
nongovernmental  organizations  and  civil  society  organizations;  inability  of  citizens  to
elect  their  executive  branch  of  government  or  upper  house  of  parliament;  lack  of
investigation of and accountability for gender-based violence, including but not limited to
domestic  or  intimate  partner  violence,  sexual  violence,  and  other  harmful  practices;
violence  or  threats  of  violence  targeting  lesbian,  gay,  bisexual,  transgender,  queer,  or
intersex  persons;  and  significant  restrictions  on  workers’  freedom  of  association,
including threats against labor activists. The government took some steps to investigate,
prosecute,  and  punish  officials  who  committed  human  rights  abuses;  however,
impunity  for  such  abuses  remained  widespread.  (See  U.S.  State

Applicant is a native-born U.S. citizen. He travels extensively for work. He lives in
the United States when he is not on an overseas  assignment. His fiancée and his two
children  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Laos.  He  met  her  in  about  2014  when  he  was
working on a project in Laos. He talks with her daily over the Internet, and he spends as
much time as he can in Laos. Their two children were born in Laos. His fiancée also has
two older children from another relationship. Applicant provides her with regular support

Applicant’s  fiancée   used   to   work  in  a   restaurant.   She   then   tried   some   small
businesses.  She  now  relies   primarily  on   his   support.  Because   he   travels  so   much   for

Applicant  smoked  marijuana  when  he  was  in  high  school.  He  did  not  smoke  it
again until late 2010 or early 2011 when he was drunk at a New Year’s Eve party. He
held a  security  clearance  at  the time.  He tested  positive on a test administered by  his
employer.  As  discipline,  he  was  suspended  for  two  weeks  without  pay.  (Tr.  at  46-50;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1-3; AE F)
Applicant  credibly  testified  that  he  has  not  knowingly  smoked  or  otherwise
ingested  marijuana  since  the  failed  drug  test  in  2011.  He  tested  positive  for  THC,  the
active ingredient in marijuana, in a test administered by his employer in April 2020. He
smoked  cigarettes  for years, and  for  some  time  before  the  failed  drug  test,  he  used a
vape pen to inhale the vapor of liquids, primarily with nicotine. He purchased vape liquid
without noticing that it was a cannabidiol or CBD. He lives in a state where marijuana is
illegal, so he did not expect a legitimate store to sell a product with marijuana or THC.
He used the vape to smoke the CBD product, which must have contained some amount
of THC, resulting in the positive test. (Tr. at 50-58; Applicant’s response to SOR; AE I)
The  Security  Executive  Agent  for  the  United  States  Government  provided
clarifying guidance concerning marijuana on December 21, 2021. Part of that guidance
addressed CBD products:
With  respect to  the  use  of CBD  products,  agencies should be  aware  that
using   these   cannabis   derivatives   may  be   relevant   to   adjudications  in
accordance   with   SEAD  4.   Although   the   passage   of  the   Agricultural
Improvement  Act of  2018  excluded  hemp  from  the  definition  of  marijuana
within  the   Controlled   Substances   Act,   products  containing   greater  than   a
0.3   percent   concentration   of   delta-9   tetrahydrocannabinol  (THC),  a
psychoactive  ingredient in marijuana, do  not  meet the  definition  of  “hemp.”
Accordingly,   products   labeled   as   hemp-derived   that  contain   greater  than
0.3   percent  THC  continue   to   meet   the   legal   definition   of  marijuana,  and
therefore  remain   illegal  to   use   under  federal  law  and   policy.  Additionally,
agencies should be  aware  that the  Federal Drug  Administration  does not
certify  levels of   THC in  CBD products,   so   the   percentage  of  THC cannot
be   guaranteed,  thus  posing   a   concern  pertaining   to   the   use   of  a   CBD
product under federal law.  Studies have   shown  that   some   CBD products
exceed   the   0.3   percent   THC  threshold   for  hemp,   notwithstanding
advertising  labels (Reference  F). Therefore,  there is a  risk that using  these
products  may nonetheless cause  sufficiently high  levels of THC to  result in
a   positive  marijuana   test   under  agency-administered   employment  or
random  drug  testing  programs. Should an  individual test positive,  they will
be   subject  to   an   investigation   under  specific  guidelines  established   by
their home agency.  (GE 5)

accurately  reflect  their  content.   Cannabis  based   products  containing   a
THC   level  greater  than   0.3%  on   a  dry  weight  basis  do   not  fall   under  the
Farm   Bill’s  definition   of  hemp   even   if  they   are  labeled   as  such.   In   one
study,  the   amount  of   CBD  in  69%  of  the   84   tested   CBD  products  was
inconsistent  with   that  on   the   label,   and   some   products  contained
unlabeled   cannabinoids,  including   THC  in   amounts   up   to   6.4   mg/mL.   As
such,  an   employee’s  drug   test  may  be   positive  for  the   THC  metabolite,
delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol-9-carboxylic acid (THCA), due  to  THC in the
CBD product. (GE 6)
SAMSHA  further  advised  that  “federal  agencies  should  make  every  effort  to
inform  applicants  and  employees  of  the  risk  that  using  such  products  may  result  in  a
positive marijuana test.” (GE 6)
Applicant  passed  a  number  of  drug  tests.  He  is  now  extremely  cautious  when
purchasing vape products to ensure that he does not purchase any CBDs or marijuana-
related products. (Tr. at 58-59; Applicant’s response to SOR; AE G, I)
Applicant called  a witness, and he  submitted documents and letters attesting  to
his  excellent  job  performance  and  strong  moral  character.  He  is  praised  for  his  work
ethic, reliability, trustworthiness, dependability, honesty, judgment, and integrity. (Tr. at

"Applicant is a 62-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security
clearance.
Background
Applicant  married  his  first  wife  in  October  1994  and  divorced  her  in  December
1997. (GEs 1-2) He attributed his divorce to being married too young and growing apart.
(GE 3) His former spouse passed away in 2000. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 39-40) He has one adult
child  (age  27)  from  his  first  marriage.  (GEs  1-2)  Applicant  remarried  in  January  2007
and has three children and one stepchild from this marriage (ages 19, 15, 14, and 11).
(GEs 1-3)
Applicant   earned   a   master   of  science  degree   in 1983   in   aerospace   engineering
from  an  accredited  Iraqi university based  on  his documented  coursework. (AEs  F-G; Tr.
37)  And,   in   1999   he   earned   a   bachelor’s  degree   from   an   accredited   Iraqi   university   in
English  literature  (becoming  fluent in the  English  language). (AE  E)  He  served 15  years
of mandatory active  military service in  the Iraqi  army before  retiring  in October 1998 with
the   rank  of  colonel.  (GEs   1-3)   While   in  the   Iraqi  army,  he   had   no   combat  experience.
(GE 2)
Applicant immigrated  to  the  United  States in November 2013. (GEs  1-2  and  AEs
B  and  G) He became  a naturalized  U.S. citizen  in  June  2019  (GEs  1-3) He  has  a  U.S.
passport that  was issued  in  July 2019  and  is  due  to  expire  in  July 2020. (GEs  1-2) His
Iraqi passport  issued  in  September 2011  and  expired  in  September 2019. (GEs  1-2; Tr.
57)   Applicant  applied   for  and   obtained   his   Iraqi  passport   to   facilitate   his  travel  to   the
United   States,  and   he   has  not  used   this  passport  since   becoming   a   naturalized   U.S.
citizen.  (GE   3)  Although,  he   remains  a   dual  citizen   of  Iraq.  (GEs   1-2;  Tr.  57)   Asked
about his  retirement  intentions, Applicant professed  his loyalty to  the  United  States  and
his desire to retire in this country. (Tr. 61-62)
Applicant has no  U.S. military service  experience.  While  he  has an  earned  Iraqi
pension  that pays  him  $900  a  month, the  pension  has  been  assigned  to  his daughter  in
Iraq who  receives  the  pension  benefits automatically from  the  Iraqi government  without
any  intermediate   transmissions  routed   through   Applicant.  (GEs  1-3;   Tr.  40,  55-56)   To
date,  Applicant’s  dispensed   benefits  to   his  daughter  approximate   $75,600.   (GE   2;   Tr.
55)  These   pension   benefits  were   used   by   his  daughter   to   fund   her   college   and   living
expenses. (GE 2)
Since  May  2022,  Applicant  has  been  employed  as  a  security  officer  for  his
current employer and seeks to use his language skills as a U.S. employee or contractor.
(GE 2) He continues to be sponsored by a legal interpreting service contractor who has
sponsored him for a security clearance since 2021. (Tr. 38-39) Between June 2014 and
May 2023. he was employed as a linguist for a Catholic charity. (GE 1 and AE G; Tr. 37)
He  worked  as  a  security  officer  between  February  2014  and  June  2014,  and  as  a
linguist between March 2009 and February 2014. (GEs 1-2)
Between  2003  and  2009,  he  held  periodic  linguist  assignments  with  the
Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq. (GE 2 and G; Tr. 32) Applicant’s translation work
included  translating  U.S.  contracts  into  Arabic.  His  linguist  assignments  included
translation  work  for  a  U.S.  commander  during  the  period  of  Operation  Iraqi  Freedom
between  March  2003  and  January  2004.  (AE  A)  His  work  for  the  U.S.  commander  in
Iraq covered furnished insights into the cultural and political landscape of the region in
Iraq  subject  to  his  commander’s  monitoring and  control.  (AE  A)  Applicant  relinquished
his linguist assignments in Iraq following the kidnapping of his younger brother in 2006
and threats on his own life by Iraqi military insurgents. (GE 2)
Family  connections  with  Iraq
Both  of  Applicant’s  parents  are  deceased.  (GE  1)  His  current  wife  and  children
are  naturalized  citizens  of  the  United States.  (AE  H) His  wife  is a  homemaker  with  no
current  plans  to  enter  the  U.S.  workforce.  (GE  1-3)  Applicant’s  father-in-law  is
deceased, and he maintains infrequent contact with his current wife’s mother-in-law who
is a citizen and resident of Iraq. (GEs 1-3)
Applicant  has  two  brothers,  seven  sisters,  and  a  27-year  old  daughter  from  his
first marriage, who are citizens and residents of Iraq. (GEs 1-3; Tr. 31-34, 46) His oldest
brother is a colonel in the Iraqi army. (GEs 1-3; Tr. 30) Applicant has infrequent contact
with  his  oldest  brother,  who  is  unaware  of  Applicant’s  application  for  a  U.S.  security
clearance. (GE 3) Applicant’ maintains quarterly contact with his youngest brother who
was kidnapped by Iraqi security forces in 2003 during the Iraqi Freedom campaign. (GE
3; Tr. 43)
Applicant maintains infrequent contact with his seven sisters who reside in Iraq.
(Tr.  51-57) Several  of  his  sisters are  teachers,  and  some  of  the  children  of  his  sisters
are  teachers  as  well.  (Tr.  46-47)  And,  some  of  his  sister’s  children  are  employed  by
Iraq’s  voluntary  army.  (Tr.  51-52)  He  has  not  provided  financial  support  to  any  of  his
brothers or sisters. (Tr. 48-55) Four of his sisters applied for refugee status in the United
States in 2016, and their applications are still pending. (Tr. 62-63) Currently, these four
sisters reside outside the historical family home region. (Tr. 63)
While Applicant’s daughter in Iraq is assigned his life-time Iraqi military pension
rights,  he  provides  no  other  financial  benefits  to  her.  (Tr.  56)  Applicant  expressed  his
willingness  to  renounce  his  Iraqi  citizenship,  even  it  meant  eliminating  his  military
pension rights. (Tr. 57-58)
Applicant assured that he has never provided any financial support to any of his
siblings  in  Iraq  and  has  no  plans  to  do  so  in  the  future.  (Tr.  46)  None  of  his  siblings
(save  for  his  older  brother)  have  any  affiliations  or  ties  with  the  Iraqi  government  or
military.  Besides  his  contacts  with  his  family  members,  Applicant  has  no  other  foreign
contacts (GE 3; Tr.58)
Country Status of Iraq
The Federal Republic of Iraq (Iraq) is a constitutional parliamentary republic. The
outcome  of  the  October  2021  parliamentary  elections  generally  met  international
standards  of  free  and  fair  elections.  See  Request  for  Administrative  Notice-Federal
Republic of Iraq (Iraq) at 2 and 2021 Iraq Human rights Report at 1; U.S. Department of
State (April 2022). The  elections were observed by  the  European Union and domestic
civil  society  organizations  and  monitored  by  the  United  Nations  Assistance  Mission  or
Iraq. (id.) The 2021 elections were scheduled because of the widespread protests that
began in October 2019 and led to the resignation of former prime minister Adil Abd al-
Mahdi  in  December  2019.  Parliament,  in  turn,  confirmed  Prime  Minister  Mustafa  al-
Kadhimi in May 2020.
In  preparation  for the 2021  national elections,  Iraq  adopted  a  new  electoral  law
based on individual candidacy and local districts. The 2021 election law was designed
to  create  new  political  opportunities  for  independents  and  members  and  protest
movement that brought down the government formed after the 2018 election.  See Iraq
and  U.S.  Policy,  (Congressional  Research  Service  (May  2022).  Whether  the  election
results  and  formation  talks will reduce  the  formal influence of  Iran-aligned groups  who
seek  to  revise  or  rescind  Iraq’s  invitation  to  U.S.  military  advisors  to  remain  in  Iraq  is
unclear.
For  historical  perspective,  in  2003,  a  U.S.-led  coalition  invaded  Iraq  and
succeeded  in  removing  Saddam  Hussein  and  his  Ba’athist  regime  from  military  and
political  power.  See  the  World  Factbook:  Iraq,  U.S.  Central  Intelligence  Agency  (Feb.
2018); Background Note, Iraq, at 3, U.S. Dept. of State (Feb. 2008). After two years of
operations  under  a  provisional  authority,  Iraq’s  new  government  assumed  office  in
March 2006 (with the approval of the U.S. government), following free elections. (id)
Since  March  2006,  the  government  of  Iraq  has  been  comprised  of  a  broad
coalition of political alliances representing the Shiite, Sunni, and Kurdish blocs. See the
World Factbook: Iraq, supra, at 2; Background Note, Iraq, supra, at 8.  While elections
have been held and concluded, none of the key constituent groups have been able  to
form  a  government,  adopt  an  oil  law,  establish  and  maintain  effective  security
throughout  the  provinces,  or  neutralize  sectarian  divisions.  In  this  still  very  fragile
political environment in Iraq, there are substantiated reports of human rights abuses that
continue to underscore a still pervasive climate of tension and violence. See Iraq 2021
Human Rights Report at 2-3, U.S. Dept. of State (April 2022)
Post-COVID-19  protests  intensified  in  May  2021,  with  demonstrators  insisting
that the government identify and prosecute suspects in a series of assassinations and
kidnappings  since  2020  of  protest  lesdars,  activists,  and  a  prominent  security
researcher. The incidents have intensified public scrutiny of Prime Minister Al Kadhimi’s
credibility  and  his  government’s  ability  to  act  against  armed  groups  operating  outside
state control. Iraq and U.S. Public Policy,, supra.
Whatever  government  is  ultimately  forged  from  the  competing  Iraqi  political
blocks  is bound to test  will  U.S.  continued  security  cooperation and  other  bilateral ties
against  the  security  risks  posed  by  Iraq’s  cited  persistence  of  patronage  politics,
corruption, oil dependence, and armed non-state actors. See Request for Administrative
Notice,  Iraq,  supra,  at  2;  Iraq  and  U.S.  Policy,  at  1-2,  U.S.  Congressional  Research
Services (June 2021).
Iraq’s economy continues to be dominated by the oil sector, as it has for the past
half century since the completion of new pipelines to Lebanon in 1949, and to Syria in
1952. See the World Factbook: Iraq, supra; Background Note, Iraq, supra. As a result of
the U.S.-led invasion in 2003, much of Iraq’s oil-refining capabilities were shuttered. The
rebuilding of oil infrastructure and utilities  infrastructure has continued to expand since
2004 with U.S. aid and support, despite setbacks from insurgent activity.
Proposed  oil  revenue-sharing  legislation  among  the  three  war-hardened  ethno-
sectarian  divisions  (Shia,  Sunni,  and  Kurds)  still  awaits  passage  after  four  years  of
stalled  negotiations,  and  at  the  moment,  there  are  no  good  estimates  of  when  such
legislation will be approved and implemented. See Statement of the Record, Worldwide
Threat  Assessment  of  the  U.S.  Intelligence  Community,  U.S.  Director  of  National
Intelligence  (Jan.  2019)  For  the  foreseeable  future,  the  national  government  can  be
expected to continue to seek the passage and implementation of a revenue sharing law
to strengthen and encourage the development of this important sector.
Past  budget  laws  passed  by  Iraq’s  national  parliament  requiring  the  KRG  to
contribute  certain  export  earnings  in  the  country’s  overall  exports  (a  law  that  would
seem  to  validate  the  KRG’s  ownership  claims  to  Kirkuk  oil)  have  never  led  federal
authorities  to  export  Kirkuk-produced  oil.  In  so  doing,  Iraq’s  federal  authorities  have
severely limited Iraq’s northern export outlet via the Kurdish pipeline to Turkey. Breaking
the oil-stalemate that existed for years between the KRG and Iraq’s federal government
can  have  major  positive  ramifications  for  not  only  Iraq  and  its  oil  exports,  but  for  the
United States and other Western interests as well.
Terrorism and human rights issues
Despite  recent  developments  in  its  security  enforcement  efforts,  Iraq  remains  a
very  dangerous,  volatile,  and  unpredictable  country.  The  U.S.  State  Department
continues  to  strongly  warn  U.S.  citizens  against  traveling  to  Iraq.  See  Request  for
Administrative Notice, Iraq, at 3-5; Iraq Travel Advisory, U.S. Department of State (April
2022) The State Department assessed Iraq as being a critical-threat location for crime
directed at or affecting official U.S. interests. See Country Security Report at 2-3, U.S.
Dept  of  State  (Sept.  2021)  While  crime  statistics  and  crime  reporting  mechanisms  are
incomplete  and  inconsistent,  the  vast  majority  of  individuals  under  contract  with,  or
employed  by,  the  U.S.  Government  in  Iraq  are  required  to  travel  with  a  protective
security detail, so as to limit potential criminal threats against them. (id.)
Attacks against military and civilian targets throughout Iraq continue and include
sites  and  facilities  where  foreign  tourists  frequently  visit:  hotels,  restaurants,  police
stations,  check  points,  foreign  diplomatic  missions,  international  organizations,  and
other  locations  with  expatriate  personnel.  See  Request  for  Administrative  Notice,  Iraq,
supra;  Travel  Advisory-Iraq,  supra,  at  4-6.  The  U.S.  Embassy’s  ability  to  provide
consular  services  to  U.S.  citizens  outside  Baghdad  is  extremely  limited  under  the
security environment that still exists in Iraq. See Request for Administrative Notice, Iraq,
supra;  Country  Information:  Iraq,  U.S.  Department  of  State  (Nov.  2021);  Country
Security Report, supra.
Published  annual  threat  assessments  in  2022  predict  Iranian-supported  proxies
will launch attacks against  U.S.  forces and persons in  Iraq and  Syria,  and  perhaps on
other  countries  and  regions.  See  Request  for  Administrative  Notice,  Iraq,  supra,  at  5;
Annual Threat Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community, Office of the Director of
National Intelligence at 2-3 (Feb. 2022)
In  December 2015,  President  Obama  signed into  law  the  Visa Waiver  Program
Improvement and  Terrorist  Travel Protection Act  of  2015,  which  amended  the existing
Waiver Program. See Request for Administrative Notice, supra, at 4-5. Under the 2015
amendment,  citizens  of  Iran,  Iraq,  Sudan,  and  Syria  are  ineligible  to  travel  or  be
admitted  to  the  United  States  under  the  Visa  Waiver  Program.  See  Request  for
Administrative  notice,  Iraq,  supra,  at  6-7;  Visa  Waiver  Program,  U.S.  Customs  and
Border Protection (May 2022)
Iraq’s  human  rights  record  remains  a  poor  one.  Based  on  the  U.S.  State
Department’s  most  recent  annual  human  rights  report,  violence  continued  throughout
2017-2018, largely fueled by the actions of the Islamic state in Iraq (ISIS). See Request
for  Administrative  Notice,  Iraq,  supra,  at  6;  Annual  Threat  Assessment  of  the  U.S.
Intelligence  Community,  supra. After liberating  all territory taken by  ISIS by  the  end  of
2017, Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) have continued to pursue and restrict ISIS forces still
active in Iraq.
Reports  of  human  rights  abuses  also  include  allegations  of  unlawful  killings  by
some  members  of  the  ISF  (particularly  by  some  members  of  the  Popular  Mobilization
forces),  torture,  harsh  and  life-threatening  conditions  in  detention  and  prison  facilities,
criminalization of libel and other limits on freedom of expression, widespread corruption,
greatly  reduced  penalties  for  so-called  honor  killings,  coerced  or  forced  abortions
imposed by ISIS on its victims, legal restrictions imposed on the freedom of movement
of  women,  and  trafficking  in  persons.  See  Request  for  Administrative  Notice,  Iraq,
supra; Iraq 2021 Human Rights Report, supra, at 3.
Current U.S. Relations with Iraq
The  U.S.  mission  in  Iraq  remains  dedicated  to  building  a  strategic  partnership
with  Iraq  and  the  Iraqi  people.  See  U.S.  Relations  with  Iraq,  supra,  at  1-3,  In
coordination  with  the  Global Coalition  to  defeat  ISIS,  the  United  States  assisted  Iraq’s
efforts  to  achieve  the  long-sought  goal  of  liberating  all  of  Iraqi  territory  from  ISIS.  The
Strategic Framework Agreement (SFA) between Iraq and the United States provides the
basis  of  the  United  States’  bilateral  relationship  with  Iraq  and  covers  a  wide  range  of
bilateral issues, including political relations and diplomacy, defense and security, trade
and  finance,  energy,  judicial  and  law  enforcement  issues,  services,  science,  culture,
education, and environment. (id., at 2)
U.S.  bilateral  assistance   to   Iraq   is   considerable   and   stresses  economic   reform,
assistance   to   vulnerable  groups,  and   democracy  and   governance.   See   U.S.  Relations
with  Iraq, supra, at 3-4. U.S. security assistance  supports  the  development of modern,
accountable,  fiscally  sustainable,   and   professional  Iraqi  military  resources  capable   of
defending  Iraq  and  its borders.  The  United  States has designated  Iraq  as a  beneficiary
developing   country  under  the   Generalized   System   of   Preferences  Program   and   has
been  proactive  in the  promotion  of  two-way trade  between the  United  States and  Iraq.
(id.)  Iraq   is   recognized   for  its  cooperative   efforts  with   international  organizations,
including   the   United   Nations,   the   International   Monetary  Fund,  the   World   bank,  the
International  Organization   for  Migration,   the   International   Labor   Organization,   and   the
Arab   League.   (id.)   Iraq   is  also  a   candidate   for  accession   to   the   World   Trade
Organization.
Endorsements  and civic  interests
Applicant is highly regarded by U.S. military customers, supervisors, colleagues,
and friends who know him and have worked with him in his linguist assignments.  U.S.
Army officers who worked with Applicant during the Operation Iraqi Freedom campaign
lauded  his  engineering  and  linguist  contributions  to  Coalition  Forces  operating  in  Iraq,
sometimes at great personal risk to himself and his family. (AEs A-B) Worthy of special
commendation  were  Applicant’s  communicated  insights  into  the  cultural  and  political
landscape of the Iraqi sectors he was assigned to serve.
Applicant has expressed a strong interest in aiding the U.S. Refugee Admissions
Program  and  has  applied  for  admission.  (AE  I)  He  listed  himself  as  a  carpenter in  his
application.

"This is a case under Guidelines F, B, and E. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant  is  46  years  old,  married  (December  2002),  with  a  son  age  9  and  a
daughter age 11. His spouse was born in Colombia and is a citizen of Colombia and the
United States and a resident of the United States.  He attended community college from
January  2008  to  June  2012,  from  September  2014  to  December 2014,  and  from  April
2020 to June 2021. He did not earn a degree but was awarded a certificate in electronics
and troubleshooting. From February 2006 to March 2017 and from February 2018 to the
present, he has worked for the same federal defense contractor. This is his first national
security clearance investigation. He was unemployed from March 2017 to February 2018.
He explained the reason for his unemployment as follows:
My spouse, who  is from  . . . Colombia  South  America  wanted  to  return to
her home  country to  try  to  get help from  [sic] our autistic daughter  [then  five
years old]. I  did  it to  try to  get  help for my  daughter and  try to  alleviate  the
tension and strain it caused on my relationship  with my spouse  at the time.
(Ex. 3.)
Guideline   F.   Under  Guideline  F,  the  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  has  seven
delinquent  accounts  that  have  been  charged  off  or  are  in  collections  totaling  $29,037.
Those debts became delinquent between November 2017 and July 2019. (Exs. 1 and 6.)
He admitted those allegations. (Ex. 2.)
Applicant identified each of the seven accounts in his SCA. For each of the seven
delinquent accounts, he  recited as  a  reason his above  explanation  for his  one  year of
unemployment. To that explanation, he added that he let the accounts be charged off or
go into collection “as an act of desperation on our part . . . [and in] hindsight I do regret
making bad judgment to do that.” For all but one account, he stated “I am in the process
of resolving this debt.” For SOR ¶ 1.e, he stated that it was paid in full on June 11, 2021.
(Ex. 3.) With his Answer, he submitted a document showing that four of the SOR accounts
have been enrolled with a debt relief agency. That document does not show that those
accounts (which includes SOR ¶ 1.e) have been resolved. (Ex. 2.)
In Applicant’s August 2, 2021 Personal Subject Interview (PSI), he provided more
detail about his financial problems. His son was born prematurely on December 19, 2013.
As a result, his son was in a neonatal care unit from December 2013 to September 2014.
He began to work part time so he could spend time with his son in the hospital. He incurred
debts and living expenses that his part-time paycheck could not cover. His debts became
delinquent  when  he  and  his  wife  went  to  Colombia  in  March  2017  to  seek  medical
treatment for his daughter (then five years old) who was autistic. Her medical treatments
left very little money to pay bills. He is currently seeking help from a credit counseling and
consolidation agency and intends to pay his overdue bills. (Ex. 5.)
Guideline  B. Under Guideline B, the SOR alleged that Applicant’s: (1) spouse is
a dual citizen of Colombia and the United States; (2) spouse owns property in Colombia
with an approximate value of $50,000; and (3) mother-in-law, sister-in-law, and brother-
in-law  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Colombia.  (Ex.  1.)  Applicant  admitted  the  first
allegation but said that his spouse last visited Colombia in April 2019 and does not travel
there regularly. He admitted the second allegation but said his spouse only made a down
payment of $20,000. He admitted the third allegation. (Ex. 2.)
Applicant’s  last  trip  to  Colombia  was  in  2017.  The  investigation  disclosed
Applicant’s contacts with Colombia and with his Colombian mother-in-law, brother-in-law,
and sister-in-law. His mother-in-law is a homemaker. She is not employed outside of the
home.  She  has  no  connections  with  the  Colombian  government,  its  military,  or  any
business or entity owned by the Colombian government. His spouse is in telephonic or
video  chats  with  her  mother  about  weekly.  He  also  participates  briefly  in  those
communications. (Exs. 4 and 5.)
Applicant’s Colombian brother-in-law and sister-in-law are employed by the same
self-owned  software  company.  They  have  no  connections  with  the  Colombian
government, military, or any business or entity owned by the Colombian government.  He
and his spouse speak to those in-laws by telephone about weekly. None of his in-laws
receive financial support from Applicant; nor does he receive any financial support from
them. (Ex. 4 and 5.)
Applicant  explained  his  spouse’s  ownership  of  real  property  in  Colombia.  The
property was purchased in 2021. It is not important to his overall financial situation. It was
purchased to have as a place to vacation when he retires. He is still making payments to
own the home. He is not vulnerable to foreign influence because of the property. He plans
to maintain ownership, because he wants to keep the property as a  vacation home for
retirement. It is not in his name; it is in his spouse’s name, and her funds were used to
make a down payment. His earnings were not used for the purchase of the property.  (Ex.
4.)  Applicant  was  asked  why  he  purchased  this  property  having  unpaid  debts.  He
answered that it was an investment for the future. (Ex. 5.)
Guideline  E. Under Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant received written
reprimands for performance or conduct issues from his employer in February 2017, April
2019, and June 2019. (Ex. 1.) He admitted those allegations. (Ex. 2.) He discussed those
issues in his PSI.
The first incident was in February 2017. He was issued a written warning for failure
to  follow  management  expectations  for  an  absence  notification.  He  agrees  with  this
information. He failed to notify his supervisor, because he had to rush to the emergency
room (ER) with his son (then three years old). Now he sends a quick text if he is going to
miss work. His supervisor is aware of this incident. (Ex. 5.)
The second incident was in April 2019. He was issued a written warning for failure
to comply with management for not completing training within the regular time frame. He
agrees with this information. He unintentionally missed the training, because he did not
have the training assigned to complete it. He was not at fault. His supervisor is aware of
this incident. (Ex. 5.)
The third incident was in June 2019. He was  issued a written violation with one
day  of  work  without  pay,  for  failing  to  follow  policies,  procedures,  and  processes  for
checking  out  and  in  tools.  He  agrees  with  this  information.  He  was  falsely  accused  of
removing  tools  from  a  locked  area  that  he  did  not  have  access  to.  There  have  been
changes as he was not at fault. His supervisor is aware of this incident. (Ex. 5.)
Applicant did not disclose these three incidents in his SCA or in his responses to
interrogatories.  (Exs.  3  and  4.)  He  discussed  these  incidents  in  his  PSI  after  being
confronted with them by the investigator. He explained his omission as an oversight. (Ex.
5.)
Administrative Notice
The Government has requested that I take administrative notice of facts about the
Republic  of  Colombia.  (Ex.  9.)  Applicant  did  not  object  to  that  request.  Exhibit  9  is
admitted. I have taken administrative notice of the facts contained in Exhibit 9. Of note is
that Colombia is one of the oldest democracies in Latin America. The United States is
Colombia’s largest trading partner. Colombia has been plagued by transnational criminal
and narcotics trafficking organizations, terrorist organizations, and armed criminal gangs.
Colombia also continues to have human rights problems. Any person born in Colombia
may be considered a Colombian citizen, and dual U.S.- Colombian citizens are required
to present a Colombian passport to enter and exit Colombia.
Law and Policies
It  is  well  established  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.  As  the
Supreme  Court  held,  “the  clearly  consistent  standard
that  security
determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.” Department of the Navy
v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).
indicates
When   evaluating   an   applicant’s   suitability  for   a   security   clearance,   an
administrative   judge   must   consider   the   adjudicative   guidelines.   These   guidelines   are
flexible  rules of law that apply together with  common  sense  and  the  general factors of the
whole-person  concept.  An  administrative  judge  must consider all  available and  reliable
information  about  the  person,  past and  present,  favorable and  unfavorable, in making  a
decision.  The   protection   of   the   national  security  is  the   paramount   consideration.   AG  ¶
2(b)  requires  that   “[a]ny  doubt  concerning   personnel  being   considered   for  national
security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.”
Under Directive ¶  E3.1.14, the  Government must present evidence  to  establish
controverted  facts alleged  in  the  SOR. Under Directive ¶  E3.1.15,  then  the  applicant  is
responsible  for presenting  “witnesses and  other evidence  to  rebut,  explain, extenuate, or
mitigate  facts admitted  by applicant  or proven  by Department  Counsel. . ..” The  applicant
has the  ultimate  burden of persuasion in seeking a  favorable security decision.
Guideline F, Financial Considerations
",True
"The SOR alleges under Guideline B that Applicant’s two grandfathers, uncle, two
aunts, and a cousin are citizens and residents of Taiwan. Applicant admits each of these
allegations. (SOR ¶¶ 1a through 1d).  His admissions are incorporated in my findings of
fact.
Applicant  is  27  years old.  He  was born in  Taiwan. He has worked  for a  defense
contractor  since  August  2021.  He  came  to  the  United  States  with  his parents  in 1999.  His
parents live  in the  United  States and  maintain  dual citizenship with  both  countries.  He and
his parents became  U.S. citizens  in 2010. He  holds both   U.S. and  Taiwanese  passports.
His  sister  was   born   in   the   United   States   in  2000   and   resides   in   the   United   States.  He
graduated  high  school in 2015  and  received  his bachelor’s degree  in 2019.  (Item  4  at 14-
15.)
From 2014 through 2018, while he was a student, Applicant traveled each year to
Taiwan during the summer months. (Item 5 at 10.) He used his Taiwan passport to travel
to Cambodia and Japan while visiting Taiwan. (Item 4 at 5.) He has not traveled back to
Taiwan since he graduated from college in 2019. (Item 4 at 14-15 and Item 5 at 10.) He
indicated he would renew his Taiwanese passport because it made traveling to Taiwan
easier.  (Item  5  at  5.)  He  told  the  investigator  he  would  not  renounce  his  Taiwanese
citizenship because he could see himself retiring to Taiwan. (Item 5 at 4.) He went on to
state he does not know a lot about Taiwan and that he considers himself an American first
because “he has lived most of his life in the [United] States.” He added he does not have a
“strong allegiance to the Taiwan government.” (Item 5 at 4.)
During his seven trips to Taiwan, he visited the relatives alleged in the SOR. He
speaks with each relative approximately once or twice a year. He listed “by affection” in
his  interrogatory  response  for  how  he  was  bound  to  each.  (Item  5  at  10-11.)  Both  his
maternal grandfather and uncle  served  in  the  Taiwanese army.  His  grandfather was a
doctor and has since retired. His uncle served the mandatory military service time and is
also now retired. (Item 5 at 6-7.) None of the relatives alleged have any affiliation with the
Taiwan government or defense industry. (Item 5 at 10-11.)

Applicant is a U.S. citizen by birth who grew up in a military family. His wife was
born in Taiwan to Taiwanese parents. She came to the United States in 2005 for school
and  to  study  English.  They  met  on  a  dating  website  for  singles  from  their  religion  in
2006,  and  they  married  the  same  year.  She  became  a  U.S.  citizen  in  2012  while
maintaining  her  Taiwanese  citizenship.  Their  three  children  were  born  in  the  United
States.  They  are  U.S.-Taiwanese  dual  citizens.  His  wife  has  a  business  that  helps  to
coordinate  visits  of  Taiwanese  youths  to  the  United  States  and  stay  with  American
families so they can learn English and experience our culture. She is heavily involved in
her children’s activities, and she volunteers in her church and in her community. (Tr. at

Applicant’s  father-in-law  is  deceased.  His  mother-in-law  and  his  wife’s  brother,
sister, and sister’s husband are citizens and residents of Taiwan. His wife speaks with
her mother about once a week. His mother-in-law does not speak English and Applicant
does  not  speak  Mandarin,  so  their  contact  is  limited.  She  is  retired,  but  she  owns  a
building that has an apartment on the upper floor and a factory on the lower floor. She is
financially  independent,  and  there  is  no  need  for  Applicant’s  wife  to  send  her  any
support. (Tr. at 36-37, 42, 54-56, 67; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE C, D)
Applicant believes that his wife’s brother performed mandatory military service in
Taiwan.  Applicant  has  minimal  contact  with  him  because  of  the  language  barrier.  He
has not seen him since 2016, and he does not know what he does for a living. His wife
remains close to her mother, but she is no longer close to her siblings, and they rarely
talk. (Tr. at 33-35, 42, 44, 56-60, 66; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE C, D)
Applicant has minimal contact with his wife’s sister and her husband because of
the language barrier. Their children attended college in the United States at a university
close  to  where  Applicant  and  his  wife  lived  before  Applicant’s  family  moved  for  his
current  job.  He  met  his  wife’s  sister  in  Taiwan,  and  he  met  her  husband  when  he
traveled  from  Taiwan  with  his  son  to  the  university  in  the  United  States.  Applicant
believes his brother-in-law may work for the Taiwanese equivalent of the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service. (Tr. at 26-32, 42, 44, 49, 60-65, 68; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE

"Applicant admitted the allegations in the SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, and 3.a. She admitted
SOR ¶¶ 2.a through 2.c, 3.a, 3.b, 4.a, 4.b, 4.d, 4.e and 4.f with explanations. She partially
admitted and denied SOR ¶ 3.c and denied ¶ 4.c. Applicant’s admissions are incorporated
into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony,
and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  39  years old.  She  is a  high  school graduate  and  has  earned  some
college credits. She is twice married and divorced. She has four children, two from her
second  marriage  and  two from a  relationship.1 She receives child support for all of the
children.  She  has  been  employed by  a  federal contractor,  her current  employer,  since
2018. (Tr. 26-30; GE 1
Applicant’s mother is a Polish citizen who lives in Cuba. She moved  there in  1989
after  marrying   a   Cuban   national.  They  divorced   and   she   remarried   another  Cuban
national. They are no  longer married, but her mother remained  in Cuba. Applicant has
daily  contact  with   her through   a   cell   phone   application.   She   occasionally  will   send   her
money  and   medicine,   but  never  more  than   $1,000   annually.  Her   mother  receives  a
pension  from  Germany where  she  lived  and  worked  before  moving  to  Cuba.  When  her
mother moved  in 1989,  Applicant went with  her. Applicant was 15  years old when  she  left
Cuba.  Applicant  has no  intention  of  living  there  again.  Her mother worked  for a  short time
in the clothing business but has not been employed  for a long  time. Her mother  does not
have   any  direct  ties  to   the   government  of  Cuba.  Her  mother  visited   her  in  the   United
States  in approximately 2007, and  she  visited  her mother in  Cuba  in 2019.  (Tr. 30-31,  58-
59-62, 65-69, 110)
Applicant’s half-brother was born in Cuba and now lives in Germany. Their mother
was able to get him a Polish passport due to her citizenship, which allowed him to move.
Applicant did not know when he moved. He has a family and job in Germany as a train
conductor. She does not know how long her half-brother has lived in Germany. She does
not know if he is a Cuban citizen. Applicant communicates with him about once a month
through the cell phone application. (Tr. 59,63-65, 67-68)
SOR ¶ 4.f alleges and Applicant admitted that she and her husband at the time
filed  Chapter  7  bankruptcy  and  had  approximately  $45,000  of  debts  discharged  in
December 2008. (GE 13)
Applicant was arrested and charged with battery in 2008. She testified she could
not recall the facts but believed she and a person she was in a relationship with at the
time were both arrested because they had a fight. In August 2015, she was arrested and
charged  with  felony burglary of  an  occupied dwelling  and damage to  property-criminal
mischief over $200 and under $1,000. She broke a car side mirror when she was angry
at her partner for cheating on her. She was required to pay restitution. In August 2016,
Applicant was arrested and charged with felony aggravated assault-domestic violence,
and two charges of battery-domestic violence. All of the charges for these incidents were
dismissed/nolle prossed. Applicant admitted she was arrested and charged. She stated
that she was required to pay restitution for damage she did to her boyfriend’s vehicle. All
of  these  cases  stem  from  arguments  and  disagreements  with  her  ex-husband  or  ex-
boyfriend. She testified that her boyfriend told the police lies and none of the incidents
happened the way he said they did. She is no longer with either of them, and she asserted
that she has not been involved in any criminal activity since 2016. (Tr. 31-38, 70-80; GE
4, 5, 6, 7)
1 Applicant could not recall the dates of her first marriage and did not list it in her Electronic Questionnaires
for Investigation Processing (e-QIP).
Applicant admitted that in about May 2008 she received a court-issued judgment
of eviction for failure to pay rent (SOR ¶ 4.e). She explained in her SOR answer that she
and her then husband and father to two of her children decided to divorce. She was not
working  at  the  time,  and  he  was  paying  the  bills.  When  he  left,  she  remained  in  the
apartment and looked for a job. She said she paid the delinquent rent in order to move
into a new apartment. No documents were provided. (Tr. 43; Answer to SOR; GE 8)
SOR  ¶¶  4.c  and  4.d  are  also  court-issued  judgments  of  eviction  issued  against
Applicant for failure to pay rent in February 2017  ($1,100) and January 2014 ($1,100).
She denied in her SOR answer the February 2017 eviction judgment. Applicant testified
that she resolved both of these because she would have been unable to rent a new place
or  purchase  a  home  if  they  were  still  due.  She  did  not  provide  any  documents.  The
evidence supports the eviction judgments. (Tr. 41-45; GE 9, 10)
SOR ¶ 3.c alleged that in 2018 while living in an apartment, Applicant allowed an
unauthorized person, the father of her children, to live in her residence at different times,
which was against the rules of her lease. She was accused of having loud and boisterous
discussions  outside  of  her  apartment  unit.  Her  landlord  posted  a  written  notice  on  her
apartment that said her lease was not being renewed, and she was to vacate the premises
by August 10, 2018. She did not vacate on that date and her landlord filed an eviction
notice against her on August 15, 2018. (Tr. 53-54; GE 11)
In Applicant’s answer to the SOR regarding the allegation, she said that she and
her partner argued but it was never outside of the apartment. She said she went to the
rental office to renew her lease, and she was told she was not permitted to renew it. She
said she did not know why. She was aware her lease expired, and she was required to
leave  before  then.  She  said  she  was  in  the  process  of  purchasing  a  house  and  was
staying in the apartment until the lease expired. She said she was unable to pay her rent
before she moved out, but she was taking care of the debt. (Answer to SOR)
Applicant  testified  that  the  father  of  her  children  was  not  listed  on  the  lease  as
required. She said because she was in the process of purchasing a home, she was saving
her money to put a down payment on the house and was not paying her rent. She decided
to not pay the rent and instead use the money to fix her credit and make a down payment.
She figured the landlord could use her security deposit instead. She purchased the home
in July 2019. She was issued an eviction notice in July 2019. She resolved the delinquent
payments to the landlord in July 2022. At that time, she was in the process of selling her
first home and purchasing a new one. She took out a loan of $12,000 to pay some debts
to improve her credit so she would qualify to purchase a new home. She then sold her
first house and used the profits to repay the loan. She then repaid the eviction debt that
she  incurred  in  2019.  She  provided  a  document  to  show  that  she  resolved  the  2019
eviction  debt  (SOR  ¶  4.b).  The  document  she  provided  is  from  a  debt  collector.  She
testified she did not pay the debt when it was owed because she did not have the money.
She testified that she took the loan to clear her negative credit history and resolve the
financial  issues  that  were  raised  by  the  government  with  regards  to  her  public  trust
position. She contacted a company to help her resolve her debts after she received the
SOR. She did not receive any credit counseling. (Tr. 39-42, 45-47, 51-54, 98-108; GE 12;
AE D)
The debt in SOR ¶ 4.a is for a repossessed vehicle Applicant purchased for her
partner  in  2016.  It  was  repossessed  the  same  year.  Her  partner  was  to  make  the
payments.  He  did  not.  She  testified  that  she  settled  the  debt  in  September  2022  for
$1,604. She provided a document with proof of the amount paid and the debt is settled.
She  testified  that  when  she  received  notice  that  her  debts  were  a  concern  regarding
obtaining a public trust clearance she acted to resolve the debt.  (Tr. 41, 47-51; GE 14;
AE A, E)
In  January  2018,  Applicant  completed  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security
Positions (SF 86). In response to Section 22-Police Record, which asked if in the past
seven years she had been issued a summons, citation, or ticket to appear in court in a
criminal proceeding; or had been arrested by any police officer, sheriff, marshal, or any
other type of law enforcement official; or had she been charged, convicted or sentenced
to any crime in any federal, state, local, military, or non-U.S. court. Applicant responded
“No.” (GE 1)
Under  Section  26-Delinquency  Involving  Routine  Accounts-it  asked  in  the  last
seven years if Applicant was evicted for non-payment. She responded “No.” This section
was not alleged in the SOR and will not be considered for disqualifying purposes but may
be  considered  in  the  application  of  mitigating  conditions,  in  making  a  credibility
determination, and in a whole-person analysis.
Section 28 – Non-criminal court actions asked Applicant if in the last seven years
she had been a party to any public record civil court action not listed elsewhere in the
form. She responded “No.” (GE 1)
Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator  on  February  26,  2019.
Applicant  completed  government
interrogatories  on  December  3,  2020.  The
interrogatories included a copy of her subject interview with the government investigator
from  February  2019.  Questions  in  the  interrogatories  asked  if  the  subject  interview
accurately  reflected  the  information  she  provided  during  the  interview.  She  indicated
“Yes.” It asked her to identify each and every portion of the report that is not accurate and
make corrections as necessary, so the report accurately reflected her interview. She did
not make any corrections. The interrogatories also provided space to provide additional
information  regarding  matters  discussed  during  her  interviews.  She  did  not  provide
additional information. It also stated that subject to any corrections, additions, or deletions
she may have made to the report, did the investigator’s summary accurately reflect her
interview.  Applicant  responded  “Yes.”  The  interrogatories  finally  asked  subject  if  she
agreed  with  and  adopt  the  report  as  an  accurate  summary  of  her  interviews.  She
responded  “Yes.” She then  signed  the  statement  indicating that the foregoing was true
and correct and that she had read the enclosed report of her interviews and either found
the report to be accurate or she amended it so it is now accurate. (GE 2)
After being  questioned  by Department  Counsel  at  her hearing,  Applicant  testified
that she  did  not agree with  the government investigator’s summary of her interview. She
said she  did  not know how important it was to  answer the  questions correctly for her job
at the  time  she  completed  the  SF  86.  Had  she  known  how  important her job  would  be  she
would have  been  more careful. (Tr. 89-91)
During Applicant’s background interview with a government investigator, she was
asked to confirm her answer in the Police Records section of the SF 86 where she did
not  disclose  any  of  her  arrests  by  the  police.  She  confirmed  her  “no”  response  to  the
investigator.  She was then confronted with her arrest from August 2016 (as noted above).
She  told  the  investigator  that  she  omitted  this  arrest  because  she  did  not  want  her
application denied, and she did not want to be denied employment due to it. Applicant
was also confronted with the August 2015 arrest (as noted above). She gave the same
response  for  why  it  was  omitted  because  she  did  not  want  her  application  denied  or
employment denied because of it. (GE 2)
At her hearing, Applicant testified that she failed to disclose her prior arrests by the
police  in  2015  and  2016  because  she  misunderstood  the  questions,  and  she  was
confused. She said her command of the English language is not good. She said she was
not convicted and did not go to jail. During her interview with the government investigator,
she explained that after she was arrested, she spent two days in jail each time. She said
someone  sat  beside  her  when  she  completed  the  application  and  was  there  to  help
explain what the questions meant if she needed help, but Applicant did not seek help for
the questions involving whether she had been arrested. Applicant testified that she had
concerns  because  she  was  not  sure  what  to  answer.  She  said  she  told  the  Facility
Security  Officer  (FSO)  after  she  had  completed  the  application  that  she  did  not
understand some questions and may have answered incorrectly about whether she had
been arrested or convicted of an offense. Applicant said the FSO told her that it was okay
and “it happens.” (Tr. 94) She said she was not told to correct it. She said she is open
about having been arrested. She also testified that she was concerned about getting the
job. She said there was no one to help her and she was told she had to complete the
application and interrogatories by herself. (Tr. 37-39, 81-84, 93-97)
Applicant was asked why she told the government investigator that the reason she
omitted her prior arrests was because she was concerned that her application would be
denied,  and  she  would  not  get  the  job.  She  denied  she  made  this  statement  to  the
investigator. She testified that if she did not answer the questions correctly it was because
she did not understand the questions and did not understand how important it was for the
job. She testified that she needed the job and was just filling out the application as was
required. When asked why she failed to disclose under Section 28 her civil court actions
for her evictions. She  repeated  that she  did not recall  answering  “No” and  she did not
understand the question. (Tr. 85-89)
I did not find Applicant’s testimony and explanations credible for why she failed to
disclose the required information. I find she deliberately failed to disclose on her SF 86
her prior arrests and civil court actions.
Applicant testified that she has worked for five years without incident for her current
employer. She has received awards for her performance.  Applicant provided copies of
the  awards  she  has  received  from  her  employer  during  her  tenure.  She  said  she  is
financially stable. She is a single mother taking care of four children. She has worked to
make a better life for her children. She said she did not know how important her job would
be for her and if she had, she would have paid more attention to the application process.

Notice
I  have  taken  administrative  notice  of  the  following  information  concerning  the
Islamic Republic of Iran.  Iran is an authoritarian theocratic republic with a Shia Islamic
political  system.  The  supreme  leader  is  the  head  of  state  and  holds  constitutional
including  students,
authority over the judiciary, government-run media, and other key institutions.  The U.S.
Department of State travel advisory for Iran is Level 4.  Do not travel to Iran due to risk
of  kidnapping,  and  the  arbitrary  arrest  and  detention  of  U.S.  citizens.  U.S.  citizens
visiting  or  residing  in  Iran  have  been  kidnapped,  arrested,  and  detained  on  spurious
charges.  Iranian  authorities  continue  to  unjustly  detain  and  imprison  U.S.  citizens  on
spurious  charges,  particularly
journalists,
Iranian-Americans,
business travelers, and academics, on charges including espionage and posing a threat
to  national  security.  The  U.S.  government  does  not  have  diplomatic  or  consular
relations with Iran and is unable to provide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Iran.
Significant human rights issues included credible reports of unlawful or arbitrary killings
by the government and its agents, most commonly execution for crimes not meeting the
international legal standard of  “most serious crimes” or for crimes committed by juvenile
offenders, as well as after trials without due process; forced disappearance attributed to
the government and its agents; torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment by the
government  and  its  agents;  arbitrary  arrest  or  detention;  harsh  and  life-threatening
prison  conditions;  political  prisoners  and  detainees;  politically  motivated  reprisals
against  individuals  in  another  country;  including  killings  kidnappings,  or  violence,
serious  problems  with  independence  of  the  judiciary,  particularly  the  revolutionary
courts; and unlawful interference with privacy.
The  Iranian  government  has  taken  few  steps  to  identify,  investigate,  prosecute,
and  punish  officials  who  committed  human  rights  abuses  or  corruption.
Impunity
remained pervasive throughout all levels of the government and security forces.  (HE-1)

he met “[a]t a bar or on the street or restaurant or museum, wherever.” He did not have
any ongoing contact with the women after the sex. He informed his wife about the  sex
with  the  foreign  women  about  one  to  two  years  ago.  She  was  not  happy,  but  she

"Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review
of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  completed  a  security  clearance  application  (SCA)  in  March  2022  and
was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator  in  April  2022.  The  following  information
was disclosed. He is 50 years old. He was born in Colombia. As a minor, Applicant moved
to the United States in 1987 with his father, stepmother, and siblings. At some point while
a minor, he moved to Venezuela with his family. His father became a citizen of Venezuela
and by default he became one also. He moved back to Colombia in 1991 and completed
high  school  in  1993.  He  returned  to  the  United  States  in  1994  where  he  has  resided
continuously and became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 2001. (Items 4, 5)
At the time Applicant became a U.S. citizen, he held citizenships in Colombia and
Venezuela.  He  relinquished  his  Venezuelan  citizenship  because  he  had  no  loyalty  or
obligation there and did not intend to return in the future. Applicant remains a dual citizen
of the United States and Colombia because his Colombian citizenship allows him to travel
there to visit his family without having to pay for a visa. He disclosed to the investigator
that  he  only  uses  his  Colombian  passport  to  enter  and  exit  Colombia.  He  also  has
considered living in Colombia when he retires because it has a lower cost of living. He
last  obtained  a  Colombian  passport  in  2016  and  it  expires  in  2026.  A  review  of  the
passport shows he used it for travel to Colombia in 2016, 2017 and 2022. (Items 4, 5)
Applicant  disclosed  to  the  government  investigator  that  he  was  offered  a  job  to
work  on  a  high-level  military  aircraft  but  it  would  have  required  him  to  renounce  his
Colombian citizenship, so he turned the job down. He does not like being forced to do
things. He does not feel a conflict of interest between his loyalties to the United States
and Colombia. He told the investigator that he feels more American than Colombian but
he is still Colombian. He does not receive any government benefits from Colombia. He
was asked by the government investigator where his loyalty would lie in a time of conflict
between the United States and Colombia, and he responded that he did not know. He
then said he would fight for the United States because he lives here. (Item 5)
Applicant married in 2000 and divorced in 2002. His former wife was in the United
States on a student visa but overstayed when it expired. She was in the U.S. illegally at
some point. He then sponsored her to become a legal permanent resident. He told the
investigator that she eventually became a U.S. citizen. They share an adult child born in
the United States. (Items 4, 5)
Applicant remarried in 2013. They have an eight-year-old child who was born in
the United States. His wife is a citizen of Colombia. He sponsored her to enter the U.S.
in 2014. Applicant told the investigator that she  lives in the United States and has filed
the necessary documents to become a U.S. citizen. (Items 4, 5)
Applicant’s  father  is  a  dual  citizen  of  Colombia  and  Venezuela  and  resides  in
Colombia.  From  1997 to  1999,  he  was  in  prison  in  the  United  States  for  selling  illegal
drugs. Upon his release he was deported to Colombia. Applicant told the investigator he
was  not  involved  with  any  illegal  activities  with  his  father.  Once  his  father  returned  to
Colombia, he was again involved in selling drugs there. Applicant stopped communicating
with him for a period while he was involved in selling drugs. His father can never return
to  the  United  States  due  to  his  felony  conviction.  His  criminal  activity  did  not  involve
importing illegal drugs. Applicant is unaware if anyone in his life is aware of his father’s
criminal past. He told the investigator that his father is unemployed, and he sends him
about $300 a month. He is 72 years old, and it is difficult for him to find work. Applicant
speaks to his father daily and has regular electronic contact with him. (Items 4, 5)
Applicant’s mother is a citizen of Colombia and is a former government employee.
She receives retirement benefits from the Colombian government.  She is a permanent
resident of the United States.  He said she will not become a U.S. citizen because she
does not speak English. It is unknown if she travels to Colombia. He has daily contact
with her. (Items 4, 5)
Applicant’s  stepfather  is  a  citizen  of  Colombia  and  a  permanent  resident  of  the
United States. Applicant stated that his stepfather intends on becoming a U.S. citizen. He
has daily contact with him. (Items 4, 5)
Applicant has two half-sisters who are citizens of Colombia. He believes one lives
in Italy, and he has no contact with her but is friends with her on Facebook. The other is
a student in Colombia. He last had contact with her in December 2021.  He has seven
half-brothers. Five live in the United States, and he believes three are dual citizens of the
United States and Colombia. He does not know the others’ immigration status. He has
infrequent contact with them. He has two half-brothers who are citizens and residents of
Colombia. He has contact with them on holidays and birthdays. His last contact with them
was 2021. (Item 5)
Applicant  has  two  uncles,  two  aunts,  and  four  cousins  who  are  citizens  and
residents of Colombia. He maintains regular contact with them all, varying between about
three to four times a week, once a month, once every three to four months, or a couple
of times a year. (Item 5)
Applicant’s mother-in-law and father-in-law are citizens and residents of Colombia.
He has weekly telephone and electronic contact with them. His father-in-law is employed
but Applicant does not know the exact job he holds. His mother-in-law is a housewife. It
is unknown how much contact his wife has with her parents. (Items 4, 5)
Applicant’s  brother-in-law  and   two   sisters-in-law  are  citizens   and   residents   of
Colombia. Her  brother-in-law works for the National Police. His sisters-in-law work in the
private  sector. Applicant’s wife  has daily contact with  her brother-in-law and  one  sister-in-
law and weekly contact with the other  sister-in-law. (Item 5)
Applicant  and  his  wife  own  a  home  in  Colombia  with  an  approximate  value  of
$40,000. He and his wife purchased it in 2016 for about $20,000. They owe about $10,000
on  the  mortgage.  His  cousin  rents  the  house  from  them.  When  his  cousin  moves,  he
intends to sell the house. His wife has a bank account in Colombia that is used to manage
the finances related to the house. His uncle has a power of attorney related to the house.
He also uses this account to provide his father financial support. He told the government
investigator that if the house was seized it would not cause financial hardship. He did not
provide any other information about his current assets or finances. (Item 4, 5)

that  child  pornography  had  been  accessed.  (SOR  ¶  1.b,  1.b,  2.a,  3.a)  After  his  then-
employer  turned  the  matter  over  to  the  authorities,  the  county  sheriff’s  office
investigated   Applicant,  executed   a   search   warrant  at   his  residence   for   the   offense   of
child  pornography,  and  seized  numerous items of electronic and  digital media. He  was
not  arrested.  A  December   2016   letter  from   the   state’s  attorney   states,   “Forensic
analysis  of  the   items  seized   from   his  home   revealed   images   of   evidentiary  value.”   It
further  reflects  that  the   state   informed   Applicant  that  it   was  “willing   to   forego   a
prosecution   if   Applicant  forfeited   any  claim,  rights,   and   possessory  interest   in  the
offending  items.”  Applicant  was never charged  with  a  crime.  (Tr. at  73-88,  95-100,  108-
111, 113-114; GE  1-3;  AE A-D, F)
Applicant  denied   ever   viewing   child   pornography.  He   also   denied   accessing
illegal content on  his company computer. He  admitted  to  viewing  adult  pornography on
his  personal  computer  beginning   in  1995,  when   he   was  living   in  the   United   States
without  his then-spouse, and  he  saved  a  personal collection  of  it  onto  his personal USB
hard   disc.  He   stopped   viewing   and   downloading   adult  pornography  in  2000,  after  his
then-spouse  moved  to  the  United   States, and  he  had  not  accessed  his  USB  hard disc
containing   such   content  since   that   time.   In   2015,  when   he   used   his  USB   hard   disc   to
back  up   files  from   his  company  computer,   due   to   issues  with   company  laptops  dying,
software   crashing,  and   the   company’s   failure  to   provide   employees   with   storage
devices,   he   forgot  that  he   had   adult  pornography  on   his  USB   hard  disc.  He
acknowledged   that  he   should  have   used   an   empty  USB,  and   he   was  aware   of  the
company  policy  against   viewing   pornography  on   his work computer.  (Tr.  at  73-88,  95-
100, 108-111,  113-114; GE  1-3;  AE A-D, F)
Applicant had no previous  unfavorable incidents  with this employer, and he has
not  had  any  unfavorable  incidents  since,  to  include  with  his  current  employer.  He
expressed  remorse  for  his  actions  and  stated  that  he  learned  his  lesson  not  to  use  a
personal  device  on  his  company  computer  and  to  follow  company  policies.  He  also
stated  that  he  timely  completes  annual  training  with  his  employer,  and  he  follows  his
employer’s  policies  and  procedures.  (Tr.  at 73-88, 95-100,  108-111,  113-114;  GE  1-3;
AE A-D, F)
Applicant’s  manager,  and  coworker  since  2018,  described  Applicant  in  her
January 2022 letter, as a dedicated employee and  asset. A coworker of approximately
seven  years  also  described  him  as  a  hard-working  and  dedicated  employee.  Three
former  coworkers,  who  are  also  close  friends  of  Applicant,  attested  to  his  reliability,
trustworthiness,  and  work  ethic.  Applicant’s  spouse,  and  his  adult  child,  attested  to
Applicant’s  character,  describing  him  as  honest,  trustworthy,  personable,  and  a  good
family man. He received favorable performance evaluations from his employer in 2020
and 2021. (Tr. at 115-132; AE G, R-S, U-Y, CC, DD)
China
China  is  an  authoritarian  state  in  which  the  Chinese  Communist  Party  is  the
paramount  authority.  Communist  Party  members  hold  almost  all  top  government  and
security apparatus positions.
China has rapidly become more assertive, and it is the only competitor potentially
capable  of  combining  its  economic,  diplomatic,  military,  and  technological  power  to
mount  a  sustained  challenge  to  a  stable  and  open  international  system.  It  will  remain
the  top  threat  to  U.S.  technological  competitiveness  as  its  government  targets  key
sectors and proprietary commercial and military technology from the United States and
allied  companies  and  institutions.  It  uses  a  variety  of  tools,  from  public  investment  to
espionage, to advance its technological capabilities.
China’s National Intelligence Law of 2017 forms the baseline of the modern data
collection  regime,  and  compels  all  Chinese  firms  and  entities  to  support,  assist,  and
cooperate  with  Chinese  intelligence  services,  creating  a  legal  obligation  for  those
entities to turn over data collected abroad and domestically. It has expansive efforts in
place  to  acquire  U.S.  technology,  to  include  sensitive  trade  secrets  and  proprietary
information.
China’s  intelligence  services,  as  well  as  private  companies  and  other  entities,
frequently seek to exploit Chinese citizens or persons with family ties to China who can
use their insider access to corporate networks to steal secrets using removable media
devices or email. Most Chinese cyber operations against U.S. private industry that have
been  detected  are  focused  on  cleared  defense  contractors  or  information  technology
and  communications  firms  whose  products  and  services  support  government  and
private sector networks worldwide.
Multiple  U.S.  criminal  indictments  since  2015  involve  Chinese  nationals,
naturalized  U.S.  citizens  or  permanent  resident  aliens  from  China,  and  U.S.  citizens,
procuring  and  exporting  controlled  items  to China.  China’s  efforts to  acquire  sensitive,
dual-use,  or  military-grade  equipment  included  radiation  hardened  integrated  circuits,
monolithic microwave integrated circuits, accelerometers, gyroscopes, naval and marine
technologies,  syntactic
trade  secrets,  space  communications,  military
jamming  equipment,  dynamic  random-access  memory,  aviation
communication
technologies,  and  anti-submarine  warfare  technologies.  About  80%  of  all  economic
espionage prosecutions brought by the U.S. Department of Justice allege conduct that
would  benefit  the  Chinese  state,  and  there  is  at  least  some  nexus  to  China  in  around
60% of all trade secret theft cases.
foam
The  U.S.  Department  of  State  reported  that  in  2021,  significant  human  rights
issues  in  China  included:  arbitrary  or  unlawful  killings,  forced  disappearances,  torture,
and  arbitrary  detention  by  the  Chinese  government;  harsh  and  life-threatening  prison
and  detention  conditions;  political  prisoners;  politically  motivated  reprisal  against
individuals  outside  the  country;  the  lack  of  an  independent  judiciary  and  Communist
Party  control  over  the  judicial  and  legal  system;  arbitrary  interference  with  privacy,
including  pervasive  and  intrusive  technical  surveillance  and  monitoring;  punishment  of
family  members  for  offenses  allegedly  committed  by  an  individual;  serious  restrictions
on free expression, the press, and the internet; serious restrictions on internet freedom;
substantial  interference  with  the  freedom  of  peaceful  assembly  and  freedom  of
association;  severe  restrictions  and  suppression  of  religious  freedom;  substantial
restrictions  on  freedom  of  movement;  refoulement  of  asylum  seekers  to  North  Korea;
the  inability  of  citizens  to  choose  their  government  peacefully  through  free  and  fair
elections;  serious  restrictions  on  political  participation;  serious  acts  of  government
corruption;  forced  sterilization  and  coerced  abortions;  trafficking  in  persons;  severe
restrictions on labor rights; and child labor. Since the imposition of the National Security
Law  on  June  30,  2020,  China  unilaterally  and  arbitrarily  exercises  police  and  security
power in Hong Kong.
In  2019,  China’s  response  to  terrorism  remained  difficult  to  distinguish  from  the
government’s  suppression  of  peaceful  activities  that  authorities  deemed  separatist  or
subversive in nature. Details about alleged terrorism-related incidents inside China were
difficulty  to  verify  due  to  a  lack  of  transparency  and  information  from  Chinese
authorities.  As  in  2018,  Chinese  officials  continued  to  claim  that  no  violent  terrorist
incidents  have  occurred  in  the  country  since  2016,  owing  to  the  government’s  “new
counter-extremism policies,” to justify Beijing’s repressive campaign in Xinjiang.
The  U.S. Department of  State  in  April 2022  rated  China  as Level 3: Reconsider
Travel to  China  and  Hong  Kong, due  to  arbitrary enforcement of local laws and  COVID-
19  related  restrictions, and  it ordered  the  departure  of non-emergency U.S. Government
employees   and   all   family  members  from   the   Consulate   General  Shanghai  consular
district,  due   to   a   surge   in  COVID-19   cases   and   the   impact  of   restrictions  related   to
China’s response.
",True
"The SOR alleges foreign influence security concerns based on Applicant’s family
members and friends in Iraq. In her Answer, Applicant admitted all of the allegations. After
a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings
of fact:
Applicant  is  42  years old.  She  was  born  in Baghdad,  Iraq.  In  March  2003,  U.S.
forces  invaded  Iraq  vowing  to  destroy  Iraqi weapons  of  mass  destruction  and  end  the
dictatorial rule of Saddam Hussein. Applicant and her husband were Iraqi citizens, and
they had a young son and two daughters. In early 2006, Applicant’s husband worked for
the  United  States  forces  in  Iraq  as  a  local  hire  Arabic  linguist.  After  working  for  a  few
months,  he  was  killed  by  an  improvised  explosive  device  while  he  was  performing his
duties  as  a  translator.  At  that  time,  Applicant  was  23  years-old  and  had  three  young
children.  In  2008,  she  applied  for  refugee  status  in  the  United  States.  In  2010,  she
received approximately $442,000 of life insurance money from the U.S. Army following
the death of her husband. She placed the insurance proceeds into an Iraqi bank account.
She  arrived  in  the  U.S.  in  September  2012  with  her  children,  and  she  became  a
naturalized U.S. citizen in December 2017. Her son and two daughters, now ages 22, 18
and 17 respectively, reside with Applicant in her home. They are U.S. citizens. (GE 1-3;
Tr. 17-18, 24, 27-30, 41-45, 51)
In 2021, Applicant applied to work for a government contractor as a linguist. She
was  offered  a  job,  but  her  employment  is  contingent  on  her  obtaining  a  DOD  security
clearance. She decided to apply for this position because her children are older and can
take care of themselves. She does not consider herself to be a dual citizen and claims
allegiance to the United States only.  She currently works for a company in Iraq that is
similar to Amazon. Her friend owns the company, and she is paid $3,400 per month as
an employee. Applicant ships items from the U.S. to  the  company’s customers in Iraq.
The owner, originally from Iraq, is a U.S. citizen living in the U.S. (GE 1 and 2; Tr. 59-61)
From September 2012 to September 2020, (actually late 2019), Applicant received
approximately $3,000 to $4,000 monthly from her father in Baghdad, Iraq. (SOR ¶ 1.g)
The money was sent to her via Western Union. The monthly payments were from the life
insurance  payout  of  $442,000  she  received  in  2010  and  deposited  into  an  Iraqi  bank
account. In 2018 Applicant's sister provided her with $20,000; and in 2019, Applicant’s
friend sent her $23,000, and another friend sent her $4,000. Applicant had just purchased
a home in 2018 and opened a small convenience store in 2019. (SOR ¶¶ 1.h - 1.j) All of
the money sent to Applicant was money provided to her as an insurance settlement for
her husband’s death. Applicant’s father was retired and restricted in the amount of money
he  could  send  to  Applicant  without  causing  problems.  Her  son  testified  that  others
stepped  in,  like  her  sister  and  Applicant’s  friends,  to  help  with  the  wire  transfers  so
Applicant could purchase the home and the business, which later failed. The remainder
of the insurance proceeds were used up in late 2019. (Tr. 27-33, 44-48, 59)
Applicant’s father is a citizen and resident of Iraq. (SOR ¶ 1.a) She communicates
with him on a weekly basis. He is a retired supervisor of a chemical plant. She disclosed
her father on her August 2021 SCA. During her September 2021 background interview,
Applicant was asked by an investigator if other than her father, did she have any other
family  members or  foreign  contacts  to  report.  Applicant initially  stated  she  did  not,  but
then  she  mentioned  her sister,  who  is also  a  citizen  and  resident  of  Iraq.  (SOR  ¶  1.c)
Applicant has contact with her sister on a weekly basis. Her sister is unemployed, and
Applicant  was  unsure  of  her  sister’s  spouse’s  occupation.  Applicant  reported  another
sister living in Sweden, but she had not had contact with this sister in the last 15 years.
Applicant  also  has  a  brother  living  in  Sweden,  unemployed,  and  in  the  process  of
obtaining his Swedish citizenship. (SOR ¶ 1.b) She communicates with him about every
three months. (GE 1-3; Tr. 23-24, 48)
Applicant  also  disclosed  to  the  investigator  that  she  has  a  stepsister  who  is  a
citizen and resident of Iraq. The stepsister lives with her father and attends high school.
Her stepmother is a citizen and resident of Iraq, also living with her father. (SOR ¶ 1.d)
She works in elder care, and Applicant does not have much contact with her unless she
is staying at her father’s home during her trips to Iraq. Applicant has two brothers who are
citizens and residents of Iraq. (SOR ¶ 1.c) She has a brother who is employed by the Iraqi
Army, but she does not know if he is an officer or if he works in a civilian position. (SOR
¶ 1.e) She does not communicate often with this brother. Another brother is a police officer
in Iraq, and they communicate with each other on a sporadic basis, monthly to quarterly.
(SOR ¶ 1.f) Both brothers have served their mandatory conscript miliary service in Iraq.
(GE 1-3; Tr. 24-25, 50-52)
On Applicant’s deceased husband’s side  of the family, his mother, two brothers
and two sisters are citizens and residents of Iraq. The two brothers are appliance repair
electricians, one sister is a nurse, and the other  sister is an accountant. Applicant has
approximately 16 nieces and nephews. Applicant has limited contact with her nieces and
nephews. (Tr. 19-23, 52)
Applicant traveled to Iraq to visit family in July 2018, December 2018, April 2019,
January 2020, November 2020, May 2021, December 2021, June 2022, and August of
2022. She testified that since August 2022, she has travelled to Iraq on  approximately
four  other  occasions.  Since  the  insurance  money  was  depleted  in  about  late  2019,
Applicant’s  son  and  her  current  employer  have  paid  for  her  trips  to  Iraq.  Post-hearing
submission  of  her  U.S.  passport  and  a  review  of  the  travel  stamps  therein  support
Applicant’s  testimony that she has travelled to Iraq  on multiple occasions since August
2022. (Tr. 26, 50-52, 59; AE A)
Administrative Notice
I have taken administrative notice of the following facts concerning Iraq:
The  Federal Republic of Iraq  (Iraq) is a  constitutional parliamentary republic. The
U.S. Department of State  warns  U.S. citizens not to  travel to  Iraq  due  to  terrorism  and
armed  conflict. U.S. citizens in  Iraq  are at high  risk for violence  and  kidnapping.  Numerous
terrorist and  insurgent  groups are active  in Iraq  and  regularly attack both  Iraqi security
forces  and   civilians.   The   Islamic  State   in   Iraq   and   Syria   (ISIS),  a   designated   terrorist
organization,   remains  a   threat   to  public   safety  in Iraq.   Additionally, criminal gangs and
local militia pose  a  potential threat to  U.S. citizens. In  February 2022, the  U.S. Director of
National Intelligence  (DNI) concluded  that,  given  the  ongoing  presence  of  ISIS  and  Iraqi
Shia  militias, Iraq will likely face a lengthy period of political turmoil and conflict. (AN I)
Iraq’s  most  significant  human  rights  abuses  are  largely  fueled  by  the  terrorist
activities of ISIS; however, some Iraqi security forces were alleged to have engaged in
unlawful  killings,  disappearances  and  extortion,  torture,  life-threatening  conditions  in
detention and prison facilities, and arbitrary arrest and detention. (AN I)
The United States’ commitment to Iraq is balanced against the inherent dangers
of the ongoing conflict in Iraq to its citizens and residents from terrorists and significant
human rights issues. (AN 1)

"Applicant was born in the South Korea in 1972. His parents, now deceased, were
South Korean citizens. He graduated from high school in 1990 in South Korea. He met
his future wife in 1990, while in high school. He has had no further formal education in
South Korea, but he took some college courses in the United States. Applicant’s father
immigrated to the United States and initiated Applicant’s immigration papers. He entered
the United States in 1992, and he promised his wife that he would return to South Korea
to be with her. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in January 1994. His MOS was aviation. He
served in the United States until November 1995 when he was reassigned to a position
he requested in South Korea. He explained that the Army needed him to serve in South
Korea. In 1996, he married his high school girlfriend, a South Korean citizen and resident,
in  South  Korea.  They  have  three  children  who  were  born  in  South  Korea  in  1999  and
2004 (twins). Applicant wrote in the e-QIP that his children are U.S. citizens. In April 2001,
Applicant was honorably discharged from the Army. He has lived in South Korea since
then. In 2011 he began working as an aircraft mechanic for a DoD contractor in South
Korea. He has not previously held a security clearance. He is seeking national security
eligibility in connection with his employment. (Tr. at 24-26, 32-35, 43-45, 50-51, 56; 79;
GE 1 at 7-19, 24-27, 35.)
For a period, Applicant returned to the United States for an Army Medical Board
due to a back injury, but then he returned to continue his service in South Korea in about
1998 to be with his wife. Applicant became a U.S. citizen in 2000. He claimed in the e-
QIP that he is not a dual  citizen of the U.S. and South Korea, but rather is only a U.S
citizen. He claimed that he signed a paper to renounce his South Korean citizenship. He
and his wife has traveled  to the United States  for  three short periods  so that  she may
qualify for a resident alien card. (Tr. at 46-49; GE 1 at 8-9.)
Applicant’s work commute takes about 90 minutes to two hours each way. He gets
up at 4:30 am and returns home at 6:30 or 7:00 pm. He describes himself as “just a normal
daddy, 51 years old, overweight, and losing hair.” As a result of his work and commuting
schedule, he does not socialize with anyone at work. He admitted that, with English as
his  secondary  language,  he  has  difficulty  with  certain  words  and  struggles  sometimes
with an English dictionary. (Tr. at 26-27.)
Applicant commented that one reason he would be reluctant to leave South Korea
and reside in the United States is that there is no gun violence in South Korea, whereas
he believes that the United States has significant safety issues with guns. He also noted
that he has no family other than his oldest son in the United States. He testified that at
his age, it would be difficult for him to adjust to living in a different country. (Tr. at 85.)
Paragraph 1 - Guideline B, Foreign Influence
In his Answer, Applicant admitted without explanation each of the allegations in
this paragraph of the SOR. His testimony regarding the allegations was as follows:
SOR ¶  1.a. Applicant, Resident of South Korea Since at least 2001. Applicant has
only returned to the United States since 1995 on four brief occasions. (Tr. at 43-49.)
SOR ¶ 1.b. Applicant’s Wife, Citizen and Resident of South Korea. Applicant’s wife
is from a rural part of South Korea. She is a housewife and has never worked outside of
the home. (Tr. at 26, 55; GE 1 at 9-12, 17-19.)
SOR ¶ 1.c.  Applicant’s Children, Residents of South Korea. Applicant’s oldest child
was educated in South Korean and now resides and is employed in the United States.
His twins are students in a university in South Korea, and they reside with Applicant and
his wife. (Tr. at 52-55; GE 1 at 24-27.)
SOR  ¶   1.d   Applicant’s  Mother-in-Law,  a  Citizen  and  Resident  of  South  Korea.
Applicant’s  mother-in-law  is  85  years  old  and  lives  by  herself.  His  father-in-law  is
deceased. Applicant speaks with his mother-in-law by telephone every other month and
sees her in person once a year. His wife speaks with her mother almost daily. His mother-
in-law lives about a four-hour drive from Applicant’s home. (Tr. at 26, 55, 91-92; GE 1 at
27-29.)
SOR ¶  1.e South Korean Bank Account of Applicant’s Wife. Applicant has two U.S.
bank accounts. He has one account in the United States. He has a second bank account
through DoD, which is overseas. His paycheck is deposited in the DoD bank account as
U.S. dollars. He withdraws the deposit as cash. His wife then converts the U.S. dollars to
South  Korea’s currency  and deposits the cash in her South Korean bank account. His
wife also manages their household finances. The  funds in his wife’s account  represent
almost all of their assets. (Tr. at 57-59, 63.)
Applicant also has a South Korean bank account, but he has limited funds in that
account and intends to close it. He opened this account before he became a U.S. citizen.
He has no retirement accounts, but he does pay U.S. Social Security taxes. He does not
own his home in South Korea. (Tr. at 59-62.)
Paragraph 2 – Guideline E, Personal Conduct
SOR  ¶  2.a  Falsification  in  e-QIP  for  Failure  to  Disclose  South  Korean  Bank
Account of Applicant’s Wife. Section 20A of the e-QIP asks, “Have you, your spouse, or
legally recognized civil union/domestic partner, cohabitant, or dependent children EVER
had any foreign financial interests that someone controlled on your behalf?” (Emphasis
in  originally.)  Applicant  incorrectly  answered  “No”  to  this  question.  The  Government
alleged  in  the  SOR  that  his  negative  response  was  a  deliberate  falsification.  In  the
Answer, Applicant admitted this allegation with an explanation. He wrote that he did not
answer the e-QIP question correctly because he did not read the question carefully. He
further  explained  that  a  South  Korean  bank  account  was  necessary  in  his  country
because U.S. credit cards and U.S. dollars are not acceptable forms of payments for any
transaction in the country. (Answer at 3.)
At  the  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  he  did  not  intend  to  omit  the  information
about  the  bank  account.  He  believes  that  he  did  not  read  the  entire  question  and
misunderstood  what  the  question  was  seeking.  When  the  investigator  who  conducted
Applicant’s background interview explained the question to Applicant, he understood and
voluntarily disclosed his wife’s South Korean bank account. (Tr. at 76-79, 84.)
Character Evidence
Three  of Applicant’s long-time colleagues, including two supervisors, testified as
character witnesses. Applicant’s immediate supervisor has known Applicant for about 15
years. They have a professional and a personal relationship. He believes that Applicant
is trustworthy and reliable. He does not believe that Applicant has any conflicting loyalties
between the United States and South Korea. Applicant’s higher-level supervisor testified
that he  has  known  Applicant  for  about  15  years.  They  also  have a  professional and a
personal  relationship.  He  testified  that,  although  Applicant  lives  in  South  Korea,  his
allegiance is to the United States. A third witness, a work colleague, stated that he has
known Applicant for about 15 years.  He testified  that Applicant is “an  outstanding  guy”
and is dedicated and trustworthy. (Tr. at 35-42, 65-69, 79-83.)
South Korea
Applicant and his wife have significant contact with South Korea. Accordingly, it is
appropriate to look at the current conditions in that country. North Korea and South Korea
remain technically at war following a 1953 armistice agreement. Bilateral tensions remain
moderately  high  and  have  escalated  to  limited  confrontations  in  the  past.  In  the  last
decade, provocations by North Korea have included ballistic missile tests, nuclear tests,
and attacks on South Korea-held territory. In 2022 North Korea has test-launched almost
40 missiles. Industrial espionage remains a high-profile concern relating to South Korea
and  South  Korean  companies.  North  Korean  actors  have  increased  their  cyber
capabilities and efforts in targeting South Korea in recent years.
South Korea is overwhelmingly pro-United States. There are approximately 28,500
U.S. troops stationed in the country. Nevertheless, there have been periods of increased
anti-U.S. sentiment due to high-profile accidents and crimes committed by U.S. service
members. Some incidents have resulted in anti-U.S. protest activity.

security clearance. (Tr. at 7-8, 25-26, 29, 90-93; GE 1-2; AE I)
Before  becoming  a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen  in  2016,  Applicant  was  issued
Pakistani  passports  in  2003  and  2009,  which  expired  in  2008  and  2014,  respectively.
He  was  also  issued  a  temporary  Pakistani  passport  in  approximately  2008,  which
expired in 2009. He used his 2003 Pakistani passport to  travel to Pakistan in 2005, to
attend his siblings’ weddings. While in Pakistan, he and his first spouse divorced. He did
not use his 2008 or 2009 Pakistani passports to travel. He was issued a U.S. passport
in 2016, and it is not scheduled to expire until 2026. He used his U.S. passport to travel
to  Pakistan  in  2021.  He  renounced  his  Pakistani  citizenship  in  2022,  as  further
discussed below. (Tr. at 28-29, 58, 119, 125-126; GE 1-2; AE A, B)
In  1991,  Applicant  joined  the  Pakistani  military  to  pursue  a  college  education.
The Pakistani military covered the cost of his undergraduate tuition, provided him with a
living  stipend,  and  paid  him  a  salary.  In  return,  he  was  required  to  fulfill  a  six-year
commitment  upon  graduation.  After  obtaining  his  bachelor’s  degree  in  1994,  he
completed  military  training  and  was  commissioned  as  a  captain  in  1995.  He  also
unsuccessfully  attempted,  beginning  in  1994  and  then  every  two  to  three  years,  to
resign  from  the  Pakistani  military.  In  2003,  the  Pakistani  government  awarded  him  a
scholarship to pursue his master’s and doctorate degrees in the United States. In return,
he was required to work in Pakistan for two years. When he moved to the United States
to pursue higher education, the Pakistani military placed him on “five-year study leave”
and continued to pay him a salary. (SOR ¶ 1.f; Tr. at 27-29, 31-32, 37-57, 119-125, 134;
GE 1-2; AE A, C, D, E)
In  2008,  the  Pakistani  military  informed  Applicant  that  he  needed  to  return  to
Pakistan.  He  chose  to  remain  in  the  United  States  to  complete  his  doctorate  degree,
and the Pakistani military consequently marked him as overstaying his leave. It ceased
communication  with  him  and  terminated  his military pay. He  sent  resignation  letters  to
the  Pakistani military  in  2008, 2010,  and 2012,  but  received no  response.  In 2021, he
returned  to  Pakistan  and  paid  the  Pakistani  government  $12,000  USD  for  the  military
salary  he  received  while  studying  in  the  United  States  between  2003  and  2008.  The
Pakistani  military  consequently  accepted  his  resignation.  He  also  renounced  his
Pakistani  citizenship  and  received  a  certificate  of  renunciation  from  the  Pakistani
government in 2022. (Tr. at 27-29, 31-32, 37-57, 119-125, 134; GE 1-2; AE A, C, D, E)
Applicant’s  spouse  was  born  in  Pakistan.  They  met  and  married  when  she
immigrated  to  the  United  States  in  2011.  She  works  as  a  realtor  in  the  United  States.
She  resides  with  Applicant  and  their  10-year-old  child,  who  was  born  in  the  United
States. Applicant coaches this child’s various sports teams. Applicant’s stepchildren are
dual U.S.-Pakistani citizens residing in the United States; one was born in Pakistan and
became  a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen,  and  the  remaining  three  are  native-born  U.S.
citizens. (Tr. at 29, 90, 93, 101-102; GE 1-2)
Applicant’s 20-year-old child from his previous marriage is a resident of Pakistan.
(SOR ¶ 1.a) This child was born in the United States  and is a dual citizen of Pakistan
and  the  United  States.  When  Applicant  and  his  former  spouse  divorced  in  2005,  his
former  spouse  was  awarded  sole  custody  of  this  child  “per  Pakistan,  Islamic  rulings.”
Since then, Applicant has paid $100 USD monthly in child support to his former spouse,
through his father. Applicant expects to continue paying child support for this child until
this child gets married. During his September 2019 background interview, he indicated
that this child was a student in Pakistan, but he could not provide any further information
because he did not have any contact with this child. He testified that despite his efforts
to stay in touch with this child, his former spouse and relatives made it difficult, and so
he  eventually  ceased  contact  in  approximately  2014.  (Tr.  at  31,  58-62,  109-118,  126;
GE 1-2)
Applicant’s   mother  has  been   deceased   since   2019.   His  80-year-old  father  is  a
citizen  and  resident of Pakistan. He was commissioned  in the  Pakistani military in 1966
and retired  as a  major in 1992.  (SOR ¶  1.b)  He lives with  Applicant’s two  brothers and
their   families,   in  a   home   that   was   purchased   by  Applicant’s  brothers.   One   or   both
brothers   will   inherit  this   home.   Applicant  saw  his  father  in   Pakistan   when   he   traveled
there in 2021. He  talks to  his father once  every two  weeks, and  he  provides his father
with  $350  USD monthly in financial support.  (Tr. at 27, 29-31, 34-37, 57, 62-66, 68, 99-
100, 109-118;  122-123, 125;  GE 1-2)
Applicant’s  two  sisters  and  two  brothers  are  also  citizens  and  residents  of
Pakistan. (SOR ¶ 1.c) His sisters are housewives. His brothers work for a  bank and a
hospital,  respectively,  and  both  of  their  spouses  are  housewives.  Applicant  met  his
brothers’ spouses when he traveled to Pakistan in 2021. Applicant’s one brother-in-law,
the  spouse  of  his  older  sister,  works  for  the  Pakistani  police.  (SOR  ¶  1.e)  Applicant
testified that  he  believed  this  brother-in-law  would  be  retiring from the Pakistani police
“in  a  few  months.”  Applicant’s  other  brother-in-law,  the  spouse  of  his  younger  sister,
served  as  an  officer  in  the  Pakistani  military  (SOR  ¶  1.d).  Applicant  testified  that  this
brother-in-law retired from the Pakistani military “a couple of years back.” (Tr. at 29-31,
35, 64, 66-90; GE 1-2)
Applicant  talks  to  his  older  sister once  every  five  to  six  months  and  on  special
occasions. He also sees her once every two years, when she visits her son (Applicant’s
nephew)  who lives  in  the  United States, as further discussed  below.  Applicant  talks to
his  younger  sister  once  yearly  and  on  special  occasions.  He  saw  one  of  his  sisters
when  he  traveled  to  Pakistan  in  2021.  He  last  spoke  to  his  older  brother  in
approximately  2020  or  2021,  and  he  speaks  to  his  younger  brother  on  special
occasions.   He   does   not  have   contact  with   the   husband   of  his  older  sister.  He  met   his
other   brother-in-law  in   2005,   and   then   saw  him  again   during   his 2021   trip   to   Pakistan.
Applicant  testified  that  “they  are my sister’s husband[s] and  [we]  rarely talk.”   (Tr. at  29-
31, 35, 64, 66-90, 127; GE 1-2)
Applicant’s  mother-in-law,  three  brothers-in-law,  and  two  sisters-in-law  are  also
citizens and residents of Pakistan. (SOR ¶ 1.c) These are his spouse’s family members.
Applicant’s father-in-law has been deceased since 2019. As of the date of the hearing,
his mother-in-law was undergoing cancer treatment. He met her for the first time when
she visited him and his spouse in the United States in approximately 2014. His spouse
talks  to  her  mother  weekly,  and  he  talks  to  his  mother-in-law  on  special  occasions
through his spouse. He did not know much about his spouse’s siblings in Pakistan and
was aware only that one of his spouse’s brothers was a lawyer, and one of his spouse’s
sisters was a university teacher pursuing a doctorate degree. His spouse electronically
communicates  with  her  sisters,  and  she  infrequently  speaks  to  her  brothers.  He  saw
some of these family members during his 2021 trip to Pakistan. He testified that none of
his spouse’s family members are affiliated with the Pakistani government or military. (Tr.
at 29-31, 35, 64, 66-90, 127; GE 1-2)
Applicant’s  nephew,  the  son  of  his  eldest  sister,  is  a  citizen  of  Pakistan  who
previously resided in Pakistan. (SOR ¶ 1.c) Applicant testified that this nephew has lived
in the United States since approximately 2015. After he obtained his bachelor’s degree
in the United States, he has since worked  for a private company  in the  United States.
(Tr. at 74-77; GE 1-2)
Applicant stated  that none  of his family members in  Pakistan  are aware  that he  is
seeking   a   security  clearance.   He  stated   that   he   told   his  father  in  2019   simply  that   he
was undergoing  a  background  investigation. His family is aware  that he  is an  engineer.
He  stated  that he  would  report  to  the  proper  authorities if  any of  his  family members in
Pakistan  were contacted  by anyone  seeking  information  about him.  (Tr. at  84-86, 131-
134)
Applicant  maintained  contact  with  three  individuals  with  whom  he  served  in  the
Pakistani military who reside in Pakistan. (SOR ¶ 1.g) He met these individuals in 1991,
when  they  attended  college  together  in  Pakistan.  He  maintains  quarterly  to  monthly
electronic contact with them. He testified, “I have never had any emotional association
with any of my school fellows.” (Tr. at 31-32; GE 1)
In 2018 and 2019, Applicant had contact with a representative from the Pakistani
embassy. (SOR ¶ 1.h) His initial contact with the representative occurred at a Pakistani-
American  community  and  youth  convention  in  the  United  States.  He  had  subsequent
contact  with  the  representative  for  the  purpose  of  finding  academic  coordination
between the “Pakistani diaspora in academics in the USA and universities in Pakistan,”
through  his  non-profit  organization’s  alumni  activities,  as  further  discussed  below.  He
also  had  contact  with  another  representative  of
in
approximately 2018 and  2019. (SOR ¶ 1.i) His contact with this individual occurred at a
the  Pakistani  government
community outreach event in the United States with “local Pakistani diasporas.” He has
not since had contact with either of these individuals. (Answer; Tr. at 26-27, 32; GE 1-2)
Applicant opened a bank account in Pakistan in 1999, through which he received
his  pay  from  the  Pakistani  military.  After  the  Pakistani  military  ceased  paying  him  in
2008, this bank account carried a zero balance, and he closed the account in 2009. He
and his spouse do not own, and do not have any expectation of inheriting, any property
or assets in Pakistan. As previously discussed, Applicant has owned his  current home
in  the  United  States  since  2020.  His  combined  assets  in  the  United  States  total  just
under $1 million USD. He stated, “The USA is my home, the home of my [child] and my
wife,  and  this  is  where  I  will  be  buried.  If  I  must  continue  fighting  to  prove  that  I  have
only one home, the USA, I will continue fighting.” (Tr. at 30, 32-33, 48, 94-100, 127-131;
GE 1-2)
In 2018, Applicant co-founded a non-profit organization in the United States. The
organization  is  dedicated  to  promoting  higher  education  among  talented  and  needy
students, to include individuals who graduated from the same college in Pakistan as he
did  and  who  are  pursuing  higher  education  in  the  United  States.  He  has  since
voluntarily  served  as  one  of  its  directors.  He  received  the  President’s  Gold  Volunteer
Service award in recognition of more than 500 hours of volunteer service to the United
States in 2022. (Tr. at 26, 29, 91-92, 100-109, 127; GE 1; AE A, F, G, H)
The individual who hired and has served as Applicant’s manager since July 2019
described  Applicant  as  an  “asset  to  any  engineering  organization,”  vouching  for
Applicant’s valuable technical capability. Applicant’s former director, to whom Applicant
reported  from  2010  to  2012,  also  attested  to  Applicant’s  valued  technical  expertise.  A
professor,  for  whom  Applicant  served  as  a  graduate  teaching  assistant  and  graduate
research  assistant  between  2003  and  2010,  described  Applicant  as  trustworthy.  She
noted  that  he  received  a  graduate  award  in  2009,  and  he  was  recognized  as  a
mechanical engineering excellence teaching fellow in 2010. Applicant has authored and
co-authored numerous publications since 2010. He also filed several patents from 2013
to 2015 and was issued one such patent in 2015. (Tr. at 29; AE I)

thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  testimony,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  64-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed  with  the  defense  contractor  since  June  of  2005.  He  has  held  a  security
clearance since 2008. Applicant has a Ph.D. from an American university. He is married
to a U.S. citizen, and has two adult U.S.-born, children.  (TR at page 16 lines 4~14, at

Guideline B - Foreign Influence
1.a.  Applicant  served  as  a  finance  officer,  and  second  lieutenant,  in  the
Taiwanese  Army  from  about  1984  to  about  June  1986,  more  than  27  years  ago.  His
military service was mandatory. (TR at page 16 line 15 to page 17 line 17, and GX 1 at
page 14.)
1.b.  and  1.c. Applicant’s parents are citizens and residents  of Taiwan. They are
farmers. His father is 94 years old, and his mother is 84 years old. Applicant has nearly
daily contact with his parents by “video phone.” They are unaware of, and uninterested
in, any details about Applicant’s employment. (TR at page 27 line 11 to page 28 line 12,
at page 28 line 17 to page 29 line 9, at page 32 lines 6~15, and at page 37 line 20 to

Notice
I  take administrative  notice  of  the  following  facts  regarding  Taiwan:  Taiwan  is a
democracy led by a president and parliament selected in multiparty elections. The U.S.
approach to Taiwan has remained  consistent across decades and administrations. We
do not support Taiwan independence, but expect cross-Strait differences to be resolved
by  peaceful  means.  In  recent  years  there  have  been  multiple  cases  involving  illegal
export  of  U.S.  restricted  dual-use  or  military  technology  to  Taiwan  or  by  Taiwanese
nationals and companies.

"Applicant is a 40-year-old naturalized U.S. Citizen. He has an employment offer
from  a  U.S.  defense  contractor  that  is  conditioned  upon  his  being  granted  security
clearance eligibility.  He  anticipates that  if  he begins  working  for this  contractor, he  will
be living and working in Iraq. He was born in Iraq to Iraqi parents. He has a bachelor’s
degree from an Iraqi university. Applicant first came to the U.S in 2013 as a refugee. He
became  a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen  in  November  2018.  He  holds  both  U.S.  and  Iraqi
citizenships. He has never married and has no children. (Tr. 24-25, 28-30, 34; GE 1-3)
Applicant’s  mother   (SOR   ¶   1.a),  sister   (SOR   ¶   1.b),   brother   (SOR   ¶   1.c),   and
several  friends  are  citizens and  residents of Iraq.  His brother and  one  of these  friends
(SOR  ¶  1.d)  are teachers employed  by the  Iraqi  Ministry of Education. Applicant’s father
was  a   lieutenant   general  in  the   Iraqi   military.  He   was   killed   in   combat  in   1984.
Applicant’s   mother  owns  real  property  in  Iraq   that  she   uses   as  rental  property.   This
property is valued  at  about  $100,000.  His mother, brother, and  brother’s family  live  in a
home   on   real  property  in  Iraq   that  is  still   titled   in  his  father’s  name.  This  property  is
valued   at  about  $600,000.  Applicant  shares   an   inheritance   right  among   his  other
siblings  in   the   parcel   of  land   valued  at  $600,000   (SOR   ¶   1.e).   He   also  holds a   similar
inheritance  right in  the  parcel of  land  owned  by his mother.  In  about May 2022,  he told
an  Army  investigator that he  did not want to  renounce  his Iraqi citizenship because  he
wanted   to   protect his potential ownership   rights  in the   real property   in  Iraq   titled   in  his
father’s  name   (SOR   ¶   2.a).   However,   he   testified   at  hearing   if   he   was   forced   to
renounce one of his citizenships,  he  would  renounce his Iraqi citizenship.  (Tr. 24-25, 38-

For  years,  Applicant’s  mother  received  a  pension  from  the  Iraqi government  on
behalf  of  his  father  after  he  passed  away.  She  now  receives  the  equivalent  of  social
security  income  from  the  Iraqi  government.  Applicant  provided  his  mother  and  sister
about $300 to $400 in support a few times per year until about 2019. He testified that he
no longer sends money to his mother and sister because he cannot afford to do so. He
maintains  contact  with  his  mother  nearly  every  day  via  video  chat.  He  last  saw  her  in
person in Iraq in February 2022. (Tr. 43-48, 50-52; Answer; GE 1-3)

Applicant  has  never  been   a   member   of   the   Iraqi   military  or   worked   for   the   Iraqi
government.   Prior  to   his  arrival  in  the   U.S.,   Applicant   worked   for  a   non-governmental
organization  (NGO) in  Iraq. Since  arriving  in  the  U.S. in  2013, he  has worked  in the  U.S
as a  delivery  driver,  a  driver for  a  U.S.  based  corporation  providing  ride-hailing  services,

Applicant   has  friends  who   reside   in  the   U.S.,   but   none   of   his  family  members
reside  here. None  of  his family members hold  U.S.  citizenship  or U.S. residency  rights,
and none  of  them  have  visited  the  U.S.  Applicant owns no  real property in the  U.S.  He
claimed  his family does not  know  that he  is trying  to  obtain security  clearance  eligibility,
or  that  he   may   be   working   in  Iraq.   He  claimed   he   will   not  tell   them   if   he   does  obtain
security clearance  eligibility.  He  expressed  his  loyalty to  the  United  States. He testified
that  his  family  in  Afghanistan   could  not  be   used   to   coerce   or   intimidate   him   into
revealing  classified  information,  and  that  he  would report any  attempt  to  do  so.  (Tr. 30-

Since he arrived in the U.S. in 2013, Applicant visited Iraq in 2017 and 2021 to
2022.  He  stayed  in  Iraq  for  about  three  months  in  2017  and  for  about  14  months  in
2021.  He  stayed  in  the  house  titled  in  his  father’s  name  with  his  mother  and  brother
when he visited. He had in-person contact with  his family members and friends during
these visits. (Tr. 50-61; GE 1-3)
In HE 1, the Government included information from the U.S. Department of State
as of March 2023, about the United States' relations with Iraq and the current conditions
in  that  country.  I  take  administrative  notice  of  the  information  included  in  those
documents including, but not limited to:
The U.S. Department of State has assessed Iraq as being a high threat, “Level 4:
Do  not  travel”  location  due  to  terrorism,  kidnapping,  armed  conflict,  civil  unrest,  and
limited ability to assist U.S. citizens in country. U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high risk for
violence  and  kidnapping.  Terrorist  and  insurgent  groups  regularly  attack  both  Iraqi
security  forces  and  civilians.  Anti-U.S.  sectarian  militias  threaten  U.S.  citizens  and
Western companies throughout Iraq. Attacks using improvised explosive devices (IEDs)
occur in many areas of the country, including Baghdad. Demonstrations, protests, and
strikes  occur  frequently.  These  events  can  develop  quickly  without  prior  notification,
often  interrupting  traffic,  transportation,  and  other  services;  such  events  have  the
potential to turn violent.
The   country   experienced   large-scale  protests  in  Baghdad   and   several  Shia-
majority  provinces  beginning   in  2019   and   lasting   through   2022,  with   reports  of  more
than 500 civilians killed and 20,000 or more injured. Another, similar incident in August
2022 resulted in more than 20 deaths. The government took minimal steps to bring to
justice those responsible for the violence.
Terrorist groups  and  those  inspired  by such  organizations are  intent  on  attacking
U.S.  citizens abroad.  Primary  terrorist  threats  within   Iraq   included  Islamic State   in Iraq
and   Syria   (ISIS)  and   Iran-aligned   militia  groups.  ISIS   is  a   designated   terrorist
organization,  which  is active  in  Syria  and  near the  Iraq  border.   ISIS  and  its  associated
terrorist  groups  indiscriminately   commit   attacks  and   violent   atrocities  in   Iraq   despite
improved  Iraqi government control. ISIS, militia groups, and  criminal gangs target  U.S.
citizens for attacks and hostage-taking.
There  have  been  significant  human  rights  issues  in  Iraq,  including:  credible
reports of unlawful or arbitrary  killings;  extrajudicial killings and forced disappearances
by  the  government;  torture  and  cruel,  inhumane,  and  degrading  treatment  by  the
government; and arbitrary arrest and detention.

contractors  since  2015.  He  has  held  a  security  clearance  since  about  2015.  He
attended college for a period without earning a degree. He has never married, and he
has no children. (Tr.1 at 19-20, 32-33, 62; GE 1, 3, 4; AE F, I-M)
Sometime before 2015, Applicant met a woman (Ms. A) on Facebook who was a
citizen  and  resident  of  Ethiopia.  They  were  friends  who  regularly  communicated  by
electronic  means  but  were  not  in  a  romantic  relationship.  It  is  unclear  when  Applicant
met her because he gave differing times: 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014. He stated
that  he  met  her  when  he  was  working  for  a  specific  employer.  He  reported  on  his
October 2014 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) that he worked for
that  employer  from  March  2002  to  May  2012.  I  believe  he  met  her  online  in  2012  or
earlier. (Tr.1 at 29, 39-40; Tr.2 at 28-32, 40-42; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3; AE

Applicant  reported  in  the  October  2014  SF  86  that  he  started  working  for  a
defense contractor in September 2014. He was sponsored by the defense contractor to
work  overseas,  but  he  had  not  started  working  yet.  He  reported  that  he  had  a  vehicle
repossessed  in  2014.  He  indicated  the  matter  was  resolved  because  he  returned  the
vehicle. He did not report any foreign contacts. (GE 4)
Applicant was interviewed for his background investigation in January 2015.  He
stated that he was supposed to start work for the contractor at the end of January 2015,
and he was scheduled to work overseas. He did not discuss any foreign contacts. (GE
5)
Applicant  started  working  overseas  for  a  defense  contractor  in  2015.  At  some
point his relationship with Ms. A changed, and he felt they were in a boyfriend-girlfriend
relationship.  He  stated  that  occurred  in  late  December  2014.  He  visited  Ms.  A  in
Ethiopia  on  three  to  four  occasions.  The  exact  dates  are  unclear.  A  background
investigator viewed Applicant’s passport in August 2021. It revealed that Applicant had
30-day  visas  to  Ethiopia  in  August  2015,  March  2016,  December  2016,  and  August
2017.  The report of investigation noted that there were five 30-day visas and reported
the same visa from December 2016 twice. It is possible that this was an error, and that
the last visa was from December 2017. The investigator reported that there were other
visas,  and  entry  and  exit  stamps  in  the  passport,  but  they  were  illegible.  Applicant
admitted that he traveled to Ethiopia three to four times, with the last trip in December
2016 or 2017. He traveled to India for tourism in 2017. (Tr1. at 19, 40, 42-43, 66; Tr.2 at
14, 28-30, 37-39; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 3; AE C, D, F)
Applicant  sent  money  to  Ms. A. He  stated  that she  was unemployed,  and  he  sent
her  $100  every  month for about one  and a half years to pay her rent.  He also stated that
he  sent her around  $7,000  to  $8,000  for a  medical issue. He estimated  that he  sent  her
about $12,000  to $13,000  total. He sent the money through Western  Union, and  he  also
sent money to  his mother in the  United  States by Western  Union.  He  and Ms.  A  broke
up   in  about  2017.  He has  had   no  further contact  with  her,  and   he   has  not  returned   to
Ethiopia  since  they  broke  up. (Tr.1  at 29-31,  40-46,  72-73; Tr.2  at 33-36,  43-44, 48, 54-
55; Applicant’s response  to  SOR; GE 3; AE  C)
Applicant  met  another  Ethiopian  citizen  (Ms.  B)  online.  He  gave  conflicting
information  about  when  he  met  her.  In  his  SOR  response,  he  stated  that  he  met  her
online before he went to work overseas in 2015. He later testified that he met her online
after his first trip to Ethiopia. He considered her a pen pal. He visited her and her family
during  one of  his trips to  Ethiopia. She  worked  for an  airline.  They maintain  electronic
communication,  and  he  met  her  in  Dubai  a  few  times  when  they  were  both  traveling
through. She  now lives  in  Spain. They are friends only,  with no  romantic  interests. He
sent  her about  $1,500.  Part of  that  was a  wedding  gift  for her sister,  and part  went  to
pay her back for helping him when he was in Ethiopia. (Tr.1 at 29-31, 41, 54-60; Tr.2 at
45-46; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2; AE A)
Applicant submitted another SF 86 in May 2021. There were many inaccuracies
in  the  questionnaire,  including  his  education,  employment  history,  and  work  location
overseas. He answered “no” to questions in the foreign section that asked:
Section 19 - Foreign Contacts
A foreign national is defined as any person who is not a citizen or national
of the U.S.
Do  you   have,  or  have   you   had,   close   and/or  continuing   contact   with   a
foreign   national  within the   last seven   (7) years   with   whom   you,  or your
spouse,  or  legally  recognized   civil  union/domestic  partner,  or  cohabitant
are  bound   by   affection,  influence,  common   interests,  and/or  obligation?
Include  associates as well as relatives, not  previously listed in Section 18.
Section 20A  –  Foreign  Activities
Foreign Financial Interests - Foreign National Support
Have you EVER provided financial support for any foreign national?
Section 20C  – Foreign  Travel
Have you traveled outside the U.S. in the last seven (7) years?
The answers to the above questions were all false because in the previous seven
years, Applicant had  close  and continuing contact with Ms. A; he financially supported
Ms. A; and he traveled for personal reasons to Ethiopia and India.
Applicant  was  interviewed  for  his  background  investigation  in  July  2021.  He
stated that he traveled to Ethiopia in December 2016 to January 2017 for 20 to 30 days
to visit his foreign girlfriend, Ms. A. He stated that he traveled to India in August 2017 for
6 to 10 days for tourism. He stated that he did not report his foreign travel because he
forgot  about  it,  and  he  thought  all  his  foreign  travel  was  for  government  business.  He
discussed  the  funds  he  sent  to  Ms.  A  after  the  investigator  questioned  him  about  the
transactions.  He  stated  that  his  relationship  with  Ms.  A  ended  in  December  2017
because  things  did  not  work  out,  she  was  lazy,  and  he  was  embarrassed  by  the
relationship. He also discussed his relationship with Ms. B. (Tr.1 at 43; GE 3)
Applicant  denied  intentionally  providing  false  information  on  the  2014  and  2021
SF  86s.  He  stated  in  his  response  to  the  SOR  that  he  did  not  list  Ms.  A  and  Ms.  B
because  he  did  not  consider  them  to  be  foreign  nationals.  His  illogical  argument  was
that if he knew them before he needed a security clearance then “I wouldn’t call those
people foreign national[s] because I knew them in a different setting, and they were my
friend[s].” (Tr.1 at 36-39; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 3)
Applicant stated that he did not list Ms. A on the 2014 SF 86 because they were
just  friends  at  that  time.  (Tr.1  at  29;  AE  I) I am  not  convinced  by substantial  evidence
that Applicant intentionally provided false information on that questionnaire.1
Applicant testified that information from the 2014 SF 86 did not repopulate in the
2021 SF 86, and he had to complete the 2021 questionnaire “from scratch.” He did not
have all the  information  to fill  it out,  but he did  the  best he could.  He  admitted that he
“probably just  pencil-whipped  it  and  guessed  just  to  submit  it.”  He  stated  that  he  filled
out another SF 86 in 2020 or 2022 that had the correct information. He did not submit a
copy  of  a  third  SF  86,  and  Department  Counsel  was  unable  to  locate  one.  There  are
many  identical phrases  in  the  2014  and  2021  SF 86s  (see  e.g.,  sections  11,  13A,  16,
and 18). I find that the 2021 SF 86 repopulated with information from  the 2014 SF 86.
(Tr.1 at 21-25, 37; Tr.2 at 37; AE H)
Applicant stated that he did not list his foreign travel on the 2021 SF 86 because
he was living overseas  at the time and was traveling to  a lot of countries for work. He
also stated that he was living on a U.S. military installation, so he thought of it like it was
part of the United States. He did not think about his trips to Ethiopia and India when he
filled  out  the  SF  86,  but  he  let  his  company  security  manager  know  about  the  trips
before and after he took them  and that he was going to visit his girlfriend.  A coworker
confirmed  that  it  was  required  to  inform  security  about  any  leave  taken  to  foreign
countries.  The  coworker  wrote  that  he  and  other  employees  knew  that  Applicant  was
going to Ethiopia to meet a Facebook friend. (Tr.1 at 34-39, 50, 62-63; Tr.2 at 17-25, 40;
AE D, E, I, J)
Applicant stated  that he  did not list Ms. A  on  the  2021  SF 86  because  he  did not
consider  a   friend   to   be   a   foreign   national.  He  stated   that  he   did   not   list  her  and   the
financial support he  provided  her because  the  SF 86  said  to  only go  back  seven  years.
He  stated  that he  was  done  with  her and  no  longer wanted  to  think about her. He was
adamant  he   discussed   her   during   his  background   interview   in  2015.  He  stated   “[t]hat
man   sent   me   a   copy   of  our  interview  and   in   that   interview  I   told   him   about   [Ms.   A].”
There is  nothing  in the  ROI  of  the  2015  interview about  Ms.  A.  He  testified  that he  broke
up   with   her  because   he   was  embarrassed   by  the   relationship   because   she   was   lazy,
and   she   did  not  grow.   Department  Counsel  then   asked.”   Do  you   think  maybe   that
embarrassment  might be  why  you  didn’t  mention  her on  your electronic questionnaire?”
to  which  Applicant  replied, “Probably so, honestly, being  honest  with  you.”   (Tr.1  at 43-
44, 47-50, 63-64, 72-73; Tr.2  at 26-27, 37, 44, 55-56; Applicant’s response  to  SOR; GE
1-3; AE  G, I, K)
1  Substantial   evidence  is   “such  relevant  evidence  as   a  reasonable  mind   might   accept  as   adequate  to
support a conclusion in light of  all  the  contrary  evidence in the same  record.” See, e.g.,  ISCR  Case  No.
17-04166   at  3  (App.  Bd.  Mar.  21,  2019)   (citing  Directive  ¶   E3.1.32.1).   “This   is   something   less   than  the
weight  of  the   evidence,  and   the  possibility   of  drawing   two  inconsistent  conclusions   from   the   evidence
does  not prevent [a Judge’s]  finding  from   being  supported by  substantial  evidence.”  Consolo v.  Federal
Maritime  Comm’n,  383  U.S. 607,  620 (1966).  “Substantial  evidence” is  “more than  a  scintilla  but  less  than
a preponderance.”  See v. Washington  Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36  F.3d  375,  380  (4th  Cir. 1994);  ISCR
Case No.  04-07187  at  5 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2006).
I  did  not  find  Applicant  credible.  After  considering  all  the  evidence,  including
Applicant’s  age,  education,  experience,  admissions,  inconsistent  responses,  and  the
illogical  rationale  for  the  incorrect  information  on  the  2021  SF  86,  I  find  by  substantial
evidence  that  he  intentionally  provided  false  information  on  the  2021  SF  86,  as
discussed further in the analysis.

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, she admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.g.
Her admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 28-year-old systems analyst employed by a defense contractor since
August 2022. She was born in Colombia, entered the United States in August 2012, and
became a U.S. citizen in March 2018. She was employed full time in private sector jobs
in  the  United  States  from  April  2013  until  she  was  hired  for  her  current  position.  She
received an associate degree  in May 2018 and  a bachelor’s degree  in May 2021, both
from educational institutions in the United States. She aspires to obtain a master’s degree
in the United States and advance to greater responsibility with her current employer. (Tr.
39) She  has never married  and  has no  children. She  has never held  a  security clearance.
Applicant is an only child. Her parents are citizens and residents of Colombia. Her
father was a permanent resident of the United States from 1999 to 2017, when he moved
back to Colombia, hoping to work as a truck driver. However, he has been unable to find
work. Her mother has never worked outside the home.
Applicant’s  parents  have  never  married.  (Tr.  20)  Her  paternal  grandmother  is  a
citizen  of  Colombia  and  was  a  permanent  resident  of  the  United  States  until  recently,
when she became a U.S. citizen. (Tr. 23) Her maternal grandmother is deceased. (Tr. 23)
Applicant’s  maternal aunts and cousins are citizens and residents of Colombia, except
for one cousin, who is a permanent resident of the United States. Her paternal aunts and
cousins are dual citizens of Colombia and the United States, and they currently live in the
United States. Applicant lives with one of her paternal aunts. (Tr. 18) None of Applicant’s
relatives have worked for the Colombian government or military. (Tr. 28)
Applicant  provides  monthly  support  of  about  $340  to  her  parents. She  provides
occasional money gifts to her grandmother totaling about $200.
Applicant travels to  Colombia  every one  or two  years to  visit her family. She  carries
her U.S.  passport and  her Colombian  passport when  she  travels to  and  from  Colombia.
The  Colombian  immigration  authorities require  her to  use  her Colombian  passport to  enter
and  exit Colombia.  She  uses her U.S. passport to  enter and  exit the  United  States.  She
testified  that when  she  reenters the  United  States, the  immigration  authorities scan  her
U.S. passport and stamp  her Colombian passport.
Applicant voted in the last Colombian election in June 2022. She testified that she
and her family did not like the candidate who  won, and they all cast their votes for his
opponent because she did not want Colombia to become like Venezuela. (Tr. 32)  She
testified  that  she  did  not  think  that  voting  in  the  Colombian  election  was  a  “big  deal,”
because she is a dual citizen. (Tr. 32) She cast her vote at a Colombian consulate in the
United States. (Tr. 33) She also voted in the last presidential election in the United States,
as well as the local elections.(Tr. 38)
Applicant testified that if she had to choose between being a citizen of the United
States or a citizen of Colombia, she would choose the United States. (Tr. 35) She does
not envision returning to Colombia to live. She testified, “I always would say Colombia is
awesome to go to visit, it is awesome to go for a few weeks, relax, but it is too messy,
and I don’t like that, and I prefer to feel safe.” (Tr. 36)
Colombia  is a  constitutional, multiparty republic.  The presidential and legislative
elections  held  in  2022  were  considered  by  observers  to  be  the  most  free,  fair,  and
peaceful in decades. Columbia has endured a decades-long conflict between government
forces, paramilitaries, and antigovernment insurgent groups heavily funded by the drug
trade, principally the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). The Colombian
government  signed  a  peace  accord  with  the  FARC  in  2016,  which  was  ratified  by  the
Colombian Congress.
In November 2021, the U.S. Secretary of State revoked the designation of FARC
as  a  foreign  terrorist  organization  and  designated  the  Segunda  Marquetalia  and  the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia-People’s Army (FARC-EP) as foreign terrorist
organizations. These organizations, along with the National Liberation Army (ELN), have
been filling the void left by former FARC combatants.
The U.S. Department of State has issued a Level 3 Travel Advisory for Colombia
(“Reconsider travel due  to  crime  and terrorism;  exercise  increased caution  due  to  civil
unrest and kidnapping”). It has issued a Level 4 advisory (“Do not travel”) for the Arauca,
Cauca  (excluding  Popayan),  and  Norte  de  Santander  departments  and  the  Colombia-
Venezuela border region due to crime, kidnapping, and risk of detention when crossing
into Venezuela from Colombia. Applicant’s parents live in the Cauca department. (AX A

"Applicant is a 26-year-old U.S. citizen. He was born in the United States in 1997.
In  1998,  when  he  was one  year old,  his parents moved  with  him  to  Poland,  where  he
has resided ever since. He became a naturalized Polish citizen in 2006. Since at least
2015, he has resided with his parents. In 2021, he obtained a bachelor’s degree from a
Polish university. He was scheduled to obtain a master’s degree from a Polish university
in  July 2023,  but  the  record  is not  clear  as  to  whether he  did  so.  His  classes  for  both
these degrees were funded by the Polish government. Since 2016, he has worked for a
Polish  company  located  in  Poland.  He  has  an  employment  offer  from  a  U.S.  defense
contractor. He has a Polish fiancée, whom he planned to marry in August 2023, but his
current marital status is unclear. He has no children. (Items 2-4)
Applicant’s father holds U.S. and Polish citizenships. His mother holds U.S. and
Ukrainian  citizenships.  Prior  to  1998,  they  lived  in  the  United  States  for  20  years,  but
after 1998, they have resided in Poland. Applicant’s fiancée is a citizen and resident of
Poland. He and his fiancée plan on living in Poland once they are married. He has two
older brothers who are citizens of the United States and Poland and reside in Poland.
There  is no  evidence that he has  anything other than a close familial  relationship with
his  parents,  siblings,  and  fiancée.  His  closest  friends  are  also  citizens  and  resident  of
Poland. (Items 2-4)

In  February  2023,  when  he  submitted  his  Electronic  Questionnaire
Investigations Processing (SF 86), he reported that he holds a Polish passport that was
valid from October 2013 until October 2023. Between August 2014 and January 2023,
he  reported  that  he  traveled  extensively  using  this  Polish  passport.  He  also  traveled
extensively using an earlier Polish passport that expired in 2016. He holds a valid U.S.
passport that expires in 2025. Earlier, he held a U.S. passport that expired in 2016. He
had traveled using his current U.S. passport once when he visited the United States in
2019,  and  his  now  expired  U.S.  passport  when  he  visited  the  U.S.  in  2015.  He  also
used a U.S. passport to travel prior to obtaining Polish citizenship in 2006. (Items 3, 4)
Applicant  has  never  been  a  member  of  the  Polish  military.  However,  he  has
received education and healthcare benefits from the Polish government. He has voted
in both Polish and U.S. elections. There is no evidence that he owns any real property
in either the United States or Poland. He claimed that he has some family in the United
States, but he did not specify who they are or their relation to him.  He and his fiancée
visited his family in the United States once on an undisclosed date. He claimed that he
is  involved  in  U.S.  civic  and  community  organizations  such  as  the  Ukrainian  Orthodox
Church  of  the  USA.  He  acknowledged  that  he  has  few  friends  in  the  United  States.

In  Item  5,  the  Government  included  information  from  the  U.S.  Department  of
State  as  of  September  2023,  about  the  United  States'  relations  with  Poland  and  the
current conditions in that country. I take administrative notice of the information included
in those documents including, but not limited to:
The  United  States  and  Poland  are  longstanding,  staunch  allies  and  are  both
members  of  the  North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organization  (NATO).  They  partner  closely  on
policies  involving  counterterrorism,  human  rights,  nonproliferation,  economic  growth,
and energy security. The United States and Poland are involved in regular and recurring
joint military exercises. Poland has a stable government, and it is a party to a bilateral
agreement on business and economic relations with the United States. (Item 5)

"Applicant  is a  55-year-old  married  man  with  two adult  children.  He  has  been  married
to  his current wife  since  2015. A  previous marriage  ended  in  divorce  in  2013. (GE 1  at 43-
44)  Applicant earned  a  high  school diploma  in 1986  and  an  associate  degree  in 2006. (GE
1 at 15)
Applicant is a veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps, serving from 1986 to 1990.  (Tr. 27)
He  was  discharged  honorably.  After  leaving  the  Marines,  he  joined  the  U.S.  State
Department as a security officer until 1992. (Tr. 28) That year, he joined the U.S. Border
Patrol where he worked until his retirement in 2019. (Tr. 33) While with the Border Patrol,
he spearheaded an interrogation technique which over the years has become a national
model.  (Tr.  30)  Since  retiring,  Applicant  has  been  working  abroad  for  a  contractor
performing  technical  service  work  on  non-intrusive  inspection  systems.  (Tr.  53)  Since
working at his current job, he has received excellent performance ratings. (GE 8 at 11)
In 2006, Applicant, while not on duty or in his work uniform, entered a grocery in a
rural  part of  the  country  to  buy  beer. Although  Applicant  had  no  hard  evidence  of  any
wrongdoing, he began questioning the grocery store clerk about his immigration status, his
foreign  accent,  and  why  he  was  living  in  that  part  of  the  country.  (GE  8  at  21)  These
questions angered the clerk, prompting him to ask Applicant to leave the store. While this
exchange was occurring, another store patron called the police. (GE 8 at 22) During the
tense  exchange  of  words,  Applicant  followed  the  clerk  behind  the  counter  and  put  his
hands on him. The clerk then fell down, whereupon Applicant pulled his service weapon
and pointed it at the clerk, claiming that the clerk had lunged for one of the knives on the
counter. (GE 8 at 22) One of the store patrons then stepped between Applicant and the
clerk, prompting Applicant to place his weapon back in the holster. (GE 14 at 23)
This episode led to an agency investigation. The investigation revealed that after the
episode Applicant had run queries on himself and the grocery store clerk in the Border
Patrol database without authorization. (GE 8 at 14, 23) When confronted about the misuse
of the database, Applicant offered conflicting stories. (GE 8 at 23)
When the investigation was concluded, its findings were submitted to the agency’s
disciplinary review board. It charged Applicant with conduct unbecoming a border patrol
agent,  lack  of  candor,  and  misuse  of  the  database  system,  and  it  recommended  his
termination. (GE 8 at 15)
The first-level reviewing authority sustained the recommendation for termination.
(GE 8 at 15) On appeal, an arbitrator  sustained the charges of conduct unbecoming a
border  patrol  agent  and  misuse  of  the  database,  and  lack  of  candor  with  respect  to
questions about the database. In doing so, the hearing officer concluded that Applicant
“had no operational reason [for initiating] a volatile and dangerous altercation.” (GE 6 at 14)
However, he concluded that removal was not a reasonable remedy. (GE 8 at 24) Instead,
the reviewing authority reduced the punishment to suspension of 180 days with restoration
of payment that had been stopped after the termination. (GE 8 at 25-27)
In March 2010, Applicant while driving his marked Border Patrol vehicle, called local
police to ask if they had a unit in his location because the motorist behind him was riding
his bumper while traveling 80 miles per hour. (GE 8 at 31) He told the police dispatcher that
he wanted to pull the driver over and “chew her tail out,” and the dispatcher approved. (GE
8 at 32) He then pulled the driver over. Immediately after the stop, the driver called Border
Patrol and reported that Applicant was rude, irate, and made her fear for her safety. (GE 8
at 32) Later that month, Applicant pulled over a Latino motorist whom he suspected was an
illegal alien. (GE 8 at 34) After questioning him, Applicant released him, concluding that he
had no authority to interrogate him further. (GE 8 at 30) Applicant’s employer, however,
reprimanded him for not making a warrantless arrest, not asking the man for his name or
driver’s license, and not promptly reporting the investigative stop to Applicant’s chain of
command. (GE 8 at 30)
Later that year, the agency considered the motorist’s complaint, and the unrelated
incident involving his release of the Latino driver without more intensive interrogation, and
charged  Applicant  with  unprofessional  conduct,  consequently  removing  him  from
employment, effective March 2011. (GE 8 at 28) On appeal, the Merit Systems Protection
Board (MSPB) , in April 2012, sustained the charge of unprofessional conduct, with respect
to the episode with the female driver, but characterized it as “a relatively minor infraction,”
and reduced the punishment from termination to a 14-day suspension without pay, credited
from the pay he did not receive while the appeal was pending.  (GE 8 at 33-34) In addition,
the MSPB concluded the charge involving the Latino motorist was not sustained. (GE 8 at
31)
On November 2, 2012, Applicant was charged with failure to exercise due caution in
the  operation  of  a  government-owned  vehicle  after  accidentally  backing  his  assigned
vehicle  into  a  tree  while  exiting  a  parking  lot.  (GE  8  at  91)  On  November  29,  2012,
Applicant while on duty and in uniform went into a gun shop for personal reasons, and
while inside the store questioned a customer, an Asian-American, about his immigration
status. (GE 8 at 91) He allegedly followed the person around the store for a half an hour.
(GE 8 at 91) Subsequently on December 26, 2013, the agency charged him with failure to
exercise due caution for the car incident, conduct unbecoming an officer for the gun store
incident,  as  well  as  lack  of  candor,  and  misuse  of  information  systems  for  two  related
matters, and fired him. (GE 8 at 91)
Applicant  subsequently  filed  a  grievance.  (GE  4  at  6)  At  arbitration,  Applicant’s
attorney characterized the proceedings as a witch hunt. The arbitrator agreed, emphatically
rejecting the agency’s case, noting in his decision that Applicant’s employer was “out to get
[him] no matter what.” (GE 8 at 123) Moreover, the arbitrator concluded that the agency’s
incident  report  of  the  gun  shop  episode  was  exaggerated,  admonishing  Applicant’s
employer that “hyperboles, particularly when not verified, do nothing more than present a
tainted  picture  of  the  event  and  inflame  management’s  perception.”  (GE  3  at  118)
Ultimately on June 12, 2015, the arbitrator dismissed all the charges other than the one
involving the accident with the government-owned vehicle and reduced the penalty from
removal to a 30-day suspension. (GE 8 at 125). Applicant was on paid administrative leave
for six months while this case was being adjudicated. (GE 4 at 6)
In 2011, Applicant was selected to work as a lead advisor on border patrol control
issues in a combat zone abroad. (Tr. 35) He worked at this assignment through 2012. In
2016, Applicant was promoted to the position of temporary supervisor.  (Tr. 59) His duties
included training other agents on how to properly conduct investigations. (Tr. 31) He retired
in  2018.  (Tr.  31)  Between  1996  to  2005,  all  of  Applicant’s  performance  ratings  were
outstanding. (GE 8 at 101) In 2006, the Border Patrol agency’s evaluation system changed
to “Pass/Fail.” From 2006 to 2018 when Applicant retired, he received passing evaluations.
According to Applicant’s current team leader for the past year, he is “a vital part of
[their] day-to-day operation,” and he has never had any reason to question his integrity or
work ethic since Applicant has been working for him. (AE D)
During  the  beginning  of  a  security  clearance  interview  in  July  2017,  Applicant
refused to provide full and frank answers to questions. Instead, he referred the agent to his
attorney and repeatedly interrupted her. (Tr. 45-46) He did not want to talk about the issues
involving past termination decisions because each decision had been reversed. (GE 4 at 6)
On July 12, 2017, he sent 16 unsolicited text messages to the investigator, contending that
the investigation had “crossed the civil liability line,” and threatening litigation. (Answer at 2)
Applicant contends that he sent these texts out of frustration with the process. (Answer at
2)
In   July  2019,  the   DCSA   CAS  contacted  Applicant,  explained   the   information
requested  was  relevant  and  material to  his security  clearance  determination,  and  gave  him
another  opportunity  to   cooperate   with   the   investigation,   warning   that   continued   failure
would  result  in   discontinuation   of   his   case.   (GE   3   at  1)   On   December  2019,  Applicant
completed  an  affidavit setting  forth  his intention  to  fully  discuss  the  relevant  information  with
the  investigator. On  January 2020, he  again  contacted  DCSA  CAS,  apologized  for the
lengthy delay in  responding  and explained  that  he  did not think there was any just  cause  to
discuss  his past terminations  since  he  had  been  reinstated  after each  termination.  (GE  4  at
8)  In   February  2021,  Applicant  answered   another  set  of  interrogatories.   He   provided
comprehensive interrogatory responses  with  multiple  documents  attached.  (GE 8)
During a personal subject interview in 2002, Applicant refused to answer questions
about an alleged adverse incident and acknowledged the potential harm his refusal to offer
details would have on the maintenance of his security clearance. (GE 12)
In 2005, Applicant’s employer transferred him to another part of the country. His wife
stayed in their home with the children, refusing to move. For the next eight years, Applicant
supported two households. (Tr. 120) As the only breadwinner, Applicant’s finances became
strained, and he gradually became reliant upon credit cards to pay bills. (Tr. 59) In addition,
Applicant’s marriage deteriorated, leading to a divorce in 2013. (Tr. 59)
In February 2018, Applicant filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy. (GE 9) He converted
this bankruptcy to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in September 2018. The amount discharged is
unclear from the record.
Applicant did not file his federal income tax returns for 2018 and 2019 until August
2022. (AE C at 3) According to a certified tax preparer whom he retained in 2019, and who
testified, the delay occurred because of the length of time that it took to obtain an individual
tax identification number (ITIN) for his current wife, a citizen and resident of Kuwait who
was in the process of becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen during this time. (See foreign
influence section of Decision, infra). (Tr. 133, 135) Applicant has filed his 2018 tax return,
and is due a refund of $3,102 and he filed his 2019 federal tax bill and paid the amount
due, totaling $459. (GE C at 2; Tr. 70)
Applicant owes tax delinquencies for tax year 2014 and tax year 2015. (AE A at 2-4;
GE 7 at 3) These debts were triggered after an audit of these tax years concluded that he
erroneously claimed the foreign income exemption on his tax returns. (Tr. 90) When the
IRS  initially  recalculated  the  tax  debt,  it  concluded  that  Applicant  owed  an  additional
$40,000 for tax years 2014 and 2015.  (Tr. 90) Applicant appealed this decision to a tax
court, arguing that the foreign earned income exclusion applied because he worked abroad
for both of those tax years. (Tr. 89; GE 1 at 19) Although he lost the appeal, he successfully
negotiated a reduction in the balance.  (AE A at 2-4) Currently, he owes $4,529 for tax year
2014 and $15,924 for tax year 2015. (AE A at 2-4)
Three  weeks  before  the  hearing,  Applicant  made  two  payments  totaling  $500
towards the reduction of the tax delinquency. (Tr. 90; AE B at 1) In 2020, Applicant retained
his current tax preparer. (AE H, Attachment (Att.) B at 3) With the tax preparer’s help, he
amended the 2014 and 2015 tax return, Also, the tax preparer helped him with his 2018
and 2019 tax returns to account the ITIN request for Applicant’s spouse. (AE H, Att. B at 3)
The tax preparer attributes the delays in resolving the tax issues to incorrect information
regarding  Applicant’s  employment  and  income,  and  correspondence  delays  that  were
exacerbated  by  the  pandemic.  (Tr.  111)  With  the  tax  preparer’s  assistance,  Applicant
requested and was approved for the IRS Combat Zone exemption, which was extended to
civilians working in combat zones as part of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (the Act).
(AE H, Att. B at 3) Per the tax preparer Applicant’s tax liabilities will be stayed so long as he
remains employed in this combat zone, and he will get 180 days to resolve his income tax
problems once he leaves the combat zone. (AE H Att. B at 3)
Recently, Applicant received a $20,000 refund for an overpayment on his 2022 tax
return. (Tr. 119) Currently, Applicant earns $140,000 per year, he saves $500 monthly; he
has a savings account balance of between $5,000 and $6,000; and he receives retirement
pension payments. (Tr. 102)
Applicant’s current wife is a citizen and resident of Kuwait. She spent the majority of
her childhood living in the United Kingdom. (Tr. 18) Applicant met her through an online
dating  app  in  2014,  and  they  married  in  2015.  (GE  4  at  8)  She  is  the  head  of  the
department for the Kuwait Ministry of Health. (Answer at 2) Applicant’s wife has been a
naturalized U.S. citizen since August 2022. (Tr. 47; AE E at 2) Applicant is living in Kuwait
with his wife. Hs goal is to move back to the U.S. with his wife in the next two to three
years. (Tr. 112)
Applicant’s father-in-law is deceased. His mother-in-law, a citizen and resident of
Kuwait, is a homemaker. (Tr. 115; GE 4 at 9) Applicant sees her approximately once per
week.
Applicant is not particularly fond  of his siblings-in-law, characterizing  them  as “limp
wristed, sheltered,  and  entitled.”  (Tr.  117)  Applicant’s brother-in-law  is  a  citizen  and  resident
of Kuwait. He is a  retired  oil  company executive. Applicant does not interact  with  him. (Tr.
116)   Applicant  has   three   sisters-in-law.  (Tr.   116)  Two   of  them   work  for  government
ministries.  (Tr.  116)  Applicant  talks  with   the   two   who   work  for  government  ministries
approximately once  per week. (Tr.  115; Answer at  3)  He  does  not interact  with  his  third
sister-in-law. (Tr. 116)
Kuwait  and  the  United  States  have  enjoyed  a  long  history  of  friendship  and
cooperation, “rooted in shared values, democratic traditions, and institutional relationships.”
(HE  I  at  1)  Kuwait  is  an  important  partner  in  U.S.  counterterrorism  efforts.  The  United
States is one of Kuwait’s largest suppliers of goods and services, and Kuwait is one of the
United States’ largest markets in the Middle East. (HE I at 2)

"Applicant  is  a  48-year-old  systems  engineer  employed  by  a  defense  contractor
since January 2006. He received a security clearance in December 2013. (FORM Item 4)
He is a native-born U.S. citizen. In January 2000, he married a naturalized U.S. citizen
who was born in the Philippines, and they have two children, ages 16 and 12, who were
born in the United States.
Applicant’s  father-in-law  and  mother-in-law  are  citizens  and  residents  of  the
Philippines.  His  father-in-law  is  self-employed  in  an  engineering  and  trading  business.
The record does not reflect the occupation, if any, of his mother-in-law. His brother-in-law
is  a  dual  U.S.-Philippine  citizen,  residing  in  the  Philippines  and  serving  as  an  elected
official of a province, similar to a county commissioner in the United States. Applicant’s
in-laws all reside in a northern province of the Philippines. He states that his wife and her
brother  are  estranged,  but  he  provided  no  details  of  the  nature  or  reasons  for  their
estrangement.
In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he stated that he and his father-in-law do not
speak, “as it is our nature.” He and his mother-in-law “cordially greet each other” when
his wife talks with her mother. He declared that he has no meaningful contact with his in-
laws, and he has no emotional ties to them. His wife speaks with her mother weekly, her
father monthly, and her estranged brother quarterly.
The  Philippines  is  a  multi-party,  constitutional  republic  with  a  bicameral  legislature.
The United States recognized the Philippines as an independent state and established
diplomatic relations in 1946. The United States has designated the Philippines as a major
non-NATO ally, and there are close and abiding security ties between the two nations,
based on strong historical and cultural links and a shared commitment to democracy and
human rights. The Manila Declaration of 2011 reaffirmed the 1951 U.S. Philippines Mutual
Defense  Treaty  as  the  foundation  for  a  robust,  balanced,  and  responsive  security
partnership. The U.S.-Philippine Bilateral Strategic Dialogue (BSD) is an annual forum for
forward planning across the spectrum of the relationship. The most recent BSD was in
January  2023,  when  senior  Philippine  and  U.S.  foreign  affairs  and  defense  officials
convened in Manila. There is no evidence that the Philippines engages in economic or
military intelligence activity directed toward the United States.
The United States is among the Philippines’ top trading partners, and it traditionally
has been the Philippines’ largest foreign investor. The United States and the Philippines
have a bilateral trade and investment framework and a tax treaty. Philippine imports from
the  United  States  include  raw  and  semi-processed  materials  for  the  manufacture  of
semiconductors, electronics and electrical machinery, transport equipment, cereals, and
cereal preparations.
Philippine national elections  have  been generally  free  and  fair,  but  independent
observers  have  noted  widespread  vote  buying,  and  dynastic  political  families  have
monopolized elective offices at the national and local level.
The  most  significant  human  rights  problems  in  the  Philippines  are  extrajudicial
killings, enforced disappearances undertaken by security forces and vigilante groups, a
weak and overburdened criminal justice system, widespread official corruption and abuse
of power, and impunity from prosecution for human rights abuses.  Other human rights
problems  include prisoner and detainee torture  and  abuse by  security  forces,  violence
and  harassment  against  human  rights  activists  by  security  forces,  warrantless  arrests,
lengthy pretrial detentions, poor prison conditions, killings and harassment of journalists,
violence  against  women,  abuse  and  sexual  exploitation  of  children,  and  trafficking  in
persons.
More  than  four  million  Filipino-Americans  live  in  the  United  States,  and  almost
300,000 U.S. citizens reside in the Philippines, including a large number of U.S. military
veterans. Additionally, Manila is home to the only Veterans Administration regional office
outside the United States, and the American Cemetery in Manila is the largest American
military cemetery outside the United States.
Muslim separatists, communist insurgencies, and terrorist organizations are active
in  the  Philippines;  and  they  have  killed  Philippine  security  forces,  local  government
officials, and other civilians. Through joint U.S.-Philippine cooperation, the ability of these
various  groups  to  operate  in  the  Philippines  has  been  constrained  but  not  eliminated.
Gangs of kidnappers have targeted foreigners, including Filipino-Americans.
The  State Department has  issued a Level 2 travel advisory (exercise  increased
caution) for the Philippines. It has issued a Level 4 travel advisory (do not travel) for the
Sulu Archipelago and areas of Mindanao province, located in the southern Philippines,
due to the high threat of kidnapping and violent activities of terrorist and insurgent groups.
In Applicant’s response to the FORM, he attached a map of the Philippines and pointed
out that his wife’s family members live in a northern province of the Philippines, and the
Level 4 travel advisory pertains only to the Sulu Archipelago and Mindanao areas, about
640 miles away from where his wife’s family members live and work. (AX A at 1, 2, 23)
The SOR alleges that Applicant used marijuana on several occasions in October
2021,  while granted access  to  classified  information.  He admitted this  allegation  in his
answer to the SOR. He described his experience with marijuana as “fake happiness for
one hour,” followed by a return to reality. He explained that he was in deep grief after the
loss of both parents and was under stress from having tendered a resignation from his
employment  due  to  a  conflict  with  his  boss.  He  asked  his  wife  to  purchase  edible
marijuana for him, and she complied. He admitted using the marijuana more than once
during October 2021, “out of a silly notion of not wasting resources.” He returned to his
job  when  his  coworkers  and  a  new  boss  invited  him  back  before  his  resignation  was
accepted. In Applicant’s response to the FORM, he submitted a statement promising to
abstain from future illegal drug involvement and substance abuse, with the understanding
that failure to uphold his promise to abstain from drug involvement and substance abuse
will be grounds for revocation of his national security eligibility. (AX A at 2)

"Applicant  admitted  to  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b.  and  2.c.  She  denied
SOR allegations ¶¶ 2.a, and 2.b. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings,
exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  29-year-old  employee  of  the  United  Nations  (UN).  She  has  been
employed  with  the  UN  since  March  of  2020.  Applicant  is  not  married,  and  has  no
children. (TR at page 23 line 22 to page 25 line 17, and GX 1 at pages 13 and 21.)
Guideline B - Foreign Influence
1.a. Applicant admits  that,  in  the  past,  she  had  close  and  continuing  contact with
relatives who  are  citizens and  residents of  Iraq.  She  has ceased  her contact with  these
Iraqi  relatives since  receipt  of  the SOR  in June  2023. These  relatives are: her 70-year-
old  grandmother,  who   never  worked   outside   of  her  home;  her  85-year-old  grandfather
who   is  long   retired   but  never  worked   for  the   Iraqi  government;   her  45-year-old  uncle
who  is a pharmacist;  her 56-year-old uncle  who  is  a  security  guard;  her 40-year-old  aunt
who  is a  homemaker;  her 28-year-old  cousin  who  works for the  UN  in Switzerland; her
55-year-old   uncle   who   is  a   driver   for   the   UN  in  Iraq;   and   finally,   her   47-year-old   aunt
who   works  for  the   Red   Cross.   (TR   at   page   40   line   7   to   page   52   line   23.)   All   of  her
immediate  family, comprising  her parents and  siblings,  are citizens  and  residents of the
United States. (TR at page  31 lines 7~10, and GX 1 at pages 22~28.)
1.b.   Applicant  maintains  a  bank  account  in  Iraq,  with  an  approximate  value  of
$2,000.  This  bank  account  is  a  matter  of  necessity,  as  there  is  a  10%  surcharge  to
withdraw funds from a U.S. bank account in Iraq.  (TR at page 25 line 18 to page 28 line
2, at page 34 lines 21~25, at page 53 line 4 to page 54 line 3.) The Applicant’s witness,
a former FBI Agent and her UN supervisor, further explained the necessity to maintain
an Iraqi bank account for those unable to leave Iraq on occasion and bank outside the
country. (TR at page 20 line 13 to page 22 line 18.)
Guideline F - Financial Considerations
2.a.  Applicant  denies  that  she  is  indebted  to  Creditor  A  in  the  amount  of  about
$1,344.  This  debt  has  been  settled  and  paid  as  evidenced  by  Applicant’s
documentation. (TR at page 32 lines 11~17, at page 32 line 25 to page 33 line 11, and
AppX E.)
2.b.  Applicant  denies  that  she  is  indebted  to  Creditor  B  in  the  amount  of  about
$56. This debt has been paid in full as evidenced by Applicant’s documentation. (TR at
page 32 lines 18~24, at page 33 lines 12~18, and AppX F.)
2.c.  Applicant is making  the monthly payments of $150 towards her charged-off
car loan, which were agreed to by the creditor, as evidenced by documentation. (TR at
page 33 line 19 to page 34 line 5, and AppXs G and U.)
Notice
I take administrative notice of the following facts regarding the Republic of Iraq:
Iraq  is  a  constitutional  parliamentary  republic.  The  U.S.  Department  of  Sate  travel
advisory  for  Iraq  is  Level  4:  Do  not  trave!  During  2021,  the  primary  terrorist  threats
within  Iraq  included  ISIS  remnants  and  various  Iran-aligned  militia  groups.  Significant
human rights issues remain present in Iraq.

"In Applicant’s  answer to the SOR, he admitted the single allegation in the SOR.
His admission is incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a  32-year-old scientific  technician, employed  by  a  defense  contractor
since   May  2020.   He  received  a   bachelor’s degree   in  June   2014, a   master’s  degree   in
August  2019, and  a   doctorate   in  May  2021,   all   from   the   same  university  in  the   United
States.  He  is employed  as  the director  of  experimental testing at the  university  where  he
received  his education. He has never married  and  has no children.
In  Applicant’s  SCA  (FORM  Item  3),  he  reported  that  he  had  never  previously
undergone a background investigation or applied for a security clearance. He disclosed
eight foreign nationals with whom he has continuing contact, including a Russian national
who was his academic advisor for his doctoral education. He explained that there were
many foreign nationals in graduate school, and that he listed in his SCA only those with
whom he was in contact for extended periods or who are currently active friends.
Applicant stated that his advisor for part of his doctoral work was a Russian citizen.
He  continues  to  work  with  his  former  advisor  on  a  regular  basis,  because  his  current
employer collaborates on  research projects with  his former advisor’s research group  at
the  university where Applicant  received  his doctorate. He  stated  that his relationship  with
his former advisor is professional and  personal. He explained, “He  is a  mentor which  is
more  than just professional.”
Applicant  also  explained  that  his former advisor “has  always been  a  researcher
and  some  of  that  may  have  been  involved  or  affiliated  with  [the]  Russian/Soviet
government or defense since he spent his whole life in Russia until roughly 2013.” (FORM
Item 3 at 33-35) His former advisor’s biography reflects that he  received a doctorate  in
1990 and a senior doctorate in 2006 from Russian institutions. He worked in educational
institutions  in  Russia  and  was  a  department  head  at  one  of  the  institutions.  He  is
concurrently a professor at a Russian university. (FORM Item 4; FORM Item 5)
Applicant was the co-author of a few papers that his former advisor presented at
international  conferences.  (FORM  Item  41)  His  former  advisor  told  him  that  he  could
obtain a post-doctorate position for him at a European university, because he had spent
most of his career in Europe and had connections. (FORM Item 3 at 40)
When Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in April 2022, he told
the investigator that he believed his mentor was a dual U.S.-Russian citizen, but he was
not sure. He also believed that his former advisor had worked on projects with the U.S.
Air Force while he was in Russia, but he was unfamiliar with the details. (FORM Item 6 at
2-3)
The  Russian  Federation  has  a  highly  centralized,  authoritarian  political  system
dominated by President Putin. The bicameral federal assembly consists of a directedly-
elected  lower house  and  an  appointed  upper house,  both of  which lack  independence
from the executive. The 2018 presidential election and the 2021 lower house elections
were marked by accusations of government interference and manipulation of the electoral
process,  including  the  exclusion  of  meaningful  opposition  candidates.  The  Russian
government uses arbitrary designations, criminal convictions, and administrative barriers
to  disqualify  potential  opposition  candidates,  ensuring  that  no  independent  voices  can
participate in government processes.
In response to the 2014 Russian violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial
integrity,  the  United  States  suspended  the  Bilateral  Presidential  Commission,  a  body
jointly founded in 2009 by the United States and Russian to promote cooperation between
the two countries. Russia has attempted to position itself as a competitor to the United
States  by  undermining  norms  within  the  existing  international  system,  aiming  to
undermine core institutions of the West, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) and the European Union, and to weaken faith in the democratic and free-market
system.
Russia is one of the top three most aggressive and capable collectors of economic
information and technological intelligence from U.S. sources. Russia provides military and
missile  technologies  to  countries  of  security  concern,  including  China,  Iran,  Syria,  and
Venezuela. Russian military programs continue to be driven by the perception that the
United  States  and  NATO  are  its  principal  strategic  challenges  and  greatest  potential
threat.
Russia  uses  cyber  operations  as  an  instrument  of  intelligence  collection,  using
sophisticated  and  large-scale  hacking  to  collect  sensitive  information,  influence  the
political  process  in  the  United  States,  and  undermine  Euro-Atlantic  unity.  Russia  also
uses  commercial  and  academic  enterprises  that  interact  with  the  West,  recruitment  of
Russian immigrants with advanced technical skills, and penetration of public and private
enterprises to obtain sensitive technical information. The areas of highest interest include
alternative  energy,  biotechnology,  defense  technology,  environmental  protection,  high-
end  manufacturing,  and  information  and  communications  technology.  Russian  agents
have been involved in intrusions and hacking affecting U.S. citizens, corporate entities,
international organizations, and political organizations in the United States.
Relations  between   the   United   States  and   Russia   have   deteriorated   significantly
since  Russia’s invasion  of Ukraine.  The  United  States  has  imposed  sanctions on  senior
members  of  the   Russian   government  and   has  imposed   restrictions  on   the   Russian
financial system  and  its defense, aerospace, maritime,  and other strategic sections of its
government.  The   U.S.   Department  of  State   has  issued   a   Level  4   Travel  Advisory  for
Russian   (“do   not  travel”)   because   of  the   invasion   of  Ukraine   and   the   potential  for
harassment of U.S. citizens, including dual U.S. Russian nationals.
In   February   2022,   the   Office   of  the   Director  of   National   Intelligence   (ODNI)
reported   that  Russia   presents  one   of  the   most  serious  foreign   influence   threats  to   the
United   States,  using   its  intelligence   services,  proxies,  and   other  influence   tools  to
undermine  U.S. global  standing, amplify discord inside  the  United  States, and  influence
U.S. voters and  decision  making. Russia  has conducted  influence  operations against U.S.
elections for decades, including as recently as the  2020  presidential election.
ODNI  also  reported  that  Russia  considers  cyber  disruptions  as  a  foreign  policy
lever to shape other countries’ decisions, as well as a deterrence and military tool. Russia
uses commercial and academic enterprises that interact with the West, recruits Russian
immigrants with advanced technical skills, and attempts to penetrate public and private
enterprises.
Russia’s human rights record is uneven, and in some areas it is poor. The judiciary
is not independent and is subject to manipulation by political authorities. Abuses include
attacks  on  journalists,  physical  abuse  by  law  enforcement  officers,  harsh  prison
conditions, arbitrary detention, politically motivated imprisonment, electronic surveillance
without judicial permission, warrantless searches of residences and other premises, and
widespread corruption in the executive, legislative, and judicial branches.

admitted  in  full  ¶¶ 1.d-1.g  and  1.i,  1.k  and  1.l  with  explanations.  His  admissions  are
incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  47  years  old.  He  was  born  in  Armenia  in  1976,  when  it  was  still  a
republic of the Soviet Union.  In  1998,  he  completed  a  bachelor’s and  master’s degree
through  a  university  in  Armenia.  Subsequently,  from  June  1998  through  November
1999, he completed mandatory service with the Armenian army. In 2003, he completed
a  second  master’s degree. He married  in 2004  and  has two children, ages 16 and 18.
(GX 1-2; AX A; Tr. 22-31, 60-72)
From   about  April  2008   through   April  2010,   Applicant  worked   in  the   translation
center  for  the   Armenian   Ministry  of   Justice.   Later  in  2010,  he   and   his  family  received
visas  under the  DOS  Diversity Immigration  Program  and   entered  the  United  States.  In
2015, he  and  his wife  became  U.S. citizens,  and  they  purchased  a  home  in  the  United
States  for about $512,000.  His wife  is a  schoolteacher.  (GX 1-2; Tr.  21-32, 55-57, 133-
136)
Also  in  2015,  Applicant  traveled  to  Armenia  to  visit  his  parents  and  close  his
Armenian  bank  accounts.  In  2016,  his  children  became  U.S.  citizens.  Later  that  year,
Applicant sponsored his parents to become U.S. permanent residents. They have since
become  U.S.  citizens.  Applicant’s  only  sibling,  his  sister,  is  a  U.S.  citizen.  Applicant’s
mother-in-law  is  also  a  U.S.  citizen,  and  she  lives  with  Applicant’s  family.  They  are
estranged from Applicant’s father-in-law. (GX 1-2; Tr. 28-31, 65-67)
Following his entry into the United States, from August 2010 through September
2014,  Applicant  worked  for  a  U.S.  Government  organization.  From  September  2014
through  June  2021,  he  worked  in  various  positions  as  a  contractor  for  another  U.S.
Government department. Since June 2021, he has been with his sponsoring employer
as a business analyst performing contract work for DOD and another U.S. Government
department. He currently earns an annual salary of about $104,000 and does not have
any other sources of income.  He has never held a security clearance.  (GX 1-2; AX A;
Tr. 7-8, 25, 83-93, 133-134)
In  April  2022,  Applicant  renounced  his  Armenian  citizenship.  He  only  holds
financial accounts in the United States and recently sold one of the two properties that
his family  owned  in  Armenia.  (See  discussion  below) He  described  being  active  in  his
church and community as well as voting in U.S. elections. He stated he has no intention
of residing in Armenia again. (GX 1-2; AX B-D; Tr. 25-26, 31-32, 109)

The  Republic of Armenia
Armenia  declared  its  independence  from  the  Soviet  Union  in  September  1991
and  is  a  parliamentary  democracy.  The  United  States  established  diplomatic  relations
with Armenia in 1992.
Following independence, Armenia has been involved in multiple conflicts over the
years with neighboring Azerbaijan over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh. The
conflict  increased  significantly  in  2020  and  there  were  reports  that  Azerbaijani  forces
engaged  in  unlawful  killings  and  cruel,  inhuman,  or  degrading  treatment  of  Armenian
forces  during  that  time.  A  ceasefire  arrangement  was  reached  in  November  2020.
However,  in  September  2023,  Azerbaijan  launched  a  military  offensive  reasserting
control  in  the  region.  The  United  Stated  has  issued  calls  for  an  end  to  hostilities  and
unhindered  humanitarian  access  in  the  region.  (See  U.S.  State  Department,  Country
Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2022: Armenia: https://www.state.gov/reports/
2022-country-reports-on-human-rights-practices/armenia/  (March  20,  2023);   U.S.  State
Department,  Secretary  Blinken’s  Call  with   Azerbaijani   President  Aliyev:
https://www.state.gov/secretary-blinkens-call-with-azerbaijani-president-aliyev-17
(September 26, 2023))
The   Russian   government  also   assists   Armenian   security  institutions  and
Armenia’s  economy   has  become   increasingly   dependent   on   Russian   investment.
However,  Armenia  is   actively   seeking   increased   U.S.   engagement   in  support  of   its
democratic  ambitions,   economic  growth   targets,   and   improved   regional  security.   The
U.S.  role   in  Armenia   has  become   more  important  as  regional   tensions  increase
following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
The Russian Federation
The  Russian  Federation  has  a  highly  centralized  authoritarian  political  system
dominated by President Vladimir Putin. Russia presents one of the most serious foreign
threats  to  the  United  States  and  has  attempted  to  position  itself  as  a  great  power
competitor to  the  United  States  by  undermining  norms  within  the  existing  international
system.
In  February  2014,  Russia  annexed  Crimea,  claiming  the  area  to  be  part  of  the
Russian  Federation.  In  September  2022,  Russia  occupied  four  more  provinces  in
Ukraine, and in February 2022, Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine. As a
result,  the  United States  issued  numerous  sanctions  against Russian  citizens  and has
provided  aid  to  Ukraine.  DOS  issued  “Level  4  - Do  not  travel”  warnings,  for  both
countries.
Russia  also  remains a  top  cyber  threat as it refines and  employs  its espionage,
influence,   and   attack  capabilities.   Russia   views  cyber  disruptions   as   a   foreign   policy
lever  to   shape   countries’  decisions,  as  well  as  a   deterrence   and   military  tool.   Russia
remains a  hostile  country to  the  interests of the  United  States. See  ISCR  Case  No.  19-
00831 at 3 (App. Bd. July 29, 2020). Russia’s war with Ukraine is ongoing.
Ukraine
The only allegation concerning Applicant’s connections to Ukraine that make  the
facts  contained  in  AN  III  relevant  here  is  SOR  ¶  1.c,  Applicant’s  aunt  who  lived  in
Ukraine and passed away in 2020. Given the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia
(see discussion above), there is an obvious foreign influence security concern involving
Ukraine generally. However, Applicant has no current or recent connections to Ukraine
to suggest an  ongoing security concern  related to him. Therefore, I will not expand on
the facts contained in AN III about Ukraine.
It  is  well  established  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.  As  the
Supreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent standard

"Applicant is a 44-year-old, married man with one child, age 11. He was born and
raised in Lebanon. In 1996, during his senior year in high school, he immigrated to the
United States. After graduating from high school, he enrolled in a U.S. college and earned
a degree in business administration. (Tr. 17) He has been a naturalized U.S. citizen since
2002. (AE A) Currently, he works for a defense contractor, stationed overseas as a linguist
and cultural advisor. (Tr. 16) He has worked in this field for more than 15 years and has
held a security clearance since 2006. (Tr. 32; GE 1 at 8)
Throughout  Applicant’s  career,  he  has  been  highly  respected  by  his  peers  and
supervisors.  The  director  of  operations,  an  upper-level  supervisor  at  his  current
employment described his work performance as “phenomenal.” (AE L at 1) According to
Applicant’s direct supervisor, he is an “inspiring leader for the team [whose] knowledge and
understanding of cultural, ethnic, geopolitical and language skills assisted the military in
strengthening the safety and security of the deployed troops in the region.” (AE D at 3)
Moreover,  per  his  supervisor,  he  “has  proven  to  be especially  essential  at an  ongoing
series of classified regional, strategic conferences.” (AE D) Applicant is particularly skilled
at working under pressure, functioning at an extraordinarily high level during a period when
the operational tempo of the unit that he supported was at a record level. (AE D at 5)
During the course of Applicant’s career as a translator, he has worked in combat
zones escorting troops on various missions. Like the troops, he occasionally came under
fire and has had to discharge his firearm in firefights on a couple of occasions. (Tr. 34) An
intensely patriotic man, Applicant has a tattoo of an American flag on his arm. (Tr. 32)
Applicant’s wife is a citizen of Poland. (AE 1 at 27) She lives in Poland with their
daughter, a dual citizen of Poland and the United States. (Tr. 41) Applicant last saw them in
June 2022. They communicate primarily by apps approximately once per week. (Tr. 43)
Applicant  and  his  wife  are  currently  separated  but  are  “trying  to  work  it  out.”  (Tr.  39)
Applicant owns no property in Poland. (Tr. 41)
Applicant’s parents are dual citizens of Lebanon and the United States. Both parents
moved to the United States in 1992. His father obtained U.S. citizenship in 2007 and his
mother  obtained  permanent  resident  status  in  1992.  Applicant’s  mother  returned  to
Lebanon  in  2002  and  his  father  returned  to  Lebanon  in  2009.  (Tr.  49)  Both  returned
because as they aged, they began to experience more health problems, and the health
insurance is less expensive in Lebanon than the United States. (Answer at 2) Applicant
talks  to  his  mother  approximately  three  times  per  week  and  he  talks  to  his  father
approximately three to four times per year. He communicates with both parents through
WhatsApp, an internet chat application. (Answer at 1) Applicant provides his parents with
$200 per month of financial support. (Tr. 38)
Applicant has three older brothers who are citizens of Lebanon. (Tr. 29) All of them
are naturalized U.S. citizens and two of them live in the United States. (Tr. 47) He is not
close to them because they are much older than him. (Tr. 47)
The oldest of the two brothers who lives in the United States immigrated here more
than  40  years ago when Applicant was  an  infant.  Tr.  36;  GE 1 at 37) They  last  spoke
approximately ten years ago. (Tr. 36)
The younger of the two brothers living in the U.S. became a naturalized U.S. citizen
approximately18 years ago (Tr. 47) Applicant last saw him in July 2023. (Tr. 37) He does
not keep in touch with him. (Tr. 37)
Applicant’s third brother, the oldest, age 68, is a dual citizen of Lebanon and the
United States. He lives in Lebanon and splits his time between Lebanon and the United
States. (Tr. 31)  He is a retired brigadier general in the Lebanese army. (Tr. 48) He receives
a pension. (Tr. 34-35) Applicant does not keep in touch with him regularly. (Tr. 37) He last
saw him in July 2023 when he traveled to Lebanon to visit his parents. (Tr. 37)  Applicant’s
niece,  the  daughter  of  his  brother  the  retired  brigadier  general,  is  a  U.S.  citizen  and
resident. She works for the U.S. government and has a public trust position. (Tr. 32; AE Q)
Applicant’s two sisters  are citizens  and residents of Lebanon. (Answer at 2)  Like his
brothers,  they  are  much  older  than  him  and  are  not  close.  Their  contact  is   limited  too
sharing messages and greetings on birthdays  and holidays through  WhatsApp. (Answer at
3)  He sometimes sees  them when he t  ravels to Lebanon to  visit  his parents. The  last time
they  got together was in July  2023.  (Tr. 30)  Neither of  his sisters  works for the Lebanese
government. (Tr. 30)
All of Applicant’s bank accounts  are based in the United  States.  (Tr. 44)  He is not a
homeowner. (Tr. 44)  He  has been living  on a military  base abroad  since 2020. (GE  1 at  10-
11)
Poland “is a stalwart ally in Central Europe and one of the United States’ strongest
partners in fostering security and prosperity regionally, throughout Europe, and the world.”
(AE C at 1) Lebanon is a parliamentary republic which apportions governmental authority
among a Christian president, a Shia Muslim speaker of the Chambers of Deputies and a
Sunni prime minister. Violent extremist  groups,  including  U.S. government-designated,
foreign terrorist organizations such as Hizballah and ISIS train and operate in Lebanon, and
have a particularly strong presence in southern Lebanon and south Beirut. (HE IV at 145)
Hizballah  continues  to  develop  its  global  terrorist  capabilities  as  a  complement  to  the
group’s growing conventional military capabilities and seeks to reduce U.S. influence in
Lebanon and the broader Middle East and maintains the capability to target U.S. people
and interests in the region. (HE V at 31-33)

2.a  with  explanations. Her admissions  are  incorporated  into  the  findings of  fact. After a
thorough  and  careful review of the  evidence  submitted,  I  make  the  following  additional
findings of fact.
Applicant  is  34   years  old.   She   was  born  and   raised   in  Pakistan   and   completed
some  college  courses.  In  2007, through  her family’s arrangement,  she  met and  married
her  husband,   a   dual  Pakistan   and   American   citizen   residing   in   the   United   States.   In
2009, based  on  her husband’s visa petition, she  entered  the  United  States. In  January
2018,  she   naturalized   as  a   U.S.  citizen.   Applicant  and   her husband   have   two   children
who are seven and  nine  years old  and  are U.S. citizens. (GX 1-2; Tr. 20-23)
From about September 2009 through August 2019, Applicant was a homemaker.
In  September  2019,  she  obtained  employment  as  a  software  tester.  She  has  been
employed  full-time  with  her  sponsoring  employer  as  an  automation  testing  engineer
since  September  2021.  She  has  not  previously  held  a  security  clearance.  (GX  1-2;
AX N; Tr. 8)
Applicant’s husband  works as a software engineer. He emigrated from Pakistan
to  the  United  States  when  he  was  16  years  old.  Applicant’s  father-in-law,  now
deceased, previously worked for the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and brought his family to
the  United  States  in  his  retirement.  Applicant’s  mother-in-law  lives  part-time  with
Applicant’s family. (GX 1-2; Tr. 20-21, 73, 103-104)
Applicant is the oldest of four sisters. One of her sisters is a citizen and resident

The  SOR  alleges  various  foreign  influence  concerns  under  Guideline  B  and
foreign  preference  concerns  under  Guideline  C.  The  evidence  pertaining  to  the
allegations is summarized below.
SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b  allege security concerns relating to  Applicant’s mother and
father  who  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Pakistan.  Applicant  detailed  that  her  mother
previously worked as a tailor and her father previously worked as a chef.  Both are now
retired. Applicant last saw them in person in 2020 when she traveled to Pakistan  for a
month  to  help  care  for  her  mother  who  was  receiving  cancer  treatment.  Her  mother’s
condition improved, but she continues to take medication. Applicant communicates with
her mother  and  father several times  per week.  She  provided  about  $5,000  in  financial
support to them in 2003. (GX 1-2; AX H-I; Tr. 25, 28-37, 65-66)
In  about  May  2021,  Applicant  petitioned  for  her  parents  to  receive  immigrant
visas  to  the  Unites  States.  They  have  never  visited  the  United  States.  However,
Applicant testified that, since both of her sisters in Pakistan are now married and living
with their new respective families, she was intending to assume the care of her parents
in their elderly years. Also, by bringing her parents  to the United States, she would no
longer have a need to travel to Pakistan. As of the date of the hearing, the immigration
petitions for her parents had been approved. However, her parents were still required to
participate in visa interviews. Applicant was hopeful that her parents would complete the
immigration process and move to the United States sometime in 2024. (GX 2; AX D-F,
R; Tr. 27, 70-80)
SOR  ¶  1.c  alleges  security  concerns  relating  to  Applicant’s  two  sisters  who  are
citizens and residents of Pakistan. They both are married, with one wedding occurring in
2023. Neither they nor their husbands work for the Pakistani government. Applicant did
not  travel  to  Pakistan  to  attend  the  ceremony  because  she  was  concerned  it  would
impact  her  security  application.  Instead,  Applicant  estimated  that  she  provided  about
$2,000 to $3,000 in gifts. She does not regularly provide financial support to her sisters.
She communicates with her sisters every few weeks. (GX 1-2; AX J-K; Tr. 25-26, 37-46,
66-67)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges security concerns relating to Applicant’s uncle who is a citizen
and  resident  of  Pakistan  and  previously  worked  as  a  clerk  for  a  Pakistan  government
council.  He  is  now  retired.  During  her  background  interview,  Applicant  stated  that  she
was  aware  that  her  uncle  worked  in  the  public  sector,  but  could  not  provide  any
additional information. She then asked her parents for details and learned that her uncle
worked  in  a  science  and  technology  field.  Neither  Applicant  nor  her  parents  have  a
close  relationship  or  maintain  regular  communications  with  her  uncle.  (GX  2;  AX  L;

SOR  ¶¶  1.e  and  2.a  allege  foreign  influence  and  foreign  preference  security
concerns  arising  from  statements  Applicant  made  during  her  November  2019
background  interview.  During  the  interview,  Applicant  was  asked  several  questions
regarding  her  Pakistani  citizenship  and  loyalties  to  Pakistan  compared  to  the  United
States.  In  response  to  questioning,  Applicant  stated  that  she  would  rather give  up  her
job  than  give  up  her  Pakistani  citizenship.  She  further  described  having  loyalty  to  the
United  States  and  to  her  family,  but  stated  she  would  not  participate  in  actions  that
negatively  impacted  Pakistan.  In  an  October  2022  interrogatory  response,  Applicant
indicated that the interview summary was accurate. She did not provide any clarification
of her interview statements at that time. (GX 2)
Applicant  testified  that  during  the  background  interview,  she  was  still  struggling
with English language proficiency. She claimed that she misunderstood the meaning of
some of the questions that were asked during her interview. She clarified that she was
willing to renounce her Pakistani citizenship if necessary and that she was  loyal to the
United  States.  She  acknowledged  that  her  work  would  be  to  the  benefit  of  the  United
States over other countries including Pakistan. (AX G; Tr. 22-24, 52-59, 71)
Applicant  currently  earns  about  $120,000  annually.  A  recent  employment
evaluation  noted  that  she  performed  above  expectations  and  maintained  compliance
with  all  of  her  employer’s  policies  and  procedures.  She  and  her  husband  own  their
home  and  they  do  not  have  any  investments  in  Pakistan.  She  testified  that  she  is
committed to raising her family in the United States. (AX M-N, S; Tr. 58-61, 72, 82, 107)
Multiple  individuals  testified  about  Applicant’s  strong  commitment  to  her  family,
work  and  community.  Her  husband  testified  that  over  the  years  she  has  worked  to
increase  her  language  capacity  and  is  a  responsible  citizen  of  the  United  States.
(AX O-P; Tr. 87-91, 100-102, 112-113)
The  Islamic Republic  of Pakistan
The  separation  in  1947  of  British  India  into  the  Muslim  state  of  Pakistan  (with
West and East sections) and largely Hindu India was never satisfactorily resolved; India
and  Pakistan  fought  two  wars  and  a  limited  conflict  (in  1947-48,  1965,  and  1999
respectively) over the disputed Kashmir territory. A third war between these countries in
1971 - in which India assisted an indigenous movement reacting to the marginalization
of  Bengalis  in  Pakistani  politics  - resulted  in  East  Pakistan  becoming  the  separate
nation of Bangladesh.
The  Department  of  State  travel  advisory  for  Pakistan  is  Level  3:  Reconsider
Travel  due  to  Terrorism.  Terrorism  and  ongoing  violence  by  extremist  elements  have
led  to  indiscriminate  attacks  on  civilians,  as  well  as  local  military  and  police  targets.
Significant  human  rights  issues  remain  in  Pakistan  including  unlawful  or  arbitrary
killings;  forced  disappearance  by  the  government  or  its  agents;  torture  and  cases  of
cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment by the government or its agents,
as well as serious restrictions on free expression and media. Additionally, there is a lack
of  government  accountability,  and  abuses,  including  corruption  and  misconduct  by
security  services,  often  went  unpunished,  fostering  a  culture  of  impunity  among
perpetrators.

"Applicant is in her 30s. She has worked for defense contractors for several years.
She seeks to a retain a security clearance (currently Secret, but she is applying for Top
Secret),  which  she  has  held  without  any  apparent  incident  since  about  2019.  She
earned bachelor’s and master’s degrees from a prestigious university. She is married to
a native-born U.S. citizen. She has at least one child who was born in the United States.
(Transcript (Tr.) at 12-13, 16, 20, 26-28; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2)
Applicant was born a citizen of Country X. A close family member (cousin, aunt,
uncle,  niece,  or  nephew)  is  the  dictator  of  Country  X.  Applicant’s  parents  and  their
children,  including  Applicant,  immigrated  to  the  United  States  in  the  1990s  when  she
was young. They all became U.S. citizens. None of her immediate family members have
ever returned to Country X or maintained contact with any of their family in Country X.
(Tr. at 12-15, 20-22, 26-27; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1-3)
Country  X  considers  people  who  leave  their  country  to  be  traitors,  and  the
country has taken retaliatory actions against some of them. Applicant’s parents changed
their  and  their  children’s  names  when  they  came  to  the  United  States.  Few  people
outside Applicant’s immediate family are aware that she is related to Country X’s head
of state. (Tr. at 23-26; GE 1-3)
Applicant  expressed  her  undivided  loyalty  and  allegiance  to  the  United  States.
She  credibly  testified  that  her  connections  to  Country  X  and  its  dictator  could  not  be
used  to  coerce  or  intimidate  her  into  revealing  classified  information.  Applicant’s
husband  testified  to  her  loyalty  to  the  United  States,  and  that  they  have  no  ongoing
concerns  about  Country  X  or  its  dictator.  Applicant  admitted  that  her  mother  still fears
retaliation. (Tr. at 13-15, 33-34, 37-38; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 2)
Applicant submitted letters attesting to her excellent job performance and strong
moral character. She is praised for her trustworthiness, professionalism, reliability, and
discretion   in  the   handling   of  national   security  information.   She   is  recommended   for  a
security clearance.  (Tr. at 40; AE  A-C)

"In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 4.c, 4.d, 4.h,
4.i, 4.j, 4.l, 4.m, and 4.n with clarifications. He denied the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a, 2.a,
2.b,  2.c,  3.a,  4.a,  4.b,  4.e,  4.f,  4.g,  4.k,  and  4.o.  (HE  3)  He  also  provided  mitigating
information. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings follow.
Applicant  is  a  51-year-old  aircraft  mechanic  who  has  worked  for  a  government
contractor in that position for almost six years. (Tr. 7, 10, 34) In 1991, he graduated from
high school. (Tr. 7) He served in the Navy from 1993 to 2013; his specialty was avionics
technician; and he honorably retired as a chief petty officer. (Tr. 8; SOR response) He
has a 100 percent disability rating from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). (Tr. 8)
Seventy  percent  of  his  disability  rating  is  for  bipolar  disorder.  (Tr.  8,  60)  In  2018,  he
received a bachelor’s degree. (Tr. 8)
Applicant’s first marriage was from 2000 to September 2011. (Tr. 9) In March 2012,
he  married  Ms. G;  however, he  said  he  has  not  seen  Ms.  G  since  June  of  2013. (Tr. 9)
He was unsure whether Ms. G  had  filed  for divorce.  (Tr. 9, 36) He  did not take  any action
to obtain a divorce. (Tr. 37) He believed she  has been with  another man since 2016. (Tr.
9)  He has two children with his first wife who are ages 11 and 23, and he said he did not
have  any children with  Ms. G. (Tr. 9-10, 38)
Personal Conduct
Foreign  Influence
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  Applicant  is married  to  Ms.  G,  who  a  citizen and  resident of
Peru. He repeatedly and deliberately failed to disclose this relationship to the government,
as  required.  SOR  ¶  4.b  alleges  he  failed  to  disclose  his  intimate  relationship  with  a
Peruvian national (Ms. G) to his command while enlisted in the Navy.
In July 2010, Applicant met Ms. G when he was in Peru. (Tr. 41)  In September
2012,  he  informed  the  Navy  of  his  marriage  to  Ms.  G.  (Tr.  21-22)  The  marriage  was
documented in his Navy personnel records. (Tr. 35, 53; SOR response, Attach. 2)
The last time Applicant was in Peru was in 2013, and the last time he saw Ms. G
was in 2013. (Tr. 38-40) He did not communicate with her from 2016 to 2018. (Tr. 29-40)
From about 2018 to 2021, he talked to her about twice a week, and the last time he talked
to her was in 2021. (Tr. 39-41) He denied her requests for funds during the 2018 to 2021
time period. (Tr. 41)
Psychological Conditions
SOR ¶  2.a  alleges on  March 9, 2021, Dr. E, a  psychologist, evaluated  Applicant
and  concluded  he  had  “demonstrated  a  pattern  of rule-violating  behavior, poor judgment,
and  dishonesty that could reasonably and  significantly diminish  his trustworthiness and
judgment in a national security context.”
Dr. E evaluated Applicant as requested by the DOD Consolidated Adjudications
Facility  (CAF),  which  is  the  predecessor  organization  for  the  DCSA  CAS.  (GE  4)  He
diagnosed  Applicant  with  Bipolar  I  Disorder,  severe,  in  partial  remission,  most  recent
episode  manic;  Other  Specified  Anxiety  Disorder  (with  symptoms  of  agoraphobia  and
panic); and Alcohol Use Disorder, moderate, in sustained remission. (Id. at 7) Dr. E listed
the materials he considered for his evaluation of Applicant; however, he did not mention
consideration of VA treatment records or other recent records of mental-health treatment.
Dr. E provided a detailed description of Applicant’s mental health and professional history,
which  was  primarily  based  on  Applicant’s  statements,  the  Naval  Criminal  Investigative
Service  (NCIS)  report,  and  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  interviews.  Dr.  E
concluded:
[Applicant]  went  on  trips to  Peru  with  the  attitude  of “Screw  it! What  are they
going  to  do  to  me?” His view is that all  the  allegations pertaining  to  him  lying
about various matters were “trumped  up stuff.”
It   is  possible  that  [Applicant’s]  command   was  not  supportive   of  him   and
developed   a   negative   view  of  him   due   to   his  medical  and   behavioral
problems. However, based  on  the  totality of the  information  available to  me,
my impression  is that [he] is [a] person  who  is willing  to  violate  rules if he
believes he  can  do  so  without being  discovered  and  if doing  so  helps him
attain an  objective. If  he  is discovered, he  seems to  be  a  person  who  adopts
unsophisticated   tactics  to   avoid   trouble,   including   denial  in   the   face   of
obvious   evidence   and   dishonesty.  While   I  acknowledge   that  most   of   the
evidence   of  his  bad   judgment,   poor  decision   making,  and   rule-violating
behaviors  occurred   almost  a   decade   ago,  there  are  indications  that  he
omitted   information   on   his   SF   86   in   2018   (e.g.,   overlooking   his   present
marriage) and  that  he  provided  misleading  information   during  the  present
evaluation (e.g., denying  problems while in the Navy until confronted). This
suggests that he  continues  to  rely on  omissions,  counteraccusations, and
denials  to  resolve  problem  situations  (e.g.,  security clearance  investigation).
It  seems likely he  would  still  lie  to  cover his mistakes—a  serious concern if
he holds a security clearance  and/or works as an  aircraft mechanic.
CONCLUSIONS:  Based   on   available   data,   [Applicant’s]  mental   health
conditions  do   not  presently  impair   his  willingness  or  ability  to   safeguard
classified  information. Additionally, given  the  data  he  reported  is accurate,
the   risk of an  exacerbation   of   symptoms  seems to  be   low  at  this point   in
time.  However,  [he] has a  demonstrated  pattern of rule-violating  behavior,
poor  judgment,   and   dishonesty  that   could   reasonably   and   significantly
diminish   his  trustworthiness  and   judgment  in   a   national  security  context.
(GE 4 at 9-10)
SOR  ¶¶  2.b  and  2.c  allege  in  November  2012,  Applicant  was  involuntarily
committed  for mental-health  treatment,  and in  January 2013, Applicant  was  voluntarily
admitted  for  mental-health  treatment.  At  his  hearing,  Applicant  said  he  had  suicidal
ideations. (Tr. 69) He was an inpatient for about 14 days in November 2012, and he said
his treatment was outpatient in January 2013. (Tr. 68)
In   2012,  Applicant   was  diagnosed   with   ulcerative   colitis,  and   he   lost   about  35
pounds.  (Tr. 22)  He was unable  to  complete  physical activity,  and  his  former spouse  was
not   letting   him   see   his  children.  (Tr.   23)   He  became   extremely  depressed.   (Tr.  23)
Applicant’s father called Applicant’s supervisor and insisted that he receive help. (Tr. 24)
The  VA  is currently treating  him  for bipolar disorder. (Tr. 60) He sees a  VA  psychiatrist
once  every  three  months. (Tr. 60)  He  takes lithium twice  a  day.  (Tr. 61)  He did not  provide
any  VA   medical  treatment  records  to   corroborate   his  statements   about  consistently
receiving counseling and treatment.
I note that Applicant told Dr. E that he had a three-year-old daughter with Ms. G.
(Tr. 38) At his hearing, he said he misspoke. (Tr. 38) He said Ms. G had a daughter, and
he was not her father. (Tr. 39) He told Dr. E that he was accepting her as his daughter.
(Tr. 39)
Applicant  did   not  submit  any  documentation   contradicting   Dr.  E’s  opinions  and
conclusions. In  support  of his denial of SOR ¶¶  2.a, 2.b, and  2.c in his SOR response, he
asserted   he   supported   his  inpatient  treatment  when   he   asked   his  father  for  help,  and
therefore, it was not really involuntary. He said  Dr. E’s conclusions were probably based
on  the  allegations of others and  probably incorrect.  He is feeling  much  better now than
he felt in  2012.
Handling Protected Information  and Personal Conduct
SOR ¶ 3.a alleges Applicant improperly stored sensitive aircraft information on his
personal computer in about July 2010. He left the computer in the unsupervised custody
of a Peruvian national. On October 25, 2012, a special agent from the NCIS questioned
him, and he said he could not remember whether any information on his computer was
classified; however, he  confirmed  his computer had  sensitive aircraft  information on  it.
SOR ¶ 4.a cross-alleges the allegation in SOR ¶ 3.a under Guideline E.
On August 25, 2012, Applicant made a sworn written statement to the NCIS which
states Ms. G had a friend from Miami. (GE 3 at 6) He said:
Her  friend   spoke   English,   German,  and   Spanish.   I  don’t   remember  her
name. I never took her to  the  base. I left a  personal [laptop  computer] in her
custody. On  that laptop  was aircraft maintenance  records . .  .  and  email
traffic pertaining  to  the  aircraft.  I   don’t think that the   maintenance  records
were classified  but I am not sure about some of the  emails. (GE 3  at 6)
At his hearing, Applicant said he gave his laptop computer to Ms. G, and he never
tried to get it back from her. (Tr. 61) There was one Navy maintenance status report and
one email on his computer; however, the documents were not sensitive or classified. (Tr.
58, 61-62, 70)
On November 7, 2012, the NCIS briefed a legal officer about Applicant’s alleged
actions relating to Article 92, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) for violation of an
order and Article 107, UCMJ for making a false statement. (GE 3 at 4) The NCIS report
indicates Applicant would be offered a captain’s mast. (Id.) The NCIS report also indicates
Applicant had been “Baker acted and spent 10 days in [a] mental health facility.” (Id. at 3)
Applicant said in January 2013, a summary court-martial (SCM) acquitted him of
violations  of  Article  92,  UCMJ  for  disobedience  of  an  order and  Article  107,  UCMJ  for
making a false statement. (Tr. 27-28, 62, 66) After his hearing, Applicant made a diligent
effort  to  locate  information  from  the  SCM;  however,  he  was  unable  to  obtain  any
documentation from his SCM. (Tr. 63; AE B) Section 15 Military History-- Discipline of his
May 5, 2018 SCA asks, “In the last 7years have you been subject to court-martial or other
disciplinary procedure under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), such as Article
15, [c]aptain’s mast, Article 135 Court of inquiry, etc.?” (GE 1 at 21) He answered, “No.”
(Id.) However, he did disclose on his SCA that he “went to a disciplinary review board”
based  on  issues  stemming  from  ulcerative  colitis  and  physical  fitness  training.  At  his
hearing, he did not know why he failed to list his SCM in his 2018 SCA. (Tr. 63-65) The
failure to disclose information about his SCM in his 2018 SCA and his OPM PSI were not
alleged in the SOR. (GE 1 at 21; GE 2 at 10)
Personal Conduct
SOR ¶ 4.c alleges Applicant deliberately failed to disclose his  personal travel to
Peru to his command while he was on active duty.
The NCIS investigation states Applicant, “disclosed he has been taking secret trips
to Peru to see his wife, [Ms. G], and that he had failed to report his close relationship to
a foreign national to his security manager.” (GE 3 at 4) In his sworn statement to NCIS
he said:
Since JUL 10, I have  been to Peru three  times. I went in DEC 10, MAR 11,
DEC 11, and most recently on  27 MAR 12 which is when I  married  her. On
all  of these  occasions I just  took leave  and  left  the  country. I did not  notify
my  command  or my   security  officer. I did not  get   a  threat  brief   nor was  I
debriefed  upon  my return. (GE 3 at 6)
Later in his sworn statement he said a special agent showed him a list of his seven
trips to Peru, Applicant said “That appears accurate. I did not tell my command about any
of these trips. They were personal trips, and I used my blue passport.” (GE 3 at 7)
Applicant said he  did  not inform  one  command  that  he  was  traveling  to  Peru. (Tr.
42) He said he  submitted  leave  papers to  his squadron  that he  was going  to  Peru, and  he
received  a  threat briefing  from  that command  before traveling  to  Peru. (Tr. 42-46) He said
he  told the  NCIS  he  did  not inform  his command  or security of his travel  to  Peru  on  those
four occasions. (Tr. 43; GE  3  at 6) He said he  made  this statement to  NCIS  because  he
“had  no  fight left [in] me,” and  he  was “beaten  down.” (Tr. 43-44, 46)  He did not provide
copies of the  leave  forms to  corroborate  his claims  that he  informed  his command  of his
trips to Peru before he  took them.
SOR ¶ 4.d alleges Applicant made a false statement to his command on October
25, 2012, when he said he was married to a Peruvian national over the telephone by the
America Embassy. In fact, he flew to Peru for the wedding. He admitted to the NCIS that
he made  a false  statement  to his command  about  getting married over the  telephone.
(GE 3 at 8) He said he “thought [he] would get in trouble if the command found out [he]
had gone to Peru without going through the proper procedures.” (Tr. 53; GE 3)
SOR ¶ 4.e alleges Applicant made a false statement to military investigators during
his  October  25,  2012  personal  subject  interview  (PSI).  He  falsely  said  he  was  being
extorted  by  a  Peruvian  national  (Ms.  G).  He  subsequently  admitted  this  was  false.  He
said he had married this individual, and he was voluntarily sending her money.
Applicant’s October 25, 2012 statement to NCIS investigators indicates he told two
senior  petty  officers  that  Ms.  G  threatened  him  by  telling  him  that  unless  he  provided
funds to her she would get a friend of hers from another part of the state where he lived
to come to his location and hurt him and his family. (GE 3 at 8) He told the NCIS that Ms.
G demanded $2,000 from him, and when he expressed reluctance to give her the money,
“she said that she had friends [living in the same state where he lived] and they could find
[him] which [he] understood to be a threat.” (Id. at 6) The NCIS statement states, “Also in
the above paragraphs I was not truthful with Agents . . . about being extorted by [Ms. G].”
(Id. at 8) Applicant admitted that his story about being extorted was a lie. (Id.)
At his hearing, Applicant said a senior chief petty officer (SCPO) suggested to him
that he was being extorted by a woman in Peru, and Applicant said he told the SCPO this
was incorrect. (Tr. 49) The SCPO or possibly someone else evidently told the NCIS about
the extortion. (Tr. 49, 51-52) Applicant initially told the NCIS that Ms. G attempted to extort
money from him; however, he said his sworn statement to the NCIS about his making the
initial claim to the senior petty officers was incorrect. (Tr. 47-49)
SOR ¶¶ 4.f through 4.j alleges Applicant falsified material facts on his May 5, 2018
SCA in five different places:
¶   4.f—In  Section  17,  Marital/Relationship  Status,  Applicant  stated  his  current
marital status was “Divorced/Dissolved” (which referred to his first wife, not Ms. G) and
thereby deliberately failed to disclose he was married to a Peruvian national (Ms. G). In
Section 17 of his SCA, Applicant disclosed his first marriage and divorce. (GE 1 at 23) He
indicated his current marital status was “Divorced/Dissolved.” (Id.)
¶  4.g—In Section 19, Foreign Contacts, Applicant listed Ms. G as a former friend
who he last contacted in June 2016, and he failed to disclose his marriage and birth of
his  child.  (GE  1  at  26-27)  In  response  to  the  question  “Personal  (such  as  family  ties,
friendship, affection, common interests, etc.),” he said “Friendship.” (Id. at 27) Applicant
admitted  he  failed  to  disclose  his  marriage  to  Ms.  G;  however,  he  said  he  had  not
communicated with her for about two years at the time he completed his SCA. (Tr. 54)
The question did not specifically ask whether he had ever been married to Ms. G, and
this allegation is found for Applicant.
¶  4.h—Section 20A, Foreign Activities, asked Applicant, “Have you EVER provided
financial support for any foreign national?” (GE 1 at 28) Applicant answered, “No,” and he
failed  to  disclose  sending  about  $21,000  to  a  Peruvian  national  (Ms.  G)  between
September 2011 and October 2012.
Applicant admitted sending $600 to $700 monthly to Ms. G starting in September
2011. (Tr. 46) In 2012, he sent about $17,000 to Ms. G, and she gave some of it to family
and  friends.  (Tr.  47,  50;  GE  3  at  6)  Applicant  had  to  work  a  second  job  to  afford  his
payments to Ms. G. (Tr. 51) He said he did not know why he failed to disclose the funds
he sent to Ms. G on his SCA. (Tr. 55)
¶   4.i—Section  20C,  Foreign  Travel,  asked  Applicant  about  foreign  travel  in  the
previous seven years (the SCA is dated May 5, 2018). Applicant disclosed a single foreign
trip to Peru in May to June 2013, and he failed to disclose four additional foreign trips to
Peru in December 2011, and March 2012. (GE 1 at 30) At his hearing, he admitted he
traveled to Peru during December 2011, and March 2012, and he said he should have
disclosed the trips. (Tr. 42, 55) He said he did not remember why he failed to disclose the
trips two to Peru on his SCA. (Tr. 56-57)
¶   4.j—Section  21,  Psychological  and  Emotional  Health  –  Hospitalized,  asked
“Have you EVER been hospitalized for a mental health condition?” (GE 1 at 32) Applicant
answered,  “No.”  (Id.)  He  admitted  that  he  failed  to  disclose  the  hospitalization  in
November  2012  for  his  mental  health  condition.  At  his  hearing,  he  said  he  did  not
remember why he did not disclose his hospitalizations for psychological and emotional
health on his SCA. (Tr. 56)
SOR ¶  4.k alleges Applicant falsified material facts during his July 16, 2018 OPM
PSI, and SOR ¶¶ 4.l through 4.o allege he falsified material facts during his October 12,
2018 OPM PSI in four different ways:
¶  4.k states  Applicant said he  had  no  contact with  Ms. G  since  “shortly after”  his
May 2013  trip  to  Peru.  Applicant  told  the  OPM  investigator that  he  broke  up  with  Ms.  G
shortly after May  2013 and  he  had not  had any contact with  her since  this  time. (GE  2  at
6) In  the  follow-up OPM  PSI  on  October 12, 2018, he  said  he  had  “not had  any contact
with her since 6/2016.” (GE  2  at 11)
¶ 4.l states Applicant denied that he failed to report his personal travel to  Peru, as
required,  and  thereby  deliberately failed  to  disclose  that  information  in  SOR ¶¶  4.c  and
4.d.  His OPM  PSI states that he  did not bring  his passport to  the  interview. (GE 2  at 10)
The OPM  PSI states:
Subject was confronted with failing to report leaving the country and going
to  Peru  to  visit  a  Peruvian  woman  to  his  security  manager  (Discrepant).
Subject denies this failure and stated he listed Peru, the only trip that he
had  was  in  2010  and  2011  for  short  trips  with  the  military  on  official
government business. (GE 2 at 10)
At  his  hearing,  he  said  he  should  have  reported  the  additional  trips  to  Peru;
however, he was only thinking about the trip in January 2013. (Tr. 55) He also said he did
not remember why he failed to disclose the trips to Peru. (Tr. 56-57)
¶   4.m   states  Applicant  repeatedly  denied   his  March  2012   marriage   to   Ms.  G.
Applicant’s July 16, 2018 OPM  PSI states:
Subject was confronted with 9/2011 sending money to a Peruvian associate
who  he  married  in  3/2012  in  the  amount  $600-$700  and  after  they  were
married, he increased the amount to $2,000-$3,000. Subject stated he did
send listed foreign contact [Ms. G] money to help her family. But never felt
this was reason to report because he looked at it as helping a friend and not
supporting  a  foreign  national.  He  did  not  know  there  was  an  issue  with
helping a friend who was a foreign national. He continued to deny that he
was ever married to her or any foreign national.
At his hearing, he admitted that he failed to disclose his marriage to Ms. G. to the
OPM investigator during his PSI. (Tr. 54) He said he could not remember what he was
thinking at the time he made that statement to the investigator. (Tr. 58)
¶  4.n  states  Applicant  denied  having  ever been  involuntarily committed  to  a  mental-
health  facility.  The  OPM  PSI indicates he  volunteered  for mental health  treatment,  and  he
denied  that he  received  involuntary treatment  or that he  was “Baker acted.” (GE 2  at 11)
He said he  was diagnosed  with  bipolar disorder since  September 2011, and  he  was seen
at  the   VA   hospital.  (Id.  at  14)  He  was  not  prescribed   any  medication   and   he   did  not
regularly see a  provider or counselor. (Id.)
¶   4.o  states  Applicant  denied  having  ever  “been  involved  in,  suspected  of,  or
accused of the improper handling or compromise of sensitive, classified, or proprietary
information.” The OPM PSI indicates he said:
[He]  has  never  provided   anyone   with   anything   which   was  not  entirely  in
keeping   with   regulations.  [He]   has  not   had   any  occasions   in  which  his
actions   could   have   possibly  resulted   in   a   compromise   of   his  duties  or  a
compromise  of  sensitive   or  classified   information.  [He]  has  never  been
involved   in,   suspected   of,  or  accused   of   the   improper  handling   or
compromise   of  sensitive,  classified,   or  proprietary  information.  (GE   12   at
13)
Applicant’s father is a retired Air Force colonel who completed 30 years of service.
(Tr. 23) His father’s statement indicates Applicant was diagnosed with leukemia when he
was  three years old  and  received  chemotherapy  on multiple occasions  for  32 months.
(AE A) When Applicant was 19 years old, he attempted to join the Air Force; however, he
was  unable  to enlist  in  the Air Force  because  of  his previous medical  history. (Id.) He
successfully enlisted in the Navy. He served in the Navy for 20 years, and on April 30,
2013, he honorably retired after being acquitted at a SCM in January 2013.
His father said that  Applicant “is currently in  a  good  mental  place. Clearly, the  meds
are working  .  .  . [I]n mid-2018, he  quickly improved from his  mental position, because  he
was being  treated  by the  VA. And  during  that  treatment,  he  really rapidly improved.” (Tr.
25)  He concluded  Applicant’s mistakes in his  statement to  the  NCIS  occurred  because
“He  was both  mentally  and  physically, absolutely wiped  out.  And, when  you’re  in those
situations, you’re not thinking clearly. And  he was not thinking clearly. And, based on Dr.
[E’s] comments,  it’s clear to  me  that he  believes [Applicant]  has  moved  beyond  that state
of  mind.”  (Tr.  31)  His  mental  health   has   dramatically   improved   since   the   time   he   was
receiving  inpatient mental-health  treatment. (Tr. 33) His father said,  “he’s  completely in a
different state  of mind than  he was at that point in time.” (Tr. 33)
Applicant received the following Navy awards: Navy Achievement Medal (6); Joint
Meritorious Unit Award (2); Good Conduct Medal (6); National Defense Service Medal
(2); Navy “E” Ribbon; Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal (2); Global War on Terrorism
Service  Medal;  Global  War  on  Terrorism  Expeditionary  Medal;  Armed  Forces  Service
Medal;  Sea  Service  Deployment  Ribbon  (6);  Navy  Recruiting  Ribbon;  United  Nations
Medal; Rifle Marksmanship Ribbon; and EAWS Insignia. (SOR response, DD Form 214)

"The SOR alleges foreign influence security concerns based on Applicant’s friend
who is a citizen and resident of Israel. His friend works for an Israeli technology company,
and Applicant maintains regular contact with him. (SOR ¶ 1.a.) Applicant admitted, with
explanation, the single Guideline B allegation in his response to the SOR. After a thorough
and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant is a 46-year-old citizen of the United States. He married in 1999, and he
and his wife have two children. He graduated in 1999 with a bachelor’s degree, followed
by a Master of Arts in history in 2001. He started his career in education where he served
as a public-school teacher for 15 years teaching U.S. history. He also was employed by
a  community  college  as  an  adjunct  professor  teaching  history  and  humanities.  In
approximately 2019, he left his career in education and began working in the computer
engineering  sector.  In  September  2021,  he  was  hired  by  his  current  employer,  a
government contractor. His job title is product growth architect. In April 2022 Applicant
was granted a Secret security clearance. His employer continues to  sponsor him for a
Top-Secret DOD security clearance. (SOR response; GE 1, GE 2; Tr. 18-22)
Foreign Influence
The SOR alleges security concerns based on Applicant’s friend, X, who is a citizen
and  resident  of  Israel.  Applicant  met  X  in  June  2017  during  a  personal  trip  he  took  to
Israel with his best friend. Applicant was hired by his best friend to work for a well-known
company  in  the  U.S.  as  a  consultant,  and  X  was  also  hired  as  a  consultant  for  the
company team located in Israel. Applicant mainly had work-related email communications
with X during the following year trying to navigate the bureaucracy of a 30,000-person
global corporation. (Tr. 23-25; SOR response)
Applicant would communicate with X via electronic messaging and occasionally by
telephone. The frequency was sporadic, about once or twice a month. He and his best
friend met X in Paris in 2018, and they met X in New York a few times for work-related
meetings. Between 2020 and 2023, Applicant and X were included in a total of 13 email
threads with other recipients, and they only exchanged one direct email message. Their
communications  have  only  been  social  in  nature  and  X  has  never  once  asked  for
information about Applicant’s current work for a government contractor. X now works for
a technology company in Israel, which was acquired by an American company in 2015.
Applicant did not possess a  security clearance  during  the  times  he  communicated  with  X,
and their  last direct electronic message  took place  in May  2020.  (SOR response; Tr. 28-
32)
Applicant voluntarily disclosed X on his June 2022 security clearance application.
In  early  2023,  Applicant  soon  realized  that  X  was  a  security  concern  during  his
background investigation, and he severed all communications with X. Whether or not his
security  clearance  is  granted,  Applicant  has  no  intention  of  reinitiating  contact  with  X.
(SOR response; Tr. 28-32; GE 1)

Applicant submitted several letters of recommendation by friends, co-workers, and
colleagues. All the references recommended Applicant be granted a Top-Secret security
clearance because he is considered dedicated, trustworthy, and a loyal U.S. citizen. (AE

Administrative Notice
I have taken administrative notice of the following facts concerning Israel:
Israel has forged close bilateral cooperation with the United States in many areas.
A 10-year bilateral military aid memorandum of understanding commits the United States
to provide Israel $3.3 billion in foreign military financing and spend $500 million annually
on joint missile defense programs from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2028, subject to
congressional appropriations.
After elections held on November 1, 2022, for Israel’s parliament (Knesset), Likud
party  leader  Benjamin  Netanyahu  is  again  the  prime  minister,  a  post  he  held  twice
previously, from 1996 to 1999 and 2009 to 2021. The 2022 election was the fifth held in
Israel since a formal process began in December 2018 addressing corruption allegations
against Netanyahu. Two of the previous four elections did not result in the formation of a
government, and the other two resulted in short-lived coalition governments, a 2020 to
2021  government  with  Netanyahu  as  prime  minister,  and  a  2021  to  2022  government
without  him.  The  rise  of  the  ultra-nationalist  Religious  Zionism  faction  as  a  likely
Netanyahu  coalition  partner  has  triggered  debate  about  the  implications  for  Israel’s
democracy, its ability to manage tensions with Arabs and Palestinians, and its relations
with  the  United  States  and  other  countries.  Israel  has  experienced  an  unprecedented
period of political instability in recent years.
A March 6, 2023 travel warning issued by the U.S. Department of State for Israel
and  the  West  Bank,  urged  U.S.  travelers to  exercise  increased  caution  while  traveling
due to terrorism and civil unrest. The Department of State has issued a travel advisory
for  Gaza,  urging  U.S.  travelers  not  to  travel  due  to  terrorism,  civil  unrest,  and  armed
conflict.
Significant  human  rights  issues  in  2022  included  credible  reports  of  unlawful  or
arbitrary killings; arbitrary detention, often extraterritorial detention of Palestinians from
the  occupied  territories  in  Israel;  restrictions  on  Palestinians  residing  in  Jerusalem
including  arbitrary  or  unlawful  interference  with  privacy,  family,  and  home;  substantial
interference  with  the  freedom  of  association;  arbitrary  or  unlawful  interference  with
privacy;  harassment  of  nongovernmental  organizations;  significant  restrictions  on
freedom of movement within the country; violence against asylum seekers and irregular
migrants; violence or threats of violence against national, racial, or ethnic minority groups;
and labor rights abuses against foreign workers and Palestinians from the West Bank.
The U.S. Department of State advises that all persons seeking to enter or depart
Israel, the West Bank, or Gaza are subject to immigration and security screening, possibly
including prolonged questioning and physical searches, and may be denied entry or exit.
Some  U.S.  citizens  of  Arab  or  Muslim  heritage,  including  Palestinian-Americans,  have
experienced significant difficulties, unequal, and occasionally hostile treatment at Israel’s
borders and checkpoints. Israeli security officials have also on occasion requested access
to travelers’ personal e-mail accounts or other social media accounts as a condition of
entry. In such circumstances, travelers should have no expectation of privacy for any data
stored on such devices or in their accounts. (AN I)

"Applicant  is a  43-year-old  naturalized U.S.  citizen.  He has an employment  offer
from  a  U.S.  defense  contractor  that  is  conditioned  upon  his  being  granted  security
clearance eligibility. He was born in Iran to Iranian parents. He has a bachelor’s degree
and a master’s degree from an Iranian university. He was working toward his Doctor of
Philosophy  (PhD) degree  at  an Iranian university,  but he was  “fired”  from  the program
because he practices a religion not authorized by the Iranian government. Applicant first
came  to  the  United  States  in  2011.  He  was  assisted  in  this  effort  by  the  Hebrew
Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS). (Tr. 23-27, 31-33, 42, 51-52; GE 1-3)
Applicant  became  a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen  in  April  2017.  He  solely  holds  U.S.
citizenship, as he renounced his Iranian citizenship  in 2017. He has been married and
divorced twice. His first marriage was to an Iranian woman from 2008 until 2014. They
were  married  in Iran and  divorced shortly  after entering the  United States. His  second
marriage was to a U.S. citizen from 2019 until August 2021. From his first marriage, he
has a 14-year-old child, who is a dual U.S. and Iranian citizen and who resides with him
in the United States. (Tr. 23-27, 31-33, 42, 51-52; GE 1-3)
Applicant’s  mother (SOR ¶ 1.a), sister (SOR ¶ 1.b), three brothers (SOR ¶ 1.c),
and several aunts and uncles  (SOR ¶ 1.d) are citizens and residents of Iran. All these
family members, except for one of his brothers, are in various stages of emigrating from
Iran to come to the United States. Applicant is not aware of the whereabouts of this one
brother.  He  has  not  seen  or  been  in  contact  with  this  brother  after  the  Iranian  Islamic
Revolutionary  Guard  Corps  (IRGC)  abducted  this  brother  without  charge  in  2003.  (Tr.
29-30, 36-42, 54-61; GE 1-3; AE A, B)
Applicant and the rest of his family members listed in the SOR have left or are in
the  process  of  leaving  Iran  with  the  assistance  of  HIAS  because  they  are  part  of  a
religious  minority  in  Iran.  As  a  result  of  their  religious  beliefs,  the  Iranian  government
has  repeatedly  and  consistently  violated  their  human  rights.  In  addition  to  his  brother
being  abducted,  his  now-deceased  father  was  arrested  without  charge.  Also,  in  about
2007,  the  IRGC  arrested  Applicant  for  playing  unapproved  religious  music  in  a  public
square and held him in jail for several days. A few weeks later, the IRGC took him from
his workplace and held him in a cage in an unknown location for several weeks without
charge.  The  IRGC  tortured  him  physically  and  psychologically  and  repeatedly
threatened to kill him. (Tr. 27-42, 44-46, 50, 54, 66-69; GE 1-3; AE A, B)
When  the  IRGC  finally  released  Applicant,  one  of  their  members  told  Applicant
that it would be best for him to leave the country but took his passport and told him he
had to buy it back. Without his passport, Applicant could not leave and was subjected to
further  abuse  such  as  receiving  threatening  phone  calls  and  having  his  vehicle
damaged. In the meantime, Applicant applied with HIAS for assistance to leave Iran for
the United States. In 2011, two days before he was scheduled to leave Iran with HIAS’s
assistance, he bought back his passport  for $20,000. When he asked the individual to
whom he paid for his passport if it was valid, the individual responded that it was valid
because the Iranian Government wanted him to leave. (Tr. 31, 33-38, 42-45; GE 3)
Applicant,  his ex-wife,  and  his daughter  left  on  a  flight  for Vienna,  but  were  not
sure if the Iranian Government would stop the plane until a flight attendant announced
that they were in Austrian airspace. He flew to the United States after staying for about
five  months  in  Vienna  while  finalizing  his  U.S.  immigration  paperwork.  The  entire
process of working with HIAS until he came to the United States took a little under three
months.  He  has  not  been  back  to  Iran  since  then  and  has  vowed  never  to  go  back
again.  He  has  not  received  any  threats  or  been  contacted  by  the  Iranian  Government
after he came to the United States, but the Iranian Government has continued to target,
harass, and  intimidate his family members that remain  in Iran. Suspected members of
the IRGC also caused Applicant’s family to close their business by repeatedly targeting
it for theft and vandalism. (Tr. 31, 42-45, 47-48, 53-54, 60, 66-69; GE 3)
Applicant  described  the  process  that  HIAS  is  using  to  assist  him and  his family
members. After obtaining a sponsor in the United States and applying for immigration to
the  United  States,  HIAS  provides  its  enrollees  with  a  case  number.  HIAS  then  works
with  U.S.  immigration officials  to  facilitate  their  entry  into  the  United  States.  Once  that
process reaches a certain point, each enrollee must pay HIAS $3,100, which it will later
give  back  to  the  enrollee  so  that  the  enrollee  has  enough  resources  to  support
themselves in the United States. After an enrollee pays the money, HIAS books a flight
for  them  to  leave  Iran  for  the  United  States  via  either  Croatia  or  Vienna.  It  is  unclear
how long this process normally takes. (Tr. 44-49, 54-60; GE 2, 3; AE A, B)
Given U.S. immigration policy from early 2017 until early 2021, the HIAS program
from Iran was paused and only recently began again. Applicant’s mother and sister first
applied for relocation to the United States with HIAS in 2015. They have each paid the
$3,100  and  they  are  scheduled  to  fly  to  Croatia  in  early  March  2024,  where  Applicant
will meet them and assist with his elderly mother. Applicant expects that they will stay a
few days in Croatia finalizing paperwork before coming to the United States. (Tr. 44-49,
54-60; GE 2, 3; AE A, B)
Two of Applicant’s brothers that are listed in the SOR  have case numbers  from
HIAS, as well. They first applied for relocation in 2017. Applicant is sponsoring them for
entry  into  the  United  States.  They  have  not  received  flight  information,  nor  have  they
paid the required $3,100. However, they have the required money to provide when it is
requested. It is not clear when or whether they will leave Iran, but they intend to do so.
(Tr. 48-49, 55-57, 59; GE 1-3; AE A, B)
Applicant’s  aunts  and  uncles  listed  in  the  SOR  also  have  HIAS  case  numbers.
They  first  enrolled  with  HIAS  sometime  during  the  Obama  administration.  They  are
being sponsored by U.S. citizens who live in the United States. They have not received
flight  information,  nor  have  they  paid  the  required  $3,100.  However,  they  have  the
required money to provide when it is requested. It is not clear when or whether they will
leave Iran, but they intend to do so. (Tr. 60-62; GE 1-3; AE A, B)
Applicant has not seen any of his family members in Iran in about 14 years. He
does not often  communicate with them because he is worried  the Iranian Government
could be monitoring them and cause them trouble. In addition to his daughter, he has an
older  sister,  nieces  and  nephews,  many  cousins,  and  an  aunt  and  uncle  who  are
citizens  and  residents  of  the  United  States.  While  he  does  not  currently  own  real
property in Iran or in the United States, he has a bank account with a U.S. based bank
with  about  $30,000  in  it.  He  also  has  a  U.S.-based  retirement  account  with  about
$17,000 in it. He works here and he is a member of a U.S.-based linguists’ organization.
(Tr. 46, 53, 63-66; GE 1-3)
Applicant considers himself an American and does not identify as Iranian. He has
never  been  associated  with  the  Iranian  Government.  He  attempted  to  join  the  U.S.
military  but  could  not  for  health  reasons.  He  applied  to  work  for  another  government
agency, but it did not hire him. It was clear from his testimony that he has nothing but
contempt for the current Iranian regime. He is not looking for more money by attempting
to be hired for this new job, and he will be making about the same amount  as with his
current job. He wants to obtain a security clearance and work this new job as a way of
showing his loyalty to the United States, and showing his gratitude for the freedoms that
living here has afforded him.  He has not told any of his family that he is attempting  to
obtain a security clearance. (Tr. 51-53, 70-71; GE 1-3)
Republic  of Iran
In HE I, the Government included information from the U.S. Department of State
about the United States' relations with Iran and the current conditions in that country. I
take  administrative  notice  of  the  information  contained  in  those  documents  including,
but not limited to:
Iran  is  an  authoritarian  theocratic  republic  with  a  Shia  Islamic  political  system.
Shia clergy and political leaders vetted by the clergy dominate key power structures in
the  country.  Iran's  Supreme  Leader  is  the  head  of  state  and  holds  constitutional
authority over the judiciary, government-run media, and other important institutions.
The  U.S.  Department  of  State  advises  U.S.  citizens  not  to  travel  to  Iran  due  to
the risk of kidnapping and the arbitrary arrest and detention of U.S. citizens. Since 1984,
Iran  has  been  designated  by  the  United  States  as  a  state  sponsor  of  terrorism.  Its
support  of  terrorist  organizations  throughout  the  Middle  East  creates  instability  in  the
region. Iran threatens U.S. persons directly and through proxy attacks, particularly in the
Middle East.
Iran's growing expertise and willingness to conduct aggressive cyber operations
make it a major threat to U.S. and allied networks and data. As of 2018, all previously
suspended  sanctions  imposed  on  Iran  were  reinstated  with  the  goals  of  permanently
preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, ceasing Iran's development of ballistic
missiles, and ending Iran's broad range of malign activities.
The  U.S.  Department  of  State  has  identified  significant  human  rights  issues  in
Iran. The issues include unlawful and arbitrary killings by the Iranian Government or its
agents;  forced  disappearances  attributed  to  the  government;  torture  and  inhumane
treatment  by  the  government  and  its  agents;  the  imprisonment  of  political  opponents;
severe  restrictions  on  free  expression  and  the  media;  serious  restrictions  on  political
participation; and government corruption. (HE I)

mother  owns.  The   eldest  brother   is  not   affiliated   with   the   Iraqi  government.   Applicant
has weekly contact  with  him  via telephone.  His eldest brother has sent Applicant money
in  the   past  to   help  him   get  established   in  the   U.S.   In   2010   Applicant’s   eldest   brother
applied   for   himself   and   the   rest  of  his  family  to   come   to   the   United   States,   as  he   was
being   threatened   by   Iraqi  militants  for  helping   U.S.   forces.   He   has  not  yet  been
approved   for  entry  to   the   U.S.,  although   he   has  not  checked   on   his  application   status
since   2017,   because   he   saw  little   progress.   Applicant   claimed   that  his  eldest   brother
would move  to  the  United  States  if he  and  his family were  approved  for entry.  (Tr.  35-
47,  72-76, 96-97, 111, 114;  GE  1, 2)
Applicant’s  eldest  brother  worked  as  an  interpreter  for  the  U.S.  Marines  in  Iraq
during  the  Iraq  War.  Applicant  is  aware  of  two  instances  when  his  eldest  brother  was
targeted   by  Iraqi  militants   because   he   worked   for  the   U.S.   military.   In   about  2007,
members  of  the   Al  Mahdi  Army  came   to   Applicant’s  family  home   where   his   eldest
brother and  the  rest  of  Applicant’s family lived  to  threaten  Applicant’s brother.  Applicant
and   his  brother’s  pregnant  wife   were  the   only  people  home   at  the   time.  The   militants
demanded  entry and  when  Applicant would not let them  in, they sprayed  the  home  with
machine   gun  fire   and  threw a   grenade   at   it.  When  a  neighbor   came   outside   to  tell   the
militants  that  Applicant’s  brother  was  not  home,  the   militants  shot   the   neighbor  in   the
shoulder.  The  militants  eventually left without gaining  entry and  Applicant and  his sister-
in-law were  unharmed. However,  the  militants said  they  would be  back.  (Tr.  35-46,  72-
73, 111; GE  1, 2)
Applicant’s family left the family home and stayed in other locations with friends
and family  for about four years. In  about 2011, they  thought  it was  safe  to  come back
and began remodeling the home. Shortly after they came back to their home, unknown
individuals  followed  Applicant’s  eldest  brother  while  he  was  driving  and  drove
aggressively  and  dangerously  around  his  car.  Fortunately,  he  was  able  to  lose  them.

Applicant’s other brother is a car salesman in Iraq who has never been affiliated
with  the  Iraqi  government.  He  is  married  and  has  two  children.  Applicant  also  speaks
with  this  brother  about  once  per  week  via  telephone.  This  brother  has  also  applied  to
come to the U.S. In September 2023, the relevant U.S. agency told him to get prepared
for an impending interview in furtherance of his application. Applicant claimed that this

of Iraq currently residing in Romania, but they also stay for about two weeks per year in
Turkey to maintain their residency there. Applicant’s father-in-law was a “general major”
in the Iraqi military until he retired in 2017. His last post was as an assistant to the Iraqi
Minister of Defense. Applicant’s mother-in-law is retired and receives an Iraqi pension in
an unknown amount. Applicant communicates with his in-laws about once or twice per
month via social media or the telephone. (Tr. 52-55, 57, 63-72, 109-111; GE 1, 2)
Applicant’s  mother,  who  is  a  dual  U.S.  and  Iraqi  citizen  residing  in  the  United
States,  owns  real  property  in  Iraq  in  which  Applicant’s  eldest  brother  and  his  family
reside. Applicant has a one-third inheritance right in this Iraqi real property that is valued
at  about $200,000.  He owns  real property  in the  United  States that  is valued at  about
$324,000, in which he has about $25,000 in equity. He is several payments behind on
his mortgage. He also has an aunt who resided in the United States, but she now lives
in Dubai. (Tr. 22, 33-34, 93-96, 106-107, 114-120; GE 1, 2; AE B)
Applicant  has  never  been  a  member of  the  Iraqi  military  or worked  for  the  Iraqi
government.  While  he  is  a  full-time  student,  he  also  works  part-time  for  a  U.S.-based
healthcare  provider  and  part-time  for  a  U.S.-based  company  at  a  call  center.  He
currently earns about $41,000, annually. He has about $3,000 to $4,000 in a checking
account and a savings account with no money in it. He is several payments behind on
other consumer accounts.  He plans to  try to  find  a  part-time  job  as a  driver for a  U.S-
based corporation  providing  ride-hailing  services  to  get  caught  up  on  his debts.  (Tr.  25-
26,  90-95; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  also  has  friends  who  reside  in  the  United  States  and  socializes  with
them regularly at coffee houses on weekends. Several of his family members know that
he  is  trying  to  obtain  security  clearance  eligibility.  He  has  no  other  family  members  in
Iraq. He expressed his loyalty to the United States  over Iraq and considers the United
States his  home,  but  he  also  acknowledged  that  he  considers home  wherever he  can
get  together  with  his  family.  He  claimed  that  he  is  willing  to  renounce  his  Iraqi
citizenship  and  has  some  information  about  how  to  do  so,  but  he  has  not  begun  that
process. (Tr. 97-98, 102-106, 108-109; GE 1, 2)
Since  he  arrived  in  the  United  States  in  2013,  Applicant  visited  Iraq  for  several
weeks  in  2019  and  2022.  He  had  in-person  contact  with  his  family  members  during
these  visits.  He  visited  his  wife  and  in-laws  in  Turkey  for  20  days  in  2022  and  in
Romania for a few days in January 2024. (Tr. 28-31, 55-56, 67-69; GE 1, 2; AE A)
Republic of Iraq
In HE I, the Government included information from the U.S. Department of State
as  of  January  2024,  about  the  United  States'  relations  with  Iraq  and  the  current
conditions  in  that  country.  I  take  administrative  notice  of  the  information  contained  in
those documents including, but not limited to:
The U.S. Department of State has assessed Iraq as being a high threat, “Level 4:
Do  not  travel”  location  due  to  terrorism,  kidnapping,  armed  conflict,  civil  unrest,  and
limited ability to assist U.S. citizens in country. U.S. citizens in  Iraq are at high risk for
violence  and  kidnapping.  Terrorist  and  insurgent  groups  regularly  attack  both  Iraqi
security  forces  and  civilians.  Anti-U.S.  sectarian  militias  threaten  U.S.  citizens  and
Western companies throughout Iraq. Attacks using improvised explosive devices (IEDs)
occur in many areas of  the country, including Baghdad. Demonstrations, protests, and
strikes  occur  frequently.  These  events  can  develop  quickly  without  prior  notification,
often  interrupting  traffic,  transportation,  and  other  services;  such  events  have  the
potential to turn violent.
The  country  experienced  large-scale  protests  in  Baghdad  and  several  Shia-
majority  provinces  beginning  in  2019  and  lasting  through  2022,  with  reports  of  more
than 500 civilians killed and 20,000 or more injured. Another, similar incident in August
2022 resulted in more than 20 deaths. The government took minimal steps to bring to
justice those responsible for the violence.
Terrorist groups  and  those  inspired  by such  organizations are  intent  on  attacking
U.S.  citizens abroad.  Primary   terrorist  threats   within   Iraq   included  Islamic State   in Iraq
and   Syria   (ISIS)  and   Iran-aligned   militia  groups.  ISIS   is  a   designated   terrorist
organization,  which  is active  in  Syria  and  near the  Iraq  border.   ISIS  and  its  associated
terrorist  groups  indiscriminately   commit   attacks  and   violent   atrocities  in   Iraq   despite
improved  Iraqi government control. ISIS, militia groups, and  criminal gangs target  U.S.
citizens for attacks and hostage-taking.
There  have  been  significant  human  rights  issues  in  Iraq,  including:  credible
reports of unlawful or arbitrary  killings;  extrajudicial killings and forced disappearances
by  the  government;  torture  and  cruel,  inhumane,  and  degrading  treatment  by  the
government; and arbitrary arrest and detention.
Republic of Turkey
In HE II, the Government included information from the U.S. Department of State
as  of  January  2024,  about  the  United  States'  relations  with  Turkey  and  the  current
conditions  in  that  country.  I  take  administrative  notice  of  the  information  contained  in
those documents including, but not limited to:
Turkey  is  a  constitutional  republic  with  an  executive  presidential  system  and  a
unicameral  600  seat  parliament  (the  Grand  National  Assembly).  In  presidential  and
parliamentary  elections  in  2018,  Organization  for  Security  and  Cooperation  in  Europe
observers  expressed  concern  regarding  restrictions  on  media  reporting  and  the
campaign  environment,  including  the  jailing  of  a  presidential  candidate  that  restricted
the ability of opposition candidates to compete on an equal basis and campaign freely.
The friendship between the United States and Turkey dates back to 1831, when
the United States established diplomatic relations with the Ottoman Empire. The United
States  condemned  the  July  15,  2016  coup  attempt  in  Turkey,  and  continues  to
emphasize  the  importance  of  the  Turkish  government's  adherence  to  policies  and
actions that build public trust in the country's democratic institutions and the rule of law,
as  well  as  upholding human  rights  commitments.  Turkey  is  an  important  U.S.  security
partner  and  has  been  a  valued  North  Atlantic  Treaty  Organization  (NATO)  ally  since
1952.
On  December 14, 2020, the  United  States imposed  sanctions on  the  Republic  of
Turkey's  Presidency  of  Defense   Industries   (SSB)  pursuant  to   Section   231   of  the
Countering   America's  Adversaries  Through   Sanctions   Act   (CAATSA)  for  knowingly
engaging  in  a  significant transaction  with  Russia's main  arms  export entity  by  procuring
the  S-400  surface-to-air missile system. The  United  States made  clear to  Turkey at the
highest levels and  on  numerous  occasions  that  its purchase  of the  S-400  system  would
endanger the  security of U.S.  military technology and  personnel and  provide  substantial
funds  to   Russia's  defense   sector,  as  well  as  Russian   access  to   the   Turkish   armed
forces  and   defense   industry.  Turkey  nevertheless  decided   to   move   ahead   with   the
procurement  and   testing   of   the   S-400,  despite   the   availability  of   alternative,   NATO-
interoperable   systems   to   meet  its  defense   requirements.   This  decision   resulted   in
Turkey's  suspension   and   pending   removal   from   the   global  F-35   Joint   Strike   Fighter
partnership.
Turkey  continues  its  efforts  to  defeat  terrorist  organizations  both  inside  and
outside  its  borders,  including  the  Kurdistan  Workers'  Party  (PKK),  the  Revolutionary
People's Liberation Party/Front, and ISIS. Turkey is an active contributor in international
counterterrorism, including the GCTF and the Defeat-ISIS Coalition. However, Turkey is
a source and transit country for foreign terrorist fighters (FTFs) seeking to join ISIS and
other terrorist groups fighting in Syria and Iraq, as well as for FTFs who seek to depart
Syria and Iraq. Moreover, the PKK continues to conduct terrorist attacks in Turkey and
against Turkish interests outside of Turkey including by taking hostages.
In 2020, the PKK and its affiliates claimed responsibility for a rocket attack on the
Gurbulak  customs  gate  with  Iran  that  killed  two  Turkish  Customs  officials,  a  suicide
bomber  that  struck  a  natural  gas  pipeline  near  the  Turkish-Iranian  border,  taking  the
pipeline offline for months, and a bombing in Mardin province that temporarily disabled
an  oil  pipeline  running  from  Iraq  to  Turkey.  Turkey  has  a  broad  definition  of  terrorism
that  includes  so-called  crimes  against  constitutional  order  and  internal  and  external
security of the state, which the government regularly used to criminalize the exercise of
freedom of expression and peaceful assembly.
Significant  human  rights  issues  exist  in  Turkey  including  credible  reports  of:
arbitrary  killings;  suspicious  deaths  of  persons  in  custody;  forced  disappearances;
torture;  arbitrary  arrest  and  continued  detention  of  tens  of  thousands  of  persons,
including opposition politicians and former members of parliament, lawyers, journalists,
human  rights  activists,  and  employees  of  the  U.S.  Mission,  for  purported  ties  to
“terrorist”  groups  or  peaceful  legitimate  speech.  There  are  also
reports  of  severe
restrictions on freedom of expression, the press, and the internet, including violence and
threats of violence against journalists, closure of media outlets, and arrests or criminal
prosecution  of  journalists  and  others  for  criticizing  government  policies  or  officials,
censorship, site blocking, and criminal libel laws.
The Turkish government took limited steps to investigate, prosecute, and punish
members of the security forces and other officials accused of human rights abuses; and
impunity  remained  a  problem.  The  government  took  limited  steps  to  investigate
allegations of high-level corruption. Clashes between security forces and the Kurdistan
Workers' Party terrorist organization and its affiliates continued and resulted in the injury
or  death  of  security  forces,  terrorists,  and  civilians.  The  government  did  not  release
information on efforts to  investigate or prosecute personnel for wrongful or inadvertent
deaths of civilians linked to counterterrorism operations.
The  U.S.  State  Department  warns  U.S.  citizens  to  exercise  increased  caution
when  traveling  to  Turkey  due  to  terrorism  and  arbitrary  detentions.  Terrorist  groups
continue  plotting  possible  attacks  in  Turkey.  Terrorists  may  attack  with  little  or  no
warning,  targeting  tourist  locations,  transportation  hubs,  markets/shopping  malls,  local
government facilities, hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, parks, major sporting
and  cultural  events,  educational  institutions,  airports,  and  other  public  areas.  Security
forces  have  detained  tens  of  thousands  of  individuals,  including  U.S.  citizens,  for
alleged  affiliations  with  terrorist  organizations  based  on  scant  or  secret  evidence  and
grounds that appear to be politically motivated. U.S. citizens have also been subject to
travel bans that prevent them from departing Turkey.
Romania
Official  U.S.  Government  documents  for  Romania  contained  in  HE  IV  included
information  from  the  U.S.  Department  of  State  as  of  January  2024,  about  the  United
States'  relations  with  Romania  and  the  current  conditions  in  that  country.  I  take
administrative notice of the information contained in those documents including, but not
limited to:
In  1947,  the  United  States  reestablished  ties  with  Romania  after  World  War  II.
Relations  remained  strained  during  the  Cold  War  era  while  Romania  was  under
communist  leadership.  After  the  1989  revolution  ended  communist  rule,  Romania's
policies became unequivocally pro-Western. Romania and the United States deepened
their  relations  and  cooperation  on  shared  goals  including  economic  and  political
development,  defense  reform,  and  non-traditional  threats  such  as  transnational  crime
and non-proliferation.
In  2011,  Romania  and  the  United  States  issued  a  joint  declaration  of  strategic
partnership  for  the  21st  century.  The  two  countries  identified  key  areas  of  enhanced
cooperation,  focusing  on  political-military  relationships,  law-enforcement  cooperation,
trade  and  investment  opportunities,  and  energy  security.  In  2016,  the  two  countries
reaffirmed their commitment to this cooperation. They mutually committed to supporting
human rights, the rule of law, and peace and freedom for everyone. The two countries
are bound together through people-to-people ties in business, the arts, scholarship, and
other  exchanges.  Romania  has  promoted  great  cooperation  among  its  Black  Sea
neighbors  in  the  areas  of  defense,  law  enforcement,  energy,  economic  development,
and  the  environment,  which  complement  the  U.S.  goal  of  enhancing  stability  in  this
sensitive and important region.
Romania joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 2004 and has
established  itself  as  a  steadfast  ally  of  both  the  United  States  and  NATO.  It  has
repeatedly deployed forces and assets in support of shared national security interests,
including contributions of troops, equipment, and other assistance in Afghanistan, Iraq,
Libya, and Kosovo.
The  Romanian  constitution  provides  for  freedom  of  speech  and  press,  and  the
government generally respects these rights. An independent press, largely independent
judiciary,  and  functioning  democratic  political  system  combine  to  promote  freedom  of
speech and press.
Human  rights  problems  include  police  and  gendarmerie  mistreatment  and
harassment of detainees. Prison conditions remain harsh and do not meet international
standards. Government efforts to address systematic corruption continue, but corruption
remains widespread. There are no reports that the government or its agents committed
reports  of  politically  motivated
arbitrary  or  unlawful  killings.  There  are  no
disappearances. The constitution and law prohibit arbitrary arrest and detention and the
government  generally  respects  these  prohibitions.  The  constitution  provides  for  an
independent judiciary and the  government generally  respects this provision.  There  are
no reports of political prisoners or detainees.
