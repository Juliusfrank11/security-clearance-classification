Personal Conduct
In about April 2004, Applicant’s  spouse  obtained a domestic  violence  restraining
order  against  Applicant.  (SOR  response  to  ¶  3.b;  GE  7)  He  was  not  convicted  of  any
offense  as  a  result  of  the  April  2004  altercation  with  his  spouse.  (SOR  response  at  6)
Applicant  was  unable  to  remember  or  unwilling  to  disclose  details  of  the  April  2004
altercation with his spouse at his hearing. (Tr. 31, 54)
In June 2007, Applicant and his spouse had another physical altercation. She was
a petty officer first class, and Applicant and his spouse were living on base in government
housing overseas. (GE 6 at 9) They were in bed, and she was insulting him. (GE 6 at 9)
Applicant  described  the  physical  altercation  to  the  Naval  Criminal  Investigative  Service
(NCIS) as follows:
At some point, [she] started to try to push me out of the bed with her leg.
She was lying on her side as she was trying to push me out of the bed. She
was not able to get me out of the bed, but she kept on saying things to me
to hurt me, belittle me, and make me mad. [She] was lying face down on
her stomach, and I got on top of her to hold her down by lying on her with
my body. I was trying to stop her from continuing to say things to me so I
grabbed her with my hands by her face and head. I kept telling her to shut
up. [She] was struggling the whole time. I did not twist or turn [her] by her
head. I am sure she got the mark on her face when I was holding her by the
head, but I do not know how she got the other marks, shown [in the photos].
. . . I knew she was going to call security, so I unplugged the phone from
the wall. (GE 6 at 9-10)
Applicant  admitted  that  he  laid  on  top  of  his  spouse  and  grabbed  her  face  hard
enough to leave marks on her skin. (See SOR response to ¶ 3.a at 5 (admitting to mutual
physical  contacts  and  unhealthy  marital  conflicts)  The  NCIS  report  of  investigation
indicates  Applicant  and  his  spouse  engaged  in  a  physical  altercation,  and  they  both
sustained bruises. (GE 6) Applicant admitting pinning his spouse to the bed and grabbing
her by  the face and head. She  had  “bruises  and abrasions  to  her chest,  shoulder, and
face.”  (GE  6  at  2,  5) Applicant  had  “a  small  injury”  to  his  neck  and  thumb.  (AE  6  at  2)
Applicant’s commander ordered him to move out of base housing until further notice. (AE
6 at 5) Applicant told NCIS that there were two prior incidents involving the police, one
involving pushing in 2004, and one involving a verbal argument  (no physical contact) in
2006. (AE 6 at 5, 11) No adverse inference is drawn from the incident in 2006. He received
marital  counseling.  (SOR  response  at  5-6)  He  was  not  convicted  of  a  crime.  (SOR
response at 5; GE 6) Applicant was unable to remember or unwilling to disclose details of
the June 2007 altercation with his spouse at his hearing. (Tr. 30, 54)
On July 2, 2019, Applicant responded to the  domestic violence allegations in the
SOR. Applicant said, “[a]fter going to counseling and working together as a team, my wife
and I came out strong and closer than ever before. We have found healthy ways to handle
conflict, so I can say with utmost confidence that the behaviors from the past will not recur.”
(Tr. 54-56; SOR response at 6)
In August 2019, Applicant was upset with his spouse because he believed she was
having  an  extramarital  affair.  (Tr.  32-33)  Applicant  and  his  spouse  argued  for  several
hours.  (Unless  another  citation  is  indicated,  the  information  in  this  paragraph  is  from  a
police report, GE 5 at 4, 6-9) They engaged in mutual shoving. (Tr. 67) She took a photo
album into the kitchen and began burning photographs. (Tr. 67) His spouse said Applicant
pulled  her  hair,  pushed  her  into  the  sink,  grabbed  her  crotch,  and  made  negative
comments  about  her  crotch.  (Id.  at  4,  6)  Applicant  said  he  could  have  pulled  her  hair;
however, he did not remember pulling her hair. (Tr. 67-68) She responded by calling the
police. Applicant admitted the mutual pushing, and that he pushed her away from the stove
because she was trying to burn photos of his deceased father. (Id. at 4)
The police arrested Applicant for the August 2019 altercation, and Applicant was
charged with assault and battery. (Id. at 4, 9) Applicant told the magistrate “he pushed her
by  the  stove,  and  also  that  he  may  have  pulled  her  hair.”  (Id.  at  4)  The  disposition
information  relating  to  Applicant’s  assault  and  battery  charge  is  not  part  of  the  record.
Applicant  said  he  did  not  understand  whether  the  court  proceeding  included  a  plea  of
guilty. (Tr. 57, 64) On December 2, 2019, Applicant paid $450 to enable him to begin  a
court-ordered 18-week domestic violence course. (Tr. 33-34, 57-58; AE K) Applicant said
he started the course. (Tr. 34) Applicant said he will be on probation until October 2020.
(Tr. 58) He might be able to have the charges dismissed. (Tr. 66)
Financial Considerations
Applicant  is  currently  unemployed,  and  he  was  unemployed  from  July  2017,  to
January  2018,  and  from  June  2006,  to  August  2007.  (Tr.  28,  44-45;  GE  1;  GE  2  at  3)
Applicant said he was unable to pay some of his debts because of unemployment. (Tr. 35-
36) He has a 70 percent disability rating from the Department of Veterans Affairs. (Tr. 29)
The SOR alleges three delinquent debts totaling $34,013 as follows:
SOR  ¶  4.a  alleges  Applicant  has  a  charged-off  credit-card  debt  for  $20,140.
Applicant’s June 27, 2019 Equifax credit report indicates this debt was $5,879 past due,
and  was  reported  delinquent  in  May  2017.  (AE  D  at  21)  On  November  15,  2019,  the
creditor wrote the debt was settled for $12,175, and the debt is resolved. (Tr. 34, 64-65;
AE  J)  Applicant’s  January  6,  2020  TransUnion  credit  report  reflects  a  zero  balance,
“Account paid in Full; was a Charge-off,” and “SETTLED-LESS THAN FULL.” (AE R at 2)
SOR  ¶  4.b  alleges  Applicant  has  a  store  debt  placed  for  collection  for  $9,878.
Applicant’s June 27, 2019 Equifax credit report indicates the debt was in collections until
May 2019 when a $4,270 payment was due as a balloon payment. (AE D at 9-10) In June
2019,  the  creditor  sent  Applicant  a  bill  for  $4,270.  (AE  G)  Applicant’s  January  6,  2020
TransUnion credit report reflects a zero balance, “Account Paid in Full; was a Collection,”
and “SETTLED LESS THAN FULL.” (Tr. 34-35, 64-65; AE R at 3)
SOR ¶ 4.c alleges Applicant has a delinquent vehicle debt for $3,995. Applicant’s
June  27,  2019  Equifax  credit  report  indicates  the  debt  was  $3,769  past  due,  and  was
charged-off  in  the  amount  of  $16,026.  (AE  D  at  50)  The  debt  became  delinquent  in
September  2017.  (AE  D  at  50)  Applicant’s  January  6,  2020  TransUnion  credit  report
reflects a zero balance, “Account paid in Full; was a Charge-off,” and “SETTLED-LESS
THAN FULL.” (Tr. 35, 64-65; AE R at 6-7)
In addition to the SOR alleged debts, Applicant paid a charged-off credit-card debt
for $6,747 for less  than  the full  amount  in  April 2019.  (AE  D at  24-25) He  had multiple
accounts in “pays as agreed status,” including a mortgage for about $696,000. (AE D at
33-35) In July 2019, Applicant received financial counseling and generated a budget. (Tr.
36;  AE  E;  AE  S)  His  budget  indicated  his  net  monthly  income  is  $4,500;  his  monthly
expenses total $4,256; monthly debt payments are $525; and his monthly remainder is
$219.  (AE  E  at  3-4;  AE  S  at  3-4)  According  to  his  budget,  his  spouse  pays  part of  the
mortgage. (AE E at 3-4; AE S at 3-4) Applicant said he withdrew $50,000 from his Thrift
Savings Plan account and used the funds to pay all of his delinquent debts. (Tr. 44-45, 63)
Applicant has filed all of his state and federal tax returns for the previous five years.
Character Evidence
In 2019, Applicant received an excellent annual performance evaluation. (AE P) A
co-worker  who  has  known  Applicant  for  nine  months,  a  co-worker  and  friend  who  has
known him for two years, a friend who has known him for 10 years, a friend and co-worker
who has known him for more than three years, and a major who has known him for a year
provided letters supporting Applicant’s access to classified information. (AE I; AE Q) The
general sense of their letters is that Applicant is trustworthy, professional, diligent, highly
motivated, an exceptional leader, helpful, intelligent, and innovative. (AE I; AE Q) Applicant
provides important contributions to mission accomplishment. The letters did not indicate
his character references were aware of the contents of the SOR.
Nigeria
Nigeria  is  the  largest  economy  and  most  populous  country  in  Africa  with  an
estimated population of more than 190 million, which is expected to grow to 400 million
by 2050 and become the third most populous country in the world after China and India.
Nigeria had an estimated gross domestic product of 375 billion USD in 2018. Although
Nigeria’s economy has become more diversified, crude oil sales have continued to be the
main source of export earnings and government revenues. Despite persistent structural
weaknesses such as a deficient transportation infrastructure, the Nigerian economy grew
briskly for the decade ending in 2013. The growth rate slowed in 2014, owing in large part
to the fall in oil prices, and in 2016 and 2017 Nigeria experienced its first recession in over
two  decades  before  rebounding  in  2018.  The  gains  from  economic  growth  have  been
uneven; more than 60% of the population lives in poverty.
The United States is the largest foreign investor in Nigeria, with U.S. foreign direct
investment concentrated largely in the petroleum/mining and wholesale trade sectors. At
$2.2 billion in 2017, Nigeria is the second largest U.S. export destination in Sub-Saharan
Africa. The United States and Nigeria have a bilateral trade and investment framework
agreement. In 2017, the two-way trade in goods between the United States and Nigeria
totaled over $9 billion. . . .  Nigeria and the United States belong to a number of the same
international  organizations,  including  the  United  Nations,  International  Monetary  Fund,
World  Bank,  and  World  Trade  Organization.  Nigeria  also  is  an  observer  to  the
Organization of American States.
Nigeria  is  a  federal  republic  composed  of  36  states  and  the  Federal  Capital
Territory. In 2015, President Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressives Congress party
was elected to a four-year term in the first successful democratic transfer of power from
a  sitting  president  in  the  country’s  history.  In  February  2019,  he  was  re-elected  for  a
second  term.  Notwithstanding  important  steps  forward  on  consolidating  democracy,
Nigeria continues to face the formidable challenges of terrorist attacks, inter-communal
conflicts, crime, kidnapping, and public mistrust of the government.
The U.S. Department of State travel advisory for Nigeria is Level 3: Reconsider
Travel due to crime, terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, and maritime crimes; and
Level 4: Do Not Travel to Borno and Yobe States and Northern Adamawa State due to
terrorism.  (emphasis  in  original)  The  U.S.  Embassy  has  limited  ability  to  provide
emergency  services  to  U.S.  citizens  beyond  Abuja  and  Lagos  and  their  immediate
surrounding areas. U.S. Government employees are subject to movement constraints as
security conditions warrant. Both Abuja and Lagos are assessed by the Department of
State as being high-threat locations for terrorist activity directed at or affecting official U.S.
Government interests. U.S. Government personnel are currently prohibited from traveling
to Borno due to terrorist threats against United States and European citizens located in
Borno.
Boko Haram, and ISIS-West Africa, both of which are designated Foreign Terrorist
Organizations,  are  active  in  Nigeria.  Boko  Haram  seeks  to  replace  the  Nigerian
government with an Islamic state, establish an Islamic caliphate across Africa, avenge
military offenses against the group, and destroy any political or social activity associated
with Western society. It conducts attacks primarily on civilian and regional military targets.
ISIS-West Africa also seek to implement its strict interpretation of Sharia and replace the
Nigerian government with an Islamic state.
Boko  Haram  and  ISIS-West  Africa  continued  to  conduct  attacks  against
government  and  security  forces  in  the  northeast,  which  resulted  in  deaths,  injuries,
abductions,  and  the  capture  and  destruction  of  property.  Boko  Haram  attacks  did  not
appear  to  discriminate  between  civilians  and  government  officials,  whereas  ISIS-West
Africa  tended  to  generally  focus  on  government  and  security  forces,  while  trying  to
cultivate  stronger  ties  with  local  communities,  including  by  providing  limited  social
services.  The  Nigerian  military  has  expanded  its  presence  in  parts  of  northeastern
Nigeria, but the northeast remains an active zone of combat, as Boko Haram and ISIS-
West Africa insurgents continue to carry out attacks.
While  Boko  Haram  no  longer  controls  as  much  territory  as  it  once  did,  the  two
insurgencies nevertheless maintain the ability to stage forces in rural areas and launch
attacks against civilian and military targets across the northeast. Boko Haram continued
to employ indiscriminate suicide bombings targeting the local civilian populations. ISIS-
West  Africa  targeted  civilians  with  attacks  and  kidnappings  less  frequently  than  Boko
Haram, but employed targeted acts of violence and intimidation against civilians in order
to expand its area of influence and gain control over critical economic resources. As part
of a violent and deliberate campaign, ISIS-West Africa also targeted government figures,
traditional leaders, and contractors. Both groups have carried out more than 600 to 700
attacks  in  Nigeria  using  small  arms,  captured  military  equipment,  suicide  bombers,
improvised  explosive  devices  (IEDs),  vehicle-borne  (VB)  IEDs,  ambushes,  and
kidnappings.
In  2018,  Boko  Haram  recruited  and  forcefully  conscripted  child  soldiers,  and  it
carried  out  scores  of  suicide  bombings,  many  by  young  women  and  girls  forced  into
service. The group conducted abductions and subjected many abducted women and girls
to sexual and gender-based violence, including forced marriage and rape. The Nigerian
government investigated attacks by Boko Haram and ISIS-West Africa and took steps to
prosecute their members, although the majority of suspected insurgent group supporters
were held in military custody without charge.
Other human rights issues reported in Nigeria during 2018 included unlawful and
arbitrary killings, forced disappearances, and torture by both government and non-state
actors;  prolonged  arbitrary  detention  in  life-threatening  conditions,  particularly  in
government  detention facilities;  harsh and  life-threatening  civilian  detentions  in military
facilities,  often  based  on  flimsy  or  no  evidence;  and  infringement  on  citizens’  privacy
rights.  The  government  took  steps  to  investigate  alleged  abuses  but  fewer  steps  to
prosecute officials who committed violations. Impunity remained widespread at all levels
of government.
",True
"Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations, with explanations. After a thorough
and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  testimony,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant is 48 years old and married, with one child. He is applying for national
security  eligibility  and  a  security  clearance  in  connection  with  his  employment  with  a
defense contractor as a hazardous material technician.
Paragraph 1 – Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and
Paragraph 2 – Guideline C (Foreign Preference)
The  Government  alleged  in  Paragraph  1  of  the  SOR  that  Applicant  is  ineligible
for  clearance  because  he  has  foreign  contacts  or  interests  that  may  result  in  divided
allegiance. The Government further alleged in Paragraph 2 of the SOR that Applicant is
ineligible for clearance because he has acted in such a way as to show a preference for
another country over the United States.
Applicant  was  born  in  the  Philippines  in  1971.  He  immigrated  to  the  United
States,  along  with  his  family,  in  1988.  Applicant  joined  the  US  Navy  in  1989.  He  was
naturalized as an American citizen in 1993. Applicant retired from the Navy as a Master
at Arms First Class (E-6) in 2009. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 9 and 15; Tr. 14-
15.)
Applicant met his wife while stationed in the United States. They were married in
1994. She is also a naturalized American citizen of Filipino ancestry. Their son was born
in the United States in 2001, and is about to join the US Navy. Applicant’s wife, son and
father, also an American citizen, all currently live in the Philippines. Once his son enlists
in  the  Navy,  the  plan  is  for  Applicant’s  wife  to  join  Applicant  in  the  country  where  he
currently works. Eventually, Applicant and his wife plan to return to the United States as
their primary residence. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 17 and 18; Tr. 15-16.)
Applicant  and  his  family  moved  to  the  Philippines  after  his  retirement  in  2009.
Applicant  reacquired  Philippine  citizenship  in  2009,  in  expectation  of  living  full-time  in
the  Philippines.  He  lived  in  the  Philippines with  his family  until 2015,  when  he  went  to
work for the Navy as a contractor in another country. When in the Philippines during that
period,  Applicant  went  to  school.  (Government  Exhibit  1  at  Section  12,  Government
Exhibit 2 at 7; Tr. 17-18.)
Applicant’s wife, with minimal help from Applicant, ran a chicken rotisserie stand
business in the Philippines for about three years. The business closed in 2015 or 2016
due to unprofitability. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section 20A; Tr. 18-19.)
While living in the Philippines, Applicant and his wife bought a house and some
land.  The  house  is  worth  approximately  $138,000.  The  land  is  worth  about  $32,000.
Applicant  plans  to  sell  the  land,  since  he  and  his  wife  have  decided  not  to  build  on  it.
(Government Exhibit 1 at Section 20A; Tr. 19-21.)
In  connection  with  the  business,  and  the  properties  they  purchased,  Applicant
and his wife had three bank accounts in the Philippines. None of the accounts had a lot
of  money,  and  at  least  one  of  them  has  been  closed.  (Government  Exhibit  2  at  8;
Applicant Exhibits F and G; Tr. 22.)
Applicant realized that he would have to renounce his Philippine citizenship when
he went back to work with the Navy. To that end, he renounced that citizenship in the
presence  of  his  security  officer  on  February  10,  2016  He  also  had  his  Philippine
citizenship  document  destroyed,  and  verified  his  allegiance  only  to  the  United  States.
(Government Exhibit 2 at 6, Government Exhibit 3; Tr. 21-22.)
Applicant provided a copy of his most recent American passport, valid from April
2013 to April 2023. That passport showed many Filipino visa stamps during the period
Applicant still had dual citizenship with the Philippines. (Applicant Exhibit C.)
Paragraph 3 – Guideline E (Personal Conduct)
The  Government  alleged  in  this  paragraph  that  Applicant  is  ineligible  for
clearance because he  made  intentional misstatements  on  an Electronic Questionnaire
for  Investigations  Processing  he  filled  out  on  February  15,  2016.  (Government  Exhibit
1.)  Applicant  argued  that  any  misstatements  he  made  on  the  form  were  mistakes  and
unintentional on his part.
3.a.  Section  17  of  Government  Exhibit  1  concerns  Applicant’s  marital  status.  In
answering  that  question  Applicant  properly  identified  his  spouse,  that  she  was  born  in
the  Philippines,  and  was  an  American  citizen.  The  questionnaire  also  asked,  “Provide
your  spouse’s  country(ies)  of  citizenship.”  Applicant  stated  that  his  wife  was  an
American  citizen.  He  did  not  further  identify  her  as  also  being  a  dual  citizen  of  the
Philippines.  Applicant  testified  that  he  misread  the  questionnaire  on  that  point,  noting
that it is formatted differently than Section 10 of Government Exhibit 1, which concerned
Applicant’s dual or multiple citizenship information. (Tr. 23-25.)
3.b. Section 20A of Government Exhibit 1 concerns Applicant’s foreign activities.
Under  that  section,  he  identified  his  wife  as  the  owner  of  the  chicken  rotisserie  stand
described above. Applicant did not identify himself as being a co-owner. Applicant was
interviewed  by  an  investigator  for  the  State  Department  on  June  29,  2016.  In  that
interview he identified the business, stated it was not doing well financially, and that his
wife  was  going  to  close  it  down.  Applicant’s  involvement  in  this  business  was  passive
and minimal. (Government Exhibit 2 at 7-8; Tr. 25, 33.)
3.c.  Section  20A  goes  on  to  ask  about  foreign  property  that  is  owned  by
Applicant.  He  properly  identified  the  house  as  belonging  to  himself  and  his  wife.  He
stated that the additional property was owned by his cohabitant. Applicant testified that
he  was  confused  by  this  answer  himself,  since  it  was  obviously  wrong.  Applicant  told
the State Department investigator in June 2016 that the additional property was owned
by  himself  and  his  wife,  as  shown  in  the  Report  of  Investigation  (ROI).  (Government
Exhibit 2 at 8; Tr. 25-27.)
3.d. Finally, Section 20A asks about any bank accounts Applicant may have in a
foreign country. Applicant did not identify the three bank accounts he and his wife had in
the Philippines. Applicant fully identified these accounts during his June 2016 interview,
after admitting to the interviewer that he should have listed them. Applicant testified that
he  overlooked  the  specific  part of  the  question  that  concerned  foreign  bank  accounts.
(Government Exhibit 2 at 8; Tr. 27-29.)
Mitigation
Applicant  had  a  successful  20-year  career  in  the  Navy.  He  received  many
personal decorations. In addition, he has been successful after his return to the Navy as
a  civilian  employee,  as  shown  by  positive  evaluations  and  commendations.  (Applicant
Exhibits A, B, and E.)
The Philippines
I take administrative notice of the following facts. The Philippines is a multi-party
constitutional  republic.  There  are  terroristic  threats  in  several  parts  of  the  Philippines,
particularly  in  the  south.  In  addition,  there  are  allegations  of  human  rights  abuses  by
members of the security forces.
The State Department’s “U.S. Relations With the Philippines: Bilateral Relations
Fact Sheet” states:
U.S.-Philippine  relations  are  based  on  strong  historical  and  cultural
linkages and a shared commitment to democracy and human rights. The
1951 U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty provides a strong foundation
for  our  robust  security  partnership,  which  began  during  World  War  II.
Strong people-to-people ties and economic cooperation provide additional
avenues  to  engage  on  a  range  of  bilateral,  regional,  and  global  issues.
The  U.S.-Philippine  Bilateral  Strategic  Dialogue  is  the  annual  forum  for
forward planning across the spectrum of our relationship. There are more
than four million U.S. citizens of Philippine ancestry in the United States,
and more  than  350,000  U.S.  citizens  in  the  Philippines,  including  a  large
number  of  United  States  veterans.  An  estimated  650,000  U.S.  citizens
visit  the  Philippines  each  year.  .  .  .  Manila  is  home  to  the  only  Veterans
Administration  regional  office  outside  the  United  States.  (United  States

Fact  Sheet,
",True
"Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations with some clarifications. (Tr. 10; HE
3)  He  also  provided  mitigating  information.  (HE  3)  His  admissions  are  incorporated
herein  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  complete  and  thorough  review  of  the  evidence  of
record, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  56-year-old  linguist,  and  DOD  contractors  have  employed  him
since April 2015 in Iraq. (Tr. 23) Shortly after his hearing, he returned to Iraq to continue
his  linguist  duties.  (Tr.  26)  His  annual  salary  as  a  linguist  is  $80,000.  (Tr.  23)  Before
becoming a linguist, he worked in a hotel as a cook. (Tr. 23) In Iraq, before coming to
the  United  States,  he  worked  in  the  oil  industry.  (Tr.  47)  Applicant  and  his  family  are
Roman Catholic,3 and he and his wife are from the Kurdistan region of Iraq. (Tr. 51-52,
54)
In 1984, Applicant received a technical degree with a specialty in petroleum. (AE
A)  From  1985  to  1987,  he  performed  mandatory  service  in  the  Iraqi  army.  (AE  A)  In
1989, he married, and his children are ages 24, 27, and 28. (Tr. 18-20) His spouse is 56
years old. (Tr. 22) His children are citizens and residents of the United States. (Tr. 19-
21) His father-in-law and mother-in-law are citizens and residents of the United States,
and in 2006, they arranged for Applicant, his spouse, and their children’s immigration to
the  United  States  from  Iraq.  (Tr.  21-22,  53)  In  2012,  Applicant  and  his  spouse  were
naturalized  as  U.S.  citizens.  (Tr.  52)  He  has  property  in  the  United  States  including  a
home and about $22,000 in his U.S. bank account. (Tr. 24; AE F)
The SOR alleges that Applicant has three relatives living in Iraq.  His father and
one sister are citizens and residents of Kurdistan, a region of Iraq. (Tr. 26; SOR ¶¶ 1.a
and 1.b; GE 1) His father and sister live together. (Tr. 27) His father is 84 years old and
suffers from cancer and high blood pressure. (Tr. 38) His mother is deceased. (Tr. 40)
His  most  recent  visit  with  his  father  was  in 2012, and  he most  recently  communicated
with his father or sister two or three years ago. (Tr. 27-28) He does not send money to
his father or sister in Iraq. (Tr. 28) He does not own property or bank accounts in Iraq.
(Tr. 28-29) When his father dies, he does not plan to go to Iraq for his father’s funeral,
and his father’s property in Iraq will go to his sister in Iraq. (Tr. 39-41) His only visits to
Iraq after 2012 were on behalf of his employer. (Tr. 41)
Applicant  has  a  sister  who  lived  in  Iraq  and  is  a  citizen  of  Iraq.  She  currently
resides  in  Germany  with  her  husband.  (Tr.  29;  SOR  ¶  1.c)  He  communicates  with  his
sister  in  Germany,  who  provides  information  to  Applicant  about  his  family  in  Iraq.  (Tr.

of  other  groups,  or  locations  in  order  to  protect  Applicant’s  and  his  family’s  privacy.  The  cited  sources

3 In accordance with “well established DoD policy [Applicant and his family’s] religious affiliation
play[ed] no part” in this decision. ISCR Case No. 08-06795 at 6 n. 3 (App. Bd. May 25, 2012).
Foreign Preference
Applicant  is  not  fluent  in  English.  He  admitted  twice  that  he  voted  in  an  Iraqi
election  in  2014.  (Tr.  30;  SOR  response;  Officer  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)
personal  subject  interview  (PSI);  GE  2)  In  his  OPM  PSI,  which  is  the  investigator’s
summary of his statement, he said he voted because he wanted to help Iraq become a
better  democratic  country  like  the  United  States.  (Tr.  44;  GE  2)  He  may  have  simply
agreed  with  the  OPM  investigator’s  statements  about  voting.  Applicant  explained  in
broken  English,  “It’s  not  a  vote.  There  was  misunderstood  for  me  in  that  question,
because they, did you practice or did you exercise this election. I said yes. Yeah I work
on it. I’m not vote in it.” (Tr. 31) He said he did not understand English “very good,” and “I
work there. It’s not vote.” (Tr. 44) “I see a lot of Iraqis they come to vote. That one they
vote in Iraq and they vote. For that I say it’s allowed to Iraqis to vote who’s living in the
U.S. . . . So for that I say they allowed to me. But I’m not voted on.” (Tr. 45-46) He was
unable to clarify the content of the summary in his OPM PSI, possibly because he could
not  understand  the  questions  about  it;  however,  he  insisted  that  he  did  not  vote  in  the
Iraqi election. (Tr. 49)
In  2010  and  2014,  Applicant  worked  as  a  volunteer  while  living  in  the  United
States to help expatriate Iraqis living in the United States vote in Iraqi elections. (Tr. 31-
32,  47)  He  was  paid  in  2014;  however,  he  was  unsure  if  he  was  paid  in  2010  for  this
work.  (Tr.  31-32;  42-43)  He  did  not  say  whether or not  the Iraqi  or  U.S.  government or
some other entity paid him in 2014.
Applicant did not believe he continued to have Iraqi citizenship, and in any event,
he  was  willing  to  renounce  his  Iraqi  citizenship.  (Tr.  50)4  In  2012,  he  took  the
Naturalization Oath of Allegiance to the United States of America (AE H) which states:
I  hereby  declare,  on  oath,  that  I  absolutely  and  entirely  renounce  and
abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or
sovereignty, of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen;
that  I  will  support  and  defend  the  Constitution  and  laws  of  the  United
States  of  America  against  all  enemies,  foreign  and  domestic;  that  I  will
bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I will bear arms on behalf
of  the  United  States  when  required  by  the  law;  that  I  will  perform
noncombatant  service  in  the  Armed  Forces  of  the  United  States  when
required by the law; that I will perform work of national importance under
civilian  direction  when  required  by  the  law;  and  that  I  take  this  obligation
freely,  without any  mental  reservation  or  purpose of evasion;  so  help me
God.5
4 The Iraqi Council of the Presidency issued Article 10(I), which states, “An Iraqi who acquires a
foreign  nationality  shall  retain  his  Iraqi  nationality,  unless  he  has  declared  in  writing  renunciation  of  his
Iraqi nationality.” Iraqi Official Gazette Issue 4019 dated March 7, 2006, No. 26, https://www.refworld.org/
pdfid/4b1e364c2.pdf.
5  The  language  of  the  current  Oath  of  Allegiance  is  found  in  the  Code  of  Federal  Regulations
Section 337.1 and is closely based upon the statutory elements in Section 337(a) of the Immigration and
Nationality  Act.  U.S.  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Services,  8  U.S.C.  §  1448,  https://www.uscis.gov/us-

Character Evidence
Applicant  serves  as  a  linguist  for  the  U.S.  Army  in  Iraq.  (Tr.  25)  He  goes  on
patrols outside his base with soldiers, and he wears a helmet and vest outside his base.
(Tr. 25; AE I) He is not permitted to carry a weapon. (Tr. 26) He does not visit his family
in  Iraq.  (Tr.  26)  He  is not  authorized  to  leave  the  Army base  or  to  have  visitors  at  the
Army base. (Tr. 26) He provided photographs of Army personnel he served with in Iraq.
(Tr. 32-36; AE I) He was present in camp when an Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIL)
vehicle-borne  improvised  explosive  device  (IED)  exploded  and  caused  damage  to  his
camp. (Tr. 36-37; AE I) ISIL or some other terrorists fired at his patrol three times when
he was in Iraq; however, he was not injured. (Tr. 51)
On  April  19,  2018,  an  Army  colonel  and  Task  Force  commander,  who  served
with Applicant in Iraq from August 2017 to April 2018, wrote:
[Applicant’s] dedication, professionalism and positive demeanor positively
impacted the Task Force’s ability to communicate, coordinate and execute
operations in close partnership with Iraqi senior leaders. [Applicant] could
always  be  counted  upon  to  assist  with  requirements,  going  above  and
beyond to accomplish the mission. His superb knowledge of the language
and culture directly impacted the unit’s ability to achieve mission success
and he was an indispensable member of the team.
(AE  B).  A  major  who  served  with  Applicant  in  2017  lauded  Applicant  for  his
professionalism, diligence, and contributions to mission accomplishment. (AE B) In 2016,
an  Infantry  lieutenant  colonel  commanding  a  battalion  observed  that  Appellant
enthusiastically  volunteered  to  move  with  the  unit  into  a  more  dangerous  and
inhospitable  area  of  the  conflict.  (AE B)  He  too  lauded  Appellant’s professionalism  and
contributions to mission accomplishment. (AE B)
Applicant provided five certificates of appreciation from units in Iraq praising him
for  his  contributions  to  mission  accomplishment.  (AE  C)  They  described  his  diligent,
professional, and honorable service as a linguist. (AE C)
Iraq
The U.S. Mission in Iraq remains dedicated to building a strategic partnership with
Iraq and the Iraqi people. The December 2011 departure of U.S. troops from Iraq marked
a milestone in our relationship as Iraq continues to develop as a sovereign, stable, and
self-reliant country. Iraq is now a key partner for the United States in the region as well
as  a  voice  of  moderation  and  democracy  in  the  Middle  East.  Iraq  has  functioning
government  institutions  including  an  active  legislature,  is  playing  an  increasingly
constructive role in the region, and has a bright economic future as oil revenues surpass
pre-Saddam  production  levels  with  continued  rapid  growth  to  come.  The  United  States
maintains  vigorous  and  broad  engagement  with  Iraq  on  diplomatic,  political,  economic,
and security issues in accordance with the U.S.-Iraq Strategic Framework Agreement.
The  Strategic  Framework  Agreement  (SFA)  between  Iraq  and  the  United  States
provides the basis for the U.S.-Iraq bilateral relationship. It covers the range of bilateral
issues  including  political  relations  and  diplomacy,  defense  and  security,  trade  and
finance,  energy,  judicial  and  law  enforcement  issues,  services,  science,  culture,
education,  and  environment.  Efforts  to  implement  the  SFA  are  overseen  by  the  Higher
Coordinating  Committee  and  several  Joint  Coordination  Committees,  which  meet
periodically.
The  U.S.  State  Department  warns  that  U.S.  citizens  in  Iraq  are  at  high  risk  for
violence  and  kidnapping,  and  advises  U.S.  citizens  not  to  travel  to  Iraq.  The  current
travel advisory level is Level 4: Do not travel.
The  ability  of  the  U.S.  Embassy  to  provide  consular  services  to  U.S.  citizens
outside  Baghdad  is  limited  given  the  security  environment.  Anti-U.S.  sectarian  militias
may  threaten  U.S.  citizens  and  western  companies  throughout  Iraq.  Kidnappings  and
attacks  by  IEDs  occur  in  many  areas  of  the  country,  including  Baghdad.  Methods  of
attack  have  included  explosively  formed  penetrators  (EFPs),  magnetic  IEDs  placed  on
vehicles,  human  and  vehicle-borne  IEDs,  mines  placed  on  or  concealed  near  roads,
mortars and rockets, and shootings using various direct fire weapons. Such attacks may
take place in public venues such as cafes and markets.
Iraq  witnessed  continued  terrorist  activity  in  2016,  primarily  as  a  result  of  the
actions of ISIL. In 2016, ISIL remained the greatest terrorist threat globally, maintaining a
formidable  force  in  Syria,  including  a  large  number  of  foreign  terrorist  fighters.  ISIL’s
capacity  and  territorial  control  in  Iraq  has  dramatically  eroded  in  the  past  two  years.
According  to  estimates  from  the  UN  Assistance  Mission  for  Iraq,  acts  of  terrorism  and
violence  killed  more  than  7,000  civilians  and  injured  more  than  12,000  in  2016.  By  the
end  of  2017,  Iraqi  Security  Forces  had  liberated  all  territory  from  ISIL,  drastically
reducing ISIL’s ability to commit abuses and atrocities. Human rights violations continue
to  be  a  problem  with  allegations  of  unlawful  killings  and  other  abuses  being  made
against the Iraqi Security Forces and Popular Mobilization Forces.
In  its  annual  human  rights  report,  the  U.S.  Department  of  State  reported  that
severe  human  rights  problems  were  widespread.  Sectarian  hostility,  widespread
corruption,  and  lack  of  transparency  at  all  levels  of  government  and  society  weakened
the  government's  authority  and  worsened  effective  human  rights  protections.  Iraqi
Security  Forces,  members  of  the  Federal  Police,  and  the  Peshmerga  committed  some
human rights violations, and there continued to be reports of Popular Mobilization Forces
killing,  torturing,  kidnapping,  and  extorting  civilians.  ISIL  committed  the  overwhelming
majority of serious human rights abuses, including attacks against: civilians, (particularly
Shia  but  also  Sunnis  who  opposed  ISIL);  members  of  other  religious  and  ethnic
minorities; women; and children.
Observers  also  reported  other  significant  human  rights-related  problems:  harsh
and  life-threatening  conditions  in  detention  and  prison  facilities;  arbitrary  arrest  and
lengthy  pretrial  detention,  denial  of  fair  public  trial;  insufficient  judicial  institutional
capacity;  ineffective  implementation  of  civil  judicial  procedures  and  remedies;  arbitrary
interference  with  privacy  and  homes;  child  soldiers;  limits  on  freedom  of  expression,
including  press  freedoms;  violence  against  and  harassment  of  journalists;  undue
censorship;  social,  religious,  and  political  restrictions  in  academic  and  cultural  matters;
limits on freedoms of peaceful assembly and association; limits on religious freedom due
to  violence  by  extremist  groups;  restrictions  on  freedom  of  movement;  refugee  and
internally  displaced  persons  (IDP)  abuse;  both  forced  IDP  returns  and  preventing  IDPs
from  returning  home;  discrimination  against  and  societal  abuse  of  women  and  ethnic,
religious, and racial minorities, including exclusion from decision-making roles; trafficking
in  persons;  societal  discrimination  and  violence  against  lesbian,  gay,  bisexual,
transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) persons; seizure of property without due process; and
limitations on worker rights.
The  United  States’  extraordinary  commitment  to  Iraq  is  balanced  against  the
inherent dangers of the ongoing conflict in Iraq to its citizens and residents and the Iraqi
government’s  problems  developing  and  complying  with  the  rule  of  law.  A  top  national
security goal of the United States is to establish relationships, cooperation, training, and
support of the Iraqi Government and military in the ongoing war against terrorism.

At  the  time  of  his  2015  security  clearance  application  (SCA),  Applicant  had  an
Egyptian  passport  issued  in  2014  that  was  not  scheduled  to  expire  until  2021  (SOR  ¶
1.a). He indicated that when he traveled to Egypt, he did so on his U.S. passport; upon
arrival in Egypt, he used his Egyptian passport as identification to show that he was an
Egyptian  citizen,  because  it  was  convenient  for  him  to  do  so.  He  relinquished  his
Egyptian  passport  to  his  facility  security  officer  (FSO)  when  he  received  the  SOR  in
2017. He testified that he had no intentions of retrieving his Egyptian passport from his
FSO or obtaining another Egyptian passport in the future.6
Applicant’s second ex-wife is a citizen and resident of Egypt; their son is a dual
citizen of the United States and Egypt, residing with Applicant’s second ex-wife in Egypt
(SOR  ¶¶  2.a,  2.b).  Applicant  married  his  second  ex-wife  in  Egypt.  He  sponsored  her
move to the United States, but she never became a U.S. citizen. She returned to Egypt
in  November  2015  with  their  son,  and  Applicant  testified  that  he  has  not  since  had
contact with either of them. She works as an accountant for a bank in Egypt. Applicant
was unaware whether the bank was affiliated with the Egyptian government. Applicant
testified that she has custody of their son, according to Egyptian law, until he reaches
age 15, at which point he can choose the parent with whom he wants to live. Applicant
pays  $170  USD  monthly  in  child  support,  as  ordered  by  an  Egyptian  court,  through  a
money transfer service in which he wires the money to his 54-year-old brother.7
Applicant’s  mother,  former  mother-in-law,  four  brothers,  and  sister  are  citizens
and  residents  of  Egypt.  His  former  mother-in-law  and  sister  are  employed  by  the
Egyptian  government,  and  his  one  brother  was  formerly  employed  by  the  Egyptian
government (SOR ¶¶ 2.c - 2.g). He has not spoken to his former mother-in-law since his
2017 divorce. He indicated in his SCA that she worked for the Egyptian government. He
testified that he visits his family in Egypt approximately once every two to three years,
and he did so in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014 and 2016. He planned to visit them less
in the future, and testified that he would do so using his U.S. passport. He testified that
none  of  his  family  in  Egypt  are  aware  that  he  is  seeking  to  maintain  his  eligibility  for
access to sensitive information, and do not know the nature of his work.8
Applicant’s  mother  is  79  years  old.  His  54-year-old  brother  lives  with  her.  She
has never worked outside of the home. Applicant’s father was a teacher for the Egyptian

believe this brother had any current affiliations with the Egyptian government or military.
This brother’s wife and children continue to live in Egypt. Applicant talks to this brother
two  to  three  times  yearly.  Applicant  sent  him  $400  in around  early  2018,  because  this
brother  told  him  that  work  was  not  going  well  and  he  needed  to  send  money  to  his
family in Egypt.13
Applicant’s sister is 50 years old. She is married with five children. She works as
a  teacher  for  the  Egyptian  DOE.  Her  husband  owns  a  pharmacy.  Applicant  did  not
believe  her  husband  was  affiliated  with  the  Egyptian  government  or  military.  Applicant
talks to her by telephone once every three to four months.14
Applicant’s fifth brother, age 57, is a dual citizen of Egypt and the United States,
and has resided in the United States since approximately 1990. He is married with four
children; all are U.S. citizens. He works in media. Applicant talks and sees this brother
often. This brother occasionally sends money to their mother.15

From  2008  to  2016, Applicant  owned  an  apartment  in  Egypt;  its value  as  of  his
SCA  was  approximately  $40,000  USD  (SOR  ¶  2.h).  With  help  from  his  mother  and
siblings,  he  purchased  it  for  approximately  $10,000  USD  from  his  60-year-old  brother,
with the idea that he would use it with his family when he traveled to Egypt. He sold it
for  $25,000  USD  to  a  distant  relative,  and  he  gave  all  of  the  proceeds  to  his  family  in
Egypt. At the time of his SCA, he also had a bank account in Egypt. He opened it with
$200 USD between 2012 and 2014. He had returned to Egypt to live, while working as a
medical  interpreter  for  a  U.S.  company  and  completing  his  master’s  degree,  to  spend
time with his then-wife and son and complete their paperwork to immigrate to the United
States. He opened the account in the event he needed to transfer money to the United
States. He testified that he never used it. He does not own any other foreign property or
have any other foreign financial interests. He testified that he does not stand to own his
mother’s property in Egypt, which will likely be inherited by his siblings who live there.16
As  of  the  date  of  the  hearing,  Applicant’s  annual  salary  was  approximately
$53,000. He was renting a room in the United States since 2016, in the home of a friend
who  was  also  a  prior  roommate  from  2006.  He  has  leased  a  car  for  three  years  and
planned  to  buy  it.  He  has  a  bank  account  in  the  United  States  with  a  balance  of
approximately  $1,800.  He  has  a  retirement  account  with  a  balance  of  approximately
$13,000. He does not have any other assets in the United States. He was not affiliated
with any foreign governments. He has received annual security training. He testified that
he would report any attempts to blackmail or his family to his FSO.17
A  friend  of  Applicant  since  obtaining  their  certification  together  in  2011  testified
that  Applicant  is  a  solid  and  trustworthy  man.  Another  friend,  was  Applicant’s  former
roommate in 2006 and is Applicant’s current landlord, held a public trust position as of
the  date  of  the  hearing.  The  witness  testified  that  he  met  Applicant’s  brother  in  the
United States on at least two occasions, and he previously met Applicant’s ex-wife and
child. He testified that he did not believe Applicant to be a threat to the United States,
and described Applicant as a trustworthy man. Applicant’s supervisor since March 2017
stated that Applicant was a responsible caretaker of sensitive information and an asset
to the team. She rated him favorably in his 2016 to 2017 performance evaluation. Other
character  references  described  Applicant  as  a  dedicated,  compassionate,  and  honest
individual.18
Egypt
The  U.S.  Department  of  State  warns  U.S.  citizens  of  threats  from  terrorist
groups in Egypt, and to consider the risks of travel to the country. A number of terrorist
groups,  including  the  Islamic  State  of  Iraq  and  Syria  (ISIS)  have  committed  multiple
deadly attacks in Egypt. U.S. diplomatic personnel are prohibited from travel in parts of
Egypt, and U.S. citizens are warned to avoid those areas.

",True
"Applicant  is  34  years  old  and  Iraqi-born.  She  arrived  in  the  United  States  in
September 2007 and was naturalized in August 2013. Applicant earned her associate’s
degree in Iraq. Applicant was married in 2009 (to a U. S. citizen), had her son in 2010,
and was divorced in June 2016. Except for the period from April 2014 to December 2016,
Applicant  has  worked  for  defense  contractors  since  May  2003.  She  continues  to  be
employed by a defense contractor, but she has recently enlisted in the U. S. Navy. (GE
1; GE 2; AE A; AE P; Tr. 83-84.)
Under Guideline  B,  the  SOR  alleged  that:  (1) Applicant’s  parents,  two  brothers,
and  her  youngest  sister  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Iraq;  (2)  two  of  Applicant’s  other
sisters are citizens and residents of Iraq, worked as linguists for U. S. or coalition forces
in Iraq, and in 2009 they were deemed by U. S. intelligence to be security risks to U. S.
or coalition forces. Under Guideline C, the SOR alleged that as of April 2014, Applicant
was employed by the Cultural Mission of Saudi Arabia. (SOR ¶¶ 1. and 2.)
Applicant identified the immediate family members who were subjects of the SOR
in  her  April  2015  security  clearance  application  and  in  her  September  2016  security
clearance  application.  The  frequency  of  Applicant’s  telephone  calls  with  those  family
members in 2015 and in 2016 was about the same. Except for one brother employed as
a medical technician by the Iraqi government, those family members have no ties to the
Iraqi government or military. (GE 1, pp. 32-43; GE 2, pp. 24-35.)
Applicant admitted that her mother, her two brothers, and a sister are citizens and
residents of Iraq; she also answered that her father was a citizen and resident of Iraq but
that he died in October 2017. She admitted that two of her other sisters were citizens and
1 This action was taken under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within
Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, as well as Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,  Defense
Industrial  Personnel  Security Clearance Review Program (January  2,  1992), as  amended (Directive). In
addition, the Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information (AG),
effective within the Defense Department on June 8, 2017, apply here.
residents of Iraq and had been linguists, but she denied with explanations that those two
sisters assisted any anti-coalition forces in Iraq. Applicant answered that in April 2014 she
was employed as an administrative assistant with the Cultural Mission of Saudi Arabia
located in the United States, but that employment ended in December 2016. (Answer ¶¶
1. and 2.)
Applicant  testified  about  her  service  as  a  linguist  for  U.  S.  troops  in  Iraq.  She
started working as a linguist in Iraq at about 18 or 19 years of age. Applicant is fluent in
Arabic and English. Because of force-protection requirements, Applicant had to live and
work on base with U.S. troops. She could not leave the base, and her relatives could not
visit  her  on  base.  She  was  not  allowed  to  speak  with  her  relatives  while  working  as  a
linguist. Thus, from 2003 to 2007, she had little contact with her relatives while working
as a liguist. Although the durations of deployments varied, on average one deployment
was about 9 to 11 months straight. She left Iraq after having worked as linguist for U.S.
troops  in  Iraq  from  2003  to  2007.  Applicant  came  to  the  United  States  on  a  special
immigrant visa and was fast-tracked to naturalization due to her service as a linguist for
U. S. troops. Applicant’s resume details her six deployments to Iraq as a linguist from May
2003 to present. Those six deployments add up to more than six years spent in Iraq in
the service of U. S. troops and coalition forces. From March 2012 to April 2014, Applicant
worked for a defense contractor state-side training over 4,000 DOD and Department of
State employees in Iraqi and Middle Eastern culture. (Tr. 17-20, 42, 75-78; AE A.) She
was  on  deployment  to  Iraq  when  she  received  the  SOR  and  returned  to  the  U.S.  to
prepare  for  this  hearing.  (Tr.  43-44.)  Since  Applicant’s  arrival  in  the  United  States  in
September 2007, she has maintained her residences in the United States. (GE 1, pp. 12-
15; GE 2, pp. 9-11.)
Applicant  testified  about  her  contacts  with  her  immediate  family  members.  She
saw her siblings that are the subject of the SOR, when Applicant left Iraq in 2007 and
more recently in 2008 or 2009. The last time Applicant saw her mother was in 2010 or
2011, when Applicant and her then husband met her mother in Turkey, so that her mother
could meet Applicant’s then new-born son. Before that meeting, Applicant saw her mother
in 2007 and in 2008 or 2009. (GE 2, p. 42; Tr. 58-59, 78-79.)
When  Applicant  completed  her  most  recent  security  clearance  application
(September 2016), she was telephoning her mother and her oldest sister daily or every
two or three days. Applicant spoke with her oldest brother and her younger sister about
monthly and her youngest brother annually. Applicant’s calls to her mother and siblings
became  much  less  frequent.  There  are  two  reasons  for  that.  First,  Applicant  and  her
mother had a falling out. Applicant believed that her mother delayed an unseemly length
of time before notifying her that her father had passed away. Applicant missed her father’s
funeral. It angered Applicant, and she decided to stop talking to her mother. She has not
spoken  to her mother since  her father’s  death  in  October 2017.  Second,  in  December
2017, she received the SOR and interpreted it to mean that the U. S. Government did not
want her to talk to the family members identified in the SOR. Applicant did not want to
jeopardize her job, which she loves, and her life in the United States, which she loves and
considers this country to be her home.  So, she decided to stop communications with her
immediate family. She has no problem with that. Applicant did not tell her family why she
stopped  communicating  with  them.  Nor  did  she  tell  any  family  members  that  she  was
seeking a security clearance, and they do not know what she does for a living. (GE 1; Tr.
24-25, 28-30, 37-38, 51-55, 60-62, 65-67.)
Applicant testified about her oldest sister and her immediate younger sister who
the  SOR  alleged  were  deemed  by  an  Army  intelligence  command  in  May  2009  to  be
security  risks.  (GE  3  supports  those  allegations.)  Applicant  had  no  idea  about  those
allegations. She hopes they are not true. The first Applicant ever heard of such allegations
was when she received the SOR. She was only told by family that one or both of those
sisters  were  laid  off.  (Tr.  30-32,  63-64.)  GE  4  reports  on  an  October  27,  2016
counterintelligence screening of Applicant that confirmed that those individuals were her
sisters. Applicant had disclosed that fact in her “Relatives and Associates” form. As noted,
Applicant also disclosed that fact in her 2015 and 2016 security clearance applications.
The  frequency  of  telephone  contacts  Applicant  had  with  those  two  sisters  were
approximately the same in 2015 and 2016. (GE 1, pp. 32-43; GE 2, pp. 24-35.)
The family member alleged in SOR ¶ 1.g is Applicant’s youngest sister. Applicant
has not seen her since about 2007. She is about 19 years old and is either a student in
high school or in the first year of college. Applicant and this sister do not talk at all. (Tr.
32-34.) Applicant explained that when filling out her security clearance applications she
had to call her mother, because Applicant did not have first-hand knowledge of her family
members’ ages, marital status, and whether there were any nieces or nephews. (Tr. 80-
81.)
Applicant  testified  about  her employment  by  the  Saudi Arabian  Cultural Mission
from April 2014 to December 2016. She was an administrative assistant providing general
administrative and clerical support. Applicant said that the Cultural Mission and the Saudi
Arabian  Embassy  have  different  missions  and  have  different  locations  in  the  United
States. Unlike the traditional embassy mission, the Cultural Mission provides assistance
to Saudi Arabian students who are coming on a scholarship to study in the United States
for two years and then return home. Applicant left that job to take her current job with a
defense contractor. (Tr. 35-37; AE A.)
Applicant testified that she has no financial interests, real estate, or bank accounts
in Iraq. Her mother does not own any land in Iraq. Applicant has no retirement accounts
in  Saudi  Arabia.  Applicant  is  not  a  member  of  any  foreign  groups  or  associations.
Applicant  rents  her  home  here.  She  has  checking  and  savings  accounts  in  the  U.S.
Applicant also has 401(k) accounts with two former employers here.  (Tr. 36-37, 42-47;
AE M.) She submitted an affidavit stating her willingness to renounce any dual citizenship
she may be deemed to have with any foreign country. (AE E.)
Applicant testified about her son, who is nine. He loves baseball and is on a team.
Even if Applicant does not have her son on a weekend when he has a game, she attends
anyway to show support. Also, Applicant is teaching him soccer. She has a good working
relationship with her ex-spouse about caring for their son. When Applicant is deployed,
her ex-spouse cares for their son. When Applicant returns, they have joint custody and
share care-taking responsibilities. Applicant participates in the parent teacher association
at her son’s school. (Tr. 41-42, 46, 81-83; AE G, I, K, and R.)
Applicant submitted a number of letters of recommendation. Each of the authors
had first-hand knowledge of Applicant’s performance in the field as a linguist and cultural
advisor. One author is Applicant’s current site manager where Applicant is posted in Iraq.
He described her as “reliable and trustworthy” with “excellent and unmatched work ethic”
who  “performs  her  job  flawlessly.”  Another  unit  leader  who  has  known  Applicant  as  a
linguist in Iraq since October 2017 called her “professional and trustworthy.”
Another one of Applicant’s Iraq site managers wrote that he has worked with over
300 linguists during his Army career and as a defense contractor in Iraq and that Applicant
is the “most loyal, honest, and trustworthy” one that he’s ever worked with. He gave one
example.  Once  in  the  middle  of  the  night  an  emergency  arose  that  needed  a  linguist
immediately. He called Applicant who without a question jumped out of bed, handled the
mission, which took about two hours, and still showed up the next morning to perform her
daily duties. (AE B.)
An officer-in-charge of  a  unit  wrote  that  Applicant’s  “duties  have  covered  a  vast
number  military  subjects  and  cultural  advisory  roles.”  She  “has  consistently  exceeded
expectations.”  A  Senior  Counterintelligence  Support  Specialist  wrote  that  Applicant’s
“professionalism/expertise is in the top 10% of all the linguists I have worked with in the
last 12 years of being in the intelligence field.” (AE J.)
A Marine Colonel commanding officer of a task force penned a handwritten note
on a Certificate of Appreciation awarded to Applicant for a job well-done as a Linguist,
Translator, and Cultural Advisor from March 2017 to August 2017: “Thank you for all of
your hard work for the S-4 [Logistics], but especially with medical. Your linguistic skills
are exceptional and we will miss you.” (AE N.)
I take administrative notice of the following facts concerning Iraq as requested by
the  Government:  Iraq  faces  many  challenges  fueled  by  sectarian and  ethnic divisions.
Numerous terrorist groups and elements hostile to the United States remain active in Iraq.
Iraqi forces, with the assistance of the United States, have seen successes recently and
most of the territory previously held by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIL) has been
retaken. Threats of kidnapping and violence are high, and the Department of State warns
U.S.  citizens  that  all  but  essential  travel  to  Iraq  should  be  avoided.  Although  the
government  of  lraq  has  made  significant  progress  in  its  campaign  to  retake  occupied
territory from ISIL, there remains a security vacuum in parts of Iraq.
The  State  Department  warns  that  anti-U.S.  sectarian  militias  may  also  threaten
U.S. citizens and western companies throughout Iraq. Kidnappings and attacks by means
of improvised explosive devices occur frequently in many areas of the country, including
Baghdad.  Methods  of  attack  have  included  explosively  formed  penetrators,  magnetic
IEDs placed on vehicles, human and vehicle-borne IEDs, mines placed on or concealed
near roads, mortars and rockets, and shootings using various direct fire weapons. Such
attacks often take place in public venues such as cafes and markets.
The  U.S.  government  considers  the  potential  personal  security  threats  to  U.S.
government personnel in Iraq to be serious enough to require them to live and work under
strict security guidelines. All U.S. Government employees under the authority of the U.S.
Chief of Mission must follow strict safety and security procedures when traveling outside
the Embassy and Consulates.
In its annual human rights report, the U.S. Department of State reported that ISIL
committed the overwhelming number of serious human rights abuses, including attacks
against civilians, especially Shia but also Sunnis who opposed ISIL, members of other
religious  and  ethnic minorities,  women,  and children.  ISIL  members  committed acts  of
violence  on  a  mass  scale,  including  killing  by  suicide  bombings,  improvised  explosive
devices,  execution-style  shootings,  public  beheadings,  and  other  forms  of  executions.
Sectarian  hostility,  widespread  corruption,  and  lack  of  transparency  at  all  levels  of
government  and  society  weakened  the  Iraqi  government's  authority  and  worsened
effective human rights protections. (HE 1.)
Law and Policies
It  is  well-established  law  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.
Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (“it should be obvious that no one
has a ‘right’ to a security clearance”); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988,
994 (10th Cir. 2002) (no right to a security clearance).
As noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly
consistent  standard  indicates  that  security  clearance  determinations  should  err,  if  they
must, on the side of denials.” 484 U.S. at 531. Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and
the  Directive,  any  doubt  about  whether  an  applicant  should  be  allowed  access  to
classified information will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.
A favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted
a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information. Directive,
¶  3.2.  An  unfavorable  clearance  decision  (1)  denies  any  application,  (2)  revokes  any
existing security clearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.
Directive, ¶ 3.2.
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access to classified information. ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). The
Government has the burden of presenting evidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR
that have been controverted. Directive, ¶ E3.1.14.
An applicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate,
or  mitigate  facts  that  have  been  admitted  or  proven.  In  addition,  an  applicant  has  the
ultimate  burden  of  persuasion  to  obtain  a  favorable  clearance  decision.  Directive,
Enclosure 3, ¶ E3.1.15. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that the burden of proof is
less than a preponderance of evidence. 484 U.S. at 531. The Appeal Board has followed
the Court’s reasoning, and a judge’s findings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-
evidence standard. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).
Guideline B - Foreign Influence
Discussion
The foreign influence security concern is explained at AG ¶ 6:
Foreign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business,
financial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result
in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they
create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced
to  help  a  foreign  person,  group,  organization,  or  government  in  a  way
inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure
or  coercion  by  any  foreign  interest.  Assessment  of  foreign  contacts  and
interests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest
is located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is
known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or
is associated with a risk of terrorism.
An  individual  is  not  automatically  disqualified  from  holding  a  security  clearance
because they have connections and contacts in a foreign country. Instead, in assessing
an  individual’s  potential  vulnerability  to  foreign  influence,  an  administrative  judge  must
take into account the foreign government involved; the intelligence-gathering history of
that  government;  the  country’s  human-rights  record;  and  other  pertinent  factors.  ISCR
Case No. 05-03250 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 6, 2007) (setting forth factors an administrative
judge must consider in foreign influence cases).
The United States and Iraq are allies in the war against ISIL and other terrorists
and insurgents. The serious security threat posed by these terrorists and other elements
hostile to the United States must be taken into account in assessing the security concerns
raised  by  Applicant’s  family  members  in  Iraq.  Applicant’s  relationship  to  her  foreign
relatives,  coupled  with  the  facts  administratively  noticed,  raise  a  heightened  security
concern.
In  assessing  the  security  concern  raised  by  Applicant’s  foreign  contacts  and
interests,  I  have  considered  the  following  disqualifying  conditions  under  AG  ¶  7  and
mitigating conditions under AG ¶ 8:
AG  ¶  7(a):  contact,  regardless  of  method,  with  a  foreign  family  member,
business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen
of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk
of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;
AG ¶ 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country
that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation
to  protect  classified  or  sensitive  information  or  technology  and  the
individual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing
that information or technology;
AG ¶ 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country
in  which  these  persons  are  located,  or  the positions  or activities  of  those
persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed
in  a  position  of  having  to  choose  between  the  interests  of  a  foreign
individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.;
AG  ¶  8(b):  there  is  no  conflict  of  interest,  either  because  the  individual’s
sense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or
country  is  so  minimal,  or  the  individual  has  such  deep  and  longstanding
relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected
to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and
AG ¶ 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and
infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign
influence or exploitation.
An individual with family members and other connections in a foreign country faces
a  high,  but  not  insurmountable,  hurdle  in  mitigating  security  concerns  raised  by  such
foreign ties. An applicant is not required, however, “to sever all ties with a foreign country
before he or she can be granted access to  classified information.” ISCR Case No. 07-
13739 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 12, 2008). What factor or combination of factors will mitigate
security concerns raised by an applicant with family members in a foreign country is not
easily identifiable or quantifiable. ISCR Case No. 11-12202 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 23, 2014).
In  the  present  case,  Applicant’s  mother,  three  sisters,  and  two  brothers  are
admittedly citizens and residents of Iraq. Facts admitted by an applicant in an answer to
a SOR require no further proof by the Government. ISCR Case No. 94-1159 at 4 (App.
Bd. Dec. 4, 1995) (“any admissions [applicant] made to the SOR allegations . . . relieve
Department Counsel of its burden of proof”); ISCR Case No. 94-0569 at 4 and n.1 (App.
Bd.  Mar.  30,  1995)  (“[a]n  applicant’s  admissions,  whether  testimonial  or  written,  can
provide a legal basis for an Administrative Judge’s findings”). Therefore, AG ¶¶ 7(a) and
(b) apply. The next inquiry is whether the security concern is mitigated.
Applicant signed up as a linguist and a cultural advisor for U.S. and coalition forces
in Iraq in 2003, when she was about 18 or 19 years of age. The conditions of employment
were, that because of force protection measures, Applicant was required to live and work
alongside of U. S. and coalition troops in Iraq. She was not allowed to communicate in
any way with her immediate family members in Iraq while she was deployed. On average
her deployments to Iraq lasted between 9 and 11 months. Between 2003 and the present,
Applicant served six deployments in Iraq for a cumulative six years or more. That is more
time than many U. S. active duty service members spend in Iraq.
In 2007 Applicant came to the United States and was fast-tracked to naturalization
due to her service as a linguist in Iraq. She was naturalized in 2013. By that time, she had
married  (in  2009  to  a  U.S.  citizen)  and  had  given  birth  to  her  son  (in  2010).  Applicant
continued to make deployments to Iraq as a linguist, returning to the United States after
each deployment for a few months. Although her marriage ended in a divorce in June
2016, the parting was amicable. Her ex-spouse accommodates Applicant’s deployments
by caring for their son, and sharing childcare duties with Applicant when she returns from
her  deployments  to  Iraq. When  Applicant  is  back  from  Iraq  she  is  active  in  the  parent
teacher association of her son’s school. And she supports and encourages the baseball
team he plays for.
Because  of  the  restrictions  placed  on  Applicant’s  communications  with  family
members  while  she  is  deployed  to  Iraq,  over  the  past  16  years  communications  have
been  limited  to  phone  calls  while  Applicant  is  in  the  United  States  in  between
deployments.  Even  those  communications  have  been  curtailed  lately,  for  two  reasons.
First, Applicant and her mother had a falling out in October 2017 when Applicant’s father
died. Applicant was angered because her mother did not tell Applicant promptly about his
death. Applicant vowed not to call her mother or other family members. Second, Applicant
interpreted the SOR as signaling the Government’s disapproval of such communications.
The first reason is a deeply personal and credible one.  A version of the second reason
was argued by Department Counsel, comparing Applicant’s curtailment of phone calls to
a Guideline F (financial considerations) case where applicant makes post-SOR payments
to try to clean up his finances. I respectfully disagree that the analogy is an apt one. The
argument cuts against the DOHA jurisprudence discussed above, that an applicant need
not  sever  all  ties  to  the  foreign  country  of  her  birth  before  being  granted  a  security
clearance. In fact, Applicant’s decision to cut back on phone calls to her immediate family
shows her prudence and appreciation of the security concerns that such contacts might
create.
Applicant’s meetings with family members in Iraq have been rare. She last saw her
siblings in 2008 or 2009, about ten years ago. The last time Applicant saw her mother
was  in  2010  or  2011,  when  Applicant  and  her  then  spouse  traveled  to  Turkey,  so  her
mother could meet their then newborn son.
Applicant  has  no  financial  interests,  real  estate,  or  bank  accounts  in  Iraq.  Her
mother  does  not  own  any  land  in  Iraq.  Applicant  has  no  retirement  accounts  in  Saudi
Arabia. She is not a member of any foreign groups or associations. Applicant rents her
home here. Since Applicant arrived in the United States in 2007, she has maintained her
residences here. She has checking and savings accounts in the U.S. Applicant also has
401(k) accounts with two former employers here. Applicant’s family members do not know
what she does for a living. Nor do they know that she is seeking a security clearance.
Applicant’s  testimony  about  two  of  her  sisters  who  were  deemed  by  an  Army
intelligence command in May 2009 to be security risks was credible. Applicant flatly stated
that she had no knowledge about that situation until she received the SOR in December
2017. She also said that she hoped the allegations were not true but could shed no further
light on those allegations. Moreover, that intelligence finding is over a decade old.
The letters of recommendation submitted on Applicant’s behalf are uniform in their
superlative  praise  of  her  professionalism,  reliability,  and  trustworthiness.  Applicant’s
loyalty  to  the  U.S.  troops  in  Iraq  has  been  manifestly  shown.  Even  before  Applicant
became a United States citizen in 2013, by that time she had supported U. S. troops in
Iraq  for  ten  years.  And  she  is  continuing  that  support to  this  day.  I  find  that  mitigating
conditions AG ¶¶ 8(a) and (b) apply.
Guideline C - Foreign Preference
Under  Guideline  C  for  foreign  preference,  suitability  of  an  applicant  may  be
questioned  or  put  into  doubt  because  he  or  she  acts  in  such  a  way  as  to  indicate  a
preference for a foreign country over the United States:
involvement  raises  concerns  about  an

judgment,  reliability,  and  trustworthiness  when  it  is  in  conflict  with  U.S.
national interests or when the individual acts to conceal it. By itself; the fact
that a  U.S.  citizen  is also  a  citizen  of  another country  is not  disqualifying
without  an  objective  showing  of  such  conflict  or  attempt  at  concealment.
The  same  is  true  for  a  U.S.  citizen's  exercise  of  any  right  or  privilege  of
foreign  citizenship  and  any  action  to  acquire  or  obtain  recognition  of  a
foreign citizenship. (AG ¶¶ 9, 10, and 11 (setting forth the concern and the
disqualifying and mitigating conditions).)
In  analyzing  the  facts  of  this  case,  I  considered  the  following  potentially
disqualifying and mitigating conditions:
AG ¶ 10(d) participation in foreign activities, including but not limited to:
(1) assuming or attempting to assume any type of employment, position, or
political office in a foreign government or military organization; and
(2)  otherwise  acting  to  serve  the  interests  of  a  foreign  person,  group,
organization,  or  government  in  any  way  that  conflicts  with  U.S.  national
security interests;
AG ¶ 11(a) the foreign citizenship is not in conflict with U.S. national security
interests;
10
AG ¶ 11(b) dual citizenship is based solely on parental citizenship or birth in a
foreign country, and there is no evidence of foreign preference;
AG ¶ 11(c) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce the foreign
citizenship that is in conflict with U.S. national security interests; and
AG ¶ 11 (g) civil employment or military service was authorized under U.S. law, or
the employment or service was otherwise consented to as required by U.S. law.
Applicant admitted that from April 2014 until December 2016 she was employed by
the Saudi Arabian cultural mission in the United States performing administrative tasks.
That  period  of  employment  began  five  years  ago  and  at  a  time  when  Applicant  had
become a naturalized U. S. citizen. Nevertheless, AG ¶ 10(d)(1) is sufficiently broad to
encompass such employment as a potentially disqualifying condition. The next inquiry is
whether any mitigating conditions apply.
Iraq and the United States have been allies since 2003, when we invaded Iraq to
overthrow the Hussein government.  That was the same year that Applicant signed up as
a  linguist  and  cultural  advisor  supporting  U.  S.  and  coalition  forces.  At  that  time,
Applicant’s Iraqi citizenship, based on her parents’ citizenship and being born in Iraq, was
apparently not deemed to be in conflict with U. S. national security interests. Applicant’s
most evident preference, then and now, was to serve American interests. She has stated
her intent to renounce any dual citizenship she may have with a foreign country. Finally,
it is fair to assume that Saudi Arabia’s cultural mission was authorized to employ U. S.
citizens, which Applicant was by 2014. I find that AG ¶¶ 11(a) through (c), and (g) apply.
The  evidence  of  Applicant’s  family  ties  to  Iraq  does  not  raise  doubts  about  her
reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified information. In
reaching  this  conclusion,  I  weighed  the  evidence  as  a  whole  and  considered  if  the
favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also gave due
consideration  to  the  whole-person  concept.  (AG  ¶¶  2(d)(1)-(9)  and  2(f)(1)-(6).)
Accordingly, I conclude that Applicant has met her ultimate burden of persuasion to show
that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to
classified information.
As required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following
formal findings on the SOR allegations:
Paragraph 1, Guideline B:

In light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to
grant Applicant access to classified information.

"Under  Guideline  B,  the  SOR  alleges  that  that  Applicant  served  as  an  officer  in
the British Army from 1980 to 2001 (SOR ¶ 2.a); that he expected to inherit a share of
his mother’s property and assets located in the United Kingdom (UK) (SOR ¶ 2.b); that
he  maintained  contact  with  “many  foreign  nationals”  due  to  his  UK  citizenship  and
service in the British Army (SOR ¶ 2.c); that he has friends and acquaintances who are
serving in the British Military (SOR ¶ 2.d); and that he possessed a security clearance
from the UK Ministry of Defense (SOR ¶ 2.e).
In  Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  admitted  SOR  ¶  2.a,  and  2.e.  He  denied
SOR ¶ 2.b, denied ¶ 2.c in part, and denied ¶ 2.d. His admissions in his answer and at
the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 56-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He was born in the
United Kingdom, graduated from the UK military academy at Sandhurst, and served as
an officer in the British Army and held a UK security clearance from 1980 to 2001, when
he retired as a lieutenant colonel. While in the British Army, he served as an exchange
officer with the US Army from 1997 to 1999. He held a limited DOD security clearance
while serving as an exchange officer. (Tr. 31.) He received two evaluation reports from
US  Army  officers  while  he  was  an  exchange  officer.  His  rater  was  a  US  Army  colonel
and  his  senior  rater  was  a  US  Army  brigadier  general.  Both  reports  gave  him  the
highest possible rating. One report commented, “Every day he turns in an outstanding
performance,”  and  he  “has  made  it  hard  for  anyone  else  to  be  the  best.”  The  other
report  commented  that  he  had  “far  exceeded  all  other  majors  and  the  vast  majority  of
lieutenant colonels.” (AX R.)
Applicant testified that he started thinking about “retirement and the next things in
life” when he completed his exchange tour and returned to the British Army. When a US
defense contractor offered him a job in the United States, he and his family decided to
“completely  move.”  He  submitted  his  application  for  early  retirement  at  some  time
before  March  2001  and  retired  in  August  2001.  Applicant  and  his  wife  sold  their
residence  in  the  United  Kingdom,  and  the  entire  family  came  to  the  United  States  in
August  2001.  Applicant  has  been  employed  continuously  by  federal  contractors  in  the
United States as a senior systems engineer from September 2001 to the present. (GX 2
at 16; AX S.)
Applicant  and  his  family  became  permanent  US  resident  aliens,  applied  for  US
citizenship  as  soon  as  they  were  eligible,  and  became  naturalized  US  citizens.
1  Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  his  security  clearance  application  (GX  1)  unless
otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record.
Applicant,  his  wife,  and  one  son  became  US  citizens  in  October  2013.  His  other  two
sons  became  US  citizens  in  July  and  December  2014.  His  daughter  became  a  US
citizen in June 2014. His daughter lives in the United States and is a recruiting manager
for a major security company. One of his sons lives with his daughter. His oldest son is
an  investment  banker  working  in  the  United  States.  His  youngest  son  also  works  and
lives in the United States. (GX 3 at 9-10; AX P; AX Q; Tr. 49-50.)
Applicant has a UK passport that was issued in January 2010 and will expire in
January 2020. He has not used it for foreign travel since he became a US citizen and
obtained a US passport. (GX 2 at 8-9; GX 3 at 8.)
Applicant  receives  a  pension  from  the  United  Kingdom  for  his  military  service.
When  he  and  his  wife  reach  age  67,  they  will  qualify  for  retirement  pensions  from  the
United Kingdom, similar to US Social Security.
Applicant’s father is deceased. His mother is a citizen and resident of the United
Kingdom. She is in failing health, suffers from dementia, and lives in an assisted living
facility. Applicant and his brothers expected at one time to inherit his mother’s home and
assets, but the home has been sold. His mother’s medical expenses are covered by the
National Health Service in the United Kingdom, but the cost of living in an assisted living
facility  is  not  covered.  (Tr.  61.)  Applicant  anticipates  that  his  mother’s  estate  will  have
some  cash  when  she  passes  away,  and  it  will  be  split  among  Applicant  and  his  two
brothers. (Tr. 41-42.)
Both  of  Applicant’s  brothers  are  citizens  and  residents  of  the  United  Kingdom.
One  is  a  security  officer  employed  by  an  educational  institution.  The  other  is  self-
employed as a used-car salesman. (GX 2 at 35-38; GX 3 at 10.)
Applicant  and  his  wife  purchased  a  plot  of  undeveloped  property  on  a  remote
island in the Bahamas in 2001 for the equivalent of about $8,000. They purchased the
property  as  an  investment.  They  have  never  visited  the  property  and  it  remains
undeveloped. (Tr. 39-40.)
Applicant maintains a bank account with a small balance in the United Kingdom,
which he uses for convenience when he visits and to pay the expenses incurred for his
mother’s care. His British Army pension, which is about $2,000 per month, is deposited
directly into a bank account in the United States. (Tr. 35.) It was previously deposited in
a UK bank, but he changed it to the US bank in January or February 2018 after learning
that  a  foreign  bank  account  might  cause  a  problem  with  his  application  for  a  security
clearance.  (Tr.  52.)  He  contributes  the  maximum  allowable  amount  into  a  401(k)
retirement plan with his current employer. (Tr. 38.)
Applicant and his wife own their home in the United States. The market value of
their home is about $400,000, and they have equity in the home of about $220,000 (Tr.
41; AX K.)
While  Applicant  was  on  active  duty  and  an  exchange  officer  with  the  US  Army,
he  worked  on  a  system  of  computer  networks  for  combat  vehicles.  (Tr.  30.)  After  he
retired  and  was  hired  by  his  current  employer,  he  continued  to  work  on  basically  the
same program, which had been adopted by the US Army. (Tr. 29-30.)
Applicant  testified,  “I  retain  friendship  with  probably  about  ten,  if  that,  people.”2
(Tr. 43.) All have retired, except for one, a lieutenant general who is still on active duty.
Applicant  testified  that  a  few  of  his  retired  colleagues  were  employed  in  the  defense
industry, but he did not know the identity of their employers. He believed that one of his
retired  colleagues  may  be  employed  by  the  military.  (Tr.  57.)  Applicant  and  the
lieutenant general knew each other on active duty and were neighbors when they both
attended a military school, but Applicant has not maintained contact with him. (Tr. 44.)
Applicant’s  relationship  with  the  lieutenant  general  was  a  subject  of  concern  in  the
Appeal Board’s decision.
The  lieutenant  general  was  present  at  joint  US-British  Army  staff  talks  on
interoperability  between  their  military  units  in  February  2017.  During  the  staff  talks,
Applicant made a presentation on behalf of the US Government and his program office.
His  presentation  was  designed  to  convince  the  British  Army  to  buy  and  adopt  the
computer  system  for  combat  vehicles  developed  by  his  employer  and  adopted  by  the
US  Army,  because  it  would  promote  interoperability  between  US  and  British  military
forces.  (Tr.  58.)  After  his  presentation,  he  “bumped  into”  the  lieutenant  general,  not
expecting  him to be there, and they talked  briefly. (Tr. 44-45, 58.) Neither Department
Counsel nor Applicant’s attorney questioned Applicant about the substance of their brief
conversation.3
Applicant  maintains  regular  contact  with  a  retired  British  brigadier,4  who  was  a
classmate  at  Sandhurst.  (Tr.  56.)  They  served  in  the  same  regiment,  and  they  have
contact  about  six  times  a  year.  (GX  2  at  19.)  The  record  does  not  reflect  whether  the
brigadier is currently employed or has any connection, other than his retired status, with
the UK Government.
Applicant has quarterly contact with another retired British officer with whom he
served. (GX 2 at 42.) This officer lives in India and is self-employed. (GX 4 at 3.)
2 In Applicant’s submission on remand, he argues that his contacts from his former service in the British
Army  are  “acquaintances”  rather  than  “friends.”  Some  of  the  information  in  Applicant’s  submission  is
testimonial, providing additional descriptions of the nature of his contacts with present and former British
officers. Since neither party requested that the record be opened for additional testimony, I have treated
Applicant’s submission as argument based on the testimony reflected in the hearing transcript and not as
additional testimony.
3  In  Applicant’s  submission  on  remand,  he  proffered  testimony  that  his  conversation  with  the  lieutenant
general  was  limited  to  niceties  and  questions  about  family.  I  have  not  considered  his  proffer,  because
neither side requested that the record be reopened for additional testimony.
4  The  Appeal  Board  decision  refers  to  this  officer’s  rank  as  “brigadier  general.”  The  officer’s  rank  is
brigadier, which is the British rank equivalent to a US brigadier general.
Applicant has quarterly contact with another retired British officer, with whom he
attended  high  school  and  with  whom  he  served  in  the  same  regiment.  Applicant  is
godfather  to  this  retired  officer’s  son.  This  retired  officer  is  not  currently  employed  or
affiliated with the UK Government. (GX 2 at 40-41; GX 4 at 3; AX T at 32.)
Applicant also maintains occasional contact with a retired British Army officer in
Nepal, who was his second in command of a squadron in a British Gurkha brigade and
his son’s godfather. They have “occasional, yearly” email contact and see each other on
Facebook. (Tr. 54-55.) This officer has no current connection with the UK Government.
Applicant’s facility security officer (FSO) is also a part owner and vice-president
of the company by whom Applicant is employed. He has worked closely with Applicant
and has socialized with his family. He testified that Applicant has ties to his past military
service  and  is  proud  of  it,  but  he  is  also  very  proud  of  being  a  US  citizen.  The  FSO
strongly supports Applicant’s application for a security clearance. (Tr. 18-22.)
A  retired  US  Army  colonel  who  worked  with  Applicant  from  2001  to  2017
considers him a lifelong friend. He admires Applicant for his commitment to the success
of the US military. He considers Applicant to be honest, dependable, and sincere in his
devotion to the United States. (AX H.)
Applicant’s  performance  evaluation  for  the  period  ending  in  January  2018  rated
him  as  exceeding  expectations.  He  was  commended  for  defining  and  developing
systems-engineering  processes  and  his  “dogged  determination  to  do  the  right  thing,”
whether it was for a customer, the company, or another employee. (AX G.)

incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  35  years  old.  He  was  born  in  Iraq  in  1983.  He  lived  there  until  he
immigrated to the United States in 2008. He became a U.S. citizen in 2013. In 2006, he

sector,  but  is  pursuing  a  linguist  position  with  a  federal  contractor,  for  which  he  is
seeking a security clearance. He has never been married and has no children.3
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant’s  mother,  four  brothers  and  his  sister  are  all
residents  and  citizens  of  Afghanistan.  It  further  alleged  that  one  brother  works  for  the
Iraqi  National  Police.  The  SOR  also  alleged  that  Applicant  has  one  friend,  who  is  a
resident and citizen of Iraq, and who is also currently enlisted in the Iraqi Army; and a
second  friend,  a  resident  and  citizen  of  Iraq,  who  is  employed  by  the  Iraqi
Counterterrorism  unit.  The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  admitted  his  allegiance  to  the
United States and Iraq was divided to about 50 percent to each country.

Applicant was hired locally as a linguist from 2004 to 2008 for U.S. forces in Iraq.
He  provided  linguist  services  at  several  different  locations  and  for  several  different
missions.  In  approximately  2005,  he  began  working  at  a  police  academy  providing
linguistic  services  to  U.S.  forces  who  were  training  Iraqi  police  candidates.  He  later
transitioned  to  missions  that  had  him  working  “outside  the  wire”  providing  linguistic
services to U.S. forces at roadside checkpoints and providing liaison services between
U.S. forces and local leaders. His work was hazardous. He experienced frequent rocket
propelled  grenade  (RPG)  attacks  from  insurgent  forces.  In  approximately  2007,  he
began  providing  linguistic  services  at  an  Iraqi  detention  facility.  At  this  facility,  where
approximately  20,000  Arabic-speaking  detainees  were  held,  Applicant  translated
sensitive  written  and  oral  documents  for  U.S.  forces.  He  was  awarded  a  certificate  of
appreciation  from  a  U.S.  Army  Military  Police  Battalion  for  his  work  at  the  detention
facility.4
The current status of Applicant’s relatives listed in the SOR is as follows:
1. Applicant’s mother (M). M is 68 years old and in poor health. She immigrated
to  the  United  States  in  2015.  She  is  a  legal  resident  alien  in  this  country  (green  card
holder). She lives with Applicant who provides for her. She is currently visiting Iraq. She
returned  to  Iraq  in  May  2018  to  visit  her  husband’s  gravesite  (he  passed  away  in
January 2018). She intended to stay approximately 15 days. She experienced bleeding
while there and was diagnosed with cancer. Currently, she is undergoing chemotherapy
and unable to travel. She is staying in the house her husband owned presently occupied
by  her  sons  and  daughter.  She  intends  to  return  to  the  United  States  when  she  is
healthy enough to do so. She has no affiliations with the Iraqi government or military.5
2. Applicant’s four brothers and sister (B1-B4, S1). B1 immigrated to this country
in 2015 with his mother. He is a legal resident alien (green card holder). He lives with
Applicant and their mother. He works for a private sector employer. He took his mother
to  Iraq  in  May  2018,  but  returned  alone  after  15  days  when  she  experienced  medical
issues. B2 is a resident and citizen of Iraq. He works for the Iraqi National Police as a
corrections  officer.  Applicant  has  infrequent  contact  with  him,  possibly  on  a  quarterly
basis through social media. B3 is a resident and citizen of Iraq. He is unemployed. He
has  no  government  or  military  affiliation.  Applicant  has  contact  with  him  approximately
twice  a  year.  B4  is  a  resident  and  citizen  of  Iraq.  He  works  in  customer  service  for  a
telecommunication  company.  He  has  no  government  or  military  affiliations.  Applicant
has  quarterly  contact  with  him.  S1  is  a  resident  and  citizen  of  Iraq.  She  is  a  school
teacher. Applicant has quarterly contact with her. All of Applicant’s siblings were aware
of his linguist work for U.S. forces from 2004 to 2008. There were no repercussions as a
result.6

3. Applicant’s two friends (F1 and F2). Both F1 and F2 are residents and citizens
of Iraq. Applicant met them when he was attending college. Applicant’s last contact with
F1 was in 2016. Applicant knew that F1 was in the Iraqi Army at one time, but now he
has  no  idea  as  to  F1’s  status.  Applicant’s  last  contact  with  F2  was  in  April  2017.  He
knew  that  F2  was  working  for  an  Iraqi  counterterrorism  unit.  At present,  Applicant  has
no idea what F2 does for a living.7
Applicant  addressed  his  apparent  statement  to  a  defense  investigator  in  June
2017 during his background interview. The investigator noted in his report that Applicant
stated  that  his  allegiance  to  the  two  countries  was  50  percent  each.  In  March  2018,
when  given  a  chance  to  review  the  investigator’s  summarized  interview,  Applicant
explained that he meant that he still appreciated the culture, history, and the arts of Iraq,
however, he has no allegiance to the government of Iraq. His undivided allegiance is to
the United States as demonstrated by his willingness to put himself in harm’s way while
working with U.S. forces in Iraq. During his testimony, he reiterated his allegiance to the
United  States,  while  also  explaining  that  he  will  always  love  the  history  and  culture  of
Iraq. He documented that his Iraqi passport expired in 2016 and has not been renewed.
He has a current U.S. passport that was issued in 2017.8

The  U.S.  State  Department  warns  U.S.  citizens  against  travel  to  Iraq  as  travel
within the country remains dangerous. The U.S. Embassy warns that U.S. citizens are at
high  risk  for  kidnapping  and  violence  and  to  avoid  all  but  essential  travel  to  Iraq.  The
U.S. government considers the potential threat to U.S. government personnel in Iraq to
be serious enough to require them to live and work under strict security guidelines. The

"Based upon Applicant’s admissions in her SOR Response and a careful review of
her testimony and that of her character witnesses, the documentary evidence admitted
into the record, the extensive, additional information provided by Applicant in her SOR
Response, and the parties’ administrative notice requests, I make the following findings
of fact.
1 Applicant’s personal information is extracted from her security clearance application, dated January 19,
2016, (GE 1), unless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record.
Applicant  is  a  60-year-old  software  engineer,  who  is  now  specialized  as  a  web
developer. She has worked and studied in the information technology and related fields
for most of her adult life. From 1997 until January 2015, she lived and worked in Israel.
In  1997,  she  obtained  employment  in  Israel  as  a  software  engineer  for  a  German
company.  She  then  worked  as  an  analyst  for  an  Israeli  contractor  of  an  international
technology  company.  From  June  2007  until  January  2015,  she  worked  as  a  technical
writer  for  an  Israeli-based  technology  company.  In  January  2015,  she  relocated  from
Israel to the United States and was unemployed for about a year. In January 2016, she
began  working  for  her  security  clearance  sponsor. While unemployed  and  living  in  the
United  States,  she  sought  employment,  and  for  a  period,  she  was  a  full-time  student
taking classes in computer coding. (GE 2 at 3-4; SOR Response 3-4; AE B at 1; Tr. 15-
17 and 34.)
Applicant  was  born  and  educated  in  the  United  States.  In  1980,  she  earned  a
bachelor’s of science degree in computer science-mathematics. She has never married
and  has  no  children.  Her  mother,  father,  stepmother,  sister,  brother-in-law,  and  their
children are U.S. citizens and residents. (Tr. 44.)
In  1997,  Applicant  acquired  Israeli  citizenship  under  the  Israeli  Aliyah  program
based upon her Jewish heritage and her desire to live and work in Israel. She chose to
do this because she wanted to experience her Jewish heritage. She was about 39 years
old  at  the  time.  In  her  SOR  Response,  she  wrote  that  “it  would  have  been  incredibly
difficult, probably impossible, to work for [the German company] in Israel without acquiring
citizenship.” She testified at the hearing that she understood that it would be “very difficult
to obtain a work visa”  in Israel. She provided no collaborating evidence to support her
vague claim that becoming an Israeli citizen was “probably” a prerequisite to being able
to live and work in Israel. She noted in her SOR Response that she carefully confirmed
that by becoming an Israeli citizen, she would not adversely affect her status as a U.S.
citizen. She is presently a dual U.S. and Israeli citizen. She acquired an Israeli passport
in 1998, which she renewed in 2010. Her passport expires in 2020. In connection with her
application  for  a  security  clearance,  she  surrendered  this  passport  to  her  sponsor’s
Facility  Security  Officer  (FSO),  but  when  federal  personnel  security  policy  regarding
foreign passports was revised, the FSO returned Applicant’s passport to her. Applicant
has no intention to renew the passport when it expires.2 (GE 2 at 2-3; SOR Response 3,
6, and 8; Tr. 21-22, 31, 35, and 41.)
During  the  period  1989  to  1997,  Applicant  lived  and  worked  in  Germany  for  an
international technology company. She was permitted to work there without becoming a
German citizen. At the hearing, she speculated that she might have had a German work
visa,  though  she  could  not  recall.  She  was  about  31  years  old  when  she  moved  to
2 Applicant has not returned to Israel since January 2015, but if she does, she must enter and exit Israel
using her Israeli passport. Applicant’s FSO testified that Applicant had no need for her passport because
she  did  not  intend  to  return  to  Israel,  at  least  as  of  the  time  she  surrendered  her  passport  to  the  FSO.
Applicant testified that she has no “concrete plans” to visit Israel, but she is open to doing so in the future.
She  may  have  to  return  to  Israel  in  2021,  however,  after  she  turns  62  to  close  her  pension  and  bank
accounts there, which are detailed below. (GAN I at 4; Tr. 22-23 and 58-59.)
Germany for that employment. She worked for the same company in the United States
for  about  two  or  three  years  before  she  transferred  to  Germany.  Prior  to  relocating  to
Israel  in  1997,  she  applied for and  obtained  an  Israeli  visa  and  then  Israeli  citizenship
under  the  Aliyah  program.  She  obtained  employment  with  the  Israeli  subsidiary  of  the
German company a number of months later. (GE 2 at 5; SOR Response 3; AE A; Tr. 36,
43, and 45-49.)
While  working  in  Israel,  Applicant  and  her  employer  contributed  to  a  retirement
account,  which  presently  has  a  value  of  U.S.  $109,000.  Prior  to  moving  to  Israel,  she
accumulated assets and retirement accounts held by U.S. financial institutions that are
today worth more than $533,000. She also has assets in Germany worth about $6,000-
$7,000 that she acquired while working there.  She does not have any significant, non-
financial assets in the United States, however, such as a residence. (Tr. 37-41 and 45-
46.)
Applicant’s Israeli pension account is similar to a U.S. company-sponsored 401K
or retirement savings account. Her ability to establish and save these retirement funds
are a benefit she received from her Israeli citizenship.3 She has chosen to leave the Israeli
retirement assets in Israel because she would incur an Israeli tax penalty of 35 percent if
she  withdrew  the funds  before  she  was  62  years old.  She also has  a  bank account  in
Israel with a balance of about U.S. $16,000. She maintains this account as a requirement
to receive the Israeli pension funds when she turns 62 in about two years.4 At that time,
she  intends  to  close  both  accounts  and  transfer  the  funds  to  the  United  States.  She
believes  it  would  be  financially  irresponsible  to  remove  the  retirement  funds  from  the
Israeli account at this time because of the tax penalty. She also believes that her Israeli
assets could never be used for coercion or exploitation purposes. Although Applicant has
stated that she is willing to renounce her Israeli citizenship, she told her FSO that she
needed to maintain her Israeli citizenship to be eligible to receive her retirement assets in
Israel. Applicant confirmed this by testifying that she would only be willing to renounce
her Israeli citizenship if she were required to do so to obtain a U.S. security clearance
and if she could do so after she closed her pension and bank accounts. She also testified
that  if  she  renounced  her  Israeli  citizenship,  she  would  lose  her  Israeli  identification
number,  which  is  needed  to  access  her  Israeli  pension  and  bank  accounts.5  (SOR
Response 6 and 8; Tr. 22-23, 27, 37-41, and 58-60.)
Since returning to the United States after living abroad for most of her adult life, 17
years of which were in Israel, Applicant moved to a location far from where her parents
and sister reside. She moved there to take classes in computer coding. She visits her
3 The SOR does not contain any allegations regarding Applicant’s exercise of the rights and benefits she
received as an Israeli citizen.
4 Applicant also testified that she left funds in that account for her future use if she returns to visit Israel. (Tr.
58-59.)
5 Applicant also testified that if she  were to renounce  her Israeli citizenship, she  could  probably reapply
under the Aliyah program and obtain Israeli citizenship again. (Tr. 51-52.)
family  members  once  or  twice  a  year.  Applicant  has  become  involved  in  a  local  folk-
dancing  community.  She  teaches  and  participates  in  several  different  kinds  of  dance
classes and clubs and socializes with the other participants. The record evidence contains
a large number of highly favorable reference letters. In addition, her sponsor’s FSO and
her  supervisor  provided  favorable  testimony  at  the  hearing  regarding  Applicant’s  work
ethic, character, trustworthiness, and loyalty and connections to her country of birth, the
United States. (SOR Response 4 and 9; Tr. 52.)
Israel
Israel  is  a  parliamentary  democracy  with  a  unicameral  parliament  called  the
Knesset and a prime minister, who exercises extensive executive power. Members of the
Knesset, including the prime minister, are elected in free and fair elections. The United
States  recognized  Israel  as  an  independent  state  on  May  14,  1948,  and  established
diplomatic relations with Israel the following year. The United States and Israel have had
strong bilateral relations since that period. The United States extends substantial foreign
aid to Israel and provides significant military support as well. The United States is also
Israel’s largest trading partner. Israel cooperates closely with the United States and other
countries on counterterrorism issues. (AAN I at 2-7; GAN I at 2.)
Despite its close relationship with the United States, Israeli has been involved in
numerous instances of illegal export, or attempted illegal export, of U.S. restricted and
classified  technology  and  products,  including  dual-use  technology.  The  illegally
transferred technology and products obtained for Israel’s benefit includes spy software,
encryption  software,  parts  for  fighter  jets,  components  of  U.S.  HAWK  surface-to-air
missiles and F-4 Phantom fighter jets, and digital oscilloscopes capable of being used in
the development of weapons of mass destruction and missile delivery. (GAN I at 2-3.)
Israel generally respects the rights of its citizens. When human-rights violations
have  occurred,  they  have  involved  Palestinian  detainees  or  Arab-Israelis.  Terrorist
suicide bombings are a continuing threat in Israel, and U.S. citizens in Israel are advised
to be cautious. (GAN I at 3-5.)
Israel considers U.S. citizens, who also hold Israeli citizenship or have a claim to
dual  nationality,  to  be  Israeli  citizens  for  immigration  and  other  legal  purposes.  Dual
U.S.-Israeli citizens must enter and depart Israel using Israeli passports. U.S. citizens
visiting Israel have been subjected to prolonged questioning and thorough searches by
Israeli authorities upon entry or departure. (GAN I at 4-5.)

U.S.  Army  reserve  with  17  years  of  active  duty.  He  hired  Applicant  and  directly
supervised him on the job as a federal contractor. (Tr. 38-40) He testified that Kurds are
commonly persecuted in Turkey, and they are in disfavor. He testified that Applicant is
honest,  reliable,  and  loyal  to  the  U.S.  He  would  have  no  hesitation  recommending
Applicant for a security clearance.
Applicant testified that his Turkish passport expired in 2014 and he affirmatively
renounced his Turkish citizenship in 2018 through the Turkish Embassy in the U.S. (Tr.
34,  54,  61)  He  currently  works  for  one  federal  contractor,  but  he  is  sponsored  for  a

Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on October 7, 2016.2
In  section  19  (Foreign  Contacts)  of  his  SCA,  he  disclosed  his  foreign  family  members
living in Turkey. In section 20B (Foreign Activities) he disclosed that he was involved as
president of the People’s Democratic Union (“HDP”) political party from January 2016 to
July  2016.  He  explained  that  it  was  the  third  largest  political  party  in  Turkey.  He
accepted  the  unpaid  position  to  bolster  his  resume  with  volunteer  experience.3  He

operate  this  organization  because  that  individual  needed  Applicant’s  social  security
number  to  set  up  the  non-profit  organization.  (Tr.  99)  His  duties  were  primarily
administrative. The stated goals of this non-profit organization were to promote human
rights  and  it  was  generally  opposed  to  the  Turkish  government.  (Tr.  100)  Applicant

Turkish embassy  in  the  U.S.  in  2015  after  he  became  a  U.S.  citizen.  (Tr.  123) He  still
maintained  his  Turkish  citizenship  at  that  point.  Essentially,  he  voted  because  he
disagreed with the incumbent Turkish government’s human-rights abuses and policies.

"Applicant  is  a  55-year-old  employee  who  is  seeking  to  obtain  a  security
clearance  in  conjunction  with  her  job  as  a  proposal  manager  for  a  company  doing
business in the defense industry. She is a dual citizen of the United States and Israel,
and  she  holds  passports  from  each  country.  She  was  born  in  the  United  States  and
moved  to  Israel  as  a  minor  child  with  her  parents.  She  acquired  Israel  citizenship  in
1975, at about the age of 8. She then  lived in Israel until 2014, when she came to the
United States.
Applicant  performed  military  service  in  the  Israeli  Defense  Forces  (IDF)  during
1985-1989.  She  was  trained  in  and  worked  in  the  field  of  military  intelligence.  She
attained the rank of staff sergeant. She then earned a bachelor’s degree from an Israeli
university  in  1992.  Her  employment  history  in  Israel  includes  working  for  software
companies between 1992 and 2011, as a programmer, team leader, and only later as a
product  manager,  starting  around  2008.  (Answer  to  SOR)  She  voted  in  an  Israeli
election in 2013, but has voted only in U.S. elections thereafter.
Applicant  married  for  the  first  time  in  1993  and  divorced  in  2001.  Her  first
husband  was  also  a  dual  citizen  of  the  United  States  and  Israel.  She  married  for  the
second time in 2001. They married at a location in the United States. Her husband is a
citizen of the United States, Israel, and Germany. She has three adult children and an
adult stepchild.
Applicant  and  her  husband  have  resided  together  in  the  United  States  since
2014. She described her husband as an eminent scientist who is employed by the U.S.
Government  and  a  holder  of  a  public  trust  clearance  (which  is  typically  for  a  non-
national security position). She stated that her U.S. citizenship is important to her, and
she  took  pains  to  have  her  three  children  obtain  U.S.  citizenship  through  the
naturalization process. She has sponsored her stepdaughter to obtain a green card, as
her stepdaughter intends to come to the United States and live here upon completion of
her studies in Israel. Her two sons are living with her and her husband. Her third child, a
26-year-old daughter, has chosen to reside in Israel.
Applicant  has  a  number  of  family  ties  or  connections  to  Israel.  (Exhibit  4,
Appendix A) Her daughter, sister, and brother are dual citizens of the United States and
Israel, and they reside in Israel. Her stepdaughter and sister-in-law are citizens of and
residents  in  Israel.  Her  brother-in-law  is  a  dual  citizen  of  Germany  and  Israel,  and  he
resides  in  Israel.  In  the  past  she  maintained  contact  with  a  person  with  whom  she
served with in the IDF, but she is no longer in contact with him.
Several  of  Applicant’s  family  members  have  served  in  the  IDF.  (Exhibit  4,
Appendix A) Her spouse served as an officer and aerial navigator. Her sister served as
an  intelligence  officer.  Her  brother  served  as  a  target  instructor.  Her  son  served  in
logistics. Her daughter served in operations. And her stepdaughter served as a military
reporter.
Applicant, individually or jointly with her husband, has financial interests in Israel.
(Exhibit  4,  Appendix  B)  She  noted  that  she  and  her  husband  sold  all  of  their  Israeli
securities  and  mutual  funds,  as  she  understood  doing  so  was  required  by  U.S.  law.
They  also  sold  their  former  residence  in  Israel  in  2016,  and  they  no  longer  own  real
estate in Israel. She described their current financial accounts in Israel as consisting of
a  checking  account,  two  educational  funds,  a  life  insurance  policy,  a  life  insurance
pension  fund,  and  two  provident  funds  (which  I  understand  are  long-term  savings  to
support  an  employee  upon  retirement).  She  estimated  the  U.S.  dollar  value  of  these
financial  holdings  at  about  $1  million  in  total.  Concerning  foreign-based  income,  her
husband  receives  a  pension  from  an  Israeli  university  in  the  amount  of  about  U.S.
$8,600 monthly.
In  addition  to  their  Israeli  financial  interests,  Applicant  noted  that  she  and  her
husband  own  their  U.S.  home,  which  has  an  estimated  market  value  of  more  than  $1
million. She also noted that they have more than $1.5 million in  U.S. mutual funds and
accounts. Their current net worth is approximately $3 million. (Exhibit 4 at 9)
Applicant  travels  frequently  to  Israel.  For  example,  she  made  ten  trips  to  Israel
during  November  2014  and  November  2019.  (Exhibit  4,  Appendix  C)  She  uses  her
Israeli passport to enter and depart Israel, as required by Israeli law. Likewise, she uses
her U.S. passport to enter and depart the United States, as required by U.S. law.
I have taken administrative notice of the following facts concerning the country of
Israel. (Exhibit 6) Israel is a nation in the Middle East, and it is governed by a multiparty
parliamentary  democracy. Israel  and  the  United  States have  historically  strong  bilateral
relations  and ties, including cooperation  on defense  and security  matters. With  that said,
U.S.  officials  remain   concerned   about  the   potential  for  Israeli   espionage.  The   most
notable example  is perhaps the  case  of Jonathan  Pollard,  a  former intelligence  analyst
for  the   U.S.  Government.   He  pleaded   guilty   in  1987,  as  part  of   a   plea   agreement,   to
spying   for  and   providing   top-secret   classified   information   to   Israel,  for  which  he   was
sentenced  to  life  in prison. The  current State  Department travel advisory  for Israel is do
not travel there due  to  COVID-19, and  the  advisory  warns to  exercise  increased  caution
in Israel due  to terrorism and civil unrest.
Law and Policies
This  case  is  adjudicated  under  Executive  Order  (E.O.)  10865,  Safeguarding
Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of
Defense  Directive  5220.6,  Defense  Industrial  Personnel  Security  Clearance  Review
Program  (January  2,  1992),  as  amended  (Directive);  and  the  National  Security
Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or
Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017.
It  is  well-established  law  that  no  one  has  a  right  to  a  security  clearance.1  As
noted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, “the clearly consistent
standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the
side  of  denials.”2  Under  Egan,  Executive  Order  10865,  and  the  Directive,  any  doubt
about  whether  an  applicant  should  be  allowed  access  to  classified  information  will  be
resolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that
the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3
The   DOHA  Appeal  Board  has  followed   the   Court’s  reasoning,  and   a   judge’s
findings  of   fact  are  reviewed   under  the   substantial-evidence   standard.4  Substantial
evidence  means “evidence  that  a  reasonable  mind  could accept as adequate  to  support
a conclusion; evidence beyond a scintilla.”5 Substantial evidence is a lesser burden than
both  clear  and  convincing  evidence  and  preponderance  of  the  evidence,  the  latter  of
which  is  the  standard  applied  in  most  civil  trials.  It  is  also  a  far  lesser  burden  than
evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, the norm for criminal trials.

‘right’ to a security clearance”); Duane v. Department  of Defense, 275 F.3d  988,  994 (10th  Cir. 2002)  (no

5 Black’s  Law Dictionary  640 (Bryan A. Garner  ed., 9th  ed.,  West 2009).
There is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for
access  to  classified  information.6  Under  the  Directive,  the  parties  have  the  following
burdens:  (1)  Department  Counsel  has  the  burden  of  presenting  evidence  to  establish
facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for
presenting  evidence  to  refute,  explain,  extenuate,  or  mitigate  facts  that  have  been
admitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain
a favorable clearance decision.7
Discussion
Concerning  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶  2,  the  issue  under  Guideline  B  for foreign
influence is whether Applicant’s ties and connections to Israel should disqualify her from
eligibility  for  access  to  classified  information.  Under  Guideline  B  for  foreign  influence,
the  suitability  of  an  applicant  may  be  questioned  or  put  into  doubt  due  to  foreign
contacts and interests. The overall concern is set forth in AG ¶ 6 as follows:
Foreign  contacts  and  interests,  including  but  not  limited  to  business,
financial,  and  property  interests,  are  a  national  security  concern  if  they
result in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern
if they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or
induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a
way  inconsistent  with  U.S.  interests  or  otherwise  made  vulnerable  to
pressure  or  coercion  by  any  foreign  interest.  Assessment  of  foreign
contacts  and  interests  should  consider  the  country  in  which  the  foreign
contact  or  interest  is  located,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  considerations
such  as  whether it  is known  to  target  U.S. citizens  to  obtain  classified  or
sensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism.
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise a security concern under
AG ¶ 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case:
AG  ¶   7(a)  contact,  regardless  of  method,  with  a  foreign  family  member,
business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen
of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk
of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;
AG ¶  7(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country
that  create  a  potential  conflict  of  interest  between  the  individual's
obligation  to  protect  classified  or  sensitive  information  or  technology  and
the  individual's  desire  to  help  a  foreign  person,  group,  or  country  by
providing that information or technology; and
6 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).
7 Directive, Enclosure 3, ¶¶ E3.1.14 and E3.1.15.
AG ¶  7(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign
country,  or  in  any  foreign-owned  or  foreign-operated  business  that  could
subject  the  individual  to  a  heightened  risk  of  foreign  influence  or
exploitation or personal conflict of interest.
The  starting  point  for  the  analysis  is  the  country  of  Israel.  The  heightened-risk
element  is  satisfied  given  the  risk  of  terrorism  in  Israel  as  well  as  concerns  about  the
potential  for  Israeli  espionage  against  the  United  States.  Israel  stands  in  contrast  to
countries that pose a low national security risk; for example, Canada, United Kingdom,
Australia,  and  New  Zealand,  all  of  which  belong  to  (with  the  United  States)  the  Five
Eyes intelligence alliance for joint cooperation in signals intelligence. Given  Applicant’s
family  ties  to  Israel  and  financial  interests  in  Israel,  the  above  disqualifying  conditions
are raised by substantial evidence.
The guideline provides that certain facts and circumstances may mitigate foreign
influence  concerns.  Given  the  evidence  here,  I  considered  the  following  mitigating
conditions:
AG ¶  8(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country
in  which  these persons  are located, or the positions or activities  of  those
persons  in  that  country  are  such  that  it  is  unlikely  the  individual  will  be
placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign
individual,  group,  organization,  or  government  and  the  interests  of  the
United States;
AG  ¶   8(b)  there   is  no   conflict  of   interest,  either  because   the   individual’s
sense   of   loyalty   or  obligation   to   the   foreign   person,   or  allegiance   to   the
group,  government,   or   country   is  so   minimal,  or  the   individual  has   such
deep   and   longstanding   relationships   and   loyalties  in  the   United   States,
that   the   individual  can   be   expected   to   resolve   any   conflict   of  interest   in
favor of the U.S. interest; and
AG ¶  8(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or
property interests  is such  that  they  are  unlikely to  result  in  a  conflict  and
could  not  be  used  effectively  to  influence,  manipulate,  or  pressure  the
individual.
Israel  presents  a  heightened  risk  and  places  a  heavy  burden  on  Applicant  to
mitigate  the  security  concern.  With  that  said,  Applicant  has  various  indicators  of  a
mature, stable, responsible, and trustworthy person. She has an employment history in
both Israel and the United States. She and her husband are both financially responsible
and successful. They have been homeowners, past and present. She appears to have
cooperated fully and provided truthful information during the security clearance process.
Her  responses  in  her  SF  86  and  her  responses  to  written  interrogatories  were
meticulous and professional.
I  have   considered   the   totality   of   Applicant’s  ties  and   connections  to   Israel.  She
was  born  in  the   United   States  and  departed   the   country   as  a   minor  child   with   her
parents. The  majority  of  her upbringing, her education, and  her adult life  were in Israel,
where she  lived  for about 40  years. She  has  lived   in the  United  States as an  adult for
less  than   ten   years. Understandably,  she   maintains ongoing   relationships  with   various
family   members   in  Israel,  including   an   adult   daughter  and   an   adult  stepdaughter.  She
travels frequently   to   Israel for vacation  as  well   as  to  maintain those   relationships.   She
along  with  her husband  have  substantial financial  interests in Israel, estimated  at about
U.S. $1  million. Their Israeli  financial interests are less than their  U.S. financial interests,
but they  are not minor or trivial  to  say  the  least.  On  balance, I cannot conclude  that her
ties and  connections  to  the  United  States are far stronger than  her  ties  and  connections
to  Israel. My  overall  assessment is  that they  are about the  same, with  Applicant having
one  foot in the United  States and  one  foot in the country of  her foreign citizenship.
Given the totality of facts and circumstances, I cannot conclude that it is unlikely
Applicant  will be  placed  in a  position of  having to  choose  between the interests of  the
United  States  and  the  interests  of  the  Israeli  government  or  her  family  members  who
have  Israeli  citizenship,  reside  in  Israel,  or  both.  I  also  cannot  conclude  there  is  no
conflict of interest within the meaning of AG ¶ 8(b). The substantial financial interests in
Israel  are  also  worrisome.  The  three  mitigating  conditions  noted  above,  in  light  of  the
evidence as a whole, do not apply to mitigate the foreign influence security concern.
Concerning   the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶  1,  the   issue   under Guideline  C for foreign
preference   is  whether   Applicant’s  actions  are  such   as  to   indicate   a   preference   for  a
foreign  country  over the  United  States.  Note,  Department  Counsel did not  address  the
foreign   preference   matters  in   the   argument  section   of  his   written   brief.   The   overall
concern is set forth in  AG ¶  9 as follows:
When   an   individual  acts  in   such   a   way   as  to   indicate   a   preference   for  a
foreign country over the United States, then  [they] may provide information
or  make   decisions  that  are  harmful  to   the   interests  of   the   United   States.
Foreign   involvement  raises  concerns   about  an   individual’s  judgment,
reliability,  and   trustworthiness  when   it  is  in  conflict  with   U.S.  national
interests or when  the  individual acts to  conceal it. By itself;  the  fact that a
U.S. citizen  is also a  citizen  of  another country is not disqualifying  without
an   objective   showing   of   such   conflict  or  attempt   at  concealment.   The
same  is true  for a  U.S.  citizen’s exercise  of any  right or privilege  of foreign
citizenship  and   any   action   to   acquire   or obtained   recognition  of   a  foreign
citizenship.
The guideline notes several conditions that could raise a security concern under
AG ¶ 10. The following are potentially applicable in this case:
AG ¶  10(a) applying for and/or acquiring citizenship in any other country;
and
AG ¶  10(d) participation in foreign activities, including but not limited to: (1)
assuming  or  attempting  to  assume  any  type  of  employment,  position,  or
political  office  in  a  foreign  government  or  military  organization;  and  (2)
otherwise  acting  to  serve  the  interests  of  a  foreign  person,  group,
organization,  or  government  in  any  way  that  conflicts  with  U.S.  national
security interests.
Of the four allegations made in SOR ¶ 1, only Applicant’s military service in the
IDF raises a concern. It falls squarely within the meaning of the disqualifying condition
at AG ¶ 10(d)(1). The remaining three SOR allegations are addressed below.
First, while it’s undisputed that Applicant acquired Israeli citizen as a native-born
citizen,  she  did  so  when  she  was  a  minor child  under the  control and  influence  of  her
parents.  It  was  a  matter  wholly  beyond  her  control.  Given  these  circumstances,  her
acquisition of Israeli citizenship cannot reasonably qualify as an intentional, deliberate,
or purposeful act on her part; she was a passive participate in the process. Accordingly,
the disqualifying condition at AG ¶ 10(a) does not apply here.
Second, Applicant’s employment history in Israel working for software companies
between  1992  and  2011,  as  a  programmer,  team  leader,  and  only  later  as  a  product
manager,  starting  around  2008,  does  not  raise  a  concern.  It  does  not  fall  within  the
meaning of AG ¶ 10(d)(1), because it was not employment with or a position in a foreign
government or military organization.
Third,  Applicant’s  voting  in  an  Israeli  election  in  about  January  2013  does  not
raise  a  concern.  Voting  in  a  foreign  election  does  not  fall  within  the  meaning  of  AG  ¶
10(d).  Note,  the  previous  August  2006  version  of  Guideline  C  specifically  included
voting in a foreign election as a disqualifying condition. But voting in a foreign election
was not included in the list of disqualifying conditions when the most recent version of
Guideline C was issued in December 2016.
The guideline provides that certain facts and circumstances may mitigate foreign
preference  concerns.  Given  the  evidence  here,  I  considered  the  following  mitigating
conditions:
AG  ¶   11(d) the exercise  of  the  rights, privileges,  or obligations or foreign
citizenship occurred before the individual because a U.S. citizen; and
AG ¶  11(g) civil employment or military service was authorized under U.S.
law, or the employment or service was otherwise consented to as required
by U.S. law.
The mitigating condition at AG  ¶  11(d)  does  not  apply  because  Applicant’s
military service in the IDF, a mandatory obligation in Israel, occurred while she was an
adult dual citizen of the United States and Israel. Likewise, there is no evidence  in the
written record to support application of AG ¶ 11(g). I also note that Applicant served in
the  IDF  for  four  years,  and  she  was  trained  and  worked  in  the  field  of  military
intelligence. She also has several family members, including her husband, her son, her
daughter, and her stepdaughter who have served in the IDF, which is probably common
for  Israeli  families  given  the  mandatory  obligation  to  perform  military  service.  Her
military  service  occurred  more  than  30  years  ago  during  1985-1989,  when  she  was  a
young  adult,  and  there  has  been  substantial  passage  of  time.  Still,  when  viewing  her
military service not in isolation but as part of the whole of this case, I cannot conclude
that Applicant has met her burden of proof to establish mitigation.
One  final  matter.  Applicant  has  argued  that  none  of  the  reasons  in  the  SOR
indicate  anything  beyond  expected  behavior  and  circumstances  of  any  person
immigrating to the United States from another country, and that she has no reason for
disloyalty to the country of her birth. (Answer to SOR) As to the first point, which is a fair
point to make, that does not mean the U.S. Government may not consider the expected
behavior  and  circumstances  of  such  a  person  when  deciding  whether  to  grant  such  a
person the privilege of a security clearance. As to the second point, it is a long-standing
rule that security clearance decisions are not a loyalty determination or test. Section 7 of
the  1960  Eisenhower  Executive  Order  (E.O.  10865)  provides  that  an  unfavorable
clearance  decision  “shall  be  a  determination  in  the  terms  of  the  national  interest  and
shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.”
Following Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns
about  Applicant’s  reliability,  trustworthiness,  good  judgment,  and  ability  to  protect
classified  or  sensitive  information.  In  reaching  this  conclusion,  I  weighed  the  evidence
as  a  whole  and  considered  if  the  favorable  evidence  outweighed  the  unfavorable
evidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that she
has not met her ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with
the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information.
The formal findings on the SOR allegations are:
Paragraph  1, Guideline  C:
Against Applicant
Subparagraph  1.a:
Subparagraph  1.b:
Subparagraph  1.c:
Subparagraph  1.d:

access to classified information. National security eligibility is denied.

"Applicant is 37 years old. He has been married to his wife since 2012. They have
two young sons (Tr. 12) In 2007, he earned a bachelor’s degree of science in mathematics
and physics and his doctorate in 2018, both from U.S. universities. Applicant worked for
various  companies  in  the  United  States,  on  a  post  doctorate  fellowship  for  a  federal
government agency, and performed research for that U.S. government agency from 2017
to 2018. He has been employed with his current employer since February 2020, and is
sponsored  for  a  security  clearance.  (Tr.  40)  This  is  Applicant’s  first  application  for  a
security clearance, dated 2016. (GE 1)
Applicant  was  born  in  the  United  States  to  U.S.  parents  who  are  citizens  and
residents of  the  United  States, but possess dual  citizenship  with  Israel.  In 1985,  when
Applicant was nine months old, his parents moved to Israel because they were idealistic
in nature, not because they were unhappy with the United States. (Tr. 29) Thus, Applicant
is a dual citizen of the United States and Israel, and has a U.S. passport and an Israeli
passport. (GE 1) Applicant’s family had never lived in Israel prior to that time. Any Jewish
person is allowed to go to Israel and claim a right of Israeli citizenship.  Applicant and his
family travelled back to the United States annually and maintained close ties with their
extended  family,  most  of  whom  remain  based  in  America.  Applicant  is  close  to  his
grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins who reside in the United States. (Tr. 16)  When
Applicant  was  16,  his  parents  decided  it  was  time  to  move  back  to  the  United  States
permanently to care for their aging parents.
After Applicant’s, graduation from a U.S. undergraduate school in 2007, he felt a
longing to  return  to  Israel for the  culture  of  his youth.  (Tr.  27, 30) He  wanted  to  travel
around Europe and Morocco and wanted to go to Israel for a sense of adventure. (Tr. 32)
He lived with his cousin who is also an immigrant from the United States. He obtained a
job in Israel, but was drafted by the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) from about April 2008
until  November  2008.  (SOR  1.b)  Applicant  had  the  choice  to  serve  this  mandatory
requirement or be sent to jail. While in the IDF, he served as a truck driver. (Answer to
SOR) Applicant has no plans on serving in the IDF in the future, but if drafted, while in
Israel, he will have no choice but to serve or be jailed. SOR 1.c (GE 2)
During  his time  in  Israel, Applicant  enrolled  in a  two-year master’s program  at an
Israeli  Institute  of Technology.  This Institute  is sponsored,  in part,  by  private  donations
from  American Jews. (Tr. 34)  His  met his girlfriend, who later became his wife. She  is an
American  citizen  and was studying  abroad  in Israel.  He stayed  there to  be  with  her. (Tr.
32) Applicant returned  to  the  United  States  in 2011.   Upon  his return to  the  United  States.
Applicant did some work and research for U.S. government agencies.
Applicant’s wife does not possess dual citizenship.  (Tr. 40) She is a cantor in a
temple in the United States. (Tr. 40) Their two children were born in the United States,
but do have dual citizenship. (Tr. 42) Other than the period from 2007 and 2011, Applicant
has been based in the United States. (Tr. 26) His wife occasionally takes students who
are sponsored by private donations to visit Israel and experience what it is like. (Tr.41)
The purpose of the short visit is to introduce young Jews to their heritage. The trips may
occur every two years. (Tr. 42) She has never lived in Israel.
Applicant was adamant that he maintains his Israeli citizenship out of emotional
and spiritual ties not because he has a preference for Israel over the United States. (SOR
1.a). His family, along with other American-Jewish persons are fully devoted to the United
States.  His grandfather served in the U.S. military and is a veteran. His other grandfather
served  on  the  national  energy  committee  of  President  Carter.  In  tandem,  they  each
served various leadership positions in their local Jewish communities and advocated for
the state of Israel. (AE F)
The last time  Applicant visited Israel was in 2018 to  attend  a wedding.  (Tr. 25, GE
1) He had  been  travelling  from  about  2010  to  2015  to  see  family. (Tr. 48)  He  noted  that
he spent a  month in 2013 to trek across the  desert with his brother. (GE 1)
Applicant explained  that due  to  professional and  personal ties to  the  United  States,
it is highly  unlikely  that he  would move  back to  Israel for any  extended  period  of time. (Tr.
44) From  a  practical point  of  view, neither his wife  nor he, could get professional positions
in Israel. She is a cantor in  a  temple and they do not allow  female cantors in Israel. He is
involved in a  nuclear energy program for the  DOD. (Tr.  44)
Applicant’s top priority is his immediate family, all of whom live in the United States.
His parents live nearby and his children are deeply committed to their grandparents. His
wife’s  parents  are  in  the  United  States  and  are  U.S.  citizens,  and  do  not  have  dual
citizenship. His siblings live in the United States.  Applicant’s wife has some cousins in
Israel with whom she has no contact. (Tr. 48) Applicant no longer has contacts with the
people he met in the IDF. His last communication was in 2016. He has no friends or family
who serve within the IDF. (Tr. 51)
Applicant and  his wife  own  a  home  in the  United  States of  considerable value. (AE
J) They  both  have  good  salaries.  Applicant has investments  in  the  United  States worth
about  $84,000.  (AE   J)  He  provided   documentation   to   prove   his   assertions.  (AE   J)
Applicant has one  account in  Israel with  a  few  hundred  dollars. He  did not close  it, but
never invested  money  in  it.  Israel  charges fees  for  the  account,  so  he  may  have  a  negative
balance. He stands to inherit nothing  in Israel.
Applicant would not have access to Israeli healthcare benefits because he has not
paid Israeli taxes for the last ten years. The taxes allow you to benefit from the Israeli
health care. This is true even if you are not living in Israel. Applicant would not gain any
immediate benefit or financial gain by returning to Israel. He receives no pension from his
IDF service. He is willing to give up his Israeli passport. (GE 1)
When  Applicant  completed  his  September  14,  2016  SCA,  and  his  DOHA
interrogatories, he disclosed people who he knew from the IDF. Now, he no longer keeps
in contact with them. (GE 2) He listed his trips to Israel and the number of days he was in
Israel. (GE 1) He listed the employer he worked for when in Israel. Applicant no longer
has contact with the people he knew in the IDF since so many years have gone by. The
SCA also contained his other trips to Europe for tourism. (GE 1) He responded negatively
to an inquiry into whether he has had, within the last seven years, any close or continuing
contact with a foreign national to whom he was “bound by affection, influence, common
interests, and/or obligation.” (GE 1.) Applicant did not think of friends as foreign nationals
because he became friends with them in childhood.
On September 17, 2018, Applicant was interviewed  by an authorized investigator
for  the  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM).  He  was  asked  a  question  about  his
allegiance to Israel or the U.S.. He does not remember the question exactly but, stated
he had never been in a  position to  choose.  (SOR  1.a)  Applicant further stated that he
maintains his Israeli citizenship out of emotional ties, and he is not willing to renounce his
Israeli  citizenship  because  it  would  be  spiritually  disruptive.  (SOR  1.a)  The  OPM
summarized interview states:
Subject contemplated a moment so that he could respond to the question.
He stated that he has never had any conflicts with any sense of allegiance
to Israel or the United States. He admits to saying that at the time.  He does
feel connected to Israel and allegiance to the United States. He maintains
his Israeli citizenship out of emotional ties. Applicant also answered that the
report  does  not  accurately  reflect  the  information  provided  during  the
interview. He stated that at the time, he was considering the possibility of
returning  to  Israel  but  at  the  present  time,  due  to  both  personal  and
professional reasons, he is committed to remaining in the United States and
serving as a loyal citizen thereof.
Applicant told the investigator that he served in the IDF, which is mandatory. That
has already been discussed earlier in the decision. (SOR 1.b) As to allegation SOR 1.c,
that  Applicant  has  a  standing  obligation  to  the  IDF  and  he  intends  on  fulfilling  this
obligation, Applicant stated that this statement is incomplete. (Answer to SOR), not in any
specialized (combat, intelligence) position.  Applicant stated that he has no plans to serve
again in the IDF. He served as a truck driver. (GE 2) While he lived in Israel, he had a
standing  obligation  to  the  IDF.  That  is  not  the  case  now,  (GE  2)  He  has  no  rights,
privileges, or benefits owed to or received from Israel. (GE 2) He stated: “I have no plans
to move to Israel. I am full devoted to the United States, and my feelings for my Jewish
heritage in Israel do not conflict.” (Tr. 63)
At the hearing, Applicant related that this narrative is common among American
Jews.  Although  religiously affiliated  with  Israel,  we  are  no  less  than  fully  devoted  U.S.
citizens.  (Tr.  63)  He  stated  that  he  has  never  received  encouragement  from  any
companies  foreign  intelligence  or  security  service  companies  urging  him  to  engage  in
industrial espionage. (GE 2)
On  June  1,  2020,  the  DCSA  CAF  issued  an  SOR  to  Applicant  alleging  foreign
influence  security  concerns  because  of  his  extended  relatives  who  are  citizens  and
residents  of  Israel.  (SOR  2.a)  “I  want  to  emphasize  again  that  the  only  reason  I  listed
friends  as  foreign  contacts  is  because  I  met  them  when  they  lived  in  the  US,  as
Americans.”  (GE  2.)  Otherwise  stated,  Applicant  has  no  reportable  foreign  contacts
beyond these friends, who were living in the United States when he met them. Some were
actually from other European countries when he was studying in Israel. (GE 1)
Applicant’s brother and sister live in the United States. His mother and father, and
his wife’s parents live in the United States. They have strong ties to the United States. He
has many cousins living in the United States. (Tr. 45) Applicant’s wife has second cousins
living in Israel. (Tr. 47) She does not maintain close contact with them. The contacts are
on an irregular basis by email, text, or phone.(GE 1 pg 69-71) Applicant’s aunt and uncle
live in Israel, but are U.S. citizens.( Tr.73)
Applicant’s work colleague  testified  on  his behalf. He  has  a  security  clearance  and
testified  that he  works closely  with  Applicant.   (Tr. 77) The  project  that they  work on  for
the  DOD is to  enable the  United  States to  reduce  reliance  on  oil  sources overseas. (Tr.
78)  The  team  benefits  highly  from  Applicant’s work. (Tr. 82) He  recommends Applicant
and  attests to  the fact that he  would never reveal proprietary  or classified  information  on
the  project.  (Tr. 84) The  witness has been  to  Applicant’s home  and  met his family. (Tr.90)
Applicant has no preference for Israel. He intends to  “serve  [our] country for the
rest  of  [his]  life.” He  is  grateful to be able to use his skills to  contribute to the national
security and considers himself fortunate to work for his employer. (AE K.) He is familiar
with his reporting responsibilities with regard to foreign contacts and attempts at foreign
influence. He asserts that if either friend X or friend Y were to ask any probing questions
about the nature of his work or attempt to influence him, he would report it immediately
and follow appropriate security procedures. (AE A; Tr. 53.) (AE A-E)
As  the  lead  designer,  developer,  and  tester  for  the  search-based  operations
component of a complex project, Applicant had another great year during his time at the
laboratory  in  2020.  (AE  G.)  Applicant  was  the  first  one  of  his  work  group  ever  to  be
selected  for  their  employer’s  highly  competitive  scholar’s  program.  (Tr.  27.)  When
Applicant left the project to pursue his master’s degree, his group was “sad” to lose him
to graduate school, but knew the laboratory would benefit. (AE G.) Applicant’s employer
paid his full tuition plus a portion of his salary while he was pursuing his graduate degree.
Applicant earned his master’s degree in one year and returned to work at the laboratory
in May 2021. (AE K; Tr. 27-28.)
Administrative Notice
Administrative notice is not taken of the source documents in their entirety, but of
specific  facts  properly  noticed  and  relevant  and  material  to  the  issues.  I  take
administrative notice of the facts requested by the Government in HE I and of other facts
set forth in the source publications from the U.S. State Department, including the updated
travel advisory.
Israel is a vibrant parliamentary democracy with a modern economy. Despite the
instability and armed conflict that have marked Israel’s relations within the region since
the  country  came  into  existence,  Israel  has  developed  a  robust,  diversified,  and
technologically-advanced  market  economy.  The  relationship  between  Israel  and  the
United States is friendly and yet complex. Since 1948, the United States and Israel have
had  a  close  friendship  based  on  common  democratic  values,  religious  affinities,  and
security  interests.  Israel  is  considered  a  critical  ally  and  friend  of  the  United  States.
Successive  U.S.  Administrations  and  Congress  have  demonstrated  a  commitment  to
Israel’s security and to maintaining close bilateral ties. Israel and the United States signed
a  10-year  $38  billion  memorandum  of  understanding  in  2016  ensuring  robust  defense
cooperation.  The  United  States  recognized  Jerusalem  as  Israel’s  capital  in  December
2017  without  taking  a  position  on  Israel’s  sovereign  boundaries.  The  United  States  is
Israel’s largest single-country trading partner. Israel is a leading recipient of U.S. foreign
aid and is a frequent purchaser of major U.S. weapons systems.
In  addition  to  security  assistance,  the  United  States  participates  in  a  variety  of
exchanges  with  Israel,  including  joint  military  exercises,  research,  and  weapons
development.  Through  an  annual  joint  counterterrorism  group  and  regular  strategic
dialogues,  the  United  States  and  Israel  work  together  to  counter  a  range  of  regional
threats.  As  of  January  20,  2021,  the  U.S.  State  Department  reported  that  the
“unbreakable  bond  between  [the]  two  countries  has  never  been  stronger.”  Yet,  the
interests of the two countries are not always aligned. The United States is committed to
promoting a comprehensive and lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and to
encouraging  increased  cooperation  and  normalization  of  ties  between  Israel  and  Arab
and Muslim majority states.
The  security  situation  remains  complex  in Israel, the  West Bank,  and  Gaza.  The
U.S.  recognition   of  Jerusalem   as   Israel’s  capital   in   December  2017   and   of   Israel’s
sovereignty  over the  Golan  Heights  in March 2019,  and  the  U.S.  failure to  condemn  as
illegal  Israeli   settlements  in  the   West  Bank,  have   led   to   a   recent  rise   in  anti-U.S.
sentiment,  especially   in  the   West  Bank.   Several  demonstrations   occurred   at  U.S.
government  facilities,   and   designated   foreign   terrorist  organizations  called   for  the
targeting   of   U.S.  persons.  Throughout  2019,  hostile  organizations  associated   with
designated  terrorist groups  (Lebanese  Hizb’allah, the  Popular Front for the  Liberation  of
Palestine   (PFLP),  Hamas,  and   the   Palestinian   Islamic  Jihad   (PIJ))   and   Iran   launched
mortars,  rockets, and  incendiary  devices into  Israel. The  U.S. State  Department  currently
advises travelers to  reconsider travel to  Israel due  to  COVID-19  and  to  exercise  increased
caution  in  Israel  due  to  terrorism  and  civil  unrest.  Travel to  the  West Bank is  to  be  avoided
due   to   COVID-19,   and   U.S.   travelers  are  warned   to   exercise   increased   caution   in  the
West  Bank. All  travel to  Gaza  is  to  be  avoided  due  to  COVID-19, terrorism, civil  unrest,
and   armed   conflict.   Terrorist  groups  and   lone-wolf   terrorists  continue   plotting   possible
attacks  in  Israel,  the  West Bank, and  Gaza.  Terrorists may  attack  with  little  or  no  warning,
targeting   tourist  locations,  transportation   hubs,  markets/shopping   malls,  and   local
government facilities.  The   U.S.   State   Department  notes that  there has  been   a  marked
increase  in demonstrations throughout Israel, some  with  little or no  warning. The  security
infrastructure in Gaza  is under the  control of  Hamas, a  U.S.-designated  foreign  terrorist
organization,  and   the   environment  within  Gaza   and   on   its  borders  is  dangerous  and
volatile.
Persons seeking to enter or depart Israel, the West Bank, or Gaza were reminded
as of January 2021 that they are subject to immigration and security screening, possibly
including  prolonged  questioning  and  physical  searches,  and  that  they  may  be  denied
entry  or  exit.  Israeli  security  officials  have  on  occasion  requested  access  to  travelers’
personal email accounts or other social media accounts as a condition of entry. Travelers
were advised that they should have no expectation of privacy for any data stored on their
devices or in their accounts under those circumstances.
Civilian authorities in Israel maintained effective control over security services in
Israel  in  2020.  Significant  human  rights  issues  in  Israel  in  2020  included  reports  of
unlawful or arbitrary killings, including targeted killings of Israeli citizens and soldiers. The
Israeli  Defense  Forces  reported  190  instances  of  rocket  fire  from  Gaza  into  Israeli
territory. The Israeli Security Agency foiled 423 significant terror attacks in the West Bank
and  Jerusalem  in  2020.  Israeli  forces  engaged  in  conflict  throughout  the  year  with
Palestinian  militants  in  Gaza  in  response  to  rocket  attacks,  incendiary  balloons,  and
attempted infiltrations. The Israeli military and civilian justice systems found that members
of  the  security  forces  committed  human  rights  abuses  on  occasion.  However,  Israel’s
government took steps to prosecute and punish officials who committed abuses within
Israel regardless of rank or seniority. There is no indication that the Israeli government
has used coercive methods on its resident citizens to obtain U.S. sensitive information.
Nor are there any reports of direct involvement by the Israeli government in targeting the
United States.

"The  SOR  alleged,  under  Guideline  B,  that  Applicant,  a  U.S.  citizen  by  birth,  is
maintaining dual U.S - Turkish citizenship and residing in Turkey with his wife and children
(SOR ¶ 1.a); voted in a local Turkish election (SOR ¶ 1.b); has ties to resident citizens of
Turkey (SOR ¶¶ 1.c through 1.f); and has assets in Turkey (SOR ¶¶ 1.g. and 1.h). Under
Guideline C, the SOR cross-alleged the same facts alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a (SOR ¶ 2.a) and
also alleged that Applicant used his Turkish citizenship to: purchase a home in Turkey
with funds borrowed from a Turkish financial institution (SOR ¶ 2.b); obtain employment
with a Turkish company in Turkey (SOR ¶ 2.c); qualify his children to attend a special
school in Turkey (SOR ¶ 2.d); and access the Turkish healthcare system (SOR ¶  2.e).
Under Guideline C, it also alleged that Applicant pays about 65% of his earned income in
taxes to Turkey (SOR ¶ 2.c).
In  his  Answer,  Applicant  admitted  each  Guideline  B  allegation.  However,
I
construed his response to SOR ¶ 1.g as a denial (as discussed below). With respect to
Guideline C, he denied the general concern and admitted all but one of the  allegations
(SOR  ¶  2.e).  However,  I  also  construed  his  response  to  SOR  ¶  2.b  as  a  denial  (as
discussed below).
Applicant, age 43, is a U.S. citizen by birth. He obtained his Turkish citizenship in
September 2013, which he continues to maintain as a dual U.S - Turkish citizen. His wife
is a Turkish  citizen by birth  and a  lawful permanent resident of  the  United  States.  Her
application for that  status  was  sponsored  by  Applicant  in  2003.  Applicant  and  his  wife
were married in Turkey in December 2001. Their three children, ages 9, 17, and 19, are
dual U.S - Turkish citizens. The 17-year-old was born in the United States (in May 2005),
and the other two  children  in Turkey. His wife’s  and  children’s resident  and citizenship
statuses  were  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  1.c.  In  his  Answer,  he  admitted  the  allegation  and
asserted that all three of his children plan to attend college in the United States. (GE 1,
2, 4)
Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Air Force upon his  graduation from high school in
December 1997. He served on active duty until he medically retired in April 2005, due to
service-related  injuries.  While  on  active  duty,  he  was  stationed  in  Turkey  from  2000
through  2005  (he  was  in  England  from  1997  through  2000).  Applicant  earned  his
bachelor’s  degree  in  2011  from  an  online  U.S.  university  he  attended  from  May  2009
through  May  2011.  His  current  U.S.  defense  contractor  employer  is  sponsoring  his
pending application for a trustworthiness determination. (GE 1, 2, 4)
Applicant has lived and worked in Turkey since 2000, except for the period from
March  2005  until  May  2008,  when  he  lived  and  worked  in  the  United  States.  He  has
resided with his wife and children in Turkey since May 2008. Besides referencing the birth
of their child in the United States in May 2005, the  record did not address whether his
wife and children resided with him in the United States between  March 2005 and May
2008,  or whether he  resided  with  his wife  and  children  in Turkey prior to  March  2005.
SOR ¶ 1.a and ¶ 2.a alleged: “You applied for citizenship in Turkey and became a dual
citizen of Turkey and the United States in about September 2013. You have resided in
Turkey with your spouse and three children since about 2008.” In his Answer, he admitted
SOR ¶ 1.a and asserted: “My mother-in-law is very ill and my wife takes care of her, as
a[n]  at  home  care  giver.”  He  admitted  SOR  ¶  2.a  and  asserted  that  he  has  returned
“home”  to  the  United  States  “on  leave”  every  year,  except  in  2020  due  to  COVID-19
restrictions and health issues that have put him at higher risk for COVID-19 complications.
(GE 1, 2, 4)
Applicant returned to the United States in March 2005 and expended his terminal
leave before processing out of the Air Force. He volunteered for five months beginning in
April 2005 for a U.S. healthcare company and then worked as its director of sales and
marketing  until  May  2007,  when  he  left  to  find  a  job  closer  to  his  residence.  He  then
worked as a quality control dispatcher for a U.S. delivery carrier from May 2007 through
May 2008, when he left to pursue a job opening at his former duty station in Turkey. Upon
his return to Turkey in May 2008, he was unemployed until January 2009 while waiting
for his contract to begin with the Turkish contractor for whom he worked as an assistant
bulk  storage  superintendent  until  January  2014,  when  his  contract  ended.  The  record
indicated  that,  although  the  contractor  for  whom  he  worked  was  a  Turkish  entity,  his
contract  supported  the  U.S.  Air  Force  base.  He  was  unemployed  again  from  January
2014 until March 2014 while waiting for his contract, also in support of the U.S. Air Force
base,  to  begin  with  his  current  U.S.  defense  contractor  employer.  During  those  two
periods  of  unemployment,  he  was  financially  supported  by  his  U.S.  Department  of
Veterans Affairs (VA) disability income. (GE 1, 2, 4)
When asked on his 2014 and 2016 SF86s how he acquired his Turkish citizenship,
Applicant answered:
My   wife   is Turkish   and   I   have   lived   and   worked   in   Turkey   for   approx.  10
years.  During   my   last   DOD  contract  I   was  told  [by   a   person   or entity   not
indicated   in   the   record]  to   get   a   Turkish   citizenship  because   it   would  be
easier than  always applying for a work permit.
He also stated that he planned to renounce his Turkish citizenship when he returned to
the United States after completing “all [of his] work overseas.” He further explained: “With
children in Turkish school and getting credit for buying house/car I need to have a Turkish
ID number.” (GE 1, 2)
Applicant  was  interviewed  twice  (in  May and  June  2019) in  connection  with  the
background investigation apparently prompted by his 2016 SF86. During his May 2019
interview, he stated that he obtained his Turkish citizenship so that he could get a job in
Turkey  to  supplement  his  VA  disability  income,  which  was  insufficient  to  meet  his
expenses; and to allow him to work in Turkey without having to obtain work permits. He
maintained that he had only one obligation associated with his Turkish citizenship: to pay
65% of his earned income in Turkish taxes. With respect to the rights and privileges of
his Turkish  citizenship,  he  stated  that  it afforded him  access  to  the Turkish  healthcare
system and the ability to own land in Turkey; and that, without it, his children would not
be able to attend the special Turkish school in which they were enrolled. He asserted that,
while  his  loyalty  is  to  the  United  States,  he  was  unwilling  to  renounce  his  Turkish
citizenship because doing so would preclude him from being able to work as a disabled
veteran in Turkey. He also stated that he would not renounce his citizenship because he
would not be able to own any land there. He explained that he had a house that he had
been paying for that was in his brother-in-law’s name, but would soon be in Applicant’s
name. (GE 4 at 5)
Later during Applicant’s May 2019 interview, he acknowledged that he owned his
home in Turkey, which he bought from his brother-in-law for US $85,000 in late 2018. He
explained that he was waiting for his brother-in-law, who then resided outside of Turkey,
to return to Turkey to switch the house over to Applicant’s name. During his June 2019
interview, he stated that even though he paid for it, his house is not in Applicant’s name.
He explained that in Turkey, because you build on top of other houses, he built his house
on  top  of  his  brother-in-law’s  house.  He  also  stated  that  even  though,  technically,  his
brother-in-law owns the land, his brother-in-law would not be able to sell Applicant’s home
without Applicant’s signature. SOR ¶ 1.g alleged: “You purchased a home in Turkey for
about $85,000 USD in about 2018. You used money borrowed from a Turkish financial
institution to purchase your home.” Although he admitted that allegation, he also asserted
in the accompanying explanation that: “I did not purchase/buy my house I built and added
to the upstairs of my brother-in-law’s house.  The  house  belongs to  my  brother-in-law.”
Thus, as previously indicated, I construed his answer to SOR ¶ 1.g as a denial. (GE 4 at
5, 9)
SOR  ¶   2.b   alleged:  “You   used   your  Turkish   citizenship  to   purchase   a   home   in
Turkey  in about 2018. You  used  your Turkish  citizenship to  borrow  money  from a  Turkish
financial   institution   to   enable  you   to   purchase   your  home.”  Although   he   admitted   that
allegation, the  accompanying  explanation  concerned   solely  the  facts alleged  in SOR ¶
2.c and  was not  responsive  to  the  facts  in  SOR ¶  2.b. Thus, as  previously  indicated, I
construed   his answer  to   SOR  ¶   2.b   as  a   denial,  particularly   in  light  of   the   explanation
accompanying  his response  to SOR ¶  1.g.
On  Applicant’s  2014  and  2016  SF86s,  he  reported  that  he  has  been  eligible  to
receive  medical  benefits  in  Turkey  since  January  2009.  He  explained  “I  worked  for  a
Turkish contractor and I paid into the SSK system, my family and I are eligible to use the
Turkish government hospitals . . . I still receive it and I will receive it in my next job.” SOR
¶  2.e  alleged:  “You  used  your  Turkish  citizenship  to  obtain  access  to  the  Turkish
healthcare system for you and your family.” In his Answer, he denied the allegation and
asserted:
[Y]es I do  have  Turkish  socialized  health  care  [sic] that comes with  paying
taxes in Turkey. I would not have  socialized  healthcare if  I did not have  a
job and pay taxes. I do not use this healthcare as I have TRICARE and  my
family  I are seen  at a  Network Facility  in . .  . Turkey. If  I were to  go  to  a
Turkish  Government Hospital, then  yes I would have  insurance  because  I
pay taxes. (GE  1  at 38-39; GE  2  at 37-38)
SOR ¶ 2.c alleged: “You used your Turkish citizenship to obtain employment with
a  Turkish  company  in  Turkey.  You  pay  the  government  of  Turkey  about  64%  of  your
earned  income  for  your  Turkish  employment  income  taxes.”  In  his  Answer,  Applicant
explained  that  his  current  employer  pays  his  salary,  but  does  so  by  paying  a  Turkish
company who direct deposits his paycheck into a Turkish bank. He also stated  that his
employer pays a Turkish company “for [him] to pay a progressive tax that ends up being
65% at the end of the year.”  He stated that he maintains a U.S. bank account, but  the
record  did  not  indicate  its  balance.  He  was  not  sure  why  his  employer  did  not  direct
deposit his paycheck into his U.S. bank account, but suspected that it may relate to his
obligation to pay taxes in order to live and work in Turkey. (GE 4 at 6)
During Applicant’s May 2019 interview, he disclosed that he maintains a loan, bank
account,  and  credit  cards  in  Turkey  because  he  lives  there.  During  his  June  2019
interview, he stated that he had maintained only one bank account in Turkey since about
2014, with a balance of approximately US $15,000. SOR ¶ 1.h alleged: “You maintain a
bank account in Turkey valued  at about $15,000 USD.  You have  credit  card accounts
issued by a Turkish bank.” In his Answer, he admitted the allegation and explained: “I do
have  a  bank  account  and  it  is  where  I  receive  my  check  for  the  job  I  need  this
[trustworthiness determination] for.” (GE 4 at 5, 9)
On Applicant’s 2016 SF86, he reported that he had owned a car in Turkey since
January 2014 with an estimated value of  US $20,179. He indicated that he was still in
possession of that car during his May 2019 interview. Because this car was not alleged
in the SOR, I will consider it only to evaluate mitigation and the whole person. During his
June 2019 interview, he indicated that he no longer owns a car in the United States as he
gave  it  to  his  grandparents  before  he  returned  to  Turkey  in  2008.  His  U.S.  car  was
eventually repossessed after his grandparents failed to make the payments, as promised,
on the loan for the car. (GE 1 at 37-38; GE 4 at 5, 8)
On  Applicant’s  2014  and 2016 SF86s, he reported  that his U.S. income  tax return
was audited  by  the  IRS  in 2013. He stated  that he  learned  from  the  IRS  that he  was not
entitled  to  the  earned  income  tax  credit because  he works overseas. He also stated  that
he  set up  a  payment  plan  with  the  IRS  and  his  U.S. state  tax  authority  to  repay  the  earned
income  credit  through  his “future  taxes.” He estimated  the  amount  owed  as US $5,000.
He explained  that the  reason  he  applied  the  earned  income  credit  on  his tax  return  was
because  he  was “told” to do  so  (by  a  person or entity  not  indicated  in  the  record).  During
his May  2019  interview,  in reference  to  the  2013  IRS  audit, he  stated  that  his employer
wrote  a  letter on  his behalf  to  the  IRS  and his U.S. state  tax  authority  stating  that he  has
Turkish taxes taken from  his paycheck. He  stated  that he  had not  heard any  more about
the  issue  since  his employer sent the  letter. Then  he  asserted  that he  does not pay  U.S.
taxes because he pays taxes to Turkey. The  SOR did not allege  facts with respect to his
U.S. tax  obligations;  therefore,  they  will be  considered  only  to  evaluate  mitigation  and  the
whole person.  (GE 1 at 44-45; GE 2  at 46-48;  GE 4  at 6)
During  Applicant’s  May  2019  interview,  he  stated  that  he  voted  in  a  mayoral
election  in  Turkey  in  March  2019  and  did  so  because  he  has  the  right  to  vote.  He
maintained that he had no plans to vote in any future elections. SOR ¶ 1.b alleged: “You
exercised  your  right  to  vote  as  a  Turkish  citizen  by  voting  in  a  local  Turkish  mayoral
election in about March 2019.” In his Answer, he admitted the allegation and explained:
“I was asked [by a person or entity not indicated in the record] to vote in the local mayoral
election.” (GE 4 at 5-6)
SOR  ¶ 2.d  alleged:  “You  used  your Turkish  citizenship  as a  basis for qualifying
your children to attend special school in Turkey.” In Applicant’s Answer, he admitted the
allegation  and  explained:  “My  wife  and  I  are  not  teachers  so  we  would  not  be  able  to
homeschool our children.”
Applicant’s parents, stepfather, and two siblings are citizens of the United States
by birth. His stepmother is a Brazilian citizen by birth and a naturalized U.S. citizen. They
all reside in the United States. His father-in-law is deceased. As alleged in SOR ¶ 1.d,
which Applicant admitted, Applicant’s mother-in-law is a resident citizen of Turkey. She is
78 years old and a citizen of Turkey by birth. She lives in Turkey next door to Applicant.
He has daily contact with her. Since 2008, he has provided her with financial support of
about US $400 per month by paying all of her bills. Because she is unable to pay her own
bills, he intends to continue providing this support. Applicant reported no employer for his
mother-in-law on his 2014 and 2016 SF86s and stated that she was not “affiliated with a
foreign government, military, security, defense industry, foreign movement, or intelligence
service.” (GE 1 at 34-35; GE 2 at 35-36; GE 4 at 5)
SOR ¶ 1.e, which Applicant admitted, alleged that his brother-in-law is a resident
citizen of Turkey. The record otherwise contains scant details about his brother-in-law,
including  to  whom  he  is  married,  his  employment,  and  any  affiliation  with  a  foreign
government,  military,  security,  defense  industry,  foreign  movement,  or  intelligence
service. Despite having indicated that his brother-in-law lived outside of Turkey for at least
some period of time, he admitted the allegation without explanation in his Answer.
On  Applicant’s 2014  and  2016  SF86s, he reported  that neither he  nor his wife  had,
within the  prior seven  years, close  or continuing  contacts with  any  other foreign  nationals.
However, on  his 2014  SF86, he  listed  a  friend  (A),  who  resided  in Turkey,  as one  of  his
four  references.  He  also  referred   to   this  friend   as  a   neighbor.  A   was  not  otherwise
discussed  in the  record  so  his citizenship status,  employment,  and  possible  connection
to  a  foreign  government are unknown. During  his May  2019  interview, Applicant reported
two  foreign  contacts that he  described  as coworkers who  were resident citizens  of  Turkey.
He had  known  one  coworker (B), who  is also the  godfather to  one  of  his children,  since
2015. He  had  known  the  other coworker (C) since  2018. He  reported  daily  contact  with  B
and  C,  and  that both  were employed  by  the  U.S.  Air  Force with  no  foreign  government
affiliations. Another name  (D) was  mentioned during  a follow up call  with the investigator
after   his  May   2019   interview.  However,  the   record   was  not  clear   as   to   whether  the
referenced  name  was an  inadvertent  misspelling  of one  of  the  aforementioned  persons
or another foreign  contact.  SOR ¶  1.f  alleged: “Your two  friends are citizens and  residents
of   Turkey.  One   friend   is  Godfather  to   one   of   your  children.”  In   his  Answer,  Applicant
admitted  the  allegation  and  reiterated  that both  work for  the  U.S.  Air  Force.  (GE  1  at 19-
20, 36; GE 2 at 20, 37; GE 4 at 4, 7)
In Applicant’s Answer, he expressed the following with respect to the Guideline B
and Guideline C concerns:
I would never or have  never indicated  a  preference  to  a  foreign  country  over
the United States. I live here for my job and  my  wife is here for her mother.
My   children   live   here   because   they   are  our  children   and   I   believe   that
children   should   grow   up   with   their   parents  not  guardians  or  wards  of   the
state  because  I work overseas . . .I  am  a  very  proud  American, I served  in
the  United  States Air  Force from  which I am  medically  retired  due  to  injuries
that  I   obtained   during   my   service.   I  love   working   with   the   [U.S.  Air   Force
base   in  Turkey]  population   .  .   .   I  would  never  nor  have   ever  put  another
country  above  America, nor has  my  family. I would like  for it to  be  on  record
that  I am  deeply  offended  that  my  love  and  loyalty  to  the  country  I served  is
in   question,  but  I  also   understand   that  you   are  just   doing   your  job   and
protecting   American   from   people  that  do   not  have   the   best  interests  of
America  at heart.
Turkey
Turkey  is  a  constitutional  republic  with  an  executive  presidential  system  and  a
unicameral  600  seat  parliament  (the  Grand  National  Assembly).  In  presidential  and
parliamentary  elections  in  2018,  Organization  for  Security  and  Cooperation  in  Europe
observers expressed concern regarding restrictions on media reporting and the campaign
environment, including the jailing of a presidential candidate that restricted the ability of
opposition candidates to compete on an equal basis and campaign freely.
The  friendship  between  the  United  States and  Turkey  dates back to  1831,  when
the  United  States established  diplomatic  relations with  the  Ottoman  Empire. The  United
States  condemned  the  July  15, 2016  coup  attempt  in  Turkey, and  continues  to  emphasize
the  importance  of the  Turkish  government’s adherence  to  policies and  actions  that build
public trust in the  country’s democratic institutions and  the  rule  of  law, as well  as upholding
human  rights commitments.  Turkey  is an  important U.S. security  partner, and  has been
a valued North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) ally since 1952.
On  December 14, 2020, the  United  States imposed  sanctions on  the  Republic of
Turkey’s  Presidency   of   Defense   Industries   (SSB)  pursuant   to   Section   231   of  the
Countering   America’s   Adversaries  Through   Sanctions  Act  (CAATSA)  for  knowingly
engaging  in a  significant transaction  with  Russia’s main arms export entity  by procuring
the  S-400  surface-to-air  missile system. The  United  States made  clear to  Turkey  at the
highest levels and  on  numerous  occasions  that  its purchase  of  the  S-400  system  would
endanger the  security  of  U.S.  military  technology  and  personnel and  provide  substantial
funds to  Russia’s defense  sector, as well  as Russian  access to  the  Turkish  armed  forces
and  defense  industry. Turkey  nevertheless decided  to  move  ahead  with  the  procurement
and   testing   of   the   S-400,  despite   the   availability   of   alternative,  NATO-interoperable
systems to  meet its defense  requirements. This decision  resulted  in Turkey’s suspension
and  pending removal from  the global F-35 Joint Strike Fighter partnership.
Turkey  continues its  efforts to  defeat terrorist organizations both  inside  and  outside
its  borders,  including   the   Kurdistan   Workers’   Party   (PKK),  the   Revolutionary   People’s
Liberation   Party/Front,  and   ISIS.  Turkey   is  an   active   contributor  in  international
counterterrorism  fora,  including  the  GCTF  and  the  Defeat-ISIS  Coalition.  However,
Turkey is a source and transit country for foreign terrorist fighters (FTFs) seeking to join
ISIS and other terrorist groups fighting in Syria and Iraq, as well as for FTFs who seek to
depart Syria and Iraq. Moreover, the PKK continues to conduct terrorist attacks in Turkey
and against Turkish interests outside of Turkey including by taking hostages. In 2020, the
PKK and its affiliates claimed responsibility for a rocket attack on a the Gurbulak customs
gate  with Iran  that  killed  two  Turkish  Customs  officials,  a  suicide  bomber  that  struck  a
natural gas pipeline near the Turkish-Iranian border, taking the pipeline offline for months,
and a  bombing in Mardin province  that temporarily disabled an oil pipeline  running from
Iraq to Turkey.  Turkey has a broad definition of terrorism that includes so-called crimes
against  constitutional  order  and internal  and  external  security  of  the  state,  which  the
government  regularly  used  to criminalize  the  exercise  of  freedom  of  expression  and
peaceful assembly.
Significant  human  rights  issues  exist  in  Turkey  including  credible  reports  of:
arbitrary killings; suspicious deaths of persons in custody; forced disappearances; torture;
arbitrary  arrest  and  continued  detention  of  tens  of  thousands  of  persons,  including
opposition  politicians  and  former  members  of  parliament,  lawyers,  journalists,  human
rights activists, and employees of the U.S. Mission, for purported ties to “terrorist” groups
or  peaceful  legitimate  speech;  political  prisoners,  including  elected  officials;  politically
motivated reprisal against individuals located outside the country, including kidnappings
and transfers without due process of alleged members of the Gulen movement; significant
problems  with  judicial  independence;  support  for  Syrian  opposition  groups  that
perpetrated serious abuses in conflict, including the recruitment and use of child soldiers;
severe  restrictions  on  freedom  of  expression,  the  press,  and  the  internet,  including
violence and threats of violence against journalists, closure of media outlets, and arrests
or  criminal  prosecution  of  journalists  and  others  for  criticizing  government  policies  or
officials, censorship, site blocking, and criminal libel laws; severe restriction of freedoms
of  assembly,  association,  and  movement,  including  overly  restrictive  laws  regarding
government oversight of nongovernmental organizations and civil society organizations;
some  cases  of  refoulement  of  refugees;  serious  government  harassment  of  domestic
human rights organizations; gender-based violence; crimes involving violence targeting
members of national/racial/ethnic minority groups; and crimes involving violence against
lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex persons.
The Turkish government took limited steps to investigate, prosecute, and punish
members of the security forces and other officials accused of human rights abuses; and
impunity  remained  a  problem.  The  government  took  limited  steps  to  investigate
allegations of high-level corruption. Clashes between security forces and the Kurdistan
Workers’ Party terrorist organization and its affiliates continued and resulted in the injury
or  death  of  security  forces,  terrorists,  and  civilians.  The  government  did  not  release
information on efforts to investigate or prosecute personnel for wrongful or inadvertent
deaths of civilians linked to counterterrorism operations.
The U.S. State Department warns U.S. citizens to exercise increased caution when
traveling to Turkey due to terrorism and arbitrary detentions. Terrorist groups continue
plotting possible attacks in Turkey. Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting
tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, local government facilities,
hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, parks, major sporting and cultural events,
educational institutions, airports, and other public areas.  Security forces have detained
tens  of  thousands  of  individuals,  including  U.S.  citizens,  for  alleged  affiliations  with
terrorist organizations based on scant or secret evidence and grounds that appear to be
politically motivated. U.S. citizens have also been subject to travel bans that prevent them
from departing Turkey.

"Applicant  admitted  allegations  1.a.,  1.b.,  1.c.,  1.e.,  and  2.b.  He  denied
allegations 1.d., 2.a., and 3.a.  He failed to admit or deny allegation 4.a. set forth in the
SOR.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  testimony,  I
make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  31  years  old  and  unmarried.  He  has  four  Master’s  degrees;
Business  Administration  and  Supply  Chain  Management;  Science;  Supply  Chain
Management; and Business Administration.  He is currently applying for a position as a
Linguist II with a defense contractor.  A security clearance in needed in connection with
this employment.
Foreign  Influence  –  Guideline B
Applicant’s  was  born  in  Alexandria,  Egypt  in  1989.  He  came  from  a  well-off
Egyptian  Coptic  orthodox  family.  He  grew  up  in  Egypt,  attended  and  completed  his
elementary school through university level education there, and then immigrated to the
United  States  in  June  2009,  seeking  better  employment  opportunities.  He  became  a
naturalized U.S. citizen in 2015.  He is currently a dual citizen of Egypt and the United
States.
1.a., 1.c., and  1.d.   Applicant’s   mother  and   father  are  citizens  and   residents   of   Egypt.
They are  currently both  retired.   Prior to  his  retirement,  Applicant’s  father served  in the
Egyptian   Air   Force  from   1975   to   1979.  He  was  a   2nd   Lieutenant  and   a  sharp   shooter.
Applicant communicates with  his father by telephone, text,  and  social media on  a  daily
basis.  (Government  Exhibit 3.)  Applicant also  communicates  with  his mother in  Egypt
by  telephone, text,  and   social  media  two   or three   times a   week.    (Government  Exhibit
3.)    His  parents  reside   in  Egypt,   but  have   green   cards  and   come   to   the   U.S.  to   visit
about  every  six  months  or  so.     Applicant’s   father  owns  four  properties  in  Egypt.
Applicant estimates  that his father’s property  in Egypt is worth  about  $200,000  in  U.S.
dollars, rather than $450,000 that he previously told the investigator.  Upon his father’s
death, Applicant stands to inherit an interest in these properties in Egypt.
Applicant’s  Exhibit  C  is  a  letter  to  the  Administrative  Judge,  undated,  which
indicates  that  since  1992,  Applicant’s  father  has  known  the  Director  of  Business
Development  and  Chief  Executive  Saudi  Arabia  for  a  U.S.  Defense  contractor.  (This
individual also submitted a letter of recommendation for Applicant.)  From 1995 to 2007,
Applicant’s  father  was  employed  as  the  General  Manager  of  a  Construction  Company
based in Cairo, Egypt.  The company was owed by the sister of the Director of Business
Development and Chief Executive Saudi Arabia for a U.S. defense contractor.  It is not
clear  whether  this  information  was  disclosed  during  the  investigation  of  the  Applicant.
(See Government Exhibits 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.)
1.b.   Applicant’s   sister  is  a   citizen   of   Egypt  who   now  resides  in  the   U.S.    She   has
obtained   her   permanent  resident  green   card,   and   intends  to   apply  for  her  U.S.
citizenship  next year.  (Tr. p. 33.)
1.e.   Applicant maintains  two  bank  accounts  in  Egypt.   One of  the  accounts he opened
in February 2008, the  other he  opened  in  May 2019.  He  states  that each  account  has
about  $200   in   it.     Applicant  also  has   a   credit   card   that  he   maintains  in  Egypt  and   has
invested   $2,400   in  an   Egyptian   bank  in  order  to   maintain  it.     He  uses  the   credit  card
when  he goes there, and his parents make the payments on it for him.   (Tr. p. 43-44.)
Foreign Preference  –  Guideline C
2.a. and 2.b.  After  becoming  a  naturalized  citizen  of  the  U.S.  in  January  2015,
Applicant primarily resided in and worked in Egypt from about April 2015 to about May
2019.  During  this  period  he  also  voted  in  Egyptian  elections  in  2014  and  2018.
Applicant  stated  that  he  is  encouraged  by  the  Egyptian  Church  Bishops  to  vote  in  the
Egyptian election, especially for the current president because he helped to rebuild the
churches for free after they were burned down  in  the 2011  revolution  in Egypt.  While
living in Egypt, Applicant enrolled as a student for an on-line Master’s program  offered
by  a  U.S.  University.  He  traveled  back  to  the  U.S.  every  six  months  or  so,  when
needed,  in  order  to  finish  his  Master’s  degree.  Applicant  stated  that  he  was
discriminated against by the U.S. University because  they deleted 13 classes  from his
transcript that he believes he should have received credit for.  He was  also placed on
academic probation in 2015.  The complete details of this situation were not presented.
(See Applicant’s Answer to SOR.)
Guideline K –  Handling Protected Information
Since  coming to the  United States,  Applicant has worked various  jobs.  He has
found it difficult to find stable and satisfying employment that will sustain his lifestyle.  In
the  past,  on  several  occasions,  he  has  returned  to  Egypt  to  live  with  his  parents
because of his financial struggles  in the U.S.  From 2013 through 2014, while living in
the U.S., Applicant was financially supported by his parents in Egypt.  During periods of
unemployment, his parents in Egypt have financially supported him.  For several years,
they  have  sent  him  approximately  $1,500  monthly  to pay  his monthly living  expenses.
Applicant explained that on this occasion,  he  returned to Egypt because  he  wanted to
enjoy his family and church practices in Egypt.  He also stated, “In simple terms, if there
was  no  church  in  Egypt,  I  won’t  have  any  motive  to  visit  my  home  country.”
(See
Applicant’s Answer to SOR.)
3.a.    In   March  2020,  while  employed   for  a   defense   contractor,  Applicant   was  fired   for
possessing   a   personal  device  and   taking   unauthorized   pictures  with   that  device  in  a
classified  area.   (Government Exhibit 4, and  Tr. pp. 59-70.)   In  August 2020, working  as
a   security   guard,  he   was  disciplined   for   starting   work  without  wearing   the   required
security officer uniform.
From  2011  to  the  present,  Applicant  has  worked  at  multiple  places  of
employment  in  the  U.S.  He  has  a  less  than  stellar  work  history.  On  a  number  of
occasions, he has either been released from his employment or fired for not fulfilling the
job requirements, or disciplined for misconduct of some sort.  In January 2011, working
as a store clerk, he was fired from his employment for a mistake he made working on
the register.  In May 2011, working as a business  development representative, he was
fired for not meeting the sales targets.  In December 2012, he was fired for sleeping on
the job.  (See Tr. pp. 71-73.)
Personal Conduct –  Guideline E
4.a.  (See discussion above  under 1.d.,  2.a.,  2.b., and 3.a.)
Mitigation
Letters  of  recommendation  from  various  individuals  who  know  the  Applicant
describe  his  favorable  character,  strong  work  ethic,  and  desire  to  obtain  employment.
(Applicant’s Exhibits E, E, F, G, H, I, and J.)
A  letter  from  a  retired  Lieutenant  Colonel,  who  is  currently  a  Director  of
International Business for a defense contractor, states that Applicant  would be a good
candidate for the U.S. military.  (Applicant’s Exhibit D.)  Another letter also indicates that
Applicant’s skills would be  helpful as a  military leader.  (Applicant’s Exhibits E.)  Other
letters recognize Applicant’s good  character and  excellent  technical skills.  (Applicant’s
Exhibits F through J.)
A  letter  from  a  priest affiliated  with  Applicant’s  church back  in  Egypt  states  that
Applicant was born and raised in the Egyptian Orthodox  Church in Egypt.  Applicant is
said  to  be  knowledgeable  in  multiple  languages,  and  has  an  expertise  in  the  Arabic
language  different  dialects.  He  is  described  as  honest,  intelligent,  dependable,  highly
educated and hardworking.  (Applicant’s Exhibit O.)
In  assessing  the  heightened  risk  created  as  a  result  of  Applicant  holding  a
security  clearance,  the  Applicant’s  ties  to  a  potentially  hostile  country  are  important.
Under  the  particular  facts  of  this  case,  I  have  taken  administrative  notice  of  the
information  provided  concerning  the  Country  of  Egypt.   Egypt  is a  republic governed  by
an elected president and bicameral legislature.   Although  China,  Russia,  and Iran,  stand
out  as  three   of  the   most  capable  and   active   cyber  actors  tied   to   economic  espionage
and  the  potential theft  of U.S. trade  secrets and  proprietary information, countries with
closer  ties  to   the   United   States   have   conducted   cyber  espionage   and   other  forms  of
intelligence  collection  to  obtain U.S, technology, intellectual property, trade  secrets, and
proprietary   information.    In   2019,   a   black-market   arms   dealer,   an   Egyptian,  who   was
also a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen, was found  guilty in a  scheme  to  sell  and  use  surface-to-
air   missiles  and   was  sentenced   to   30   years  in  federal  prison.    In   2016,   an   Egyptian
procurement  agent  and   two   Egyptian   citizens  were   sentenced   after  pleading   guilty  to
violation   of  the   Arms  Export  Control  Act  in  connection   with   the   attempted   shipment  of
munitions  samples from  New York City to  Egypt.   In  2015, Mostfa  Ahmed  Awwad  was
sentenced   to   132   months  in  prison   for  attempted   espionage   relating   to   his  attempt  to
provide  schematics of  the  nuclear aircraft  carrier Gerald  R.  Ford  to  Egypt,  while  serving
as a Navy  Engineer.
In addition, the U.S. Department of State has issued a Level 4 travel advisory for
Egypt,  advising  U.S.  nationals  not  to  travel  to  Egypt  due  to  COVID  19  and  Terrorism.
Terrorists  may  attack  with  little  or  no  warning  and  have  targeted  diplomatic  facilities,
tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets and shopping malls, western businesses,
restaurants,  resorts  and  local  government  facilities.  Terrorists  have  also  targeted
religious  sites.  There  were  an  estimated  234  terrorists  attacks  across  the  country  in
2020 of which the vast majority were claimed by ISIS-SP.  There are significant human
rights  issues  that  include  unlawful or  arbitrary  killings,  torture,  and cases  of  cruel,  and
inhuman  and  degrading  treatment  or  punishment  by  the  government,  harsh  and  life-
threatening  prison  conditions,  arbitrary  detention  and  political  prisoners  or  detainees,
politically motivated reprisal against individual located outside of the country to name a
few.

"Applicant is a 40-year-old naturalized U.S. Citizen. He has an employment offer
from  a  U.S.  defense  contractor  that  is  conditioned  upon  his  being  granted  security
clearance eligibility.  He  anticipates that  if  he begins  working  for this  contractor, he  will
be living and working in Iraq. He was born in Iraq to Iraqi parents. He has a bachelor’s
degree from an Iraqi university. Applicant first came to the U.S in 2013 as a refugee. He
became  a  naturalized  U.S.  citizen  in  November  2018.  He  holds  both  U.S.  and  Iraqi
citizenships. He has never married and has no children. (Tr. 24-25, 28-30, 34; GE 1-3)
Applicant’s  mother   (SOR   ¶   1.a),  sister   (SOR   ¶   1.b),   brother   (SOR   ¶   1.c),   and

home   on   real  property  in  Iraq   that  is  still   titled   in  his  father’s  name.  This  property  is
valued   at  about  $600,000.  Applicant  shares   an   inheritance   right  among   his  other
siblings  in   the   parcel   of  land   valued  at  $600,000   (SOR   ¶   1.e).   He   also  holds a   similar
inheritance  right in  the  parcel of  land  owned  by his mother.  In  about May 2022,  he told
an  Army  investigator that he  did not want to  renounce  his Iraqi citizenship because  he
wanted   to   protect his potential ownership   rights  in the   real property   in  Iraq   titled   in  his
father’s  name   (SOR   ¶   2.a).   However,   he   testified   at  hearing   if   he   was   forced   to
renounce one of his citizenships,  he  would  renounce his Iraqi citizenship.  (Tr. 24-25, 38-

In HE 1, the Government included information from the U.S. Department of State
as of March 2023, about the United States' relations with Iraq and the current conditions
in  that  country.  I  take  administrative  notice  of  the  information  included  in  those
documents including, but not limited to:
The U.S. Department of State has assessed Iraq as being a high threat, “Level 4:
Do  not  travel”  location  due  to  terrorism,  kidnapping,  armed  conflict,  civil  unrest,  and
limited ability to assist U.S. citizens in country. U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high risk for
violence  and  kidnapping.  Terrorist  and  insurgent  groups  regularly  attack  both  Iraqi
security  forces  and  civilians.  Anti-U.S.  sectarian  militias  threaten  U.S.  citizens  and
Western companies throughout Iraq. Attacks using improvised explosive devices (IEDs)
occur in many areas of the country, including Baghdad. Demonstrations, protests, and
strikes  occur  frequently.  These  events  can  develop  quickly  without  prior  notification,
often  interrupting  traffic,  transportation,  and  other  services;  such  events  have  the
potential to turn violent.
The   country   experienced   large-scale  protests  in  Baghdad   and   several  Shia-
majority  provinces  beginning   in  2019   and   lasting   through   2022,  with   reports  of  more
than 500 civilians killed and 20,000 or more injured. Another, similar incident in August
2022 resulted in more than 20 deaths. The government took minimal steps to bring to
justice those responsible for the violence.
Terrorist groups  and  those  inspired  by such  organizations are  intent  on  attacking
U.S.  citizens abroad.  Primary  terrorist  threats  within   Iraq   included  Islamic State   in Iraq
and   Syria   (ISIS)  and   Iran-aligned   militia  groups.  ISIS   is  a   designated   terrorist
organization,  which  is active  in  Syria  and  near the  Iraq  border.   ISIS  and  its  associated
terrorist  groups  indiscriminately   commit   attacks  and   violent   atrocities  in   Iraq   despite
improved  Iraqi government control. ISIS, militia groups, and  criminal gangs target  U.S.
citizens for attacks and hostage-taking.
There  have  been  significant  human  rights  issues  in  Iraq,  including:  credible
reports of unlawful or arbitrary  killings;  extrajudicial killings and forced disappearances
by  the  government;  torture  and  cruel,  inhumane,  and  degrading  treatment  by  the
government; and arbitrary arrest and detention.

"In  her  answer to  the  SOR, Applicant admitted  ¶¶  1.a-1.d,  and  denied  ¶¶  1.e  and
2.a  with  explanations. Her admissions  are  incorporated  into  the  findings of  fact. After a
thorough  and  careful review of the  evidence  submitted,  I  make  the  following  additional
findings of fact.
Applicant  is  34   years  old.   She   was  born  and   raised   in  Pakistan   and   completed
some  college  courses.  In  2007, through  her family’s arrangement,  she  met and  married
her  husband,   a   dual  Pakistan   and   American   citizen   residing   in   the   United   States.   In
2009, based  on  her husband’s visa petition, she  entered  the  United  States. In  January
2018,  she   naturalized   as  a   U.S.  citizen.   Applicant  and   her husband   have   two   children
who are seven and  nine  years old  and  are U.S. citizens. (GX 1-2; Tr. 20-23)
From about September 2009 through August 2019, Applicant was a homemaker.
In  September  2019,  she  obtained  employment  as  a  software  tester.  She  has  been
employed  full-time  with  her  sponsoring  employer  as  an  automation  testing  engineer
since  September  2021.  She  has  not  previously  held  a  security  clearance.  (GX  1-2;
AX N; Tr. 8)
Applicant’s husband  works as a software engineer. He emigrated from Pakistan
to  the  United  States  when  he  was  16  years  old.  Applicant’s  father-in-law,  now
deceased, previously worked for the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan and brought his family to
the  United  States  in  his  retirement.  Applicant’s  mother-in-law  lives  part-time  with
Applicant’s family. (GX 1-2; Tr. 20-21, 73, 103-104)
Applicant is the oldest of four sisters. One of her sisters is a citizen and resident
of  the  United  States.  This  sister  is  married,  has  one  child  and  lives  within  driving
distance of Applicant. Her other two sisters remain in Pakistan. (See discussion below)
(GX 1-2; Tr. 72-73)
The  SOR  alleges  various  foreign  influence  concerns  under  Guideline  B  and
foreign  preference  concerns  under  Guideline  C.  The  evidence  pertaining  to  the
allegations is summarized below.
SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 1.b  allege security concerns relating to  Applicant’s mother and
father  who  are  citizens  and  residents  of  Pakistan.  Applicant  detailed  that  her  mother
previously worked as a tailor and her father previously worked as a chef.  Both are now
retired. Applicant last saw them in person in 2020 when she traveled to Pakistan  for a
month  to  help  care  for  her  mother  who  was  receiving  cancer  treatment.  Her  mother’s
condition improved, but she continues to take medication. Applicant communicates with
her mother  and  father several times  per week.  She  provided  about  $5,000  in  financial
support to them in 2003. (GX 1-2; AX H-I; Tr. 25, 28-37, 65-66)
In  about  May  2021,  Applicant  petitioned  for  her  parents  to  receive  immigrant
visas  to  the  Unites  States.  They  have  never  visited  the  United  States.  However,
Applicant testified that, since both of her sisters in Pakistan are now married and living
with their new respective families, she was intending to assume the care of her parents
in their elderly years. Also, by bringing her parents  to the United States, she would no
longer have a need to travel to Pakistan. As of the date of the hearing, the immigration
petitions for her parents had been approved. However, her parents were still required to
participate in visa interviews. Applicant was hopeful that her parents would complete the
immigration process and move to the United States sometime in 2024. (GX 2; AX D-F,
R; Tr. 27, 70-80)
SOR  ¶  1.c  alleges  security  concerns  relating  to  Applicant’s  two  sisters  who  are
citizens and residents of Pakistan. They both are married, with one wedding occurring in
2023. Neither they nor their husbands work for the Pakistani government. Applicant did
not  travel  to  Pakistan  to  attend  the  ceremony  because  she  was  concerned  it  would
impact  her  security  application.  Instead,  Applicant  estimated  that  she  provided  about
$2,000 to $3,000 in gifts. She does not regularly provide financial support to her sisters.
She communicates with her sisters every few weeks. (GX 1-2; AX J-K; Tr. 25-26, 37-46,
66-67)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges security concerns relating to Applicant’s uncle who is a citizen
and  resident  of  Pakistan  and  previously  worked  as  a  clerk  for  a  Pakistan  government
council.  He  is  now  retired.  During  her  background  interview,  Applicant  stated  that  she
was  aware  that  her  uncle  worked  in  the  public  sector,  but  could  not  provide  any
additional information. She then asked her parents for details and learned that her uncle
worked  in  a  science  and  technology  field.  Neither  Applicant  nor  her  parents  have  a
close  relationship  or  maintain  regular  communications  with  her  uncle.  (GX  2;  AX  L;
Tr. 46-51)
SOR  ¶¶  1.e  and  2.a  allege  foreign  influence  and  foreign  preference  security
concerns  arising  from  statements  Applicant  made  during  her  November  2019
background  interview.  During  the  interview,  Applicant  was  asked  several  questions
regarding  her  Pakistani  citizenship  and  loyalties  to  Pakistan  compared  to  the  United
States.  In  response  to  questioning,  Applicant  stated  that  she  would  rather give  up  her
job  than  give  up  her  Pakistani  citizenship.  She  further  described  having  loyalty  to  the
United  States  and  to  her  family,  but  stated  she  would  not  participate  in  actions  that
negatively  impacted  Pakistan.  In  an  October  2022  interrogatory  response,  Applicant
indicated that the interview summary was accurate. She did not provide any clarification
of her interview statements at that time. (GX 2)
Applicant  testified  that  during  the  background  interview,  she  was  still  struggling
with English language proficiency. She claimed that she misunderstood the meaning of
some of the questions that were asked during her interview. She clarified that she was
willing to renounce her Pakistani citizenship if necessary and that she was  loyal to the
United  States.  She  acknowledged  that  her  work  would  be  to  the  benefit  of  the  United
States over other countries including Pakistan. (AX G; Tr. 22-24, 52-59, 71)
Applicant  currently  earns  about  $120,000  annually.  A  recent  employment
evaluation  noted  that  she  performed  above  expectations  and  maintained  compliance
with  all  of  her  employer’s  policies  and  procedures.  She  and  her  husband  own  their
home  and  they  do  not  have  any  investments  in  Pakistan.  She  testified  that  she  is
committed to raising her family in the United States. (AX M-N, S; Tr. 58-61, 72, 82, 107)
Multiple  individuals  testified  about  Applicant’s  strong  commitment  to  her  family,
work  and  community.  Her  husband  testified  that  over  the  years  she  has  worked  to
increase  her  language  capacity  and  is  a  responsible  citizen  of  the  United  States.
(AX O-P; Tr. 87-91, 100-102, 112-113)
The  Islamic Republic  of Pakistan
The  separation  in  1947  of  British  India  into  the  Muslim  state  of  Pakistan  (with
West and East sections) and largely Hindu India was never satisfactorily resolved; India
and  Pakistan  fought  two  wars  and  a  limited  conflict  (in  1947-48,  1965,  and  1999
respectively) over the disputed Kashmir territory. A third war between these countries in
1971 - in which India assisted an indigenous movement reacting to the marginalization
of  Bengalis  in  Pakistani  politics  - resulted  in  East  Pakistan  becoming  the  separate
nation of Bangladesh.
The  Department  of  State  travel  advisory  for  Pakistan  is  Level  3:  Reconsider
Travel  due  to  Terrorism.  Terrorism  and  ongoing  violence  by  extremist  elements  have
led  to  indiscriminate  attacks  on  civilians,  as  well  as  local  military  and  police  targets.
Significant  human  rights  issues  remain  in  Pakistan  including  unlawful  or  arbitrary
killings;  forced  disappearance  by  the  government  or  its  agents;  torture  and  cases  of
cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment by the government or its agents,
as well as serious restrictions on free expression and media. Additionally, there is a lack
of  government  accountability,  and  abuses,  including  corruption  and  misconduct  by
security  services,  often  went  unpunished,  fostering  a  culture  of  impunity  among
perpetrators.
