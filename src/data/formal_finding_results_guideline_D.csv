"Under  Guideline  D,  the  Government  alleged  that  in  November  2001,  Applicant
committed an indecent sexual act with his three-year-old daughter; and that in February
2005, he pleaded guilty a charge of indecency with a child, a second-degree felony (SOR
1.a)  Under Guideline J  (SOR  2.a) and  Guideline  E  (SOR 3.a),  the  Government  cross-
alleged  the  information  in  SOR  1.a  as  disqualifying  criminal  conduct  and  personal
conduct, respectively.
Under Guideline E, the Government also alleged that in January 2017, Applicant
intentionally made a false official statement to the Government during a personal subject
interview with an investigator about Applicant’s intent during the November 2001 incident
addressed in SOR 1.a (SOR 3.b).
Under  Guideline  F,  the  Government  alleged  that  Applicant  is  indebted  to  the
federal government for unpaid taxes for the 2004 (SOR 4.a), 2006 (SOR 4.b), 2007 (SOR
4.c),  and  2011  (SOR  4.d)  tax  years  totaling  $114,985.  At  the  hearing,  Department
Counsel moved to withdraw SOR 4.d and it was stricken. As a result, the total amount of
tax debt at issue in this case was reduced to $58,141. (Tr. 10)
In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted with explanations SOR 1.a, 2.a, and
3.a. He denied with explanation any intent to falsify or mislead as alleged in SOR 3.b. As
to Guideline F, Applicant admitted with explanations SOR 4.b and 4.c, and denied SOR
4.a. In addition to the facts established by Applicant’s admissions, I make the following
findings of fact.
Applicant is 49 years old and employed as a project and logistics manager by a
defense  contractor for whom  he  has  worked  since  January  2016.  Applicant  served  on
active duty in the United States Army between 1991 and 1995. He was trained as a medic
in the Army and continued to work as an emergency medical technician and paramedic
after  leaving  the  military.  From  September  2003  until  October  2004,  Applicant  worked
overseas as a paramedic for a defense contractor. (GX 1; Tr. 51 – 54)
Applicant has been married twice. He and his first wife were married between 1992
and 1997. Applicant remarried in 1998 and had two children, a son, now age 16, and a
daughter, now age 21. Applicant and his second wife separated in 2005 and divorced in
2007;  however,  in  March  2010,  they  moved  in  together  for  financial  and  parenting
reasons. By the terms of their divorce, Applicant has principal custody of their 16-year-
old son. This arrangement appears to have been beneficial for all concerned. (GX 1; GX
5; Tr. 41)
In Section 26 of his e-QIP, Applicant disclosed that his income tax refunds for the
preceding six years were applied to an $8,000 debt for unpaid taxes from 2009. During
the  ensuing  background  investigation,  investigators  identified  an  unsatisfied  tax  lien
against Applicant for the 2011 tax year. During a January 2017 subject interview with a
government  investigator,  Applicant  stated  he  had  no  knowledge  of  that  2011  tax  lien;
however, he confirmed his non-payment of his 2009 federal income taxes, explaining that
his  employer  did  not  withhold  his  taxes  as  he  had  expected  while  Applicant  worked
overseas. In November 2018, in response to interrogatories from DOD adjudicators and
in response to the SOR, Applicant provided information that showed he owes $16,062.98
in unpaid taxes for 2006, and $9,778.02 for unpaid taxes in 2007, as alleged in SOR 4.b
and 4.c, respectively. (Answer; GX 1; GX 4; GX 5; Tr. 47 – 51, 56 – 58)
Applicant also has denied that he owes $32,301 in unpaid taxes for the 2004 tax
year as alleged at SOR 4.a. However, in his November 2018 response to interrogatories,
he provided a May 2018 letter from the IRS showing he owed that amount for the 2004
tax year after his $283 tax refund for 2017 was applied. At his hearing, Applicant averred
he visited an IRS office in his state and was told that he did not owe any past-due taxes
for 2004. Applicant did not provide any support for that claim and his explanations for not
being able to corroborate his claims in this regard were not plausible. As to all of his past-
due  taxes,  apart from diversion  of  his income  tax  refunds by  the  IRS  to  satisfy  his  tax
debts, Applicant has not taken any identifiable action to arrange for repayment or other
resolution of this matter. (Answer; GX 4; Tr. 31, 42 – 47)
The matters alleged in SOR 1.a, 2.a, 3.a and 3.b arise from a single event. On or
about November 1, 2001, Applicant was home with his then-three-year-old daughter. The
child came into the bathroom and saw Applicant as he was coming out of the shower.
Rather than cover himself, Applicant had his daughter touch and rub his penis for sexual
gratification. In October 2003, Applicant’s wife was expecting their younger child, whom
they  knew  was  a  boy.  At  some  point,  his  wife  found  herself  explaining  this  physical
differences  between  boys  and  girls.  Applicant’s  daughter, who  was  then  six  years old,
told her mother she already knew  what a penis was because she had seen her father
without  clothes  on.  The  child  went  on  to  describe  for  her  mother  what  had  transpired
between  Applicant  and  his daughter in  2001.  Applicant’s  wife  called  the  police  and an
investigation began that culminated in May 2004 with a grand jury indictment of Applicant
on a charge of indecency with a child, a felony. Applicant was arrested in October 2004
when he returned from his job overseas. In February 2005, Applicant pleaded guilty to
that charge and given a suspended adjudication of guilt for five years, during which he
was  under  supervised  probation,  required  to  undergo  counseling,  and  ordered  to
complete 250 hours of community service. Between February 2005 and February 2010,
Applicant  was  prohibited  from  having  any  contact  with  his  children  or  with  any  person
under  age  17.  After  he  successfully  completed  probation,  the  felony  charge  was
dismissed; however, Applicant then had to register as a sex offender in State A where he
lived and where the offense occurred. In 2010, he moved to State B, where he still lives
and works, and registered as a sex offender there as well. His status as a registered sex
offender is to remain for 30 years, or until March 2040. Applicant acknowledged that he
is embarrassed  by  his conduct  but avers that  he  does not  try  to  hide  what  he  did.  He
testified that some of his neighbors know he is a registered sex offender either because
he  told  them  or  they  learned  of  it  through  online  public  information.  Applicant  is  now
eligible to petition State B for removal from the registry for sex offenders because he has
lived and worked in State B without incident or violation for at least 10 years. As of the
hearing, he had not yet filed a petition for removal. (Answer; GX 1; GX 2; GX 3; GX 5; Tr.
14, 30 – 31, 39 – 41)
During  his  January  2017  subject  interview  with  a  government  investigator,
Applicant discussed his conduct with his daughter. SOR 3.b alleges that he deliberately
withheld information from the investigator in an attempt to mislead the government about
his  conduct.  Specifically,  it  was  alleged  that  Applicant  “lied  .  .  .  .  by  stating  that  [he]
inadvertently exposed [himself] to [his] daughter, while, in truth, [he] deliberately had [his]
daughter touch [his] genitals.” The summary of interview states, in relevant part, only that
“[Applicant] exposed self to daughter.” It then goes on to recount what happened after
Applicant’s conduct became known to his wife and he was convicted of indecency with a
child. The summary of the January 2017 interview does not reflect any discussion of his
intent  at  the  time  of  his  misconduct.  In  short,  there  is  no  basis  for  the  Government’s
allegation  that  Applicant  intended  to  make  a  false  statement  or  representation  about
anything material to an examination of his sexual behavior with daughter. (GX 5; Tr. 60)
During Applicant’s probation, he complied with all of the court-ordered conditions
of his sentence. He paid all fines and costs, completed his community service, and he
has  not  violated  any  laws  or  ordinances  since  his  conviction.  He  also  received  court-
ordered sex offender counseling during which he examined not only his own conduct, but
factors that may have contributed to it. Prominent among those factors was Applicant’s
own  experience  as  a  victim  of  sexual  molestation.  Applicant  has  not  sought  or  been
referred for any additional counseling or treatment since 2010. Applicant also avers that
he  now  has  a  good  relationship  with  his  daughter.  Additionally,  Applicant  has  a  good
reputation for reliability with his current employer. (AX A; Tr. 31, 38 – 39, 55 – 56, 63)
",True
"In Applicant’s SOR response, he made admissions related to SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 2.a.
(HE 3) He also provided extenuating and mitigating information. Applicant’s admissions
are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings of fact follow.
Applicant is a 58-year-old senior engineer, who has been employed by his current
employer for 19 years. (Tr. 18-19, 32; GE 1) He held a security clearance with access to
sensitive compartmented information (SCI) from 1986 to 2017. (Tr. 19, 35-36) He believes
that if his security clearance is reinstated he will be able to assist with problem-solving in
the  intelligence  community.  (Tr.  33) He  will be able  to make  important  contributions  to
national security. (Tr. 33) He has been married for 29 years. (Tr. 28, 67) He has three
children. (Tr. 35; GE 1)
In 1985, Applicant received a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering. (Tr. 18;
GE  1)  He  received  one  master’s  degree  in  electrical  engineering  and  computer
engineering, and a second master’s degree in networks and computer security. (Tr. 18;
GE 1)
Sexual Behavior and Personal Conduct
SOR  ¶¶  1.a  and  2.a  allege  from  about  2012  to  2014,  while  granted  access  to
classified  information,  Applicant  solicited  prostitutes  about  six  times.  Applicant  said  he
solicited prostitutes five or six times. (Tr. 20)
Applicant had a lengthy career performing numerous high-risk missions acting in
a covert capacity on behalf of a non-DOD agency, which will be referred to as another
government agency (AGA). (Tr. 22) While on close-contact sensitive classified missions
outside the United States on behalf of an AGA, Applicant befriended and deceived foreign
nationals and U.S. citizens. (Tr. 21, 23; AE A at 5) He was successful at exploiting others
in support of the mission. (Tr. 21) Applicant believed he was not psychologically equipped
or trained for such missions. (Tr. 21) He was psychologically “over his head” because of
the circumstances of the missions. (Tr. 57) He was taking AndroGel, a medication which
increased his libido and aggressiveness, and he believed, AndroGel adversely affected
or  contributed  to  his  decisions  to  seek  sexual  release  from  prostitutes.  (Tr. 23-25,  57)
AndroGel was part of his high-dosage testosterone therapy and was prescribed by his
physician. (Tr. 70; AE A at 5) His dose of AndroGel was reduced by half after his last
involvement with a prostitute in 2014. (Tr. 26) His medication does not currently affect his
judgment. (Tr. 35)
From 2012 to 2014, Applicant held a security clearance with access to  SCI. (Tr.
35-36) Applicant engaged in sexual intercourse with the prostitutes while he was on solo
missions without proper psychological support. (Tr. 24-25) He was “embedding himself
into organizations and getting to know people and deceiving them.” (Tr. 39)  He did not
have anyone on his team to address his concerns and issues. (Tr. 24) He described his
behavior with prostitutes as a “catastrophic personal failure” and as “totally unacceptable.”
(Tr. 24-25, 33, 58) He did not engage in sexual activity with prostitutes before 2012 or
after 2014. (Tr. 26, 34, 57)
The prostitutes in the foreign country worked in licensed bordellos, and Applicant’s
engaging in sex with them for money was not a crime. (Tr. 25) He did not consume alcohol
before going to the bordellos. (Tr. 52) He went to different bordellos sometimes in different
cities. (Tr. 48, 51) The AGA knew what city Applicant was located in; however, the AGA
did not know when he went to a bordello. (Tr. 49) Applicant paid the prostitutes with cash,
and the prostitutes did not know his name. (Tr. 25, 44-45, 55-56) He believed he paid
about  $100  each  time.  (Tr.  54-55)  He  did  not  bring  identification  documents  to  the
bordello. (Tr. 53) He engaged in sexual intercourse with the prostitutes in the bordello,
and he used a condom. (Tr. 47, 50, 55, 78) He assumed the women in the bordello were
old  enough  to  be  legally  authorized  to  engage  in  such  conduct  in  the  foreign  country
where he engaged in sex with them. (Tr. 77) He suggested that the bordello would not be
licensed by the foreign government without ensuring the women engaging in sex were
not  minors.  He  did  not  know  the  nationality  of  the  prostitutes.  (Tr.  46,  49,  53-54)  He
described the sex with the prostitutes as “the release to keep myself sane” and to maintain
his “balance.” (Tr. 58, 69, 78)
When  Applicant  was  on  an  overseas  mission,  he  maintained  security.  He
conceded his conduct with prostitutes while on a mission was “extremely risky.” (Tr. 51)
He denied that he engaged in any conversation with the prostitutes. (Tr. 48, 50) He said:
I talk to no one. There’s no reason to talk to anyone. Everyone’s a threat.
Any conversation with anyone – in the plane on the street – it all represents
a threat. There’s no reason to talk to anybody about anything. I mean, when
I was doing these things, I was completely isolated socially, other than the
people that I was deceiving -- (Tr. 47-48)
*  *  *
Again, for each one  of  these  missions,  it  was  isolation.  Again, everyone
represents  a  threat.  Every  person.  It’s  just  the  shopkeeper.  There’s  no
sense  in  engaging  in  conversations  with  anyone.  You  engage  in  a
conversation  with  someone  normally,  and  then  all  of  a  sudden  it’s,  well,
why are you here? And then, what are you doing? Or, what’s the nature of
your  business?  And  there’s  no  good  that  comes  from  any  of  those
conversations. (Tr. 50)
Applicant conceded, “I admit fully, without reservation, that I put myself at risk, I put the
mission  at  risk,  and  it  was  wrong.”  (Tr.  62)  His  missions  on  behalf  of  the  AGA  were
successfully accomplished notwithstanding Applicant’s involvement with prostitutes. (Tr.
21, 25, 35, 75)
Applicant was supposed to report to the AGA occasions when he was stopped or
detained going to or exiting a place or any problems. (Tr. 60) He disclosed operational
errors  because  they  put  the  mission  and  lives  at  risk.  (Tr.  79)  The  first  time  Applicant
disclosed  his  involvement  with  prostitutes  was  in  May  2017  before  he  took  an  AGA
polygraph  test.  (Tr. 36-37,  79; GE 4;  GE  5) He  believes  he  passed  the  polygraph  test
administered after his disclosures about his involvement with prostitutes. (Tr. 80) He said
he did not disclose his involvement with prostitutes before 2017 because at the time of
the conduct he perceived it was not wrong to patronize prostitutes while on a mission,
and from 2014 to 2017, he suppressed the information. (Tr. 37, 61) Patronizing prostitutes
was legal and accepted in that country. (Tr. 63) He said, “I buried stuff that I did, and this
all fell in that same category.” (Tr. 37) He further explained, “I buried it, along with all the
other things that I did to survive.” (Tr. 70) He put the information away, and then he forgot
about  it.  (Tr.  37)  In  June  2017,  AGA  revoked  Applicant’s  SCI  access  because  of  his
involvement with prostitutes from 2012 to 2014. (Tr. 32)  AGI cited the repeated acts of
engaging  in  sex  with  prostitutes  over several years, and  noted  it was  “even  more of a
concern that he was engaging in prostitution in a foreign country while assigned there for
employment with the U.S. Government.” (GE 5 at 3-4) In September 2017, Applicant’s
first appeal of the revocation of his SCI access was denied. (GE 7) In December 2017,
the AGA decision to revoke his SCI access was final. (GE 3)
During Applicant’s involvement with prostitutes, he was unaware of the prohibitions
against  supporting  human  trafficking  through  providing  financial  support  to  entities
engaged in prostitution. (Tr. 41-42) The Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA) of 2000
is a federal law addressing trafficking in persons. The TVPA prohibits trafficking related-
conduct, including patronizing, or soliciting of a person for the purposes of a commercial
sex  act,  in  which  the  commercial  sex  act  is  induced  by  force,  fraud,  or  coercion,  or  in
which the person induced to perform such an act has not attained 18 years of age. See
22 U.S.C. § 7101 et seq. Extraterritorial jurisdiction does not apply to Applicant’s conduct
because  it  occurred  outside  of  the  United  States,  and  the  other  statutory  exceptions
establishing extraterritorial jurisdiction in the TVPA do not apply in this case. See Caroline
A  Fish,  Extraterritorial  Human  Trafficking  Prosecutions:  Eliminating  Zones  of  Impunity
Within the Limits of International Law and Due Process, St. John’s L. Rev. Vol. 91, No. 2,
(Jan. 2018). AGA’s policies against human trafficking from 2012 to 2014 are not part of
the file.
At  the  time  he  engaged  in  solicitation  or  patronization  of  prostitutes  outside  the
United States, Applicant did not know whether the women were coerced or fraudulently
induced  to  engage  in  prostitution  at  the  bordellos.  The  women  could  have  been  from
Russia or other nations of heightened security concern. (Tr. 77) Applicant was not fluent
in the language of the country where the mission occurred, and persons in the bordello
may have realized he was an American. (Tr. 77) The training that he received on human
trafficking was perfunctory “check the box, answer the question,” and it was not sufficient
to  cause  Applicant  to  think  about  the  law  or  prohibitions  against  trafficking  before  he
engaged in sexual intercourse with prostitutes. (Tr. 42)
After  his  security  clearance  was  revoked,  Applicant  received  psychological
counseling for three sessions from an AGA-cleared psychologist. (Tr. 22, 26, 71; AE A at
6) He needed counseling to cope with the years of AGA-authorized lying to complete AGA
missions.  (Tr.  26)  He  decided  that  he  could  not  engage  in  future  missions  involving
deception.  (Tr.  27)  He  accepted  responsibility  for  his  “catastrophic  moral  failure”  and
“catastrophic mistake” relating to his sexual intercourse with prostitutes. (Tr. 27, 35)
Applicant’s spouse has been employed by AGA since 1986, and she is aware his
security clearance was revoked. (Tr. 28, 68, 76) She did not ask, and he did not tell her
the reason his security clearance was revoked. (Tr. 28, 66-67) He did not want anyone
who  is  close  to  him  to  know  about  his  patronization  of  prostitutes  because  he  is
embarrassed  about  his  behavior.  (Tr.  68)  He  conceded  he  has  a  personal  and
professional  interest  in  keeping  his  involvement  with  prostitutes  a  secret.  (Tr.  69)  If
someone attempted to use his involvement with prostitutes to coerce or extort classified
information from him, he would inform security, law enforcement, and his spouse about
his involvement with prostitutes. (Tr. 29; AE A at 6)
In sum, Applicant promised that he would not behave in the manner alleged in the
SOR in the future. (Tr. 34) He will not be exposed to the pressure of using deception and
ingratiating himself with others in a covert role because he will not return to employment
involving  his  covert-intelligence  activity.  (Tr.  34)  He  requested  reinstatement  of  his
security clearance out of a sense of duty and patriotism. (Tr. 34)  He has the skills and
ability to contribute to national security, and he wanted to use those skills to benefit the
United States. (Tr. 34, 75)
Character Evidence
Applicant has more than 30 years of employment in the intelligence sector. (AE A
at 8) In 1996, he received letters of commendation from President Clinton, the Director of
AGA, and the Deputy Director of AGA. (Tr. 31; GE 8 at 2; AE E) He received a citation
for a complex collection operation in 1995, and he was praised for his courage, attention
to detail, and technical expertise in a field operation. (AE A at 8; AE E) In 1997, Applicant
received  a  commendation  from  the  Director  of  AGA.  In  1997  and  1998,  he  received
Certificates of Distinction from AGA. (Tr. 30-31; AE E) He also received some classified
awards. (Tr. 31)
Aside  from  his  activities  with  prostitutes  from  2012  to  2014,  Applicant  had  a
flawless  record.  (Tr.  64,  74)  He  accepted  numerous  missions  which  entailed  a  risk  of
capture and death. (Tr. 64; GE 8 at 2) The circumstances of his life from 2012 to 2014
were  anomalous  and  will  not  recur,  and  he  will  not  be  involved  with  prostitutes  in  the
future.  (Tr.  74-75)  He  never  improperly  disclosed  classified  information.  (Tr.  74)  He
described himself as an honest, trustworthy person, and he noted that he has previously
reported security-related incidents or mistakes. (Tr. 65, 78-79; SOR response) His loyalty
and dedication to the United States are impeccable. (Tr. 65, 78-79)
",False
"In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted all of the SOR allegations. (HE 3) He
also  provided  extenuating  and  mitigating  information.  Applicant’s  admissions  are
accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings of fact follow.
Applicant is a 55-year-old communication system engineer, who was employed by
a DOD contractor from September 2007 to August 2018. (Tr. 6, 23, 25-26; GE 1) He was
recently hired by another DOD contractor. In 1987, he was commissioned in the Air Force.
(Tr. 8) He was deployed to Afghanistan from August 2005 to January 2006. (Tr. 9) His Air
Force specialty was information technology communications. (Tr. 10) In 2007, he retired
from the Air Force as a lieutenant colonel. (Tr. 8, 23) His highest award  was the Joint
Service Commendation Medal. (Tr. 9) He held a security clearance continuously since
1987  when  he  joined  the  Air  Force.  (Tr.  23-24)  In  2013,  he  was  granted  access  to
sensitive compartmented information (SCI). (Tr. 24)
In  1983,  Applicant  graduated  from  high  school,  and  in  1987,  he  received  a
bachelor’s degree with a major in electrical engineering. (Tr. 7; GE 1) In 1994, he received
his first master’s degree in information systems; in 2002, he received his second master’s
degree in military operational art and science; and in 2016, he received his third master’s
degree  in  science  and  religion.  (Tr.  7-8;  GE  1)  In  1998,  he  married  and  his  two  step
children are ages 34 and 38. (Tr. 12)
Sexual Behavior, Use of Information Technology, and Personal Conduct
SOR ¶¶ 2 (use of information technology) and 3 (personal conduct) cross-allege
conduct that is alleged in SOR ¶ 1 (sexual behavior).
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges Applicant received verbal counseling on at least two occasions
for viewing pornographic websites from August 1998 to July 2001. (Tr. 34) On about two
or three occasions,  he  used his government-owned  desktop  computer in  his  Air  Force
office to access pornographic websites for 10 to 15 minutes on each occasion. (Tr. 35-
36, 75; GE 3) It was at the end of the duty day. (Tr. 35) He did not intentionally download
any pornography on his computer. (Tr. 38) He was verbally counseled and told to stop
accessing  pornographic  websites  with  his  government  computer.  (Tr.  38)  The  first
counseling did not seem to be with serious intent. (Tr. 39) “It was given to me with like a
wink” with an instruction to “knock it off.” (Tr. 39) The policy against using a government
computer to access pornography was informal and not well developed at that time. (Tr.
39-40) He acknowledged that his computer had access to sensitive information, and his
actions  could  have  compromised  that  information  technology  system  by  exposing  it  to
viruses and malware. (Tr. 41) At the time he was accessing the pornographic sites, he
was not thinking about the risk to sensitive information. (Tr. 41)
SOR ¶ 1.b alleges Applicant received a letter of reprimand in about October 2004
while serving on active duty for misuse of a government computer. (Tr. 42) He admitted
that he accessed pornographic websites on a government-issued computer. (Tr. 42) The
computer he used was a Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) computer that was in
a break area. (Tr. 32) The MWR computer was for general access to enable Air Force
employees to access their email, and the MWR computer was not assigned to Applicant.
(Tr. 42) He  went  to  two  or three pornographic  websites  over the  course  of one day  in
September 2004. (Tr. 42-43) He did not intentionally download any pornography on the
MWR computer. (Tr. 38) His computer misuse was detected through a computer log that
was  used  to  monitor  the  computer’s  use.  (Tr.  44)  There  was  no  evidence  that  the
pornography  was  downloaded  or  saved  on  the  MWR  computer.  (Tr.  45)  In  2004,  he
viewed  pornography  at  home  on  an  infrequent  basis.  (Tr.  46)  He  received  some
counseling from a licensed counselor to address his pornography issue; however, it was
ineffective. (Tr. 47) The letter of reprimand was for violation of a regulation under Article
92, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). See. e.g., DOD Regulation 5500.7-R, Joint
Ethics Regulation, (Aug. 30, 1993), ¶ 2-301(2)(d). The reprimand adversely affected his
future assignments, and he was not selected for promotion to colonel. (Tr. 73) During his
November  7,  2007,  Office  of  Personnel  Management  personal  subject  interview,
Applicant  said  he  learned  his  lesson  about  misuse  of  government  computers  after  his
reprimand in 2004. (Tr. 49; GE 3)
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleges  Applicant  used  an  employer-owned  computer  to  view
pornographic websites from about January 2018 to about July 2018. He resigned in lieu
of  being  terminated  by  his  employer  for  this  misuse  of  his  employer’s  computer.  He
viewed the pornography in his employer’s building in a conference room. (Tr. 50, 55) He
turned  off  the  virtual  private  network  (VPN)  connection  to  circumvent  or  bypass  his
employer’s  firewall.  (Tr.  59)  Switching  off  the  VPN  enabled  him  to  access  sites  his
employer would normally block. (Tr. 59) He acknowledged that by turning off the VPN he
engaged  in  “unauthorized  manipulation  of  an  information  system.”  (Tr.  59)  He  also
deleted the search logs after he went to the pornographic websites. (Tr. 72)
Applicant  viewed  pornography  once  or  twice  a  month  using  his  employer’s
computer, and he accessed the sites for one or two hours at a time. (Tr. 50; GE 3) He
accessed the sites during lunchtime or when things were slow at the office. (Tr. 51; GE
3) He estimated that he downloaded about 1,000 pictures but no videos, and he deleted
the pictures within 24 hours after downloading them. (Tr. 53-54) His employer did not find
any pornography on the computer he used to access pornographic websites. (Tr. 59) He
said  the  computer  he  misused  did  not  directly  affect  DOD.  (Tr.  30)  His  employer’s
computer did not directly access a DOD network; however, this computer did access his
employer’s  network.  (Tr.  30-31)  His  misuse  of  his  employer’s  computer  violated  his
employer’s policies and procedures. (Tr. 58) He committed multiple infractions because
after he misused his employer’s computer the first time, and nothing happened, he did
not believe his employer was serious about enforcement of prohibitions against accessing
pornography on his employer’s computers. (Tr. 55-57) He resigned from his employment
because he believed it was likely that he would be fired. (Tr. 57)
Applicant received routine annual briefings on security and information systems.
(Tr.  32-33)  Throughout  his  career,  Applicant  was  aware  that  he  was  not  permitted  to
access pornography websites or view pornography using government or his employer’s
computers.  (Tr.  31-32)  He  viewed  pornographic  websites  for  pleasure.  (Tr.  36)  He
became  sexually  aroused;  however,  he  did  not  masturbate  while  viewing  the
pornography. (Tr. 37, 52) He did not view child pornography. (Tr. 38) He conceded that
in  the  past  he  had  a  problem  with  or  addiction  to  pornography.  (Tr.  46-47)  Applicant
infrequently viewed pornography on his home computer from 2004 to 2018. (Tr. 49)
Theoretically,  when  Applicant  downloaded  a  pornographic  picture  onto  his
employer’s computer, that picture might have contained a virus that could be transferred
onto his employer’s network. (Tr. 75-76) The virus could be transferred via his employer’s
network onto a Microsoft Word document or PowerPoint presentation, and in turn, when
these items were sent to the DOD, the virus could be downloaded onto the DOD network.
(Tr. 75-76) Applicant was not thinking about possible penetration of security or creation
of  a  “backdoor”  into the  DOD network when he  was  looking at pornography  or visiting
pornographic websites using his employer’s computer. (Tr. 77)
Applicant reluctantly conceded that in the past he was “addicted” to pornography.
(Tr. 70) His viewing of pornography was a choice, and ultimately, he had the power  or
free will and could choose not to view pornography. (Tr. 70) He said that in the past he
had a compulsion to view pornography, and he “fell into a bondage area.” (Tr. 70)
Applicant met with his pastor on a weekly basis from August 2018 to about March
2019, and less frequently thereafter for counseling to help with his pornography issue.
(Tr. 62-66; SOR response) After July 2018, Applicant viewed pornography on his home
computer  on  only  one  occasion.  (Tr.  61)  He  disclosed  this  viewing  to  his  spouse  and
pastor. (Tr. 61) Occasionally his spouse attended the meetings with his pastor. (Tr. 64)
His  spouse  has  complete  knowledge  of  his  issue  with  pornography.  (Tr.  64)  Applicant
disclosed his misuse of computers involving pornography to security, coworkers, friends,
people  at  church,  and  family.  (Tr.  60,  66;  GE  3)  He  was  not  worried  about  public
disclosure of his past problem with pornography because of his success in his endeavors
to stop viewing pornography. (Tr. 67-68) He expressed his remorse for his involvement
with pornography. (Tr. 83)
Character Evidence
A  GS-15,  who  has  known  Applicant  for  14  years  in  a  professional  capacity,
described  Applicant  as  having  excellent  integrity  and  loyalty.  (SOR  response)  His

",True
"Applicant  denied  the  two  SOR  allegations  (¶¶  1.a  and  2.a)  and  submitted
mitigating  comments.  After  a  thorough  review  of  the  record  evidence,  I  make  the
following findings of fact:
Applicant  is  a  61-year-old  employee  of  a  federal  contractor.  He  enlisted  in  the
Army in 1976, served honorably on active duty for three years, and was discharged as a
sergeant (E-5) in 1979. He held a secret clearance while in the service. He received his
bachelor’s degree in 1986, and completed the equivalent of a master’s degree in 1991.
He married his wife in 1986. They have four children, ages 29, 28, 22, and 20.
Applicant has been working for different  federal contractors since 1986. He has
held a secret-level clearance during most of his employment with federal contractors. In
2014,  he  was  hired  by  his  current  employer  and  security  sponsor,  a  large  federal
contractor. In 2016, Applicant requested an upgrade of his clearance eligibility to work
for  a  federal  Agency.  Based  on  information  he  disclosed  during  a  polygraph-assisted
interview  (GE  4),  the  Agency  denied  his  clearance  upgrade  in  June  2016.  (GE  3)  He
unsuccessfully  appealed  the  denial  twice.  (GE  5,  6,  and  7)  Applicant’s  DOD  secret
clearance  was  not  impacted  by  the  Agency’s  denial  of  his  clearance  upgrade,  and  he
continued working for his federal contractor employer.
In his answers to Section 25 (Investigations and Clearance Record) of this 2017
SCA,  Applicant  disclosed  that  the  Agency  denied  his  clearance  upgrade  in  2016.  The
subsequent  background  investigation  addressed  and  revealed  the  pending  security
concerns.  Under  Guideline  D,  the  SOR  alleged  that  from  2015  to  2016,  Applicant
solicited  prostitutes  on  multiple  occasions  while  possessing  a  clearance,  and  that  his
wife,  family,  and  employer  are  unaware  of  his  behavior.  Under  Guideline  E,  the  SOR
cross-alleged the same questionable behavior.
During  his  2016  interview  with  an  Agency  investigator,  Applicant  was  asked
whether  he  had  any  clandestine  contact  with  any  foreign  nationals.  He  told  the
interviewer  that  in  the  fall  of  2015,  and  six  months  prior  to  the  interview  (December
2015-January 2016), he visited massage parlors where he paid Asian women $40 for a
massage and an additional $80 to manually stimulate his penis to ejaculation. He also
disclosed  that  in  the  summer  of  2015  and  in  March  2016,  he  rented  hotel  rooms  and
had on each occasion an Asian masseuse meet him there. He found the masseuses by
searching web sites in the Internet. He paid the masseuses $130 each for a massage
that include manual stimulation of his penis to ejaculation.
Applicant  stated  that  he  had  other  massages  where  no  masturbation  was
included  before,  and  some  in  between,  the  four  massages  described  above  that
included stimulation of his penis. He has not been to any massage parlors or had any
massages  after  his  June  2016  interview  with  an  Agency  investigator.  The  Agency
denied Applicant’s clearance upgrade because of security concerns under Guidelines J
and E, because he engaged in prostitution, was not candid during the interview, and his
actions  demonstrated  lack  of  judgment,  trustworthiness,  honesty,  and  an  inability  to
abide by laws. (GE 3)
In his two appeals to the Agency’s denial decision, Applicant attempted to “clarify
his testimony and correct discrepancies” by claiming that: 1) none of his encounters with
the  masseuses  were  set  up  with  the  intent  to  participate  in  illegal  or  morally
objectionable  activity;  2)  he  did  not  rent  the  hotel  rooms,  that  was  the  location  from
where the masseuses were working; 3) the fees he paid were for massages, not for sex;
and  4)  he  did  not  believe  he  was  engaging  in  prostitution  because  there  was  no
intercourse  involved.  Applicant  also  argued  that  his  questionable  behavior  was  a
personal  choice  and  a  discrete  interaction  between  two  consenting  adults  and  not
prostitution. He strongly expressed his regret for his misconduct, and promised never to
engage in similar behavior.
In his second appeal, Applicant stated: “. . . in my mind I did not think of what I
did as an act of prostitution since there was no intercourse.  It was a regrettable event
that I only realized was an act of prostitution when I received the initial letter informing
me  of  the  denial  of  the  clearance.”  Applicant  highlighted  his  professional  positions  of
responsibility,  and  his  believe  that  he  has  been  a  key  contributor  to  many  of  the
sensitive and important programs he has worked.
Applicant  considers  himself  to  be  extremely  reliable  and  dependable  as  shown
by his  work attendance,  his  promotions,  and the  positions he has held.  He stated that
he  holds  high  ethical  and  quality  standards  in  his  work.  Applicant  believes  that,  on
balance, when his professional accomplishments and contributions to the United States
are  considered  against  his  questionable  behavior,  his  good  behavior  and
accomplishments  should  outweigh  the  security  concerns.  Applicant  requested  an
opportunity to demonstrate that he has learned from his mistakes, and that he will never
engage in similar criminal behavior again.
At  his  hearing,  Applicant  stated  that  what  he  did  was  unacceptable,  and  wrong
from a moral point of view, but claimed that he did not solicit prostitution. (Tr. 17-18) He
disputed  the  accuracy  of  the  Agency’s  report  of  his  June  2016  polygraph  interview.  In
the report, the interviewer stated that Applicant told him that he paid $40 per massage
and  tipped  $80  for  the  manual  stimulation  of  his  penis,  and  that  Applicant  had  rented
two motel rooms on different occasions to schedule his massages. In his October 2017
interview with a DOD investigator and at his hearing, Applicant claimed that he paid $80
per  massage  and  tipped  $40  on  each  of  the  four  occasions.  He  claimed  that  the
masseuse rented the hotel room, not him.
Applicant repeatedly claimed that he never asked any of the four masseuses for
the  manual  stimulation  of  his  penis.  He  averred  that  he  did  not  go  to  the  massage
parlors  or  schedule  the  massages  with  the  intent  or  purpose  of  being  sexually
stimulated.  He  claimed  he  was  surprised  every  time  they  started  their  “flirty”  behavior
and  manually  stimulated  him,  but  he  allowed  himself  to  become  “a  victim  of  their  flirty
behavior” and did not stop the masseuse. (Tr. 36) He further claimed that his massages’
fees did not include compensation for the stimulation of his penis.
At  his  hearing,  Applicant  stated  that  in  hindsight,  it  had  been  obviously  a  bad
choice - poor judgment on his part to allow himself to be stimulated. (Tr. 49) He averred
that  during  the  last  massage  in  March  2016,  he  specifically  remembered  feeling
uncomfortable about it, because the masseuse asked him whether he was married. (Tr.
34-35) He acknowledged his lack of judgment and expressed guilt and remorse for his
behavior. Applicant testified that at that point he decided never to engage again in the
same behavior. He promised himself never to go back to any massage parlor.
Applicant has not told his wife, or any other person at home or at work, about his
questionable  behavior  with  the  masseuses.  He  explained  that  he  is  embarrassed  to
admit that he was that weak. He stated:
“I see no value in, at this point, all it would do is hurt her. That being said,
if someone were to try to blackmail me and say, I'm going to tell your wife,
it would not put me in a vulnerable position, because, in that case, I would
go to my security officer at work, inform them of what was going on, and I
would work with them to put that to an end.” (Tr. 76-78)
Applicant presented no character testimony. He also presented no evidence that
he has received sexual behavior counseling or treatment.

"Under Guideline D, the SOR alleged that on May 8, 2016, Applicant was arrested
and  charged  with  felony  abduction  with  intent  to  defile;  that  on  August  25,  2016,  he
pleaded guilty to misdemeanor sexual assault, for which he was sentenced to 12 months
of incarceration (four months suspended), placed on probation for two years, and ordered
to  complete  a  psychosexual  evaluation  and  psychoeducational  services  (SOR  1.a).
(FORM, Item 1)
Under Guideline J, the SOR alleged that Applicant was arrested on June 28, 2017,
and  charged  with  violating  the  terms  of  his  probation  after  failing  to  complete
psychoeducational services; that he was found guilty of that charge on July 25, 2017; and
that  he  was  sentenced  to  120  days  in  jail,  110  of  which  were  suspended  (SOR  2.a).
Additionally, the conduct alleged at SOR 1.a was cross-alleged as criminal conduct (SOR
2.b). (FORM, Item 1)
In  response  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted,  with  explanations,  all  of  the
allegations. As to SOR 2.a, while he admitted that allegation, he proffered an affirmative
defense  by  averring  that  he  appealed  his  conviction  and  the  charge  was  dismissed  in
August  2018.  (FORM,  Item  2)  In  addition  to  the  facts  established  through  Applicant’s
admissions, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is a single, 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor for whom he
was worked as senior research engineer since December 2017. He received a bachelor’s
degree in computer science in August 2011 and a master’s degree  in the same field in
August 2015. Between June 2011 and November 2017, Applicant worked in information
technology  (IT)  positions  for  a  nationally-known  defense  contractor  and  for  two  other
smaller  federal  contractors.  He  has  held  a  security  clearance  since  at  least  2011.  His
performance  while  working  for  his  current  employer  has  been  excellent,  and  through
professional  associations,  social  media  and  podcasts,  he  is  active  in  networking,
mentorship,  and  professional  development  of  fellow  engineers  in  his  field.  Applicant  is
also active as a volunteer in various community organizations. (FORM, Items 1 and 2;
FORM Response, AX D – F)
On the evening of May 7, 2016, Applicant was at a bar within walking distance of
his  apartment.  He  went  to  the  bar  after  consuming  between  five  and  seven  alcoholic
beverages. Late in the evening, he encountered a woman who was obviously intoxicated.
The woman, who was an active duty member of the military, initially thought Applicant
was gay and decided to accept his offer to go to his apartment because she wanted to
get away from two other men at the bar who had been trying to pick her up. The woman
accompanied Applicant to his apartment with the understanding that they would just hang
out and talk, and that the woman would sleep it off there. When they arrived, the woman
became apprehensive after seeing a “stripper pole” was installed in the apartment. She
asked where she should sleep and Applicant replied, “In my bed.” She then tried to go to
sleep on the couch, but Applicant later came out of the bedroom wearing only his boxer
shorts and climbed on top of the woman (hereinafter, the victim) and started kissing her.
When she was able to get off the couch, Applicant grabbed her and pushed her to his
bedroom and onto his bed. Several times she tried to get away from him and he would
push her back onto the bed. At one point, Applicant told the victim, “you know what I want
and you’re going to give it to me.” Eventually, through physical force, the victim was able
to get her things and leave the apartment. She was upset and disoriented (she did not
know the building’s street address or Applicant’s apartment number) because of her level
of intoxication, but she was able to get help at another apartment two floors down from
Applicant’s  and  called  the  police  to  report  that  Applicant  had  tried  to  rape  her.  (GX  6;
FORM Response, AX C)
When the police arrived, they met the victim at the apartment two floors down from
Applicant’s  where  the  victim  had  sought  help.  The  police  observed  that  she  was  very
intoxicated. She could not remember precisely which apartment she had been in, so the
officers decided to take her to a common area on another floor and continue interviewing
her there. As an elevator arrived to take the victim and two police officers to that floor,
they encountered Applicant in the elevator and the victim recognized him. The police then
began talking to him, eventually taking the victim and Applicant to Applicant’s apartment,
where  they  continued  speaking  to  the  parties  separately.  Information  gathered  by  the
police  that  evening  included  statements  from  both  Applicant  and  the  victim,  and
photographs of bruises and red marks on the victim consistent with having struggled as
she described, including a scratch on her thigh when Applicant tried to lift up her skirt.
Additionally,  the  police  noted  that  Applicant  gave  conflicting  statements  about  what
happened, changing his version of events when confronted with certain aspects of the
victim’s claims. For example, Applicant could not explain why the sheets on the bed were
messed up. He initially stated that the victim went into the bedroom and sat on the bed,
but that he brought her out to the couch. He also denied he and the victim did anything
on the bed but sit there side by side. Additionally, Applicant knew the victim was highly
intoxicated and stated that intoxicated women, such as the victim, were “easy targets” or
words to that effect, meaning that it was easier to get them to have sex. In response to
the FORM, Applicant averred that he was misunderstood, stating:
What  I  was  trying  to  convey  was  that  I  was  describing  her  as  an  ‘ideal
partner’ – because she was attractive to me and she, from what I gathered,
was interested in me. In fact, to support my belief that she was interested in
me,  [the  victim]  willingly  accompanied  me  to  my  residence.  (FORM
Response, AX C ¶ 10)
Applicant  did  not  address  how  the  victim’s  state  of  intoxication  affected  his
perception that she was genuinely attracted to him or, more importantly, her willingness
to go with him to his apartment. (GX 6; FORM Response, AX C ¶ 10)
Based on all of the information gathered by the police, a warrant  for  Applicant’s
arrest was sworn by the victim. On May 8, 2016, Applicant was taken into custody and
charged with felony abduction with intent to defile. Conviction for that offense in the state
where he was charged carries with it a sentence of at least 20 years in prison. On August
25,  2016,  Applicant  entered  an  Alford  plea  in  response  to  a  reduced  charge  of
misdemeanor sexual battery. He was adjudged guilty and sentenced to 12 months in jail,
with  four  months  of  that  sentence  suspended  for  two  years.  He  also  was  placed  on
supervised probation for two years (expected completion on August 25, 2018) with five
conditions attached: be of good behavior; complete a sex offender evaluation and any
treatment  recommended  therefrom;  complete  250  hours  of  community  service  by
September 2017; have no contact with the victim; and waive his right to appeal. (FORM,
Items 2, 4, and 7)
Applicant  completed  his  community  service  as  required   on  June  28,  2017;
however, his sex  offender evaluation resulted in  a recommendation that he “participate in
psychoeducational  services  for   people  who  have   engaged  in   inappropriate  sexual
behavior.”  On  May   18,  2017,  Applicant  and  his  probation  officer  reviewed  that
recommendation;  however,   Applicant   told  his  probation  officer   that  he  would  not
participate in  those services because the named provider could not provide  a definitive
schedule  for  completion  of  the   psychoeducational  services.   He   further  indicated  he
wanted to get his own service provider for  that part of  his probation.  On May 19, 2017,
the probation officer reported this information to the judge who had sentenced Applicant.
(FORM, Item 7)
As  alleged  at  SOR  2.a,  Applicant  was  charged  with  violating  the  terms  of  his
probation and ordered to show cause why the court should not impose the suspended
portion of his original jail sentence. On July 25, 2017, he appeared in general district court
and pleaded not guilty; however, he was found guilty at a bench trial and sentenced to
120 days in jail. Applicant immediately appealed his conviction to the circuit court, where
he would have the opportunity for a jury trial. On August 3, 2018, after his trial date had
been continued four times, the charges were dismissed. Applicant claims that he never
refused to comply with the terms of his probation. Instead, he claimed to be concerned
about timely completion of the recommended psychosexual education services and still
be  able  to  complete  his  community  service  obligations.  Applicant  claims  he  told  his
probation officer that he was trying to find a suitable service provider other than the one
designated by the probation office, and that he subsequently completed the class. The
probation officer’s letter to the court stated that Applicant was not cooperating with the
probation  officer  as  required.  Neither  party  submitted  any  information  that  shows
Applicant completed the classes recommended in the sexual offender evaluation or when
that may have occurred. (FORM, Items 4 and 7; FORM Response, AX C ¶¶ 17 – 19)
In response to the information presented in support of SOR 1.a and 2.b, Applicant
now denies engaging in the criminal conduct or sexual behavior alleged. He claims he
met the victim outside the bar as he was waiting for a ride to meet friends somewhere
else. After a brief conversation, he claims they decided to walk to his nearby apartment
where things became amorous. Applicant avers he and the victim first sat on the couch
in his living room to make out, then moved without complaint by the victim to his bedroom.
(In his statement to the police, Applicant stated that she went into the bedroom first and
he brought her out to the couch.) Applicant further has responded that, as things became
more sexual on the bed, the victim suddenly “began screaming and flailing about . . .[and
that] she was in a wild rage.” He claims he then helped her find her way out, but that he
also was concerned for her well-being and was on his way downstairs to look for her when
he encountered the victim and the police. (FORM Response, AX C ¶¶ 9 and 10.)
When  Applicant  submitted  his  January  2018  e-QIP,   he  disclosed   his  May  2016
arrest  and  subsequent conviction, indicating that he entered an Alford  plea in  response
to the charge of misdemeanor sexual battery. In  response to the FORM, Applicant  argues,
in  part  because  an  Alford  plea does not specifically acknowledge guilt,  that he did  not
commit the crime for which he was convicted. He  further  argues that  his entry  of an Alford
plea was made solely to avoid the expense  and  risk of  a  trial  on the  original felony charge,
which  he felt he could not win because  of racial  and social biases  he presumed would
impede  his access to a fair trial.  An  Alford  plea is one in which  a defendant pleads guilty
and  accepts the punishment of the court while still  claiming to be innocent of the charges
against him or her.  Defendant entering an Alford  plea acknowledges, and the court must
also  conclude,  that  the  evidence  supports  a  conclusion  of  guilt  beyond  a  reasonable
doubt.  North Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S.  25 (1970).  See  also  ISCR Case 07-03307 at 8,
n. 7  (App.  Bd., Sept.  26, 2008; reversed administrative judge’s conclusion that Applicant’s
Alford plea plus his denials supported a finding that Applicant did not sexually assault his
daughter.  See also, ISCR  Case 15-07009 at 2, n. 2  (App.  Bd., July 25, 2017).
As noted at the outset, Applicant is an accomplished computer engineer and an
excellent employee. He is active in the IT sector as a mentor and is involved in several
professional mutual-support endeavors. In support of his case, he submitted five letters
of  support  and  recommendation,  one  of  which  was  from  Applicant’s  supervisor  for  his
community  service  between  2016  and  2018.  He  observed  Applicant  to  be trustworthy,
reliable, and professional. The author has reviewed the SOR allegations and the FORM
with  its  supporting  documents,  but  he  has  no  firsthand  knowledge  of  the  events
surrounding Applicant’s arrest. Notwithstanding that information, the author recommends
Applicant  for  a  position  of  trust.  (FORM  Response,  AX  M)  The  other  four  letters  were
authored by his parents, brother, and sister. Each is also familiar with the Government’s
information in support of the SOR; however, none of them have any firsthand knowledge
of the events at issue here. They each speak highly of Applicant’s character and provide
examples of his integrity, hard work, and dedication to family. Knowing him as they do,
they  are  convinced  of  his  innocence  and  are  equally  convinced  that  he  was  wrongly
arrested and prosecuted because of systemic racism and the fallout from the #MeToo
Movement that might result in an unfair disadvantage for the accused in cases such as
this. (FORM Response, AX I – L)
For his part, Applicant laments the effects his arrest and prosecution have had on
his personal life, and he says he has learned some lessons from that experience:
The  experience  I  have  endured  has  been  horrific.  One  evening  I  literally
thought a pretty girl was interested in me, and her reciprocal actions made
me think all was okay. Unfortunately, all did not turn out well and my life has
been  in  tatters  since.  Of  course,  there  are  lessons  to  be  learned.  I
articulated  that  one thing  I  should  have  done  was  immediately  contacted
(sic) a lawyer, but that pertains to actions after the fact. What I should not
have done was flirt or otherwise attempt to engage in a relationship with a
female  who  was  inebriated.  This  is  where  I  take  responsibility  for  my
actions. This should not have happened, and now a painful lesson has been
learned. (FORM Response, AX C ¶ 20)

"Applicant admitted the SOR allegations, except SOR 3.a and paragraph 4. He is
a 37-year-old enterprise director engineer employed by a U.S. defense contractor since
August  2017.   He  served  honorably  in  the  U.S.  military  from  June  2000  to  July  2009,
and  in  a  reserve  component  from  August  2009  to  March  2011.  He  had  a  favorable
background  investigation,  with  clearance  issued,  in  September  2009  (GE  2),  and  a
favorable reinvestigation in early 2011 (GE 1). This investigation appears to be due to a
break in service requiring reinvestigation.
In July 1999, and again in November 2010, Applicant was arrested for soliciting
prostitution in undercover operations. He was found guilty of disturbing the peace, and
given minimal sentences involving fines, school attendance, and community service, all
of  which  he  successfully  completed.  His  attorneys  told  him  that  the  charges  would
eventually  be  dismissed.  Applicant  attributed  these  arrests  to  his  experiencing
particularly  stressful  times  in his  life.  In  July 1999,  he  was  avoiding going home  to  an
abusive relationship with his father (Tr. 22). In November 2010, he was going through a
contentious  separation—and  ultimately  divorce—with  his  wife,  as  well  as  trying  to  get
ready to go to college (Tr. 23).
Applicant did not disclose the November 2010 arrest on either his January 2011
(GE 2) or November 2013 (GE 1) clearance applications. He also failed to disclose six
delinquent  debts  on  his  November  2013  clearance  application.  He  admits  the
omissions, but denies any intent to mislead the Government. In each instance, he was
being  pressed  by  his  employer  to  complete  the  applications  quickly  because  of
operational requirements overseas (Tr. 29).
The  SOR  also  alleges,  Government  exhibits  substantiate,  but  Applicant  denies
ten  delinquent  debts  totaling  over  $24,000.  Record  evidence  shows  that  SOR  1.j  is  a
duplicate  of  SOR  1.a,   so  there  are  nine  debts  totaling  nearly  $21,000  at  issue  The
debts comprise a delinquent utility bill (SOR 1.d), two delinquent medical bills (SOR 1.f,
1.g), and six delinquent education loans (SOR 1.a-1.c, 1.e, and 1.h-1.I) .
Applicant  offered  a  number  of  exhibits  to  demonstrate  that  all  the  SOR-alleged
debts  had  been  satisfied,  some  more  efficacious  than  others.  AE  F  shows  that  SOR
This is a different contractor than originally sponsored his November 2013 clearance application.
The account number for SOR 1.j listed in GE 7 matches the account number for SOR 1.a listed in GE 6 in
pertinent part, sufficient to conclude the accounts are the same.
debt 1.d was paid in full in March 2017.  AE G and H show that SOR debts 1.f and 1.g,
respectively,  were  canceled  and  returned  to  the  creditor  with  zero  balances  in
November 2017.  Although these  three debts were not addressed until after Applicant
received the SOR, the amounts involved are minimal, and the security concerns raised
de minimus
However,  the  remaining  education  loans  are  not  so  easily  resolved. AE
D—March 2017 correspondence from the collection agent for the SOR 4.a creditor on
behalf of one of the colleges Applicant attended—reflects that a $4,631.22 balance was
settled  for  an  unspecified  amount.  However,  none  of  the  account  numbers  or  other
identifying  numbers listed in the correspondence match the account numbers listed in
GE 6 or 7, although the delinquent amounts in GE 6 and AE D are similar. Similarly, AE
E  reflects  that  two  defaulted  loans  held  by  the  SOR 4.b and  4.c  creditor were  paid in
March 2017, but contains no identifying numbers (account numbers or balances paid) to
match AE E to the 4.b and 4.c numbers listed in GE 6. Applicant asserts (Tr. 36) that AE
C shows that the education loans at SOR 1.h and 1.I have also been paid as of March
2017. But again, neither account numbers or balances appear to confirm that claim.
Federally  guaranteed  student  loans  are  difficult  to  track  through  credit  reports
because  of  the  way  the  loans  are  issued,  defaulted,  consolidated,  and  rehabilitated,
seldom with the same account numbers attached to the accounts. Education programs
change  names,  further  complicating  deciphering  the  process.  Ultimately,  all  the  loans
are guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Education (DOE). However, there are direct
student loans (made by the DOE) and indirect student loans (made by private lenders
through  DOE  programs).  A  given  loan  may  have  multiple  parties  involved  in  its
management, any or all of whom may report its status to the credit bureaus. Thus, for
example,  Applicant’s  January  2014  credit  report  contains  multiple  entries  from  the
lender  at  SOR  1.e  (and  its  education  loan  arm)  in  current  status  because  the  loans
chronicled were in deferred status at the time and transferred to another holder. It also
shows an account moving into late payment status, and being transferred to the DOE,
where it was ultimately paid. A further example, AE C, is a compendium of documents
purporting to show Applicant’s loan settlement with DOE. Nevertheless, the connection
is  difficult  to  make.   The  documents  show,  without  account  numbers,  six  loans
SOR  debt  1.d—a  utility  bill  incurred  when  a  final  bill  was  not  forwarded  after  Applicant  moved  from  a
residence and closed the account—appears on Applicant’s January 2014 credit report (GE 7) and was first
reported delinquent in March 2013. The reported account numbers on GE 7 and AE F match.
Again, the debts originally appear in GE 7, and the account numbers in GE 7 match the account numbers
in AE G and H.
The first page of the exhibit is the first page of a 3 March 2017 letter from the DOE, regarding an account
number that appears nowhere else in the record, whereby DOE accepts a $9,250 payment as settlement in
full of “defaulted student loan(s) and/or grant overpayment(s).” The next two pages are a 22 July 2014 letter
from the then collection agent for DOE, referencing the same account number, offering to settle Applicant’s
defaulted loans for that amount. The fourth page is a screen shot of an otherwise-unidentified “Federal Student
Aid” web page, which reflects six disbursed loans totaling $18,239 and six disbursed grants totaling $17,097,
as of 19 December 2016. The next 11 pages consist of a National Student Loan Data System printout with
guaranteed  by  DOE,  two  direct,   four  indirect.  The  four  indirect  loans  were  all  to  the
educational  institution  in  AE  A  (which  shows  all  school  charges  paid).  All  four  indirect
loans were made by the same bank alleged as one of the creditors on SOR debt 1.e,
and guaranteed by the same “Guaranty Agency” as the creditor on SOR debts 1.b and
1.c.  The  first two  indirect  loans  totaled  $4,168,  were  serviced  by the  other  creditor  on
SOR debt 1.e, and were listed as defaulted but paid in full effective 1 March 2017.  The
last two indirect loans totaled $5,334, but serviced by a creditor not alleged on the SOR,
and were listed as defaulted but paid in full effective 1 and 2 May 2014 [AE C, K(1)].
Applicant’s  January  2014  credit  report  (GE  7)  shows  SOR  debts  4.e-4.j,  as
alleged,  encompassing  the  education  loans,  with  complete  account  numbers,  at  SOR
4.e  and  4.h-4,j,  with  4.j  being  a  duplicate  of  SOR  4.a,  which  appears  on  Applicant’s
September  2016  credit  report  (GE  6),  with  account  number  as  alleged,  along  with
education  loans  4.b  and  4.c  (account  numbers  as  alleged),  as  well  as  SOR  debt  4.d.
SOR debt 4.e also appears on GE 6 (with an account number matching GE 7) with the
same lender as alleged in the SOR, but a different servicing agent.
Applicant  attributed  his  education  loan  problems  to  his  not  understanding  the
interplay  between  the  school  payments  being  made  through  the  military  tuition
assistance  program,  his  grants,  and  his  education  loans.  He  stated  that  he  did  not
understand that the military tuition assistance did not cover all his education expenses
(Tr.  31-33).  However,  he  acknowledges  getting  dunning  letters  from  the  creditors  at
SOR 1.a-1.c and 1.h-1.I beginning in 2011 (Tr. 31, 36, 51-52). He thought the creditors
did  not  adequately  explain  where  his  military  tuition  assistance  payments  went.  His
credit  reports  (GE  6,  7)  show  that  he  disputed  these  education  loans  with  the  credit
bureaus,  but  no  changes  were  made.  Further,  he  produced  little  in  the  way  of
documentation  showing  his  efforts  to  resolve  the  loans  before  he  received  the  SOR.
Nevertheless,  when  he  received  the  SOR,  he  renewed  his  efforts  to  resolve  his
education loans (Tr. 35, 53-54).
Applicant  documented  no  credit  or  financial  counseling,  and  did  not  submit  a
budget.  He stated  he  had  $8,181  positive  bi-monthly cash  flow  (Tr.  58).  His work  and
character  references  (GE  I,  Answer)  consider  him  honest  and  trustworthy  and
recommend him for his clearance. However, none of them states any knowledge of the
SOR issues.
the detailed, but not necessarily decipherable, status of Applicant’s loans and grants. The grants are not at
issue in the SOR, so I have given no consideration to those entries.
The two direct loans total $8,737, were being serviced directly by the DOE Debt Management and Collections
System (not the creditor alleged at SOR 4.a), and were listed as defaulted but paid in full effective 23 July
2014. The two direct loans  were for the educational institution  in  AE  B, which shows that all Applicant’s
charges at the school have been paid.
AE K(2) shows that on 15 November 2015 the loan balances totaled $5,706.14.

"Applicant  is  a  50-year-old  graduate  of  one  of  the  U.S.  military  academies.  He
honorably  served  in  the  U.S.  military  for  approximately  27  years.  He  is  presently  a
senior account manager. In about 2003, he married a woman with six biological children
from a previous marriage, including three stepdaughters who were then aged 9, 7, and
4. The couple has since added two children of their own.
The eldest of Applicant’s wife’s daughters had a strong bond with her biological
father  and,  starting  early  on,  a  strained  relationship  with  Applicant.  Although  Applicant
did  not  start  a  romance  with  the  mother  until  after  the  mother  had  divorced  her  first
husband, the girl blamed Applicant for the failure of her parents’ marriage. (Tr. 60) She
also did not like that Applicant was a disciplinarian. (Tr. 57). Meanwhile, she was having
difficult times fitting in with the other girls at church and at school, and was often bullied.
(Tr. 59) The child also had the stress or adjusting to Type 1 diabetes, and  trauma that
was the result of a life-threatening car accident a couple of years earlier. (Tr. 59-60) She
was  known  to  suffer  from  depression.  (Tr.  62)  She  wanted  to  go  back  to  her  former
state and life with her natural father.
At  age  14,  amidst  all  these  problems,  this  eldest  daughter  was  sleeping  on  the
ground in a basement bedroom one night. (Tr. 59) She was positioned on the floor next
to her sleeping sister’s bed. Applicant entered to look in on the children. In reaching out
to  assure  she  was  well-covered  and  tucked  in,  his  hand  made  contact  with  her
backside, feeling to her “like a grab over her clothing.” (Tr. 55, 58, 64) The next day, the
girl was brought home from school for being distraught. The girl “blew up” at Applicant,
but did not accuse him of anything. A day later, the mother read a passage in the girl’s
journal mentioning  the  touch.  “By  then,  [the  girl  had]  decided  to  move  [across  country
with her biological father].” (Tr 56) Over time, the daughter’s story has changed multiple
times. (see, e.g., Exs. G10-G13; Ex. 3 at 12-13) She later acknowledged that the touch
“wasn’t a sexual thing.” (Tr. 58)
In 2011, the girl subsequently chose to live with Applicant during college despite
the availability of GI Bill benefits that could have paid for her housing elsewhere. (Tr. 61)
No formal steps regarding this girl’s allegation were ever pursued or instituted. (Tr. 71)
At a recent family funeral, this oldest child “came up, gave [him] a hug . . . even before,
she was not much into that, but she came up and gave [him] a hug.” (Tr. 73) They were
also last known to be exchanging Facebook posts and emails. (Tr. 73)
In  2011,  the  middle  child  of  Applicant’s  three  stepdaughters  traveled  cross
country to stay with her biological father for part of the summer. The girl enjoyed life with
her biological father in a markedly different region, where her now-adult elder sister had
lived since 2009 and where this girl had spent her early years. Also residing in the area
was an aunt and a cousin, who was the girl’s best friend. The aunt had never approved
of Applicant, resented his taking his wife and his wife’s children away from her and the
biological father, and “eventually was convinced to help [the biological father] to get his
children back under his complete care. . . .” (Ex. 9)
The middle girl initially delayed her relocation by not coming home at summer’s
end.  Then,  the  girl  and  the  aunt  disclosed  that  the  child  had  “suppressed  memories”
indicating Applicant had molested her. She told this to her biological father, who was not
on  good  terms  with  Applicant.  (Tr.  54)  It  is  unknown  whether  this  middle  child  had
actually  read  her  elder  sister’s  journal  or  simply  knew  the  circumstances  of  her
departure from Applicant’s home three years earlier. (Tr. 68-69)
There  was  subsequent  concern  about  the  middle  child  returning  to  live  with
Applicant. The girl’s biological father reported his daughter’s “suppressed memories” to
the  local  police.  This  stepdaughter  later  detailed  to  county  sheriff  officials  instances
where Applicant supposedly touched her breasts and genitals in a  manner “essentially
very  strikingly  familiar  to  [her  elder  sister’s]  allegation  from  2009,”  wherein  Applicant
was  to  have  touched  the  sleeping  girl  after moving  her blanket,  then  tucked  her  in  for
the  night.  (Tr.  66)  She  also  suggested  that  her  younger  sister  had  been  similarly
abused. (see, e.g., Ex. 3 at 6; Ex. G(18))
After  an  investigation  and  review,  no  action  was  taken  by  the  police,  but  this
middle child remained with her biological father for the rest of her high school education.
There, “she joined the same choir group, she . . . went to work at the same pizza place,
she did almost everything step by step that [her elder sister] did when she moved. . . .”
(Tr. 67, 69-70) Last seen a year ago, this stepdaughter and Applicant were on speaking
terms during a family visit. (Tr. 73)
The  youngest  stepdaughter  does  not  believe  her  sisters’  versions  of  the  facts
concerning the Applicant. She has consistently defended Applicant since at least 2012.
(Exs. 7-9) She describes him as a committed member of their church, patriotic, patient,
even-tempered,  and  a  loving  father  who  “provides  just  punishments.”  (Ex.  9)  She
describes Applicant and her mother as “loving parents.” (Exs. 7-9) She does not believe
her elder sister’s story, noting that this sibling “would have reacted sooner” if the alleged
incident  had  really  occurred.  (Ex.  G8)  She  noted  that  this  sibling  originally  questioned
whether the incident had ever really happened. (Ex. G8)
The  youngest  stepdaughter  also  noted  that  the  elder  sibling  told  at  least  two
versions  of  what  happened:  “in  one,  my  dear  mother  walked  in;  in  the  other,  I  told
[mother  of  the  incident  along]  with  [my  elder  sister].  Two  stories  hints  that  this  is  a
falsehood.” (Ex. G8; see also Tr. 81-82) As for the former version, she noted “the very
idea  that  my  mother  would  stand  by  and  watch  her  children  be  practically  raped  is
complete rubbish.” (Ex. G8) The elder sister had confided to the youngest girl that she
had actually  wanted to  go  to  be  with  their father because  “she  was  lonely  and  did  not
enjoy  life  in  [their  state],  especially  because  she  left  many  friends  behind  when  [they]
moved . . . . The change was too drastic for her. She also in her diary has written how
she hates flying back and forth every school break; how she wished she had a normal
life  in  a  permanent  home.  I  know  she  didn’t  go  to  [their  biological  father]  for  a  safe
haven.”  (Ex.  G8)  In  the  alternative,  the  youngest  girl  suggests  that,  given  her  eldest
sister’s  track  record  of  having  bad  dreams,  that  such  a  dream  could  have  also  been
used as a basis for manipulation by her cousin or aunt. (Ex. G9)
The  youngest  child  also  related  that  Applicant  often  tucked  the  children  in.
However, after the allegation waged by the elder stepdaughter, he stopped. (Ex.G 8; Tr.
73)  Overall,  she  noted  that  Applicant  always  tried  to  avoid  being  “creepy”  or  an  “evil
stepparent.” (Ex.  G9) This  stepdaughter also  reported  that  the aunt  “often  tried  to  tear
apart [my] family and others. She would tell the kids to lie to the school or officials about
our  parents  [Applicant  and  his  wife].  .  .  .  She  may  hate  my  parents.”  (Ex.  G9)  This
stepdaughter’s support of Applicant is corroborated by her mother, Applicant’s wife. (Ex.
G15)  Today,  the  three  stepdaughters  are  all  adults  living  independently  apart  from
Applicant.
Regarding the incidents allegedly involving the oldest and middle stepdaughters,
a  report  from  military  legal/social  services  was  deemed  in  favor  of  Applicant,  with  the
favorable  testimony  of  the  oldest  and  youngest  girls  found  to  be  substantiated.  There
was  no  referral  to  the  sheriff  or  for  criminal  proceedings.  Although  not  introduced  into
evidence, other documentation reflects that a family advocacy study adopted the stories
by  the  oldest  and  the  middle  girl  and  found  against  Applicant,  finding  their  tales
substantiated.  There  is  no  documentary  evidence  reflecting  a  recommendation  on
criminal  action  was  issued,  although  it  was  noted  that  the  youngest  girl  remained
contentedly in the care of Applicant. The unfavorable conclusion of the family advocacy
program was the basis for the pending allegation in this matter.

"In Applicant’s SOR response, she admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.r and 4.b, and she denied
the  other  SOR  allegations.  She  also  provided  extenuating  and  mitigating  information.
Applicant’s admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Additional findings of fact follow.
Applicant is 42 years old, and a DOD contractor employs her as a management
specialist in Afghanistan. (Tr. 29, 88, 90) She served in the Army from 1996 to 2000, and
she received an honorable discharge. (Tr. 89-90) In 2006, she received an associate’s
degree. (GE 1)
In 1999, Applicant married, and in September 2016, her divorce was final. (Tr. 89)
Her three children are teenagers. (Tr. 89) In August 2014, Applicant filed for divorce. (Tr.
50, 57) She paid “well over $30,000” to her divorce attorney. (Tr. 51) She received security
training in 2012. (AE SR R)
Financial Considerations
While  Applicant  was  deployed  to  Afghanistan,  she  believed  her  husband  was
paying the family bills, and she was unaware of the delinquent SOR debts. (Tr. 52) After
she learned of her delinquent debts, she reduced her expenses, especially her rent. (Tr.
53) She cashed in her 401(k) account to pay her debts. (Tr. 54) She paid all of the SOR
debts; however, she noted the debt in SOR ¶ 1.a for $1,438 is still listed as delinquent on
her current credit report. (Tr. 16, 37, 55) The status and disposition of the debts alleged
on the SOR are as follows:
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges a charged-off debt for $1,438. On June 7, 2018, Applicant paid
the creditor $1,000, and the debt was settled. (AE B; AE SR S) However, on September
1, 2018, Applicant emailed that her credit report had not been updated to reflect resolution
of this debt. (SOR response) I have credited her with resolving this debt.
SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.h, and 1.l allege telecommunications debts placed for collection for
$783, $173, and $783. On May 16, 2018, Applicant paid the SOR ¶ 1.b creditor $783.
(AE C at 1; AE SR D) On May 14, 2018, Applicant paid the debt in SOR ¶ 1.h. (AE SR N;
AE C at 26) The accounts in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.l reflect the same debt. (SOR response)
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges a charged-off debt for $599. On May 18, 2018, the creditor wrote
Applicant’s debt was paid in full as of January 13, 2016. (AE C at 23-24)
SOR ¶ 1.d alleges an account placed for collection for $588. On May 24, 2018, the
creditor wrote that the debt was resolved, and the balance owed was zero. (AE C at 13)
SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, 1.i, 1.j, 1.p, and 1.q allege six delinquent medical debts for $572,
$360, $92, $1,572, $165, and $165. SOR ¶¶ 1.e, 1.f, 1.i, 1.j, 1.p, and 1.q do not allege
specific creditors seeking payment of the medical debts. On May 14, 2018, Applicant paid
a medical collection debt of unspecified amount. (AE SR O; AE C at 12) On May 15, 2018,
Applicant  paid  the  creditor  in  SOR  ¶  1.j  $1,572.  (AE  C  at  7)  The  creditor  provided  an
undated letter stating the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.p and 1.q were paid by insurance. (AE SR
P; AE SR H; AE C at 25) On May 15, 2018, Applicant received an email indicating her 12
medical debts for $1,589, $595, $1,633, $91, $100, $3,145, $339, $83, $190, $190, $85,
and $24, were being paid in full. (AE C at 29-43)
SOR ¶ 1.g alleges a debt placed for collection for $350. On September 1, 2018,
Applicant indicated in an email that the creditor had closed the account and would not
accept payment. (SOR response)
SOR ¶ 1.k alleges an account placed for collection for $1,255. On May 14, 2018,
Applicant paid $1,255 to the creditor. (AE C at 28; AE SR C)
SOR ¶ 1.m alleges an account placed for collection for $539. On May 24, 2018,
the creditor wrote that Applicant’s debt was resolved, and the balance owed was zero.
(AE C at 10)
SOR ¶ 1.n alleges a charged-off debt for $486. On May 24, 2018, the creditor wrote
Applicant’s account was resolved, and the balance owed was zero. (AE SR J)
SOR ¶ 1.o alleges an account placed for collection for $468. On May 24, 2018, the
creditor wrote that Applicant’s debt was resolved, and the balance owed was zero. (AE C
at 8)
SOR ¶ 1.r alleges Applicant’s pay was garnished to address a student loan debt
for $8,777. On May 15, 2018, a student loan creditor wrote a defaulted student loan of
unspecified  amount  was  paid  in  full  in  August  2012.  (AE  C  at  3)  On  June  7,  2018,
Applicant  paid a  student  loan for $2,505.  (AE  C at  6)  On  July  3,  2018,  a  student  loan
creditor  wrote  that five  student  loans of  $5,500, $3,387,  $2,750,  $208,  and  $758  were
paid in full. (AE C at 15-22) On January 7, 2019, three student loans for $3,353, $7,326,
and $5,500 were paid in full. (AE C at 4-5)
Applicant did not include her income of about $5,000 from customers seeking her
time and other personal services on her 2016 federal income tax return. In ISCR Case
No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board listed five circumstances
in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered stating:
(a)  to  assess  an  applicant’s  credibility;  (b)  to  evaluate  an  applicant’s
evidence  of  extenuation,  mitigation,  or  changed  circumstances;  (c)  to
consider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation;
(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is
applicable;  or  (e)  to  provide  evidence  for  whole  person  analysis  under
Directive Section 6.3.

Criminal Conduct, Sexual Behavior, and Personal Conduct
SOR  ¶¶  2.a,  3.a,  and  4.a  allege  that  Applicant  was  cited  in  March  2017  for
prostitution  and  operating  a  business  without  a  city  license.  SOR  ¶  4.b  alleges  and
Applicant admitted that she failed to timely report this citation to her security officer. (SOR
response) Applicant did not report her arrest because her attorney told her not to do so
because “it would implicate [her] in a crime.” (Tr. 76)
In March 2017, the police arrested Applicant at her residence. (Tr. 71) Applicant
said she was not charged with operating a business without a license, and the prostitution
charge was dismissed because of lack of evidence that she engaged in prostitution. (Tr.
75;  SOR  response,  Order  Dismissing  Charge)  After  her  arrest,  she  stopped  seeking
customers on a dating website. (Tr. 78, 81) After her Office of Personnel Management
(OPM) personal subject interview (PSI), she reported the arrest to her security officer. (Tr.
76-77) Applicant’s counsel indicated the prostitution charge was a municipal violation and
not a violation of state law. (Tr. 16-17) In Applicant’s state of residence, prostitution is a
class B misdemeanor, punishable by up to six months in jail and a fine of up to $500.
Under  the  statute  in  Applicant’s  state,  §  567.020,  “A  person  commits  the  offense  of
prostitution if he or she engages in or offers or agrees to engage in sexual conduct with
another person in return for something of value to be received by any person.”
Applicant believed her husband called the police and alleged she was engaged in
prostitution. (Tr. 80; SR) Applicant criticized the credibility of a police officer involved in
the investigation of her prostitution charge. (Tr. 17-19) Her counsel cited a 2015 Eighth
Circuit  decision  that  named  the  police  officer  as  having  omitted  information  from  an
affidavit used to obtain a search warrant. (AE D) The magistrate noted information was
omitted; however, the magistrate concluded that  “the officer did not act intentionally or
recklessly to mislead the issuing judge.” (AE D at 2) The district court judge agreed with
the magistrate. (AE D at 2-3) The Eighth Circuit found the omissions were negligent but
otherwise  agreed  the  omissions  were  not  made  with  deliberate  falsity  or  reckless
disregard, and declined to suppress the product of the search. (AE D at 4, 6) Applicant
also provided a copy of a 2014 deposition of the same police officer relating to an alleged
stalking  incident  the  police  officer  investigated  in  2012.  (AE  D)  Applicant  asserted  the
police officer admitted in the deposition that he made a false statement in his investigation
of the stalking allegation. (Tr. 17-20) Applicant and her former husband were not involved
in the alleged stalking incident. (AE D)
Applicant’s  concerns  about  the  officer’s  credibility  have  low  relevance  because
Applicant  did  not  contest  most  of  the  material  facts  in  the  police  report.  The  only
information  Applicant  challenged  were  the  allegations,  as  summarized  by  the  police
officer,  of  the  two  witnesses  who  said  Applicant  provided  sex  to  them  in exchange for
their  payments  of  the  amounts  specified  on  Applicant’s  Internet  advertisement.  (SOR
Report) Written statements from the two witnesses were not included in the file. The two
witnesses were soldiers at a nearby military base, and Applicant’s counsel said he was
unable to locate them. Applicant’s admissions at her hearing, and the advertisement and
pictures from the website are sufficient to establish the allegation of prostitution under the
substantial evidence standard.
SOR ¶¶ 3.b, 3.c, 3.d, and 4.a allege Applicant engaged in sex with strangers that
she  met  on  websites,  including  a  dating  website  with  a  history  of  being  involved  with
prostitution. Her website posting indicated she charged $80 for 30 minutes and $150 for
60 minutes. At least one man that she met online paid her $80 following sex.
For about one year from 2016 to 2017, Applicant’s semi-nude photographs and
contact information were placed on a dating or escort website. (Tr. 60-63, 68-70; GE 5)
Her time was available for $80 for 30 minutes and $150 for 60 minutes. (Tr. 61-63) She
offered conversation, warmth, massage, dance, and  a special event to her customers.
(Tr.  61-62,  74)  In  April  2018,  the  Department  of  Justice  (DOJ)  issued  a  press  release
indicating the website Applicant was using to solicit customers was seized, as it was “the
dominant marketplace for illicit commercial sex, a place where sex traffickers frequently
advertised children and adults alike.” (Tr. 77; GE 9)
On  March  11,  2017,  the  police  stopped  a  vehicle  that  had  just  left  Applicant’s
residence. (GE 4) The driver was a soldier at a nearby military installation. The driver said
he had just paid Applicant $80 for sex. He said he also paid her $150 for sex on March 8,
2017. (OPM ROI at 17) The police went to Applicant’s residence and asked for the money
the witness paid her, and she provided four $20 bills. Id. Applicant told the police that she
was  not  engaging  in  prostitution.  The  police  interviewed  another  witness  who  was  a
soldier at a nearby military installation, and he said he paid for sex about four times at
Applicant’s residence. Id. (police report) Applicant’s lawyer said he was unable to locate
the two witnesses cited in the police report to challenge their credibility. (Tr. 45-46) When
Applicant  was  questioned  by  the  police,  she  “was  concerned  about  the  charge  of
prostitution as it would affect her security clearance.” (GE 4)
Applicant had difficulty estimating how many people paid her for her time; however,
she estimated “at least see[ing] 40 or more.” (Tr. 64-66) She estimated that she had sex
with about 20 men. (Tr. 66-67) She was vague about how many of them paid after having
sex with her. (Tr. 67-68) Some of the customers may have asked her for drugs; however,
she always refused to give them drugs. (Tr. 88) Applicant did not have anyone to protect
her if the date with her customers became violent. (Tr. 87)
Applicant consistently denied that she engaged in prostitution. (Tr. 43, 47-48) She
denied that there was a direct relationship between the payment of funds and the sexual
activity.  (Tr.  82;  SR;  GE  2)  The  purpose  of  the  semi-nudity  on  her  webpage  was  to
encourage  men  to  call  her  to  go  out  with  her.  (Tr.  70)  After  the  first  date,  some  men
continued their relationships with her and continued to pay her, and some did not pay her.
(Tr.  71,  82)  As  for  whether  she  was  soliciting  prostitution,  Applicant  explained,  in  an
advertisement a girl holding a soda may be wearing a bikini, “but that doesn’t mean she’s
a prostitute.” (Tr. 93) Applicant held a security clearance in the 2016 to 2017 time period
when her webpage advertised her time to customers. (Tr. 75)
Applicant’s  spouse  was  vindictive  towards  her  because  of  her  conduct.  Her
husband placed her pictures on a bad website to damage her reputation. (Tr. 38-42, 61;
SOR  response;  GE  5)  In  2016,  he  called  her  a  prostitute  at  a  basketball  game  their
children were attending. (Tr. 39-40) He threatened to seek her conviction and sentencing
to jail for prostitution. (Tr. 39) He sought an order barring her from seeing her children;
however, the judge denied his motion, and he had to pay her attorney fees. (Tr. 40) Her
husband encouraged the police to investigate Applicant for engaging in prostitution. (Tr.
41)
Applicant conceded that she “presented [herself] in the wrong manner as far as
that  [she]  may  have  been  doing  an  illegal  action.”  (Tr.  80)  At  the  time  Applicant  was
utilizing  the  webpage  to  solicit  customers,  she  had  full-time  employment  and  earned
$53,500 annually. (Tr. 84) In 2016, she made a little more than $5,000 from the website.
(Tr. 85) She did not include the income from the customers on her federal tax return for
tax year 2016. (Tr. 85-86)
Character Evidence
In 2018, Applicant received two promotions and a certificate of appreciation from
her  employer.  (Tr.  50)  She  served  in  Afghanistan  in  2014,  and  she  was  serving  in
Afghanistan at the time of her hearing. (Tr. 48)
Applicant’s program manager has known her since 2000. (Tr. 28-29) He described
her as an excellent employee who is conscientious, reliable, and responsible. (Tr. 30-31)
She did not commit any security or rule violations. (Tr. 36) He supported her for positions
of greater responsibility and a security clearance. (Tr. 32-33)
",False
"Applicant is a 54-year-old reliability engineer who has worked for the same entity
for  nearly  six  years.  He  has  earned  a  bachelor  of  science  degree,  three  master’s
degrees, and a doctorate degree. In the interim, he accepted a commission in the U.S.
Army, where he began with his Army Reserves unit in 1987. He was transferred to the
retired  Army  Reserves  as  a  lieutenant  colonel  after  26  years.  Most  recently,  he
completed seminary school and became a chaplain at the rank of major.
In  2007,  Defense  Criminal  Investigative  Services  (DCIS)  and  Immigration  and
Customs  Enforcement  (ICE)  conducted  a  national  investigation  that  identified  over
5,000  U.S.  individuals,  some  with  DOD  affiliations,  who  subscribed  to  known  child
pornography  websites. In  2007,  Applicant  returned from  a  deployment with  a  compact
disc (CD) of some military orders and sermons. (Tr. 24, 37) He did not realize the orders
were  sensitive  or  otherwise  protected.  (Tr.  41)  Applicant  also  returned  suffering  from
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).
Applicant’s  home  was  searched  as  part  of  the  DCIS  and  CID  national
investigation.  He  admitted  viewing  adult  content  of  a  titillating  nature  on  the  Internet.
Apparently, no images of underage individuals, however, were found and archived that
were noted as pornographic. (Tr. 34-36) The past military orders, however, were found.
Applicant  claimed  that  someone  had  given  him  permission  to  have  the  orders,  but  he
was  unable  to  provide  a  name  or  documentation  reflecting  permission  was  given.  A
written warning for mishandling classified information was issued.
When Applicant came back from his next deployment in 2011, his estranged wife
told him that two deployments was too much for their marriage, and that she wanted a
divorce. (Tr. 22) Their five year marriage would end in divorce in 2013. (Tr. 17-18) After
she moved away, he had difficulty sleeping. As a result, he would spend the nights on
the computer viewing pornography. (Tr. 19)
In  late  2010,  DCIS  and  CID  determined  that  its  previous  investigational  checks
had left several leads insufficiently examined or deficiently investigated. (Ex. 3 at 2) In
June  2011,  Applicant  was  again  investigated  by  DCIS/CID  for  possession  of  child
pornography. This entailed reopening the 2007 investigation, during which time the lab,
which had lost its evidence from 2007, inspected new material. (Tr. 36). Also, a mix-up
of some sort led to a hard drive that did not belong to Applicant being made part of the
investigation.
During the interview, Applicant was asked if he had any unauthorized charges to
his  credit  card.  He  answered  a  charge  had  been  made  for  a  hotel.  When  specifically
asked  about  a  particular  website  he  had  visited,  he  chose  to  end  the  interview  and
consult an attorney. (EX. 3 at 2) His clearance and access were suspended in August
2012.  (Ex.  2)  Later,  four  to  six  images  were  discovered  on  Applicant’s  media,  two
images  were  identified  as  containing  known  child  victims  identified  by  the  National
Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC).2 (Ex. 3 at 3)
In  2012,  Applicant  returned  from  another  deployment.  At  the  conclusion  of  the
investigation,  the  Assistant  U.S.  Attorney’s  office  declined  to  prosecute  due  to
evidentiary  deficiencies  and  statute  of  limits issues.  (Ex.  3)  Local prosecutors  similarly
declined to prosecute the matter.3 However, a Memorandum of Reprimand (MOR) was
issued  to  Applicant  on  January  26,  2013.  He  was  given  15  days  from  receipt  of  the
MOR to respond in rebuttal, extenuation, or mitigation. (Ex. 2) A general officer’s letter
of  reprimand  dated  January  26,  2013,  was  issued, determining  that  child  pornography
and unsecured classified material was found at Applicant’s home. (Ex. 2) This fact was
found  to  be  particularly  “reprehensible”  and  “disturbing”  because  Applicant  is  an  Army
chaplain.  (Ex.  3  at  4)  The  reprimand  became  final  in  April  2013.  Applicant  was
transferred  to  retired  reserve  status  on  May  1,  2013,  with  the  recommendation  his
security clearance be revoked. (Ex. 2)
Applicant disagrees with the assessment of the military that the images at issue
were child pornography. Applicant has viewed the photos, noting that some were nude,
while  others  included  scanty  clothing.  He  testified  that  he  had  never  seen  the  photos
before.  Throughout  the  hearing,  Applicant  stressed  the  models  were  not  engaged  in
sexual activity and, therefore, could not be deemed child pornography, per se. Applicant
repeatedly  acknowledged  that  his  reputation  would  be  harmed  if  the  issues  regarding
sexual behavior became public knowledge.
",False
"Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  SOR  allegations  (¶¶  1.a  and  1.b;  2.a  and  2.b;  and
3.a  through  3.g)  with  mitigating  and  explanatory  comments.  His  SOR  and  hearing
admissions are accepted herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the record
evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:
Applicant  is  a  58-year-old  employee  of  a  federal  contractor.  He  received  his
bachelor’s  degree  in  1984,  and  completed  master’s  degrees  in  1996  and  2009.  He
enlisted  in  the  Navy  in  1978,  and  was  discharged  in  1979  and  placed  in  the  Inactive
Reserve while attending college. He was commissioned as a Navy officer in 1984, and
served honorably until retired as a lieutenant commander in 2002. Applicant married his
wife in 1992. They have a daughter, age 24, and a son, age 22.
Applicant  has  been  working  for  federal  contractors  since  he  left  the  service  in
2002.  He  held a  top-secret  clearance  while  in  the  service.  His  clearance eligibility  has
been  continued  while  employed  with  federal  contractors.  He  seeks  the  continuation  of
his clearance, which is required for his employment with a federal contractor.
In  about  2010,  Applicant  applied  for  a  job  with  another  Government  agency
(Agency) that required him to participate in polygraph-assisted interviews. After a series
of  interviews,  Applicant  disclosed,  in  substance,  all  of  the  facts  alleged  in  the  SOR
allegations:
1. When he was about 13 years old, while babysitting for a friend of the family, he
touched,  and  on  a  second  occasion,  he  penetrated,  a  three-year-old  girl’s  vagina  with
his  finger  while  getting  aroused.  He  was  never  caught,  but  stopped  his  behavior
because he knew that what he was doing was wrong. (SOR ¶ 1.b)
2. Applicant started having uncomfortable feelings about his daughter - a strange
sexual attraction - when she started puberty. He was afraid that he would do something
stupid.  When  his  daughter  and  her  friends  were  about  13  years  old  (in  about  2009),
Applicant  began  sexually  fantasizing  about  his  daughter  and  her  friends  and
masturbated two to three times per month to those fantasies. Applicant denied he ever
touched  his  daughter  or  her  friends  inappropriately  or  that  he  acted  on  his  fantasies
(other than masturbating). (SOR ¶ 1.a)
Applicant  told  the  Agency  investigator  that  he  stopped  his  sexual  fantasies  in
about  May  2011.  (GE  3)  At  his  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  he  stopped  having  the
sexual fantasies after his interview with the last investigator in January 2015. (Tr. 39)
After  his  2010-2011  interviews,  the  Agency  reported  Applicant’s  statements  to
the state’s social services agency who investigated the concern. Applicant’s family was
interviewed, and apparently he was cleared of sexual misconduct.
3. In about 1988, Applicant removed documents from a sensitive compartmented
information facility (SCIF) and took them to his home to study for an exam. Sometime
later,  he  returned  the  documents  to  the  SCIF.  He  also  took  submarine  qualifications
cards (marked confidential) as souvenirs. Applicant averred that at the time he took the
cards,  he  did  not  know  they  were  marked  confidential.  During  a  move  in  1999,  he
discovered they were marked confidential. Applicant did not return or properly dispose
of  the  cards  after  he  discovered  they  were  classified  confidential.  He  maintained
possession of the cards until 2010 when an Agency investigator asked him to surrender
them to him. (SOR ¶¶ 2.a and 2.b)
4.  In  about  2009-2010,  Applicant  took  computer  equipment  home  without
authorization  from  his  federal  contractor  employer.  The  equipment  included,  in  part,  a
server with five drives, eight to ten keyboards, mice, a wireless router, network cables,
three  laptops,  three  docking  stations,  and  cables  for  hard  drives.  Applicant  explained
that  he  was  asked  to  recycle  old  computer  equipment  under  his  control  before  the
company moved to another location. Part of his job was to create mock computer labs
for testing and studies. He did not recycle the equipment and took it home because he
believed he would need it to establish mock computer labs. Applicant did not asked for
authorization  to  take  the  equipment  home.  After  he  participated  in  four  Agency
interviews,  Applicant  returned  the  equipment  to  his  then  employer  to  recycle  it.
Applicant  donated  some  of  the  computer  equipment  he  wrongfully  appropriated  to  his
daughter’s school robotics lab.
5.  SOR  ¶  3.f  alleges  that  Applicant  deliberately  omitted  and  failed  to  disclose
material  information  to  an  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  background
investigator. Applicant participated in an interview with an OPM investigator in January
2015.  During  the  interview,  he  was  asked  whether  he  had  sexual  fantasies  or
masturbation  habits  related  to  minors.  Applicant  admitted  to  having  fantasies  and  that
he  masturbated  to  pornography  of  young  women,  but  specifically  denied  any  sexual
fantasies  or  masturbating  habits  related  to  minors.  Applicant  deliberately  failed  to
disclose  to  the  OPM  investigator  all  the  information  he  disclosed  during  his  four
interviews  with  the  Agency  investigators  about  his  sexual  fantasies  and  masturbation
habits concerning his minor daughter and her friends as set forth in SOR ¶ 1.a.
6.  SOR  ¶  3  g  alleged  that  Applicant  deliberately  omitted  and  failed  to  disclose
material information to an OPM background investigator when he failed to disclose the
true extent of his unauthorized taking of computer equipment from his employer as set
forth in SOR ¶ 3.e. During his 2015 interview, Applicant admitted to, on one occasion,
taking home a computer shell (stripped of parts) except for its power supply. Applicant
deliberately  omitted  and  failed  to  disclose  that  he  had  taken  home,  at  least,  a  server
with  five  drives,  eight  to  ten  keyboards,  mice,  a  wireless  router,  network  cables,  three
laptops, three docking stations, and cables for hard drives.
When  questioned  about  his  omissions  and  failure  to  disclose  the  same
information he disclosed to Agency investigators in 2010-2011, Applicant stated he did
not see the need to disclose the information because he assumed the investigator had
read his statements to Agency investigators in 2010-2011.
",False
"Applicant admitted all allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1 through 3.2 After a thorough and
careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of
fact.
The SOR alleges in (1.a) under Guideline D, a June 2017 arrest and an August
2017  guilty  plea  to  contributing  to  the  delinquency  of  a  minor  and  indecent  exposure.
She  was  sentenced  to  twelve  months  in  jail,  with  eleven  months  suspended  and
ordered  to  pay  fines.  It  cross  alleges  under  Guideline  J,  the  same  information  (2.a).
Under Guideline E, an amended SOR (3.a) alleges written falsifications that occurred in
January  2017  to  Applicant’s  employer  regarding  allegations  about  an  inappropriate
relationship with a minor student; (3.b) falsification of material facts during a May 2017
interview  with an investigator in failing to disclose that she participated in a sexual act
with  a  student;  and  in  another  investigative  interview  in  July  2017,  (3.c)  not  disclosing
that  after  a  minor  student  exposed  himself  to  Applicant  in  a  car,  that  nothing  further
happened when in fact she did touch him and provided oral sex.
Applicant  is  a  32-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  She  is  single  and
has one young child. She received her undergraduate degree in 2008 and her graduate
degree in 2016. (AX C, F, G, I) Applicant taught high school from 2015 to 2017, when
she was fired for alleged workplace misconduct. (GX 1) She has been employed with a
defense contractor for about one year. (Tr. 59)  She has received a number of training
certificates in cyber security and counterintelligence. (AX L)
Applicant tutored a tenth grade male student while teaching in a high school. On
one  occasion,  she  and  the  student  were  in  a  public  library  after  school.  (Tr.  21)  The
student’s ride did not appear and Applicant stated that she would take him to his home.
(Tr.  22)  Applicant  claimed  that  the  student  exposed  himself  while  in  the  car  and  he
demanded oral sex. She acknowledged that she tried to fend him off but he was bigger
than she was. She testified that he tried to force her to give him oral sex. She continued
to refuse but eventually she complied. (Tr. 23)
After an investigation by the school, Applicant received a criminal complaint from
the  police,  and  Applicant  was  charged  with  contributing  to  the  delinquency  of  a  minor
2 Before the hearing the Government amended the SOR to include Personal Conduct. It alleged three
falsifications as noted above.
and indecent exposure for the incident that occurred in May 2016. (GX 3, 4, AX H)  In
August  2017,  Applicant  pled  guilty  to  the  misdemeanor  charges.  She  received
consecutive  sentences  for  the  two  charges.  The  total  sentence  was  24  months.
Applicant was sentenced to twelve months in jail, with eleven months suspended. (AX
H)  Applicant  served  her  incarceration  on  the  weekends.    Applicant  “shall  be  of  good
behavior”  for  a  total  of  six  years  from  the  release  from  confinement.  She  has  not  had
contact with the student since the conviction. (AX H)
Applicant initially denied that the criminal incident occurred when she received a
letter  of  suspension  from  the  school  due  to  sexual  misconduct.  (Tr.  53)  She  told  her
employer  that  it  was  a  rumor  and  was  spread  on  social  media.  On  January  13,  2017
Applicant responded in writing concerning the incident.  She acknowledged that she had
tutored  the  student  and  given  him  a  ride  home.  She  did  not  disclose  any  information
about the incident of oral sex in her car. (GX 3)
During a May 12, 2017 investigative interview, Applicant described the May 2016
incident with the minor student and mentioned a social media post concerning romantic
behavior  between  Applicant  and  a  minor  student.  She  explained  that  she  was  not
involved  with  the  student.  She made  no mention of  the fact  that  she  gave  the  student
oral sex in her car. (GX 2)
On  July  26,  2017,  Applicant  was  again  interviewed  by  a  DOD investigator.  She
stated  that  the  student  exposed  himself  to  her  in  the  front  passenger  seat  of  her  car.
She explained that she told the student that was not appropriate behavior and took him
home.  Applicant further stated that nothing happened, that she did not touch him, and
she did not know why the student made up this story. (GX 2) Applicant did not receive
any counseling after this incident.
When  cross  examined  at  the  hearing,  Applicant  explained  that  she  did  not
provide  the  truth  or  the  entire  story  as  it  happened  because  it  was  humiliating  and
embarrassing. (Tr. 56) During the interviews she never mentioned the oral sex.
Applicant  submitted  five  letters  of  recommendation.  Each  reference  from  a
former employer knew Applicant for at least two years and described her as honest with
a  positive  attitude.  Applicant  has  exceptional  organization  and  communication  skills.
She is reliable and motivated. One letter of recommendation commended Applicant for
her ability to encourage her students and build self-esteem. (AX A)  She attends church
and is a member of her church community. (AX I, K)

"Applicant  is  33  years  old,  unmarried,  and  has  no  children.  He  received  a  high
school diploma in 2004 in Iraq. From 2005 until October 2009, Applicant worked for the
U.S. military in Iraq as a security guard and as a local interpreter on U.S. military missions.
He immigrated to the United States in November 2009 on a special immigrant visa (SVI),
and he was naturalized in November 2015. He is attempting to get a job as a linguist for
a defense contractor. This is his first security clearance application. He has worked as a
truck driver for his current employer since 2006. (GE 1; AE C; Tr. 10, 16-21, 39)
Guideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse
Applicant disclosed in his 2017 SCA that he used marijuana between August 2012
and  February  2016.  In  June  2012,  while  living  in  a  state  in  which  it  was  legal  to  use
medical  marijuana,  Applicant  broke  his  leg.  Two  months  later,  he  obtained  a  medical
marijuana card and started using marijuana as pain relief for the broken leg. He did not
renew the card when it expired in August 2013, but continued to use marijuana once a
month or every other month with friends and by himself for medical and personal reasons.
In his SCA, Applicant disclosed that he used marijuana only three to five times after his
leg healed. He told the government investigator during his May 1, 2017 interview that he
used marijuana one to two times a week for three months in 2012 to help him sleep. (GE
1 at 59; GE 2 at 5; GE 3 at 2; Tr. 22-23, 25-26, 30-33)
In  2014,  Applicant  obtained  a  commercial  driver’s  license  (CDL)  from  the
Department of Transportation (DOT) to be a commercial truck driver. Applicant started
working for Company A as a commercial truck driver in August 2014. This company drug
screened  their  drivers  and  marijuana  use  was  not  permitted.  Applicant  had  a  pre-
employment urinalysis and one random urinalysis before he left Company A in May 2015.
Applicant continued working as a commercial driver for two other companies. For these
employments, he had pre-employment urinalyses tests.
In  February  2016,  Applicant  was  working  as  a  truck  driver  for  a  company  that
prohibited the use of drugs. He acknowledged that he was aware of his employer’s policy
that  employees  remain  drug-free,  and  he  was  subject  to  random  urinalysis  tests.
However, Applicant thought the policy only applied to when he was working, not during
off hours or “private time.” That month, Applicant took a random-work-related urinalysis,
which was positive for marijuana. At the hearing, Applicant testified that the last time he
used marijuana was approximately one week before this positive urinalysis. (GE 1 at 61;
Tr. 23-27)
Later during his testimony, Applicant claimed the positive urinalysis was the result
of exposure to second-hand smoke at a concert or from innocent ingestion. (Tr. 24, 26)
He also made this claim in his Answer to the SOR and in his May 1, 2017 background
interview. He also testified that he did not knowingly use marijuana after he received  a
CDL in 2014, because he knew it was forbidden by the DOT to use drugs and hold a CDL.
(Answer; GE 2 at 5; Tr. 26-29, 33-35)
The following colloquy occurred during the hearing:
Mr. Nagel: And you violated that rule?
Applicant: Well, not – I didn’t use marijuana on the job.
Mr. Nagel: Right.
Applicant: I used it as like, in my time off. But, I didn’t know that it stays in
the body for that long. And in that case – and that won’t actually – I didn’t
even use it. I think I had a second-hand smoke. I’m not sure about it, but….
(Tr. 24)
As a result of the positive urinalysis, Applicant was sent to drug treatment, but he
was ultimately released  by the employer. (GE 2 at 2-4; GE 3 at 1-2; AE B; Tr. 25, 35)
According to Applicant, February 2016 was the last time he was around people who were
using  marijuana.  (Tr.  23-25,  38)  His  last  drug  test  was  in  January  2018,  and  it  was
negative. (Tr. 37)
Guideline D: Sexual Behavior
In September 2011 Applicant was arrested in State A and charged with  forcible
rape in the second degree, a felony. He was handcuffed and taken to the police station,
fingerprinted,  and  photographed.  He  spent  four  days  in  jail;  met  the  $75,000  bail;  and
then consulted with an attorney. At the hearing, Applicant claimed the attorney told him
he  did  not  need  to  hire  anyone  to  represent  him.  He  testified  that  he  knew  he  was
arrested,  but  he  thought  he  was  just  accused,  not  charged,  which  is  why  he  did  not
disclose  the  arrest  in his SCA.  The  case  was  closed,  and  the  charges  were  ultimately
dismissed. (GE 1 at 58-59; GE 2 at 4; GE 3 at 1-2; AE A; Tr. 44-50)
In  August  2011  Applicant  had  sex  with  a  women  he  met  through  a  dating
application. She told the police that their first interaction began as consensual; however,
she  requested that  Applicant  wear a  condom, he  refused  her request, their  interaction
then  became  non-consensual,  and  he  forcibly  had  vaginal/penile  intercourse  with  her.
Applicant told the police interviewer in September 2011 that the woman asked him to use
a condom, and he complied with her request. At the hearing, Applicant claimed he asked
the woman for a condom, which was inconsistent with his earlier version of events. (GE
2 at 7; GE 4; GE 5 at 12; Tr. at 40-45)
Applicant testified that they had sex one time, and it was consensual. The woman
told the police and gave a detailed description of how Applicant raped her a second time,
in late August 2011. Applicant forced his way into her apartment and then forced himself
on her again. The next day, she reported the rapes to the police. (GE 4; Tr. 45-46)
Applicant obtained copies of all of the police paperwork in 2014 before he applied
for his U.S. citizenship. In his Answer to the SOR, he denied that this was a felony charge,
but the documentary evidence reflects that he was charged with a felony. (Answer; GE 5;
AE A; Tr. 44, 50-51)
Guideline E: Personal Conduct
Despite obtaining a copy of the arrest record, as stated above, Applicant claimed
at the hearing and in his Answer that he was unaware that he was charged with felony-
level  rape.  In  his  April  2017  SCA,  Applicant  failed  to  disclose  that  he  was  arrested  in
September 2011, and charged with forcible rape, a felony. He did disclose that he used
marijuana  between  August  2012  and  February  2016  due  to  a  broken  leg.  Applicant
understood that when he signed the SCA, he certified that the information he provided
was correct. (Answer; GE 1 at 59-61; Tr. 53)
At the hearing, Applicant claimed he did not know he was actually charged with a
crime. When  he  was  questioned  as to  why  he  did  not  list  the  arrest  as  required  in  his
SCA, he claimed he disclosed the arrest in an earlier SCA. At the hearing, he provided a
February  28,  2017  “review  copy” of an SCA,  which  was  unsigned. In  the  review  copy,
Applicant  disclosed  the  rape  arrest  and  derogatory  gambling  information.  He  did  not
disclose the  gambling information  and  rape arrest  in  the  April 2017  SCA.1  There  is no
evidence that Applicant provided the review copy SCA to his employer or facility security
officer. (GE 1; AE D at 36, 39; Tr. 47-50, 54-63, 69-70)
Applicant also asserted at the hearing that an employee of his sponsor may have
modified his SCA before it was submitted to the government. Finally, Applicant admitted
that he was concerned that if he disclosed the rape arrest in his SCA, it might prohibit him
from being hired as an interpreter. (AE D; Tr. at 54-63, 69-70)
Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator on May 1, 2017 and by a
U.S. Army investigator in late May 2017. He disclosed the arrest in both interviews. (GE
2 at 4-5; GE 3 at 1-2; Tr. 56) During his second interview, Applicant stated that he thought
he disclosed the rape arrest in his SCA. (GE 3 at 10; Tr. 55-57, 64)
Applicant applied for a security clearance because he loved working with the U.S.
Army in Iraq. (Tr. 52, 67) He provided several documents relating to his valued work with
the U.S. Army in Iraq. (AE C)
1 Applicant disclosed in the February 2017 review copy of a SCA that from November 2015 to present he
had incurred $17,000 in gambling losses. “As of now I have close to 35000 [sic] in debt , [sic] but its [sic]
not  all  because  of  gambling.  I  still  make  payments  on  time  each  month  ,  [sic]  and  I  100%  on  [sic]  time
payments. But if i [sic] did not gamble , [sic] I could have paid all my debt long time ago. I have take  [sic]
action to stop gambling such as not keeping cash with me all of the time ,  [sic] and I have told some friends
about my gambling problem so they can keep me going on the right path of not gambling. And for now I  do
not gamble as much as before ,  [sic] and one of the reasons that I’m seeking overseas job is because I
want to stay as far as I can from any gambling.” (AE D at 39)

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations. His admissions
in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. His answer to
the SOR included eight exhibits (SOR Exhibits A through H).
Applicant  is  a  55-year-old  self-employed  owner  and  president  of  a  federal
contractor  that  provides  recovery,  screening,  and  sanitizing  of  discarded  information-
technology  (IT) materials.  He  has  owned  and  operated  the  company  since  September
2009. He was a self-employed truck driver from March 2007 to September 2009 and a
driver for a landscaping company from April 2005 to March 2007.
Applicant married in February 1986, divorced in February 1999, and married his
current  spouse  in  February  2000.  He  graduated  from  high  school  and  completed  one
semester  of  college.  He  has  four  adult  children  and  two  adult  stepchildren.  His  son,  a
Navy veteran, is a co-owner of his business and its facility security officer. (SOR Exhibit
H at 1.)
Applicant received a security clearance in October 2013. He submitted his most
recent SCA to obtain eligibility for access to sensitive compartmented information (SCI).
His application was denied in October 2015. (GX 2.)
At the hearing, Applicant testified that, for several years before 2006, he and his
wife  were  focused  on  parenting  and  “really  weren’t  much  of  a  couple.”  In  2006,  he
seriously injured his neck and back while in heavy surf at the beach. His wife had urged
him not to go into the water, but he did not comply with her urging. He spent about three
months wearing a “halo,” which immobilized his head and neck, followed by a cervical
collar  for  about  four  weeks.  (SOR  Exhibit  C.)  During  his  recovery  period  after  he  was
injured,  his  wife  informed  him  that  there  would  be  no  more  sexual  intimacy  between
them.  Neither  spouse  wanted  a divorce,  because  it  would  tear  apart the family.  At  the

otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record.
time,  Applicant’s  children  were  21,  20,  17,  and  13  years  old.  (Tr.  50-55.)  He  told  a
clinical psychologist that his choices were “leave the marriage and break up the family,
or go without sex, or find sex elsewhere.” (AX C at 7.)
Near  the  end  of  2006,  Applicant  was  driving  a  truck  far  from  home  and
experiencing persistent neck and back pain. He stopped at a massage parlor, and at the
end of the massage he unexpectedly received a “happy ending,” by having his genitals
massaged to the point of orgasm. He repeated his experience about every two months.
His  genitals  were  usually  massaged  manually  and  sometimes  orally.  He  had  sexual
intercourse on two occasions. He did not feel that oral or manual stimulation was wrong,
but  he  was  uncomfortable  with  intercourse,  and  he  did  not  return  to  the  places  where
intercourse  occurred.  In  each  case,  when  he  received  sexual  services,  he  had  not
specifically  requested  them  but  did  not  stop  them.  (Tr.  63.)  He  recognized  that  the
experience was illegal in some of the places he visited. (Tr. 56-57.)
In  the  late  1990s  Applicant  began  shoplifting  food  items  at  highway  rest  stops.
He believed that food items were “ludicrously overpriced,” and he felt that he was ‘being
ripped off.” To compensate for the overpricing, he would take two food items but pay for
only one. During the years he was shoplifting, he estimated that the total value of items
taken was less than $100. (Tr. 59-61.)
Applicant  testified  that  in  October  2014,  during  the  interviews  involved  in  the
adjudication of his SCI application, he suddenly realized the seriousness and gravity of
his conduct. (Tr. 66.) When he went home after the interviews in which he disclosed his
behavior, he disclosed everything to his wife. He testified, “I recognized that as painful
of a conversation as that would be, there’d be no way that I could hold a position of trust
if I didn’t do that.” (Tr. 67.) His wife has forgiven him and they have become very close,
to  the  extent  that  they  communicate  several  times  a  day,  even  when  they  are
geographically separated. He disclosed his conduct to a close business associate and
his former director of security. (Tr. 70.)
Applicant has not disclosed his conduct to his children, because he and his wife
have  agreed  to  keep  the  matter  as  private  as  possible.  He  testified  that  if  someone
threatened  to  disclose  his  conduct  to  his  children,  he  would  immediately  notify  the
appropriate authorities, and then gather the family and fully disclose what he had done.
He recognizes that the children would be hurt and might not speak to him. He testified,
“My  children  love  me,  and  I  love  them.  We  would  get  through  that  without  any  real
tearing the family apart, so to speak.” (Tr. 85-86.)
After  the  unfavorable  adjudication  of  his  application  for  SCI  eligibility,  Applicant
changed  his  lifestyle.  He  had  been  grossly  overweight,  and  he  lost  100  pounds.  He,
stopped  smoking  after  37  years,  and  became  involved  in  community  activities.  Most
importantly,  he  and  his  wife  resumed  the  close  and  affectionate  relationship  that  they
enjoyed  when  they  first  married.  (Tr.  71-72.)  Applicant’s  wife  submitted  a  statement
affirming that she and Applicant are still in love and moving forward with their lives. She
stated  that  Applicant  is  “doing  everything  in  his  power  to  atone  for  his  prior  sins.”  She
and  Applicant  agreed  that  her  personal  testimony  would  be  emotionally  “far  too  hard.”
She  explained,  “We  have  gone  through  the  darkest  of  our  times  together  and  made  it
out  to  the  light,  but  it  still  hurts  to  have  to  speak  publicly  about  our  dark  times,  and
writing this letter is by far easier.” (AX B.)
Applicant obtained outpatient psychotherapy from a licensed clinical psychologist
(LCSW) three or four times a month from August 2015 to June 2017. He was diagnosed
with  Attention  Deficit  Hyperactivity  Disorder  (ADHD),  and  his  treatment  focused  on
managing  his  hyperactivity.  (SOR  Exhibit  E  at  1.)  He  has  been  treated  two  or  three
times  a  month  by  another  LCSW  from  July  2017  to  the  present.  The  focus  is  still  on
managing  his  impulsivity.  The  second  LCSW  states  that  Applicant  “has  made
considerable  progress  in  his  ability  to  regulate  his  impulses,  and  as  long  as  he
continues  to  maintain  this  progress,  his  prognosis  is  good.”  (SOR  Exhibit  E  at  2.)  A
psychological evaluation conducted in April 2018 by a third LCSW found Applicant free
from  major  psychological  difficulties  and  histrionic  personality  traits.  This  LCSW’s
observations and comments included the following:
The  testing  suggests  that  [Applicant]  has  periods  of  anxiety  and  that  he
may be somewhat intolerant of other’s shortcomings or failings. He reports
feeling  strong  aggressive  and  sexual  drives  and  he  is  highly  sensitive  to
rejection.  .  .  .  He  may  feel  slighted  if  he  is  not  receiving  what  he  wants
from a relationship. . . .
He  has  periods  where  he  feels  self-remorse  and  low  self-esteem
characterized by not feeling that he is “as good” as others. He may try to
protect  himself  in  relationships  by  detaching  himself,  which  fits  with  his
reported history of difficulty with emotional and physical intimacy. This also
helps  explain  how  he  sought  gratification
through  anonymous
that  do  not  require  emotions  or  commitment.  These
relationships
tendencies  are  not  likely  to  impact  on  employment  matters  but  affect  his
interpersonal  relationships  and  his  private  life.  These  issues  are  also  not
inflexible  and  can  be  moderated,  particularly  since  he  is  involved  in
counseling and aware of them. . . .
Individuals with these personality tendencies may have some struggle with
to  excel
their  closest  relationships  and
professionally in their occupational setting where they are able to fulfil their
affiliative  needs  and  find  positive  reinforcement  for  their  behavior.  They
are  often  found  to  be  hard  working,  reliable,  dedicated  and  highly
productive individuals due to these factors. . . .
intimacy  but  are
inclined
[Applicant’s]  focal  behavioral  lapses  of  the  past  appear  to  be  anomalies
based  on  unusual  circumstances  that  are  not  likely  to  happen  again  and
that  do  not  represent  his  normal  behavior.  These  issues  are  now  well
understood  and  have  ceased.  There  is  no  indication  that  this  illicit
behavior  will  ever  reoccur,  and  he  appears  to  be  capable  of  holding  a
position of trust as he has successfully done for years prior.
(AX C; AX D.)
Applicant  began  neurofeedback  treatment  in  June  2017  to  help  him  control  his
impulsivity. (Tr. 73.) His neurofeedback counselor submitted the following comments:
In my experience with [Applicant], he has consistently presented himself
as  a  forthright,  honest  individual  with  an  excellent  work  ethic  and  high
personal  integrity.  He  has  a  high  level  of  self-awareness  and  personal
insight and has been able to provide honest, comprehensive self-reports
of  functioning  and  reactions  to  training.  .  .  .  Neurofeedback  has  helped
[Applicant]  with  increased  self-awareness  and  control  and  maintenance
of  an  appropriate  level  of  psychophysiological  arousal  that  maximizes
attention, focus, working memory and executive functioning capabilities.
(AX E.)
Applicant  testified  that  he  did  not  make  his  lifestyle  changes  to  enable  him  to
receive  a  clearance;  he  made  the  changes  because  going  through  the  adjudication
process put him in touch with “how awful [he] was.” He testified: “Inside was awful, and I
need to fix that. It was a catalyst, if you will, but no, I didn’t become a better person to
get a clearance. I want to be a person who’s worthy of a clearance, with or without the
clearance.” (Tr. 78.) He submitted a “Statement of Intent” agreeing to revocation of any
security clearance if he engages in shoplifting or receives the services of prostitutes in
the future. (AX A.)
A defense contractor who relied on Applicant as a subcontractor for many years
testified  that  he  regarded  Applicant  as  a  “valued  partner,”  who  was  very  competent,
meticulous, and dedicated. Applicant disclosed his sexual conduct and shoplifting to this
defense  contractor,  who  was  surprised  but  would  not  hesitate  to  work  with  him  again.
(Tr.  22-28.)  The  defense  contractor’s  facility  security  officer  was  especially  impressed
with  Applicant’s  meticulous  attention  and  aggressive  responses  to  potential  spillages
from IT hardware. (SOR Exhibit H at 8; AX F.) A former co-worker regards Applicant as
extremely security conscious, dedicated, and knowledgeable. (SOR Exhibit H at 3.)
Applicant’s  33-year-old  stepson  admires  him  for  teaching  him  the  value  of  hard
work  and  the  importance  of  family  and  friends.  (SOR  Exhibit  H  at  2.)  His  25-year-old
stepson  remembers  him  as  a  loving  and  caring  father-figure,  extremely  generous,
talented, and a great leader. (SOR Exhibit H at 5.)
Applicant’s  29-year-old  daughter  describes  him  as  extremely  patriotic,  honest,
and hard-working. She admires him for teaching her the value of hard work, teamwork,
honesty,  and  time  management.  (SOR  Exhibit  H  at  4.)  His  25-year-old  daughter
remembers how Applicant taught her about honesty and hard work. She describes him
as  “an  amazing  father,  friendly  neighbor,  caring  friend,  loving  husband,  and  most
importantly, a patriot.” (SOR Exhibit H at 6.

"Having  thoroughly  considered  the  evidence  in  the  record,  including  Applicant's
admissions, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 38 years old. He married in
January 2006, and he has one daughter, age 10. He claimed to be nine credit hours short
of a bachelor’s degree. Applicant was previously employed with a DOD contractor from
May 2006 until December 2015, and he held a DOD security clearance during that period.
He was unemployed from about December 2015 to March 2017, when he obtained his
real estate license. Applicant was hired by another DOD contractor approximately one
year ago. His employer is requesting Applicant obtain a DOD security clearance in order
to perform specific employment duties on DOD classified projects. (Tr. 10, 17-21, 23, 35,
GE 1)
The SOR ¶ 1.a alleges that Applicant was arrested in about December 2015, and
charged with pornography-possession of obscene materials depicting minors, a felony.
In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted he was arrested, but denied that the arrest
had any merit to support it. The judge set his bond at $250,000. Applicant stayed in jail
for  approximately  three  weeks  since  he  was  unable  to  make  bail,  but  he  was  later
released after his father paid $21,000. Applicant and his family had just moved to state A
five weeks earlier after he accepted a new job assignment from his former DOD contractor
employer. (Tr. 25, 28, 30, 41-42, 48, 50, 63-65; GE 2)
Applicant admitted to looking at pornography on his computer for about the last 25
years,  including  the  five  weeks  he  had  lived  in  state  A.  His  frequency  of  viewing
pornography varied, but he admitted to looking at it twice weekly in 2015. He denied ever
intentionally  looking  for  images  of  minors,  or  accidently  looking  at  images  of  minors,
during the entire time period he accessed pornography on the internet. It became a habit
for him to view pornography, and he continued over the years because he believed that
viewing pornography was not hurting anyone. (Tr. 25, 28-29, 30, 41-42, 48, 50, 63-65;
GE 2)
Applicant stated at the hearing that on the day of his arrest, the police arrived early
in the morning to his house with a search warrant. A police officer asked him if he knew
why the police were in his home, and Applicant responded “No.” The police officer told
him  they  were  there  looking  for  illegal  pornography.  The  police  confiscated  his  home
computer, and other items, and placed Applicant under arrest. (Tr. 25-26)
Applicant’s background interview occurred in April 2016, which was subsequently
adopted by him on March 13, 2018, after he made several changes to the record. In the
interrogatories, Applicant listed, “When they (police) first arrived, I did not know why they
were  there.  A  couple  of  minutes  later,  they  told  me  they  were  there  because  of  the
obscene material.” He also wrote, “The charge related to pornography of teens under the
age of 17 being on my computer, which would have been there from either downloading
or viewing them on the internet. . . .  When the police came to my house, I admitted I had
pornography on my computer. . . .” He told the investigator that his attorney informed him
that the criminal charges filed against him were for child pornography. The district attorney
(DA) cancelled a meeting with his attorneys, and due to the cancellation, his attorneys
were unable to review any incriminating evidence the state had against him. Instead, the
DA offered to dismiss the charges through a pretrial intervention program with specific
conditions. The conditions included that he attend weekly meetings for a two-year period
with the state’s sex offender group treatment program, and he pay approximately $1,250
in  court  costs.  Applicant  accepted  the  DA’s  offer  and  the  charges  against  him  were
dismissed  in  February  2016.  Applicant  said  that  he  neither  admits,  nor  denies,  his
involvement which led to the criminal charges filed against him. (GE 2)
At the hearing, Applicant specifically denied ever looking at child pornography. He
was surprised about the criminal charges that were filed against him. He stated that the
court dismissed his “case almost immediately.” He only accepted the DA’s offer because
he wanted to get this ordeal over with as quickly as possible, and he did not have the
financial resources to fight the charges. This incident has taught him a valuable lesson,
as he has not looked at any pornography for the past three years. The arrest has been a
source of embarrassment for him and his wife. (Tr. 28, 30-33, 39-40)
After further questioning, Applicant admitted that the DA was not proposing to his
attorneys that they would be “dismissing the charges outright” against him due to lack of
evidence. He also agreed that if he had not met the conditions of the pre-trial intervention
program,  the  DA  could  have  refiled  the  criminal  charges  against  him.  He  finished  his
sexual  offender  treatment  program  in  a  year-and-a-half,  about  six  months  early.  He
denied receiving a diagnosis from the treatment program, or that he was required by the
state to register as a sex offender. (Tr. 43-44, 66)
During the hearing, the following testimony was provided:
Department  Counsel:  And  you  in  fact  noted  that  in  your  response  to  the
interrogatories that the images (of minors 17 and younger) would have had to have
been  there  (on  his  computer)  from  either  downloading,  or  you  said  you  were
viewing them on the internet.
Applicant:  That’s  correct.  That’s  why  I  have  no  idea.  I  have  no  idea  specifically
what it was that they (police) were looking for because they never said so. And
they never told my attorneys. And the first case that they (attorneys) were going to
ask them (DA) about it, they (DA) decided – they (DA) declined to even offer up
anything.
Department Counsel: Well, they (DA) offered up the pretrial diversion program.
Applicant:  Yeah,  I’m  saying  they  (DA)  offered  up  no  evidence  of  any  type  of
wrongdoing whatsoever. From the first time I was arrested, they told my attorney
absolutely nothing.
Department Counsel: Okay, as far as you know.
Applicant: Yeah, as far as what my attorney has expressed to me. (Tr. 47)
Applicant  claimed  the  reason  his  previous  DOD  contractor  employer  stopped
paying him in December 2015 was not related to his arrest, but due to him not working
on  the  contract.  He  was  told  he  was  going  to  be  continued  as  an  employee  while  his
current  security  clearance  was  placed  on  “hold.”  He  acknowledged  this  employer
terminated his employment, but he was unsure of the date. His employer filed an incident
report  in  the  Joint  Personnel  Adjudication  System  since  he  was  arrested  while  in
possession of a DOD security clearance. Applicant admitted receiving a letter in the mail
from his employer and then applying for unemployment benefits. He was initially denied
unemployment benefits due to his gross negligence, “failing to report to work” for three
consecutive days. Applicant appealed that decision, and he did receive unemployment
benefits for a few months. (Tr. 33-34, 52-55, 58)
SOR  ¶  2.a  cross-referenced  SOR  ¶  1.a  under  Guideline  E  (Personal  Conduct).
Applicant denied in his response to the SOR that he was involved in any conduct that
questioned  his  judgment,  candor,  or  willingness  to  comply  with  rules  pertaining  to  his
December 2015 arrest.  He  stated:  “The  court  system found  no  grounds  to  pursue  any
case against me, . . .” Applicant failed to provide any court documentation to support his
contention.
SOR ¶ 2.b alleges that Applicant intentionally misrepresented the criminal charge
from his December 2015 arrest when he disclosed he had been charged with “Possession
of Obscene Materials,” rather than “Possession of Obscene Materials depicting a minor”
on  his  September  2017  SCA.  Applicant  denied  this  allegation  and  stated  he  did  not
intentionally try to misrepresent this charge on his SCA. He listed the offense to put the
Government on notice of his arrest, and he was not trying to conceal the nature of the
criminal offense in any way.
Applicant  disclosed  information  about  his  December  2015  arrest  to  his  current
DOD contractor employer. He also showed  his employer the SOR and interrogatories.
Despite  this  adverse  information,  his  current  employer  continues  to  sponsor  him  for  a
DOD security clearance. The founder of the company appeared at the hearing, and stated
that he was aware of Applicant’s security issues. He would not hesitate to place Applicant
in  a  position  of  his  company  with  full  access  to  classified  information.  Three  other
witnesses gave favorable recommendations for Applicant as well. (Tr. 59, 70. 76-79)

"Applicant is a 43-year-old married man with two children, ages seven and four. He
has both an undergraduate and a master’s degree in computer engineering. Since 2014,
he has been working for a defense contractor as a computer programmer.
Applicant is a naturalized U.S. citizen. He immigrated here in 1997 shortly after
graduating from college. The culture of the United States is more socially permissive than
the culture of the country where he immigrated from.  Shortly after immigrating, Applicant
had few close friends. Bored, he began to frequent strip clubs. In 1999, he purchased sex
from a stripper while visiting a strip club. (Tr. 27; Answer at 1)
In 2002, Applicant began frequenting massage parlors and paying the masseuses
for various sexual activities, and in 2003, he began retaining escort services for sexual
intercourse. (Answer at 1) Between 2002 and 2005, he paid for sexual services on multiple
occasions.
Applicant stopped paying for sex and frequenting massage parlors after he married
in  2005.  In  2015,  however,  he  again  went  to  a  massage  parlor,  where  he  paid  his

level clearance was pending. (Tr. 25)
During a polygraph, pretest interview in September 2015, Applicant disclosed his
sexual misconduct. (GE 3 at 27) Subsequently, in August 2016, his application for a higher-
level clearance was denied. (GE 3 at 1)
In February 2018, Applicant enrolled in a sexual addiction (SA) counseling program.
(AE F; Tr. 20) Since then, he has been attending once per week. (Tr. 31) He has been
working with a sponsor since September 2018. Typically, he meets with his sponsor after
the general meeting has concluded. (Tr. 67)
Through SA, Applicant is working on managing lust and curbing his sexual desires.
(Tr.  32,  74-75)  Similar  to  Alcoholics  Anonymous,  it  has  a  12-step  program.  Applicant
recently graduated to Step 1. When Applicant first began attending SA, he spoke with his
sponsor  daily,  in  addition  to  their  weekly  meetings.  As  he  has  advanced  through  the
program,  he  now  speaks  to  him  two  or  three  days  per  week  outside  of  the  weekly
meetings. (Tr. 60)
Applicant’s wife is aware of his transgressions. They “have talked a great deal about
what happened and [she] feel[s] [they] have only come out stronger” as a result of this
marital crisis. (Answer, Attachment 1) Applicant and his wife practice meditation together,
and  recently  began  attending  marital  counseling.  (AE  H)  His  wife  characterized  their
relationship as happy and trusting. (Tr. 14)
Applicant is respected on the job. Per his employer, he brings a creative approach to
solving software problems and works well with his teammates. (AE B at 4) According to a
client, he possesses “vast technical knowledge and expertise,” and is a valuable asset to
his employer. (AE A)

"Applicant  is  a  39-year-old  software  engineer  employed  by  a  defense  contractor
since January 2018. He has worked in the defense industry since about 2001. He seeks
to  retain  a  security  clearance,  which  he  has  held  since  the  early  2000s.  He  has  a
bachelor’s  degree,  which  was  awarded  in  2001,  and  a  master’s  degree,  which  he
earned in 2006. He is married with four minor children.1
Applicant  is  an  admitted  sex  addict  whose  addiction  is  to  pornography.2  He
started  viewing  pornography  at  a  young  age.  His  wife  is  an  ordained  minister  who
considers  pornography  and  masturbation  to  be  equivalent  to  infidelity.  Applicant’s  wife
discovered  on  several  occasions  that  Applicant  was  viewing  pornography  at  home.  In
order to avoid his wife finding out that he was continuing to view pornography, Applicant
viewed pornography at work using his work computer. He also stored pornography on
the company’s computer. This was against company policy and went on at various jobs
from  about  2002  through  September  2017.  He  never  masturbated  at  his  desk,  but  if
there was nobody else in the men’s room, he would sometimes masturbate there.3
Applicant  received  marriage  and  other  counseling,  and  he  has  been  under  the
care  of  a  licensed  professional  counselor  since  2012.  He  started attending  Sexaholics
Anonymous (SA), a 12-Step organization based on the Alcoholics Anonymous model, in
about 2014.4
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in

Applicant  was  interviewed  for  his  background  investigation  in  September  2017.
The investigator asked him if there was any aspect of his life that could be used against
him for blackmail, pressure, or coercion. He told the investigator about his pornography
addiction  and  participation  in  SA.  He  added  that  it  could  not  be  used  to  blackmail  or
coerce him. He stated that his pornography addiction was hurting his wife, and he was
trying to stop, but he could not. He admitted that he viewed pornography at work, but he
told the investigator that he had not viewed pornography in the previous 18 months. He
stated  the  previous  18  months  was  the  longest  he  went  without  viewing  pornography
since he was in the seventh grade. He credited his abstinence to SA and therapy.7
Applicant informed his employer about his pornography addiction about six days
after  his  background  interview.  He  told  his  employer  that  there  was  a  loophole  in  the
company’s IT system that permitted him to view pornography at work.8
Applicant  contacted  the  background  investigator  a  week  after  his  first  interview.
He told the investigator that he had been dishonest when he told the investigator that he
had  not  viewed  pornography  in  18  months.  He  stated  that  the  last  time  he  viewed
pornography  was  at  work  three  days  before  his  first  interview.  He  stated  that  he
informed  his  employer  about  his  pornography  addiction  the  previous  day.  He  told  the
investigator that his goal was to stop viewing pornography altogether, and that he would
work towards that goal through counseling and therapy.9
Applicant’s employer terminated him because of the pornography issues. He was
hired  by  another  defense  contractor  in  January  2018.  He  fully  informed  his  current
employer of his issues with pornography and why he was terminated from his previous
job. The employer and Applicant put safeguards in place to deter Applicant from viewing
pornography at work.10
Applicant has continued to participate in SA and therapy. He testified that he has
not  viewed  pornography  at  work  since  before  his  background  interview  in  September
2017.  He  admitted  viewing  pornography  at  home  about  two  weeks  before  the  first
hearing  in  August  2018.  He  stated  that  he  immediately  informed  his  group,  his  SA
sponsor, and his therapist. He testified that therapy and SA “will work to keep [him] from

knowledge of his pornography issues.11
Applicant  received  an  evaluation  from  a  forensic  psychologist.  The  forensic
psychologist  diagnosed  him  with  attention  deficit  hyperactivity  disorder  and  persistent
depressive disorder, which “means that he functions normally but often feels depressive
symptoms  and  derives  less  enjoyment  from  life  than  most  individuals.”12  The  forensic
psychologist concluded:
With  regard  to  his  masturbation  in  rest  rooms  at  the  workplace  and
viewing pornography on workplace computers, [Applicant] recognizes this
to  be  a  serious  problem.  Although  masturbation  in  private  is  considered
absolutely  normal,  using  workplace  computers  to  look  at  pornography  is
not acceptable. Based on [Applicant’s] understanding of the gravity of this
behavior, he committed himself to SA four years ago. He is diligent in his
attendance  at  SA  meetings.  He  reports  that  he  has  not  engaged  in
inappropriate masturbation for the past year.
To  a  great  degree  of  psychological  certainty,  I  have  concluded  that.
[Applicant]  has  remediated  the  problem  of  viewing  pornography  and
masturbating  at the workplace.  With  that problem  remediated,  I  found  no
other  problems  that  would  interfere  with  [Applicant’s]  ability  to  work  in  a
secure  environment.  He  continues  to  receive  ongoing  mental  health
treatment  to  assist  with  his  depression,  and  he  receives  support  through
his church activities.13
Applicant  submitted  documents  and  letters  attesting  to  his  excellent  job
performance.  He  is  praised  for  his  honesty,  trustworthiness,  reliability,  patriotism,
responsibility,  moral  character,  work  ethic,  dependability,  technical  expertise,  and
integrity.  He  is  credited  with  commendable  actions  that  have  greatly  benefited  his
community and likely saved some lives. He is recommended for a security clearance.14

admissions are accepted as findings of fact.
Applicant is 48 years old, and he is employed by a defense contractor as a cyber-
security specialist and penetration tester. (Tr. 6, 24; GE 1) He has worked in this area for
the defense contractor for three years. (Tr. 7) In 1988, he graduated from high school.
(Tr.  6,  24)  In  2005,  he  graduated  from  a  university  and  received  a  bachelor’s  degree;
however, the physical diploma was lost, and despite “back and forth” between Applicant
and  the  university,  he  was  unable  to  get  another  copy  of  the  diploma.  (Tr.  27-28)  In
December 2011, he received a technical information technology certification. (Tr. 25) He
intends to complete another “year or so” of classes so he can receive another bachelor’s
degree. (Tr. 6; AE B; AE H) In 2007, he received an on-line master’s degree; however,
he later discovered the degree program was fraudulent, and his degree was “nullified.”
(Tr. 6, 30-32; AE A) He established a cyber-security business in 2010, and he received
several awards. (Tr. 112)
Applicant served in the Army from August 1988 to August 1991. (Tr. 7) His Army
military occupational specialty (MOS) was encrypted signal interceptor. (Tr. 7-8) While he
was in the Army, he held a top secret clearance with access to sensitive compartmented
information. (Tr. 8) He served in Panama during Operation Just Cause. (Tr. 113) In 1991,
his security clearance was revoked. (Tr. 8)
Applicant has never married. (Tr. 32) His four children are ages 16, 17, 20, and 21.

Sexual Behavior
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges in April 1991, Applicant received nonjudicial punishment (NJP)
for  four  acts  of  voyeurism,  in  violation  of  Article  134,  Uniform  Code  of  Military  Justice
(UCMJ). A military police report indicates a person generally fitting Applicant’s description
was inside the female shower area looking at female soldiers coming out of or inside the
showers on four occasions from December 26, 1990, to January 17, 1991. (GE 11 at 5-
7) He received company grade NJP of forfeiture of 7 days of pay, reduction from specialisr
to private first class, 14 days of restriction, and 14 days of extra duty. (GE 11 at 4) In May
1991, Applicant wrote a statement addressed to his company commander in which he
admitted he had a problem with voyeurism; he traced his problem to sexual abuse when
he was a child and unresolved anger; he wanted therapy; and he requested a discharge
from the Army. (GE 11 at 2-3) At his hearing, he said he was outside someone’s room
looking in, and he viewed people inappropriately on two or three occasions. (Tr. 58) He
said he was caught each time he did it. (Tr. 58) He received some therapy before he was
discharged from the Army. (Tr. 60) In August 1991, he received a general discharge under
honorable  conditions  for  misconduct.  After  he  was  discharged  from  the  Army  and
continuing until the middle of 1993, he received therapy to recognize and resist triggers
for voyeurism. (Tr. 62) The triggers to his desire for voyeurism were emotional extremes
such as becoming too angry, hungry, or lonely. (Tr. 62)
SOR  ¶  1.b  alleges  in  April  1994,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  four
counts of aggravated sexual battery. Applicant said that because he was angry about his
life, particularly his lack of financial success and low-paying employment, he “graduated”
from  voyeurism  to  “frottage.”  (Tr.  63)  According  to  the  Merriam-Webster  Dictionary,
frottage is “the act of obtaining sexual stimulation by rubbing against a person or object.”
https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/frottage.  Applicant  said  he  was  in  a  club,
and  someone  touched  a  woman  inappropriately  on  her  rear.  (Tr.  64)  He  may  have
bumped her. (Tr. 64) She accused Applicant of touching her inappropriately, and he was
arrested  and  charged  with  sexual  assault.  (Tr.  64)  Applicant  pleaded  guilty  to  sexual
assault.  (Tr.  64)  In  his  SOR  response,  he  said,  “Against  my  own  desire,  I  touched  a
woman inappropriately in a public place.” At his hearing, he denied that he touched her

said  that  “[o]ut  of  camaraderie,  they  all  said  that  I  did.”  (Tr.  66)1  He  conceded  that  he
pleaded guilty to four counts of sexual assault on four women. (Tr. 67-68) He claimed he
only touched one woman, and the touching was unintentional and not sexual. (Tr. 67-68)
He  pleaded  guilty  because  the  prosecutor  reduced  the  four  felony-level  aggravated
sexual battery charges to four misdemeanor-level sexual battery charges. (Tr. 68-69) He

He did not realize he touched the woman’s breast. (GE 2 at 15) In his November 15, 2016 OPM PSI, he
said that the act was not intentional or conscious. (GE 2 at 21) He was arrested for sexual assault. (GE 2

(between $1,000 and $2,000). (Tr. 69-70) He was on probation for three years. (Tr. 70)
SOR ¶ 1.c alleges in September 2005, Applicant was arrested and charged with
solicitation of prostitution. Applicant went with an undercover police woman to a motel,
and when he arrived, some police came out of the bathroom and arrested him. (Tr. 74-
76) He was found guilty of soliciting a prostitute and fined $335. (Tr. 75) He denied that
he offered the undercover police woman any money. (Tr. 75-76) The police report states,
“The  subject  wanted  to  commit a  sex  act for  $30.00.”  (GE 5 at  3) He  said he  pleaded
guilty without admitting that he offered her money for sex. (Tr. 75)
Criminal Conduct
SOR  ¶  2.a  cross-alleges  the  conduct  in  SOR  ¶  1.  SOR  ¶  2.b  alleges  that  in
December  2005,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  petit  larceny.  (GE  4)  An
employee of a drug store said Applicant picked up two items and walked out of the store.
(Tr.  80) The police  accused  Applicant  of  stealing.  (Tr.  78)  Applicant pleaded  not  guilty
and told the judge he purchased the items earlier from a different store. (Tr. 79) The judge
found him guilty of petty larceny, and Applicant believed he was convicted because he
was unable to produce the receipts for the items. (Tr. 79) He was sentenced to 12 months
in jail with 10 months suspended. (Tr. 81)
SOR ¶ 2.c alleges that in July 2010, Applicant was arrested and charged with petty
theft. Applicant said he was in a store and someone left their wallet at the register. (Tr.
82) Applicant took the wallet and attempted to return it to its owner who was outside the
store. (Tr. 83) The wallet was returned to the owner. (Tr. 83) The owner said $200 was
missing from his wallet. (Tr. 83) Applicant was convicted of “petty larceny.” (Tr. 84-85) He
received a $200 fine and was required to pay $150 in court costs. (Tr. 84)
Financial Considerations
Applicant was unemployed from August 2012, to June 2014, and from November
2014 to December 2015. (Tr. 45-46, 49) He lived in a homeless shelter for two months,
and he lived in his car for a time. (Tr. 48-49) He used the unemployment time to burnish
his  credentials  and  earn  information  technology  certifications.  (Tr.  46)  He  recently
received several salary increases, and his current salary is around $104,000. (Tr. 45, 100)
He receives 30 percent disability pay ($497 monthly) from the Department of Veterans
Affairs. (Tr. 108)
Applicant’s SOR alleges the following financial issues:
SOR  ¶  3.a  alleges  his  student  loan  for  $2,272  was  charged  off.  Applicant  is
currently enrolled in college, and he believed the correct loan status should be deferred.
(Tr. 40) He has about $12,000 in student loans that are not deferred because he “took a
pause at school.” (Tr. 73) He owes approximately $46,000 in student loans and they are
in deferment because he has been enrolled in a bachelor’s degree program since 2016.
(AE B) This debt is mitigated.
SOR ¶ 3.b alleges a collection debt for $350. Applicant was unaware of the source
of the debt, and he used a credit repair company to dispute his responsibility for it. (Tr.
42-43) This is the only SOR debt in collections. Applicant is credited with mitigating this
debt.
SOR  ¶  3.c  alleges  a  delinquent  child-support  debt  for  $55,584  owed  to  a  state
department of social services. Applicant said he started paying child support in 1996 or
1997. (Tr. 36) He said he consistently made child-support payments for the past three
years,  and  whenever  possible  he  pays  extra  to  reduce  the  arrearage.  (Tr.  87)  In  his
November  15,  2016  Officer  of  Personnel  Management  personal  subject  interview,
Applicant  said  his  child-support  arrearage  was  $46,715.  (GE  2  at  21)  His  current
arrearage is about $48,000. (Tr. 72) In October 2018, he owed the following amounts for
four children: $22,613; $9,988; $3,900; and $11,728, for a total of $48,229. (Tr. 71; AE
G) He currently pays $475 through a wage withholding or garnishment2 for one child and
$475 for his arrearage or a total of $950 per two-week pay period. (Tr. 36-37, 100) He
said  this  amounts  to  $1,400  or  $1,400  monthly.  (Tr.  100)  He  said  he  pays  extra  each
month in addition to the wage withholding. (Tr. 38) His November 16, 2018 child-support
statement indicated he paid $760. (AE G) In June 2018, he ended the garnishment and
is voluntarily paying his child-support debt. (AE A; AE G) This debt is not mitigated.
Applicant was unsure when he filed his federal income tax returns for tax years
2014 and 2015. (Tr. 114) He said he had not “completely” filed tax returns for the last five
years. (Tr. 113, 115) He said, “I have not filed taxes for 2017 yet, but I have filed taxes
for ’15 and ’14.” (Tr. 114) He said he filed his 2016 tax return. (Tr. 114) I asked him to
provide his Internal Revenue Service Form 1040s for the previous three years. (Tr. 116)
Applicant did not object to Department Counsel’s proposed amendment of the SOR to
add SOR ¶¶ 3.d through 3.g.
SOR  ¶¶  3.d  and  3.e  allege  Applicant  failed  to  timely  file  his  federal  income  tax
returns for tax years 2016 and 2017. (Tr. 117) SOR ¶¶ 3.f and 3.g allege Applicant failed
to timely file his state income tax return for tax years 2016 and 2017. (Tr. 117)
After  Applicant’s  hearing,  he  provided  documentation  depicted  in  the  following
table for tax years 2013, 2014, 2016, and 2017 (not 2015).
2 Of course, Applicant loses some mitigating credit because his child support payments were made
through garnishment of his salary even though his opportunity to establish a payment plan may have been
limited at times because of unemployment, lack of income, and other financial commitments. Payment of a
debt  “though  garnishment  rather  than  a  voluntary  effort  diminishes  its  mitigating  force.”  Compare  ISCR
Case No. 08-06058 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2010) with ISCR Case No. 04-07360 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sept. 26,
2006) (payment of two of four debts through garnishment did not bar mitigation of financial considerations
concerns). See also ISCR Case No. 09-05700 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, 2011) (garnished payments towards
delinquent tax debts is not mitigating information in light of other factors); ISCR Case No. 08-06058 at 6
(App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2009) (remanding the case to the administrative judge and stating when addressing an
Internal  Revenue  Service  garnishment,  “On  its  face,  satisfaction  of  a  debt  through  the  involuntary
establishment  of  a  creditor’s  garnishment  is  not  the  same  as,  or  similar  to,  a  good-faith  initiation  of
repayment by the debtor.”).

Applicant’s state and federal income tax returns for tax years 2013, 2014, 2016,
and 2017 did not indicate that he owed any federal or state income taxes. (AE C-AE F)
Applicant said he did not need to file a tax return for tax year 2012 because his income
was too low, and he said his tax preparation service said he did not need to file tax returns
if it was more than six years ago. (AE A) If the IRS wants to pursue tax evasion or related
charges, it must do this within six years from the date the unfiled return was due. This six-
year  time  limit  does  not  remove  the  requirement  to  file  tax  returns  prior  to  2012.  No
adverse  inference  is  made  about  whether  Applicant  has  failed  to  file  or  timely  file  tax
returns other than those for tax years 2014, 2016, and 2017.
Personal Conduct
SOR ¶ 4.a alleges that Applicant was terminated from his employment in January
2016 for viewing inappropriate material on a computer while at work. (Tr. 51-57) While at
work, he was on a website where women do “silly things” such as “twerking” or “shaking
their butts.” (Tr. 53) He said not all of the videos on the website are sexually oriented. (Tr.
55)  He  was  working  at  the  front  desk  of  a  hotel,  and  another  employee  saw  the
inappropriate video and reported him to management. (Tr. 53) He said the problem was
he walked away from the desk, and he failed to close out the video. (Tr. 53) The time he
was caught on the website at work was not the first time he viewed material from that
website at work. (Tr. 56-57) SOR ¶ 4.b cross-alleges the conduct alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1
and 2.
Character Evidence
Applicant provided 19 pages of letters and emails positively describing his work
and contributions to his community from 1996 to 2011. (AE I) The statements laud his
integrity, responsibility, dependability, and intelligence. (AE I) He worked numerous hours
as a volunteer and often helped others with computer problems. (AE H) He presented
certificates  and  diplomas,  dated  from  1996  to  2015,  documenting  his  training  and
education accomplishments.

trip  to  Australia  in  2004,  he  engaged  in  sexual  intercourse  with  a  prostitute  on  two
separate occasions. Those encounters took place  in brothels. In 2014 and 2016, while
visiting  his  father  in  Austria,  Applicant  hired  prostitutes  for  sexual  intercourse.  Both  of
those  incidents  took  place  at  the  same  brothel.  Prostitution  is  legal  in  Australia  and
Austria. (Item 3)
Applicant paid the prostitutes in cash on each occasion. He never disclosed his
name  or  information  about  himself  to  the  women.  He  did  not  attempt  to  establish
communication with the women after the encounters. (Item 4)
During the May 2016 polygraph, Applicant acknowledged that longstanding marital
issues and his wife’s previous two affairs contributed to his decision to hire a prostitute
on  those  four  occasions.  As  of  the  date  of  the  polygraph,  he  had  not  disclosed  the
incidents to his wife. He had not informed his employer of his actions because prostitution
is legal in both countries, and he did not believe he broke a law which required disclosure.
(Item 4)
Applicant  was  unaware  that  engaging  in  prostitution,  which  is  legal  in  another
country but illegal in the United States, is a violation of the Federal government’s policy
regarding Combating Trafficking of Persons. He takes full responsibility for his actions,
and did not realize the potential negative effect his behavior could have on his  security
clearance and employment. He knew that it could have a negative effect on his personal

life. (Item 4)  After receiving the SOR in 2018, he disclosed his behavior to his employer’s
lawyer, his security officer, and some good friends in his field.2 (Item 1)
On June 12, 2018 (after the SOR issued on May 18, 2018), Applicant told his wife
that he had hired prostitutes in the past.3 He said that he and his wife are resolving this
issue and remain committed to their marriage. (Item 1)
Applicant repeatedly stated that he is not a security risk as a consequence of his
behavior. He has never betrayed this country that he has successfully served for 32 years.
He continues to play a critical role in his work for a U.S. agency. (Item 1; AE A)
Applicant  submitted  six  letters  of  recommendation  from  former  military  and
professional  colleagues  and  supervisors.  All  of  the  authors  have  held  or  hold  security
clearances and have known Applicant for many years and highly recommend his security
clearance be reinstated. They attest to Applicant’s impressive record of trustworthiness
and honesty; work ethic; loyalty and ties to the United States; reliability; and professional
competency. It is not clear whether all of them are aware of the underlying facts in this
investigation. (Item 3: a through g; AE C)
In  his  answer  to  the  SOR  and  response  to  the  FORM,  Applicant  expressed
remorse and embarrassment over his misconduct and sadness regarding the pain he has
caused his wife. He has no intention to repeat his behavior. (Item 1; AE A)

"The SOR alleges under Guideline D (SOR ¶ 1.a), and cross-alleges under Guideline
E (SOR ¶ 2.a),2 that Applicant deliberately sought out and viewed sexually explicit photos
of underage females on various occasions between at least 2012 and June 2014. (Item 1.)
In his Answer to the SOR (Item 2), Applicant denied the conduct alleged. He indicated that
the allegation is “a gross misrepresentation of information considered to be a discovery by
a polygraph interviewer,” who conducted “an extensive intrusion” lasting upwards of four

hours where  any  response  by  him  indicating inadvertent or potential engagement was
interpreted as if there had been criminal activity.
After considering the FORM, which includes Applicant’s Answer to the SOR (Item 2),
and AE A, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is a 30-year-old computer software engineer. He has a bachelor’s degree
in  computer  science  awarded  in  December  2011  and  a  master’s  degree  in  computer
information  science  awarded  in  May  2014.  (Item  5.)  He  has  worked  for  his  current
employer, a large defense contractor, since November 2014. He has been married since
April 2014, and he and his spouse have a two-year-old son. (Item 3.)
While in college, Applicant ignored known university policies regarding computer use
several times. In November 2007 or 2008, he ran a penetration test with a hacking tool and
by  scanning  the  university’s  unblocked  network  traffic,  was  able  to  log  onto  another
student’s laptop and steal his passwords. A friend had bet him that it could not be done,
and Applicant wanted to show him otherwise. The university disabled his student account
for  one  semester,  but  Applicant  got  around  it  by  using  two  or  three  other  students’
credentials to gain Internet access. While taking a technical writing course in the summer
of 2011, Applicant asked the computer science department if he could perform a blanket
sweep of the network to scan for security certificates and cookie certificates. After being
denied authorization, he used his personal computer to “attack” 10 to 12 student accounts,
although he did not steal or save any information from their accounts. Between 2007 and
2011, Applicant streamed movies knowing that they had been illegally downloaded by a
friend.  Applicant  illegally  downloaded  computer  games  from  various  sites,  and  after
obtaining computer software programs for trial, he used a software tool that removed the
license features. (Items 4, 6.)
Applicant worked as a graduate research assistant during academic semesters from
January 2012 through May 2014 while pursuing his master’s degree. From June 30, 2013,
to  March  8,  2014,  he  was  an  intern  with  another  government  agency.  An  information
security specialist familiar with Applicant’s work indicated in June 2014 that Applicant was
highly skilled in computer-related issues. (Item 5.)
In April 2014, Applicant completed a security clearance application for a top secret
clearance and sensitive compartmented information (SCI) access eligibility in conjunction
with his application for a sensitive position with the U.S. Government. During a polygraph
pre-test interview conducted on June 10, 2014, Applicant acknowledged his misuse of
computer  information  systems  in  college  and  his  illegal  downloading,  streaming,  or
retention of audio books, music, computer games, movies, and software programs. He
denied any future intent to continue downloading material protected by copyright except for
books.3
3 The SOR does not allege any misuse of a computer information system, so his past activities cannot be
considered in disqualification. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board
listed five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in a SOR may be considered, as follows:
When asked about Internet content concerns, Applicant reportedly volunteered that
he frequented two nudist-colony websites once or twice a week from 2012 to 2013 and
then with somewhat lesser frequency, about four times a month to present (June 2014);
that on those websites he viewed photos of naked children under the age of 18; and that in
2013,  he  was  redirected  to  a  different  website  that  contained  underage  pornographic
images and he viewed two sexually-explicit images involving females that were around age
eight or nine. Applicant reportedly indicated that he became sexually aroused when viewing
nude  photos  of  children  and  sometimes  masturbated.  On  one  of  the  websites,  he
reportedly viewed a beauty pageant that included females of ages 16 to 22. Applicant also
indicated that he accessed through Google a website containing erotic stories, and that he
read stories about minors at least 50 percent of the time. He also reportedly conducted
Google  searches  using  the  keywords  “young  nudist”  and  “teenage  sex.”  Applicant  is
reported to have said that he has a problem in that he wants to view pornography and to
have expressed his belief that he would continue to access the nudist colony websites and
read exotic stories. While he indicated that his spouse was aware of the exotic stories, no
one knew about his pornography viewing. (Item 4.)
Applicant’s background investigator disclosed no issues of concern from former and
present professors, co-workers, and friends. They indicated that Applicant was professional
and focused in his information technology work, honest and trustworthy, and involved in
class and religious activities. He lived within his means and had no financial issues. (Item
5.) In August 2014, Applicant he was notified that he was no longer being offered a position
with the Government. (Item 6.)
In November 2014, Applicant began working for his current employer. He started
completing clearance paperwork in March 2015, but due to a mix-up, he had to complete a
new Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in August 2016. On August 9,
2016, he submitted an SF 86 on which he disclosed that he had illegally or without proper
authorization accessed or attempted to access an information technology system in the last
seven years. He indicated that he had “side-jacked” the personal accounts of others on the
same  wireless  network  at  school  “as  proof  of  concept  for  a  paper”  without  obtaining
authorization, but that no action was taken against him. He also disclosed that there were
some minor instances of software piracy by him in the last seven years, and that he made
some modifications to gaming software. (Item 3.)
On July 5, 2017, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the
Office of Personnel Management (OPM). About his previously disclosed side-jacking of
classmate accounts for a research paper, Applicant indicated that he had the permission of
(a) to assess an applicant’s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant’s evidence of extenuation,
mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated
successful  rehabilitation;  (d)  to  decide  whether  a  particular  provision  of  the  Adjudicative
Guidelines  is  applicable;  or  (e)  to  provide  evidence  for  the  whole-person  analysis  under
Directive Section 6.3.
In this case, Applicant’s hacking or “side-jacking” experience is particularly relevant in assessing his credibility
with regard to whether his viewing of child pornography was inadvertent or intentional.
the students but not of the university’s information systems department. He acknowledged
that he had engaged in software piracy between 2005 and possibly 2012, but he indicated
no  recurrence  since  his  marriage  in  2014.  He  explained  that  he  could  not  afford  to
purchase the media at the time, and he did not see his conduct as wrong. After being
confronted with his hacking of another student’s login credentials, Applicant admitted that
he and a friend successfully hacked the account of another student who told him it could
not be done. Applicant’s motivation in all cases was to see if he could do it. While in high
school, he had hacked into a teacher’s computer and obtained tests, and he hacked into
the computer system in another incident and changed the results of his examinations in an
advanced placement class. (Item 6.)
When asked about his Internet access to pornographic images of children twice in
2012, Applicant explained that he was not looking for pornography but instead was doing
cyber research into new hacks as a hobby. In lieu of the searched-for tutorial for hacking
techniques, the pictures “popped up.”4 Applicant acknowledged that he had viewed other
types of pornography that is legal, but he ceased that behavior shortly after his marriage.
Applicant could not explain the reported polygraph interview statements that he became
aroused when thinking of the innocence of children. He indicated that he had been asked
so many questions, and he was  embarrassed at the time because he had not told his
spouse. He maintained that he told his spouse about the pornographic images after his
polygraph. (Item 6.)
On July 10, 2017, Applicant was re-interviewed by the OPM investigator. About
whether  his  viewing  of  child  pornography  could  cause  him  problems  with  his  spouse,
family,  employment,  or  legal  authorities,  Applicant  responded  that  the  incident  was
embarrassing but that he would talk about it. (Item 6.)
In response to the SOR, Applicant denied that he intentionally sought out or viewed
child pornography, and stated, in part:
The [polygraph] interviewer had misconstrued my apparent discomfort based
on my distaste for the topic in general and initiated a line of questioning over
an extended period of time to reword questions which had seemed designed
to  coerce  responses,  that  when  answered  in  the  affirmative,  would imply
engagement in related behaviors. It had seemed that any response which
had indicated inadvertent or potential engagement prompted interrogation
and interpretation as if there had been criminal activity.
Applicant denied that any of the behaviors “actually discussed” in the polygraph
interview  were  habitual  in  nature  or  that  he  would  be  prone  to  blackmail  because  the
incidents  were  known  to  his wife, some close friends, and a couple of co-workers. He
added that nothing “resembling the original incident” has recurred since he encountered
the material accidentally. Applicant indicated that after he was advised of the allegations in
the  more  recent  clearance  process,  he  was  interviewed  by  an  agent  from  the  Federal
4 He now claims that he “misremembered” the website containing the sexually-explicit images during his
OPM interview. (AE A.)
Bureau  of  Investigation  (FBI)  agent,  who  “believed  there  to  have  been  a  significant
misrepresentation of events from the polygraph.”5 Applicant expressed a willingness to
undergo a psychological assessment to “substantiate [his] assertions that the allegations
are  a  product  of  exaggeration  and  misinterpretation  and  that  there  is  no  risk  of  any
deliberate occurrence of the alleged behavior.” (Item 2.)
Applicant was provided a copy of the polygraph report in the FORM. In rebuttal (AE
A), he indicated that “vital information had been excised from the official record to construct
a misleading narrative indicating the inaccurate conclusions aligning with the accusations
that [he] contests.” He indicated that the interviewer asked shocking questions, and spent
hours on the issue in an attempt to elicit a single positive response. While disputing the
accuracy  of  the  polygraph  report,  Applicant  did  not  deny  that  he  had  visited  the  three
websites  named  in  the  report,  but  he  asserted  that  one  website contained legal erotic
stories, and the other two websites “contained legal depictions of nudism, defined as non-
sexually explicit nude images.” Applicant asserted that the interviewer took advantage of
the guilt that he felt in having viewed any pornography because of his “personal moral code
grounded in his professed religion.” Because of his “self-induced emotional state,” he felt
manipulated  by  the  investigator,  who  pressured  him  for  details.  Being  as  candid  as
possible, he informed the interviewer of an incident in which he believed he may have
inadvertently  encountered  illegal  sexually  explicit  images.  Concerning  his  specific
responses, Applicant claims that he interpreted the questions as pertaining to the websites
generally and not with regard to illegal contraband. He never intended to characterize his
exposure to illegal material as frequent or of interest to him.
In  an  attempt  to  reconstruct  the  polygraph  interviewer’s  inquiries,  Applicant
acknowledged the following admissions made during his polygraph interview:
  He viewed pornography or images containing nude persons approximately once to
twice a week from 2012 to 2013 and once a week to June 2014.
  He viewed images on nudist websites, which was becoming a habit that he felt was
morally reprehensible.
  He became sexually aroused by an image and masturbated to ejaculation while
viewing the image, although he later indicated that he acted on reading a fictional
erotic story.
  He viewed images of families on nudist webpages with the ages of family members
ranging from infancy to elderly.
  He  viewed  images  of  people  representing  themselves  as  underage  but  not
intentionally.
5 There is no report of an interview with an FBI investigator in the record. Applicant may have been referring to
his interview with the OPM investigator, although in his rebuttal to the FORM (AE A), Applicant expressed his
understanding that his July 2017 interviewers were with an OPM investigator, and he indicated that there was
an external FBI investigation.
  He clicked on a category expected to contain teenage images but he was unsure of
the actual age of the females pictured.
  He viewed websites containing questionably-related materials, i.e., the three named
websites  during  his  polygraph  interview.  About  the  three  websites,  Applicant
indicated  that  he  was  asked  very  explicit  questions  that  were  “shocking  and
uncomfortable enough to find themselves excluded” from the report, and that he
answered affirmatively “under the mistaken assumption that any actions should be
initially construed in the most stark and worst degree and that questions intended to
provide context and mollify any initial responses would be forthcoming.” He denied
that the statements made in the short discussions were intended to imply a habit or
intentional engagement with illegal material.
  While in the photo gallery of one of the two nudist websites in 2013, he viewed a
picture from the teenage category that redirected him to a different website where
he looked at a pornographic image of a female around age eight or nine for about
five seconds. After he closed that image, an image popped up of a female of similar
age being sexually penetrated by an older male. He found it shocking and viewed it
for only a few seconds.
  As of his polygraph interview in June 2014, he was hiding his involvement with
pornography from everyone.
Applicant  added  that  some  of  his  responses  to  the  inquiries  of  the  polygraph
interviewer may have been made “to please and perhaps impress the interviewer with stark
and candid responses to demonstrate a willingness to cooperate to the greatest degree
possible.”  Applicant  denied  any  inference  that  he  had  a  habit  of  viewing  illegal
pornography. Because he considered all forms of pornography to be morally problematic,
he reduced the frequency of viewing overtime and eventually switched from images to text-
based stories. Applicant submitted that his conduct was morally questionable by his own
standards but not illegal, and that his inadvertent encounters with child pornography had
been fully mitigated by revealing the information to his wife, to some co-workers, and to
friends,  including  a  couple  of  gaming  friends  whom  he  had  net  met  in  person.  While
acknowledging that he had previously felt guilty at having viewed pornography or nudist
material,  he  asserted  that  those  behaviors  “now  serve  as  a  means  by  which  [he]  can
empathize with others who experience the same forms of guilt about falling short on self-
imposed  morality.”  He  submitted  that  his  sexual  behaviors  were  “strictly  private  and
discrete.” As evidence of his candor, Applicant cited his self-admitted questionable uses of
computing resources “to show off and generate some measure of pride among peers about
his talents with computing devices. (AE A.)

"In Applicant’s Answer, he admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.d and denied ¶ 1.e. As to the
cross  allegations  in  ¶¶  2.a and  3.a,  he  admitted and denied  consistent  with  his earlier
admissions  and  denials.  He  denied  the  allegations  in  ¶¶  3.a-3.b.  The  admissions  are
adopted  as  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and
evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  60  years  old.  He  has  been  married  for  38  years.  He  and  his  wife
have  two  adult  children  born from their marriage  and  they  adopted  three  girls from  an
African  nation  in  approximately  2009  (A1,  A2,  A3).  The  adopted  daughters  no  longer
reside with Applicant and his wife. He currently works for a defense contractor for whom
he has worked for 15 years. He has two master’s degrees. In 2001, he retired from the
Air Force after 21 years of honorable service as a lieutenant colonel (O-5). He has held
a security clearance for over 40 years. (Tr. 17-19; GE 1; AE A-B)
Under  Guideline  D,  the  SOR  alleged  Applicant  is  currently  registered  as  a  sex
offender  in  his  state  of  residence  (SOR  ¶  1.a);  that  he  is  on  intensive  supervised
probation  from  10  years  to  life  after  pleading  guilty  to  criminal  attempt  to  commit
aggravated  incest  (this  is  not  the  language  from  the  SOR,  which  the  facts  at  hearing
revealed  to  be  incorrect,  but  is  the  correct  charge  to  which  Applicant  pleaded  guilty)
(SOR ¶ 1.b); that he was arrested in September 2015 and charged with three counts of
sexual assault of a child under 15 years while being in a position of trust and one count
of aggravated incest (SOR ¶¶ 1.c-1.d); that he engaged in incest and aggravated sexual
assault  of  his  minor  child  from  about  April  2014  to  about  July  2015  (SOR  ¶  1.e).  All
these allegations were also cross-alleged under Guidelines J and E (SOR ¶¶ 2.a, 3.a).
Additionally,  under  Guideline  E,  the  SOR  alleged  Applicant  failed  to  notify  his  security
office of the stated arrest and subsequent conviction and sentencing in May 2016 until
December 2016 (SOR ¶¶ 3.b-3.c). (Tr. 32, 34; GE 3-5)
In August 2015, A3, who was 13 years old at the time, disclosed to a caseworker
that Applicant, her father, had touched her breasts and made inappropriate comments.
A  few  days  later,  A3  participated  in  a  forensic  interview.  A3  disclosed  that  before  the
touching, her father was her “best friend” and that she trusted him. She then stated, “but
I  don’t  trust  him  anymore.”  She  described  Applicant  coming  into  her  room  when  her
mother  was  gone  and  asking  her  if  he  could  touch  her  “boobs.” She  told  him  no.  The
next day he came in and began touching her without asking. She did not tell him to stop
because she was scared. She was scared because of his military background and she
believed  he  was  strong  and  could  do  anything  he  wanted.  She  felt  like  she  had  no
choice  other than  let him  touch her. Applicant  touched  her breasts  under her clothing.
A3 told the interviewer that Applicant’s touching began when she was 12 years old and
happened more than once. She described another time Applicant touched her when he
came into her room with just his underwear on and touched her breasts. Another time
Applicant came into her room after her alarm had gone off and laid down in her bed and
“cuddled” her, pulled up her shirt, and touched her breasts. A3 also described, through
her  words  and  drawing,  an  occasion  when  Applicant  pulled  down  her  underwear  and
touched her groin area. She stated that this type of touching happened more than once.
A3  told  her  mother  about  the  touching.  Applicant  told  A3  not  to  tell  anyone  about  the
touching because it would get him in “big trouble.” (GE 3)
In  September  2015,  after  A3’s  disclosures,  Applicant  was  charged  with  four
counts  of  sexual  assault  of  a  child  and  one  count  of  aggravated  incest.  A  plea
agreement  was  reached  and  in  May  2016,  Applicant  pleaded  guilty  to  one  count  of
attempted  aggravated  incest  and  all  the  original  charges  were  dropped.  His  sentence
included  10  years  to  life  on  sex  offender  intensive  supervised  probation  (SOISP);
SOISP weekly counseling; placement on a sex offender’s registry (registration a yearly
requirement);  no  contact  with  minor  children;  restrictions  on  travel;  and  other  related
requirements. He was not sentenced to any jail time. He remains on SOISP. (Tr. 22-27;
AE 3-5)
investigation,  he  was
During  Applicant’s  background
interviewed  by  an
investigator  in  September  2018  about  the  above-described  criminal  actions.  Applicant
claimed that his criminal assaults took place on only two occasions two weeks apart in
April  2015.  He  admitted  touching  A3’s  breasts  under  her  clothes.  He  was  aroused  by
her.  There  was  no  one  else  present  at  the  time.  The  following  weekend  the  second
assault occurred. He once again touched her breasts as he had before, then he placed
his  hand  under  her  pajamas  touching  her  pubic  hair  near  her  vagina.  He  claims  he
stopped at that point realizing what he was doing was wrong and criminal. In his hearing
testimony,  Applicant  maintained  that  he  only  assaulted  A3  two  times  by  touching  her
breasts. He denied going into her room wearing only his underwear and, contrary to his
statement to the investigator, he denied touching her groin area. (Tr. 56-61; GE 2)
Applicant  related  that  A3  was  seven  years old  when  she  was  adopted  and  that
she  suffered  from  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD)  and  reactive  detachment
disorder  (RDD)  because  of  things  she  experienced  as  a  young  child  in  her  home
country.  He  also  discovered  that  she  had  been  raped  in  her  former  country.  He  was
aware of all these factors at the time he assaulted her. He acknowledged that he was in
a position of trust relative to A3. (Tr. 51-55; GE 2)
Applicant’s  supervisor  indicated  that  Applicant  kept  the  appropriate  people
notified within the company regarding his being charged, arrested,  entering into a plea
agreement, pleading guilty, and being sentenced. A Joint Personal Adjudication System
(JPAS)  document  shows  a  single  entry  from  December  2016  indicating  his  plea.
Applicant  testified  that  he  kept  his chain  of command  informed  of  all  events  related  to
his criminal charge. The record was kept open to allow Applicant to provide a statement
from his security officer on this issue. No further evidence was received. (Tr. 46-47; AE
A)
Applicant provided a letter from his probation officer (PO) who stated that he has
complied  with  all  his  probation  terms  to  date.  Several  of  his  probation  requirements
have been loosened, such as, allowing Applicant to travel out of state and allowing him
supervised visits with his grandchild. The PO indicated that Applicant meets the criteria
to  “be  progressed  off  intensive  supervision.”  He  also  maintained  a  low  risk  score  for
reoffending on all assessments completed by the PO. (Tr. 29-30, 49-50; AE O)
Applicant provided a letter from his therapist (T) who provided treatment to him in
accordance with his sexual offense conviction. T stated that he has treated Applicant for
the past three years. T further stated that Applicant was fully accountable for his offense
and  has  remained  accountable  to  his  probation  rules  and  therapy  requirements.  He
constructed  a  relapse  prevention  plan  while  in  therapy.  He  completed  his  sex  offense
specific  treatment.  In  terms  of  risk  measurement  regarding  reoffending,  Applicant  is
below the average adult male sex offender who has completed treatment. (Tr. 49; AE N)
Applicant  presented  13  reference  letters  from  coworkers,  friends,  his  biological
daughter, his son-in-law, and other acquaintances. All the letters describe Applicant in
the most positive light, emphasizing his integrity, honesty, family orientation, and church
and  community  service.  None  of  the  letters indicate  whether the  authors were  familiar
with  the  facts  surrounding  this  conviction.  Applicant  provided  evidence  concerning  his
military awards and decorations, two years of work appraisals for years 2016-2018, his
academic achievements, as well as other biographical information. (AE A-M)

"Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  his  SCA  unless  otherwise
indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings, including Applicant’s SOR admissions, his testimony and that of his two
character witnesses, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make the following
findings of fact:
Applicant, 53, is employed by a U.S. Government contractor as a manufacturing
engineer  and  as  a  quality  assurance  engineer.  He  began  this  job  in  April  2018.  He  is
required to have a security clearance to maintain his position. His June 25, 2018 SCA is
his first application for a security clearance. (Tr. at 16-17, 22, 56.)
Applicant was born in a Southeast Asian country in 1967. He was separated from
his family in 1979 due to an assault by Communist forces on the people in his home area.
Applicant,  his  uncle,  and  his  cousins  escaped  to  a  neighboring  country.  Five-to-six
months  later,  Applicant  was  reunited  with  his  parents  and  siblings.  In  1980,  his  family
immigrated  to the United States with  the  help of the  American  Red Cross. He learned
English in school and attended college courses in his new home country. He did not earn
a degree. (Tr. at 19-21, 23, 58, 60; GE 2 at 8.)
After immigrating to the United States, Applicant met his future wife. In January
1992, they married pursuant to their culture in their native country. They have not been
married pursuant to U.S. civil law. He has no reason for not marrying his wife legally in
this  country.  They  have  five  children,  who  are  now  8,  18,  25,  26,  and  28  years  old.
Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2010. He became a U.S. citizen 30 years
after  his  arrival  in  the  United  States  because  citizenship  was  a  requirement  for  his
employment  at  that  time.  His  wife  has  never  become  a  U.S.  citizen.  Applicant  worked
hard,  sometimes  working  at  two  full-time  jobs.  He  purchased  a  home  for  his  family  in
2017. (Tr. at 21-24, 58-61; GE 1 at 10.)
Applicant has strong connections to his “community,” immigrants from his native
country  who  are  part  of  a  minority  population  there.  The  community  is  made  up  of
immigrants that entered the United States in 1979-1980. On January 1, 2014, Applicant
was appointed a “Clan Leader” of his community’s U.S. non-profit organization. One of
the  main  purposes  of  the  organization  is  to  preserve  the  culture  of  this  immigrant
population. (Tr. at 40, 62; AE G.)
Sexual Behavior and Criminal Conduct
In 2006 to early 2007, Applicant began to communicate with others online in a chat
room.  He did this because he  was  bored.  His  online  activity became  frequent,  and he
spent  significant  periods  of  time  making  friendships  online.  He  “chatted”  with  many
women and some developed into discussions involving sexual flirtations. He was on the
internet “all the time, even during working hours because I was the only one there.” He
was  living  a  “double  life.”  He  developed  an  online  friendship  with  a  person  who
represented  that  she  was  a  13-year-old  girl  named  “Jamie.”  Jamie  was  in  fact  an
undercover  vice police officer. The  two chatted at length over a period of six or seven
months. They frequently chatted about meeting and their online conversations became
explicitly sexual. Applicant twice agreed to meet Jamie in her home town, but he failed to
show up. A third time in January 2007, they agreed to meet at a train station and planned
on spending time together, which they discussed would include having sex and drinking
alcohol. Applicant decided to meet Jamie at the train station. When he arrived he was
arrested. (Tr. at 25, 30, 50-52, 63-64; GE 2 at 2-3; AE B at 20.)
Applicant initially told the police that he had made a mistake. At one point in his
interrogation, Applicant was nervous and tried to lie about his reason for being at the train
station. He then decided to tell the truth and admit his true intentions. He was charged
with  one  felony  account  of  Luring  and  Meeting  a  Child  for  Sexual  Interest  and  three
misdemeanor counts of Luring a Child for Sexual Interest. On the advice of his attorney,
Applicant pleaded guilty to all four charges in 2008. He was fined $4,000 and sentenced
to ten days in jail and three years of probation. He successfully completed his probation
in  July  2011.  One  of  the  terms  of  his  probation  was  that  he  receive  a  psychiatric
evaluation. He complied, but he did not provide a copy of the evaluation as evidence. He
was  also  unable  to  recall  any  of  the  details  of  the  evaluation,  except  that  he  was  not
diagnosed with an abnormality. There is no record evidence of the evaluator’s diagnosis
or prognosis. His probation terms also required that he annually register as a sex offender
for the rest of his life. He complies with this annual registration requirement. (Tr. at 27-28,
65-66, 71-72.)
In  2008,  Applicant  entered  a  counseling  program  for  individuals  who  had
experienced  problems  with  having  a  sexual  interest  in  children.  He  claimed  that  his
participation in the program was voluntary and was not a part of his sentence or probation.
The minutes of the July 18, 2008 court proceeding of his sentencing states that Applicant
is required to “cooperate with Probation Officer in any plan for psychiatric, psychological,
alcohol and/or drug treatment, or counseling.” He provided no documentation from the
court,  probation  officer,  or  the  counselor  confirming  that  his  counseling  was  indeed
voluntary. He testified that his wife was supportive of his decision to seek counseling. (Tr.
at 34, 37-41, 51, 68, 70-73; GE 5 at 14.)
The  counseling  program  involved  weekly  one-hour  group  sessions  and  was
supposed  to  last  18  months.   The  focus  of  the  group  was  persons  who  had   sexual
addiction involving minors. In  this program, Applicant  learned to identify situations that
created a  “high-risk” for him to repeat his past behavior.  He   was   “brutally honest”  with
himself because he wanted to change. Since his 2007 arrest, he has made “a conscious
effort to better  [himself].” Through  his counseling, he has  come to  understand  the “urges”
within himself that seeks gratification  that are hard for  him to resist.  He   learned “tools”
that will  help him for  the rest  of his  life  avoid pursuing  his urges. (Tr. 34, 37-41, 51-55, 77-
78.)
Applicant was active in the counseling program from 2008 to 2011, much longer
than 18 months. He ceased attending about the same time his probation terminated. He
did not receive a certificate of completion, however. He testified that he stopped attending
the counseling sessions because he was working two full-time jobs to support his family
and his work schedule did not give him the necessary time to attend. He testified that the
completion  of  the  program  was  not  a  “priority”  for  him.  To  obtain  a  certificate  of
completion,  he had  to complete 21 “tasks.” He  only  completed about 90 percent of the
tasks.  He  offered  no  documentation  from  the  program  that  provided  a  diagnosis  or  a
prognosis. He has received no treatment, counseling, or an evaluation of any kind since
2011. (Tr. at 51-53, 70-76, 82-83; AE B.)
Applicant provided as evidence some random notes he prepared in his counseling
sessions.  The  notes  reveal  that  he  intensively  examined  his  sexual  interest  in  and
interactions with Jamie. He sought understanding of the causes of his sexual interest in
underage girls, and the situations that he believed triggered that interest, which he labeled
“high-risk factors.” He acknowledged at the hearing that having his sons’ attractive young
girlfriends’ visits to his home was a high-risk factor. He also acknowledged that his sexual
interest in young girls was a significant problem for him and that he needed to take steps
to control his impulses and avoid acting on those impulses. He testified that in his native
country, it is typical that girls marry at the age of 15. His sexual interest in young girls is
consistent with his cultural upbringing. He testified that he enjoyed the flirtation of online
chatting with Jamie and other woman and that he “can’t resist,” a phrase that he repeated
a second time for emphasis: “I can’t resist.” In an essay he wrote as part of his counseling,
he commented that he would “groom” underage girls in online chats in the hopes of having
sex  with  them.  He  acknowledged  that  his  sexual  urges  were  “really  big  and
uncontrollable.”(Tr. at 64-65, 69, 78; AE B at 20.)
Applicant has not committed any crimes since his 2007 arrest. He no longer chats
online. His immediate family and a close circle of friends know about his criminal history.
His employer does not know that he is a registered sex offender, except that his facility
security officer has seen his SCA. Applicant does not know if his employer would have
hired  him  had  the  employer  known  about  his  sex  offender  status.  He  has  no  formal
support system in place to help him should he ever feel a strong temptation to act out his
sexual  impulses  with  respect  to  young  girls.  Moreover,  he  has  not  provided  a  recent
evaluation of his psychological condition. (Tr. at 33, 35-36, 40, 44, 67-68; AE D, E.)
In addition to the above sexual conduct, Applicant also acknowledges other extra-
marital sexual behavior. In 2004 or 2005, Applicant travelled with several male relatives
to a nearby foreign country. He paid for sex with a prostitute while he was there. He also
engaged in a close, personal relationship with a 35-year-old female co-worker for about
a year. On one occasion, the woman performed oral sex on Applicant. Applicant recorded
both  of  these  incidents  in  his  counseling  notes,  and  his  wife  learned  about  them  by
reading the notes. (Tr. at 45-49, 76-77; GE 2.)
At the hearing and in his Answer, Applicant expressed his sincere remorse for his
actions with Jamie. He has refocused his energy on working hard, at times working two
full-time  jobs,  and  on  supporting  his  family,  clan,  and  community.  He  was  a  clan
representative to his immigrant community association. He wrote in his Answer that he
would never meet a young girl or a woman alone. He values the United States as  the
country that offered him protection from the dangers in his native country and considers
the United States to be his “home.” (Tr. at 19, 29, 44.)
Character Evidence
Two of Applicant’s cousins testified as character witnesses. They both believe that
Applicant has stepped up and accepted responsibility for his past actions and is a better
person for having done so. They testified that Applicant is remorseful for what he did in
the past. They do not believe that Applicant presents a future risk to minors. He is a family
man who works hard to provide for his family. One cousin  testified that Applicant  is “a
productive member of the community,” referring to their immigrant community. The other
cousin commented that Applicant is “active” in their community. Both live near Applicant.
(Tr. 89-97, 99-106.)
Applicant also offered two employment performance evaluations (2018 and 2019).
They reflect that Applicant meets expectations and has some room for improvement. His
performance is rated at 3 in 2018 and at 2.96 in 2019. The documents do not explain the
scale or meaning of these numbers. He received bonuses in both years. (AE F.)

"In Applicant’s  answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in  SOR ¶¶  1.a-1.c,
1.e, 2.c-2.e, 3.b, 3.e, 3.f, and  3.i-3.k. He  denied the allegations in  SOR 1.d, 2.b,  3.c, 3.d,
3.g, 3.h, and  3.i-3.q. He  did not expressly admit or deny the allegations in SOR ¶ 2.a,
which  cross-alleges the allegations in  SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.i,  and  SOR ¶ 3.a,  which  cross-alleges
the  allegation  in   SOR   ¶  2.b.  His   admissions  in   his   answer  and  at  the  hearing  are
incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant is a 36-year-old able-bodied seaman employed by a defense contractor
since October 2019. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from June 2002 to June
2015.  He  was  ineligible  to  reenlist  under  the  Navy  high-year  tenure  rules  due  to  his
reduction  in  rate  from  culinary  specialist  second  class  (pay  grade  E-5)  to  culinary
specialist  third  class  (pay  grade  E-4),  imposed  as  nonjudicial  punishment  in  January
2014. He received an honorable discharge. During his Navy service, he was awarded the
Good  Conduct  Medal,  the  Navy-Marine  Corps  Achievement  Medal  (four  awards),  and
various service medals and qualification badges. He held a security clearance while in
the Navy. (Tr. 8.)
Applicant worked as an able-bodied seaman for a non-government employer from
June to  December  2016,  when he quit  this job  for what  he considered a  better  career
opportunity. He worked as a railroad conductor from January 2017 until he was hired by
his current employer. (GX 1 at 17-18.) He is still employed, but he has been in a no-pay
status since October 2020, when the SOR was issued. He was earning about $49,000
per year before he was placed in a no-pay status. (Tr. 27.)
Applicant attended a maritime academy from February to June 2014 and received
a certificate. He attended a university from February 2017 to June 2019 and received an
associate’s degree in advanced culinary arts.
Applicant married in September 2007 and divorced in May 2015. He married his
current spouse in August 2017. He has two children from his first marriage, ages 16 and
12, and two stepchildren, ages 22 and 21.
In June or July 2012, Applicant was accused by a female sailor of kissing her three
times against her will. When Applicant was questioned by an investigator from the Naval
Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), he admitted kissing her once on her hand. (GX 3
at 14.) Applicant’s  commanding officer issued a military protective order prohibiting the
female sailor and Applicant from having any contact, and Applicant was transferred to a
new  duty station aboard the  ship. In Applicant’s response to the SOR he admitted the
allegation and said that he and the female sailor were dating at the time.
In July 2013, Applicant was issued another military protective order after another
female  sailor  alleged  that  he  had  made  inappropriate  sexual  advances.  He  and  this
female sailor had previously engaged in  ‘rough” sexual intercourse aboard the ship, in
which he choked her, believing that she enjoyed it. In October 2013, this female sailor
accused Applicant of touching her inappropriately while she was standing watch at night
aboard their ship. When Applicant was interviewed by the NCIS, he told an investigator
that  the  sailor  had  placed  his  hand  on  her  breast  and  had  put  his  hands  on  her  neck
because she enjoys being choked while having sex. (GX 3 at 5-6, 9-11.)
At the hearing, Applicant testified that he and the female sailor had a conversation
while she was on duty on the flight deck at night, while the protective order was still in
effect. She began groping him, and he groped her in return, and they began kissing each
other. He denied trying to force her to perform fellatio on him, as she later claimed. (Tr.
39-41.) He admitted violating the military protective order to stay away from the female
sailor. (Tr. 60.) During the NCIS investigation, the female sailor told investigators that she
did not feel harassed by Applicant, that she was pressured to make a statement against
him, and that she would not participate in non-judicial proceedings against him. (GX 3 at
15.)
In January 2014, Applicant received nonjudicial punishment from the captain of his
ship for abusive sexual contact and assault on the female sailor. Applicant’s punishment
was reduction in rate from  culinary specialist second class (pay grade E-5) to culinary
specialist third class (pay grade E-4) and forfeiture of half of his pay per month for two
months. (Answer at 6-7.)
During  the   NCIS  investigation  of  Applicant’s  sexual  conduct   in   July  2013,  three
other  female  sailors  reported  that  he  had   sexually  harassed  them   by   repeated  sexual
comments  and   attempting  to  kiss  them.   One  sailor  told  an  investigator  that  Applicant
repeatedly   told  her  she  was  “hot.”  A  second   female  sailor  told  an  investigator  that
Applicant  repeatedly  tried  to  kiss  her  hand  or  forehead.  A  third  female  sailor  told  an
investigator  that Applicant  told her, “You don’t know  what I would do to you.”  (GX  3 at  15.)
At the hearing, Applicant testified that he sometimes complimented the female  sailors on
their appearance, but that he made no derogatory or inappropriate comments. (Tr. 51-
54.) He  admitted telling female sailors that “they looked good and  they were hot.” (Tr. 56.)
In late 2013 or early 2014, Applicant was transferred from the ship to shore duty because
his superiors believed his conduct created a hostile work environment. (GX 3 at 11.) He
was issued another military protective order in April 2014. (GX 3 at 15.)
On May 1, 2014, Applicant appeared before an administrative separation board,
and the board unanimously found that the evidence did not support the allegations against
him. A document submitted by Applicant reflects that the board was convened to consider
allegations of “Misconduct—Commission of a Serious Offense,” but it does not reflect the
specific acts of misconduct considered by the board. (Answer at 9.)
On May 2, 2014, Applicant requested that his commander set aside the nonjudicial
punishment.  (Answer  at  6-8.)  The  record  does  not  reflect  the  response,  if  any,  to  his
request. He was discharged on May 5, 2014, at the end of his enlistment, and received
an honorable discharge. (GX 2 at 4.) Because of his reduction in rate, he was ineligible
to reenlist.
When Applicant submitted his SCA, he answered “No” to a question whether he
had been “subject to court-martial or other disciplinary procedure under the Uniform Code
of Military Justice (UCMJ) such as Article 15, Captain’s mast, Article 135 Court of inquiry,
etc.” He did not disclose the nonjudicial punishment that resulted in his reduction in rate.
During a personal subject interview (PSI) in January 2020, he told an investigator that he
was not subject to court-martial or other disciplinary actions while on active duty. He later
admitted to the investigator that he was charged with an offense under the UCMJ but that
he was acquitted, which is why he did not disclose it in his SCA. (GX 2 at 9-10.) At the
hearing,  he  admitted  that  he  should  have  disclosed  his  nonjudicial  punishment  in  the
SCA, but he “wasn’t thinking.” (Tr. 72.) His failures to disclose his nonjudicial punishment
in the SCA or during the PSI were not alleged in the SOR.
After Applicant was discharged from the Navy, he was a probationary employee of
another federal agency from May 2015 to August 2016. He worked a 30-day schedule,
with 30-day intervals of unemployment, during which he received unemployment benefits.
His annual pay from this federal agency was about $50,000 per year.
In Applicant’s SCA, he stated that he was laid off from this position with another
federal agency.  He answered  “No”  to  a question whether  he had  been fired,  quit  after
being told he would be fired, left by mutual agreement following charges or allegations of
misconduct, or left my mutual agreement following notice of unsatisfactory performance.
(GX 1 at 19.) During the January 2020 PSI, he told a security investigator that he did not
believe he was fired. (GX 2 at 8.) However, in his answer to the SOR, he admitted that
he  was  terminated  for  misuse  of  the  government  credit  card  and  “failure  to  pay
obligations.”
In the same SCA, Applicant answered “No” to a question whether, in the last seven
years, he had been counseled, warned, or disciplined for violating the terms of agreement
for a travel or credit card provided by his employer. (GX 1 at 43.) During the PSI, he told
the investigator that he answered “No” to this question because he did not receive any
written or oral reprimands and was not suspended. (GX 2 at 8.) In his answer to the SOR,
he stated that he did not knowingly misuse the credit card. (Answer at 2.) At the hearing,
he testified that his personal credit cards had been stolen, he did not have any cash, and
he used the government credit card for food and materials that he needed for his work,
such  as  foul  weather  gear,  while  he  was  on  temporary  duty  away  from  his  home  and
primary duty station. (Tr. 82-85.) He testified that he did not promptly pay off the charges
on the credit-card account because he was sent on another temporary duty assignment.
He made some payments on the account but never paid it in full. (Tr. 86.)
The  SOR  alleges  16  delinquent  debts  that  are  reflected  in  credit  reports  from
December  2019,  May  2020,  and  December  2020.  (GX  4,  5,  and  6.)  The  evidence
concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below.
SOR ¶ 3.b: payday loan account referred for collection of $1,427. In the PSI,
Applicant admitted this debt and stated that he was making payments on it. (GX 2 at 14.)
The December 2020 credit report reflects that this debt became delinquent in May 2019
and is unpaid. (GX 6 at 2.) At the hearing, he testified that he had not made any payments
on this debt. (Tr. 102.)
SOR  ¶¶  3.c  and  3.d:  delinquent  medical  bills  for  $222  and  $70.  In  the  PSI,
Applicant  admitted  both  of  these  debts,  and  stated  that  both  bills  should  have  been
covered by his insurance. (GX 2 at 13.) In his answer to the SOR, he stated that the $222
bill had been paid and that he was disputing the $70 bill because it should have been
covered by his insurance. He did not submit any documentation showing that the $222
bill was paid. The May 2020 credit report reflects that the $222 bill is unpaid. (GX 5 at 2.)
The December 2020 credit report reflects that the $70 bill has been paid. (GX 6 at 1-2.).
SOR  ¶  3.e:  unsecured  loan  referred  for  collection  of  $1,619.  In  the  PSI,
Applicant admitted this debt and stated that he was trying to settle it for less than the full
amount.  In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  he  stated  that  he  was  disputing  it  because  it  “was
made for ex-wife.” The December 2020 credit report reflects that the debt is unpaid and
disputed, with the comment, “consumer disputes after resolution.” (GX 6 at 2.) The debt
is not resolved.
SOR ¶ 3.f: deficiency of $6,131 after vehicle repossession In the PSI, Applicant
stated that he voluntarily surrendered this vehicle after he lost his job with another federal
agency  and  could  not  afford  the  payments.  (GX  2  at  12.)  In  his  answer  to  the  SOR,
Applicant  stated  that  his  ex-wife  had  possession  of  the  vehicle  and  defaulted  on  the
payments after she lost her job. The December 2020 credit report reflects that the last
payment on this debt was in January 2015. (GX 6 at 4) Applicant testified that his divorce
decree  included  his  wife’s  agreement  to  pay  this  debt.  (Tr.  106.)  After  the  hearing,  he
provided a copy of his divorce decree, which recites that he and his ex-wife had executed
a  property  settlement  that  had  been  filed  with  the  papers  in  the  case.  (AX  E  at  2.)
However,  Applicant  did  not  include  a  copy  the  property  settlement  in  his  post-hearing
submission. The debt is not resolved.
SOR  ¶  3.g:  telecommunications  account  charged  off  for  $157.  In  the  PSI,
Applicant attributed this debt to identify theft and denied that it was his debt. (GX 2 at 12.)
In his answer to the SOR, he stated that the debt was paid in full. The May 2020 credit
report reflects that Applicant disputed the debt, it was charged off, and the account was
closed. However, the credit report still reflects a past due amount of $157. (GX 5 at 3.)
The debt is not resolved.
SOR  ¶  3.h:  unsecured  loan  referred  for  collection  of  $1,219.  In  Applicant’s
answer to the SOR, he denied this debt, stating that it should have been removed from
his  credit  report.  The  December  2020  credit  report  reflects  that  the  debt  became
delinquent  in  July  2014,  the  collection  account  was  opened  in  July  2019,  and  that
Applicant disputed the debt. (GX 6 at 2.) The debt is not resolved.
SOR ¶ 3.i: deficiency after vehicle repossession charged off for $19,059. In
the PSI, Applicant explained that this vehicle was a total loss after an accident, but that
the insurance company paid less than the amount owed. (GX 2 at 13.) He admitted this
debt  in  his  answer  to  the  SOR,  but  stated  that  he  was  disputing  the  amount  with  the
insurance company. At the hearing, he testified that the lender falsely represented that
his contract included gap insurance. He was unable to produce documentation showing
that his finance contract included gap insurance. The debt is not resolved.
SOR ¶ 3.j: unsecured loan charged off for $1,620. Applicant admitted this debt
in his answer to the SOR. The May 2020 and December 2020 credit reports reflect that
the account was opened in December 2019, became delinquent in January 2020, and
was charged off. (GX 5 at 4; GX 6 at 3.) Applicant testified that he contacted the creditor
five days before the hearing and offered to pay $75 every two weeks but had not received
a response. (Tr. 113.) The debt is not resolved.
SOR ¶ 3.k: military credit-card account referred for collection of $1,508.  In
the PSI, Applicant stated that he intended to make a settlement offer in June 2020. The
May 2020 and December 2020 credit reports reflect that the account became delinquent
in April 2016 and that no payments have been made. (GX 5 at 4; GX 6 at 3.) Applicant
testified that he contacted the creditor in June 2020, and was he informed that it was not
accepting settlements because of the COVID-19 virus, and that he should contact them
again in June 2021. (Tr. 115-16.) The debt is not resolved.
SOR  ¶  3.l:  child-support  arrearage  referred  for  collection  of  $25,900.  In
Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he stated that his ex-wife had waived the child-support
requirement. The divorce decree, dated May 21, 2015, recites that there was no child-
support arrearage as of that date. (AX E at 5.) The child-support arrearage is reflected in
the December 2019 credit report. (GX 4 at 6.) The May 2020 and December 2020 credit
reports reflect a paid collection account with a zero balance due. (GX 5 at 5; GX 6 at 3.)
Department of Social Services records also reflect a zero balance. (AX A; AX C.)  This
debt is resolved.
SOR ¶ 3.m: collection account for $142. This debt is reflected in the December
2019 credit report. (GX 4 at 6.) In the PSI, his response to the SOR, and at the hearing,
Applicant  stated  that  this  debt  was  paid  in  full.  (GX  2  at  14;  Tr.  120.)  He  provided  no
documentation to support his statement. The debt is not resolved.
SOR  ¶  3.n:  cellphone  account  referred  for  collection  of  $589.  This  debt  is
reflected in the December 2019 credit report (GX 4 at 6.) In the PSI, Applicant stated that
he has an account with this provider and that it is current. (GX 2 at 14.) He did not provide
any documentation regarding the status of this account. It is not resolved.
SOR ¶ 3.o: utility bill referred for collection of $441. This debt is reflected in the
December 2019 credit report. (GX 4 at 6.) In the PSI, Applicant stated that this debt was
paid in full. (GX 2 at 14.) He did not provide any documentation regarding the status of
this account. It is not resolved.
SOR ¶ 3.p: damage to rental apartment referred for collection account of $81.
This debt is reflected in the December 2019 credit report. (GX 4 at 6.) In the PSI, Applicant
admitted the debt, which was for repair of nail holes in the walls of a rental apartment,
and he stated that he paid it. (GX 2 at 13.) After the hearing, he submitted documentary
evidence that it was paid. (AX B; AX D.)
SOR ¶ 3.q: satellite television bill referred for collection of $881. This debt is
reflected in the December 2019 credit report (GX 4 at 7.) In the PSI, he stated that the
debt was for equipment that was not returned, but that he had returned the equipment.
(GX 2 at 13.) He did not provide any documentation showing the status of this debt. It is
not resolved.
Applicant testified that he receiving financial counseling through the Department
of Veterans Affairs a couple of years ago. (Tr. 125.) He also testified that he had hired a
law firm to assist him in resolving his debts, but he terminated them because they were
not helping him. He has now hired another firm. This firm helps him dispute questionable
debts  and  to  help  him  dispute  some  of  the  debts,  negotiate  settlements,  and  make
payments. He pays the firm $89 per month. (Tr. 100-02.)
When Applicant submitted his SCA, he answered “No” to all the questions financial
delinquencies and did not disclose the delinquent debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 3.b-3.q. In the
PSI, he told an investigator that he did not disclose the delinquent debts because he did
not know that they had been referred for collection and that he had paid some of them.
(GX 2 at 11.) In his answer to the SOR, he admitted the falsification.
Applicant’s site manager for the past year submitted a letter attesting to his good
character. He states that Applicant is an integral part of his team, with a great attitude,
perseverance, and work ethic, and that they look forward to his return. (AX F.)
Applicant’s  answer  to  the  SOR  included  five  statements  attesting  to  his  good
character.  The  same  statements  had  been  submitted  to  the  administrative  separation
board in May 2014, and they all recommended that Applicant be retained in the Navy
Applicant’s division officer from April 2011 to July 2012 described Applicant as a
role model for subordinates and an exceptional enlisted leader capable of serving as a
leading petty officer afloat. (Answer at 11-12.) A lieutenant junior grade who had known
Applicant  for  three  years  described  Applicant  as  a  top-notch  performer,  courteous,
respectful to superiors and subordinates alike, obedient, dependable, hard-working, and
reliable.  (Answer  at  13-14.)  A  chief  warrant  officer  three  with  23  years  of  service  had
known Applicant for six years and described him as a great sailor who always performed
above  his  pay  grade,  a  leader  who  needs  no  supervision,  always  courteous  and
respectful, with a deep passion for the Navy and his sailors. (Answer at 15-16.) A chief
petty  officer  who  supervised  Applicant  for  six  months  on  shore  duty  described  him  as
responsible, respectful, and reliable. (Answer at 17-18.) Another chief petty officer, who
was the leading chief petty officer for the shore-based command to which Applicant was
temporarily assigned, described him as reliable, trustworthy, mature, and dependable, to
the extent that he was assigned to the unit’s staff. (Answer at 19-21.)

"The  SOR alleges under Guideline  D that in August 2017, Applicant was charged
with  public indecency and  received five  years’  probation  (SOR ¶  1.a);  and that in  August
2018,  he  was charged  with  1st  degree  felony  rape  and  3rd  degree  gross sex  imposition
(SOR ¶  1.b). The  same  conduct  is cross-alleged  under Guideline  J. In  Applicant’s  answer
to   the   SOR,   he   admitted   all   the   allegations,   with   explanations.   His   admissions   in   his
answer and  at the  hearing  are incorporated in  my findings of  fact.
Applicant is a 38-year-old systems administrator employed by federal contractors
since  March  2006.  He  graduated  from  college  with  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  computer
engineering  in  December  2005.  He  married  in  September  2008  and  divorced  in  May
2018.  He  has  an  11-year-old  son  and  a  9-year-old  daughter.  He  received  a  security
clearance in March 2006, which was suspended in February 2019. He started working for
another federal contractor in April 2019, but his continued employment is dependent on
reinstatement of his security clearance. (Tr. 23.)
In  June  2016,  Applicant’s  wife  accused  him  of  inappropriately  touching  their
children at night. The children routinely awakened during the night and crawled into their
parents’ bed. Applicant’s wife claimed that she rolled over during the night to put her arm
around  Applicant  when  she  saw  their  son  in  their  bed  with  his  pants  pulled  down,  his
hands near Applicant’s genitals, and both of them facing each other. She did not say or
do anything except to roll over and go back to sleep. She claimed that a week later she
saw their daughter in their bed with her pants pulled down. (Tr. 26-27.) His wife set up a
camera  in  the  bedroom  to  record  Applicant’s  activity  during  the  night,  but  it  revealed
nothing. In July 2016, she took the children to a hospital for forensic testing, and a forensic
interviewer questioned them, but the children did not describe any inappropriate touching.
During  the  forensic  interviews,  the  children  described  a  family  situation  with  much
hugging, snuggling, and cuddling. The only complaint was from the son, who said that
Applicant sometimes squeezed him too hard. (GX 5 at 17-27.)
Applicant’s wife and their two children moved out of the house and stayed with her
brother. She told Applicant that she would not return until he obtained treatment for his
“sexual issues.” (Tr. 28.) Applicant’s wife scheduled a polygraph examination for him and
told  him  that  there  would  be  “no  fixing”  of  their  marriage  if  he  refused  to  take  the
polygraph.
On  September  2,  2016,  Applicant  underwent  the  polygraph  examination,  which
was administered by a private polygraph examiner hired by Applicant’s wife. During the
examination, Applicant answered “No” to three questions: (1) Did you ever have any type
of sexual contact with [your daughter]? (2) Other than what you told me, did you have any
type of sexual contact with [your son]? and (3) Did you ever have your children touch your
naked penis? The examiner found no deception indicated and opined that Applicant was
being truthful in answering the three questions. (GX 2 at 27-28.) On September 9, 2016,
the  county  children’s services office informed  Applicant that the reported sexual abuse
was unsubstantiated. (AX D(1).)
Two  certified  police  polygraph  examiners  concluded
the  polygraph
examination  was  invalid.  The  police  examiners  concluded  that  it  was  inappropriate  for
Applicant’s wife  to  be  in the  room  while  the  examination  was conducted,  the  questions
were not sufficiently specific, the terminology (“sexual contact”) was too broad, and three
relevant questions were asked during the examination instead of the accepted practice
of asking only one relevant question. (GX 3 at 13.)
that
As a result of the accusations by Applicant’s wife, they separated for a few months
and attended a few sessions of marital counseling. In October 2016, Applicant’s wife filed
for  divorce,  on  the  ground  that  Applicant  had  been  guilty  of  gross  neglect  of  duty  and
extreme cruelty and that the parties were incompatible. (AX E at 1.)
In November 2016, Applicant’s wife sought temporary custody of their children and
asked that Applicant’s parenting time with  the  children  be  supervised. Her request was
granted.  (AX  E  at  4-7,  13-14.)  Later  in  November  2016,  Applicant  and  his  wife  were
ordered  to  under  psychological  evaluation  “for  purposes  of  assisting  the  Court  in
determining the allocation of parental rights and responsibilities.” (AX E at 11-12.)
Applicant  admitted
that  he  sometimes  experienced
spontaneous erections without thinking about sex, and that on one occasion his wife had
observed him cuddling their son in bed while having an erection. He believed that his wife
concluded from this event that he had a sexual disorder. (GX D(3) at 4.)
the  psychologist
to
The  psychologist  concluded  that  Applicant  “had  no  apparent  and  diagnosable
disorder,  but  showed  symptoms  of  dependent  personality  traits,  with  obsessive-
compulsive  and  avoidant  features”;  that  he  “presented  a  personal  history  and  mental
health profile that made [his wife’s] allegations against him at least circumstantially  and
situationally  feasible”;  and  that  he  displayed  a  more  passive,  laissez  faire  interaction
pattern  with  the  children,  as  well  as  engaged  in  frequent  age-inappropriate  coddling,
cuddling, and infantilizing interchanges with them.”
The  psychologist  concluded  that  Applicant’s  wife  “showed  symptoms  of  a
situational  and  transient  adjustment  disorder  with  anxiety  and  depression,  as  well  as
evidence of obsessive-compulsive personality traits, with narcissistic (manifested as low
self-esteem) and histrionic (i.e., overly dramatic and emotional tendencies features”; that
“there  was  no  definitive  psychological  data  clearly  suggestive  or  confirmatory  of  [her]
allegations against [Applicant]”; that she “displayed candor and openness, consistent with
a personal history and mental health profile that make her allegations credible”; and that
she  “has  historically  been  the  children’s  primary  caregiver,  is  and  has  been  more
accessible to them, and displayed more age-appropriate nurturing.”
Based  on  her conclusions, the  psychologist recommended  that Applicant’s wife
retain residential and custodial parent status of their two children. The psychologist also
recommended that Applicant—
[S]ubmit to and participate in mental health counseling or therapy to more
definitively rule out the likelihood of his impropriety toward the children, as
well as to work toward the normalization and re-unification of his parental
relationship with them, to minimize any cloud of ongoing suspicion, and to
preclude the likelihood of ongoing legal charges and counter-charges.
(AX D(3) at 26.)
On November 10, 2016, Applicant’s wife enrolled the two children in a counseling
program and informed a counselor that she had observed Applicant in bed with their son
with their son’s hands in Applicant’s pants. In January 2017, while  the  children  were in
play therapy, their son drew pictures of trees that appeared to have penises, and their
daughter  drew  picture  of  a  rainbow  with  the  family  inside  and  her  on  the  outside.  In
February  2017,  Applicant’s  wife  told  the  counselor  that  the  children  previously  had
episodes of bed-wetting and had reverted to it. On April 2017, Applicant’s wife asked for
an  “emergency  visit,”  and  told  the  counselor  that  their  daughter  had  reported  that
Applicant had touched her vagina. (GX 2 at 31; AX D(4).
Applicant’s  daughter  was  interviewed  by  a  psychologist,  who  reported  that  his
daughter said, “my mommy wanted me to tell you something.” (GX 2 at 11.) His daughter
told  a  forensic  interviewer  that  Applicant  pulled  down  her  pants  and  underwear  and
pressed on her vagina with one finger to “take out the dirty stuff.” (GX 5 at 11.) On July 3,
2017, the county children’s services office notified Applicant that the allegation of sexual
abuse was “indicated.” (AX D(5).) Appellant was charged with felony rape.
Before the  charges were presented  to  a  grand  jury, Applicant received  a  letter from
the   county   children’s  services  office,  recommending   that  he   have   no   contact  with   his
children   until  he   completed   a   sex-offender  assessment.   In   September  2017,  Applicant
underwent an  evaluation  of  his psychological and  sexual health, conducted  by  a  clinical
psychologist and  sex  offender specialist.  The  psychologist concluded  that Applicant is not
a pedophile. (GX 2  at 30-34.)
In  June  2018,  pursuant  to  a  plea  agreement,  Applicant  pleaded  guilty  to  public
indecency by masturbating in the presence of others. (GX 4 at 5.) The factual predicate
for his guilty plea is not clearly stated in the court record, but Applicant believed that he
was pleading guilty to masturbating in the presence of his children. (Tr. 73.) However, the
bill of information on which the charge was based alleged that his masturbation was “likely
to be viewed and affront others who were in the person’s physical proximity and who were
not members of the offender’s family.” (GX 4 at 5; Tr. 74.)
In July 2018, before Applicant was sentenced, his son told a counselor that, during
some  time  in  2015  or  2016,  Applicant  had  touched  his  anus  and  penis.  The  county
children’s services  office  arranged  for a  forensic interview,  which  occurred  on  July 26,
2018. According to the forensic interviewer,  Applicant’s son, who  was then  eight years
old,  said that  Applicant  touched his penis during the  night,  that Applicant  was  wearing
blue  latex  gloves,  and  that  he  felt  a  substance  squirting  on  his  back  that  felt  like
mayonnaise or sunscreen. His son also said that Applicant inserted a finger into his anus
and moved it around. (GX 5 at 11.)
In July 2018, Applicant was sentenced for the public indecency to which he had
pleaded guilty. He was sentenced to incarceration for 60 days, to be served on weekends,
and supervised probation for five years. He was prohibited from having any contact with
his children for five years. (GX 4 at 15.)
In August 2018, Applicant was charged with rape, a felony of the first degree, and
gross sexual imposition, a felony of the third degree. These charges were based on his
son’s statements to a psychiatrist and a forensic interview in July 2018. (GX 3 at 5-6.)
In  October  2018,  Applicant’s  wife  was  persuaded  by  a  police  officer  to  ask
Applicant to take a second polygraph examination. It would be a stipulated examination,
with an agreement that the charges would be dismissed if he passed the examination and
that he would agree to admissibility of the exam results if he failed. After consulting with
his attorney, Applicant declined to take a stipulated polygraph examination. His attorney
advised against a second polygraph because he already had favorable results from the
first examination and it would be inadvisable to risk an unfavorable result from a second
examination.
In  April  2019,  the  prosecutor  concluded  that  there  was  insufficient  evidence  to
prove the offenses involving Applicant’s son beyond a reasonable doubt. (GX 5 at 15-16.)
The charges were dismissed without prejudice. (GX 4 at 26.)
Applicant  and his  wife were  divorced  in  May 2018, and his ex-wife  remarried  in
May 2019. The children live with his ex-wife. (Tr. 47.)
Applicant’s senior director of operations for his former employer submitted a letter
stating  that  his  performance  was  excellent  and  he  was  well-regarded  by  his  project
manager, the project staff, and their customer. The sole reason for his termination was
the suspension of his security clearance. (GX 2 at 35.)
Applicant’s most recent performance review reflects solid performance, frequently
exceeding expectations. He has maintained a positive attitude in spite of the uncertainty
about his security clearance. (AX B.)
Four  long-time  friends  who  have  known  Applicant  since  high  school  submitted
letters attesting to his kind and generous character, devotion to his family, and hard work.
They strongly believe that the accusations against him were false. (GX 2 at 36-40.) One
of  these  friends  is  a  cybersecurity  analyst  for  a  federal  law  enforcement  agency.  She
submitted a statement at the hearing stating:
I  do   not  question   [Applicant’s]  character  in  any   respect,   but  certainly
question  the  validity  of  the  claims  made  against him.  I know  [Applicant]  was
in  a   horrible   position   facing   false  charges  related   to   his  child   and   upon
advice  of   his  attorney,   he   chose   to   accept  the   plea   agreement  that  was
offered.  I  am   confident  that  [Applicant]   at  no   time   committed   any
inappropriate  act  with  his children.
(AX C(2).)
A friend  who  works in  federal law enforcement  and has  known  Applicant for 18
years  submitted  a  letter  describing  him  as  candid,  honest,  and  genuine.  This  friend  is
familiar with the allegations in the SOR and believes Applicant’s denial of the allegations
of sexual abuse. He believes that Applicant’s guilty plea to a misdemeanor was ill-advised
and  a  demonstration  of  the  prosecution’s  weak  case.  He  ended  his  letter  by  saying,
“[Applicant] is a good man, and [a] trustworthy man, who was manipulated by his former
wife.” (AX C(1).)
Numerous  other  friends,  co-workers,  employers,  and   supervisors,  who   have
known   Applicant  for  many   years,  submitted   letters attesting   to   his good   character and
opining  that  he  has been  the  victim  of  false  charges and  a  difficult decision  to  plead  guilty
to  a  misdemeanor  to  avoid risk of  a  felony  conviction  and  a  long  prison  term.  (AX  C(3)-
AX C(8).)
Applicant is currently in a serious relationship with  a woman who is a registered
nurse and mother of two daughters. She attended the hearing. They first began dating in
February 2017, and Applicant disclosed the accusations against him after two months of
dating. Applicant spends much time with her daughters, and “[t]hey love him dearly!” She
is familiar with the allegations against him. She believes that Applicant is a victim of false
allegations and bad legal advice. (AX C(9).)
",False
"Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  his  SCA  unless  otherwise
indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings, Applicant’s testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 64 years old. He was formally educated through the eighth grade and
later received a GED high school diploma. While he was imprisoned during the 1990s for
child molestation, as described in detail below, he took some college courses. He first
married in 1977. In 1974, his wife had a daughter from a prior relationship. Applicant later
adopted his stepdaughter (SD) and gave her his last name. Applicant and his first wife
had two daughters of their own. They were born in 1980 (D2) and 1987 (D3). In 1991,
their marriage ended in divorce. Applicant remarried in 1996 and divorced again in 2003.
He married a third time in 2005 and that marriage ended in divorce in 2007. Applicant and
his current spouse married in 2012. He and his wife have an eight-year-old daughter. (AE
C at 5.)
Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1974 at the age of 18. He served in
the Marine Corps until 1978. He then served two years in the inactive reserves. In 1980,
he enlisted in the U.S. Navy. While serving in the Navy, he held a security clearance for
five years. He was dishonorably discharged in 1995 after being convicted in a General
Court-Martial of committing indecent acts upon two minor children and served a term of
imprisonment. (Tr. at 15, 17, 30, 49-52.)
Applicant has worked for a U.S. defense contractor since 2004. In 2007, he applied
for a security clearance, but decided not to proceed to a hearing on his application. He
applied again in 2019 with his submission of the current SCA. (Tr. at 15-16, 30, 49-52.)
Sexual Behavior and Criminal Conduct
In July 1987, Applicant pleaded guilty at a General Court-Martial to the offenses of
carnal  knowledge,  sodomy,  and  indecent  acts  involving  SD  and  was  convicted.  The
Court-Martial  was  convened  at  an  overseas  Naval  base  (the  1987  Court-Martial).  The
Charges alleged that his crimes began in about March 1985 when SD was 10 years old.
At  the  DOHA  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  his  sexual  misconduct  with  SD  actually
began several years earlier. The sexual assaults continued for a period of time after 1985.
He  was  sentenced  to  confinement  for  90  days,  reduction  in  pay  grade  to  E-5,  and  a
reprimand. (Tr. at 33, 43, 54; GE 6 at 5; GE 7 at 3.)
Applicant  was  released  from  the  brig  in  October  1987  (1987  Release).  Shortly
thereafter, he was transferred to a base in the United States. His family returned with him.
In  April  1988,  SD,  D2  and  D3  were  placed  in  the  custody  of  the  local  county  child
protective  service.  The  local  juvenile  court  permitted  the  children  to  reside  with  their
mother  on  the  condition  that  Applicant  remove  himself  from  the  family  home.  He  was
ordered by the court to have no contact with the children other than during supervised
visits. He testified that he and his family voluntarily participated in counseling for four to
five  years.  He  also  admitted,  however,  that  the  counseling  was  a  requirement  of  the
juvenile court. (Tr. at 22-23, 32-33; GE 6 at 5; GE 7 at 3.)
In November 1988, SD was placed in a psychiatric hospital for two months. She
was then transferred to a residential treatment center for an extended stay. SD advised
her primary counselor at the treatment center that Applicant had returned to the family
residence in violation of  the court order. She further confided that he had continued to
molest her after his 1987 Release until her hospitalization. (GE 6 at 5; GE 7 at 3.)
At  the  DOHA  hearing,  Applicant  denied  that  he  molested  SD  after  his  1987
Release and after his transfer to the United States. He also minimized the extent of his
contact  with  his  children,  including  SD,  at  their  home  to  one  occasion  when  the  girl’s
mother asked him to come to her home to help her by repairing her car. He admitted that
this was a violation of the court order (the One-Time Home Visit). He testified that it was
this  unauthorized  visit  that  resulted  in  an  investigation  of  his  contacts  with  SD,  which
extended to an investigation of his sexual misconduct with D2 and D3. He further testified
that his One-Home Visit was the reason he had to face a second General Court-Martial
in 1990-1991. (Tr. at 22, 35-36, 53.)
The  record  evidence  establishes  that  SD’s  allegations  were  investigated  and
Applicant was charged at a second court-martial with rape, carnal knowledge, sodomy
and 11 specifications for indecent acts upon SD and two specifications for indecent acts
upon D2 and D3. He was convicted of three specifications involving indecent acts. (GE 6
at 5.)
At the time of the court-martial in December 1990 and early 1991 (the 1991 Court-
Martial),  SD  was  16  years  old,  D2  was  10,  and  D3  was  2.  SD  experienced  extreme
emotional difficulties, testifying on cross-examination about the details of certain of the
specifications. The  military  judge, who  was sitting  alone  without  a  jury,  denied  a  defense
motion  to  strike  all  of SD’s testimony, but allowed  a  portion  of  her testimony  regarding  two
incidents  that  occurred   during   the   summer  of   1988   in   which  she   described   Applicant
fondling  her breasts.  The  basis for this  exception  was that   SD  responded  to  questions
about these  incidents on  cross-examination, which the  judge  ruled  satisfied  Applicant’s
right to confront  his accuser. (GE 6 at 6; GE  7 at 3-6.)
On direct examination, SD also testified that Applicant once tied her to her bed,
had sexual intercourse with her, and then untied her and performed anal sodomy on her.
She also testified that Applicant had penetrated her with a vibrator. Due to her extreme
emotional distress, SD refused to respond to further questions on direct examination and
to any questions on cross-examination about being tied to her bed and Applicant’s sexual
behavior on that occasion. One of the specifications alleged against him was that he also
penetrated  SD  with  a  banana  and  carrots.  The  judge  granted  a  defense  motion  for  a
finding of not guilty to Charges I and II alleging rape and sodomy and Specifications 3
through 11 of Charge III, which alleged various indecent acts upon SD during the period
October 1987, after Applicant’s release  from  the  brig, to  April 1989. The  judge’s ruling
was based upon SD’s inability to participate in cross-examination on those issues, which
denied  Applicant  his  confrontation  right.  In  June  1991,  Applicant  was  convicted  of  two
indecent  acts  involving  SD,  Specifications  1  and  2  of  Charge  III,  which  alleged  that
Applicant fondled her breasts  on two occasions and one specification of  indecent acts
involving Applicant’s baby girl, D3. (GE 6 at 6; GE 7 at 3-6.)
D2 testified at the 1991 Court-Martial that Applicant had sexually molested her by
fondling her breasts and vaginal area. She also testified that she had seen Applicant tie
SD  to  her  bed  and  have  sex  with  her.  She  further  testified  that  on  one  occasion  she
observed Applicant digitally penetrate D3 while changing her diapers. The military judge
dismissed  the  specification  alleging  indecent  acts  with  D2  on  the  basis  that  the  acts
occurred beyond the statute of limitations. Applicant was convicted of one specification
of indecent act involving D3. (GE 6 at 5-6.)
Applicant was sentenced to six years imprisonment, total forfeitures of all pay and
allowances, reduction to pay grade E-1, and a dishonorable discharge. He was released
after serving four years in prison. His conviction was upheld on appeal by the U.S. Navy-
Marine Corps Court of Criminal Appeals. The court concluded, inter alia, that the record
evidence supported the military judge’s findings of Applicant’s guilt beyond a reasonable
doubt to the specifications of indecent acts involving SD and D3. The three-judge panel
of the appellate court also added, “we, too, are convinced of the [Applicant’s] guilt beyond
any reasonable doubt.” (Tr. at 30; GE 5 at 3; GE 6 at 12.)
Applicant  did  not  testify  at  the  1991  Court-Martial.  At  the  DOHA  hearing,  he
repeatedly denied that he engaged in any sexual misconduct with SD, D2, or D3 after his
1987 Release. He also claimed that the only reason he was prosecuted in the 1991 Court-
Martial was his One-Time Home Visit. Applicant also testified that the charges raised in
the  1991  Court-Martial  were  the  same  charges  involving  his  indecent  acts  against  SD
prior  to  his  guilty  plea  in  July  1987.  The  verdict  of  the  military  judge  and  the  ruling  of
appellate  courts  are  completely  inconsistent  with  Applicant  testimony.  While  Applicant
was  relieved  of  criminal  responsibility  for  indecent  acts  on  D2  due  to  the  statute  of
limitations,  he  was found  guilty of  indecent  acts  of  SD and  D3.  he was  found  guilty of
indecent acts on SD and D3. (Tr. at 21, 22, 52, 53, 55-56.)
Collateral Estoppel
At his DOHA hearing, Applicant testified that he did not commit the crimes he was
convicted of after his 1987 Release. These crimes were the subject of the 1991 Court-
Martial.
Department  Counsel’s  post-hearing  brief  on  the  issue  of  collateral  estoppel
persuasively  established  that  the  doctrine  of  collateral  estoppel  bars  Applicant  from
relitigating  his  guilt  in  the  instant  proceedings.  In  her  post-hearing  brief,  Applicant’s
Counsel’s agreed that Applicant is collaterally estopped from relitigating the issue of his
guilt as determined in the 1991 Court-Martial. Department Counsel in her post-hearing
brief  cited  a  number  of  DOHA  Appeal  Board  decisions  as  to  what  has  become  “black
letter law” at DOHA on the issue of collateral estoppel. One of the precedents she cited
was  the  Appeal  Board’s  decision  in  ISCR  Case  No.  04-05712  at  6  (App.  Bd.  Oct.  31,
2006),  which  is  the  authoritative  precedent  on  the  issue.  She  argued  that  the  three
requirements set forth in that Appeal Board case are satisfied in the instant matter. One,
Applicant was found guilty in the Court-Martial of the criminal charges that are the subject
of SOR allegations 1.c and part of 2.a. Therefore, the issue of his guilt is the same in both
the court-martial and the DOHA proceeding. Two, he was given a full and fair opportunity
to litigate his claims of innocence in the 1991 Court-Martial. And three, the application of
collateral estoppel in the DOHA proceeding does not result in any unfairness to Applicant.
I  agree  with  Department  Counsel’s  argument  and  rule  that  Applicant  is  collaterally
estopped from challenging his conviction of crimes in the 1991 Court-Martial.
Applicant’s counsel argued in her brief that at the DOHA hearing Applicant did not
intend to relitigate the charges  of  which he was found guilty in the 1991 Court-Martial.
Rather, he was just disputing the charges “as he did during those proceedings when the
charges were brought against him.” She argued, in other words, he was just consistently
maintaining his innocence. She argued  further that Applicant’s testimony  regarding  his
innocence of  the  charges  was  solely to  provide  his perspective  on  the charges,  which
“pertains to mitigation of those charges.” However Applicant’s position is interpreted, it is
clear  that  he  does  not  presently  take  responsibility  for  the  crimes  of  which  he  was
convicted by the military judge in June 1991. (Government’s Position on the Applicability
of  Collateral  Estoppel  to  the  Instant  Case;  Applicant’s  Position  on  the  Applicability  of
Collateral Estoppel to the Instant Case.)
Credibility
Applicant’s  credibility was seriously damaged by his testimony that the indecent
acts he was accused of  committing  in the 1991 Court-Martial were the same incidents
that formed the basis of his conviction in his 1987 Court-Martial. This argument ignores
the record evidence of his conviction of two incidents of his fondling SD in the summer of
1988, about a year after Applicant’s first conviction in July 1987. Applicant’s testimony
about  the  One-Time  Home  Visit  to  his  family’s  home  lacked  credibility  in  light  of  the
testimony at the 1991 Court-Martial of the acts of child abuse committed over a period of
time after his 1987 Release and after the juvenile court’s restraining order. (Tr. at 54-55,
58; GE 6; GE 7.)
I  also  found  Applicant’s  demeanor  at  the  hearing  to  be  unconvincing  and
inconsistent  with  someone  who  was  reliably telling the  truth. While  he  testified  that  he
accepted responsibility for the emotional damage he caused to his children, his testimony
relied excessively on how well his children treat him today, suggesting that all has been
forgiven and was never a serious problem in the first place. He has no explanation for the
highly damaging testimony of both SD and D2 against him, which renders his claims of
innocence completely unpersuasive. Also, he never spoke with SD and D2 as to why they
testified as they did if their testimony was not true. (Tr. at 14, 26-27, 31, 41, 43-45, 61.)
Character Evidence
While  serving  in  the  Marine  Corps  and  the  Navy,  Applicant  received  several
medals and ribbons. Applicant’s separation from the Marine Corps was characterized in
his  DD  214  as  “Honorable.”  As  noted  above,  his  discharge  from  the  Navy  was
characterized as “Dishonorable.” The President of his employer since 2004 wrote a letter
of  recommendation  in  which  he  characterized  Applicant  as  “a  wholesome,  caring  and
respected individual by his superiors and subordinates (sic).” He also describes Applicant
as  “loyal,  trustworthy,  and  dependable.”  Applicant  also  submitted  into  the  record  a
December  2020  Letter  of  Appreciation  signed  by  his  employer’s  President  stating  that
Applicant is “an invaluable asset to the company.” Applicant has received several awards
from his employer. (Tr. at 15, 18-19; GE 4 at 4, 5: AE A at 1, 2; AE E at 11.)
Applicant also submitted an eight-page psychological evaluation performed by a
licensed psychologist. His report is filled with factual statements that vary from the court-
martial record summarized above. Most significantly, the psychologist makes no mention
in his evaluation of the charges Applicant was convicted of in 1991. He only refers to the
One-Time  Home  Visit  as  a  violation  of  a  restraining  order  that  resulted  in  Applicant
receiving  a  six-year  prison  sentence.  The  evaluation  makes  no  mention  of  Applicant’s
continued sexual abuse  of SD and his abuse  of  D3, a  two-year old  baby girl,  after his
1987  Release.  These  omissions  seriously  undermine  the  persuasiveness  of  the
psychologist’s conclusion that Applicant “is fully rehabilitated from his crime of 30 years
ago,” that “he poses no risk of reoffending,” that he “is not susceptible to blackmail based
upon his prior offenses,” and that he is “fit to hold a security clearance.”(AE C at 8.)
Applicant  testified  that  he  has  not  engaged  in  any  criminal  behavior  or  sexual
misconduct  since  1991  when  he  was  convicted  and  sentenced  to  confinement.  He
testified that he takes full responsibility for his actions against SD prior to 1987. He denies
any  misconduct,  however,  with  respect  to  his  two  biological  daughters,  D2  and  D3,
notwithstanding the charges brought against him based upon the testimony of D2 and his
conviction  with  respect  to  D3.  As  noted,  he also  denies  that  the  charges  raised  in  the
1991 Court-Martial on the basis that they were the same charges he pleaded guilty to in
the 1987 Court-Martial. (Tr. at 20, 26, 28-29, 52. 55-56.)

"Applicant  is  40  years  old.  He  is  unmarried  and  has  no  children.  He  has  a
Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering and Computer Science.  He is employed by
a  defense  contractor  as  a  Software  Engineer.  He  is  seeking  to  retain  a  security
clearance in connection with his employment.
Applicant  has  a  history  of  sexual  misconduct  extending  over  a  period  of  twelve
years.  (Government Exhibits  3 and 4.)  He began  working for his current employer in
July 2002, and has held a security clearance since about 2003 or 2005.  (Government
Exhibit  1,  and  Tr.  p.  49.)  Applicant  admits  in  part  and  denies  in  part  the  sole  factual
allegation set forth in the SOR.  (Applicant’s Answer to the SOR.)
Applicant  was  born  in  Burma,  Myanmar.  He  came  to  the  United  States  at  the
age  of  four.  He  grew  up  in  the  United  States,  and  obtained  his  college  degree  here.
After graduating from college, he was hired by his current employer with whom he has
worked for the past nineteen years.  He possessed a security clearance for fifteen years
without  incident.  He  has  a  favorable  work  history.  Over  the  years,  he  has  received
salary increases and promotions for good performance.  (Tr. p. 23.)
In May 2017, during an interview with a polygraph examiner as part of a security
clearance background investigation  conducted  by  another agency,  Applicant  disclosed
that  he  paid  prostitutes  for  sexual  intercourse  and  other  sexual  services,  both  in  the
United States and overseas on at least 27 occasions between 2008 and 2016.  In 2017,
Applicant  was  denied  his  security  clearance  by  another  agency  as  a  result  of  the
investigation.  Following this denial, Applicant continued to engage in sexual misconduct
on at least three more occasions, the most recent time occurred in 2019.  He estimates
that over the years, he has spent approximately $6,500 for sexual services.  Applicant
states that he paid prostitutes for sex in the United States and in foreign countries while
on  vacation.  Applicant  further  stated  that  he  knew  soliciting  prostitution  was  illegal  in
the  United  States.  He  also  acknowledged  that  it  was  dangerous.  Despite  this,  he
stated  that  he  never  picked  up  a  random  prostitute.  He  figured  that  since  he  did  not
pick the girls up off of the street, but, instead went to a massage parlor  to obtain their
services,  in  a  country  where  he  believed  it  to  be  legal,  it  was  less  risky.  To  him,  it
appeared  to  be  like  official  business  in  those  places.  (Tr.  pp.  29-42.)  Applicant  has
never reported any of this sexual misconduct to his security officer or to anyone at his
company.  (Tr. p. 29.)
Applicant further explained that when he was in a foreign country and sought out
sexual  services  from a  prostitute,  he  did  not  know that  it  could  have  an  impact  on  his
security clearance.  He believed it to be legal in the foreign country he was visiting and
so he did not give it any further concern.  During his interview on May 2017, Applicant
stated that he did not see anything wrong with this type of behavior.  He adds that his
sexual  activities  have  always  been  private,  consensual  and  discreet.  He  has  never
sought treatment for sexual addiction nor does he believe he has a problem in this area.
Applicant has not hired a prostitute for sex since 2019.

"Applicant is 41 years old. He has been employed by a defense contractor since
February  2017.  He  served  on  active  duty  in  the  U.S.  military  from  1999  until  he  was
honorably  discharged  in  2003.  He  attended  college  for  a  period,  and  he  has  several
certificates. The most recent information available indicates that he has never married,
and he has no children. (Items 2, 3)
Applicant  was  arrested   in  2003   and   charged   with   felony   soliciting   a   child   via
computer  and   sending   harmful  material  to   a   minor  by   electronic  device.   He  was
convicted  of the  first offense  and  sentenced  to  confinement  for one  year and  probation
for  three   years.  He  served   about  eight  to   nine   months  in  jail.  He  was  also  ordered   to
register as a sex offender.  (Items 1-4)
Applicant  stated  in  his  response  to  the  SOR  that  he  had  recently  been
discharged from the military and was visiting his mother before moving to another state:
While I was there, I was on the computer one day chatting with people in
Yahoo  chatrooms.  I  was  contacted  by  an  officer  posing  as  a  15-year-old
teenage girl. I planned to head to a GNC nutrition store at the mall to pick
up  some  protein  shakes  for  my  work  out  later  that  day.  I  told  who  I  was
speaking with in the chatroom that if she wanted to meet, we could meet
for  a  bit  outside  of  the  GNC  store.  Next  thing  I  know  I  had  two  plain
clothes officers grab me and take me to the back of the store where I was
arrested.
Applicant  gave  additional  facts  when  he  was  interviewed  for  his  background
investigation in October 2018. He stated that he smoked marijuana two to three times a
week  while  he  was  at  his  mother’s  house.  The  “girl”  (actually  a  police  officer)  did  not
have a profile picture. He gave varying accounts as to her age. He initially stated that he
did not know her age; he later stated that he did know her age; and he also stated that
he  could  not  recall  if  he  knew  her  age.  He  admitted  that  he  sent  the  girl  a  video  of  a
man’s genitalia. When  asked  why  he  pursued  the  interaction  with  the  girl, he  said  that
he was high and wanted sex. (Item 3)
Applicant was arrested  in January  2007  and  charged  with  violating  his probation.

decided  not to  revoke  his probation  and  send  him  to  jail. He pleaded  guilty  in May  2007

"The SOR alleged under Guideline D, and cross-alleged under Guideline E, that
Applicant  was  diagnosed  with  a  fetishistic  disorder;  engaged  in  sexual  behavior  of  a
compulsive nature related to diapers; sought imagery related to diapers for arousal and
masturbation  purposes;  inadvertently  viewed  child  pornography  multiple  times;  has
stolen  diapers;  feels  significant  shame  and  anxiety  associated  with  his  sexual
predilections;  and  does  not  want  his  sexual  behavior  to  be  discovered  by  others.
Applicant admitted both allegations and submitted evidence in mitigation.
Applicant’s  SOR  admissions  and  those  at  his  hearing  are  incorporated  into  my
findings of fact. After a thorough review of all the record evidence, I make the following
additional findings of fact:
Applicant,  32,  has  been  working  for  his  employer  and  clearance  sponsor  since
May  2012.  After  graduating  from  high  school,  he  completed  his  bachelor’s  degree  in
2012. He has never been married and has no children.
In  2012,  Applicant  requested  clearance  eligibility  to  work  for  a  federal  Agency
(Agency).  He  participated  in  five  interviews  with  Agency  investigators,  three  of  them
were polygraph-assisted interviews conducted in May, June, and August 2012, and two
were regular interviews conducted in May and November 2012. (GEs 2, 3, 4) After the
interviews,  he  requested  the  Agency  to  stop  adjudicating  his  clearance  eligibility.
Apparently,  the  Agency  did  not  adjudicate  his  eligibility  for  a  clearance,  and  he  has
continued working for his current employer.
In September 28, 2016, Applicant submitted his  pending SCA and disclosed his
prior  application  for  a  clearance  with  the  Agency.  The  subsequent  background
investigation  revealed  the  pending  security  concerns,  which  are  based  on  information
Applicant disclosed during his five Agency interviews in 2012.
Applicant’s interest in diapers started when he was five-six years old. He would
occasionally wear his younger sister’s diapers. When he  was 10  years old, he became
sexually aroused when he touched the outside of a two-year-old’s diaper. At age 15, he
masturbated after holding his infant cousin in a diaper. While in high school, he stole a
package  of  diapers because  he  was  too  embarrassed  to  pay for them.  Between  2007
and 2012, he used diapers at least once a week for sexual gratification. He wears the
diapers  at  home  when  he  is  alone.  He  enjoys  to  excrete  and  to  masturbate  in  the
diapers.  Applicant  denied  feeling  aroused  by  any  stimuli  other  than  the  diapers  (i.e.,
men,  women,  children,  naked  bodies,  breasts,  etc.).  He  repeatedly  denied  any  sexual
attraction to children.
Applicant  admitted  to  doing  many  internet  searches  for  diapers  and  viewing
images of children wearing diapers (at least once a week during a six-month period). He
denied that this images were of a sexual nature. He viewed the images because he is
sexually aroused by the diapers, and not who is wearing them. He unintendedly viewed
child  pornography  many  times  up  until  two  or  three  years  before  his  2019  mental
evaluation.  The  feeling  that  he  was  doing  something  wrong  when  he  searched  for
children in diapers became too much for him to ignore, and he has been trying to stop
his  behavior.  Applicant  repeatedly  explained  that  he  has  never  been  aroused  by
children or adults regardless of the sex, and he has never sought out child pornography.
His fixation is with the actual diapers.
Applicant experienced disgust and shame in response to the unintended viewing
of  child  pornography  and  immediately  discontinued  the  image  search.  To  stop
inadvertently accessing child pornography, he began viewing drawings of  children and
adults  wearing diapers while  dressed  in animal costumes (the  “furry community”).  The
drawings  and  he  “furry  community”  provide  him  with  gratification.  During  the  last  10
years, Applicant has been making a concerted effort to stay away from all children. He
does  not  want  to  put  himself  in  a  position  where  he  potentially  could  inappropriately
touch a child.
Applicant  experiences  significant  shame  and  anxiety  associated  with  his  sexual
predilections.  Only  his  brother,  Agency  and  DOD  investigators,  his  counsel,  DOHA
personnel,  and  some  of  his  mental  health  providers  are  aware  of  his  fetish.  Applicant
believes  that  his  participation  in  the  security  hearing  and  testifying  about  his  fetish
demonstrate  that  he  has  improved  substantially  managing  his  depression  and  anxiety
and  that  he  cannot  be  blackmailed  or  manipulated  by  someone  who  may  gain
knowledge  of  his  sexual  preferences.  He  promised  to  disclose  any  attempts  to
manipulate him to security officials and never to divulge classified information.
In  January 2019,  Applicant participated in a psychological  evaluation  performed
by Dr. E (a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in Psychology and a Health Service Provider in
Psychology  (HSPP)),  appointed  by  the  DOD  CAF.  Dr.  E  quickly  dismissed  initial
concerns about Applicant’s violent tendencies (thoughts of harming himself and others,
him being a psychopath), and at risk of substance addiction, by noting that there was no
data to support any of those possibilities.
Concerning  Applicant’s  diaper  fetish,  Dr.  E  noted  that  Applicant  has  limited
insight  about  his  fetish.  He  does  not  know  why  he  developed  the  interest  or  how  he
might  discontinue  the  behaviors.  Applicant  admitted  to  Dr.  E  that  he  viewed  child
pornography in the past, but credibly explained that he was looking only to see images
of diapers and never for the purpose of sexual gratification via images of children. Once
he became aware  and felt badly enough about  doing so, he  switched  to  searching for
images of drawings of children in diapers and images of people wearing diapers while
dressed in animal costumes.
In his evaluation report, Dr. E noted that his research suggests that there is only
a  weak  link  between  the  diaper fetish  and  pedophilia.  He  noted  that  “while  [Applicant]
does engage in atypical sexual behaviors, the data does not support concerns that he is
exhibiting signs and symptoms of pedophilia.”  There is no real evidence that Applicant
has pedophilic tendencies.
Dr. E noted a number of favorable factors found during the evaluation that  in his
opinion  mitigate  Applicant’s  difficult  psychological,  behavioral,  and  societal  problems.
He  has  been  working  for  his  employer  since  2012  without  incident.  His  supervisor
favorably  endorsed  Applicant  for  a  clearance.  Applicant  is  considered  to  be  a  rule
follower, and he would be the first to report something out of the ordinary, and the last to
violate security protocols.
Dr. E highlighted that Applicant has been engaging with mental health providers
for  many  years.  Applicant  first  sought  mental  health  care  when  he  was  15  or  16  for
anger  management  issues.  Dr.  E’s  mental  evaluation  report  quotes  the  DOD
investigative  report  indicating  that  he  was  seen  for  counseling  in  2008,  at  age  19.
Between  October  and  December 2016,  he  saw Dr.  V  for  anxiety,  depression,  and  the
diaper fetish.  He  then continued  treatment  with  MB  (a  licensed  professional counselor
(LPC) with a master’s degree in mental health (M.A.)) at the same practice, beginning in
June 2017 to an unknown date. Both Dr. V and MB reported to DOD investigators that
they  did  not  believe  Applicant  has  any  condition  that  could  impair  his  reliability,
judgment, or trustworthiness, and both assessed Applicant’s prognosis as fair. (GE 5)
While  in  counseling,  Applicant  also  consulted  with  Dr.  A  (psychiatrist)  between
October  and  November  2016.  Dr.  A  reported  to  DOD Investigators  that  in  his opinion,
Applicant  did  not  have  any  condition  that  could  impair  his  reliability,  judgment,  or
trustworthiness, and assessed Applicant’s prognosis as fair. (GE 5)
In  2017,  Applicant  participated  in  three  therapy  sessions  of  Eye  Movement
Desensitization  and  Reprocessing  (EMDR)  with  EL.  The  therapist  recommended
Applicant participate in a psychological evaluation. Dr. JC evaluated Applicant between
January and February 2017. Both EL and Dr. JC reported to DOD investigators that in
their  opinion,  Applicant  did  not  have  any  condition  that  could  impair  his  reliability,
judgment, or trustworthiness, and assessed Applicant’s prognosis as fair.
In the summer of 2018, Applicant started seeing Dr. MS (psychiatrist) and social
worker  DS  for  depression,  anxiety,  and  the  fetish.  Applicant  attended  weekly  therapy
sessions and was prescribed an anxiety medication with good results. In July 2019, DS
was  interviewed  by  Dr.  E  during  his  preparation  of  Applicant’s  mental  evaluation.  DS
stated that he had been treating Applicant for about a year. He described Applicant as a
hard  worker  and  a  rules  follower,  who  is  motivated  to  do  well  in  life.  In  DS’s  opinion,
Applicant  functions  well  enough  overall  that  he  does  not  believe  his  mental  health
affects his ability to  do  his job.  DS has  no concerns about  Applicant  having access  to
classified  information  or  working  in  a  secured  setting.  DS  believes  Applicant  was
making  good  progress  controlling  his  mental  health  symptoms  and  understanding  his
fetish. His medication had reduced his anxiety symptoms, and he has been consistent
in treatment.
DS noted Applicant experiences shame associated with his fetish because he is
aware that his desires and behavior are not considered normal. In his opinion, Applicant
would  be  horrified  if  information  about  his fetish  surfaced  publicly,  but  in  MS’s  opinion
Applicant  would  not  betray  his  country  or  divulge  sensitive  information  because  of  his
overriding rule-following tendencies. Applicant did not discuss with DS his arousal as a
result of viewing children wearing diapers until he was issued the SOR.
Dr. E diagnosed Applicant as follows: (GE 5)
F65.0 Fetishistic Disorder
F33.9 Major Depressive  Disorder, recurrent,  unspecified
F41.9  Anxiety  Disorder, unspecified (with signs of Generalized Anxiety, PRSD,
Panic, Agoraphobia, and  Social Anxiety)
He opined that Applicant’s prognosis is fair. Dr. E concluded that: “while he has a
number  of  important  behavioral  and  mental  health  challenges,  Applicant  has  enough
mitigating factors to conclude that his conditions do not negatively impact his judgment,
reliability,  and  trustworthiness  in  the  context  of  safeguarding  sensitive  information  and
working in a cleared setting.” (GE 5)
At  his hearing,  Applicant presented his own psychological  evaluation performed
by  a  licensed  psychologist,  Dr.  Y  (Ph.D.),  in  April  2001.  (AE  E)  Dr.  Y  diagnosed
Applicant with:
General Anxiety Disorder (300.02; F41.1)
Persistent Depressive  Disorder, with intermittent mayor depressive episode, with
current episode, moderate  (300.4; F34.1)
Fetishistic Disorder (302.81; F65.0)
Dr.  Y   recommended,  among   other
for
depression   and   anxiety   for   the   consistent  monitoring   of  Applicant’s  passive   suicidal
ideation;  continued   consulting   with   a   psychiatrist for   ongoing   medication   management;
and interpersonal effectiveness and social skills training.

things,
Dr. Y noted that Applicant repeatedly emphasized that he is not sexually aroused
by  children,  and  that  his  sexual  arousal  is  specific  to  diapers.  He  has  not  engaged  in
any sexual contact with a child, nor does he has the desire to do so. To avoid incidental
viewing of child pornography, Applicant has chosen to remove people from the process
entirely.  He  limits  his  behavior  to  wearing  diapers  himself,  sexually  interacting  with
diapers  (without  others  present),  and  viewing  diaper-related  pornographic  cartoons
typical of the “furry community” (not involving people). (AE E)
Applicant submitted a written declaration by DS, a licensed clinical social worker
with  a  master’s  degree.  DS  has  provided  therapy  to  Applicant  for  depression  and
anxiety  disorder from  2018  to  present.  In  his  opinion,  Applicant  has  learned  and  used
new  coping  skills  that  have  improved  his  depression  and  anxiety.  He  believes  that
Applicant’s  willingness  to  put  himself  through  the  investigation  and  clearance  process
speaks  to  his  improvement  with  his  anxiety  and  depression.  He  noted  that  from  the
beginning, Applicant has fully participated and attended all scheduled therapy sessions.
DS  stated  that  Applicant  has  been  apprehensive  about  joining  websites  that
focus on fetishes due to his understanding of the cyber world that this information would
be  seen  by  anyone  looking  for  him.  He  stated  that  he  wanted  to  stay  off  the  grid.  DS
stated  that  he  trusts Applicant  with  the  security of  the  United  States  and  recommends
him for a clearance. (AE D)
Applicant’s  manager  and  team  lead  provided  a  declaration  in  support  of
Applicant.  He  has  known  Applicant since 2012, and has been his direct  supervisor for
the last four years. He has never observed Applicant engage in any conduct that would
jeopardize  national  security  or  the  security  of  the  company’s  products.  In  his  opinion,
Applicant  is  one  of  the  hardest  working,  most  responsible  and  supportive  people  he
works  with.  He  is  of  high  character  and  sound  moral  judgment.  He  has  not  seen
anything in his actions, behavior, or emotions that would lead him to believe Applicant
should  not  be  given  a  clearance.  He fully  trust  Applicant  and  confidently  recommends
his eligibility for a clearance. He is unaware of Applicant’s fetish. (AE D)
Applicant  submitted  a  declaration  from  another  engineering  manager,  PB,  who
has  known  Applicant since  2012,  and has worked  with  him for the  last nine years. He
trusts Applicant to use his sound judgment to enhance the security of the products they
build.  In  his  opinion,  Applicant  takes  security  seriously.  He  has  never  witnessed  any
inappropriate  behaviors.  In  his  opinion,  Applicant  is  reliable,  trustworthy,  and  displays
sound  judgment.  He  trusts  Applicant  with  the  security  of  the  United  States  and

violations (SOR ¶¶ 1.i and 1.j).
SOR ¶  1.a  was cross-alleged  under Guideline  D (sexual behavior); and  SOR  ¶¶
1.a  –  1.j,  were cross-alleged  under Guideline  E  (personal  conduct).  Applicant admitted  all
of  the  SOR  allegations,  with  explanations,  except  for  the  December 2008  reckless  driving
incident (SOR ¶  1.c.), which he could not recall.
Applicant explained the circumstances of his criminal charges and motor vehicle
violations in his Answer to the SOR and in his personal subject interview (PSI) conducted
by  a  Government  investigator.  The  gravest  charge,  and  one  that  is  alleged  under
Guidelines  J,  D,  and  E,  is  the  2007  charge  of  felony  criminal  abduction  by  force,
intimidation or deception, and misdemeanor sexual battery by force or helplessness. The
Government’s evidence in the FORM includes Applicant’s statements and an FBI record
showing the felony charge was nolle prossed, while he was convicted of misdemeanor
assault  and  battery.  No  police  records  or  contemporaneous  witness  statements  were
provided  in  the  record,  and  neither  Department  Counsel  nor  Applicant  requested  a
hearing.
Applicant  explained that  in  2007,  while  he  was  in  high  school,  he and a female
student had engaged in “consensual” touching with each other over their clothes while in
private. He was 19 years old at the time, while she was under 18. On another occasion,
they  were  walking  to  a  bus  stop  after  school  while  Applicant  and  she  were  “horsing
around” and teasing. Applicant tried to convince her to stay with him until the bus arrived
by  pulling  on  her  arm  in  a  “kidding”  way,  but  “not  physically  harming”  her.  After  she
returned home, she told her father about the touching and their behavior at the bus stop.
The girl’s father called the school, and Applicant was called to the school resource officer
and  arrested.  Applicant  appeared  in  court  and  pleaded  guilty  to  a  reduced  charge  of
misdemeanor  assault  and  battery.  Applicant  stated  that  he  received  a  12-month
suspended sentence and was put on supervised probation until he left for active duty in
the Marine Corps. Since that time, Applicant served about five years in the Marine Corps
and held a security clearance. Applicant averred in his Answer that this offense occurred
14 years ago, and that he and the girl were classmates and they “fooled around a lot.” He
believes that her parents were unhappy with the relationship since the girl was under 18
years old, and reported their activity to the school. No similar incidents have been reported
since.
The  other  serious  charges  involved  misdemeanor  possession  of  a  concealed
handgun in a car, without a permit in 2015 and 2019. The 2015 incident resulted from a
traffic  stop  when  the  officer  asked  Applicant  if  he  had  a  weapon  in  the  car.  Applicant
answered affirmatively, and showed the officer the handgun between the center console
and the driver’s seat and asserted that it was not concealed. The officer disagreed, and
Applicant was cited, but the charge was eventually dismissed. The 2019 incident occurred
when Applicant forgot he had a handgun under the driver’s seat after leaving a shooting
range the night before. He put the gun there while  he stopped at a convenience store
because he could not legally carry it into the store without a concealed handgun permit
and he did not want it visible in the car. The following day, he was stopped for having dark
tint on his window. Applicant stated that he showed the officer a doctor’s note permitting
the tinted windows, and he was free to go. However, before he left, the officer asked him
if  he  had  a  weapon  in  the  car  and  Applicant  said  no,  having  forgotten  it  was  there.
Applicant consented to allow the officer to search the car, and the gun was found under
the seat. Applicant was cited, but this charge was also dismissed. Applicant stated that
he  obtained  a  state  concealed  handgun  permit  after  the  2019  incident.  In  his  state,  a
county district court judge issues the permit after a background check is conducted.
I take administrative notice of  laws in Applicant’s state  regarding the possession
and transport of handguns and the issuance of concealed carry permits. Generally, the
state law in question permits the “open” carry of handguns without a permit (provided it
has a magazine capacity of 20 rounds or less, is not designed to accommodate a silencer,
or does not have a folding stock), by any person over 18 years old. A weapon is deemed
to be hidden from common observation when it is observable but is of  such deceptive
appearance as to disguise the weapon's true nature. Typically, in a vehicle, a firearm may
be  considered  ""openly  carried""  if  the  firearm  is  openly  visible.  Generally,  a  permit  is
required to carry a concealed firearm in the state, including in a vehicle. A pistol may be
transported  concealed,  without  a  permit,  if  a  person  is  at,  or  going  to  or  from,  an
established shooting range, provided that the weapon is unloaded and securely wrapped
while being transported. The facts in the record are insufficient to draw legal conclusions
regarding Applicant’s firearms activity or criminal charges.
Applicant  generally  explained  the  circumstances  behind  most  of  the  traffic
violations,  and  stated  that  since  2014,  he  has  matured  and  become  a  safer  driver,
watches for other drivers, obeys speed limits and signs, and cares for other people on the
road. Applicant acknowledged that his past irresponsible actions put others on the road
in danger. Applicant also noted that he gets migraine headaches from a bright sun, so he
had his windows tinted. Once he learned that he needed a doctor’s prescription for tinted
windows, he obtained one. In addition, since he unknowingly paid a loud exhaust ticket
online without challenging it, he has had another citation dismissed after showing that the
exhaust system on his car is stock.

"Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a through 1.i, 1.l, 1.m, and 2.a. He
denied the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.j, 1.k, and 3.a. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is 30  years old.  He married in 2012.  His wife has two  children from a
previous marriage and relationship. Applicant adopted his wife’s younger child. He  and
his wife have two biological children ages seven and six. He served in the military from
2010 until he was administratively processed in 2014 for serious misconduct and received
a  general  discharge  under  honorable  conditions.  Applicant  has  worked  for  a  federal
contractor since 2016.
Applicant’s  wife’s  eldest  daughter’s  (Daughter  E)  biological  father  is  deceased.
Daughter E was adopted by Applicant’s wife’s former husband when they were married.
When they divorced, the father did not want to be part of Daughter E’s life or pay child
support for her. The judge required someone to be financially responsible for  the child
before  severing  parental  rights  and  responsibilities.  Daughter  E  was  adopted  by  her
grandparents in 2010, when she was ten years old. Daughter E had a close relationship
with her grandparents.
Applicant was 20 years old when he married his wife in 2012. She is nine years
older than Applicant. Daughter E was about 11 years old at the time they married. The
younger child was five years old. Daughter E lived with Applicant and her mother after
they married.
In September 2014, when Daughter E was 14 years old, Applicant’s command was
notified  by  Family  Advocacy  that  Daughter  E  had  reported  that  Applicant  sexually
assaulted her. An investigation was conducted. Daughter E reported the sexual assault
to counselors at a hospital where she was a patient due to cutting her wrists and suicidal
behavior. Daughter E reported that on one occasion, at their on-base residence, Applicant
placed  his  hand  down  her  pants,  under  her  panties,  and  touched  her  vagina.  She
explained that while she and Applicant were wrestling, he “pinned” her while she was on
her back and he was on top of her. He slid his hands down the front of her jeans and
inside her panties. He did not penetrate her. She stated that he had also attempted to
kiss her on multiple occasions and walked around the house naked. On one occasion,
after she witnessed him naked, he sent her a text message that read “Your Welcome ;)”
It had a “winking face” emoji next to the phrase. (GE 6)
A licensed clinical counselor from the hospital where Daughter E was a patient,
stated that Daughter E told her about Applicant putting his hands down her pants while
they were wrestling, but did not mention whether Applicant had placed his hands under
her panties. Daughter E told the counselor that Applicant walked around the house naked.
Daughter  E  did  not  discuss  with  the  counselor  that  Applicant  attempted  to  kiss  her.
Daughter E told the counselor that Applicant told her that he was falling in love with her.
The counselor opined that Daughter E’s suicide ideations and depression were more than
likely  resulting  from  Applicant’s  actions  and  their  relationship.  A  search  of  Applicant’s
phone confirmed the text message stating “Your Welcome ;).” (GE 6)
Applicant  was  advised  of  his  rights  by  investigators  and  admitted  that  he
intentionally put his hands down Daughter E’s pants after she fell on her back between
the  couch  and  wall  inside  the  residence’s  living  room.  He  admitted  sending  the  text
message after Daughter E saw him naked. He also stated that he accidentally touched
Daughter E’s breast on one occasion. (GE 6)
In February 2015, after consulting with an attorney, Applicant waived his right to a
court-martial and accepted Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) Article 15 nonjudicial
punishment. He was charged with violation of UCMJ Article 120b:
You, did at or near [military base], between on or about June 28, 2012 and
on or about 13 September 2014, commit a lewd act upon [Daughter E], a
child  who  had  not attained  the  age of  16  years, to  wit:  placed  your hand
down the front of her pants and inside her underwear.
You, did, at or near [military base], on or about 15 August 2014, commit a
lewd act upon [Daughter E], a child who had not attained the age of 16 years
old, to wit: exposed your genitalia to Daughter E. (GE 6)
Applicant chose not to have a personal appearance before the Commander at his
UCMJ Article 15 hearing, but rather submitted a written presentation. It was not provided
at  this  hearing.  The  Commander  found  Applicant  committed  the  offenses.  Applicant
appealed the Article 15, which was denied. The proceeding went through the appropriate
reviews and was found to be in compliance with the Manual for Courts-Martial. Applicant
was awarded a reduction in rate, 30 days extra duties, and a written reprimand. (GE 6)
Applicant  was  administratively processed for discharge from the service  in  April
2015 in the paygrade E-2. He received a general discharge under honorable conditions.
The narrative reason for separation was “misconduct (serious offense).” (AE P)
Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  government  investigator  as  part  of  his  security
clearance  background  investigation.  He  told  the  investigator  that  he  did  not  purposely
expose himself. He admitted that he may have inappropriately touched Daughter E  by
accident when they were playing and tickling, and she kicked him away.  He stated he
sleeps naked, and when the children are asleep he will walk around the house naked. He
admitted sending the text to Daughter E, but said it was a joke. He was confronted with
whether he tried to kiss Daughter E, and he said only in a parental way and not in a sexual
way. He said he felt the service investigators pressured him into changing certain words
in his statement,  such  as “accidentally” to  “intentionally.”  He stated he was required to
attend  five  or  six  counseling  sessions  through  Family  Advocacy  before  he  was
discharged.
In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he stated that he sought counseling soon after
the incident, as he was under immense pressure to provide for his family, continue his
military service, and navigate the military justice system. He said Daughter E had come
back to live with the family. He stated:
Since then this has been and will be the only incident to occur. Looking back
I  realize  my  mistakes  and  attribute  my  shortcomings  to  my  lack  of
experience as a father figure do (sic) to my marriage at a young age as well
as my lack of understanding for investigation proceedings, in which at the
time of the incident declined a lawyer and was as compliant as I could be. I
felt  a  lot  of  pressure  from  all  around.  I  understand  the  importance  of
maintaining  the  role  of  father  and  aim  to  continue  the  role  to  the  highest
standards.  My  behavior  was  inappropriate  and  I  have  grown  as  a  father,
husband and person as a whole. I will continue to build myself and ensure
there is no future incident.
I deny criminal allegations specified in [SOR] Item #3a. While my behavior
may  have  been  of  serious  concern,  no  criminal  charges  were  file[d]  in  a
military or civilian court. (Answer to SOR)
At his hearing, Applicant denied he intentionally exposed himself to Daughter E.
He said he got out of the shower and assumed the children were sleeping. He was naked
when he saw Daughter E. He admitted he sent her the text with a “winking face” emoji.
He said he was being sarcastic and joking. He testified it was not appropriate. He stated
that he never intentionally put his hand down Daughter E’s pants, but it was possible he
inadvertently  “touched  her  waistband.”  He  said  they  “hung  out”  and  tickled  and
roughhoused with each other. He recalled roughhousing with her once and she kicked
him  and  stormed  off.  Applicant  stated  Daughter  E  had  behavioral  problems.  She  was
attending counseling at that time.
Applicant testified that he was afforded a right to consult with an attorney prior to
accepting Article 15 nonjudicial punishment. At the time, he and his wife were separated.
He had two small children that he had not seen. He said he was under a lot of pressure.
Child Protective Services was involved. He stated this was a “period of regret” and he has
grown from it. He now understands the limitations of a father and certain lines must be
drawn.  He  testified  none  of  his  acts  were  intentional.  He  and  his  wife  have  since
reconciled. Daughter E was sent to live with her grandparents.
Applicant  testified  that  a  few  years  later  he  and  his  wife  discussed  Daughter  E
returning to live with them. He stated that he had reservations, but agreed to it. He knew
he  had  a  “clear line.” He  changed  his  behavior around  Daughter E  and  was cautious.  She
is now married,  and he attended  her wedding.
After being discharged from the service, Applicant was unemployed for a period
and had financial difficulties. Between 2015 and 2017, he and his family relocated several
times  looking  for  job  opportunities.  They  eventually  decided  to  put  roots  down  in  their
current location. From April 2015 to November 2016, Applicant worked overseas and sent
money home to support his family. (GE 1)
Applicant’s wife testified that she was responsible for the family’s finances.  After
their  last  move,  Applicant  has  been  more  involved  with  their  finances.  Their  federal
income  tax  returns  were  timely  filed  for  2015  and  2016.  She  believed  that  Applicant’s
income that was earned overseas was not taxable. She said she was led to believe this
as she processed their tax return through TurboTax. In approximately 2018, they were
notified by the IRS that they owed income taxes. They did not have the money to pay the
amount  owed  at  that  time. They  were  in  contact  with  the  IRS frequently  over  the  past
several years. She estimated about 30 times.
SOR  ¶  1.m  alleges  a federal tax  debt  of  $18,490  for  tax  years  2015  and  2016.
Applicant  provided  a  copy  of  a  July  2019  installment  agreement  with  the  IRS,  which
required he pay $150 a month for income tax owed for tax years 2015 and 2016, to begin
in September 2019. Applicant provided documents to show he made the payments from
September 2019 through January 2020, and March 2020. In June 2020, the IRS received
notification that Applicant filed bankruptcy and in August 2020 the installment agreement
was canceled. There is no record of a new installment agreement. Applicant made $100
payments to the IRS in December 2020, January 2021, March 2021, and April 2021. In
August  2021,  he  made  a  $500  payment.  Through  the  years,  Applicant’s  income  tax
refunds have been involuntarily captured and applied to non-IRS debts and also toward
balances owed to the IRS. Tax transcripts also reflect that certain amounts owed were
“written  off”  by  the  IRS.  Applicant  provided  a  copy  of  his  2020  federal  tax  return  that
reflects an anticipated refund of $7,495. His tax return is being processed. He anticipates
this  refund  will  be  applied  to  his  delinquent  tax  debt  and  he  will  have  a  remaining
outstanding balance of $785. (GE 3, AE M; Answer to the SOR)
Applicant testified that he was aware of some of his delinquent debts, but thought
some would fall off their credit report. After his discharge from the service, money was
tight. In 2019, after he received the SOR, he became aware of other delinquent debts. He
spoke with a lawyer, who was not aware of his security clearance issues. He was advised
to file bankruptcy and not pay his debts. He was led to believe  the IRS debt would be
resolved through bankruptcy. After receiving other advice, he was made aware  his tax
debt would  not be resolved  through bankruptcy.  The bankruptcy was  dismissed  at  the
request of Applicant. Many of the debts alleged in the SOR have been delinquent since
2013, 2014, or 2015. After receipt of  the SOR in August 2019, Applicant  began taking
action. He withdrew money from his pension plan to pay the debts, which he determined
would be his best option.
Applicant received a tax form 1099-C for tax year 2018 for the credit card debt in
SOR ¶ 1.a ($6,605). It is unknown if this amount was included in his tax return for 2018.
(AE A, AE M; Answer to the SOR).
In September 2019, Applicant received confirmation that the debt alleged in SOR
¶ 1.b ($5,520) was satisfied in full with the creditor. (AE B; Answer to the SOR)
Applicant  provided  a  document  from  May  2018  showing  a  zero  balance  for  the
student loan alleged in SOR ¶ 1.c ($3,392). It appears this debt may have been paid by
the capture of his federal tax refund. (AE C; AE M; Answer to SOR)
Applicant settled the collection account in SOR ¶ 1.d ($2,488) in August 2019. He
satisfied  the  collection  account  in  SOR  ¶  1.e  ($2,370)  in  October  2019.  (AE  D,  AE  E;
Answer to the SOR)
Applicant stated in his answer that the debt in SOR ¶ 1.f ($278) was charged off.
He contacted the creditor and made a payment of $20 toward the balance of the debt. He
provided a copy of the money order. At his hearing, he provided a letter from the creditor
dated July 2021 indicating that it was no longer attempting to collect the debt, and the
amount was being written off. (AE F; Answer to the SOR)
Applicant satisfied the collection account in SOR ¶ 1.g ($231) in September 2019.
He paid in full the collection account in SOR ¶ 1.h ($2,433) in October 2019. (AE G, AE
H; Answer to the SOR)
Applicant settled the debt in SOR ¶ 1.i ($1,746) for $725 in August 2019. Applicant
noted that the debts in SOR ¶¶ 1.i and 1.j were duplicates. I concur. Applicant stated that
he was unable to find the creditor on his credit reports for the debt alleged in SOR ¶ 1.k
($558).  His  attorney  sent  a  letter  to  the  creditor  in  July 2021  requesting  it  validate  the
debt. Applicant paid the outstanding balance owed on the collection account in SOR ¶ 1.l
($377). (AE I, AE J, AE K; Answer to the SOR)
Applicant  provided a  copy of  a budget.  He provided  military service  evaluations
from 2010 to 2015 that noted he was above average or truly among the best among his
peers. He provided a character letter from his mother-in-law who describe him as a good
husband  and  father,  hardworking,  patient,  kind,  trustworthy,  honest,  and  responsible.
Character  letters  from  coworkers  describe  him  as  well-liked  with  a  good  reputation,
talented, reliable, responsible, nice, professional, honest, and trustworthy. (AE O, AE Q,

"Applicant is a 40-year-old single man with two children, ages 15 and 10. He was
married previously from 2003 to 2008. The marriage ended in divorce. Applicant served in
the  U.S.  Navy from  1999  to  2005.  He  was  released  from  active  duty under honorable
conditions. (Answer, Enclosure (Enc.) 1 at 2) He served in the U.S. Navy Reserve from
2005 to 2007. Applicant has been working for his employer in the engineering and design
division since 2005. (Answer, Enc.1 at 2)
Applicant’s then  wife  was hospitalized  on  July  3, 2008  after she  became  depressed
and  suicidal. Applicant’s 13-year-old sister-in-law  agreed  to  stay  in his home  and  take  care
of  his daughter while  he  was at work. On  the  evening  of  July  5, 2008, Applicant visited  his
then  wife  in the  hospital, then  went out with  friends until about 11:30  pm, before returning
home.  After arriving  home, he  and  his sister-in-law  began  talking. (Tr. 25) During  their
conversation, his sister-in-law  mentioned  that her parents let  her drink alcohol. Applicant
then  went to  the  freezer,  retrieved  some  alcohol, and  began  preparing  drinks.   He  gave  her
two  drinks. The  first was a  mixture of  vodka  and  Mountain  Dew.  The  next  drink  he  prepared
her was nicknamed  “liquid cocaine,” and  consisted  of  a  combination  of  Jagermeister, gold
schlagger, rumple minze  (a brand  of  peppermint  schnapps), and  151-proof Bacardi. (Tr.
26) He testified that he did not intend to get her intoxicated. (Tr. 27)
At or about the time Applicant and his 13-year-old sister-in-law began consuming
alcohol, the conversation turned to sexual matters. He asked her to remove her clothing
and she complied. (Answer, Enc. 1 at 2) Applicant then removed his clothing and began
touching her body with his hands and mouth. Applicant stopped short of sexual intercourse
when he realized that what he was doing was wrong. His sister-in-law slept on the living
room sofa and left his home on the following day. (Answer, Enc. 1 at 2-3)
On July 22, 2008, Applicant was arrested and charged with indecent liberties with a
child by a custodian and aggravated sexual battery. (GE 2 at 26) In November 2008, the
charge of aggravated sexual battery was disposed of by nolle prosequi. In January 2009,
Applicant  was  indicted  for  indecent  liberties  with  a  child  by  a  custodian,  a  felony.  He
pleaded  guilty  in  March  2009.  In  May  2009,  he  was  sentenced  to  confinement  for  12
months (suspended for 12 months), and placed on supervised probation for ten years. The
sentencing order required him to register as a sex offender and to have no contact with
anyone under the age of 18 without supervision. (Answer, Enc. 1 at 3) Moreover, Applicant
was placed on the state’s sex offender list. (Answer, Enc. 1 at 3)
In August 2008, while awaiting trial, Applicant voluntarily contacted a certified sex
offender treatment provider. (Answer, Enc. 1 at 3) Applicant started individual therapy in
September  2008  and  group  therapy  in  May  2009.  He  completed  his  therapy  in  late
November 2009 and participated in an aftercare program from December 2009 to May
2010.  His  diagnosis  upon  discharge  from  the  program  was  depressive  disorder,  not
otherwise specified; impulse control disorder, not otherwise specified; and sexual abuse of
a child. His risk of recurrence was assessed as “low provided he uses what he has learned
in treatment.” (Answer, Enc. 4 at 2) In September 2010, the court released Applicant from
probation early for good behavior. (AE A)
In his answer to the first SOR, Applicant stated that his misconduct with his sister-in-
law occurred while he was under great emotional pressure, dealing with his then wife’s
bipolar disorder and attempts to kill herself. (Answer, Enc. 4 at 4) At the first hearing, he
testified that he acquired skills during his therapy that help him cope with stress, and that
he has a network of friends, including his rabbi whom he can depend upon for support
when needed.
After Applicant’s first ISCR hearing, the judge credited him for being remorseful
about  his  conduct,  voluntarily  seeking  treatment,  and  informing  his  employer  and  the
members of his faith community about his crime. However, the judge concluded that it was
too soon to conclude that he had mitigated the security concerns, given the impulse control
diagnosis and the recency of the conduct. (Answer, Enc. 1 at 9)

Applicant used marijuana a number of times between about 2007 and 2009. He
did not use marijuana again until 2014. He smoked marijuana once or twice from about
October 2014 to June 2015. (Tr. at 14; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 4, 5)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
May 2015 in conjunction with his job offer. He intentionally failed to report his marijuana
use.  He  explained  that  he  filled  out  the  SF  86  on  his  parents’  computer  with  their
assistance. His parents are very religious, and he did not want them to know about his
marijuana  use.  He  also  admitted  that  it  was  the  only  job  offer  he  received,  and  he
thought that it could affect the job offer if he revealed his marijuana use.  (Tr. at 19-20,
28-30; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 5)
Applicant received his security clearance in 2015. He continued to use marijuana
on  an  irregular  basis.  He  used  psilocybin  mushrooms  in  October  2016.  He  used
marijuana  at  the  same  time,  which  was  the  last  time  he  used  any  illegal  controlled
substances. (Tr. at 14-17, 30; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2-5)
Applicant  interviewed  for  a  position  with  another  company  in  July  2017.  The
position  required  a  top  secret  clearance  and  eligibility  for  access  to  sensitive
compartmented information (SCI). It was at that time that Applicant realized the gravity
of his actions. He looked at brochures from his company, and he discovered he had an
affirmative  duty  to  self-report  his  marijuana  and  mushroom  use.  He  held  off  until
October 2017 in order to complete a program, and he then self-reported his illegal drug
use to his facility security officer (FSO), who reported it to the DOD. He also indicated
that he delayed his self-reporting because he was afraid of losing his job and going to
jail. (Tr. at 30-31, 34; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3, 5)
Applicant submitted  another SF  86  at his FSO’s request  in  November  2017.  He
fully reported his illegal drug use. He reported that he used marijuana in total less than
20 times. His description of his drug use has been consistent when he was interviewed
for  his  background  investigation  in  2018,  in  his  reply  to  DOD  interrogatories,  in  his
response  to  the  SOR,  and  at  his  hearing.  Applicant  also  told  the  background
investigator that he paid for the services of prostitutes in Mexico in 2015 and 2016. (Tr.
at 14-15, 17-18, 31-33; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 4, 5)
Applicant’s  security  clearance  was  suspended  in  about  December  2017.  In  his
July 2019 reply to DOD interrogatories, he admitted that he engaged the services of a
prostitute  in  Amsterdam  in  June  2019.  (Tr.  at  17-19,  31-34;  Applicant’s  response  to
SOR; GE 4, 5)
Applicant  was  evaluated  in  December  2020  by  a  licensed  clinical  social  worker
(LCSW), who is also a certified substance abuse counselor, among other qualifications.
She  tested  Applicant  and  interviewed  him.  She  also  had  access  to  the  SOR.  They
discussed  his  substance  abuse  and  interactions  with  prostitutes.  She  concluded  that
there was no diagnosis, and that “[b]ased upon all information available to [her],” it was
her opinion that “[Applicant]  is not at risk of  relapse or return to  his previous behavior.”
(AE A, B)
There  are  inconsistencies  between  Applicant’s  statements  about  his  drug  use
and involvement with prostitutes before and during his hearing and his statements to the
LCSW about those events. She reported that Applicant told her that he used marijuana
twice in 2007 and in the fall of 2008. He did not use marijuana again for about six years
until  2014,  when  he  used  it  once.  He  told  her  that  he  used  it  again  with  psilocybin
mushrooms  in  2016  while  visiting  a  friend  in  a  state  that  had  made  marijuana  legal
under  state  law.  She  stated  in  her  report:  “[Applicant]  reported  that  after  the  trip  to
[State]  he  made  the  conscious  decision  that  he  was  never  going  to  use  substances
again. He returned home and self-reported to his security officer at work.” Regarding his
involvement with prostitutes, she wrote: “[Applicant] received a manual stimulation after
a  legitimate  massage.  However,  the  two  subsequent  engagements  with  paid  sexual
activities  were  not  consum[matt]ed.” This  is  inconsistent  with  his testimony  that  two  of
the encounters involved masturbation and the third involved “oral sex.” (Tr. At 35-37; AE
A)
Applicant stated that he does not intend to use illegal drugs or solicit prostitutes
in  the  future.  He  passed  drug  tests  in  December  2020  and  July  2021.  He  provided  a
signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse,
acknowledging  that  any  future  involvement  or  misuse  is  grounds  for  revocation  of
national security eligibility. He has minimal contact with individuals who use drugs, and
he  will  leave  if  he  finds  himself  in  a  place  where  drugs  are  present.  He  informed  his
fiancée  of  his  drug  use  and  involvement  with  prostitutes.  (Tr.  at  15-17,  19,  23-24,  27;
Applicant’s response to SOR; AE C-E)
Applicant  volunteers  in  his  community.  He  submitted  documents  and  letters
attesting  to  his  excellent  job  performance  and  moral  character.  He  is  praised  for  his
reliability, trustworthiness, loyalty, dependability, responsibility, and honesty. (AE H-J, L)

"Applicant is 47 years old, and married to his third wife. She has two children, ZS
and NS. He has a bachelor’s degree. Applicant is employed by a defense contractor as
an insider threat analyst and is seeking to obtain national security eligibility for a security
clearance. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, 17, and 18; Tr. 45-47.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline D, Sexual Behavior)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because he engaged in sexual behavior that reflects a lack of judgment, or may subject
Applicant to undue influence or coercion.
1.a.  Applicant  denied   this  allegation,  which  concerned   his  alleged   inappropriate
conduct with his minor stepdaughter, EM, from 2012 to  2014.
Applicant  served  in  the  Air  Force  for  24  years,  retiring  in  2017  with  the  rank  of
master sergeant (E-7). He was a member of the Air Force Office of Special Investigations
(AFOSI) for the majority of his career, including when these alleged incidents happened.
(Applicant Exhibits C, D, E, F, G, and H; Tr. 47-48.)
Applicant was married to his second wife, RL, from March 2013 to May 2015. Her
daughter is EM. She has two other children, AC and LC. All three of the children  lived
with Applicant and RL during the time of their marriage. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section
17.)
On June 10, 2015, RL reported to the local police authorities that EM had been
sexually assaulted. This original report concerned people other than the  Applicant, and
occurred at a time after Applicant and RL were divorced. (Applicant Exhibit R.)
EM  was subsequently  interviewed  at  a  child  advocacy  center on  June  11,  2015.
During  the  interview  she  first discussed  the  sexual assault that had  recently  occurred  to
her. She then went on  to discuss the Applicant.  The report stated in  part:
[EM] reported that her  ex step-dad  [sic], [Applicant], sexually abused her in
2014. She  stated  that he  touched  her when  her mom  was out of  town  for
work. [EM] reported  that it happened  more than  one  time. She  stated  that
[Applicant]  would rub  on  her thighs and  try  to  “finger”  her.  [EM] reported  that
[Applicant]  would rub  her genitalia  on  the  inside  and  outside  of  her pants.
[EM] reported  that one  time  they  were watching  a  movie when  [Applicant]
put his hand  in her pants.  She  stated  that  [Applicant]  inserted  his fingers on
the   inside   of  her   vagina.   [EM]   reported   that   [Applicant]   pulled   his  pants
down, showed  her his  penis and  asked  her to  touch  it.  She  stated  that she
told  him   “no”.  .  .   .  She   indicated   that  there   was  another  time   where
[Applicant]  digitally  penetrated  her anally  and  vaginally. [EM] reported  that
[Applicant]  looked  at her, told her that he  should not have  done  that and  not
to  tell  her mom. . . . [EM] reported  that some  of  the  incidents happened  on
the  couch  in  the  living  room.  She  stated  that  her siblings would be  in  their
bedrooms. She  stated  that  she  told  her  mom  and  [AM].  [EM] reported  that
[Applicant]  would act  inappropriately  around  her and  [AM].  She  stated  that
[Applicant]  would “smack” her and  [AM]’s buttocks randomly. . .  . She  stated
that he touched her on the inside of  her pants when she would sleep in the
bed  with  him. [EM] reported  that [Applicant]  told her he  made  a  mistake  and
not to  tell  her mom. She  stated  that  she  still  told  her mom.  [EM]  reported
that [Applicant]  and  her mom  convinced  her that it was a  dream  and  that it
did not actually  happen. She  stated  that  the  last  time  anything  happened
was  while   her  mom   was  in  the   hospital  which  was  around   her  mom’s
birthday.  [EM]  reported   that  her  mom’s  birthday   is  October  12th   2014.
(Applicant Exhibit R  at 21-24.)
The   police   forwarded   the   case   to   the   county   prosecuting   attorney’s  office.   That
office declined  to  prosecute  the  case  due  to  “inability  to  sustain a  conviction.” (Applicant
Exhibit Q.)
Subsequent to the declination of prosecution the local police turned the case over
to  the  AFOSI  for  their  investigation.  Applicant  had  been  temporarily  assigned  to  the
Inspector General’s office during  the  pendency of the investigation. AFOSI began their
investigation  on  September  17,  2015.  AFOSI  re-interviewed  RL,  which  basically
confirmed  what  EM  had  told  the  local  authorities.  AFOSI  did  not  re-interview  EM.
(Applicant Exhibit N.)
AFOSI interviewed AM, a step niece of Applicant. She was 17 at the time of the
alleged acts. The report stated:
An  interview  of  VICTIM  [AM] disclosed  that she  moved  in with  the  [Applicant
and  RL]  before her senior year in High  School (2014), and  lived  with  them
for  about  a   year.  One   day   (NFI;  VICTIM   [AM]  could   not  recall   the   date),
VICTIM  [EM]  came   to   her  in  tears  and   told   her  [Applicant]   touched   her
inappropriately  on  the  couch  in the  living  room. VICTIM [EM] said [Applicant]
was  touching   her  stomach   and   eventually   touched   her  “boobs.”  VICTIM
[EM] told  her [Applicant]  would go  into  VICTIM [EM]’s room  at night when
her mother was working  and  touch  her when  she  pretended  to  be  asleep.
VICTIM [EM] told  [RL] who  convinced  her it was just  bad  dreams. VICTIM
[AM]  described   she   felt  uncomfortable  around   [Applicant],   and   he
inappropriately smacked her buttocks. (Applicant Exhibit N  at 5-6, 11-12.)
EM  also  confided  in  another  girl,  ES.  ES  was  also  interviewed  by  AFOSI.  The
interview was reported as follows:
[ES] stated  that VICTIM  [EM] visited  her residence  after being  released  from
the  hospital. . . . VICTIM  [EM] stated  she  wanted  to  speak with  ES. VICTIM
[EM]  started   tearing   up   and   told  [ES]   that   when   she   lived   at  the   first
residence, [Applicant] touched  her legs, her buttocks, and  gave  “weird” hugs
that  she  did  not like  on  several occasions.  VICTIM [EM] then  demonstrated
how   [Applicant]   touched   her  thigh   and   “slapped   her  butt.”  (Agent  Note:
During  this portion  of the  interview, [ES] placed  her right hand  in the  area
between   her   right  hip   and   knee   indicating   where  VICTIM   [EM]   stated
[Applicant] touched her.)
[ES]  told  her  mother  what  VICTIM  [EM]  shared  with  her  and  as  a  result,
[ES]’s mother told [RL]. A few days later, [ES] and VICTIM [EM] talked about
the incident again. VICTIM [EM] asked [ES] if she told [RL] about what she
shared with her and [ES] said that she told her mother due to the severity
of the incident. [ES] then asked VICTIM [EM] if the incident really happened.
VICTIM [EM] stated, “Yeah, but no, because  I didn’t want anyone else to
know.” (Applicant Exhibit N at 16-17.)
It is noted that AM stated during the investigation that she did not believe EM about
Applicant because EM has been untruthful in the past. The mother of ES also stated that
she did not believe RL  or EM because, “they  did not know  the  difference  between  the
truth and a lie.” Evidence was introduced that RL had made unfounded sexual misconduct
allegations against another former husband. (Applicant Exhibit N at 11-12, and 17, Exhibit
V; Tr. 78.)
Applicant  called  two  witnesses  during  his  case.  In  addition  to  providing  positive
recommendations regarding Applicant, further discussed below, the reputation of RL and
EM for truth and veracity was also discussed.
One of the witnesses is a serving deputy sheriff in the county where the alleged
incidents took place. He is a retired AFOSI agent and has known Applicant, RL and EM.
He  had  a  very  negative  view  of  the  veracity  of  RL  and  EM.  The  witness  considers
Applicant a close friend. (Tr. 20-31.)
The  second  witness  is a  former  Air  Force  non-commissioned  officer in  the  medical
field. She  is also a  friend  of  Applicant’s. Applicant lived  in her house  for a  year after his
divorce  from   RL.  The   witness  does  not  believe   the   allegations  made   by   EM   against
Applicant.  She  believes  Applicant   to  be   trustworthy   and   someone   that   she   has   trusted
with her children. (Tr. 31-43.)
After the   AFOSI  investigation   the   Air   Force preferred   charges  against   Applicant
under Article 120(b) of the  Uniform  Code  of  Military  Justice  (UCMJ). The  specifications
under the  charge  consisted  of two  counts  of  Sexual Assault of a  Child, and  two  counts of
Sexual Abuse of a Child. They were all connected to Applicant’s conduct with EM.
Pursuant  to   the   UCMJ  an   Article   32   hearing   was  held   before   a   senior  Judge
Advocate  officer. EM  did not testify  at the  hearing. However, she  did provide  a  written
statement dated  January  24, 2017. That statement was sealed  by  the  Hearing  Officer and
is  not a  part of  this record. However, the  Hearing  Officer did discuss the  contents of  this
statement  in  his  “Preliminary   Hearing   Officer’s  Report”   dated   February   6,  2017,  as
follows:
As to  the  first –  in  her mother’s bed  –  she  [EM] stated  that she  was 10  years
old and  it  happened  at  the  family  home  . .  .  (before  the  families moved  in
together).  . . .  She  recalls waking  up  with  the  Accused  [Applicant] “rubbing
my  vagina  on  the  skin  with  his hand.” . .  .  She  pretended  to  be  asleep,  the
Accused  eventually  stopped, and  the  next day  everyone  seemed  normal. .
. .
She  further explained  that the  “lotion” incident  occurred  right after the  family
had  moved  into  their  first home  . . .  She  said  that she  complained  about her
sore tailbone, that the  Accused  told her to  lay  on  her stomach  on  the  couch
and  take  off  her underwear (she   was just  wearing  a  large  t-shirt), and  he
then  took baby  oil  and  starting  [sic] rubbing  her: “He  was rubbing  my  back
and   then   my   butt.   And   then  he   inserted  his fingers inside  my   vagina   and
anus.   He  would  insert  one   whole  finger  and   then   transition   to   multiple
fingers at a  time, up  to  four fingers at  one  point.” . . . She  repeated  that  he
admitted to  this sexual assault and asked her not to tell. . . .
As to the incident on the couch, EM stated:
While we were living in the first house . . . , we were sitting on the
couch watching TV. He was rubbing my thigh (as he often did) for a
long time. He was wearing a blue underarmour short [sic] and black
basketball shorts and depending on how he was sitting on the couch,
I could see his private parts. While we were sitting on the couch, he
began to rub my vagina on the  skin, and then he reached into his
pants  and  took  out  his  hard  penis  from  the  top  of  his  basketball
shorts.  He  told  me  if  I  was  ever  curious  or  if  I  wanted  to  see  and
understand  or  something  to  that  affect  [sic].  He  then  grabbed  my
hand and tried to get me to touch his penis, but I pulled back and
tensed up and then he let me [sic] hand go. I then got up and went
to the bathroom and then went to bed.
.
.
.
.
EM discussed a couple of other incidents of touching after this, and reported
that the last occasion was when she was 13 years old and her mother was
in the hospital. (Applicant Exhibit O.)
As  stated,  the   Hearing   Officer  prepared   a   report.   In   addition   to   the   discussion
above,  the  report basically  reiterated  the  facts as  set  forth  in  this decision.  The  Hearing
Officer found, “There is  probable  cause  to  believe  that  the  Charge  and  each  Specification
has been  committed  . .  . . And  there is  probable  cause  to  believe  that  Accused  [Applicant]
committed the  offenses.” (Applicant Exhibit O.)
Despite his factual findings the Hearing Officer recommended that the charges be
dismissed. He stated:
On   the   evidence   before  me,  there  is  no   reasonably   [sic]  possibility   of
success  on   the   merits.   In   the   “best”  of   circumstances,   child   sexual
assault/sexual  abuse   cases  are  notoriously   hard  to   prove   beyond   a
reasonable doubt.  There are numerous circumstances here that will make
it  even   more   difficult.   Though   not   uncommon   not   to   have   third-party
witnesses  to   such   offenses,  here  neither  EM’s  mother,  younger  brother,
younger  sister,  or  [sic]  adult  household   resident  [AM]  will  provide   any
substantive  information  to  corroborate  EM’s allegations.  Thus, proof beyond
a  reasonable doubt will hang  on  EM’s credibility. The  Government will have
a  difficult  time  establishing  that  as the  Defense  will likely  subject  EM  to  a
devastating cross-examination.
,
,
,
,
This analysis is not whether the offenses did or did not occur or whether EM
is or is not telling what she believes to be the truth about. This analysis is
simply  an  experienced  and  objective  overview  of  the  difficulty  of  proving
these allegations beyond a reasonable doubt. Moving forward with trial with
no reasonable likelihood of success it [sic] not fair to either the victim or the
Accused.  Here,  there  is  no  reasonably  [sic]  possibility  of  success  on  the
merits.  Thus,
I  recommend  the  Charge  and  Specifications  be
dismissed. (Emphasis in original.) (Applicant Exhibit O.)
The  Staff  Judge  Advocate  of  a  major  Air  Force  command  recommended  to  the
general court-martial convening authority that the charges be dismissed without referral
to a court-martial. His reasoning generally tracks with that of the Hearing Officer. Based
on  that  recommendation  the  court-martial  convening  authority,  an  Air  Force  lieutenant
general, dismissed the charges and specifications on April 4, 2017. (Applicant Exhibit P.)
Applicant  subsequently  received  a  letter  of  reprimand  from  the  commander  of
AFOSI  on  May  11,  2017.  Its  terms  basically follow all  the  allegations  discussed  in  the
SOR. On June 29, 2017, Applicant was permanently disqualified from being an AFOSI
agent. Applicant requested retirement, which was granted with an effective date of July
1, 2017. (Government Exhibit 3 at Exhibit O, and Exhibit 6; Tr. 79-80.)
Later in 2017 Applicant was provided an administrative due process hearing by the
Department of Children and Family Services in the state where he lived. After a hearing
the  administrative  law  judge  (ALJ)  found  that  the  department  failed  to  show  by  a
preponderance  of  the  evidence  that  a  specific  incident  regarding  EM  occurred,
specifically, “Sexual Penetration as to [EM].” The ALJ recommended that the record be
expunged as to that allegation and one other, further described below. The particular facts
of the allegation concerning EM are not set forth in the ALJ decision. (Applicant Exhibit
T; Tr. 91-92.)
Applicant  was  extensively  questioned  by  his  counsel,  cross-examined  by
Department  Counsel,  and  also  questioned  by  me.  He  absolutely  denied  that  any
inappropriate sexual activity happened between him and EM. (Tr. 50-59, 78-81, 84-96.)
1.b. Applicant admitted in part and denied in part this allegation, which alleged that
in 2014 he sexually harassed his minor step-niece, AM, by smacking her on the buttocks.
Applicant admitted that he engaged in such conduct. He testified that “there was a
smack on the bottom, but it wasn’t anything sexual in nature. It was, I guess, a love tap,
if you will, kind of like an attaboy with baseball.” During the period this happened AM was
17 and lived with Applicant and RL. (Tr. 59-63.)
During the investigation of Applicant described in detail above AM was interviewed
by  AFOSI.  The  report  of  that  interview  stated,  “VICTIM  [AM]  described  she  felt
uncomfortable   around   [Applicant],   and   he   inappropriately   smacked   her  buttocks.”
(Applicant Exhibit N  at 5-6, 11-12.)
AM provided a signed statement to Applicant’s attorney dated January 26, 2021.
She stated, “I am writing this email to confirm that [Applicant] did not sexually harass me.
I  believe  it  was  just  simply a  misunderstanding.  He  has  never done  anything to  me  to
make me think that he did or would sexually harass me.” (Applicant Exhibit U.)
1.c. Applicant admitted in part and denied in part this allegation, which stated that
he “sent a sexually suggestive message to A.S., an eighteen-year-old family friend. You
were married at the time.”
According   to   Applicant  he   saw   an   attractive   picture  of   AS   on   the   internet.   He
responded  with  the  comment, “Sooooo, you  almost got me  with  the  bewitching   pic. As
soon  as I saw  it my  thought was you  can  ride  my  broomstick anytime! Then, I realized
who  you  were [frowny  face] stop  growing  up  so  fast.  [whistling  face]” AS  replied, “XD I’ll
try.” According  to  Applicant this occurred  in  January  2015  and  he  was separated  from  his
wife at that time. (Applicant Exhibit Q; Tr. 63-66.)
Paragraph 2 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  has  engaged  in  conduct  involving  questionable  judgment,  lack  of  candor,
dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations.
2.a. The Government alleged in this subparagraph that Applicant’s alleged sexual
misconduct,  as  set  forth  above,  was  also  cognizable  under  this  guideline.  Applicant
denied this allegation.
2.b.  The  Government  alleged  in  this  subparagraph  that  Applicant  falsified
information  regarding  other  alleged  acts  of  sexual  misconduct  in  interrogatories
propounded to him by DOHA and signed by him on June 10, 2020. Specifically, Applicant
is  alleged  to  have  falsified  Section  2,  Item  2  of  the  interrogatories,  which  asked  him
whether “[o]ther than the allegations made against you by your minor stepdaughter [E.M.]
in  about  October  2014,  have  you  EVER  been  accused  of  child  sexual  abuse  by  ANY
person at ANY time.” (Emphasis in original.) Applicant denied this allegation stating he
forgot about these particular allegations due to the age of them. (Government Exhibit 3;
Tr. 67-70.)
This allegation has three subparts:
2.b.i.  In  this  subpart  it  is  alleged  that  Applicant  lied  by  not  stating  that  he  was
accused in March 8, 2012, of abusing his minor stepdaughter, AC, by her biological father.
Applicant  stated  this  allegation  was  false  and  was  instigated  by  AC’s  biological
father. He also stated that the allegation was unfounded, which is supported by the ALJ
decision in Government Exhibit 3 at Exhibit T. In addition, Applicant submitted a guardian
ad litem report from 2012 about this particular allegation, supporting the fact that it was
unfounded. (Applicant Exhibit V; Tr. 69-72.)
2.b.ii. The Government alleged in this subpart that Applicant failed to admit that in
December  2015  his  minor  stepdaughter,  AC,  told  her  mother  that  he  had  “tickled  her
peepee.” Applicant denied  this allegation, stating  that  it was actually  made  against  the
child’s birth father. Therefore, there was no need to report it since this allegation did not
involve Applicant. (Tr. 72-74.)
2.b.iii. The Government alleged in this subpart that Applicant failed to disclose that
he was the subject of at least five hotline complaints regarding the three children of RL –
EM,  AC,  and  LC;  also  the  children  of  his  cohabitant  (now  his  third  wife)  NS  and  ZS.
Applicant’s interrogatory responses include  the  AFOSI  report (Government  Exhibit 3  at
Exhibit  L), and  the  ALJ  decision  (Government  Exhibit  3  at  Exhibit T). Both  documents
discuss these allegations and discount them. (Tr. 74-77.)
Attached  to  the  interrogatory  response  (Government  Exhibit  3)  is  Exhibit  T,  the
2017  decision  of  the  DCFS  ALJ  also  discussed  above.  In  addition  to  the  allegation
regarding EM the ALJ also adjudicated an allegation of “Substantial Risk of Sexual Injury
as to [AC], [LC], [ZS], and [NS].” Once again he found that the department had not proved
their case using the preponderance of the evidence standard, and recommended that the
report be expunged.
Mitigation
As stated, two witnesses testified for Applicant. In addition to their testimony about
the factual allegations in this case they also discussed the Applicant as a person. Both
witnesses  describe  him  as  a  friend  who  they  trust  in  important  matters  in  their  own
personal lives. They recommend him for a position of trust.
Applicant supplied  positive  letters from  Air  Force personnel who  worked  with  him
in the  Inspector  General’s office  after  the  allegations set forth  in this  case  surfaced. The
writers stated  that Applicant was a  very  good  non-commissioned  officer who  helped  the
Inspector General’s office in many  ways. With  knowledge  of  the  allegations against him
the writers recommend him  for a  position of trust. (Applicant Exhibit F.)
Applicant  provided  documentary  evidence  about  his  Air  Force  career.  The
evidence shows that he had a successful career with many accomplishments. (Applicant
Exhibits G and H.)
Applicant also submitted evaluations from his current employer. They show that
he meets expectations. (Applicant Exhibit I.)
",False
"The  SOR  alleged  under  Guideline  I,  that  Applicant  was  diagnosed  with  a
pedophilic disorder (with a questionable prognosis) in January 2020. Under Guideline D,
it alleged, and cross-alleged under Guideline E, that Applicant engaged in downloading
and viewing child pornography from approximately 2011 to 2017, and that he currently
reads  erotic  textual  stories  involving  children.  Applicant  admitted  all  of  the  SOR
allegations with comments in mitigation.
Applicant’s  SOR  admissions  and  those  at  his  hearing  are  incorporated  into  my
findings of fact. After a thorough review of all the record evidence, I make the following
additional findings of fact:
Applicant,  41,  has  been  working  for  federal  contractors  since  2003,  and  for  his
current employer and clearance sponsor since March 2016. He was granted clearance
eligibility  up  to  sensitive  compartmented  information  (SCI)  by  another  Federal  agency
(Agency) in about 2005. He married in 2008, and has one son, age eight. He graduated
from  high  school  with  a  large  number  of  college  courses  completed,  and  attended
college for some time, but never completed his bachelor’s degree.
Applicant  has  done  well  in  his  area  of  expertise.  He  has  established  a  strong
reputation  and  is  respected  by  peers  and  employers  for  his  acumen,  dedication,
leadership,  and  professionalism.  His  performance  evaluations  show  he  has  been
consistently  rated  as  an  exceptional  employee  who  exceeds  expectations,  and  has
earned yearly awards recognizing him as the best among peers. (AE A and B)
In 2013, Applicant participated in several polygraph assisted interviews. (GEs 3 –
8,  and  10,  11)  He  disclosed  that  in  mid-2011,  he  began  downloading,  storing,  and
viewing child pornography on his personal computer once every two weeks. He viewed
videos  depicting  females  ranging  from  8  to  17  years  of  age  exposing  their  genitals,
masturbating,  and  having  sexual  contact  with  each  other  and  adults.  He  masturbated
during these  sessions.  He  also  reported  that in  2012, he had thought  about  amassing
enough classified information to give to Russia or the Ukraine in exchange for a harem
of little girls. He denied ever acting on it. (Tr. 55)
Applicant  claimed  that  he  stopped  viewing  child  pornography  in  about  October
2012  after  discussing  his  behavior  in  detail  with  his  wife  and  promising  her  that  he
would  stop.  He  had  his  wife  set  the  passwords  of  his  home  computer  to  prevent  him
from searching for child pornography. At his hearing, he admitted that he was able to go
around  the  passwords  and  use  the  computers.  He  attributed  his  child  pornography
viewing habits to the death of a close female friend in 2009.
During a May 2014 polygraph assisted interview, Applicant described himself as
a  pedophile  because  he  is  sexually  attracted  to  underage  girls.  He  claimed  he  has
never acted on his desires. Between the spring of 2013 and March 2014, Applicant read
erotic  stories  featuring  underage  females  engaging  in  sexual  acts  with  adults.  He
claimed he stopped reading these stories in March 2014, because they made his sexual
urges  stronger.  He  stated  that  he  was  masturbating  once  per  month  to  the  thought  of
engaging in sexual acts with underage females. He told his interviewers that having and
maintaining  a  clearance  was  a  strong  deterrent  to  keep  him  from  viewing  child
pornography.
After  the  interview,  Applicant  participated  in  counseling  with  his  own  therapist
and  an  Agency  therapist.  After  a  psychological  evaluation,  the  Agency  therapist
diagnosed  Applicant  with  Pedophilic  Disorder.  Notwithstanding  this  diagnosis,  the
Agency  therapist  recommended  Applicant  continue  his  work.  During  a  following
interview  in  August  2015,  Applicant  disclosed  that  he  had  searched  for,  downloaded,
stored on his computer, and viewed child pornography on six to seven occasions from
one month after his Agency’s psychological evaluation in June 2014, to most recently in
June  2015.  He  also  used  his  cell  phone  to  search  for  child  pornography.  After  the
interview, the Agency suspended his clearance and SCI eligibility.
Applicant’s  appeal to  the  Agency’s decision  included a psychological  evaluation
in  December  2015,  performed  by  his  treating  psychologist,  Dr.  C,  a  licensed
psychologist  (Psy.D).  He  was  diagnosed  with:  1)  Pedophilic  Disorder,  Nonexclusive
Type, Sexually Attracted to Females (so the attraction to underage females will always
be present); 2) Bipolar Disorder, Most Recent Episode Depressed, Mild; and 3) Alcohol
Dependence  in  Sustained  Full  Remission.  Based  on  the  evaluation  report,  it  appears
that  the  psychologist  believed  that  Applicant  had  only  sought  and  viewed  child
pornography between 2011 and 2012, with a one-time relapse in 2015. (GE 4)
Applicant’s  evidence  fails  to  establish  that  Dr.  C  was  aware  that  between  the
spring  of  2013  and  March  2014,  he  read  erotic  stories  featuring  underage  females
engaging in sexual acts with adults. It is also not clear whether Dr. C knew that between
June 2014 (one month after his Agency’s psychological evaluation) and  June 2015, he
viewed child pornography on six to seven occasions, and not just one time. (GE 10) The
Agency revoked Applicant’s clearance in February 2016. (GE 6)
After  submitting  his  2017  SCA,  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  investigators from
the Office of  Personnel Management (OPM)  in July, September, and November 2017,
and  answered  a  set  of  interrogatories  from  the  DOHA,  in  about  May  2020.  (GE  2).  In
substance,  Applicant  reiterated  his prior statements  to Agency investigators  during his
interviews with OPM investigators.
In  January  2020,  the  CAF  referred  Applicant  for  a  psychological  evaluation,
which  was performed by Dr. W, a licensed Doctor of  Clinical Psychology (Psy.D). The
evaluation  report  was  completed  in  February  2020.  (GE  13)  During  the  evaluation,
Applicant  told  Dr. W  that  the  last  time  he  viewed  child  pornography  was  in  2018.  She
noted  that  via  a  post-interview  email,  Applicant  re-stated  that  he  last  viewed  child
pornography  in  late  2017,  towards  the  end  of  his  therapy  sessions  with  Dr.  C.
Applicant’s counseling records show that he ended his therapy with Dr. C in November
2018. (GE 12) During the evaluation process, Dr. W spoke with Dr. C. Dr. W noted that
Dr. C believed Applicant last viewed child pornography in 2013, with a relapse in 2015.
(See  AE  G;  GE  13)  Applicant’s  counseling  records  reflect  that  he  told  Dr.  C  he
“relapsed” once in 2016.
Dr. W diagnosed Applicant as follows: (GE 13)
296.56 Bipolar I Disorder, most recent episode depressed, in full remission
F65.4 Pedophilic Disorder (Nonexclusive type, sexually attracted to females)
In  her  opinion,  Applicant’s  symptoms  of  Bipolar  Disorder  appear  to  be  well
controlled  by  his  adherence  to  psychiatric  medications.  Concerning  Applicant’s
Pedophilic  Disorder,  she  stated:  [Applicant]  presents  with  a  condition  (Pedophilic
Disorder) that could pose a significant risk to his judgment, reliability or trustworthiness
concerning classified information. In her opinion, Applicant’s prognosis is questionable.
At  his hearing,  Applicant  presented his  own psychological  evaluation performed
by Dr. C, in March 2001. (AE G) Dr. C diagnosed Applicant with:
F31.31 Bipolar Disorder, most recent episode  depressed, mild
F65.4 Pedophilic Disorder (Nonexclusive type, sexually attracted  to  females)
Dr. C’s evaluation is favorable to Applicant. She noted that he denied acting on
his fantasies by sexually assaulting children, and that he consistently expressed severe
emotional  distress  related  to  his  unwanted  sexual  fantasies.  She  highlighted  that  he
outed himself as a consumer of child pornography to family members and some friends,
and  that  he  has  received  “overwhelming  support”  from  them  in  his  efforts  towards
abstinence  and  controlling  his  sexual  urges.  Dr.  C  believes  that  during  his  course  of
therapy, Applicant abstained from viewing child pornography entirely with the exception
of  a  relapse  that  occurred  in  June  2015.  Dr.  C  failed  to  note  Applicant’s  relapse  of
February 2016, which was documented in her counseling notes. (GE 12)
that  he  engaged
Applicant  admitted
in  downloading  and  viewing  child
pornography from approximately 2011 to  2018. He  stated that  his last  viewing of  child
pornography occurred shortly before he stopped his treatment with Dr. C in November
2018.  (GE  12;  SOR  answer;  Tr.  26)  Applicant  stated  that  if  his  counseling  records  do
not state the times he relapsed it was likely  an oversight that he does not understand,
and  volunteer  to  bring  the  information  to  Dr.  C  and  have  her  amend  her  evaluation
letter. (Tr. 92)
Based  on  Applicant’s  treatment  records  and  Dr.  C’s  March  2021  evaluation,  it
appears she  was unaware of Applicant’s relapses  after  February 2016. At his hearing,
when  questioned  about  how  frequently  he  viewed  child  pornography  after  2015,  and
when was the last time he did so, Applicant was evasive, and stated that it has been so
long ago he no longer recalls. He admitted that he relapsed more than once during his
treatment between 2014 and 2018. (Tr. 38)
In  his  response  to  DOHA  interrogatories  (GE  2)  and  at  his  hearing,  Applicant
stated that he had been reading erotic textual stories involving children. He claimed that
reading  these  erotic  stories  helps  prevent  him  from  engaging  in  any  illegal  activity
(searching, downloading, and viewing child pornography). He testified that reading such
stories became part of his coping mechanism and therapy. It was his way of addressing
that  aspect  of  sexuality  in  a  way  that  was  both  legal  and  ethical.  He  believes  such
behavior is legal and ethical. (Tr. 27)
There  is  no  information  in  his  counseling  records  or  in  Dr.  C’s  evaluations
showing  that  she  was  aware  he  was  reading  erotic  textual  stories  involving  children.  I
note that he told Agency investigators that in 2013-2014 he had to stop reading erotic
stories  involving  young  girls  engaging  in  sexual  acts  because  such  stories  make  his
sexual urges stronger. (GE 8; Tr. 103-104)
Applicant  testified  that  after  his  treatment  discharge  in  November  2018,  he  has
not  felt  the  urge  to  look  at  child  pornography.  (Tr.  50)  He  claimed  that  viewing  child
pornography is behind him, and that he has had no relapses since November 2018. (Tr.
52)
Attached to his SOR answer, Applicant included favorable reference statements
from  his  wife,  mother,  father,  two  co-workers,  and  a  supervisor.  (AE  E)  Most  of  the
letters were apparently prepared for his appeal of the Agency’s clearance revocation in
2015-2016.  Only  one  letter  was  dated  in  2019;  only  one  writer  indicated  he  believed
Applicant’s clearance was revoked as a result of a “self-reported violation of his security
agreement.” None of the references stated their knowledge about the child pornography
allegations against Applicant.
At  his  hearing,  Applicant  presented  three  favorable  reference  letters,  recently
dated,  from  friends  and  a  colleague.  (AE  I  and  K)  None  of  the  references  state  with
specificity their actual knowledge of the SOR allegations.
Based  on  the  record  evidence,  only  Applicant’s  wife  seems  to  be  aware  of  the
reasons  behind  Applicant’s  clearance  revocation  by  the  Agency  in  2016  –  his
involvement with child pornography. It is not clear whether she is aware of the pending
SOR allegations or the totality of Applicant’s criminal behavior.
",False
"In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR ¶ 1.a. He did not answer SOR
¶  2.a,  but  since  it  is  a  cross-allegation  of  SOR  ¶  1.a,  I  consider  it  admitted.  He
“admitted” SOR  ¶  3.a, but  with  an explanation  that  I construe as a  denial,  and, in  any
event,  SOR  ¶  3.a  has  been  withdrawn.  Applicant’s  admission  and  statements  are
incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  31  years  old.  He  has  never  married.  He  has  a  three-year-old  son
with  his  former fiancée.  (Item  5  at  9)  Applicant  enlisted  in  the  U.S  Marine  Corps  after
graduating  from  high  school  in  2008.  He  spent  three  years  on  active  duty  and  was
honorably  discharged  in  September  2011  as  a  lance  corporal  (E-3).  After  a  year  of
unemployment, he worked for five years in the health care industry (2012-2017). He has
worked  for  his  current  employer,  a  large  defense  contractor,  since  January  2018.  He
works in a warehouse. He has never held a security clearance before. (Item 3)
On  or  about  July  26,  2018,  police  were  called  to  Applicant’s  home  after  a
neighbor had reported seeing a fully naked male standing in the front yard of the home
actively  masturbating  while  holding  a  cell  phone.  (Item  8  at  29)  By  the  time  police
arrived, Applicant had moved to the backyard. He went inside when he noticed a police
officer  in  his  front  yard.  He  did  not  answer  the  door  right  away,  but  instead  took  a
shower. He eventually came to the door and was then taken into custody. (Item 4 at 7-8,
Item 8)
Police reports reflect multiple calls to the home in June and July 2018 following
reports of similar activity. (Item 8 at 29) According to police records, under questioning
from  police,  Applicant  admitted  exposing  himself  and  masturbating  in  his  front  yard
about  three  times  a  week for the previous  three months.  (He  denied  that  statement  in
his FORM Response). According to the police report, he admitted to engaging in similar
conduct  in  the parking lot of  a fitness club  to  which  he belonged  (leading to an earlier
police report), the parking lot of a convenience store, and in a park. (Item 8 at 6)
As  Applicant  explained  during  his  background  interview,  he  was  living  with  his
fiancée  at  the  time.  She  was  pregnant,  and  they  were  not  sexually  active.  These
circumstances  left  Applicant  sexually  frustrated.  She  would  not  allow  him  to  watch
pornography in their home, so he would do so outside instead, on his cell phone; even,
on occasion, such as on the day of his arrest, when she was not home. (Item 4 at 7)
Applicant was charged with four counts of indecent exposure to a person greater
than 15 and four counts of public indecency. In October 2018, he pleaded guilty to one
count  of  each  offense  and  the  remaining  six  counts  were  dismissed.  He  was  given  a
180-day  jail  term,  with  all  but  one  day  suspended  (that  day  was  time  served),  and
sentenced  to  12  months  of  supervised  probation  and  six  months  of  unsupervised
probation.  He  was  fined  $2,500  (suspended)  and  ordered  to  participate  in  a
psychological evaluation. (Item 5 at 5-8; Item 6) (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 2.a)
Applicant  had  a  one-hour  psychiatric  evaluation  with  a  DNP  (doctor  of  nursing
practice)  in  February  2019.  He  was  diagnosed  with  “adjustment  disorders  with
depressed  mood.”  (Item  5  at  9-13)  He  did  not  meet  the  criteria  for  sex  addiction,  but
was found to be “at risk.” (Item 5 at 12) Documentation from the evaluation reflects that
Applicant reported that he sought counseling from the VA after his arrest, and that the
VA therapist told him he no longer needed sessions, but no details  were provided and
the  VA  counseling  is  undocumented.  (Item  5  at  9)  He  successfully  completed  the
requirements of  his probation and it  was  terminated early,  in  October 2019.  (Item 5 at
14)
Applicant’s conduct led to the end of his relationship with his fiancée. He moved
in  with  his  parents.  His  parents,  his  sister,  and  some  close  friends  are  aware  of  his
actions. (Item 4 at 10)
In  his  FORM  response,  Applicant  wrote  that  “this  entire  situation  has  been
embarrassing  and  emotionally  painful.”  This is his  only arrest.  As  noted  above,  he  did
not recall stating to police he had “exposed himself three times a week for the last three
months prior to the arrest.” He said it was never brought to his attention that he was at
risk  for  sex  addiction  or  needed  more  treatment.  He  did  not  challenge  other  details
about his conduct as noted in the FORM materials. Applicant indicated that he had set
up an October 2021 appointment with a VA counselor. He said he needs his job to care
for his young son. (FORM response).
Applicant  provided  no  documentation  with  either  his  Answer  or  his  FORM
response of any reference letters, work evaluations, or other materials for consideration
under the whole-person concept or in mitigation.

"Applicant  is a 49-year-old  single man with three adult children.  His two  marriages
ended in divorce.  (Tr. 24;  GE  1 at 24)  Applicant’s  most recent marriage ended in 2009.
(GE 2 at 8)  Applicant earned an associate  degree in 2012. (Tr. 25) He is a veteran of the
U.S. Army. He served on active duty from 1993 to 2000, and in  the Army Reserve from
2000  to 2005, before returning t  o active duty  between 2005 and 2009.  (GE  1 at 17-19)
He was honorably  discharged. (AE B) In  2009,  Applicant  re-enlisted  in the Army Reserve,
where he served through 2018 when he received a medical discharge. (Tr. 95). He has
been working for his current  full-time employer for three years  in the field of information
technology. (Tr. 70)
Applicant  is  highly  respected  on  the  job.  Per  the  company’s  senior  network
engineer,  Applicant  “has  always  shown  a  desire  to  lean  [sic]  and  do  a  good  job.”
Moreover, while working for his employer, Applicant has achieved significant milestones,
and “has conducted himself professionally . . . “ (AE E at 2) Per a coworker, Applicant is
a valued asset to the team whose character is above reproach. (AE E at 1)
In  February  2007,  a  female  private  first  class,  subordinate  to  Applicant  in  rank,
accused him of sexually assaulting her in the barracks while she was unconscious from
intoxication. When the episode occurred, Applicant was the assigned supervisor in charge
of quarters. (Tr. 43) His job was to keep soldiers and property safe. (Tr. 45) Subsequently,
Applicant was tried by general court-martial and charged with rape, sodomy by force and
without  consent,  adultery,  and  dereliction  of  duty.  (AE  A) Applicant  admitted  to  having
sexual relations with the female soldier, but contended that it was consensual and limited
to oral sex. (Tr. 47) Applicant was found guilty of dereliction of duty, rape, and adultery.
As for the sodomy charge, the Army amended it, omitting the phrase, “by forcible [sic]
and  without  the  consent  of  the  said  Private  First  Class  .  .  .  .  ,”  whereupon  Applicant
pleaded  guilty  to  the  amended  charge.  (AE  A  at  1)  On  June  12,  2007,  Applicant  was
sentenced to nine months of confinement and reduction in rank from E-4 to E-1 for six
months. (GE 10 at 1, 8) After being released from confinement, Applicant was discharged
honorably in 2009 and allowed to enlist in the reserves. (AE B)
In November 2008, the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Division (CID) determined
that Applicant committed the offenses of making a false statement, larceny of government
funds, and false claims when he submitted fraudulent documents to the Defense Finance
and Accounting Service, claiming his dependents were residing in one state when they
actually lived in another. (GE 7 at 2) He submitted these claims for April 6, 2006 through
December  20,  2007.  (GE  7  at  2)  According  to  the  investigation,  Applicant’s  actions
allowed him to receive approximately $18,126 in unauthorized pay and allowances. (GE
7 at 2) Applicant denied this allegation. He testified that his then wife and child relocated
from the state where they had all been living together in order to live with family members
in another state. Moreover, per Applicant, when he proved to the relevant authority that
his  family  members  were,  in  fact,  living  in  another  state,  the  Army  concluded  that  his
claims were properly submitted and authorized. (Tr. 75) Applicant provided no proof of
this contention.
While  on  reserve  duty  in  November  2011,  Applicant  was  accused  by  a  female
soldier  of  touching  her  buttocks  without  permission.  (Answer  at  2)  A  subsequent
investigation  substantiated  the  female  soldier’s  allegation,  leading  to  Applicant  being
charged  with  wrongful  sexual  contact  under  the  UCMJ.  Consequently,  Applicant  was
reprimanded. (Answer at 2)
Applicant characterized his behavior in this instance as “a foolish and inappropriate
attempt at a joke,” that “was taken out of context to the extreme.” (Answer at 2) Moreover,
he testified that he has not engaged in any sexual misconduct in nearly ten years, and
that his past sexual misconduct is not reflective of his current character. (Tr. 89)
Since  2009,  Applicant  has  incurred  $54,000  of  delinquent  debt.  Approximately
$25,000 of Applicant’s delinquent debt is comprised of overdue child support, as alleged
in subparagraph 3.b. (GE 3 at 2) Applicant began falling behind on child support payments
shortly after his divorce was finalized in 2009. Applicant contended that he could not afford
the payments because they constituted 50 percent of his income. (Tr. 30; GE 2 at 8) He
further contends that he has been satisfying his child support delinquency through a wage
garnishment.  (Tr.  54)  There  is  no  record  evidence  that  Applicant’s  wages  are  being
garnished to pay child support. As of July 2021, the past-due balance was $21,741. (GE
5 at 3)
The debt alleged in subparagraph 3.c is an auto loan totaling $10,374. Applicant
purchased the vehicle in 2016. Unable to afford it after a contract job abruptly ended, he
allowed it to be voluntarily repossessed later that same year. He has made no payments
on this delinquency since the repossession. (GE 4 at 3; Tr. 58)
Subparagraphs 3.d, and 3.f through 3.h are student loan accounts with overdue
payment  amounts  totaling  approximately  $1,570,  and  collective  balances  totaling
approximately  $38,000.  In  2017,  he  obtained  a  forbearance.  (Tr.  59)  As  of  July  2021,
none of the accounts were in delinquent status. (GE 5 at 3-5)
The delinquency alleged in subparagraph 3.e, totaling $8,944,  is the balance due
on a car.  As with  the car that  Applicant  purchased in 2017, he fell  behind on t  he p  ayments
after an employment  contract  ended, compelling him to seek  voluntary repossession. (Tr.
32)  His current job, which he has held since  2018, is more stable than his  previous  jobs.
(Tr.  32) Consequently, Applicant has  not experienced  any erratic disruptions in pay, like
he experienced when contracts  ended on previous jobs.  Applicant has  nevertheless  made
no payments toward the satisfaction of  the car delinquency since it was repossessed. (Tr.
58)
The debt alleged in subparagraph 3.i, totaling $377, is a delinquent insurance bill.
Applicant  contends  that  he  satisfied  it  several  years  ago.  (Tr.  13)  He  provided  no
documented proof of payment.
The debt alleged in subparagraph 3.j is a collection agent for a phone company,
totaling $260. Applicant contends that he satisfied it, but provided no documented proof.
Currently,  Applicant  has  approximately  $250  deposited  in  his  checking  account
and  $250  deposited  in  a  savings  account.  Although  he  has  not  formally  received  any
financial counseling, he has read a book on financial management. (Tr. 69)
In  2006,  when  Applicant  was  in  the  military,  the  U.S.  Army  Central  Personnel
Security Clearance Facility issued an intent to revoke his access to classified information
and  eligibility  for  access  to  sensitive  compartmented  information,  alleging  financial
considerations  security  concerns.  (GE  9  at  13)  Subsequently,  Applicant  was  issued  a
security clearance conditioned upon his compliance with debt repayment arrangements.

"Applicant is a 41-year-old married man with two teenage children and one teenage
stepchild. Two previous marriages ended in divorce. (GE 1 at 22-23) He has been married
to his current wife for nearly two years. (AE C) Applicant is a high school graduate and
has taken some college courses. (GE 1 at 12) He is a veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps,
serving from 2003 to 2017. (GE F at 1) He served in two overseas combat theaters. (AE
E at 1) He received a discharge under other than honorable conditions. (GE F at 1)
Currently,  Applicant  works  for  a  defense  contractor  as  a  technician  who  builds
simulators.  (AE  A  at  2;  Tr.  17)  His  job  duties  include  complex  panel  assembly,  panel
wiring, building complex cables, and assembling flight training device equipment. (AE L)
These  duties  are  similar  to  the  duties  that  Applicant  performed  when  he  was  in  the
Marines. (GE L at 2) Applicant is highly respected on the job. According to his most recent
performance evaluation in March 2021, his quality of work and initiative are excellent. (AE
K at 3)
From  2008  to  2017,  Applicant  engaged  in  compulsive  sexual  behavior.  This
behavior began shortly after he returned from his second overseas combat deployment.
He would seek out women and couples to have sexual intercourse on a weekly basis.
(GE  3  at  15)  He  also  engaged  in  multiple  extramarital  affairs.  (Answer  at  1)  Per  his
counselor, some of this behavior was of a public nature. (AE A at 6)
In 2011, Applicant  sought  help from  a psychiatrist  who  diagnosed him as a  sex
addict. (Answer at 1; GE 3 at 15; AE 3 at 4) He consulted with the psychiatrist for three
to  four  months.  (AE  A  at  3)  Applicant  began  attending  therapy,  consistent  with  his
psychiatrist’s recommendation. (GE 3 at 15; Tr. 32) He attended therapy for eight months
on a weekly basis. (EX A at 3) The psychiatrist also recommended that Applicant tell his
then wife about his sex addiction. (GE 3 at 15) Applicant followed his psychiatrist’s advice,
leading to her decision to seek a divorce, (GE 3 at 15)
Applicant began dating his second wife after his divorce. He subsequently stopped
engaging in sex with random partners. GE 3 at 15) Sometime after dating his second wife,
Applicant  stopped  seeing  his  therapist.  Consequently,  he  began  indulging  in  sex  with
random partners again.
In  August  2017,  Applicant  was  tried  at  a  summary  court  martial  for  violation  of
Uniform  Code  of  Military  Justice,  Article  92,  violation  of  a  lawful  general  order  and
dereliction of duty, and Article 93, maltreatment of a subordinate, after being involved in
a sexual encounter with two subordinates approximately nine months earlier. (Answer at

Applicant  has  not  engaged  in  any  sexually  addictive  behavior  since  December
2017. In early 2018, he met his current wife. They married in 2019. She is aware of his
past behavior, and characterizes him as “a good, kind, caring man who works hard day
in and day out to support [their] family . . .” (GE D at 1) She is aware of his past conduct.
(AE D at 1)
In October 2021, Applicant consulted with a certified addictions counselor who is
professionally familiar with the adjudicative guidelines in the Directive, having evaluated
hundreds  of  security  clearance  holders  and  applicants  over  the  years.  (AE  A,  AE  B)
During  the  consultation,  Applicant  elaborated  on  the  roots  of  his  sexual  addiction,
attributing it to what he considered, in retrospect, to have been caused by undiagnosed
post-traumatic stress disorder, which worsened at the conclusion of his deployment when
he  was  transferred  to  recruitment  duty.  (AE  A  at  2)  The  stress  of  striving  to  meet
recruitment quotas led him to act out in a sexual manner by going to strip clubs, picking
up women at bars, and engaging in sexual encounters of a public nature. (AE A at 7) The
more stressed he became, the more he engaged in high-risk sexual behavior.
According  to  the  therapist,  Applicant’s  behavior  “was  a  direct  result  of  trying  to
replicate  the  adrenaline  responses  during  deployment,  or  offset  the  anxiety  he
experienced as a recruiter.” (AE A at 3) She characterized him as forthright, remorseful,
and fully  cooperative.  (AE  A  at  2,  7) The  standardized  testing  the  therapist  conducted
revealed  that  Applicant  was  in  prolonged  recovery  from  sexually  acting  out  after  his
combat  deployment  and  his  stint  as  a  recruiter.  (AE  A  at  7)  The  therapist  ultimately
concluded that Applicant had no disorder and that he “is not at risk of relapse or return to
his previous behavior.” (AE A at 7)
On  cross-examination,  Department  Counsel  asked  Applicant  to  provide  an
approximate number of  extramarital sexual encounters that he had between 2008 and
2017, (Tr. 34) He said that he did not recall. (Tr. 35) After he continued to be evasive in
this manner, I advised him of the importance of transparency to the security clearance
process, and asked him to provide a  “ball  park estimate.” (Tr. 35) Department counsel
then said the following:
I think the Judge is asking for a  ball park estimate. Do you have a  ball park
estimate  of the  number of  extramarital sexual encounters you  have  had?
(Tr. 35)
In  response,  Applicant  replied,”  I’m  not  going  to  presume  a  number  that’s  not  factual;
that’s not going to happen.” (Tr. 35)
Department Counsel then asked Applicant whether he had ever engaged in sexual
behavior  of  a  public  nature.  He  replied,  “I  don’t  recall.”  (Tr.  38)  When  asked  if  his
counselor’s report, which referenced  public sexual behavior, was inaccurate, Applicant
responded, “I didn’t write it.” (Tr. 38) I then asked, “would [the counselor] be inaccurate if
she was to have said that you engaged in sexual encounters of a public nature?” (Tr. 39)
Applicant responded, “I don’t know.” (Tr. 39)

"In  Applicant’s  Answer,  he  admitted  all  the  SOR  allegations,  with  explanations.
The admissions are adopted as findings of fact.  After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 68 years old. He is married (his third marriage) and has no children
of  his  own.  He  currently  works  for  a  defense  contractor  for  whom  he  has  worked  for
approximately  six  years.  He  has  a  bachelor’s  degree.  He  first  received  a  security
clearance sometime in the 1980s. In 2016, his active security clearance was suspended
by the  Defense  Security Service  (DSS)  for the allegations at  issue in  this hearing.  His
current  employer  is  sponsoring  him  for  his  security  clearance  request.  (Tr.  20,  37-38;
GE 1, 5)
Under  Guideline  D,  the  SOR  alleged  the  following:  (1)  that  Applicant,  between
2001 and 2015, used his company-issued computer to upload, view, and save images
of  naked  women  and  young  girls,  ages  11-15,  in  modeling  poses  and  with  scant
clothing. It also alleged Applicant continues to  view similar images at home on his cell
phone;  (2)  that  in  January  1997,  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  sexual
assault and sexual assault on a child while in a position of trust;  and (3) that Applicant
attended  a  12-step  program  for sex addicts  from  2001  to  2016,  but  stopped attending
because his wife did not think it was helping him. (SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c) I find that SOR ¶ 1.c
does not fall within any of Guideline D’s disqualifying conditions and further find for the
Applicant on this allegation.
Under  Guideline   M,   the   SOR  alleged   the   following:  (1)  that   Applicant  signed
documents  prepared   by   his  employer,  for  whom   he   worked   from   2001   to   2015,  that
prohibited  him  from  using  his company-issued  computer  to  view  any  pornography; and
(2)  that  Applicant,   between   2001   and   2015,  used   his  company-issued   computer  to
upload,  view,  and   save   images  of  naked   women   and   young   girls,  ages  11-15,  in
modeling   poses  and   with   scant  clothing.   It   also  alleged   Applicant  continues  to   view
similar images at home on his cell phone. (SOR ¶¶ 2.a-2.b)
Under  Guideline   E,  the   SOR   alleged:   (1)  that  in   February   2015,  Applicant  was
removed  from  his work premises,  had  his work laptop  and  security  badges confiscated
for  violations  of   personal  conduct  and   violations  of   his  company’s  network  information
technology   systems;  (2)  that  in  March  2015,  Applicant  was  terminated   from   his
employment;   (3)  that  Applicant,   between   2001   and   2015,  used   his  company-issued
computer  to  upload, view, and  save  images of  naked  women  and  young  girls, ages 11-
15,  in  modeling   poses   and   with   scant  clothing.   It   also  alleged   Applicant  continues  to
view  similar images at home  on his cell  phone; and  (4) that Applicant signed  documents
prepared  by  his employer, whom  he  worked  for from 2001  to  2015,  that  prohibited  him
from  using his company-issued computer to view any pornography. (SOR ¶¶  3.a-3.c)
In  approximately  1997,  Applicant  was  arrested  for  inappropriately  touching  his
11-year-old stepdaughter. He touched her through her clothing when she was sleeping
(or pretending to sleep). He did this once a week for a month. The child told her mother
(Applicant’s second  wife)  about Applicant’s actions. He admitted  his behavior.  He also
admitted  viewing  images  of  adolescent  girls  ages  11  to  15  in  sexually  erotic  poses
during  this  time.  He  was  arrested  on  felony  charges  of  sexual  assault  on  a  child  and
sexual assault on a child while in a position of trust. He pleaded guilty and was given a
deferred  sentence,  which  included  four  years  of  unsupervised  probation.  He  was  also
ordered to attend treatment by a therapist for four years. He was ordered to register as
a sex offender. He successfully completed his probation, including attending his court-
ordered treatment. He was released from probation and successfully fulfilled the terms
of his deferred sentence in 2001. The original charges were then dropped. From 2001
to  2016,  he  voluntarily  attended  a  12-step  recovery  program  for  sex  addicts.  He
believed the meetings were helpful, but his wife did not, so he stopped attending. He is
no  longer  listed  as  a  sex  offender  in  his  home  state.  In  his  SOR  answer,  Applicant
claimed that a therapist gave him a favorable prognosis against reoffending. He did not
offer any records to document of said prognosis or discuss his treatment history. (Tr. 27,
37-38, 40; GE 2, 7; AE C; SOR answer)
From  June  2001  to  March  2015,  Applicant  worked  for  employer  1  (E1)  as  a
software  engineer.  In  his  interview  with  a  defense  investigator  in  July  2019,  Applicant
admitted  that  he  signed  documents  provided  by  E1,  or  E1’s  predecessor  company,
acknowledging  that  he  was  prohibited  from  having  and  viewing  pornography  on  his
company-provided computer. In his hearing testimony, Applicant equivocated this point
stating  that  he  could  not  recall  any  specific  formal  company  policy  regarding  the
personal  use  of  a  company-issued  laptop.  He  also  stated  that  someone  told  him  he
could use his company-issued laptop for personal use, but he could not recall who that
person  was.  I  did  not  find  Applicant’s  testimony  credible.  (Tr.  23,  30,  34;  GE  2;  SOR
answer)
In February 2015, law enforcement became aware that Applicant may have  had
child  pornography  on  his  company-issued  laptop.  In  October  2015,  Applicant’s  work
laptop  was  seized  and  examined  by  law  enforcement  forensic  examiners.  The
examination  concluded  that  the  material  found  on  the  computer  was  not  child
pornography, but rather child erotica (adolescent children posed in erotic positions  with
skimpy  and/or  revealing  clothing).  Possessing  child  erotica  on  a  computer  does  not
violate  any  state  law  where  Applicant  was  located.  The  criminal  investigation  was
closed.  Applicant  admitted  have  adult  pornography  on  his  employer-provided  laptop.
(Tr. 28; GE 2, 8)
In  February 2015, Applicant’s employer put him  on administrative  leave  pending
the criminal investigation  into his alleged  computer misuse.  In  March  2015, due to the
uncertainty  of  his  computer  activities,  his  employment  was  terminated  with  E1  and  he
was directed to return all the government and E1 property issued to him. In April 2016,
he received notification from the DSS that his security clearance was suspended based
on information obtained by DOD regarding his sexual behavior and criminal conduct. In
his  SOR  answer,  he  admitted  using  his  company-issued  laptop  to  view,  upload,  and
save  images of  naked women and  scantily dressed young girls (ages  11-15) posed in
erotic  positions.  He  also  admitted  signing  company  documents  prohibiting  him  from
using his company-laptop for these purposes. (Tr. 23-24, 28-29, 34-35; GE 2, 4, 5; SOR
answer)
Applicant denied using his current company-issued computer to view, download,
or  save  any  type  of  pornographic  material.  He  documented  that  he  has  no  criminal
record  in  his  home  state,  other  than  the  1997  child  sexual  abuse  crime.  He  admitted
that  he  continues  to  view  child  erotica  on  his  personal  electronic  devices.  He  viewed
these types of images as recently as a month before his security clearance hearing. He
continues to view this material because he is sexually stimulated by viewing images of
scantily dressed  girls,  ages  11  to  15,  in  modeling  poses.  He  admitted  that  his  actions
show questionable judgment on his part. (Tr. 24-26, 28-29, 34-36; GE 2; AE B
Applicant  presented  several  “U  Rock”  awards  from  his  current  employer
recognizing  his  contributions  to  the  overall  success  of  the  company.  He  also  received
recognition for his five years of service in August 2020. (AE A)

"Applicant’s  personal  information  is  extracted  from  his  e-QIP  unless  otherwise
indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings, the hearing testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make
the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 61 years old. He lives with his wife, who he married three years ago.
She  is  a  retired  school  teacher.  She  has  two  adult  children  from  a  prior  marriage.
Applicant earned a bachelor’s and a master’s degree. He works for a defense contractor
as a senior engineering manager. (Tr. at 10-11, 17, 21, 36-37, 53, 55, 57, 60; AE B; AE
M.)
Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1978 at the age of 18. He went to Captain’s
Mast in 1981 for disrespecting his commanding officer, punching a chief warrant officer,
assault,  communicating  a  threat,  and  disobeying  orders.  In  his  background  interview,
Applicant said he did not recall the details of the incident and  only volunteered that he
had been late and was belligerent and/or yelled at his captain. When confronted with the
Government’s available details, he disagreed with the assault allegation and thought the
incident  was  just  a  verbal  altercation.  The  investigator’s  information  reflected  that
Applicant was required to serve three months in detention prior to his discharge in 1982.
The  character  of  his  discharge  was  Other  than  Honorable.  He  was  also  reduced  in
paygrade to E-2. (GE 2 at 9.)
Applicant has one  child, a  daughter, who  was born  in  1982. He  did  not  marry  his
child’s  mother, and  he  did not  raise  his daughter, though  he  paid her mother child  support.
In  the  past 15  years  he  has developed  a  paternal relationship with  his daughter, now  age
29. She  has two  minor  children. (Tr. at 10-11,  17,  21, 36-37, 53, 55, 57, 60; GE  1  at 20-
26;  GE 2 at 4; AE B; AE N.)
After the birth of his daughter, Applicant married another woman in about 1982,
shortly after his discharge  from the Navy. At the  time  of  that marriage, Applicant’s first
wife  had  two  minor  children,  a  girl  and  a  boy,  from  a  prior  marriage  or  relationship.
Applicant’s former stepdaughter (Stepdaughter 1) was born in about 1977 and his former
stepson was born in about 1976. Her mother legally changed Stepdaughter 1’s last name
to Applicant’s last name, though he never formally adopted her. In about 1993, Applicant
moved out of the marital home. He and his first wife divorced in about 1995 or 1996. (Tr.
at 21, 32-33, 36, 38, 40, 56-57, 59, 61-62.)
In about 1996 Applicant married his second wife. She also had two children, a boy
and a girl, who were teenagers at the time of the marriage. Applicant and his second wife
divorced in about 2006. (Tr. at 59.)
In January 1993, Applicant was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol
(DUI).  In  December  1993,  he  pleaded  guilty  to  the  charge,  a  misdemeanor,  and  was
sentenced to five years of probation, to end in December 1998. This offense is not alleged
in the SOR. (GE 4 at 4.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline D, Sexual Behavior)
Under Guideline D,  the Government alleges in SOR ¶ 1.a (and cross-alleges in
SOR ¶ 2.b, discussed below) that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he was
arrested  in  1995  and  charged  with  Lewd  or  Lascivious  Acts  with  a  Child  under  14.
Following  a  plea, he  was sentenced  to  one  year in jail, which  was “stayed,” placed  on
probation  for  three  years,  and  ordered  to  register  as  a  sex  offender.  Applicant  denied
these allegations in his Answer, stating that the allegation was inaccurate.
In 1995 the daughter of Applicant’s first wife (the Stepdaughter 1) accused him of
sexually molesting her over a period of several years. Applicant testified that he believed
she was about 13 years old at the time of the first allegation of abuse. According to an
official state document in the record, Stepdaughter 1 reported the abuse began in 1988.
She would have been about 11 years old at that time. She was about 18 when she filed
criminal charges against Applicant. He was arrested on April 4, 1995, and charged with
nine felony counts of Lewd and Lascivious Acts involving Children under the state penal
code. Applicant claims he has no recollection of “the details” any of the events of which
he  was  accused  over  a  multi-year  period  starting  in  1988,  though  he  does  not  deny
“something may have happened.” He testified that his lack of any memory of these events
was due to his excessive alcohol drinking habits during that period. (Tr. at 28-36, 39-40,
42, 55; GE 2 at 5; GE 4 at 1; GE 5 at 1.)
According to SOR ¶ 1.a, Applicant pled guilty to committing lewd and lascivious
act(s) with a minor, and he was sentenced to one year in jail (stayed), placed on three
years of probation, and required to register as a sex offender. Applicant claimed that he
actually pled nolo  contendere  (no  contest) to one  charge,  and the other charges  were
dismissed.  The  Government  presented  no  evidence
characterization about his plea. (Tr. at 22; GE 2 at 5.)
to  contradict  Applicant’s
Applicant  gave  several  explanations  for  why  he  pled  no  contest  to  one  of  the
charges  against  him.  He  testified  that  he  wanted  to  avoid  a  trial.  At  another  point,
Applicant explained that he pled no contest to one charge because he had no recollection
of the sexual abuse that he was accused of committing. (Tr. at 11, 19-27, 29, 45-50, 93;
GE 2 at 5; GE 4 at 1.) In his post-hearing brief, his lawyer acknowledged that Applicant
pled  to  one  of  the  charges  “to  avoid  more  punishment  if  he  was  found  guilty  at  trial.”
(Applicant’s Brief at 1.)
As part of his probation sentence, the court ordered Applicant to participate in three
years of group therapy. Applicant testified that he extended the therapy an extra two years
voluntarily because  he was “helping others.” He claimed  that as part of  his therapy, he
voluntarily  was  tested  to  determine  if  he  was  a  pedophile  and  the  test  results  were
negative.  He  also  voluntarily  attended  Alcoholics  Anonymous  and  Sex  Addicts
Anonymous meetings. (Tr. at 11, 19-27, 29, 45-50, 93.)
Applicant  noted  further  in his e-QIP  that the  “Charges [were] Expunged” in about
October 1995. At the  hearing  he  provided  a  July  18,  2008  court  document  that  stated:
“Case  dismissed  and  conviction  expunged” pursuant to  a  state  statute  that permits a  court
to  take  such  action  following  the  successful completion  of  probation. An  accompanying
court  order  provided   further  that  there  were  significant  exceptions  to   the   order  of
expungement,   including   a   requirement  that  the   original  conviction   be   disclosed   in
response  to  questions in state  questionnaires or applications and  that “the  conviction  in
this case  remains a  part of  the  court file  which  can  be  viewed  by  the  public.” (GE 1  at  33-
34; AE Q  at 1-2.)
Applicant also provided an October 26, 2021  letter from his state’s sex offender
registry  office,  in  response  to  Applicant’s  request  for  a  review  of  his  registration
requirements The State registry office indicated that it had changed his status to a “Tier
2-Adult,” which meant that he is eligible to petition for the termination of his registration
requirement under certain conditions. As of the close of the record in this case, however,
Applicant  remains  a  registered  sex  offender,  as  evidenced  by  his  Proof  of  Current
Registration, also dated October 26, 2021. (AE S at 1, 3.)
Applicant  testified  that  his  therapist  from  his  post-conviction  time  period
emphasized  that  he  should  focus  on  moving  forward  and  learning  from  his  mistakes.
Applicant  provided  no  further  information  about  his  discussions  with  his  therapist
regarding what his past mistakes were and what he was supposed to learn from them.
This is significant because Applicant claims that he recalls nothing about any incident of
sexually abusing Stepdaughter 1, including the incident to which he pled nolo contendere.
He testified: “I try not to remember that.” (Tr. at 24-26.)
Paragraph 2  (Guideline  E, Personal Conduct)
In this paragraph the Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance
because  he  has  falsified  material  facts  during  the  clearance  screening  process.
Specifically,  the  SOR  alleges  that  Applicant  provided  false  information  be  failing  to
disclose his daughter and two current stepdaughters in his e-QIP. Applicant denied the
allegation(s)  under  this  paragraph  in  his  Answer,  stating  that  the  omissions  were  not
deliberate. The SOR also cross-alleges under Guideline E the allegation under Guideline
D regarding the 1995 criminal charges  of  Lewd  and Lascivious  Acts  with  Children, his
plea, and his sentence. He did not respond separately to this allegation in his Answer.
Applicant did not list his daughter or his two stepchildren on his e-QIP. He initially
explained in his background interview that he failed to list them due to oversight. At the
hearing, he admitted that he omitted his daughter and two stepchildren because he did
not want them to become involved in his background investigation. I note that he also did
not list either his first or second wife in response to the relevant question in Section 17 of
his  e-QIP.  His  first  wife  was  the  mother  of  Stepdaughter  1,  who  accused  Applicant  of
molesting her. He answered negatively to the question of whether he had one or more
former spouses. (GE 1 at 20-26; GE 2 at 4.)
At the hearing, Applicant explained the omissions of family members and former
spouses  in  his  e-QIP  was  due  to  fact  he  did  not  want  his  daughter  or  his  current
stepchildren to be interviewed in connection with his security clearance investigation. He
was  particularly  concerned  about  his  daughter  being  contacted  by  Government
investigators. (Tr. at 28-36, 39-40, 42, 55.)
In his background interview, Applicant advised the investigator about his daughter
and two stepdaughters, as well as  his two prior wives. He told the investigator that he
would provide their names and information at a later date.  He subsequently called the
investigator and declined to provide the information. He said that he was afraid that the
individuals  would  be  contacted  and  interviewed  regarding  his  criminal  record.  He  also
said he was concerned that his employer would find out about his history and that would
put  his  employment  in  jeopardy.  The  next  day  he  provided  the  information  about  his
daughter  and  two  stepdaughters  to  the  investigator.  He  repeated  that  his  child  and
stepchildren were not listed in his e-QIP due to oversight. (GE 2 at 4, 8-10.)
At the hearing, Applicant was questioned about his statements about these family
members during his background interview. He testified:
The   oversight  was  made   because   I  was  trying   to   protect  my   natural
daughter,  and  to  be  honest, I  didn’t  think I  would get the   –  I was trying  to
delay the  process of the application.
(Tr. at 63.) He was also questioned whether his daughter was aware of the accusations
against  him,  the  court  proceedings,  and  his  status  as  a  registered  sex  offender.  His
response was: “Not in detail.” His two current stepchildren know a limited amount about
his criminal history. He testified: “Beyond that, I try to keep it in the past and not bring it
up.” (Tr. at 63-65, 76-80.)
In  his  2019  e-QIP,  Applicant  also  disclosed  limited  information  about  his  1995
arrest  and  charges.  In  response  to  a  question  in  Section  22  regarding  Police  Record
asking for “a description of the specific nature of  the offense,” Applicant wrote “PC 290
offense.” This reference is to the state sex registration statute, not the criminal statute he
was  charged  with  violating,  i.e.,  Penal  Code  Section  288(a).  At  the  hearing,  Applicant
said:  “I figured  that [response] would suffice.” He denied  that  he  was trying  to  hide  the
true nature of his felony offense from his security manager or employer by not giving more
specific information as required by the question. He thought it was best not to elaborate
on his criminal record. As far as Applicant knows, no one at his employer is aware of his
criminal record. (Tr. at 66-67, 78-79; GE 1 at 33-34.)
In addition, in detailing his 1993 DUI offense on his 2019 e-QIP, Applicant failed to
disclose the dates of his probation as required by a specific question in Section 22 of the
e-QIP. (GE 1 at 33; GE 2 at 5, 7; GE 4 at 4.) These omissions are not alleged in the SOR
so I cannot consider them as disqualifying conduct. (The DUI itself was also not alleged.)
But I considered them in weighing mitigation and under the whole-person concept.
Mitigation
Applicant testified that he makes an effort to stay away from children when he can.
For instance, he and his wife do not babysit any grandchildren. He has made this choice
to  be  conservative  and  to  avoid  the  possibility  of  any  accusations  against  him  or  any
troubling perceptions. Under his ongoing status as a registered sex offender, he is not
allowed to work in schools or other jobs that involve contact with children. (Tr. ??)
Applicant is not involved in any kind of therapy. He testified that he occasionally
goes to church. The focus of his court-ordered therapy in the 1990s was on issues related
to  sexual  attraction  to  children,  specifically  family  sexual  abuse.  It  was  not  alcohol
addiction  therapy.  He  drinks  alcohol  occasionally,  but  he  claims  he  never  drinks  to
excess. The last time he drank excessively was more than 20 years ago. His focus is on
moving forward. (Tr. at 61-63, 68-71, 75-77.)
In the years since his Other than Honorable discharge from the Navy, Applicant
has  educated  himself  and  has  had  a  successful  career.  He  presented  his  recent
performance evaluations, which show that he is well-regarded by his employer. He earns
about $170,0000 annually, and receives bonuses every year of $16,000 to $20,000. (Tr.
at 74-75; AE A-D; AE D.)

"As  to  SOR  allegation  ¶  1.a,  and  the  cross-allegations  (SOR  ¶¶  2.a  and  3.b),
Applicant  admitted  that  his  employment  was  terminated  as  alleged,  but  he  otherwise
denied the allegations. He denied the allegation at SOR ¶ 3.b. His answers also included
narrative explanations. Applicant’s admissions and explanations are incorporated into the
findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits
submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  65  years old. He and his second wife married in 1991. She moved
across the country to take a new job in summer 2011; he filed for divorce in June 2012,
and moved out of the marital home soon thereafter. (AE A at ¶ 16; Tr. 26, 76-77, 105-106)
They divorced in September 2014. (GE 1 at 22-23; Tr. 75-76) Applicant remarried in June
2017. (GE 1 at 21)
Applicant has a master’s degree and a Ph.D., both in nuclear engineering. (Tr. 24)
He has been employed in the defense industry, with security clearances, for most of the
last 35 years, since at least 1987. (GE 1 at 14-17, 53-54, Tr. 25) He said he did not hold a
clearance at the time of the hearing. (Tr. 8)
From 2002 until May 2017 when he was terminated, Applicant worked for company
1. At the time, Applicant was the company’s chief strategy and technology officer, as well
as acting senior vice president and general manager. (GE 1; Tr. 98) Applicant has worked
for his current employer since July 2018, and is now the chief operating officer. (GE 1 at
14; Tr. 102)
In September 2015, company 1 was acquired by a venture capital firm. A month
later, half of Applicant’s responsibilities were re-organized under someone else. He came
to believe he was being undermined. In January 2016, Applicant refused to sign an annual
ethics certification because he believed the business plan submitted to the venture capital
firm was inaccurate. The company’s general counsel, Mr. F., requested that Applicant file a
confidential ethics complaint. The company’s human resources (HR) director nonetheless
soon learned about it. (AE A at ¶¶ 20-28; Tr. 29-31)
Applicant then offered his resignation but was soon promoted to chief strategy and
technology officer, with primary responsibility for company 1’s business with the U.S. Navy.
AE A at ¶¶ 29-31; Tr. 72-73, 103) At the height of his responsibilities, Applicant had 900
full-time and part-time employees. (Tr. 74) In the process, another employee, Mr. C, was
demoted, and Applicant became Mr. C’s supervisor. (AE A at ¶ 34; Tr. 31-32) For the next
several  months,  Applicant  had  a  dispute  with  his  superiors  over  the  fairness  of  his
performance bonus and salary increase, especially compared with Mr. C. He also sought to
remove Mr. C due to ethics violations and sexual harassment complaints against Mr. C
made by female employees. (AE A at ¶¶ 34-50; Tr. 32-36)
In  May  2017,  company  1  conducted  an  investigation  into  Applicant’s  workplace
conduct, including a romantic relationship with a subordinate employee in Applicant’s chain
of command, and the company’s discovery that Applicant had accessed and downloaded
an extensive collection of pornography on company computer systems. (GE 4) This alleged
conduct, as detailed in GE 4, is the basis for the allegations and cross-allegations in the
SOR. The Government offered GE 4 with redactions, as they received it from company 1.
(Tr. 18)
Government Exhibit 4 was prepared by company 1’s general counsel, Mr. F. Review
of  the  report  indicates  that  the  investigation  was  initiated  when  Mr.  F  learned  of  the
relationship between Applicant and the subordinate employee in 2017, after the employee
raised concerns about working for Applicant, given their prior romantic involvement. (GE 4
at 2)
The company’s investigation concluded that Applicant had pursued and engaged in
a long-term relationship with a subordinate employee through early 2016. The report noted
that e-mails between Applicant and the employee also showed at various points that he
expressed his love for her, pressed her to commit to him, and provided her gifts, such as
flowers  and  jewelry.  (GE  4  at  4)  The  company  concluded  that  he  did  not  report  the
relationship  to  the  company,  and  did  not  take  other  steps  to  mitigate  any  risks  to  the
company,  such  as  potential  claims  of  sexual  harassment  or  a  hostile  workplace
environment, or favoritism towards the subordinate employee in the promotion process,
either real or perceived. (GE 4 at 1-2, 4)
Applicant  acknowledged  that  between  August  and  December  2012,  he  had  a
consensual sexual relationship with S, an administrative assistant at company 1. He said S
reported to a manager who reported to Applicant. He said that S initiated the relationship.
He said the sexual relationship lasted between August and December 2012, and did not
resume after that. (AE A at ¶ 2-3; Tr. 26, 48, 77-78, 81-82, 84, 104-105)
Applicant said that he was never S’s direct supervisor, but he said he approved
promotions or raises recommended to him by her direct supervisor. (AE A at ¶ 14; Tr. 27,
49, 79-81) Applicant said that S remained in his chain of command until he was promoted
out  of  the  organization.  (Tr.  50)  He  is  not  aware  of  a  company  1  policy  prohibiting  a
romantic relationship such as between himself and S. (Tr. 89)
Applicant  said  he  confirmed  the  relationship  to  company  1’s  human  resources
director in 2013 once he was asked about it. He said that that the CEO told him that he
should not have mentioned the relationship to a former company 1 employee, but that the
company took no disciplinary action against Applicant at the time. (AE A at ¶¶ 4-7; Tr. 27,
52-53, 81, 103-104)
To separate himself from S, Applicant moved to another branch office in the area for
about nine months; he also moved to another area office on two occasions, also to avoid
S. Applicant testified that their sexual relationship did not extend beyond late 2012, though
he  said  that  both  parties  later  sought  to  renew  the  relationship,  for  different  reasons,
between 2013 and 2015. Applicant testified that he wanted a more public relationship, and
while she at times sought to renew their affair, she wished to remain married. (AE A at ¶¶
8-13; Tr. 28, 52-54, 81-86, 106-111)
Applicant and his third wife met online in about 2015, became serious by early 2016
and married in 2017. (Tr. 89-90) They now live in a state across the country from where
Applicant lived when he was at company 1, and are happily married. Applicant regrets the
relationship with S and says there is no chance it will recur. (Tr. 47)
The rest of GE 4 concerns company 1’s discovery that Applicant had downloaded,
accessed, or stored “an extensive collection of pornography” on company-owned computer
systems. Mr. F reported that on Tuesday, May 2, 2017, he entered Applicant’s office during
normal business hours while Applicant was travelling and found an external hard drive
(EHD) on Applicant’s desk. The report indicates that Mr. F opened the drive and viewed, or
attempted to view, its contents. (GE 4 at 2)
In GE 4, Mr. F reported that the contents of three directories on the drive included
over 100 playlists and over 100 video clips, saved to the directory in 2009 or 2010, many
with sexually suggestive file names, as well as several hundred files, in Microsoft Word or
Acrobat PDF format, some of an “explicit sexual nature,” saved to the directory between
2007 and 2012. (GE 4 at 2-3)
The report indicates that Mr. F found these materials on Tuesday, May 2, 2017. (GE
4 at 2) The report also indicates that “based on these preliminary findings, on Monday, May
1, 2017, [sic] [Mr. F] asked the IT department to remotely access Applicant’s [company 1-
provided] computer” for additional evidence of risk to the company. (GE 4 at 3) (In seeking
to undermine GE 4. Applicant and his counsel drew attention to this date discrepancy,
noting that Mr. F could not have sought assistance from the IT department the day before
he found the inappropriate materials on the EHD. This date discrepancy is unexplained)
On May 3, 2017, Company 1’s IT department notified Mr. F that they had found 50
gigabytes of “suspect video and movie files” found to contain file names suggesting they
contained pornographic images, videos, and documents. Later that day, they notified Mr. F
that “the offending files had been deleted by someone.” The IT department also found a
spreadsheet titled “Recent Downloads list 4-8-17” and a document detailing Applicant’s
personal account information for his membership on an adult website, sent to his personal
e-mail address. Mr. F printed the spreadsheet, which identified 280 unique files, identified
by words and descriptors that “strongly suggest the existence of hardcore pornography.”
GE 4 at 3) According to GE 4, a review of Applicant’s e-mail files also showed that from his
company account to his personal email, he sent “a 50-page document titled ‘movielist.txt’
that identified the contents of an additional portable device containing more than 1,300
files,” many with file names containing explicit pornographic terms. (GE 4 at 4) The memo
from Mr. F is in the record (GE 4), but the underlying computer data is not.
Company 1’s internet policy prohibited “browsing explicit pornographic . . . or other
sites determined to be inappropriate” and “posting, sending, or acquiring sexually explicit or
sexually  oriented  .  .  .  or  other  material  determined  to  be  inappropriate.”  (GE  4  at  4)
Applicant testified that he was “absolutely” aware of that policy, since he had reviewed it,
commented on it, and approved it. (Tr. 97-98)
On May 8, 2017, Applicant attended a morning meeting in a conference room at
company 1’s offices. (Tr. 40) He also had an office there. He believes that, when he left his
office for the meeting, his personal EHD was in his briefcase. (AE A at ¶¶ 60-62; Tr. 40-41)
When Applicant arrived at the meeting, Mr. C was there, though he left the room for 10-15
minutes before coming back. (AE A at ¶ 62; Tr. 41)
Applicant was away from his office all day, until about 6 PM. When he returned, the
company general counsel, Mr. F, and the chief operating officer, Mr. S., entered his office
to talk to him. They told him that a large amount of pornography had been found on his
company tablet. They did not show him evidence of what they had found. AE A at ¶ 65; Tr.
42-43)
Applicant noticed that both his personal EHD and the company EHD were on his
desk. (Tr. 42) He said Mr. F picked up both the personal and company EHD, saw a label
on the personal item and put it down. (Tr. 71, 94) Applicant’s company tablet and company
EHD were seized, but they did not access the personal EHD at that time. (Tr. 71) Applicant
was told he was being placed on administrative leave. He packed his personal items and
was escorted from the building. (AE A at ¶ 65; Tr. 43-44)
The May 13, 2017 company 1 report concluded that “as the senior-most manager
leading a significant share of [company 1’s] business, [Applicant’s] behavior and judgment
sets the wrong example and tone at the top, violates our Policies and Code, and exposes
[company  1]  to  significant  legal  and  reputational  risk.”  (GE  4  at  4)  Mr.  F’s  conclusion,
following  consultation  with  outside  employment  counsel,  was  that  Applicant  should  be
immediately terminated for cause. (GE 4 at 4)
Applicant  was  called  to  a  meeting  on  May  15,  2017,  with  all  of  the  company’s
executive  managers.  Mr.  F  told  him  that  “they  found  a  large  amount  of  pornographic
material on my [company 1] tablet” and that he was being dismissed as a result. (Tr. 44)
Then  and  subsequently,  Applicant  requested  to  be  shown  what  was  found  but  was
rebuffed. (Tr. 45) The record does not include a termination letter from company 1, but it is
reasonable to infer that he was terminated for cause given the findings and conclusions in
in GE 4 and the fact that he was terminated soon thereafter.
Applicant’s termination led to an incident report in the Defense Department’s JPAS.
(GE 3). I therefore infer that he had a clearance at the time, as otherwise an incident report
in JPAS would not have been made.
Applicant testified that company 1 had issued him a Microsoft “tablet” computer, as
well as a company-issued external hard drive (EHD), to back up the tablet and to provide
space for an e-mail archive. The tablet was not suitable for working at home, so he used
his personal computer. He also used a personal EHD to transfer company 1 information
(work files) between his personal home computer and his work tablet. (AE A at ¶¶ 51-55;
Tr. 36-38, 55-58, 96, 107-108)
Applicant’s personal EHD and the company-issued EHD looked alike, so he labeled
the personal EHD as such. (AE A at ¶ 56, Tr. 58) He would connect the personal EHD to
the company tablet only when transferring company data to work on at home, or when
transferring company data back to his company tablet after he did so. Otherwise, he kept
his personal EHD in his briefcase. (AE A at ¶¶ 57-58; Tr. 38-39, 64) He said he was careful
to  delete  proprietary  information  from  both  his  personal  EHD  and  his  personal  home
computer. (Tr. 59)
Applicant testified that he was asked to keep the company EHD at his office and not
“carry  it  around”  because  it  contained  company  proprietary  information.  (Tr.  37)  He
acknowledged transporting the company EHD between his various company workspaces
(he had three offices) but did not take it home or on travel. (Tr. 55-56, 59, 107-108) He was
not comfortable using a “thumb drive” for fear of losing it. (Tr. 60-61)
Applicant acknowledged viewing pornography on his personal computer beginning
after he and his second wife separated in 2011. He said he did so only at home. (Tr. 95,
107)  He  testified  that  he  did  not  use  his  personal  EHD  for  that  purpose.  (Tr.  91-92).
However,  in  AE  A,  his  affidavit,  Applicant  stated  that,  “on  my  personal  EHD,  I  stored
images that could be described as pornographic” but not illegal. (AE A at ¶ 55)
Applicant  acknowledged  that  it  was  “possible”  that  he  had  transferred  or
downloaded  pornographic  files  from  his  personal  computer  to  his  personal  EHD.  He
testified, “I don’t specifically recall purposely doing it, but I ran backups. It was possible that
the scope of the backup included some of those files. . . . I can’t say for certain that I did
not.”  (Tr.  61-62)  “Yes,  it’s possible.  I  certainly  didn’t  do  it  intentionally.” (Tr. 96-97)  He
maintained a “robust firewall” for virus and malware protection on his personal computer
and believed it to be better than what the company used. (Tr. 62) Applicant acknowledged
that he could have accessed his personal files from the company tablet. (Tr. 65)
Applicant denied storing pornography on company assets: “All I can say is I did not
put  it  there.”  (Tr.  95-96)  He  denied  downloading  and  saving  pornographic  content  on
company  assets  during  working  hours.  (Tr.  65)  Applicant  “absolutely”  denied  using  a
company  1  computer,  tablet,  or  EHD  to  view  pornography.  (Tr.  92)  “I  did  not  put
pornography  on  [company  1’s]  owned  tablet,”  or  on  any  piece  of  company  computing
equipment.  (Tr.  38,  47-48,  66)  Applicant  “never  stored  or  accessed  any  inappropriate
personal images, videos, or documents” on the company 1 tablet, the company EHD, or
through any company technology. (AE A at ¶ 59; Tr. 54-55)
Applicant did not recall e-mailing a 50-page movie list file from his work e-mail to his
personal e-mail (as noted in GE 4) and said, “I don’t know why I’d do it. . . . It just doesn’t
make sense to me.” (Tr. 98-99) He testified that he would have no reason to put files such
as “recent downloads list 4/8/17” or “movielist.txt” on the company 1 tablet. (Tr. 67)  He
acknowledged,  however  that  it  was  “possible”  that  he  had  a  movie  list  file  or a  recent
download file concerning pornographic video or imagery on his personal computer, and
that he “may have” maintained such a list on his personal computer, but did not recall
specifically. “Because certainly in 2017 I was living with my current wife. So there may well
have been files created at an earlier date. Say before June of 2016.” (Tr. 67-68) He said he
did not remember creating such a document, and did not know why it would be on his work
computer. (Tr. 99, 100) He acknowledged, however, that “I might have created a – a file
that had an earlier date, or no date at all, but . . . only on my personal computer.” (Tr. 100)
Applicant did not recall having a membership to a specific adult website, or visiting
that specific website on his personal computer; that website was listed in GE 4 as having
been discovered on his work computer. He said it was possible that the company’s firewall
let some inappropriate e-mails through and he clicked on them by mistake, but deleted
them quickly. He recalled asking company IT to “beef up” their e-mail firewall to stop such
e-mails and access to such sites. (Tr. 69-70, 99)
Applicant no longer uses a company EHD to transfer professional files between
home and work. He has a work laptop with a docking station at home that he uses instead.
He does not keep work or proprietary files on his personal computer. (Tr. 109-110)
Applicant has not been in counseling or therapy with respect to pornography. (Tr.
101) He continues to view pornography at home, including occasionally with his wife. (Tr.
91, 100)
Applicant believes that other employees of company 1 had professional access to
administrative passwords, as he did, and “easily could access any [company 1] laptop or
tablet and insert files onto that computing equipment.” (AE A at ¶¶ 69-71; Tr. 45-47) He
believes that company 1 “either invented any ‘evidence’ it claimed that it had, or, while I
was  away  from  my  desk,  someone  connected  that  personal  [EHD]  to  the  tablet  and
uploaded pornographic images from that personally owned external drive to the tablet.” (AE
A at ¶ 72) He believes that the real reason he was terminated was “because I had called
out several instances of unethical behavior and business practices in the company.” (AE A
at ¶ 77)
On  his  September  2018  SCA,  Applicant  disclosed  that  he  had  been  fired  from
company 1 for “alleged misuse of computer” and “I was told that pornographic files had
been found on computer equipment in my possession.” He also noted that this was shortly
after he had filed formal complaints about another employee for sexual harassment of
female employees “and lying to me about statements made by my staff.” (GE 1 at 16, 17)
Applicant  answered  “No”  to  the  following  question  on  his  SCA  concerning
unauthorized or unlawful use of information technology systems:
In  the  last  seven  (7)  years  have  you  introduced,  removed,  or  used
hardware, software, or media in connection with any information technology
system  without  authorization,  when  specifically  prohibited  by  rules,
procedures, guidelines, or regulations or attempted any of the above? (GE 1
at 57)
Applicant’s July 2019 background interview summary reflects that he was confronted
with  apparent  evidence,  through  an  interview  with  a  coworker,  of  the  fact  that  an
investigation  of  Applicant’s  laptop  found  pornography  linked  to  Applicant’s  username,
password, and times and dates when he was logged in to the computer. (GE 2 at 2) The
coworker is not identified and no specifics are provided, let alone documented, in GE 2. In
the interview, Applicant denied any knowledge of the images. (GE 2 at 2) The remainder of
Applicant’s  background  interview  largely  concerns  the  sexual  harassment  allegations
against Mr. C and Applicant’s efforts to bring them to light; the May 2017 meeting with
company officials that led to Applicant’s termination; Applicant’s assumption that Mr. C had
something  to  do  with  transferring  pornographic  files  onto  Applicant’s  computer,  and
Applicant’s discussion of his affair with S. (GE 2 at 2)
Work and Character References
J testified both as a character witness and a fact witness for Applicant. He has been
a  lawyer  for  almost  40  years,  with  about  17-18  years  as  general  counsel  for  various
defense contractors. He was general counsel for company 1 from 2004 to February 2010,
when Applicant was there, and has known him since then. (Tr. 124-126, 137) J is now in
private practice. (He was also Applicant’s original counsel in this case, and filed Applicant’s
answer to the SOR, though he did not testify in that capacity). (Tr. 142-143)
As  an  in-house  general  counsel,  J  handled  many  company  investigations  of
pornography on company computers. As such, J in his testimony took issue with company
1’s  handing  of  the  investigation  in  this  case.  He  testified  that  such  investigations  are
typically discovered and investigated by HR and not by the legal department, though the
legal department would review the findings. (Tr. 127-128, 133-134) He also believes that
company 1’s legal department should have considered recusing itself from the investigation
because the subject of the investigation was a senior company officer, as were others
potentially involved. (Tr. 135) J also questioned the findings of the report, that there was
evidence of pornography on work computers and any download of such materials during
work hours, to support the conclusions in GE 4 that such conduct was established. (Tr.
135-136)
J acknowledged, however, that if it were confirmed that pornography was found on
an  employee’s  work  computer,  it  was  best  practice,  even  “essential,”  to  escort  that
employee from the building immediately and place the employee on either paid or unpaid
leave. (Tr. 128) He also said where there was reasonable basis to believe such employee
misconduct had taken place, “it’s not a high bar.” (Tr. 128)
J described Applicant as a brilliant intellectual, with both an engineering background
and a “common sense” notion of how a business runs. (Tr. 138-139) He said Applicant has
impeccable moral character, and an excellent sense of ethics, including as company 1’s
chief ethics officer. He is highly trustworthy and warrants being granted clearance eligibility.
(Tr. 140-141, 145-146) Prior to his legal representation of Applicant, J was not aware of
Applicant’s  sexual  relationship  with  a  subordinate  employee.  J  has  never  put  false
information into an investigative report, nor would he ever do so. (Tr. 143-144)
Mr. M is a retired U.S. Navy captain and naval aviator, and a former employee of
company 1. He was a company vice president who reported directly to Applicant. They had
daily interaction, and often travelled together for work. They worked together for several
months, about five years ago. They had met previously when Mr. M ran another company.
(Tr. 115-119)
Mr. M was with Applicant the day Applicant was escorted out of the building. Mr. M
heard days later that this happened because pornography had been found on a company
laptop, “which struck me as really weird for a guy like [Applicant] who is smart as heck to
do something so stupid, but he was gone, so I just let it go at that.” (Tr. 120) Mr. M left
company 1 about two months after Applicant was terminated. (Tr. 120)
Mr. M regards Applicant as someone of the highest intellect, one of the “top five”
people  in  terms  of  intellect  that  he  has  met  in  40  years  of  professional  and  military
experience. He testified to Applicant’s intelligence and “flawless” character, and attested
that  his  judgment  and  trustworthiness  were  “beyond  reproach.”  He  was  not  aware  of
Applicant’s relationship with S at the time it was occurring (Mr. M also was not working
there  at  the  time). (Tr. 117-119) Mr. M  regards  Applicant  as a great American and an
intellectual asset to the country. The fact that he may have had “something stupid on his
computer is completely out of character.” (Tr. 121-122)
Mr. M also testified that he was aware of a sexual harassment claim made against
Mr. C by a woman who worked for Mr. M. Mr. M directed that she should report the matter
to HR. He also reported it to Applicant. (Tr. 116)

",False
"Under Guideline D, the Government alleged that in November 2017, Applicant was
arrested and charged with forcible sexual assault, pleaded guilty to a different included
charge, was ordered to register as a sex offender, and  will be on supervised probation
until  November  2022  (SOR  1.a).  The  SOR  1.a  allegations  was  cross-alleged  under
Guideline J (SOR 2.a) and Guideline E (SOR 3.a).
Under Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed $25,413 for three
delinquent  or  past-due  debts  (SOR  4.a  –  4.c);  and  that  he  did  not  file  as  required  his
federal (SOR 4.d) and state (SOR 4.e) income tax returns for the 2017 tax year.
In response to the SOR (Answer), Applicant denied with explanation the allegation
at  SOR  1.a,  and  by  reference,  the  SOR  2.a  and  3.a  allegations.  He  denied  with
explanations and supporting documents all of the Guideline F allegations. (Answer) After
reviewing  the  pleadings,  as  well  as  the  testimony  and  exhibits  produced  at  hearing,  I
make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 54 years old. He and his wife have been married since May 1989 and
they have two grown children. Applicant served on active duty in the United States Army
from July 1986 until retiring as a senior non-commissioned officer (NCO) in October 2010.
While on active  duty,  he deployed  at least four times  to  combat zones in  Afghanistan,
Iraq, and elsewhere. Applicant has a 100 percent disability rating from the Department of
Veterans  Affairs  (VA).  His  service-related  disabilities  include  post-traumatic  stress
disorder (PTSD). After retiring from the Army in 2010, Applicant was hired by a defense
contractor for work on a training contract. He has continued to do the same work, but for
different employers, as each  company succeeded the other in winning the contract for
that work. Applicant has worked for his current employer since at least 2019; however,
he has been unable to work since early 2020 pending final adjudication of his security
clearance. Applicant has held a security clearance at various levels of access since early
in his Army career. (GX 1; GX 2; AX B; Tr. 34 – 35, 48 – 50)
Applicant has lived and worked in State A since at least 2010. In November 2017,
Applicant was sent to a military facility in State B on temporary duty. He once had been
assigned  in  that  area  of  State  B  while  on  active  duty  and  took  advantage  of  the
assignment  to  visit  some  old  familiar  places  while  there.  One  of  those  places  was  a
nightclub where he decided to take in a band that was playing there. In trying to cope with
PTSD,  Applicant  had  not  consumed  alcohol  for  almost  a  year  prior;  however,  at  the
nightclub on the night of November 16, 2017, Applicant had four mixed drinks and two
shots of tequila. That evening he also met a woman (J) who went with Applicant back to
his hotel room where they had sex. Applicant claimed, in his PSI and during his testimony,
that J did not want to go home because her boyfriend would be mad for some reason.
Whereupon,  Applicant  offered  to  take  J  to  his  hotel  room.  When  they  got  there,  they
engaged in what he insists was consensual sex. (Answer; GX 2; GX 3)
During  his  personal  subject  interview  (PSI)  with  a  government  investigator  on
February 22, 2019, Applicant stated he did not see J drink at the nightclub, that he did
not smell alcohol on her breath, and that she did not appear to him to be impaired. He
also stated that he believed she was able to consent to having sex with him and that they
engaged in consensual sex that evening. However, at hearing, he testified that he noticed
her eyes were “glassy” before they went to his hotel room. He further acknowledged that
she may have been under the influence of something other than alcohol and that such an
impairment  could  render  J  unable  to  knowingly  consent  to  having  sex  with  him.
Applicant’s sexual encounter with J was not the first time he had engaged in extra-marital
sexual relations. (GX 2; Tr. 28 – 29, 33, 56 – 57)
In   his PSI,   Applicant   stated   that  after he   and   J  finished  having   sex,  she   quickly
gathered  her things and  left. He  further  averred  that he  went to  work the  next day, but
when  he  returned  the  local police  were waiting  for him. J had  apparently  told the  hotel
front desk on  her way out the  night before   that she  had  been  raped. Applicant did not
explain  why  police  were  not called  when  she  reported  what had  happened.  Indeed,  court
records  produced  by  the  Government  show  an  arrest  on  November 17,  2017, at  12:45
a.m.  (GX   3   at   p.   2)  After  questioning   Applicant  about   what  had   happened,  the   police
arrested  him  and  charged  him  with  felony  sexual assault by  force  or submission. Because
it was the  Thanksgiving  holiday, Applicant  spent five  days in jail before he  could obtain
bail. He notified his employer upon his release from jail about what had happened, hired
a local attorney, then returned home to State A. (GX 2; Tr. 26 – 27)
In October 2018, Applicant agreed to a plea deal whereby he pleaded guilty to a
lesser included felony of sexual assault on a person whose ability to consent is impaired
by drugs  or alcohol.  He  testified  that  he  would  have  preferred to  go  to  trial,  especially
because  it was  doubtful J  would  have  appeared  to  testify.  He  averred  that  she  was  in
drug rehab in another state around the time the trial would have started. He was ordered
to complete sex offender counseling, register in State B as a sex offender, and assessed
$5,650 in court costs. Applicant was also placed on probation until November 2022. His
probation  is still in  place  and  requires him to  report to a probation  officer each month.
Applicant is no longer on the sex offender registry in either State A or B. Applicant’s wife
is aware of his arrest, but it is not clear from this record if his wife knows about his other
extra-marital  affairs.  Applicant  claims  their  marriage  is  now  much  stronger  for  having
worked through this issue. He also is more dedicated to his religious beliefs and he has
completely stopped drinking. (GX 2; GX 3; Tr. 29 – 33)
Applicant claims he accepted the plea deal because he did not think he could get
a fair trial given prevailing public opinion in State B in response to national news reports
of  sexual  mistreatment  of  women.  He  also  did  not  want  to  continue  paying  legal  fees
because, before his arrest he already was dealing with financial difficulties in the form of
past-due or delinquent credit cards. He had paid off most of his debts and did not have
sufficient cash on hand to pay his lawyer out of pocket. The three credit card debts alleged
in the SOR were incurred during the summer of 2019 as he used them to pay his legal
fees. In response to the SOR and at his hearing, Applicant established that he has repaid
those three debts, and that he has finished repaying his older debts, by obtaining a debt
consolidation loan and by refinancing the mortgage on his house with an equity cash-out
of about $29,000. (Answer; GX 2 – 5; AX A; Tr. 29 – 31, 35 – 40)
As  alleged  at  SOR  4.d  and  4.e,  Applicant  did  not  timely file  his  state  or federal
income tax returns for the 2017 tax year. In response, Applicant provided information that
established his failure to file was inadvertent – the result of miscommunication with the
tax preparer he was using at the time. He filed the returns as soon as he learned of the
discrepancy and established repayment plans for any taxes owed. (Answer; Tr. 40 – 43)
Applicant’s current finances appear stable. He has not incurred  any new unpaid
debts. In addition to his defense contractor income, his wife earns money through part-
time  employment,  and  he  receives  recently-increased  VA  disability  benefits,  Social
Security benefits, and military retired pay. His total household income after deductions is
estimated at $10,000 monthly, which provides Applicant and his wife ample positive cash
flow each month.  (GX 5; AX A; AX B; Tr. 44 – 47, 51 – 52)

"Applicant denied all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review of
the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant is 33 years old. He married in 2017. He earned a bachelor’s degree in
2018. He does not have children. He has been employed by a federal contractor since
January 2019. (Transcript (Tr.) 16-17)
Applicant testified that he was recruited while in college by the federal government
for a potential job. The interview process was over a three-day period in May 2014 and
included a polygraph examination. He testified he was not fully prepared for the process.
The SOR alleges that from 2010 to 2014, Applicant viewed child pornography. During the
polygraph interview, Applicant was questioned about viewing child pornography. He told
the investigator that in 2010 he became bored with legal pornography and searched the
internet using the following search words: incest, mother and daughter, brother and sister,
mother and son, young girls, young lesbians, teens, and girls. (Tr. 18-20 GE 3
Applicant  told  the  polygraph  examiner,  he  viewed  the  following  sites:  “Anime”,
“Hard Core”, “Beautiful Girl”, and “Motherless” image boards. He viewed these sites about
every  other  day  from  2010  to  2014.  He  viewed  other  sites  with  images  and  videos
consisting of brothers and sisters, mothers and daughters, and mothers and sons having
sexual intercourse. He reported that he viewed these images about every other day from
2011 to 2014. (GE 3)
During Applicant’s  interview with the polygraph examiner, he stated some of the
images were of children between the ages of 14 and 18 years old. He would masturbate
to the images and videos. He said that the “Beautiful Girl” image board contained images
of  females  ranging from  14  to  30  years old. He  reported he masturbated to images  of
females as young as 14 years old. He reported that on less than 30 occasions, he viewed
and masturbated to pornographic images of females he believed were under 18 years
old. (GE 3)
Applicant  also  reported  to  the  polygraph  examiner  that  for  approximately  three
months, sometime  between  2011  and  2012, he  visited  a  “Motherless” board daily, and
recalled masturbating to an underage female who he estimated to be between 14 and 18
years old. He told the polygraph examiner that in the video, the female was masturbating,
and he described her as having breasts and pubic hair, but he knew she was underage
due to her young looking face. At his hearing, he testified and explained that he had his
hands down his pants, but then clicked off the video and he did not have any indication
of her age, but she looked younger. He confirmed that the polygraph examiner accurately
reported what he told her. (Tr. 43-44)
Applicant reported to the polygraph examiner that from 2010 to March 2014, he
was addicted to pornography and stopped viewing it the day he received a conditional
letter of employment from a government agency in March 2014, and he did not intend to
view pornography again. (GE 3)
Applicant  reported  to  the  polygraph  examiner,  with  specificity,  other  types  of
pornography that he viewed that is not illegal, such as anime pornography, and bestiality.
He  also  viewed  Anime  images  of  children  performing  sexual  acts.  These  are  cartoon
images and not real people. (Tr. 44-45; GE 3)
In May 2019, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator as part of a
background  investigation.  During  the  interview,  he  told  the  investigator  that  he  never
intentionally  searched  for  child  pornography,  however  when  visiting  mainstream
pornography  websites,  there  would  be  advertisements  and  videos  that  appeared  to
include  child  pornography.  He  told  the  investigator  he  did  not  watch  any  videos  that
contained child  pornography.  He  could not provide  the dates  or years he encountered
these videos. He said it was only two or three times that he encountered these kinds of
videos when he was on websites. He told the investigator that he had no motivation to
access  child  pornography  and  would  only  come  across  it  accidentally.  He  told  the
investigator that he is now married and no longer visits pornography sites and it will not
happen in the future. (Tr. 45-50; GE 2)
Applicant’s  explanation  for  his  statement  to  the  investigator  that  minimized  his
behavior  as  reported  to  the  polygraph  examiner  was  that  he  was  not  actively  and
consistently looking for underage material. He claimed when he realized there was child
pornography on a site he would click it off. Applicant admitted that his statement to the
investigator that he had not watched any videos that included child pornography was not
the full truth.  He said he  was unsure of  the age  of  the female  in the above-mentioned
video  and  turned  off  the  video.  His  testimony  is  not  credible.  He  deliberately provided
false statements to the government investigator. (Tr. 49-51)
Applicant testified that he grew up in a sheltered family environment and attended
church.  He  said  he  was  asked  during  his  polygraph  about  viewing  pornography.  He
testified that he  spent most of  his time  visiting adult pornography sites  and for a short
period of time he viewed other sites. He would click on sites that he was unaware of what
types  of  images  they  contained.  He  said  it was  not  uncommon  to  see  stuff  he  did  not
expect. He testified that he did not intentionally search for sites with child pornography.
He explained that this period of his life is in his past and he has attempted to disassociate
himself with this lifestyle. (Tr. 20-23)
Applicant testified that he believes the polygraph examiner inaccurately reported
his conduct. He stated that he felt he was telling the polygraph examiner the truth, but it
was being  “conflated.” (Tr. 25) He admitted  that he  did not believe  the  polygraph  examiner
had  a  personal bias against  him. He testified  that he  was on  the  websites: “Anime”, “Hard
Core”,   “Beautiful  Girls”,  and   “Motherless,”   and   he   told   the   polygraph   examiner  that  he
visited  pornography  sites every other day. He believes now  his frequency  of  viewing  such
sites was less than  he  said to  the  polygraph  examiner. He  disagreed  with  the  polygraph
examiner’s summary that stated  he was viewing females between  the  ages of 14 and  18
every  other day. He explained he  was viewing  pornography  every  other day, but he  was
not  viewing  females 14 to 18 years old.  (Tr. 23-26, 30-31)
Applicant  stated  that  he  had  viewed  100  videos  of  Anime  pornography,  as  was
stated in the polygraph examiners summary of interview, and some may have included
Anime  children  between  5  and  10  years  old.  He  emphasized  that  he  did  not  seek  out
viewing child images, but those he saw were not pornographic. He does not know where
the polygraph examiner got the statement he watched 100 pornography videos of Anime
cartoon characters portraying children. (Tr. 31-38)
Applicant also stated that he does not know where the polygraph examiner got the
statement that he viewed females whose ages were between 14 and 30 years old.  He
was questioned by Department Counsel and made the following statements:
DC: The  next paragraph  related  to  the  Beautiful Girl image  board and
that one  says they  contain images of  females  ranging  from  14  to  30,
is that an  accurate statement?
A: So, Beautiful Girl, I vaguely  remember what Beautiful Girl is but
14 to 30, I don’t know.
DC: So, where did the  14 to 30 come  from?
A: I think she  asked  me  if  I had  ever seen  someone  that I wasn’t sure
of  and  if  I  could  give  an  age  range. I  said  she  was younger,  I don’t
know, I’m sure I gave an age  of  14, that’s what it says here.
DC: And  the  Beautiful Girl image  board, is  it primarily  nude  images,
is that what that is?
A: I would assume so, I don’t know, I’m not 100 percent sure.
DC: The  next sentence  says you  masturbated  to  images of females
as young as 14 years old, is that an  accurate statement?
A: I  think I  had  seen  something  before  where I  wasn’t sure  of the  age
of  and  if I had  to  give  an  age, I gave  the  age of  14. Looking  back on
it, I don’t know just  because  I just  don’t know.
DC: Is it a  fair  statement that if you  estimated  they  were 14  years old,
you  at least at a  minimum  believed  they  could  have  been  as young
as 14 when [you] were masturbating to them?
A: I don’t know.
DC: You  don’t know. I think they  might have  been  as young  as  14,
you don’t know whether you believed they were as young as 14?
A:  I  think   that  more  than   likely   I’m   putting   myself   in  this  situation
where I’m  feeling   bad  about what I’m  doing  and  I’m  going   into  this
just  trying to offer an  answer and I  don’t’ know.
DC: But  help  me  understand,  your interview  from  the  [government],
you’re  talking  to  a  government official and  you  think it’s I’m  not sure
so  I’m  going  to  estimate  that  I viewed  and  masturbated  to  child  porn?
A:  There’s  one   instance   that  I  can   think  of,   of   a   video,  where  I’m
watching  it and  it’s like  somewhere through  it  I don’t  know  how  old
this  person   is.  I  had   my   hands  down   my   pants  or  whatever  and   I
clicked  off  of  it. It’s  not this is something  I  was going  to  find  and  I  don’t
know   the   age.  Because   I  don’t   know   the   age   and   this  person   is
asking  me  how  old do  you  think they  were, I’m  saying, I don’t know
they  could be  anywhere  between  this age  and  I gave  an  age. That
doesn’t mean  that’s what it is, I was trying  to  just produce  and  answer
for  an   occasion   where  I   viewed   something   where  I   wasn’t  100
percent  sure  of what the  age  of the  person  was. I felt like  I  had  to
give an answer. (Tr. 38-40)
Applicant also testified that he has no idea how the polygraph examiner came up
with the statement that less than 30 times he masturbated to images of females younger
than  14.  When  Applicant  was  asked  by  Department  Counsel  if  he  told  the  polygraph
examiner that he had masturbated to images of females under the age of 18, he testified
he did not know what he told the polygraph examiner. He repeated his admission of the
incident noted above that he masturbated while watching a video of a female who had a
young face. He then said he had no indication of her age and then clicked off the video. I
did not find Applicant’s testimony credible. (Tr. 40-43, 58-60)
In  Applicant’s statement to  the  government investigator in May  2019, he  stated  he
did not  watch  any  videos that  included  child  pornography. He  was questioned  about  his
statement  to   the   polygraph   examiner  where   he   reported   he   had   watched   videos  of
females ages 14-18. He testified that he never intentionally or actively searched  for child
pornography. He testified  if  child  pornography accidentally  appeared  he  would click it  off.
I did  not find  Applicant’s testimony  credible. I find  that he  deliberately  provided  false facts
to   a   government  investigator  during   his  May   2019   background   interview   by   stating   he
never searched  for  or viewed  child  pornography  and  only  inadvertently  came  across  child
pornography  on  two  or  three  occasions  while  searching  mainstream  pornography
websites. (GE 2)
Applicant testified that he no longer watches pornography. He testified that he last
viewed  pornography  in  the  summer  of  2018.  He  told  the  polygraph  examiner  that  he
stopped  viewing  pornography  when  he  received  a  conditional  letter  of  employment  in
2014. He testified that he was trying to stop watching pornography in 2012. He testified
that from 2012 to 2018, he decreased his pornography viewing habits. He said that he
wanted to clarify and give a more accurate depiction of his pornographic viewing habits.
He  said  that  he  has  made  significant  lifestyle  changes  and  pulled  away  from  viewing
pornography. (Tr. 52-54)
Applicant  testified  that  he  believes  his  summary  of  interview  by  the  polygraph
examiner  was  misinterpreted.  He  was  under  a  lot  of  stress  when  he  was  being
interviewed.
Applicant  testified  that  he  would  not  want  anyone  to  find  out  about  his  past
addiction to pornography and allegations of viewing child pornography. No one but his
wife is aware of his past. He believes if others were aware it could harm his personal and
professional relationships. (Tr. 61-62)

"In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted all of the SOR allegations. (HE 3) He
also provided clarifying, extenuating, and mitigating information. (HE 3)
Applicant is a 40-year-old functional information technology system administrator
who has been employed by a DOD contractor since January 2019. (Tr. 5, 8, 28) In 2000,
he graduated from high school. (Tr. 5) He has about 50 college credits, and he has not
received  a  degree.  (Tr.  5)  He  is  studying  for some  technical  certifications.  (Tr. 28)  He
served in the Air Force from 2000 to 2018, and he received a general discharge under
honorable conditions. (Tr. 6) When he left active duty he was a technical sergeant (E-6).
(Tr. 26-27) He served in Iraq for four months in 2010. (Tr. 6) He received an Air Force
Achievement Medal for his service in Iraq. (Tr. 6) He was married from November 2005
to August 2006, and his second marriage was in 2006. (Tr. 7) He has a 10-year-old child
with his current spouse. (Tr. 7; 26-27; GE 1)
In December 2016, Applicant held a security clearance. (Tr. 67) He currently does
not hold a security clearance; however, his security manager has authorized him to have
access to the Non-classified Internet Protocol (IP) Router Network (NIPR Net). (Tr. 23)
His employer has advised him that even if his security clearance is not approved they will
attempt to retain him as an employee. (Tr. 28)
Criminal Conduct,  Sexual Behavior, and Personal Conduct
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges under Guideline D that Applicant used his cell phone to send
nude pictures of his genitalia and engaged in electronic conversations of a sexual nature
with a female he believed to be 14 years old. (Tr. 29)
SOR  ¶  2.a  alleges  under  Guideline  E  that  Applicant  was  administratively
discharged from the Air Force in March 2018 for sexual perversions.
SOR  ¶  3.a  alleges  under  Guideline  J  that  Applicant  received  nonjudicial
punishment  (NJP)  in  about  July 2017  under Article  80  of  the  Uniform  Code  of  Military
Justice (UCMJ) for attempting to commit a lewd act upon a child by intentionally exposing
his genitalia via communication technology to a person he believed to be  14 years old,
but had not attained the age of 16 years. SOR ¶ 3.b cross alleges the conduct set forth
in SOR ¶ 1.a.
In 2016, Applicant was depressed after returning to the United States from Korea,
and he was having problems in his marriage. (Tr. 30; GE 3 at 3) On about 10 occasions
over a three to four-month period, he surfed the Internet with his cell phone looking for
dating opportunities and because of curiosity. (Tr. 31, 32-33)
On   or  about   December  14,   2016,   Applicant   located   and   responded   to   an
advertisement about dating  and  sexual encounters. (Tr. 29-30) He  was 34  years old in
December 2016. (Tr.  37)  After about  10  emails back and  forth  over several hours, the
person  (Ms. C)  advised  Applicant that she  was 14  years old.  (Tr. 36)  Applicant said he
“replied, no, you’re not.  [H]e  just  didn’t believe” Ms. C. (Tr. 36) He  wanted  proof  of  Ms.
C’s age, and  he  engaged  in commentary  back and  forth  with  Ms. C about her  age. (Tr.
36) Eventually, he  came  to  believe  Ms. C  was actually  14  years old.  (Tr. 44)   He never
communicated  with  Ms. C  over the  telephone.  (Tr.  36)  He knew  sexual communications
with  an  underage  person  was illegal. (Tr.  37)  He expressed  concern  to  Ms.  C  about  being
discovered. (Tr. 38) Despite  this concern, he communicated about sexual matters to  Ms.
C, a  female  he  believed  to  be  14  years old,  because  of  his fantasy. (Tr. 38;  GE  6)  He
could  not or would not  disclose  details  about  the  fantasy  at  his  hearing. (Tr. 38-39, 66)
He  never  disclosed   details  about  the   fantasy   to   anyone;  however,   he   denied   that  his
fantasy was to engage in sexual relations with a  14-year-old girl. (Tr. 38)
Applicant  requested  that  Ms.  C  send  him  nude  pictures  of  herself  including  her
genitalia. (Tr. 40, 44) Ms. C did not send him any pictures; however, he sent her three
pictures of himself: one of his face, and two of his genitalia. (Tr. 40-41) He was unsure
whether she asked for the pictures. (Tr. 64) He sent one picture of his genitalia after he
learned  Ms.  C was  14  years old.  (Tr. 41) In emails,  he  offered  to  teach  Ms.  C how to
perform various explicit sexual acts. (Tr. 43; GE 6) He provided Ms. C with information
about websites for the purpose of having her view pornographic videos. (Tr. 44; GE 6) He
denied that he suggested that Ms. C go to any Internet sites containing child pornography.
(Tr.  63-64)  He  also  offered  to  perform  sex  acts  on  Ms.  C,  and  he  requested  that  she
perform sex acts on him. (Tr. 43; GE 6) He said exceptionally gross things to Ms. C about
what he wanted to do with his bodily fluids. (GE 5; GE 6) Applicant asked Ms. C to meet
him during the day where they could be alone because he was worried about being caught
by law enforcement. (Tr. 43; GE 6)
On December 29, 2016, an Air Force investigator interviewed Applicant about his
communications  with  Ms.  C,  and  he  admitted  the  allegations.  (Tr.  46,  61;  GE  6)  The
investigators  examined  his  computer  and  cell  phone  for  evidence.  (Tr.  53,  64)  The
investigators retained his cell phone, and there has not been any allegation that Applicant
viewed child pornography. (Tr. 64)
Applicant said he did not propose a place to meet with Ms. C, and he insisted that
he was not really going to engage in sex with her. (Tr. 65) He said:
Because   I  wasn't  going   to   do   anything   like   that.  Honestly,  I  thought
somebody  was  messing  with  me  at  that  time. So,  I didn’t  want,  for  one, I
couldn’t  do  that. That’s  sick, twisted,  and  I  don’t even  know  why  I went  as
far as I did.  But to  actually  go  and  meet somebody  and  do  something  like
that,  no, I can’t do that.  (Tr. 62-63)
In about July 2017, Applicant received NJP under Article 80, UCMJ, for attempting
to  commit  a  lewd  act  upon  a  child  by  intentionally  exposing  his  genitalia  via
communication  technology  to  a  person  he  believed  to  be  14  years  old,  but  had  not
attained the age of 16 years. (Tr. 56-58; GE 5 at 4) He admitted the conduct and offense
alleged  in  the  NJP.  (Tr.  58)  The  commander  imposed  a  reduction  in  grade  to  staff
sergeant (E-5), forfeiture of one half of one month’s pay for two months, and a reprimand.
(Tr. 58; GE 5) The commander who imposed the NJP recommended that Applicant be
allowed to remain in the Air Force; however, the next commander wanted to discharge
him. (Tr. 59) In March 2018, the Air Force administratively discharged him from the Air
Force for misconduct, specifically sexual perversions. (Tr. 52, 60) The conduct that was
the basis of the discharge is detailed above. (Tr. 53)
Applicant  disclosed  the  conduct  described  above  to  his  spouse,  in-laws,  and
employer.  (Tr.  53-55)  Applicant  received  counseling  from  a  therapist  with  experience
counseling  and  treating  pedophiles.  (Tr.  47)  He  was  unsure  about  her  credentials;
however, he believed she was a mental-health professional and possibly a social worker,
psychologist,  or  psychiatrist.  (Tr.  47)  She  advised  Applicant  that  he  did  not  meet  the
criteria for pedophilia. (Tr. 47-48) She did not provide a letter indicating her diagnosis or
prognosis.
Applicant  also   received   counseling   for  depression,   anxiety,   and   ADHD  issues
through  the  Department of  Veterans Affairs. (Tr. 26)  He received  Wellbutrin  for a  month
or two  to  treat  his depression; however, he  did not like  the  side  effects and  he  stopped
taking  it. (Tr.  49-50) Applicant  and  his spouse  participated  in marital counseling. (Tr. 48,
50) He attended  a  five-day  counseling  and  education  session  with  his spouse. (Tr. 26,
50)  He believed  the  marital counseling  was helpful and  effective. (Tr. 50) He also received
financial counseling. (Tr. 51)
Applicant said:
I am  incredibly  sorry  for my  actions during  that time. I’ve  gotten  deep  within
my  church.  Right now  I’m  one  of  the  youth  leaders. My  wife  and  I,  we  do

Character Evidence
Applicant  provided  statements  from  nine  character  witnesses,  including  his
mother-in-law, father-in-law, supervisor, pastor, friends, and coworkers, one of whom also

including  dating  applications,
Applicant  uses  social  media,
to
communicate with foreign nationals. In about January 2019, a stranger located in what
Applicant  believes  was  the  Philippines  (the  Scammer)  posed  as  a  female  online,  and
coerced Applicant into exposing himself over a video call. The Scammer video recorded
the  Skype  video  call.  The  Scammer  then  determined  Applicant’s  identity  through
Applicant’s  social  media  presence,  and  threatened  to  send  a  snapshot  of  the
compromising video to Applicant’s friends, co-workers, and family unless Applicant paid
him  money.  Applicant  panicked,  and  over  the  next  two  days,  sent  the  Scammer  two
electronic  wire  transfers  totaling  $1,000.  When  the  Scammer  refused  to  destroy  the
compromising  data  unless  Applicant  sent  him  even  more  money,  Applicant  refused  to
send  additional  funds  and  blocked  the  Scammer  from  communicating  with  him.
Applicant  also  made  his  profile  and  friends  lists  on  social  media  private.  In  February
2019,  Applicant  self-reported  this  extortion  to  his  security  officer  at  his  place  of
employment. Applicant’s employer created an incident report, but took no further  action
against  Applicant  related  to  this  incident.  Applicant’s  family,  his  roommate,  and  his
employer  are  aware  of  this  incident.  Applicant  claims  that  he  has  learned  a  valuable
lesson from being extorted online and claims that he takes more precaution with whom
he decides to correspond when he uses dating websites. He also claims that he has not
been the subject of additional instances of online scams or extortion. (Items 1, 2, 4, 5)

site. Applicant believes Ms. B was in the United States on a work visa, and was working
for a theme park. They went on two dates together and then only communicated online
after those two dates. Applicant believes that Ms.  B moved back to China in February
2017. Applicant has not communicated with Ms. B since February 2017. (Items 1-4)
In June 2017, Applicant met a Chinese national, Ms. C, on an online dating site.
Ms. C was temporarily in the United States working at a theme park. Applicant and Ms.
C  dated,  communicating  in-person  and  online  from  June  2017  until  September  2018,
when  Ms.  C  moved  back  to  China.  Once  Ms.  C  moved  back  to  China,  they  only
communicated  online  until  they  ended  their  relationship  later  in  September  2018
because of  the difficulty of  a long distance relationship.  Applicant broke up with Ms. C
over e-mail and received a response from Ms. C that he has not read. Applicant claimed
he  did  not  read  the  letter  from  Ms.  C  to  avoid  getting  back  together  with  her,  but
admitted that he still has this e-mail and may read it in the future. (Items 1-4)
In January 2017, Applicant met a Chinese national, Ms. D, on a social media site.
They  met  in  person  for  three  consecutive  days  and  then  only  communicated  online
afterwards. Their last communication was online in October 2017 when Ms. D asked for
Applicant’s  Netflix   account   information   so   that  she   could  watch   online   programming.
While  it   is  not  clear   whether  Applicant   provided   Ms.  D  with   his  Netflix   account
information,   it   can   be   reasonably   deduced   that   he   did  because   he   indicated   that  he
looked  to  see  if  there  was evidence  of Ms. D  using  his Netflix  account,  but he  could  not
find  any. It  is logical that he  would have  only  suspected  that she  would use  his  Netflix
account information if he provided it to her. (Items 1-4)

United States working at a theme park. Applicant and Ms. G dated, communicating in-
person  and  online.  Applicant  and  Ms.  G  maintained  a  romantic  relationship  until  early
2020  when  they  stopped  dating,  but  maintained  a  platonic  relationship.  The  latest
evidence  provided  that  Applicant  and  Ms.  G  communicate  electronically  “nearly  daily.”

In April 2019, Applicant met a Japanese national, Ms. H on an online dating site.
He developed a platonic online friendship with Ms. H and maintains contact via text and

Tokyo. (Items 1, 2, 4)
Applicant  does  not  believe  that  any  of  the  foreign  nationals  with  whom  he  has

feel  vulnerable  to  coercion  or  duress  to  divulge  secured  or  protected  information  as  a
result of his aforementioned foreign contacts. He claims that he could not be coerced or
blackmailed into acting against the interests of the United States and that none of these
foreign contacts are aware that he has access to secured information as he has never
discussed  the  topic  with  them.  He  claims  that  he  has  not  developed  a  preference  for
any foreign country or foreign individuals but that he has simply developed a romantic
preference for women of Asian descent. With the exception of his romantic and platonic
relationships  with  the  aforementioned  women,  there  is  no  record  evidence  that

1.a.,  2.a.  and  3.b.  Applicant  admits  that  he  was  arrested  in  July  of  2016,  and
subsequently pled guilty to the misdemeanor offense of Indecent Exposure. As part of his
sentence, he was required to register as a sex offender. (Item 5.)
2.a. It  is alleged  that Applicant failed  to  register as a  sex offender.  As noted by
Department Counsel in the FORM, this is incorrect as Applicant did so register. (FORM
at page 2.) Applicant registered in June of 2017, and re-registered in April of 2020 due to
an “Address Change.” (Answer at pages 3~9.)
",True
"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations under Guidelines
J and D, with exculpatory explanations. He did not expressly admit or deny the Guideline
E allegations, which cross-allege the allegations under Guidelines J and D.  His limited
admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact and discussed in more detail below.
Applicant  is  a  39-year-old  business  systems  analyst  employed  by  defense
contractors since December 2017. He was terminated by another defense contractor in
May  2019  for  using  a  government  computer  for  personal  email  and  was  briefly
unemployed. (Tr. 111-12.) He worked for other defense contractors from June 2019 until
he was hired by his current employer in April 2020. He received a security clearance in
August 2019. (Tr. 120-21.)
Applicant was born in a foreign country. He immigrated to the United States with
his mother and two sisters in 1991, and his father stayed behind in their native country.
Applicant became a U.S. citizen in 2014. (Tr. 22.) He graduated from high school in 2001,
attended college for one semester, and then enlisted in the  U.S. Navy. (Tr. 23-24.) He
served on active duty in the Navy from January 2002 to December 2017 and received a
general discharge under honorable conditions. While on active duty, he received the Navy
and Marine Corps Achievement Medal five times, the Good Conduct Medal three times,
and  multiple  service  ribbons  and  qualification  badges.  (AX  E.)  He  received  a  security
clearance in about 2012. (Tr. 30.) He has a 90% disability for multiple stress injuries to
his limbs, feet, and back, as well as depression and anxiety. (Tr. 34-35.)
Applicant married in February 2015, separated in December 2018, and divorced
in  March  2020.  He  has  a  16-year-old  daughter  from  a  previous  relationship  and  two
children with his ex-wife, ages eight and six. (Tr. 26.)
In 2008, Applicant was charged with felony kidnapping and assault. In his answer
to the SOR, he admitted he was charged, but he denied that he was guilty. He testified
that he was in a relationship with an older woman and the relationship became toxic when
she started having conversations with an ex-boyfriend. During an argument, he attempted
to leave their residence, but she blocked the door. She hit him, scratched him, and spat
at him. He grabbed her by both arms and pinned her down on the bed. After he released
her and started to leave, she called the police. Applicant waited in his car for the police to
arrive, believing that she would be arrested. (Tr. 55-59.) Court records reflect that he was
found  not  guilty  of  felony  kidnapping.  Disposition  was  deferred  on  the  assault  charge,
conditioned  on  him  having  no  contact  with  the  woman  for  one  year.  After  a  year  had
passed, the assault charge was dismissed. (GX 4 at 1-2.)
In 2010, Applicant was charged with destruction of property. In his answer to the
SOR,  he  stated  that  his  cohabitant  was  upset  about  his  long  working  hours  and  she
changed the lock on the door of their residence while he was at work. He came home
from work at about 3:00 or 4:00 a.m. and found that his cohabitant had changed the door
lock. He called the police and showed the police officer a bank statement reflecting that
he lived there. According to Applicant, the police officer advised him that he was entitled
to break in and recover his belongings but that he might be responsible for repairing the
door. He broke in, retrieved some clothing and personal affects, put them in his car, and
left. (Tr. 61-64.) He was charged with intentional damage to property. He was convicted
and  sentenced  to  30  days  in  jail  (suspended)  and  unsupervised  probation.  He  was
required to pay restitution to repair the door. (GX 4 at 2.) In his answer to the SOR and at
the hearing, he stated that the judge told him  to take his legal advice from an attorney
and not from a police officer. (Tr. 65.)
In 2012, Applicant, then a petty officer first class,  was accused of  sodomizing a
female shipmate, a petty officer second class, without her consent. He admitted having
anal intercourse  with  the female  sailor,  but he maintained  that  it was  consensual. The
female  sailor  recanted  her  initial  complaint  and  stated  that  they  initially  engaged  in
consensual anal intercourse, but that she changed her mind and tried to move away but
did not tell Applicant to stop. Investigators concluded that the female sailor’s accusation
was unfounded. Applicant’s commander imposed nonjudicial punishment on both parties
for violating an order prohibiting sexual activity between sailors on the ship. Applicant’s
punishment  was  a  reduction  from  petty  officer  first  class  to  petty  officer  second  class,
restriction  for  45  days,  45  days  of  extra  duty,  and  forfeiture  of  one  half  of  his  pay  per
month for two months. The female sailor’s punishment was forfeiture of one half of her
pay for two months, and her recommendation for advancement was withdrawn. (GX 2 at
1-2.)
At  some  time  not  reflected  in  the  record,  Applicant  was  promoted back  to  petty
officer first class. In July 2016, while Applicant was still married, he  was accused by a
female sailor, a petty officer second class, of sexual harassment by “play fighting” with
her, placing his hands around her neck and shaking her, and putting his hand on her thigh
while they were riding in a military vehicle. Applicant testified that he and the female sailor
worked  together and became friendly.  According  to  Applicant,  their  friendship  became
flirtatious and “semi-sexual,” to the point where she sent him “racy” photos of herself. He
denied asking the female sailor to have sex with him. (Tr.  36-40.) He believes that the
female sailor made a report of sexual harassment in order to obtain a reassignment. (Tr.
42.)  However,  he  admitted  at  the  hearing  that,  even  if  there  had  been  no  sexual
harassment,  his relationship  with  the female  sailor was  inappropriate.  (Tr. 46.)  In April
2017, he received nonjudicial punishment for sexual harassment. He was reduced from
petty  officer  first  class  to  petty  officer  second  class  and  processed  for  administrative
separation.  (GX  2  at  3-4.)  In  December  2017,  he  received  a  general  discharge  under
honorable conditions. (AX E.)
Applicant and his wife separated in December 2018 and divorced in March 2020.
Applicant testified that after the divorce, his ex-wife would taunt him by calling him while
she  was  having  sex  with  her  boyfriend,  sending  him  photos  of  her  and  her  boyfriend
having sex, and threatening him with violence. She told their son that he would never see
his father again because she intended to make sure that he would go to jail. (Tr. 70-71.)
Applicant’s divorce attorney described his ex-wife as “one of the most spiteful, vindictive
and  caustic personalities I’ve  come across in 19 years of representing clients in family
law issues.” (AX I.)
After Applicant and his wife separated, she moved out of the family home, but she
left  clothing and other possessions  in the home.  In early March  2019, after  repeatedly
asking  her  to  remove  her  belongings,  Applicant  decided  to  come  up  with  the  most
hyperbolic statement he could think of to get her attention, and he  told his wife that he
would  burn  her  possessions  if  she  did  not  remove  them  from  the  home.  (Tr.  72.)  She
responded  to  the  threat  by  obtaining  a  protective  order  on  March  7,  2019,  with  an
expiration date of March 11, 2019. (GX 3 at 7-8.)
On  March  10, 2019, Applicant’s  wife  accused  Applicant  of threatening  to  kill  her
sister and  injure her  son,  and  Applicant was charged  with  violating  the  protective  order
and  using  profane  and  threatening  language. (GX  3  at 9.) Applicant denied  making  threats
or using  profane  and  threatening  language. (Tr. 80.)  He  testified  that when  his  son  was
three  or four years old, he  was afraid  of  many  things, and  Applicant  encouraged  him  to
confront his fear.  Applicant testified  that he  would ask his son,  “Why  are you  scared  of
this? You  want daddy  to  beat it up?” During  a  video  telephone  call, his son  said that he
was afraid  of  “auntie” and  his mother’s older son’ Appellant’s wife  heard the  conversation
and  interpreted  it  to mean  that  Applicant  offered  to beat up  “auntie” and  her son.  (Tr.  81-
82.)
Applicant’s  wife  obtained  another  protective  order  on  May  1,  2019,  prohibiting
“hostile  contact”  with  his  wife  and  prohibiting  all  contact  with  her  son.  On  May  10,
Applicant was charged with violating the order. (GX 3 at 10.) The record does not reflect
the  factual  basis  for  this  charge.  On  May  30,  2019,  the  charge  was  dismissed  due  to
insufficient evidence. (GX 3 at 3, 11.) The protective order violation was nolle prosequi
on May 30, 2019. (GX 4 at 2; AX I at 1.)
Another  show  cause  order  was  issued  against  Applicant  in  August  2019  for
violating  protective  orders.  The  evidentiary  basis  for  this  order  appears  to  have  been
Applicant’s  unwelcome  visits  and  messages  regarding  visitation  with  his  son.  When
Applicant learned that he was charged with violating protective orders, he turned himself
in. (Tr. 77-78.) In November 2019, his wife’s attorney requested that the show cause order
be removed from the hearing docket because the parties had resolved the matter. (AX F;
Tr. 157.) The show cause order was dismissed in on November 19, 2019. (GX 3 at 15.)
Applicant and his ex-wife now communicate solely by email. (Tr. 97.)
In  his  post-hearing  submission,  Applicant  submitted  screen  shots  of  Facebook
pages and film clips showing his ex-wife’s boyfriend belittling him, threatening him, and
harassing him when he met with his ex-wife to pick up his son for visitation. (AX L, M, and
N.)  In  September  2020,  the  boyfriend  accused  Applicant  of  assaulting  him.  Applicant
testified that he was in front of a police station waiting to pick up his son from his ex-wife,
when the boyfriend began directing abusive language toward him and attempted to block
him for leaving his car. Applicant had agreed to pick up his son for visitation in front of the
police station instead of  the daycare center  because his ex-wife had suggested it. (Tr.
162.) Applicant was able to get past the boyfriend, and he went into the police station and
filed a complaint against the boyfriend. The police reviewed the camera footage from the
front  of  the  police  station  and  charged  the  boyfriend  with  assault.  The  boyfriend  then
accused Applicant of assault. On March 10, 2021, both parties agreed to withdraw their
complaints, and the charge against Applicant was dismissed. (AX H; Tr. 91-95.)
When Applicant filed his complaint against his ex-wife’s boyfriend, he discovered
that his ex-wife had filed a complaint in another jurisdiction, alleging violation of the May
2019  order prohibiting “hostile contact.” At the  hearing, Applicant admitted  violating the
order when he responded to hostile emails and messages by calling her “a lot of choice
words.”  He  was  charged  with  using  profane  and  threatening  language.  The  trial  was
delayed by COVID-19. In September 2021, he pleaded “no contest” and was sentenced
to one day in jail. (Tr. 88-89.)
Applicant sought and received therapy from about June 2019 to January 2020. He
testified that he realizes that he was bitter because he wanted to keep the family together
but his ex-wife refused to do her part. (Tr. 155.) He now attends church regularly and has
a good relationship with his pastor. (Tr. 99.) He also has increased his contact with his
parents,  nieces,  nephews,  and  sister  for  guidance  and  support.  He  has  established
contact  with  his father,  who  remained  in  Applicant’s  country  of  birth, and  has  received
helpful guidance about dealing with his personal problems. (Tr. 98-103.) He testified that
he has learned that his ex-wife “knows exactly how to push my buttons.” (Tr. 184.) In his
group therapy sessions, he has learned from people having similar issues and hearing
how they deal with them. He knows that if he gets upset, he has enough support from his
family, his church, and his therapists to help him deal with it. (Tr. 188.)
A former shipmate who has known Applicant for more than 17 years respects him
as a former mentor and a trustworthy friend. (AX D at 4.) Applicant’s immediate supervisor
for the past four years describes him as energetic, hard-working, reliable, honest, mature,
and patient. (AX D at 1.) Another supervisor, a retired Navy commander, describes him
as thoughtful, kind, poised, reliable, and mature. (AX D at 2.) Applicant recently received
an “impact” financial award for performing “above and beyond what is expected.” (AX C.)

to 16 counts. In August 1989, Applicant, represented by counsel, pled guilty to 1 felony
count (count #15, as amended) for which he was convicted. The other 15 counts were
dismissed. The following is the count to which he pled guilty:

On  and  between  August  1,  1988  and  August  30,  1988  [Applicant]  did

On  his  SCA,  Applicant  reported  that  he  pled  guilty,  in  about  August  1989,  to  a
felony child sex offense involving a girl under the age of 14; and that he was incarcerated
from  about  August  1989  through  September 1992.  In  connection  with  the  background
investigation prompted by his SCA, he was interviewed three times: twice in November
2018 and once in August 2019. He  discussed matters relevant to the SOR allegations
during the first interview in November 2018 (Interview 1) and the August 2019 interview
(Interview 3), including his version of the facts and circumstances underlying his arrest
and conviction. (Items 3, 4)
Initially during Interview 1, Applicant explained that the child sex offense for which
he was arrested involved him showering with the daughter of his wife’s friend, who was
then only 13 years old (minor child). He claimed that he did not do anything else with the
minor child. When asked to provide further information about the incident, he refused to
do so on the basis that all he did was shower and could not remember all of the details
since it occurred so long ago. (Item 4 at 9)
Subsequently  during  Interview  1, Applicant provided  some  additional details. He
maintained  that his wife’s friend  saw  him  showering  with  the  minor child  and  called  the
police, which resulted  in  his arrest.  He  explained  that  his wife’s friend  and  the  minor child
were living  with  him  at  the  time. He  believed  that  he  was rightfully  arrested  and  should
not have  been  showering  with  someone  that young. He  asserted  that  he  was not thinking
at the  time  and  afterwards realized  it was a  mistake. He did  not know  why  he  thought it
was okay to  do  it at the  time. He  stated  that,  after pleading  guilty   to  the   one  child  sex
offense, he  was sentenced  to  three  years in prison, which he  served  from  August  1989
to  September  1992.  He  confirmed that he  was registered as a  sex  offender, as required.
He asserted  that it  was a  one-time  offense  and  that  he  had  not had  any  other  negative
interactions with  law  enforcement or engaged  in  any  other  criminal  activity.  (Item  4  at  9-
10)
During Interview 3,  Applicant  claimed that  his  wife  (who  had then been  living in
another country with their children) asked him to allow her friend to live with him so that
her friend could escape an abusive husband. He stated that he took his wife’s friend and
her two children (including the minor child and her son) in like family. (Item 4 at 11-12)
Court  records  reflect  that  the  results  of  the  prosecution’s  investigation  largely
contradicted the Applicant’s version of events. The prosecution’s investigation found that
Applicant engaged in substantially more unlawful sexual activity with the minor child than
the one for which he was convicted, and that those acts occurred over an extended period
of  time.  Among  the  court  records  was  a  pleading  containing  a  statement  of  facts,
endorsed by Applicant’s counsel, that acknowledged that Applicant was the boyfriend of
the  minor  child’s  mother,  and  that  the  minor  child  and  her  mother  referred  to  him  as
“father.” (Item 6 at 6-12, 14-24, 47-53, 75-76, 86-87, 109-119)
Another court record revealed that Applicant’s wife and four children (including two
daughters, then ages 12 and 14) arrived in the United States in about July 1989. At that
time, Applicant’s bail conditions were temporarily modified to prohibit him from residing in
the same home as his wife and children, and to require that any visitation with his children
be supervised by a court-approved agency. During Interview 1, Applicant confirmed that
he did not get to see his children for a long period of time. The record did not otherwise
indicate the specific duration for which his residence and visitation with his children were
restricted. The record also did not indicate whether any restrictions or obligations followed
his  release  from  prison,  including  any  period  of  probation  (besides  requiring  him  to
register as a sex offender). (Item 6 at 66, 69, 76)
In  Applicant’s  Answer,  he  admitted  the  facts  alleged  under  Guidelines  H  and  J
involving his arrest and conviction. In response to the Guideline E allegation (SOR ¶ 3.a)
involving falsification of facts during Interview 1, he wrote “I admit.” However, I construed
his  response  as  a  denial  because,  in  the  explanation  accompanying  his  response,  he
denied any deliberate intent due, in part, to English being his second language. He also
claimed that he did his best to answer all questions during his background investigation
interviews, while also stating that he “did not give them the detail of that [sic].”

"Applicant  is  44  years  old.  He  is  married  with  five  children.  He  has  a  Master’s
degree in Electrical Engineering.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Design
and  Analysis  Engineer  IV.  He  is  seeking  to  retain  a  security  clearance  in  connection
with his employment.
Guideline D –  Sexual Behavior
Guideline M –  Use of Information Technology
Guideline E  –  Personal Conduct
The  SOR  alleged  that  Applicant  for  many  years,  between  2003  and  2014,
engaged in sexual misconduct in the workplace, the misuse of information technology,
and poor personal conduct.  Applicant admits in part and denies in part the allegations
set forth in the SOR.  (See Applicant’s Answer to the SOR.)
Applicant’s first job out of college was working for a defense contractor from 2003
to 2011.  He was  granted a security clearance  in 2003  or 2004.  During this period of
In  2009,  he  underwent  a
employment,  he  engaged  in  many  acts  of  misconduct.
polygraph  examination  and  admitted  that  he  viewed  pornography  on  his  corporate
computer  about  a  dozen  times,  and  he  masturbated  in  his  office  on  three  to  five
occasions.  (Tr.  p.  49.)
In  September  2009,  he  was  required  to  sign  a  Government
policy  statement  confirming  this  misconduct.  From  2011  to  2013,  he  left  his
employment in the defense industry and worked outside of the industry.  (Government
Exhibit 3.)
In  2013,  Applicant  re-entered  the  defense  industry,  and  started  working  for  his
current employer.  He was granted a special access clearance in late 2014.  In 2014, he
again  underwent  a  polygraph  examination.  During  this  polygraph  examination,
Applicant admitted that he had relapsed in viewing pornography at work, which occurred
about ten times.  (Tr. p. 51.)  This  time, however,  he  was  viewing pornography  on  his
cell phone  while  at  work.  This misconduct occurred  about every three months  or so.
He also admitted to misusing his corporate computer in many ways.  He loading a non-
work related compact disc into it between 2003 and 2007; he had used a personal USB
drive to transfer proprietary text files and powerpoint presentations from 2008 to 2011;
he  had  used  a  personal  USB  drive  to  transfer  proprietary  information  between
November 2013 to March 2014; and, he had used his corporate computer to charge his
cell phone one to two times per week from October 2013 to May 2014.  Applicant stated
that  he  deliberately  withheld  information  about  his  use  of  personal  USB  drives  in  his
corporate computer during his earlier investigation in 2008.  (Government Exhibit 3.)
1.a.     Applicant,   on   multiple   occasions   between   2005   until  at  least  2014,   used   the
corporate   computer  to   view   pornography   at  work.     This  conduct   was  in  violation   of
company   and   DoD  policies  and   regulations,  as  well   as  United   States  Intelligence
Community   policy.     Applicant   testified   that   in  2005,   he   was  working   full   time   for  a
defense  contractor,  and  working  on  his Master’s degree.  He was twenty-five  years old,
newly   married,   with   a   young   family.    He  was  balancing   lots   of  demands,   and   was
stressed.    He  found   that  the   only   privacy  he   had   was  at  the   office,   and   he   started   to
view  pornography  at work on  the  corporate  computer.   This misconduct continued  until
at least 2014.   He  explained  that  he  would usually  work more than  the  standard  40-hour
work week, and  after hours or on  a  break he  would view  pornography.  He  stated  that
he never did  it  where anyone  could  see  him.   He  stated  that he  has  not engaged  in this
misconduct since  2014.   He  knew  this misconduct to  be  prohibited, but chose  to  engage
in it anyway.
1.b.   Applicant,  on  multiple occasions  from  2005  until at least  2008, masturbated  in his
office  while   at  work.    He   believes  this  occurred   between   two   to   four  or  five   separate
occasions.     He   testified   that  he   realized   that  this  behavior  was   not  in  line   with   his
religious beliefs and  wanting  to  be  honest with  his wife  and  his church leaders,  and  so
he  started  seeing  a  counselor for this behavior.   He  stated  that he  has not engaged  in
this misconduct  since  2008.   Applicant knew  this misconduct  to  be  prohibited,  but chose
to engage in it anyway.
2.a.  See  Applicant’s misconduct  discussion  above under  1.a.
2.b.   Applicant,  on  multiple  occasions from  2008  to  at  least  2014,  transferred   personal
files  without  authorization   between   his  corporate   computer  and   his  personal  home
computer using  his personal thumb  drives.    He stated  that he   has  not engaged  in this
misconduct   since   2014.       He   knew   this  misconduct  to   be   prohibited,   but  chose   to
engage in it anyway.
2.c.     Applicant,   on   multiple   occasions  from   about  2003   to   2007,  loaded   unauthorized
software  onto   his   corporate   computer.    He  testified   that   he   would  load   a music CD   on
his corporate  computer.  He also used  the  charger on  his corporate  computer to  charge
his  personal   cell   phone.    He  stated   that  he   has  not   engaged   in   this  misconduct   since
2007.  He  knew this misconduct to be prohibited, but chose to engage in it anyway.
3.a.    In   February   2015,  the   Government   revoked   Applicant’s   existing   access  to
classified  Information  and  disapproved  any  additional access  for violation  of Intelligence
Community   Policy   guidance   704.2.     In   September  2009,  Applicant  signed   a   US
Government  policy   statement  wherein   it  noted   that  his  viewing   of  pornography   on   his
corporate  computer,  and  his masturbating  in the  office, which occurred  between  2005  to
2008   were  noted   misconduct  under   personal   conduct   and   misuse   of  information
technology   systems.    He   understood   at  that  time   that  his  misconduct  was  against
company  and  Government policies.   In  2014, during  polygraph testing  of  the  Applicant,
he  stated   that  he   did   not  take   the   signed   policy   statement  seriously.    He  believed   his
misconduct was okay  because  he  was not  using  his corporate  computer.  At that time,
he stated  that he  attended  Sexaholics Anonymous due  to  his addiction  to  pornography.
He   estimated   that  he   has  occasion   to   relapse   into   the   sexual  addiction   approximately
every   three   months  where  he   views  pornography   on   his  cell   phone   while   at  work.
(Government Exhibit 3.)
3.b.  See  Applicant’s misconduct discussed  above in  paragraph 1.
3.c.   See  Applicant’s misconduct discussed  above in  paragraph 2.
Two  polygraph  examinations  of  the  Applicant,  the first  conducted by a  previous
employer in 2008, and the second conducted in 2014, by his current employer, revealed
that for many years, while employed in the defense industry, Applicant has engaged in
sexual misconduct in the workplace.  He has also misused information technology, and
engaged in poor personal conduct.  These actions were in violation of DoD policies and
procedures.
Applicant  testified  that  he  has  received  regular  security  briefings  from  his
employers  since  beginning  his  employment  in  the  defense  industry.  (Tr.  p.  76.)  He
stated that when he started working for the defense industry he was young and ignorant
and  just  learning  the  rules  and  regulations.  He  believes  that  he  now  has  a  firm
understanding of  the company policy and procedures.  He believes he has  grown and
matured since  he committed these violations, as it has been nearly ten  years.  This is
not entirely accurate.  Applicant engaged in misconduct as a young man in his twenties,
and  this  misconduct  continued,  with  pattern  of  relapse,  well  into  his  late  thirties.  He
underwent his first polygraph examination in 2008, and was made aware of misconduct,
when he signed a U.S. Government policy statement in September 2009.  His relapses
were noted in 2014, and his Special Access was revoked in February 2015.
Applicant testified that although he would like to work in the defense industry for
a contractor, he does not need a security clearance in order to be employable.  He has
chosen to confront these issues in his past and would like to work for the Government,
but there are many companies outside of the Department of Defense that could use his
skills  without  the  need  for  a  security  clearance.
In  fact,  that  is  what  he  was  doing
between 2011 and 2013, working in other fields outside of the Government.
Excerpts from  Applicant’s employment records reflect that he  has been  a  major
contributor to the company.  Documents reflecting his  job performance show that he has
either “met expectations”, “exceeded”,  or “far exceeded”   his job  requirements.   He has
also  been   eligible   for  the   retention   bonus   program.    (Applicant’s   Exhibit  B.)   Applicant
testified   that  since   2013,  his  performance   evaluations  have   been   excellent.     He   has
received  ratings of either “exceeds expectations” or “greatly  exceeds expectations.”  (Tr.
p. 20.)   He stated that he gets along well  with his co-workers and  management.
Letters of recommendation from various individuals who know the Applicant well,
who  include  friends,  church  members,  his  wife,  and  his  counselor,  attest  to  his
character,  patriotism  and  ability  to  protect  classified  information.  They  collectively
indicate   that  Applicant   is  trustworthy,  responsible   and   has  good   judgment.     They   all
recommend that he be granted  a security clearance.    (Applicant’s Exhibit C.)
A  letter  from  his  counselor  confirmed  that  Applicant  attended  sessions  twice  a
month  at  first  and  then  later  on  a  monthly  basis.  The  sessions  involved  therapy  in
dealing with stress management techniques and how to avoid his addiction.  In addition
how  to  be  accountable  to  his  wife,  church  community  and  others.  He  believes  that
Applicant is committed to ensuring that his sexual misconduct does not continue.
Applicant  is  a  very  involved  father  who  coaches  his  children’s  basketball,
baseball, and soccer teams.  He attends talent shows and other events to support his

leadership, including a Seminary Teacher and Bishop of his Ward.  (Tr. pp. 22-24.)

"In Applicant’s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in ¶¶ 1.a, 1.e to
1.k, and 3.a. (HE 3) He did not admit or deny some SOR allegations, and he denied some
allegations. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact.
Applicant is  a  50-year-old operations  manager  who  has  worked  for the  same  DOD
contractor since  2013.  (Tr. 6, 37-38) In  1990, he  graduated  from  high  school. (Tr. 7, 28)
In  about 2002, he  earned  an  associate’s degree  in aviation  maintenance  technology, and
in 2003, he  was awarded  a  bachelor’s degree  in aviation  aerospace  management.  (Tr. 7,
29)  He has  an  airframe  and  power plant  license  for aviation.  (Tr.  31)  He was on  active
duty  from  November 2019  to  June  2022,  and  in June  2022, he  resumed  working  for his
current employer. (Tr. 39-41)  He had  a  reduction  in  annual  pay  from  about  $98,000  to
about $70,000 while he was on active duty. (Tr. 60-62)
Applicant was married the first time from 1992 to 1997, and the second time from
2003 to 2012. (Tr. 8) His stepson is 22, and his son is 18. (Tr. 8-9, 32-33) He served on
active duty in the Navy from 1992 to 1997, and in the Navy Reserve from 2014 to present.
(Tr.  9)  He  is  a  petty  officer  second  class  (E-5).  (Tr.  9)  His  current  Navy  specialty  is
Yeoman. (Tr. 9) He has 13 years of Navy service. (Tr. 110)
Financial Considerations
SOR  ¶   1.a   alleges   Applicant filed  for discharge   of   liabilities   totaling   $149,105   in
January   2014   under  Chapter  7   of   the   Bankruptcy   Code,  and   the   bankruptcy   judge
discharged  his nonpriority  unsecured  debts in  April 2015. (GE  1  at 35; GE  2  at 9; GE  6  at
1)  The  secured  claims  totaled  $110,935;  the  priority  claims were $850; and  the  unsecured
nonpriority  claims were $37,320. (GE  2  at  9) Around  2012,  Applicant  and  his second  wife
separated, and he was unable to pay the bills without her income. (Tr. 44)  In 2013, his
starting pay was about $24 an hour. (Tr. 42) When he filed for bankruptcy, Applicant was
$24,000 behind on his $107,604 mortgage, and the fair market value of the property was
substantially below the amount of the mortgage. (Tr. 112; GE 2 at 16) The bankruptcy
documentation  indicates  Applicant’s  monthly  income  over  the  previous  six  months
averaged $5,647, and his IRS tax transcript showed his income for Tax Year (TY) 2014
was about $109,000. (Tr. 113) Applicant suggested that perhaps the extra funds on his
TY 2014 tax return came from his military duties, overtime with his contractor employer,
or a cash payout from a previous employer. (Compare Tr. 116 with GE 2 at 49-51) He
understood that his income could not exceed the threshold in the bankruptcy statute, or
he would not qualify for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge of his debts. (Tr. 114-115) He
said he would provide documentation after his hearing to show his income statement on
his bankruptcy was correct. (Tr. 117, 121) He did not provide the evidence showing the
income  on  his  bankruptcy  submission  was  accurate.  His  bankruptcy  documentation
included a $2,576 state tax lien. (Tr. 48)
SOR ¶  1.b  alleges Applicant owes delinquent federal taxes totaling  $6,112 for TY
2014.  (GE 3  at 2, 9)  His September 24, 2020  IRS  tax  transcript for  TY  2014  shows an
account balance  of  $9,177  owed  to  the  IRS, and  it shows IRS  tax  transfers to  address his
TY  2014  tax  debt from  TY  2017  of  $1,143, from  TY  2018  of  $1,037, and  from  TY  2019  of
$647. (GE 4  at 9-10) He also made  a  $143  payment on  March 10,  2020. (Id.) On  February
14,  2020,  Applicant told  an  Office  of Personnel Management  (OPM)  investigator that  he
“arranged  a  payment plan  with  the  IRS,  and  made  on-time  payments until [he] defaulted.”
(GE  10   at  2)  He  did   not  resume   payments.   (Id.)  He  told   the   OPM   investigator  that  he
intended  to  borrow  funds from  his 401k account to  pay  his delinquent tax  debt. (GE  10  at
4)  His tax  transcripts for TY  2014  did not show  a  repayment  plan  with  the  IRS. (GE  4  at
10; AE  B) His October 1, 2021 IRS  tax transcript for TY 2014 shows an account balance
of  $6,112. (AE  B) Applicant’s October 1, 2021  IRS  tax  transcript for TY  2020  shows on
April 15,  2021, he  had  a  $1,332  credit transferred  to  address  his  TY  2014  tax  debt, and
he  received  a  $360  refund. (GE  3  at 18)  The  $360  refund  shows all of  his federal income
taxes are paid through  TY 2020.
SOR  ¶¶  1.c  and  1.d  allege  Applicant  failed  to  timely  file  his  federal  and  state
income tax returns for TYs 2010, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018. (GE 3)
On September 30, 2021, in response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant did not
fill in the rows in the tables showing his federal and state tax returns were filed for TYs
2010, 2012, and 2013. (GE 3 at 2, 4) His September 24, 2020 TY 2015 IRS tax transcript
indicates in 2018 the IRS assessed an additional tax of $1,900;  he had a $274 penalty
for filing his tax return late; and no payments were shown to address his tax debt. (GE 4
at 5-6) His account balance owed on September 24, 2020, was $5,593. (GE 4 at 5) He
said he paid this tax debt. (GE 3 at 2) The IRS $360 refund of his TY 2020 taxes shows
the IRS concluded all of his previous federal income taxes were paid. (GE 3 at 18)
The information in the following table is based on Applicant’s September 24, 2020
and October 1, 2021 IRS tax transcripts. (GE 4; AE A-AE D) Adjusted gross income is

Applicant’s October 1, 2021 TY 2011 IRS tax transcript shows he had an IRS tax
payment agreement from November 2016 to February 2018. (GE 3 at 8) He made nine
payments from $80 to $155. (Id.) In October 2018, his debt to the IRS for TY 2011 was
paid. (Id.)
Applicant’s  September  25,  2020  TY  2016  IRS  tax  transcript  indicates  the  IRS
assessed an additional penalty of $125 for filing his tax return late; and his September
24, 2020 IRS tax transcript for TY 2016 shows an account balance owed of $327. (GE 4
at 7-8) He said he paid this tax debt. (GE 3 at 2)
On February 14, 2020, Applicant told an OPM investigator that he timely filed his
2015 and 2016 state tax returns. (GE 10 at 2) He said he would provide information about
when he filed some of his tax returns after his hearing. (Tr. 52) At the time of his hearing,
he had not filed his federal and state tax returns for TY 2021; he had not requested an
extension; and he said he needs additional documentation to get his tax return filed. (Tr.
53-55) On September 17, 2022, Applicant paid a bill of $275 for  preparation of one or
more tax returns. (AE E) This is apparently a receipt for preparation of his TY 2021 federal
and state income tax returns. Applicant said all of his tax debts were paid. (Tr. 50)
In sum, Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for
TYs 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018. There was no evidence presented  that he requested
any filing extensions. Applicant said he failed to timely file several tax returns because of
“neglect” and a lack of a “sense of urgency.” (Tr. 51) He suspected that he owed the IRS,
and he delayed filing his tax returns. (Tr. 51) His federal income taxes for TY 2011 were
not paid until 2018, and his federal income taxes for TY 2014 were not paid until April 15,
2021, when part of his refund for TY 2020 was transferred to address his TY 2014 tax
debt.

$1,418, $2,501, and $6,982. (Tr. 25; GE 5 at 2; GE 6 at 2-3; GE 7 at 4-5; GE 7 at 5; GE

Applicant said he  attempted  to  get his student loans forgiven; however, he  learned
he  was not eligible  to  have  his student loans  forgiven. (Tr. 58)  He intends to   pursue  a
master’s degree. (Tr.  58) Once  he  starts his master’s program, he  will  be  able  to  obtain a
forbearance  on  his student  loans. (Tr. 100) He  intends  to  pay  his student loans.  (Tr.  58)
He has  not made  any  payments  to  address his student  loans  since  about 2017. (Tr. 62-
63)  He did not present  documentary evidence to show his most recent payments.
In March 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the President directed the
Department  of  Education  (D.ED.)  to  place  federal  student  loans  in  forbearance.  The
federal  government  extended  the  student  loan  payment  pause  through  December  31,
2022. The pause includes the following relief measures for eligible loans: a suspension
of  loan payments; a 0% interest rate; and stopped collections on defaulted loans.  See
Federal  Student  Aid  website,  https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19.
The   President   announced   forgiveness  of   $10,000   or  $20,000   of   student  loan   debt;
however,  this  program  is  currently   on   hold   due   to   litigation   in   the   8th   Circuit  Court  of
Appeals.  See  Desiree  Montilla,  “Experts weigh  in on  temporary  hold  placed  on  student

SOR ¶ 1.k alleges a charged-off debt for $22,619. (GE 5 at 2; GE 6 at 4; GE 7 at
6;  GE  11 at 2; GE 12)  Applicant was  in  an accident, and his car was  damaged  to the
extent that it was not economically repairable. (Tr. 63 106) He was injured in the accident;
however, he did not indicate  that he lost income due to the accident. (Tr. 106) His car
insurance had lapsed, and he acknowledged his responsibility for the debt. (Tr. 64) He
said he made two payments on his loan to purchase the vehicle, and then the creditor
advised him the debt was charged off. (Tr. 64-65) He said the creditor stopped accepting
payments. (Tr. 67) He intends to pay this debt. (Tr. 65) He said he would try to get some
documentation  about  the  debt  after  the  hearing;  however,  he  did  not  provide  anything
about this debt after the hearing. (Tr. 68)
Applicant received  financial counseling  as part of  the  bankruptcy  process. (GE 2
at  61)  He  maintains   a   budget.   (Tr.  99)  He   has  about  $40,000   in   his  401k   retirement
account.  (Tr. 102) He has about $1,500  monthly  remaining  after paying  his expenses. (Tr.
99) He  intends  to  use  the  $1,500  monthly  discretionary  income  or remainder to  assist his
son  with  his college  expenses, to  travel to  his son’s sports events,  and  to  pay  for his son’s
car. (Tr. 100-101)
Sexual Behavior,  Personal Conduct, and Information Technology
SOR ¶  2.a  alleges under the  sexual behavior guideline  that  Applicant videotaped
women’s buttocks  and  genital areas without  their  knowledge  or consent  prior to  October
2017  for sexual gratification.  (GE 8)
SOR ¶ 3.a alleges under the personal conduct guideline that Applicant received a
corrective action memo (CAM) in about December 2017, from his employer for: allowing
his employer-issued phone (EIP) to be accessed by a non-employee; failing to take steps
to secure his password; and recording videos of sexually explicit material on his EIP. (Tr.
87; GE 8; GE 9 at 6)
SOR ¶ 3.b alleges under the personal conduct guideline that Applicant failed to
report to his facility security officer (FSO) that his former girlfriend stole his EIP until she
attempted to extort him for rent.
SOR ¶ 3.c alleges under the personal conduct guideline that Applicant used his
EIP to view pornography from about January 2017 to about November 2017.
SOR  ¶  3.d  cross  alleges  under the  personal conduct  guideline  the  allegation  in
SOR ¶ 2.a.
SOR ¶ 4.a cross alleges under the information technology guideline the allegations
in SOR ¶¶ 3.a to 3.d.
Applicant videotaped women’s buttocks and genital areas prior to October 2017.
(Tr. 77, 91) According to the employer’s report, “The women pictured were fully clothed”
in the 25 videos found on Applicant’s EIP. (GE 9 at 6) About half of the videos were taken
of  several  women  at  stores  and  at  a  children’s  school.  (GE  9  at  19)  At  his  hearing,
Applicant claimed the videos were of only three women: his girlfriend, his fiancée, and a
woman in a store. (Tr. 78, 119) The 25 videos of women showed them wearing various
articles of clothing and of the crotch of one of the women while she was sitting facing him.
(Tr. 118) At his hearing, he said he used his personal cellphone and not his EIP to take
the  pictures  or  videos  of  the  women’s  buttocks  and  genitals.  (Tr.  92)  However,  his
employer’s report stated Applicant “admitted taking the videos using his [EIP] within the
last few months leading up to the investigation when his personal cell phone was broken.”
(GE 9 at 6)
Applicant  claimed   all   of   the   videos  were  with   the   consent  of   the   women   except
when   he   videotaped   one   woman   walking   in a   store  without   her consent.  (Tr. 117-118)
Applicant  said  at   his   hearing   that   the   woman   he   videotaped   in   the   store  was  wearing
slacks.  (Tr. 118) His girlfriend  said the  video  of  her was taken  without her consent,  and
she   said   multiple   women   were  videotaped   in   stores.   (GE   9   at  6)  He  denied   that  the
pictures he  took were pornographic.  (Tr. 80) He said  “Everybody  was fully  clothed.” (Tr.
80)  He said he  would provide  a  statement after his hearing  from  his fiancée  indicating  the
videos of  her body  were  made  with  her consent;  however, he  did not  provide  a  statement
from  her or an  explanation  for why  he  failed  to  provide  it. (Tr. 122) The  pictures  or videos
were not part of the  security  file  provided  to  me.  The  employer report indicated  no  nude
photographs were found on his EIP.
Applicant said he was trading his personal cell phone in for a replacement, and he
downloaded  his  pictures  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  2.a  onto  his  EIP.  (Tr.  75,  84)  He  also  had
pornography  on  his  personal  cell  phone  that  he  transferred  to  his  EIP;  however,  his
employer’s  report did not describe  any pornography found on his EIP. (Tr. 83-84) The
employer  report  described  the  pictures  and  videos  as  “inappropriate”  rather  than  as
pornographic. He said he wanted to preserve the pornography on his EIP so that he could
transfer it back to his new privately-owned phone. (Tr. 83, 92) He used the pornography
to  enable him  to  get  sexually aroused.  (Tr. 83)  At  his hearing,  he said  he  was  unsure
whether he used his EIP to view the pornography that he transferred from his personal
phone. (Tr. 84-85) He did not define the term “pornography.”
As to how his girlfriend obtained possession of his EIP, Applicant’s girlfriend was
visiting him. (Tr. 72-73) He knew her cell phone was broken, and she needed a cell phone.
(Tr. 72-73) He went to check on his son, and he left his girlfriend in the kitchen where his
EIP was located. (Tr. 73) When Applicant returned to the kitchen, his girlfriend was gone.
(Tr.  73)  Later  in  the  evening,  his  girlfriend  called  him,  and  Applicant  realized  she  was
using  his EIP.  (Tr.  74) He  left  his password  behind  the foam  padding  of  the  container
holding his EIP. (Tr. 74-75) She said she was going to use his EIP to conduct some of
her own business. (Tr. 74) She did not have access to classified information on the EIP.
(Tr.  75)  Applicant’s  girlfriend  returned  the  EIP  the  day  after  she  took  it.  (Tr.  79,  94)
Applicant  did  not  report  her  accessing  his  EIP  because  he  did  not  believe  she  could
access classified information on his EIP. (Tr. 94) His former girlfriend attempted to extort
rent of about $1,100 from him in return for her silence about the sexual videos on his EIP.
(Tr. 88; GE 10 at 2) Applicant refused to pay her to keep her from reporting the videos on
his EIP. (Id.)
Applicant learned that his employer knew about the incident involving his EIP when
his manager told him that a woman made allegations against him, and they wanted to
check his EIP. (Tr. 86) When he received the CAM, a manager told him that he made the
right decision when he chose not to give in to the woman’s extortion, and management
still  considered  him  to  be  a  trustworthy  employee.  (Tr.  88)  In  addition  to  the  CAM,
Applicant received about seven days of suspension from work without pay. (Tr. 87-88)
Applicant knew it was wrong to use his EIP to make and store videos of women’s buttocks.
(GE 9 at 8) Applicant told his employer that he did not want his fellow employees to know
about his videotaping of women’s buttocks.
Applicant’s former girlfriend also informed his Navy Reserve unit about the videos
on his EIP, and according to Applicant, his Navy Reserve unit said, “what you do is your
business, they said,  but it wasn’t our phone. It  wasn’t any of  our equipment. They said
they don’t condone that type of behavior, but that was basically it. The Navy was like, hey,
you know, this is not use. This is basically [your employer].” (Tr. 96) There is no evidence
of any adverse action from the Navy for the incident involving misuse of his EIP.
",False
"In Applicant’s Answer, he denied all the SOR allegations, with explanations. After
a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  evidence  submitted,  I  make  the
following additional findings of fact.
Applicant  is  60  years  old.  He  is  married  for  the  second  time.  His  first  marriage
was  from 1984 until 2011  when he  divorced.  He married the second  time in  2015.  He
has  two  adult  children  from  his  first  marriage  and  two  adult  stepchildren  from  his
second.  He  currently  works  for  a  defense  contractor  for  whom  he  has  worked  since
2006.  He  has  a  bachelor’s  degree  in  engineering.  He  was  first  granted  a  security
clearance  2012.  In  2019,  he  was  denied  sensitive  compartmented  information  (SCI)
access  by  an  other  government  agency  (OGA)  after  two  days  of  polygraph  interviews
and tests in April 2017. The information from the OGA led to the issuance of the SOR
here. (Tr. 26-27; GE 3-5)
Under Guideline D, the SOR alleged that Applicant, from 1985 to February 2017,
on at least nine occasions, paid women for sexual acts, including after being granted a
security  clearance  in  2012.  (SOR  ¶  1.a)  This  allegation  was  also  cross-alleged  under
Guideline E. (SOR ¶ 2.a) It was also alleged under Guideline E that Applicant provided
material  false  information  during  an  interview  with  the  OGA  on  April  25,  2017,  by
denying he paid for sexual acts during a recent trip to another state. (SOR ¶ 2.b)
In approximately 2017, Applicant was being considered by the OGA for access to
SCI  information.  As  a  requirement  for  that  access,  Applicant  was  required  to  undergo
interviews  and  polygraph  examinations.  These  interviews  and  polygraph  examinations
with agents from the OGA took place on April 25-26, 2017. As a result of the information
compiled by the OGA from the interviews, Applicant was initially denied access to SCI in
March  2018,  and  that  decision  was  finalized  in  March  2019.  The  OGA’s  investigative
report  and  the  SCI  denial  decisions  are  contained  in  GE  5.  Applicant  participated  in
interviews  with  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM)  agents  in  August  2019  and
April  2020,  as  part  of  his  background  investigation  for  this  clearance  action.
Summarized reports were prepared of those interviews. In January 2021, Applicant was
given  the  opportunity  to  review  the  summarized  statements  and  make  corrections
and/or  additions  to  them,  which  he  did.  Those  summarized  OPM  statements  and
Applicant’s responses are contained in GE 4. (Tr. 35-36; GE 4-5)
I  have   examined   all   the   evidence   needed   for  resolution   of  this   case.   Several
pieces of evidence require examination in detail and are set forth below.
Applicant’s Hearing Testimony
Applicant  admitted  that  when  he  was  in  his  20s  (mid-1980s)  he  went  to  two
modeling studios in the state where he was living and received manual stimulation from
females on both occasions. He admitted these acts during his April 25, 2017 polygraph
interview.  He  also  admitted  that  a  third  similar  incident  happened  in  another  state.  He
was not arrested for these acts and he did not hold a security clearance at the time. He
stated that when he disclosed this information to the OGA agents in April 2017, they told
him he was failing the polygraph because of his breathing. (Tr. 24-26)
Applicant’s  divorce  from  his first  wife  was  finalized  in  November 2011.  In  2012,
he  went  to  Germany  on  a  work  trip.  He  had  relatives  there  so  he  also  incorporated
some personal time during that trip. He was feeling lonely because of his recent divorce
so he visited a brothel on four occasions while in Germany. He believed prostitution was
legal in Germany at that time. He had never been to a brothel before then and has not
been back to one. He held a security clearance at the time. He stated that he was not
briefed or instructed on disclosing this information to a security officer since he believed
his  actions  were  legal.  He  disclosed  this foreign  travel  on  his  2013  security  clearance
application (SCA). (Tr. 26-29; GE 2, p. 64)
Applicant  regularly  exercised  and  to  relieve  muscle  pain  from  his  workouts  he
has  also  regularly  got  massages  afterwards.  He  has  probably  had  approximately  60
massages  over  the  years.  At  one  time  he  had  a  membership  to  a  national  massage
chain.  Sometime  after  2013,  he  sought  a  massage  after  a  workout  and  went  to  a
massage parlor. While being massaged, the masseuse began manually stimulating his
genitals. Applicant did not seek out this treatment. He did not say yes to this stimulation,
but he also did not fight her off. No pay was offered or solicited for this “service.” He did
pay  the  massage  fee  and  provided  a  tip,  which  is  customary  in  this  service  business.
Applicant never returned to this massage parlor. (Tr. 29-31; SOR Answer)
The  second  occasion  where  Applicant  experienced  an  unsolicited  sexual
advance  by  a  masseuse  occurred  in  late  2016  or  early  2017.  Applicant  was  in  a
different state and was waiting to pick up his wife at the airport. He had several hours
before  she  arrived  and  decided  to  get  a  massage.  He  randomly  selected  a  massage
parlor  and  went  there  for  a  massage.  While  getting  the  massage,  the  masseuse
grabbed his genitals and asked him if he liked it, to which he responded “no.” She then
exposed her breasts to him, which caused him to ejaculate. He did not solicit this action
by the masseuse. He paid for the massage and left a customary tip. He later picked up
his wife at the airport and told her what happened at the massage parlor. Since this last
incident,  he  has  never  been  back  to  a  massage  parlor.  He  now  treats  his  workout
muscle fatigue with regular trips to a chiropractor. (Tr. 31-34, 43-44)
Applicant testified that he did not have to volunteer to take the polygraph in 2017.
He  held  a  top  secret  clearance  before  the  polygraph  and  his  job  at  that  time  did  not
require that he take one. He took the polygraph because passing it would allow him to
be  involved  in  new  roles  for  the  company.  He  fully  cooperated  with  the  polygraphers
and  when  they  questioned  his  truthfulness,  he  told  them  about  every  embarrassing
incident  in  his  past.  This  was  the  first  time  he  took  a  polygraph.  Ironically,  after  the
polygraph  and  the  denial  of  his  SCI  access  by  the  OGA,  he  continued  to  support that
agency on other projects as recently as a week before this hearing. (Tr. 35-36, 40; SOR
Answer)
Applicant has continued to do classified work for his company in the intervening
five years since the polygraph test. He continues to have access to top secret material.
He has been his company’s facility security officer (FSO) for the past five years and was
most  recently  appointed  by  his  CEO  in  2020.  He  is  also  a  member  of  the  company’s
insider threat team. (Tr. 40-41; AE A-C)
2017 Report of Polygraph Interviews of Applicant on April 25-26, 2017  (GE5)
It  is unclear if  the  report that is reflected  in GE  5  (pp.1-24) is the  complete  report
of  Applicant’s investigation  by  the  OGA. The  handwritten  page  numbers appear to  have
been made  by  Department Counsel and  not by  the  author(s) of the report.  The  author(s)
of  the  report  are  not  identified. No  person  identified  with  creating  the  report was called
as a witness by the Government at hearing.
The report described an interview with Applicant on April 25, 2017. Under a topic
heading  of  “Crime,”  the  report  indicated  that  in  1985  to  1990,  Applicant  stated  that  he
was with two females on two different occasions at two different massage parlors where
he  paid  $50 for manual  stimulation.  The  report  does  not  describe or  cite  to  what  laws
were violated on these occasions. In his response to the OGA’s SCI denial action, and
while admitting to the conduct, Applicant disputed that these acts occurred at massage
parlors,  but  rather  at  nude  modeling  establishments,  otherwise  known  as  strip-clubs.
The report also described a 1990 trip to a nude modeling place where Applicant paid for
and received manual stimulation. He admitted this conduct in his response to the denial
action. (GE 5, pp. 20, (Applicant’s April 2018, response  to  the  OGA’s clearance  action
comprises pp.29-42 of GE 5))
The  report  further  described  the  following  incidents  purportedly  disclosed  by
Applicant during his post-polygraph interview on April 25, 2017:
From  2011  to  2015,  on  four  different  occasions at  four different  brothels, S
(subject) paid 50  Euros for vaginal  and  oral intercourse  with  nude  females
appearing in their 20s to 40s.  (Incident 1)
In  2015, S  was in [State] and  went to  a  massage  parlor. S  paid $60  for a
massage   and   received   manual  stimulation   of   his  penis  to   the   point   of
ejaculation.   S   reported   the   female   appeared   to   be   in   her  30s   and   was
topless.  (Incident 2)
In  2016, S  was in [another state]  and  went with  his  wife  to  get a  massage.
During   the   massage   S   became   aroused   and   the   masseuse   grabbed   S’s
penis and lifted her shirt. S reported that he  felt  uncomfortable and told her
to stop. S paid $60  for the  massage. (Incident 3)(GE 5, p. 20)
Regarding  Incident  1  above,  Applicant’s  April  2018  clearance  denial  response
admitted  that  he  visited  the  same  German  brothel  four  times  in  2012.  He  did  not  visit
multiple  brothels  over  multiple  years  as  described  in  the  report.  He  described  why  he
visited  the  brothel  (recent  divorce),  that  he  believed  his  actions  were  lawful  because
brothels are legal in Germany, and that he has never been back to a brothel since those
actions in 2012. He also was unaware of any security reporting requirement because of
his actions. (GE 5, pp. 29-30)
Regarding   Incidents   2   and   3   above,  Applicant’s  April  2018   clearance   denial
response   admitted   that  he   visited   massage   parlors  in   2013,  not   2015,   as   described   in
the  report and  in 2016. He stated  that he  has visited  massage  parlors 50-60  times over
the  years to  help him  with  severe leg  and  back pain. He did not frequent these  places
for the purpose  of receiving  “paid or  unpaid  sexual favors.”  He always paid the  massage
fee  and the customary tip.  (GE 5, p. 30)
The  report  described  the  follow-up  questioning  purportedly  disclosed  by
Applicant during his pre-polygraph interview on April 26, 2017:
During   the   pre-test   interview,  S   advised   that   the   information   that  he
provided   during   the   previous  polygraph   interview   on   25   April  2017
regarding   going   to   a   massage   parlor  was  not  correct.   S   clarified   that  he
traveled   to   [an   out   of  state   city]  for  work  related   purposes  in   February
2017  and  he  went to  a  local massage  parlor for a  massage  in his free  time
knowing  that the  massage  could  end  in  some  form  of sexual gratification.
Towards the  end  of the  massage,  the  masseuse, who  was a  30  to  40  year
old female  of  Asian  decent  [sic], started  to  brush  his  penis with  her hand
and   arm.  She   asked   S   if   he   liked   it  and   he   responded   “yes.”  The
masseuse  then  started  “flashing” or showing  her chest to  him  which made
S  become  sexually  aroused. She  then  “grabbed” S’s penis  with  her hand
and  he  received  manual stimulation  to  the  point  of  ejaculation.  At  no  time
did S  resist this touching. S  paid  approximately  $60  for the  massage  and
gave the masseuse a  $30  to  $40 “tip” for her service.
S  previously  reported  that  he  went with  his wife  to  get  a  massage  during
this  incident,   however,   he   stated   during   this  interview   that  he   did  not  go
with  his wife. He did, however, tell  his wife  that the  masseuse  touched  his
penis,  but that  nothing  else happened  because  he  did  not want to  hurt her
in anyway….
During Applicant’s hearing  cross examination by Department Counsel, Applicant
denied  that  he  told  the  polygraphers  that  he  went  to  the  massage  parlors  for  sexual
gratification  during  his  April  26,  2017  interview.  Applicant  believes  the  polygrapher
skewed his answer when Applicant responded to the repeated question of  whether he
was  thinking  about  being  sexually  gratified  when  he  went  to  the  massage  parlor  by
maybe  subconsciously  wanting  it  to  happen.  Applicant  also  denied  that  he  told  the
polygrapher that he  liked  what was  happening  when  asked by the masseuse. He also
denied his purported statement that he did not resist the touching. (Tr. 50-53)
Applicant’s   Background  Investigation  Interview   Conducted  in  April   2020   and
Applicant’s   Correction,  Additions,   and  Deletions  to   that  Interview   submitted  in
January 2021 (GE 4)
During  his  April  2020  background  interview,  Applicant  was  asked  about  the
incidents  that  led  to  his  SCI  access  denial  by  the  OGA.  The  interviewer  summarized
that information as follows:
In   2017,   Subject   was  in  [another  city   and   state]  and   went  to   a   local
[massage  chain]  in  order to  get  a  massage  for pain related  to  working  out.
During   the   massage,  Subject   became   aroused   and   the   masseuse   [sic]
while   he   was  falling   asleep.   The   masseuse   grabbed   his  genitals  and
began   to   lift  her  shirt.   Subject  told  her  to   stop.  Subject  admitted   that  he
subconsciously   might  have   wanted   her  to   continue   but  he   felt  very
uncomfortable.   Subject  paid   for  the   massage   and   left  immediately.  He
never returned  to  that massage  parlor. Immediately  following, Subject  told
his wife  about this incident because  she  was the  one  who  recommended
that  he   go   to   [massage   chain].  However,   she   was  not  present  as
previously  indicated   in   past  interviews.  When   asked   about  this  incident-
during
that
subconsciously   [sic]  might  have   wanted   manual  stimulation   to   be
performed,  but  consciously   he   did  not  and   to   him   the   question   did  not
make  sense.  He was asked  by  the  polygrapher if he  had  noticed  a  sign  on
the   wall   that  said   it  was  illegal  and/or  did  he   report   it  to   anyone   in  the
establishment or to  the  police, to  which he  did  not.  (GE 4, p. 9  (pagination
at bottom right of each  page))
the   polygraph,   he   admitted   during
the   polygraph
Applicant  made  several  additions  and  corrections  to  the  above  summarized
information  when  he was  first  allowed  to  review it  in  January 2021.  Those  corrections
are stated verbatim below:
I did  not  state  “[name  of  massage  chain]” but rather had  told them  at one
time  I had  maintained  a  membership  at  [massage  chain]  over the  years. I
volunteered  that information to show that I had gotten countless massages
over the  years  that did  not involve  an  incident.  I was on  travel and  do  not
remember the name of the  massage parlor I visited in  2017.
I  never  stated   that   my   wife   was  present   at   any   time   during   any   of  the
events listed  in  the  interviews. My  wife  was flying  into  [the  state] that  day
and  I  was on  my  way  to  pick  her up  at  the  airport.  In  my  interview, I stated
that  I  told  my  wife  what happened  at  the  massage  parlor  (and  not  that she
was  present  at   the   parlor).  I  have   reiterated   this  fact  several  times  and   I
am  not sure why  the  topic keeps  coming  up  as I  have  provided  the  same
correction every time.
After I told the  polygrapher that I did not go  to  the  parlor with  the  intent of
receiving   manual   stimulation,  and   that  I   told   her  no   and   to   stop.  [sic]  He
then   repeatedly   asked   me   if  I  was  thinking   it.  I  then   said,  “maybe
subconsciously?” He smiled  at me  and  said yes. I then  mentioned  the  fact
that  I  saw   the   sign   at  the   entrance   when   I  came   into   the   facility   so
obviously  thinking  it subconsciously  seemed  out of  place.  This is when  the
polygrapher became visibly and verbally angry  with me.  (GE 4, p. 12)
Applicant  explained  his  answers  to  the  polygraphers  by  pointing  out  that  the
polygraphers  repeatedly  insinuated  that  he  had  committed  serious  crimes  such  as
murder and rape when they told him after his day one polygraph that his breathing was
not  right  and  he  was  failing  the  test.  In  an  effort  to  cooperate,  Applicant  revealed  this
personal information that was quite embarrassing. (GE 4, P. 14)
Character Evidence
During  his  clearance  review  with  the  OGA,  Applicant  provided  a  number  of
character statements from work colleagues and personal friends. Included among those
statements  were  two  from  his  current  CEO.  He  stated  that  Applicant  is  honest,
trustworthy,  forthright,  and  that  his  character  is  beyond  reproach.  He  strongly
recommends  that  he  retain  his  clearance.  Two  other  coworkers  attest  to  Applicant’s
loyalty, reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. A retired Navy captain who has
known  Applicant  for  over  40  years  also  noted  his  traits  for  reliability,  honesty,  and
trustworthiness. Two neighbors, who have known Applicant for over 20 years described
his honesty, trustworthiness, and reliability. (GE 5, pp. 34-42)

"In his Answer, Applicant admitted SOR allegations ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b (in part), and 3.a.
He  denied  SOR  allegations  ¶¶  2.a  and  2.b.  His  admissions  are  incorporated  into  the
findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  evidence
submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 45 years old. He was married in 2000, and divorced in 2018. He has
two minor children  with his former wife. He earned  a  bachelor’s degree  in 1999  and  a
master’s degree in 2007. He has worked for a large defense contractor since 2001, and
is employed as a support planning and management engineer. He has held a security
clearance since 2001. (Items 3, 4)
In  March  2019,  Applicant  was  arrested  as  part  of  a  police  sting  operation,  for
patronizing  a  prostitute.  He  responded  to  an  advertisement  on  a  website  known  for
prostitution. The advertisement was posted and monitored by an undercover detective in
the  local  police  department.  Applicant  exchanged  several  text  massages  with  the
undercover detective, and requested a sex act in exchange for money.  He went to the
designated meet-up location, which was a local motel, and requested the room number
by text message. He was stopped by police leaving the motel parking lot. During the stop,
the detective confirmed that Applicant’s phone was used to respond to the advertisement
and send the text messages. After being charged with patronizing a prostitute, he entered
a plea deal and the charge was reduced to criminal trespass. He pled guilty and received
an 18-month deferred sentence, a fine, a requirement to attend “John school,” and take
an HIV test. He was also ordered to stay away from the motel where he was arrested and
any online websites hosting personal ads for dating services. (Item 5, 6, 7)
Applicant was also stopped in 2005 by police for picking up two prostitutes on the
street, one who was a minor at the time. The record states that after the stop, he told the
officer that he believed the women were prostitutes. He was not arrested, but the officer
gave him a verbal warning. (Item 6, 7)
In Applicant’s July 2020 background interview with a government investigator, he
reported that he had patronized prostitutes in 2015 during a period of turbulence in his
marriage. He initially described these encounters as affairs with “many women,” but later
admitted to the investigator that these women were prostitutes. His wife discovered his
activities  because  the  money  he  was  spending  appeared  suspicious  on  their  financial
statements. This circumstance resulted in her filing for divorce. (Item 5).
In Applicant’s September 2021 background interview, he admitted that he has a
sex addiction. He also stated that he would not engage in this behavior again, and claimed
that  he  was  controlling  his  urges.  He  reported  that  he  was  seeking  anonymous  group
counseling, through an online virtual service. (Item 5)
In  his  Response,  Applicant  stated  that  he  was  diagnosed  with  sex  addiction  in
2015, and had participated in several years of counseling. He also reported that, in 2015,
he  began  attending  weekly  meetings  of  Sex  Addicts  Anonymous,  which  is  a  12-step
program. He attended those meetings in person until 2020, and then virtually because of
the pandemic. It is unknown whether he is still attending these meetings. He stated that
after his 2019 arrest, he sought comprehensive addiction treatment for three weeks at an
inpatient facility. (Response)
Applicant submitted a letter from his former counselor that states that he attended
therapy  with  her  from  2015  through  2020,  and  that  he  sought  treatment  for  sexual
compulsivity issues, and struggled with depression and anxiety. He also submitted a letter
from  a  rehabilitation  center that  states  in  March  and  April  2019,  he  received  a  21-day
inpatient residential clinical and therapeutic treatment. It does not state for what condition
he was treated. No assessment, prognosis, or further information was provided by either
treatment provider. (AE A, B)
The SOR alleges:
SOR ¶  1.a: Applicant was arrested  in March 2019  and  charged  with  patronizing  a
prostitute. He admitted  the  allegation.  (Item  2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)
SOR ¶  1.b: Applicant engaged  in solicitation of prostitutes in about 2015  and  was
questioned   by   police.  He  admitted   engaging   in  solicitation   in   2015,  but  denied   being
questioned by police in 2015. The  Government submitted evidence  showing  that he was
questioned by police in 2005, not 2015. (Item  2, 5, 6, 7)
SOR ¶  2.a: Applicant failed  to  report his charge  for patronizing  a  prostitute  to  his
employer’s facility  security  officer (FSO),  as required  by  the  National Industrial Security
Program   Operating   Manual  (NISPOM).   He   denied   the   allegation   and   claims   that   his
failure to  report was a  misunderstanding. He  explained  that he  thought that he  did  not
have  to  report the  incident  until he  filled  out his next SCA,  which was submitted  about a
year  later.   He  claimed   that  he   did  not  intend   to   hide   the   arrest.  He  discrepantly   also
asserted  that he  asked  the  FSO  for a  form  to  report the  adverse information, and  was told
there was not  one. He  stated  that he  did not understand  the  reporting  process in 2019,
and   was  unaware  of   any   reporting   issue   until  he   received   the   SOR  in  May   2022.  He
admitted  that  he  told  a  former co-worker about his arrest, but  not  his manager or  then
current co-workers. (Item  2, 5; Response)
SOR  ¶   2.b:  Cross-alleged   the   allegations  in   ¶¶   1.a   and   1.b   under   Guideline   E
(personal  conduct).  Applicant  denied   the   allegations  on   the   basis   that  it  is  redundant.

SOR  ¶   3.a:  Cross-alleged   the   allegations  in   ¶¶   1.a   and   1.b   under  Guideline   J
(criminal conduct). Applicant admitted  the allegation. (Item  2)
Applicant stated that he has had a security clearance for 20 years, and has always
safeguarded classified information. He  admitted  making mistakes of  personal conduct,
and  that  he  continued  to  take  steps  so  that  he  does  not  repeat  those  mistakes.

(Transcript (Tr.) at 11-13, 23, 30-31, 50, 60; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1; AE B,
D)
Applicant was stationed  in Germany  from  2010  to  2012. In  about the  summer of
2011, he  had  sexual intercourse on  two  occasions with  a  dependent daughter (AB) of  a
U.S.  service  member.   AB   was  15   or  had   just   turned   16   at  the   time.  Applicant  told
investigators that she  was 15  years old, but  she  told  him  that she  was 19  years old.  He
stated  that  they  remained  friends  after he  found  out  how  old she  was, but they  did not
engage  in any  additional sexual activity. AB  later told military  investigators that she  was
16 years old at the  time of  the sexual encounters.1 (Tr. at 44-46, 51; GE 3)
Applicant had sexual relations in about 2012 with a female who was about 18 or
older. She introduced him on Facebook to her friend (XY) who was 15 years old at the
time. She turned 16 in early August 2013. Applicant stated that because the first woman
was of age, he assumed XY was about the same age. XY lived in the Republic of Korea
(Korea)  as  the  dependent  daughter  of  a  civilian  employee  of  the  U.S.  military.  From
about January 2013 to March 2013, Applicant and XY exchanged naked photographs of
each  other.  She  also  sent  him  a  video  of  her  masturbating.  (Tr.  at  15-17,  31-34;
Applicant’s response  to  SOR; GE  3) The photographs of XY and the video constituted
child  pornography  under  18  U.S.C.  §§  2252  and  2256.  Under  the  statutes,  a  child  or
“minor” means any person under the age of 18 years.
Applicant  transferred  to  Korea  in  March  2013.  He  met  XY  and  her  friend  at  a
concert in June 2013. He stated that entrants to the concert had to be 19 years old. XY
said she was 18. Her friend said that XY was not 18, and XY quickly said she was 17.
Applicant and XY met the following weekend in late June 2013, and ended up in a hotel,
where  they  performed  oral  sex  on  each  other  and  had  sexual  intercourse.  Applicant
took a picture of her performing oral sex on him. By doing so, Applicant produced child
pornography  in  violation  of  18  U.S.C.  §§  2251  and  2252  and  the  Uniform  Code  of
Military Justice (UCMJ). (Tr. at 13-17, 33-35;  Applicant’s response to  SOR; GE  3)  The
fact  that  he  might  have  thought  that  she  was  17  is not a  defense because  the  statute
covers minors 17 years of age and younger.
1  This conduct was not alleged in the SOR. Any matter that was not alleged in the SOR will not be used
for disqualification purposes. It may be considered in assessing Applicant’s credibility, in judging whether
he  has  an  affirmative  defense,  in  the  application  of  mitigating  conditions,  and  in  the  whole-person
analysis.
Applicant  and  XY  engaged  in  a  series  of  graphic  sexual  messages  in  July  and
early  August,  before  XY  turned  16.  At  one  point  he  wrote:  “I  wanted  you!!  You  were
sexy.  I  don’t  care  how  old  you  are,”  and  “You  are  a  complete  exception.  Even  if  you
were 13, I’d seriously have to consider still doing you.” You’re just to[o] sexy!” (Tr. at 18,
37; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3)
Applicant met XY in a club in late July or August 2013, when XY was 15 or had
recently turned 16. XY performed oral sex on him behind a pillar on the dance floor, and
they  had  sexual  intercourse  in  the  ladies’  room.  Applicant  told  investigators  that  it
occurred  in  July  2013,  and  that  he  still  thought  she  was  17  at  the  time.  He  told
investigators that he found out XY’s age when her friend told him in late August or early
September that XY “was turning 16.” XY later told investigators that the incident at the
club happened in August 2013 after she turned 16. He testified that he knew XY was 16
years  old  during  the  incident  at  the  club.  (Tr.  at  37-40,  49-52;  Applicant’s  response  to
SOR; GE 3)
The  only  evidence  that the  sexual activity  at the  club  occurred  when  XY  was 15
is  Applicant’s  statement  to   investigators  that   it  was  “late   July,  I  believe.”  (GE  3)  I  am
unable  to   find   by   substantial   evidence   that   XY   was  15   during   the   second   incident.
However,  Applicant  knew   XY   was  turning   16.  If  the   sex   occurred   after  XY   turned   16,
then  Applicant  had  to  know  she  was 16  years old  at  the  time,  and  his statement  to  the
investigators that he  did not know her age and still thought she was 17 was false.
Applicant had a married female first cousin who lived in the United States.  They
engaged  in  a series  of  graphic sexual messages  from about  June 2013  to September
2013. They discussed sending naked pictures to each other. Applicant sent his cousin
the  picture  of  XY  performing  oral  sex  on  him.  When  he  did  so,  he  transmitted  child
pornography into the United States in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2252 and 2260. (Tr. at
17-19, 40; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3)
Applicant stated that he was unaware of his cousin’s existence until around 2010,
when he was almost 20 years old and she was almost 28 years old. He stated that “the
confusions of adolescence” contributed to his conduct with his cousin. Applicant was 22
years old when he sent his cousin the picture of  XY. He has not had any contact with
his  cousin  since  he  came  under  investigation  by  the  military.  (Tr.  at  18-19,  40-42;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1, 3)
A  military criminal  investigation  was  initiated  in  September  2013  after  a  service
member  reported  that  Applicant  had  a  sexual  relationship  with  XY  when  she  was  15
years old. The investigators reviewed Applicant’s text messages. XY never revealed her
true age in the messages. On different occasions, she said she was 18, 17, and 16. (GE
3)
In  a  September  2013  message  to  his  cousin,  Applicant  stated  that  since  he
turned 18, he had sexual intercourse with two 15-year-olds and was masturbated by a
13-year-old.  In the  same message,  he  self-identified himself  as a pedophile.  Applicant
testified  that  he  did  not  know  why  he  wrote  those  messages.  He  stated  that  it  could
have been a typo or he added it in for shock value. He thinks that he was “plain lying to
[his cousin].” He relayed in messages to AB and XY that he could only get in trouble if
either of them told military investigators that he knew they were 15 years old when he
had sexual intercourse with them. (Tr. at 36; GE 3)
On  Applicant’s  iPad  or laptop  computer, the  investigators found  a  picture  of  XY
performing oral sex on him, a picture of XY performing a sex act on herself, and a video
of her performing the same sex act. Applicant was in possession of child pornography in
violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2252. He told investigators that it did not click in his mind that
he had child pornography, and if he had remembered, he would have deleted the files.
(GE 3)
Applicant  was  issued  a  military  protective  order  (MPO),  also  known  as  a  no
contact  order,  directing  him  to  have  no  contact  with  XY.  He  violated  that  order  on
several  occasions.  He  stated  in  his  SOR  response  that  he  communicated  with  XY  via
messenger app, when he asked her what was going on with the case. He testified that
he  did not intend  to  violate  the  order, and  he  “messaged  her just  to  tell  her that [they]
had a No Contact Order.” In other words, he contacted her to tell her that they could not
contact each other. (Tr. at 20-21, 47-49; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3)
Applicant was charged with multiple offenses under the UCMJ, including violating
the  MPO;  committing  sexual  acts  and  lewd  acts  on  a  child  under  the  age  of  16;
producing,  distributing,  and  possessing  child  pornography  involving  XY;  indecent
language to XY, a child under the age of 16; indecent exposure to XY in the nightclub;
and indecent language to his cousin. (Tr. at 13-14; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3)
Applicant was arraigned on the charges before a general court-martial. He stated
that  XY  refused  to  testify  against  him  and  they  are  still  friends.  The  charges  were
dismissed  in  January  2015  when  Applicant  accepted  an  under  other  than  honorable
conditions  discharge  in  lieu  of  trial  by  court-martial.  The  General  Court-Martial  Order
(GCMO)  promulgating  those  actions  was  issued  in  April  2015.  The  SOR  incorrectly
alleged that Applicant was charged on the date of the GCMO. (Tr. at 13-16, 20, 43, 44;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3; AE B)
Applicant  asserted  that  he  did  not  know  XY’s  true  age,  and  he  would  not  have
committed the sexual acts with her if he knew that she was under 16. He stated that the
age of consent in the military is 16, it was 13 at the time in Korea, and he thought she
was 17 or 18. He stated that he shared the sexually explicit picture of XY with his cousin
before  he  learned  she  was  15.  However,  federal  child  pornography  statutes  cover
children 17 years and younger, and Applicant admitted that he thought that she was 17.
(Tr. at 13-15, 50-52; Applicant’s response to SOR)
Applicant stated that alcohol contributed to some of the allegations. He stopped
drinking while  he  was  awaiting the  resolution of  the military charges.  He  asserted  that
he has learned from the experience, he has matured, and there has been no additional
misconduct since the military. (Tr. at 26-29, 42-43; Applicant’s response to SOR)
Applicant  was  evaluated  at  his  own  expense  by  a  licensed  psychologist  in
September 2022. Applicant described his military charges as follows:
I  submitted   a   Chapter   4   during   the   hearing   which  is  a   request  to   get  a
discharge  rather than  a  court martial.  The  case  had  been  going  on  for 20
months. I had  to  switch  lawyers. I had  like  20  minor charges against  me.
Most  were  dropped   or   recommended   to   be   dropped.  I  had   won   the   first
case  because  she  wouldn’t testify  and  it was  proven  that I didn’t know  she
was a  minor, but after I won  that case, they  piled  a  bunch  of other charges
on  me  so  my  lawyers advised  me  to  just  get out because  they  felt the  JAG
would keep  coming  after me  until they  won. My  lawyer said get out  before
I become a sex offender or something like that.
Applicant  never  told  the  psychologist  that  he  had  sex  with  a  15-year-old  girl
under similar circumstances about a year before XY. The psychologist determined that
Applicant did not have a mental health condition. He concluded:
I  did  not  find   [Applicant]   to   suffer  from   any   of   the   sexual  dysfunctions  or
paraphilic disorders described  in  the  DSM-5-TR  [Diagnostic and  Statistical
Manual   of  Mental   Disorders,  Fifth   Edition].   Likewise,  I  did   not  find   any   of
the  indicators in  [Applicant]  that are seen  in  people at high  risk for  sexual
offending.  I  do   not  believe,  based   on   his   personality   disposition   and
behavioral history,  that  [Applicant]   would  have   engaged   in  sexual activity
with   the   young   lady   in  2013   had   he   known  she   was  underage.  He  is not
considered   to   be   at  heightened   risk  for  criminal   sexual  behavior  in  the
future.  (AE G)
Applicant  submitted  documents  and  letters  attesting  to  his  excellent  job
performance and strong moral character. He is praised for his reliability, dependability,
trustworthiness,  loyalty  to  the  United  States,  honesty,  work  ethic,  intelligence,  and
responsibility. His girlfriend wrote, “Within the first month of our relationship, [Applicant]
had an honest conversation with me and told me about the unfortunate situation he had
in Korea. I knew from the start just from his persona that he was wronged.” (AE C)

"After a thorough and careful review of  the pleadings, the Government’s exhibits,

Applicant  is  66  years old  and  has  been  married  since  August  1982.  He  has  an
adult son and daughter and two adult stepdaughters. He earned an associate’s degree in

charged  with  Criminal  Sexual  Assault  of  a  Family  Member  and  Aggravated  Criminal
Sexual Assault of  a victim  less than 13  years  of  age. In his January 8,  2020 Personal
Subject Interview (PSI), he explained that once he started the abuse he  could not stop
and needed to be arrested. (Item 5.) He pleaded guilty on October 26, 1992. (Item 7 at
3.) In his Answer, he admitted that he was arrested and charged, as alleged. He admitted
that he was placed on four years of probation, He also admitted that he served four years
of probation and never missed a meeting with his probation officer. He registered as a
child sex offender for 10 years and attended mandatory professional counseling sessions
for five years. (Item 3.) On July 15, 1993, the court ordered that Applicant could return to
his marital home to reside with his family (his wife, his then minor son and daughter, and
his two then minor stepdaughters). (Item 7 at 19.)
In his PSI, Applicant explained his understanding of the end of his 10 years of child
sex offender registration. Near the end of that 10 year period (2002 or 2003), he filed his
periodic registration form. The officer who processed the form told him that he no longer
needed  to  register  and  was  no  longer  subject  to  monitoring,  as  a  result  of  his  1992
conviction. (Item 5.)
In his Response to the FORM, Applicant explained two instances when he might
have violated the terms of his 1992 sentence. The first was in 2006 when his son, who is
disabled,  graduated from  high  school.  Applicant  attended  that  graduation  with  his  wife
and family members. He knew at the time that he should have gotten permission from the
court. (Item 5.) The second was an instance (date not stated) when one of his daughters
telephoned and asked if he and his wife could pick up her two sons (his grandsons) from
school. They did so. It is not clear on this record that this latter instance violated the terms
of his sentence. He volunteered those instances to the OPM investigator to be “open and
honest.” (Response.)
The 2019 Offense
Under  AG  D,  the  SOR  alleged  that  in  March  2019  Applicant  was  arrested  and
charged  with  a  misdemeanor  of  being  as  Child  Sex  Offender  Unlawfully  Present  in  a
Public Park. On May 23, 2019, Applicant pleaded guilty to that charge and was placed on
12 months court supervision until May 22, 2020. (Item 1.) Applicant admitted that he was
arrested and charged, as alleged. (Item 3.) Applicant was found guilty and sentenced to
one year of court supervision and fined for fees and costs totaling $1,247. His sentence
was satisfied on September 16, 2020. (Item 9.)
Applicant did not know it was illegal for him to enter a public park for a walk with
an adult companion. He had not yet exited his car when arrested. He did not knowingly
or  willfully  violate  the  law.  (Item  3.)  Applicant  pleaded  guilty  on  advice  of  counsel.  He
questioned, however, whether the law applied to him, because it was passed in 2012,
years after his 1992 offense. There were no children in the park at the time of his arrest,
which is required by the current law. The Arrest Report did not note that children were
present then. (Items 3, 5, 8, and 10.) Nonetheless, he pleaded guilty because at the time
he “was in the process of a Federal Background Investigation [for a security clearance]
and did not want that to get affected.” (Item 5.)
In his PSI, Applicant explained his understanding of the end of his 10 years of child
sex offender registration. Near the end of that 10 year period (2002 or 2003), he filed his
periodic registration form. The officer who processed the form told him that he no longer
needed  to  register  and  was  no  longer  subject  to  monitoring,  as  a  result  of  his  1992
conviction. (Item 5.)
In his Response to the FORM, Applicant explained two instances when he might
have violated the terms of his 1992 sentence. The first was in 2006 when his son, who is
disabled,  graduated from  high  school.  Applicant  attended  that  graduation  with  his  wife
and family members. He knew at the time that he should have gotten permission from the
court. (Item 5.)
The  second  was  an  instance  (date  not  stated)  when  one  of  his  daughters
telephoned and asked if he and his wife could pick up her two sons (his grandsons) from
school. They did so. The specific location where he and his wife picked up the grandsons
is not stated. Therefore, it is not clear on this record that this latter instance violated the
terms  of  his  sentence.  He  volunteered  those  instances  to  the  OPM  investigator  to  be
“open and honest.” (Response.)
Under AG J, the SOR cross-alleged the allegations made under AG D. Applicant’s
admissions and denials to AG D are incorporated herein by reference.
",True
"In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  denied  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  1.b,  and  2.b.  He
admitted SOR ¶ 2.a. He did not answer the cross-allegations at SOR ¶¶ 3.a and 4.a. He
included  a  brief  narrative  statement  with  his  answer.  Applicant’s  admission
is
incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 47 years old. He was married from 1999 until August 2013, when he
and  his  wife  divorced.  They  have  four  children,  all  born  between  1999  and  2005.
Applicant  has been  employed  in the defense  industry since  about 2007,  in  the field  of
logistics. He has worked for his current employer since August 2018. (Item 3)
On his June 2019 SCA, Applicant disclosed prior U.S. Government background
investigations in 2007 and 2012. He also disclosed that, in about January 2018, he had
a  security  clearance  eligibility  or  access  authorization  denied,  suspended,  or  revoked,
by an AGA. He reported that he had held a clearance without incident since 2007, but
that  the  AGA  had  revoked  his  access  to  a  particular  facility,  following  an  inconclusive
polygraph result. (Item 3 at 38-39)
Government  Item  4  is  a  Clearance  Decision  Statement  (CDS)  from  the  AGA,
dated  May  9,  2018.  The  CDS  notes  as  background  that  Applicant  had  held  access  to
sensitive compartmented information (SCI) since March 2008 through AGA 1, and then
was  indoctrinated  for  SCI  access  with  AGA  2  in  September  2014,  pending  final
adjudication. (Item 4 at 1)
Applicant  was  interviewed   by   AGA   2   counterintelligence   representatives  in
September  2014   and   January   2015   without  incident.   (Item   4   at  1)  During   a   third
interview, in February 2015, he revealed  the  following  security-significant information:
   Applicant advised  that  he  solicited  and  paid  a  prostitute  for  oral sex  three
times, once  in the  early  2000s, once  in 2009  or 2010, and  once   in spring
2013.  On   each   occasion,  he   went  to   an  area   known   to  be  frequented  by
prostitutes. A female approached his car at  a stop  light and  he  allowed  her
to   get   in.   They   drove   to   an   alley   and   she   performed   oral   sex   on   him,   for
which he paid  $20. (Item 4 at 2)  (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 3.a, 4.a)
   Applicant reported  a  history  of  excessive  alcohol consumption. His alcohol
consumption   was  moderate   until  2011   or  2012,  when   it  increased
significantly   after  he   learned   of  his  wife’s  infidelity.  He   would  become
intoxicated  twice weekly by  drinking  whiskey  and  vodka. On  one  instance
in winter 2012,  he passed out  on the  street in front  of his house. He  awoke
in bed after someone  helped him inside. (Item 4 at 2)  (SOR ¶¶ 2.b, 4.a)
   Applicant  also   acknowledged   that   on  five   or six   occasions  between   1990
(when   he   was  underage)  and   2014,  he   operated   a   motor  vehicle   while
knowingly  intoxicated. On  two  occasions in December 2014, he  consumed
whiskey  while driving. (Item 4  at 2)  (SOR ¶¶  2.a, 3.a, 4.a)
Applicant  had  a  fourth  interview in  July  2015.  It  revealed  no  security  significant
information.  He  had  a  fifth  interview  in  December  2018  that  revealed  the  following
information:
   Applicant  reiterated   facts  about  his  prior  solicitations   of  prostitutes,   as
discussed   above,  and   added   that  he   had   consumed   alcohol  in  his  car,
while   driving,   prior  to   the   2013   solicitation.   He  also  disclosed   that  he
similarly  solicited  and  paid a  prostitute  for oral sex, once  in 2015,  twice in
May  or June  2017, and  once  in July  2017, under similar circumstances to
those   as   previously   described   during   his  third   interview.  (Item   4   at  3-4)
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 3.a, 4.a)
   Applicant  also   acknowledged   searching   for  prostitutes  on   the   internet  in
January,  August,   October,   and   November  2017.  On   one   occasion,   he
exchanged one text message  with someone, but had second thoughts and
did not  follow through. (Item  4 at 3-4)  (SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 4.a)
   Applicant  said  he   had   not  consumed  alcohol to   intoxication   since  August
2013, and  had  not driven  while  impaired  by  alcohol since  December  2014,
when   he   drove   after  consuming   one   mixed   drink.  His  alcohol  use   since
August 2013 had remained consistent and “extremely light.” (Item  4  at 4)
AGA  1  subsequently  rescinded  Applicant’s  classified  access  and  he  was
debriefed in September 2017. (Item 4 at 1) A sixth interview, in February 2018, revealed
no information of significance. (Item 4 at 4)
As  part  of  an  interrogatory  from  DOHA,  Applicant  was  given  the  opportunity  to
review,  correct,  and  adopt  as  accurate  the  summaries  of  his  interviews  with  the  AGA
investigators,  discussed  above.  In  his  December  2021  response,  Applicant  affirmed
their accuracy without further comment. (Item 5)
Applicant  also  affirmed  the  accuracy  of  the  summary  of  a  security  clearance
background interview he had in September 2019  following his June 2019 SCA with an
agent  of  the  U.S.  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (OPM).  During  that  interview,  he
discussed  the  fact  that  he  was  subject  to  two  polygraph  interviews  with  the  AGA.  He
asserted  that  he  was  told  that  one  of  the  interviews  was  inconclusive,  and  that  he
passed  the  other  one.  He  acknowledged  that,  in  January  2018,  he  was  told  that  the
AGA had revoked his access.  Unlike in his interviews  with the AGA, in his September
2019 OPM interview, Applicant did not address his prior engagement with prostitutes or
his history of alcohol involvement. (Item 5 at 8)
In  his  December  2021  interrogatory  response,  Applicant  provided  updated
information about his alcohol consumption. He said he no longer consumed alcohol and
did not intend to do so in the future. He said the last time he drank to intoxication was
“years ago” after he  learned  of  his wife’s infidelity. He could  not recall  the  last  time  he
drove under the influence of  alcohol. He  denied having been charged with any DUI or
DWI offenses and none were revealed elsewhere in the record.  Applicant also said he
had not solicited or engaged in sexual acts with a prostitute since July 2017. (Item 5)
Under  Guideline  D,  Applicant  denied  SOR  ¶  1.a,  which  alleged  that  between
2010 and July 2017, he engaged in sexual activity with prostitutes while granted access
to classified information. He also denied SOR ¶ 1.b, which alleged that during 2017, he
searched internet personal ads for prostitutes on multiple occasions. (Item 2)
Under  Guideline  G,  Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶  2.a,  which  alleged  that,  from
summer  2014  to  December  2014,  he  drove  on  multiple  occasions  while  under  the
influence of alcohol, and while consuming alcohol. He denied SOR ¶ 2.b, which alleged
that  from  late  2011  to  about  September  2013,  he  drank  alcohol  to  intoxication  about
twice a week, and that once in 2012, he was so intoxicated that he passed out on the
street  in  front  of  his  home.  (Item  2)  Applicant  did  not  answer  the  cross-allegations,
under Guidelines J and E. (Item 2)
Applicant  offered  no  explanation  or  specifics in  answering  the  SOR  allegations,
except the following statement:
This   was  coerced   by   the   polygrapher.  What   I  did  do   was  from   the   past
where  I  made   mistakes  like   any   human   being.  I  had   something   serious
the   gentleman   who   was  very
to
going   on,  which
I   explained
unprofessional.  I   DO   NOT  request   a   hearing.  (Item   2)  (Emphasis  in
original)
Applicant did not elaborate and did not respond  to  the  Government’s FORM, so
he provided no additional information in mitigation.
",False
"Applicant admitted to all the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful
review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  56-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  (GX 1  at  page  7.)
He  has  been  employed  with  the  defense  contractor  since  August  20,  2020.  (AppX  I.)
Applicant is married, but separated from his current spouse, and has two children. (GX
1 at pages 18~19, and 22~23.) He served in the Marine Corps as an enlisted member,
and was honorably discharged. (TR at page 15 lines 9~20.)
Guideline   M   -  Use   of  Information  Technology,   Guideline   D   -  Sexual  Behavior   &
Guideline E  - Personal Conduct
1.a.,  2.a.  and  3.a.  Applicant  admits  that  beginning  in  at  least  January  2018,  he
used  his  Government-Issued  computer  to  store  and  view  images  containing  sexually
explicit,  sexually  orientated,  and/or  inappropriate  content.  (TR  at  page  17  line  12  to
page  23  line  17.) As a  result  of  this,  on  June  3,  2019,  Applicant was  suspended  from
duty and pay for 14 days, for Misuse of a Government Computer.  (TR at page 34 line 8
to page 35 line 2.) He was further advised that any further misconduct may result in a
more severe disciplinary action. (GX 3.)
1.b., 2.a. and 3.a. Applicant admits that from July 2019 to at least April 2020, he
again  used  his  Government  computer  to  store  and  view  images  containing  sexually
explicit,  sexually  orientated,  and/or  inappropriate  content.  (TR  at  page  24  line  16  to
page  31  line  6.)  As  a  result  of  this  misconduct,  on  June  16,  2020,  Applicant  was
terminated  from  his  place  of  employment,  and  thereby  removed  from  Federal  service.
(GXs 6~9.)
Most  recently,  in  September  of  2022,  a  Doctor  of  Psychology  determined
Applicant  to  be  suffering  from  “compulsive  behavior,”  but  not  from  a  “compulsive
disorder.”  She also averred, in part, the following: “I feel his lapse in judgment was the
product of severe and atypical psychosocial stressors the specific nature of which he is
unlikely  to  again  experience.”  The  Doctor  further  averred:  “the  preponderance  of  the
evidence in this case suggests that . . . [Applicant] is a reliable, ethical, and trustworthy
employee.” (AppX M.)
",False
"Applicant  is  a   57-year-old  married   man   with   two   adult  children   from   a   previous
marriage.  He  earned   a   bachelor’s  degree  in 2008, and  in 2010, he  earned  a  master’s
degree  in the  field  of  conflict management.  (Tr. 15) Applicant is a  veteran  of the  U.S.  Army.
He served  on  active  duty  from  1984  to  1989. After leaving  activity  duty, he  affiliated with
the  Army  Reserve  where he  served  from  1989  to  2019. He retired  honorably. (GE 1  at 20)
Applicant is a logistics management specialist. He has been working for his current
employer  since  January  2020.  (GE  1  at  13)  He  worked  with  his  previous  employer,  a
military command, performing similar work from 2015 to 2019. (GE 3)
In   January   2016,  Applicant  went  on   temporary   travel  duty   (TDY)   with   a   female
military  officer who  was superior to  him  on  the  unit’s organization  chart. (GE 3  at 3) It  was
not uncommon  for coworkers to  eat  dinner together while  on TDY. One  night,  while  at
dinner with  the  officer, Applicant told her that if  she  was not married, “[he] would be  all  over
[her],” and  that “what happens [on  TDY],  stays [on  TDY].” (GE 3  at 3) She  rebuffed  his
advances   and   did  not  immediately   report it  until some   time   later,   when   her supervisor
asked   her  to   accompany   Applicant  to   another  TDY   assignment.    (GE  4   at  3)  The
coworker’s supervisor then  reported  the  allegation  to  the  unit commander that same  day.
(GE 4  at 3) Subsequently, the  unit commander appointed  an  investigator to  conduct a
preliminary   inquiry   into   the   allegations.  During   the   investigation,  two   additional  female
coworkers alleged  that  Applicant  had made  unwelcome  sexual  advances  toward  them.  (GE
4  at 4) One  of  the  sexual advances occurred  between  2016  and  2017  via the  following  e-
mail exchange:
Applicant:  So  how many do  you  have  in  your stables?  LOL Very curious
about you.
Coworker: NUNYA [None of your business]
Applicant: So no room for anyone? Let me know when you have some free
space. (GE 3 at 4; GE 4 at 9))
Two  of  the  women  noted  that Applicant’s relationship with  them  became  tense,
confrontational, and intimidating after they rejected his advances. For example, one of the
women stated that on one occasion, he intentionally bumped into her while walking by her
in the hallway. (GE 3 at 5)
The investigator concluded that the allegations were substantiated, but did not rise
to  the  level  of  sexual  harassment.  Moreover,  he  recommended  that  Applicant  attend
trainings on sexual harassment, conflict and anger management skills, and professionalism
in the workplace and on travel. (GE 4 at 5)
The woman that Applicant propositioned while on TDY stated that her relationship
with him continued to deteriorate after the investigator released his report. (GE 4 at 5) Her
continued complaints prompted their supervisor, in July 2018, to initiate a hostile work
environment  inquiry  into  Applicant’s  behavior. (GE 4 at 5)  The investigator took sworn
statements from Applicant, the coworker that Applicant propositioned on TDY, three other
employees, and a contractor. All of the people interviewed stated that Applicant’s behavior
created a tense work environment. In addition, the contractor accused Applicant of flirting
with her and rubbing himself against the back of her chair while she was seated in it. As
with the other woman who had reported such behavior earlier, he became hostile when she
rebuffed his advances, at one point yelling at  her to  “get her ass”  up from her chair to
perform a task for him. (GE 4 at 6)
While  the  investigation  was  ongoing,  a  coworker,  who  was  not  involved  in  the
ongoing in-house harassment investigation, filed a complaint with the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission (EEO) against Applicant, alleging sexual harassment. (GE 4 at 8)
In the complaint, the employee stated that Applicant remarked on her looks, rubbed her
shoulders on one occasion, and frequently asked her out. (GE 4 at 9)
The EEO complaint prompted the unit commander, in November 2018, to expand
the investigation. (GE 4 at 8) Per the expanded investigation, the investigator asked all of
the command’s employees and  contractors if  they had  seen  or experienced  workplace
sexual harassment from Applicant. (GE 4 at 9) In response, several more women came
forward to complain of sexual advances or inappropriate comments, including a woman
who was the command’s special victim counsel on sexual harassment, and several women
in subordinate positions (GE 3 at 8; GE 4 at 10) All of them prepared sworn statements. In
addition  to  the  women  who  alleged  sexual harassment,  a coworker who witnessed an
episode of inappropriate conduct provided a statement. (GE 4 at 11)
On  November  14,  2018,  Applicant  issued  a  sworn  statement,  as  part  of  the
expanded  investigation.  (GE  at  11)  During  the  ISCR  hearing,  he  testified  that  he  was
unaware that he had been under investigation for sexual harassment until he received a
notice of termination in June 2019. (Tr. 19)
During the  November 2018  investigation,  Applicant  denied  all of  the allegations
except the allegation based on the email exchange, as set forth above. He characterized
the email conversation as a continuation of harmless “banter” that the coworker initiated.
(Tr. 53) He stated that his superiors never wanted him in his position from the day he
started  because  he  “wouldn’t  conform  to  what they  wanted  [him] to  do,”  and that their
allegations against him were part of a conspiracy to replace him with someone whom they
desired. (GE 2 at 7; Tr. 41) As for the women in subordinate grade levels, he contended
that they resented him because he was a stern, sometimes abrasive taskmaster who was
holding them accountable. (GE 3 at 11, 17)
In December 2018, the investigator issued a memorandum entitled “Supplemental
Findings and Recommendations.”  (GE 4 at 11) He found  that Applicant’s denial of  the
allegations  was  “dramatically”  outweighed  by  the  cumulative,  contrary  testimony,  and
“entirely unconvincing.” (GE 4 at 11) The investigator concluded that Applicant’s conduct
created a hostile work environment, and recommended that he be suspended for seven
days. (GE 4 at 11)
In  January  2019,  the  unit  commander  issued  a  memorandum  regarding  the
investigator’s conclusion. (GE 4 at 11) He approved the findings, but concluded that they
merited termination, rather than suspension. (GE 4 at 12) In reaching this conclusion, he
noted that Applicant’s “failure to accept even the smallest responsibility for  [his] actions
was troubling,” that rehabilitation “does not appear viable,” and that Applicant “[could] not
be  trusted  to  be  alone  with  subordinate  personnel.”  (GE  3  at  11)  Consequently,  the
commander  issued  a  notice  of  decision  of  proposed  removal.  (GE  4  at  15)  Applicant
presented an oral reply to the proposal, together with several character reference letters.
(GE 4 at 16) In October 2019, the command executive officer sustained the proposed
removal.  In  doing  so,  he  found  that  Applicant’s  “misconduct  eroded  the  chain  of
command’s trust and  confidence,”  and  that his “lack of  ownership  over his actions . . .
combined  with  the  pervasiveness  of  the  misbehavior  are  clear  indicators  of  a  lack  of
rehabilitation potential.” (GE 3 at 10) Moreover, he concluded that Applicant’s credibility
was degraded by numerous inconsistencies in his reply. (GE 3 at 11) In October 2019, the
commander issued a decision letter officially removing Applicant from the job.
Applicant appealed the decision to the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB)
After considering  Applicant’s  testimony and  the  sworn statements of  his accusers,  the
MSPB, in July 2020, affirmed the decision. In doing so, the judge noted four times in the
decision that Applicant was not credible. (GE 4 at 18-20, 37)
At  the  MSPB  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  his conduct,  at  worst,  was  merely
flirtatious,  and  that  flirting  was  human  nature.  (GE  4  at  26)  Between  2016  and  2019,
Applicant completed multiple trainings on sexual harassment in the workplace. (GE 4 at 10)
At  the  ISCR  hearing,  Applicant  reiterated  the  positions  he  took  during the  work
investigation and the MSPB hearing. Also, he testified that he was a good, well-respected
employee at the job from which he was terminated in 2019, and provided records, including
multiple character references and good annual evaluations. (AE A – AE Q)

"Applicant is a 34-year-old new employee of a defense contractor. His start date
was  scheduled  to be  in  January 2023. He  worked for a different  defense  contractor in
2022. He served on active duty in the U.S. military from 2012  until he was discharged
with an under other than honorable conditions discharge in 2021. He seeks to retain a
security clearance, which he has held since his time in the military. He has a bachelor’s
degree  earned  in  2010,  and  he  has  taken  graduate  courses  in  pursuit  of  a  master’s
degree.  He  is  married  with  two  children.  (Transcript  (Tr.)  at  7-8,  22-28;  Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 1, 4, 5; AE G)
Applicant deployed to Afghanistan for about nine months in 2016 through 2017.
He  was  stationed  in  a  foreign  country  from  2017  until  his  discharge.  From  that  duty
station, he deployed to another foreign country in 2018. The multiple deployments and
overseas tour led to marital stress. In January to February 2019, he was on temporary
duty  at  a  military  installation  in  State  A  in  the  United  States.  While  there,  he  met  an
individual  online  who  identified  “herself”  on  multiple  occasions  as  a  13-year-old  girl.  It
was  actually  a  police  officer  from  State  A  running  a  sting  operation  to  catch  potential
child predators. (I will refer to the individual with feminine pronouns even though it was
actually  a  male.)  Applicant  and  the  individual  engaged  in  a  series  of  graphic  sexual

sexual  communications  with  the  individual  who  identified  herself  as  a  13-year-old  girl.
He  sent  a  video  of  himself  masturbating  and  two  photographs  of  his  penis.  He
requested that she send him sexually explicit images of herself, which, if she was truly
an  underage  girl,  would  have  been  child  pornography  under  18  U.S.C.  §§  2252  and
2256. He stated that he wanted to perform sexual acts on her, and he planned to travel
to State A to do so. (Tr. at 39-42; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 5; AE H)
A  military  criminal  investigation  was  initiated  in  April  2019  based  upon  a  report
from  State  A  law  enforcement.  Applicant  waived  his  right  to  remain  silent  and  was
interviewed. He admitted that he exchanged sexual messages with a female who lived
in State A, and that he was aware that she was 13 to 15 years old. He explained that he
did not believe everything on the Internet, “nothing’s real,” and that it would be weird for
a 13-year-old to be on the Internet actively participating in their interactions like she did.
He  admitted  that  they discussed  things  that  he  would  like  to  do  to  her,  but  he  had  no
intention of actually doing anything. He also admitted that he sent her a video of himself
in which he was naked. (Tr. at 45; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 5; AE H)
A forensic examination was conducted of Applicant’s cell phone. It was reported
that  “[a]n  image  of  suspected  child  pornography  was  located,  but  appeared  to  be
associated  with  malicious  software,  as  no  additional  indications  were  found  [that]  the
user intentionally searched for, or possessed child pornography.” (GE 5; AE F)
Applicant  was  charged  in  November  2020  with  multiple  offenses  under  the
Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), including three specifications of attempting to
commit  lewd  acts  on  a  child  under  the  age  of  16;  soliciting  the  detective  to  send  him
images  of  child  pornography;  and  possessing  child  pornography.  The  charges  were
referred to a general court-martial in February 2021. (Tr. at 43; Applicant’s response to
SOR; GE 5; AE F)
Applicant requested an under other than honorable conditions discharge in lieu of
trial by  court-martial.  In  his request,  he  admitted  that  he  was  “guilty  of  one  or more  of
the specifications against [him] or of a lesser-included offense contained therein which
also  authorizes  the  imposition  of  a  bad  conduct  discharge  or dishonorable discharge.”
The request was approved, and he was discharged in April 2021. (Tr. at 48-49, 66-67;
Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 5)
Applicant responded to interrogatories in February 2022. He answered  “True” to
the  following  statement,  “Between  February  and  April  2019  you  admitted  you
exchanged messages, photos and a video (all sexual in nature) with an individual whom
you believed to be a female between the age of 13 and 15 years old residing in [State
A].” He added, “All information above is correct. I did exchange photos and video with a
person I thought to be a female.” (GE 5)
Applicant testified that he went on the Internet for adult companionship, and that
he was not looking for an underage girl. He stated that people lie about their age on the
Internet, as he did, and he assumed that the “girl” was lying. He asserted that he had no
intention  of  meeting  her.  He  denied  ever  possessing  child  pornography.  (Tr.  at  37-44,
53, 62, 66-69)
Applicant  expressed  remorse  for his conduct. His wife  is aware  of his  actions, the
charges  against  him, and  his discharge. Many of  his friends  are  aware  of  the  charges.
The  defense  company  that previously  hired  him  and  the  company   for which  he  was to
start  work   in   January  2023   are   unaware   that  he   was   discharged   with   an   under  other
than   honorable   discharge. Applicant   stated   that   he   was   never asked  by his employers
about  his  discharge,  and   he   believes  they   would  have   hired   him   anyway.   He   sought
counseling from a  chaplain  while  he  was  still on active  duty.  He has since had  additional
therapy,  which   is  ongoing.   His  therapist  wrote   that  it   was  evident  that  Applicant  “was
remorseful for the  past  incident and  has  been  making  great effort  to  move  forward  with
improving   his  marriage   and   family  life.”    Applicant   considers   himself  completely
rehabilitated,  and  he  assured  that similar conduct would never recur. (Tr. at 46-47, 49-
55, 62-65, 67-68; Applicant’s response to SOR; AE K)
Applicant  was  evaluated  at  his  own  expense  in  July  2022  by  a  licensed
psychologist  with  extensive  experience  in  forensic  and  clinical  psychology.  A  report of
the evaluation was issued in August 2022. The psychologist determined that Applicant
did not have a mental health condition. He concluded that Applicant’s “illegal actions are
not, in fact, a sign of moral turpitude or any aberrant sexual impulses.” He accepted that
Applicant  was  not  seeking  an  underage  partner  when  he  entered  the  chat  room,  and
that Applicant presumed the person was lying about her age. (Tr. at 71-86; AE J, K) The
psychologist concluded:
[Applicant’s]  encounter  with  this purported  young  teenager was impulsive,
rather than  planned.  [Applicant]  has since  experienced  the  consequences
of  his  behavior.  To   a   great   degree   of   psychological   certainty,   I  have
concluded   that  [Applicant]   is rehabilitated   and   will   never again  engage   in
such   foolish   behavior.  [Applicant’s]   behavior  was  not   part  of  any
compulsion.   There  is  no   known  reason   to   expect   that  such   behavior  is
something   that  [Applicant]   is  motivated   to   repeat  or  has  any  particular
interest in doing.
In   sum,  I  have   concluded   that  [Applicant]   has  learned   from   his  mistake,
has  benefitted   from   the   consequences   he   experienced   and   from   the
psychotherapy  that   he   received,   and   that   this  behavior   will   not  recur.   I
consider  [Applicant]   to   have   been   rehabilitated   and   to   be   currently  fit  to
hold a  security clearance.  (AE  I)
Applicant  submitted  documents  and  letters  attesting  to  his  excellent  military
service,  job  performance,  and  moral  character.  He  was  described  as  “an  exemplary
Soldier.”  He
leadership,  dedication,  work  ethic,  honesty,
trustworthiness,  professionalism,  humility,  reliability,  judgment,  proficiency,  generosity,
compassion,  empathy,  maturity,  and  integrity.  He  received  numerous  medals  and

"Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a government contractor for whom he has

He has two children, ages 19 and 17. He earned a high school diploma in 1994. He has

In   April  and   May  2018,  while  working   at  the   DOD  Inspector  General  (DOD  IG)
Hotline  Center, on  two  separate  occasions, Applicant  used  his cell  phone  to  take  under-
the-dress photographs  of two  of his female colleagues  (collectively the  “victims”)  without
their   knowledge   or  consent.   One   of  the   victims   notified   the   U.S.  Naval  Criminal
Investigative   Service   (NCIS),  which   opened   an   investigation   into   the   incident.   Based
upon  the  NCIS  investigation, the  Navy charged  him  under the  Uniform  Code  of Military
Justice   (UCMJ)  Article  120c  (other   sexual  misconduct:   indecent  viewing,   visual
recording,  or  broadcasting).   In   2019,  after  a   court-martial,   he   pleaded   guilty   and   was
convicted  of this charge.  He was sentenced  to  eight months confinement  and  reduction
in rank. He was  released  with  a  bad-conduct  discharge.  In SOR ¶  1.a, the  Government
alleged  Applicant’s 2018  behavior  in  taking the  photographs. In SOR ¶  2.a,  it alleged  his
conviction   and   sentence   pursuant   to   UCMJ  Article  120c.   It   also   alleged   a   violation   of
UCMJ  Article  92,  failure  to   obey  an  order  or  regulation   charge   and   conviction   and   his
bad-conduct discharge  in SOR ¶  2.a.  In  the  Answer, Applicant admitted  the  allegations
in  SOR ¶¶  1.a  and  2.a. His  admissions are adopted  as findings of  fact.  Other than  his
admission,  there  is  no   evidence   of  a   2019   UCMJ  Article   92   charge   or  conviction.   (Tr.

Applicant claimed that he was going through a bad time between 2015 and 2018.
He  claimed  he  and  his  wife  were  having  marital  problems.  He  claimed  he  was
dissatisfied with his job and did not want to be there. He claimed that there was nothing
sexual about the pictures he took, but that he was acting out to get caught. He thought
that  if  he  got  in  trouble,  the  Navy  would  move  him  to  a  different  role.  He  was  having
trouble  with  his  life  and  did  not  know  how  to  handle  it.  He  claimed  his  time  in
confinement gave him clarity and he is now in a better  place. He claimed that he took
“multiple  hours”  of  behavioral  counseling  where  he  learned  that  he  had post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD) and depression. He did not specify the dates of his counseling
sessions. He did not provide documentation related to this counseling, a diagnosis, or a
prognosis.  He claimed that he now understands how to  appropriately deal with  stress,
and that he will not engage in this type of behavior again. (Tr. 18-21; Answer)
Sometime  in  the  summer  of  2017,  Applicant  filmed  his  wife  while  she  was
unclothed  in  her  bedroom  without  her  knowledge  or  consent.  He  used  an  iPad  and
filmed  her  through  the  crack  between  her bedroom  door and  the  floor.  He  claimed  he
was  trying  to  catch  her  being  unfaithful  because  he  suspected  she  was  with  another
man. Any adverse information not alleged in the SOR, such as Applicant filming his wife
without her knowledge or consent, will not be considered for disqualification purposes;
however,  it  may  be  considered  in  assessing an  applicant’s  credibility;  in  evaluating  an
in
applicant’s  evidence  of  extenuation,  mitigation,  or  changed  circumstances;
considering  whether  the  applicant  has  demonstrated  successful  rehabilitation;  and  in
applying the whole-person concept. (ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 16,
2017)). (Tr. 32-35; GE 2)
In  about  April  2018,  Applicant  was  counseled  at  work  for  making  inappropriate
comments  to  a  female  colleague  regarding  her  appearance.  His  inappropriate
comments  made  his  female  colleague  feel  uncomfortable,  so  she  filed  a  complaint
against  him.  Applicant’s  supervisor  told  him  that  he  would  be  reassigned  if  anything
similar  happened  again.  The  Government  did  not  allege  this  information  in  the  SOR.
(GE 2)
While  Applicant  claimed  to  be  remorseful  for  his  actions,  he  also  deflected  the
blame and responsibility for his actions to others. He claimed the court-martial process
was  unfair  as  he  was not  allowed  to  tell  his side  of  the  story. He  claimed  that  he  had
been  caught  up  in  the  “Me  Too”  movement  and  was  judged  more  harshly  than
appropriate  because  of  the  timing  of  his  offenses.  He  claimed  that  the  victims  were
coerced  into  requesting  that  he  receive  a  harsher sentence  than  they  otherwise  might
have.  He  also  claimed  that  he  would  not  receive  a  fair  outcome  from  his  security
clearance adjudication. In short, he casts himself as the victim and has not  fully taken
responsibility for his illegal actions. (Answer; AE A)
In the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant’s six delinquent financial accounts
totaling  approximately  $29,000  (SOR  ¶¶  3.a  through  3.f).  Applicant  admitted  the  SOR

Applicant  claimed  that  he  made  a  payment  of  about  $4,000  toward  these  judgments
sometime  in  2022.  He  also  claimed  that  he  is  paying  a  little  bit  extra  towards  these
obligations every month. He provided no documentation to corroborate these payments.
He  is  unsure  how  he  fell  behind  on  payments  to  his  homeowner’s  association  but
suspected his wife was supposed to pay this obligation and failed to do so. He claimed
he will continue to pay a little extra every month until these judgments are resolved. (Tr.

The  delinquent  car  loan  in  the  amount  of  $6,499  alleged  in  SOR  ¶  3.c  has  not

He  claimed  his  wife  was  supposed  to  make  payments  on  this  loan  while  he  was
incarcerated but she did not. However, in his November 2020 security interview, he also
claimed  that  he  did  not  want  the  car  any  longer.  He  claimed  that  he  made  payments
again  once  he  was  no  longer  incarcerated,  but  he  was  not  able  to  catch  up  on  his
delinquency.  He  claimed  that  he  will  pay  this  account  through  payment  arrangements
when  he  is  able  to  do  so.  The  2023  credit  report  reflects  a  last  payment  date  of
February 2020. He provided no documentation about the resolution of this debt. (Tr. 20,

The delinquent credit card in the amount of $2,927 alleged in SOR ¶ 3.d has not

with the credit reporting agencies several times. The account was opened in September
2015. He claimed that his wife had power of attorney for him while he was deployed and
may  have  opened  it  without  his  knowledge.  The  last  time  he  deployed  was  between
February  and  October  2014.  He  did  not  provide  documentation  to  corroborate  his
disputes  with  the  credit  reporting  agencies  or  the  creditor,  nor  did  he  offer  any  other
resolution  of  this  debt.  The  Government’s  2020,  2021,  and  2023  credit  reports  do  not
reflect  a  dispute  with  respect  to  this  account.  This  account  appears  on  all  three  credit

been resolved. Applicant claimed that he took out this loan to purchase a car for his wife
because she could not afford to pay for it herself. He opened the account in April 2017
and last made a payment on it in July 2019. He claimed that he did not know the loan
was  delinquent  because  his  wife  was  receiving  the  statements  for  it.  He  also  claimed
that he could not afford to pay for the vehicle, but he agreed to open the account for his
wife  as  an  act  of  kindness.  He  claimed  that  he  will  pay  this  account  through  payment
arrangements when he is able to do so. (Tr. 20, 44-45, 60-61; Answer; GE 4-7)
The  delinquent  telecommunications  account  in  the  amount  of  $2,027  alleged  in
SOR ¶ 3.f has been resolved. Applicant claimed that he did not open this account. He
claimed  that  he  disputed  it  with  the  credit  reporting  agencies.  Although  he  did  not
provide  documentation  to  corroborate  his  dispute,  the  debt  no  longer  appears  on  his
2023 credit report. While this account’s absence on a subsequent credit report could be
for  reasons  other  than  a  favorable  resolution,  his  claimed  dispute,  combined  with  the
absence of the account on a subsequent credit report, provide sufficient evidence of a
favorable resolution. (Tr. 20, 45-47, 58-59)
Applicant  owes  the  IRS  about  $900  in  delinquent  federal  income  taxes  for  the
2018  tax  year.  He  owed  about  $3,000  until  2022,  when  he  made  a  payment  of  about
$2,100. These delinquent federal taxes were not alleged in the SOR. (Tr. 47-48)

the 16-30 hours per week he worked. He claimed that he has about $4,000 combined in
his  checking  and  savings  account.  He  provided  no  documentation  to  corroborate  his

Applicant  is  a  49-year-old  aviation  mechanic  employed  by  a  defense  contractor
since July 2005. (Item 2 at 7, 13.) He has held a security clearance since 2008. (Item 2

April  2017  arrest and charge  of  possession  of  marijuana  (SOR ¶¶  1.a, 2.a, 4.a
and 4.c). Applicant admitted in his Answer to being arrested and charged with possession
of  marijuana.  In  his  SCA  he  admitted  to  pleading  guilty  to  possession  of  a  controlled
substance and noted that the possession of marijuana charge was dropped. He stated in
his SCA that “there is a plea of guilty as I was not allowed to plead no contest.” (Item 2 at
27-28.) He was sentenced to 18 months of community supervision, to participate in 50
hours of community service, and pay a fine of $968. (Item 2 at 26, 27, 28, and  29.) He
stated in his background interview he did not know the entirety of what he was charged
with  possessing  but  then  admitted  he  pled  guilty  because  he  was  advised  he  was
fortunate to not have a felony charge. (Item 3 at 5-6.) He states in his SCA this charge
was false and the person who accused him of sexual assault could not recant this offense
because they could risk being charged with a crime. (Item 2 at 37.)
April   2017   use   and/or  possession  of   marijuana   with   vary   frequency   while
granted access   to   classified information   (SOR  ¶¶ 1.b, 4.a).
Applicant pled guilty  to
possession of marijuana in his residence. (Item 2 at 9.) The police recovered a bag of
marijuana  in  plain  view,  along  with  a  water  bong in  the  master  bedroom.  The  police
recovered a vaporizer bong hidden behind a closed master bathroom door. (Item 4 at 57.)
The police deployed a trained narcotics dog who alerted in several areas of the home and
Applicant’s  vehicle.  (Item  4  at  16,  57.)  The  police  recovered  marijuana  in  the  kitchen
refrigerator, kitchen freezer, and in a downstairs bedroom. The police also recovered drug
paraphernalia.  Applicant  states  in  an   interrogatory  response   that  “any  and   all
paraphernalia  was isolated  to  back room  where [his girlfriend] was allowed  to  smoke  only
and outside.” (Item  3  at 2.) He  said  he  was not aware  of the marijuana  in  the  refrigerator
until it was reported  to  him. (Item  3  at 2.)  He initially denied  knowledge  of any drugs in his
home  until the  interviewing  agent asked  about the  drugs found  in  plain  view. (Item  3  at
5.)  The  arrest complaint was for a  “State  Jail  Felony” in the  1st  degree  for the  marijuana
seized  in freezer. (Item  4  at 38.) A  second  arrest complaint,  for a  class A  misdemeanor.
was issued  for other forms of  marijuana  found  in the  house. (Item  4  at 40.)  Applicant  was
ordered  as part of his sentence  to  participate  in the  state’s  drug  offender program. (Item
2   at  28.)  During   his background   interview   he   told  the   investigator he   pled   guilty  to   the
misdemeanor charges  in 2018  to  avoid being  charged  with  felony offenses.  (Item  3  at 6.)
He stated  he  passed  his employer’s drug  tests. (Item  at 6.)  He was granted  a  clearance
in July 2011. (Item 2 at 32.)
April  2017  arrest and  charges of  aggravated assault with a  deadly  weapon
and sexual assault.  (SOR ¶  2.b, and, as  to  the  arrest and charge  of  sexual assault,
SOR  ¶   3.a)  Applicant  admitted  to  being  arrested  and  charged  for  the  offenses  of
aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and sexual assault. He denied the underlying
conduct,  noting  that  the  alleged  victim  recanted  her  statement  and  that  the  grand  jury
returned a “No Bill.” (Answer). The alleged victim reported the sexual assault in April 2017
and told the police the incident took place in March 2017. The police officer noted while
taking the statement the alleged victim described an assault with a pistol that had taken
place in January 2017. (Item 4 at 57.) Police recovered two firearms in an upstairs workout
room closet with various magazines as well as a 9mm pistol with one magazine loaded.
(Item 4 at 57-58.) The inventory description lists two locations where the 9mm pistol was
recovered, the vehicle’s side door pocket and the upstairs workout room. (Item 4 at 58.)
The grand jury returned a “No Bill” on both charges. (Item 2 at 28.)
SOR  ¶   4.b:   failed  to   report  [or]  failed  to   fully   disclose   to   Facility   Security
Officer.  Applicant admitted in his Answer and during his background interview he did not
fully  disclose  the  sexual assault  allegation  when  asked.  (Item  3  at 6.)  He  states  in  his
Answer he thought because the security officer was a woman, and by her demeanor, he
was being judged. In his Answer, he admits he did not fully disclose because he did not
know  how  to  explain  to  the  woman  “what  did  not  happen  versus  what  was  already
implied.” In his Answer he states he did call the same day because he knew he needed
to relay what he did not provide and explain why he felt intimidated. He requested a male
security officer be at next meeting. He adds he provided all the information he failed to
provide at the next meeting. During his background interview he told the investigator he
would have reported the additional charges at the correct time had the security official
been a male. (Item 3 at 6.)
SOR ¶  4.c: Failure  to  disclose  April  2017  drug arrest on his  SCA.  Applicant

substance not previously listed, on the basis he had already addressed the April 2017
incident in the SCA. He addressed the conduct in his SCA responses. (Item 2 at 27-28.)
Applicant  did  not  respond  to  the  FORM,  so  he  did  not  provide  any  updated

teenage  children.  He  reported  on  his  SCA  that  he  had  a  clearance  granted  most
recently in about March 2017. (Item 3)
Applicant also disclosed on his June 2021 SCA that in March 2020, his clearance
was  denied,  suspended,  or  revoked  by  another  government  agency  (AGA)  due  to
“engagement in unlawful sexual services on a continuing basis.” (Item 3)
Applicant  gave  additional  details  in  a  subsequent  background  interview,  in
September 2021. He explained that in March 2020, he was preparing to take a security
clearance  polygraph  exam,  and  he  voluntarily  disclosed  that  beginning  in  2012,  he
sought out escort services online. He would make contact and meet the escorts in their
homes,  sometimes  for  massages  and  sometimes  for  sex.  He  said  he  did  this  with
varying frequency, to include weekly up to March 2020, the time of the polygraph. (Item
4 at 10)
(Note:  the  unauthenticated  interview  summary  notes  a  frequency  “varying  from
weekly to one or two  times per month.”  In the  Interrogatory response,  Applicant noted
that this should be “varying from weekly to as long as six months or more.”) (Item 4 at 4)
I interpret this to mean that there were at times gaps of “as long as six months or more”
between his uses of escort services, although Applicant’s wording is not entirely clear).
In the interview summary, Applicant attributed his actions to a lack of intimacy in
his  marriage.  He  said  his  wife  was  unaware  of  his actions  until  March  2020,  when  he
disclosed  it  to  her.  He  said  he  has  not  engaged  in  the  activity  since  March  2020.  He
said  in  the  interview  summary  that  as  a  result,  his  clearance  was  suspended  for  one
year, and was reinstated in March 2021. (Item 4 at 10)
SOR ¶ 1.a alleges (and SOR ¶ 2.a cross-alleges) that Applicant “solicited escorts
for sexual services with varying frequency from approximately 2012 to at least 2020.” In
his SOR response, Applicant crossed out the words “at least” and wrote:
I admit  to  the  Statement of Reasons as Amended  with  the  retraction  of the
phrase   ‘at  least.”   Since   the   revocation   of  my  clearance   in  March   2020,  I
have   discontinued   the   solicitation   of  escorts  for  sexual  services  as
promised  in  a  previous  telephone  conversation. I  will  not further engage  in
said illegal activities. (Item  2)
Applicant did not elaborate. He did not submit any other statement or evidence with his
answer to the SOR and he did not respond to the Government’s FORM, so he provided
no additional information in mitigation.

"Applicant admitted all allegations. His admissions are incorporated in my findings
of fact.
Applicant is 32 years old. He served honorably in the U.S. Marine Corps from April
2011 to June 2015. He has been married twice. He divorced his first spouse in July 2020
after seven years of marriage and married his current spouse in February 2021, but they
are currently separated. (Item 2 at 21-22, 32.) He has no children from his first marriage
and from his current marriage he has two minor-aged stepchildren and a child born of the
marriage in August 2021. (Tr. at 33.)
Applicant has been employed by his sponsor since October 2019 and received a
promotion in April 2021. His initial annual salary was $66,000 and after his promotion it
was $77,000. Prior to joining his employer his annual salary was $44,000. (Tr. at 28-29.)
His first spouse had limited part-time jobs, so he was providing for them on his $44,000
salary.  (Tr.  at  30.)  He  initially  received  a  low  disability  rating  from  the  Department  of
Veterans Affairs (VA), but in late 2020 he was reevaluated, which resulted in higher rating
that increased his monthly disability payments by over $1,600. The increase occurred at
about the time he married his second spouse. (Tr. at 32.)
The  SOR  alleges  six  delinquent  debts  totaling  $38,962,  reflected  in  two  credit
reports from July 2021 (GE 3) and February 2022 (GE 4). Applicant offered a May 2023
credit report that no longer showed the debts alleged in SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c, and 1.f. (AE B.)
He testified he had taken the initiative to call his primary creditor and had gone over his
credit report to look at the debts he and his wife had. He stated he called the financial
institution that held four of the debts, SOR ¶¶ 1.a-1.c, and 1.f, to see what his repayment
options were for the accounts. He explained he would pay what he could and noted he
had paid some debts in full. He offered he would make a budget to address the debts he
could not afford to pay. (Tr. at 40; AE C.) He took out a hardship loan from his 401(k)
retirement account in 2023. At the time of the loan, his 401(k) account held  approximately
$21,000. He withdrew $13,000 to pay medical debts and credit debts. The medical debts
arose from the 2022 birth of his child. (Tr. at 41-43.)
Guideline F
SOR  ¶¶   1.a-1.c,  1.f:   four   accounts   charged  off  in  the   amounts   of   $18,552;
10,739;   $6,493;   and  $1,005,  respectively.  Applicant  admits  the  respective  debts  with
the credit institution. He has not established payment plans for these accounts. The last
payments were in the 2016-2017 period. He and his former spouse were “living beyond
[their] means” and he could not make the payments because of his salary at the time. He
was  aware  of  the  debts  but  had  been  trying  to  resolve  his  smaller  debts  first.  He
acknowledged SOR ¶ 1.f was simply missed. He notes they have all fallen off his credit
report. (Tr. 22-23, 25; AE B.)
SOR ¶¶  1.d-1.e:  student  loans  placed for  collection  in the  amounts  of  $1,137
and  $1,036.   Applicant  admits  the  debts.  He  stated  the  loans  had  been  frozen  by  the
Department of Education (DoEd) during COVID and they were not requesting payment.
He enrolled in the Fresh Start Transfer Program seven days prior to the hearing and was
notified the day before the hearing that a determination was forthcoming. He stated if the
loans  were  not  approved  for  the  Fresh  Start  Transfer  Program  the  two  loans  will  be
renewed with a new lender. He stated he will abide by whatever the repayment plan is
established to pay off the loans. (Tr. at 24; AE-A.)
I have  taken  administrative  notice  that in March  2020, as a  result of the  COVID-19
pandemic, the  President directed  the  DoEd  to  provide  the  following  temporary relief on
DoEd-owned  federal student loans: suspension  of loan  payments,  stopped  collections on
defaulted loans, and a  0% interest rate. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief,
and  Economic Security Act (CARES  Act) provided  for the  above  relief measures through
September 30, 2020. See Federal Student Aid (FSA) website, ISCR Case No. 20-02787
at 3  n.1  (App. Bd. Mar. 2022) This student loan  debt relief was extended  several times by
subsequent Executive  Orders. See  https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-

student loan  repayments will  resume  in October 2023. See  https://studentaid.gov/debt-

Guideline  D
SOR ¶  2.a: This allegation alleges that Applicant was arrested on October 5, 2022,
and  charged  with  Aggravated  Sexual  Battery;  and  that  the  felony  charge  remained
pending. In answering SOR ¶ 2.a in the Amendment to the SOR, he admitted the SOR
allegation and noted that the case remained pending and cited a court date of May 22,
2023,  (Answer  to  SOR  ¶  2.a.)  His  middle  school  aged  stepdaughter  accused  him  of
“inappropriate touching  of her  behind…  and  that  [he]  requested  to  touch  her  privates.”
(Tr.  at  64.)  His  stepdaughter  disclosed  to  police  that  when  she  was  approximately  10
years old, he had sat next to her on a couch in their living room, where she reported, he
had started touching her ""here"" while motioning to her vaginal area for the detective. She
told the detective he asked her if he could, over her clothing, feel it, to which she said no.
(GE 6; GE 7 at 15-16.)
Applicant acknowledged in his police interview he had touched his stepdaughter's
vagina but stated that he had explained to the detective he had “unintentionally touched
her  vagina.”  (Tr.  at  66;  GE  6;  GE  7  at  16.)  He  declined  to  say  if  his  stepdaughter’s
allegations were false because he has no recollection of the incidents. He did not “believe
she would lie about something that happened.” (Tr. at 67.) He explained that he is not
denying the allegations by his stepdaughter and cites his sleep disorders for his lack of
memory  for  why  he  cannot  recall  any  incidents.  (Tr.  at  69,  77-78,  81,  83.)  During  his
DOHA  hearing,  he  testified  that  he  only remembers  “it  from  a  nightmare  because  [he]
kept reliving the allegation over and over. But what [he] remember[s] is, we were sitting
on the couch watching cartoons. I had my arm back around her and my hand on her leg.
Like on the side. And I adjusted, because I was uncomfortable, and I accident[ly] touched
her vagina.” (Tr. at 68.) He stated essentially the same in his police interview. (GE 7 at
15-16.)
Applicant  has  been  under  the  care  of  a  licensed  professional  counselor  since
January of 2023. He sought treatment voluntarily. He began reaching out to the counselor
in August of 2022 after a referral from the VA. On his own initiative he walked into the
office  after  being  unsuccessful  making  phone  contact.  His  counselor  indicated  he  had
been “very proactive in seeking out treatment.” (AE F.) He is described as compliant and
working hard in the therapy process and has to date done nothing to violate the terms of
his bond. He remains in the community because he is compliant and does not present
himself as a risk to the community. His counselor notes, without drawing any conclusions,
that Applicant is working hard in therapy to understand and work through his own history
of childhood sexual abuse which he encountered at a very young age. (AE F.)
As  of  June  8,  2023,  when  the  record  closed,  Applicant’s  criminal  trial  remained
pending. (GE 7)
Applicant  offered  the  testimony  of  a  work  colleague  and  former  Marine.  The
witness was very credible. He detailed his familiarity of some of the things Applicant had
overcome and events in the Applicant’s life that had set him back. The witness understood
the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct  and circumstances surrounding the
conduct of Applicant. He allowed Applicant to stay with him and his family after Applicant
had been removed from his home. He identified the presence of rehabilitative potential in
Applicant based on how accountable Applicant had been with all that had happened. (Tr.
98, 102-103.)

"In Applicant’s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b-1.g,
2.a,  3.a,  3.b,  5.a,  and  5.b.  He  denied  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶  1.a  and  4.a.  His
admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a   38-year-old   systems   engineer  employed   by  defense   contractors
since  June  2012. He was unemployed  from  June  to  November 2014  when  he  left  a  job
by  mutual  agreement  after  he   was  accused   of  making   a   racial  comment  to   a   female
servicemember and  touching  her hair  without consent.  He served  on  active  duty  in the
U.S.  Navy  from   August  2004   to   May  2012   and   received   a   general  discharge   under
honorable conditions.
Applicant has never married. He  lived  with  a  cohabitant  from  November  2017  to
April 2020. Before they  separated, he  and  his cohabitant had  difficulties due  in part to
his sexually suggestive text message exchanges with five other women. (GX 12 at 2; Tr.
57) He has a  four-year-old son, and  he  shares custody of his son  with  his son’s mother,
his  former cohabitant. (Tr. 56)
Applicant received a security clearance in January 2006, while he was on active
duty in the Navy. His clearance was revalidated in 2013, while he was employed by a
defense contractor.
In  January  2002,  Applicant  was  charged  with  underage  possession  of  alcohol.
He  was  fined  and  his driver’s  license  was  suspended  for  six  months.  (GX  1  at  43-44;
GX 13 at 2)
In  January  2003,  Applicant  was  convicted  of  reckless  driving  resulting  in  an
accident. (GX 11) The accident occurred when he drove too fast around a curve and hit
a  guardrail.  No  other  vehicles  were  involved.  He  had  not  been  consuming  alcohol
before driving. (Tr. 58)
In  August 2003, Applicant  was  convicted of  reckless  driving by  driving  92 miles
per  hour (mph)  in  a  55-mph  zone.  The  record  reflects  that  the  maximum  sentence  for
this offense was six months in jail, but it does not reflect the sentence that was imposed.
(GX 10)
In  December  2007,  Applicant  was  convicted  of  driving  under  the  influence  of
intoxicants  (DWI).  His blood-alcohol content (BAC) was  .24, well above the  legal limit.
He  was  fined  $350,  his  driver’s  license  was  suspended  for  six  months,  and  he  was
required to attend alcohol safety classes. (Tr. 59-60; GX 5 at 7-8)
In November 2009, Applicant was again convicted of DWI. He was sentenced to
jail  for  12  months  and  five  days,  all  of  which  was  suspended.  He  was  placed  on
unsupervised probation,  and his driver’s  license  was  suspended  for one  year. He  was
required to attend alcohol safety classes. (Tr. 60-61; GX 5 at 5)
In  October 2011, Applicant was charged  with  DWI,  2nd  offense  within five  years
and  refusal to  submit to  a breath  test.  He was convicted of DWI and  sentenced  to  jail for
12  months  and  five  days, with  11  months  and  15  days suspended.   His driver’s license
was suspended  for 36  months, and  he  was required  to  complete  alcohol safety classes.
(GX 5  at  5-6;  Tr. 62) Disposition  of  the  charge  of refusing  to  submit  to  a  breath  test  was
deferred and then dismissed in March 2013. (Tr. 66; GX 5  at 6)
While  Applicant  was  in  jail,  he  missed  the  sailing  of  his  ship,  and  he  received
nonjudicial  punishment  for  unauthorized  absence,  missing  movement,  and  violating  a
general  order  or  regulation.  (Tr.  64)  In  May  2012,  he  received  a  general  discharge
under honorable conditions, based on a pattern of misconduct. (GX 1 at 22)
While  Applicant  was  pending  discharge  from  the  Navy,  he  self-referred  to  the
Navy  Substance  Abuse  Rehabilitation  Program  (SARP)  and  completed  a  31-day
inpatient  rehabilitation  program.  His  alcohol  use  declined  after  he  completed  the
program. He stopped drinking between 2014 and 2016. (GX 3 at 4)
In  June  2014,  Applicant  was  terminated  from  his  job  for  making  a  racially
insensitive comment to a coworker, an enlisted woman in the Air Force. He considered
the coworker a good friend. While off-duty he offered his coworker a drink because he
had  two  drinks  in  front  of  him.  She  declined,  and  he  made  a  comment  that  she
interpreted  as  racial  profiling.  She  complained  to  their  supervisor,  and  he  was
terminated. Applicant disclosed this incident in his SCA as follows:
Formal  complaint  regarding  professionalism  was  submitted  by  Air  Force
member  against  me.  Terminated  by  company  without  being
fully
investigated. . . . Formal complaint stated I made racial comments towards
Air  Force  member  and  touched  her  hair  without  consent.  Air  Force
member  attempted  to  take  complaint  back  during  investigation  however
company found it easier to terminate than continue with investigation.
When  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  security  investigator  in  January  2021,  he
told the investigator that he offered his coworker a red fruit punch drink and, when she
declined,  he   told   her  that   everyone   loves  red   fruit  punch.   (GX  12   at  2).  He   told   the
investigator  that  he   was  called   into   his  manager’s  office  on   the   following   morning   and
told  that   he   was   terminated   effective   immediately.   He  told  the   investigator  that  his
employer  did   not  conduct  an   investigation   because   the   Air   Force   member  no   longer
worked   in  the   building.  However,  when   the   Air   Force  investigated   the   incident,   they
found   that  the   Air   Force   member’s  complaint  was  “incorrect.”  He   told  the   investigator
that  his   employer  later  determined   that  the   coworker’s  complaint   was  unfounded   and
offered   him   another  job   within  the   company,   but  he   no   longer  wanted   to   work  for  the
company.  (GX 12  at 2)  The  record  does not contain  any  documentation  of  the  complaint
against  Applicant,  the   investigation   of  that   complaint,  or   the   termination   of   Applicant’s
employment.
In August 2019, Applicant and his cohabitant hosted a joint birthday party for him
and  her  son,  which  was  attended  by  about  30  guests,  including  Applicant’s  neighbor
and his neighbor’s granddaughter. The party ended at about 2:00 am. Applicant testified
that  he  consumed  three  or  four  beers  during  the  day  but  did  not  believe  he  was
intoxicated. (Tr. 76)
Applicant  testified  that,  while  cleaning  up  after  the  party,  he  noticed  that  his
cohabitant’s son was not in his room, and he could not find him anywhere in the house.
He knew that some of the children who had attended the party were spending the night
in his neighbor’s house. He texted his neighbor, asking if his cohabitant’s son was at the
neighbor’s house. When the neighbor did not respond to the text, Applicant went to the
neighbor’s  house  and  knocked  on  the  door,  but  no  one  responded.  Applicant  then
entered the house through an unlocked back door and asked a friend of the cohabitant’s
son  if  he  was  in  the  house,  and  the  friend  stated  that  he  was  “in  the  back.”  Applicant
looked  in  one  bedroom,  but  the  cohabitant’s  son  was  not  there.  He  then  went  to  a
second bedroom and saw a person in bed who had blonde hair similar to the son’s hair.
He testified that he “just kind of peeked in,” “might have had one foot in the door to peek
around  the  door,”  and  softly  called  out  the  cohabitant’s  son’s  name.  The  neighbor’s
granddaughter, who was sleeping in the bed, was startled. He apologized and told the
granddaughter that he was looking for his cohabitant’s son, and she responded that the
son  was  “on  the  couch.”  (Tr.  42-43,  50)  He  found  his  cohabitant’s  son  under  some
blankets.  At  about  this  time,  the  neighbor  came  out  of  his  bedroom  and  confronted
Applicant. Applicant apologized, explained why he was there, and left.
The neighbor’s granddaughter called the police and told them that Applicant had
attempted  to  kiss her, caressed  her hips,  and  invited  her  to  “do  some  coke”  with  him.
The  granddaughter  also  told  the  police  that  Applicant  had  touched  her  breasts  during
the party on the previous day.
Applicant was charged with felony breaking and entering with intent to commit a
misdemeanor  and  sexual  battery.  He  was  represented  by  an  attorney  at  the  trial.
Pursuant to a plea agreement, he pleaded guilty to trespassing and assault and battery,
both  misdemeanors.  He  was  sentenced  to  one  year  in  jail,  suspended  for  five  years,
conditioned on good behavior, completing a ten-week alcohol-abuse treatment program,
and having no contact with the victim or the victim’s family. He will be on probation until
November 2024. In his answer to the SOR and at the hearing, he admitted trespassing,
but he maintained that he was not guilty of the assault and battery and that he pleaded
guilty to avoid jail time.
Applicant’s neighbor testified  on  his behalf at the  hearing.  His neighbor testified
that  they  continued  to  have  casual  contact  with  each  other  after  the  August  2019
incident.  His  neighbor  also  testified  that  his  granddaughter  had  several  “traumatic
issues” in her life and that at the time of the incident, “she was seeking a lot of attention
and  known  to  tell  fibs.”  (Tr.  28)  He  stopped  short  of  testifying  that  his  granddaughter
was  lying,  but  said  that  he  was  skeptical  about  her  accusation  against  Applicant.  (Tr.
28-29, 33-34)
When  Applicant  was  interviewed  by  a  security  investigator  in  January  2021,  he
told  the  investigator  that  before  his  last  DUI,  he  drank  six  to  twelve  beers  about  four
times a  week,  but he stopped drinking for two  years beginning in 2014. At  the time of
the interview, he had resuming drinking. He told the investigator that he consumed two
or three beers about once a week, but that about once a year he drank about six beers
and became intoxicated. (GX 12 at 3)
In  November  2021,  Applicant  underwent  a  psychological  evaluation  at  the
request of the DOD CAF. The evaluation was conducted by video teleconference.  The
psychologist  noted  that  he  “presented  in  this  evaluation  with  a  moderately  antisocial
manner,” “appeared to minimize his responsibility in the problem situations described in
his  background  information,”  and  “blamed  others  in  instances  that  appeared  to  be
matters  of  his  own  lack  of  behavioral  control.”  The  psychologist  concluded  that
Applicant attempted to mislead him about the details of past events to cast himself in a
more positive light than may have been warranted by his actions.
Applicant  told  the  psychologist  that  he  suffered  an  estimated  20  instances  of
broken  bones  in  his  lifetime,  engaging  in  sky  diving,  riding  an  off-road  four-wheeler,
playing  basketball,  and  being  punched  in  the  face.  (GX  3  at  3)  At  the  hearing,  he
admitted that he has always been a high-energy, adventuresome person. (Tr. 51)
The  psychologist  found  that  if  Applicant  entered  his  neighbor’s  home  for  the
purpose  of  sexual  encounter  with  the  neighbor’s  granddaughter,  and  touched  her  and
confined  her  in  her  room  for  a  time,  particularly  if  he  was  intoxicated,  “then  this  act
would represent a nexus between his alcohol use problems, antisocial style, impulsivity,
and  stimulus  seeking  tendencies.”  He  diagnosed  Applicant  with  “alcohol-use  disorder,
severe,  in  sustained  remission  (by  subject  report).”  He  suggested  the  following  as
“diagnostic  possibilities,”  stopping  short  of  a
formal  diagnosis:  attention
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), predominately hyperactive/impulsive presentation;
and other specified personality disorder (with features of antisocial personality disorder).
The  psychologist  concluded  that  Applicant’s  ADHD  symptoms  and  a  history  of
alcohol  use  did  not  present  a  significant  risk  to  his  reliability,  trustworthiness,  and
judgment,  but  that  “his  personality  condition  certainly  could  contribute  to  a  lack  of
trustworthiness
information.”  The  psychologist
concluded  that  Applicant’s  prognosis  “is  uncertain  given  that  he  did  not  seem  to  be
entirely forthright with [him].” (GX 3 at 9)
in  safeguarding  national  security
The  psychologist  listed  the  following  examples  of  inconsistencies  in  information
provided by Applicant that suggested a lack of candor:
•  Applicant told him that he could not remember when he last drank
more  than  three  beers,  but  he  told  an  investigator in  2021  that  he
drinks six or more beers and becomes intoxicated once a year.
•  Applicant used  the  term  “retired” to  describe  his departure from  the
Navy even though he  was discharged  for misconduct.
•  Applicant  said   that   he   “left”  a   job   in  2014   when   in  fact   he   was
terminated  because  of  a  racially related  comment, and  he  provided
an  exculpatory explanation  of the  event,  when  the  records reflected
that he “very likely” made racially offensive remarks.
•  Applicant pleaded guilty to a crime but told the psychologist that he
did not sexually assault the victim.
•  Applicant told him that he had consumed some alcohol but was not
intoxicated on the night of the alleged sexual assault in 2019.
The psychologist’s conclusion that Applicant was not “entirely forthright” appears
to  be  based  on  the  psychologist’s  conclusion  that  all  the  allegations  against  Applicant
probably  were  supported  by  the  evidence.  While  Applicant’s  guilty  pleas  at  his  trial
would justify a conclusion that he trespassed into his neighbor’s home and touched the
neighbor’s  granddaughter,  the  psychologist  apparently  believed  that  Applicant  groped
his neighbor’s granddaughter at the party, touched her inappropriately after he entered
his neighbor’s house, looking for his cohabitant’s son, and invited her to “do coke” with
him.  The  civil  authorities  did  not  charge  Applicant  with  groping  the  granddaughter  or
offering cocaine to her, and these acts were not alleged in the SOR.
The psychologist also appeared to believe that Applicant made an inappropriate
remark to a coworker that caused him to be fired.  The psychologist stated in his report
that  he  was  told  by  Applicant’s  mother  that  he  made  a  comment  such  as  “all  black
people like Kool-Aid.” (GX 3 at 3) There is no statement from Applicant’s mother in the
record.  There  is  no  record  of  the  investigation  of  the  complaint.  The  psychologist
determined  that  Applicant’s  description  of  what  he  said  to  a  coworker  was  untrue,
because  Applicant’s  mother  described  the  comment  differently.  It  is  not  clear  whether
the  psychologist  knew  that  the  complaint  was  investigated  and  determined  to  be
unfounded, or that he knew that Applicant’s employer offered to give him another job in
the company.
The  psychologist  also  concluded  that  Applicant  falsely  claimed  that  he  was  not
intoxicated on the night of the party, because Applicant admitted to his supervisor that
he  was  intoxicated.  The  psychologist’s  report  lists  a  document  from  Applicant’s
supervisor  as  one  of  the  documents  he  reviewed,  but  at  the  hearing,  Department
Counsel stated, “We weren’t able to  look at that report because  of our rules.” (Tr. 115)
The  security  investigator’s  report  does  not  include  a  statement  from  Applicant’s
employer.  There  is no documentary evidence  in  the  hearing  record  of  any  admissions
by  Applicant  to  his  supervisor  regarding  this  event,  and  no  evidence  from  other
witnesses that Applicant was intoxicated at the party.
Finally,  although  there  is  no  evidence  that  Applicant  ever  was  involved  with
cocaine, the psychologist appears to have accepted the granddaughter’s assertions that
Applicant  touched  her inappropriately  and  offered  to  “do  some  coke”  with  her  as  true,
and  he  concluded  that  Applicant  was  not  being  truthful  with  him  when  he  denied  her
accusation.
Applicant  decided  to  stop  drinking  in  2022,  when  his  son  was  born.  His
cohabitant left him shortly after the birth, but they share custody of their son. (Tr. 56) He
testified that he last consumed alcohol on July 2, 2022. (Tr. 67) Applicant’s older brother
corroborated  his testimony about his decision  to  stop drinking and  the effect  it  had on
his behavior. (Tr. 98-100; 103-05)
Applicant is receiving counseling from a therapist once a week, and he receives
prescriptions from  a  nurse practitioner in the  counselor’s office.  (Tr. 72, 83) In a report
dated  August  8,  2022,  the  nurse  practitioner  stated  that  Applicant  had  abstained  from
alcohol  for  ten  weeks.  Applicant  receives  prescription  drugs  for  ADHD,  anxiety,
depressive  disorder,  and  panic  disorder.  (AX  J)  He  testified  that  he  stopped  taking
drugs  for  anxiety  and  panic  attacks  about  a  year  ago.  (Tr.  84)  Although  he  was
evaluated  for  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD),  he  and  his  counselor  have
determined that he does not have PTSD. (Tr. 81, AX J
Applicant attends AA meetings once or twice a month, but he has not found the
“right group.” He testified that he has completed all of the 12-Step Program. (Tr. 74) He
sees a therapist regularly, and he realizes the negative effect of alcohol on his life. (Tr.
71-72)
Applicant  has  become  more  active  in  his  community  and  has  started  coaching
baseball. He testified, “I’m trying to be a person that I should have been a long time ago,
and it just took me way too long to get here.” (Tr. 72)
Applicant testified that he started having panic attacks in July 2022. He and his
cohabitant  had  started  seeing  each  other  again,  but  when  he  returned  from  a  30-day
deployment, he learned that she was seeing someone else and he was no longer part
of  her  life,  even  though  they  had  three  children  together. (Tr.  79)  He  admitted  that  he
still  suffers  from  panic  attacks  and  depression,  which  he  attributed  to  abstaining  from
alcohol.  He testified, “It's definitely a little harder when you have to face things  face to
face and not just hide them or drown them.” (Tr. 51)
A  friend  of  Applicant  who  has  known  him  for  ten  years  and  was  at  the  party  in
August  2019  submitted  a  statement  attesting  to  his  good  character.  The  friend  also
stated that he did not observe any inappropriate interaction between Applicant and the
neighbor’s granddaughter. (AX G)
Applicant’s
father,  a  retired  Navy  petty  officer,
that  Applicant
meticulously  complied  with  the  revocation  of  his  driver’s  license.  Applicant’s  father,
mother, sister, and some friends drove him to and from work each day. (Tr. 91-92) His
father is proud of the progress he has made in turning his life around. (Tr. 89)
testified
A  Navy  commander  serving  as  the  combat  systems  officer  on  a  U.S.  Navy
combatant  ship,  who  has  known  Applicant  for  three  years  and  served  with  him  on
multiple  ships,  submitted  a  statement  attesting  to  his  skill  as  a  fleet  systems  engineer
and his personal trustworthiness and integrity. She has observed Applicant’s change in
behavior during the past year. She states, “[Applicant’s] mindset has shifted away from
destructive  thought  and  behaviors  and  has  been  laser  focused  on  good  decisions,
personal growth, and impacting others by sharing wisdom he has gained on his journey
and providing motivation through all circumstances.” (AX I at 1)
A  retired  master  chief  petty  officer  who  has  known  and  served  with  Applicant
since  2020  submitted  a  statement  attesting  to  his  technical  expertise,  dedication,
honesty, and integrity. (AX I at 2) An active-duty lieutenant commander who has known
Applicant since August 2022 describes him as a loving and doting father, who is full of
life,  energy,  and  positivity.  (AX  I  at  4)  An  active-duty  chief  petty  officer  has  watched
Applicant make  significant changes in his lifestyle and become a great father and  role
model  for  his  son  and  an  exceptionally  skilled  fleet  engineer.  (AX  I  at  3)  A  former
shipmate  who  has  known  Applicant  since  2006  believes  that  he  has  overcome  his
“personal  demons”  and  “found  love,  purpose,  and  a  peace  that  .  .  .  that  has  forever
changed  him.” He  states  that  Applicant  is  now “patient,  more  measured  when  speaks,
and  most importantly, he  thinks before [he] acts.” (AX  I at 5) A  neighbor for  two years
who has known Applicant for seven years describes him as “very dependable, selfless,
giving, trustworthy, and a joy to be around.” (AX I at 6)
The parents of Applicant’s former cohabitant are both retired sailors. Her mother
is  a  retired  Navy  limited-duty  lieutenant  with  20  years  of  service,  and  her  father  is  a
retired  senior  chief  petty  officer  with  26  years  of  service.  They  consider  Applicant  a
devoted  father  to  his  own  biological  child  as  well  as  two  of  his  former  cohabitant’s
children, treating them as his own. They have remained in contact with Applicant after
he  and  cohabitant  separated,  and  they  have  the  “utmost  respect”  for  him  and  are
confident that he has turned his life around. (AX I at 7)
",False
"Applicant  admitted  both  allegations  of  the  SOR.  After  a  thorough  and  careful
review of the testimony, pleadings, and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact:
Applicant is 33 years old, has no children, and is recently engaged to be married.
He is pursuing a master’s degree, and served on active duty in the U.S. Army in Guam,
North Carolina, and Hawaii. (TR at page 5 line 15 to page 6 line 13, GX 1 at pages 5,
9~11, 13, 20 and 24, and AppX A.)
Guideline D - Sexual Behavior  & Guideline J: Criminal Conduct
1.a.  and  2.a.  Applicant  admits  that  he  committed  criminal  conduct  by  paying
masseuses in Guam, in North Carolina and in Hawaii, to engage sexual activities, about
20 times, from May of 2010 to November of 2021. (TR at page 17 line 22 to page 40 line
4.) “The larger portion . . . [of these illegal activities] came after April 26, 2019,” after his
brother passed away. (TR at page 22 lines 7~17.) Applicant ceased seeking sexual favors
from masseuses after he met his fiancée. (TR at page 44 line 3 to page 48 line 10.) He
also disclosed his past illegal sexual conduct to fiancée. (AppX A.)
",False
"Applicant  denied  the  allegations  in  SOR  ¶¶  1.a,  2.a.  and  3.  a.  After  a  thorough
and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings,  exhibits,  and  testimony,  I  make  the  following
findings of fact.
Applicant  is  a  26-year-old  employee  of  a  defense  contractor.  He  has  been
employed with the defense contractor since April of 2020. Applicant is married, and has
no  children.  (TR  at  page  14  line 14  to page 17  line  13, and  GX  1 at  pages  7,  15  and
22~23.)
Guideline   J   -  Criminal  Conduct,  Guideline   D   -  Sexual   Behavior,   &  Guideline   E   -
Personal Conduct
1.a., 2.a. and 3.a. In about October of 2017, more than five years ago  while on
active duty with the Marine Corps, Applicant attempted to record and take photos of a
female sailor, while she was changing her clothes in a changing room. This attempt was
done  without  her  knowledge  or  consent.  (TR  at  page  18  line  2  to  page  29  line  17,  at
page 35 lines 19~23, and at page 37 lines 14~22.) As a result, Applicant was convicted
at  a  Summary  Court-Martial  (SCM)  for  Attempt  to  record  and  take  pictures  of  a  Naval
member of the Armed Forces without consent.  As a result of this conviction, Applicant
was  reduced  in  rank  from  a  Lance  Corporal  (E-3)  to  a  Private  First  Class  (E-2),  and
discharged in about  December of 2019 with an Other Than Honorable Discharge. (TR
at  page  45  line  8  to  page  49  line  3,  and  GXs  5  and  6.)  Applicant’s  wife,  who  was  his
girlfriend in 2017, is aware of Applicant’s criminal conduct.
",True
"In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b, 3.d, 3.e, 3.f, and
the cross-allegation at SOR ¶ 2.a, all with explanations. He denied SOR ¶¶ 2.b, 3.a, 3.b,
and 3.c, all with explanations. Applicant’s admissions are incorporated into the findings
of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  exhibits  submitted,  I
make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 34 years old. He married in 2013. He and his wife separated in 2019
and divorced in 2020. They have three children, a son, age 13, a daughter, age 8, and a
son, age 7. They share custody of their children and live in the same neighborhood. (GE
1; Tr. 59-62, 68)
Applicant  earned   an   associate   degree   in   2010.   He  served   on   active   duty   in   the
U.S.  Navy  as  a   corpsman   and   psychiatric  technician   from   2010   to   2015.  He  was
discharged  honorably  as an  E-3. From  October 2015  to  October 2017, he  worked  as a
mental  health   technician   at   a   civilian   hospital   in  state   1.  Since   October  2017,  he   has
been   employed   by  a   defense   contractor  as   a   mental  health   technician  in  an   inpatient
psychiatric  unit at a  naval hospital in state  2. He held a  clearance  in the Navy. (GE 1; Tr.
9-10, 35-36, 46-50, 58, 112-114)
In 2014, Applicant took the cellphone of another sailor without her permission. He
“flipped” through pictures on her phone. Applicant said he did it as a “joke.” (GE 1 at 20)
He  was  charged  with  wrongful  misappropriation  of  the  cellphone  under  the  Uniform
Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). He pled guilty, received non-judicial punishment (NJP)
of 45 days of extra duty. (SOR ¶ 1.b) (The SOR allegation references forfeiture of $858
a  month  for  two  months  but  this  is  not  established).  Applicant  was  also  transferred  to
another job location so he would no longer have contact with the female sailor. (GE 1 at
20; GE 2 at 2-3; Tr.  51) In his hearing, Applicant  testified  it was a “juvenile prank that
was very stupid.” He said he gave the phone right back and did not steal it. (Tr. 33-34,
75-79)
In  2015,  Applicant  was  investigated  by  the Naval  Criminal  Investigative  Service
(NCIS)  following  an  interaction  between  himself  and  a  female  former  patient.  About  a
year  after  the  female  sailor  was  a  patient  of  his,  he  saw  her  at  a  public  library  and
engaged  her  in  conversation.  She  later  alleged  that  he  had  been  “hitting  on”  her.  His
background  interview  references  a  charge  of  sexual  assault  under  UCMJ  Article  120
(GE 2 at 3) but there are no charging documents in the record. Applicant asserted that
he did not do anything inappropriate in interacting with his former patient. (Tr. 52) The
case  was  evidently  dismissed  shortly  before Applicant  was  discharged  from  the  Navy.
(GE 2 at 3; Tr. 51-55). This incident was not alleged in the SOR.
While working at the behavioral hospital in state 1 in 2016, Applicant was verbally
reprimanded after giving his personal phone number to a female patient. He said he did
this  unprompted  so  the  patient  would  have  a  way  to  reach  out  if  she  needed  help,
because  he  felt  that  she  “did  not  have  adequate  support.”  He  denied  any  romantic
interest. (GE 2 at 4; Tr. 55-56) He had not done this before. He had been trained in how
to  interact  with  patients  and  said  what  he  did  was  “not  encouraged.”  (Tr.  56)  This
incident was not alleged in the SOR.
In early July 2020, police responded to a complaint filed by a neighbor (Ms. N) of
Applicant’s, after she found inappropriate messages and photos on the cell phone of C,
her  12-year-old  daughter.  C  had  been  communicating  with  Applicant  online,  via
Facebook  Messenger,  in  June  and  July  2020.  The  N  family  and  their  children  were
friends of Applicant’s children. In August 2020, following an investigation, Applicant was
arrested and charged with (taking) indecent liberties with a child, a felony. (GE 3) (SOR
¶¶ 1.a, 2.a)
Applicant  was  interviewed  about  his  arrest  in  a  security  clearance  background
interview on September 1, 2020. (GE 2 at 7-10) (An earlier background interview, in late
July 2020, predated Applicant’s arrest). (GE 2 at 2-6; Tr. 72-73, 100)
When  prompted  at the  start of his  September 2020  interview.  Applicant reported
that  he  had  been  accused  of taking  indecent  liberties with  a  child.  He said  his wife  had
had  a  “falling  out”  with  her friend  Ms. N  (the  neighbor)  and had accused  both  Applicant
and  his wife   of  indecent  liberties   with  her   children.   The families   and   their   children   had
been  friends  and  the  families’  daughters would socialize together. Applicant  tried  to  look
after N’s daughters because  they  did  not have  a father figure.  (GE 2  at 7; Tr.,  49-50, 63-
66)
Applicant said he talked to C, the 12-year-old daughter, on a daily basis through
Facebook during June and July 2020. They discussed general topics such as daily life.
He  acknowledged  using  “inappropriate  language”  with  C.  He  said  C  had  sent  him
“pictures of herself, to show him her outfit, and [Applicant] referred to [C] as ‘sexy.’” He
said he should have used words like “beautiful” instead, and was “just trying to look out
for her by boosting her self-esteem.” He acknowledged his words were “inappropriate.”
(GE 2 at 7-8; Tr. 66-67, 69-70)
Applicant then said C volunteered to send him another picture. C then sent him a
“naked photo” of herself. He said he deleted the photo and told C to never do anything
like  that  again.  He  did  not  believe  he  had  pressured  C.  Applicant  did  not  tell  his  wife
about  the  photo  “because  he  did  not  want  to  violate  [C’s]  trust  by  getting  her  into
trouble.  [Applicant]  continued  to  have  daily  contact  with  [C]  after  she  sent  him  the
photo.” He said there was nothing further sexual and no sexual gratification on his part.
(GE 2 at 8; Tr, 69-70)
C’s family member discovered the photo on C’s phone and contacted Applicant
through  C’s  Facebook  account.  He  told  Applicant  that  “he  did  not  like  [Applicant’s]
relationship with [C] and began to get aggressive and threatening towards [Applicant].”
Applicant then said he would cut  off all contact with C, and did so. He was arrested a
few  weeks  later.  (GE  2  at  8;  Tr.  70-71)  Applicant  said  that,  as  a  father,  he  would  be
“concerned” if his child were interacting with a 30-year-old man on a cell phone. (Tr. 70)
Applicant said in the interview that he believed Ms. M was coaching C to make
these accusations. He has only been with C in person in the presence of Ms. M or his
wife,  except  once,  when  he  and  C  were  seated  on  the  couch  together  for  about  20
minutes. He said he believed Ms. M might claim that Applicant tried to kiss C, which he
denied. He said other children were present and playing in the house at the time. (GE 2
at 8-9) He got no sexual gratification from any  interaction  with  C. Applicant  said in his
interview that the criminal case was pending, he had retained counsel, and said he was
innocent. (GE 2 at 9)
In  March  2021,  Applicant  pled  guilty  to  a  lesser  charge  of  contributing  to  the
delinquency of a juvenile.  He was  fined and sentenced to two  years of probation. The
fine has been paid. (GE 2 at 17, GE 3; Tr. 62, 73-74)
In  his  hearing  testimony,  Applicant  denied  instigating  “any  kind  of  sexually
inappropriate conduct” with C. He said it was she who sent sexual materials to him. He
acknowledged that he should not have been talking to her in the first place. (Tr. 39) He
did not recall how he came to have C’s cell phone number. “I assume she just gave it to
me.” He said they interacted on Facebook, not by cell-phone texting. He asserted that C
found  him  on  Facebook  and  added  him  as  a  contact.  (Tr.  41)  Applicant  said  C  would
send her pictures and ask her his opinion and said that one time she sent him a sexual
picture,  which  he  deleted  at  once  and  told  her  that  was  inappropriate.  (Tr.  41)  He
confirmed that he was charged after C’s parents discovered the messages and pressed
charges. (Tr. 41-42)
While on probation, Applicant was required  to  “have  no inappropriate contact with
[C]   or   any   other   minors.”     He  does  not   believe   there   was   a   “stay   away”   order   put  in
place,  but  he  was  “strongly advised”  by the  judge  not  to  contact  C again,  and  he has not
done   so.  (Tr.  42-43,   94)   His  probation   was   unsupervised,   and   he   was  not  required   to
register  as  a   sex  offender.  He  said  he   did  not  have   to   attend   counseling.  He  said  he
completed   the   two   years  of   probation   in   March  2023,   (Tr.  43-44)  I  requested   that
Applicant  provide  post-hearing  documentation that he had completed  probation  fully and
successfully.   (Tr.  44)   He  did   not  do   so.  He   said  he   has  not  engaged   in   that  conduct
again  and he never will. (Tr. 39)
In April 2021, Applicant was investigated by the local police following a complaint
filed by his ex-wife, A. She had reported that their daughter, D, had told her that D had
been  sitting  next  to  Applicant  on  the  couch,  where  D  observed  Applicant  “touching
himself” while watching a “video of naked girls” on his phone. (GE 4 at 3) (SOR ¶ 2.b)
Local police interviewed all three of their children.  Only one  “made  a  disclosure
about her father showing her pornographic material”  one time. In the police report, the
circumstances  were  explained  as  “child  walked  in  on  dad  late  at  night.”  (GE  3  at  5-6)
The  district  attorney  expressed  concern  but  declined  to  prosecute.  The  investigating
officer  spoke  at  length  with  a  representative  from  the  county  department  of  social
services (DSS) and “determined [that the] biological mother [A] was feeding information
to [the] children.” The police investigation was then closed without further action. (GE 3
at 6)
Applicant  denied  the  incident  in  its  entirety  and  said  it  “never  happened.”  He
in  D’s  presence  and  denied  watching
denied
pornography on his phone in her presence. (Tr. 37-38) He said in his Answer that it was
a false claim brought by his ex-wife with no basis in fact. (Answer to SOR ¶ 2.b; Tr. 98)
touching  himself
inappropriately
Applicant  provided  a  January  2022  letter  from  county  DSS  regarding  their
investigation  of  April  2021  allegations  of  “sexual  abuse  and  neglect,  improper  care
improper supervision, and injurious involvement.”  In June 2021, Applicant’s family was
found to be in need of parenting skills, child characteristics, and communications skills.
Applicant  and  his  former  wife  completed  a  “Crossroads  of  Parenting  and  Divorce”
program  and other classes, and the DSS case was closed. (AE C; Answer; Tr. 87-88,
104-105)  DSS’s  letter  concluded  with  recommendations  that  Applicant  “continue  to
ensure to not expose your children to any pornography, sexually explicit conversations,
or  any  sexual  acts.  The  Department  believes  your  children  are  in  a  safe  environment
residing with you.” (AE C) Applicant said he has complied with these recommendations.
(Tr. 88-89) He has not participated in other family or parent counseling. (Tr. 109)
Applicant  confirmed  at  his  DOHA  hearing  that  he  was  not  charged  or  arrested
because  of  this  incident,  and  the  authorities  took  no  action  to  alter  the  child  custody
arrangement in place with his ex-wife as a result. There was no negative impact on his
probation status and he was not told to report the matter to probation. (Tr. 44-46)
Applicant  acknowledged  another  previous  incident,  in  which  another  of  his
daughters  walked  in  on  him  late  one  night  when  he  was  watching  pornography  in  the
living  room.  Anything  she  saw  was  inadvertent  and  he  thought  he  was  alone.  He  was
not aware that he had been seen until his ex-wife told him that their daughter had seen
him.  He acknowledged  that  he  should not  have  been  watching pornography  where  he
could have been discovered, and now does so in private. (Tr. 81-85, 87, 99)
Applicant has not had any allegations of misconduct made against him regarding
his children since 2021. He still has a Facebook account but uses it rarely. He does not
interact  with  children  on  Facebook.  (Tr.  86)  He  has  not  engaged  in  inappropriate
behavior  since  2021,  either  with  children  or  his  patients.  He  has  not  had  personal
relationships with patients since the incident in 2016. (Tr. 94)
Under Guideline F, the SOR concerns six delinquent debts, totaling $9,809. The
debts are established by credit reports in the record, from June 2020, November 2021,
and May 2022. (GE 5, 6, 7) (SOR ¶ 3)
Applicant disclosed  on his  SCA  that  he  had  some  delinquent debts, and  that  he
was resolving  them  with  the  assistance  of a  debt  consolidation  company. (GE  1  at  37-

his debts,  all  but two  of which  were resolved  by the  time  of the  hearing. (Tr. 25-26,  29)
He  is no  longer contracted  to  the  debt  resolution  company since  the  remaining creditors
would  not   settle   with   them,   and   he   stopped   paying   the   company   a   few   months   before
the   hearing.  (Tr.  28,  105)   He  acknowledged   that  he   incurred   debts  because   he   spent
more   than   he   could   afford  to   pay,   but   he   took  out   loans   for  necessary   expenses  (rent

returns and no unpaid tax debt. (Tr. 105-109)
Applicant  accepted  responsibility  for  his  actions.  He  said  he  accepted  his

Sexual Behavior/Criminal Conduct
SOR  ¶  1.a  alleged  that  Applicant  was  discharged  from  the  U.S.  Navy  due  to
allegations of sexual assault by three women that occurred in or about 2018. He stated
in  his  SOR  Answer,  “I  deny  the  allegations  that  led  to  my  discharge  from  the  United
States Navy. Supporting documents enclosed.”
The  fact  that  Applicant  was  discharged  from  the  Navy  is  not  in  dispute.  His
Certificate  of  Release  of  Discharge  from  Active  Duty  (DD  Form-214)  indicates  that  he
was  discharged  from  the  Navy  as  an  OS2  in  January  2021  with  a  general  discharge
under  honorable  conditions  for  reason  of  misconduct  –  serious  offense.  (GE  2)  The
events that led up to Applicant’s discharge are discussed in further detail, infra.
SOR  ¶  2  alleged  that  Applicant  was  awarded  non-judicial  punishment  (NJP)  in
about  February 2020, under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of  Military Justice (UCMJ)
for  violating  Article  92,  failure  to  obey  a  lawful  order;  Article  107,  false  official
statements;  Article  128,  assault  consummated  by  a  battery;  and  Article  134,  indecent
conduct. He received a reduction in grade to E-5. He stated in his SOR Answer, “I deny
the  allegations  that  led  to  my  discharge  from  the  United  States  Navy.  Supporting
documents enclosed.”
In  April  2019,  three  female  sailors  (FS1,  FS2,  and  FS3)  accused  Applicant  of
unwanted  touching.  FS1  filed  the  first  complaint;  FS2  filed  the  second  complaint;  and
FS3 filed the third complaint. At the time these complaints were made Applicant and all
three  of  the  female  sailors  were  attached  to  the  same  Navy  ship.  FS1  obtained  a
military  protection  order  (MPO)  against  Applicant  in  April  2019,  and  FS2  obtained  an
MPO against Applicant a few days later. FS1 accused Applicant of watching her in the
female berthing area taking a shower in March 2019. FS1 reported this incident a week
after  it  allegedly  took  place.  All  three  female  sailors  accused  Applicant  of  unwanted
sexual  touching  such  as  groping  their  buttocks  from  June  2018  to  March  2019  and
reported the violations in April 2019. (Tr. 32-33, 57-72, 84; GE 2)
In May 2019, Naval Criminal Investigation Service (NCIS) interviewed Applicant,
and he voluntarily provided his cell phone to be examined. During this interview, he was
informed  of  the  allegations  against  him  and  who  made  the  allegations.  After  reporting
these incidents, FS1 and FS2 were transferred from the ship, but FS3 chose to remain
on the ship with Applicant. (Tr. 33-34; GE 2)
In  December  2019,  the  ship’s  legal  officer  notified  Applicant  he  was  being
awarded  NJP,  Article  15,  UCMJ.  The  legal  officer  informed  Applicant  that  the  ship’s
immediate superior in the chain of command’s opined there was not enough evidence to
warrant a court-martial and recommended that the matter be dealt with at the command
level, i.e. NJP. (Tr. 35; GE 2)
Applicant  was  charged  with  the  following  offenses  under  the  UCMJ:  (1)  Article
92, failure to obey a lawful order; (2) Article 107, false official statement; (3) Article 128,
assault consummated by a battery; and (4) Article 134, indecent conduct. (GE 2; SOR
Answer;  Tr.  73-76)  Applicant  explained  that  he  was  charged  with  Article  107  because
his  statement  did  not  align  with  the  accusations  made  against  him.  Applicant  stated,
“That was the false official statement, the club thing, like I said that I didn’t go and they
(three  female  sailors)  said  that  I  did.”  (GE  2;  SOR  Answer;  Tr.  73-75)  As  a  member
attached to or embarked on a vessel, Applicant could not refuse NJP and demand a trial
by court-martial, which would have afforded him greater rights to include, but not limited
to representation by counsel. (10 U.S.C.  § 815, Article 15) FS3 recanted her complaint
prior to Applicant’s Article 15 hearing. (GE 2)
On Wednesday, January 8, 2020, two days before Applicant’s scheduled NJP on
Friday,  January  10,  2020,  Applicant  received  notification  from  the  Defense  Travel
Service  (DTS),  that  he  was  booked  on  a  flight  Friday  afternoon  from  his  present
location,  which  was  a  substantial  distance  to  his  ship’s  homeport  location,  to  the
homeport location. On January 10, 2020, the NJP took place on board his ship with his
Commanding Officer (CO) presiding. (GE 2; SOR Answer) Applicant “pled not guilty to
everything except the videos that were AirDropped accidentally in 2018.” (Tr. 36, 76-78)
The AirDropped videos refer to a group of approximately 20 movies a shipmate
transferred to Applicant in a group transfer in early 2018. Included in that group transfer
was,  “as  the  phone  backs  out,  the  last  second  you  can  see  the  silhouette  of  a  guy’s
genitalia.”  A  female  sailor  who  observed  the  transfer  of  videos  asked  Applicant  to
forward the movies to her, which he did stating, “I was like, Sure. Select all the movies,
push  send  –  well,  the box  with the arrow.  Another AirDrop  popped  up and  I  clicked  it,
not  thinking  nothing  of  it.”  The  female  sailor  later  filed  a  complaint  with  her  chain  of
command about receiving the video with the male genitalia image and the incident was
resolved  informally  at  the  command  level.  The  incident  resurfaced  a  year  and  a  half
later at Applicant’s January 2020 NJP and was included as one of the charges against
him. (Tr. 37-40, 71-72)
Applicant  described  his  NJP  hearing.  He  stated  his  CO  did  not  ask  him  any
questions  nor  did  he  look  at  him.  His  chain  of  command  and  various  command
personnel  were  present.  None  of  the  complaining  witnesses  were  present.  Applicant
explained how the AirDrop was accidental. He was unable to call witnesses in support
of  his  case  because  they  were  no  longer  on  the  ship  or because  of  short  notice  were
unable  to  provide  supporting  statements.  His  CO  found  him  guilty  of  all  charges  and
specifications  and  awarded  him:  (1)  to  be  reduced  from  pay  grade  E-6  to  E-5;  (2)  to
forfeit one-half month’s  pay per month  for two  months  (suspended  for 45 days); (3)  to
be restricted for 45 days (suspended for 45 days); and (4) to perform 45 days extra duty
(suspended for 45 days). (SOR Answer; Tr. 78)
Applicant, who had a very successful Navy career up until that point and  was in
contention  for  Sailor  of  the  Year,  found  the  experience  very  demoralizing.
(SOR
Answer;  Tr.  26-30, 41-42) After  NJP, Applicant  was told  to  immediately  pack his bags
and was placed on a  flight to the shore command where his ship was homeported for
administrative board separation processing. (Tr. 42, 78-79)
[Note  –  MILPERSMAN  1910-233  prescribes  when  mandatory  separation
processing is required: “a. Sexual Misconduct – Lewd and lascivious acts,
rape,  sexual  assault,  stalking,  forcible  sodomy,  child  sexual  abuse,
possession  or  distribution  of  child  pornography,  incestuous  relationships,
or  any  sexual  misconduct  that  could  be  charged  as  a  violation  of  or  an
attempt  to  violate  reference  (a)  articles  120,  120a,  120b,  or  120c  [of  the
UCMJ]; or equivalent criminal statute as a result of either misconduct due
to commission of a serious offense or civilian conviction.…”]
However,  mandatory  processing  does  not  equate  to  mandatory  separation.  An
appropriate determination is made on each case based on its own merits.
On  February  6,  2020,  Applicant  appealed  his  NJP  to  the  officer  exercising
general  court-martial  jurisdiction  (OEGCMJ).  In  his  appeal,  Applicant  provided  alibis
with  corroborating  evidence  that  contradicted  the  statements  of  the  complaining
witnesses. Also included in Applicant’s appeal is a statement from a female sailor from
his  ship  who  was  familiar  with  the  complaining  parties.  She  stated  that  FS1  and  FS2
had to “change their stories so it would make sense” after Applicant produced credible
alibis  contradicting  as  to  when  the  incidents  in  question  took  place.  She  added  that
“[FS1] and [FS2] wanted to get off of the ship, by any means also. Whether it was to get
pregnant,  accuse  someone  of  something  or  to  get  “hurt”.”  See  NJP  appeal.  (SOR
Answer; GE 2; Tr. 42-44)
The  shore  command  where  Applicant’s  ship  was  homeported  convened  an
administrative  board  in  April  2020.  In  contrast  to  his  NJP,  Applicant  was  afforded
greater due process rights to include having appointed counsel to represent him and the
right to call witnesses. Applicant was informed that his NJP appeal was denied by the
OEGCMJ, “probably 15 minutes before the board (convened) that the Admiral said that
the  CO  was  in  the  best  position  to  make  that  decision,  so  she  (the  Admiral)  denied  it
(NJP appeal).” (Tr. 44-46, 79)
Due  to  Covid-related  restrictions,  in  person  board  witnesses  were  not  allowed
and  witness  testimony  was  to  be  provided  by  telephone.  Applicant  stated,  “I  was
actually notified like two minutes before we walked in that [FS3] recanted her statement.
She  wouldn’t  be  calling  in.  [FS2]  wrote  a  letter.  She’s  not  going  to  be  calling  in.
Applicant  stated  that  he  did  not  see  the  contents  of  the  letter.  And  [FS1]  would  be
calling  in.”  He  further stated  during  her  testimony,  FS1  denied  that  she  said  Applicant
“came into the shower,”  which is contrary to her statement to NCIS. (Tr. 46-48, 59-63,
68-69, 71, 80)
Using  a  preponderance  of  evidence  standard,  the  following  summarizes  the
findings and recommendation of the three-member board:
is  binding  on
[Note:  MILPERSMAN  1910-514  describes  what
administrative  boards:  “1.  Policy  a.  When  processing  includes  (1)  any
court-martial conviction; (2) a civilian conviction, or finding tantamount to a
finding of guilty by a civil court system; or (3) an approved diagnosis of a
medical officer; the board may not render its own findings because these
matters  have  already  been  judicially/medically  determined  to  have
occurred. b.  Unless there are additional reasons for separation, the board
will proceed directly to the separation/retention recommendation phase of
the hearing. c.  The only exception is civil conviction from a foreign nation,
which is not binding on administrative boards.” A prior NJP is not listed as
binding on administrative boards.
Board findings  - (1) UCMJ, Article  92,  1: comments of  a  sexual nature creating
hostile  work environment: 3-0 supports  allegation; (2) UCMJ, Article  92, Specification
2: sexual harassment,  physical touching: 3-0  does  not support allegation; (3) UCMJ,
Article   92,   Specification   3:  sexual  harassment,   sending   lewd   photo:  3-0   supports
allegation;  (4) UCMJ, Article  92, Specification  4:  sexual  harassment,  physical  touching:
3-0   does   not   support  allegation;  (5)   UCMJ,  Article   92,   Specification   5:  sexual
harassment,  physical  touching:  3-0   does   not   support  allegation;  (6)  UCMJ,  Article
128,  Specification   1:   sexual  assault,  physical  touching:   3-0   does   not   support
allegation;  (7) UCMJ,  Article  128,  Specification  2:  sexual assault,  physical  touching: 3-
0  does  not  support allegation; (8)  UCMJ Article  128, Specification  3: sexual assault,
physical  touching:  3-0  does  not  support  allegation;  and  (9)  UCMJ,  Article  134,
Specification  1:  indecent  conduct,  watching  SVM  undress:  3-0  does  not  support
allegation.  The  Article  107  NJP  charges  were  not  considered  at  Applicant’s
administration  board.  (Tr.  84)  The  board  noted  in  their  findings  that  the  specific
evidence they considered were: (1) NJP admission of guilt; (2) NCIS interviews; and (3)
text messages. (SOR Answer)
Board Recommendation (Separation or retention):
By a vote of 2-1, the board recommended that Applicant be retained. In their
comments,  the  board  noted  that  the  substantiated  allegations  referred  to  the  female
sailor’s complaint regarding Applicant’s inadvertently sending a lewd photo a year and
one  half  before  complaints  were  filed  by  FS1,  FS2,  and  FS3.  The  lewd  comment
referred to a comment Applicant made to a male sailor well before the complaint filed by
the three female complainants. (SOR Answer; Tr. 48-50)
Prior  to  this  incident,  Applicant  had  never  been  accused  of  sexual  harassment,
sexual assault, or been the subject of an Equal Employment Opportunity investigation.
Before the NJP in question, he had never been to NJP. (Tr. 71-72, 80-81)
Applicant was quite relieved and felt vindicated by the board results. Post-board,
he  performed  duties  as  directed  at  the  shore  command  pending  final  review  of  the
board results by the Bureau of Naval Personal (BUPERS). (Tr. 50-51) On December 22,
2020,  Applicant  was notified  by his chain of command that  he  would  be discharged  in
January  2021,  discussed  supra.  Post-Navy,  Applicant  had  to  adjust  to  civilian  life  and
considered  his  options  to  include  attending  school  and  finding  a  new  career,  being
mindful of his obligation to his wife and two minor children. (Tr. 51-56, 81-82)
Character Evidence
Applicant submitted six character letters, all from women: (1) an active duty Navy
lieutenant  and  former  first  class  petty  officer  and  supervisor;  (2)  a  Government
contractor, former first class petty officer and Navy veteran, and friend of Applicant and
his wife; (3) an active duty Navy ensign who was the ship’s administration leading petty
officer; (4) a retired senior chief petty officer and former supervisor/mentor; (5) an active
duty Navy lieutenant (junior grade) and Applicant’s division officer and who was present
at his NJP; and (6) an active duty first class petty officer, who a member of the ship’s
administrative  division  and  was  present  at  his  NJP.  The  majority  of  these  character
references  have  first-hand  knowledge  of  the  charges  against  Applicant.  All  of  the
references lauded Applicant’s professionalism, character, and integrity. They all support
him being granted a clearance. (Tr. 84-87; AE A - F)
Applicant  submitted  his  Evaluation  Report(s)  &  Counseling  Record(s)  spanning
his Navy career. His evaluations document sustained above average performance and
are  indicative  of  a  sailor  on  an  upward  trajectory.  (AE  G  –  S)  His  personal  awards
include  three  Navy  and  Marine  Corps  Achievements  Medals  as  well  as  numerous
decorations  and  campaign  ribbons.  He  qualified  as  an  Enlisted  Surface  Warfare

When Applicant was solely a Chinese citizen, he held two Chinese passports that
were  issued  to  him  in  China  in  1995  and  1999,  and  which  expired  in  1997  and  2009,
respectively. When he became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2008, he was issued a U.S.
passport  that  expired  in  2018.  He  was  subsequently  issued  another  U.S.  passport  in
2018, and it is not scheduled to expire until 2028. In 2017, he obtained a Chinese visa
that  is  not  scheduled  to  expire  until  2027,  and  he  uses  this  visa,  along  with  his  U.S.

background investigation. (Tr. at 37-45, 89-90, 103-105, 107-108; GE 1-2; AE A, E, I, J)
Applicant’s  father-in-law  has  been  deceased  since  2021,  and  Applicant’s  78-
year-old mother-in-law is a Chinese citizen residing in China. (SOR ¶ 4.d) His mother-in-
law was a professor at a university before she retired in 2000. She receives a pension
from  the  Chinese  government  of  approximately  $750  USD  monthly.  She  owns  the
condominium  in  which she  lives, the value  of  which  Applicant  was unaware.  Applicant
expects that his mother-in-law’s home will be inherited by his spouse and his spouse’s
sibling  upon  his  mother-in-law’s  passing.  Applicant’s  spouse  talks  to  her  mother  daily,
and  Applicant  talks  to  his  mother-in-law  two  to  three  times  monthly.  She  visited
Applicant  and  his  spouse  in  the  United  States  twice.  He  and  his  spouse  last  saw  his
mother-in-law in 2017, when they traveled to China with their child to visit. His spouse
travels  to  China  on  her  own  to  visit  her  mother,  and  she  last  did  so  in  approximately
2018. Applicant’s mother-in-law is aware that he underwent a background investigation.

Applicant’s  brother,  age  51,  and  two  sisters,  ages  59  and  54,  are  Chinese
citizens;  his  brother  lives  in  Japan  and  his  sisters  live  in  China.  (SOR  ¶¶  4.b-4.c)
Applicant’s  brother  has  lived  in  Japan  since  2010,  and  his  spouse  lives  with  him.
Applicant’s  brother  is  a  cook  in  a  restaurant,  and  his  spouse  works  in  a  hotel.
Applicant’s  sisters  work  for  a  ceramics  company.  They  are  divorced.  Applicant’s  older
sister  and  her  adult  son,  who  was  recently  laid  off  from  an  automaker  factory,  live  on
occasion  with  their  mother  in  her  home,  and  Applicant’s  older  sister  is  the  primary
caregiver for their mother. When their mother had health issues in 2022, Applicant sent
his older sister approximately $2,300 USD to pay for their mother’s medical expenses;
he  also  sent  this  sister  approximately  $500  USD  to  help  her  as  she  cared  for  their
mother. In 2023, Applicant sent this sister approximately $1,025 USD so that she could
hire a part-time caretaker for their mother. He intends to continue to financially assist his
sister  as  necessary  in  the  future.  Applicant  maintains  in-person,  telephonic,  and
electronic contact with his brother and sisters. He sees his brother approximately once
every four to five years, when they visit their mother in China. He last saw his siblings in
China in 2019, when he traveled there to visit their mother. He talks by chat room to his
older sister once every two to three months, and to his brother and younger sister once
or  twice  a  year.  Applicant’s  siblings  are  aware  that  he  underwent  a  background
investigation. (Tr. at 44-59, 61, 69-70, 90-91, 104-107; GE 1-2; AE A, E, I, K, L, M)
During  his November 2018  background  interview, Applicant indicated  that he  has
contact with  a  high  school friend  in China.  Applicant  reaches out  to  this  friend  when  he
is  in   China   visiting   family.  Applicant   stated   in  his  October   2021   response   to
interrogatories that  when  he  saw this  friend  in  2014, the  friend  told  him  he  was a  “self-
employee and teach  a middle and high  school  Math one  to  one by  private.”  (GE  2)
Applicant traveled to China to visit his family in approximately 2009, 2011, 2012,
2014, 2017, and 2019. He also went to China in 2011 because his father passed away.
He  traveled  to  China  on  his  own  in  2011,  2012,  2014,  and  2019,  and  he  traveled  to
China with his spouse and child in 2017. He intends to continue to travel to China in the
future to visit his family there. He does not own property or have any bank accounts in
China. He estimated that the value of his home in the United States was $850,000, and
his  remaining  assets  in  the  United  States  were  $290,000.  Applicant  stated  in  his SCA
and indicated during his background interview that none of his family, or his high-school
friend,  are  affiliated  with  the  Chinese  government  or  military,  and  that  none  of  his
foreign contacts are aware that he is under consideration for a national security position.
Since approximately 2017, he donates to a nonprofit organization dedicated to exposing
the  evils  of  the  authoritarian  Chinese  Communist  Party  government  and  supporting
those seeking  freedom and human rights for China.  He stated,  “[The  United States] is
my  home.  This  is  where  I  belong.  I  will  never  ever  favor  China  over  the  country  that
[has] given me the chance to survive in freedom.” (Tr. at 64-65, 70-73, 88-90, 101-104,
107-108; AE AA-BB; GE 1-2)
In  October  2015,  Applicant’s  then-employer,  for  whom  he  had  been  working
since  2009,  terminated  him  from  employment  for  a  serious  violation  of  a  company
resource  directive,  after  he  inserted  a  personal  USB  hard  disk  containing  extensive
adult pornography into his work-issued computer in approximately August 2015. (SOR ¶
1.a, 1.b, 2.a, 3.a) As a result of Applicant’s action, his then-employer received an alarm
that  child  pornography  had  been  accessed.  (SOR  ¶  1.b,  1.b,  2.a,  3.a)  After  his  then-
employer  turned  the  matter  over  to  the  authorities,  the  county  sheriff’s  office
investigated   Applicant,  executed   a   search   warrant  at   his  residence   for   the   offense   of
child  pornography,  and  seized  numerous items of electronic and  digital media. He  was
not  arrested.  A  December   2016   letter  from   the   state’s  attorney   states,   “Forensic
analysis  of  the   items  seized   from   his  home   revealed   images   of   evidentiary  value.”   It
further  reflects  that  the   state   informed   Applicant  that  it   was  “willing   to   forego   a
prosecution   if   Applicant  forfeited   any  claim,  rights,   and   possessory  interest   in  the
offending  items.”  Applicant  was never charged  with  a  crime.  (Tr. at  73-88,  95-100,  108-
111, 113-114; GE  1-3;  AE A-D, F)
Applicant  denied   ever   viewing   child   pornography.  He   also   denied   accessing
illegal content on  his company computer. He  admitted  to  viewing  adult  pornography on
his  personal  computer  beginning   in  1995,  when   he   was  living   in  the   United   States
without  his then-spouse, and  he  saved  a  personal collection  of  it  onto  his personal USB
hard   disc.  He   stopped   viewing   and   downloading   adult  pornography  in  2000,  after  his
then-spouse  moved  to  the  United   States, and  he  had  not  accessed  his  USB  hard disc
containing   such   content  since   that   time.   In   2015,  when   he   used   his  USB   hard   disc   to
back  up   files  from   his  company  computer,   due   to   issues  with   company  laptops  dying,
software   crashing,  and   the   company’s   failure  to   provide   employees   with   storage
devices,   he   forgot  that  he   had   adult  pornography  on   his  USB   hard  disc.  He
acknowledged   that  he   should  have   used   an   empty  USB,  and   he   was  aware   of  the
company  policy  against   viewing   pornography  on   his work computer.  (Tr.  at  73-88,  95-
100, 108-111,  113-114; GE  1-3;  AE A-D, F)
Applicant had no previous  unfavorable incidents  with this employer, and he has
not  had  any  unfavorable  incidents  since,  to  include  with  his  current  employer.  He
expressed  remorse  for  his  actions  and  stated  that  he  learned  his  lesson  not  to  use  a
personal  device  on  his  company  computer  and  to  follow  company  policies.  He  also
stated  that  he  timely  completes  annual  training  with  his  employer,  and  he  follows  his
employer’s  policies  and  procedures.  (Tr.  at 73-88, 95-100,  108-111,  113-114;  GE  1-3;
AE A-D, F)
Applicant’s  manager,  and  coworker  since  2018,  described  Applicant  in  her
January 2022 letter, as a dedicated employee and  asset. A coworker of approximately
seven  years  also  described  him  as  a  hard-working  and  dedicated  employee.  Three
former  coworkers,  who  are  also  close  friends  of  Applicant,  attested  to  his  reliability,
trustworthiness,  and  work  ethic.  Applicant’s  spouse,  and  his  adult  child,  attested  to
Applicant’s  character,  describing  him  as  honest,  trustworthy,  personable,  and  a  good
family man. He received favorable performance evaluations from his employer in 2020
and 2021. (Tr. at 115-132; AE G, R-S, U-Y, CC, DD)
China
China  is  an  authoritarian  state  in  which  the  Chinese  Communist  Party  is  the
paramount  authority.  Communist  Party  members  hold  almost  all  top  government  and
security apparatus positions.
China has rapidly become more assertive, and it is the only competitor potentially
capable  of  combining  its  economic,  diplomatic,  military,  and  technological  power  to
mount  a  sustained  challenge  to  a  stable  and  open  international  system.  It  will  remain
the  top  threat  to  U.S.  technological  competitiveness  as  its  government  targets  key
sectors and proprietary commercial and military technology from the United States and
allied  companies  and  institutions.  It  uses  a  variety  of  tools,  from  public  investment  to
espionage, to advance its technological capabilities.
China’s National Intelligence Law of 2017 forms the baseline of the modern data
collection  regime,  and  compels  all  Chinese  firms  and  entities  to  support,  assist,  and
cooperate  with  Chinese  intelligence  services,  creating  a  legal  obligation  for  those
entities to turn over data collected abroad and domestically. It has expansive efforts in
place  to  acquire  U.S.  technology,  to  include  sensitive  trade  secrets  and  proprietary
information.
China’s  intelligence  services,  as  well  as  private  companies  and  other  entities,
frequently seek to exploit Chinese citizens or persons with family ties to China who can
use their insider access to corporate networks to steal secrets using removable media
devices or email. Most Chinese cyber operations against U.S. private industry that have
been  detected  are  focused  on  cleared  defense  contractors  or  information  technology
and  communications  firms  whose  products  and  services  support  government  and
private sector networks worldwide.
Multiple  U.S.  criminal  indictments  since  2015  involve  Chinese  nationals,
naturalized  U.S.  citizens  or  permanent  resident  aliens  from  China,  and  U.S.  citizens,
procuring  and  exporting  controlled  items  to China.  China’s  efforts to  acquire  sensitive,
dual-use,  or  military-grade  equipment  included  radiation  hardened  integrated  circuits,
monolithic microwave integrated circuits, accelerometers, gyroscopes, naval and marine
technologies,  syntactic
trade  secrets,  space  communications,  military
jamming  equipment,  dynamic  random-access  memory,  aviation
communication
technologies,  and  anti-submarine  warfare  technologies.  About  80%  of  all  economic
espionage prosecutions brought by the U.S. Department of Justice allege conduct that
would  benefit  the  Chinese  state,  and  there  is  at  least  some  nexus  to  China  in  around
60% of all trade secret theft cases.

The  U.S.  Department  of  State  reported  that  in  2021,  significant  human  rights
issues  in  China  included:  arbitrary  or  unlawful  killings,  forced  disappearances,  torture,
and  arbitrary  detention  by  the  Chinese  government;  harsh  and  life-threatening  prison
and  detention  conditions;  political  prisoners;  politically  motivated  reprisal  against
individuals  outside  the  country;  the  lack  of  an  independent  judiciary  and  Communist
Party  control  over  the  judicial  and  legal  system;  arbitrary  interference  with  privacy,
including  pervasive  and  intrusive  technical  surveillance  and  monitoring;  punishment  of
family  members  for  offenses  allegedly  committed  by  an  individual;  serious  restrictions
on free expression, the press, and the internet; serious restrictions on internet freedom;
substantial  interference  with  the  freedom  of  peaceful  assembly  and  freedom  of
association;  severe  restrictions  and  suppression  of  religious  freedom;  substantial
restrictions  on  freedom  of  movement;  refoulement  of  asylum  seekers  to  North  Korea;
the  inability  of  citizens  to  choose  their  government  peacefully  through  free  and  fair
elections;  serious  restrictions  on  political  participation;  serious  acts  of  government
corruption;  forced  sterilization  and  coerced  abortions;  trafficking  in  persons;  severe
restrictions on labor rights; and child labor. Since the imposition of the National Security
Law  on  June  30,  2020,  China  unilaterally  and  arbitrarily  exercises  police  and  security
power in Hong Kong.
In  2019,  China’s  response  to  terrorism  remained  difficult  to  distinguish  from  the
government’s  suppression  of  peaceful  activities  that  authorities  deemed  separatist  or
subversive in nature. Details about alleged terrorism-related incidents inside China were
difficulty  to  verify  due  to  a  lack  of  transparency  and  information  from  Chinese
authorities.  As  in  2018,  Chinese  officials  continued  to  claim  that  no  violent  terrorist
incidents  have  occurred  in  the  country  since  2016,  owing  to  the  government’s  “new
counter-extremism policies,” to justify Beijing’s repressive campaign in Xinjiang.
The  U.S. Department of  State  in  April 2022  rated  China  as Level 3: Reconsider
Travel to  China  and  Hong  Kong, due  to  arbitrary enforcement of local laws and  COVID-
19  related  restrictions, and  it ordered  the  departure  of non-emergency U.S. Government
employees   and   all   family  members  from   the   Consulate   General  Shanghai  consular
district,  due   to   a   surge   in  COVID-19   cases   and   the   impact  of   restrictions  related   to
China’s response.

"Applicant is a 32-year-old engineering technician employed by a DOD contractor
since January 2021. He earned an associate degree in January 2019. He has not been
married and has no children. (GE 1; AE A, G at 60; Tr. 29-30, 41, 59-62, 106, 110)
Applicant  served   in   the   United   States   Air   Force  from   March   2010   to   November
2020   and   was  discharged   under  other  than   honorable  conditions.   He   was   a   highly
qualified  airman  and  attained  the  rank of staff sergeant  (E-5). He  deployed  many  times
and  had  extensive  combat experience. He  was awarded  numerous medals,  awards  and
decorations including  the  Distinguished  Flying  Cross and  multiple  Air  Medals. He received
favorable   performance   evaluations,  and   successfully  completed   extensive  military
training and education. He  served honorably during his initial term  of service  from March

In October 2019, Applicant was charged with one sexual act and one attempted
sexual act upon a female airman, unlawful entry, and indecent exposure in violation of
Articles 80, 120, 120c, and 129 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). Those
charges were referred for trial by General Court-Martial in November 2019. On May 6,
2020,  he  entered  pleas  of  not  guilty  to  all  charges.  In  October  2020,  he  requested  a
“Discharge in Lieu of Trial by Court-Martial” pursuant to Air Force regulations. His request
was  approved in  November 2020,  and he was  discharged  under other than honorable
conditions. (Answer; AE G at 3-7, 10-17, 32-112; GE 1-3)
Sexual Behavior, Criminal Conduct, and Personal Conduct
The SOR alleges and cross-alleges sexual misconduct by Applicant (SOR ¶¶ 1.a,
1.b,  2.a,  and  3.a)  and  that  he  was  discharged  from  the  Air  Force  under  other  than
honorable conditions in lieu of trial by court-martial (SOR ¶¶ 2.b and 3.a). In his answer
to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  the  allegation  in  SOR  ¶  2.b  and  denied  all  other
allegations with explanation. His admission is incorporated herein as a finding of fact.
In April 2019, a complaining witness (CW1) told investigators that Applicant had
grabbed  her  waist  and  attempted  to  kiss  her  without  her  consent  in  about  June  2018.
(SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 2.a, 3.a) She stated the following. While socializing at a bar with members
of her new unit she met Applicant. When she went outside to smoke, Applicant followed
her.  He  asked  to  kiss  her,  and  she  replied,  “no,  we  work  together”  and  “no.”  He  then
“grabbed [her] around her waist and attempted to kiss her.” (AE H; GE 2 at 2) She put her
hands on his chest, pushed him away and he went back into the bar. She saw Applicant
around the squadron afterward but “[he] avoided her at all costs.” (AE H) She disclosed
this  incident  and  incidents  with  two  other  males  in  her  unit  to  her  supervisor  while
discussing reasons she wanted a transfer. (GE 2 at 2; AE H) After the hearing, Applicant
submitted a more detailed summary of CW1’s statement to  investigators reflecting  that
she  had  not  intended  to  report  the  incidents  with  Applicant  and  the  two  other  male
squadron  members,  and  only  wanted  to  better  inform  her  supervisor  why  she  thought
changing platforms was the right decision for her. (AE H)
Applicant  denied  that  he  groped  CW1,  grabbed  her  around  the  waist,  asked  or
attempted to kiss her, and did not recall any inappropriate physical contact or that CW1
pushed him. (Answer: AE G at 10-12; Tr. 35, 55-56) He said it was “possible” that they
hugged at the end of the evening in a show of friendship but did not  specifically recall
doing so. (Tr. 56) He confirmed that he first met CW1 on the evening in question. (Tr. 35,
48-49, 51, 111) He said that they were out with a group of friends but were “pretty much
just conversing amongst ourselves, talking, chatting, as well as like, the group was with
us but we were more chatting amongst ourselves.” (Tr. 35, 53) He did not recall how many
drinks he consumed that evening but said he had been socially drinking over a period of
several hours and probably drank several beers, and one or two cocktails. (Tr. 51-53) He
testified  that  when  CW1  went  outside  to  smoke  he  followed  her  because  “[he]  figured
we’d continue our conversation and also so she wouldn’t have to be standing out there
by herself.” (Tr. 54) He testified that they went back inside the bar together, rejoined their
colleagues, and went their separate ways at the end of the evening. (Tr. 35, 56-57) He
said that he and CW2 were in the same squadron for 10 months after the alleged incident
without tension between them, and that they  “had  different duties  in the  plane, but I’m
sure we flew together, deployed together and so on.” (Tr. 57) He did not recall any social
interaction with her after the June 2018 evening in the bar. (Tr. 62-63)
Applicant  challenged  the  veracity  of  CW1’s  allegations,  noting  that  she  waited
more than nine months to report the alleged incident and did so in support of her request
to  be  reassigned.  (AE  G  at  10-12;  Tr.  34-35,  55-56)  He  said  that  she  also  made
uncorroborated allegations that an airman texted her an unsolicited picture of his genitalia
and  that  another airman  inappropriately  touched  her  buttocks.  (AE  G  at  11,  101-103;  Tr.
128-129) He submitted  a  November 2021  letter from  Technical Sergeant  (TSgt) H, who
had  served  with  Applicant from  2015  to  2020  and  had  been  his roommate  from  late  2016
to  early 2020. TSgt H wrote  that  “I am  aware  of  the  allegations made  against  [Applicant]
and  I believe  them  to  be  false in nature. I believe  [Applicant]  fell  victim  to  someone  who
accused  multiple  other people  of similar allegations and  that [Applicant]  told the  whole
truth  during his testimonies.” (Answer at Ex. 9; AE  G at 91-92; Tr. 35) Applicant said that
he was not questioned by investigators about CW1’s allegations against him. (Tr. 58-63)
CW1’s  allegations   were  investigated   but  were  not   included   in   the   charges   preferred
against Applicant in October 2019  and  later referred  to  general court-martial. (AE  G  at
101-103; GE  2 at 1; Tr. 128-129)
In May 2019, investigators interviewed CW2, and she said that Applicant groped
and sexually assaulted her on March 1, 2019. (SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 2.a, 3.a) She provided the
following account to investigators. Applicant asked if he could stay at her residence after
a night out and she agreed. While in a taxi enroute to her residence she vomited. She fell
while exiting the vehicle at her residence, scraped her arm and dirtied her clothes. She
went to take a shower, and while removing her clothes, Applicant entered the bathroom
naked, grabbed her, and tried to pull her close. CW2 told him to stop, he then grabbed
her buttocks, pushed her close to a counter and tried to kiss her, while fondling and kissing
her breasts. She repeatedly told him to “stop” and “no” to which he replied, “[y]ou know
you want [to engage in sexual activity with me].” CW2’s roommate [Roommate] came out
of her room, encountered CW2 and Applicant, told him to leave and then escorted him
out of the residence. Applicant then repeatedly knocked on the door, rang the doorbell
and asked to come in to apologize. (GE 2 at 2)
Roommate’s statement to investigators is summarized as follows. In about March
2019 she saw an intoxicated CW2 leaning on a male later identified as Applicant at the
residence she shared with CW2. She then helped CW2 to the shower. CW2 told her that
“I don’t want [Applicant] here, we need to make him leave.” Roommate thanked Applicant
and asked him to leave, but he swiftly walked into the bathroom occupied by CW2 and
locked  the  door.  Roommate  heard  CW2  say,  “Hey  I’m  naked,  you  need  to  get  out.”
Seconds later the bathroom door opened, and Roommate saw CW2 attempting to cover
her naked body with a towel. Applicant ran out of the bathroom nude, covering his penis
with his hands, and then hid behind a Christmas tree. CW2 appeared sick and ran into
the  bathroom  to  vomit.  Applicant  swiftly  followed  her  and  locked  the  door.  Roommate
heard CW2 say, “I’m throwing up, don’t touch me. Go home.” Roommate then escorted
Applicant from the bathroom and outside the residence. CW2 later told Roommate that
“she never felt so close  [to] being raped,” and that Applicant had picked her up, placed
her on the counter, and attempted to perform oral sex on her. (GE 2 at 2)
Applicant  denied  any nonconsensual sexual behavior  with  CW2. He  specifically
denied groping CW2, grabbing her buttocks, fondling or kissing her breasts, attempting
to  perform  oral  sex  on  her,  telling  her  that  “[y]ou  know  you  want  [to  engage  in  sexual
activity with me].  He also testified that CW2’s statement to investigators was untruthful.
(Answer; Tr. 76-78, 83-84)
Applicant recounted the evening as follows. He and CW2 attended a colleague’s
promotion party and after several hours of drinking she asked him to stay the night at her
residence. (Answer; AE G at 105; Tr. 36, 66-68) He explained that he and CW2 had been
close friends since their deployment, that their relationship had been platonic prior to that
evening, and that he sometimes slept on her couch. (Tr. 36, 68-69) While in a taxi on the
way to CW2’s residence, the driver was concerned that CW2 might vomit, so the driver
stopped the vehicle and CW2 got out to vomit. Applicant did not recall seeing CW2 vomit
but because of concern for her safety, he exited the vehicle, helped her move away from
traffic, and watched for approaching vehicles. (Tr. 70-72, 117)
Applicant said that “[CW2] kind of stumbled [while exiting the taxi at her residence]
and I caught her . . . to prevent her from hitting her head or whatever . . .  I believe she
hit her knee or elbow or something like that, but nothing too severe.” (Tr. 72) He recounted
events at CW2’s residence as follows. She went to the bathroom alone after they entered
her residence. (Answer; AE G at 106; Tr. 73, 80) He met and spoke with Roommate for
several minutes and decided to go home. (Tr. 78-80, 117) When he went to say goodbye
to CW2, she opened the door naked and “invited [him] inside the bathroom [and] to join
her in  a  shower”. (Answer; AE G at 106; Tr. 37, 78-81, 83) They then mutually kissed,
and she helped him undress. (Answer; AE G at 106; Tr. 75-77, 80-81, 83) CW2 suggested
that  they  go  to  her bedroom  because  she  did  not  want  Roommate  to  hear  them  or to
judge her for engaging in sexual activity after her recent breakup. (Answer; AE G at 106;
Tr. 78-79) While naked and on their way to CW2’s bedroom they encountered Roommate,
who scolded them both about their behavior, so he and CW2 returned to the bathroom to
get their clothes. (Answer; AE G at 106; Tr. 36-40, 82-83) Roommate told him it was a
good idea to leave, and he agreed because CW2 “was sick and obviously drunk”. (Tr. 81-
82, 85, 120-121) He denied that Roommate told him to leave or forced him to leave. (Tr.
81-82)
After Applicant left  CW2’s residence, he  and CW2 exchanged the following text
messages.
Applicant:  Hey, your roommate said you wanted me out. I just wanted to
speak to you before tomorrow – I get that we were drunk and [stuff] but hope
you [contact me] tomorrow.
CW2: I was in the shower! Did you [taxi] home ok?
Applicant:  Yea – Sorry for being so forward – I was in the wrong and should
of recognized it – Hope if there’s any hard feelings we can chat tomorrow
or just brush it off as a drunk night
CW2: Dude we were both ducked (sic). Up lol. Make it home ok?
(AE G at 111)
Applicant explained that he sent the apologetic text because he didn’t want their
kissing and disrobing to negatively affect their friendship or  relationship at work. “And I
apologized in regards to kissing her as we were both colleagues and friends and I didn’t
want her to ruin things and be enemies. And since of her being a colleague I didn’t want
her to feel awkward in the future at work.” (Tr. 38) He also said that “[w]e were both drunk
and both decided to make a bad choice or maybe a choice that we might have regretted
as in affecting our friendship and such.” (Tr. 123) He thought that she had accepted his
explanation  based  upon  her  communications  that  night  and  later  that  weekend,  and
subsequent social interaction. (Tr. 38-39, 86-87, 122) Evidence of their social interaction
after the alleged misconduct included a photograph from about April 2019 that showed
19 people standing together in a social setting, eight of whom were positioned between
Applicant and CW2. (Answer; AE G at 113; Tr. 90-91, 114-116)
Applicant said that he did not know why CW2 or Roommate would lie about what
happened that night. (Tr. 77, 104) He claimed that CW2 and her boyfriend had broken up
less  than  a  week  earlier  and  believed  they  got  back  together  after  she  made  the
allegations against him. (Answer; AE G at 105; Tr. 91, 123-125) He said that there were
inconsistencies  between  CW2’s  and  Roommate’s  statements  reflected  in  other
documents  associated  with  the  court-martial  charges  but  did  not  specify  what  the
discrepancies were or submit corroborating documentary evidence. (Tr. 83-84) Applicant
did  not  provide  a  statement  to  investigators  or  any  testimony  regarding  CW2  or  her
allegations during the court-martial proceedings. (Tr. 84-85, 92-93)
Applicant estimated that he drank four to eight beers that evening. (Tr. 118-119)
He said that he felt the effects of the alcohol but “had full memory of the night [and] felt in
control of his faculties”. (Tr. 119-120) He saw CW2 drinking beer and shots but said she
“seemed coherent enough”, “was able to talk socially and interact”, “order [a taxi] on her
phone without any issues”, “was slightly drunk [but he] didn’t see anything abnormal or
different about it,” and that she was more drunk than him. (Tr. 69, 121)
Applicant admitted that he was discharged from the Air Force under Other Than
Honorable  Conditions  in  November  2020,  in  lieu  of  trial  by  court-martial  for  charges
preferred as a result of misconduct alleged in SOR ¶ 1.  (SOR ¶ 2.b, cross-alleged under
SOR  ¶  3.a)  In October 2019,  he  was  charged  with  one  sexual act  and  one  attempted
sexual  act  upon  CW2,  unlawful  entry  into  CW2’s  bathroom,  and  indecently  exposing
himself to CW2 and her Roommate in violation of Articles 80, 120, 120c, and 129, UCMJ.
Those  charges  were  referred  for trial  by  General  Court-Martial  in November 2019.  On
October  1,  2020,  Applicant  requested  a  Discharge  in  Lieu  of  Trial  by  Court-Martial
pursuant  to  Air  Force  Instruction  36-3208,  Chapter  4.  (AE  G  at  112)  His  request  was
submitted  after  consultation  with  his  military  and  civilian  attorneys  and  included
acknowledgments that he: (1) understood the elements of the offenses with which he was
charged; (2) had received a copy of the investigation; (3) was aware that his voluntary
request could result in an “other than honorable discharge,” and (4) that he was advised
of the “possible effects of discharge under these circumstances.” (Answer at Exhibit 29;
AE  G  at  112;  Tr.  94-95,  125-127)  His  request  did  not  include  an admission  of  guilt  or
statements of fact regarding the allegations or statements of CW2, Roommate or CW1.
(Answer at Exhibit 29; AE G at 112; Tr. 94-95) His request was approved by an Air Force
lieutenant general in November 2020 after consideration of supporting documents, and
the  recommendations  of  a  staff  judge  advocate  and  subordinate  commanders.  He
directed Applicant’s discharge be “Under Other than Honorable Conditions.” (Answer at
13-14; AE G at 37, 112; GE 3; Tr. 32)
Applicant  acknowledged  that  a  court-martial  conviction  could  have  resulted  in
imprisonment  and  a  punitive  discharge,  and  a  requirement  that  he  register  as  a  sex
offender.  He  testified  that  an  administrative  discharge  enabled  him  to  maintain  some
veteran’s benefits based upon his previous period of honorable service. He said that he
felt  confident  that  he  would  have  been  acquitted  had  the  case  proceeded  to  trial,  but
decided “the risk was not worth the reward[.]” (Answer; AE G at 36-37, 101-104, 112; Tr.
32, 39-40, 93-94, 101-103)
Alcohol Use
Applicant  acknowledged  that  “[b]oth  incidents  of  alleged  misconduct  revolved
around  alcohol,”  and  said  that  he  has  made  a  point  to  separate  himself  from  similar
situations and has surrounded himself with people that have his best interests in mind to
avoid future issues. (Tr. 129-131, 142-144) He said that prior to the allegations he would
drink about 10 beers, once or twice a week in part because of a culture of “socialization
through intoxication” viewed as critical to bonding with others in his unit, particularly those
with  shared  combat  experience.  (Tr.  43,  129-133)  He  has  significantly  modified  his
behavior  since  the  allegations  were  made.  He  abstained  from  drinking  alcoholic
beverages for approximately six months and has more recently consumed alcohol about
twice a month – usually five to six beers over a period of several hours. (Tr. 134-136) He
has not been referred for and has not sought or received counseling or treatment for his
alcohol use. (Tr. 129-131)
Character Evidence  and Credibility
Applicant  submitted  numerous
letters  of  recommendation  and  character
references from commissioned officers, non-commissioned officers and others including
his current supervisor, colleagues, friends, and neighbors that favorably commented on
his  honesty,  integrity,  trustworthiness,  judgment,  patriotism,  dependability,  work  ethic,
professionalism,  leadership,  handling  of  classified  information,  adherence  to  rules  and
regulations,  commitment  to  U.S.  national  security  and  his  mission,  and  superior
performance  in  combat  that  saved  lives  of  friendly  forces.  Many  of  the  letters  directly
recommend  or  support  approval  of  his  continued  access  to  classified  information.

"Applicant is a 68-year-old married man with four adult children. A previous marriage
from 1981 to 2015 ended in divorce. Applicant earned a GED in 1976, and is a veteran of
the U.S. Marine Corps, serving from 1976 to 1980. His discharge was honorable. Currently,
he works for a federal government contractor as a systems administrator. (GE 1 at 12, 28)
Between 1992 and 1994, Applicant molested his stepdaughter. The sexual abuse
occurred when she was a young teenager and did not end until she left home to go to
college. (Tr. 18) These episodes of sex abuse occurred approximately 24 to 48 times. (GE
4 at 32) Per Applicant, “while [he] did molest [his] then teenage daughter 28 years ago, it
was through inappropriately touching her and having her inappropriately touch me, not the
sexual molestation, as suggest[ed].” (Answer at 2)
Applicant’s  stepdaughter  did  not  report  the  abuse  while  a  child.  Shortly  after
attending  therapy  as an  adult,  she  confronted  Applicant,  then  told  her  mother.  Shortly
thereafter, in 2015, Applicant and his wife divorced. (Tr 28) Applicant contends that his
stepdaughter has since forgiven him, and that he will [n]ever fall prey to [this conduct]
again.” (Answer at 2) He has never attended any behavioral counseling. (Tr. 29) When
confronted by an investigative agent in March 2020 about this conduct, he initially denied
this activity occurred. (Tr. 29-30) He did not disclose the activity until asked a third time. He
lied about this conduct because he was embarrassed. (Tr. 30)
In  February  2012,  Applicant  was  terminated  from  his  employment  after  testing
positive for cocaine. (GE 4 at 13) He denies that he has ever used cocaine and contends
that the test result was unreliable because it was conducted at an unsanctioned health
clinic out of the country. (Answer at 2) Applicant was working out of the country at the time.
There is no additional record evidence of any additional failed drug tests, nor is there any
other evidence that Applicant may have used illegal drugs in the past.
Applicant has approximately $58,000 in delinquent debt. (Answer at 4) He attributes

Paragraph 1 - Guideline D, Sexual Behavior
Paragraph 2 – Guideline E, Personal Conduct
Under Guideline D (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 1.b) and cross-alleged under Guideline E (SOR
¶ 2.a), the Government alleged two incidents of inappropriate sexual conduct, both with
teenage female foreign exchange students. In SOR ¶ 1.a, the Government alleged that
Applicant is ineligible for clearance because of his past sexual behavior with regard to a
young  foreign-exchange  student.  The SOR also alleged that  in 2008  Applicant  had an
extramarital affair with an 18-year-old female whom he had previously hosted as a foreign
exchange student. (SOR ¶ 1.b). In his Answer, Applicant admitted both allegations with
explanations. (Answer at 1-2.)
SOR ¶ 1.a. The main allegations in this subparagraph are that in 2010 Applicant
inappropriately touched  a minor female and entered her bedroom in his house without
permission.  At  the  hearing,  Applicant  admitted  that  he  hosted  the  17-year-old  foreign
exchange student (the Complainant) in his home and that she was removed after about
seven weeks due to her complaints about his behavior. He denied that he engaged in any
misconduct. He admitted that the Complainant asked to be moved to a new family and
was removed from his home by the foreign exchange coordinator. She made this request
due   to   complaints   about   Applicant   that  he   characterized   as   “unfounded.”  The
Complainant  made  her claims with the local police and  the  police investigated. Applicant
testified that he cooperated  with the  police, and the police took no action.  (Tr. at  17-18.)
The Complainant submitted her charges to the police the day she moved out of
Applicant’s house. The police prepared an extensive report (GE 3). The report states that
she felt “very uncomfortable around  [Applicant].” Her first complaint was that  Applicant
stared at her body in a sexual manner. She reported that on a trip to an amusement park
with Applicant, his son, and a friend of the son, Applicant made inappropriate comments
to her about her body. Also, she went on a water ride wearing a white jumpsuit and got
wet,  which  made  her  outfit  transparent  revealing  her  body  and  undergarments.  She
claimed Applicant tried to take a picture of her in that condition. She also complained that
while swimming at the amusement park, he would swim underwater and grab her legs
and stomach. (GE 3 at 1.)
The  police  report contains numerous other complaints about Applicant’s actions
directed  at  the  Complainant.  She  reported  that  he  often  would  enter  her  bedroom
unannounced. He would lie on her floor, or on occasion, he would lie down next to her on
her bed to talk. He also tickled her almost daily. She also claimed that he once grabbed
her buttocks. On one occasion, she walked out of her bathroom and observed Applicant
standing  naked  in  front  of  his  bedroom  door.  She  complained  that  Applicant  would
frequently tap her on the buttocks with his hand or foot. She commented to the police that
Applicant is very friendly, but she was scared that “he will take  it to the next level.” She
reported to the police that Applicant’s wife was “very distant” and did not interact with her
at all. She felt so uncomfortable with Applicant’s behavior that she called her parents, and
they arranged for her to be removed from Applicant’s home and relocated to another host.
She lived at Applicant’s home from August 10, 2010, to September 17, 2010. The SOR
incorrectly  alleged
in  2011.  The
Complainant’s  parents  refused  to  permit  their daughter to  participate  in  a  “pretext  call”
proposed by the police to try to have Applicant say something incriminating to confirm her
allegations. They advised the police that their daughter was happy with her new host, and
they did not want her to be further involved with Applicant out of concern it would upset
her more. The police report concludes that the case was referred to the District Attorney’s
office  for  their  review  for  possible  criminal  charges  against  Applicant  for  annoying  or
molesting a child. (GE 3 at 3-4, 6-7, 9-10, 12-13, 16.)
that  Applicant’s  sexual  misconduct  occurred
At the hearing, Applicant denied all of the most serious allegations made by the
Complainant. He admitted, however, he did grab her leg while swimming under water at
the amusement park, just as he did with his son and the son’s friend. He also admitted
that on one occasion he sat of the end of her bed and another time laid down on the floor
to  talk  with  her.  On  another  occasion,  he  claimed  that  while  he  was  in  her  room,  she
invited him to lie on top of the covers of her bed while they talked. On cross-examination,
he admitted that this occurred at least twice, but he said she was under the bed covers.
He  acknowledged  that  he  made  a  mistake  by  retrieving  a  towel  from  a  hallway  closet
while he was unclothed after a shower. He later learned that she saw him from the rear.
He thought he  was being  discreet  and  was careful to  avoid being  seen. He also admitted
that he  hugged  her as well others in his family and  one time when she was sick, he  gave
her medicine  and  kissed  her on  the  forehead.  He  also  wrestled  with  her standing  up  as
he   did  while  playing   with   his  son.   Applicant  testified   that  he   thought  he   had   a   good
relationship  with  her and  was  surprised  when  she made  her  complaints to the  police.  He
believes she  misinterpreted  certain events when  she  lived  in his home,  and  he  asserted
that  he  never  touched  her in  an  inappropriate  way. He  also  claimed  that  the  Complainant
was  removed   from   other  host  homes  due   to   causing   problems   during   her  nine-month
exchange  student status in the  United  States. He also falsely stated  that after he  spoke
to   the   police,   the   police  determined   that  the   Complaint’s  claims  had   no   merit  and
dismissed  the  matter. On  cross-examination,  he  acknowledged  that he  was never told by
the   police   that  the   Complainant’s  charges  had   no   merit.   He  also  noted   that  his  family
hosted   seven   exchange   students   over  seven   years,  two   of  which   were   females,   the
Complainant and  an  exchange  student  with  whom  he  had  an  extramarital  affair  in  2008
after  her  exchange  year had  ended  and  she  had  turned  18  years old.  (SOR ¶  1.b,  below)
(Tr. at 18, 20, 22-24, 30-34,  39-40.)
SOR ¶ 1.b. The Government alleged in this subparagraph that in 2008 Applicant
had  an  18-month  extramarital  affair  with  an  18-year-old  German  woman  (the  German
Student), who had been hosted by Applicant as a foreign exchange student in 2006-2007.
She  was  16  or  17  years  old  at  that  time.  Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  treated  this
student with similar physical behaviors of touching and hugging during her school year
living at Applicant’s home. Applicant admitted this allegation in the Answer but noted that
the affair occurred 15 years ago and was not criminal in nature, presumably because of
her  age  at  that  time.  At  the  hearing,  Applicant  argued  that  the  affair  was  private,
consensual, and discreet. She was 18 years old, and he was 42. He acknowledged that
the  affair  was  wrong  and  asserted  he  has  not  done  anything  similar  since  then.  He
explained that they had remained in contact after her exchange student school year. In
2008 the German Student returned to visit Applicant, and she initiated an affair with him.
She only stayed in the United States for four weeks, but they continued the relationship
through electronic communications until 2010. (Answer at 2; Tr. at 26-28, 34-36; GE 2 at
7.)
Applicant testified that he ended the relationship with the German Student after six
months because he felt what he was doing was wrong. He claimed that he told his wife
some years later about it in the spirit of being honest with his wife. His disclosure of the
affair  occurred  sometime  after  the  Complainant’s  allegations  (SOR  ¶  1.a).  In  his
responses to DOHA’s interrogatories, Applicant noted that the disclosure of the affair to
his wife was in about 2014. He last communicated with the German Student in February
2021. She also sent him birthday greetings in July 2022 or 2023. (Tr. at 36-44; GE 2 at
7.)
Whole-Person Evidence
Applicant submitted two performance reviews and four character-reference letters.
The work evaluations state that Applicant is an invaluable member of his team and that
he  was  a  “Successful  Performer.”  His  character  references  praised  Applicant’s  strong
work ethic and friendly personality. They also remarked about his sound judgment. His
church minster commented that Applicant has a strong marriage and is a man of faith.
Two close friends wrote about Applicant’s integrity and sound values. (AE A through F.)

"In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  denied  SOR  ¶  1.a  and  the  two  cross-
allegations  (SOR  ¶¶  2.a  and  3.a).  He  also  provided  a  narrative  statement.  After  a
thorough  and  careful  review  of  the  pleadings  and  evidence  submitted,  I  make  the
following findings of fact.
Applicant is 41 years old. He has some college credits. He served in the military
in  the  1990s.  He  and  his  wife  have  been  married  since  1995.  They  have  two  grown
children. He has been employed with a defense contractor since 2008 and indicated on
his SCA that he has held a clearance since 2011. He lives in State 1.
In  March  2021,  City  1,  State  1  police  received  a  cyber  tip  from  the  National
Center  for  Missing  and  Exploited  Children  (NCMEC)  and  Google  regarding  possible
child  pornography  on  an  account  linked  to  Applicant.  His  name  and  e-mail  addresses
were on the account, and they were linked to an internet service provider (ISP) address
under  his  name  at  the  address  in  City  1,  State  1.  When  the  warrant  was  executed,
several family members were there but Applicant was not. He was contacted by police,
told  about  the  search  warrant,  and  was  requested  to  come  to  the  premises,  which  he
did. (Item 4 at 2)
Images downloaded via Applicant’s ISP address were deemed to be:
of  pubescent  minor[s]  and  prepubescent  minor[s]  in  lascivious  exhibition
and sex acts, sado-masochistic abuse, masturbation, breast nudity, [and]
genital  nudity.  The  minors  appeared  to  [range]  in  age  from  7-8  to  13-14.
(Item 4 at 2 (Police incident report))
This City 1 police incident report led to a search warrant signed and issued by a
judge.  The  warrant  was  executed  at  the  address,  which  led,  in  turn,  to  Applicant’s
detention  and  interview  at  the  police  station.  His  cell  phones  were  secured.  He  was
given a Miranda warning and waived his rights and agreed to speak to police. (Item 4)
Applicant  confirmed  his  name,  date  of  birth,  phone  number,  ISP,  and  three
separate  email  addresses.  He  denied  being  “into  kiddy  porn.”  He  was  asked  about
specific photos with  sexually explicit  descriptions  referencing  girls aged  9, 11,  and  12.
According to the police report, Applicant said he “would download it to see what it was
and then delete it.” (Item 4 at 3)
Applicant  was  then  placed  under arrest.  Forensic  examination  revealed  that his
phone  contained  file  names  that  matched  the  cyber  tips  from  the  NCMEC,  and
Applicant’s  name  and  one  of  his  e-mail  addresses.  Another  search  warrant  was  then
executed at the home. (Item 4 at 3-4)
On   his  SCA,   Applicant  reported   that   he   lived   at  the   address  in   question   from
about  May 2007  to  about December  2020  “until  my  father’s health  declined.”  (Item  3  at
9)   He  disclosed   the   arrest   on   his  July  2021   SCA.  He  noted   that   the   case   remained
pending  action  from  a  grand  jury. He  also  said, “there was  a  tip  from  Google that  some
obscene  photos  were downloaded  to  my router. My account  has  been  hacked  multiple
times  and  there  is no  evidence  other  than  a  tip  from  Google.”  He said he  had  informed
his employer’s  security office. (Item  3 at 27)
In  September  2021,  Applicant  had  a  background  interview  relating  to  his
clearance  application.  In  discussing  his  April  2021  arrest,  he  asserted  that  his  Gmail
account  had  been  hacked  many  times  during  2020  and  early  2021.  At  the  time  of  the
warrant,  his  daughter  and  her  fiancé  lived  at  the  residence  in  question  with  their  new
baby. He said his lawyer had explained that he had been charged because the Google
tip  had  been  traced  to  a  modem  and  IP  address  that  was  registered  in  his  name.
Applicant acknowledged that he paid for the internet service in the home. (Item 7 at 3-5)
In discussing the police interview, Applicant said he denied downloading anything
inappropriate.  He  said  anyone  at  the  home,  such  as  his  daughter,  her  fiancé,  or  any
visitors,  would  be  able  to  access  the  Wi-Fi  network  even  though  it  was  password
protected. He was told by police that the downloads occurred in December 2020, which
was  right  when  he  moved  out  of  the  home  and  allowed  his  daughter  and  fiancé  and
their new baby to move in. He was caring for his father who was in poor health and in
hospice  care.  (Item  7  at  3-4)  (On  his  July  2021  SCA,  Applicant  listed  his  father  as
deceased).
In March 2022, Applicant answered an interrogatory from the DOD CAF. Grand
jury  action  on  his  case  remained  pending.  Applicant  said  he  had  “never  downloaded
anything that was known to be illegal.” He said his grandson (12 years old at the time of
the warrant) “used to play on my phone and computer often.” (Item 5 at 2)
In discussing his police interview, Applicant said he told the police that “I had not
downloaded anything like that on my devices. I did admit that I have downloaded normal
adult pornography sometimes and that if anything was ever questionable it was deleted
immediately to remove any question.” He also said that due to his family history, he had
“zero tolerance for people doing anything with children.” (Item 5 at 3)
On  January  26,  2023,  Applicant  pled  guilty  to  the  offense  charged,  i.e.,
possession  of  obscene  matter.  Applicant  was  sentenced  to  a  10-year  jail  term,  to  be
suspended for two years, with Applicant placed on two years of probation. He was fined
and  ordered  to  pay  fees  and  court  costs.  He  was  also  required  to  register  as  a  sex
offender under the State 1 Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act. (Item 6)
In addressing the SOR allegations in his Answer, Applicant said he “was not the
one that committed the infractions listed.”  His daughter and her fiancé had moved into
the  home  with  his  son  and  two  daughters.  He  asserted  that  the  fiancé’s  son  “had
downloaded pictures on  my phone that he had found on Twitter, Instagram, and other
such  sites.”  Applicant  had  confirmed  to  the  police  that  Applicant  had  previously
downloaded  adult  images  “on  commercial,  age-verified  sites”  (i.e.,  adult  pornography)
but he denied downloading child images (i.e., child pornography). He asserted that this
was because his wife had previously been sexually assaulted by a family member and
that he is protective of his wife and daughters. He asserted that his daughter’s fiancé’s
12-year-old son had admitted downloading the images. (Answer)
Applicant  asserted  that  he  pled  guilty  because  there  was  a  guarantee  of  no
prison time, and no further action would be taken. A trial would risk the jury that “would
want to go after him just based off of the charges” and the risk that he would be seen to
be “trying to throw [his grandson] under the bus to stay out of trouble.” (Answer)
In  his  FORM  Response,  Applicant  again  said  that  “I  never  downloaded  any
material  such  as  I  was  accused.”  He  acknowledged  downloading  adult  pornography
from  age-verified  sites  and  he  would  delete  any  images  of  any  females  who  looked
younger  (16-18).  He  said  he  would  never  download  “something  that  was  of  a  child.”
(i.e.,  child  pornographic  images).  He  asserted  that  during  the  investigation  he  was
concerned  that  it  may  have  been  his  son-in-law  or  grandson  (then  age  12)  who  had
downloaded  the  images,  and  that  the  grandson  admitted  weeks  later  that  he  had
downloaded the images but deleted them for fear of getting into trouble. Applicant said
he  took  a  plea  because  of  the  risk  of  jail  time  and  of  possible  charges  against  his
grandson. (FORM Response)
Applicant acknowledged that it was his responsibility and that of his son-in-law to
monitor what Applicant’s grandson was doing on the devices. Applicant asserted that he
is not vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress, in part because he took the plea.
His supervisor and security department are aware of the charges and said they cannot
be used against him. (FORM Response)
Applicant asserted that he can be trusted. He has worked for his employer for 15
years, mostly with a clearance. He served in the military and has never had a security
violation. (FORM Response)
Applicant’s FORM Response included letters from his wife and his mother, and a
joint letter from his daughter and her fiancé. (AE B – AE D) The grandson’s parents said
they recently found out that their son had downloaded some inappropriate materials on
Applicant’s Google account. They talked to their son about “why it wasn’t ok to do that.”
They said Applicant did not want any “backlash” to happen to their son, so he took the
blame.  Applicant  is  a  “great  man.”  His  daughter  insists  Applicant  would  not  take
advantage of any minor over the internet. (AE D)
Applicant’s mother asserted that he never showed interest in younger females in
his  “formative  years.”  He  always  dated  older  women.  He  detests  people  who  mistreat
women and children. (AE C) Applicant’s wife offered a “guarantee [that] he has not done
what he is accused of.” He is the protector of the family and when their adult daughters
were young, he refused to change them, bathe them, or be alone with them.” She trusts
him around any child. She believes their grandson downloaded the material and thought
he had deleted everything. (AE B)
A  manager  at  Applicant’s  employer  has  known  him  for  four  years.  Applicant
possesses  integrity  and  has  healthy  boundaries.  He  is  trustworthy,  reliable,  and
concerned for the well-being of others. He is an asset to the organization. (AE A)

"Applicant is 33  years old. He  has never married, but he  is presently engaged. He
has no  children.  He attended  a  U.S. military academy (the  Academy) from  June  2009  to
November  2011.  He  played   football   at  the   Academy.  He   was  dismissed   from   the
Academy  before  he  had  earned  a  degree. In  April 2017,  he  completed  his undergraduate
courses  and   received   a   bachelor’s  degree   at  another   university.   He  also  earned   a
master’s  degree   in  October  2020.  He  has  worked   as  an   engineer  since   2017,  most
recently  as  a   systems   engineer  for  a   U.S.  Government  contractor.  He  seeks  national
security eligibility in connection  with  his  employment.  He  was denied  eligibility by another

Paragraph 1  (Guideline  J, Criminal Conduct)
In the Answer, Applicant admitted “with clarifications” each of the five allegations
under this guideline. The record evidence supports the following findings with respect to
the matters alleged in paragraph 1 of the SOR:
1.a. March 2019  Arrest for Attempted  Assault, Resisting  Arrest,  Obstruction  of a
Police  Officer, and  Assault or Battery. Applicant engaged in a dispute with a driver from
a ride-share company (the Driver) after a night in a bar with friends. Applicant and his
friends were arguing with each other over where the Driver should go first.  The Driver
pulled over and asked the occupants to get out of his car. Applicant got out of the car and
proceeded to punch the Driver in his left cheek with a closed fist through the open window.
Applicant and his friends entered a nearby hotel. The Driver called the police, and upon
arrival  at  the  scene,  the  police  interviewed  the  Driver.  He  provided  the  police  with  a
description of Applicant’s assault and advised that Applicant and his friends had entered
a hotel across the street. At the DOHA hearing, Applicant denied that he punched the
Driver in the face. He also claimed it was the Driver who was being aggressive, and it
was Applicant who demanded the Driver to pull over and let the group leave the car so
they could find another ride to their homes. (Tr. at 15, 51; GE 4 at 1; GE 5 at 1-10.)
The police entered the hotel and identified Applicant by the Driver’s description of
him. The police attempted to question Applicant about the dispute. Applicant declined to
respond,  even  refusing  to  provide  his  name  and  identification  card.  He  testified  at  the
DOHA  hearing  that  he  was  unaware  that  he  was  required  to  provide  his  name  and
identification  to  the  police.  The  police  asked  Applicant  to  provide  his  side  of  the  story
regarding his interactions with the Driver. He refused to speak and told his friends to “shut
up.” The police further advised Applicant that he would not be allowed to leave without
properly identifying himself. He again refused. At the hearing, Applicant justified his lack
of cooperation with the police by testifying “there was a lot of racial things going on in the
nation,  and  I  didn’t  want  to  be  involved  or  be  one  of  them.”  He  also  claimed  he  was
unaware of the reason why the police were asking him questions. He was placed under
arrest for assaulting the Driver. He continued to refuse police orders and actively refused
to put his hands behind his back so that he could be handcuffed. He was so strong that
the police could not undo his grip on his hands in front of him. He continued to resist all
instructions from the police, even after being told he would be pepper sprayed in the face
if  he  did  not  cooperate.  He  was  then  pepper  sprayed  and  handcuffed  with  his  hands
behind his back. He refused to walk to the police vehicle, and due to his large size, four
police officers had to carry him to the vehicle. He further resisted the officers attempt to
have him sit in the vehicle. Instead, he laid on the back seat with his feet hanging outside
the door preventing it from closing. (Tr. at 14-17, 51-55; GE 2 at 8-9; GE 3 at 10-11; GE
4 at 1; GE 5 at 1-10.)
The  police  determined  that  based  upon  the  Driver’s  statement  regarding  the
incident that they had probable cause to arrest Applicant for assault. They also concluded
that they had probable cause to arrest him for resisting arrest/obstructing a police officer.
He was charged with those two misdemeanor offenses. Applicant’s version of the incident
with the Driver was unpersuasive, and his demeanor throughout his testimony regarding
his interaction with the police further undercut the credibility of his testimony. Moreover,
Applicant’s  behavior  was  totally  at  odds  with  his  stated  concern  about  the  police
overreacting and using excessive force against him. In reality, his behavior reflected his
abuse of alcohol that evening, which would explain why the criminal trial judge ordered
Applicant  to  abstain  from  consuming  alcohol  for  90  days  as  part  of  his  agreement  to
dismiss the charges. (Tr. at 14-17, 51-55; GE 2 at 8-9; GE 3 at 10-11; GE 4 at 1; GE 5 at
1-10.)
1.b.  January 2013  Arrest for Abusive Sexual Conduct in  Violation  of the  Uniform
Code  of Military Justice  (UCMJ) Article 120. On or about May 14, 2011, Applicant, others
from the Academy, and a female civilian (the Civilian) were together drinking alcohol at a
night club. The group then went to a hotel room to continue drinking alcohol. The Civilian
was intoxicated and laid down on a bed in the room. She then fell asleep. When Applicant
and the Civilian were later alone in the room, Applicant laid down on the bed next to The
Civilian and touch her genitals through her underwear. The Civilian awoke and told him
to stop several times, which he did briefly. He continued to arouse himself against her
body and eventually ejaculated. The next day the Civilian filed a sexual assault complaint
with the local police, though she did not know Applicant’s identity. She received medical
attention, and it was noted that there were bruises on her thigh. Also, Applicant’s DNA
was found on her back. She subsequently identified Applicant when she saw his picture
on  a  television  show  in  connection  with  other  sexual  assaults.  The  local  police  ceded
primary  jurisdiction  over  the  investigation  and  charges  to  the  Academy.  Applicant  was
charged with violating Article 120 of the UCMJ. At the June 2012 courts-martial described
in SOR ¶ 1.c, Applicant was found not guilty of this charge. (Tr. at 17, 46-48; GE 6 at 2,
4; GE 10 at 1-2.)
1.c.  June  2012  Court-Martial Trial and  Conviction  for Violations of UCMJ Articles
80,  120,  and  128.  In June 2012, Applicant was court-martialed for the conduct set forth in
SOR ¶¶ 1.b, 1.d and 1.e. He was charged with violating Articles 80, 120, and 128 of the
UCMJ, and he was convicted on the specifications relating to the incidents alleged in SOR
¶¶  1.d  and  1.e.  Applicant  was  sentenced  to  dismissal  from  the  service,  six  months  of
confinement, and forfeiture  of all pay and allowances.  A punitive dismissal  is the legal
term for the dishonorable discharge of an officer or academy cadet. He appealed and his
conviction was upheld by the Court of Criminal Appeals for his branch of the military. He
was dismissed from the Academy. (Tr. at 21-22, 44; GE 6 at 1-2; GE 7; GE 8; GE 12.)
1.d.   December  2011   Arrest  for  Wrongful  Sexual   Contact   in  violation   of   UCMJ
Article 120. In November 2011, Applicant was investigated for a sexual assault involving
a  female  classmate  (the  Classmate)  that  occurred  in  about  March  2011  in  Applicant’s
dorm room at the Academy. He, two male classmates, and the Classmate spent several
hours drinking alcohol and playing cards late at night. He met the Classmate for the first
time that evening. The Classmate  became intoxicated and vomited. She fell asleep on
the  bed  of  Applicant’s  roommate.  The  male  classmates  left  the  room  to  return  to  their
rooms, leaving Applicant alone with the Classmate, who was asleep. Applicant was highly
intoxicated. Applicant pulled his pants and underwear down to midthigh. The Classmate
felt Applicant entering the bed in which she was sleeping and lie behind her, pressing his
body against hers. He then took her hand and rubbed it against his genitals. After a few
seconds, she was coherent enough to realize what Applicant was doing and pulled her
hand away. She then vomited again. He claimed at the DOHA hearing that he stopped
his sexual actions when she told him to stop. Applicant testified at the DOHA hearing that
he was wrong to make the Classmate feel “uncomfortable.” Applicant was charged and
convicted  of  Wrongful  Sexual  Conduct  in  violation  of  Article  120  of  the  UCMJ.  His
conviction was upheld on appeal.  Applicant did not acknowledge that his conduct was
criminal. (Tr. at 22-24, 45-46, 50-51; GE 7 at 3; GE 9 at 2, 8.)
1.e. November 2011  Arrest for Assault by Battery and  Attempted  Sexual Contact
in violation  of  Articles  128  and  120,  respectively, of the  UCMJ. After a night of drinking
alcohol  at  a  bar  in  November  2011,  Applicant  returned  to  the  Academy  campus  with
friends from the Academy, including a former classmate (FC) who had passed out in the
bathroom  of  the  bar.  FC  had  no  memory  of  what  happened  after  she  passed  out.
Applicant and his friends carried FC to a dormitory room. The classmates left Applicant
and  FC  alone  in  the  room,  and  he  locked  the  door.  The  classmates  returned  and
demanded  that Applicant open  the  door. An  altercation  ensued  between  the  classmates
and  Applicant when  the  classmates found  the  lights were  off  in the  room. The  classmates
found   FC   unresponsive  with   her jeans   unbuttoned   unzipped   and  her shirt  pulled   up   to
chest  level.  An  ambulance  was  called,  and  FC  was taken  to  a  hospital. In  the  investigation
of the  incident, Applicant denied  that he  touched  FC, but claimed he was too  intoxicated
to   be   certain.  He   admitted   that  he   kissed   her  earlier  in  the   evening   while   she   was
incoherent.  His overall  version  of the  events  that  evening  developed  in  the  investigation
significantly   differed   in   critical  details  from   the   appellate   court’s  recitation   of  the   facts
developed  at the  court-martial. At one  point, Applicant  provided  a  statement in which  he
acknowledged   getting   into   bed   with   FC,   who   was   passed   out.   He   commented   that   “I
strongly  believe   its   possible”  that  he   unbuttoned   FC’s  jeans,  “but  I   am   not  100%  sure
because I cannot recall those events.” At the  DOHA hearing, Applicant denied he kissed
FC   and   he   otherwise  did  not  recall   what  he   did  with   FC   that  evening.   Applicant  was
charged  and  convicted  of  punching  both  classmates and  choking  one of them.  Applicant
was  also   charged   with   and   convicted   of   unwanted   sexual   conduct  with   FC,  including
kissing  her when  she  was incoherent. His convictions under  UCMJ Articles 80  and  128
were  upheld  on  appeal. See  SOR ¶ 1.c,  infra. (Tr. at 17-20, 41-45,  50-51;  GE  6  at  1-2;
GE 7  at 2; GE 8  at 2, 3.)
Paragraph 2 (Guideline  D, Sexual Behavior)
In the Answer, Applicant admitted with clarifications the two allegations under this
guideline. The record evidence supports the following findings with respect to the matters
alleged in paragraph 2 of the SOR:
2.a.  The  SOR  cross  alleges  SOR  ¶¶  1.b  through  1.e  under  Guideline  D  in  this
subparagraph.
2.b.  Current  registration  as  a  Sex  Offender in  State  1.  Applicant was required to
register as a Sex Offender as a result of his court-martial convictions. He registered in
State 1 on June 22, 2012, and his registration requirement expires on June 22, 2027. He
claimed at the hearing that, due to a change in the laws of State 1, he was eligible to have
his name removed from the registration list at that time.  (Tr. at 25, 57; GE 3 at 7.)
Paragraph 3  (Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption)
In the Answer, Applicant admitted with clarifications the two allegations under this
guideline. The record evidence supports the following findings with respect to the matters
alleged in paragraph 3 of the SOR:
3.a. Alcohol Consumption during  the  period  October 2011 to at least March 2019.
All of Applicant’s criminal conduct alleged in paragraph 1 of the SOR was preceded by
his  significant  use  of  alcohol  resulting  in  his  intoxication.  At  the  hearing,  Applicant
admitted that he, at times, consumed alcohol in excess during the period alleged, but not
during the entire period. (Tr. at 25-26, 50.)
3.b. April 2019  Alcohol  Counseling. Applicant testified that he was ordered, by the
court  in  the  criminal  case  arising  from  his  March  2019  arrest,  to  abstain  from  drinking
alcohol for 90 days. He stated that he complied with this court order. Applicant claimed
that  his  participation  in  the  counseling  class  was  voluntary  and  that  he  completed  the
counseling. In a letter addressed to Applicant’s criminal defense attorney, dated April 29,
2019, the alcohol counselor wrote that Applicant “appeared to accept responsibility for his
behavior [on the day of his March 2019 arrest.]” The counselor noted that Applicant had
decided  to  abstain  from  any  further  use  of  alcohol  effective  the  night  of  his  arrest.
Applicant attended four individual counseling sessions. This letter was submitted to the
court.  At  the  DOHA  hearing,  Applicant  testified  that  he  no  longer drinks  alcohol to  the
extent he used to drink before his 2019 arrest. He refined his comment about his drinking
habits to say that he only consumes alcohol on rare occasions, such as at a wedding.
(Answer at 6; Tr. at 26-27, 33-34, 56; AE A.)
Paragraph 4  (Guideline E, Personal Conduct)
In the Answer, Applicant admitted with clarifications the single allegation under this
guideline.  The  SOR  cross  alleges  SOR  ¶¶  1.a.  through  1.e  under  Guideline  E  in  this
paragraph.
Mitigation and Whole-Person Evidence
Applicant provided extensive evidence in mitigation and in support of a favorable
whole-person  assessment.  I  have  carefully  reviewed  all  of  the  evidence  and  note  the
following specific items:
Applicant provided a written statement of his intent to  modify his drinking habits
and attend counseling.  He also  wrote that he  understood  that any inappropriate future
involvement  with  alcohol  may  be  grounds  for  the  revocation  of  his  national  security
eligibility, if granted to him. Applicant provided no evidence of any alcohol counseling or
treatment subsequent to the four sessions in March and April 2019.
In addition, Applicant provided six character-reference letters. A former classmate
at  the  Academy  wrote  a  letter  prior  to  Applicant’s  2019  arrest  praising  Applicant’s
“determination and perseverance  to  reach  his  goal of  becoming  an  engineer.”  He also
wrote that he has been impressed by Applicant’s “unwavering devotion to overcoming his
past.” In an undated letter, Applicant’s former girlfriend praised his character and “ability
to be respectful.” She commented that Applicant “did not allow his past to determine who
he is, and it is not an accurate reflection of what he will be in life.” A friend of ten years
wrote that Applicant is passionate and determined to reach his goals. Applicant’s fiancée
wrote  two  letters  that  were  submitted  into  the  record.  In  her  most  recent  letter,  she
commented that the couple recently purchased a home.  She wrote  that Applicant  was
completely  transparent  before  they  began  their  dating  relationship  about  his  past
problems that are the subject of the SOR allegations. She also confirmed that Applicant
no  longer  abuses  alcohol.  She  describes  Applicant  as  “a  respected  member  of  his
community,  both  personally  and  professionally.”  A  longtime  close  friend  also  praised
Applicant’s  outgoing  personality  and  willingness  to  help  others.  This  friend  also
commented on Applicant’s perseverance.  (AE F at 3-5; AE S; AE BB at 1-3.)
Applicant also submitted a lengthy letter from a licensed clinical social worker (the
LCSW), who described the incidents leading up to Applicant’s court-martial and provided
her  analysis  of  Applicant’s  qualifications  under  the  adjudicative  guidelines  for  Alcohol
Consumption  and  Sexual Behavior.  Her recitation of  the  facts  was sometimes  at odds
with the facts set forth in the official records submitted by the Government. Her version of
the  facts  was generally  quite  favorable  to  Applicant,  minimizing  the  seriousness of  his
actions.  Applicant  specifically  denied  to  the  LCSW  that  he  had  ever  “engaged  in  any
sexual assault.” Also, he only reported to the LCSW one incident at the Academy and
advised her that he had  “blacked  out” after excessive alcohol consumption and did not
recall the details of the incident, which occurred in November 2011 and is the basis for
the allegations in SOR ¶ 1.e. The LCSW wrote in her letter that despite his court-martial
conviction and the adverse decision on appeal, Applicant still maintains that he is innocent
of all of the charges. She wrote that the accusations against him were “unfounded.” She
explained in another part of her letter that Applicant believes he was set up by a classmate
who was acting as a confidential informant. The LCSW concluded that despite Applicant’s
history,  he  has  “no  probability  of  sexual  addiction”  or  “alcohol  use  disorder.”  He  also
denied to the LCSW that he assaulted the Driver in 2019. (AE P at 3-8.)
The LCSW also reported that according to Applicant he has never engaged in any
habitual or binge consumption of alcohol. He advised the LCSW that, as of the date of his
November 2021 interview with her, he drinks alcohol two to four times a month and drinks
three to four drinks when he does consume alcohol. (AE P at 5, 8.)
Applicant also submitted evidence of his community involvement, specifically with
an orphanage founded by his parents in the country of his birth.  He is a member of the
Board and assists with fundraising, among other activities. (AE H, AE Y, AE Z.)
",False
"In   Applicant’s   answer to   the   SOR,  he   admitted   the   allegation   in  SOR   ¶   1.c.  He
denied  the  allegations in SOR ¶¶  1.a, 1.b, and  their  cross-allegations in SOR ¶  2.a  and
3.a.  His  admission  is  incorporated in  my findings of fact.
Applicant was employed by a defense contractor from February 2018 to November
2020.  He  was  unemployed  from  November  2020  until  he  was  hired  a  non-federal
employer in July 2021. He has been offered employment by another defense contractor,
contingent on a favorable adjudication of his application for a security clearance. (GX 2
at 1; Hearing Exhibit I)
Applicant served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from February 2001 to June 2017,
and  received  an  other  than  honorable  discharge.  During  his  Navy  service,  he  was
awarded the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, two awards of the Navy and
Marine Corps Achievement Medal, three awards of the Navy Good Conduct Medal, and
various service medals and qualification badges. (GX 5 at 4)
Applicant  married  in  August  2003,  divorced  in  April  2010,  and  remarried  in
November 2017. He has two children, ages 18 and 15, from an extramarital relationship.
He is the biological father of the older child. The younger child has the same mother but
another  father,  and  Applicant  adopted  the  younger  child  because  his  mother  was  not
taking  proper  care  of  him.  (Tr.  22)  Applicant  is  an  active  member  of  his  church  and
participates in charitable activities in his community.
Applicant received a bachelor’s degree in December 2020 and a master’s degree
in December 2022. While on active duty, he completed medical training and was certified
as  an  emergency  medical  technician.  (AX  I)  While  serving  aboard  a  Navy  ship,  he
organized a program in which he and fellow sailors participated in the Reading Enhances
All Children (REACH), reading to and mentoring orphan children, at least twice a month
when  they  were  in  port.  He  received a  volunteer service  medal for his efforts.  (Tr. 20;
Response  to  SOR  at  8)  The  medal  apparently  was  a  civilian  award,  because  it  is  not
reflected on his DD 214 (Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty).
In June 2015, while Applicant was serving as a chief petty officer (pay grade E-7)
on  a ship, he was  sexually  involved  with  a  female  sailor  (pay  grade  E-3) who  was his
subordinate. He testified that his sexual relationship with the female sailor continued for
about two years, and that it involved frequent sexual activity in numerous places aboard
the  ship.  (Tr.  32;  GX  2  at  2)  When  he  was  interviewed  by  a  security  investigator  in
November  2022,  he  told  the  investigator  that  he  became  sexually  involved  with  his
subordinate because he was lonely and did not exercise the strength to resist his sexual
urges. (GX 2, personal subject interview at 15)
In July 2016, Applicant was charged with rape and sexual assault, in violation of
Article 120, (UCMJ), making a false official statement in violation of Article 107, UCMJ,
and obstructing justice in violation of Article 134, UCMJ. (GX 4) He testified that the sexual
conduct for which he was charged with rape occurred in an office aboard the ship and
while he and the female sailor were both on duty. He maintained that it was consensual.
He testified that when the female sailor told him she was pregnant by another sailor, he
told her that he did not want to be involved in a “love triangle.” (Tr. 15-16, 34.)
The  charge  of  making  a  false  official  statement  arose  when  Applicant  was  five
minutes late for duty as officer of the deck, and he told the chief petty officer whom he
was relieving that he was late because he was performing duties on the flight deck. The
charge of obstructing justice alleged that Applicant asked the sailor by whom the female
seaman was pregnant not to report his actions, and that Applicant attempted to physically
restrain the female sailor’s other sexual partner from reporting them. In March 2017, he
was charged with an additional offense of violating a lawful general order,  i.e., a Navy
regulation prohibiting fraternization with a subordinate, in violation of Article 92, UCMJ.
(GX 5).
After a pretrial hearing, Applicant admitted his guilt of the violations of Articles 107
and  92,  and  he  requested  separation  in  lieu  of  trial  by  court-martial.2  (GX  5  at  3)  His
request  was  granted,  and  all  charges  were  withdrawn  and  dismissed.  He  received  an
other than honorable discharge in June 2017.
In November 2020, Applicant, then employed by another defense contractor, was
terminated for timecard fraud, alleged in SOR ¶ 1.a. The alleged fraud consisted of taking
paid time off without recording it on his timecard. This job was his first civilian job after
leaving the Navy, and he was unfamiliar with the timecard process. He explained that he
was a salaried employee rather than an hourly employee, and he was not required to log
2 The SOR ¶ 1.b alleges that Applicant was accused of rape and sexual assault and was indicted by a grand
jury  for  those  charges.  There  is  no  grand  jury  in  cases  processed  under  the  UCMJ.  Instead,  there  is  a
pretrial hearing under Rule for Court-Martial 309(a) or an  investigation under Article 32, UCMJ, or both.
Unlike a grand jury, in which a defendant is not present, an accused military member is entitled to be present
during a pretrial hearing, be represented by counsel, cross-examine witnesses, and present evidence.
in and log out daily. He presented documentary evidence that he had sent his supervisor
email requests for paid time off and received email approval, but he admitted that he did
not enter his paid time off on his timecards. (Tr. 18; 47 GX 3 at 6-7) He admitted that his
pay vouchers listed paid time off used and the unused balances, and that he saw that his
paid time off was not reflected. He testified that when he asked another worker why his
paid  time  off  was  not  reflected  on  his  pay  voucher,  the  other  worker  told  him  that
sometimes it took a month or two before it was reflected on the pay voucher. (Tr. 50) He
admitted that he should have notified his personnel office that his paid time off was not
being reflected on his pay voucher. (Tr. 50) There is no evidence that he was overpaid
because of the inaccurate timecards.
",True
"In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted  SOR  ¶  1.a  and  SOR  ¶¶  4.a-4.g,
and  he  denied  SOR  ¶¶  2.a  and  3.a,  all  with  explanations.  SOR  ¶  3.b  is  a  cross-
allegation that he did not answer, so I consider that he denied it. Applicant’s admissions
are  incorporated  into  the  findings  of  fact.  After  a  thorough  and  careful  review  of  the
pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact.
Applicant is 45 years old. He graduated from high school in 1997 and has taken
some  college  classes.  He  has  been  married  since  2008,  and  has  a  son,  18,  and  a
daughter,  15.  He  served  in  the  U.S.  Navy  from  October  1997  to  November  2016.  His
DD-214  discharge  form  reflects  that  he  received  the  Navy  and  Marine  Corps
Commendation  Medal, Joint Service Achievement  Medal,  five  Navy and  Marine Corps
Achievement  Medals,  and  six  Good  Conduct  Medals,  along  with  appropriate  service
medals.  (AE  R)  Applicant  received  a  general  discharge  under  honorable  conditions
following “Misconduct (Serious Offense).” He was unemployed for about seven months
after  he  left  the  Navy,  until  beginning  his  current  position  with  a  large  defense
contractor, in June 2017. He held a clearance in the Navy. (GE 1, GE 5, GE 6, GE 7; Tr.
10, 34, 46-47, 66-69; AE R)
In  September  2015,  Applicant  was  a  chief  petty  officer  (E-7)  on  a  U.S.  Navy
aircraft  carrier  at  sea.  Sailors  were  on  a  “holiday  schedule”  and  were  free  to  watch
movies and television. (GE 7 at 2) Applicant and several male sailors were at his work
area watching a football game. At about 2100 hours, Sailor S (E-3) went to Applicant’s
work area to use a  computer. Applicant was her mentor at the time. She was wearing
unauthorized  clothing  to  transit  the  ship,  including  Navy  physical  training  sweatpants
and a t-shirt. (GE 5 at 11; Tr. 39, 48-50, 113)
When  Sailor  S  sat  down,  Applicant  said  to  her,  “What  happened  to  [your]  ass,
you  really  don’t  have  any  back  there.”  Other  sailors  laughed.  Moments  later,  Sailor  S
asked  Applicant  for  some  candy  he  was  eating.  Applicant  asked  her,  “What  are  you
excited about?”, referring to the fact that her breasts were visible beneath her shirt. (GE
5 at 11)
Applicant  then  walked  towards  Sailor  S  with  the  bag  of  candy.  She  later  told
Naval  Criminal  Investigative  Service  (NCIS)  investigators  that  he  grabbed  her  right
breast while handing her the candy. She said, “he laughed when he grabbed my breast
and the other guys did too.” She pushed his hand away and said, “What the f---? Why
would you do that?” Sailor S then left, went to her own work center, and wrote Applicant
an  e-mail  telling  him  she  found  his  behavior  inappropriate,  offensive,  and  humiliating.
(GE 5 at 11)
Sailor  S  reported  the  matter  the  next  day.  NCIS  investigators  interviewed  the
three other sailors present that evening and obtained a sworn statement from Applicant.
Only  one  of  the  sailors  could  speak  to  the  allegations.  Witness  1  said  Applicant  told
Sailor  S  to  “pull  her  pants  up  over  her  flat  ass.”  Witness  1  was  unable  to  observe
whether Applicant grabbed Sailor S’s breast. (GE 5 at 11; GE 6 at 11-12)
In  her  sworn  statement  provided  to  NCIS,  Sailor  S  said  she  felt  humiliated  and
embarrassed  on  the  night  in  question.  She  said  Applicant  began  making  sexually
inappropriate comments towards her in about April 2014. She detailed an incident when
she was in the hospital and Applicant came to visit her. She said he sat on her bed, ran
his  fingers  through  her  hair,  and  called  her  “beautiful”  and  “sexy.”  She  found  his
behavior  offensive  but  did  not  report  it  since  she  thought  of  him  as  a  mentor.  His
grabbing her breast was the catalyst for her report. (GE 5 at 12) She was transferred to
another ship following her report. (GE 6 at 3)
Applicant  acknowledged  in  his  own  sworn  statement  to  NCIS  that  he  asked
Sailor S, “why are your pants sagging around  your flat ass?”  He also admitted that he
asked her if she was excited about something because he noticed that her “headlights
were on”  (meaning her nipples were showing through her shirt). He said he may have
“grazed  her  breast”  while  handing  her  the  bag  of  candy,  but  he  told  NCIS  that  any
contact was unintentional. He received the e-mail from Sailor S but did not respond, as
he planned to discuss it with her in person. (GE 5 at 11-12; GE 6 at 15)
In the NCIS interview, he said,
I handed  the  bag  to  her with  my right  hand  and  she  grab[bed]  with  her left
because   her  right  hand   is  in   a   [cast].  While   reaching   and   returning   my
hand,  she   pushed   my   arm   away  in  a[n]  upward   manner  because   I   had
grazed   her   breast.   I  didn’t   think   much   of   it  at   the   time,  this  was  not
intentional   or  a   purposely  done   act   to   degrade   her.   I   did   not  squeeze,
grab,  pinch, or grope  her  breast in any way. (GE 6  at 15)
Applicant’s  interactions  with  Sailor S  led  to  charges  under  the  Uniform  Code  of
Military Justice (UCMJ) Article 92 (Failure to Obey Order or Regulation), by “wrongfully
making  inappropriate  sexual  comments  to  [Sailor  S]  about  her  body  parts,  creating  a
hostile  work  environment”;  and  Article  120  (Abusive  Sexual  Contact)  by  touching  the
breast of Sailor S without her consent. In December 2015, at a nonjudicial punishment
(NJP)  proceeding  (captain’s  mast)  under Article  15  of  the  UCMJ,  he  pled  not  guilty  to
both  specifications  but  was  found  guilty  by  the  ship’s  commanding  officer  (CO).
Applicant was put on restriction for 45 days and forfeited $2,764 in pay for two months.
(GE 5. Tr. 48-49, 66-69) (SOR ¶¶ 1.a, 2.a, 3.b)
The  CO  found  that  the  witnesses’  statements  at  the  NJP  proceeding  were
consistent with their statements to NCIS. Applicant admitted at the captain’s mast that
his  comments  to  Sailor  S  that  evening  were  inappropriate  and  offensive.  He  admitted
that  he  had  allowed  their  relationship  to  become  unprofessional  and  unduly  familiar.
(GE 5 at 12)
The CO found that “it is clear that [Applicant] made inappropriate comments of a
sexual  nature  about  [Sailor  S’s]  buttocks  and  breasts,  engaged  in  an  unduly  familiar
relationship with her, and fostered an environment where she was comfortable ignoring
the uniform restrictions in his work center.” He found that Applicant was not credible in
asserting that he may have accidentally touched Sailor S’s breast, “in light of his sexual
statements  made  immediately  before  the  incident  and  the  evidence  of  fraternization.”
(GE  5  at  12)  He  found  that  a  preponderance  of  the  evidence  supported  the  charges.
(GE 5 at 9)
The CO found that Applicant’s behavior
impacted   good   order  and   discipline,   goes  against   the   U.S.  Navy’s  Core
Values,  and   distracts   from   the   Navy’s  mission.  His  behavior  clearly
violated   the   Navy’s  sexual  harassment   policy,  created   a   hostile   work
environment,   and   violated   all   bounds  of  decency.  He  abused   the   trust
placed  in  him by  this command  as a  Chief Petty Officer. He further abused
his position  as a  mentor to  junior sailors. This behavior has  no  place  in our
Navy.  He must  be held  accountable  for his actions. (GE 5  at 13)
Applicant  retained  legal  counsel  and  appealed  the  NJP  findings  to  the
commander of the carrier strike group, but his appeal was denied. (GE 5) Based on the
CO’s findings, Applicant was recommended for administrative separation (ADSEP) from
the Navy. In March 2016, the ADSEP board convened and found sufficient evidence of
misconduct  due  to  his  commission  of  a  serious  offense.  The  board  recommended  a
general  discharge  under  honorable  conditions.  (GE  6  at  5)  Applicant  was  discharged
from  the  Navy  as  recommended  in  November  2016.  (AE  R)  (SOR  ¶  3.a)  He  was
discharged  after  serving  19  years  and  two  months  in  the  Navy,  with  the  rank  of  chief
petty officer (E-7). (AE R; Tr. 34-35, 66-69, 71-73)
Applicant  adamantly  denied  Sailor  S’s  allegations  in  his  security  clearance
background  interview.  (GE  7  at  4)  In  his  Answer  to  the  SOR,  Applicant  admitted
receiving  captain’s  mast  but  denied  the  underlying  conduct,  asserting  that  the  CO  did
not properly consider the evidence presented.
Applicant  began  his  hearing  testimony  by  asserting  that  the  allegations  were
“very  much  fabricated.”  (Tr.  29)  He  acknowledged  using  “a  poor  choice  of  words”  by
telling  Sailor  S  to  “pull  your  pants  up  on  your  ass,  and,  hey,  your  headlights  are
showing.”  He  said  his  “intent  was  to  just  make  her  aware  of  her  unform  appearance.”
(Tr.  30,  45)  He  denied  approaching  Sailor  S  in  any  sexual  manner  or  making
advancements  towards  her.  He  believes  it  was  “unfair”  for  her  to  have  made  those
allegations. (Tr. 30) He feels the Navy did him a disservice, and he believes people do
not want to make statements (in his favor) and jeopardize their own career. (Tr. 30-31)
Applicant  said  Sailor  S  was  in  his  department  on  the  ship,  one  of  about  400
sailors.  He  said  he  was  not  her  supervisor,  but  she  asked  him  and  another  sailor  to
mentor her. Initially he told her she should be mentored by a first class or second class
petty  officer,  but  he  agreed  to  mentor  her  as  a  chief  petty  officer.  He  saw  her  in  his
department  “all  the  time,  two  of  three  times  a  week.”  (Tr.  38-39)  Applicant  said  their
relationship  was  a  strictly  professional,  mentor-mentee  relationship  and  they  were  on
good terms. (Tr. 50-51, 64)
Applicant  testified  that  on  the  evening  in  question,  the  ship  was  on  “holiday
routine”  on  a  Sunday  evening.  Applicant  and  some  junior  male  sailors  were  watching
football and relaxing. When Sailor S sat down, he said she needed to “pull your pants
up on your ass” and that “your headlights are on” because her nipples were protruding
from  her  shirt.  He  said  he  wanted  her  to  be  mindful  of  her  appearance  around  junior
male  sailors.  (Tr.  39;  51-53)  He  did  not  recall  any  of  the  other  sailors  laughing  or
reacting at the time. (Tr. 54)
Applicant said Sailor S asked if he had any candy, and he had some on his desk
and he reached over to where she was sitting and gave her some. One of her arms was
in a cast. He handed her the candy and she took it. (Tr. 53-56) He denied grabbing her
breast.  He  told  the  NCIS  investigator  that  he  doubted  that  he  accidentally  grazed  her
breast  but  that  it  was  a  possibility.  He  said  he  “never  grabbed  her  [and]  never  did
anything to her physically. I simply handed her the candy.” He said he hit or grazed her
arm that was in the cast. (Tr. 57-62; GE 6 at 15-16)
Applicant  said  that,  afterwards,  Sailor  S  sat  at  the  computer  for  another  30-45
minutes.  He  later  learned  that  she  was  upset  and  went  to  her  division  office  and  was
crying, but she was not upset or emotional when she left his office. (Tr. 62-64)
The  next morning  Applicant  was told by NCIS  that Sailor S had alleged  that he
had  grabbed  her  breast.  He  cooperated  with  the  investigation.  He  was  scheduled  to
transfer to another duty station, but the investigation put the transfer on hold. He denied
going to the emergency room in the hospital with Sailor S. rubbing her hair and calling
her “beautiful.” (Tr. 39-43)
Sailor  S  was  transferred  off  the  ship  within  72  hours  after  she  made  the
allegations against Applicant, per Navy policy. Applicant said he did not want to be seen
as  someone  who  “goes  around  grabbing  on  people,  especially  females.”  He  asserted
that  Sailor  S  had  “character  problems,”  had  twice  been  to  captain’s  mast  herself,  and
had  been  released  from  the  Navy  for  performance  issues.  He  did  not  believe  he  was
being treated  equally  and  fairly,  as  he  felt the  allegations  were  based on  hearsay and
without concrete evidence. (Tr. 43-45, 114)
At captain’s mast, Applicant was asked by the CO about the incident with Sailor
S and he said it was fabricated, and he did not know why she would not have done this.
He  suggested  during  his  testimony  that  it  was  because  she  wanted  to  get  out  of  the
deployment, but he does not know that. (Tr. 63-64)
With  respect  to  Sailor  S’s  allegations about  the  incident  in the  hospital  in  2014,
Applicant said he escorted her to the hospital once because she was on restriction from
a  previous  captain’s  mast.  He  remained  in  the  lobby  for  about  two  hours.  The  doctor
came  out  and  asked  him  if  he  knew  of  any  reason  that  she  would  not  be  able  to  get
underway  (with  the  ship).  He  denied  that  he  visited  her  in  the  hospital  and  was  only
there to escort her as an E-7 as required. (Tr. 65-66; GE 7 at 4-5)
Applicant said he “went into a spiral” of depression after he was discharged from
the Navy after 19 years and two months of service. He said he is a top performer at his
job.  He  also  depleted his  savings  during his  period  of  unemployment  after  leaving  the
Navy. He is currently seeing mental health therapists with the Department of Veterans
Affairs (VA). (Tr. 32-33, 74, 99-101, 115-116)
Applicant said that after leaving  the  Navy, he  had no  income  and  was  “obsessed”
with   trying   to   clear  his   name   and   get  his   discharge   status  overturned   (i.e.,  upgraded).
(Tr 32)  He also  said he  was helping  family members financially and  he  took a  large  pay
cut  after   leaving   the   Navy,  from   $76,000   to   $47,000   annually.   He  said  he   had   settled
and  cleared up  about $19,000  of his $31,000  in delinquent debts. (Tr. 33, 36-37, 105-
106)   He  paid  his  lawyer  about  $13,000   to   appeal  the   captain’s  mast   and   to   represent
him during  and after his ADSEP  board proceeding. (Tr. 72-74
Applicant  does not  receive  retirement pay from the  Navy, but he has a  service-
connected disability for which he receives $1,907 a month from the VA, with an annual
cost of living adjustment. His annual salary at his job is $67,815, up from $47,000 when
he was hired. His wife is a nurse, earning about $30,000 annually. They pay household
expenses  jointly.  (Tr.  35-36,  73-77,  108,  117;  AE  K,  AE  P,  AE  Q)  Applicant’s  work
evaluations  reflect  that  he  is  an  outstanding  leader  who  makes  a  significant  positive
impact. (AE M – AE O)
Under Guideline  F, the  SOR  concerns  seven  delinquent debts,  totaling  just  under
$32,000. The  debts are  established  by  credit  bureau  reports (CBRs) in the  record, from
March  2022, June 2021, November  2020, and  August 2023. (GE 2-GE  4, GE  8) (SOR ¶
4)  Applicant disclosed  some debts on  his SCA. (GE  1)
Applicant made payments on most of his SOR debts, but only did so days before
the hearing. He financed these payments with a $19,000 loan, in late August 2023. (Tr.
87-88,  93,  109)  He  plans  to  continue  to  work  to  resolve  his  debts  and  improve
financially.  (Tr. 115)  He  is  to repay  the  loan with  $487 payments  over  60 months.  (Tr.
121; AE L)
SOR  ¶  4.a  ($2,511)  is  an  account  placed  for  collection.  It  relates  to  a  furniture
purchase. Applicant said the furniture began to come apart a month after he bought it,
so  he  stopped  paying  on  the  account.  He  made  a  settlement  agreement  with  the
creditor for $2,260. The account was resolved with a payment in late August 2023. (Tr.
77-80; GE 2 at 4; GE 4 at 3, GE 8 at 4; AE A, AE B)
SOR ¶  4.b  ($2,378)  is an  account that  has been  charged  off. (GE 2  at  4,  GE  3,
GE  8  at  5)  Applicant paid this  account  in late  August 2023. (AE  A, AE G,  AE  H; Tr.  81-
83)
SOR  ¶  4.c  ($1,147  past  due,  total  balance  $3,957)  is  a  financial  account,
probably a loan, money Applicant used for vehicle maintenance and repairs. (GE 2 at 5,
8  at  8)  A  civil  judgment  was  issued  in  April 2022.  Applicant  did  not  appear  in  court  to
defend  himself  since  he  was  overseas.  He  went  to  court  and  paid  the  full  amount  in
August 2023. (Tr. 81-85; AE A, AE F)
SOR  ¶  4.d  ($14,267)  is  a  military  exchange  account  placed  for  collection.  The
account was pending when Applicant separated from the Navy and he was allowed to
defer  payments  until  he  found  employment,  but  he  did  not  follow  up  and  the  account
became past due. He settled the debt for $12,096, in August 2023. (Tr. 85-88; GE 2 at
7, GE 3, GE 4 at 2, GE 8 at 5; AE A, AE C, AE I, AE J)
SOR ¶ 4.e ($5,184) is an account that has been placed for collection. (GE 2 at 7,
GE 3, GE 4 at 2) Applicant believes he took out this loan to provide financial assistance
to a family member with a serious medical issue. He settled the debt for $777 in August
2023. (AE A, AE D, AE E; Tr. 88-90)
SOR ¶ 4.f ($328) is an insurance debt placed for collection. It last appeared on a
CBR in June 2021. (GE 3, GE 5) Applicant admitted the debt in his Answer to the SOR
and  said  he  would  settle  it.  He  said  at  his  hearing  that  he  still  has  insurance  with  the
creditor and is unsure what this debt is about. (Tr. 90-92)
SOR ¶ 4.g ($3,350) is a debt placed for collection by a loan company. (GE 4 at 3)
Applicant  said  in  his  Answer  that  he  intended  to  resolve  it.  In  his  hearing  he  said  he
wants  to  clear  it  up  but  is  not  sure  if  he  owes  the  debt  or  not.  He  last  contacted  the
creditor in May or June 2023. (Tr. 90-92)
In  about  2015,  before  he  left  the  Navy,  Applicant  said  he  got  about  $100,000
from a settlement of what he said was a class- action lawsuit relating to the short sale of
some  real  estate.  He  said  he  used  the  proceeds  to  pay  off  debts,  buy  a  car,  and  for
some other expenses. (Tr. 95-98, 103-107)
Applicant  acknowledged  that  he  has  about  $13,000  in  past-due  federal  income
taxes  that  resulted  from  that  windfall.  He  said  he  has  been  on  a  payment  plan  since
2018 and pays $406 a month. At the time of the hearing (August 31, 2023), he had not
filed his 2022 federal income tax return and had not sought a filing extension. He said
he had been sent on an overseas assignment for his job that was extended for several
months. He missed the filing deadline and neglected to speak with his accountant about
it.  (Tr.  93-97,  102-107)  This  is  not  alleged  in  the  SOR  and  will  not  be  considered  as
disqualifying conduct.
Applicant  has  participated  in  credit  counseling  in  recent  months.  After  the
hearing,  he  provided  monthly  budget  information  detailing  his  VA  benefits  ($1,907),
income  from  his  job  ($2,061  biweekly  =  $4,122)  and  monthly  expenses,  including  his
mortgage  and  the  $487  monthly  payment  on  the  loan  he  used  to  address  his  SOR
debts. (Tr. 108-110; AE L)
Applicant closed his testimony by asserting that if he could go back to September
2015 and do things differently, he would. His work with his counselors has helped him
realize that he has responsibilities. He let his personal pride get in the way. He wants to
upgrade his discharge and also to address his financial shortfalls. He is valued at work
and up to the point of his NJP he was a stellar performer in the Navy. (Tr, 119-120)
",True
"In his Answer, Applicant admitted with explanation SOR ¶¶ 1.a and 2.b, and he
denied SOR ¶ 2.a. I have construed Applicant’s response to SOR ¶ 2.b as a denial of
that allegation. He is 35 years old. He married in 2009, divorced in 2018, and remarried
in 2019. He has a minor child. He graduated from high school in 2006 and  received a
professional degree from a vocational school in 2008. (Tr. at 7, 21-22; GE 1-2)
Applicant  served  in  the  National  Guard  from  July  2011  to  July  2017,  and  he
received  a  general  discharge  under  honorable  conditions.  He  has  worked  for  various
DOD contractors since 2016. He worked for a DOD contractor on a U.S. military base
overseas from January 2016 to September 2019, when he was terminated for cause, as
further discussed below. He was unemployed from October 2019 to January 2020.  As
of the date of the hearing, he has worked for his current employer since October 2022.
He  was  first  granted  a security  clearance  in approximately 2011.  (Tr.  at  5,  7-8,  22-26,
55; GE 1-2)
Applicant was accused of sexual harassment  for incidents that occurred  in May
2019,  and  he  was  barred  from  access  to  the  job  site  and  certain  military  installations
indefinitely because of the substantiated allegations. (SOR ¶ 1.a) A female soldier that
he  met  in  May  2019  while  working  for the above-mentioned  DOD contractor  overseas
on  a  U.S.  military  base,  whom  he  saw  two  or  three  days  a  week  through  work  and
considered a friend, alleged the following three sexual harassment claims: (1) when he
saw her at the post exchange, he walked up to her, ran his fingers through her hair, and
asked if he could remove her hair bun; (2) he asked her what she had purchased from a
women’s lingerie, clothing, and beauty store; and (3) he walked up behind her while at
work, touched her shoulder, and started to give her a massage. (Tr. at 26-33; GE 2-4)
Applicant  denied  these  allegations.  He acknowledged, in  the  third incident,  only
that he walked up behind the soldier at work and  touched her shoulder. He discussed
the sexual harassment allegations during his July 2020 background interview. He stated
in his Answer:
I  admit  that sexual harassment allegations were made against me and due
to  those  allegations[,]  I  was barred  [from]  access to  [military]  installations. I
was  never  formally  given   any  evidence   regarding   these   allegations.  This
incident  was not intended  to be  construed  as sexual harassment  and  I has
[sic]  also  denied  that  2  of  the  all[e]gations  happened  as  stated.  This  is the
only  time   I  have   ever   been   in   trouble  for  this  as  well  and   [it]   has  not
happened since.  (Tr. at 26-33; GE 2)
On August 21, 2019, Applicant was placed on paid administrative leave. He was
then placed on unpaid administrative leave on September 21, 2019. This was the only
time  he  had  ever  been  placed  on  administrative  leave,  and  he  did  not  view  it  as  a
suspension.  While  on  administrative  leave,  he  stated  that  he  was  brought  into  the
captain’s  office  due  to  an  investigation  into  the  soldier’s  claims,  and  he  provided  a
written  statement  in  response  to  her  allegations.  He  was  unaware  of  what  else  was
done during the investigation. (Tr. at 26-35, 39-45, 48-56; GE 3-4)
On   September  23,  2019,  Applicant   was  terminated   for  cause   due   to   sexual
harassment,   and   he   is  not  eligible   for   rehire.  (SOR  ¶   2.a;  GE   3-4)   He  acknowledged
receipt   of  an   October  2019   letter  from   the   installation   commanding   officer,  indefinitely
barring   him  access  to   the   job   site   and   certain  military   installations  because   of   the
substantiated   sexual  harassment   allegations.   An   April  2020   email   from   his  then-
employer’s  human  resources director  states:
[Applicant]  was accused  of sexual  harassment towards a  soldier.  A  formal
investigation   was  performed   by  the   government,   and   the   findings  were
that   [Applicant’s]   actions  were   in   violation   of   Army   Regulation   600-20,
Army  Command   Policy,  para.  7-5   and   Army   Sexual  Harassment/Assault
Response   and   Prevention   (SHARP)  Policy.   It   was  also   concerning   that
[Applicant]  was in a  building  to  which  he  did  not  have  authorized  access.
The  final recommendation  by the  investigating  officer was  for [Applicant’s]
Camp  . . . base access authorization to be revoked.  (Tr. at 34, 39; GE  3-4)
Applicant stated in his Answer, “I was unaware of being terminated/fired and not
eligible for rehire as I was only told that I was released from contract. So therefore[,] I
deny  knowing  that  I  was  terminated/fired  prior  to  my  video  interview.”  He  reiterated
these  sentiments  during  his  July  2020  background  interview  and  at  the  hearing.  He
stated that no-one informed him that he was suspended, and he was only asked to turn
his DOD Common Access Card into his site lead. He was not required to formally out-
process  and  return  to  the  United  States,  and  he  was  not  barred  from  all  installations
around  other  command  locations.  He  remained  in  country  until  early  2020,  when  he
returned to the United States to seek employment. (Tr. at 33-45, 48-56; GE 2, 4)
When Applicant completed his February 2020 SCA, in response to “Section 13A
- Employment  Activities,”  he  listed  his  January  2016  to  September  2019  employment
with the above-mentioned DOD contractor overseas, and he disclosed that he had been
“[r]eleased  from  contract”  by  this  employer  in  September  2019.  He  marked  “No”  in
response  to  two  questions  in  this  section  and  failed  to  disclose  for  this  listed
employment  that  information  as  set  forth  in  SOR  ¶  1.a.  (SOR  ¶  2.b)  Those  two
questions inquired:

For  this   employment,   in  the   last   seven   (7)   years   have   you   received   a
written  warning,  been  officially reprimanded, suspended, or disciplined  for
misconduct in  the workplace,  such  as a violation of security  policy?  (GE 1)
Applicant  stated  in  his  Answer,  “I  admit  to  choosing  No  on  this question  due  to
not knowing that I was fired from [this employment]. I was only told I was released from
contract.  This  was  an  honest  mistake  and  was  not  intentional.”  He  also  maintained,
during his July 2020 background interview and at the hearing, that he did not view his
placement on administrative leave as a suspension. (Tr. at 33-47, 49-50; GE 2, 4)
Applicant  had  no  previous  unfavorable  incidents,  and  he  has  not  had  any
unfavorable incidents since, to include with his current employer. He was not arrested or
charged  with  any  offense.  He  expressed  remorse  for  his  actions  and  stated  that  he
learned his lesson. His spouse is aware of the allegations. (Tr. at 26, 34, 47-48)

"Applicant is a 56-year-old married man with four adult children. He and his wife have
been married for 26 years. A previous marriage ended in divorce. Applicant has a high
school diploma and has taken some college courses. (AE G; Tr. 11) He is a veteran of both
the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Army. Applicant served in the Navy from 1987 to 1991. (AE B)
He was discharged honorably. In 1998, Applicant enlisted in the Army and served until
2015, when he retired honorably. (AE A) While in the Army, he completed three tours of
duty in combat zones. (Tr. 22) He has held a security clearance since 1988. (Tr. 21)
Through Applicant’s Army career, he developed subject-matter expertise in the field
of ordnance, storage, and security. (AE F at 3) Since February 2021, he has been working
for his current employer as a security officer. (GE 1 at 12)
Applicant has a history of misconduct of a sexual nature. In 1999, he was cited for
solicitation  of  a  prostitute.  (Answer  at  1)  Applicant  testified  that  he  had  no  intention  of
soliciting a prostitute that evening. Rather, while he was sitting at a traffic light on the way
home one evening in a part of town where prostitutes congregated, he saw a woman get
out of a sports car. (AE T at 4) He suspected the woman was an undercover police officer
because she was well dressed and looked “much different than the other typical ladies of
the night would [look] in that area.” He explained further that, because he was taking a
course in criminology at the time, he wanted to speak to the supposed undercover officer to
see firsthand how undercover sting operations are conducted, in the event he ever needed
to write a paper on the subject. (Tr. 26; GE 2 at 14) Subsequently, he asked the woman
where she took her johns, and she nodded her head in the direction of a nearby hotel. (GE
2 at 15) Applicant then drove his car towards the hotel and parked at an adjacent parking
lot, whereupon multiple police officers pulled beside him in unmarked vehicles and issued
him a citation for soliciting prostitution. (Tr. 28) Subsequently, Applicant paid a fine.
Shortly  after  the  episode,  Applicant  told  his  wife  the  same  explanation  of  the
circumstances surrounding the issuance of the citation, to which he testified. She did not
find this explanation credible. (Tr. 48)
Beginning in 2017, Applicant attended swingers’ parties every four to five months. At
the hearing, he testified that he stopped attending them in 2020, whereas, during a subject
interview, he told the investigator that the last swingers’ party he attended was in February
2022, ten months after the initiation of the security clearance investigation. (GE 2 at 11)
Often while at these parties, he had sexual intercourse with strangers. (Tr. 31-32) His wife
was unaware that he was attending these parties. When he went, he would tell her that he
was going to work. (Tr. 31)
At  one  of  the  parties,  a  woman  with  whom  Applicant  had  sexual  intercourse,
photographed him wearing no clothing except for a pair of panties. (AE T at 3) In March
2021, while at work, Applicant checked his personal email and discovered that the woman
he met at the swingers’ party emailed him the picture. (Tr. 15) Applicant tried to delete it,
but accidently saved it onto his office’s work drive. (Tr. 15; GE 2 at 5) Because Applicant is
not  computer  literate,  he  was  unable  to  delete  it.  Consequently,  he  asked  a  female
coworker  for  help.  He  did  not  ask  a  male  coworker  for  help  because  he  was  too
embarrassed. (GE 2 at 12) Before his coworker helped him, he warned her that she might
find the photograph offensive. (Tr. 15) She then went into the work drive and deleted the
picture. (Tr. 16)
Shortly thereafter, the woman who helped Applicant delete the inappropriate picture
filed  a  sexual  harassment  complaint  with  their  employer.  The  next  day,  Applicant’s
employer  fired  him  for  violating  company  policy.  (GE  2  at  6;  GE  3)  According  to  the
termination letter, Applicant’s employer also reviewed the contents of Applicant’s computer
after the coworker’s complaint and discovered several “obscene and offensive” files. (GE 3)
While  on  the  job,  Applicant  watched  pornography  on  his  telework  laptop
approximately 15 to 20 times. (GE 2 at 6, 13; Tr. 38) He knew that it was against company
policy to download pornography onto his work computer, but he did not think that watching
pornography on his work computer while connected to his home internet carrier posed a
problem. (Tr. 17, 39) At the time Applicant was fired, he was the company’s facility security
officer. (GE 1 at 13)
Applicant has not watched pornography since May 2020, and he has not attended a
swingers’ party since February 2022. (Tr. 19, 35; GE 2 at 11) He is ashamed of the pain
that  he  caused  his  wife  and  understands  that  “love  is  more  powerful  than  any  kind  of
fantasy.” (Tr. 24)
In late 2022, Applicant told his wife about his swingers’ party attendance. (AE F at 4;
Tr. 33) According to Applicant’s wife, he feels shame and remorse for his behavior, has
grown as a person, “and is working hard to develop the skills needed to avoid making such
poor choices again.” (AE F at 4) Moreover, he is a man of tremendous character who has
supported her through her fight with cancer, given a homeless man the shoes off his feet,
and covered shifts for coworkers in crisis without advance notice. (AE F at 4)
One of Applicant’s current supervisors provided a character reference. He is aware
of  Applicant’s  past misconduct  and  stated  that  it  “play[s]  no  difference  on  his  role  and
position at his workplace” because of the stellar judgment he demonstrates on the job. (AE
F at 2)
In July 2023, Applicant voluntarily underwent a psychological evaluation to ascertain
whether his behavior, as described above, was indicative of any underlying psychological
disorder.  (AE  T)  After interviewing  Applicant  and  conducting  psychological  testing,  the
psychologist concluded that “Applicant’s behaviors of concern . . . were the function of poor
choices made over the course of his life rather than because of any malicious intent or
sexual deviance.” (AE T at 6) Moreover, he concluded that the risk Applicant will engage in
any such behavior in the future is low. (AE T at 6)

"Applicant is a 52-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for
his  current  employer  since  2009.  He  has  held  a  security  clearance  since  about  1997,
but  it  has  been  suspended  since  December  2019.  He  earned  a  bachelor’s  degree  in
1994. He married in 1995 and divorced in 2016. He married for the second time in the
fall of 2023. He has two adult children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 11-14, 18-19, 28, 38; GE 1, 2,

Applicant  has  been  involved  in  a  series  of  indiscriminate  high-risk  sexual
encounters  (“hook-ups”)  with  consenting  adults  since  about  1992.  Once  the  Internet
became prevalent, he met the individuals online through various websites designed for
that purpose.  He  met the  individuals in  hotels,  houses, public  restrooms,  public  parks,
and adult bookstores. He stopped using public places in about 2014. Applicant and the
individuals  remained  anonymous  or  on  a  first-name  basis.  He  could  only  recall  two
individuals  who  he  met  more  than  once,  and  he  did  not  know  their  last  names.  He
concealed his behavior from his then wife and other individuals until about 2010. After
2010,  he  and  his  wife  had  an  open  marriage,  and  she  accepted  that  he  had  multiple
partners outside the marriage. She also had at least one extramarital partner. (Tr. at 19-
20, 37-38; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 3, 5; AE M)
Applicant  and  his  then  wife  had  an  agreement  that  they  would  not  have  sex
within  24  hours  of  either  one  of  them  having  sex  with  someone  else.  He  violated  that
agreement and sexually assaulted his then wife in about 2011 and again in 2012 while
she was asleep and within 24 hours of a sexual encounter. In 2011, he engaged in oral
sex  with  her  without  her  consent,  and  in  2012,  he  digitally  penetrated  her  without  her
consent. (Tr. at 21-23, 38-39; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 3; AE M)
Applicant  and  his  second  wife  received  couples’  counseling,  and  he  received
counseling for sexual addiction from a licensed clinical social worker (LCSW) from 2012
to  2014.  He  also  attended  Sex  Addicts  Anonymous  (SAA) meetings.  He  attributes  the
assaults  to  his  undiagnosed  and  untreated  bipolar  disorder  and  the  incorrect
medication, which made him hypersexual. (Tr. at 20-24; Applicant’s response to  SOR;
GE 2, 3, 5; AE M) He wrote in his response to the SOR:
The   sexual  assaults   were   committed   during   a   time   when   I  was
misdiagnosed   and   prescribed   an   antidepressant   that  exacerbated   my
manic  episodes.  Under  proper  diagnosis  and   proper  medication,   these
events would not have  occurred, and will not occur again.
Applicant’s  ex-wife  became  involved  in  an  ongoing  extramarital  relationship  in
about 2011. In about 2012, Applicant became  involved in an ongoing  relationship with
the individual who eventually became his husband. Applicant and his ex-wife separated
in about 2013. They disclosed their extramarital relationships to their children the same
year.  Applicant  informed  his  new  partner  (current  husband)  of  his  multiple  sexual
encounters,  and  they  maintained  an  open  relationship.  His  last  sexual  encounter  with
someone  other  than  his  husband  occurred  in  about  August  or  September  2023.  He
stated  that  he  has  not  had  any  extramarital  sexual  encounters  since  he  married.
Applicant  remains on good  terms with his ex-wife.  She  sincerely congratulated him on
his recent marriage. (Tr. at 18-19, 27-29, 37; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, AE K)
Applicant  has  received  treatment  from  a  psychiatrist  since  2014.  He  received
several diagnoses over the years, but he has consistently been diagnosed with bipolar II
disorder. He was prescribed different medications based on that diagnosis. He told the
psychiatrist  in  2019  that  he  was  disappointed  his  ex-wife  chose  to  end  the  marriage
after  he  sexually  assaulted  her.  He  felt  that  since  the  assaults  occurred  before  he
received the correct diagnosis and treatment,  she should have been more forgiving. In
July  2021,  the  psychiatrist  diagnosed  him  with  bipolar  II  disorder;  fetishistic  disorder
(non-living objects); amphetamine-type use disorder, intermittent relapse/remission; and
cannabis use disorder, mild. In January 2023, he was diagnosed with bipolar II disorder,
stable; amphetamine-type use disorder, in sustained remission; cannabis use disorder,
mild; and fetishistic disorder (non-living objects). (Tr. at 23-27; Applicant’s response to
SOR; GE 3)
Applicant used methamphetamine for the first time in about October 2018, when
it  was  offered  to  him  during  a  sexual  encounter.  Applicant  used  methamphetamine
regularly  (every  six  to  eight  weeks)  during  certain  sexual  encounters  until  about  June
2021.  He  found  that  it  enhanced  his  experience.  The  methamphetamine  was  always
provided by the other individual. (Tr. at 29-30, 40; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2,
3, 5; AE M)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF  86)  in
January  2019.  He  intentionally  provided  false  information  when  he  denied  using  any
illegal  drugs  or  controlled  substances  in  the  last  seven  years.  He  thought  the
information would be shared  with his employer and possibly law enforcement. He was
concerned that he would lose his job and face criminal charges.  (Tr. at 42; Applicant’s
response to SOR; GE 1, 2)
Applicant  was  interviewed  for  his  background  investigation  in  June  2019.  He
again intentionally provided false information when he stated that he did not use illegal
drugs of any kind. (Tr. at 42-43; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2)
Applicant continued using methamphetamine after the background interview. He
realized  that  his  psychiatrist  knew  about  his  illegal  drug  use  and  that  the  DoD  had
sought his medical records. In August 2019, he reported his methamphetamine use and
compulsive sexual behavior to his employer, who in turn reported it to the DoD. He also
reported  that  he  had  been  diagnosed  with  bipolar  II  disorder.  He  discussed  his
counseling  and  treatment.  He told his employer that his next  step was  to  engage  with
the  Employee  Assistance  Program  to  find  a  therapist,  and  that  he  would  likely  start
attending  Narcotics  Anonymous  meetings.  Applicant’s  security  clearance  was
suspended in December 2019. (Tr. at 41, 44; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2, 3, 5,
6; AE M)
Applicant continued  using  methamphetamine  after  he  reported  it  to  his employer.
He used  marijuana  for  the  first time  in early 2020  when  it was provided  to  him  during  a
sexual  encounter.  He   received   counseling   from   a   psychologist   from   July   2021   to
September  2021.  He   was   diagnosed   with   bipolar  II   disorder   and   adjustment  disorder
with mixed  anxiety and depressed  mood. (Tr. at 32; Applicant’s  response to SOR;  GE  2-
5; AE M)
Applicant stopped using methamphetamine in about June 2021, but he continued
to  use  marijuana  until  about  April  2023.  He  was  interviewed  by  a  background
investigator in January 2022. He discussed his “hook-ups” and his drug use. He stated
that  he  had  been  in  an  open  relationship  since  about  2012  with  an  individual  (current
husband) who is aware of his sexual encounters. (Tr. at 30-32; Applicant’s response to
SOR; GE 2, 3, 5; AE M)
Applicant told the background investigator that he used marijuana about once a
week  or  every  other  week  at  home  alone.  He  lives  in  a  state  where  marijuana
possession and use do not violate state law. He stated that marijuana helped to fight his
cravings  for  methamphetamine.  He  stated  that  he  did  not  believe  he  used  marijuana
while  holding  a  security  clearance  because  his security  clearance was  no  longer valid
as  of  December  2019.  He  thought  that  his  employer  permitted  his  marijuana  use
because he did not have a security clearance. He stated that he would continue to use
marijuana  but  would  stop  if  it  was  required  for  his  employment  or  security  clearance.
(Tr. at 33, 41, 44; GE 2)
Applicant  continued  using  marijuana  after  the  background  interview.  In  his
February 2023 response to interrogatories, he wrote that he was using marijuana about
once  or  twice  a  week.  He  wrote  that  marijuana  helped  him  stay  sober  from
methamphetamine.  He  wrote,  “If  required,  in order to  regain my  clearance, I  would  be
willing to give it up.” (Tr. at 43-44; GE 2)
Applicant  stated  that  he  has  not  used  marijuana  or  any  other  illegal  drug  since
April  2023.  He  believes  that  marijuana  is  no  longer  necessary  for  his  sobriety  from
methamphetamine.  He  tested  negative  in  drug  tests  administered  in  September  2023
and  November  2023.  He  successfully  completed  an  eight-hour  drug  awareness
program  in  December  2023.  He  signed  a  statement  of  intent  to  abstain  from  all  drug
involvement  and  substance  misuse,  acknowledging  that  any  future  involvement  or
misuse  is  grounds  for  revocation  of  national  security  eligibility.  (Tr.  at  33-35,  43;
Applicant’s response to SOR; AE B-D, M)
Applicant engaged a board-certified psychologist for an evaluation  in December
2023. He diagnosed Applicant with bipolar II disorder, most recent episode hypomanic,
in full remission; compulsive sexual behavior disorder, in early remission; and stimulant
use  disorder,  amphetamine-type  substance,  moderate,  in  sustained  remission.  He
found  that  when  Applicant  “first  sought  care  for  mental  health  symptoms  in  2011,  his
condition  was  misdiagnosed  so  he  was  prescribed  Wellbutrin  which  exacerbated  his
manic  symptoms.”  The  psychologist  reported  that  in  2014,  Applicant  was  seen  by  his
treating  psychiatrist,  who  diagnosed  him  with  bipolar  II  disorder  and  prescribed  him
mood  stabilizing  medications  with  positive  results.  The  psychologist  also  found  that
“[d]espite  finding  substantial  relief  from  mood  stabilizers,  [Applicant]  continued  to
struggle  with  impulsive  and  compulsive  behaviors.”  Regarding  Applicant’s  sexual
behavior, the psychologist found:
is  often   preoccupied   with   sexual  thoughts  and
[Applicant’s test scores]  are typically seen  as  consistent with  the  scores of
those   who   engage   in  or  have   engaged   in   sexually  compulsive   behavior.
He  admitted   his sexual behavior has  caused   problems  for him   in   his  life,
that  he   has  felt   distressed   about  his  sexual   behaviors,  and   that  he   tried
and  failed  to  stop  engaging  in  distressing  sexual behavior in the  past.  He
admitted   he
that,
historically,  his  sexual   behavior  has  created   problems   for  him   and   his
family  and   emotionally  hurt  those   in  his  life.   He  admitted   he   has  sought
treatment  for  sexual  behavior  problems.  [Applicant]   admitted   he   has  had
multiple   sexual  partners  at  the   same   time   and   has  engaged   in   risky  sex
even   though   he   knew  it  could   cause   him   harm.   He  admitted   he   had
cruised   public  places,   such   as  parks,  for  sex  with   strangers  so   that  his
sexual behavior has put him at risk for lewd conduct or public indecency.

*
Fortunately,  through  specific  treatment  for  sexual  issues,  participation  in
SAA,  effective  mood  regulation,  and  personal  growth  and  maturity,
[Applicant]  now  seems  to  have  gained  a  fair  measure  of  control over  his
sexual  behaviors.  He  has  now  been  monogamous  in  his  current
relationship  since  October  2023  suggesting  this  condition  is  in  early
remission.
The psychologist concluded:
Based  on  all  the  available  data,  [Applicant’s]  mental  health  symptoms
appear  to  be  well  controlled  with  medication  at  this  time.  He  likely  still
experiences mild mood symptoms but he has developed excellent insight
concerning  bipolar  disorder,  is  able  to  manage  his  symptoms  and  has  a
track  record  of  seeking  help  when  needed.  [Applicant]  no  longer  uses
methamphetamine and given his limited use history and the time since last
use, the risk he will relapse seems quite low. Likewise, he does not seem
to be at risk for returning to marijuana use.  [Applicant] has struggled with
his sexual identity and behavior for most of his adult life and this seems to
be an ongoing  challenge for him.  He has however, gained much through
his 10 year history of treatment and he has shown a pattern of increased
self-control over the last several years. He has now been monogamous for
more  than  three  months,  further  suggesting  mastery  over  his  sexual
behavior.
At  this  time,  based  on  the  available  data  and  given  his  current  mental
status and track record of successfully managing a clearance in the past,
it  is  unlikely  that  any  of  his  conditions  could  negatively  impact  his
reliability,  trustworthiness,  or  judgment  while  working  in  a  cleared  setting
or around classified information. (AE M)
Applicant  submitted  documents  and  letters  attesting  to  his  excellent  job
performance  and  strong  moral  character.  He  is  praised  for  his  professionalism,
trustworthiness,  reliability,  work  ethic,  and  loyalty  to  the  United  States.  He  is
recommended for a security clearance. (AE F, H-J)
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental  Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)
The  DSM-5  is  the  standard  classification  of  mental  disorders  used  by  mental
health professionals in the United States. The following is summarized from the DSM-5:
Bipolar II Disorder
Bipolar  II  disorder  is  characterized  by  a  clinical  course  of  recurring  mood
episodes  consisting  of  one  or  more  major  depressive  episodes  and  at  least  one
hypomanic  episode.  The  major  depressive  episode  must  last  at  least  two  weeks,  and
the hypomanic episode must last at least four days to meet the diagnostic criteria.
Major Depressive Episode
The  essential  feature  of  a  major  depressive  episode  is  a  period  of  at  least  two
weeks during which there is either depressed mood or the loss of interest or pleasure in
nearly all activities.
Hypomanic Episode
A  distinct  period  of  abnormally  and  persistently  elevated,  expansive,  or  irritable
mood and abnormally and persistently increased activity or energy, lasting at least four
consecutive days and present most of the day, nearly every day.
The  episode  is  associated  with  an  unequivocal  change  in  functioning  that  is
uncharacteristic of the individual when not  symptomatic. The disturbance in mood and
the change in functioning are observable by others.  The episode is not severe enough
to  cause  marked  impairment  in  social  or  occupational  functioning  or  to  necessitate
hospitalization.
Adjustment Disorder
The  essential  feature  of  adjustment  disorders  is  the  presence  of  emotional  or
behavioral  symptoms  in  response  to  an  identifiable  stressor.  By  definition,  the
disturbance  in  adjustment  disorders  begins  within  three  months  of  onset  of  a  stressor
and lasts no longer than six months after the stressor or its consequences have ceased.
A stressor may be a single event (e.g., a termination of a romantic relationship), or there
may  be  multiple  stressors  (e.g.,  marked  business  difficulties  and  marital  problems).
Stressors may be recurrent (e.g., associated with seasonal business crises, unfulfilling
sexual  relationships)  or  continuous  (e.g.,  a  persistent  painful  illness  with  increasing
disability,  living  in  a  crime-ridden  neighborhood).  Adjustment  disorders  are  associated
with an increased risks of suicide attempts and completed suicide.
Symptoms or behaviors are clinically significant, as evidenced by one or both of
the following:
1.  Marked  distress  that  is  out  of  proportion  to  the  severity  or  intensity  of  the
stressor,  taking  into  account  the  external  context  and  the  cultural  factors  that
might influence symptom severity and presentation.
2.  Significant  impairment  in  social,  occupational,  or  other  important  areas  of
functioning.
Substance  Use  Disorder
The  essential  feature  of  a  substance  use  disorder  (including  cannabis  use
disorder  and  amphetamine  use  disorder)  is  a  cluster  of  cognitive,  behavioral,  and
physiological  symptoms  indicating  that  the  individual  continues  using  the  substance
despite significant substance-related problems.
Fetishistic  Disorder
The  paraphilic  basis  of  fetishistic  disorder  involves  the  persistent  and  repetitive
use  of  or  dependence  on  nonliving  objects  or  a  highly  specific  focus  on  a  (typically
nongenital) body part as primary elements associated with sexual arousal. A diagnosis
of fetishistic disorder must include clinically significant personal distress or psychosocial
role impairment.

He  has  been  diagnosed  with  complex  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD)  from  his
childhood trauma. He managed his anxiety over his traumatic memories for years, but
the anxiety increased as he got older. In about September 2019, he became involved in
a series of extramarital sexual encounters (“hook-ups”) in which he explored bondage,
discipline,  sadism,  and  masochism  (BDSM)  with  other  consenting  adults.  He  did  not
engage  in  extreme  BDSM,  and  no  one  was  ever  injured.  He  described  it  as  a  “sex
addiction,”  and  he  estimated  that  he  had  about  150  partners.  He  met  the  individuals
through online forums. Some of the individuals knew he worked for a federal contractor,
but  he  did  not  discuss  his  work.  He  believes  his  sexual  activities  were  related  to  his
childhood trauma. (Tr. at 18-19, 32-35; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 2)
Applicant  used  marijuana  as  a  youth,  and  then  went  decades  without  using
marijuana.  He  resumed  his  use  in  about  September  2019,  about  the  same  time  he
became  involved  with  BDSM.  His  marijuana  use  was  also  connected  to  his  childhood
trauma.  A  friend  who  was  a  Vietnam  veteran  told  him  that  marijuana  helped  with  his
PTSD  symptoms.  Applicant  used  marijuana  in  various  forms  almost  every  night.  He
usually  used  it  alone,  but  he  also  used  it  occasionally  during  his  extramarital
encounters.  At  the  time,  medical  marijuana  did  not  violate  state  law,  but  recreational
marijuana had not yet become permitted under state law. Applicant knew that marijuana
use  violated  federal  law,  was  against  his  employer’s  drug-free  workplace  policy,  and
was  inconsistent  with  his  responsibilities  as  a  clearance  holder.  He  held  a  security
clearance at  the  time, but  he  did not have  access  to  classified  information.  He  initially
bought marijuana from individuals who received it from medical marijuana dispensaries.
After  his  state  law  changed  to  permit  recreational  marijuana  use,  he  bought  the
marijuana from dispensaries himself. (Tr. at 12, 18-27, 32, 42; Applicant’s response to
SOR; GE 1-3)
Applicant  was  stopped  by  the  police  for  driving  through  a  red  light  in  late  May
2022. The police officer noted what appeared to be marijuana and paraphernalia in the
car.  After  a  sobriety  test,  the  police  drew  blood  to  be  tested,  and  charged  him  with
driving under the influence (DUI) of liquor, drugs, or vapors. Applicant stated that he had
nothing to drink. He used marijuana the night before but nothing the day he was driving.
He  stated  that  the  blood  test  detected  no  alcohol,  and  it  was  not  tested  for  THC.  The
charge was dismissed. (Tr. at 12, 24-25; Applicant’s response to SOR; GE 1-3)
Applicant  reported  his  DUI  charge  to  his  employer  about  two  days  after  the
incident.  The  description  he  provided  to  his  facility  security  officer  (FSO)  is  consistent
with his testimony and is accepted as fact. (Tr. at 12, 24-25; GE 3) The FSO reported
the incident to the DoD in an incident report that contained the following narrative:
[Applicant]  stated  that he  realizes that he  will  have  to  change  his approach
to   treatment  for  his   PTSD  as  long   as   cannabis  is  not   federally  legal.  He
has  been   through   two   years  of  therapy   and   is   now   much   improved.
[Applicant] stated that he went to a  meeting Friday night and  got a sponsor
and  plan[s]  to  do  a  treatment  intensive [sic] as soon  as he  can  arrange  it.
Employee will report future status.  (GE 3)
Applicant  continued  to  use  marijuana  for  about  two  weeks  after  he  reported
himself. He stated that it was difficult to stop immediately. He has not used any illegal
drugs  since  he  last  used  marijuana  in  June  2022.  He  informed  his  wife  about  his
marijuana use, his extramarital activities, and his involvement in BDSM shortly after his
DUI  arrest.  He  also  informed  people  at  work,  his  church,  and  his  family.  He  has  not
been involved in any extramarital activities since he told his wife. (Tr. at 13-14, 24-26,
34-41; Applicant’s response to SOR: GE 1, 2)
Applicant attended Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), Narcotics Anonymous (NA), and
Sex  Addicts  Anonymous  (SAA)  meetings.  He  and  his  wife  receive  therapy  from  a
certified sex addiction therapist. Applicant is actively involved with an online community
of men who are in recovery; he attends in-person meetings once a week; and he sees a
counselor  once  a  week.  He  embraced  his  faith,  and  he  has  turned  to  meditation  and
prayer instead of sex and marijuana. He no longer associates with any of the individuals
with whom he used illegal drugs. (Tr. at 13-14, 27-31, 41; Applicant’s response to SOR:
GE 1, 2)
Applicant  submitted  a  Questionnaire  for  National  Security  Positions  (SF-86)  in
August 2022. He reported his marijuana use and his DUI arrest. He fully discussed his
marijuana  use  and  his  extramarital  activities  during  his  background  interview  in
February 2023. (GE 1, 2)
Applicant called a witness who has worked with him for about eight to nine years.
He described Applicant as “a very honest guy to a fault actually.” Applicant informed him
and others at work about his issues. He stated that Applicant may be many things, but a
“liar is not one of them.” (Tr. at 42-47)

a defense contractor. He was promoted to director, lead tester, and manager in 2016.
Applicant also owns and manages a consulting business.  He married in 1993 and has
three children, ages 18 to 25. He currently has a secret security clearance. His security
eligibility was previously suspended in 2006 and reinstated in 2009.
The SOR alleges under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior) that (SOR ¶ 1.a) on at least
three occasion between August 2006 and September 2006, Applicant videotaped up the
skirts  of  unsuspecting  women  without  their  consent;  (SOR  ¶  1.b)  in  September  2006,
Applicant was charged and found guilty of five counts of Unlawful Filming or Photography

February 2018 with filming a nude person without consent. Finally, the SOR cross-alleges
allegations in SOR ¶¶ 1.b and 1.c, under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).
In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR ¶ 1.a and 1.b. He denied SOR
¶ 1.c, filming women in 2017 at a department store, but admitted to being charged. He
noted the charge was dismissed and that he is applying for an expungement of the record.
He generally admitted SOR ¶ 2.a consistent with his admissions in SOR ¶ 1. He submitted
background information about himself, a “life synopsis,” and performance evaluations with

2006 Episodes of Criminal Sexual Conduct
In September 2006, while on active duty, Applicant was arrested at an airport after
a  passenger  notified  police  that  Applicant  was  using  a  camcorder  placed  underneath
women’s dresses to record them (known as “up skirting”) while they picked up bags at a
baggage carrousel. Applicant was traveling on official Government business. Applicant
was confronted by police at the scene, and he denied that he had taken pictures or filmed
anyone or anything. Applicant also denied possessing any tapes or media memory cards
for the camcorder.
During questioning by police, Applicant moved from his seat and a videotape fell
out from his pocket underneath him. When confronted by a police supervisor, Applicant
changed his story and confessed to filming women by sliding his bag underneath their
skirt without their consent or knowledge. Applicant consented to a search of his bag, and
a  video  camera  and  several  tapes  were  found.  The  police  viewed  the  recordings  and
confirmed that Applicant positioned the camera inside of his bag with the camera lens
facing up, and recorded five women. Applicant admitted that one tape was from another
airport  where  he  conducted  the  same  activity.  His  confiscated  videos  also  showed
evidence of taping inside of a mall and possibly a military department store.
Applicant  was  charged  and  found  guilty  at  trial  of  five  misdemeanor  counts  of
unlawful  videotaping.  Applicant  sought  counseling  and  treatment  during  the  pre-
sentencing  process,  and  his  attorney  requested  sentencing  be  deferred  pending
completion  of “mental  evaluations and  treatments.” (GE 4; Incident Data Sheet Report
pg.  10.)  Applicant  was  sentenced  on  March  20,  2007,  to  confinement  for  two-years,
suspended, with the charges dismissed pending successful completion of probation for
two years and no further incidents. (GE 9.)
Applicant testified to filming six to seven women during about 40 minutes at the
airport  in  which  he  was  flying  for  Government  business.  Applicant  admitted  to  filming
women at another airport after returning from his father-in-law’s funeral. He then admitted
to “possibly” traveling to an electronics store where he filmed additional women. Applicant
denied filming women at any other location, despite the evidence on the video recordings.
Applicant hid the tapes from his spouse, and “struggled” to keep them from her. Applicant
learned about up skirting from the internet, and investigators found 1,700 searches for
“up skirting” on his personal computer. Applicant testified that he last watched up-skirting
videos while on probation in 2007, and has not recorded additional videos since 2006.
In September 2006, Applicant’s security clearance was suspended. In June 2007,
Applicant attended an administrative Board of Inquiry to show cause as to why he should
be retained in the military. After a hearing, he was retained on active duty and his security
clearance  was  reinstated  in  2009.  In  Applicant’s  eligibility  determination  letter,  he  was
“cautioned that receipt of any derogatory information in the future, especially of a similar
nature, will be cause for reconsideration of your eligibility for a security clearance and/or
special access.” (GE 8.)
In  2008,  Applicant  was  directed  to  undergo  a  medical  evaluation  at  a  military
behavioral healthcare center. He was evaluated by a staff psychiatrist. (GE 6.) Applicant
attributed his behavior of filming up women’s skirts in September 2006 as a response to
stress  related  to  difficult  work,  not  being  promoted,  and  difficulties  with  a  child  with
physical disabilities. On the day he was caught, Applicant worried about being late for a
flight so he rescheduled for a later flight. As he sat at the airport “waiting and working,” he
was  overcome  with  worry  and  had   an  impulse  to  film  under   women’s  skirts  for   an
adrenaline rush. He filmed six to seven women for 40 minutes, but felt worse afterwards.
Applicant reported to the psychiatrist three incidents where he videotaped women
without their consent. He described the “most recent incident” as occurring in September
2006. He noted that prior to the September incident, he had “videotaped the private areas
of unknowing women in public.” He described that in August 2006, he was feeling guilty,
sad, and frustrated about having to return early from the funeral of his father-in-law due
to  work  requirements,  so  he  videotaped  unsuspecting  women  at  the  airport  for  an
“immediate  rush.”  That  day,  he  also  went  to  an  electronics  store  and  proceeded  to
videotape underneath women’s skirts at the store.
Applicant relayed to the psychiatrist that when he was approached by police at the
airport in September 2006, he was evasive in answering questions, but “was certain that
he  did  not  deny  having  videotaped  these  women.”  (GE  6.)  After  the  “last”  incident,
Applicant reported seeing a psychologist once a week or on alternating weeks for one
year, from 2006 to 2007. (GE 6.) Applicant participated in couples counseling, and was
involved with his church. (GE 6.)
The psychiatrist concluded that Applicant had been “experiencing  overwhelming
stressors that contributed to his having videotaped unsuspecting women underneath their
skirts.” She credited him with “voluntarily” seeking help and “underwent treatment for one
year under the care of a psychologist [which] suggests good insight into how inappropriate
his actions had been and that to seek mental health counseling to address this behavior
in order to prevent it showed good judgment.” She noted that “three episodes occurred
within the context of multiple stressors,” and “this makes the episodes appear to be more
circumscribed  and  as  a  response  to  stressors.”  Finally,  she  recommended  “regular
monitoring by a mental health specialist to ensure that he is addressing the stress in his
life productively and is aware of controlling  his impulses, especially under stress.”  The
psychiatrist made no DSM diagnosis or prognosis.
2017 Episode of Criminal Sexual Conduct
In  June  2017,  Applicant’s  daughter  was  playing  in  a  lacrosse  tournament  in
another city. Applicant and his family drove to the tournament to watch. At about 5pm the
same day of the tournament, a customer at a nearby department store reported  that a
man used his cell phone facing up in a red shopping basket to film up the skirt of women,
without their knowledge or consent. The store security officer interviewed the witness and
personally observed the man place a basket on the floor behind several women with the
camera facing up. The man then moved away to look at merchandise and returned to the
basket after the women left the spot. At one point, the man attempted to pull a women’s
skirt open to enhance the view.
The man was recorded by store security cameras and identified as he exited the
store. A close up, color photo of the man was submitted to local police, and distributed
via  an  online  crime  solvers  network.  The  photo  shows  a  man  that  clearly  resembles
Applicant, wearing a shirt bearing the name of a small college located in another state
from which Applicant’s son attended. As a result of the photo being displayed on social
media by the police, at least 100 friends, associates, and coworkers contacted Applicant
and his spouse and identified him as the person in the picture.
Applicant “does not recall” being at the store, but agreed that the picture “looks like
me.” The police also interviewed Applicant’s coworkers who clearly identified him as the
man in the photo. Applicant testified that he owns a similar shirt as that in the photo, but
his shirt adds the word “lacrosse” near the name of the school. He testified that he was
at his daughter’s lacrosse tournament that day, and although he owns a car similar to the
one described in the police report, he “would have” driven a minivan with his family. He
“does not believe” he ever left the tournament that day or visited the department store.
Applicant’s  spouse,  who  was  apparently  with  Applicant,  did  not  testify  or  otherwise
corroborate Applicant’s account, however Applicant stated that his spouse believes the
picture  was  of  him,  and  that  he  owns  a  shirt  as  shown  in  the  picture.  Applicant  was
arrested and charged in February 2018 with misdemeanor filming a nonconsented nude
person. The case was dismissed as nolle prosequi in April 2018. Applicant denied going
to the store or committing the offense.
Applicant was interviewed by Government security investigators in 2014 and 2018.
He admitted that the 2006 up-skirting videos were taken for an “adrenaline rush” and were
not harmful to anyone. In his 2018 interview, Applicant denied the 2017 incident photo
was of him, although it looked like him. He described the incident as a “coincidence.” He
stated that he was not attempting to victimize anyone in his 2006 up-skirting behavior. He
claimed  that  it  impacted  his  marriage,  but  had  no  impact  on  his  home,  school,  work,
friendships,  physical  or  emotional  health,  reputation,  judgment,  reliability,  finances,  or
ability to hold a security clearance. He said it was “an isolated incident,” but he knowingly
participated in the conduct. In testimony, he admitted his 2006 filming was harmful to his
victims, but denied telling the investigator that it was an isolated incident. He denied that
his 2006 behavior was a pattern, and said his involvement was “risk taking behavior” that
he no longer engaged in.
Applicant testified that he attended personal talk-therapy and marriage counseling
from  2006  to  2009.  This  is  contrary  to  the  one-year  counseling  he  told  the  military
psychiatrist in 2008. He claimed he left counseling in 2009 feeling “on top of his life.” No
counseling records from 2006 to 2009 were offered into evidence.
In August 2017, after being identified in the latest up-skirting incident,  Applicant
stated that he began talk therapy counseling and mediation to “get at the root cause” of
behavior, and to better communicate with his wife and children. He also sought help with
viewing pornography, and attends Sex Addicts Anonymous meetings from two to three
times  per  week,  or  up  to  five  times  per  week  on  occasions,  to  address  all  levels  of
inappropriate conduct. He is working on the 12-step program, and talks with his priest.
In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant described his current counselor as a “certified
sex addiction therapist.” He stated that he has been attending counseling since August
2017; initially for marriage counseling but it evolved into individual counseling. Applicant
claims  his  counselor  diagnosed  him  with  “general  anxiety  disorder.”  No  medical  or
counseling  record  were  offered  into  evidence  by  Applicant  to  support  any  diagnosis.
Applicant stated he was referred to Sex Addicts Anonymous with the primary purpose to
stop addictive sexual behavior through the 12-step program, and to help others recover
from sexual addiction. He has attended two weekend retreats and has a sponsor. (Ans.)
Applicant’s  counselor  testified  at  the  hearing.  The  counselor  stated  that  he  is  a
licensed  clinical  professional  counselor  (LCPC),  with  a  master’s  degree  in  pastoral
counseling awarded in in 2013, and an undergraduate degree in biology. No Curriculum
Vitae  was  provided  showing  the  counselor’s  education,  expertise,  or  qualifications.  He
has worked as a counselor since 2013, and Applicant began seeing him in August 2017.
He  sees  Applicant  for  “general  counseling,”  once  per  week.  Applicant’s  spouse  was
included in one session, despite efforts to invite her for marriage counseling. He testified
that at times Applicant attends group counseling, and “may be”  involved in group sex-
addiction counseling. The counselor refused to disclose details of Applicant’s admissions
or treatment, other than to say he is counseling him for “trauma anxiety for life issues and
incidents.”  The  counselor  believes  that  there  is  no  need  for  continued  therapy  as
Applicant  has  a  deepening  understanding  of  others,  and  more  compassion  and
understanding with his spouse. He believes Applicant is truthful, has grown in maturity
and ability to connect with others, and he has no concerns regarding Applicant’s future
behavior and ability to protect sensitive information.
Applicant’s  supervisor
testified  about  Applicant’s  work  and  exceptional
performance ratings over the past two years. The witness was not aware of the security
concerns  alleged  in  the  SOR,  or  the  2006  and  2017  up-skirting  incidents.  Applicant
testified that the 2006 incidents resulted from depression, and that his up-skirting behavior
was  not  about  sex,  rather  it  was  about  participating  in  “risky  behavior.”  He  expressed
remorse  and  shame  for  the  behavior  to  which  he  admitted.  He  continues  to  attend
counseling and is involved in church activities. However, he also continues to deny his
presence at or participation in the 2017 up-skirting incident.

"Applicant is a 49-year-old aircraft painter for a defense contractor, employed since
2015. Applicant graduated from high school in 1991. He was married in 1992 and divorced
in  2009.  He  remarried  in  2012  and  was  divorced  in  2018.  He  has  one  adult  child.  His
second spouse had a daughter that lived with them until 2018. Applicant currently has a
secret security clearance.
The SOR alleges under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior) that Applicant was arrested
in  January  2016  and  charged  with  felony  indecency  with  a  child/sexual  contact.  He
pleaded guilty and is on community supervision until August 2024. The SOR alleges the
same facts under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct).
Applicant’s second spouse had a 15-year-old daughter that suffered from Postural
Orthostatic  Tachycardia  Syndrome  (POTS)  caused  by  poor  blood  flow.  This  condition
apparently  caused  pain  in  her  arms  and  legs.  To  relieve  symptoms,  Applicant  often
rubbed her arms, legs, and scalp, at her request and often in front of his spouse. On one
occasion in December 2015, Applicant  intentionally grazed the side of the girl’s breast
over  her  shirt  while  riding  together  in  a  truck.  On  another  occasion  in  January  2016,
Applicant stated he was alone with the girl and began rubbing her while she was in bed
sleeping. During this occurrence, he used his hand to touch the bottom of her breast and
between  her  legs  several  times.  He  did  not  penetrate  her  or  pass  over  her  breasts  or
vagina.  Shortly  thereafter,  he  was  concerned  about  the  criminality  of  his  conduct,  and
apologized to her.
The  girl  reported  the  incidents  to  her  school  authorities,  and  the  police  were
notified. A warrant was issued for Applicant’s arrest and he turned himself into police on
January 20, 2016. Applicant was not indicted, but entered a guilty plea to an information
charging him with injury to a child  with intent to commit bodily injury (injury to child), a
third  degree  felony.  Applicant  received  a  deferred  finding  of  guilt,  and  was  placed  on
community supervision for seven years, known as deferred adjudication probation. The
conditions  of  probation  include  inter  alia,  submission  to  a  clinical  assessment  and
treatment  program  with  a  court-appointed  sex  offender  treatment  provider;  complete
clinical polygraph examinations as directed by the therapist; have no contact with children
under 17 years old; submit a DNA sample; submit to alcohol and drug testing; permit a
probation  officer  access  to  his  residence  for  examination  of  computers  and  electronic
media; and refrain from access to pornography, certain places, and personal use of the
internet. Applicant’s probation period ends in August 2024.
Applicant  began  counseling  with  the  court-appointed  provider  on  January  19,
2016. He completed 185 treatment sessions and one year of aftercare on August 2, 2020.
He will continue to attend one group session per month until 2024 when his probation
ends.  Applicant  was  initially  evaluated  as  having  an  “excellent  chance  of  successfully
completing treatment and community supervision,” and had a “low risk to re-offend.” She
noted that  from the  beginning,  he “took full responsibility  for  his  actions and has been
completely honest in all matters.” Applicant complied with state standards for sex offender
treatment,  and  successfully  passed  several  maintenance  polygraphs  throughout
treatment, the last in February 2020. The polygraphs are intended to measure the honesty
and complying with conditions of treatment and supervision. Applicant also passed a sex
history polygraph that indicated that he had no other victims or abhorrent sexual behavior.
Finally, Applicant took a penile plethysmograph to assess his sexual arousal. The results
showed that Applicant “did not have any deviant sexual arousal.”
The counselor noted that Applicant was the “most compliant client I have ever had
in my 38 years of experience.” She noted that it was very rewarding to work with such a
motivated  client  atypical  of  the  majority  of  offenders  she  has  treated.  The  counselor
reported  that  Applicant  has  no  other  victims,  was  successfully  rehabilitated,  and
represents an extremely low risk to re-offend. She noted that due to his openness and
honesty, he does not present a security risk. She stated that this was Applicant’s first and
only  offense,  and  there  is  no  evidence  of  questionable  judgment,  irresponsibility,  or
emotional instability. (AE A, B, D)
Applicant’s probation officer noted that he is in full compliance of the conditions of
probation,  successfully  completed  sex  offender  treatment,  and  has  no  concerns
pertaining  to  Applicant.  (AE  C,  E)  County  policy  requires  Applicant  to  remain  in
maintenance group sessions once per month until his discharge from probation on August
23, 2024. (AE C)
Applicant disclosed his conduct to his family and friends. After the incidents, the
victim’s mother wrote a letter to the criminal court judge in support of Applicant to retain
his employment and avoid severe criminal penalties. She noted that Applicant had been
a “wonderful father” to her children, and  that he is “truly remorseful” and  in  unbearable
pain for his conduct. She divorced him two years later and she and her daughter live apart
from him. His sister-in-law noted that Applicant made a mistake in judgment, expressed
regret and remorse to the girl,  and he has been  “completely honest and upfront about
what has transpired with the courts, his family, and his counselor.” Similar sentiments and
support were expressed by Applicant’s father, daughter, brother, brother-in-law, cousins,
and friends.
Applicant lives alone in a home located in a remote rural environment. He has no
contact  with  the  victim  or  her  family,  and  does  not  allow  unaccompanied  contact  with
children  or  personal  internet  access.  The  victim  is  now  an  adult  attending  college  and
Applicant  has  not  had  contact  with  her  since  the  incidents.  Applicant  paid  a  $20,000
settlement to her in exchange for a waiver of any claims. Applicant stated that he is well
liked at  work, but does  not get regular  written  evaluations.  Applicant  did not report his
arrest to security personnel at his company until January 5, 2017, almost one year after
his arrest, on advice of his counsel. He has not disclosed the incidents to his supervisor
or coworkers for fear of retribution and ridicule.

"Applicant  is  59  years  old,  and  married  with  three  adult  children.  He  has  a  high
school  education  with  additional  college  classes.  Applicant  is  employed  by  a  defense
contractor as an Analyzer and is seeking to obtain national security eligibility for a security
clearance. (Government Exhibit 1 at Sections 12, 13A, 17, and 18; Tr. 17.)
Paragraph 1 (Guideline  D, Sexual Behavior)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because he engaged in sexual behavior that reflects a lack of judgment, or may subject
Applicant  to  undue  influence  or  coercion.  In  his  Answer,  Applicant  admitted  the  two
allegations in the SOR under this guideline with exceptions and explanations, stating in
his Answer,  “I admit to a sexual relationship for 6 months, [approx.] 1989 to 1990.”  He
also submitted additional evidence to support his request for a finding of national security
eligibility.
Applicant testified that he was sexually involved with his sister-in-law (Ms. One)
approximately 20 to 50 times between 1993 and 1994. At that time she was 14 and 15
years old, being born in 1978. Applicant was in his late 20s at the time of their involvement
and in the Navy. With regard to the relationship, Applicant stated, “It was wrong. It was
totally  wrong.  I  have  no  excuses.”  I  have  compared  Applicant’s  testimony  of  the
relationship with the statements of Ms. One to local and Naval authorities. Many of the
claims made by Ms. One appear to be exaggerations, particularly about the number of
times they had sexual intercourse. (Government Exhibits 3 and 4; Tr. 19-21, 40-46.)
In  May  1995  Ms.  One’s  parents  found  out  about  her  sexual  relationship  with
Applicant and reported it to the local police. The local police coordinated with the Naval
authorities  and  Applicant  was  arrested  and  charged  with  Unlawful  Sexual  Intercourse,
Oral Copulation of a Person Under 16, and Lewd Act Upon A Child. From the available
evidence, including Applicant’s testimony, it appears he pled guilty to Lewd or Lascivious
Acts With a Child 14 or 15 Years of Age, and Sexual Intercourse With a Child 14 or 15
Years of Age. He was sentenced to one year in the county jail. He ended up serving eight
months  on  work  release.  Applicant  also  served  probation  successfully.  He  has  had  to
register yearly as a sex offender since that time as required by state law. Applicant has
been consistent in fulfilling his legal responsibilities. (Government Exhibits 5, 6, and 7; Tr.
21-27, 29-31, 40.)
During the time he was incarcerated Applicant was separated from the Navy for
misconduct with a General Discharge (Under Honorable Conditions), as supported by his
DD Form 214. (Applicant Exhibit E; Tr. 27-28.)
Paragraph 2 (Guideline J, Criminal Conduct)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant’s conduct alleged under
Paragraph 1 was also criminal activity that creates doubt about his judgment, reliability,
and trustworthiness. By its very nature, such conduct calls into question Applicant’s ability
or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Applicant denied this allegation.
Paragraph 3  (Guideline E, Personal Conduct)
The Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance
because  he  has  engaged  in  conduct  involving  questionable  judgment,  lack  of  candor,
dishonesty,  or  unwillingness  to  comply  with  rules  and  regulations.  In  his  Answer,
Applicant denied all three subparagraphs under this guideline.
3.a.   The   Government  alleged   in   this  subparagraph  that  Applicant’s  sexual
relationship with Miss One, as set forth above, was also cognizable under this guideline.
3.b   and  3.c.  Applicant   was  interviewed  by  an  investigator  from  the   Office  of
Personnel Management on June 20, 2017. A Report of  Investigation (ROI) was prepared
by the investigator, which Applicant certified to be accurate on September 28, 2019. The
investigator  prefaces the discussion about the above events as follows, “He [Applicant]
offered the following detailed information to the best of  his memory: in  approximately 1985
(exact date  not recalled) he was in the navy [sic] and  was stationed  in  Redding,  CA.”  The
ROI goes on to state  that Applicant  became involved with Ms.  One in  1985  (when  she
would have been eight years old). The  ROI  reports that  Applicant further stated that the
relationship  lasted  six   months  or  less.   These  statements  are  factually  incorrect.
(Government Exhibit 2; Tr. 33-39.)
Applicant  was  extensively  questioned  about  the  differences  between   the
statements   in   the  ROI   and   the  facts  as  presented  by  other  exhibits,  and   agreed   to  by
Applicant in his testimony. Applicant  adamantly stated he simply could not remember the
exact years things happened  when he was questioned  in 2017, or when he prepared his
Answer. He  particularly stated that he did not have  access to the exhibits presented by
the Government, which  contained accurate dates. Applicant testified, “I’ve  never denied
any  wrongdoing.”   When  asked  by  Department  Counsel  if  he  was  downplaying  what
happened between himself and  Ms.  One he testified, “No. I would never downplay this.
It’s  not  something  that’s  taken  lightly  at  all.  I  would  never  take  this  lightly.  So,  I  would
never downplay anything. Like I said, I would rather  get it right the first time instead of
having to reopen this over and over again. But, I will if I have to.” (Tr.  36-39.)
Mitigation
Applicant’s  mother-in-law, wife and oldest son wrote letters on Applicant’s behalf.
They all acknowledge the “unfortunate situation that involved both of  my daughters.”  They
all say he has paid a severe price over many years and has learned from  his mistakes.
